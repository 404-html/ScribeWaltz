1
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:06,560
Hey, what's going on is bill barn. It's
the Monday morning podcast for Monday, uh,

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,600
November 24th,

3
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,710
2014 2014. How are you,
what's going on? Once again,

4
00:00:16,711 --> 00:00:20,500
I'm recording it nice and
early Monday morning. Uh,

5
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,520
you know,
so I gotta keep my freaking voice down.

6
00:00:23,521 --> 00:00:28,350
I don't want to disturb the construction.
It's winding down everybody.

7
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:32,490
It's winding down. They painted
the fucking walls, you know.

8
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,460
Well it goes a couple of little
bit of electrical things.

9
00:00:35,461 --> 00:00:39,760
A couple of big bank boons, which of
course will take for fucking ever. Um,

10
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:45,450
I actually found out that I need a new
electrical panel outside my house because,

11
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,140
uh, the one that I had was, uh, you know,

12
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:51,930
just a hunk of shit and
a, so I go out. Right.

13
00:00:51,931 --> 00:00:55,050
So take the one off that I have
and put a new one there. Right.

14
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,380
And this fucking governmental cont right.

15
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,820
He shows up with this fucking tape measure
and he said there was no safe way for

16
00:01:08,281 --> 00:01:13,110
his guys to put a ladder up because they
had this fucking palm tree thing. Right.

17
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,560
Which now, and even natural. Okay.

18
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,440
To the ecosystem out here.
Some jerk off,

19
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:23,970
liked him way back in the day and
stuck a fucking coconut on his boat or

20
00:01:23,971 --> 00:01:28,170
whatever the hell the seed is, right?
Is that the seat of a palm tree?

21
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,660
Is it a coconut or is that the fruit?

22
00:01:30,661 --> 00:01:35,070
It bears and within the coconut
there's the seed. I don't know.

23
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,290
Um, so anyways, so he goes, Nah,

24
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:44,070
the only place we can stick it is right
on the back of your fucking house where

25
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:46,920
it's going to be the ugliest
ever. And I'm like, well no,

26
00:01:46,921 --> 00:01:50,110
we're not putting it there. And he's
like, Claire worked for the government,

27
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,053
right?

28
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,290
So he goes to get out there
and his government issued
Ford escort station wagon

29
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,720
number, those fucking things. Um,

30
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,750
so I had to call the
guy up and he's got a,

31
00:02:03,751 --> 00:02:06,990
he's got to cut this fucking tree down.
And I know what you're thinking. Well,

32
00:02:06,991 --> 00:02:11,100
wait a minute. I thought you were fucking,
uh, oh, Billy tree hugger, you know,

33
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:15,210
or William Environment. A William
tell their right of the fucking guy.

34
00:02:15,211 --> 00:02:20,040
The guy who wrote about a lake
Winnipesaukee there. Walden Lake.

35
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:23,700
Who was that fucking boring cunt
that wrote all the poems. You know,

36
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,370
everybody was freaking out,

37
00:02:26,371 --> 00:02:29,490
all this shit he was saying he was
plagiarizing the native Americans.

38
00:02:29,491 --> 00:02:33,320
They already fucking knew. They already
knew it was a great lake. All right?

39
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:37,170
They have fucking a twinkle
toes with your stupid poems.

40
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:42,070
The date of Americans had it right the
way they will live and they lived off the

41
00:02:42,071 --> 00:02:46,180
fucking land. They didn't take more
than they need that they needed. Right.

42
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,440
And when you got sick,

43
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:51,640
some weird guy and you're fucking tribe
did a dance around you and then you died

44
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,690
and that was it. Okay. And
it kept the herd thinned out.

45
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:57,420
Okay.

46
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,000
No,
he came out there with some,

47
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:03,150
the skull of a fucking snake
or some shit on his head.

48
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:05,730
Okay.

49
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:09,690
Putting line dance into shame is what
this guy did. And then you fucking die.

50
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,850
That's, it was fucking over.
Hey, you had a great 30 years.

51
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,480
See Ya. Whatever. They deny its natural.
Geronimo, he lived for a while, didn't he?

52
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:26,030
He used to get the senior citizen discount
when he took the stage coach after a

53
00:03:26,031 --> 00:03:29,400
while, you know, wants to white man
took over. Isn't that what happened?

54
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,080
Okay.

55
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,560
Oh fuck that again on this subject.

56
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,833
Okay.

57
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:38,030
Oh yeah. Taking down the fucking tree.
So now I've got to take down this.

58
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,840
Just I could take down this fucking,
so basically I'm like, all right,

59
00:03:41,841 --> 00:03:45,890
so what if I take out the tree
that really shouldn't even be here,

60
00:03:45,891 --> 00:03:48,170
that provides shade in
an area that you know,

61
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,190
never had shade because it's actually a
fucking desert. And you know, by the way,

62
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,020
what are we all doing out here?

63
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:55,683
Huh?

64
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:58,910
We're all standing around
trying to get a fucking

65
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:04,390
goddamn guest star on the
reboot of fucking Tj Hooker.

66
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,680
Why are we out here as fucking place?
Just freaks me out.

67
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,840
Absolutely. Freaks me out. Um, anyways,

68
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,250
uh, so now I got, I got that. So
then whatever, so they got it,

69
00:04:18,251 --> 00:04:22,720
then they'll put the panel on and then
my electrical system will be complete.

70
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:27,250
I can actually turn lights on in my
house and not worry that somewhere in my

71
00:04:27,251 --> 00:04:30,880
house does a little flash of fire when
I throw a switch because that's what was

72
00:04:30,881 --> 00:04:34,790
going on. That was going on
while I had a minor gas leak.

73
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,080
It's fucking unreal.
I'm going to tell you right now,

74
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:44,470
whoever buys this house
after me is going to be,

75
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,600
they're not even going to realize the
Goddamn goldmine that they walked into

76
00:04:49,601 --> 00:04:52,450
cause all this shit that I'm doing,
it does not add value to my house.

77
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:57,370
This is all shit that should have been
done right to begin with. You know,

78
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,730
it's just when somebody, you
know, inspect your house,

79
00:05:00,731 --> 00:05:02,380
they can't look into the walls.

80
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:07,780
All they're looking for is the sweat
marks on the walls and the cracks and can

81
00:05:07,781 --> 00:05:11,920
you roll a marble across the floor, you
know, without even giving any effort.

82
00:05:11,921 --> 00:05:16,610
You know, they just looking at shit like
that. You know, he was getting home.

83
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,650
They go walk on your roof.

84
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:20,260
They go up there and they have a sandwich
and rubbed their balls for a couple of

85
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:24,550
seconds. It's probably could have
made and leafs and that's it.

86
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:28,480
What's it gonna get a bad recommendation?
I don't remember who it was.

87
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,660
You think I can find that guy's
business card to warn other people? Oh,

88
00:05:31,661 --> 00:05:35,530
by the way, this guy came back with
the little glint in his eye and said,

89
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:36,341
is the great,

90
00:05:36,341 --> 00:05:40,630
has you guys will be very happy and
gradually you get yourself a great house.

91
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:46,540
Um, anyways, so whoever comes in
next and then this is the thing,

92
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:51,400
they won't even appreciate it.
Just like the rich kids son,

93
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:52,923
you know,

94
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:57,980
the son of a guy who
fucking pulled himself up

95
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:02,900
by his bootstraps, you know,
gotten into insider trading.

96
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:09,000
You know, fucking bootleg some
booze across the fucking God damn.

97
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:13,710
Whatever the fuck it is. One of
those great lakes. I was like,

98
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:17,130
fuck fucking Greg.
Right?

99
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:22,680
Then he goes out and buy some palatial
estate. He gets himself a trophy wife.

100
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:27,650
He gets on top of her right, boom.

101
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:29,970
Nine months later,
here comes this fucking jerk off.

102
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,860
He's born with one of those fucking,
uh,

103
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:37,470
you call the other one little piece
of glass in your eye. Not a false,

104
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:42,270
a monocle. He doesn't get rattled.
He doesn't get a baby fucking bear.

105
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:45,030
They give them a Monica.
Let's how fucking rich this kid isn't.

106
00:06:45,031 --> 00:06:47,760
He actually has a little
fucking a pocket watch.

107
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,200
He's got a little pocket in his diaper.

108
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,480
That's how much money this
fucking kid is born into.

109
00:06:51,481 --> 00:06:54,960
And you think he gives a shit. He
sits around and he's bored, right?

110
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:56,280
Yeah.

111
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:00,090
Grabs a handful of Molly and
starts rubbing up against
the suit of armor in the

112
00:07:00,091 --> 00:07:02,190
fucking house. Right? That's
what the fuck he does.

113
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:06,600
You think he gives a shit
or even even fucking knows

114
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:12,580
that he's got state of the Ark,
state of the art fucking electricity

115
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:19,450
in, in, in copper piping going through
that fucking 9,000 square foot Cabana. No,

116
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:24,940
he doesn't cheat bill. You're kind of
making yourself out to be a martyr.

117
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:25,803
I am

118
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,580
anyways. Okay. It's fucking
shit. Seven in the morning.

119
00:07:32,581 --> 00:07:34,230
I'm already getting fucking text messages.

120
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:36,520
Yeah,

121
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:40,030
just never fuck it. Never fucking
ends. It never ends. So anyways,

122
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,730
so that's the latest thing was this,
this thing.

123
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:46,480
We got the hardwood floors in and a
couple of you guys said, you know,

124
00:07:46,481 --> 00:07:49,230
after you've been bitching about this
for so long, you have better sense.

125
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:53,230
You better put up some pictures. You
know what I say to you? Fuck you.

126
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:58,090
You're not seeing one goddamn picture my
downstairs I am painting a picture with

127
00:07:58,091 --> 00:08:00,610
the beautiful words of
this wonderful language.

128
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:04,120
Now I'm not showing you what the
inside of my house looks like.

129
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:05,500
Yeah,

130
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,620
you want me to upload what the inside
of my fucking house looks like?

131
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:10,900
So then what you guys can say,

132
00:08:10,901 --> 00:08:15,790
it looks like shit and that I got ripped
off and then I'm a fucking big headed

133
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,780
moron. You think? I don't understand
how you guys operate at this point.

134
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:23,950
I may have a Charlie Brown fucking head,

135
00:08:23,951 --> 00:08:26,620
but if you think I'm going to walk up
and try to kick that football again,

136
00:08:26,621 --> 00:08:29,680
you're out of your fucking
mind. All right? So anyways,

137
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,970
this is the Monday morning podcast.
Everybody, if you're new to it, welcome.

138
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:38,950
If you're from another country,
you stay put, you stay,

139
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:43,570
you stay right where you are. We
don't need you anymore. All right.

140
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,280
Okay.

141
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:49,420
We're doing just fine with the immigrants
that were abusing over here right now.

142
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:55,640
You sit the fuck down.
I don't even know what's going on.

143
00:08:55,641 --> 00:08:59,120
There's some sort of immigration thing
going on in the news and everybody's

144
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:01,730
fucking flapping their arms.
You're right.

145
00:09:01,731 --> 00:09:05,210
And the guys in the red ties are
going again. I'm the fuck Outta here.

146
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,740
And the guys in the blue ties or like,
you know,

147
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,690
I think everybody should have
a right to be here. Right?

148
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:16,490
Same Old fucking shit. I love when
they go like, well the immigrants,

149
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:20,180
you know, they do the jobs that
Americans don't want to do.

150
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:21,961
I love how that,

151
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:26,780
they always put it back on
like they always get it off.

152
00:09:26,781 --> 00:09:30,620
The rich guys like immigrants do the jobs.

153
00:09:30,621 --> 00:09:32,770
Americans don't want to do that.

154
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:37,900
That's such a fucking brilliant way of
saying that Americans don't want to be

155
00:09:38,121 --> 00:09:40,570
grossly underpaid for back,

156
00:09:40,571 --> 00:09:43,940
back breaking work that makes somebody
else's Zillion fucking dollars.

157
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,370
Do you think those immigrants
want to do those jobs?

158
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:50,800
And I love when they sit there and go over
this. They're happy. The fucking happy

159
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:55,520
bent over at the waist all
day picking jelly beans.

160
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,580
You want to fucking do that
out and candy land fields.

161
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:00,050
I don't think anybody wants to,

162
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,370
they're basically saying we can't get
away with sweatshop labor in this country

163
00:10:04,371 --> 00:10:09,120
anymore because of unions. All right.
And then they, but they spin it around.

164
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,690
They got the Americans
don't want to do this job.

165
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,860
You're telling me you can find an American
to go out and go pick some fucking

166
00:10:15,861 --> 00:10:16,970
apples if you paid them right?

167
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:19,823
Huh?

168
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,820
We'll fuck would want to go on and go
pick some apples. You get that bag right?

169
00:10:23,821 --> 00:10:27,780
You're walking around out in the fucking
air. Nobody breathing down your neck.

170
00:10:27,781 --> 00:10:30,180
You just up there picking
apples like Johnny Appleseed.

171
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:34,990
I'd love to be a fucking
apple picker if you paid me,

172
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:39,010
you know you want to give me 30 sets of
fucking month ago. Pick apples. Yeah,

173
00:10:39,011 --> 00:10:42,350
go fuck yourself. You pick the fucking
apples. You'll see that that Elena,

174
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,740
they're there and have a work ethic

175
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,890
you just crushed anyways.

176
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:50,590
Okay.

177
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:53,790
Gotta go find some guy that used to sleep
on a rock under a fucking waterfall to

178
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:58,080
do that God damn job because she
did. Some guy walked here, you know,

179
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,700
from Zimbabwe,

180
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:07,570
grab herself a piece of fucking oak or
whatever. Some light p pine or some shit.

181
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,210
Right. Doggy paddled his whole
fucking way over here. Yeah.

182
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,850
You think he's scared of picking some
apples for no money doesn't give a fuck.

183
00:11:12,851 --> 00:11:17,440
He's happy to be back on the land.
You got to go to that fucking guy,

184
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:22,860
that level of struggle in life
to find somebody to go out to go,

185
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:27,400
you know, roll the cantaloupes
in after the fucking harvest.

186
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,560
Right.
Why?

187
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:32,740
Because we don't want to do it because
we won't fucking work for a dollar a

188
00:11:32,741 --> 00:11:36,160
month. You rich cunt. Oh,

189
00:11:36,161 --> 00:11:40,600
I'm on a fucking tear this
morning. Unbelievable. Um,

190
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:44,920
so anyways,
so that putting the tile in the bathroom,

191
00:11:44,921 --> 00:11:47,350
we're getting down to it right now. We're
getting down and I, and this is what I,

192
00:11:47,351 --> 00:11:51,610
this is what I've learned from this
fucking job. This is what you do.

193
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:53,580
If you ever get any
work done in your house,

194
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:58,890
have the whole fucking thing designed
okay?

195
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:03,740
Before you know you wet,
you have them even fucking removed.

196
00:12:03,741 --> 00:12:07,080
The first piece of fucking whatever
you have the whole thing designed.

197
00:12:07,081 --> 00:12:12,081
You have everything that you want put in
there and you already have that fucking

198
00:12:12,151 --> 00:12:13,200
thing priced out.

199
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:17,700
Then you order all the shit
before they even start.

200
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:21,390
You order all the fucking shit that you
want put back. He put in a new kitchen,

201
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:25,320
you order all of the shit
that you want put back in,

202
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,600
and you'd stick it in your fucking garage,

203
00:12:27,601 --> 00:12:31,350
and then you fucking take out a stop
watch and you go, all right, guys, go,

204
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,080
and that's it.
Then you stay on top of them.

205
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,370
You never fucking stop me actually in
the estimate to you include the shit that

206
00:12:38,371 --> 00:12:41,520
they're gonna put in afterwards because
he's fucking assholes. If you go, yeah.

207
00:12:41,521 --> 00:12:42,870
What's the estimate to, yeah. You know,

208
00:12:42,871 --> 00:12:46,610
to get a new kitchen put in on
the Gwalia 10 grand, you know,

209
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:51,460
10 grand is for them to disassemble
the shit you have. You know,

210
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,860
forget about all the bullshit they're
gonna find in the walls. Will,

211
00:12:53,861 --> 00:12:54,694
you'll only a little

212
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:59,280
of bro Lou Lu,
the slew of WHO's looked up to code this,

213
00:12:59,281 --> 00:13:01,530
These v three go to the
vintage of the Zulu,

214
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:05,900
Google, all that fucking shits common.
And then on top of all of that,

215
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,110
they're going to add the
price for all of them.

216
00:13:09,111 --> 00:13:12,440
Imply answers and all the counters,
all the countertops and all that.

217
00:13:12,441 --> 00:13:14,720
And you'd be like, wait a minute,
this wasn't in the estimate

218
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:18,330
and they're going to be like, uh, no.

219
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,300
You know what you feel
like when you're doing,

220
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:25,320
it's like the blues brothers when they
thought the beer was free. Yeah, like a,

221
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:27,420
he didn't look good.
Charges fill the first one.

222
00:13:27,421 --> 00:13:32,230
So why we thought they
were like a break a half?

223
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:36,720
Nah, Nah. That's what you're
contracted does. All right.

224
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:40,830
There's no difference between buying a
car and having some fucking asshole work

225
00:13:40,831 --> 00:13:44,310
on your house. You have no idea
what the price is. You know,

226
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:47,490
like when you go down to buy a car,
which you want to get from those cons,

227
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,990
is the out the door price out the door?
What is this costing me?

228
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:53,990
They'll fucking act like you knock in the,
ah,

229
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:58,410
take a grand off and then charge you 1500
bucks for the fucking, uh, Russ. Perfect.

230
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:01,500
You know,
I don't know.

231
00:14:01,501 --> 00:14:04,680
This is just the ramblings of
someone born without pigment. Okay.

232
00:14:04,681 --> 00:14:07,200

shit? Uh, all right, let's,

What better way to show your dad that
you love them then to upgrade his grill?

273
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:34,090
You know when you're a married man,
what do you have? You have your garage,

274
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:38,260
you have your grill and you
have your boots, that's it.

275
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:42,910
And you'll walk out in the living
room and you sit down eating a burger,

276
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:47,890
the dust on you from the garage, and
you suck down a fucking whiskey, right?

277
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:51,850
And you're looking at your wife
and you see your mouth moving,

278
00:16:51,851 --> 00:16:56,851
but you know fucking hearing
because you're enjoying

00:17:11,971 --> 00:17:12,181

00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,760
All right, let's, let's, let's get back
into the podcast here. Um, all right.

312
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:53,923
So

313
00:18:55,190 --> 00:19:00,190
last night I had Paul
Versey on speakerphone and
I had Jason lie ahead in my

314
00:19:00,201 --> 00:19:04,490
living room and we had a couple of pops.
Paul was driving home or whatever,

315
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:09,590
and uh, we had this epic
fucking argument. Um,

316
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,580
it all started off with that guy in the
giants making that unbelievable catch,

317
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:18,380
which immediately everybody started
saying was the greatest catch of all time,

318
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:23,270
greatest catch of all time.
And of course Paul Versey,

319
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:28,100
there's nothing Paul likes better than
saying that something is the greatest of

320
00:19:28,101 --> 00:19:31,220
all time. And I'm just like
Paul, that's without a doubt.

321
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,810
It's got to be top two or three.

322
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:37,820
And I'm saying that out of respect for
the fact that I know I haven't seen every

323
00:19:37,821 --> 00:19:40,760
great fucking catch.
Okay.

324
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:46,550
In Nfl fucking history.
I know I have it just out of respect,

325
00:19:46,551 --> 00:19:51,260
but I know God damn well. I'm trying to
think of a better one that I ever saw. No,

326
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:55,530
I don't think I can think of one.
This bigger catches catches that happen,

327
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:58,640
the Superbowl, but just as far as degree
of difficulty, without a doubt, that's,

328
00:19:58,641 --> 00:19:59,474
I mean, I, I

329
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:04,480
wouldn't think that you could maybe find
one or two better than that. All right.

330
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:08,770
But I do remember back in the day when I
used to watch a Boston college and this

331
00:20:08,771 --> 00:20:12,430
kid with a mesh half shirt was
fucking running full speed,

332
00:20:12,431 --> 00:20:16,390
jumped up in the air and with one hand
just fucking reached back in behind his

333
00:20:16,391 --> 00:20:21,040
head and fucking just snag this
ball out like a fucking eagle.

334
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:25,250
BC, Eagle. Yeah. There you
go. Just snatched it out.
Right. And when I, you know,

335
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,240
was trying to find that catch on
the Internet, I couldn't find it.

336
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:31,780
So this is what verse he says he goes to.
He's like,

337
00:20:31,781 --> 00:20:35,080
Chris Carter just said it's the greatest
catch of all time. It's like Paul,

338
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,730
that's his fucking job.

339
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,440
Okay.

340
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,940
Oh Hey.
It's his fucking job.

341
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:45,090
Espns job is to tell you every fucking
night that what you saw or what you're

342
00:20:45,191 --> 00:20:48,030
about to see is the greatest fucking
thing you're ever going to see.

343
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,980
Cause that's how they
get their whore money.

344
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:54,090
That's how they can afford to go
out there and get the corvette.

345
00:20:54,091 --> 00:20:58,020
Z O six with the fucking,
uh, look at me over here.

346
00:20:58,021 --> 00:20:59,910
Fucking racing package.

347
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:01,510
Yeah.

348
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:05,210
Message. I know Chris Card is a
fucking hall of fame wide receiver,

349
00:21:05,211 --> 00:21:09,620
but I mean come on the second you get on
TV, you got to start flapping your arms.

350
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,560
Okay. If they don't hear you, your,

351
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:14,420
you're fucking sport coat
bumping up against you, Mike.

352
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,210
They're not going to give
you your paycheck. All right.

353
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,860
Look what happened to herm Edwards.

354
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:23,420
Herm Edwards was a respectable human
being when he played football and he

355
00:21:23,421 --> 00:21:26,750
coached football. Then he got on TV.
I don't know what happened to the guy.

356
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:30,830
That guy should have a red fucking
nose on one of those horns out. Oh God.

357
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,300
Every time he fucking said something,

358
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,890
I don't even know if
he's still on the show.

359
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,650
Okay.

360
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:40,100
I don't know if it was TV or he just
snapped her in that one loss where he,

361
00:21:40,101 --> 00:21:44,210
you know, you play to win the
games. If he just fucking,

362
00:21:44,211 --> 00:21:49,211
something in his head just snapped because
he goes on ESPN and he talks real low

363
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:51,440
like this when he's setting up his point.

364
00:21:51,441 --> 00:21:54,920
And then when he goes to make his point
that he started fucking screaming, right?

365
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:56,670
Yeah.

366
00:21:56,670 --> 00:22:01,550
Starts doing the curly
shuffle, right. Wise Guy. Um,

367
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:02,643
so anyways,

368
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:04,250
okay.

369
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:08,350
Anyways, so first he goes, dude, I
just googled greatest catches ever.

370
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:09,710
Yeah,

371
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:14,400
it goes, it's a joke to say that
Lynn Swann catching the Superbowl.

372
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:17,160
It's almost insulting.
I love that. He just,

373
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:22,110
he calls on the Internet. He doesn't even
Google greatest one handed catch him.

374
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:24,120
He just,
Google's greatest catch ever.

375
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:29,240
And then he sits down and watches
some dentists youtube video.

376
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:32,700
This guy, right? This fucking guy.

377
00:22:32,701 --> 00:22:36,930
He just puts this together and then
that's it. That's, there you go.

378
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:42,500
That's how I know some guy
who works on ESPN shed.

379
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,530
It's the greatest one ever.

380
00:22:43,531 --> 00:22:46,680
And then I watched some fucking random
guy's youtube video and there you go.

381
00:22:46,681 --> 00:22:49,130
That's it. It's done. Come on guys.

382
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:52,320
This is what I would love it to be the
greatest fucking catch of all time.

383
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,580
All right.
But I got to tell you,

384
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:58,410
he only did it last night and
according to my research, okay,

385
00:22:58,490 --> 00:22:59,970
in a 12 hour period,

386
00:22:59,971 --> 00:23:03,300
you cannot watch every great
fucking catch of all fucking time,

387
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,420
professional and college
level in all of that shit.

388
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,620
But I will tell you that that
was definitely, I mean there,

389
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:14,670
there's no way that you could find two
catches better than that. I will say that,

390
00:23:14,671 --> 00:23:18,960
but I'm going to stop short of
Paul Versey slash Tony Kornheiser,

391
00:23:18,961 --> 00:23:22,980
which I'll never forget in September of
2007 watching the New England patriots

392
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,260
is just the greatest team ever. And
then they end up losing the super bowl.

393
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:29,130
It's like,
you know,

394
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:34,800
you know what's his real travesty is that
Tony Kornheiser doesn't wear a fucking

395
00:23:34,801 --> 00:23:38,400
toupee that's barely on his head.
You know what I mean?

396
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:42,030
Then you could actually see how over
the top half the shit the guys like that

397
00:23:42,031 --> 00:23:42,560
say,

398
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:46,350
cause every time they snap their head
would go flying on the and it would remind

399
00:23:46,351 --> 00:23:48,270
you to take it with a grain of salt.

400
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:51,300
That for as much as Tony
Kornheiser knows what he's saying.

401
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:54,910
He's standing in the middle of a three
ring circus going ladies and gentlemen,

402
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:59,660
boys and girls,
children of all ages.

403
00:23:59,661 --> 00:24:02,680
This is look great.
Isn't bad mitten championship deals.

404
00:24:02,681 --> 00:24:04,650
Wheel does have a fucking child.
Um,

405
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:08,330
so we went from that to then on,

406
00:24:08,331 --> 00:24:12,230
I fucking phone is blowing
up here. Oh, conference call,

407
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:17,750
conference call. I don't do conference
calls when they have a conference call.

408
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,490
No,
and neither do you,

409
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:22,220
none of us want to be on this
fucking phone call right now.

410
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:26,840
Can somebody just say the thing that
needs to be said so we can all hang up?

411
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,671
Can I tell you something?

412
00:24:28,671 --> 00:24:32,290
One of the greatest things about
doing what I do for a living is, uh,

413
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:36,770
I don't have to have,
you know, there's no, um,

414
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:41,630
like meetings. I don't want to tread on
some shit that I did. Oh, by the way,

415
00:24:41,631 --> 00:24:43,430
I forgot to mention last week my,
uh,

416
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:48,500
comedians in cars getting
coffee aired last week. And, um,

417
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:55,010
you know, I was actually talking
to Mr Seinfeld, by the way.

418
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:58,370
That was one of the most surreal fucking
things I've ever done to be sitting

419
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:03,110
there with him. The king, um,
nobody did this business better.

420
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:08,450
Why? I can't say flip Wilson
did it. Johnny Carson did
it. Will you just go out?

421
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:12,740
You hit him, you hit him hard, you get
your money, and then you walk away.

422
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,180
All right? And as they're talking
on your shirt going, hey, hey,

423
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:19,220
you want to try to make a comeback?

424
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,280
Do you want to try to do something
else so we can just cancel it?

425
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:27,470
You don't want to put a little fucking
black stain up against your name.

426
00:25:27,471 --> 00:25:32,210
And they just go, no, you know what?
I'm good. You, you, you enjoy yourself,

427
00:25:32,211 --> 00:25:34,700
Hollywood. I'll see you later.
Flip Wilson did that flip.

428
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:37,490
Wilson had his fucking show.
He was smart with his money.

429
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:42,200
He invested his shit and when the
show was done, he's like, I'm out.

430
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:46,820
See you later. Go Fuck
Yourself. If you need me,

431
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,830
I'll be at home rubbing my balls,

432
00:25:48,831 --> 00:25:52,100
watching the game for the rest
of my fucking life. Right?

433
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:55,760
Johnny Carson, he did. He
ended up owning the show.

434
00:25:55,761 --> 00:26:00,200
He had his own fucking clothing line. You
know, long before all those rappers did,

435
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:04,220
okay? They're all ripping off Johnny
Carson, Johnny Carson collection,

436
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:08,630
some of the greatest plaid three piece
suits you ever saw in your fucking life

437
00:26:08,631 --> 00:26:12,650
on it. You can laugh at them,
you can laugh at it, but you
laugh at them, all right?

438
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,770
You're saying you don't like
anchorman if you don't like anchorman,

439
00:26:15,771 --> 00:26:18,950
you know what an American and according
to some of the people I've seen

440
00:26:18,951 --> 00:26:21,680
screaming on TV, that means you need
to get the fuck out of this country.

441
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:28,920
How dumb is that? Countries? You know,

442
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:33,240
why can't we all just be happy?
We're not in the water, right?

443
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:37,470
Can everybody just fucking relax? Okay, I
get shoes. She gets sandals. How are you?

444
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:41,010
How's it going? Great. You know, I don't
know what that thing is on your head,

445
00:26:41,011 --> 00:26:45,240
but you know, you seem to enjoy it. You
want to come home and have some dinner?

446
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,550
Why? Why can't? Why can't
you just fucking do that?

447
00:26:47,551 --> 00:26:50,040
Why does it always have to be
screaming and fucking yelling?

448
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:54,000
Goddamn Isis Horse Shit.
I swear to fucking Christ.

449
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:59,400
I would love to see them try to
fucking defeat Florida. You know,

450
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:02,880
sitting there acting like
they were a god damn problem.

451
00:27:02,881 --> 00:27:06,600
Holy Shit is fucking 30,000 people on
the other side of the planet that don't

452
00:27:06,601 --> 00:27:08,700
like us. Well thank God we're
on this side of the planet.

453
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,080
I know we just stay over here and figure
out how to make our cars run on Legos

454
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:16,170
and then what are they gonna be mad
at that they got nobody to shoot it?

455
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:21,590
Fuck them. Okay. You know
what it is about America.

456
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:23,420
We'd like back in the day,

457
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:28,630
like one of those big fucking ANR guys
that could actually take a band out of a,

458
00:27:28,631 --> 00:27:32,200
pluck them out of obscurity
and give them a hit record.

459
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:34,270
That's what America does
with our foreign policy.

460
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:37,900
No one would ever have heard
of isis if it wasn't for us.

461
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:43,390
If our a and R guys didn't go over there
and pluck them out of fucking obscurity,

462
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:45,010
they'd just be over there,
you know?

463
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:48,550
No one would even know they'd
be like a garage band, you know,

464
00:27:48,551 --> 00:27:53,080
blowing up shit over there. Didn't know
what would even fucking about. All right,

465
00:27:53,081 --> 00:27:56,620
why don't we walk away, tear up their
contract and just fucking come on.

466
00:27:56,621 --> 00:27:59,850
Why don't we just come home? Can
we just do, hey everybody corner.

467
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:03,550
Let's just come up enough already. You're
not going to solve anything over there.

468
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,280
All right. But we want the stuff in
the grout. I mean, sorry, we're trying.

469
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:14,510
Trying to give them freedom.
That's right. Come on,

470
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:19,180
grow up. Okay. But just come on.
Okay, we have beaches over here.

471
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:23,600
What are you doing up? We've
got an oil here. Um, anyways,

472
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,920
that was my version of what we
should do with their foreign policy.

473
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:30,880
Having not read a God damn thing about it.
As far as I know,

474
00:28:30,881 --> 00:28:35,440
isis was some sexy,
broadened the seventies you know,

475
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:40,000
who was a rival to a wonder woman.
You know,

476
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:44,560
cause everybody knows good looking
bitches don't get along. And the only way,

477
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:48,160
the only way to good looking women get
along is it's so they can hate on other

478
00:28:48,161 --> 00:28:50,660
good looking women and just sit there,
you know,

479
00:28:50,661 --> 00:28:54,700
at the faces all fucking scrunched
up. Hey, why does your face age?

480
00:28:54,701 --> 00:28:57,970
But the rest of your body doesn't
or why does your face age faster?

481
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:00,880
You know that like you have a sheet,

482
00:29:00,881 --> 00:29:04,090
like an old strip or the fucking bodies
are gorgeous and then their face,

483
00:29:04,091 --> 00:29:05,410
she's like, wow man, look at that body.

484
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:08,230
That body looks 26 and you look
at their face, ah, she's 42,

485
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:11,440
Amit for instance.
You know what I mean?

486
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:17,170
Like if you guys saw me completely
fucking naked, if be like, wow, man,

487
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:21,250
I bet that guy's like 31 and then you
see my face. She's like, Holy Shit,

488
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,560
let's pick out a plot. I'm sorry.
You know what? I'm not sorry.

489
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:30,950
You deserve that. You deserve to
picture me naked. Um, so anyway,

490
00:29:30,951 --> 00:29:35,951
so we ended up having this fucking
ridiculous fucking argument where,

491
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:37,403
uh,

492
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:43,350
Paul Versey of course was saying Babe
Ruth was the greatest baseball player of

493
00:29:43,791 --> 00:29:47,390
all time.
And then he said all the usual shit.

494
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:52,040
He basically repeated shit that he heard
on TV that he played at the dead ball

495
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:56,810
era. Right. And a law head was also
trying to tell me, you know, yeah.

496
00:29:56,811 --> 00:29:58,340
He, and I was just saying, listen,

497
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:00,680
I'm not saying he's not one of
the great players of all time,

498
00:30:00,681 --> 00:30:04,070
but he's not the greatest of all
fucking time for the simple fact,

499
00:30:04,071 --> 00:30:06,470
he didn't play against the greatest.
All right.

500
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,950
He played in a segregated
league with the Pedro Martinez.

501
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:13,480
The Mariano Rivera is okay.
The Josh Gibson,

502
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,230
they weren't allowed
in the fucking league.

503
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,490
He didn't have to compete
against Reggie Jackson.

504
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,230
He didn't have to compete against these
guys. They weren't allowed in the league.

505
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:25,490
He was playing and basically
a softball league. Okay.

506
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,450
With the top third would, I
would say, would make, you know,

507
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:33,510
would make the major league baseball
nowadays. Okay. But I get it.

508
00:30:33,511 --> 00:30:35,810
You gotta think like two thirds of
it wouldn't even fucking Ben there.

509
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:39,350
Then they tried to do that shit.
Well, Bill, who was only 10 teams,

510
00:30:39,351 --> 00:30:40,730
there's dirty teeth now.
Yeah.

511
00:30:40,731 --> 00:30:43,400
There was all solely fucking 2
billion people on the planet.

512
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,510
Now there's 7 billion.

513
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:45,700
Yeah.

514
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,700
All right, so I'll, I'll,

515
00:30:46,701 --> 00:30:50,180
I'll knock off like I'll get my next
to 10% on his fucking numbers then.

516
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:51,970
Okay.

517
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:54,430
Like give me a fucking
break all you gotta do.

518
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:56,320
Okay.

519
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,860
Do he play baseball when
people die to tuberculosis?

520
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:04,900
He played baseball like there
was a hit song, but at the

521
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,720
[inaudible] and that song was written in
the 1890s and everybody thought it was

522
00:31:11,751 --> 00:31:16,340
too fucking crazy. What is
this devil music? God dammit.

523
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:20,360
She, what happens when you let them
off the plantation? They get a piano.

524
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:22,810
They couldn't even handle it.
Bought up

525
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:28,940
[inaudible] he played baseball.
That was a hit.

526
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:31,740
Baba Du,
Du,

527
00:31:31,741 --> 00:31:36,680
du Du du De de de de Beauvoir
devil by de Boop, boop,

528
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:38,530
boop, boop, boop, boop, boop. You know,

529
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:42,550
people would just hear it and then sit
around wondering when they were ever

530
00:31:42,551 --> 00:31:45,960
going to hear it again because they had
no device to play it on. Yeah. That idea,

531
00:31:45,961 --> 00:31:47,890
that double Babu,
right?

532
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,520
That guy came to town and everybody
stood around him and I played,

533
00:31:51,521 --> 00:31:52,510
played a fucking piano.

534
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,350
You see how they worked out back
then? Head, shoulders, knees and toes,

535
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:04,000
knees and toes. Head, shoulders, knees and
toes. Knees and toes. And only white guys.

536
00:32:04,001 --> 00:32:07,780
No plaques. I Puerto Ricans, head,
shoulders, knees and toes. These are jobs.

537
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:09,610
Yeah.

538
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:14,610
The big dumb fucking gloves that
looked like little people hands.

539
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:17,180
Give me a fucking break.

540
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:18,980
Okay.

541
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:22,250
Not to mention Babe Ruth. I mean they
built a stadium towards his strength.

542
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:27,170
That right field fence. Okay. You could,

543
00:32:27,171 --> 00:32:28,580
you could make a cop show.

544
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:29,900
Yeah,

545
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:34,900
with two toddlers and they could do the
classic scene with a fucking cop chases

546
00:32:35,271 --> 00:32:38,660
the perp down the alley and he gets to
the chain link fence and fucking jumps

547
00:32:38,661 --> 00:32:40,680
over it. You could, you could
film that with two toddlers,

548
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:43,800
with the right field fence in Yankee
stadium. The House that Ruth built.

549
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:47,460
All right?
He backed up to catch a fly ball.

550
00:32:47,461 --> 00:32:51,690
It hits you like mid thigh and you
fell into some guy's lap, right?

551
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:57,990
So anyway, give me a fucking break. All
right. From 1930 on, I'll give it to you.

552
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:01,380
All right? But if you played in
the teams, he played in the arts,

553
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:05,340
he played in the 18 hundreds and even
into the twenties go fuck yourself.

554
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:10,820
All right. And I feel like
every look, every like, um,

555
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:16,500
major sport has their three stooges era
where one team won a bunch of fucking

556
00:33:16,501 --> 00:33:20,610
championships. All right. I love the
Boston Celtics, but gimme a break.

557
00:33:20,611 --> 00:33:23,100
You look at them in the 1960s.
I mean,

558
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:27,120
it looks like it looks like a game
being played at the y, you know,

559
00:33:27,121 --> 00:33:30,680
some Christian rec league.
All right?

560
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:33,780
The fucking Canadians won a bunch
of Stanley cups when, you know,

561
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:38,690
you had first dibs on any guy within
a 300 mile fucking radius and it's 16

562
00:33:38,691 --> 00:33:39,524
fucking league.

563
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,850
They had first dibs on anybody
in French speaking Quebec.

564
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:49,460
And we had, you know, we had first pick
had like the best guy from Vermont. Gee,

565
00:33:49,461 --> 00:33:53,390
did you go on a run? It's
fucking ridiculous. Okay.

566
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:57,260
And then the Green Bay packers who were
actually the fucking Yankees of football,

567
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:01,970
you know, they, you know, they were,
when entitles when the Canton bulldogs,

568
00:34:01,971 --> 00:34:05,860
we're still in the fucking leg. All
right. Hey Man, give me, come on. Right?

569
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:11,250
Football was like a genie. I think they
played with a pumpkin back then. I mean,

570
00:34:11,251 --> 00:34:15,630
give me a fucking break. All those little
star, the house during the blah, blah,

571
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:17,640
the only ones that I will then I will,

572
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:22,680
I will recognize the championships
without a grain of salt. I would say,

573
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:23,060
uh,

574
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:27,540
any of the New York Yankees from like
the 1930 [inaudible] for the simple fact

575
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:32,130
they went babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig,
Joe Dimaggio and Mickey Mantle.

576
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:35,010
That's just, nobody's, nobody's
ever going to do that again.

577
00:34:35,011 --> 00:34:38,530
You're not going to get the Jordan of
your error four times in a fucking roll.

578
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:42,390
All right? You're just not going
to do it. So without a doubt,

579
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,640
I respect all of that type of shit.
But you know,

580
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:49,140
at the inception of these
fucking leaks when crazy legs,

581
00:34:49,141 --> 00:34:53,370
Johnson runs around googly eyes fucking
Ulysses and could give me a fucking

582
00:34:53,371 --> 00:34:56,760
break. Okay. He played
in the deadbolt every,

583
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,550
you don't understand
this guy had more devils

584
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:04,200
who was on the mound?
My great grandfather

585
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:09,420
got out of the bowl fan. Oh, freckles.

586
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:15,780
The Bay was that the song they played
when he came in said or enter Sandman.

587
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,410
They weren't facing cut
fast balls back then.

588
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:22,800
I'm sure there was guys
throwing 90 a hundred miles
a fucking hour, but just the,

589
00:35:22,801 --> 00:35:26,100
the amount of bumps that were in that
fucking league back then. I don't even,

590
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:26,943
I didn't want to hear it.

591
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:28,893
Okay.

592
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,220
There's a guy in the hall of fame.
Oh,

593
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:34,190
for good luck in baseball.

594
00:35:34,191 --> 00:35:37,250
He kept us section of rope
that was used in an actual,

595
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:39,311
okay,

596
00:35:39,311 --> 00:35:42,280
this is how long ago these fucking people
played and you're going to sit there

597
00:35:42,281 --> 00:35:47,220
and act like in the inception of
these fucking leagues. You know,

598
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:51,500
I'm looking at, obviously in every era
there, there was a Jordan. All right.

599
00:35:51,501 --> 00:35:53,150
But just like the
techniques and everything,

600
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,920
some of the records
that were set back then,

601
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:58,370
they didn't have a fucking heavyweight
fight. It would go on for like a day.

602
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:03,120
They'd have like a fucking,
you know, a 90 round fight.

603
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:08,630
Okay. Now listen, you're getting
punched in the fucking head,

604
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:13,830
but what kind of technique are you using?
Phil?

605
00:36:13,831 --> 00:36:17,190
Did bare knuckle fucking the people
bubble God go, fuck. I want to hear it.

606
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,080
I don't want to hear it.
All right.

607
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:24,550
The competition now is so
much more insane that I,

608
00:36:24,551 --> 00:36:27,650
I just think it would immediately any,

609
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:29,570
but I guess they would
compete at the same level.

610
00:36:29,571 --> 00:36:33,530
But like just the fact that it's now
everybody gets to compete and not to

611
00:36:33,531 --> 00:36:35,750
mention like, I mean you could
get fucking fathers out there.

612
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:40,680
I try and they try and teach their kid how
to throw a curve ball to get, you know,

613
00:36:40,681 --> 00:36:45,210
get the family out of the trailer park
when the kids like six years old stunting

614
00:36:45,211 --> 00:36:47,880
the growth of, of one of
his fucking arms, you know,

615
00:36:47,881 --> 00:36:50,520
cause they live in a fucking trailer
and somebody got a growth on their face

616
00:36:50,521 --> 00:36:53,580
that they want to have a year
they want to removed than others.

617
00:36:53,581 --> 00:36:54,750
Kids go on out there.
You know,

618
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:59,100
back in the day you went out and you
played catch with you little kid.

619
00:36:59,101 --> 00:37:02,280
Now you go out there and you from day one
you try to teach them how to switch it.

620
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:07,310
It's insane. All right, so
whatever. I'm just saying,

621
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:11,660
so whatever you guys think,
Babe Ruth is the greatest baseball player.

622
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:17,050
It's so hard to say because all you
can go by is this guy's fucking stats.

623
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,160
Yeah.

624
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,660
Who you played back,
you know,

625
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:25,870
there was probably a guy better than
fucking babe Ruth, but he got polio.

626
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:29,770
You know what I mean? I have, it's
just all right. I'm done. I'm done.

627
00:37:29,771 --> 00:37:33,850
Fucking murderer in here. All
right, let's move on here. Uh Oh,

628
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:36,130
he's just see the bills and
jets game was snowed out.

629
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,190
I love when they had those
big snow storms, right?

630
00:37:39,191 --> 00:37:43,340
And then everybody goes global warming.
Um,

631
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:49,530
and I got a buddy of mine for a shot
who was actually on a Conan O'brien last

632
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:53,890
week. He didn't let me know. You
know, cause like most funny people,

633
00:37:53,891 --> 00:37:58,120
he's fucking humble. Okay. And
didn't even fucking tell me, but, uh,

634
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:01,450
he actually told me that that
is a symptom of global warming.

635
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,720
And I'm going to pause here for everybody.
You know,

636
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:10,560
who doesn't think that 7 billion people
pouring nuclear waste into rivers has

637
00:38:10,571 --> 00:38:14,590
any sort of an effect on the planet,
you know, but a bunch of deer do.

638
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:20,400
We're gonna eat all fucking Troy's. We've
got to get them all here, ma'am. Well,

639
00:38:20,401 --> 00:38:22,820
what about us?
What he might,

640
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:27,910
we're fine dares having effect
deers having an effect on,

641
00:38:28,381 --> 00:38:29,430
on the environment.

642
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:34,530
You know them things that don't
drive cars or pollute lakes year,

643
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,940
but 7 billion people

644
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:44,190
who actually us here who actually put a
hole in the fucking ozone layer spraying

645
00:38:44,191 --> 00:38:48,430
and Pam into skillets, so are
all much. Don't stick to them.

646
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:53,440
We do not have any sort of
effect on the planet whatsoever.

647
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:58,090
Um, this, I mean, I don't
know shit about this,

648
00:38:58,091 --> 00:39:00,090
but people are actually
saying that that is, uh,

649
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:05,160
these giant snow storms or actually a
direct effect of the warming of the globe.

650
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,620
Now, whether we do it or not, here
we go. This is what this person says.

651
00:39:08,621 --> 00:39:11,950
This storms that buried Buffalo New
York area and more than seven feet,

652
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:16,420
2.1 meters. If you're from another
country [inaudible] of snow this week,

653
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:21,490
shafted records and shock the residents
even or even in a region accustom,

654
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:25,720
uh, to dealing with heavy
snow. The storms are certain,

655
00:39:25,721 --> 00:39:28,000
provide new fodder for climate change.

656
00:39:28,001 --> 00:39:31,750
Skeptics who seem to embrace every
monster blizzard as evidence that global

657
00:39:31,751 --> 00:39:32,890
warming doesn't exist.

658
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:37,690
And yet the science behind
these catastrophic storm
suggest that they do not

659
00:39:37,691 --> 00:39:41,050
occurred despite global warming,
but in fact because of it.

660
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:46,220
And He sends a link to
the u s India Summit, uh,

661
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,480
bring historic climate
action question mark.

662
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,510
Now I know this person wants it
to be true, so I understand that.

663
00:39:52,511 --> 00:39:54,400
I'm only reading one side of the argument,
but this is,

664
00:39:54,401 --> 00:39:55,690
this is actually interesting to me.

665
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:58,630
A part of what gave us
the record lake effect.

666
00:39:58,631 --> 00:40:02,890
Snow fall in buffalo was warm late
fall lake surface temperature.

667
00:40:02,891 --> 00:40:07,300
That combined with something
highly unusual, a five sigma event,

668
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:11,290
Oh shit. The Lek clears it up.
The hell does that mean, uh,

669
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,810
that is a very likely events on the,

670
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:18,580
on the order of one in a million
or more remarkable persistent,

671
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:23,470
what's with all the big words, dude,
anomalous configuration of the jet stream,

672
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,880
which brought frigid, frigid Arctic
air down into the United States.

673
00:40:27,881 --> 00:40:29,140
So early in the season,

674
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:35,410
the cold winds traveling over the warm
moisture laden lake created a perfect

675
00:40:35,621 --> 00:40:40,360
storm of conditions for record.
Uh, for record lake effect snow.

676
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:46,500
I think basically what they say is warm
air can hold more moisture because the

677
00:40:46,661 --> 00:40:51,140
air molecules are more
spread out in their logic.

678
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,790
Right. And then that
for what? I don't know,

679
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:57,640
they don't explain why the fucking
jet stream got pushed down,

680
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:02,830
bringing the so whatever. So frigid
air hit this unbelievably warm air.

681
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:07,000
All right. And then what does
that do ladies and gentlemen,

682
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:12,030
we all know that cold air is high pressure
air and high pressure wants to go to

683
00:41:13,601 --> 00:41:16,360
low pressure and then what does it do?

684
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:21,520
It fucking goes slams into
it and sends all that warm,

685
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:25,990
moist air right up into the fucking sky.
Right?

686
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:29,520
Then it hits the dewpoint.
What's the dewpoint boys and girls to do?

687
00:41:29,521 --> 00:41:33,920
Point is the point at which one water,
when moisture in the air becomes visible,

688
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:38,600
also known as the cloud and it looks
all mcbrown with more known as fob.

689
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:42,320
Yeah. So then what happens
is as that air moves up,

690
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,360
it starts to cool.

691
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:49,310
So the air molecules start to shrink and
then you reach the saturation point and

692
00:41:49,311 --> 00:41:53,330
then the fucking water drops. And then
what? That Arctic air underneath it.

693
00:41:53,331 --> 00:41:58,090
It fucking snows like a motherfucker.
All right. Now what happens there?

694
00:41:58,091 --> 00:42:00,880
I don't understand how the, how the
fucking do whatever. Yeah, just it's,

695
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:03,250
it's interesting. Whatever. If
I'll have the link up there,

696
00:42:03,251 --> 00:42:07,750
if you guys can translate it for
me, I'd appreciate it. There you go.

697
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:12,760
That was bill Nye the science, not the
science guy. I got some of it right.

698
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:15,880
You gotta be impressed with the high
pressure, low pressure shit, weren't ya?

699
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:21,670
We'll go fuck yourself. What are you
impressed by her, your own bulls. Um,

700
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:26,470
someone who's, what else do I have
to do here? Let me what, I mean,

701
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:29,190
what else do I have to do for you?
People, you know what I'm going to do?

702
00:42:29,191 --> 00:42:31,920
I'm going to read the last two were
advertising this week. You know,

703
00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:36,330
and if you actually paid to advertise
on here and you don't like my reads,

704
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,400
my reads are fucking great because I eve,

705
00:42:38,401 --> 00:42:41,790
as much as I'm shitting on whatever
I'm saying, it keeps people listening.

706
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:45,870
All right? And they buy stuff. By the
way, guess what I'm wearing a pair of,

707
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:50,260
I'm wearing a pair of me undies. Me
undies, no more sweaty balls, booboo. Boo.

708
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:51,990
I'm wearing them.
They send them to me.

709
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:53,883
MMM.

710
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:58,970
They seem to be working fine,
but I don't have sweaty ball itis,

711
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:01,670
so I don't know what to tell you,
but they didn't advertise this week.

712
00:43:01,671 --> 00:43:05,750
So I'll tell you about my experience
later on another episode. All right.

713
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:07,040
Dollar Shave Club.
Everyone.

714
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,850
Big Shave companies must think
we're a bunch of scumbag criminals.

715
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:15,050
Why else did they lock the raises up
in that maximum security plastic razor

716
00:43:15,051 --> 00:43:17,290
fortress in the [inaudible]?
Uh,

717
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:20,900
you have to stand around like a convict
waiting for the guy to come and unlock

718
00:43:20,901 --> 00:43:25,250
the raise a case. Uh, do they think
you're some kind of a jewel thief?

719
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:29,030
Well, what if some homeless guy
comes in and shaves his balls?

720
00:43:29,031 --> 00:43:31,490
Any Nix it and then you get,
you get homeless ball aids.

721
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,760
Maybe they're trying to fucking
prevent that. I don't know.

722
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:38,030
Why am I sticking up for
cvs? Anyways, next thing.

723
00:43:38,031 --> 00:43:42,440
There'll be a security guard who tazes
you. If you get too close to the raises,

724
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:45,470
you're not a criminal and you shouldn't
be treated like one just because you

725
00:43:45,471 --> 00:43:48,050
need a pack of razors.
Um,

726
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:51,530
they were sick of getting humiliated
every time they need to raise us.

727
00:43:51,531 --> 00:43:55,790
So they came up with dollar shave club.com
they're playing starts at just $3 a

728
00:43:55,791 --> 00:43:59,930
month. They arrive like clockwork. He can
shave with a fresh blade every week. Uh,

729
00:43:59,931 --> 00:44:00,860
that's the American dream.

730
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:05,870
Dollar Shave club.com is
the most convenient way to
get a great shave and the

731
00:44:05,871 --> 00:44:07,100
least expensive too.

732
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:10,700
Maybe if the big shape companies blades
weren't so ridiculously expensive,

733
00:44:10,701 --> 00:44:14,630
they would need to lock them up tighter
than Fort Knox. If anything is criminal,

734
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:19,320
it's the big shape companies
prices. Absolutely. Absolutely.

735
00:44:19,321 --> 00:44:23,120
And now the big shape companies are trying
to do it when a dollar shave club is

736
00:44:23,121 --> 00:44:26,480
doing all right. Fuck those guys.

B u. R r. E. Voice. Everybody.

744
00:44:54,850 --> 00:44:58,860
Um, evidently I love the flexibility
that owning your own business provides.

745
00:44:58,861 --> 00:45:00,150
Why do they do that?

746
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:02,010
Okay,

747
00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:05,890
why? Why? I I, I don't
have my own business,

748
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,600
but evidently I love the flexibility of
it. What else do I love? I don't know.

749
00:45:10,601 --> 00:45:15,340
Let me read more of this copy. Look at
me. I've created an empire with this show.

750
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:19,480
Uh, but when it comes to
handling, handling business calls,

751
00:45:19,481 --> 00:45:21,940
you're stuck with a challenge and now
we're talking to you all of a sudden,

752
00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:26,200
either hire a full time receptionist
or handle all of your calls yourself.

753
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:29,350
It's a lose lose.
That's why I love he voice everybody.

754
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:32,830
They will set up your business.
What the toll free number or a local call.

755
00:45:32,831 --> 00:45:37,420
I actually do. I love this idea.
Okay, I do love this idea. Okay,

756
00:45:37,421 --> 00:45:39,090
but I don't need a voice for
the people that he voiced.

757
00:45:39,091 --> 00:45:41,740
It tells me that I love it. I will
tell them that I love it. If I love it,

758
00:45:42,370 --> 00:45:45,630
the Goddamn it, stop putting more
in my mouth. Um, they will set you,

759
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:48,310
set up your business with the
toll free number or local number.

760
00:45:48,311 --> 00:45:49,960
When customers call,
they have create,

761
00:45:49,970 --> 00:45:53,740
they're greeted by a professional or a
virtual receptionists that were rotate

762
00:45:53,741 --> 00:45:56,800
all of your calls will, that will route
all your calls, sorry to wherever you are.

763
00:45:57,370 --> 00:45:59,140
There's even a dial by name directory.

764
00:45:59,141 --> 00:46:02,200
You're going to sound like a fortune
500 company and more importantly,

765
00:46:02,201 --> 00:46:05,850
you'll never miss an important call
all front of 13 bucks a month. Dude,

766
00:46:05,870 --> 00:46:09,160
this is a joke. If you have your own
business and you don't have a voice,

767
00:46:09,161 --> 00:46:12,850
you're a moron. All right? Right now for
a limited time, I listened as his country,

768
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,560
he voice for free for 60 days.

769
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:19,300
You get this wonderful service
for two months for free, roughly,

770
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:23,440
unless it's back to back 31 days. Then
you got to watch out those last two days.

771
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:25,630
You to have to take your calls seriously.

772
00:46:25,631 --> 00:46:29,650
My listeners get an extended 60 day
trial to test drive this amazing business

773
00:46:29,651 --> 00:46:32,260
tool that is correct,

podcast, everybody, whenever you're
going to buy something on Amazon,

780
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:57,040
uh,

781
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:00,280
just go to [inaudible] dot com click on
the podcast page and then click on the

782
00:47:00,281 --> 00:47:04,570
Amazon link that we have, whatever you
call it, the little picture of Amazon.

783
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:07,720
You Click on that and it'll
take you right to Amazon.

784
00:47:07,721 --> 00:47:12,050
And they kicked me a little bit of money
and, uh, it doesn't cost you a thing. Um,

785
00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:15,770
why can't I get rid of this year?
Don't save.

786
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:17,010
Okay.

787
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:18,860
Alright,
back to this shit.

788
00:47:19,190 --> 00:47:24,190
And I watched a really cool
documentary called Nixon on Nixon,

789
00:47:25,130 --> 00:47:30,130
which is basically the tapes from the
White House that he set up the Nixon tapes

790
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:34,540
and then also interviews that he had.
And um,

791
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:41,290
this guy puts Archie bunker to shame,
you know,

792
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:45,940
but granted it's also like, I mean, the
guy taped himself for like six years,

793
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:49,570
however long he was in office. He had
one term and then he wanted the next one,

794
00:47:49,571 --> 00:47:53,830
I think within a year or so he
was out, what, six 68 to 74,

795
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:55,900
basically five,
six years.

796
00:47:56,650 --> 00:47:59,520
So of course all they pick out is
when he's saying antisemetic shared.

797
00:47:59,521 --> 00:48:04,060
And when he's saying, you know, stuff
about minorities, his stuff about women,

798
00:48:04,061 --> 00:48:09,040
I mean, Jesus Christ, this guy, like
he sounds like Archie bunker, but uh,

799
00:48:09,070 --> 00:48:12,370
it's just a really fascinating thing.
I highly recommend it.

800
00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:17,670
And um, just how like they
say the press is the enemy.

801
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:22,250
The press is the enemy and how you think
it's like this evil thing like this

802
00:48:22,251 --> 00:48:25,950
sitting there going like, yes, we
must lie to the American people.

803
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:29,880
They're view is literally the press is
the enemy because they're distorting what

804
00:48:29,881 --> 00:48:30,840
it is we're trying to say,

805
00:48:30,841 --> 00:48:35,190
which is the classic thing where everybody
thinks that they're doing right and

806
00:48:35,191 --> 00:48:39,750
it's the right thing. I'm a moron and
I enjoyed it and I think you will too.

807
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:45,360
Sure. We all do. Let's get to some
questions here this week. Um, oh,

808
00:48:45,361 --> 00:48:49,350
by the way, I was in New York City,
uh, barely had time to do anything. Uh,

809
00:48:49,351 --> 00:48:51,870
I went and I recorded, we, uh,

810
00:48:51,871 --> 00:48:55,770
we got a big time actor to do
one of the roles on my show.

811
00:48:55,771 --> 00:48:59,790
F is for family and had a
great time doing that. And A,

812
00:48:59,791 --> 00:49:02,040
I can't fucking wait for
this show to come out.

813
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:06,270
We're doing the last records today and uh,

814
00:49:06,330 --> 00:49:07,230
I'm not allowed to say,

815
00:49:07,231 --> 00:49:10,470
I guess some of the people that we got
on this thing and we signed another

816
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:13,710
person to do it and yeah,

817
00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:18,540
we're going to have to record
today. Yeah. Um, so anyways,

818
00:49:19,110 --> 00:49:24,000
the stock market, uh, Billy
market belt, are you involved,

819
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:26,370
are you involved the,
Oh,

820
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:30,540
are you involved in the buying and
trading of stocks or mutual funds?

821
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,200
Do you have a business manager
diversifying your shit?

822
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:37,230
Come to San Diego and go fuck yourself.

823
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:41,970
That is an unbelievably personal
fucking question, but I'll answer it.

824
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:48,240
This is what I think about the
stock market. I think it's a, uh, I,

825
00:49:48,410 --> 00:49:53,120
I just, I think it's, um, uh,

826
00:49:53,310 --> 00:49:56,610
it's like Vegas,
it's just a crap table.

827
00:49:57,390 --> 00:50:00,550
And I think insider trading happens all
the time and I think there's people who

828
00:50:00,551 --> 00:50:03,540
go in and they drive the market up and
then they pulled their money out and it

829
00:50:03,541 --> 00:50:04,920
falls down and then they fight.

830
00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:07,320
They buy it low and they
do it all the fucking time.

831
00:50:07,590 --> 00:50:11,910
And the same people that do that put
the money behind these campaigns for the

832
00:50:11,911 --> 00:50:15,330
people who become president and
only make $500,000 a fucking year.

833
00:50:15,331 --> 00:50:17,270
And that's why people look the other way.
And then once I,

834
00:50:17,271 --> 00:50:22,170
if he fucking 20 years they
throw a celebrity chef in
jail to make it seem like

835
00:50:22,171 --> 00:50:25,880
they're doing something.
Um,

836
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,580
am I in the stock market?
Uh, sort of, but not really.

837
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:34,460
I'm super conservative and uh,

838
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:38,680
I just look at my retirement account
that I just want it to still be there.

839
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:42,850
I'm not worried about it gaining interest.
I'm just more worried about the,

840
00:50:42,851 --> 00:50:45,620
some of the money.
MMM.

841
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:49,850
But I don't look at my retirement
fund like it's even going to be there.

842
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:53,840
The way these bags of fucking
running wild is hulk Hogan says,

843
00:50:53,870 --> 00:50:55,760
and nobody is trying to stop these guys.

844
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:58,790
And I've lately been fucking bitching
about why we're still having to fucking

845
00:50:58,791 --> 00:51:01,490
wards over in the Middle East.
MMM.

846
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:06,130
And fighting fucking terrorist groups of
30 fucking people who don't even have a

847
00:51:06,131 --> 00:51:09,200
fucking airplane.
You know what I mean?

848
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:14,970
Like they're going to come over here
and do something to us and like what?

849
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:17,450
Destroy this fucking company
and it causes a quadrant cost.

850
00:51:17,451 --> 00:51:19,980
They could come over here and they
could fucking blow something up. Yeah.

851
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:21,390
All right.
We're going to survive that.

852
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:24,650
We need to spend billions of
fucking dollars over there

853
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:30,620
going after 30,000 fucking jerk offs,
you know?

854
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:34,910
Meanwhile you got insurance companies
and bankers raping everybody over here.

855
00:51:35,090 --> 00:51:37,730
And then you got other people
poisoning the food supply.

856
00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:42,680
You know,
what are they got there that dead,

857
00:51:44,490 --> 00:51:46,710
the this so fucking powerful.

858
00:51:46,711 --> 00:51:51,630
Like you're not even allowed to say what's
in the food. You got this dumb shit.

859
00:51:51,631 --> 00:51:54,570
You watching the world series and they
have stand up for cancer and nobody's

860
00:51:54,571 --> 00:51:58,170
talking about the fucking food supply.
And then if you criticize the,

861
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:01,470
I'm standing up for cancer, like you don't
give a shit about and they just start,

862
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:06,480
they always just start yelling at people
and they never yell at the fucking five

863
00:52:06,481 --> 00:52:11,260
fucking guys that they could
actually change the shit. It's,

864
00:52:11,261 --> 00:52:14,110
it drives me up the fucking wall.
It's like that.

865
00:52:14,111 --> 00:52:18,730
Then hold their whole fucking
no more campaign is classic NFL

866
00:52:20,330 --> 00:52:22,790
classic.
And it felt like there reprimanding you.

867
00:52:22,850 --> 00:52:27,380
Like you were the one who didn't show
that whole fucking tape the Internet,

868
00:52:27,530 --> 00:52:30,900
the very least they're trying to
say we're all guilty. It's like, no,

869
00:52:30,930 --> 00:52:33,990
you're guilty. Get cunt. So whatever.

870
00:52:35,670 --> 00:52:39,600
So that's what I see. I say bring the
boys and girls home and uh, you know,

871
00:52:39,601 --> 00:52:40,231
we started a,

872
00:52:40,231 --> 00:52:43,410
we invade the fucking people that are
putting all this crazy shit in the food

873
00:52:43,411 --> 00:52:48,000
supply. I'd start with that and I'd
knock on some bankers house, you know,

874
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,440
you like, what the fuck
are you doing? You know,

875
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:55,790
that would make everybody's
life way better,

876
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:57,973
I would think

877
00:52:59,330 --> 00:53:03,750
rather than going after fucking 5,000
people working out on a jungle gym bill,

878
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:08,030
you kind of over simplifying things. Well
that's what I do do. You don't like it.

879
00:53:08,031 --> 00:53:10,930
Listen to another fucking podcast.
You want to listen to some of you read Ga,

880
00:53:10,931 --> 00:53:15,020
go listen to Joe Rogan.
There's an informed human being.

881
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:19,070
All right, you listen to the Joe
Rogan experience to learn things.

882
00:53:19,071 --> 00:53:22,190
You listen to my podcast to feel
better about yourself, to feel smarter,

883
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:26,130
you know?
Does that make you feel good

884
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:30,570
on that? You smarter than me?
Well fuck you. All right. Okay,

885
00:53:31,230 --> 00:53:35,750
here we go. Farmer bill. Hey Bill.
Let's say the apocalypse goes down. Uh,

886
00:53:35,751 --> 00:53:40,320
I take a steak knife and stick it in
my neck and I would hum a jingle bells.

887
00:53:40,321 --> 00:53:43,030
And that's how I would end it. He
goes, oh, anyways, he goes, shoot,

888
00:53:43,890 --> 00:53:48,300
you get to that farm and you
realize you only have three crops.

889
00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:54,750
Oh, you, you get to that farm. What farm
did I say? I was going to have a farm.

890
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:58,290
No, Jesus, I didn't know what you are.
You already lost me two sentences in.

891
00:53:58,291 --> 00:54:00,090
But I'll keep reading.
What do you grow?

892
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:04,800
You might be living off these three
fruits or vegetables for awhile.

893
00:54:05,130 --> 00:54:08,100
So you gotta be smart.
Also,

894
00:54:08,101 --> 00:54:13,080
you need to think about how
you might combine them to
change it up a bit. Thanks.

895
00:54:13,081 --> 00:54:15,840
And Go fuck yourself up. First of
all, I don't have to do any of that.

896
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:19,020
I didn't have to answer this fucking
question and I resent the fact that you're

897
00:54:19,021 --> 00:54:21,390
telling me that I have to do
this when you can't even fucking,

898
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:27,450
you're writing sentences as bad as
I speak. Um, but I'll answer it.

899
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:31,200
I'll answer it. Um, so I,

900
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:36,120
when I get to vet farm and I, and if I
could have three crops, what would I grow?

901
00:54:38,970 --> 00:54:39,803
Let's see here.

902
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:41,980
Okay.

903
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:43,660
I'd have to vegetables and fruit,

904
00:54:45,310 --> 00:54:49,300
right?
That workout.

905
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:53,610
I guess I'd have some sort of lettuce.

906
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:58,500
Well, first of all, the
fruit. I like bananas.

907
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:02,630
It's very hard to get sick of bananas.
I could eat a banana every day. Boom,

908
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:07,170
banana, potassium, no matter
what. I'm going to end up
getting some sort of scurvy.

909
00:55:07,171 --> 00:55:08,004
Right?

910
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:10,813
Okay.

911
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:12,830
I make maybe I need an orange.

912
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:14,840
Okay.

913
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:17,200
Trying to think of all this shit and
what would happen when you get scurvy?

914
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:20,590
You know what, I, I can't answer it.
I, I'd have to read up on nutrition.

915
00:55:21,910 --> 00:55:24,100
I didn't know that there was going
to be a test this week. Everybody,

916
00:55:24,890 --> 00:55:28,750
if I was just going by taste,
I would have a banana,

917
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:33,090
uh, some sort of lettuce. And then what?

918
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:34,780
What's another vegetable that I like?

919
00:55:35,830 --> 00:55:36,630
Yeah,

920
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:39,190
I dunno. Apples. Yeah. My,

921
00:55:39,191 --> 00:55:44,191
so my vegetables would be a lettuce and
apples and then the fruit would be a

922
00:55:45,481 --> 00:55:47,730
banana.
Today you go.

923
00:55:48,730 --> 00:55:50,910
Now I want to ask everybody
who just listened there,

924
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:55,290
like how excited did you get that you
thought that I actually thought that an

925
00:55:55,291 --> 00:55:58,350
apple was a vegetable,
you know,

926
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:01,800
and it made you feel better about
you and your fucking stupid life.

927
00:56:02,490 --> 00:56:05,970
That full for one second you were
writing to somebody else was wrong.

928
00:56:05,971 --> 00:56:07,530
What does that say about you as a person?

929
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:12,630
If you didn't actually just hear me say
that and then actually feel sad like,

930
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:16,260
oh no, oh no, he's going
to make a fool of himself.

931
00:56:16,350 --> 00:56:19,560
If it actually made you fucking happy,
you know?

932
00:56:21,150 --> 00:56:22,830
Do you think that I'm
going to wish you a happy?

933
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:27,270
I hope you fall face first into the gravy.
When you think about dad,

934
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:31,470
right in front of your mom and when you
pick up your fucking half burned up face

935
00:56:31,770 --> 00:56:33,690
and you're pulling that lot off your face,

936
00:56:33,691 --> 00:56:37,080
I would just love for you to see
the disappointment in her eyes.

937
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:41,700
That's what I want for you on this
wonderful week for giving thanks.

938
00:56:42,790 --> 00:56:45,720
Um, Jesus Christ. How fucking
heavy handed and they going to be.

939
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:49,920
You know the NFL right?

940
00:56:49,921 --> 00:56:54,600
This week when they do their fucking
Thanksgiving games, you know they,

941
00:56:54,690 --> 00:56:59,450
they're going to have like a camouflage
fucking Turkey for the troops and then

942
00:56:59,451 --> 00:57:02,240
you know there's going to be
something about some disease.

943
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:06,510
This is what they're gonna do.
They're gonna,

944
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:11,540
they're gonna say no more hitting
women with the camouflage Turkey leg

945
00:57:14,650 --> 00:57:15,910
with a cancered riddle,

946
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:21,610
camouflage Turkey while supporting the
troops. That's what they're going to say.

947
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:24,040
I think they're going to combine
all of that. And at some point,

948
00:57:24,041 --> 00:57:26,680
I imagine everybody's gonna
stand up for some, for something.

949
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:30,460
They're going to stand up for a disease.
I stand up for cancer.

950
00:57:30,461 --> 00:57:33,880
Sounds like you support cancer,
doesn't it? Stand up for cancer.

951
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:35,530
Stand up for it.

952
00:57:37,550 --> 00:57:39,800
How about it shouldn't be
stand up against cancer.

953
00:57:42,070 --> 00:57:44,140
Am I slowly losing my mind and like,

954
00:57:44,141 --> 00:57:46,150
I don't understand the English
language all of a sudden.

955
00:57:46,151 --> 00:57:50,970
Am I getting some sort of a, I
dunno. I know. What the fuck.

956
00:57:50,971 --> 00:57:52,750
I can't even, I didn't know what
the fuck to tell you. I just,

957
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:57,280
I just wish they would just play
the games. Just show the gay.

958
00:57:57,290 --> 00:58:00,520
I don't need you to try to make
me be a better person. All right.

959
00:58:00,550 --> 00:58:05,320
I'm a piece of shit and I'm trying.
Okay. And I need to be fucking like,

960
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:10,820
I don't need you be my fucking
parents. Right. Fireplace.

961
00:58:10,930 --> 00:58:15,290
Uh, Billy clause. Uh,
I'm thinking of a, Oh,

962
00:58:15,291 --> 00:58:19,440
what about Avocados?
Gotta love and Avocado.

963
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:24,390
Hey, I'm back. I'm back on my diet here.

964
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,950
This is how I lose weight. I juice
morning in lunch and then I tried to eat.

965
00:58:30,951 --> 00:58:33,770
Fucking is Veggie as I came for
the rest of the fucking day.

966
00:58:33,771 --> 00:58:37,670
And then you skip the rope. He skipped
her. Open up, melts off you. That's it.

967
00:58:37,790 --> 00:58:41,630
Then you're done. Then you're in Billy
Bob Thornton shape. Alright. Fireplace.

968
00:58:41,631 --> 00:58:45,680
Billy clause. I'm thinking fixing.
I'm thinking fixing up my basement.

969
00:58:45,681 --> 00:58:47,390
You thinking of fixing up your basement.

970
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:50,600
The previous owner had a
fireplace plastered over.

971
00:58:50,601 --> 00:58:53,510
It's either a traditional
fireplace or a wood stove.

972
00:58:55,370 --> 00:58:58,880
Do you have any feeling of how I'm
supposed to assume and understand that

973
00:58:58,881 --> 00:59:02,420
literally the way you wrote that and
mean it sounded like behind the wall was

974
00:59:02,421 --> 00:59:05,040
either a traditional fireplace
or a wood stove. Mike, what the,

975
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:08,780
who the fuck would have a
woodstove in a wall? Um,

976
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:11,600
do you have any feet? Well,
maybe there is, is there,

977
00:59:11,630 --> 00:59:15,840
when I think of a woodstove it's
sitting in the middle of a room. Have,

978
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:19,790
fuck now I gotta go. I gotta Google
image it. I got a Google image

979
00:59:26,490 --> 00:59:28,690
when I'm going down the road.

980
00:59:28,930 --> 00:59:33,420
You guys just enjoy this music while
I look this up. You fucking something.

981
00:59:33,450 --> 00:59:37,840
Wonder why babe,
when I'm going down the road,

982
00:59:38,690 --> 00:59:43,690
I used to do something soft wood stove.

983
00:59:45,370 --> 00:59:50,370
I can't sit and type at
the same time image but B.

984
00:59:56,210 --> 00:59:59,150
Yeah. What stove? Yeah. It sits
out in the fucking, there it is.

985
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:00,980
I'll do a Paul Versey does dude.

986
01:00:00,981 --> 01:00:03,800
I Google what the stoves and none
of them were in a wall. Yeah.

987
01:00:03,801 --> 01:00:05,030
None of them are in a wall.
Okay.

988
01:00:09,390 --> 01:00:12,340
Hey,
some day I gave her ma,

989
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:17,380
but she wanted my soul.
Don't think twice.

990
01:00:17,381 --> 01:00:20,410
It's all right. All right.
Fireplace. Say Billy clause.

991
01:00:20,470 --> 01:00:24,310
I'm thinking of fixing up my basement,
the previous owner ahead of fire.

992
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:26,080
What fireplace plastered over it.

993
01:00:26,081 --> 01:00:28,480
So it's either the traditional
fireplace or a wood stove.

994
01:00:28,481 --> 01:00:31,870
That's how I should have written.
Do you have any feelings either way,

995
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:35,350
pros or cons on the, on the matter? Um,

996
01:00:36,250 --> 01:00:36,570
okay.

997
01:00:36,570 --> 01:00:40,110
Oh, I'd go into the wall, dude.
If you got a fireplace matter,

998
01:00:40,290 --> 01:00:41,520
they don't allow him anymore.

999
01:00:42,690 --> 01:00:43,300
Yeah.

1000
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:46,120
You know,
I don't know where the fuck you live,

1001
01:00:46,121 --> 01:00:47,450
where you could actually
have a wood stove.

1002
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:50,550
I didn't think that they
allowed that anymore.

1003
01:00:51,490 --> 01:00:51,860
Okay.

1004
01:00:51,860 --> 01:00:56,830
Or You could just have some shit
coming out of the chimney. Um,

1005
01:00:56,860 --> 01:00:59,230
but you know,
if you actually already have a fireplace,

1006
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:01,600
if that system is already there.

1007
01:01:02,470 --> 01:01:02,910
Okay.

1008
01:01:02,910 --> 01:01:05,370
Yeah. But then the fucking
Jimmy's going to be fucked up.

1009
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:06,280
Okay.

1010
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:09,220
And then you have to fix that. I would,
you know, I would go the expensive route.

1011
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:10,713
That's what I do.

1012
01:01:11,570 --> 01:01:12,060
Okay.

1013
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:14,820
I would die. I would take it,
I would have the exposed brick.

1014
01:01:14,821 --> 01:01:19,821
This is the original brick from the early
1920s back when Babe Ruth was playing

1015
01:01:20,131 --> 01:01:24,650
in a softball league.
Dude,

1016
01:01:24,651 --> 01:01:27,470
they were doing the Charleston when the
guy was hitting home runs. I mean, Jesus,

1017
01:01:27,471 --> 01:01:32,150
give me a fucking break bat, Bat,
Bat, bat, yet up it up. Boom,

1018
01:01:32,210 --> 01:01:32,510
boom.

1019
01:01:32,510 --> 01:01:37,510
Like that was a hit song will blow the
yet yet that Danila do to fuck a woman

1020
01:01:37,851 --> 01:01:39,440
walking around wearing swimming caps.

1021
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:40,780
Okay.

1022
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:44,890
That's when guys that had
one piece bathing suits and
went down to your fucking

1023
01:01:44,891 --> 01:01:46,960
knees and they had just stripes across it.

1024
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:48,300
Okay.

1025
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:49,770
They need to have a fucking life guard.

1026
01:01:49,771 --> 01:01:52,310
You just went into the ocean and
you're drowned. And like that I was at,

1027
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:57,280
nobody gets sued.
I don't fucking know.

1028
01:01:57,340 --> 01:01:59,350
Anyways. Uh, yeah, I
would, I would, I would.

1029
01:02:00,670 --> 01:02:01,470
Okay.

1030
01:02:01,470 --> 01:02:05,730
I would unearth the fucking fireplace.
That's what I would do. Um, anyways, hey,

1031
01:02:05,731 --> 01:02:10,230
we're still trying to raise money for
the all things comedy, uh, studio.

All right. And with that,

potatoes and so fucking yams for you.

1046
01:03:04,460 --> 01:03:05,040
Yeah.

1047
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:10,040
And don't get into a fight no matter
how much your brother's a dick,

1048
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:13,830
hello people.
It's once again,

1049
01:03:13,831 --> 01:03:18,150
that time of year when Douche bags on
TV tell you to stop and think about

1050
01:03:18,151 --> 01:03:21,000
everything that you have.
You know,

1051
01:03:21,630 --> 01:03:26,630
millionaires on television sitting there
getting blown right before the take

1052
01:03:27,061 --> 01:03:31,740
that they did to tell you to sit back
and feel thankful for everything that you

1053
01:03:31,741 --> 01:03:33,240
have. This is the thing, you know,

1054
01:03:33,241 --> 01:03:36,870
it'd be a great goal is if you're
going home for Thanksgiving, okay.

1055
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:41,800
Especially if you're in your college
years and you were still have fucking hate

1056
01:03:41,810 --> 01:03:42,643
my parents.

1057
01:03:42,690 --> 01:03:47,250
If you could just somehow go
there and not yell at anybody,

1058
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:50,430
not get drawn into a fight.
Okay.

1059
01:03:50,431 --> 01:03:54,330
When one of your siblings who makes
those passive aggressive comments because

1060
01:03:54,331 --> 01:03:58,980
they're competing for the attention of
your parents because subconsciously they

1061
01:03:58,981 --> 01:04:02,790
realize that despite what your
mother says, you are her favorite.

1062
01:04:03,530 --> 01:04:03,970
Okay.

1063
01:04:03,970 --> 01:04:08,740
You know, you're just going to, I never
had kids, but it's a possible you've got,

1064
01:04:08,770 --> 01:04:13,000
I mean, you know, I love the
Bruins. I have my favorite player.

1065
01:04:13,990 --> 01:04:17,850
You know what I mean? Speaking of which
Jesus Christ, we've got to get healthy,

1066
01:04:18,270 --> 01:04:20,250
good Lord fucking loss
to the Canadians again.

1067
01:04:21,330 --> 01:04:22,163
MMM.

1068
01:04:23,110 --> 01:04:24,660
I actually sat down and I,
uh,

1069
01:04:24,710 --> 01:04:26,860
enjoyed the rangers beating
the shit out of Canadians.

1070
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:28,990
Something that we haven't been
able to do this year, but you know,

1071
01:04:29,020 --> 01:04:31,030
you're going to have those left down case,
but the Canadians look good.

1072
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:35,710
God Damn it. Those bastards look good. Um,
anyways. Yeah. So why don't you do that?

1073
01:04:36,910 --> 01:04:37,743
Okay.

1074
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:40,910
Do that.
Sit down and have some fucking food.

1075
01:04:40,940 --> 01:04:45,280
I would love to have Thanksgiving this
year, but I got dusted my fucker ketchup.

1076
01:04:47,350 --> 01:04:47,660
Yeah.

1077
01:04:47,660 --> 01:04:49,850
Hear that. You hear the knocking
down stairs. People knocking.

1078
01:04:49,870 --> 01:04:52,490
Bunch of Kate come in. All right.

on the Internet and now we've got
to get the dates up on my website,

1087
01:05:20,851 --> 01:05:25,851
but I am going to be going to basically
all the major cities in Australia except

1088
01:05:26,041 --> 01:05:30,180
for the one that begins with an a that
I got a bunch of shit from where people

1089
01:05:30,181 --> 01:05:33,150
were giving me Shit, you know,
for not going over there.

1090
01:05:33,151 --> 01:05:35,610
I'm just taking a 20 hour
fucking flight to Perth.

1091
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:39,090
Can you also fucking come here? Why
don't you guys get on a Choo Choo train?

1092
01:05:39,091 --> 01:05:41,070
He do you guys even have
trains in Australia?

1093
01:05:42,090 --> 01:05:43,800
We able to build them or did the fucking,

1094
01:05:43,801 --> 01:05:45,810
everybody went to build
and get bit by a fucking,

1095
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:49,620
some ridiculously inland's
something or other.

1096
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:51,780
It has enough venom.

1097
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:54,960
They killed 200 elephants because there's
no fucking food supply out of that.

1098
01:05:54,961 --> 01:05:58,740
So when they bite you, they got to make a
Sherry accounts. Um, yeah. Why don't you,

1103
01:06:11,191 --> 01:06:12,930

when he's over there. Um,

1104

and I'm going to do two dates over there.

1105
01:06:17,730 --> 01:06:22,000
And a rumor has it that,
um,

1106
01:06:22,050 --> 01:06:25,080
I might be adding some Asia,
some Asia dates

1107
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:30,090
onto this tour and uh,
to give you an hint,

1108
01:06:30,330 --> 01:06:31,860
to give you a hint.

1109
01:06:32,550 --> 01:06:33,390
MMM.

1110
01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:38,780
Let's see. How can I, let me see
if I know enough about any of these

1111
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:43,070
countries to give you a hint. All
right. I'm going to give you a hint.

1112
01:06:43,130 --> 01:06:46,760
One of these,
I'm going to be going to the land.

1113
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:52,300
Anybody who's English speaking in the
crowd will be either an ex patriot or a

1114
01:06:52,941 --> 01:06:55,610
telemarketer. All right? Come on.

1115
01:06:55,611 --> 01:07:00,200
People where the telemarketers
from when you call up,

1116
01:07:00,290 --> 01:07:05,290
hello, my name is Fike, right?
Where are they from? Um,

1117
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:08,660
I'm going to do a stand up show in a
country where I could maybe possibly get

1118
01:07:08,661 --> 01:07:11,690
caned afterwards.
Ah,

1119
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:15,690
quiver in butt cheeks over there.
Um,

1120
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:20,360
I'm going to do stand up possibly
in a city where right off the coast,

1121
01:07:20,361 --> 01:07:24,110
there might be some right in the water,
right in the bay.

1122
01:07:24,111 --> 01:07:29,060
There might be some old army
helicopters under the water.

1123
01:07:33,050 --> 01:07:37,460
And then I'm also going to do
a show in a country where, uh,

1124
01:07:38,990 --> 01:07:42,690
oh Jesus Christ.
How do I fucking do this one?

1125
01:07:42,810 --> 01:07:46,370
I'm out of definitely
a bunch of ex patriots.

1126
01:07:46,790 --> 01:07:48,260
It's English speaking

1127
01:07:50,110 --> 01:07:53,840
in a country that Nixon
actually broke the science. Uh,

1128
01:07:53,841 --> 01:07:57,730
science broke the silence with one of
his big moves that he did during his

1129
01:07:57,731 --> 01:08:02,680
presidency was he actually went and had
a big meeting with these guys. All right,

1130
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:08,470
there you go. It's going to
be an insane tour and, uh,

1131
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:12,670
I'll probably lose money on most of the
nights, especially with those last ones.

1132
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:14,770
I mean, I didn't, and you know, where
the fuck I'm going to be performing,

1133
01:08:14,771 --> 01:08:19,430
but I'm going, God damn,
why the fuck wouldn't shit?
That's it. And, uh, anyways,

1134
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:23,450
everybody have a happy thanksgiving. Uh,
you know, come on. They're your family.

1135
01:08:23,451 --> 01:08:25,460
You love them.
Don't get drawn into the fights.

1136
