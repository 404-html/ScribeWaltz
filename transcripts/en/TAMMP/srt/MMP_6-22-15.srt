1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,220
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:08,160
It's bill burr and it's the Monday
morning podcast for Monday. He over there.

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:09,483
It's uh,

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:14,060
June 22nd,

5
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:17,090
2015 and I am in Santa Rosa.

6
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:22,490
Santa Rosa with it makes the one
you're naughty say, um, California,

7
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:27,320
Santa Rosa. And um,
last night I performed,

8
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,890
I don't even know. I can't remember the
name of the venue. The Wells Fargo. Oh,

9
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,130
Ho the wells Fargo wagon is,
uh,

10
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:37,310
I can't even look it up on my
website because my fucking website,

11
00:00:37,311 --> 00:00:41,660
the second I do the Gig, he's
like, go fuck yourself. It's over.

12
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:46,100
That information no longer exists.
Wait a second, we look me up here.

13
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:50,240
Let me look me up. Oh God.
He's in his ego this week.

14
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,470
Basically I would gives a fuck
with the name of the thing was, um,

15
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,900
the venue I played last
night was the, uh, the venue.

16
00:01:00,901 --> 00:01:04,350
George Carlin did his
last stand up special.

17
00:01:04,351 --> 00:01:07,950
And um, someone, I thought,

18
00:01:07,951 --> 00:01:10,650
someone told me that this was the
place where he did his last show.

19
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:15,150
I was the wells Fargo
Center for the, Ah, um,

20
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,920
this is the place where he did,
um,

21
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:23,520
his recorded his last special and his
last performance was at the Orleans Casino

22
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:30,660
in Las Vegas. If you're a
George Carlin, not like me. Um,

23
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:36,420
so last night I was, I was standing
backstage and I don't, man,

24
00:01:36,421 --> 00:01:41,070
it was really fucking cool.
It was such an amazing venue.

25
00:01:41,071 --> 00:01:43,770
It had like the lower level.
And then I had like this,

26
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:48,270
this small upper deck that
just wrapped around, you know,

27
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:51,000
all three sites that I
was looking out at it.

28
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:54,330
It looked like a minor league ballpark.
And the crowd was,

29
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,830
I could tell when Bart Nick
went out there, they were, uh,

30
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:04,530
they were just a really smart crowd and
a one of my best shows of the fucking

31
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,120
tool. So I really want to thank everyone
that came out last night and um,

32
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:12,300
you know, it was a good
time. I Dunno, who knows.

33
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:17,310
I ended up staying on the up to like
four in the morning with fucking Barnick

34
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:22,620
much in full metal jacket and
drinking this wine because you know,

35
00:02:22,621 --> 00:02:23,520
we're in wine country,

36
00:02:23,521 --> 00:02:26,490
so they just given us this fucking wine
and we're drinking it and I have the

37
00:02:26,491 --> 00:02:30,450
worst goddamn hangover. I
fucking, I appreciate wine.

38
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:34,620
But wine should only be drank with
like a good meal. You know what I mean?

39
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,490
Seminar women can drink it. I don't
know how the fuck they do it. You know,

40
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,091
around four,

41
00:02:39,091 --> 00:02:42,450
four 30 when they really just can't
deal with their fucking kids anymore.

42
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:46,410
They just, you know, they
pop in a DVD, you know? Okay,

43
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:51,330
go watch spongebob takes over fucking
Japan, whatever the fuck they're doin.

44
00:02:51,331 --> 00:02:54,960
Right.
Spongebob First Pokemon come on kids,

45
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:56,783
you know,

46
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:02,420
this was just sit out and then they
just fucking did just start boozing,

47
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,230
which I totally respect.

48
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:08,500
I don't know how the fuck they do
with them and it's a brutal hangover.

49
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:12,400
So I'm like, all right, the bus isn't,
we're not leaving until 11 in the morning,

50
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:17,180
you know. So I stayed up till like four
in the morning and the back of my head,

51
00:03:17,181 --> 00:03:19,260
it's like, well, I gotta do
my podcasts. It's like, Eh,

52
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,990
no big deal I'll do on the bus and
I'll just fucking uploaded. And uh,

53
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,810
it like fucking eight 30 in the morning.

54
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,710
The people staying in the room next to me,
they had these two little kids,

55
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:33,310
like real young. Those fucking
kids are up at the crack of dawn.

56
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,600
And one of them was,
you know,

57
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:39,700
there's a door between my hotel room and
the other one and one of them with his

58
00:03:39,701 --> 00:03:44,200
little baby hand was just
slapping the door, you know,

59
00:03:44,201 --> 00:03:48,470
talking Jibo's. Yeah. I can't, I
can't just slap, slap, slap bitch.

60
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:53,350
Kiki can't get mad at a
baby. You know what I mean? I
mean, I guess some people do,

61
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:58,370
you know, that doesn't usually end up
well. I think babies are pretty much, uh,

62
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:02,380
they've yet to win in a fight with
an adult. You know what I mean?

63
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:07,410
They like the 1977 fucking Tampa Bay
Buccaneers that just went all and 14.

64
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,160
You know,
I don't know what it is with babies.

65
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,820
They really got to turn it around
when they're fighting adults,

66
00:04:15,821 --> 00:04:19,540
they got her somehow they've
got to change the culture,

67
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:21,663
you know,

68
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:26,650
then that nursery in somehow try to get
out there and try and find a way to win.

69
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:30,220
You know? Cause I'll tell
you right now, you know,

70
00:04:30,221 --> 00:04:31,570
if they keep doing what
they're doing or you know,

71
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:35,710
they're never going to beat an
adult. You liked that? I wanted to,

72
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:40,670
I went to Mike Golick there.
Yeah, the kid cry. So um,

73
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:44,260
it's unfucking real, just that
kids just fucking wake up and they,

74
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,950
they don't even have to stretch.
You know what I mean?

75
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,520
Like the four I get out of bed,
I swear to God,

76
00:04:51,521 --> 00:04:54,340
if I just lay down and watch TV for
20 minutes, if I get out of bed,

77
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:59,080
I feel like I haven't walked in nine
years. Like I, before I get out of bed,

78
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:03,550
I literally have to take my fucking toes
and point them at my knees and hold it

79
00:05:03,551 --> 00:05:07,630
there for like, fuck, it
felt like a good 30 seconds.

80
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:11,860
Then I get up, I'm fine if I don't do
that. If I just get up and start walking,

81
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:12,881
I do that,
you know,

82
00:05:12,881 --> 00:05:17,420
you take that one and a half steps and
you do that little fucking quick little

83
00:05:17,421 --> 00:05:20,410
of like somebody just kicked you in the
side of the leg, you go, oh, you know,

84
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,800
and I have to stop putting my hands down
on the mattress and then stretch out my

85
00:05:25,871 --> 00:05:30,760
fucking whatever it is. My Achilles,
just kids just get up and run,

86
00:05:30,761 --> 00:05:35,350
man. You know, I swear to God, if I,

87
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,250
is it illegal, they get
your baby drunk, you know,

88
00:05:39,251 --> 00:05:42,760
just social sleep longer and when it wakes
up it's just going to lay there like,

89
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:46,530
ah shit. Yeah. Uh, fuck it.

90
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:51,130
Let me just lay here. Let me just lay
here for another 20 minutes, you know?

91
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:55,900
So what I would do if I had a baby,
I would just get it hammered big time,

92
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:00,800
drink up. You know, I put a right,
this formula, is that illegal?

93
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,030
You know,
I know you,

94
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:07,670
you're not allowed to drink publicly
until you're 18 but if you're with your

95
00:06:07,671 --> 00:06:11,180
parent or legal guardian,
catch you get fucked up together.

96
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:16,660
I'm seriously asking you that. You
know, what if it's wine, you know,

97
00:06:16,661 --> 00:06:19,190
you make it sophisticated,
like whatever, like,

98
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,210
like if you have like one of those
Gerber ones, if it's a lighter color,

99
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:27,240
do you go with the white wine for the
baby and then if it's like one of those

100
00:06:27,241 --> 00:06:30,120
ones that has beets in it,
you get them a red or is that redundant?

101
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,050
Is that vulgar to have,
uh,

102
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:38,160
that two colors on top of each other?
I have no idea. I have no idea.

103
00:06:38,161 --> 00:06:42,750
I'm not sophisticated. Like, like
you fucking wine drinkers, you know,

104
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,550
somebody has got gotta be, do I know the,
obviously I know that's fucking illegal,

105
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:52,170
but somebody out there's got to be
doing it, you know, like Jesus Christ.

106
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,090
It's like if you're a night owl and your
kid just wakes up at six in the morning,

107
00:06:57,091 --> 00:06:59,850
something has to give,
you know,

108
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,120
then they used to do that
when babies were teething,

109
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,630
they pour a little booze into
their milk or something like that.

110
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:10,530
Or did they rub it right on their
gums? You know, like the kids,

111
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:11,910
some fucking cop

112
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,950
trying to determine whether
it's cocaine or not. You know,

113
00:07:16,951 --> 00:07:20,520
they always do that in the fucking
TV shows and the movies where like,

114
00:07:20,521 --> 00:07:23,110
they're like, what do you got
there Mike? And he goes, you know,

115
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,960
he does a little little tap, tap,
tap, and a Christian. He said, yeah,

116
00:07:27,961 --> 00:07:32,790
this is the real deal.
You know? Oh, he's crying,

117
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:37,440
poor thing. Whenever you hear
a baby cry, just start fucking,

118
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:40,830
I'd always makes me laugh. I always
just think like, you know what dude,

119
00:07:40,831 --> 00:07:43,080
I hear you.
I want to do that too.

120
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:48,120
I wish I could still cry like that the
way baby does. Just over little things.

121
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,370
I think I wouldn't be angry
anymore. He says, you just
get it out of you. You know,

122
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:58,560
if I go to turn on my phone and I find
out that I didn't recharge it the night

123
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:01,770
before and it's completely dead,
you know,

124
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,130
rather than the fucking Goddamn fucking
idiot bill. What if I just went,

125
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:16,470
he just fucking cry it out.
Oh my God.

126
00:08:16,471 --> 00:08:19,470
How much would your wife fucking freak
out if he just started doing that?

127
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:23,380
I wish I could do it for real,
you know,

128
00:08:23,381 --> 00:08:27,070
just as a joke with me and just tell her
that I fucking w I'm reading this new

129
00:08:27,071 --> 00:08:31,720
book on crying it out and just
see how long it could sustain it.

130
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:33,270
Yeah.

131
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:36,420
I didn't think I could cry once. She
just be like, put the fuck are you doing?

132
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:41,060
You know what I mean?
And then I would just cry.

133
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,240
Like you don't have a baby
does when you yell at it.

134
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,290
Okay.

135
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,160
I Dunno what it is.

136
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:50,880
Maybe he's just fucking make me
laugh no matter what they're doing.

137
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,960
Like if me see those psychos,
like when you're on a fucking plane,

138
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:59,010
I think I feel like I just keep going.
Like, what if this happened? Like,

139
00:08:59,011 --> 00:09:02,790
did you ever have this happen? Like
why am I talking, I gotta do it again.

140
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:04,111
Instead of saying like,

141
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:08,970
why am I talking as if I'm a seventh
grade girl chewing gum. You know why?

142
00:09:08,971 --> 00:09:11,520
Cause I went to bed at like
four 30 in the morning.

143
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:14,880
That's why she going to
have to deal with it. Oh,

144
00:09:14,881 --> 00:09:17,620
Billy teeny bopper hears this week.
Um,

145
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,840
whenever I'm on a fucking
plane and a baby starts crying,

146
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:26,900
whenever I see people like the,
those people get angry

147
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:33,230
and they put on their fucking
Bose noise canceling. Thanks.

148
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:35,330
You know,

149
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:39,020
I always feel like anybody who has the
money to buy headphones that all they do

150
00:09:39,021 --> 00:09:41,900
is just block out the sound of
other people. It's just like

151
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:47,540
there's only the only way
you could do that as a few.
Uh, he had like blood money.

152
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,320
Who's got the money for Bose?
Fucking,

153
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:55,040
they're like $300 and only do is
just block out people talking.

154
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,150
It actually sounds great. If I hit a
fucking pair of those on right now,

155
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:04,730
then I wouldn't hear those kids crying. I
don't know what it is. No idea. Anyways,

156
00:10:04,731 --> 00:10:06,680
so what I'm trying to say is
happy father's day, everybody

157
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:12,740
happy belated father's Day.
You know,

158
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,130
did you get your dad a man?
Great. So he knows that you care.

159
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,910
You know, man, fucking hilarious.
They just advertise once a year.

160
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,360
Like your dad only wants steak house
quality once a fucking once a year.

161
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:32,340
That's it. You know, I called up, uh,

162
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,760
a bunch of my friends who are dads
and I was just like, hey, you know,

163
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:42,240
happy father's Day. What are you doing
today? And they'll be that guy, you know,

164
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:46,460
mom working in the yard.
Oh, you know, again, uh,

165
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:51,070
putting up a shelf for some, I'm like, no,
what are you doing, you know, for your,

166
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,650
your sort of birthday here is,

167
00:10:54,651 --> 00:10:57,890
it's father's Day in every one of them.
Just,

168
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,530
it was just one shitty thing
after another. It's like,

169
00:11:00,531 --> 00:11:02,780
now you guys are going out
to like a teddy bar. None.

170
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:06,980
He had gone to a ball game
just out in the fucking yard.

171
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:12,900
I don't know what the, I
don't get that. You know,

172
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:15,310
Mother's Day don't you take her
out for a little eggs benedict.

173
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:20,630
You get us of flowers.
I feel bad for the dads out there.

174
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:27,050
What could you do? You know, even
if there's a steak, I mean, God,

175
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:29,780
God knows you got to go
out and go make it right.

176
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:35,140
Unless you Paul Versey puffers. He
doesn't fuck with his grill. Sound real.

177
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,360
I went over his house one time,
you know,

178
00:11:37,361 --> 00:11:42,280
we were having burgers and he didn't
even make them. They can't have that man.

179
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:45,760
You can't have somebody else,
man. And you're fucking grill.

180
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,450
Okay.

181
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:48,800
I mean, what happens next? You know,

182
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:54,880
you let a man come over your house and
he cooks on your grill and you're not

183
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:55,960
cooking on it.
I mean,

184
00:11:55,990 --> 00:12:00,010
within five minutes he's going to be
slow dancing with your wife. He can't,

185
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:00,903
I don't even,

186
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,920
I don't even care if you suck at it. I
mean, it's not that hard. Get good at it.

187
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:13,570
Right. Just make a couple
of Burgers, some hotdogs.

188
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:19,750
Jesus Christ version. Um, you know, it's
funny as later on today we'll be like,

189
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:23,620
ah, dude. Did you see it in
cocoa? My, I don't I fucking
cock domain. No, you didn't.

190
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:28,930
You didn't. Um, anyway, so this
is the Monday morning podcast is,

191
00:12:28,931 --> 00:12:32,290
we're working our way through
June, um, me and Barton and Bart.

192
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:37,180
Nick is absolutely fucking destroying
in front of me. Man. It's great.

193
00:12:37,181 --> 00:12:41,620
It's making me have better sets
because a student is bringing the heat,

194
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:46,030
he's bringing the fire.
Um,

195
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:52,430
he's just one of my favorite comics. I'm
going to leave it. That fucking guy, just,

196
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,020
he's, it's, his act is just so blunt.

197
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:01,090
And even when he talks, he
just gets right to it. And, uh,

198
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:05,500
I can't even say half to shit. He says,
cause it's so fucking politically correct.

199
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,070
But he talked to me about,
I forget what he's worked in some places,

200
00:13:09,071 --> 00:13:14,071
some biker came in with all his biker
buddies and in one of them peeled off from

201
00:13:14,321 --> 00:13:18,010
wanting to go into this room and Joe
was like, yeah, you can't go in here.

202
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,590
And the guy was like, oh, I
can't go in there. And Joe just,

203
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:25,360
Joe has a way of like, uh, you know,

204
00:13:25,361 --> 00:13:29,500
just having a look on his face where all
the emotion goes away and it makes you

205
00:13:29,501 --> 00:13:30,850
fucking blood run cold.

206
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,700
So he's telling the story and he
goes to the bike and goes, oh,

207
00:13:33,701 --> 00:13:37,840
I can't go in there. And then Joe
just makes that face and goes, no,

208
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,790
you can't go in there.
And he said,

209
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:43,810
him and the biker guy was staring at
each other and then the biker dude back

210
00:13:43,811 --> 00:13:48,810
down. And he was just like,
all I was thinking was, uh,

211
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,820
you know,
hey dude,

212
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:56,850
I can go back to Pittsburgh and make
pizzas while you pussy biker friends of

213
00:13:58,481 --> 00:13:59,560
putting you in the ground.

214
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:05,950
I left out a couple of words of,

215
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,880
Oh my God, he said that shit and I
think I came in with a fuck we wore.

216
00:14:10,881 --> 00:14:13,660
It was me and somebody else just,
we'll fucking crying,

217
00:14:13,661 --> 00:14:18,160
laughing and Joe sitting
there still deadpan like what?

218
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:22,270
Like he went into that mindset. I don't
think I've ever thought I had thought.

219
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:26,860
I don't, I don't remember a
time anybody threatened my life,

220
00:14:26,861 --> 00:14:30,130
but if they had that look
on their face that Joe had,

221
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:34,330
there's no fucking way I wouldn't. I
went back down to, I'd be, I go, okay.

222
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:40,060
He later walked in with my biker jacket
over my forearm. Like a gentleman,

223
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,460
you know, Jesus Christ. People got
tattoos in northern California.

224
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,530
My God, I saw this woman,
she was so tatted up.

225
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:53,240
It went all the way up
her neck and then like,

226
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:57,710
you know when they go beyond the neck
but not quite there face, what do,

227
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:01,580
what does that party if you face
between your neck and your chin?

228
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:05,150
It's like the Tanti your
face, you know? Is that all,

229
00:15:05,151 --> 00:15:07,580
I mean I get Chin is that thing
right in the front, right?

230
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,200
Jesus Christ bill taken an anatomy
class. Oh fuck you. What is it?

231
00:15:12,201 --> 00:15:13,010
What is the underneath?

232
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:15,250
Is that still part of the neck
or is that part of the chin?

233
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:20,020
What would you say that you put the
gun right under his fucking chin. Yeah,

234
00:15:20,021 --> 00:15:24,040
I guess that's be Your Chin, right?
I don't fucking know. Anyways,

235
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:29,050
she was tatted right up to where if
he had a cleft chin, it stopped there.

236
00:15:29,051 --> 00:15:31,540
And right along her face too.
You know,

237
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,880
like when somebody has a
really neatly trimmed beard,

238
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:39,370
it literally looked like she
was slowly drowning and tattoos.

239
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,420
Like if you stared at her long enough
it was going to move up another inch and

240
00:15:44,421 --> 00:15:45,550
she was going to start panicking,

241
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:48,920
worrying if she was still going
to be able to breathe. Um,

242
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,041
do you know,

243
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:55,240
don't really is normal now is actually
to have a tattoo on your face.

244
00:15:55,241 --> 00:15:56,260
It's not as shocking.

245
00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:00,190
The only time we used to see it was
back in the day when you watch national

246
00:16:00,191 --> 00:16:04,630
geographic and there's some
tribe down in South America,

247
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:08,860
they just draw all over each other's face,
you know,

248
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:14,020
worse than like prison tattoos. It
looks like Morse Code, you know,

249
00:16:14,021 --> 00:16:18,220
or like a what are those things you
had before there was the internet.

250
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:22,960
He had crossword puzzles and mazes get
through the maze and you drew like a

251
00:16:22,961 --> 00:16:27,190
pencil on it so they'd just like the
drum maze on their fucking face. Um,

252
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:33,910
I just saw a lot like chicks with just
fucking giant pieces. I believe them.

253
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:37,900
They call them all up and
down their, their, their arms.

254
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,890
It's like everybody out here plays in
good Charlotte or something. I don't,

255
00:16:41,891 --> 00:16:45,310
I don't understand it. They're great
people. Good looking people too.

256
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:50,310
Good looking broads up here in northern
California. I got to get you this a,

257
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,730
I know I'm all over the place. I don't
give a fuck. I got to get you this,

258
00:16:52,731 --> 00:16:55,150
this picture of this guy,
um,

259
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:01,720
who had a tattoo of his baby's
face put on the side of his face.

260
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:03,403
Yeah.

261
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:10,810
And like part of it like went in, covered
up part of his ear, like where the,

262
00:17:10,811 --> 00:17:15,550
and then it was also really dark. I
didn't get it. I mean it was a white baby.

263
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:20,230
It's like why is this thing so dark?
It was like, it looked like a baby.

264
00:17:20,231 --> 00:17:24,850
That was like, if it was
me as a baby, but for some,

265
00:17:24,851 --> 00:17:28,180
I dunno, kids stuck his head in the
fireplace. It's like just the worst.

266
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:33,100
So where's fucking tattoo I've ever seen
in my life and this guys go and check

267
00:17:33,101 --> 00:17:37,660
it out, man. Check out my new ink.
Mainly we look at this man puts tattoo

268
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,750
sewn on Facebook. I love,
I love Facebook man.

269
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:47,170
That's when you know you're old. When
you like Facebook and all the kids look,

270
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:50,240
Ooh, fucking Facebook. So
lame. Good. Get out of here.

271
00:17:50,241 --> 00:17:52,190
You fucking punk and want you around here.
Anyways,

272
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:56,450
the dumb stories thinking you're
lived life. You haven't. All right,

273
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:58,760
you fucking dope.
I'm actually that old now.

274
00:17:58,761 --> 00:18:02,090
When I look at people in their 20s like
college age kids and I just think I have

275
00:18:02,091 --> 00:18:06,860
what a bunch of fucking dopes
when they drink the way they behave.

276
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:11,300
I used to think I was a maniac dude. I'm
fucking crazy. It's like, no I wasn't.

277
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:13,230
I was some nerd who couldn't handle the,

278
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:18,110
the freedom of not being
around his parents anymore
as experiencing that for the

279
00:18:18,111 --> 00:18:19,340
first time.
Oh,

280
00:18:19,341 --> 00:18:22,430
I'm going to get drunk and jump off
something so that chick over there thinks

281
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:26,930
I'm funny or crazy and then maybe
she'll blow me like really bill,

282
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,570
that was she game plan.
All right man.

283
00:18:29,571 --> 00:18:33,470
Puts Tattoo a baby's face on his face.

284
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,240
Probably be like 20 different pictures
of some dummy doing this. There it is.

285
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:43,220
There it is. Yeah. And
he's holding his baby.

286
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:48,860
He's got a white baby, Eh, this, this
baby looks like, I dunno. It's weird.

287
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:50,740
It looks like the baby is a yeah.

288
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,520
Coming out of [inaudible]

289
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,990
fireplace, you know, face
maybe a little on fire.

290
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:00,790
What a fucking,
why would you do that?

291
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,200
Wait,
where could that guy get?

292
00:19:05,201 --> 00:19:08,470
He couldn't even get a job in
a fucking nursery like glove.

293
00:19:08,471 --> 00:19:13,120
Look how much I love babies, but none,
none. Not in a structural way. Jesus,

294
00:19:13,121 --> 00:19:15,910
I just yelled at and they have babies
next door. Oh, they can't hear me?

295
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:18,880
Of course they can hear you bill.
Their kids aren't yelling that loud.

296
00:19:18,881 --> 00:19:23,440
You can hear them right now. Jesus. Well,

297
00:19:23,441 --> 00:19:27,190
this would be my evidence. Bright if they
came in. Why are you talking about? Uh,

298
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:31,360
I can't remember what
the fuck I just said. Oh,

299
00:19:31,361 --> 00:19:34,570
not in a sexual way while you're talking
about babies in a sexual way. I be like,

300
00:19:34,571 --> 00:19:34,751
no.

301
00:19:34,751 --> 00:19:39,751
I actually did a podcast officer here
at listened to him and then he takes my

302
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:44,470
device and just a racist at
some crooked cop.

303
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:48,720
All right. I didn't know what the
fuck I'm talking about here. Um,

304
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:53,590
I wrote about 19 minutes and I think it's
time to listen to bill. Read out loud.

305
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,720
What do you guys think? Huh? What are you

306
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,530
all right.
Hey,

307
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:02,890
my batteries died so I had to go to
the front desk and go get some more

308
00:20:02,891 --> 00:20:05,640
batteries.
That every level high.

309
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:09,310
That's what the record says because he
has the English lady in there because it

310
00:20:09,311 --> 00:20:13,450
makes your device more
classy. So this, uh,

311
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:19,770
lady Butler that's in my recorder
kept going back every level medium.

312
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:22,660
So I'm thinking it's going
to, you know. All right,

313
00:20:22,661 --> 00:20:26,680
well I don't have to worry about anything
until fucking Queen Elizabeth goes bat

314
00:20:26,681 --> 00:20:28,960
every level low.
And then I was going to buy batteries,

315
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,590
but this shit went from battery
level high to battery level,

316
00:20:32,591 --> 00:20:36,040
medium to just shutting off.
You know what I mean?

317
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,540
It's like when somebody, you know, just
gets divorced out of fucking nowhere.

318
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:43,780
And like, I thought they were getting
along, Craig. Not a nowhere. We just,

319
00:20:43,781 --> 00:20:47,620
we decided to go our separate ways.
Did you?

320
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:53,310
Well, that's good. Good for
you. Good on you. All right.
So anyways, let's get to the,

321
00:20:53,311 --> 00:20:56,820
uh, let's listen to me read out loud. Oh,
here we go. Hold me undies. Me undies.

322
00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:00,120
I got to sing this quietly because
it's fucking kids next door.

323
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:03,690
[inaudible] undies put
'em on your fucking whore.

324
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:09,110
If you balls are wet they won't be
anymore cause you put on this shit dead a,

325
00:21:09,991 --> 00:21:11,220
you're going out the door.

326
00:21:11,221 --> 00:21:15,210
Your balls is swing in from left and
right but they feel real comfortable.

327
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,260
Oh yeah,
they even got him for your claim.

328
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,460
But booboo you don't me
undies is actually using that.

329
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:24,390
No more sweaty balls and people look,
are you getting money for that?

330
00:21:24,391 --> 00:21:28,590
Of course I'm not.
Why would they pay me for that?

331
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:31,560
You know I'm singing like a,

332
00:21:31,561 --> 00:21:34,320
you can get anything you
want at Alice's restaurant.

333
00:21:34,321 --> 00:21:38,010
I should be getting fucking
sued by a Arlo Guthrie.

334
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:41,280
Whoever wrote that fucking
song. All right. 90% people.

335
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:44,580
That's the percent of your life
that you spend in your underwear.

336
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:48,450
Unless you're Matthew mcconaughey and
then it's like 2% I don't think he has his

337
00:21:48,451 --> 00:21:51,840
underwear and his ball sweaty.
Who knows?

338
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,840
He's got that goofy look on his
face. Maybe they are. I don't know.

339
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:59,720
I don't pretend to know about his scrotum.
I only know is,

340
00:21:59,721 --> 00:22:01,140
I bet they're tanned up real nice.

341
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,710
Oh Shit.
I bet.

342
00:22:08,711 --> 00:22:11,680
Do you think anybody's putting any botox
and then ball bag yet to make it nice

343
00:22:11,681 --> 00:22:15,250
and smooth anyways,
underwear, it gets old fast.

344
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:18,250
You know that feeling of
putting on old saggy underwear,

345
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:22,240
you need to know the feeling of putting
on Greg fitting underwear that's two

346
00:22:22,241 --> 00:22:23,710
times softer than cotton.

347
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:27,040
I'm still waiting from the
rebuttal from the cotton people.

348
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,420
You need to know about me undies Dotcom,
me,

349
00:22:29,421 --> 00:22:34,330
Andy says the most comfortable underwear
you will ever try on and it's insane

350
00:22:34,331 --> 00:22:38,560
how good they make your balls feel.
They fit perfectly. Just Cup them.

351
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:43,950
They don't ride up on you
and they literally pull
moisture rows away from your

352
00:22:44,201 --> 00:22:47,920
skin. See a steak? Cool.
I don't understand that.

353
00:22:47,921 --> 00:22:50,980
The purpose of sweating
is to cool down your body.

354
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:54,220
How about you don't feel bad
because you don't have swamp ass.

355
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:59,590
I guess that's a little grocer. All right,
so you stay cool. We'll go with that.

356
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,590
But you know something.
They also make you look great.

357
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:07,060
Go to [inaudible] dot com and check
out the photography and for the ladies,

358
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:09,730
checkout those smoking hot boy shorts,

359
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:14,450
but you have to try them on for yourself.
This quality would typically read. Yeah,

360
00:23:14,451 --> 00:23:17,440
to see how they look on your ass
as opposed to the models. Right?

361
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:19,390
Everybody has to do that.
You know what I mean?

362
00:23:19,391 --> 00:23:21,390
It's like the guys Calvin
Klein underwear where they,

363
00:23:21,391 --> 00:23:24,490
the dude on the package has
the abs and then you put it on,

364
00:23:24,491 --> 00:23:27,490
you get your fucking man muffin
top going on and you're like, well,

365
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:30,250
I thought it was going to
look like Mark Walberg there.

366
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:34,640
And instead I look like if
I drive a garbage truck, um,

367
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:38,350
this quality would typically retail
for two times to me, undies, price,

368
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:41,770
no retail middleman means
more savings to you.

369
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,660
Here we will make it easy.

370
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:48,170
Go to [inaudible] dot com slash and get
20% off your first order and low flat

372
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:54,620

with them or your first pair is free.

373
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,640
Once you feel me undies up against your
balls, you never going back and me,

374
00:23:58,641 --> 00:24:02,090
Andy's isn't just for guys. If he didn't
fucking listen to two paragraphs ago,

375
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:06,620
they just launched their, all
of me. Why not take all of me.

376
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,890
There's that clam and it's dry and

377
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,210
cool.

378
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:14,950
Go down on her.

379
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:20,400
It's like eaten those fucking meant
that you get only at the movies.

380
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:26,160
All of me women's collection, I couldn't
remember. I kept thinking juicy fruit.

381
00:24:26,161 --> 00:24:27,460

384
00:24:32,321 --> 00:24:34,600
I want to kill myself.
Junior mints, right?

385
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:39,370
A four piece line of undies designed

price. Still not getting it. You

That's for somebody with back hair.

00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:35,710
They got to shave like just during
the day as they're talking to you.

400
00:25:35,711 --> 00:25:40,711
They just keep shaving a the four blade

quality stuff. Got that weight to it,

404
00:25:51,271 --> 00:25:54,670

expensive ones you've used before.

00:25:54,671 --> 00:25:58,180
The humble twin has to stainless
steel blades and an aloe strip.

406
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:02,320
That's all you need. You've never gotten
a shave like this after that first box.

407
00:26:02,321 --> 00:26:06,040

437
00:27:48,911 --> 00:27:53,200
What else did I want to talk
about this week? I, by the way,

438
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:58,630
that fucking horrible tragedy,
that Douche shooting up the, uh,

439
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:02,140
the church.
Can Somebody please explain to me?

440
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:05,080
I don't understand this as a white person.

441
00:28:05,081 --> 00:28:08,380
Why are white people trying to
act like that wasn't a racist act.

442
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:09,860
Okay.

443
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:13,280
I mean, did he have to have, I'm a racist,
tattooed across his fucking forehead.

444
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:19,280
What else? Why? Why? I just,
I hate when people fucking,

445
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,230
they look at their race like it's a team.
You know what I mean?

446
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:27,590
It's like me when I defend Tom
Brady and you guys all go out.

447
00:28:27,591 --> 00:28:30,290
If it was on the other fucking way,
they know Andrew luck did it.

448
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:33,500
You'll be shitting on him. Right?
I'd like to think I wouldn't be,

449
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,480
but people do that with like race.

450
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:39,950
So because like they say in this racist
White Dude is racist and somehow they

451
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:43,670
say in your racist and not saying you're
racist, you fucking moron. He's a racist.

452
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:49,300
And why people stop fucking acting like
you don't know racist white people.

453
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:50,670
Okay.

454
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:54,060
You know that guy at the cookout who
out of gets a couple of beers in him and

455
00:28:54,061 --> 00:28:57,130
starts dropping the n word and then you've
got to be, hey, hey, take it easy clock.

456
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:00,150
Come on. I try to have a good time
here. Right, that fucking guy.

457
00:29:00,151 --> 00:29:02,160
And then hopefully you
don't ever invite him again.

458
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:04,830
Why are you acting like those
fucking people don't exist?

459
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:07,680
You know that that guy's a
racist at your fucking cookout.

460
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:10,380
And all he did was dropped again,
word while he was eating a cheeseburger.

461
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:14,370
This fucking guy went into that church
specifically to kill black people cause

462
00:29:14,371 --> 00:29:17,700
he hated black people. I mean,
what, what the fuck mortar you need?

463
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:22,720
There was like nine shows. If I had any
hair left that would have tore it out.

464
00:29:22,721 --> 00:29:26,380
Watching them going, what the fuck
are you trying to defend? Sorry.

465
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:30,400
None of that was funny, but it
was fucking true. Um, anyways,

466
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:36,230
getting back to the podcast here,
I saw this article on, uh, uh,

467
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:41,200
Jesus. Then I get rid of it. Where is
it? There it is. This fucking guy who it,

468
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:46,180
who was evidently the 970th
member of guns and roses.

469
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:50,710
And I know, even though I'm making
fun of that fucking band, you know,

470
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,200
I don't even make in front of the
band like the musicians think.

471
00:29:53,201 --> 00:29:56,560
It's just the fact that they're still
calling it guns and roses. Right.

472
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:00,190
That would be like if you
bought Mcdonald's and you fired,

473
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:02,710
you fired that fucking clown
and you're still going. Yeah.

474
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:06,520
And you fired the grimace
and the hamburglar and you
got rid mayor mccheese none

475
00:30:06,521 --> 00:30:09,130
of them were there anymore. But like, uh,

476
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:14,710
I dunno the fucking one of them. One of
the grimace stuck around. No you don't.

477
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:18,700
Ronald McDonald did. Cause
Axel is a fucking red hat. Um,

478
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,700
and you, you still acting like it's this
band of brothers, whatever. So anyways,

479
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:29,720
is this article by um,

480
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:32,350
the 9000th guitarist and guitarist,

481
00:30:32,351 --> 00:30:37,040
the guy's Dj ash ba and it says DJ,
but guns and roses guitarist,

482
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:42,070
Dj ash ba claims his aunt and uncle
invented technology for aerosol cans.

483
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:47,470
All right. Uh, guns and
roses and 6:00 AM Nikki Sixx,

484
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:48,820
his band guitarist.

485
00:30:48,821 --> 00:30:53,170
Dj Asheville was interviewed by
Sweetwater editorial director,

486
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:57,340
Mitch Gallagher. Duh Duh Duh Duh, Duh.
Here's what he said. Ashleigh says,

487
00:30:57,341 --> 00:31:02,341
who owns a company centered around media
and advertising that runs various other

488
00:31:02,501 --> 00:31:05,380
countries, was asked, what
takes him in those directions?

489
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:08,620
He responds now basically they
wrote exactly what he said,

490
00:31:08,621 --> 00:31:11,710
so I'm gonna maybe fuck up the emotion
of this thing. But basically he said,

491
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:14,620
you know, I don't know. I've
always had that creative bone.

492
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:18,130
My aunt and uncle invented the
technology for aerosol cans.

493
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:21,940
So ever since I was young. Dot. Dot. Dot.

494
00:31:21,941 --> 00:31:24,670
They came out with a product when
I was really young called Pam.

495
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:29,110
That's like a buttery spray.
And I've always kind of
grew up in that environment.

496
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,460
I thought outside the box,

497
00:31:30,461 --> 00:31:34,270
and it really taught me that it's better
to create your own job then to work

498
00:31:34,271 --> 00:31:38,800
nine to five. So that's what's always
been my mindset. I just love creating.

499
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:43,510
Ashleigh also talked about his belief
that musicians should diversify and have a

500
00:31:43,511 --> 00:31:45,610
backup plan.
He said,

501
00:31:45,611 --> 00:31:49,990
I absolutely will always stand by that
if you put all your eggs in one baskets,

502
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:53,500
all you got to do is drop them and they're
going to break and every one of them

503
00:31:53,501 --> 00:31:56,080
will break. But the whole
thing. Dot, dot. Dot.

504
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:59,170
And I've learned this from
6:00 AM band mate, Nikki Sixx.

505
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:04,330
It's like you set up buckets is set up
buckets, little incomes coming in there,

506
00:32:04,331 --> 00:32:09,190
there, there, there, there.
And as a whole, that's how
you interact with this one.

507
00:32:09,191 --> 00:32:10,570
Jesus Christ.
This is getting difficult.

508
00:32:10,571 --> 00:32:12,400
If three buckets aren't
doing well this month,

509
00:32:12,401 --> 00:32:15,820
but the other ones are you going
to be fine. So it's diversifying.

510
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:20,020
But if you put all your eggs in one bucket
and you have five months of, you know,

511
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:24,850
things aren't going that well that
could spill all your eggs right now.

512
00:32:24,851 --> 00:32:27,520
What the fucking guy said in there,
I'm telling you,

513
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,000
is the key to freedom and making
your money work for yourself.

514
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:37,180
So I'm looking at the comments and
everybody's just shitting on him.

515
00:32:37,181 --> 00:32:41,180
Next thing you know, he'll be telling
us he invented whippets so many roads.

516
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:45,560
So the fuck what I guess said some
new cool way of saying what the fuck.

517
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:50,450
And somebody wrote any invented
huffing aerosol cans. Uh,

518
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,730
I would like to salute
auntie and uncle ash,

519
00:32:52,731 --> 00:32:57,680
but for making it possible for me to get
high on the cheap during my turbulent

520
00:32:57,681 --> 00:33:00,740
and troublesome teen years,
uh,

521
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:02,780
by a real shirt.

522
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:08,750
So his aunt and uncle are responsible
for the deaths of countless insects for

523
00:33:08,751 --> 00:33:10,310
screwing up the ozone layer.

524
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:14,540
And even worse for all the horrible
hairstyles of the eighties. Congrats.

525
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:19,950
Someone writes, this guy is
the ultimate poser. It's it.

526
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:22,220
Everybody just shits all over them.
Now,

527
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:25,490
I don't think he'd really fucking meant
era. So I think he just invented Pam.

528
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,680
I don't know what,
but in the middle of all that,

529
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:32,710
he said some brilliant shit about,
hey,

530
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:36,410
this guy's made it as a guitarist.
Right?

531
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:39,860
But then he started these business on
the side with the money that he's made.

532
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:43,610
So if the next album doesn't do well,
his business is doing well.

533
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,890
And this is thing. And, and you
know, I've found being a comedian,

534
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:52,520
people always say that, hey, you know,
if you have a fucking backup plan,

535
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:57,180
you're not going to go 100% as a comedian.
And I kind of bought into that Af,

536
00:33:58,010 --> 00:33:59,210
you know,
early on.

537
00:33:59,211 --> 00:34:04,211
But the reality is is you can
make all this money as a comedian,

538
00:34:04,941 --> 00:34:07,640
as a guitarist is whatever you're doing.

539
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:11,480
But then you can take that money
and start other shit. You know,

540
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,950
I got this stupid ass podcast,

541
00:34:12,951 --> 00:34:16,190
I got some money coming in from the
fucking advertising, I do my standup,

542
00:34:16,191 --> 00:34:20,070
I got money coming in from that and now
I'm, I'm looking at, okay, maybe I'll,

543
00:34:20,071 --> 00:34:23,920
I'll take this money and go
buy an apartment building
and become a fucking slum

544
00:34:23,921 --> 00:34:28,100
Lord. And then when I'm in like 70 if
I own enough of those fucking things,

545
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:30,530
I don't have to go on the road.
Or if people are just like, oh,

546
00:34:30,531 --> 00:34:34,280
he's fed old freckled fuck, he's been
talking about the same shit for 50 years,

547
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:38,030
fuck him. And I go back down
to plain in front of 30 people.

548
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:42,260
I can still do it because I love it,
but I won't become destitute.

549
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:47,540
And this guy is like giving you this
information for fucking free and everybody

550
00:34:47,541 --> 00:34:50,480
just shits all over.
I don't know.

551
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:56,320
I found it really a really inspiring
and I'm a combination of that.

552
00:34:57,441 --> 00:35:01,010
And I also, um, I was reading this thing,

553
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:04,190
I'm going to fuck up the guy's name.
I think his name is Nick Offerman.

554
00:35:04,191 --> 00:35:06,790
That guy from that show.
Um,

555
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:11,320
you know where every parks and recs,
the guy looks like an older, uh,

556
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:14,870
Zach Galifianakis. You know, and
he's funny. He's fucking hell.

557
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:19,570
He does a lot of voiceover cartoon shit.
Why don't you just look it up built?

558
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,800
Cause you know what?
I got my fucking hands full right now.

559
00:35:21,801 --> 00:35:23,360
I'm holding the recorder
and I got my phone,

560
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:28,870
but he had this great article and I'm
going to read this to you guys here.

561
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:34,370
It said, what, what is the best
advice you ever received? And he said,

562
00:35:34,371 --> 00:35:38,790
I had this amazing teacher in college,
my Sensei in the Kabuki theater.

563
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:42,390
And I thought that that was
one of the women, you know,
fucking put on the makeup.

564
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,920
Right? And they gave you a hand job in the
end. I have no fucking idea. Anyways, um,

565
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,270
name shows. Oh Satco it probably
fucked up his name for me.

566
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,730
He was between Misdemeanor
Oggie and Obi wan Kenobi.

567
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,550
He told me to always maintain
the attitude of a student.

568
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,480
No matter how old you are, wake
up in the morning and think, okay,

569
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:03,390
how am I going to better myself?
Am I going to improve my French?

570
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:05,570
Am I going to get my wife a good back rub?

571
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:08,520
Then you can go to bed
having tried something.

572
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:13,080
It's led to a life that is more fruitful
than if you have the mindset of being a

573
00:36:13,081 --> 00:36:15,240
master.
Once you think you're the master,

574
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:19,350
then you grow bitter waiting for someone
to throw you a parade because she's so

575
00:36:19,351 --> 00:36:23,580
fucking smart. He didn't say fucking
smart, but those two things right there,

576
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:27,960
right there. You know what I mean? I
hope you got something out of that.

577
00:36:27,961 --> 00:36:32,550
I have no fucking idea. But um,
that's the way he should go.

578
00:36:32,551 --> 00:36:35,520
But if you play guitar, whatever the
fuck you do, you think that, yeah, dude,

579
00:36:35,521 --> 00:36:39,420
I'm the shit. Then you stop growing and
then these young bucks run you down.

580
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:44,790
I'm basically saying people that even
though I can tell a shit joke at the level

581
00:36:44,791 --> 00:36:49,680
that I can, I never stopped trying to
find a better way to tell that shit joke.

582
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,240
What if I squatted down and really
tried to take a shit on stage? I mean,

583
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:58,680
those are the kinds of things
I'm making fun of it,

584
00:36:58,681 --> 00:37:02,070
but I really got inspired by both
of those things. So they got not,

585
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:04,810
I can't always be sitting here on the
podcast screaming. [inaudible] Kenny.

586
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:10,410
All right, let's add, let's do some adding
here. I did 19 minutes and 17, 19 and 17.

587
00:37:10,411 --> 00:37:14,500
His fucking 38 minutes. I already
got another 22. Here we go. Um,

588
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:18,870
all right. What the fuck was I
did I want to talk about here? Oh,

589
00:37:18,871 --> 00:37:23,220
so we went to Reno,
the biggest little town in America,

590
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:27,930
and uh, that was one of the rowdiest
fucking crowds I performed in front of,

591
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,640
in a long time.

592
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,290
And it kind of surprised me because
the last time I came to reno,

593
00:37:34,291 --> 00:37:38,760
they weren't like that. But what
happened was, is we pulled in to Reno,

594
00:37:38,761 --> 00:37:43,350
which I fucking love that city,
right? We pulled in and we just,

595
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:46,220
I'll see all these people in the street.
They had closed off the street.

596
00:37:46,221 --> 00:37:49,260
We had to try to figure out how
to get the bus around. And uh,

597
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:53,970
they had this festival out there.
It was Bruce Blues and BBQ.

598
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:57,000
They should've said BBQs,
you know,

599
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:59,340
like you're getting more than
one barbecue just so it rhymes.

600
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:03,420
Bruce Blues and Bbq spot. It
was bloop bruise, blues and Bbq.

601
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,560
And I swear to God,

602
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:08,490
this shit show that was
walking around out in the sun,

603
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:13,020
the tattooed fucking shit show of
people walking around hammered,

604
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:14,131
you know,

605
00:38:14,131 --> 00:38:18,810
parents who let their fucking inlaws
watched the kids and they're down.

606
00:38:18,811 --> 00:38:22,080
They're sunburned.
Busan eaten barbecue.

607
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:24,510
Me and bargaining comedian would
just like, oh, this barbecue.

608
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:29,490
We got to fucking go. And we go down
there and people were fucking shit faced.

609
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:33,810
Well on their way to getting shit faced.
I saw some lady in the sun,

610
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:37,690
right sitting at this table with
their head down, like, you know,

611
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:40,840
you know when he came in from outdoor
recess and everybody was all amped up from

612
00:38:40,841 --> 00:38:41,651
the sugar and salt,

613
00:38:41,651 --> 00:38:45,310
you'd put in your bodies during lunch
and you came in and the teacher would be

614
00:38:45,311 --> 00:38:47,770
like, all right, everybody put
your heads down on the desk.

615
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,870
Let's just take a little nap here.

616
00:38:49,871 --> 00:38:53,980
Let's fucking relax so you're not bouncing
off the walls is I try to teach you

617
00:38:53,981 --> 00:38:56,890
some phonics here. That's what she
looked like. And she was, I mean,

618
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:01,900
there was like two in the afternoon, so
me and Barnick or going like, all right,

619
00:39:01,901 --> 00:39:04,960
let's get some barbecue.
Took us forever to find out where it was.

620
00:39:04,961 --> 00:39:08,190
And then when we found it, if had
this ridiculously long line in Barton,

621
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,750
Mexican may gone do it. I don't
want to fucking stand in that line.

622
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:15,130
And I was like, yeah, fuck that. Let's not
stand. But then it seemed to be moving.

623
00:39:15,131 --> 00:39:19,510
So we were like, fuck it. So
we stood in the line and, uh,

624
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:23,860
the barbecue was unbelievable.
One of the best briskets I ever had.

625
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,290
And I was sitting there going,
all right, I've been eating right.

626
00:39:26,291 --> 00:39:29,560
I've been doing catio every day.
Um,

627
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,620
let's just pick one meat.
All right.

628
00:39:32,621 --> 00:39:36,490
Either get the ribs to pull
pork or the fucking brisket.

629
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:40,000
And uh, you know, I was
starving. You know how that goes.

630
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:44,650
You Get up there and your
brain is telling you, you know,

631
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:49,540
just get the pulled pork, but just
get the ribs, you know, but the demon,

632
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:53,020
the sugar salt demon that's running
through your veins goes get all three.

633
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:55,840
And who do you give into you given
to the addiction? So I go, all right,

634
00:39:55,841 --> 00:39:56,380
let me get,

635
00:39:56,380 --> 00:40:00,370
let me get all three and some coleslaw
and one of those little fucking Jalapeno

636
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:05,260
cornbread. Thanks. So,
um, we fucking, you know,

637
00:40:05,261 --> 00:40:06,760
I'm in front of Barnick,

638
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:12,270
I get all my shit and I get a lemonade
and I see this table with his two people

639
00:40:12,461 --> 00:40:15,850
already sit in there, but there's an
umbrella in some shade. And you know,

640
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:19,000
I'm a redhead, so I'm one degree
away from a fucking albino.

641
00:40:19,001 --> 00:40:22,360
So I beelined towards that
and I sit down. I said, Hey,

642
00:40:22,361 --> 00:40:24,460
do you guys mind if we sit
here and this guy's like,

643
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:29,500
you know the cost you fucking eight
bucks. That's crazy. Fucking laugh.

644
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:34,000
And he's missing number eight.
Okay,

645
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:38,820
you got two teeth down front. Eight
nine going from right to left. Um,

646
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:43,390
he was missing number eight.
No, I'm sorry, number nine.
He was facing me. Sorry.

647
00:40:43,391 --> 00:40:47,740
That's my dental office days. And
I didn't give a fuck. I was just,

648
00:40:47,741 --> 00:40:51,310
I rolled with dead jokes,
you know, I was like, Oh man,

649
00:40:51,311 --> 00:40:54,010
I'll give it to you in a check. He
goes, Nah, I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

650
00:40:54,011 --> 00:40:58,870
It's only six bucks. [inaudible]
fucking crazy laugh missing a tooth.

651
00:40:58,871 --> 00:41:01,540
And at that point Barton and
sits down and he's got that,

652
00:41:01,541 --> 00:41:03,760
I'm going to murder a biker.
Look on his face.

653
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:08,500
And he just looks at me and he goes and
they're like trying to joke with him and

654
00:41:08,501 --> 00:41:10,750
he completely ignores him and
he looks at me and he goes,

655
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:15,010
there's a tent over
there. And I go, Oh yeah.

656
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,910
And cause now it's all awkward cause he's
not interacting with these people who

657
00:41:18,911 --> 00:41:22,390
are hammered telling the worst jokes ever.
And I'm pretending like they're funny.

658
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:25,540
And Joe goes, is a tent right
over there? And I just go, oh,

659
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:27,820
you want to go sit over there
instead? And he goes, yeah.

660
00:41:27,821 --> 00:41:32,560
And he stands up and I like a little
kid, just go, okay guys, see Ya.

661
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:36,920
And walked over there. I started
laughing, I go, Jesus Christ. And he goes,

662
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:40,010
and he just goes by, Nick does this thing
where he just sort of puts his hand up,

663
00:41:40,011 --> 00:41:43,460
one of his hands up. He goes, dude,
I want to enjoy my meal. Okay,

664
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:47,300
I don't want to sit there, talk to
her that, what did he call them?

665
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:49,820
Methy or something like that
with this missing tooth.

666
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,410
I just want to sit here and enjoy it.

667
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:55,160
And then we sat down at this other
fucking table and it was actually great.

668
00:41:55,161 --> 00:41:59,990
We actually, where we sat there was
like a breeze and all this thing. Um,

669
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:05,050
and the fucking barbecue
is delicious. And, um,

670
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:09,920
I looked across the parking lot and
there was this little coffee shop,

671
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:11,210
little tiny coffee shop,

672
00:42:11,211 --> 00:42:15,320
looked like there was enough room in
there for someone to stand and have a

673
00:42:15,321 --> 00:42:19,130
coffee maker, little coffee shop
and you know, it was called,

674
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,620
it was called Pony Express.
So,

675
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,010
and my wife loves word place.

676
00:42:26,011 --> 00:42:29,450
So immediately I took a picture
of it and I called her up,

677
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:31,423
you know,

678
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:33,950
and I been on the road for a little while
so she gets a little grumpy when I'm

679
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:35,770
gone that long.
Um,

680
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:39,200
which is funny cause when I get home then
she gets grumpy when I'm home for five

681
00:42:39,201 --> 00:42:41,720
days. I'm a really annoying person.
So what I'm trying to tell you,

682
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:46,160
so I called her up and I told her
that joke and she fucking lost it.

683
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:50,270
I don't know why she loves wordplay,
but it's my,

684
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:53,990
one of my favorite things to do is when
I see some dumb word wordplay business

685
00:42:53,991 --> 00:42:58,640
sign, I call her up. And every
once in a while something gets her.

686
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:01,400
And she likes horses.
If she thinks ponies acute.

687
00:43:01,401 --> 00:43:03,110
And she just thought it
was the cutest name ever.

688
00:43:03,111 --> 00:43:08,111
And she fucking laughs for like five
minutes making me laugh as I'm sitting at

689
00:43:08,241 --> 00:43:12,110
devouring the barbecue. It might've been
the best moment of the tour. So anyways,

690
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:16,340
you'd think having done stand
up for 23 fucking years,

691
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,260
I would have done the math and
realized that this sunburn tattooed,

692
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:26,470
missing tooth shit show that was already
drinking four hours before my show was

693
00:43:27,051 --> 00:43:31,430
going to start. Some of
them, some of those animals,

694
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:33,860
we're going to fucking come into the show.

695
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:36,470
It never dawned on me
and I went out on stage.

696
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:38,420
It was one of those things as a comic,

697
00:43:38,421 --> 00:43:43,250
you come walking out on stage and you
just feel the vibe like, all right,

698
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:48,020
why do I feel like I'm in a saloon in
the 18 hundreds and I think I said one

699
00:43:48,021 --> 00:43:51,530
thing and somebody yelled
from the to the left.

700
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:53,330
I don't know if that
stage left to stage right.

701
00:43:53,331 --> 00:43:54,710
I never know how to fuck that works.

702
00:43:55,490 --> 00:43:58,040
And just right out of the
gate it's like Jesus Christ.

703
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,270
I didn't even get a fucking word out.

704
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:03,410
So I wrote something about how they had
this person had horrible parents and

705
00:44:03,411 --> 00:44:06,650
that's why this person was
behaving this way. And um,

706
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:10,490
and then that was basically the end
of the show. I had engaged with them.

707
00:44:10,491 --> 00:44:14,300
So now it, it just became a
totally interactive experience.

708
00:44:14,301 --> 00:44:17,630
It was actually a really fun show.
Um,

709
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:21,470
I do a couple of jokes and then I just
have to have a conversation with a drunk.

710
00:44:21,471 --> 00:44:26,471
There was actually a guy in the crowd
who got kicked out and he wasn't with

711
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:30,500
anybody else.
He was by himself like he was,

712
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:35,220
he was basically the best drinker of
all of his friends is what I figured out

713
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:38,340
because somebody jets, I'm in the middle
of my joke and somebody just yell,

714
00:44:38,341 --> 00:44:39,750
security,
security.

715
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:43,620
And they immediately made a beeline over
and I seen them grabbing this guy to,

716
00:44:43,621 --> 00:44:46,650
you know, escorting them out.
And usually at that point,

717
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:50,700
this either at least one other person
with them screaming that it was bullshit

718
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:51,563
and there wasn't,

719
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:56,340
he walked out by himself and there
was just one empty chair and a,

720
00:44:56,341 --> 00:45:00,750
I think that's when I finally put it
together and I was like, ah, okay,

721
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:01,613
now I get it.

722
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:06,950
You guys are the guys that I saw
drinking six hours ago out on the street.

723
00:45:07,111 --> 00:45:10,770
And everybody laughed. It was one of those
crowds that would laugh at the jokes,

724
00:45:10,771 --> 00:45:15,270
but they would really laugh when I would
snap and tell them how fucking drunk

725
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:18,990
and how much they're not paying attention,
then they would really laugh. Um,

726
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,920
but hopefully it was still a good show.
There was a few people that I was like,

727
00:45:22,921 --> 00:45:24,870
oh, we should, could have so
in front of a sober crowd.

728
00:45:24,871 --> 00:45:29,160
So I kind of felt bad about some
of that shit. But, um, I dunno,

729
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:34,190
it reminded me of my days when I was
working my way up as a comedian and I'm

730
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:40,320
just watching somebody go on in front
of you having to deal with the crowd,

731
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:43,890
but they weren't like Barton and click a
seasoned vet so they are able to handle

732
00:45:43,891 --> 00:45:45,600
it like they were a new comic like I was.

733
00:45:45,601 --> 00:45:50,601
And you would watch them going up just
person after person just bombing and

734
00:45:50,851 --> 00:45:53,040
you'd be just thinking
like, oh my God. Oh my God.

735
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:56,100
Can you just try to come up with a
game plan? What am I going to do?

736
00:45:56,130 --> 00:46:00,360
What joke am I going to open with?
What am I going to say to that guy?

737
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:03,690
That guy says anything to me.
Like back then I used to,

738
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:08,340
I used to have to plan out shit that I
was going to say rather than just go with

739
00:46:08,341 --> 00:46:11,830
the frustration of the
moment in the moment. And um,

740
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:16,350
when you'd go up there, if
you bomb too, he just go home.

741
00:46:16,351 --> 00:46:20,100
So fucking defeated in angry.
But if you actually won,

742
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:24,960
if he actually turned the room around,
it was just the greatest fucking feeling.

743
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,020
Like you felt like, uh, I dunno,

744
00:46:28,050 --> 00:46:32,190
you felt like you when you were on
point of some platooned and somehow you

745
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:35,460
didn't get fucking whacked. I Dunno.
I Dunno what I'm talking about here.

746
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:37,470
So anyways,
um,

747
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:42,330
this is like big time wine
country out here and um,

748
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,960
we played bouncing back here.
I'll add bill here.

749
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:49,530
We played that theater last night and
it was just some of the greatest fucking

750
00:46:49,531 --> 00:46:52,890
people backstage I've been with.

751
00:46:52,891 --> 00:46:56,760
Like our bus driver ran into somebody
else that he knew back when he used to,

752
00:46:57,150 --> 00:47:01,710
I guess I didn't know our bus driver
used to drive the Allman brothers and um,

753
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:04,380
I should have known he did because
he was fucking cool as shit.

754
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:07,080
And if you get a cool bus driver,
those guys work all the time.

755
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:10,530
We get some fucking Weirdo. You know
what I mean? They used to drive like,

756
00:47:10,531 --> 00:47:14,820
you know, I dunno, Milli Vanilli
or some shit, right? So, um,

757
00:47:15,810 --> 00:47:20,810
him and the other guy just sitting there
and we're hanging out and they had this

758
00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:26,810
unbelievably gorgeous long dining room
table and it was one of those modern

759
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:34,030
rustic is what they call it was built
from wood, from an old ship and then,

760
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:35,040
and then the legs are,

761
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:39,500
were made out of metal and the
tables just indestructable.

762
00:47:39,501 --> 00:47:42,520
What I loved about it is when
you have a table like that,

763
00:47:42,521 --> 00:47:43,690
you can spill shit on it.

764
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:48,070
You could literally use it as a cutting
boy if you wanted to. And um, you know,

765
00:47:48,071 --> 00:47:51,220
I should give you guys the
name of that fucking place. Um,

766
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:55,660
I guess they're expensive
is fucking hell. But, uh,

767
00:47:55,661 --> 00:47:58,960
I've been looking for a dining room table
because we have this awful just round

768
00:47:58,961 --> 00:48:02,770
one. We got it from our neighbors and
then we paid this guy to refinish it.

769
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:06,820
And uh, my wife, cause she's
so fucking creative, had these,

770
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:09,880
this design carved into it,

771
00:48:09,881 --> 00:48:12,520
that was the same design of this
panel thing that was at our wedding.

772
00:48:12,910 --> 00:48:14,380
She had not Jesus Christ.

773
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:18,340
I just realized there's no way she's
getting rid of that table. So. Well,

774
00:48:18,341 --> 00:48:21,370
I guess I'm not buying a table
from these fucking people, but, uh,

775
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:26,400
if you guys would like a really great
fucking table coke is Decaux is it c o,

776
00:48:28,691 --> 00:48:33,190
k a. S d. I k. O I believe
in there in Santa Rosa,

777
00:48:33,191 --> 00:48:37,720
California. And um, they make tables
all different sizes. This was like,

778
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:41,200
what I loved about this table was
it was big enough that entire,

779
00:48:41,201 --> 00:48:45,790
an entire band could come in and it was
a lot of music acts that played at this

780
00:48:45,791 --> 00:48:49,240
venue could just come in and everybody
could sit down granted if they still got

781
00:48:49,241 --> 00:48:52,570
along. Um, and these people,

782
00:48:52,571 --> 00:48:57,571
like they had this unbelievable spread
and they had glasses of wine and cheese

783
00:48:57,611 --> 00:49:02,260
and all that. Just giving you the whole
experience because most of the times,

784
00:49:02,261 --> 00:49:04,720
you know, you're traveling, you
don't get to have the experience.

785
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:07,660
Like I wanted to go to bizarre guitar
and gun shop and I just didn't have the

786
00:49:07,661 --> 00:49:12,520
time to get over there. Um, after I
went over to get the barbecue, um,

787
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:15,460
you know, when need a bunch of barbecue,
he body just, just like, all right,

788
00:49:15,461 --> 00:49:17,590
shutting down now dealing
with what you just put,

789
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:20,620
like you just put so much
fucked up shit into your body.

790
00:49:21,010 --> 00:49:25,000
There's not enough energy left to keep
you awake. So your body's just like,

791
00:49:25,001 --> 00:49:27,010
all right, powering down. You know,

792
00:49:27,011 --> 00:49:29,170
it's like when you put
your laptop on sleep mode,

793
00:49:29,410 --> 00:49:32,440
like that's what your body does to
you. Like, yeah, that's why, you know,

794
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:36,130
black people call it the itis. I know
what white people call it, you know,

795
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:39,460
whatever the fuck it is. It's like a,
I learned that from Charlie Murphy.

796
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:42,070
I told this story before,
I got to tell it again.

797
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:46,510
Charlie Murphy and Darnell Rawlings,
we were on a tour called, uh,

798
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:47,530
the rich bitch tour.

799
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:51,130
And that was from when Darnell
Darnell was the guy that did that.

800
00:49:51,131 --> 00:49:54,650
I'm rich bitch that would scream at the
end of the Chappelle show. [inaudible].

801
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:59,590
So, um, you know, they used to always
just sit there and breaking balls,

802
00:49:59,591 --> 00:50:01,090
breaking balls, breaking balls, you know,

803
00:50:01,091 --> 00:50:04,240
making fun of my clothes and
all that type of shit. And uh,

804
00:50:04,241 --> 00:50:06,780
it was the worst in the morning,
you know what I mean? Cause I've,

805
00:50:06,781 --> 00:50:07,840
I've been wake up,
you know,

806
00:50:07,841 --> 00:50:10,720
hung over or whatever and these
guys will like a couple of kids,

807
00:50:10,721 --> 00:50:11,820
they just woke up like we,

808
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:15,210
we like they weren't drinking
with me the night before. Um,

809
00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:18,760
I don't say take a multivitamin
is a what? Right. Um,

810
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:21,310
so one day I was just fucking,

811
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,480
I didn't want to deal with it and we
had this long drive from Chicago all the

812
00:50:25,481 --> 00:50:28,910
way up.
Like Mount Vernon,

813
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:30,710
I don't even fuck around
Mount Vernon's New York.

814
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:33,560
I can't remember some way of like a,
it's like a two hour drive.

815
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:37,520
And I knew that they were going to be
loud and breaking my balls and I went

816
00:50:37,521 --> 00:50:41,060
extra hard and I didn't want to deal
with it. And I was standing out there,

817
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:45,650
we had this fucking car service, right?
This old ass limo. I remember that.

818
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:50,450
Are there any new limos by the way?
They're always fucking old as shit. Um,

819
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:53,690
this old ass fucking literally looked
like the thing was from like the 80s,

820
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:57,890
this old town car, right. And I'm
standing there going, oh my God,

821
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:00,320
I don't want to deal with these guys.
They're going to be loud as shit.

822
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:05,590
And I looked down the street and I
saw a Popeye's and I was just like,

823
00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:06,523
fuck this.

824
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:09,710
Cause they had taught me about the
itis because Donna was eating so bad.

825
00:51:09,711 --> 00:51:14,711
Darnell was literally buying hot dogs
at the gas stations in Edam and within

826
00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:17,480
fucking five minutes he would be asleep.

827
00:51:17,481 --> 00:51:20,570
Like his body would just power down
dealing with the poison he just put in.

828
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:22,310
So I went down the street,

829
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:27,340
went in there and got this giant bucket
of Popeye's chicken with fucking mash

830
00:51:27,471 --> 00:51:32,330
potatoes and biscuits and they
came walking up and I was like,

831
00:51:32,331 --> 00:51:36,500
hey guys, that got us some
food. They don't like, oh all
right man, thanks. Thanks.

832
00:51:36,501 --> 00:51:39,950
And they start eating it and I'm just
sitting there nursing like one drum stick

833
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:43,520
and they ate that shit in like
within fucking 20 minutes.

834
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:49,660
They will both passed out and I just
sat with a fucking shitty and grid.

835
00:51:50,450 --> 00:51:55,370
It just wrote in total silence up to
the fucking whatever the fuck we were

836
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:56,690
going.
So they ago,

837
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:01,160
if you're ever in a car and you've got
a loud friend or something like that,

838
00:52:01,710 --> 00:52:06,200
a legal way to drug them is you just get
some really bad fast food because it's

839
00:52:06,201 --> 00:52:09,300
poison. It's just all trans fats. Well, I,

840
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:13,250
I am my own selfish way. I poisoned
two really good friends of mine.

841
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:18,500
I temporarily poisoned them so I
could just sit there, you know,

842
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:22,340
and enjoy myself as I wrote up,
you know what I mean?

843
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:25,570
And is it slightly racist?
Then I went and,

844
00:52:25,571 --> 00:52:29,450
and got a bucket of chicken for two
African Americans in defense of me.

845
00:52:29,451 --> 00:52:33,320
It's the first one that I saw.
It was the first thing that I saw.

846
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:39,950
I don't fucking know. Anyways,
moving on. What are we up to here?

847
00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:45,770
32 32 in 1951 minutes. Oh,
we're closing in on it there.

848
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:50,630
Um, oh Jesus Christ. I
haven't, oh Jesus Christ.

849
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:54,560
I haven't even done the fucking let us
for this week. I'm out. I'm out of it.

850
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:58,630
I'm out of it here. Where the hell did it
go? Is this them? All right, let's let,

851
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:02,030
let's let, let's listen to me read out
loud one last time here. Legal Zoom,

871
00:54:13,591 --> 00:54:14,880
I almost forgot to talk about.

872
00:54:14,881 --> 00:54:19,530
Do you know I watched the end of the
u s open and watch that poor bastard

873
00:54:20,430 --> 00:54:24,420
potting for Eagle.
He's with Wayne Gretzky's daughter.

874
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:26,520
Wayne Gretzky is in the crowd,

875
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:30,900
a man who has his name on the cup
four times a man who is a champion.

876
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:36,960
And you saw Gretzky, had a big smile on
his face like, yeah buddy, here we go,

877
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:40,650
you sync this fucker,
you go top shelf with this thing.

878
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:44,910
And it was a long plot and the guy
didn't see, didn't sync it. So it's like,

879
00:54:44,911 --> 00:54:48,300
all right, whatever. And then he had
a three foot plot and I had to leave.

880
00:54:48,330 --> 00:54:52,320
I had to run out to go do my
show and I shut off the TV,

881
00:54:52,321 --> 00:54:55,530
assuming he was going to sink the three
foot plot and then there was going to be

882
00:54:55,531 --> 00:54:58,890
a playoff that I could watch,
you know, before my show,

883
00:54:58,891 --> 00:55:00,210
I guess it would have been today,

884
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:02,940
they would have played like a whole
nother round of golf for some shit,

885
00:55:02,941 --> 00:55:06,570
I guess is how it works. So I
shut the TV off. Thank God I did.

886
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:12,020
And as I'm going out I was,
I was going out to, to the,

887
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:16,900
to the bus.
My phone starts blowing up and people,

888
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:19,800
some Versie wrote,
Oh my God,

889
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:22,170
that just made me sick.

890
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:26,370
And I thought at first
they were talking about,

891
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:32,080
they were talking about the, uh,
you know him missing the, the,

892
00:55:32,110 --> 00:55:34,980
the Eagle Pot. Right. Um,

893
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:39,450
I got this message from a buddy of
mine. He wrote, holy fucking Shit.

894
00:55:40,410 --> 00:55:44,520
That's just awful. What does
Gretzky say there? And I wrote back,

895
00:55:44,521 --> 00:55:46,290
did he miss the Birdie Putt too?

896
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:51,360
And he just wrote Yas like 20
fucking asses. He just lost.

897
00:55:52,230 --> 00:55:57,060
And I wrote, Oh, now he said, miss
the three footer coming back up.

898
00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:01,320
Unreal all time putting choke.
It's shocking.

899
00:56:01,590 --> 00:56:05,570
Did you see? And I wrote, I'm so
glad I missed the second miss.

900
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:07,920
I ran out to the car
to go over to the show.

901
00:56:07,921 --> 00:56:11,480
I assume you'd hit it and I'd
watched a play off and then I wrote,

902
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:13,830
golf is fucking devastating

903
00:56:15,630 --> 00:56:16,790
and he will play off at us.

904
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:20,550
Open is 18 holes on Monday for you
people who are really into golf. Um,

905
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:26,090
golf has absolutely fucking
emotionally fucking devastating.

906
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:30,020
I still don't think it's a sport. It's
the most devastating fucking activity.

907
00:56:31,710 --> 00:56:34,500
Like the first masters I ever
sat down and watch wire to wire.

908
00:56:34,501 --> 00:56:36,840
I watch Kenny Perry fall apart.

909
00:56:37,370 --> 00:56:37,730
Yeah,

910
00:56:37,730 --> 00:56:42,730
on 17 and 18 and then go to the playoffs
and fucking loose to the coolest

911
00:56:42,921 --> 00:56:46,910
Argentinian dude. I just, I just,

912
00:56:46,950 --> 00:56:51,380
I can't get over
how fucking devastating I eat.

913
00:56:51,381 --> 00:56:56,300
What kills me is this is to think
it's just a complete mind. Fuck.

914
00:56:56,930 --> 00:57:00,260
It's the biggest mind fuck out there.
I believe in that kid though,

915
00:57:00,261 --> 00:57:02,730
even though he missed those two things.
I believe that kids a stud,

916
00:57:02,731 --> 00:57:04,790
he's going to come back and uh,

917
00:57:04,791 --> 00:57:07,940
I feel bad that everyone's going to say
he's a big fucking choker and all that,

918
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:11,330
like they've ever dealt with
any sort of pressure like that.

919
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:15,350
So whatever his fucking name is,
I'm not into golf.

920
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:18,830
Um, I got MP three, four
year, I believe in you.

921
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:22,400
You're going to be back and uh,
it's only gonna make you stronger.

922
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:27,730
And they're just the fact that he could
actually just not break down into tears

923
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:31,790
right there on national television.
He probably did later on that night.

924
00:57:31,791 --> 00:57:35,450
And there's nothing wrong with that.
I would have just, when I missed it,

925
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:39,590
I would've just let,
not even like through my club doubt,

926
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:42,080
I would've just let go of it.
You know? That's even worse.

927
00:57:42,110 --> 00:57:43,280
That's when you're devastated.

928
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:46,880
When you can't even make your muscles
work anymore. You're like, you're so sad.

929
00:57:46,881 --> 00:57:51,870
You can't even, you can't even hold
anything. You just let go. Whoa.

930
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:56,750
It'd be fucking hilarious.
And you don't even finish your pot.

931
00:57:56,780 --> 00:58:00,010
You just fucking kick it with your
foot. I don't give a fuck. He is.

932
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:03,830
You have to be carried off.

933
00:58:03,831 --> 00:58:06,350
Like you remember when James Brown
would do that thing and they'd bring the

934
00:58:06,351 --> 00:58:08,140
fucking coat over two of them.

935
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:12,680
Like they have to do that except it's a
little golf Poncho and the golf umbrella

936
00:58:13,550 --> 00:58:16,130
and they're just bringing you in as
somebody patting you on the chest.

937
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:20,330
Come on bill. Come on. I would have done
that. So just the fact that he could,

938
00:58:20,331 --> 00:58:23,420
he had to walk out in front of all of
those people with their heads high and you

939
00:58:23,421 --> 00:58:24,710
know,
they were all looking at him.

940
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:25,620
Okay.

941
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:26,580
In some way.

942
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:31,800
A lot of them will love in it because
they never made it to a u s open. So,

943
00:58:31,801 --> 00:58:35,850
uh, I don't know, just the fact
that he was fucking in there first,

944
00:58:35,851 --> 00:58:38,310
he actually wrote that was so devastating.

945
00:58:38,311 --> 00:58:43,200
The guy who won didn't even
enjoy it. Oh my God. It was,

946
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:47,940
it's one of the most brutal
fucking things, you know,

947
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:51,550
it was right up there with watching the
Seahawks throw the ball and have it get

948
00:58:51,551 --> 00:58:52,384
intercepted.

949
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:56,740
But at least then like
the devastation of that,

950
00:58:56,800 --> 00:59:00,520
it's spread across 40 men.
You know what I mean?

951
00:59:00,550 --> 00:59:03,460
Who can be all devastated
together as opposed to golf?

952
00:59:03,461 --> 00:59:05,710
It's just you by yourself.

953
00:59:05,950 --> 00:59:09,610
There's no defense trying to pick the
ball off or guess what you're doing,

954
00:59:09,611 --> 00:59:13,600
jumping around.
It's just you in three feet of grass.

955
00:59:14,290 --> 00:59:14,800
Another my,

956
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:18,010
one of my buddies was shitting on the
fucking what the golf course look like.

957
00:59:18,011 --> 00:59:20,920
He goes, dude, that golf
course looks like my backyard.

958
00:59:23,620 --> 00:59:26,320
I hated it at first,
but after a while I kind of liked it.

959
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:29,590
I thought it was kind of a bad
ass course man. It looked like a,

960
00:59:30,430 --> 00:59:34,720
they stopped in the middle of a war and
decided to play 18 holes cause they had

961
00:59:34,721 --> 00:59:35,531
like the gallery.

962
00:59:35,531 --> 00:59:39,220
Then we're in like these look like these
ruins these buildings or some shit that

963
00:59:39,221 --> 00:59:43,060
had been torn up. Anyway, so let's get
to the questions here for the week.

964
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:48,550
A bill where all the John Wayne,
this is from a lady. Uh, hello bill.

965
00:59:48,551 --> 00:59:50,230
I'm a big fan.
I hope this gets to you.

966
00:59:50,231 --> 00:59:55,000
Me and my husband take the drive from
Austin to Houston visiting his dad in the

967
00:59:55,001 --> 00:59:58,450
hospital quite often.
Uh Oh man. That's sad.

968
00:59:58,570 --> 01:00:00,310
I hope it gets better or I don't know.

969
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:04,560
I hope there's something in then its
benefit. I just made me sad. Anyways,

970
01:00:04,570 --> 01:00:08,830
the drive can can feel long, but we cut
in. Cut It in half with your podcast. Oh,

971
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:12,370
there we go. We get good laughs and
we don't have to talk to each other.

972
01:00:12,850 --> 01:00:15,850
I'm writing to get your opinion.
I may be wrong,

973
01:00:15,851 --> 01:00:19,810
but I'm open to hear what you think. I
wanted to have a pedicure on my birthday.

974
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:21,880
I dragged my husband with me.
It's,

975
01:00:21,970 --> 01:00:26,710
it is the best place to get a foot and
calf massage. He's never had a pedicure,

976
01:00:26,770 --> 01:00:30,370
so I wanted for him to
experience it with me.

977
01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:35,490
He was not a fan. He didn't feel like
his feet were being touched by another,

978
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:38,680
what? He didn't like. His feet
being touched by another man.

979
01:00:38,810 --> 01:00:41,800
Ah, ah. Oh God.

980
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:47,290
Another man giving you a calf massage.
Oh,

981
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:49,120
Jesus Christ.

982
01:00:50,290 --> 01:00:54,370
When is this month today and my God,

983
01:00:54,371 --> 01:00:58,980
the uncomfortableness of this
month. Jesus Christ. Yeah.

984
01:00:59,050 --> 01:01:03,070
He thinks women try to emasculate
men by having them get wax,

985
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:05,200
spray Tan and have pedicures.

986
01:01:05,830 --> 01:01:08,350
He's always referenced in
men in Hollywood by saying,

987
01:01:08,351 --> 01:01:12,610
where are all the John Waynes?
I wasn't trying to emasculate him,

988
01:01:12,730 --> 01:01:16,660
but to give them a new experience
and hope that he would enjoy a little

989
01:01:16,661 --> 01:01:18,700
relaxation.
He wasn't into it.

990
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:23,530
Tell me if you get pedicures and if
you would enjoy them, you're great.

991
01:01:23,531 --> 01:01:28,480
Go Fuck Yourself. Uh, no, I don't
get pedicures. This is the thing.

992
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:33,960
Men are not allowed to enjoy any sensual
experience unless it's with the female.

993
01:01:35,890 --> 01:01:39,490
Like women can just sit there and let
another woman touched their feet and

994
01:01:39,491 --> 01:01:43,630
massage there cast and be like, oh my
God, that feels so good. Thank you Stacy.

995
01:01:44,650 --> 01:01:46,900
You know,
we're not allowed to this.

996
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:50,050
The thing about it is his guys were like,

997
01:01:51,070 --> 01:01:53,790
what I pictured guys remember,

998
01:01:53,830 --> 01:01:56,080
remember those old
square TVs that you had?

999
01:01:56,500 --> 01:02:01,240
That's like what a guy is physically
with just like these blocks, you know,

1000
01:02:02,230 --> 01:02:04,240
and we'll just like,
what?

1001
01:02:04,241 --> 01:02:07,360
Not like that I'm getting grossed out.

1002
01:02:07,990 --> 01:02:12,250
This is just gross and maybe I'm fucking
immature. But now you know something

1003
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:15,293
I think,

1004
01:02:16,810 --> 01:02:20,350
I dunno, maybe I'm wrong. Uh, the song
we need, cause she'll fucking soft.

1005
01:02:20,351 --> 01:02:24,110
And what I'm going to say here. What
the fuck are you doing to your man here?

1006
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:27,710
Why don't you want that guy?
You see fucking read the second.

1007
01:02:27,711 --> 01:02:31,430
Anybody in intruder comes in.
You killing that off of him.

1008
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:37,340
The EAG. He's just going to grab some
fucking lamp and start smashing it over.

1009
01:02:37,341 --> 01:02:39,230
Somebody who's fucking head.
If they come to your house,

1010
01:02:39,530 --> 01:02:44,240
if he keeps getting a calf massage
and getting his toes fucking painting.

1011
01:02:44,241 --> 01:02:46,920
What do you,
what are you doing to you?

1012
01:02:47,190 --> 01:02:52,100
You're rehabbing a pit bull here for no
fucking reason. He's fine the way it is.

1013
01:02:53,180 --> 01:02:57,500
Oh my God. No. You know
something. I think I did one time.

1014
01:02:57,501 --> 01:03:01,520
I did get a pedicure. I get when I
was on the fucking rich bitch tour.

1015
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:06,410
He knows something. Black
Dudes, we'll get manicures.

1016
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:10,610
They'll get manicures. I think it was
a manicure. Did I have, you know, I,

1017
01:03:10,630 --> 01:03:13,790
I know I got a pedicure one time.
I think I was with Nia.

1018
01:03:15,580 --> 01:03:17,740
I think I blocked it up. Yeah,
I think we were in New York.

1019
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:22,800
I got a pedicure and then the lady was
rubbing my calves and all it did was make

1020
01:03:24,431 --> 01:03:28,980
me want to get a fucking, you know what?
Happy ending. It was just like, yeah,

1021
01:03:28,990 --> 01:03:32,800
keep going, keep going. Skip the size,

1022
01:03:33,070 --> 01:03:35,570
get to the finish line.
Um,

1023
01:03:37,930 --> 01:03:39,400
I,
I dunno.

1024
01:03:40,580 --> 01:03:41,220
Okay.

1025
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:43,290
I don't really even
remember the experience.

1026
01:03:43,350 --> 01:03:46,500
I just remember I did it because
she asked me to do it and I did it.

1027
01:03:47,130 --> 01:03:48,240
And I remember laughing.

1028
01:03:48,750 --> 01:03:52,920
I remember being really immature and when
I dip my feet into the fucking water,

1029
01:03:52,921 --> 01:03:55,740
it just was making me laugh.
I was like,

1030
01:03:55,741 --> 01:04:00,030
I almost lost control of myself because
it was just something that was so

1031
01:04:00,031 --> 01:04:03,030
fucking foreign to me.
Um,

1032
01:04:04,170 --> 01:04:05,940
and I was sitting and
then the more I laughed,

1033
01:04:05,941 --> 01:04:10,230
the more near was laughing and she just
kept laughing, going, what? It's nice.

1034
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:14,010
It's nice. And I just kept laughing
going, what are you doing to me?

1035
01:04:14,820 --> 01:04:19,400
Um, and then afterwards, I don't
know, but I will say afterwards,

1036
01:04:19,401 --> 01:04:23,990
my toes, nails where's clean as they've
ever fucking bed. But, uh, you know, I'll,

1037
01:04:24,050 --> 01:04:28,190
you know, I'll just get one of those
fucking 50 cent scrub brushes. Uh,

1038
01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:33,020
I'll just say, can you leave him
alone? You know what I mean? You,

1039
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:36,710
you can, I understand you trying to
like give them a nice experience,

1040
01:04:36,711 --> 01:04:40,760
but like that can go a little too far.
And next thing you know,

1041
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:45,920
you, you're wondering what happened to
the man you married or maybe you're not,

1042
01:04:45,950 --> 01:04:48,740
maybe you're more evolved. I don't
know. Maybe women are more involved.

1043
01:04:48,770 --> 01:04:52,340
I don't fucking know. Don't ask me
those questions. I feel gross right now.

1044
01:04:52,770 --> 01:04:54,170
All right.
Please explain this to me.

1045
01:04:55,310 --> 01:04:58,700
Caitlin Jenner is receiving an
award at the espys for her courage,

1046
01:04:58,701 --> 01:05:00,980
which is apparently the
greatest thing ever.

1047
01:05:01,550 --> 01:05:05,240
What they don't tell you is the person
who won't be receiving the award now is

1048
01:05:05,241 --> 01:05:07,880
Lauren Hill,
the girl who was diagnosed,

1049
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:11,060
diagnosed with inoperable brain cancer.

1050
01:05:13,950 --> 01:05:18,330
Oh, Lauren Hill does to singer.
She played her first game. Oh,

1051
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:19,710
so this is a,
it has the same thing.

1052
01:05:19,860 --> 01:05:24,030
She played her first game for her college
basketball game after a diagnosis.

1053
01:05:24,031 --> 01:05:24,930
I saw this,

1054
01:05:25,590 --> 01:05:29,280
I saw this fucking story
and for months to come,

1055
01:05:29,281 --> 01:05:31,770
she raised over a million
dollars for cancer research.

1056
01:05:31,771 --> 01:05:33,570
She died a couple of months later.

1057
01:05:33,690 --> 01:05:37,980
So please explain to me why a guide
shopping his dick off is more courageous

1058
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:42,990
than standing up to cancer. You know,
I'll tell you why. Because you know what,

1059
01:05:42,991 --> 01:05:46,710
at the end of the day, it's
show business. That's why,

1060
01:05:47,830 --> 01:05:48,260
okay,

1061
01:05:48,260 --> 01:05:50,770
it's fucking show business.
Um,

1062
01:05:50,870 --> 01:05:54,950
I know somebody that writes on that show
and I know of something that happened

1063
01:05:55,010 --> 01:05:56,150
that I'm can't say,

1064
01:05:56,990 --> 01:06:01,100
and someone was in the truck flipping
out that it was going on too long.

1065
01:06:01,730 --> 01:06:04,100
And all they were thinking about was,
you know,

1066
01:06:04,130 --> 01:06:08,060
going like just the worst fucking moment
in my life because this person up there,

1067
01:06:08,061 --> 01:06:11,150
I'm, I'm going to say what it was, but
it's just, it's fucking show business.

1068
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:15,110
That's why. So they're probably
going like, oh, do we want
to bring the room down?

1069
01:06:16,370 --> 01:06:17,151
Or maybe like,
well,

1070
01:06:17,151 --> 01:06:20,530
but they always have something about
somebody dying on that show, the,

1071
01:06:20,610 --> 01:06:23,630
the touching moment, you know what
I mean? But then they're thinking,

1072
01:06:23,660 --> 01:06:26,030
oh Caitlyn Jenner is really hot right now.

1073
01:06:26,540 --> 01:06:30,140
It has the high Q rating or something
like that. That'll give us more.

1074
01:06:31,490 --> 01:06:32,323
MMM.

1075
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:37,030
I don't know why. Why, why, why? I
don't understand what that award is.

1076
01:06:38,020 --> 01:06:40,670
I can see if Katelyn just went
out on one another, the castle on

1077
01:06:42,230 --> 01:06:46,080
like they kind of given basically the
giving it to Bruce Jenner in a way.

1078
01:06:46,110 --> 01:06:50,790
The way they gave fucking a Martin
Scorsese, the Oscar for the departed,

1079
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:54,570
cause they fucked up on a raging bull.

1080
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:57,660
They didn't give it to him for
fucking Goodfellas. They audit tool.

1081
01:06:57,930 --> 01:07:02,160
So I think they owed Bruce Jenner of
fucking sp. They never gave it to him.

1082
01:07:02,161 --> 01:07:05,040
It's like fuck, we waited too
long. Cause now Bruce is Katelyn.

1083
01:07:05,490 --> 01:07:10,140
Well maybe we can give it to her and
she can give it to him through a brain.

1084
01:07:11,130 --> 01:07:13,620
I don't fucking know.
I don't produce shows.

1085
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:17,910
And by that last fucking horrific answer,
you can understand why. All right.

1086
01:07:17,911 --> 01:07:21,610
The age of technology,
dare Billy bombsight.

1087
01:07:22,060 --> 01:07:25,710
I'm an open miker in a semi small city
and don't really expect to get much

1088
01:07:25,711 --> 01:07:28,470
attention in this place.
Well that's a great place to start.

1089
01:07:28,471 --> 01:07:30,990
Don't videotape yourself and get better.
Well,

1090
01:07:30,991 --> 01:07:34,410
videotape yourself the don't upload it
onto youtube and get used to get real

1091
01:07:34,411 --> 01:07:37,530
good. Then move to a better city with
more exposure and then become a monster.

1092
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:39,030
Anyways.
Um,

1093
01:07:39,090 --> 01:07:42,330
I recently found out that someone at
an open mic was recording video of

1094
01:07:42,331 --> 01:07:44,850
everyone's set off.
Fuck it.

1095
01:07:44,851 --> 01:07:48,210
Put all the capture content onto their
social network page, including mine.

1096
01:07:48,211 --> 01:07:52,170
When I found out that my
shitty undeveloped open
miking was on the Internet,

1097
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:55,800
I was furious as you should have been
contacted. The individual that posted it,

1098
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:58,320
they have since taken
most of the content down,

1099
01:07:58,530 --> 01:08:01,710
but I had a long argument about this
situation with a different person.

1100
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:06,510
They argued in defense of this lady by
saying, this is the world we live in now.

1101
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:10,320
You were in a public place and that
gave her the right to record you.

1102
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:14,550
The worst that happens is that you say
something stupid and get and you get

1103
01:08:14,551 --> 01:08:18,170
publicity for it. Any publicity is good
publicity. All right? You know what?

1104
01:08:18,171 --> 01:08:22,160
That person's going to be a
fucking hack. Um, he said,

1105
01:08:22,161 --> 01:08:25,880
my argument is basically that if
she earns any money from my content,

1106
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:27,590
then I have a right to be pissed off.

1107
01:08:27,591 --> 01:08:31,490
I also feel very uneasy thinking about
the possibility of saying something

1108
01:08:31,491 --> 01:08:35,270
stupid about a current event and getting
flak on Twitter just because I thought

1109
01:08:35,271 --> 01:08:36,980
it was funny and no one else did.
Yeah.

1110
01:08:36,981 --> 01:08:40,430
And you're also brand new to comedy and
you should be allowed to make mistakes,

1111
01:08:40,970 --> 01:08:41,241
uh,

1112
01:08:41,241 --> 01:08:45,320
with the recent popularity of the APP
periscope and hearing you bitch a little

1113
01:08:45,321 --> 01:08:49,250
bit about it. I would like to hear
your opinion on this argument. Thanks.

1114
01:08:49,251 --> 01:08:52,880
And Go shag yourself.
A PSU still have fans in Nebraska.

1115
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:58,250
Um, yeah, no, I'm a hundred
percent agreement with you.

1116
01:08:58,251 --> 01:09:00,320
You should be allowed to
develop as an open micro,

1117
01:09:00,321 --> 01:09:01,820
but you can't get mad at the lady.

1118
01:09:01,820 --> 01:09:06,390
Like they don't understand that what
they're doing could be detrimental. Um,

1119
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:11,350
and it is the world that we
live in because people do
do that. But you're, you,

1120
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:13,310
you are right.
Um,

1121
01:09:14,210 --> 01:09:18,170
and I don't understand why everybody
feels like they have to videotape every

1122
01:09:18,171 --> 01:09:22,670
fucking moment of their
lives. Now. It's all like,

1123
01:09:22,970 --> 01:09:26,600
it's almost like they're
campaigning for this office of, Hey,

1124
01:09:26,601 --> 01:09:31,160
I have the coolest life. Like
always taken a selfie. Like,

1125
01:09:31,161 --> 01:09:34,400
you know, this is me and
old faithful. You know,

1126
01:09:35,690 --> 01:09:38,330
it's so what I was supposed
to look at it like, wow,

1127
01:09:38,331 --> 01:09:42,290
this guy is fucking goes everywhere.
You know what I mean? I, I don't,

1128
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:44,990
I don't understand it. I mean, I
guess I do that though and I do that.

1129
01:09:45,620 --> 01:09:49,100
I took a picture of me and, uh, well it
wasn't a Selfie, but me and Bart, nick,

1130
01:09:49,490 --> 01:09:53,120
when we were in Reno
with that iconic sign,

1131
01:09:54,530 --> 01:09:59,180
I don't know, but I wish people
wouldn't do it at live events. Um,

1132
01:09:59,210 --> 01:10:03,350
especially when there's jokes because
the new jokes become old jokes. But, um,

1133
01:10:03,380 --> 01:10:07,460
I think that's going to end because
they're now coming out with these,

1134
01:10:07,461 --> 01:10:10,310
as these businesses popping up for
entertainers where they're going to block

1135
01:10:10,311 --> 01:10:14,150
people's cell phones during
the performance, which is, uh,

1136
01:10:15,220 --> 01:10:18,680
just pretty awesome.
I think if it's like up to the artists,

1137
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:22,760
although I'm also guilty cause I watch
all this shit that people videotape the

1138
01:10:22,761 --> 01:10:26,000
Stevie Ray Vaughan and that type of thing.
Um,

1139
01:10:26,030 --> 01:10:28,430
and then you get to enjoy the
performance. But, you know,

1140
01:10:29,150 --> 01:10:31,940
I don't think I'm going out on a limb to
say that you're not at your Stevie ray

1141
01:10:31,941 --> 01:10:33,480
Vaughan level of being a standup yet.

1142
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:36,390
It'd be nice if he could
be allowed to develop. Um,

1143
01:10:36,650 --> 01:10:40,220
people have recorded my shows and
whenever I reach out to him on Youtube,

1144
01:10:40,221 --> 01:10:42,530
they always take them down.
I never get mad at him.

1145
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:46,550
I understand that they're not in the
business and they don't get what that what

1146
01:10:46,551 --> 01:10:49,700
they're doing actually
hurts me on some level. Um,

1147
01:10:49,940 --> 01:10:54,050
so just deal with it. Whatever.
Fuck that dude who, Jay,

1148
01:10:54,051 --> 01:10:55,310
this is the world we live in.

1149
01:10:56,030 --> 01:10:58,850
You know those people who don't get mad
that the government can record all your

1150
01:10:58,851 --> 01:11:01,040
phone conversations? It just
like, well, hey, you know,

1151
01:11:01,041 --> 01:11:04,550
if you're not doing anything wrong,
what's the problem? Those fucking people.

1152
01:11:04,940 --> 01:11:05,241
Anyways,

1153
01:11:05,241 --> 01:11:09,610
I gotta I gotta wrap this up here cause
I gotta be on the bus in 10 minutes. Uh,

1154
01:11:09,620 --> 01:11:14,220
roommates lady wants to move in
a, hey Billy Bob, ginger tits,

1155
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:17,070
Jesus Christ, enough with the red head
jokes. Can you guys go with something new?

1156
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:19,710
It's getting fucking boring here.
Um,

1157
01:11:20,070 --> 01:11:23,160
my roommate of five years has
this new lady who is cool,

1158
01:11:23,161 --> 01:11:25,410
but off the bad seems
kind of manipulative.

1159
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:28,560
He told me that she's getting kicked out
of her place and she wants to move into

1160
01:11:28,561 --> 01:11:31,740
our two bedroom apartment in New
York City, which isn't that big.

1161
01:11:31,740 --> 01:11:34,410
As you would know for three months,
she wants to move there for three months.

1162
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:36,150
The rest would be split three ways.

1163
01:11:36,151 --> 01:11:39,060
They're planning on moving in together
after she stays for three months.

1164
01:11:39,270 --> 01:11:42,780
Do I accept the cheaper rent or
tell her to take a hike? By the way,

1165
01:11:42,781 --> 01:11:46,140
they'd been dating for six months.
You rule. Go Fuck Yourself. Now.

1166
01:11:46,290 --> 01:11:50,400
That manipulative con is going to
end up convincing her boy, boyfriend.

1167
01:11:50,610 --> 01:11:53,940
You're going to be the guy who's going to
leave because she's not going to leave.

1168
01:11:53,941 --> 01:11:56,460
They're going to ask you to leave and
you're like, fuck you, I'm not leaving,

1169
01:11:56,580 --> 01:11:58,340
and then it's going to be
two against one and your,

1170
01:11:58,350 --> 01:12:02,070
your life's going to be miserable.
Do not on any level allow her to move in.

1171
01:12:02,580 --> 01:12:06,900
Say this is a two bedroom apartment.
This is for two people, not for three.

1172
01:12:07,020 --> 01:12:08,820
It affects my quality of life.

1173
01:12:09,030 --> 01:12:14,030
There's not enough money in the fucking
universe for me to compromise my,

1174
01:12:14,431 --> 01:12:19,410
um, my quality of life. So no, that's it.

1175
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:24,450
No. And you stand by
that and fuck him. Okay.

1176
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:28,800
And fuck her. And then that's it. And you
won't have to deal with that situation.

1177
01:12:28,801 --> 01:12:29,461
And with any luck,

1178
01:12:29,461 --> 01:12:32,610
he'll fucking move out and you'll get
another roommate and you won't be involved

1179
01:12:32,611 --> 01:12:33,540
in that situation.

1180
01:12:33,541 --> 01:12:36,630
Then you'll have more power because then
you'll have been there longer than the

1181
01:12:36,631 --> 01:12:40,020
other person. All right? That is
one of the easiest questions ever.

1182
01:12:40,170 --> 01:12:43,440
Do not on any level.
Let her move in six months in,

1183
01:12:43,441 --> 01:12:47,250
you're codependent fucking pussy.
He'll fuck yourself.

1184
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:49,950
Oh my God.
And then now you got to wait.

1185
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:52,500
You're gonna have to wait 10 times
longer to go into the bathroom.

1186
01:12:52,501 --> 01:12:54,900
Cause not only do you
have another roommate,

1187
01:12:54,901 --> 01:12:56,550
it's a woman and they
take for fucking ever,

1188
01:12:56,551 --> 01:13:00,210
cause he can fucking go to put on all
that clown makeup and shit. All right,

1189
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:02,370
I'm done. Go fuck yourselves.
I'll talk to you next week.
