1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:05,070
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:09,760
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast and ah,

3
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:14,750
Ooh, ee, just checking in. All
mother bugging you, Lou. Um,

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,580
uh, what's going on? I'm in the middle
of this, this acting job. Ovi He,

5
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,420
so I got to do this before they
picked me up in the sad van.

6
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,330
The Sad van that takes you to set
for the excitement. That's the rules.

7
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,180
If you're going to have that much fun
pretending to be somebody else, right?

8
00:00:33,181 --> 00:00:35,730
Winning bar fights and all the
shit you get to do as an actor,

9
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:39,500
all the shit you can't do in real life.
Um,

10
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,350
then yeah,
they got to pick you up in a sad van.

11
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,110
The van is basically a bare bones,

12
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:51,740
usually all white with the gray
violin to just completely like,

13
00:00:52,351 --> 00:00:57,240
you know, four wheels powertrain.
This will get you there.
I call it the said Finn.

14
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,470
I don't know why. Um, but that
is the one thing about it.

15
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:02,490
Great thing about acting is you get to
do all this shit that you don't get to do

16
00:01:02,491 --> 00:01:03,570
in real life.
You know,

17
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:08,730
which is what's kind of cracking me
up lately about action movies is how,

18
00:01:08,731 --> 00:01:13,490
um, I don't know when exactly the
action hero genre started, but I,

19
00:01:13,491 --> 00:01:16,930
I came up in the eighties, so
you know, you had Stallone, Yay.

20
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:22,150
Add Schwartzenegger you had John
Claude van and then you had,

21
00:01:22,231 --> 00:01:26,220
um, Steven Seagal in each
year. They try to, you know,

22
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,910
Chuck Norris in each year.
They just tried to fucking,

23
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:35,100
Chuck Norris actually walked the line from
like action hero in Karate Guy, right?

24
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:39,930
He was somewhere between
like Bruce Lee and,

25
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:44,130
and uh, I don't know what, it's
a fucking chuck Norris, I guess.

26
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:48,390
Sorry, my brain is fried. We've been
walking at work and long hours here. Um,

27
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,310
but anyways, those movies kind of
already started off ridiculous. You know,

28
00:01:53,311 --> 00:01:56,970
we'd have 40 guys with machine
guns and a guy would just fucking,

29
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:00,690
there's one movie where I
think it's Schwartzenegger,

30
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:04,860
there's like 20 guys with machine guns
shooting at them and there's all these

31
00:02:04,861 --> 00:02:09,180
potted plants and he just runs and
kind of puts his hand up, you know,

32
00:02:09,181 --> 00:02:13,400
to guard his face from all
the, uh, thousands of bullets
that are coming at them.

33
00:02:13,401 --> 00:02:14,550
And somehow they miss him.

34
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:19,920
He runs across this fucking foyer.
I mean,

35
00:02:19,921 --> 00:02:23,280
they just kept getting more
and more ridiculous, you know,

36
00:02:23,281 --> 00:02:26,250
all the way up to like a
Steven Seagal. Well, he would,

37
00:02:26,251 --> 00:02:29,940
she would barely be moving and just
beat the shit out of an entire bar.

38
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,750
I love when they would throw a punch at
his face and he would just sort of lean

39
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,790
and just actually watch the
fiscal passed his face. Um,

40
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,990
so now just when you think that, you know,
and the dialogue was always really bad.

41
00:02:42,991 --> 00:02:46,190
So then what they did, you know what? No,

42
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,450
they all went away because
they just got so ridiculous.

43
00:02:48,451 --> 00:02:51,210
They kind of just start making action
movies for a long fucking time.

44
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:54,020
I think they did anyways.
Um,

45
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:57,690
I guess the born identities and
those were action movies, whatever.

46
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:02,650
All I know is that now they
got the lady starring in a,

47
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,780
and m for some reason,

48
00:03:04,781 --> 00:03:08,590
like I think just because people were
so educated to how fucking stupid they

49
00:03:08,591 --> 00:03:12,860
were, they actually finally decided to
start writing decent dialogue, you know,

50
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:13,930
as opposed to all this shit.

51
00:03:13,931 --> 00:03:18,931
They gave a Stallone to be a go
for a ride or what's his face?

52
00:03:20,711 --> 00:03:24,730
Schwartzenegger would rip off a steam
pipe and throw it through someone's chest

53
00:03:24,731 --> 00:03:29,190
and then be like, let off some steam.
I mean, it was literally that bad.

54
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:35,800
Don't wake my friend, he's
dead tired, this really bad.

55
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:41,370
Um, then they started actually
writing scripts and a, I guess, yeah,

56
00:03:41,371 --> 00:03:44,170
I'd like the Bourne identity.
And then you had the, uh,

57
00:03:44,171 --> 00:03:47,590
the other guy lock stock and for fucking,
who's a wants this.

58
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,720
And so now they've got the ladies are
doing them and they're actually writing

59
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:55,360
good scripts.
But you know,

60
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:59,410
it is kind of funny to watch a woman
like beating the shit out of two fucking

61
00:03:59,411 --> 00:04:03,490
400 pound guys. I mean, doesn't it
get to the point where it's like,

62
00:04:03,491 --> 00:04:07,210
I don't give a fuck how much karate,
you know, like I could just sit on you.

63
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,060
Cause that's the latest one.

64
00:04:13,061 --> 00:04:16,910
The latest ones like atomic blonde and uh,

65
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,400
they just got off take out of,

66
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:23,450
pick smaller guys because it immediately
takes me out of the movie like cheese,

67
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:27,700
what the fuck's come on.
Really. You know what I mean?

68
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:30,340
It's bad ass.
As those women are in the UFC,

69
00:04:30,341 --> 00:04:32,890
they still fight other
women because you know,

70
00:04:32,891 --> 00:04:36,430
and there's still weight classes
because at the end of the day,

71
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:40,540
if you're tall enough and your fat enough,
you can eat a lot of those punches.

72
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:46,160
Then you just, you just
smother him. Remember that?

73
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:47,720
Like when you're old brother,

74
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:52,410
your older brother would sit on your
chest and you be getting claustrophobic Ma

75
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:55,340
like that. They could just do that to
you and they would, they would win the,

76
00:04:55,341 --> 00:04:59,740
I gotta keep my voicemail. Um, yeah, they
would just win the fucking fight. So, um,

77
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,140
I'm not trying to be a party pooper here.
I'm going to go see atomic blonde,

78
00:05:03,141 --> 00:05:05,810
but it is getting to, it's a
common, you know what it is.

79
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:09,710
It's a combination of those kinds of
movies and then all those feminists tee

80
00:05:09,711 --> 00:05:12,620
shirts that I saw this week, that's
really starting to fucking annoy me.

81
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:13,611
It's like,

82
00:05:13,611 --> 00:05:16,310
do they think they're dumb enough that
they're going to get into my fucking head

83
00:05:16,311 --> 00:05:20,450
with this shit? You know, I told you
guys about that t shirt. I saw it, right?

84
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,490
This woman was walking around with
this t shirt. It said, um, uh,

85
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:29,240
what is it said a,
a a little boy.

86
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:33,530
I got a strong woman's scares a
little boy, but excites a man.

87
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:43,010
Like what kind of guy would fall for
that page one horseshit psychology.

88
00:05:43,011 --> 00:05:47,060
Like I'm going to be, or I want to be,
I want to be considered a strong band.

89
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:48,950
It's like,
Hey lady,

90
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:51,950
how about you say something
fucking impressive that I
already talked about this

91
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:54,720
already on Monday. I can't
remember. Anyways. Yeah.

92
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:58,120
So why don't you fucking say
something impressive, you know,

93
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,530
instead of having your tee
shirt and warm up the crowd.

94
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:02,303
MMM.

95
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,160
I can't remember if I told
you guys this already,

96
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:09,190
but I wanted to make a t shirt that says
a real woman isn't afraid to make her

97
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:12,960
man a sandwich every once in
a while just to get the looks.

98
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,220
See that right there, ladies. That's
exactly what we're talking about.

99
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:19,880
What are you smiling about?
Nia. You liked that one

100
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,200
in the same ole song again? Huh?
He's in the same as long. Yeah.

101
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:25,740
My singing.
What's same old song again?

102
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:26,803
Yes.

103
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:30,100
What is my same old song?
Nia,

104
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,170
you're saying, well, Song

105
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:40,930
you say move women do is have in savings
and never feeling he's still singing

106
00:06:41,191 --> 00:06:44,490
that same old. No, I don't know.
That's what I'm saying. Old Man.

107
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:48,480
That's not what I'm saying.
Prehistoric cave man.

108
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,920
Have you evolved at all in the time we've
been together or are you just singing

109
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:56,370
the same old song? Oh, if you'd let me
finish, I heard everything that you said.

110
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,280
All right. I heard you.
So drastic tee shirt.

111
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,730
Isn't a tee shirt a little ridiculous. I
mean, if I had the male version of like,

112
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,380
you know, a real woman would blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah, a little,

113
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:11,220
your take on it is actually very funny,
but it's still,

114
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:15,790
what were you talking about? You
were talking about how, oh the,

115
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:18,540
the women in the action films
like beating up like big guys,

116
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:22,980
but you're willing to suspend your
disbelief that vin diesel can drive a car

117
00:07:22,981 --> 00:07:27,540
through. Not One but two or three
buildings. In fact. No worries. No,

118
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:31,800
I'm not going to be fine. No,
I'm not. And be like, Whoa,

119
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:35,650
that was quite a ride or whatever it
is that he said. No, it's stupid. No,

120
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,900
it's absolutely stupid.

121
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:40,820
They drive from one building
to another fish tail before.

122
00:07:40,821 --> 00:07:43,470
Now it's completely stupid. I
don't want shows movies. Right.

123
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,590
So I'm just saying it
was all action films.

124
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,660
You got to suspend your
disbelief a little bit.

125
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:52,800
Daniel Craig can't beat up
like 20 guys at one time. No.

126
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,570
Been to the movie he does.
No.

127
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:56,270
Yeah, but here's the
thing. What they did was,

128
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:01,280
what they did was they'd stay started
in the 80s and it was immediately

129
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:03,350
ridiculous.
And the dialogue was horrific.

130
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:08,490
So then what they did was they started
to may have better dialogue and they

131
00:08:08,491 --> 00:08:11,060
actually have the guys get hurt
a little bit with like, you know,

132
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:15,950
fucking Bruce Willis had his bloody foot
on the glass and his wife beater just

133
00:08:15,951 --> 00:08:20,690
kept getting dirty or dirty or,
so they tried to make them real.

134
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,600
But I'm just saying when I was
watching that atomic blood,

135
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,740
she's like beating the shit out of
these two guys to like 260 pounds each.

136
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:31,490
So skies. Yeah. Once they get their
paws on you, I don't give a f if you,

137
00:08:31,491 --> 00:08:34,250
if somebody outweighs you by a hundred
pounds, once they get the hands on,

138
00:08:34,251 --> 00:08:36,440
he is fucking over when
there's two of them,

139
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,620
but it's a movie, so we go
with it. Right. I know, but

140
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:44,410
it just gets too, there is a certain
level, like me, there's a bunch of them.

141
00:08:44,411 --> 00:08:48,100
Like I never used to watch the Bourne
identity just because the way they would

142
00:08:48,101 --> 00:08:51,760
edit it, I went to one of them, I swear
to God on which set of seizure. Yeah.

143
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:56,400
The editing was like, uh, uh,
that was that, that one that uh,

144
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:01,350
woody Harrelson did. Uh, the murderers
of the boyfriend, girlfriend, murderers,

145
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,730
natural born killers. Yeah. The way that
was edited, it just, it was just like,

146
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:09,840
you know, this is fucking,
I can't, I can't watch this.
Right. The quick cuts. Yeah,

147
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:12,660
but that's what you're talking about.
You so bombarded with images.

148
00:09:12,661 --> 00:09:17,460
I get it slowly edits down please.
Right? Yeah. There was one,

149
00:09:17,461 --> 00:09:21,450
Matt Damon was like fighting a guy inside
a bathroom and like his elbow would go

150
00:09:21,451 --> 00:09:24,810
back. They follow that it through the
wall and then back to the guy's head.

151
00:09:24,811 --> 00:09:29,580
It's like Jesus fucking Christ. You know,
if these NFL running backs are like,

152
00:09:29,581 --> 00:09:31,260
can't even move until Tuesday.

153
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:35,670
The level of fighting that this guy
would do on just like every six hours.

154
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,100
Oh my God. Wait, did you see that video?

155
00:09:38,101 --> 00:09:43,050
Speaking of NFL running backs of the ex
NFL player who ran through that plate

156
00:09:43,051 --> 00:09:47,580
glass, that glass door and his wife
thinks he's suffering from some, like,

157
00:09:47,581 --> 00:09:51,240
you know, post traumatic stress in
his brain, it's called something CTE.

158
00:09:51,241 --> 00:09:54,270
Did you see that video? He know,
but I'm trying not to laugh.

159
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:58,560
He of literary sprints through a glass
or when he doesn't remember doing it.

160
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:01,440
Don't love it.

161
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,030
It is definitely sad,

162
00:10:03,031 --> 00:10:07,050
but that is fucking hilarious that he's
just like walking into a dental office

163
00:10:07,051 --> 00:10:11,570
and all of a sudden he just,
he is 60 49 boots. Blue,

164
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:16,590
sad. I'm just fucking,
how can run through it?

165
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:19,860
No, that should there it's
ruining their brains. Like,

166
00:10:19,861 --> 00:10:22,050
isn't that like what are they going to do?
What are they going to do with,

167
00:10:22,051 --> 00:10:24,300
did he spike his wallet after
he went through the window?

168
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:29,540
No, because it fell down after
he crashed through the glass.

169
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:33,620
As long as he just walked in with his
wife and all of a sudden he just fucking

170
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:34,850
mid conversation.

171
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:38,900
He was talking to police or
something about something.

172
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:43,430
Maybe he was having some sort of episode
and then he just took off and he ran

173
00:10:43,431 --> 00:10:47,380
right through this. Like Glassdoor. I got
a grocery store. Is he black or white?

174
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:48,130
Black.

175
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:49,430
All right. He's talking to the cops. Yeah.

176
00:10:49,431 --> 00:10:51,800
There's probably some shit from his
childhood. You can't blame the NFL.

177
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,660
I thought the cops don't
treat you guys well.

178
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,613
He ran,

179
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:00,380
he ran through a glass door and
he doesn't remember doing it.

180
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:03,270
So his wife was like, I
think he's got, you know,

181
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,870
his brain is all fucked
up from playing football.

182
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:07,280
So where are they going to do about that?

183
00:11:07,281 --> 00:11:10,180
Can they put more padding
in the helmet or like how,

184
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:13,330
no, cause what happened, what it
is is your brain sits and fluid.

185
00:11:13,331 --> 00:11:18,331
So it's going to take some fucking like
crazy brainiac to have like something

186
00:11:19,631 --> 00:11:23,530
that somehow keeps your brain stationary.
The helmet fucking moves,

187
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:27,460
but your head doesn't see,
your brain doesn't smash
against it. I mean, personally,

188
00:11:27,461 --> 00:11:32,290
if I was Oj Simpson's lawyer back
in 1994 that's what I would've said.

189
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:36,460
I would've said, oh, Jay suffers from CTE.

190
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:41,350
He had been watching the cooking channel
or this Ginsu knife commercial and he

191
00:11:41,351 --> 00:11:43,960
just got a little confused. Right. Well,

192
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:48,370
whatever you would of Ron Goldman looked
like Vince Ferragamo and he never liked

193
00:11:48,371 --> 00:11:52,090
the ramps. I mean, that's the best I
could've come up with. Sure, sure. Well,

194
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:56,970
it's a comedy podcast. If
he brings something up, what
am I supposed to do? No,

195
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:01,420
I'm laughing on the inside.
It's an inner cry Bitch.

196
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:06,370
Yeah. Did you see that?
You want to see, okay,

197
00:12:06,371 --> 00:12:09,070
now if we're going to just talk about
horrible fucking things, did you see that,

198
00:12:09,071 --> 00:12:10,000
that fear,

199
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:15,350
that carnival out there and I'm
in Ohio with somebody one on one,

200
00:12:15,351 --> 00:12:19,840
like one of those tilt a world rides in
the fucking thing snapped and all these

201
00:12:19,841 --> 00:12:22,690
poor people went flying through the year.
One person died.

202
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:24,670
This little girl was laying on the ground.

203
00:12:24,671 --> 00:12:27,070
It's one of the most horrific
things I've ever seen.

204
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:31,690
And then like investigators are looking
in to see what the problem is. It's like,

205
00:12:31,691 --> 00:12:36,610
you know what the fucking problem is? They
don't maintain those things. I used to,

206
00:12:36,611 --> 00:12:40,690
uh, I used to go to that a, I don't
want to, I don't get in trouble here.

207
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:42,563
Uh,

208
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:46,230
it rhymes with seven
and a homophobic slur.

209
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,373
No,
no.

210
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:53,930
I should say I'm going to do one,
six homophobic slurs

211
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:59,790
a lot. You don't know that one. You
used to go to a what? Where you weigh,

212
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:03,260
what is it? What is a was
the country wave. Yeah.

213
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:07,220
Oh yes, yes. So I went there and

214
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:14,270
so I went there,
seven banners,

215
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,510
banners for seven brothers.

216
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:22,900
Why can't you say where it was you
think they're going to like not want to?

217
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,170
I mean it happened.

218
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,320
I was at the one that rhymes with a
ring wield massive two sets and um,

219
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:34,740
I got, uh, I was, I was on
the roller coaster right.

220
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,360
And we got off it and the time it took
us to stand in line and the ride next to

221
00:13:40,851 --> 00:13:44,780
us, we lined up, you know, line
moved twice. We just heard Bam.

222
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:50,300
And the rollercoaster that was ending
the ride did not stop and rear ended the

223
00:13:50,511 --> 00:13:52,760
ride in front of it.
And this woman broke her cheekbone.

224
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,820
Do you remember the time we went to
that other one that rhymes with the six

225
00:13:55,821 --> 00:14:00,821
homophobic slurs out in
a new war Z and we were,

226
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:04,160
we were in that, that superman
roller coaster and we, we got like,

227
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:07,790
we were waiting to get off it and then
it would move and then we was stuck in

228
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:11,960
those. Yeah, it was really horrific.
How many minutes? 30 minutes. No,

229
00:14:11,961 --> 00:14:15,620
it wasn't 30 he was probably like four
minutes. Five minutes, 30 minutes.

230
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:18,770
It might've been like 10 but I was
sitting there and I felt you starting to

231
00:14:18,771 --> 00:14:21,380
freak out and I was like,
well,

232
00:14:21,381 --> 00:14:24,290
if I wanted to I could wiggle my way out
of this and the second I couldn't move.

233
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,810
All of a sudden I started feeling
shortness of breath and I was like,

234
00:14:26,811 --> 00:14:28,760
hold it together.
Bill holds it together.

235
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,750
I believe we actually went to that place.
I assume that was my idea.

236
00:14:32,751 --> 00:14:36,650
I don't think you would ever suggest
going to a theme park as a date.

237
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,780
It didn't you weren't you?

238
00:14:38,781 --> 00:14:43,490
The one that taught me that macaroni and
cheese is not a main dish. Yes, I was.

239
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:47,000
I'm, I'm this weird
combination of, you know,

240
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:51,920
professional white collars in white trash.
Oh yeah.

241
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:56,630
We weren't good with money. That was
a period we were not good at money,

242
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:01,580
so we used to have a tray and
macaroni cheese with toast. Yeah,

243
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:05,480
that's fun. Male. That's fucking
delicious. The craft frozen.

244
00:15:05,481 --> 00:15:10,320
You just throw it in there. God, how
dare you. White people go the anime,

245
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:13,760
macaroni and cheese. It's
pasta. It's from Italians,

246
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,340
so you can only take 50% of the credit.

247
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,360
Italians would be offended that
you use Kraft macaroni and cheese.

248
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,620
Wait a minute at do they
make macaroni and cheese?

249
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,850
That's not their thing yet is macaroni
and cheese. That's one of the,

250
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:27,711
you meet an Italian.

251
00:15:27,711 --> 00:15:29,510
That's one of the first things
that they say when they meet him.

252
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:33,620
Now he wants a go wrong.
Maybe it's big ship,

253
00:15:33,621 --> 00:15:38,390
but beef on toast.
Now remember when you get Alec King?

254
00:15:38,391 --> 00:15:40,940
I made fun of me because
I was like making a jet.

255
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:44,360
We went out to dinner the other night and
I was sort of like lovingly doing this

256
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:48,050
kind of like know your worth and now it
was because, because we were in, okay.

257
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:51,710
First of all, when I'm on my podcast
and I'm just being silly now,

258
00:15:51,711 --> 00:15:54,410
if you did what you did in little
Italy the other night in the,

259
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,800
in this apartment, I would have
laughed. We were sitting there, right?

260
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:02,630
I took near to where we
got this restaurant. When
I first met my lovely wife,

261
00:16:02,631 --> 00:16:07,550
I took her to like 10 years ago. Right.
So I'm trying like all day going, yeah.

262
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:11,720
Saying let's whatever it saint, let's
fucking go there. She's like, Ooh,

263
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:15,230
I want to go to the stone
cold creamery and fucking uh,

264
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:20,270
what's that other stupid burger place that
everybody eats? Like it's crack. What?

265
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:24,660
Shake shack. Shake shack. Like this day
I want to go to shake shack over this.

266
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,480
Anyway, whatever. Just tell the story.

267
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:31,040
We'd go and she wanted to go to some
shiny place and I wanted to go to the

268
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:34,970
fucking old school home style. You know,
you order like chicken parm is Sean.

269
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:38,210
It's like, is that it does that,
uh, how long did you hammer this?

270
00:16:38,211 --> 00:16:41,150
That this is only one chicken breast.
This is like nine chicken breasts.

271
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,630
And then you fucking plow your way
through it. You wish you didn't need it,

272
00:16:44,631 --> 00:16:49,190
but it was delicious. So we go there and
they're playing all this Italian music,

273
00:16:49,191 --> 00:16:52,670
right? They got Dana on
where the moon hits your eye,

274
00:16:52,671 --> 00:16:57,560
like a big pizza applied
at so more the Nia does,

275
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:00,530
you know that thing that you
know in Hollywood movies,

276
00:17:00,531 --> 00:17:04,400
one of the Italian like something when
he puts his thumb between his index and

277
00:17:04,401 --> 00:17:07,400
his middle finger brings them
together with both hands,

278
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:11,480
like going back and forth, back and
forth like that. So good a pizza sauce.

279
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:16,160
So the songs on and Nia starts doing that
at the table, sticking her bottom lip.

280
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,320
Other key,
you'll book a little book,

281
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:21,800
but like in a fun wags and bouncing
lot of the music they were playing.

282
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:25,570
I had to do that, Dah, Dah, Dah,
Dah. And I was like, you know,

283
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,370
I was just doing the whole,
and I said,

284
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:31,100
what if we were up in Harlem and
some soulful restaurant? Okay.

285
00:17:31,101 --> 00:17:34,470
And they started playing some fucking
RB or whatever the fuck you guys are

286
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:35,240
listening to.

287
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,380
And I started to doing a bad version of
some break dance and shit sticking my

288
00:17:39,381 --> 00:17:40,820
bottom lip out.
You'd be like,

289
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:44,270
if you don't stop fucking doing that and
you're sitting there with a white man,

290
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:48,500
Nia Huh? What do you think when you think
would happen? I was saying just show,

291
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:50,450
hey,
it was out of respect.

292
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:54,060
You though was culturally insensitive
of me to do that. I didn't give a shit.

293
00:17:54,061 --> 00:17:55,860
I thought it was funny,
but I didn't need the waiters.

294
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,680
We still hadn't gotten all of our foods
so I didn't need you fucking with our

295
00:17:58,681 --> 00:17:59,300
food less.

296
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:03,030
Then they had the whole rack of glasses
and stuff like right by the window.

297
00:18:03,031 --> 00:18:05,130
Like right behind me. We
were sitting, I mean come on.

298
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,610
Can I ask you a question if I took you
to Chinatown was delicious though by the

299
00:18:08,611 --> 00:18:12,130
way. Delicious. Delish delish
now if I took it again,

300
00:18:12,131 --> 00:18:16,500
delete if I took you to Chinatown.
Okay.

301
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,770
And they were playing the, you
know what it did that, that, that,

302
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:22,110
that that day we went in because
apparently that's offensive. Okay.

303
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:27,210
We started playing high. Yo, Yo, Yo,
Yo, Yo, Yo, Yo know if you were a,

304
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,540
if they started playing some company,
was Kung Fu fighting, would you,

305
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:35,340
what would you, what would you
be doing? I go start doing,

306
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:44,400
everybody was calm and it will
be offensive be yeah, right.

307
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,200
I mean, I don't know. I
wasn't, I really wasn't not,

308
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,750
I'm not trying to be
political correct guy.

309
00:18:48,751 --> 00:18:50,640
I'm just trying to get people
not to spit in my food.

310
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,840
That's all I'm trying to do it.

311
00:18:55,850 --> 00:19:00,850
It wasn't like talking to the waiter like
a by then bring me some fucking Vinnie

312
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,310
Gabon. Ooh. Like I was trying to that
shit. Like I was on the fucking Sopranos.

313
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:10,470
I wasn't doing that. All right.
I mean, your, your point is made.

314
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,080
My point is not about
being culturally sensitive.

315
00:19:13,081 --> 00:19:15,390
It's about Kevin people not
fuck with your food. Okay.

316
00:19:15,391 --> 00:19:18,570
You want to do that on your own,
your own time.

317
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:22,650
You want to go on and get a Bagel
and be like, oh, a VA with a lady,

318
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:27,630
you're going to get an everything
Bagel like you never had before,

319
00:19:27,631 --> 00:19:31,530
if you know what I mean.
There. I mean everything.

320
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,590
Is that a Matzoh ball there?
Um,

321
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:43,870
anyways, uh, you got
to wrap this up, right?

322
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:46,120
I don't have to wrap it up cause I don't,
I like that.

323
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:48,010
I've only been doing 20 minutes.
Oh,

324
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:52,350
I got to read some are I got to read some,
uh,

325
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:54,450
advertising advertising some time,

326
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,510
but I know I'm not supposed to
because why aren't you supposed to?

327
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,350
Because they want you
to read the advertise.

328
00:19:59,351 --> 00:20:03,510
No one's no one's paying for me to read
it. They want you to read it. Yeah.

329
00:20:03,511 --> 00:20:05,760
Everybody knows that. Why don't
you have to bring that up? I know,

330
00:20:05,761 --> 00:20:09,830
but I'm just saying I want
some weird woman thing trying
to mind. Fuck me to get,

331
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:12,300
yes, that's it. You to put
it on a tee shirt. Yep.

332
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:14,420
[inaudible] Yup.

333
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,580
It's a great one. That chief, hold on me.

334
00:20:16,581 --> 00:20:19,880
The other night we were laying in bed
and all the lights were out and we both

335
00:20:19,881 --> 00:20:22,640
tired and there's a lamp like across
the room sitting there. She's like,

336
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:27,270
how do you turn that lamp off?
And I'm like,

337
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,720
I dunno Nia. You get up, you
walk over and you turn it off.

338
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:38,820
I'll show you. How dumb do you think
I am? I am dumb. I'm not that dumb

339
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:44,280
paint here. Go take some karate classes
and beat up all my tall friends.

340
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:48,040
I want to see that. The
Black Tux, everybody.

341
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:53,380
Um, see you see this, and again, this
is another progression for your people.

342
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,220
What are you talking about?
He used to just back in the day,

343
00:20:56,221 --> 00:21:01,180
he's just be the white Tux. No,
no. This isn't one of those things.

344
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:04,630
Let's see how you can get through
this. This the reed. Okay.

345
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,970
Nice and slow so you don't mess up.

346
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,750
You can make fun of me all you want,
but you married me.

347
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:15,200
You've hitched your wagon to this
wasn't listening to what you listen to,

348
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:19,810
what you hitched your wagon
to the Black Tux. You know,

349
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:25,260
there's only so many opportunities
in life to wear a Tuxedo at Saks,

350
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,793
at tux.

351
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:31,900
So when your big day or special event
rolls around or you'd have to go to court,

352
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,630
you've got to go to court. That's a good
move. Show up in a Tuxedo you were on.

353
00:21:36,631 --> 00:21:39,670
It may approach the
bench with my cumber Bun.

354
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,900
So when your big day or special
event rolls around this summer, look,

355
00:21:43,901 --> 00:21:47,170

00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:59,250
The Black Tux gives you a new way to rent.
Okay.

359
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:02,540
Why do you keep putting
the emphasis on the, Oh,

360
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:06,110
cause I always watched football and
they go the Ohio State University. Okay.

361
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:09,700
All only the capital letter once and I'll
yell at the capital level noise, right?

sunscreen and we'll have a qs.

396
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:39,500
Uh, but the most important thing to do
this summer is prepare for your family's

397
00:24:39,501 --> 00:24:42,380
future with an estate plan
from legal zoom. Exactly.

398
00:24:42,381 --> 00:24:44,900
But if the Hibachi blows
up in your face there,

399
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,610
and next thing you know somebody
doesn't have a flatter, sorry,

national make a will month is right
around the corner and that's the perfect

401
00:24:53,541 --> 00:24:56,720
time to make sure you're prepared
for the future. How do you,

402
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:59,300
who do you have to pay off to
have them must be about you.

403
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:02,840
You know when they're like,
today is national pancake day.

404
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:07,700
Somebody lobbies for that. And how
relieved of those senators, you know,

405
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,380
usually there's some sort of pill.

406
00:25:09,381 --> 00:25:13,340
It's literally going to fucking kill
children in some godforsaken place.

407
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,400
This is this next bill's about pancakes.

408
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:21,110
And for once people with red ties and
blue ties can all get along because who

409
00:25:21,111 --> 00:25:24,860
doesn't like pancakes? Um, it helps
to know what your options are.

How about the Red Sox? They finally
want to have to drop in four in a row.

428
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,180
They lost the last two.
The angels,

429
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:45,181
they lost the first two to Seattle before
they finally beat the fucking Bareness

430
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:50,550
and the Yankees starting to surge the
only end game and a half out, you know,

431
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:54,030
which is crazy because there's
only like 50 games left.

432
00:26:55,370 --> 00:27:00,210
Uh, how much time have I done here? I
got to get going. Cause this sad van.

433
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,140
Yeah. You familiar with the sad
van that takes you to the set?

434
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:08,780
You know it's even past.
Yeah, the 15 passenger. Yeah.

435
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:13,290
All White Gray, vinyl. You
know what about it? I know,

436
00:27:13,291 --> 00:27:18,220
I always find it depressing. Why? I always
liked, I always liked the union guy.

437
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:21,930
That set. Yeah, I know.
But they could, you know,

438
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:25,290
could they couldn't get like the fucking,
the cloth seats,

439
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,840
everything. She's, you could literally,

440
00:27:30,841 --> 00:27:34,390
you could beat the shit out of the inside
of the, of everything. Plastic. Yeah.

441
00:27:34,391 --> 00:27:38,490
Excited to go to your sex and
the city remake goods. You Doing?

442
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:44,150
Yeah, I'm playing, but it's
an all male version. No,

443
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:48,760
I'm playing Cynthia Nixon and she
trends she got, she's transgender.

444
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:52,850
She always, she always
related male. And uh,

445
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:56,550
so somewhere during the best
actress on this, you know,

446
00:27:56,551 --> 00:27:59,670
it's great if you transition
from, oh no, wait a second.

447
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:03,980
If you transitioned from woman
to a man, yes. All right.

448
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:05,880
Can you go ball dead?

449
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:12,540
Maybe like if they start giving
you a male hormones, I don't know.

450
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:16,410
If you get the good hormones, can you be
like, listen, I want the fucking who's,

451
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:18,180
who's got the great full head of hair,

452
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:22,650
who's got the Kennedys always had
great heads of hair, right? Yeah.

453
00:28:22,651 --> 00:28:26,200
Like he'd get the Kennedy Cheat Hormone.

454
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:30,030
Can they do that yet? That's not an
marina I'm willing to step into. I'm not,

455
00:28:30,031 --> 00:28:32,580
I'm not willing to step into
that conversation cause I don't,

456
00:28:32,581 --> 00:28:37,110
I don't know anything about why because
I'm not saying they can't join the coast

457
00:28:37,111 --> 00:28:41,910
guard. Well, Trump did. I know.
That's what I'm saying. The joke.

458
00:28:41,911 --> 00:28:46,380
Okay, sorry. Um, isn't that
a good thing though? No.

459
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:50,070
Who the fuck cares? I wish
she banned redhead. Some going
to war. I'd be like, Whoa,

460
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:56,460
my man. Both of you again. Hey,

461
00:28:56,461 --> 00:28:59,490
could you vote for me now that I don't
have to pay taxes, how about that?

462
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:03,121
Oh good.

463
00:29:03,121 --> 00:29:07,320
I don't have to go down to
some godforsaken bootcamp
and get screamed at by some

464
00:29:07,321 --> 00:29:12,000
fucking guy whose mom never hugged
him. I get it. Where I'm from,

465
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:16,560
livestock into homosexuals are
from, I understand sir. Wow.

466
00:29:16,561 --> 00:29:19,740
Look at all the extra stripes you
have on your shirt versus mine.

467
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:22,410
Why in God's name would
I want to go do that

468
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:28,500
to get a free pair of 10 bullets?
I would definitely be that guy.

469
00:29:28,501 --> 00:29:32,100
If I was in the military,
who at the end of my hitch,

470
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:33,510
whatever the terminology would be,

471
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:37,170
I would definitely be the guy
who takes apart his weapon in,

472
00:29:37,171 --> 00:29:39,600
starts to mail it home,
bolt by bolt.

473
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:45,640
That's why I didn't join.
I would do some dumb shit like that.

474
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,690
I try to figure out how to take apart
a grenade so I could be the hit at the,

475
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:53,140
at the 4th of July party. Um, alright,

476
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:56,620
what do we got here at 29 minutes
and 54 seconds. All right.

477
00:29:56,621 --> 00:30:00,960
I'm contractually obligated to do
30 seconds. I mean 30 minutes. Um,

478
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,410
so, all right. Whose contract?

479
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:08,020
I have a contract with the people
and the people's King. Yes.

480
00:30:08,021 --> 00:30:09,280
I have a people's contract.

481
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:13,480
I told them back in 2007 that I was
going to make podcasting great again.

482
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:18,400
Hey, I want you to think about how much
money you think Obama's make it tonight.

483
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,660
What's he gonna say? Oh
Dude, he's got his keys.

484
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:25,690
Got a tour that's bigger than Kevin
Hart. Actually, I don't think he is.

485
00:30:25,691 --> 00:30:29,940
I think Kevin's still make it more, he
has a $69 million toward, he's still

486
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:35,740
giving Rah Rah speeches to corporations,
you know,

487
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:37,150
thousand points of light.

488
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:43,450
He's getting his bribe money near him.
And what's his wife's name? Penelope.

489
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:48,490
How'd the area, her name is Michelle.
Michelle. I know she tweeted so much.

490
00:30:48,491 --> 00:30:52,210
I should have known what
her name was. Don't ever
disrespect Michelle Obama. Yeah.

491
00:30:52,211 --> 00:30:55,120
Why do they try to act like the wife of
the guy who was actually doing the job?

492
00:30:55,121 --> 00:30:57,160
And so God damn important.
No, I don't understand that.

493
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:59,990
All around the world. Same. So,

494
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:05,100
Huh? Who's Martha
Steward? Dayton. I Dunno.

495
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,450
What the fuck he does was nice to have
you heard Stedman say something on

496
00:31:08,451 --> 00:31:12,140
Twitter, Huh? I'm
telling you those ladies,

497
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,600
they got their bitches in line.

498
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:20,540
I'm just fucking around. Hey Nia, do you
want to make fun of my hat before we go?

499
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:25,850
Oh my God. Okay, so let me do that. Let me
get, no, no, I'm going to go back story.

500
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:30,550
Bill fucking bought
a Sassy Midwestern mom,

501
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,600
New York tourist hat,
and it's the most ridiculously I.

502
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:36,970
Can I please take a picture
of you in it and tweet it?

503
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:40,860
Yes. This is what happened. Um,

504
00:31:40,861 --> 00:31:45,420
as bald as Charlie Brown, actually, he
says at one curly cute thing and, uh,

505
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:49,830
the sun was out tomorrow,
the sun was out and I just,

506
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,850
it was just fucking a Hot New York
day and I didn't have my hat because I

507
00:31:53,851 --> 00:31:58,790
fucking worked out with my Nike
hat and I needed one because, uh,

508
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,680
I actually used to think you have,
I'm so pacing.

509
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:04,680
If I got a little bit of Sun that
would be good. But it's bad. Yes,

510
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:06,990
it's bad cause you come in and yeah,
I come in red and they're like,

511
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:09,420
what the fuck do we do with this?
Uh,

512
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:14,310
so I had to put a hat on so I didn't
fuck up my Cynthia Nixon acts acting gig

513
00:32:14,311 --> 00:32:16,800
here. And uh, so you know,

514
00:32:16,801 --> 00:32:20,460
all they have this time of year is they
just have all these New York City had

515
00:32:20,461 --> 00:32:21,510
some down in the village.

516
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:25,950
So I was in a bind and they didn't
have a mirror and I bought it.

517
00:32:25,951 --> 00:32:28,770
And it's like literally, you know
those, you know those shirts. Jay Leno,

518
00:32:28,771 --> 00:32:31,030
where's with the gene?
Gene gets like, yeah,

519
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:36,090
it denim, it's a denim hat. It's in
a mat. Oh, New York City hat. It,

520
00:32:36,091 --> 00:32:39,770
it's the kind of had that a white
Midwestern mom would wear. Be like, Ooh,

521
00:32:39,771 --> 00:32:44,630
I gotta I gotta I got a hat from, from
New York City, let kids, I got a hat,

522
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:49,050
like a baseball hat. Like you guys have.
Like, that's exactly what this is. That is

523
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:52,900
the woman on set was making fun of it. I
said, how awful it was this. And she goes,

524
00:32:52,901 --> 00:32:56,320
it's pretty awful. I go look at this
cool t shirt. My wife bought me.

525
00:32:56,321 --> 00:32:57,790
I go and I just ruined it with his hat.

526
00:32:57,791 --> 00:33:02,020
And she goes pretty much like she was
giving me no day. Like she wasn't,

527
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:04,260
there was no out. Nothing. All right,

528
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:09,390
well I'll through the MLM podcast will
tweet out a picture of my awful hat.

529
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:14,210
Um, all right, fuck hoes

530
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:15,940
transitioning into a,
some,

531
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,740
an extra 30 minutes here of a greatest
hits from a Thursday afternoon,

532
00:33:20,741 --> 00:33:23,960
just before Friday. Monday
morning podcasts from a
Thursday afternoon. That one

533
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,450
bye but is no longer here,
but they'll never be forgotten.

534
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:56,140
Fun
to give it a nine.

535
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:56,983
The Shah

536
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:02,430
Ooze Harley started carefully from

537
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,270
becoming something that then

538
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,590
stay.

539
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:47,170
Hey, you know what people wanted me
to talk about Jay z and salon. Oh,

540
00:34:47,171 --> 00:34:50,800
the elevator fight. Uh, whatever the
hell are fucking name. That's her name.

541
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:54,850
I'm sick of Jay z wearing that.
Roger Moore Tuxedo. We get it.

542
00:34:55,690 --> 00:35:00,620
You're fucking cool enough already. It's
Tom Ford. Oh, is that what that is? Yeah.

543
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:03,880
I don't fucking know. I always forget
at this point. Jay Z so famous.

544
00:35:03,881 --> 00:35:07,660
You forget he's from Brooklyn and he
fucking grew up in a street corner.

545
00:35:07,661 --> 00:35:11,200
It can still beat the shit out of you.
You know, although him with his shirt off,

546
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:16,260
you know, I dunno. He's definitely
a businessman either. Yeah,

547
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:19,450
exactly.
He's fine dining.

548
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:24,190
He's eating like steak and wine and
like what songs? He is not keen.

549
00:35:24,191 --> 00:35:28,150
90 exits. I can tell you this doesn't
need to do all. He's got the gift of Gab.

550
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:31,740
He doesn't need to do all it doesn't,
it doesn't. You know what, I've,

551
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:36,370
I've had enough arguments that people,
God bless him and his Roger Moore Tuxedo.

552
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:41,460
Did you talk the elevator fight?
Have you cut? I'll talk about it.

553
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:44,170
Oh, I'll talk about
it. Write down all day.

554
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:47,880
I thought Jay Z,

555
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:52,910
regardless of whatever the fuck he said
that set her off showed unbelievable

556
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:58,970
restraint. Okay. Getting kicked
by a woman in high heels.

557
00:35:58,971 --> 00:36:01,920
Shoes. I've been there. Okay.
That five fucking hurts.

558
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:06,570
And he kept taking it to the hands
and there was a moment at one,

559
00:36:06,571 --> 00:36:10,800
I only watched it once. There was a time,
like one of the last times she hit him,

560
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:13,470
she even flinched cause she was like,
yeah,

561
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:18,000
at this point he decided deserve to get
punched in the face. You see her flinch,

562
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:23,160
she's spit at him. That was
what, it was really awful.

563
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:25,440
That's what I forgot to do
to that driver this morning.

564
00:36:25,441 --> 00:36:29,980
That would have been clowning bitch,
move. I never do that. No, no, no.

565
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,230
But you know, their family has
problems like anybody else's family.

566
00:36:34,231 --> 00:36:36,510
I feel like if anything,
it just, you know,

567
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:41,190
it just goes to show you
that you shouldn't feel bad
when you know your uncles

568
00:36:41,191 --> 00:36:43,770
or whatever, start screaming at
each other over thanksgiving.

569
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:44,911
That is funny though,

570
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:47,640
when you really think about how
many people are tour judging them.

571
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:52,560
Actually there's footage that exists
somewhere of their family fighting in an

572
00:36:52,561 --> 00:36:55,110
elevator. It's just they're
not famous and nobody cares.

573
00:36:57,390 --> 00:37:00,840
It just gets taped over.
I feel like a lot of,

574
00:37:00,841 --> 00:37:04,050
there are a lot more like physical
fights that happen in families between

575
00:37:04,051 --> 00:37:09,010
siblings and stuff that most people
wouldn't want to admit. You know? So I, I,

576
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:13,350
I really don't think it's that big of a
deal. I was watching it like salons stop.

577
00:37:13,351 --> 00:37:18,190
No, he definitely said something fucked
up because Beyonce did do anything. She,

578
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:21,630
she was, she was standing at with
her sister. She was probably like,

579
00:37:21,631 --> 00:37:25,830
well that's what happens when you
say x, Y, and z. That was her vibe.

580
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:33,690
Uh, yeah. So, but I, it's not that big
of a deal. I don't feel like, you know.

581
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:36,990
No, that's kind of a big no, that's
a tough, that's that's it's over.

582
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:41,340
Their relationship is fucking
over and if money wasn't involved,

583
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:45,730
whose relationship? Jay Z's
and the fucking large, yeah,

584
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:50,660
those side kick there. She's
not, yeah, she is. Come on.

585
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:55,230
She's frank. Frank Stallone. No, no.

586
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:58,950
She has a really good album and I love
her music and she has great style. No,

587
00:37:58,951 --> 00:38:03,420
she thought was famous as Beyonce
obviously and all these dumb ass Internet

588
00:38:03,421 --> 00:38:06,030
people on Twitter like I've never
even heard of her until knows.

589
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:10,030
You should be thankful she got
any classes. This is my theory.

590
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:14,460
Don't know music beyond what's on
your top 40 radio station. Hey,

591
00:38:14,461 --> 00:38:16,230
play in the morning while
you're going to work.

592
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:18,690
Doesn't mean that this
person isn't talented. No,

593
00:38:18,691 --> 00:38:21,770
I just get annoyed with that is
first of vegans down the music level.

594
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,133
This is the deal.

595
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:30,500
The only way she can make it as if she's
in the same group is Beyonce because

596
00:38:30,931 --> 00:38:33,210
that's the way it fucking works.
There's no way.

597
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:38,300
Never in the history of two people in
the same family trying to be as solo

598
00:38:39,461 --> 00:38:41,410
artists. Have they ever
made it? They always,

599
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:45,940
you gotta beat together the
Everly brothers, the Jackson five,

600
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:47,403
the Osmonds.

601
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:51,490
And then what happens is somebody breaks
out of it and then the rest of them go

602
00:38:51,491 --> 00:38:55,780
back to the dinner table going, I have an
album out to whenever. He's like, yeah,

603
00:38:55,781 --> 00:38:59,710
we don't care. I know I'm
your mother. I don't care.

604
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:05,080
Michael is special.
Donny and Marie are the best.

605
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:10,960
They're younger than you. They're shooter
than you. And Jesus likes them better.

606
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:12,670
And that's what happens and you're fucked.

607
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:17,740
So the only move she had was
when Beyonce was on the way up.

608
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:20,170
She should have been a Destiny's child.
Look at me,

609
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:24,440
look at me on the other side of the
fence. Just calling off groups here. Well,

610
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:27,520
she was, well, she in
that group, she was like,

611
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:32,340
I thought it was Kim Coles and a
that chick from, uh, from uh, uh,

612
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:34,830
one of the roller skates.
Tootie, wasn't she? That

613
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:40,900
it is his name and black
people now? Yeah. Um, no,

614
00:39:40,901 --> 00:39:44,380
she was like a backup dancer. She went
on tour with them when she was younger.

615
00:39:44,381 --> 00:39:47,470
She had an album when she was younger.
She got pregnant.

616
00:39:47,471 --> 00:39:51,970
She moved up to like I was
Oklahoma as a backup dancer.

617
00:39:51,971 --> 00:39:55,570
I was remember that Ac DC,
that ACDC video.

618
00:39:55,571 --> 00:39:58,770
Who made who when I had all the Angus is
up there. I always was one of the Angus.

619
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:03,060
She also, she also, I didn't really
people I didn't know. I wish I did. Hey,

620
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:07,480
she also wrote quite a few of Beyonce
songs and like call wrote some of destiny

621
00:40:07,481 --> 00:40:12,210
tryouts on too, so you know she's, she's
got other talents, things you know,

622
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:17,850
she doesn't need to be as famous
like that chick and I say,

623
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:21,900
hey,
when did Barry no,

624
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,990
that's what's going on. Her
name is Linda. No it isn't.

625
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:30,580
It is it called Jessica?
It's not, you know I'm right.

626
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:31,570
I don't know what her name is.

627
00:40:31,571 --> 00:40:36,280
Four non blondes lead singer Linda Perry
recently married to Sarah Gilbert from

628
00:40:36,281 --> 00:40:40,880
Roseanne. Did you know that you
could play Darlene? They're,

629
00:40:40,881 --> 00:40:43,960
they're married. The last
time I saw her, Linda Perry,

630
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,580
not the last time like I see her,
but I saw her blonde chick.

631
00:40:48,581 --> 00:40:51,490
Isn't she like fuck,
she's got to be my age probably.

632
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:54,280
What's she going around with that little
girl for? What are you talking about?

633
00:40:54,281 --> 00:40:56,980
Sarah Gilbert is older than I am.
I saw the show the other day.

634
00:40:56,981 --> 00:40:59,350
She's like 12th that's
cause she looks great.

635
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:02,880
Like I was watching the fucking TV show

636
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:06,910
bombing all over the place.

637
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:11,303
Ooh.

638
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:31,780
Yeah.

639
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:32,613
Wow.

640
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:56,940
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burr
and it is the Monday morning podcast.

641
00:41:58,450 --> 00:42:00,130
Monday,
July 27th,

642
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:05,700
two south 2009 2000 2009 and uh,

643
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:10,500
uh, the year of the current on, if

644
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:17,840
I can never remember what year it
is and the Chinese knew it's the,

645
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:22,180
is it the year of the pig? I think
it is the year of the pig, isn't it?

646
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:26,110
I saw a thing the other night where you
know that those shows where they have

647
00:42:26,111 --> 00:42:28,120
people,
they flip houses,

648
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:33,720
they buy some dilapidated hunk of ship
from some old lady who just died when she

649
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:38,170
fucking passed out face first and her
fucking dog food because it got damn

650
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:43,030
bankers killed a formal referral. One
K. Right. Do All people have 401ks?

651
00:42:43,031 --> 00:42:46,420
Did they have that back in the day when
they went by in war bonds. I'm like,

652
00:42:46,421 --> 00:42:50,800
dog sleeping over there. Look
at her. Fucking adorable. Um,

653
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:55,300
anyways, um, yeah, I was watching
this thing. We know what they flipped.

654
00:42:55,301 --> 00:42:59,380
I hate those shows where they
flip the houses because uh,

655
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:02,020
you just see people getting
completely fucked over.

656
00:43:02,021 --> 00:43:04,600
You get a couple of shitheads,
they don't even know what they're doing.

657
00:43:04,601 --> 00:43:09,450
And then they go in there and they,
uh, they go to Grossman's or, uh,

658
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:11,800
what's some awful hardware store?
Home Depot.

659
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:15,610
They go down there and they buy a bunch
of cheap tiles and then everybody walks

660
00:43:15,611 --> 00:43:20,290
in like, oh my God, it's beautiful.
Look, look at the tile work.

661
00:43:20,291 --> 00:43:24,890
And it was like done by this fucking
accountant. You know, I hate to,

662
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:28,150
they know this old house. Like it's,
that guy gave a shit about the house.

663
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:32,710
Now they'd say they should just, they
just showing people getting fucked over.

664
00:43:32,770 --> 00:43:36,580
I can't stand that when people walk in
and then they think that the place looks

665
00:43:36,581 --> 00:43:41,581
amazing because they changed the brown
paint to read and that opens the room up

666
00:43:41,891 --> 00:43:42,340
or whatever.

667
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:46,330
Fucking mind trick they used and it's
still the exact same piece of shit house.

668
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:51,130
And these guys sell it to these fucking
morons for an extra 40 grand when all

669
00:43:51,131 --> 00:43:53,880
they had to do was buy a bucket of paint.
You know?

670
00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:56,470
You know what that reminds me of?

671
00:43:56,471 --> 00:44:01,471
I hate those commercials now where they're
trying to make it seem like fast food

672
00:44:01,841 --> 00:44:06,841
is at the level of a five star restaurant
and they get these white trash fucking

673
00:44:07,601 --> 00:44:11,740
idiots, and they just see a
tablecloth and some cloth napkin.

674
00:44:11,741 --> 00:44:15,310
And then they bring in some pizza
hut and they're eating their pasta.

675
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:20,260
Have you seen that commercial?
And that girl was like, oh
my God, it's so decadent.

676
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:25,240
Who the fuck uses that word when
they're talking about pasta?

677
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:30,850
It's decorated. You know? It's like,
did you just want to use that word?

678
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:34,880
You dumb fuck. And then they come
in and they're like, oh, it's pizza.

679
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:39,570
It's pizza. Oh my God. Again, I believe
that I eat dead. She and every week,

680
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:44,400
you know, always tasted like shit, but now
these fucking cloth napkins. Oh my God,

681
00:44:44,401 --> 00:44:49,200
he's so fucking jaggedy. And they're
breeding and they're breathing.

682
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:54,000
They're not using condoms and
they're eating pasta. I mean, how,

683
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:56,490
you know, the, and I like how, um,

684
00:44:57,340 --> 00:45:00,600
all these other fucking fast food
places are acting like they into,

685
00:45:00,601 --> 00:45:04,680
they invented these mini burgers.
You know what I mean?

686
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:07,260
Like white castle doesn't exist.

687
00:45:07,261 --> 00:45:12,261
I'm really waiting for white castle to
sue a jack in the box or write any one of

688
00:45:13,291 --> 00:45:16,500
these other places. These, these guys
who come up and they call him sliders.

689
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:18,700
And evidently it's,

690
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:22,560
it's not as fattening because
rather than eating one burger,

691
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:25,830
they take a burger and they
cut it into three little ones.

692
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,140
But because of their little,

693
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,890
even though you're eating the exact
same amount of fucking Burger, you know,

694
00:45:31,891 --> 00:45:36,730
somehow it's, it's, it's less
fattening. I Dunno. Yeah. I mean,

695
00:45:36,731 --> 00:45:39,880
it's so much what I just said is, you
know, obviously just not even research,

696
00:45:39,881 --> 00:45:42,550
but you know, I, I, you
know, I just eat, I,

697
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:45,970
that fucking lady using the word
decadent just really annoys me.

698
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:47,410
You know what annoys me even more?

699
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:50,890
I can't even give you a fuck a definition
for it. What does it, extravagant.

700
00:45:51,610 --> 00:45:55,720
Is that what it means or is that Latin
for, oh my God, I can't believe this.

701
00:45:55,721 --> 00:45:58,750
Shitty pasta tastes much better
with cloth. Napkin says that.

702
00:45:58,751 --> 00:46:01,300
What the fuck it means? You know what?
I'm going to look it up right now.

703
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:04,090
I'm looking up right now because I'm gonna
set you guys up with what this, this,

704
00:46:04,091 --> 00:46:06,310
this week is going to be all about.
This is going to be,

705
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:11,290
there's a lot of information,
not information this week. Um,

706
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,830
that's going to become an a,
how the fuck you spelled decadent.

707
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:17,860
D. E. C. Deca a, another.

708
00:46:17,861 --> 00:46:21,430
A deca. No. D C. A dent.

709
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:23,080
Deka Dent.

710
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,960
Oh, Jesus Christ. I
wasn't even close. Was it

711
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:32,540
d e c? A. D. E. N. T. Wow.

712
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:37,100
Fuck. I got it. Holy Shit. All right.
Decadence. Let's go to Wikipedia.

713
00:46:37,101 --> 00:46:41,220
God knows they're fucking
credible. Um, decadence. Kimra.

714
00:46:41,221 --> 00:46:46,221
For to a personal trait or to the
state of society or a segment of it.

715
00:46:48,410 --> 00:46:50,720
Use to describe a person's lifestyle.

716
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:52,833
MMM.

717
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:58,530
It describes the fuck happened.
Just it a goddamn computer.

718
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,510
Users grab a person's lifestyle.

719
00:47:00,511 --> 00:47:05,100
It describes a lack of moral and
intellectual discipline. Well,

720
00:47:05,101 --> 00:47:09,800
there's a fucking left turn. Oh, no
way. Yeah. Wait a second now. That's,

721
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:13,190
I guess gotta be right. Nice. Am I going
to question these people? I'm a moron.

722
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:17,200
Bill. Why don't you just read it and shut
the fuck up. Alright, I will. All right.

723
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,190
Used to describe a person's lifestyle.

724
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:24,220
It describes a lack of moral and
intellectual discipline or in the Oxford

725
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:28,410
Dictionary,
a luxurious self indulgence.

726
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:30,400
Okay.

727
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:34,190
You, you know who the fuck describes
pasta is a luxurious self indulgent,

728
00:47:34,191 --> 00:47:35,030
you know some,

729
00:47:35,031 --> 00:47:38,840
you know who does some stupid white
trash conduits fuckin macaroni and cheese

730
00:47:38,841 --> 00:47:42,700
six days a week and all of a sudden you
bring her a little fucking CD and he,

731
00:47:42,701 --> 00:47:45,840
you know, she can't, she can't
believe it. Oh my God, it's the deck.

732
00:47:45,850 --> 00:47:49,130
And she was actually,
that was an insecure comment.

733
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:52,880
They probably had an extra couple of
forks there and she started to panic.

734
00:47:53,390 --> 00:47:54,223
You know what I mean?

735
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:59,630
Just like Jodie foster when she's talking
to that dude and silence of the lambs

736
00:47:59,631 --> 00:48:04,130
and he can tell us that she, she grew up
dirt poor because of her shoes. Right.

737
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:09,770
You know, that's all the end of that
commercial needed was somebody saying,

738
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:13,720
I can smell your cunt. That would have
been, that would have been all right.

739
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:16,520
You know, I'm really being
crude right now and I apologize,

740
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:19,580
especially after last week,
that video they told all you guys to see.

741
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:20,121
I got a lot of,

742
00:48:20,121 --> 00:48:25,121
I've got a lot of feedback about that
one about what a ignorant moron I am and

743
00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:28,130
I'll be reading those a little bit later.
Look at me foreshadowing here.

744
00:48:28,131 --> 00:48:32,780
He liked that. Like I'm on a God
damn radio station. Um, all right,

745
00:48:32,781 --> 00:48:35,990
let's get to some mom.
If you're new to this podcast,

746
00:48:35,991 --> 00:48:38,660
I do one of these every week and this
is basically what it is. All right.

747
00:48:38,661 --> 00:48:42,110
If you think it's going to get better,
like I'm building to something, I'm not,

748
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:42,861
this is pretty much,

749
00:48:42,861 --> 00:48:47,060
I'm going to flat line the whole week
and I feel like I have internal hiccups

750
00:48:47,061 --> 00:48:50,360
right now. You know those hiccups where
you start to hiccup but then you don't?

751
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:53,060
Huh?
Am I doing an eighties bit again?

752
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,760
What's the deal with internal here goes,

753
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:57,940
um,
great.

754
00:48:58,130 --> 00:49:00,700
It's like a fork.
Doesn't know where to go.

755
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:05,430
Oh God, I'd love to fucking do standup
in the 80s. It was so much easier,

756
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:08,230
wasn't it?
One week you're an accountant,

757
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:13,020
the next minute you're on comic strip
live wearing the same blazer that you wore

758
00:49:13,021 --> 00:49:14,610
when you were doing somebody's taxes,

759
00:49:14,970 --> 00:49:19,970
except you just fucking pull the sleeves
up and everything was funny back then.

760
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:25,890
All right. Uh, let's get onto some shit
here. Uh, Bill, just for your information,

761
00:49:25,891 --> 00:49:28,620
the guy, the wrap you were
trying to talk about last neat,

762
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:32,730
nice week is it's pronounced,
I still can't say it's Quali.

763
00:49:32,790 --> 00:49:35,640
I never heard anybody say it to Lib.

764
00:49:35,641 --> 00:49:40,641
Quali coyly and I'm fucking
notice name is quietly,

765
00:49:40,801 --> 00:49:42,720
I mean I listen to someone's rap,
you know, I like about the guy,

766
00:49:42,721 --> 00:49:46,260
he doesn't say his fucking name every
three seconds and the one time when I need

767
00:49:46,261 --> 00:49:49,380
somebody to do it, he doesn't do it.
And I still don't know how to say it.

768
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:52,720
Sky Spelled the qua. How'd
he say? Is that choir?

769
00:49:54,050 --> 00:49:55,350
Quasi right.

770
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:59,300
That's how you said so
quiet quietly to Lib.

771
00:49:59,301 --> 00:50:03,990
Quali ah, this is fucking pathetic one.
Want to do alright. You know. Alright,

772
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:08,700
plowing ahead here. Um, here's one that
somebody actually was going to have, uh,

773
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:12,760
for another segment, but this
seemed more like a ask bill. Uh,

774
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:16,650
here's two things I'd love to hear
your opinion on drugs and double dates.

775
00:50:17,850 --> 00:50:21,330
Um, yes, this guy wants to
hear my opinions on double
dates in this. Actually,

776
00:50:21,331 --> 00:50:24,660
I think this is more of an ask
bill kind of question. So he says,

777
00:50:24,661 --> 00:50:28,880
long story short, I met the
hottest chick ever at a club. Dude.

778
00:50:28,881 --> 00:50:32,780
I met Ohad is fucking chick
ever and names fucking Stacy.

779
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:36,570
Um, I get a number one.
Read this all like,

780
00:50:36,571 --> 00:50:41,510
come a fucking knasis's back in the day
and Kenmore square doors go down and

781
00:50:41,511 --> 00:50:45,350
fucking nasty. This is with our
fucking z cavalry. Ricci's dude,

782
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:49,010
fucking go down there,
get a couple of rule fees.

783
00:50:49,011 --> 00:50:51,320
Drop him in a fucking Zima dude.

784
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:56,150
Fucking cock sucker. All
right, long story short,

785
00:50:56,151 --> 00:51:00,920
me and the hottest chick ever ran a
club. I get her number, we talk, we,

786
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:04,370
I ask her out, she changes it.
Okay. Ask her out. And then,

787
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,310
then she changes it to a
double date with her sister.

788
00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:12,050
So I go out on this double day to
an extremely expensive restaurant.

789
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:14,720
I'm 22 in college broke.

790
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:19,090
I drop $140 on her. Uh, the,

791
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:24,440
the sister wouldn't let me out of her
sight and all I got was one small kiss

792
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:30,230
later on. I did not even get a kiss good
night because the sister was watching.

793
00:51:31,350 --> 00:51:32,270
All right,
dude.

794
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:36,950
Now you really shouldn't be asking
my opinion on double dating.

795
00:51:36,951 --> 00:51:41,720
What this is really about is
how did you as a young man,

796
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:46,220
22, I'm going to cut you some slack
here. End Up in that situation. Okay?

797
00:51:46,430 --> 00:51:49,400
Don't walk away from this. Just go in
like, you know what you wanted to do.

798
00:51:49,401 --> 00:51:53,780
Overrated. Underrated, overrated. Fucking,
you know, double date and it's sucks.

799
00:51:54,050 --> 00:51:56,120
Now you should have right there,
dude.

800
00:51:56,121 --> 00:51:59,450
You went when she tried to turn
it into a double date right there.

801
00:51:59,451 --> 00:52:03,920
You just have to be, Nah, I don't
want to do that. And she'll be like,

802
00:52:03,921 --> 00:52:05,620
why don't you want to do that?
And you just feel,

803
00:52:05,630 --> 00:52:08,690
I don't like going on double dates.
Why not?

804
00:52:09,110 --> 00:52:12,230
Because one person ends
up not having a good time,

805
00:52:13,370 --> 00:52:16,760
and it's usually the other con that
you bring. You can clean this up, this

806
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:23,210
no. You know what I mean? You
get your ski. Just just say
it. I swear to God that's,

807
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:27,110
you know when you're 22 you
don't realize the power of no.

808
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:28,371
All right.

809
00:52:28,371 --> 00:52:33,170
It actually seems like maybe you have
some shit going on because at 22 most guys

810
00:52:33,171 --> 00:52:36,500
don't know how to talk to women.
So all women here is yes, yes, yes.

811
00:52:36,501 --> 00:52:40,730
Especially if they're hot.
They just keep fucking agreeing with them.

812
00:52:40,731 --> 00:52:44,570
So if you say no, all of a sudden it's,
it's, it's kind of different. I mean,

813
00:52:44,571 --> 00:52:46,640
you could fuck it up, but
at the end of the day, dude,

814
00:52:46,641 --> 00:52:50,300
you didn't get laid and you're
out of 150 bucks. All right?

815
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:53,270
Think about that moment when she said,
let's turn.

816
00:52:53,310 --> 00:52:58,220
You were going to turn this into a double
date. What did your internal voice say?

817
00:52:58,730 --> 00:53:01,880
Oh Great. Or did it say, fuck,

818
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:05,330
this is going to suck.
This is going to suck.

819
00:53:05,331 --> 00:53:08,690
I'm not going to be able to get along
with this girl. Uh, you know Joe Pesci,

820
00:53:08,691 --> 00:53:10,700
I'm trying to fucking
bang this broad over here.

821
00:53:11,390 --> 00:53:15,030
You know it's not going to go good.
So right there you just got to watch.

822
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:17,720
You just got to say no. I don't want to
do a double date. And she'll say why?

823
00:53:17,721 --> 00:53:22,490
And just say, cause I'm 22.
What am I potsy we unhappy days.

824
00:53:22,491 --> 00:53:25,710
We going to go to inspiration point.
You want to go out on a date with me?

825
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:26,693
I don't Ya.

826
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:30,150
At that point you bring a little anger
into it and he kind of just show the side

827
00:53:30,151 --> 00:53:32,610
of your head and you don't really
look at her. That'll get you.

828
00:53:32,850 --> 00:53:36,060
That'll get you a second tape. All
right. That was fucking brutal.

829
00:53:36,061 --> 00:53:38,430
It was bad advice. I'm
trying to tell you, dude,

830
00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:43,470
just don't fucking go on a double
date. All right. They suck.

831
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:45,390
You knew they suck.
You knew before you even went on it,

832
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:48,720
you knew what was going to suck.
And if you're broke,

833
00:53:48,721 --> 00:53:53,430
don't take a girl someplace where
you got to drop 140 bucks. You know,

834
00:53:53,550 --> 00:53:58,080
what did she do to deserve $140 meal?
What?

835
00:53:58,081 --> 00:54:02,490
Cause she's hot like that some sort of
accomplishment. She was born that way.

836
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:08,190
You know what you did is you basically
took probably a nice girl and you just

837
00:54:08,191 --> 00:54:13,191
added another layer to the foundation
of her just being an incredibly stuck up

838
00:54:13,681 --> 00:54:18,210
human being who doesn't have, who doesn't
have to develop a personality. You know,

839
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:20,550
look at me making all these judgments.
But I think it's true.

840
00:54:21,150 --> 00:54:25,500
Just because you're hot doesn't
mean you deserve $140 meal.

841
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:29,370
If you're broke,
dude,

842
00:54:29,371 --> 00:54:33,090
be honest with yourself with that
chick was like a seven. You know,

843
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:36,090
you'd probably take it a pizza hut
for some fucking decadent pasta.

844
00:54:36,870 --> 00:54:39,030
So I don't know.
Did I help you there?

845
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:42,840
I got to stop doing these podcasts on
Sunday cause I'm fucking jet lag from

846
00:54:42,841 --> 00:54:44,610
flying back to wherever
the fuck I came from.

847
00:54:44,611 --> 00:54:47,700
I was actually working in Denver this
weekend. I was at the comedy works.

848
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:52,020
So I should take some time here to uh,
uh,

849
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:54,450
thank everyone who came out to see me.

850
00:54:54,450 --> 00:54:58,710
The turnout in Denver was ridiculous
and I actually flew in a day early and I

851
00:54:58,711 --> 00:55:02,130
got to do five minutes out at red rocks.

852
00:55:03,270 --> 00:55:04,270
And um,

853
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:09,480
if you're not from Denver and you're not
a fan of you to just go on youtube and

854
00:55:09,481 --> 00:55:10,990
just Google red rocks,
it's fucking,

855
00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:16,020
it's one of the most amazing venues is
basically an outdoor venue built into the

856
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:19,650
side of a mountain and that youtube
video. Speaking of that. Yeah,

857
00:55:19,651 --> 00:55:21,210
that's why I was trying
to say that youtube video,

858
00:55:21,211 --> 00:55:25,500
I don't know what the fuck was called.
Unforgettable fire. I don't know.

859
00:55:25,501 --> 00:55:28,290
What was it about? What was it about?
What, what is you to sing about?

860
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:32,130
They sing about breaking up with girls.
Martin Luther King,

861
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:37,860
and then they went through
their irony stage, didn't they?

862
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:38,611
Where are you?

863
00:55:38,611 --> 00:55:43,380
Where the big glasses and he just ain't
just acted like everything was fucking

864
00:55:43,381 --> 00:55:44,540
surreal. I don't know. Whatever it is.

865
00:55:44,541 --> 00:55:47,530
There's a video that they did way back
in the day and he marches around like a f

866
00:55:47,630 --> 00:55:51,660
with a, with a fucking flag.
Like he's in a, I don't know,

867
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:56,410
like they're doing something. He playing
like this military be get dead, dead,

868
00:55:56,470 --> 00:55:59,910
dead, dead, dead, dead, dead,
dead, dead. And he comes my,

869
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:04,050
I say an old fucking David spade
bit. He starts chatting. No War.

870
00:56:04,470 --> 00:56:08,610
There you go. It's that video.
Yeah. No, but we got it.

871
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,680
It's not like they're a
small fucking indie band.

872
00:56:10,681 --> 00:56:14,460
We knew 10 minutes ago when you started
describing it. All right. All right.

873
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:17,460
Sometimes they get a
little carried away. I, uh,

874
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:21,600
just reminds me of something.
Can I have a falling out with somebody?

875
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:24,100
Like two months ago, you ever
have somebody, a friend of yours,

876
00:56:24,101 --> 00:56:29,101
just say something so fucking stupid that
you don't want me to get angry and you

877
00:56:29,141 --> 00:56:30,880
just, you just have that moment like, wow,

878
00:56:30,910 --> 00:56:34,480
I can't be friends with this person
anymore because they were fucking moron.

879
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:40,160
No, you don't. What happens? Somebody,

880
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:43,820
somebody does happen to me twice.

881
00:56:44,810 --> 00:56:49,760
One time somebody said, uh, they were
talking about secretary at that horse

882
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:54,830
and they were talking about all the
whole, all the racist, the horse one in,

883
00:56:54,831 --> 00:56:58,700
in the end they went,
what? An athlete. And uh,

884
00:57:00,530 --> 00:57:03,230
I don't know if that was it. I just
could never look at them the same way.

885
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:08,740
What an athlete. You know, I, I don't,

886
00:57:08,741 --> 00:57:11,730
I just do. I have, you need to fucking
go off on that. Do I need to explore?

887
00:57:11,731 --> 00:57:14,390
Can you tell him actually scrolling down,
I'm trying to find something else.

888
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:19,670
Somebody wrote a fucking question about
that. This whole fucking podcasts,

889
00:57:19,671 --> 00:57:21,830
it's just falling apart. This
is what you get. You know what?

890
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:23,480
Maybe if I started
charging for these things,

891
00:57:23,481 --> 00:57:26,840
I take them a little more seriously
and we wouldn't have these long lulls.

892
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:31,900
My dog's fast asleep from
my monotone voice is no,

893
00:57:32,590 --> 00:57:35,900
there's no passion in this.
What am I doing here with the fuck is it?

894
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:42,440
Oh, you know what? Fuck this podcast. Am
I going to start over? I'm going to start,

895
00:57:42,450 --> 00:57:44,940
you know, I want to plow through. I
can't, I can't start off with this is it.

896
00:57:44,970 --> 00:57:47,100
I got one take.
This is like live television here.

897
00:57:47,370 --> 00:57:50,710
I'm just going to read everything in front
of me. How about that? All right. Uh,

898
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:55,010
Bill's listen to your podcast
on July 20th you said, uh, the,

899
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:57,750
that the youtube video.
Tough talk in college.

900
00:57:57,751 --> 00:58:01,050
Girl was a must see a search forward. Oh
yeah. That people kind of took it down.

901
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:06,300
People took that one down.
Um, and if you didn't see it,

902
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:09,870
that people keep putting it back up.
So just check every couple of days.

903
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:13,020
Just look up search, tough
talk and college girl, t,

904
00:58:13,021 --> 00:58:17,280
U F F and it's talking with the GE
even though I don't pronounce my gs.

905
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:20,220
Um, anyways, uh, here's one for ups.

906
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:23,910
My girlfriend and I were at the grocery
store last night and all that they had

907
00:58:23,911 --> 00:58:25,440
opened where those self checkouts,

908
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:28,800
this is the first time I was putting that
situation because they usually always

909
00:58:28,801 --> 00:58:31,500
have at least one real lane open.
Anyways,

910
00:58:31,501 --> 00:58:35,220
the place was fucking swamped and going
to a real person to pay for the shit

911
00:58:35,221 --> 00:58:38,940
wasn't even an option. Uh, there
were three fucking employees.

912
00:58:39,330 --> 00:58:42,720
It was just three fucking
employees as standing there.

913
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:45,300
I went up to the three fucks
and I asked him if, uh,

914
00:58:45,301 --> 00:58:48,540
if they would open a real lane and they
just told me that they were too short

915
00:58:48,541 --> 00:58:53,430
staffed, um, fucking
horse shit. This guy says,

916
00:58:53,431 --> 00:58:58,380
he said, I thought to myself, uh, where
is bill burr when you need them both do,

917
00:58:58,381 --> 00:59:01,740
what would I do other than just sit there
and curse under my breath neck next to

918
00:59:01,741 --> 00:59:06,710
some fucking candy like you did fucking
bullshit. That's fucking bullshit.

919
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:10,630
Um, so I got in line and I rang up
my own shit, like a little pitch. Uh,

920
00:59:10,650 --> 00:59:14,280
I had no other option.
What would you done in that situation?

921
00:59:14,970 --> 00:59:16,530
I would have done exactly what you did.

922
00:59:17,370 --> 00:59:19,860
I would have been hostile
towards the three people there.

923
00:59:19,861 --> 00:59:24,140
I would have cursed under my breath and
then I probably just would've fucking,

924
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:26,810
you know,
depending on how much I needed to shit,

925
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:29,140
if I really didn't need this stuff,
what I,

926
00:59:29,141 --> 00:59:33,320
what I would've done a what I would like
to, you know what I'm doing right now?

927
00:59:33,321 --> 00:59:34,430
I'm doing that shit.
You know,

928
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:37,610
we're after something goes down
and the guy tells you the story,

929
00:59:37,611 --> 00:59:40,520
then there's always that Douche bag. He
goes, dude, you know what I would've done?

930
00:59:41,330 --> 00:59:45,800
You know what I would've done? Now that
I have all the fucking information. Um,

931
00:59:45,830 --> 00:59:47,960
you know what you could do in
the future is just say, oh,

932
00:59:47,961 --> 00:59:50,720
well then we are going to come back during
the day when you have some people and

933
00:59:50,721 --> 00:59:54,470
then just leave your food
there and let them put it back.

934
00:59:55,370 --> 00:59:59,300
You know, dude, I told you this was going
to fucking happen. They're understaffed.

935
00:59:59,330 --> 01:00:03,290
They're understaffed on purpose.
That's phase two.

936
01:00:03,770 --> 01:00:08,060
Phase one was just to have like five or
six fucking registers and give you three

937
01:00:08,061 --> 01:00:13,040
others. So all the fucking sheep look over
the curiosity factor, what's going on.

938
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:16,280
And then you had the other cashiers over
there teaching them how to fucking use

939
01:00:16,281 --> 01:00:20,330
it. Now they've gotten beyond that.
Now they're going into phase two.

940
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:25,490
Okay? Phase two of the experiment.
What happens if there's no,

941
01:00:26,210 --> 01:00:30,530
if there are no cashier people,
how will the herd handle this?

942
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:33,680
When should we do it? Well,
we can't do it during the day.

943
01:00:33,681 --> 01:00:36,530
This fucking old people and their
little motorcars riding around.

944
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:40,760
Let's do it later on at night.
Let's see how the drunk crowd handles it.

945
01:00:40,910 --> 01:00:43,700
Even if they don't like it, they won't
fucking remember. At the very least.

946
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:46,490
They won't send any angry letters.
I'm telling you,

947
01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:48,530
this is how the whole
fucking thing is going to go.

948
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:52,250
And somebody actually asked me in this,
uh,

949
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:56,650
this week asked me, they were curious
as to what I thought about ATS.

950
01:00:57,110 --> 01:00:58,790
Um,
yeah,

951
01:00:58,791 --> 01:01:03,791
I'm not against technology is
if it makes my life like easier,

952
01:01:05,270 --> 01:01:08,840
like ATM at banks before,
I don't know if you guys remember this,

953
01:01:08,841 --> 01:01:13,220
shipped it back in the day when there was
no a tms, you know, Friday, five o'clock.

954
01:01:13,221 --> 01:01:16,280
If you didn't grab the cash you needed
for the weekend, you were fucked.

955
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:18,560
You couldn't get to you.
My IC,

956
01:01:18,561 --> 01:01:22,580
they will be open for like 20
minutes on a Saturday. But uh, yeah,

957
01:01:22,581 --> 01:01:25,880
that was just be that, that their
expression, the guys work in banker hours.

958
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:27,530
He used to be open like nine to five.

959
01:01:27,531 --> 01:01:29,090
You can never even get
your fucking money out.

960
01:01:29,330 --> 01:01:32,540
So what I like about the ATM as at
least I have access to my money.

961
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:37,040
I don't mind that. And a lot of times
it is easier to just throw it in there.

962
01:01:37,041 --> 01:01:39,140
So I don't give a fuck,
you know,

963
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:43,760
that one doesn't bug me and I understand
the technology does replace some jobs.

964
01:01:43,761 --> 01:01:48,761
The reason why I can't stand this latest
brand of automated shit is it's not an

965
01:01:49,371 --> 01:01:52,130
advancement.
It doesn't make it easier.

966
01:01:52,131 --> 01:01:56,420
I just go up and do exactly what the
cashier did and the bag person did,

967
01:01:56,570 --> 01:02:01,310
except I'm doing it for free. Now. If
I walked up to the cashier machine,

968
01:02:01,311 --> 01:02:06,311
the automated thing and magically the
fucking thing figured out what I owed and

969
01:02:07,171 --> 01:02:11,630
then suddenly it was all in a bag,
I wouldn't give a shit. All right.

970
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:14,810
I Dunno.
People just hear what they want to hear.

971
01:02:14,811 --> 01:02:18,060
Like you make one comment about something.
It's God who like technology,

972
01:02:18,070 --> 01:02:22,170
he's against penicillin. No I'm not.
I'm not at vent gets advancement.

973
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:27,380
I'm against fuck overs and those automated
things in the grocery store and at

974
01:02:27,901 --> 01:02:31,650
the, at the parking garage, the
automated park or fuck overs.

975
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:32,590
Yeah.

976
01:02:32,590 --> 01:02:36,520
It doesn't make it quicker. It actually
makes it longer and a lot of instances.

977
01:02:36,970 --> 01:02:40,570
And, uh, I'm just working for free.

978
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:44,320
I'm working for free and I
don't fucking like it. Okay.

979
01:02:44,321 --> 01:02:47,440
And that's the last time I'm fucking
explaining it and I don't need any,

980
01:02:47,441 --> 01:02:51,100
you douchebags glue. They, we ain't got
money origins. Dod Janie Wedge Quicker.

981
01:02:51,101 --> 01:02:54,490
You're a moron. Just fucking work
for free. All right, here we go.

982
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:59,340
Um, what are we going on to a, somebody
sent me an email, said, hey bill,

983
01:02:59,341 --> 01:03:03,850
I just want to thank you. Thanks a
bunch for teaching me about tinnitus.

984
01:03:04,130 --> 01:03:07,210
That ringing in the ear stuff I was
talking about. I just turned 21.

985
01:03:07,211 --> 01:03:11,530
I had that shit as long as I can remember.
Didn't know what it was a thought.

986
01:03:11,531 --> 01:03:13,610
It was just me,
um,

987
01:03:13,660 --> 01:03:17,440
for anyone that has the problem and
not sure what to do when I was younger,

988
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:22,190
I used, uh, I left the TV on, that was
a bad idea. After that I played, uh,

989
01:03:22,270 --> 01:03:24,530
mostly chill music,
um,

990
01:03:24,950 --> 01:03:28,400
and my music collection and a 70
minute album or something like that.

991
01:03:28,401 --> 01:03:32,440
And now I just sorta put a fan on low
speed and it keeps the ringing away.

992
01:03:32,441 --> 01:03:35,200
For those of you who don't have
tonight is what he's saying is,

993
01:03:35,650 --> 01:03:37,380
is you put some sort of smaller,

994
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:42,480
quieter noise in the background that
drowns out the ringing in your ear and uh,

995
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:46,540
actually do what you really should do is
go see a doctor is what you're supposed

996
01:03:46,541 --> 01:03:48,740
to do.
And um,

997
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:49,960
okay.
Okay.

998
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:51,520
I Dunno. Um, that's,

999
01:03:51,550 --> 01:03:56,230
I think the case is of Tinnitus is
going to go way up just because of like

1000
01:03:56,231 --> 01:04:01,180
iPods. And when you go to clubs, how
loud they play that fucking music. Um,

1001
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:03,710
actually,
you know,

1002
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:07,370
I actually bring ear plugs everywhere I
go because I have such fucked up ears,

1003
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:08,720
at least I try to remember.

1004
01:04:08,721 --> 01:04:13,721
But basically how it works is anything
up to about 60 or 65 decibels,

1005
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:17,270
you're pretty much cool.
And you can listen.

1006
01:04:17,570 --> 01:04:21,410
Your ear can handle like are right
around 60 decibels that say, ah,

1007
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:23,750
that's like how I'm talking right now.

1008
01:04:23,751 --> 01:04:28,010
Regular conversation and you
don't do any damage to your ears.

1009
01:04:28,011 --> 01:04:31,640
Your ears can listen to it for, you know,
all day and you don't do any damage.

1010
01:04:31,641 --> 01:04:33,740
But what happens,
I forget how the math works,

1011
01:04:33,741 --> 01:04:36,290
but every time you move up 10 decibels,

1012
01:04:36,860 --> 01:04:41,860
like 60 to 70 the timeframe that your
ears can listen to that level of noise

1013
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:47,240
without doing permanent damage
goes down really quickly.

1014
01:04:47,241 --> 01:04:50,720
And I know some worry where when you start
getting around 80 that starts getting

1015
01:04:50,721 --> 01:04:53,620
dangerous and anything above 90 um,

1016
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:58,130
I mean I think like 90 listening
to something at 90 minutes.

1017
01:04:58,131 --> 01:04:59,970
Don't quote me on this. I forget. I used,

1018
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:02,570
I used to have this chart and only
shit I tried to find on the Internet,

1019
01:05:02,571 --> 01:05:05,060
but I couldn't.
But anything around 90 decibels.

1020
01:05:06,190 --> 01:05:06,510
Yeah,

1021
01:05:06,510 --> 01:05:08,340
after like 15 minutes.

1022
01:05:09,090 --> 01:05:13,920
And you can easily with an iPod go up to
about a buck 10 15 minutes of listening

1023
01:05:13,921 --> 01:05:16,920
to music.
You do permanent damage to your hearing.

1024
01:05:17,140 --> 01:05:21,700
And I know that sounds fucked up. It's
just incremental. And you can't tell,

1025
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:24,130
I forget,
I read all this shit.

1026
01:05:24,131 --> 01:05:27,070
There's little hairs in there and when
you blow it out yet the things get

1027
01:05:27,071 --> 01:05:31,000
knocked down and then they slowly stand
back up again and after a while they

1028
01:05:31,001 --> 01:05:34,100
just don't get back up again.
You just fucking like a boxer.

1029
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:37,150
They just lay in there and you go
into clubs, man. And they have,

1030
01:05:37,151 --> 01:05:40,540
they have those that fucking music
up to like a buck 15, a buck 20.

1031
01:05:40,660 --> 01:05:44,200
If he noticed the bouncers who worked
there always heavier plugs for the most

1032
01:05:44,201 --> 01:05:48,640
part. Um, I dunno, I suffer from
tinnitus. You don't want it.

1033
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:53,380
It's horrific. But um, if you have it,
you should definitely go see a doctor.

1034
01:05:53,381 --> 01:05:58,381
And I would always have earplugs
on you just in case you know,

1035
01:05:58,751 --> 01:06:00,340
you're hanging out,
hey, check out this bar.

1036
01:06:00,341 --> 01:06:04,060
And you'd go in there and I don't know
why they play the music that fucking loud.

1037
01:06:05,140 --> 01:06:07,860
I can tell if the, I guess if there's
a Dj and there's dance of what I said,

1038
01:06:07,861 --> 01:06:10,720
when you just walk into a bar and you
haven't a couple of beers and he got to

1039
01:06:10,721 --> 01:06:13,990
scream, I can't fucking stand that.
I don't know. Maybe because I'm,

1040
01:06:14,050 --> 01:06:17,890
maybe because I'm old. Who knows? All
right, let's move on to the next section.

1041
01:06:17,891 --> 01:06:20,680
You know, I'm just, I'm just
reading shit this week. All right.

1042
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:22,960
I don't know why I forget what this is,

1043
01:06:22,961 --> 01:06:27,520
but this section is named the
accidental racist. All right.

1044
01:06:27,580 --> 01:06:29,260
Uh, Hey, bill,

1045
01:06:29,261 --> 01:06:34,261
I just downloaded a bunch
of your uninformed shows
on mini mini Nova and just

1046
01:06:34,811 --> 01:06:39,220
began listening to the first one,
a show from February 10th,

1047
01:06:39,220 --> 01:06:44,200
2007 I stopped at three minutes in to
write you to thank you for delivering

1048
01:06:44,201 --> 01:06:48,850
already the accidental racism to the
Asian guy. Oh, that's why this name,

1049
01:06:48,851 --> 01:06:51,580
this I'm in the elevator story.

1050
01:06:52,590 --> 01:06:55,420
It kind of reminded me of
a sending [inaudible] funny
thing that happened to me.

1051
01:06:55,421 --> 01:06:56,860
All right.
Just to get you guys caught up,

1052
01:06:57,190 --> 01:06:59,620
I was going up with them in
the elevator at the old, uh,

1053
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:04,210
XM building evidently on February 10th,

1054
01:07:04,210 --> 01:07:07,150
2007 and it was me and Joe
de Rosa who do the show.

1055
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:11,530
And there was this Asian guy in the
elevator and I can't remember what,

1056
01:07:11,531 --> 01:07:16,230
but he seemed confused and uh, he was, I,

1057
01:07:16,250 --> 01:07:18,760
I sometimes,
I didn't know what floor he was on.

1058
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:23,880
Somehow I made the assumption that he was
delivering food and I conveyed that to

1059
01:07:25,811 --> 01:07:30,040
him and I was, yeah. Said something
like, Oh, what are you delivering food?

1060
01:07:30,070 --> 01:07:33,040
And he just put his head down and he goes,
I work here.

1061
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:40,510
And I felt like such a fucking asshole.

1062
01:07:40,630 --> 01:07:42,640
But he just looked,

1063
01:07:42,641 --> 01:07:46,480
he looked disheveled and he was dressed
down and we did the show on a Saturday,

1064
01:07:46,481 --> 01:07:50,170
so he wasn't dressed like he was going
to work. It was just one of those things.

1065
01:07:50,770 --> 01:07:55,480
Uh, if I could find the guy,
I would apologize to them.
But you know what I mean?

1066
01:07:56,440 --> 01:08:00,700
There are a lot of Asian
guys delivering food in, uh,

1067
01:08:01,090 --> 01:08:05,020
in New York, you know, so,

1068
01:08:05,260 --> 01:08:08,050
and they're always going up elevators
and they always have that look of like,

1069
01:08:08,051 --> 01:08:11,110
what fucking floor am I going to?
I don't know the guy, I don't know.

1070
01:08:11,140 --> 01:08:14,290
I don't what happened when we got an arc
with his girlfriend. It's how I read it.

1071
01:08:14,291 --> 01:08:18,590
So anyways, I felt like an
asshole and I apologize. Uh,

1072
01:08:19,420 --> 01:08:19,670
you know,

1073
01:08:19,670 --> 01:08:22,460
for some reason he's listening to this
podcast and be funny if he actually was a

1074
01:08:22,461 --> 01:08:27,050
listener of my podcast and didn't realize
that was me and now realizes it's me

1075
01:08:27,051 --> 01:08:31,060
and now I've lost another listener.
Um, anyway, so this guy gets,

1076
01:08:31,070 --> 01:08:34,130
has a story just like it. Um,
so when he says anyways, um,

1077
01:08:34,670 --> 01:08:37,700
my junior year in college I was looking
for a roommate because some previous

1078
01:08:37,701 --> 01:08:40,130
people I had lined up dropped
out on me in the last minute.

1079
01:08:40,630 --> 01:08:44,000
A girl I was friends with put me in
touch with the guy she was friends with

1080
01:08:44,001 --> 01:08:45,950
because, uh, he was
looking for a place to,

1081
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:49,610
despite both of us having this girl's a
mutual friend, we never met each other.

1082
01:08:50,180 --> 01:08:53,810
Uh, we set everything up over the phone
and came to terms we could both live with

1083
01:08:53,811 --> 01:08:57,020
without ever even meeting in person.
Um,

1084
01:08:57,050 --> 01:09:01,280
thus the first time we would meet was
at the place we would both be living in

1085
01:09:01,580 --> 01:09:04,730
Jesus. Dude, you're really
taking a risk there. Um,

1086
01:09:04,731 --> 01:09:08,030
there are some things about me that are
vital pieces of information in order for

1087
01:09:08,031 --> 01:09:10,880
this story to make sense. First
of all, I'm black. However,

1088
01:09:10,881 --> 01:09:14,780
due to the tone and the pitch of my voice,
my usage of correct grammar,

1089
01:09:14,781 --> 01:09:18,740
most of the time, um, you know, do it. If
I said that I would really be in trouble.

1090
01:09:18,741 --> 01:09:22,310
But you can trash your own people.
Okay. So everything's good. Um,

1091
01:09:22,311 --> 01:09:25,310
he said I was an English major, but
I'm not an asshole about it, I promise.

1092
01:09:25,550 --> 01:09:26,240
Correct Grammar,

1093
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:31,070
use correct grammar most of the time and
the semi racist nature of most people.

1094
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:36,110
Uh, many people have told me that I sound
white or could be mistaken for a white

1095
01:09:36,111 --> 01:09:39,980
person over the phone. I'm going to
address that point a little bit later.

1096
01:09:39,981 --> 01:09:43,550
All right, so getting back to the story.
When I talked to this kid over the phone,

1097
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:47,690
we found out, uh, we had both gone to
the same high school for a year. Again,

1098
01:09:47,691 --> 01:09:50,750
despite that this, we
didn't know each other. Um,

1099
01:09:50,751 --> 01:09:53,950
the fact that this school was
mostly white combined with the,

1100
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:58,310
the sounds of his voice,
I thought he was white in my mind.

1101
01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:01,490
Um,
which set up this awesome situation.

1102
01:10:01,700 --> 01:10:06,080
I figured he was guessing I was white for
the same reason I was guessing. He was,

1103
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:09,620
I was really looking forward to seeing
this white kid squirm when he pulled up

1104
01:10:09,621 --> 01:10:11,780
and realize that was black.
Of course,

1105
01:10:11,781 --> 01:10:16,300
a black kid pulled up to the house
looking for me and it was uh,

1106
01:10:16,340 --> 01:10:17,600
my prospective roommate.

1107
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:21,320
I remember seeing a little bit of surprise
look on his face and I said to him,

1108
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:25,520
he thought I was white, didn't you? And
then of course my computer craps out. Uh,

1109
01:10:25,521 --> 01:10:30,230
he smiled and admitted he did. Uh, I told
him that I thought he was white as well.

1110
01:10:30,231 --> 01:10:34,160
We both ended up having a great laugh
about it and became pretty good friends

1111
01:10:34,161 --> 01:10:39,080
afterwards. Um, anyways, thanks for
the podcast. Okay, let me, let me,

1112
01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:43,850
uh, let me get back to that. Um, the
semi racist nature of most people.

1113
01:10:43,851 --> 01:10:48,020
Many people have told me that I sound
white or could be mistaken for a white

1114
01:10:48,021 --> 01:10:50,390
person over the phone for the life of me.

1115
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:53,750
I don't know why that
is considered racist.

1116
01:10:54,830 --> 01:10:57,500
Okay.
I don't know if you've noticed,

1117
01:10:57,501 --> 01:11:00,230
but like white people kind
of talk in a certain way.

1118
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:05,300
I mean if you watch def def jam, we just
talk in one way. But like, you know,

1119
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:09,710
there, there is, you know, if,

1120
01:11:09,711 --> 01:11:12,530
I mean if I was on here and
all of a sudden I was like, Yo,

1121
01:11:12,531 --> 01:11:15,750
you know what I'm doing more fucking
podcast is shit. He'd be like,

1122
01:11:15,751 --> 01:11:19,500
why is bill trying to talk like he's
some black dude from the ghetto?

1123
01:11:19,530 --> 01:11:23,280
Wouldn't you? Would that be
racist or you know, there's,

1124
01:11:23,670 --> 01:11:25,380
there's nothing wrong with a,

1125
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:31,560
what the fuck am I trying to say here?
If you just say somebody sounds white,

1126
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:36,840
you're not,
you're not saying they're a a moron.

1127
01:11:38,110 --> 01:11:41,950
Right. Am I a fucking idiot here? I
don't understand why I was saying,

1128
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:44,670
you know over the phone. Yeah. He
sounded like a black guy or hey,

1129
01:11:44,671 --> 01:11:46,990
you sounded white over the phone.
Is it,

1130
01:11:46,991 --> 01:11:51,270
does it go back to that correct grammar
thing that the black person then assumes

1131
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:54,850
like, Oh, why? Because I didn't say
mother fucker every five seconds.

1132
01:11:54,851 --> 01:11:56,540
I know I do a brutal fucking impression,

1133
01:11:58,540 --> 01:12:02,050
but is that why it is, that's actually
an interesting question to say.

1134
01:12:02,051 --> 01:12:05,710
Is this a great fucking podcast
through my, my stupidity.

1135
01:12:05,711 --> 01:12:07,890
You guys learned shit
unless you already know it.

1136
01:12:07,910 --> 01:12:11,320
Your role in your fucking
eyes at that place. And you
have to, if that's the case,

1137
01:12:11,410 --> 01:12:16,180
go fuck yourself. All right. And then
this guy also ends this email. He says,

1138
01:12:16,190 --> 01:12:20,590
uh, what did he say here?
Anyways, thanks to the podcast,

1139
01:12:20,591 --> 01:12:22,990
they're awesome.
And as a New York Yankees Fan,

1140
01:12:23,170 --> 01:12:26,260
I want to thank the red sox for
keeping first place warm for us.

1141
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:28,910
Good luck with David.
I can't hit anymore.

1142
01:12:29,020 --> 01:12:32,950
Now that steroids are
banned or teas and Jason,

1143
01:12:32,951 --> 01:12:36,610
we had to trade one of the best right
handed hitters of all time for this

1144
01:12:36,611 --> 01:12:40,300
nonthreatening white Gabe Bay
for the rest of the summer.

1145
01:12:41,210 --> 01:12:45,670
You know, you got a lot of balls as
a Yankee fan bringing up steroids.

1146
01:12:46,710 --> 01:12:50,370
Okay,
half your fucking team got busted.

1147
01:12:51,210 --> 01:12:55,980
Do I really need to go through
the names? A Rod, Sheffield, GMB,

1148
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:57,720
Clemens Pettitte.

1149
01:12:57,960 --> 01:13:02,580
You're a fucking $200 million
team and you're on steroids. Okay.

1150
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:06,600
At least our steroid guys. A
fucking winning championships.
Your bunch of cunts.

1151
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:10,410
No, I'm sorry. You want it 99
and 2000 with your steroid guys.

1152
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:16,020
You know, I, I love how he Yankee fans are
talking to you got to $200 million team

1153
01:13:16,060 --> 01:13:20,730
[inaudible] you're barely
playing 600 baseball. You know,

1154
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:23,310
that's like having a fucking
Lamborghini and you're psyched.

1155
01:13:23,311 --> 01:13:24,910
It's going 70 miles an hour.

1156
01:13:25,090 --> 01:13:29,680
You guys should be playing like seven
20 ball with all those fucking guys you

1157
01:13:29,681 --> 01:13:31,630
have.
And you know what the funny thing is,

1158
01:13:31,810 --> 01:13:35,530
you still don't have a bullpen so
you're not gonna win shit this year.

1159
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:39,940
It's a joke. You know what? You guys
do like a super group, you know,

1160
01:13:39,941 --> 01:13:44,110
why don't you just sign fucking Ted
Nugent to play. So play center field,

1161
01:13:45,340 --> 01:13:48,790
you know, hey, we're just
$122 million team that could,

1162
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:54,340
that's the best thing about Manny Ramirez
going out to La is that it knocked our

1163
01:13:54,341 --> 01:13:57,430
payroll way the fuck down.
Now we're down to like 122 million.

1164
01:13:57,431 --> 01:14:00,910
We're actually number four this year.
People were behind the Yankees,

1165
01:14:00,911 --> 01:14:04,750
the mets and uh,
who was at the cubs or the Dodgers?

1166
01:14:04,751 --> 01:14:08,650
I fuck him and have to Dodgers. Who
the fuck was it? Maybe the cubs.

1167
01:14:09,340 --> 01:14:11,020
I don't know who it is.
All I know is we're number,

1168
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:15,210
we're like 80 million less and this
guy's all excited cause they're two,

1169
01:14:15,220 --> 01:14:19,540
three games ahead of us even though you're
oh and eight against the red sox and

1170
01:14:19,541 --> 01:14:22,510
he got swept by the angels.
What are y'all excited?

1171
01:14:22,511 --> 01:14:26,350
Cause your feast and on the royals
and the rangers and all that Shit.

1172
01:14:27,250 --> 01:14:31,780
And Jason Bay is a great fucking
baseball player and uh, he's done,

1173
01:14:31,781 --> 01:14:36,520
been doing a great job for us and we've
barely missed Manny. I hate to say it,

1174
01:14:36,521 --> 01:14:39,190
I love the guy. And uh,
just for the record,

1175
01:14:39,191 --> 01:14:42,310
he didn't do steroids till he got to La.
You know,

1176
01:14:45,130 --> 01:14:46,360
dude,
when did he get caught?

1177
01:14:46,390 --> 01:14:49,630
He didn't got caught when he was
in Boston that whole fucking time.

1178
01:14:49,780 --> 01:14:53,530
All of a sudden he comes out to la,
he starts running with the wrong crowd,

1179
01:14:53,770 --> 01:14:57,120
you know, happens to the best of them
when they come out here. Look at rape,

1180
01:14:57,160 --> 01:15:01,240
the River Phoenix, he came
out here, he did some roids.

1181
01:15:01,241 --> 01:15:04,880
He fucking never got up again.
Cute little actor.

1182
01:15:04,881 --> 01:15:07,300
He was all right, here we
go. Here's another thing.

1183
01:15:07,301 --> 01:15:09,180
I don't know why I'm reading this,
but I'm just going to read a dude.

1184
01:15:09,181 --> 01:15:14,130
I can't believe you didn't notice
that she, okay, wait a minute.

1185
01:15:14,131 --> 01:15:18,330
Wait. Okay. Here we go. Wait a minute.

1186
01:15:19,650 --> 01:15:22,560
All right. What am I doing here? All
right, this is, this is the response.

1187
01:15:22,561 --> 01:15:26,180
One of the responses I got from
that leg sweep video last week.

1188
01:15:26,181 --> 01:15:30,150
And if you're new to my podcast,
there's a video up on Youtube,

1189
01:15:30,151 --> 01:15:34,680
I guess it got taken down where a,
this, this guy hits on this girl.

1190
01:15:34,740 --> 01:15:39,210
She doesn't, you know, she's not
having it. So he gives a shit.

1191
01:15:39,211 --> 01:15:40,920
She gives him the finger,
he calls her a bitch.

1192
01:15:40,921 --> 01:15:43,820
She throws a drink in his face
and he goes up. You think he, you,

1193
01:15:43,850 --> 01:15:47,760
he's going to blast her in the face and
he just gives a leg or her a fucking leg

1194
01:15:47,761 --> 01:15:49,920
sweep that uh,

1195
01:15:49,950 --> 01:15:53,550
it should have been done in Mandalay
Bay in Las Vegas was fucking tremendous.

1196
01:15:53,551 --> 01:15:57,960
All right, here we go. So, uh, this,
this woman wrote me, she goes, uh, Bill,

1197
01:15:57,961 --> 01:16:02,010
I can't believe he didn't notice that
she was visited with violent behavior

1198
01:16:02,011 --> 01:16:06,300
first. This is the girl in the video.
Um, cause I was sitting there and saying,

1199
01:16:06,301 --> 01:16:10,080
I thought the video was funny because
the girl threw the drink in his face and

1200
01:16:10,081 --> 01:16:11,640
even though he should never hit a woman,

1201
01:16:11,670 --> 01:16:15,240
I just think that's outrageous in life
to think that you can throw a drink in

1202
01:16:15,241 --> 01:16:16,080
somebody's face.

1203
01:16:16,470 --> 01:16:19,710
I just know if I did it within two
seconds I would be on the ground getting

1204
01:16:19,711 --> 01:16:23,250
fucking pummeled and uh,
I dunno.

1205
01:16:23,780 --> 01:16:25,740
There was just something funny
about it. So anyways, she goes,

1206
01:16:25,741 --> 01:16:29,010
I can't believe he didn't notice that
she was visited with violent behavior

1207
01:16:29,011 --> 01:16:33,330
first. Watch it again and you'll
see him violently poke at her.

1208
01:16:35,010 --> 01:16:37,260
All right. First of all, how
fucking hilarious is that violently.

1209
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:40,920
Have you ever heard that expression
in your life? Violently poked.

1210
01:16:41,190 --> 01:16:45,930
There's no such thing as being violently
poked. All right. It's called stab.

1211
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:48,780
That's, you know, that's fine. I actually,

1212
01:16:48,781 --> 01:16:52,620
my gym teacher used to violently poked
me in the chest to fucking cock sucker.

1213
01:16:53,140 --> 01:16:55,600
Um, he did and he gave her, he
gave her a little fucking poke.

1214
01:16:55,601 --> 01:16:58,470
He get one time to her fucking shoulder.
That was it.

1215
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:01,530
He was just trying to ignore her.
But anyway, she says, by the way,

1216
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:06,690
it's not very complimentary to a grown
woman to be shown that he has a crush on

1217
01:17:06,691 --> 01:17:11,330
her by punching her. He didn't
punch, he didn't punch her.

1218
01:17:11,690 --> 01:17:12,710
Anyway,
she goes,

1219
01:17:12,711 --> 01:17:16,880
I can't believe you're not allowing
her to do the only thing she can toss a

1220
01:17:16,881 --> 01:17:19,610
drink Adam,
since she can't beat him up,

1221
01:17:19,730 --> 01:17:24,420
do you honestly believe that her
throwing the drink equals his, um,

1222
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:29,090
kick slash knocked to her on the
skull? Shame on you, you bastard.

1223
01:17:32,540 --> 01:17:35,870
So I wrote her back. I said, I
knew this would spark some debate.

1224
01:17:35,900 --> 01:17:37,490
I respect your point of view on it.

1225
01:17:37,491 --> 01:17:42,140
So here's mine violently poked 41 years
on this planet and I have never heard

1226
01:17:42,141 --> 01:17:44,630
someone being violently poked.
Um,

1227
01:17:44,631 --> 01:17:48,200
she threw the drink in his face because
he called her a bitch and then she goes

1228
01:17:48,201 --> 01:17:50,420
that cause she goes,
that's right. I am a bitch.

1229
01:17:50,421 --> 01:17:53,840
And then the drink his throne and throw
in the drink in his face was not the

1230
01:17:53,841 --> 01:17:56,480
only thing she could've done.
She could have walked away.

1231
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:59,450
She could have talked to whoever
was in charge at the pool.

1232
01:17:59,570 --> 01:18:03,680
She could have talked to some of the guys
who were over there, um, by her friends.

1233
01:18:03,860 --> 01:18:07,700
There were a bunch of things she could
have done, but she lost her. Cool. Um,

1234
01:18:07,701 --> 01:18:11,870
and if you're going to define the action
by the guy in the video as violently

1235
01:18:11,871 --> 01:18:14,720
poking her,
then you could also address,

1236
01:18:14,750 --> 01:18:18,950
couldn't you also address
the racial undertones of her
giving the man the finger

1237
01:18:18,951 --> 01:18:21,740
and stating,
do you understand this and English?

1238
01:18:22,610 --> 01:18:25,430
The reason why the video is so funny
is because the unexpected happened.

1239
01:18:25,610 --> 01:18:27,290
He actually treated her the same way.

1240
01:18:27,380 --> 01:18:29,780
He would have treated a man
that threw a drink in his face.

1241
01:18:29,990 --> 01:18:32,000
So the reason men find the video funny,

1242
01:18:32,001 --> 01:18:36,170
I think is because the amount of times
women get physical with us and there's

1243
01:18:36,171 --> 01:18:39,020
nothing we can do except get punched,
slap,

1244
01:18:39,021 --> 01:18:42,500
or have a drink thrown in our face because
we're never going to hit a woman and

1245
01:18:42,501 --> 01:18:43,334
they know it.

1246
01:18:43,460 --> 01:18:46,850
I had a girl try to punch me in the
face and a bar and as I'm trying,

1247
01:18:46,851 --> 01:18:50,540
as carefully as possible to defend
against getting punched in the face,

1248
01:18:50,750 --> 01:18:54,140
basically I'm turning my back and cover
it up. Or is this girl wailed away?

1249
01:18:54,380 --> 01:18:57,170
The bouncer comes flying over.
And what do you think?

1250
01:18:57,440 --> 01:19:01,070
Who Do you think they
grabbed and tossed out? Um,

1251
01:19:01,071 --> 01:19:04,220
I was in an argument with the
female, but, so what people argue,

1252
01:19:04,490 --> 01:19:06,110
but because of the way things are,

1253
01:19:06,230 --> 01:19:09,890
she can take it to a physical level
while I have to try and defend myself

1254
01:19:09,891 --> 01:19:14,450
without getting physical with her at all,
only to be dragged out by the neck. Uh,

1255
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:17,330
you know, if they tossed her out
too, I would have been fine with it.

1256
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:21,830
But because she's a female, she gets
to throw punches, have me kicked out,

1257
01:19:21,860 --> 01:19:25,820
and she gets to stay in the bar while
they continue to serve or more drinks.

1258
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:30,920
So to go back to the video, um, that is
the world. This warm woman is living in.

1259
01:19:30,980 --> 01:19:33,020
I'm a girl.
I can do this and nothing will happen.

1260
01:19:33,021 --> 01:19:36,290
I could throw a full drink at someone's
face and nothing will happen. Well,

1261
01:19:36,291 --> 01:19:38,660
guess what?
Something did the exact thing,

1262
01:19:38,661 --> 01:19:42,380
same thing that would have happened to me.
And then I go on to say,

1263
01:19:42,381 --> 01:19:46,280
actually I would have been fucking punched
repeatedly in the face and the dude's

1264
01:19:46,281 --> 01:19:47,840
friends probably would have jumped into.

1265
01:19:47,870 --> 01:19:50,540
And you know what the reaction from the
others people at the pool would have

1266
01:19:50,541 --> 01:19:53,870
been? Well, you threw a drink at his
face. What did you think was gonna Happen?

1267
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:59,720
And then I guess my excuse would have
been, but he poked me violently. Um,

1268
01:19:59,721 --> 01:20:02,660
anyways, I've never hit a woman. I
don't advocate it, uh, that gain.

1269
01:20:02,661 --> 01:20:06,260
The video is an animal and I wouldn't
want any woman I cared about to ever date

1270
01:20:06,261 --> 01:20:07,094
him.
But the leg,

1271
01:20:07,590 --> 01:20:11,340
the fucking leg sweep was genius
and undeniably funny to me.

1272
01:20:12,690 --> 01:20:15,180
I'm just going to read you all of
these back and forth. So then she goes,

1273
01:20:15,181 --> 01:20:18,870
you have no idea what women have
women have to put up with. All right,

1274
01:20:18,871 --> 01:20:20,160
this is where I guess I'm a moron.

1275
01:20:20,490 --> 01:20:24,150
These guys take such personal
offense when they're turned down,

1276
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:25,740
he should have walked away.

1277
01:20:26,220 --> 01:20:29,520
I will not tolerate being touched
by a stranger in that way,

1278
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:32,880
and it is really a really
vulnerable feeling as a woman.

1279
01:20:33,150 --> 01:20:35,430
It makes us angry and fearful of men.

1280
01:20:35,820 --> 01:20:39,480
Besides you didn't hear the things
he was saying. Guys like that.

1281
01:20:39,540 --> 01:20:44,540
Parentheses in hip hop style clothing
are the sleaziest of scumbags licking

1282
01:20:45,361 --> 01:20:49,530
their lips. Nasty. Who's
hitting on you? Ll Cool j.

1283
01:20:50,370 --> 01:20:53,770
Why don't you fucking go to
a nicer place anyways, uh,

1284
01:20:53,790 --> 01:20:57,810
as for the argument you had in the bar,
you didn't specify.

1285
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:00,570
Now she's talking to me. This
is classic line. Here she goes.

1286
01:21:00,571 --> 01:21:03,240
As for the argument you had
with that woman in the bar,

1287
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:07,800
you didn't specify what it was about,
what it was about.

1288
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:12,270
And if you are yelling in her face,
as you know, you probably were.

1289
01:21:12,630 --> 01:21:15,840
Dot Dot, dot. More violent
behavior. He see that.

1290
01:21:17,420 --> 01:21:21,440
Let's stop right here. This is what
I love about this type of shit.

1291
01:21:22,310 --> 01:21:26,000
Anytime there's a group of people
bitching about their situation.

1292
01:21:26,001 --> 01:21:29,000
Nine Times out of 10
when they're bitching,

1293
01:21:29,210 --> 01:21:33,200
they ended up doing the exact same thing
to the person that they're bitching at,

1294
01:21:33,350 --> 01:21:35,240
that they don't want done to them.

1295
01:21:35,810 --> 01:21:39,990
Look how you assume that
immediately I'm getting hit.

1296
01:21:40,110 --> 01:21:42,930
I'm not hitting her back.
I'm getting hit and you're blaming me.

1297
01:21:42,931 --> 01:21:46,470
I'm surprised you didn't ask me
what I was wearing. Was I asking for

1298
01:21:48,170 --> 01:21:51,890
anyways, you want to hear the story,
sweetheart? This, this is basically,

1299
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:55,130
this is why this girl was
punching me in the bar. All right,

1300
01:21:56,060 --> 01:21:58,730
we're going back here about 10 years.
I'm standing up now.

1301
01:21:59,030 --> 01:22:01,280
I'm going to tell this story. My
dog's looking at me. What's up?

1302
01:22:01,370 --> 01:22:05,120
[inaudible] how you doing? Huh? You're
a female. You can defend yourself.

1303
01:22:05,121 --> 01:22:08,840
You fucking psycho. Um, this,
this is what happened. I was in,

1304
01:22:08,841 --> 01:22:11,960
I was in a bar and I was
with somebody in mind.

1305
01:22:11,961 --> 01:22:14,570
This group of girls is next to us.
We're hitting on them. You know,

1306
01:22:15,170 --> 01:22:18,020
we'll make jokes with joking around. You
know, he tried to get women to laugh.

1307
01:22:18,021 --> 01:22:20,270
That's what the fuck you have
to do. Women. I know you don't,

1308
01:22:20,330 --> 01:22:22,970
you don't understand that because you
don't have to make somebody want to fuck

1309
01:22:22,971 --> 01:22:25,580
you. Okay. The same way,

1310
01:22:25,581 --> 01:22:29,510
I don't know what it's like to have to
carry a fucking living thing inside of me

1311
01:22:29,511 --> 01:22:34,340
for nine months. I understand. We
all have our advantages, so whatever,

1312
01:22:34,341 --> 01:22:36,670
I'm not trying to be a Douche
here, but this is basically, it's,

1313
01:22:36,671 --> 01:22:38,780
so we're trying to,
we know we're joking around or whatever.

1314
01:22:38,781 --> 01:22:39,650
I had a couple of drinks,

1315
01:22:39,651 --> 01:22:42,440
they had a couple of drinks and
one of them was dressed like,

1316
01:22:42,550 --> 01:22:46,010
she looked like Rhoda on Mary Tyler Moore.
All right.

1317
01:22:46,220 --> 01:22:50,210
So at one point that girl goes up and uh,
she goes to go to the bathroom.

1318
01:22:50,211 --> 01:22:52,090
So I say to a friend and go,
Jesus Christ was she,

1319
01:22:52,310 --> 01:22:54,400
she a big fan of Mary Tyler Moore or what?
Right.

1320
01:22:54,410 --> 01:22:58,850
Made a joke about what she was wearing.
So another 20 minutes goes by,

1321
01:22:58,851 --> 01:23:01,930
those girls Kinda peeled off, you know,
we weren't really talking to them anymore.

1322
01:23:01,950 --> 01:23:05,060
We were, uh, well maybe we kind of
were, I don't know what was going on.

1323
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:08,260
Sort of that type of shit. You're
talking to a girl for a couple seconds,

1324
01:23:08,261 --> 01:23:09,640
then it's not working out.
So I went back,

1325
01:23:09,641 --> 01:23:14,641
I was talking to my friend and I guess
when the girl came back from the,

1326
01:23:14,921 --> 01:23:18,850
from the bathroom,
her friend told her what I said.

1327
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:22,450
So unbeknownst to me,
so I'm sitting there talking to my buddy.

1328
01:23:22,451 --> 01:23:26,230
Then all of a sudden they just hear
this, this, this woman yelling,

1329
01:23:26,410 --> 01:23:30,730
hey bitch, hey bitch. Right.

1330
01:23:31,390 --> 01:23:36,310
So I look over and she's looking
at me. She's going, hey bitch.

1331
01:23:36,311 --> 01:23:40,390
And I'm, and I'm, I'm trying to
process cause I, you know, typical may,

1332
01:23:40,391 --> 01:23:44,890
I said some shit. I don't even remember
what the fuck I said. And then she goes,

1333
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:49,810
you know, you're going to talk shit
about me when I'm not around. And then I,

1334
01:23:49,811 --> 01:23:51,730
then I kind of was right
as I'm putting it together.

1335
01:23:51,731 --> 01:23:56,200
Then she stood up and she fucking put
her hand over. You ever see like a,

1336
01:23:56,260 --> 01:23:57,071
you ever see like a,

1337
01:23:57,071 --> 01:24:01,360
a center in the NBA how they fight or
they can't throw fake fucking throw

1338
01:24:01,361 --> 01:24:06,160
punches like that. They're trying to
fucking throw somebody out at second base.

1339
01:24:06,370 --> 01:24:07,210
That's what she did.

1340
01:24:07,300 --> 01:24:11,350
She winds up and she's about ready
to come down on the top of my head.

1341
01:24:12,070 --> 01:24:15,850
So you know, because she wound up,
I mean if he fucking threw a jab,

1342
01:24:15,851 --> 01:24:17,680
she would have fucking
blasted me right in the face.

1343
01:24:17,681 --> 01:24:19,330
And I got to admit that
would've been fucking hilarious.

1344
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:20,950
But because she went up and over,

1345
01:24:21,220 --> 01:24:24,580
I was able to get my arm
up in time and I saw it.

1346
01:24:24,610 --> 01:24:29,560
I sorta like cut her wrist. So now I
instantly, I recognize the situation.

1347
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:30,550
I'm like,
oh fuck,

1348
01:24:31,150 --> 01:24:35,890
okay this girl is not going to stop and
I don't want to get hit in the face.

1349
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:37,990
I can't squeeze her risk too hard.

1350
01:24:37,991 --> 01:24:41,110
All this shit's going through my head
and I know, even though I can't see it,

1351
01:24:41,111 --> 01:24:44,050
I know the bounces are on their way
over and I know what the fuck's going to

1352
01:24:44,051 --> 01:24:44,530
happen.

1353
01:24:44,530 --> 01:24:49,420
So all I'm doing is holding her wrist
as she's fucking client at my side.

1354
01:24:49,421 --> 01:24:53,320
I'm sort of turned to the side and of
course my buddies aren't doing anything.

1355
01:24:53,321 --> 01:24:57,310
This sort of just looking at this point
cause it happened so fast and I'm going,

1356
01:24:57,311 --> 01:25:00,400
Whoa, Whoa, whoa. I was going, hey, hey,
hey, I can't even, what I was saying,

1357
01:25:00,401 --> 01:25:04,420
I was just, this just too much
shit was going on. I, I couldn't,

1358
01:25:05,320 --> 01:25:07,480
I couldn't formulate anything
to say to get this girl to stop,

1359
01:25:07,481 --> 01:25:09,670
but she just kept fucking bitch.
You fucking bitch.

1360
01:25:09,730 --> 01:25:13,510
It was like punching me in the side and
then the fucking bounce has come over

1361
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:17,140
and they fucking grabbed me.
Of course, because I'm the guy.

1362
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:20,680
I just blew my mind. I, I'm fucking,

1363
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:25,330
I almost have my back turned to this girl
with my hand up and she's wailing away

1364
01:25:25,480 --> 01:25:29,410
and they immediately go to me
and I get fucking tossed out,

1365
01:25:30,190 --> 01:25:32,950
you know? So let me ask
you this. In her world,

1366
01:25:33,130 --> 01:25:37,090
was she justified for taking
it to a physical level?

1367
01:25:37,091 --> 01:25:40,750
Because I fucking made fun of her outfit.
You know,

1368
01:25:40,900 --> 01:25:44,620
that's was my point about that video.
I don't think that you should hit a woman.

1369
01:25:45,450 --> 01:25:49,000
Really. The reality of that video that
I, that I watched, they're on youtube,

1370
01:25:49,180 --> 01:25:51,970
is that they're both assholes
and they're both stubborn.

1371
01:25:52,270 --> 01:25:56,350
And what happened there is what you saw
when you get two stubborn people who

1372
01:25:56,351 --> 01:25:59,580
want to get the last word
in. Okay. He had on her,

1373
01:25:59,710 --> 01:26:02,140
she tells him to go fuck himself.
Not saying she literally said that,

1374
01:26:02,141 --> 01:26:06,290
but she basically says no. So he couldn't
handle it. So he probably, he starts it,

1375
01:26:07,070 --> 01:26:09,710
I'll go, I'll give you
that. He starts it. Okay.

1376
01:26:10,430 --> 01:26:15,260
And he wants to get the last word
in so she can't let them. Right.

1377
01:26:15,860 --> 01:26:18,540
He should have walked away,
but he did. That's you know,

1378
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:20,720
right in the beginning he didn't,
so he gives her shit.

1379
01:26:21,530 --> 01:26:24,480
Then she should have walked away.
Realized he was a psycho. She'd had,

1380
01:26:24,530 --> 01:26:26,960
she fucking gives them the finger
than he should have walked away,

1381
01:26:26,961 --> 01:26:30,530
but he doesn't, he pokes
her. She should've walked
away then, but she doesn't,

1382
01:26:31,220 --> 01:26:34,190
she fucking throws a drink at his face.
He should have fucking walked away.

1383
01:26:34,310 --> 01:26:36,680
He doesn't, he fucking goes
up and he likes sweeps her.

1384
01:26:37,370 --> 01:26:38,300
It's just one of those deals,

1385
01:26:38,301 --> 01:26:42,680
two fucking assholes who probably should
be breeding and make a little fucking

1386
01:26:42,681 --> 01:26:45,940
asshole kid. And then we'll have
another dog. The bounty hunter. Huh?

1387
01:26:46,010 --> 01:26:50,270
You see how that math works out. So
anyways, um, I, you know, I don't know.

1388
01:26:50,630 --> 01:26:53,330
Sometimes I feel like I'm saying shit
and people don't get what the fuck I'm

1389
01:26:53,331 --> 01:26:55,460
talking about. I'm not saying that
you should go around hitting a woman.

1390
01:26:55,461 --> 01:26:57,680
I'm just saying, you know,
guy, she never hit women,

1391
01:26:57,681 --> 01:27:00,950
but women shouldn't take advantage
of that by doing outrageous shit.

1392
01:27:01,370 --> 01:27:06,370
Like throwing a drink in somebody's face
that is fucking outrageous behavior.

1393
01:27:07,041 --> 01:27:08,510
And be honest.
As a female,

1394
01:27:08,540 --> 01:27:11,270
if another female walked up to you
and threw a drink in your face,

1395
01:27:11,271 --> 01:27:16,190
what would you do? Huh? What would you
do? Would you just go out with mature?

1396
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:18,440
Do you feel better about yourself?

1397
01:27:18,441 --> 01:27:22,550
Is sprite is dripping down the
fucking your bangs, whatever. Fucking

1398
01:27:24,140 --> 01:27:27,440
you got that Rachel Bob Haircut
from friends. Ah, look at me,

1399
01:27:27,680 --> 01:27:29,910
look at me with that
fucking check reference. Um,

1400
01:27:30,860 --> 01:27:34,220
whatever it gives a fuck. Anyways.
All right, here's, here's some videos.

1401
01:27:34,221 --> 01:27:39,110
So I actually was, I nominated that
video for a video of the year and a,

1402
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:42,950
so people sent me some other videos
and I'm really upset at myself because

1403
01:27:42,951 --> 01:27:47,030
somebody sent me a great video of these
two bullies attack in this guy with his

1404
01:27:47,031 --> 01:27:48,770
girlfriend and his,

1405
01:27:48,830 --> 01:27:53,210
the guy's girlfriend jumps in and she
fucking blast this guy in the face in the

1406
01:27:53,211 --> 01:27:56,420
end. It's a fucking awesome video. Um,

1407
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:59,900
so I really need that video so I
can balance it out, Sarah. You know,

1408
01:27:59,930 --> 01:28:04,800
so I don't just have videos of guys
knock and women down because, uh,

1409
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:07,040
that's not what I'm trying to do here.
You know what I mean?

1410
01:28:07,070 --> 01:28:09,500
This is supposed to be a fun
thing for everybody. And, uh,

1411
01:28:11,900 --> 01:28:14,810
all right, so here you go. Here's
some nominees. Uh, somebody, uh,

1412
01:28:14,811 --> 01:28:17,600
ONA fan said a east freely was in,
uh,

1413
01:28:17,610 --> 01:28:21,860
was on the show this week celebrating
Jim Norton's birthday. Um,

1414
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:24,770
and he recommended a video
called Winnebago man.

1415
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:28,820
I watched it and it's fucking hilarious.
Um, Google how to spell when a,

1416
01:28:28,850 --> 01:28:32,090
when a bag. I'm just going to tell you
what the name of the videos are. Uh,

1417
01:28:32,091 --> 01:28:35,870
there's another one,
a guy with gun confronts skateboarder,

1418
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:41,630
and there's another one that
says, uh, this is the last one.

1419
01:28:41,631 --> 01:28:46,250
And I deliberately put this one last
because this is more in the vein of last

1420
01:28:46,250 --> 01:28:49,730
week's video. It says, guy gets
revenge on girlfriend for headache.

1421
01:28:49,970 --> 01:28:54,970
This one's really more silly
and I'm actually jealous
of like how perfectly this

1422
01:28:58,251 --> 01:29:02,940
guy's prank works out. It's just,
it's, it really is a work of art. And,

1423
01:29:02,941 --> 01:29:06,360
uh, most females won't like it, but it's,
you know, no one gets hurt in this one.

1424
01:29:06,750 --> 01:29:11,160
Okay? Nobody's head
hits concrete. Um, yeah,

1425
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:14,820
that's it. Okay. And if
you're sick of those kinds of
videos, there's one on there.

1426
01:29:14,820 --> 01:29:18,870
Have a little fucking golden
retriever. Puppy howling. All right.

1427
01:29:18,990 --> 01:29:22,290
Go Google that one. Okay. That'll
make you fucking smile. All right,

1428
01:29:22,770 --> 01:29:26,040
I'm going to have to wind this. Jesus
Christ. 47 fucking minutes. All right,

1429
01:29:26,041 --> 01:29:28,830
let me wind this up real quick.
We're talking about grenades again,

1430
01:29:28,831 --> 01:29:32,940
people the subject that just won't die.
Uh,

1431
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:37,050
anyways, uh, Bill, I missed the last
couple of podcasts. This is from a marine,

1432
01:29:37,051 --> 01:29:38,580
so we can all hang out here,
right?

1433
01:29:38,730 --> 01:29:42,780
47 minutes and let's support the troops
and listen to the last few minutes of

1434
01:29:42,781 --> 01:29:46,920
the podcast here. I missed the last
few podcasts, but there was, um,

1435
01:29:47,850 --> 01:29:50,880
there was a lot about the military.
You seem to be interested in the military,

1436
01:29:50,890 --> 01:29:51,980
Bubba, bubba. Oh,

1437
01:29:52,290 --> 01:29:57,150
and I was a marine for four years
and did my tour in the sandbox.

1438
01:29:57,180 --> 01:29:58,560
Parentheses,
Iraq.

1439
01:29:58,860 --> 01:30:02,640
Go on Wikipedia and type
in operation Phantom fury.

1440
01:30:03,090 --> 01:30:04,500
Those are my credentials.

1441
01:30:04,980 --> 01:30:08,610
That kid you talked about on
six 29 was kind of a joke.

1442
01:30:09,090 --> 01:30:10,320
I can tell by what he says.

1443
01:30:10,321 --> 01:30:14,220
So he's basically saying the other are
there other military person who gave me

1444
01:30:14,221 --> 01:30:18,000
my grenade information is uh,
you know,

1445
01:30:18,030 --> 01:30:22,350
I guess working in a mess hall. Look at
me trying to start some shit. Look at me.

1446
01:30:22,440 --> 01:30:26,490
Huh? Hey Guy from uh, June 29th,
you're going to take that shit.

1447
01:30:26,700 --> 01:30:29,370
He's saying you don't know about grenades.
So anyways,

1448
01:30:29,371 --> 01:30:32,610
he says fragrance aids have
a kill radius of five meters.

1449
01:30:33,180 --> 01:30:38,180
A casualty is 15 meters casualty.

1450
01:30:39,541 --> 01:30:42,120
I guess that's, you know,
shrapnel. Okay. Marines define,

1451
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:45,180
definitely use frags when necessary.

1452
01:30:45,420 --> 01:30:48,210
They use flash bangs when doing raids.

1453
01:30:48,660 --> 01:30:52,740
If you're using a flash bang and
entering a room and you shoot blindly

1454
01:30:52,741 --> 01:30:54,780
everywhere,
it is totally contrary.

1455
01:30:54,870 --> 01:30:57,840
It's a total contradiction to what
you're doing in the first place.

1456
01:30:58,050 --> 01:31:01,800
Trying not to kill everyone in the room.
If there's bad guys in there,

1457
01:31:01,950 --> 01:31:04,980
you frag the fucks, I guess that
she throw the grenade in there.

1458
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:08,820
And if you throw in one,
you might as well throw in five grenades.

1459
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:13,020
Aren't that lethal? Well they
are, but it just kinda depends.

1460
01:31:13,260 --> 01:31:15,780
Two guys and another company
tossed grenades into the,

1461
01:31:15,781 --> 01:31:19,680
into our house from different directions
only to have the grenades roll across

1462
01:31:19,681 --> 01:31:23,280
the house, cross paths and in front
of the other marine respectively.

1463
01:31:23,820 --> 01:31:26,940
Jesus Christ. I think I saw
this on the three stooges. Uh,

1464
01:31:26,941 --> 01:31:31,680
they both dove away and Eileen and only
received a minor shrapnel to the legs.

1465
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:35,700
Uh, more of something to laugh
about more than anything. All right,

1466
01:31:35,701 --> 01:31:38,220
so there's your grenade information.
Here we go with earplugs.

1467
01:31:38,221 --> 01:31:42,540
Getting back to the Tinnitus
Shit. Um, went in some nasty shit.

1468
01:31:42,570 --> 01:31:46,410
Basically when you're in battle,
you have one ear plug in and one out,

1469
01:31:46,910 --> 01:31:51,360
uh, due to the sound
resistance created by plugs,

1470
01:31:51,361 --> 01:31:55,260
it only allows you to hear a certain
range of noise, take one out,

1471
01:31:55,320 --> 01:31:59,440
and it allows you to hear the larger
range of noise even after you can barely

1472
01:31:59,441 --> 01:32:03,610
hear out of one year. Dude, that's
fucking insane. That's what I did. And,

1473
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:07,780
and it always worked.
So basically you sacrifice one year.

1474
01:32:07,781 --> 01:32:11,800
Did you switch off every other
battle? You know, or did you just say,

1475
01:32:11,801 --> 01:32:14,170
fuck my left ear?
Um,

1476
01:32:14,171 --> 01:32:16,400
I guess you need to do that because
what if you have the ear plugs in and

1477
01:32:16,410 --> 01:32:20,050
somebody's sneaking up behind
you? Good God, thank God.

1478
01:32:20,140 --> 01:32:23,140
Thank God I didn't have to do
that. God bless Ya. Anyways,

1479
01:32:23,170 --> 01:32:26,620
a machine gun next to an unprotected
ear isn't that bad at all.

1480
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:30,340
Loud is explosions loud as airstrikes.

1481
01:32:30,341 --> 01:32:34,630
Loud rockets loud is standing next to a
tank and an ally and not having an ear

1482
01:32:34,631 --> 01:32:39,190
plugs that concussion river reverberates
and reckless Shay's along the walls and

1483
01:32:39,191 --> 01:32:43,720
the of the buildings. Um, I know
because it happened to me when,

1484
01:32:43,780 --> 01:32:48,070
and my ears started to leak clear fluid,
presumably,

1485
01:32:48,100 --> 01:32:50,740
presumably from perforated eardrums.

1486
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:53,380
The sound was beyond sound.

1487
01:32:54,370 --> 01:32:56,380
That's one of the greatest
sentences I've ever read.

1488
01:32:56,381 --> 01:33:01,090
As far as like fucking description. The
sound was beyond sound. It was an impact.

1489
01:33:01,091 --> 01:33:05,860
It felt like I was hit with a two by
four across my entire body all at once.

1490
01:33:06,250 --> 01:33:08,140
My face and my balls hurt.

1491
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:15,460
Jesus Christ. That's from sound,
I guess. I don't fucking know.

1492
01:33:15,461 --> 01:33:18,490
Just shut up and read a bill.
All right. Um, I had my one,

1493
01:33:18,580 --> 01:33:21,130
I had my wind knocked out.
Basically I was,

1494
01:33:21,160 --> 01:33:23,200
I was almost even with the barrel of them,

1495
01:33:23,230 --> 01:33:26,260
of the main tank gun
and the fucking tankers,

1496
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:31,480
fucking guys in a tank never gave us a
signal that they were going to shoot. Um,

1497
01:33:32,110 --> 01:33:35,230
that's what it can because of
a concussion blast feels like,

1498
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:39,480
and it gets worse the closer you get
and the bigger the explosion is throwing

1499
01:33:39,490 --> 01:33:42,260
some shrapnel and you get the idea.
Jesus Christ,

1500
01:33:42,261 --> 01:33:46,210
who this is better than the fucking
history channel. I'm really enjoying this.

1501
01:33:46,240 --> 01:33:50,590
All right. Um, and you talked
about the stress of battle.

1502
01:33:50,950 --> 01:33:55,950
There was one dude who was about to get
out of an Aa v big armored vehicle and

1503
01:33:56,351 --> 01:34:00,940
he went blind,
I guess he's saying from the stress.

1504
01:34:00,970 --> 01:34:05,170
And then he writes, just went blind.
He regained his sight a few days later,

1505
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:09,460
but right before he got out, he
literally had to turn around and say, ah,

1506
01:34:09,910 --> 01:34:13,930
I can't fucking see Jesus Christ.

1507
01:34:14,950 --> 01:34:17,870
Um, as for a funny story, Oh,
you know what, that reminds me.

1508
01:34:17,871 --> 01:34:21,130
How have you guys seen that
movie? Uh, the fuck was that.

1509
01:34:21,131 --> 01:34:25,470
I was going to tell you to
watch that last week. It was a,

1510
01:34:25,471 --> 01:34:28,570
it was an animated movie about war.

1511
01:34:29,590 --> 01:34:33,880
The fuck was it called? I just rented
it. Waltz with waltz with Bashir.

1512
01:34:34,990 --> 01:34:38,170
You guys see that? I def,
I highly recommend that.

1513
01:34:38,890 --> 01:34:43,090
That's about a guy who went to war.
And when he came back,

1514
01:34:43,091 --> 01:34:44,590
he couldn't fucking remember anything.

1515
01:34:44,591 --> 01:34:48,280
So then he goes around and he talks
to his former army buddies, you know,

1516
01:34:48,310 --> 01:34:51,580
that's the whole hook.
A guy who can't remember,

1517
01:34:51,890 --> 01:34:54,190
goes around and talks to
those who can't forget.

1518
01:34:54,250 --> 01:34:58,400
It's pretty fucking pretty fucking
amazing. So anyways, let me continue here.

1519
01:34:59,230 --> 01:35:03,500
Um, and as far as for a funny story, um,

1520
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:06,320
in war the stories are all fucked up.

1521
01:35:06,321 --> 01:35:10,580
It's all fucked up humor when you're
over there like really sadistic fucked up

1522
01:35:10,581 --> 01:35:15,410
shit. Even the nicest evangelist
stick person or a Mormon, uh,

1523
01:35:15,411 --> 01:35:17,570
we'll have the same humor over there.
Personally,

1524
01:35:17,571 --> 01:35:22,520
I found it hilarious when insurgents
were so drugged up they would literally

1525
01:35:22,521 --> 01:35:26,900
step out of an alley in front of a
tank about 50 feet away and just start

1526
01:35:26,901 --> 01:35:29,090
shooting an AK 47 at the thing.

1527
01:35:29,570 --> 01:35:33,500
The machine gun on the tank would slowly
point towards the dude and just shred

1528
01:35:33,501 --> 01:35:37,550
them. That's funny when
you're over there. Wow.

1529
01:35:37,970 --> 01:35:42,410
This is like time life books presents
the Iraq war as it's going on.

1530
01:35:42,411 --> 01:35:44,040
So let me ask you this.
You saying the dude,

1531
01:35:44,041 --> 01:35:49,041
so like hopped up on drugs like are a
lot of the insurgents over there on drugs

1532
01:35:50,991 --> 01:35:54,170
and why are they on drugs? Cause they're
scared from the stress of the battle.

1533
01:35:54,171 --> 01:35:57,270
I mean I can't,
I can't imagine that anyway.

1534
01:35:57,410 --> 01:36:02,410
It's probably the best story that normal
people can relate to was when we first

1535
01:36:02,451 --> 01:36:06,680
took over a centrally located
compound within the city of Fallujah,

1536
01:36:07,640 --> 01:36:12,080
um, referred to above his operation
Phantom fury. Dude, you were in Fallujah.

1537
01:36:12,081 --> 01:36:15,740
Holy Shit. All right, this is a great
story by the way. So hang in there guys.

1538
01:36:15,741 --> 01:36:20,540
I know this is long. Um, this was the
third day of the assault on the city.

1539
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:25,900
Obviously after three days a bunch of
dudes are going to have to take a shit at

1540
01:36:26,121 --> 01:36:29,810
some point. So we had to dig
some trenches, the trenches.

1541
01:36:29,811 --> 01:36:32,990
We're in the middle of a large courtyard
about the size of a football field and

1542
01:36:32,991 --> 01:36:36,290
instead of just standing over the
trench like a dog and squatting to shit,

1543
01:36:36,590 --> 01:36:40,880
we knew we had to find something
to assist us when we dropped guts.

1544
01:36:41,660 --> 01:36:44,240
Good Lord. Okay. I mean, fuck
it. We're going to have to,

1545
01:36:44,241 --> 01:36:47,900
if we're going to get popped while
taking a shit, we better be comfortable.

1546
01:36:48,170 --> 01:36:52,280
We started searching around and inside
some of the side buildings we found some

1547
01:36:52,281 --> 01:36:53,840
chairs and some wooden boxes.

1548
01:36:54,110 --> 01:36:58,640
We cut holes in them and position them
over the trenches. Um, the area wasn't,

1549
01:36:58,700 --> 01:37:01,970
uh,
what the military would deem as a,

1550
01:37:01,971 --> 01:37:03,950
would not consider a secure at the time.

1551
01:37:03,951 --> 01:37:08,180
But after eating the instant
dehydrated shit meals called Mrs,

1552
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:11,180
which constipate you,
uh,

1553
01:37:11,210 --> 01:37:14,540
you having constant op
operations for three days,

1554
01:37:14,541 --> 01:37:19,541
we hadn't had a satisfying shit for three
days after the new shitters were set

1555
01:37:20,781 --> 01:37:20,960
up.

1556
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:25,880
Guys were a little apprehensive to go out
there as there were still RPGs mortars

1557
01:37:25,881 --> 01:37:28,640
and gunfires directed
towards our compound.

1558
01:37:29,420 --> 01:37:34,340
You have to understand that marines and
the marine corps, all right, this is,

1559
01:37:34,341 --> 01:37:36,620
this is Kinda, this is him
saying this shit, not me.

1560
01:37:36,621 --> 01:37:39,180
You have to understand that the
marines in the Marine Corps, uh,

1561
01:37:39,181 --> 01:37:42,380
like are retarded.
Many individuals are very,

1562
01:37:42,830 --> 01:37:44,870
actually are very intelligent
within the marines,

1563
01:37:44,871 --> 01:37:49,310
but the Marine Corps just makes you
into a retard and therefore the policies

1564
01:37:49,311 --> 01:37:51,770
within the marine corps
are retarded as well.

1565
01:37:51,950 --> 01:37:54,740
The only thing the marine corps
doesn't fuck up his combat,

1566
01:37:55,290 --> 01:37:59,790
this retardation is why most
people realist less with
the Marine Corps than any

1567
01:37:59,791 --> 01:38:03,380
other branch. Well, you have
to expand on that. So anyways,

1568
01:38:03,390 --> 01:38:07,080
so being the real retarded
marines we were, we said, fuck it.

1569
01:38:07,350 --> 01:38:11,850
A bunch of US strolled out and took
off our kavlaars, our helmets and flax,

1570
01:38:11,880 --> 01:38:15,360
bulletproof vests,
as well as our blouses shirts.

1571
01:38:15,630 --> 01:38:20,190
Within two minutes there were 10 or 12
marine sitting in the middle of a bay, uh,

1572
01:38:20,220 --> 01:38:21,180
middle of this field,

1573
01:38:21,181 --> 01:38:25,590
bear his bones courtyard the size of a
football field with only t shirts and

1574
01:38:25,591 --> 01:38:28,590
trousers at the ankles,
smoking butts, chewing, dip,

1575
01:38:28,591 --> 01:38:31,440
joking around like we
had a fucking Applebee's.

1576
01:38:31,650 --> 01:38:36,240
While there were explosions and gunfire
going off 150 meters away. Jesus Christ,

1577
01:38:36,241 --> 01:38:40,870
it was Robert Duvall, a fucking
surfing in the background. Actually.

1578
01:38:40,871 --> 01:38:43,520
He didn't surf. He was on the beach.
Anyways. Um, as we were sitting there,

1579
01:38:43,540 --> 01:38:47,670
a few civilian reporters poke their heads
out of the compound and went back in.

1580
01:38:48,540 --> 01:38:52,800
They were looking to see in the proverbial
coast to see if the proverbial coast

1581
01:38:52,801 --> 01:38:56,460
was clear to the armored vehicle
they were using for transport.

1582
01:38:56,640 --> 01:39:00,720
So basically there was a
bunch of reporters poking
their heads out trying to get

1583
01:39:00,721 --> 01:39:03,210
over to their fucking armored transport.
Mind you.

1584
01:39:03,211 --> 01:39:07,890
This was the typical type of vehicle
with the type of armor that our unit

1585
01:39:07,891 --> 01:39:12,030
couldn't get at the time because ours
kept getting fucked up and it was too much

1586
01:39:12,031 --> 01:39:17,031
of a monetary drain to give us the proper
protection because our B vehicles will

1587
01:39:17,310 --> 01:39:20,790
get blown up every couple of weeks are
in paraphrasing cause this is really

1588
01:39:20,791 --> 01:39:22,890
fucking long. Um, these business,

1589
01:39:22,920 --> 01:39:25,110
these people had no business
being there and they knew it.

1590
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:28,590
This was evidenced by the fact that
they continue to poke their heads out of

1591
01:39:28,591 --> 01:39:30,540
doorways several more times.

1592
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:34,170
Apparently they got the carrot
carriage up because all at once,

1593
01:39:34,171 --> 01:39:37,950
the group of about 10 people
who look like my seventh grade,

1594
01:39:38,100 --> 01:39:42,600
a gym class started making their way
to the armor armored vehicle in there.

1595
01:39:42,601 --> 01:39:47,280
Gay Little Blue Helmets, invest that
read press in big bold white letters.

1596
01:39:48,140 --> 01:39:53,010
They were visibly nervous
jogging mechanically and
looking spastic Lee in every

1597
01:39:53,011 --> 01:39:56,870
direction as if they would somehow be
able to change their fate. Infants,

1598
01:39:56,910 --> 01:40:01,260
if an insurgent decided to lean out a
window and opened fire at them as they

1599
01:40:01,261 --> 01:40:02,011
jogged along,

1600
01:40:02,011 --> 01:40:06,390
we sat there half naked from the
bottom down and stared at them in utter

1601
01:40:06,391 --> 01:40:09,420
amusement.
After a few seconds of silence,

1602
01:40:09,421 --> 01:40:13,110
someone shitting next to
me screamed and comment.

1603
01:40:13,470 --> 01:40:18,000
It was like a kick to the fucking
nuts. Uh, something snapped.

1604
01:40:18,001 --> 01:40:20,520
The reporters absolutely lost their shit.

1605
01:40:21,060 --> 01:40:24,840
It was one of the most beautiful examples
of Darwinism in action that I have

1606
01:40:24,841 --> 01:40:25,531
ever witnessed.

1607
01:40:25,531 --> 01:40:29,340
The strongest and fastest males threw
themselves into the truck first,

1608
01:40:29,670 --> 01:40:32,040
not far behind where
they're smaller males.

1609
01:40:32,490 --> 01:40:36,180
They were then followed by the most
attractive females who were pulled almost

1610
01:40:36,181 --> 01:40:39,750
instantly into the, into the truck. Um,

1611
01:40:39,780 --> 01:40:41,220
in last where the wingman,

1612
01:40:42,870 --> 01:40:47,700
wingman grenades helped in only by their,
their own large legs.

1613
01:40:48,170 --> 01:40:51,420
I don't get that last sentence. Uh, after
they realized that they were actually,

1614
01:40:51,421 --> 01:40:55,630
there was no actually incoming
really butchering this, sorry,

1615
01:40:55,631 --> 01:40:57,130
I'm seeing double at this point.
Uh,

1616
01:40:57,131 --> 01:41:00,700
after they realize that there
actually was no incoming, they slowly,

1617
01:41:00,701 --> 01:41:05,440
she grossly turned to look over at us
as we were sitting there with our balls

1618
01:41:05,441 --> 01:41:09,040
flapping in the wind dirty as fuck
while pushing out three days worth of

1619
01:41:09,041 --> 01:41:13,780
compacted tar and having no business
being happy in any way whatsoever.

1620
01:41:13,870 --> 01:41:16,240
But we were absolutely
all dying with laughter.

1621
01:41:16,510 --> 01:41:20,530
We continue laughing as they drove by
and we sat there smiling and waving at

1622
01:41:20,531 --> 01:41:25,090
them wildly like what people do
when a cruise ship leaves port.

1623
01:41:25,630 --> 01:41:30,370
They stared at us and
complete bewilderment and
just simply started shaking

1624
01:41:30,371 --> 01:41:35,320
their heads in a way a parent does when
a small child gets a pair of new clothes

1625
01:41:35,770 --> 01:41:37,810
covered in spaghetti and meat sauce.

1626
01:41:38,710 --> 01:41:41,830
But we weren't kids and we definitely
weren't dirty from eating spaghetti.

1627
01:41:41,831 --> 01:41:43,230
Fucking classic.
Dude,

1628
01:41:43,231 --> 01:41:45,700
that's a great story and I
apologize for butchering that thing.

1629
01:41:45,701 --> 01:41:48,380
I suck at reading out loud. Um, anyways,

1630
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:50,980
this podcast has to be over a
fucking hour at this point. Yeah,

1631
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:52,750
it just turned an hour.
All right.

1632
01:41:52,770 --> 01:41:57,070
Has been a really long podcast
with a lot of information. Um,

1633
01:41:57,280 --> 01:42:00,790
this has been the encyclopedia Britannica
version of the Monday morning podcast.

1634
01:42:00,791 --> 01:42:03,640
You guys all have a good week.
I hope you enjoyed the stories.

1635
01:42:03,641 --> 01:42:05,170
Forgive me for my awful reading

1636
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:09,480
and uh, oh, let me hype a
couple of gigs. I got coming up.

1637
01:42:09,481 --> 01:42:12,840
I'm going to be at providence at
the comedy connection in Providence,

1638
01:42:12,841 --> 01:42:17,841
Rhode Island in August and the next week
I will be at the punchline in Atlanta,

1639
01:42:19,471 --> 01:42:24,060
Georgia. And after that,
the final day, August 29th,

1640
01:42:24,061 --> 01:42:27,620
I'm going to be in
Stockholm, Sweden. So, uh,

1641
01:42:27,950 --> 01:42:29,880
who the fuck is going to go
to that nobody from Sweden

1642
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:33,180
listen to this shit. So that's it. That's
the Monday morning podcasts you want.

1643
01:42:33,190 --> 01:42:36,390
If you want to know the exact
dates, please go to my website. Uh,

1644
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:40,570
it's bill@billbird.com. B U R R in,
please sign up for my mailing list.

1645
01:42:41,290 --> 01:42:46,160
Um, cause I'm really starting
to lose my faith in my space.

1646
01:42:46,161 --> 01:42:50,840
There's just nobody left on there. Like
nobody fucking emails me anymore. So, um,

1647
01:42:51,620 --> 01:42:54,620
and I don't want to join Facebook
and I don't want to tweet.

1648
01:42:55,070 --> 01:42:59,750
So I think I'm just going to basically
maybe phase out my myspace page and I'm

1649
01:42:59,751 --> 01:43:04,640
going to just start doing shit
on my, uh, my website. Mainly.

1650
01:43:05,390 --> 01:43:07,320
That's the plan. All right.
You guys all have a great week.

1651
01:43:07,430 --> 01:43:12,430
[inaudible] [inaudible].
