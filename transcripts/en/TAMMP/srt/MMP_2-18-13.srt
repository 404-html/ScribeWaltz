1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:02,520
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02,521 --> 00:00:06,000
It's bill burr and it's the
Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:06,001 --> 00:00:09,630
February 18th,

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,020
2013 and a right off the bat
you should be going like, well,

5
00:00:13,021 --> 00:00:16,830
this sounds a lot different than
all the other ones. Yes it does.

6
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:19,770
Um,
there's a reason for that.

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,000
The reason for it is
because the handy recorder,

8
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:26,160
h four n r by zoom,

9
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:31,520
the zoom h four n handy recorder
is a fucking diva hunk of shit.

10
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,410
Fuck that recorder. And it's
nonexistent. Digital ass.

11
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,360
I've had more Goddamn fucking problems
with this thing. First of all,

12
00:00:45,361 --> 00:00:49,400
they give you a fucking memory card.
We can record like just over a podcast.

13
00:00:49,401 --> 00:00:54,000
So every fucking God damn week
I start the podcast.

14
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:56,670
If I forgot your race, the
last one, I have a problem.

15
00:00:56,671 --> 00:00:58,140
And I know what you guys are thinking.
Well Bill,

16
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:01,800
why don't you buy a new fucking
memory card while I'm an asshole?

17
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,553
Okay.

18
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:07,140
Committedly I'm an asshole. But you
know what I did? You know what I did?

19
00:01:07,141 --> 00:01:10,770
People get swirl. Fucking Billy
red faced went the other day.

20
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:15,300
Well, I went to the wrong place first,
but then they told me where to go.

21
00:01:15,301 --> 00:01:17,280
And then I went and I bought
a fucking memory card,

22
00:01:17,281 --> 00:01:21,990
some 60 fucking four gig memory card.
I stick it in.

23
00:01:21,991 --> 00:01:26,820
This thing's fucking little slot there.
Turned it on.

24
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:31,080
It says, do you want to format
the card? Why? Yes, I would.

25
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:35,580
Handy fucking recorder of h
four n Zoom Douche, right?

26
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,050
How child does,
she says right now,

27
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:42,510
try not to be mad at an inanimate
object as Joe de Rosa says.

28
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:47,880
Um, but I am. So I put it in there
and it says error can't do it.

29
00:01:47,881 --> 00:01:52,020
And then I go on the internet wasting
more fucking time of my life. Oh,

30
00:01:52,021 --> 00:01:53,790
you technology douche bags out there.

31
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:56,490
Who just think that this stuff
makes your life easier. It doesn't,

32
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:00,090
it doesn't cause it's constantly
fucking breaking down.

33
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,370
And then I got to go on the Internet
and I got to try and figure out what the

34
00:02:05,371 --> 00:02:10,270
hell's going on, do you know, shifting
through all this, this horse shit.

35
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:13,850
And, uh, I found something and I followed
it to the t and it still says it's,

36
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:17,370
it's that there's a problem.
So what do I have to do?

37
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,290
I'm in New York City right now,
by the way,

38
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:23,280
I'm going to have to somehow
get in touch with Bobby Kelly

39
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,960
and I'm going to flip the
fuck out screaming about
tech. This is what happens.

40
00:02:29,961 --> 00:02:32,780
Is this help Bobby Kelly helps you
with technology. I call him up.

41
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:36,950
I immediately go on a rant about
technology and the banking system.

42
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,010
He sits back and relaxes,
you know,

43
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:43,730
probably has the phone like 20 feet
from his ear. And when I'm done ranting,

44
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,210
you know,
he'll just sit there and be like,

45
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,420
I did what's a product game? But
what do you, what do you have?

46
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,870
And I'll make this fucking piece of shit,
so fuck if it did do,

47
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:59,860
is that a piece of shit? Dude is actually,
I've had that thing is fucking great.

48
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,010
I

49
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:04,720
get the new one, it's fucking
wireless. Um, and then he talks to me,

50
00:03:04,721 --> 00:03:07,810
fucking throw it,
you know?

51
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:11,350
And what kills me is I like to think
that I'm just as smart as Robert Kelly,

52
00:03:11,351 --> 00:03:14,740
but evidently I'm not,
he never comes to me for help,

53
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:17,590
but I think that's cause he's,
he's afraid.

54
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:19,960
He's afraid of the feelings
that he has for me.

55
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,140
So anyways, I don't even know
how to adjust these levels.

56
00:03:25,141 --> 00:03:27,330
I hope I'm not blowing out
you fucking ear drums here.

57
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,010
MMM.

58
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:30,831
Anyways,

59
00:03:30,831 --> 00:03:33,530
you know what was funny about all of
this once I was going to make fun of this

60
00:03:33,531 --> 00:03:36,740
kid who was having problems
downloading my special,

61
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,740
you know, and this is basically, you know,

62
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:44,800
fortunately I've had a nice steady stream
of people downloading my special and

63
00:03:45,081 --> 00:03:45,914
I'm,

64
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:51,040
I swear to God for every like 50 75
people that downloaded successfully,

65
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,260
there'll be one person that has a problem.
I get right back to them. You know,

66
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,620
usually that day,
if not within two to three days,

67
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,210
I get back to them as soon as I can.

68
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,990
We get them a new link and they
get the special. All right.

69
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:11,450
And I've actually learned a lot about
myself reading some of these emails

70
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:14,450
because the amount of people
who immediately assume

71
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:20,180
that they're getting fucked let
basically that I'm fucking them over.

72
00:04:20,181 --> 00:04:23,150
Which you know, like I, I basic,

73
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:28,240
I announced that I have this special to
download for $5 and once I get your $5,

74
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,850
my game plan is there really is no link.

75
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:36,700
Okay.

76
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,310
Like how long can I
realistically get away with that?

77
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,560
Maybe for a week before all
you guys talk to each other,

78
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:47,260
just like there's no link.
He's just stealing $5 from us.

79
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:52,530
At which point I would become the
biggest douche on the Internet and no one

80
00:04:52,631 --> 00:04:55,600
would come to my shows and I would
go back to sleeping on a futon.

81
00:04:55,601 --> 00:04:57,190
So why would I do that?

82
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:01,900
But what cracks me up is I
understand the anger as you can tell.

83
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:07,450
I'm sure there's somebody out there who
has a zoom h four n handy recorder and

84
00:05:07,451 --> 00:05:10,270
knows exactly,
you know what to fucking buttons to hit.

85
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,160
And my whole world would be perfect.

86
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,293
MMM.

87
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:18,320
I have to tell you, it is an
unbelievably confusing fucking device.

88
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,311
This is definitely,

89
00:05:19,311 --> 00:05:22,850
this has to be some pro level shit cause
they did not dumb it down for someone

90
00:05:22,851 --> 00:05:25,790
like myself. So anyways,
getting back to the, um,

91
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:31,430
getting back to the, uh, the downloads.
Okay. If you are having problems, okay,

92
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:34,910
the link does work. Okay. Admittedly,

93
00:05:34,911 --> 00:05:38,510
a couple times there has been a
glitch on our end and we go out,

94
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,940
we fix it immediately.
You will get a link.

95
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:44,500
I'm not trying to fuck
you over if you for,

96
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,430
if you are just like,

97
00:05:46,431 --> 00:05:48,890
well it didn't work the first time
and I don't feel like waiting.

98
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:53,420
I want my $5 back. I will, I will
absolutely refund your money.

99
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,330
You're not going to get fucked.
Okay.

100
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,430
You're not going to get
fucked out of your money. You,

101
00:05:58,431 --> 00:06:01,040
they're going to get the special. Are
you going to get your $5 back? So,

102
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,553
mmm.

103
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:04,470
I Dunno.

104
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:08,070
But I've actually learned a lot about
myself watching people having meltdowns

105
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:12,960
about these things. This one
kid wrote me today, he goes,

106
00:06:12,961 --> 00:06:17,961
I would like my money back from my
purchase of your special on January 25th,

107
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:22,260
2013. I never had a chance to see this
special and I am deeply outraged by the

108
00:06:22,261 --> 00:06:24,540
horrible quality of your customer service.

109
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:27,300
Please return my $5 to
my checking account.

110
00:06:27,301 --> 00:06:31,380
Immediately sound like Jesus Christ did
I miss this guy. So I look up his email.

111
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:34,500
It's fucking hilarious. I've already
talked to the guy three times.

112
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:39,060
He got the initial link and we sent them
to more links and he hasn't been able

113
00:06:39,061 --> 00:06:42,900
to download it. Okay. I
got back to him every time,

114
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:45,300
either that day or within 24 hours

115
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:51,630
and now he asked for his $5 back and
I gave it back to him within like 45

116
00:06:51,631 --> 00:06:56,130
minutes to him asking for, all right,
I understand you're upset or dude,

117
00:06:56,131 --> 00:06:59,610
but how was that horrible
customer service?

118
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:04,380
Now if you want to say it's a horrible
link, you know, that's one thing.

119
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:07,360
My customer service,
I'm going to pat myself on the backyard.

120
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:11,220
I think it's pretty fucking good. I
wouldn't say it's outstanding. All right.

121
00:07:11,221 --> 00:07:14,190
I'm not trying to get trashed by other
consumers are going to send me emails,

122
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,020
but I'm just saying all right.

123
00:07:16,021 --> 00:07:19,050
Sometimes it does take me like three
days to get back to you. But you know,

124
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:24,040
I've running a mom and pop operation here.
I got to fly to fucking uh,

125
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:26,250
east bumped fucks to do is
show, you know, that day,

126
00:07:26,251 --> 00:07:29,850
maybe I'm not looking at my emails,
but I will get back to all right?

127
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:33,150
And then a whole,
there's been thousands of people,

128
00:07:33,151 --> 00:07:38,130
thank God who downloaded
my special successfully. So
the link is fine. All right.

129
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:40,740
I sent the guy let it
back. I told him, I said,

130
00:07:40,741 --> 00:07:45,741
till we got back to you every time you
emailed us and I just gave you $5 back.

131
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:49,170
How was that horrible customer service?
I don't know what to tell you.

132
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,300
What more am I supposed to do?

133
00:07:51,301 --> 00:07:54,690
Fly to where you live and stare
at your computer with your,

134
00:07:54,691 --> 00:07:56,070
God knows I can't figure it out.

135
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,900
This guys deeply outraged over $5.

136
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,000
Thank God my special wasn't 20 bucks.

137
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,950
Like I wasn't selling
like a hard copy of it.

138
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:09,640
This guy probably hunt
me down and shoot me. Oh,

139
00:08:09,641 --> 00:08:11,340
speaking of shooting people,

140
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:17,670
how about that fucking Cyborg allegedly
shot his woman through the fucking

141
00:08:17,671 --> 00:08:22,590
bathroom door. Jesus Christ. Huh?

142
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:26,580
What a fucking creepy story
that is. You know, it's funny,

143
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:31,640
as I was sitting here today
flipping out about the zoom h four,

144
00:08:32,191 --> 00:08:35,610
this is like the anti commercial
for this thing, h four and recorder,

145
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:40,080
if you're stupid, please do not buy this
thing because you'll end up like me.

146
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,650
And I'm really trying to,
uh,

147
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:47,950
it's rosy used to have this joke about
him flipping out at a laptop and somebody

148
00:08:48,691 --> 00:08:52,100
saw him and said, hey, that's an inanimate
object. You're better than that. But Bob,

149
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,480
blah, blah blah. So I, I,

150
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,440
for some last night I was flipping
about stepping out about how my internet

151
00:08:58,441 --> 00:09:03,090
sucks in New York and how, because I
was so mad at the Internet connection,

152
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,730
I actually had the urge to grab my laptop,

153
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
a completely innocent bystander and just
fucking like sort of like a combination

154
00:09:11,731 --> 00:09:15,450
of a Frisbee in a disgust and I
wanted to throw it through my window

155
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:24,500
rather than using my brain
and sitting down, um,

156
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:25,840
or maybe,
uh,

157
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,070
just solving the problem.

158
00:09:28,071 --> 00:09:31,580
Maybe just calling up and canceling the
wireless service and getting that little

159
00:09:31,581 --> 00:09:33,080
fucking, uh, what do you call it?

160
00:09:33,081 --> 00:09:36,770
The Internet stokey that you can
stick into the side of your computer.

161
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,680
So you have internet everywhere.

162
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:44,000
That Bobby Kelly shit dead
like an internet everywhere.

163
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:48,140
I stick the stick in. I put
on my little ear piece, dude,

164
00:09:48,141 --> 00:09:51,200
it's all fucking wireless.
It orders me a sandwich.

165
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:56,060
Yeah. Um, anyways,

166
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:01,520
the fuck was I talking about, you
know that guy actually I, I made,

167
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,220
I made a bad move the other day.
I asked,

168
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,490
I called Bobby Kelly up and I
told them I needed a new printer

169
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:14,240
and you kick someone like me cannot talk
to a guy like on Bobby Kelly's level of

170
00:10:14,241 --> 00:10:19,220
technology. Okay. Because all of
my shit is from like, you know,

171
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:23,480
three presidents ago. All
right. I don't like technology.

172
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:28,490
Um, as far as I don't
like new technology. Okay.

173
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:32,060
I would be happy.
I was happy with,

174
00:10:32,061 --> 00:10:36,530
my life was in the 80s and I didn't
have a laptop or cell phone. I was fine.

175
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:39,710
I don't know about you guys,
but I was eating three times a day.

176
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,480
I had a roof over my head,

177
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,960
you know,
I had a carburetor,

178
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,970
I had no fuel injection and I was fine.
My car couldn't talk to me.

179
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:56,670
I didn't have any GPS Cya. Oh, I had
a map. It's not like an old man here,

180
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:57,840
but my life was fine

181
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:03,210
when I say I don't like technologies for
all the Douche bags already firing up

182
00:11:03,211 --> 00:11:06,990
your email. Really would you like
to go back to the caveman days?

183
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:10,920
You know what I'm saying? Past a certain
point, the shit hasn't been helping me.

184
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:13,483
Okay.

185
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,440
Right up to cure polio and penicillin
right there. We should have,

186
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:19,550
we should just walked away
from the Black Jack Table.

187
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:22,310
We should have left it at that,
you know,

188
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:27,440
and then all we would have had to have
done is just dealt with the population

189
00:11:27,441 --> 00:11:31,400
problem in that you just keep it in check.
Okay.

190
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:34,850
You get one of these mathematical
fucking nerds, God bless him.

191
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,010
And we just have a number of that.
We will not go beyond.

192
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:45,090
Okay. And, and you know, in
a, in an imperfect world, um,

193
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:48,590
everybody could join hands and we would
all work together and there would be no

194
00:11:48,591 --> 00:11:50,210
countries,
but that's not the way it is

195
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:56,770
because the sociopath hungry sociopaths
and fucking religious psychopaths.

196
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:00,600
Yeah.

197
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,380
Okay. If you could eliminate those two
people, those two groups of people,

198
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,473
you know,

199
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:12,580
people who take the Hocus pocus shit too
seriously and then those, those fucking,

200
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:14,460
yeah,

201
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:18,690
those, those people who will do
anything. We'll fucking do anything.

202
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:19,591
You know,

203
00:12:19,591 --> 00:12:22,740
the only feeling they feel as the Russia
of putting their foot on somebody's

204
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,600
neck. If you could just get
rid of those two people.

205
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,060
I was kid who we'd look at us,
look at us on the Internet.

206
00:12:27,061 --> 00:12:29,520
There's a wave of trash.
Each other probably still
wouldn't work, but whatever.

207
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:30,600
This is my utopia.

208
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:37,210
I think we should have tapped
out somewhere around like, um,

209
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,790
I dunno, when did the first
Atari come out? You've got
to have video games, right?

210
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,410
Asteroids with spray and you guys,
whatever, you get bored with it.

211
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:53,240
But yeah, they'd come up with a new
asteroids maybe that maybe the, the,

212
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,720
the ship would be shaped like a square.

213
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:00,640
Maybe the rocks were like hexagon.
No rocks where hexagons.

214
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,830
Well you just make the space spaceship,

215
00:13:02,831 --> 00:13:06,570
the shape of the asteroids and then the
asteroids, the shape of the space ship,

216
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:11,050
new spaceship shaped asteroids and we all,

217
00:13:11,051 --> 00:13:14,110
we all would have been excited cause we
didn't know any better because we didn't

218
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:17,590
know there was a bad, a battlefield earth
part for whatever the fuck it's called.

219
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,710
Have you video guys are doing there?

220
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,690
I don't even want to say it's one even
so Bobby tells me to get this fucking,

221
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:29,050
I call up Bobby Kelly who Bobby is like,

222
00:13:29,051 --> 00:13:31,330
you know when I go to Bob's
pops apartment or whatever,

223
00:13:31,331 --> 00:13:35,650
it's like walking in my world. It's like
walking like nine years into the future.

224
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,160
You don't remember when it Yankee
Stadium first came out and they were all

225
00:13:39,161 --> 00:13:39,941
arrogant going,

226
00:13:39,941 --> 00:13:44,941
we have 2013 technology in 2009
and when they said that shit,

227
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,620
which really was the dumbest thing
ever, it's like no. If you had,

228
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:56,040
you have 2009 technology that is not
going to be available to a nerd like me.

229
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,130
Not a nerd,

230
00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:01,930
a loser like me until 2013 you're really
just sort of rubbing it in my face.

231
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:04,163
All right.

232
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,130
Of course I'll Yankee fans safe,
but oh,

233
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:13,170
they got tech doll with chief
problem of future Derek Jeter,

234
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,133
right?

235
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:24,070
Oh, it's your fucking Yankee Jersey
that you can't button anymore.

236
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:25,973
MMM.

237
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:30,980
Anyways, what am I talking
about here? Oh, so Bobby,

238
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,270
Bobby's like nine years in the future
compared to me. So he gets me this.

239
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,710
I get this fucking thing right?

240
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:40,270
Fucking wireless did everything. Bobby
has has to be wireless, you know,

241
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,460
it's fucking where they stayed. I
think I can drive in a cat, dude.

242
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:48,340
And I just think of something.
It's, it's wired into my brain.

243
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:53,150
A little heavy. It
prints it out, dude. Um,

244
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:58,980
so I get this thing, of course,
this fucking goddamn thing.

245
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:04,590
I've probably used it 20 times, 17 times.
I've had a fucking problem with it.

246
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:08,240
One time for no reason.
I would,

247
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:13,300
I would hit print and it would go through
the entire stack of paper that I had

248
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,740
printing, nothing, just printing
hell high. He had whole hat,

249
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:23,530
he had whole hat and I'm going, what
the fuck's going on? [inaudible] he had.

250
00:15:23,531 --> 00:15:28,040
Right. And then finally the
last two pages, it would
just print a bunch of code.

251
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,010
And you know,
I don't give a fuck.

252
00:15:31,011 --> 00:15:33,820
Just at some point in
that five minute exercise,

253
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:38,250
fucking print when I've tried to print,
never does it.

254
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:43,630
So then I got called Bobby up.
Bob, this fucking predecessor did.

255
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,230
It doesn't set date.
What's, just tell me what,

256
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:51,970
go into properties or whatever.
Click on the apple gate.

257
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:53,210
Okay.

258
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:58,010
And I'm on the phone for like 45 minutes.
I liked my old printer.

259
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,130
It had a wire,

260
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:05,990
it was tethered to reality and I plugged
it into my fucking laptop. You know,

261
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:10,280
I like that real shit. And I'm
like, it's in the air, man.

262
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:14,510
I don't know what's going on. I can't
figure that shit out. So anyways,

263
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,170
I don't know what the fuck are
we even talking about here?

264
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:22,700
I wonder what am I really saying? Why
can't it stuff be easy? Why can't stuff,

265
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:26,120
what I really want is for nothing to
change so I don't have to learn anything

266
00:16:26,121 --> 00:16:29,780
new. I think that's what I'm
really trying to say here. MMM.

267
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:35,120
I don't know. I'm going to talk about New
York City here in second. Yeah. Once I,

268
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:35,973
uh,

269
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:40,160
let's do a couple of
advertisements really quickly.

270
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:44,850
I can get Jesus.
Oh,

271
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:48,380
Jesus then rubs with tonight.
Oh, no. You know what?

272
00:16:48,381 --> 00:16:53,060
I'm actually going out to Hasbrook
heights. We want to benefit. All right.

296
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:11,430
um,
saw back in New York City right now.

297
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:17,370
I immediately went from absolute paradise
as far as weather goes, you know,

298
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:21,960
not as far as population and
breathable air drinkable water,

299
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:27,090
but the weather's great.
And I came in in New York and uh,

300
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:32,930
you know, I actually really
fucking enjoy cold weather. And,

301
00:18:32,931 --> 00:18:36,390
um, the only thing that sucks
was it snowed like five days ago.

302
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,990
So when it first snows,
it's, it's beautiful.

303
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:45,330
It's like a newborn baby. Just gorgeous.
Everywhere you go, looks like a postcard,

304
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:49,980
but you know, three, four days later
it's just a, you know, you think you're,

305
00:18:49,981 --> 00:18:53,600
you're an eastern fucking Europe and
that's what it looks like right now. Uh,

306
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:56,690
it's kind of a nice sunny day, but
I gotta be honest with you. Um,

307
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:01,200
if you're past the age of 40 and
you're still dealing with winters,

308
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:05,570
I just want you to know that there
are options. You know what? No, no.

309
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,281
You know what,
keep,

310
00:19:06,281 --> 00:19:10,630
keep living in the last thing when he was
more fucking people. Ellen, it's great.

311
00:19:10,631 --> 00:19:15,490
You know, you get the four seasons, you
know, one and a half of them are nice.

312
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,680
I like it.
You know what I like to change of seasons.

313
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:26,670
Do you have any idea what it's like to
just fucking just wake up every day and

314
00:19:26,711 --> 00:19:31,090
the weather is awesome. It's awesome.
And I know what he's [inaudible], dude,

315
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,860
you've got to lose your edge. That's
how fucked up east coast people are.

316
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,790
We're afraid that we're
going to lose our anger.

317
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,980
Hey, you're going to lose your
edge. He ate. But be careful.

318
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:49,180
You might end up being happy.
You might end up, uh, you know,

319
00:19:49,181 --> 00:19:53,290
enjoying your life. Go easy. Now. I mean,

320
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:57,400
when I first moved out to la the first
time I was out there when I hated it and

321
00:19:57,401 --> 00:20:02,401
this didn't seem right and I fought it
so hard to not to try and not enjoy it,

322
00:20:03,341 --> 00:20:04,174
but I did.

323
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:11,150
I played a roller hockey on the day of
the Superbowl in shorts and a tee shirt

324
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:16,900
in this parking garage. It's the
90s. Okay, let's go fuck yourself.

325
00:20:16,901 --> 00:20:20,500
And it was roller hockey. I wasn't skating
down the boardwalk in a fanny pack,

326
00:20:20,501 --> 00:20:23,890
but, uh, if footage of me
doing that does surface,

327
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:30,590
I would love to say that it was
somehow Photoshop for the record.

328
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:34,780
I never had a fanny pack,
but not because, um,

329
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:39,380
I didn't like him.
I just found I just,

330
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:41,440
okay.

331
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,970
I wanted pockets. I just, I don't
like shit on me, you know what I mean?

332
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,240
I just,
I don't like it.

333
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:53,470
Then it makes you a waste sweaty that
wherever the fanny is fanny pack a pack is

334
00:20:53,471 --> 00:20:57,640
on the fanny pack that's going to get all
sweaty. I don't fucking like, you know,

335
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:02,260
I used to put the money in my sock
and then my keys and my other songs.

336
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,990
I used to be that guy, you know. Anyways,

337
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:08,410
so I'm playing roller hockey
at the top of his fucking uh,

338
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:15,190
uh, parking garage. The
houses, me, Dane Cook,

339
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:21,010
Rick Dolly and Pete coming right for
two, one, two fucking psycho gay.

340
00:21:21,011 --> 00:21:26,011
We had where it was like zero to zero
and we were all such competitive maniacs.

341
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,410
This is back before Tiva.

342
00:21:29,411 --> 00:21:33,190
We almost missed the beginning of the
Superbowl because we had to play until

343
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:36,430
somebody one or maybe it was one to one.
You know,

344
00:21:36,431 --> 00:21:38,950
when you don't have that official
clock or anything, it was foods,

345
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:42,850
the fucking shit. And we will laugh
and just go like, my buddy was going,

346
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:46,360
who loved La. I was like,
dude, we're gonna watch the
Superbowl. How nuts is this?

347
00:21:46,361 --> 00:21:50,020
Everybody back east is freezing their
fucking balls off route here in the sun.

348
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,170
Play roller hockey on top
of this parking structure,

349
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:57,700
hoping the security doesn't come up here.
And I was buying into that whole, um,

350
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:01,810
and losing my edge. Man,
I'm not going to be funny,

351
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:06,370
but meanwhile la is one of the most
difficult cities I've ever had to live in

352
00:22:06,371 --> 00:22:11,371
just as far as getting from point a to
point B and also trying to keep you your

353
00:22:11,891 --> 00:22:14,000
head screwed on because um,

354
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,530
it's a fun place when you're working.

355
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,490
That's all I can tell you
when you're not working. Uh,

356
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:23,560
and if you are out there right
now and you're struggling,

357
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:25,750
I definitely don't be
afraid to have a hobby.

358
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:29,920
Don't be afraid to have something that
you can actually fucking look forward to

359
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:34,480
that will actually help you. You know,
some of these psychos out there that 24,

360
00:22:34,481 --> 00:22:38,800
seven, I gotta be about the
business. Hey, you want to a, hey,

361
00:22:38,801 --> 00:22:42,170
here's a free cupcake. Would you like a
cupcake? And I am like, can I expect him?

362
00:22:42,171 --> 00:22:43,010
You got to get the skip them.

363
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:48,670
Who turns down a free cupcake has kind
of greed when man to another man. Huh?

364
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,810
Um, anyway, so I'm back
here in New York and uh,

365
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:57,490
I dunno, it's weird. I love New
York, but I just don't miss it.

366
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:01,110
I always thought I would miss it, but
I don't miss it. I woke up a fucking,

367
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:05,860
God knows what time this morning,
a holiday, backyard area.

368
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:08,690
It is president's Day of
some shit and some assholes.

369
00:23:08,691 --> 00:23:13,290
It's got his fucking stereo on like two
floors down. One of those Douche bags.

370
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:18,700
Um, status is probably, music is my life.

371
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:20,710
Music is the air.
I believe.

372
00:23:20,711 --> 00:23:24,700
Something trite that they're trying to
make original and whatever the fuck it is.

373
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,333
Um,

374
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:31,210
life equals music is fucking
play in his God. Damn.

375
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,580
I'm going to say stereo because I don't
know what the kids call into explaining

376
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:38,500
his fucking stereo from two floors down.

377
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:42,850
I'm hearing this guy the baseline
of his ship and you know, I just,

378
00:23:42,851 --> 00:23:47,360
I just don't miss it.
This is basically,

379
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:51,980
I live in a big house with
like, you know, 700 strangers.

380
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:56,750
I got a smelly a food. I got to
hear their arguments. You know,

381
00:23:56,751 --> 00:23:59,740
you always got some sorta
is always somebody you know,

382
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:03,620
some old person who's been living there
since like the fucking sixties who's

383
00:24:03,621 --> 00:24:07,370
paid $3 a month in rent and you
walk by their fucking place.

384
00:24:07,371 --> 00:24:11,510
Everybody's making some sort of Goulash
and the combination of that and the

385
00:24:11,511 --> 00:24:15,650
fucking heater that they can adjust
for some reason and it's 9,000 degrees.

386
00:24:15,651 --> 00:24:19,340
He combination of that and smelling that
Goulash and had douche play his stereo.

387
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:22,940
I just, I don't fucking miss it. Then
I got to walk out, look at dirty snow.

388
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:27,410
I've had it. I was like,
Oh yeah, I remember this.

389
00:24:27,411 --> 00:24:30,650
And then there's that when it's getting
spring in New York was beautiful.

390
00:24:30,651 --> 00:24:32,630
Fall in New York is great summers.

391
00:24:32,631 --> 00:24:37,190
Cool for about two seconds
before the humidity comes
in. All the fucking crooked,

392
00:24:37,191 --> 00:24:39,230
rich [inaudible] slash.
Celebrities,

393
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:43,430
they all go out to the Hamptons to go
fucking air off their balls and we got to

394
00:24:43,431 --> 00:24:47,990
sit here taking the goddamned subway
and all office. It's the worst,

395
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:53,560
the fucking worst. So, um, uh,

396
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,630
I think I'm just grumpy.
I still liked New York,

397
00:24:56,631 --> 00:24:59,300
but it was kind of disturbing how
much I'm sitting here going like, hey,

398
00:24:59,301 --> 00:25:03,730
this is a, this is really
no way to live. You know,

399
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:08,270
I said this before in New
York. It's for young people,
you know, up to about 35, 36.

400
00:25:08,271 --> 00:25:11,750
You can have a great fucking time. Those
last four years is just sliding into 40.

401
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,210
Don't fight that feeling that says,
hey,

402
00:25:14,211 --> 00:25:18,930
why don't we get out of here and live like
a human being, you know, fuck the two,

403
00:25:18,931 --> 00:25:23,210
one, two area code. You can visit it,
drop in and visit it. Go out to jersey,

404
00:25:23,211 --> 00:25:26,920
go to upstate New York, whatever the
fuck in Westchester. It yourself,

405
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:30,230
a house and a driveway.
All right.

406
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:34,190
The only time you smelled Goulash,
if yours is, if you're making it,

407
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:39,170
you're human being deserve to
live like one, uh, anyways,

408
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:43,670
plowing ahead here. Uh, on the
podcast, where am I up to here?

409
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:50,210
This is oddly cruising right along, but
I can't find the numbers for 25 minutes.

410
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:55,970
Was it wrong? Um, I had
a great week this week,

411
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:59,510
this past week.
I've got to do the Conan O'brien show.

412
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:02,550
We'll have the link for that up on,
uh,

413
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:07,760
up on a Monday morning podcast page.
Um,

414
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:11,370
Conan's great. You know,
when you get going,

415
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,850
he chimes in and once you get
going and just let you go.

416
00:26:13,851 --> 00:26:17,930
He's totally old school and if he
thinks you're funny, he laughs. It's a,

417
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:22,160
it really is that old
school Johnny Carson style.

418
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:23,390
And uh,

419
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:28,160
I'm getting more and more comfortable
doing those panel things and I get a real

420
00:26:28,161 --> 00:26:31,760
kick out of doing it because
that was sort of, that was,

421
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:36,230
that's sort of a lost art amongst
comedians just for the simple fact that we

422
00:26:36,231 --> 00:26:40,790
haven't gotten the opportunities to do it.
Where back in the day,

423
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:44,520
I guess there was less opportunities.
Maybe it balances out the fact of the day.

424
00:26:44,521 --> 00:26:47,730
Johnny Carson, you know, he had his go to,

425
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,270
he would have comics on and they,
they weren't promoting anything.

426
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,520
He would just have them on because
they were, they were a great guest.

427
00:26:54,521 --> 00:26:56,820
They come on and he knew that
they were going to hit a home run.

428
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,593
MMM.

429
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:03,520
And I used to grow up watching these
guys, David Brenner, George Gobel, um,

430
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:04,600
all these guys.
And I would,

431
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:08,200
I would be psyched when they were
on and they'd come on Buddy Hackett,

432
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:13,000
they just come on and tell stories.
They weren't promoting anything.

433
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:14,320
They were just hilarious.

434
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:19,390
And he'd watched Johnny laughing his
ass off and it went right through

435
00:27:19,391 --> 00:27:24,340
Letterman. Leno, uh, are some of
the other guys I saw. But then,

436
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:27,670
I dunno,
once this talk show stuff became so

437
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:32,020
well back then, he was the only
game in town. So there wasn't,

438
00:27:32,021 --> 00:27:34,630
it's not the way it is now
where there's like 20 shows.

439
00:27:34,631 --> 00:27:37,870
I'll try and get this tape a piece
of the same pie. But anyways,

440
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:39,893
uh,

441
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,080
there was something,
I always wanted him to get good at it.

442
00:27:43,081 --> 00:27:47,220
So I was really sucked
at my, it went well, uh,

443
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:53,490
this past Monday. It's just something
that I, I want to get better at. And,

444
00:27:53,491 --> 00:27:54,930
uh, I just, I dunno,

445
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:57,990
it was just like the cool thing that
for awhile comics just really weren't

446
00:27:57,991 --> 00:28:00,030
getting that opportunity
or not enough of them.

447
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:03,510
We're getting that opportunity
and it was frustrating.

448
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,820
I'm not saying it's all
actors and all guests,

449
00:28:06,821 --> 00:28:10,750
but to sit there at home
and watch people coming out,

450
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:12,430
we put and tell the fucking story.

451
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,030
But they had a giant movie,

452
00:28:16,031 --> 00:28:20,110
which I understand they got to
promote the giant movie. I Dunno.

453
00:28:20,111 --> 00:28:22,000
I just would always look at
that and be like, you know,

454
00:28:22,001 --> 00:28:26,170
it would be great right now.
Now that that person Kinda did only okay.

455
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:29,590
And the hosts had to work their ass
off to help them through the segment.

456
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:33,640
If you just had a comment,
come on, tell some stories,

457
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:38,440
and the host could take a
little fucking breather. Uh,

458
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:42,700
it's just great. I Dunno. It's just great
that Conan is doing that type of thing.

459
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:43,873
MMM.

460
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,380
And you know, it was funny. As
a comic you always like, man,

461
00:28:47,381 --> 00:28:49,810
I want to do those things,
those five minutes sets.

462
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:51,160
It's like playing Russian roulette.

463
00:28:51,161 --> 00:28:55,540
I'd rather just go out and you just to
watch somebody do panel and you think

464
00:28:55,541 --> 00:28:57,750
it's fucking easy and then all of a
sudden you had have to do panel and you're

465
00:28:57,751 --> 00:29:01,060
like, oh my God, what if I'm
sitting there bombing? Uh,

466
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:03,880
I had a nice panic attack before it
went out there right before when I was

467
00:29:03,881 --> 00:29:06,710
standing behind the curtain. I
was just like that, why am I here?

468
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:10,280
I have nothing to talk about.
Blah Blah Blah. But uh,

469
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:15,650
fortunately it worked out. I did that.
And then I have an episode of that show,

470
00:29:15,651 --> 00:29:17,930
the new girl coming up,
I'll let you guys know.

471
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,920
I finally decided I'm actually going to
tell you what I'm doing as opposed to

472
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:24,400
keep,
I think I've worn out that a

473
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,290
bleed joke at this point.

474
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:32,840
And I actually got to work with
Nick Kroll, who I tell you,

475
00:29:32,841 --> 00:29:36,560
that guy was one of the silliest,
funniest motherfuckers I ever worked with.

476
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,590
The whole cast was awesome.
And,

477
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:43,990
but nit for all that dude
is out of his fucking mind.

478
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:48,610
And uh, I don't think I've
laughed that hard. You know,

479
00:29:48,611 --> 00:29:53,560
it's a one camera shoot. So you're
doing like 12 hour days and it's like,

480
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:56,860
uh, you like a Zombie. You know?

481
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,650
I actually still like doing those things.

482
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:02,890
I started to understand why my
dog sleeps all day, you know?

483
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:06,400
And it's basically because he has nothing
to fucking do. She has nothing to do.

484
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:08,920
And if you have nothing to do
with your brain's just like okay,

485
00:30:08,921 --> 00:30:11,710
we don't have to think we're just going
to shut this down and you fall asleep.

486
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:15,700
And that's what was happening to me.
I was nodding off.

487
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:19,690
Cause like when you're shooting it,
it's the most exciting fucking thing ever.

488
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:23,380
And you feel like you could run a marathon
then I would turn it around or you're

489
00:30:23,381 --> 00:30:25,660
not in this next one,
you just sit down,

490
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,560
there's nothing to do.

491
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:33,670
Everything else is being handled and
you're just sitting there waiting for that

492
00:30:33,671 --> 00:30:36,550
to tell you where to stand to say
the stuff that they wrote. Right.

493
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:41,320
And in that time you just fucking
not off like a fucking dog.

494
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:46,360
Um, but anyways, I'm telling you man,

495
00:30:46,361 --> 00:30:47,500
check out the Kroll show.

496
00:30:47,501 --> 00:30:50,170
I got to hear and what I really
want to hide this show because I,

497
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:54,010
I think this guys,
I think he's absolutely fucking brilliant.

498
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:59,060
Um,
come on.

499
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:05,350
I'm the worst. I think it's on Wednesdays.
What happened? Oh, I know what happened.

500
00:31:05,351 --> 00:31:06,790
I had it up there and then my fucking

501
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:12,850
piece of shit reported in work or
another reality that recorded that works.

502
00:31:12,851 --> 00:31:15,000
But I can't figure out
how it works on a separate

503
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:21,610
row show you go call me central.com.

504
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:27,930
Nick Kroll show is new episodes
Wednesday at 10 39 30 central on,

505
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:32,780
uh,
on a comedy central.

506
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:36,290
He's absolutely fucking hilarious.
Uh,

507
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:40,020
and I really hope that show continues to
be a hit. Anyways. All right, there's the,

508
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,620
there's the hype to the week.
Let's get back to the podcast.

509
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:49,210
Hell that I want to talk
about. Oh, that meteor.

510
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,990
I'll fuck you.
Do you guys see some of the footage?

511
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:56,560
People got that thing just
appearing out of the sky.

512
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:00,910
Now there's somebody, somebody's going
to give me shit about technology. There

513
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:03,641
were back in the day,

514
00:32:03,641 --> 00:32:07,480
you had no idea it was even coming and
you would just out there a little fucked

515
00:32:07,481 --> 00:32:11,980
up a date, but the, but dab that through
doing whatever the fuck he did back then.

516
00:32:11,981 --> 00:32:15,280
Right. And all of a sudden this thing just
comes out of the sky. I mean, honestly,

517
00:32:15,281 --> 00:32:16,840
if that thing falls into your house,
she had dead.

518
00:32:16,841 --> 00:32:21,300
But I was amazed at the amount of people,
right. Who are out driving around. Um,

519
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,580
I was driving around,

520
00:32:24,581 --> 00:32:27,730
I would've looked like ray Liotta in
the second half of good fellas when he's

521
00:32:27,731 --> 00:32:29,470
all coked up looking for that helicopter.

522
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:34,750
That would have been me trying
to get my ass to a shelter. Uh,

523
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:39,280
is it, is it agreed upon at this
point that that's how the dinosaurs

524
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:44,240
died off? Was that a giant media
or is that still just a theory?

525
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:49,130
Even though they probably found the
crater and proved it, but the fucking old,

526
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:53,390
the AVH people refuse to
believe it because somehow
that fucks with the Adam and

527
00:32:53,391 --> 00:32:54,224
Eve story.

528
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:58,490
How exactly has the church
worked in dinosaurs and all that.

529
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,400
Adam and eve,

530
00:33:01,401 --> 00:33:05,870
they were together and they were
living in a paradise and uh,

531
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,180
they started the human race.

532
00:33:08,181 --> 00:33:11,090
Forget about the incestuous
consequences of that math.

533
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:16,100
We'll just say it was those two and they
were both white yet somehow they was

534
00:33:16,101 --> 00:33:19,250
all these different races of people.
Uh,

535
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:24,230
I don't even know if
that even makes sense.

536
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:27,500
How do different races and people come
about? You know what's funny that's like,

537
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:30,980
that's a great question to ask when
you're in a bar with someone with no

538
00:33:30,981 --> 00:33:34,160
scientific or is it genetics?
Is that the word?

539
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:38,510
Maybe it just ask someone as dumb as
me. People are like, Oh, you know, uh,

540
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:39,021
it's just shit.

541
00:33:39,021 --> 00:33:44,021
I heard in bars like when I was growing
up that like people in Africa were,

542
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:49,400
uh, or Africans, I guess, if that's
an easier way to say it. I went,

543
00:33:49,401 --> 00:33:52,070
people in Africa instead of
say Africans the same way.

544
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:56,570
Everybody who plays basketball now says
the game of basketball rather than just

545
00:33:56,571 --> 00:33:59,950
saying basketball,
you know what,

546
00:33:59,951 --> 00:34:02,620
I'm out there playing the
game of basketball. You know,

547
00:34:02,621 --> 00:34:03,940
we started that Michael Jordan.

548
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,590
Somebody said it to him and he liked it
as far as I can tell them as far as my,

549
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:12,430
by watching ESPN and the NBA on Chibe Ash,

550
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,230
I think he was the first guy.

551
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:18,370
He's the guy who made it cool to say that
the game of basketball and these guys

552
00:34:18,371 --> 00:34:20,630
all grow up watching Michael
Jordan and they keep saying,

553
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:24,040
hearing him say the game of basketball.
Now all these motherfuckers,

554
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:30,080
they keep saying the game of basketball.
It's like this Yoda ship. You know?

555
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:32,460
I mean I,
I really don't,

556
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:35,520
I can't really do a reference to Yoda
cause I don't see that movie a couple of

557
00:34:35,521 --> 00:34:35,791
times.

558
00:34:35,791 --> 00:34:39,270
But I've seen a zillion comic Stewart
where you put the shift that usually comes

559
00:34:39,271 --> 00:34:42,420
last first. You know,
I don't fucking know,

560
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:45,240
but I'm really sick of hearing people
talk about the game of basketball.

561
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:50,880
But I am loving Lebron James saying that
he has the ability to become the best

562
00:34:50,881 --> 00:34:52,500
ever.
You know,

563
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:56,910
I am loving that he's saying that it's
just great to hear a guy who's going to

564
00:34:56,911 --> 00:34:58,110
try and go for that type of thing.

565
00:34:58,270 --> 00:35:00,900
And just the fact that he kind of used
to get a little tight at the end of the

566
00:35:00,901 --> 00:35:05,670
game. He's got, he's all the broadsoft
grown up, you know? And plus,

567
00:35:05,671 --> 00:35:09,570
because I hate Laker fans and I hate
Coby Bryant. I don't hate him personally,

568
00:35:09,571 --> 00:35:13,230
but you know, I just hate
all the Oh, by the way,

569

the rest of the teeth. You know,

time. What? Quack? Uh,

575
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:37,363
anyways,

576
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,510
there's nothing more a Celtic fans enjoys
more than watching Colby try and go

577
00:35:42,511 --> 00:35:47,490
for 60 points. Keeps you from Colby.
Three guys on you. You got it.

578
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:48,750
Turn around jumper,

579
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:55,950

582
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:10,080
sh now getting all fucking freaked
out about this stupid thing.

583
00:36:10,081 --> 00:36:12,840
Did I put that I put the wrong car
then and then I messed up that I,

584
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:16,560
if you put the wrong party and the thing
does that, does that mess up the uh,

585
00:36:16,561 --> 00:36:21,180
the brain on the thing?
Is that too technical a question?

586
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:25,130
Hey, you know, it's funny,
I sent out a tweet for, uh,

587
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:29,340
this guy and I was really
only for guitar players only,

588
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:35,850
but, um, just how, I don't
know the names of Shit.

589
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,810
This guy is going off on people who
don't know the different names of good,

590
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:43,950
good people, but what do you have a
maple neck or a rosewood neck? Hey,

591
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:48,300
the guy's going to be dumb motherfucker.
It, everybody's got a maple neck.

592
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,180
Oh,
both these next or maple.

593
00:36:51,181 --> 00:36:55,110
The fretboard fret board is Rosewood.

594
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:59,880
You've got to Rosewood Fret board,
not a neck. You dumb mother fucker.

595
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:04,230
And he's just sitting here going off
and he ends with the greatest. He goes,

596
00:37:04,231 --> 00:37:06,700
you know, half the people,
if you just played,

597
00:37:06,701 --> 00:37:10,740
you could tar half as much as you bitch.
You might be worth a fuck on the guitar.

598
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,670
I Dunno. It's tremendous. So anyways,
you probably like go. Hey Bill,

599
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:22,590
what are you doing? What
are you doing back in, uh,

600
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:27,090
in, uh, New York City.
I am a, I am back here.

601
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:31,590
I'm doing a couple of benefits tonight.
I'm at bananas in Hasbrouck Heights,

602
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:36,180
uh, doing a benefit for a
buddy of mine's wife, uh,

603
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:37,920
who's sick right now,

604
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:42,750
but he's turning the corner and then
Tuesday night we're going to have the,

605
00:37:42,751 --> 00:37:46,670
uh, the big Patrice O'Neil
benefit slash sendoff.

606
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:48,630
We're finally going to send them off,
right man.

607
00:37:48,631 --> 00:37:51,900
Like if this thing has been a long time
coming, it's going to be an insane night.

608
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,060
And uh,

609
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,250
I'm really psyched to see all the
guys who are going to be there and uh,

610
00:37:58,290 --> 00:38:03,090
it's definitely a good thing. And a,
there you go. That's why I'm here.

611
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:06,720
And then I'm going to go up to Boston
on Wednesday, going up to the Wilbur,

612
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:10,740
my big, uh, of course the Bruins are
out of town. They weren't in town.

613
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:14,600
I've been watching fucking
show, but um, all right.

614
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:17,690
Is it me or is it the podcast kind
of fucking went downhill, hasn't it?

615
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,410
It's Kinda, it's Kinda
dipped a little, let's,

616
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:25,890
let's get this back to get this back
on track. So fucking Versie knows.

617
00:38:25,891 --> 00:38:27,450
And I'm going to be in
Hasbrouck heights than nights.

618
00:38:27,451 --> 00:38:31,200
So you know what he tells me
he wants to go to white castle.

619
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:37,210
All right? You get a bunch of little
white castle burgers in a vanilla shake.

620
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:39,820
It goes, it's going to be epic.
And I'm not going to lie to you,

621
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,520
I'm not gonna to say that that is a great,
but the fact that verse,

622
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:46,180
He makes fun of New Jersey,
you know,

623
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:48,490
and this and this,
you know,

624
00:38:48,491 --> 00:38:53,491
going to white castle and getting a
vanilla shake is his idea of a great night

625
00:38:53,741 --> 00:38:58,490
out. I mean, Paul Versey, he's so jersey,

626
00:38:58,491 --> 00:39:00,080
his last name rhymes with it.

627
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,353
You know,

628
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:06,890
he's talking about going to this place,
like it's going to be a steakhouse.

629
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,800
And this is the thing, I'm white trash
too because I'm beyond excited to,

630
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:14,640
I want to fire down as many of
those burgers is quickly as I can.

631
00:39:14,641 --> 00:39:18,900
And the key is you got to eat them really
fast before your body ruins the fun

632
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,830
telling you to please stop doing it.

633
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:29,050
So if you're coming out to
bananas, Hasbrouck Heights
tonight, and about eight,

634
00:39:29,051 --> 00:39:33,520
nine minutes into my set, despite the
fact I'm leading on the mic stand,

635
00:39:33,521 --> 00:39:36,370
but I'm inexplicably sweating,
it's not because I'm nervous,

636
00:39:36,371 --> 00:39:37,480
it's going to be my body.

637
00:39:37,481 --> 00:39:42,481
Trying to is beginning to eliminate
the 9,000 calories of a trans fats.

638
00:39:44,741 --> 00:39:46,990
I just put my body, you know,
every once in a while you get,

639
00:39:46,991 --> 00:39:51,070
you've got to keep your body honest.
You know, I'm starting off great today.

640
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,810
I had a banana for breakfast.

641
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:56,140
I'm going to have an apple as a snack
and amount of a giant fucking salad,

642
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:01,750
old twinkle toes here, um, for
lunch. And then I'm throwing down.

643
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:06,010
That's how I do it. That's
my balanced diet. All right?

644
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,670
I eat like I teach yoga for
the first half of the day,

645
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,100
and John Wayne from five o'clock on,

646
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:17,800
hey, it's better than what I used to
do. I used to start off, you know,

647
00:40:17,801 --> 00:40:20,540
bacon and eggs and all that type of stuff.
Uh,

648
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,810
I know there's gonna be some people
out there going, hey, you know,

649
00:40:22,811 --> 00:40:26,710
there's nothing wrong with bacon and eggs.
I'm not saying there is all right,

650
00:40:26,711 --> 00:40:27,544
but you know,

651
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:32,590
listen for all you guys out there who
eat red meat and you want to say how you

652
00:40:32,591 --> 00:40:35,710
know all the, the, the good
things about it and everything,

653
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:40,180
but I'm right there with you.
I love eating a fucking steak,

654
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:41,411
okay?

655
00:40:41,411 --> 00:40:45,490
I drive by a pasture and I have all I can
do to not get out of the car and start

656
00:40:45,491 --> 00:40:49,750
nine on some cow's neck. All right?
Fucking disgusting. But it's true.

657
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,053
But look,

658
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:58,180
fuck all these diet books.
Go out and eat a giant goddamn salad.

659
00:40:58,181 --> 00:41:00,850
Don't drown in addressing.
All right?

660
00:41:00,851 --> 00:41:04,750
Go with the Balsamic vinegarette do that
three days in a row and you watch how

661
00:41:04,751 --> 00:41:08,380
well your body
operates,

662
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,383
okay?

663
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:16,670
You will be a finely tuned machine and
you can continue with your fucking chops

664
00:41:18,211 --> 00:41:22,750
and all that crap. Just eating one
giant leafy Greens. Valid a day.

665
00:41:22,751 --> 00:41:26,520
I'm telling you talent. And not
only that, it kind of, you know,

666
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:30,850
quells that sugar salt fucking arm wrestle
thing that you're doing the whole day.

667
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:34,850
It's really been helping me out and I
don't have to work out as much and I think

668
00:41:34,851 --> 00:41:37,250
that that's uh, that's really
the game plan, isn't it?

669
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:41,390
Don't you want to be in shape and
not really have to work out? Right.

670
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,320
Did I just become some sort of a,

671
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:45,890
I should have a headset on
right now and like doing that,

00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:08,300
I understand you usually
tackle relationship advice
in a way this pertains to

710
00:44:08,301 --> 00:44:11,000
our relationship with this, with our
country. No Dude, I would love to,

711
00:44:11,001 --> 00:44:15,500
I would love to answer conspiracy theory
shit. The only reason why I, you know,

712
00:44:15,501 --> 00:44:19,550
what it is, is people listen
every week and they start,

713
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:23,000
I should start throwing out more
topics through conspiracy theory.

714
00:44:23,001 --> 00:44:26,150
I'll always do the relationship stuff.
You want to talk sports,

715
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:28,290
anything you want to talk about.
Um,

716
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:31,890
I will answer the questions and all
you guys have to realize is I am not a

717
00:44:31,891 --> 00:44:34,290
fucking expert and I do not
know what I'm talking about.

718
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,530
All I'm trying to do is make you laugh
and make you drive to work a little

719
00:44:37,531 --> 00:44:42,250
shorter. That's all I'm doing
here. All right. Anyways, he says,

720
00:44:42,290 --> 00:44:44,640
in a way, this pertains to our
relationship with our country.

721
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:48,540
Every day we hear our bags and
governments getting away with crazy shit.

722
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:52,740
It's exhausting. I want to shut
down, ignore and ignore it all,

723
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:57,300
but that's what they want. Am I stopped
and I am a stubborn cunt, so fuck them.

724
00:44:57,330 --> 00:45:00,990
What do we do? Thanks.
Frustrated the son of a bitch.

725
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:04,600
Um, all right. When are we going?

726
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:06,660
When are we going to vote a
Joe Schmo in for president?

727
00:45:06,661 --> 00:45:09,750
That's never going to happen.
It's impossible to do.

728
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:14,400
We would all have to get organized and
the organ to organization to be able to

729
00:45:14,401 --> 00:45:16,690
do that.
Um,

730
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,280
they would figure out that we were doing
it and then they would figure out who

731
00:45:20,281 --> 00:45:22,840
was leading it and then that person would,
um,

732
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:27,720
somehow get shot by a lone gunman alone,
crazed gunman,

733
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:33,960
acer hand, Sir hand and Eddie, Eddie, you
know, somebody with a crazy fucking name,

734
00:45:33,961 --> 00:45:36,120
you know.
Um,

735
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:39,660
and let's just say for the,

736
00:45:39,690 --> 00:45:43,590
for the sake of argument that we
actually all got together secretively and

737
00:45:43,591 --> 00:45:46,960
nobody found out and we actually voted
a Joe Schmo and for president, uh,

738
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:51,090
nobody would work with them.
No one would work with them.

739
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:52,530
And He,

740
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:57,540
and it would be in every politician's
best interest to have that guy have the

741
00:45:57,541 --> 00:46:01,500
worst presidency ever. So they could all
look at the American people and be like,

742
00:46:01,501 --> 00:46:04,650
see what happens with the adult
vote Democrat or Republican?

743
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:08,370
They would just do that. I mean,
they don't even work with each other.

744
00:46:08,490 --> 00:46:13,050
If a republican gets in as
president and the house, Ooh,

745
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:17,700
I'm getting in over my head house, is that
what it's called? If that's democratic,

746
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:19,140
they won't work with that guy.

747
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:23,700
They spend every waking moment trying to
fuck over whatever that guy's trying to

748
00:46:23,701 --> 00:46:27,210
do. It's childish and vice
versa if I see versus are there.

749
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:28,770
So they don't even work with each other.

750
00:46:28,771 --> 00:46:32,180
Forget about some Joe Schmo
coming in as president. Um,

751
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:37,680
I would say what you have
to do is a ground up thing.

752
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:44,330
I would try to vote for the most honest
person you could as a local town.

753
00:46:45,571 --> 00:46:48,210
Selectman is a regional,
one of the,

754
00:46:48,211 --> 00:46:51,480
then they have like sort of regional
senators and then state senators and then

755
00:46:51,481 --> 00:46:53,820
like senators at a federal level.
I don't think,

756
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:56,370
I honestly don't think
that there is a way.

757
00:46:58,050 --> 00:46:58,883
Uh,

758
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:04,650
you know what it'd be like.
It's like you have a leaky faucet.

759
00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:10,920
It all you're trying to do is buy more
paper towels and keep wiping up the water

760
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:14,190
and you're never dealing with the
leaky faucet. Okay. This shit is,

761
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:19,770
it's how do I, how do I, how do
I put this in my own moronic way?

762
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,313
All right.

763
00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:25,240
I've done a lot of people's shows,
you know,

764
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:28,470
little acting thing here
or a fucking podcast here,

765
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:33,250
a big time shows at this point. I've done
that stuff and this is what I've found.

766
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:37,240
If the person at the top is a good shit,
everybody,

767
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:40,750
everybody's a good shit.
Everybody's a good, you know,

768
00:47:40,751 --> 00:47:44,260
if the person at the top is not an
egomaniac and not acting like an asshole,

769
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:45,580
a fucking diva,

770
00:47:45,790 --> 00:47:50,140
everybody falls in line because you can't
act like an asshole. It's like, well,

771
00:47:50,141 --> 00:47:53,950
this guy is making more money than all of
us and he's, he's treating people well.

772
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:56,830
You know,
if I start acting like a dick,

773
00:47:56,831 --> 00:47:59,500
then it's just going to expose
me as being a dick. All right?

774
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:03,490
But if the person at the
top is a cunt, it, you know,

775
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:08,230
and it's just been an
unbelievable pain in the ass.

776
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:11,440
You know,
it's that leadership thing.

777
00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:15,130
It just rolls downhill and
everybody acts that way. The problem

778
00:48:15,770 --> 00:48:16,140
okay

779
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:21,140
with the world is it's a fuck or
be fucked system that we have.

780
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:24,443
Okay.

781
00:48:24,450 --> 00:48:25,040
All right.

782
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:30,040
And it's like it starts at the top with
the fuck over and they pass that on to

783
00:48:30,561 --> 00:48:34,520
the next level and it's hot potato.
You're trying to pass the fuck over

784
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:36,153
on,

785
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:40,140
you know what I mean?
And once you get in the game,

786
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:44,520
you end up just doing shit.
You don't even want to do.

787
00:48:44,521 --> 00:48:47,250
You just have to do it because
that's how the game is played.

788
00:48:47,730 --> 00:48:50,900
It's the whole bringing a
knife to a gunfight. You
can't do it. It's a gun fight.

789
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:55,260
You got to get a gun. And
I don't know how, I don't,

790
00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:00,440
I honestly don't think the only way to
change it is for basically one of these

791
00:49:00,811 --> 00:49:05,811
asteroids has to hit the earth and we
have to be wiped out like the fucking

792
00:49:06,451 --> 00:49:11,340
dinosaurs and it has to start
over again. You know, because

793
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:17,020
we are flawed. That's all I can say. Yeah,

794
00:49:17,021 --> 00:49:20,170
we're flawed just in general.
Even if you,

795
00:49:20,171 --> 00:49:22,870
even if you weren't able to
eliminate sociopath, just in general,

796
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:27,460
we're jealous or envious where conty and,
uh,

797
00:49:27,461 --> 00:49:31,500
and we do not handle power,
wealth, generally speaking, fizzy,

798
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:34,180
occasional fucking Gandhi.

799
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:36,460
Um,
uh,

800
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:40,160
Ralph Nader, a Jimmy Carter. Now,

801
00:49:40,161 --> 00:49:42,770
of course I got named somebody on the
rights of people don't get all comfy.

802
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:44,120
There's like this just,

803
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:45,550
okay.

804
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:50,030
I don't, I don't know enough fucking
people. I'm just saying it's very rare.

805
00:49:51,050 --> 00:49:54,800
Okay. And you know what the fuck
is my phone? What the hell is it?

806
00:49:55,610 --> 00:49:59,270
I hear it positive. Can you hear
it? Is it on the floor? Where is it?

807
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:04,150
Am I going to get mad at this
thing? Oh, there it is right there.

808
00:50:04,151 --> 00:50:07,660
Right in front of me. Oh,
that's Versie. Or is he,

809
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:09,460
he's probably be fucking
mouth already watering.

810
00:50:10,270 --> 00:50:11,103
MMM.

811
00:50:12,730 --> 00:50:15,840
Yeah. So you said, well, what do you,
what do you do about it? I would, uh,

812
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:21,370
I don't know. I would just listen
to people. If they sound honest,

813
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:23,590
I would vote for them.
That's basically all you can do,

814
00:50:23,591 --> 00:50:28,160
short of starting of revolution,
at which point you're going to have to,

815
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:30,380
uh, you know, be it the, the,

816
00:50:31,110 --> 00:50:31,943
yeah.

817
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:35,470
I don't know if the forefront
of, uh, a lot of murder

818
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:41,890
or, you know, you can just, you know,

819
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:48,070
find love and get it to get
yourself a dog, Eh, uh, you know,

820
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:53,080
tell some jokes. I Dunno. I,
I didn't look, I try not to
think about it. It's, it's,

821
00:50:53,081 --> 00:50:53,914
um,

822
00:50:56,090 --> 00:50:59,490
know the way I look at it now is just
like good. Yeah. When I see shit that's,

823
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:00,380
I mean, this is, this is,

824
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:03,710
this is how I deal with the depression
of it is I just say, oh good.

825
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:07,520
When I see us doing something fucked
up. Good. Oh, that's great. You know,

826
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:12,710
there we go. That will hasten
our demise and maybe we can,

827
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:16,110
uh, maybe something else
will come along. You don't,

828
00:51:16,130 --> 00:51:20,750
it was the dinosaurs were just, I dunno,
I'm not going to say they would dump,

829
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:24,440
but they were kind of just taking up space
and then when we came along, you know,

830
00:51:24,441 --> 00:51:29,180
the astroid I, you asteroid
comes into web is running shit,

831
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:31,700
whatever you believe is like, all
right, let's start over again.

832
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:35,600
And it was just like an
overcorrection much in the way,

833
00:51:35,601 --> 00:51:40,280
like feminism was an
overcorrection. No, it wasn't.

834
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:41,600
Feminism wasn't another correction.

835
00:51:41,601 --> 00:51:46,060
What it really was was a bunch of
pussy guys who didn't, who never said,

836
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:51,061
I'll write a write that needed to be
said somewhere in the last 20 years.

837
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:55,640
They should have been a giant.
All right.

838
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:58,253
You know,

839
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:02,660
and I'll tell you right now,
believe it or not,

840
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:04,910
that's what every God damn
brought out their needs,

841
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:11,200
especially the good looking ones. All
right? And if you are an honest woman,

842
00:52:11,201 --> 00:52:12,280
you know what I'm saying?

843
00:52:13,910 --> 00:52:14,743
You need

844
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:20,030
a man in your life or if you gay,
you need a woman in your life to be like,

845
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:24,380
oh right.
Oh right enough.

846
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:28,870
Which is what we're fucking in.
Guys are the same way.

847
00:52:28,970 --> 00:52:33,490
We like these big fucking kids
and if we don't, the same way,

848
00:52:33,491 --> 00:52:36,370
if you have a kid, and I can speak
for this because I've never had one,

849
00:52:41,010 --> 00:52:44,790
do you have a fucking kid and
the kid has no boundaries.

850
00:52:46,990 --> 00:52:50,130
It's going to be bouncing off the
fucking walls, acting like an asshole.

851
00:52:50,310 --> 00:52:53,730
And guys like me are going to be
looking at a kid and actually having the

852
00:52:53,731 --> 00:52:57,750
intrusive thought of what if I just gave
that toddler an upper cut. You know,

853
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:59,640
like that's how bad the kids behave.

854
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:05,940
Like adults are the same way if
we don't have any boundaries.

855
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:10,020
That's why so many of these fucking,
these rich cons,

856
00:53:11,310 --> 00:53:13,860
they got all the money in the world to
get everything they need and they still

857
00:53:13,861 --> 00:53:17,280
fucked their lives. I hope
it's because, because they did.

858
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:20,670
Nobody can keep them in check.
It's kind of like when Russia fell,

859
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:21,391
when Russia fell,

860
00:53:21,391 --> 00:53:23,370
that was one of the worst things
that ever happened in this country.

861
00:53:23,550 --> 00:53:27,630
Russia kept us in check in that, you
know, we were sitting at grappling,

862
00:53:28,490 --> 00:53:31,380
you know, we moved three feet that
way. They push us back four feet,

863
00:53:31,381 --> 00:53:33,420
then we'd move five feet.
We just doing that shit.

864
00:53:34,830 --> 00:53:39,390
Then once they fell down and it
was that wide open space. Yeah,

865
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:43,590
we did all the shit that we've
been doing at a, you know,

866
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:48,050
people are kind of looking at us like
we're a bunch of cops now, aren't they?

867
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:52,100
Alright. There you go. There.
Then I tied a asteroids.

868
00:53:52,101 --> 00:53:57,101
Dinosaurs are in our foreign
policy without ever reading
a goddamn thing about.

869
00:53:57,261 --> 00:54:01,670
How'd you like that everybody? I think
I hit new heights of ignorant. Um,

870
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:03,510
yeah,

871
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:06,600
I'm too stupid. Even. I don't know what
word comes next after that. All right.

872
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:10,080
What do we got here? Alright. What
the fuck is an excellent bill?

873
00:54:10,110 --> 00:54:11,070
Our family friend,

874
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:15,540
our friend of the family and investment
banker from Yale Business School,

875
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:18,270
extremely successful,
was married about five years ago.

876
00:54:18,510 --> 00:54:22,620
He was married to a bitch who went to
Harvard law school and worked as a very

877
00:54:22,621 --> 00:54:27,090
successful lawyer even when
they were married. Okay.

878
00:54:27,091 --> 00:54:31,080
So he's an investment banker. She, okay.
It sounds like an arranged marriage.

879
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:36,870
This is one of those things where every
day somebody in their life has on a blue

880
00:54:36,871 --> 00:54:39,480
blazer anyways.
He says by themselves,

881
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:42,570
they made more money in a year
than most people make in 10 years.

882
00:54:42,571 --> 00:54:43,680
That's not their fault.

883
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:47,400
They also studied hard enough to get into
Yale and Harvard or were born into it.

884
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:51,870
At which point good for
them. They got lucky. Um,

885
00:54:52,710 --> 00:54:54,870
you know, you can't get mad
at people who get who, who

886
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:58,440
were born into going to Yale and Harvard.

887
00:54:58,441 --> 00:55:03,030
You can't get mad at that shit unless
you are helping out people who were born

888
00:55:03,031 --> 00:55:05,940
into sweatshop labor. If you were
actually helping them get out of that,

889
00:55:05,941 --> 00:55:07,200
then you can get mad at that shit.

890
00:55:07,201 --> 00:55:09,780
But if you're just sitting in
the middle wearing sweat shop,

891
00:55:09,781 --> 00:55:13,260
labor clothes and not giving a fuck,
and you weren't born into sweatshop labor,

892
00:55:13,261 --> 00:55:14,160
I don't think,
personally,

893
00:55:14,161 --> 00:55:16,950
I don't think he'd get mad at someone
who's born at that blue blood shit.

894
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:21,330
See that? There's another fucking
Barbara of logic for you there anyways,

895
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:22,261
by themselves.

896
00:55:22,261 --> 00:55:24,990
They made more money in a year that most
people make in 10 years when they got

897
00:55:24,991 --> 00:55:27,030
divorced,
the husband got custody of the kids,

898
00:55:27,031 --> 00:55:32,031
but the wife got the house and half of
every penny of the husband would ever

899
00:55:32,071 --> 00:55:36,720
make for the rest of his life.
That doesn't make sense.

900
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:42,060
Let's say came, drew that up. Not only
could she now easily support herself.

901
00:55:42,061 --> 00:55:47,061
She remarried another lawyer that may
just as much as her but continues to spend

902
00:55:47,911 --> 00:55:51,510
the original husband's money. But as
far as I know, when she gets remarried,

903
00:55:51,511 --> 00:55:55,950
the alimony stops. Yeah. Says
the child support I believe,

904
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:58,590
unless he doesn't legally adopt
them, I don't know. It's weird.

905
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:02,460
And it also goes from state to state and
I've also never read up on those laws.

906
00:56:02,461 --> 00:56:05,710
People just told me
about him. Um, anyways,

907
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:08,760
she has no kids to take care of or
anything, but she's still got everything.

908
00:56:08,761 --> 00:56:12,360
We live in Massachusetts, which means
the divorce laws heavily favor females,

909
00:56:12,361 --> 00:56:14,730
but still, what the
fuck? Yeah, it's brutal.

910
00:56:16,050 --> 00:56:21,030
I think eventually they will
be reform, uh, reformed, uh,

911
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:25,990
reformed or reformed. They
will be reformed in another
shape. They'll be reformed.

912
00:56:26,710 --> 00:56:31,030
What, you know, guys, if you're still
listening to this fucking podcast, I mean,

913
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:35,110
other than beyond to just listen how
fucking stupid I am to make yourself feel

914
00:56:35,111 --> 00:56:39,820
better, please don't listen
to me. Uh, yeah. I mean,

915
00:56:39,821 --> 00:56:44,140
they are what? They are divorced.
Lars are what they are. And, um,

916
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:47,140
I'm done bitching about him
because I'm not doing anything.

917
00:56:47,141 --> 00:56:50,950
I'm not starting a movement to try
and change him. Um, I'm a lazy fuck.

918
00:56:50,951 --> 00:56:54,550
I like to sit around and complain.
But, um, if you have a petition,

919
00:56:54,551 --> 00:56:58,520
I'm all about it. I'll sign it.
I'll definitely sign it. Uh,

920
00:56:59,170 --> 00:57:03,490
in fairness, um, when the woman makes
more money, a guy can do that too or too.

921
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:08,470
Uh, but the way the world is set up, the
guys make most of the fucking money. So

922
00:57:09,970 --> 00:57:14,830
I guess that's one of the trade offs.
So in the words of Mr Hand,

923
00:57:14,831 --> 00:57:15,664
get a good one.

924
00:57:16,690 --> 00:57:19,300
Fast Times at Ridgemont high referenced
to you all the people out there.

925
00:57:19,301 --> 00:57:22,000
Get a good one.
Get yourself a good woman.

926
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:28,120
Um, if I ever got divorced firing, get
married and if I ever get divorced,

927
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:29,110
I'm going to tell you right now,

928
00:57:30,150 --> 00:57:33,220
I am going to go into such as zen space.

929
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:35,380
I already know what the
fuck I'm going to do.

930
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:39,070
I'm going to get a one bedroom apartment.

931
00:57:39,910 --> 00:57:44,110
I'm going to get an electronic drum kit
and we're gonna have a one fucking bowl,

932
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:47,170
one plate, one fork, one spoon, one knife.

933
00:57:48,190 --> 00:57:52,590
I'm going to have a fucking TV and have
all the sports packages and I'm going to

934
00:57:52,591 --> 00:57:57,280
dress like Malcolm Young, which is
fucking jeans, t shirt. No belt.

935
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:02,810
That's it. I'm going to ride a
bicycle and I'm just gonna. I'm just,

936
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:05,680
I'm tapping out.
I'm never going to best buy again.

937
00:58:05,710 --> 00:58:09,400
I'm never going to target other than
after I get my bulk. Can you buy one ball?

938
00:58:09,401 --> 00:58:10,270
I didn't think he can't.

939
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:12,893
You know

940
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:16,970
I'm going to. I will. I will. I
want you to have a vacuum cleaner.

941
00:58:17,030 --> 00:58:21,470
I'll have a little broom and a dust pan
and I'm going to live like a fucking

942
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:26,210
monk. That's it. Then I'll
give her all my fucking money.

943
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:29,420
I'll keep telling jokes. I don't give a
shit. I'll give her all the fucking money.

944
00:58:29,990 --> 00:58:34,580
Hey, you want it? Is this gonna
make you happy? Go ahead. Fuck it.

945
00:58:38,030 --> 00:58:42,980
Fuck it. Fuck. Do I care?
You're not when it rains.

946
00:58:42,981 --> 00:58:45,890
Do I get wet now? I don't
am I eating everyday? Fine.

947
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:50,510
I'm going to get into that mindset and
I'll send her that alimony and child

948
00:58:50,511 --> 00:58:55,511
support check and I will draw a big
maniacal fucking smiley face on it

949
00:58:58,310 --> 00:59:02,720
and uh, that's it. And I will show up.
You know what I'm going to buy? I would,

950
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:06,590
I buy a Chevy citation
with the sideways radio

951
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:09,890
and I would redo that fucker.

952
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:14,210
I'd have the ugliest fucking car on
top and underneath would be sweet.

953
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:19,130
I teach myself how to do all of that
Shit, you know? That's what I would do.

954
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:22,190
That's I was,
I already have the game plan.

955
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:25,350
Do you know this is what society
successful. You've got to,

956
00:59:25,351 --> 00:59:26,870
you got to have everything all mapped out.

957
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:29,650
I'm not even married yet
and I'm still fucking, I,

958
00:59:29,651 --> 00:59:33,380
I already have a plan if I
get divorced. Okay. People,

959
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:39,020
you got to think ahead. All right
friends, ugly chick, uncle Billy. Boy,

960
00:59:39,060 --> 00:59:40,310
if you're a fucking divorce right now,

961
00:59:40,311 --> 00:59:44,450
you want to do that rather than trying to
get all your shit back. How about this?

962
00:59:44,451 --> 00:59:47,840
How about fuck heaven.
Shit not, there you go.

963
00:59:48,050 --> 00:59:49,970
It's about the stupidest thing you
ever heard. But think about it.

964
00:59:49,971 --> 00:59:54,590
This is a brilliance in it. Fuck
it. Why do you need to have them?

965
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:57,260
You don't need a man cave,
you know?

966
00:59:57,320 --> 01:00:00,320
Then something's going to
break down and some, you know,

967
01:00:00,410 --> 01:00:02,450
whatever the fuck that geek
squads got to come over there.

968
01:00:02,451 --> 01:00:03,530
You don't want to deal with that shit.

969
01:00:04,930 --> 01:00:08,120
I would keep it as simple to
have a banana for breakfast.

970
01:00:09,710 --> 01:00:12,830
You know, take some NHL Games, but some
NBA, whatever the fuck you went to,

971
01:00:13,790 --> 01:00:16,820
sit there and read the paper.
You know,

972
01:00:20,690 --> 01:00:25,190
I think I'm onto something
here, right? Fuck iPods.

973
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:30,830
Get a stereo. Let's do a record.
Start churning butter. Just go,

974
01:00:30,831 --> 01:00:34,190
go the other way.
Don't let her win you go the other way.

975
01:00:34,191 --> 01:00:37,970
Start making your own clothes. All
right. You don't gotta go that far,

976
01:00:37,971 --> 01:00:42,590
but you don't what I'm saying?
Um, anyways, friends, ugly chick.

977
01:00:42,591 --> 01:00:46,850
Take a pasta, making class,
um, friends, ugly chick, Jesus.

978
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:48,800
This is going to be mean uncle Billy boy.

979
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:54,890
My friend recently got us into
his first real relationship.

980
01:00:55,220 --> 01:00:58,850
This fucking broad is a
real cunt to start. Uh,

981
01:00:58,851 --> 01:01:01,720
she doesn't want him hanging out with
any of his friends and basically it

982
01:01:01,721 --> 01:01:03,020
doesn't let him leave the house.

983
01:01:03,050 --> 01:01:07,580
Now I got to tell you something
that's complete bullshit, okay?

984
01:01:08,450 --> 01:01:12,410
Okay. I agree with she doesn't want him
to hang out with any of his friends.

985
01:01:12,411 --> 01:01:16,670
She could be like controlling and to,

986
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:18,830
but to say she doesn't
let him leave the house.

987
01:01:18,831 --> 01:01:22,820
Is this guy literally trying to leave
the house and she's fucking putting them

988
01:01:22,821 --> 01:01:26,030
in a headlock. You know, putting
them in a chicken wing or some shit.

989
01:01:26,270 --> 01:01:30,260
Figure four leg lock. No.
Your friend is a pussy

990
01:01:31,970 --> 01:01:34,680
with a capital p Dash.
See,

991
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:40,700
this is what now he's he,
he should be laying down the law.

992
01:01:41,210 --> 01:01:44,450
He needs to be, hey, hey,
hey enough. Settle down.

993
01:01:45,530 --> 01:01:48,290
Settle down.
I'm with you,

994
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:52,430
but I'm living a balanced life here.
Let me draw a circle here.

995
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:54,290
This is the time of spending with you.

996
01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:57,590
This is the time I'm spending with
my friends. This is my alone time.

997
01:01:58,670 --> 01:02:01,280
This is my drink and bear time.
All right.

998
01:02:02,150 --> 01:02:06,380
The whole circle has to be filled with
different shit sweetheart or I'm not

999
01:02:06,381 --> 01:02:11,150
going to be happy. Are you telling me
you want me to be miserable? If you are,

1000
01:02:11,210 --> 01:02:15,270
I am leaving for good. If you're
not, then fucking work with me.

1001
01:02:16,030 --> 01:02:16,341
All right?

1002
01:02:16,341 --> 01:02:18,980
That's what your friend needs
to say before I even get
through all this. Anyways,

1003
01:02:19,050 --> 01:02:20,910
goes living in Buffalo,
Buffalo.

1004
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:24,030
It is rather customer to go out
once a week for chicken wings,

1005
01:02:24,031 --> 01:02:28,110
beer and watch some good guts watching
some goddamn hockey. Oh, by the way,

1006
01:02:28,111 --> 01:02:32,310
shout out to this. Say both.
They fucking own the Bruins.

1007
01:02:33,830 --> 01:02:38,380
It is just a regular season.
I'm not trying to jinx you
guys, but you guys, uh, you,

1008
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:41,940
you're kicking our ass. I, you what
sucks is I taped the last game.

1009
01:02:42,330 --> 01:02:44,220
I'm not trying to avoid an ass kicking,
but you know,

1010
01:02:44,221 --> 01:02:46,860
for some reason I take it and I
came home and the screen was blank.

1011
01:02:46,861 --> 01:02:50,770
I think it was actually on the
NHL network. I take the wrong, um,

1012
01:02:52,020 --> 01:02:54,500
I take the wrong one, so
I actually missed it. Um,

1013
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:59,040
I did read the box scores and all that
type of stuff. Uh, you know what I love?

1014
01:02:59,070 --> 01:03:01,230
I love how you guys keep,
I keep forgetting the guy's name,

1015
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:04,170
your big six foot eight inch goon.

1016
01:03:04,230 --> 01:03:08,850
How you guys keep giving Bruins fan shit
that Milan Lou, Lou Cheech won't fight.

1017
01:03:10,230 --> 01:03:13,230
Was it John Scott? Whatever his
fucking name. What, why would,

1018
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:17,160
why the fuck would you do that?
Hey,

1019
01:03:17,161 --> 01:03:21,330
let's have one of our best players, one
of the best power forwards in the league.

1020
01:03:22,620 --> 01:03:27,620
Fight a guy six foot taller than him
who weighs 50 more pounds than he does.

1021
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:29,940
Six inches taller than him when a five,

1022
01:03:29,941 --> 01:03:34,170
six inches taller outweighs and by 40
50 pounds. And who's an absolute guru?

1023
01:03:34,350 --> 01:03:38,850
There's a great trade off and that we'll
have Lou Cheech who can score goals and

1024
01:03:38,851 --> 01:03:39,750
actually play the game.

1025
01:03:39,751 --> 01:03:42,540
Sit down for five minutes and
all you guys do is lose a goon.

1026
01:03:43,590 --> 01:03:48,090
Why would we do that? And we'll risking
having one of our best players get hurt.

1027
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:50,970
Why would we do that?
That was like back in the day of Montreal.

1028
01:03:50,971 --> 01:03:53,970
Canadien fans would get pissed at that.
He wouldn't fight George La Rock,

1029
01:03:54,750 --> 01:03:57,780
you know, because he'd beat
up one of their fucking, uh,

1030
01:03:59,010 --> 01:04:03,740
I don't know where the fuck he beat
up. Some guy. It's, I don't know.

1031
01:04:03,810 --> 01:04:06,120
Someone was going to Lou Cheech
never fights anybody his size.

1032
01:04:06,150 --> 01:04:08,090
I click up Blue Cheech,
uh,

1033
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:11,400
on youtube by searching the first guy
he's fighting as a guy his size who

1034
01:04:11,401 --> 01:04:13,880
actually waste more than 15 pounds.
Then him,

1035
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:17,670
I'll get some guy in Toronto and
he beats the shit out of him. Okay.

1036
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:20,940
Who Cheech could be your guy up,

1037
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:25,260
your fucking family up and a in
something else to make three. Alright.

1038
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:27,780
Stop questioning his toughness.
You can do it all you want,

1039
01:04:27,781 --> 01:04:29,970
but I'm not buying into it.
Hey,

1040
01:04:29,971 --> 01:04:34,140
how come your best guy is in fighting the
guy that we have that can't even play?

1041
01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:41,370
Um, anyway, so let's, let's
continue on here. Hey, by the way,

1042
01:04:41,930 --> 01:04:46,770
you got to go to buffalo. Fuck
Niagara Falls. You got to go to Wa.

1043
01:04:46,830 --> 01:04:48,480
Was it Duffy's or anchor bar?
I never,

1044
01:04:48,481 --> 01:04:51,750
I went to anchor bar like the one
time in history they ran out of wings.

1045
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:53,220
I was at first,
he again,

1046
01:04:53,221 --> 01:04:57,740
we went to anchor bar first the first
night and then in the second day we would

1047
01:04:57,741 --> 01:05:01,030
go to a sabers game. We went
to Ankara Barn. Uh, and they,

1048
01:05:01,031 --> 01:05:04,910
they ran out of fucking links. So,
uh, and I got to tell you, man, they,

1049
01:05:04,911 --> 01:05:09,720
they make up like nobody else in
the goddamn country. Um, so anyways,

1050
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:12,270
he goes, this broad won't even
let them out of the house.

1051
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:15,210
I won't even let about
out once a week for that.

1052
01:05:16,350 --> 01:05:18,340
She has wrapped brains so badly,

1053
01:05:18,370 --> 01:05:22,750
warped his brains so badly that he now
thinks she's right in saying we are a bad

1054
01:05:22,751 --> 01:05:23,740
influence on him.

1055
01:05:24,190 --> 01:05:27,580
We've all been friends since early
elementary school for Christ's sake,

1056
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:29,920
and she's only known
him a couple of months.

1057
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:36,340
Here's where it gets fucked up. He's by
no means a bad looking guy and she looks

1058
01:05:37,870 --> 01:05:42,160
like she got bum rushed and was beaten
in the face with the club and for the

1059
01:05:42,161 --> 01:05:46,120
Cherry on top, on top,
she has her peace. Now,

1060
01:05:46,121 --> 01:05:49,510
how do you know that unless that
guy got up and told you, bill,

1061
01:05:49,511 --> 01:05:54,250
what the fuck do I do to wake him up?
Uh,

1062
01:05:56,020 --> 01:05:57,130
there's nothing you can do it.

1063
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:01,540
There's nothing you could do.
Come on man.

1064
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:06,600
This like that guy is either wired to
be submissive or he wasn't raised right.

1065
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:10,753
You know,

1066
01:06:11,690 --> 01:06:15,350
I think a big thing, you know,
with the kid that I don't have,

1067
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:18,750
the way I try to raise my
kid that I don't have is a,

1068
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:20,960
I just realized I've been
leaning back and sitting forward.

1069
01:06:20,961 --> 01:06:23,870
So I'm sure the volume is all
over the place. I apologize. Uh,

1070
01:06:25,610 --> 01:06:27,380
one of the biggest things
you got to do with kids did,

1071
01:06:27,381 --> 01:06:31,160
you got to get them out of this shell?
You know what I mean?

1072
01:06:31,610 --> 01:06:35,860
Um, like I had, uh, you know,

1073
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:43,110
uh, who the hell is, who
was it? One of my friends,

1074
01:06:43,210 --> 01:06:45,630
um, I'm trying to do this dad, I don't
like talking about people in my life.

1075
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:51,330
Whatever. Somebody I knew came down.
They were wholly in the, in there, uh,

1076
01:06:52,020 --> 01:06:55,740
I guess right around the high school
age and they came down to New York and I

1077
01:06:55,741 --> 01:06:59,090
immediately, first thing I did,
I made, made him like hail a cab,

1078
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:03,630
walk into a Bodega. I shown him out
of work, if you fucking get a paper,

1079
01:07:03,631 --> 01:07:04,560
you don't have to stand in line.

1080
01:07:04,561 --> 01:07:07,980
Just put a quarter down and just hold it
up and say post or whatever. Daily News,

1081
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:09,061
you know,
just,

1082
01:07:09,061 --> 01:07:14,061
and got them immediately acclimated
into speaking up in interacting with the

1083
01:07:14,581 --> 01:07:18,130
fucking city and the person within like,
you know,

1084
01:07:19,170 --> 01:07:23,640
two days had that shit down and was like,
Oh man,

1085
01:07:23,641 --> 01:07:26,940
I feel like a New Yorker. And like that,
that's what you have to do with kids.

1086
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:28,730
You've got to get them.
Um,

1087
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:34,130
you can't have those kids that hide behind
your fucking leg would when, um, that,

1088
01:07:34,180 --> 01:07:36,690
you know, you're meeting
someone, this is Mr so and so,

1089
01:07:36,691 --> 01:07:38,640
and they're hiding behind your leg.
You can't have that.

1090
01:07:38,670 --> 01:07:42,330
You got it from fucking day one.
Get them out there, shake hands,

1091
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:46,950
look people in the eye talk and you've,
I don't know how to do it.

1092
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:49,830
Does that never had a kid.
But I think it's really important to have

1093
01:07:51,450 --> 01:07:56,450
to get your kid in tune with what he
or she is thinking and what he or she

1094
01:07:57,031 --> 01:07:59,160
wants.
Nobody wants that situation.

1095
01:08:00,170 --> 01:08:01,003
MMM.

1096
01:08:02,590 --> 01:08:05,260
And if this woman is the way
you're painting her out to be,

1097
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:09,760
this is the only type of person because
she's so fucking insecure that she can

1098
01:08:09,761 --> 01:08:10,690
actually be with,

1099
01:08:11,140 --> 01:08:15,570
does she have to find
somebody so weak that mmm,

1100
01:08:16,330 --> 01:08:19,840
that person is going to allow them to
just completely take over their lives.

1101
01:08:19,841 --> 01:08:21,610
And I'll tell you what's
funny is after a while,

1102
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:23,530
these controlling type of fucking people,

1103
01:08:23,620 --> 01:08:26,200
they ended up hating the
person that they're with.

1104
01:08:27,490 --> 01:08:31,900
They do because they just don't respect
them after a while. You know what I mean?

1105
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:34,030
They finally got exactly what they wanted.

1106
01:08:34,031 --> 01:08:37,840
This person that they can use like a
fucking robot and in the end they don't

1107
01:08:37,841 --> 01:08:38,800
respect them.
So,

1108
01:08:38,930 --> 01:08:39,763
mmm.

1109
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:46,720
I Dunno what I would, um, you know
what dude, this is a childhood friend.

1110
01:08:46,721 --> 01:08:50,800
I could tell you really wanted to guide
back. He take a shot taking it back.

1111
01:08:52,130 --> 01:08:52,963
MMM.

1112
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:57,130
Don't say that she's ugly.
Don't mention her herpes.

1113
01:08:58,420 --> 01:09:01,560
It's just be like,
I mean dude,

1114
01:09:02,140 --> 01:09:06,340
you're literally trying to undo
this guy's hard drive at this point.

1115
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:10,660
If this guy, his self esteem
is his fucking low, this
is, you know, this is like,

1116
01:09:10,661 --> 01:09:12,610
wait,
why the doctor Phil show sucks.

1117
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:15,330
It's because somebody is going to come
in here and now this is like you're

1118
01:09:15,340 --> 01:09:18,340
talking about this guy. I'm guessing
it's at least in 25 years old.

1119
01:09:18,341 --> 01:09:21,190
You're talking about a quarter of a
century of thinking one way and then you

1120
01:09:21,191 --> 01:09:22,310
watch doctor Phil.
I'd be like,

1121
01:09:22,450 --> 01:09:27,450
you got to stick up for yourself if
you want to go out with your friends,

1122
01:09:28,030 --> 01:09:31,240
you got a tailor. All right,
we're going to commercial.

1123
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:34,090
And like it doesn't work like that.
And also on Doctor Phil Show,

1124
01:09:34,091 --> 01:09:37,060
he would never do that because he would
actually be supporting the fucking guy.

1125
01:09:37,420 --> 01:09:37,691
Okay.

1126
01:09:37,691 --> 01:09:40,630
And at the end of the day it's a God damn
business and who watches that show but

1127
01:09:40,631 --> 01:09:42,890
a bunch of broads,
um,

1128
01:09:44,050 --> 01:09:47,650
yet you somehow know something about it,
don't you bill? Well, I live with a woman.

1129
01:09:48,940 --> 01:09:51,340
She doesn't watch him anymore.
I just can't make funding.

1130
01:09:51,510 --> 01:09:54,370
Make it kept making fun of how
Dr Phil looks like a crooked cop.

1131
01:09:55,180 --> 01:09:56,013
MMM.

1132
01:09:56,440 --> 01:10:00,640
I don't know. He just like,
I just not look trustworthy
to be at all. Yeah, I mean,

1133
01:10:00,641 --> 01:10:03,820
you know, I'm just judging them. You
don't have the same way people judge me.

1134
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:07,210
It's all fair. It's all fair
in love and war. All right.

1135
01:10:07,211 --> 01:10:08,930
That's the podcast for this week.
Everybody,

1136
01:10:09,150 --> 01:10:10,120
uh,

1137
01:10:10,980 --> 01:10:13,600
I'm actually going to go to a sports
bar here and watch the island or some

1138
01:10:13,601 --> 01:10:16,870
becoming a fucking island is fan.
I've been watching him lately.

1139
01:10:16,871 --> 01:10:17,850
Leader turning the corner.

1140
01:10:17,851 --> 01:10:20,130
I hated them when they were a kid
just because they were awesome.

1141
01:10:20,131 --> 01:10:24,840
And every time the Bruins would get the
w the one tank and we never got past the

1142
01:10:24,841 --> 01:10:28,770
Canadians back in the day that if we
somehow lucked out and somebody else beat

1143
01:10:28,771 --> 01:10:29,430
the Canadians.

1144
01:10:29,430 --> 01:10:34,430
This is pre 1988 we basically owned
the fucking Canadians since 1988.

1145
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:37,890
I hope you guys really
realize that in Montreal.

1146
01:10:37,891 --> 01:10:42,720
You guys have not been a fucking
factor in our lives since 1988.

1147
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:46,590
It's been great. It's been a wonderful 25
years. I know what you guys are saying.

1148
01:10:46,620 --> 01:10:49,080
Oh, we beat you in this playoff series
beating in that playoff series. Hey,

1149
01:10:49,081 --> 01:10:53,310
that shit's going to happen. We
used to never beat you. All right,

1150
01:10:54,690 --> 01:10:55,920
good luck with your rebuilding.

1151
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:59,870
I'm just fucking with you actually like
what you guys are doing up there. Uh,

1152
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,510
okay. What am I talking about here?
That's the podcast for this week.

1153
01:11:04,390 --> 01:11:05,223
Uh,

1154
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:09,210
anything I have to announce,
I'm at the Wilbur theater this weekend.

1155
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:10,710
Thank you everybody
for buying the tickets.

1156
01:11:10,711 --> 01:11:13,680
I'm going to try and give you a
heck of a show. Go yourselves.

1157
01:11:13,681 --> 01:11:17,100
Don't take any shit. And if you're
in a relationship like that last guy,

1158
01:11:17,101 --> 01:11:17,970
you need to get out of it,

1159
01:11:18,450 --> 01:11:21,720
you should be allowed to have friends
and go out and see the meteors crashing

1160
01:11:21,721 --> 01:11:23,820
into earth. All right. See you next week.
