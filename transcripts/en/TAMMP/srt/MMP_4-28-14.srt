1
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:02,251
Hey,

2
00:00:02,251 --> 00:00:05,790
what's going on is bill borough and it's
the Monday morning podcast from Monday,

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,220
April 28th, 2014 what's
going on? How, why, yeah,

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:16,140
I am recording this and, uh, I'm
actually, according to Sunday night,

5
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:20,280
I just finished doing my
show here in Albany, um,

6
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:24,840
at this beautiful theater. I don't
even fucking know the name of. Well,

7
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:28,080
look at that. Would you look at
that? And you're probably like,

8
00:00:28,081 --> 00:00:31,140
why bill you arrogant ass?
Everybody came down to the fucking show.

9
00:00:31,141 --> 00:00:35,310
You don't even know the name of the
place. Well, the reason for that is, is a,

10
00:00:35,311 --> 00:00:38,010
I've been on vacation at a,

11
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,450
I felt like I was shaking rust off this
weekend. I had good shows and everything,

12
00:00:42,451 --> 00:00:46,350
but I was more trying to
remember the order of things,

13
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,300
how I kinda did shit and what
connected to what. And uh,

14
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:53,910
whenever I do that,
I'm in my head too much and then I don't,

15
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:58,680
it doesn't flow as well. Um, you know,

16
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,940
only I noticed, but I
noticed so, uh, either way,

17
00:01:02,941 --> 00:01:07,260
I want to thank everybody who came
out in Burlington, Vermont, um,

18
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:11,370
people who came out in Portland, Maine
and people came out here and, uh, Albany,

19
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:14,490
New York. It was great to come
back to this part of the country.

20
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:16,230
I did a lot of my early stand up,

21
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:21,670
especially up in Maine and he used to do
all the Bob Miley gigs up there at the

22
00:01:24,931 --> 00:01:27,780
old comedy connection up there.
He used to do and um,

23
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:32,550
I didn't do too much shit in
Vermont. You know, Vermont is a, uh,

24
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,460
I dunno, that's like, it was
just a little, I was south
of Boston, so, you know,

25
00:01:38,461 --> 00:01:41,910
you drove up 93, a route three,
you fucking won in New Hampshire.

26
00:01:41,911 --> 00:01:42,860
Then he shot right into me.

27
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:47,340
And that was basically at
that little corner of it that,
that I, I went to. And um,

28
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,430
so this time when I came
back from Burlington, Vermont
to Portland, I could've,

29
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:53,790
I could've driven the fast way,
but I decided to go the scenic route.

30
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:57,180
I'm going to go, the CD crew can
see what the country looks like.

31
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:00,390
And I fucking went there and
it was amazing to look at.

32
00:02:00,391 --> 00:02:05,391
But all I kept getting stuck behind people
and like mini vans or trucks and I'm

33
00:02:05,701 --> 00:02:06,840
driving like a psycho.

34
00:02:06,841 --> 00:02:11,400
And after a while there's only so many
furniture stores and Barnes and old

35
00:02:11,401 --> 00:02:14,850
places with signs that you can look at
before you want to get the fuck out of

36
00:02:14,851 --> 00:02:18,220
there. But, um, we had a
great time or for a month,

37
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:22,740
I didn't realize they had the
heroin problem. They did. You know,

38
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,590
I didn't bring it up during the
show because it was so not funny.

39
00:02:25,591 --> 00:02:29,280
But Jesus Christ a fuck is their heroin.

40
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,520
Like that level of a problem in Vermont.

41
00:02:32,521 --> 00:02:34,080
Vermont is like one of those states where,
you know,

42
00:02:34,081 --> 00:02:36,720
you finally knock up your woman,
you know, like, you know what,

43
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:42,890
why don't we give this kid
a great childhood and where
should we move this kid

44
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,720
where no one can hurt him and he can
fucking run around with horses and all of

45
00:02:48,721 --> 00:02:51,490
that Shit. Right. And, uh,

46
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:56,190
we know Vermont's one of those places.
Well that's right.

47
00:02:56,191 --> 00:02:58,380
They had it in rolling stone.
The new face of heroin,

48
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,820
the explosion of drugs like
Oxycontin has given way to heroin.

49
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,460
The heroin epidemic ravaging the
least likely corners of America.

50
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:09,350
Jesus Christ

51
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:17,190
like Vermont. What does it say?
How do you pronounce B U, c. O. L,

52
00:03:17,191 --> 00:03:20,550
I. C. B, U. C o. L, I. C,

53
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,000
Bucolic Bu Cocky Vermont,

54
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:29,030
which has just woken up to a
full blown crisis. You know,

55
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:32,220
ever since aids came out, not a lot
of people say full blown anymore.

56
00:03:32,221 --> 00:03:35,370
So I want to give, I want to give
rolling stone a good nod there.

57
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,610
You know I was talking
to you about a while ago.

58
00:03:38,611 --> 00:03:41,870
I was looking at theaters to do a new
special in an inside on old theaters.

59
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:46,260
The only time you used the word ornate
and another example is full blown,

60
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:51,230
full blown is only used with aids.
I mean,

61
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,120
what did they say?
I'm trying to think of pre aids.

62
00:03:53,121 --> 00:03:57,020
So I fucking remember with full blown,
we've got a full blown epidemic.

63
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:02,170
I'll tell you, last night I went to the
bathroom after that Mexican again food.

64
00:04:02,171 --> 00:04:04,900
I took a full blown shit.
I don't know what people used to say,

65
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,970
but ever since I can remember
since the mid eighties,

66
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,570
full blown is always been filed with age.

67
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,840
Look how much progress we've
made with death disease.

68
00:04:15,841 --> 00:04:20,490
Not only can people live
longer with HIV virus,

69
00:04:20,491 --> 00:04:24,410
you can actually now save full
blown crisis. That's a major,

70
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:28,080
that's a major movement,
you know. Um, anyways,

71
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:33,260
I got to read this whole thing. I got
to read this whole thing. It was a,

72
00:04:33,261 --> 00:04:37,050
it was terrible to see, cause it's such
a beautiful frigging place. Oh Bill,

73
00:04:37,051 --> 00:04:40,950
shut up with your stupid travel tips.
You, you know, go fuck yourself.

74
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,990
What do you want from me?
I went,

75
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,290
I went to three places where you go
either skiing or antiquing. All right.

76
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:48,430
There was no snow.
So what else was I supposed to do?

77
00:04:48,431 --> 00:04:51,570
I went up there with Versie and I
brought some Cubans out that way.

78
00:04:51,571 --> 00:04:54,610
I got to lay off this habit
I really good at. I'm,

79
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,860
I'm done with and not done with
it. Who's kidding who? But I,

80
00:04:57,861 --> 00:05:00,690
I gotta I gotta knock it down.
All right.

81
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,140
I smoked enough cigars this month to,
uh,

82
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:09,610
I don't know what kill a fucking
grizzly bear. I like him, but I, um,

83
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:12,540
I'm finishing the Cubans.

84
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:15,120
I got left and then I'm
going to be done for awhile.

85
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:20,880
At least that's what I'm telling
myself. A fucking moron. All right,

86
00:05:20,881 --> 00:05:23,320
let's talk NHL playoffs people.
I apologize too,

87
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,940
if the energy isn't what you're used
to on this podcast. Uh, like I said,

88
00:05:26,941 --> 00:05:29,400
I'm in this hotel room and you remember
what happened to me in New Jersey when I

89
00:05:29,401 --> 00:05:32,280
was screaming at the top of my lungs.
I'm trying to avoid that.

90
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:36,960
Trying to avoid that. Uh,
hey. You know something?

91
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:40,950
I was giving myself shit about all my
Stanley Cup picks and all of a sudden

92
00:05:40,951 --> 00:05:45,180
every, all the series is other than
the turning around here, you know,

93
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,590
Chicago comes back and beats
the blues man. That would,

94
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,450
that was amazing and
devastating to watch it.

95
00:05:52,451 --> 00:05:54,000
No amazing for Blackhawk fans,

96
00:05:54,001 --> 00:05:57,150
but that's all they've seen
for the last few years. So,

97
00:05:59,090 --> 00:05:59,610
okay.

98
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:04,260
I feel less good for them and more
bad for Saint Louis, Jesus Christ.

99
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,210
How many times they're
going to break your heart.

100
00:06:06,211 --> 00:06:09,450
That team is aptly named the blues.

101
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,520
Jesus Christ. What does you,
what are you going to do?

102
00:06:13,521 --> 00:06:15,510
You gotta come up with a new
name for that fucking team.

103
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,200
They just keep doing that to their fence.
How many times?

104
00:06:19,201 --> 00:06:20,880
And they keep coming back.
Great fence.

105
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:22,790
Yeah.

106
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:26,510
Why do they keep blowing Sears?
Um,

107
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:30,470
Minnesota actually tied up to series with,
uh,

108
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,630
the avalanche before they
went back up three to two.

109
00:06:32,631 --> 00:06:36,050
And I felt really good about it until
Matt Cook blew out somebody else's knee

110
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:39,710
once again.
Or is he calls it finishing his check.

111
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:41,720
Okay.

112
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,720
I saw it as a part of the night as
apology. Just talking about he has,

113
00:06:44,721 --> 00:06:45,950
he has cleaned up his game.

114
00:06:45,951 --> 00:06:49,670
He actually won an award for
being the most improved player,

115
00:06:49,671 --> 00:06:53,270
but I just don't get stuck in
your fucking, I don't get it.

116
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,910
I don't get how that's finishing your
fucking chair. I don't why that the,

117
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,670
the reason that you would do that,
I mean,

118
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:04,610
he still could've brought his stick up
maybe and hit the guy in his shoulder or

119
00:07:04,611 --> 00:07:06,440
something like that.
You don't fucking do that.

120
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:10,960
We get nothing I don't understand is
what the guy who decides to do a need in

121
00:07:10,961 --> 00:07:11,421
each check.

122
00:07:11,421 --> 00:07:14,830
How come both their knees don't blow out
or how come sometimes the other guy who

123
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:19,130
who's doing the dirty move like his
knee doesn't blow up. I got to tell you,

124
00:07:19,131 --> 00:07:22,760
I thanks. Stefan can tell. I think he's
keeps going. A, he's going really lenient.

125
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:28,510
He only gave him a seven game suspension
and he only gave Lou Cheech a $5,000

126
00:07:28,671 --> 00:07:31,970
fine for stabbing somebody
right between the balls.

127
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,333
I Dunno.

128
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:40,790
This guy's like a player's coach. Who the
fuck knows? Anyways, the ducks. All right,

129
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:43,520
so in Minnesota could
still win that series,

130
00:07:43,521 --> 00:07:46,540
but that would make me happy because
you know what the fuck they did or mad

131
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:49,640
cooked it,
but I called the Chicago series.

132
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:54,330
Ducks are probably gone right now.
They were up three to two.

133
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:59,010
I picked the ducks in that one.
I did pick the king's over these shacks.

134
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:02,250
That one's straight it to who the
fuck knows they are the sharks,

135
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,440
sort of the West Coast,
St Louis Blues where they just put their,

136
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:08,380
they just taught you their fence.
They get them all excited. Hey,

137
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:12,660
we might do something. Go Fuck
Yourself. Go Watch a baseball game.

138
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:17,010
Sorry about that. Come back in
October. Yeah, this certain fence,

139
00:08:17,011 --> 00:08:19,980
they just like San Diego charge offense.
It's just like,

140
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:23,280
what the fuck did they do to
deserve what that team does to them?

141
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:27,720
Every goddamn be a Philadelphia
Eagle fits. Well actually,
you know what they did?

142
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,593
You know what they did.

143
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:37,200
You can't feel bad for Philadelphia
Eagle Fans. You just can't, not all,

144
00:08:37,201 --> 00:08:37,891
if some of them,

145
00:08:37,891 --> 00:08:41,340
you can tell the ones who actually
go to the game and are human beings,

146
00:08:41,341 --> 00:08:44,040
but that the core fan
base of fucking animals,

147
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:50,310
I use surprise even know what the score
is. They just hose them down every game.

148
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:53,520
That's it. Bath. Give
him eight Beth's a year,

149
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:56,640
eight home games right now of Canadians.

150
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,960
They wrapped their up for games to done.
The penguins are coming back.

151
00:09:00,961 --> 00:09:03,660
They're three to to cut help
you if you don't like hockey.

152
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,780
And I picked the flyers, they actually
tied it up to two and that was three,

153
00:09:06,781 --> 00:09:10,380
two ranges. So knows I still
make my pics. Might all come in.

154
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:14,730
And what would that mean, bill? I
don't know. I don't fucking know.

155
00:09:14,731 --> 00:09:16,540
So now the Bruins get to play the uh,

156
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,190
the blue block a conch though.

157
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,590
I actually like the Canadians
and I liked the uniforms,

158
00:09:22,591 --> 00:09:26,130
but I just can't stand their fence.
Jesus is so fucking,

159
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:31,790
there's such fucking
pussies. I just, the way,

160
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:35,870
the way they throw up their fucking hands
when they think they got robbed on a

161
00:09:35,871 --> 00:09:38,930
call.
There's so God damn dramatic.

162
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,740
Why don't you just take a little fucking
hankie out of your front pocket and

163
00:09:42,741 --> 00:09:46,760
fucking wave at, at the ref with three
of your fingers in the air. You know,

164
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:49,730
I actually went to a game that early
this year and I found they're either like

165
00:09:49,731 --> 00:09:53,290
that or their absolute animals.
[inaudible] that's,

166
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,360
those are Canadian fence there either
the stereotypical French person minus the

167
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:04,160
Beo. I will give them that. Or they,
they look like absolute animals.

168
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:08,560
They look like they came in from some
northern fucking province. But anyways,

169
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,950
I'm just breaking that balls.
All right. I think this,

170
00:10:11,951 --> 00:10:15,490
obviously it's a Bruins Canadian series.
Um,

171
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:19,390
I know we've swept each other in the
past, but I just think that, I know we're,

172
00:10:19,391 --> 00:10:20,410
we're even enough.

173
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,360
Okay.

174
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,690
It's just never easy. It's,
it's going to go, there's,

175
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:29,380
I don't think that they could beat us
and under seven games and I don't think

176
00:10:29,381 --> 00:10:32,620
that we could beat
them. And, and under six

177
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:38,300
and the sixth game would be in Montreal.
I'd skits. Got to go seven, right.

178
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:41,440
It's got to go seven when we both have
competitive teams, it goes sevens.

179
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:43,250
It's going to be a class yet,
but I'll tell you right now,

180
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,700
if you're not in no hockey
and you want to get into it,

181
00:10:46,701 --> 00:10:50,930
why don't you check out the
Bruins? A Canadian series. Um,

182
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,340
all right, so, so there's
that Jesus' question.

183
00:10:55,341 --> 00:10:58,810
Why do I try to do a podcast
after a fucking show? Huh?

184
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:03,440
I just want to wind down and
add to my fucking pasty belly.

185
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,311
That's what I want to do.

186
00:11:04,311 --> 00:11:09,311
I want to go down to the hotel kiosk
and go get some fucking Oreo cookies and

187
00:11:10,131 --> 00:11:13,950
then some of those nuclear orange crackers
and eat the orange crackers first.

188
00:11:13,951 --> 00:11:16,490
So you get the salt going
like yeah, yeah, yeah. Right.

189
00:11:16,491 --> 00:11:18,590
And then you fucking throw
the sugar down your throat.

190
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,400
Okay.

191
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,990
And you wake up the next day and your,

192
00:11:21,991 --> 00:11:26,520
your teeth looked like a fucking fruit
punch thing. I Dunno what, anyways,

193
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:29,560
I haven't been boozing out here
and I'm out of sorts and um,

194
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:31,310
okay.

195
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:34,610
So now like I guess I'm
going to smoke cigars. I can,

196
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:36,320
I just fucking try and
do something healthy.

197
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,700
I watched this whole thing online that
creep me the fuck out about the bacteria

198
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:43,190
in your gut.
You know,

199
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:46,160
it was funny as hell actually clicked
on this thing and they got me and I

200
00:11:46,161 --> 00:11:50,660
thought it was like one
of these conspiracy theory
videos, but it was actually a,

201
00:11:50,661 --> 00:11:54,240
an advertisement thing because for like
the first minutes, like an Asshole,

202
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,010
I'm watching this and this guy's
talking about food in this country,

203
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:01,540
being the United States and he's going
just like, he's going like the video.

204
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:06,370
They don't want you to see.
And he kept going there. They,

205
00:12:06,371 --> 00:12:08,290
this,
they that and all this fucking bullshit.

206
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:12,100
And he was just talking about how in
your gut you're basically, you have 80,

207
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:16,300
80% good bacteria and 20% bad bacteria.

208
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,810
And if you keep it at that balance,
you won't be lethargic,

209
00:12:19,811 --> 00:12:23,440
you'll have energy and you'll basically
be a healthy person. And it, you know,

210
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:28,690
for the most part, they think that
that's the best balance to have,

211
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,360
to not get a cancer and that type of shit.

212
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:36,870
So I'm watching the shit and it talking
about probiotics foods with probiotics

213
00:12:37,061 --> 00:12:39,970
like yogurt and fucking, now, what's that?

214
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,840
What's that fucking shit that looks
like onions, but it isn't sauerkraut.

215
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,500
All right. Looks like caramelized
onions and it never turned brown.

216
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:49,840
It looks like me as a caramelized onion,
right?

217
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:55,090
Sauerkraut, right? Olives, pickles,

218
00:12:55,150 --> 00:13:00,150
that type of shit has probiotic sets the
good bacteria in your gut and the 20%

219
00:13:01,061 --> 00:13:05,650
shit, uh, that stuff is
actually, believe it or not.

220
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,030
Okay.

221
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:11,010
This is really fucked up.
And when you talk about your,

222
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,270
your mortality,

223
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:17,570
the 20 plus 20% of the bacteria that what
they call a bad bacteria is its job is

224
00:13:19,711 --> 00:13:24,210
to basically eat you when you die.
I know.

225
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:28,270
I don't know. That's what the video
said. I'm not a doctor. Don't take this.

226
00:13:28,271 --> 00:13:29,580
You can do the fucking research.

227
00:13:29,581 --> 00:13:34,581
So basically because the food and
our country is such fucking poison.

228
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:40,791
I guess what is happening to a lot of
people is that the 20% is getting too high

229
00:13:42,391 --> 00:13:47,391
in the 80 is dropping the good versus
the bad and it reaches a tipping point

230
00:13:48,721 --> 00:13:49,950
where the,
the,

231
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:54,951
the bad bacteria outweighs the good
bacteria and it starts taking over and it

232
00:13:55,891 --> 00:13:57,470
starts fucking eating away at you.

233
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:03,350
Like you're dead and it can get all the
way up and do your fucking brain and you

234
00:14:04,231 --> 00:14:06,590
start craving the sugars and the salts.
This sound,

235
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:09,330
why I'm talking about the stuff that I
don't know if this is true because in the

236
00:14:09,331 --> 00:14:09,751
end of it,

237
00:14:09,751 --> 00:14:13,290
they of course had a pill that was going
to solve all of this and God knows I

238
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:17,220
didn't go to medical school now like
you need me to tell you that shit.

239
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:21,660
You could just tell that by the
way, I try and read out loud. Right?

240
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:22,913
But anyways,

241
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:29,250
I think the core of what they were
saying was true because it sounded good.

242
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,450
I'll be totally honest. I didn't look
up any of this shit. So I'm like,

243
00:14:33,451 --> 00:14:36,150
you know what?
Yogurt as probiotics in it.

244
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:40,860
I'll start eating yogurt like a fucking
twinkle toes there. So I'm like,

245
00:14:40,861 --> 00:14:45,090
fuck it. I'm going to start. I'm going
to, what are you going to deal, bill?

246
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,070
I'm going to fucking, I'm going to eat
some yogurt, right? So what I wanted,

247
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,610
but I want to get the good yogurt.
All right.

248
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:56,620
I don't want to get the yogurt that just
says all natural or says 100% healthy

249
00:14:56,631 --> 00:15:01,100
for you. I'm no trans fats and all that
shit because you know, those, those,

250
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,250
those big time corporate
fucking food bankers,

251
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,220
they've found a way to get
around all of that shit.

252
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:10,370
Basically what they did was they
got their own people in the FDA,

253
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:13,700
whatever the fuck it is,
they find loopholes where
they could, you know, they,

254
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:18,230
they draw a picture of a farm
with the sun, the sun behind it,

255
00:15:18,231 --> 00:15:22,430
100% natural, organic and all that
in it isn't, you know, they're down,

256
00:15:22,431 --> 00:15:23,840
they're beaten the chickens,
right.

257
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:28,220
Cutting their beaks off that big fucking
breast in the tipping over and Shit.

258
00:15:28,221 --> 00:15:28,490
That's,

259
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:31,880
that's basically still what you're
reading and they can wait 100% organic and

260
00:15:31,881 --> 00:15:33,530
all that crap.
They figured out a way around it.

261
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:38,420
So I'm sitting there trying to find like,

262
00:15:38,421 --> 00:15:43,130
I looked up all natural yogurt. I'll do
it right now. Just bear with me here.

263
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:47,750
All right. Just the amount
of, you can't find it. I,

264
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:51,530
or at least I don't know how to find it.
I don't know how to find a reputable,

265
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:56,200
reputable, a website that I can trust. Um,

266
00:15:56,630 --> 00:16:01,020
that will tell me basically
where, where, where the,

267
00:16:01,021 --> 00:16:06,021
the re the thing that says 100%
organic that actually is organic.

268
00:16:06,361 --> 00:16:08,100
So I just looked up organic yogurt.

269
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:09,720
Yeah.

270
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,810
And uh,

271
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:12,340
okay.

272
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:15,040
And this is,
this is the stony field.com.

273
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:16,740
Okay.

274
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,990
That's the one that comes up.
I don't know what their deal is.

275
00:16:18,991 --> 00:16:23,080
So I click on these guys
like Wallaby Yogurt,

276
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:26,500
Straus,
family creamery.com.

277
00:16:26,501 --> 00:16:30,880
Now that's a great name for a corporate
fucking farm is they'll call it the

278
00:16:30,881 --> 00:16:34,360
Straus family creamery.
Right?

279
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:38,780
Family was fucking whacked them
buried underneath the farm.

280
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:44,630
But what killed me is like I go on these,

281
00:16:44,631 --> 00:16:49,070
these websites and I click on
them and then they have like big,

282
00:16:49,071 --> 00:16:53,510
like corporate fuck an advertisement in
the side. So it's just like you guys,

283
00:16:53,511 --> 00:16:57,350
you guys are in bed with the devil here.
I mean maybe these guys are real.

284
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:02,000
Maybe I actually finally, this shit
looks real. No, I don't fucking know.

285
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:07,850
It's like when you go to like Edmond's
Bluebook or Edmunds and you're trying to

286
00:17:07,851 --> 00:17:12,470
find the actual price of a car when you
go to buy it and then you look in the

287
00:17:12,471 --> 00:17:16,010
side and like Chevrolet's paying
for advertising on there like that.

288
00:17:16,011 --> 00:17:17,330
It's like a major red flag.

289
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:21,120
It's like if your underlying
every car salesman

290
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:26,030
at Chevrolet letting them know what a
fucking alumina actually costs you if they

291
00:17:26,031 --> 00:17:29,990
still make that fucking thing.
The lumen guy, the Lumina, right.

292
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:35,030
Why would they advertise?
Does any of this make any sense?

293
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:36,740
Just can you guys tell me where do I go?

294
00:17:36,741 --> 00:17:41,330
Where is there a website that can
actually tell me where the good food is,

295
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,230
where the food is.

296
00:17:42,231 --> 00:17:46,660
That stats says it's organic
and actually is organic now.

297
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,650
Jesus did I just open up a
fucking can of worms? That one.

298
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:52,980
All these fucking people are just going
to the amount of shit that's going to be

299
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:57,960
written to me and the amount of it
that's going to have liberal or Obama,

300
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,260
I dunno.
You know like what the fuck.

301
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:06,290
I retweeted something the other day about
how they're trying to get rid of a lot

302
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:08,460
of the freedom of speech on the Internet.

303
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,260
You know the amount of racists on there.

304
00:18:10,261 --> 00:18:11,960
I don't know how bad an idea
that would be sometimes,

305
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:14,970
but generally speaking they're
trying to sell it up, right?

306
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:19,260
So it's just really creepy article about
how they're going about doing it and

307
00:18:19,261 --> 00:18:21,030
pushing it through
congress and all this shit.

308
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:25,050
So I retweet it because it's interesting
and I figured maybe somebody smart will

309
00:18:25,051 --> 00:18:27,720
look at it and maybe they can do
something about it because I'm too fucking

310
00:18:27,721 --> 00:18:32,190
stupid. So I retweeted and then
somebody writes back. Right.

311
00:18:32,191 --> 00:18:36,780
So you're surprised that Obama lied.

312
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,760
That's what they write and it's just, I
swear to God, those kinds of comments.

313
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:47,150
I actually feel like those
people who write those a fake,

314
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,990
I don't believe that are actual citizens.

315
00:18:48,991 --> 00:18:53,430
I think they work for the government and
they do that just to start that stupid

316
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:57,570
Republican Democrat arguing with
each other. So nothing gets done.

317
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:03,300
You know what I mean?
It's just the assumption that like,

318
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:05,820
it's like I didn't vote for the guy.

319
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,540
The guy doesn't control the fucking
Internet. He didn't do anything.

320
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:13,530
And the guy fucking makes 400 grand a
fucking year, mixed 400 grand a year.

321
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,320
He set up to be bribed.

322
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:20,850
That's why I don't vote Democrat or
Republican at that level. It's bullshit.

323
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:25,410
It's fucking over. Okay. This
is just really interesting.
This is going to happen.

324
00:19:25,411 --> 00:19:27,870
I'm just trying to get it out
there and you're going to,

325
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:32,160
rather than having people read this and
if it is true and they want to change it

326
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,810
rather than,
than going down that road,

327
00:19:33,811 --> 00:19:38,760
you're going to try to knock it off
fucking course with that bullshit. So, uh,

328
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:39,071
I don't know,

329
00:19:39,071 --> 00:19:41,940
am I going to pat myself on the back
because I actually didn't take the bait

330
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:45,900
probably cause I only have 18 characters
to call this guy at con to whatever the

331
00:19:45,901 --> 00:19:50,640
fuck they give you on, on
Twitter. But, um, I dunno.

332
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,680
Can you do me a favor?
Can somebody just for the,

333
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:57,510
for the love of God start a fucking
movement where people stop doing that

334
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,540
stop fucking gold is because the
Republicans forget it. Silver, right.

335
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:06,670
Your arguments over, um, any, I don't
know what I'm talking about either guys.

336
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:10,110
Right? I'm fucking wiped out
here. Uh, let's, let's do a
little bit of advertising.

337
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:14,790

berries are back. What the hell?

podcast. Oh, Ho Ho, Ho.

399
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:24,560
Geez. Um, well, 24 fucking minutes in
now, right? What does it, I taught, oh,

400
00:24:24,561 --> 00:24:26,610
I gotta tell you this story.
[inaudible] um,

401
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:31,010
New Jersey's own Paul
Versey the pride of, of, uh,

402
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:34,830
what do we say to try it?
Pride of Red Bank. No,

403
00:24:34,831 --> 00:24:38,760
he's too dumb to be in red
bank will say Trenton. Um,

404
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:45,440
we were working in a Portland, Oregon
and we're staying at this fucking hotel.

405
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,930
Right? And, uh,

406
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:54,170
there was some sort of a glee club
convention of people like 50 years,

407
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,640
you know, 40, 50 years old,

408
00:24:56,630 --> 00:25:00,950
like they called themselves
harmony incorporated and
they were having like this

409
00:25:00,951 --> 00:25:02,870
regional,
um,

410
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:07,410
they were having like this regional,
I don't know what this,

411
00:25:07,411 --> 00:25:11,580
this sing off thing between
these different acapella bands,

412
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,990
not banned. They just sing acapella and
every year they have a different theme.

413
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,590
So this year was superheroes.

414
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:24,740
So there's all these old ladies and guys
walking around with Superman capes and

415
00:25:25,081 --> 00:25:27,210
they're harmonizing in the fucking lobby,
right?

416
00:25:27,211 --> 00:25:32,211
So me and Virginia standing
outside smoking these cigars,

417
00:25:32,851 --> 00:25:37,800
right? It's fucking freezing out and shit,
but you can't smoke anywhere anymore.

418
00:25:37,801 --> 00:25:40,590
So we're standing outside smoking these
things and all of a sudden we see this

419
00:25:40,591 --> 00:25:45,180
guy come walking out and he's got like
a wife beater on a beer belly and these

420
00:25:45,181 --> 00:25:48,990
mutton shops as jet black hair
slicked back and a big medallion.

421
00:25:48,991 --> 00:25:51,420
I'm thinking he's coming, he's
an Elvis impersonator, right?

422
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:56,850
Then he comes walking out and turns
out he's like a, he's wolverine from,

423
00:25:56,851 --> 00:25:59,610
uh, from x men. He
didn't have mutton chops.

424
00:25:59,611 --> 00:26:03,600
It went up and around like he had died,
his beard, I guess, I don't know what,

425
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,430
whatever.
And he's got like fucking,

426
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:08,520
he's got this gardener glove with like
three butter knives coming out of it and

427
00:26:08,521 --> 00:26:11,490
he's got this giant cigar and I'm like,
please come out here.

428
00:26:11,491 --> 00:26:12,450
I got to talk to this guy.

429
00:26:12,451 --> 00:26:14,610
So we'd come out there and he
tells us the whole fucking story.

430
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,610
And in the middle of us telling the story,

431
00:26:17,611 --> 00:26:21,150
his wife is bringing the car
around and I swear to God,

432
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:26,810
I said something and I made him laugh
and he farted and he didn't address it.

433
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:27,831
Okay.

434
00:26:27,831 --> 00:26:32,300
He's standing there dressed like wolverine
with these butter knives coming out

435
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:37,040
and he laughed as he was telling this
story and it wasn't just like a quick one.

436
00:26:37,041 --> 00:26:41,540
It went like
sweat a good.

437
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:46,550
I thought he shit himself and he didn't
address it and he's sort of like,

438
00:26:46,711 --> 00:26:51,540
at one point he just started,
he gave one swat behind his ass,

439
00:26:51,541 --> 00:26:53,070
like to make it go away.
And I,

440
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:57,210
I thought he did it with his regular hand
Versie insist that he did it with his

441
00:26:57,211 --> 00:27:00,640
butter knife.
And either way I eat,

442
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:05,610
he didn't address it and I
was sitting there going like,

443
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,170
did he just fart?

444
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,890
Was that version of you fart it and
I fucking looked at VRC in first.

445
00:27:10,891 --> 00:27:11,820
He's looking at me,

446
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:17,340
he just had this look on his face like
this dude just farted and I had my hoodie

447
00:27:17,341 --> 00:27:20,850
up cause it was cold out. I buzzed down
my head so my head was fucking cold.

448
00:27:20,851 --> 00:27:24,510
So I put my hoodie up and my
hoodie up when I was smoking.

449
00:27:24,511 --> 00:27:28,530
When I suffers these face,
I just turned around and would not,

450
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,980
I couldn't look at either one of
them and I was laughing my ass off.

451
00:27:31,981 --> 00:27:33,990
And fortunately his wife pulled up

452
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,110
and I basically,

453
00:27:37,111 --> 00:27:40,890
I left Versie by himself versus he
had to look at this guy and keep the

454
00:27:40,891 --> 00:27:42,510
conversation going after this.

455
00:27:42,511 --> 00:27:47,511
He basically sickly sharded right in
front of us and never addressed it.

456
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:52,020
And so first he tried to say this,
your wife pulling up with the car,

457
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:55,860
but he was laughing. It made no sense.
He just said, oh, there's your wife,

458
00:27:55,861 --> 00:27:59,550
but you never laugh at that because
he just farted. He's like, oh,

459
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:04,500
there's your wife said sound like
he was laughing at his wife, like,

460
00:28:04,501 --> 00:28:08,130
how fucked up she looked, but she didn't.
She was beautiful. And he was like,

461
00:28:08,131 --> 00:28:11,850
all right guys, see you later. And
he waves with, this is butter knives.

462
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:16,300
And he just fucking got in the car
and drove away looking like wolf,

463
00:28:16,301 --> 00:28:19,920
like a fat retired Wolverine.
Oh my God.

464
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:24,010
We fucking laughed our asses off
and we just kept imitating that far.

465
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:30,300
It's like it fucking came
around a corner. Um, anyway,

466
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:33,180
it says gross one. Are we, what are we
doing here on this fucking podcast? Let's,

467
00:28:33,181 --> 00:28:37,470
um, I want, you know what? I just did
one of those city towards here in Albany.

468
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,640
I had my good friend Tom Lewis
come down and he filmed me.

469
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:45,450
I did a tour of this city and that's
one of these, these cities like Buffalo,

470
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,960
like Cleveland, like Detroit,
we use see the beautiful city.

471
00:28:48,961 --> 00:28:51,810
There's just no money
here to get it going.

472
00:28:51,811 --> 00:28:53,940
It's like abandoned buildings
and that type of shit.

473
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:59,550
You get a couple of blocks over. It looks
like you're in a Baltimore, you know,

474
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:05,120
another great city. It's fucking
unbelievable how that happens.

475
00:29:05,121 --> 00:29:06,120
So I guess so out here though,

476
00:29:06,121 --> 00:29:08,640
they're starting to make
more money because they're
working on something called a

477
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:12,270
nano something or other,
I forget what the fuck it is.

478
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:17,790
It's basically shit that they're going
to maybe start putting in food to make it

479
00:29:17,791 --> 00:29:22,620
last even longer. Like preservatives
don't already make it last fucking longer.

480
00:29:22,621 --> 00:29:27,510
I don't, I don't fucking know.
Either way it'll get pushed through.

481
00:29:27,511 --> 00:29:30,540
People will say it's good and then
you'll try it and then some day you'll

482
00:29:30,541 --> 00:29:33,090
fucking, I dunno, one
of your fetal fall off,

483
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,510
which is why I'm just trying
to find some fucking yogurt.

484
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:40,440
Can you just find some yoga? I
can. I get some probiotics in me.

485
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:45,070
I've watched the advertisement. They
got me, they hooked me. All right.

486
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:50,650
But I'm not buying their pill. Fuck
them. All right. I want to buy,

487
00:29:50,651 --> 00:29:52,210
it's just some yogurt.
Can I just get some,

488
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:54,010
can somebody for the love of fucking God,

489
00:29:54,011 --> 00:29:56,890
can somebody help me find
where the fucking food is?

490
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,860
That doesn't kill you. It can somebody
do that as I sit here smoking cigars.

491
00:30:01,861 --> 00:30:05,640
What a fucking hypocrite. Um, all
right, let's, let's read some, uh,

492
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:10,640
some letters for this week.
Um, here we go. Plug caps.

493
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:14,840
Podcast helps me fall
asleep. Um, dear bill,

494
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:17,180
I've been a fan of yours for years.

495
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,270
When you play Cleveland
about six years back,

496
00:30:20,271 --> 00:30:25,000
I met you and you were so personable
and you share this was me. Um,

497
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:28,100
anyways,
I had sleeping issues for years.

498
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:31,870
I discovered your Monday morning
podcast in your old podcast,

499
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:34,430
a uninformed with Joe de Rosa.

500
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:38,930
I listened to them every night and laugh
while your Boston accent and yelling

501
00:30:38,931 --> 00:30:42,260
helps me fall asleep.
That, that's hilarious.

502
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:47,450
And it takes my mind off my day. I just
wanted to say thank you and keep it up.

503
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:52,070
Oh, that was from a lady that
might've been like passive aggressive.

504
00:30:52,071 --> 00:30:55,970
When she's saying like, just so fucking
boring. I fall asleep. Well, uh, you know,

505
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:01,340
either that or you grew up in a household
like mine where everyone was fucking

506
00:31:01,341 --> 00:31:05,900
screaming at each other. I don't
know. Oh, I forgot. I went to the, uh,

507
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:10,280
I went to the Red Sox,
take me out to the ball game.

508
00:31:10,281 --> 00:31:13,310
I went to that red sox
game the day after the, uh,

509
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:17,840
the day after the pine tar incident,
which was so fucking stupid.

510
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:23,490
I mean, you know, it's funny as they
all know that they do it, and I,

511
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:26,720
I guess it's just to get a better
grip on the baseball. So, I mean,

512
00:31:26,721 --> 00:31:29,990
it's cheating because they don't allow it,
but it's not really cheating.

513
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,990
It's actually smart. I mean,
you're thrown an object,

514
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:35,780
like close to a hundred miles an hour.
You could kill somebody

515
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:40,240
if you're having problems gripping
it because it's so fucking cold.

516
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:44,140
Uh, I mean, everybody in
baseball, same pine tar does not,

517
00:31:44,141 --> 00:31:47,930
it doesn't change the
action on the ball. So, uh,

518
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,660
I guess that's why they
have the rosin bag,

519
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:52,480
which is just powder and powder
doesn't work in cold weather.

520
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:57,490
So everybody puts a little glob of
it somewhere. I don't fucking know.

521
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,030
Um,
and I gotta be honest with you,

522
00:32:01,031 --> 00:32:03,790
I finally just watched the video and
everybody's like, oh my God, dude,

523
00:32:03,791 --> 00:32:05,740
it was so obvious. No, it wasn't.

524
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:09,430
It was obvious after they set it
and then everybody's like, dude,

525
00:32:09,431 --> 00:32:12,070
we could fucking see it
from right field now.

526
00:32:12,071 --> 00:32:16,300
You couldn't what after it happened?
Um,

527
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:19,810
didn't, didn't we all cheer when Mark
Mcgwire was hitting the home runs,

528
00:32:19,811 --> 00:32:22,870
we all thought it was great.
We thought he was doing sex to curls.

529
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:26,740
Then all of a sudden he gets busted or
admits to it and then everybody knew,

530
00:32:26,741 --> 00:32:28,870
go fuck yourself.
I was caught up in it.

531
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:33,460
I went down there with Christmas
in my eyes. I thought him and say,

532
00:32:33,461 --> 00:32:36,160
I thought if he did, I thought
no way. Sammy Sosa did.

533
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:39,140
And then once they find more,
both of them broke my heart.

534
00:32:39,141 --> 00:32:43,620
Then I thought everybody did. Um,
so anyways, we went to the, uh,

535
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:48,260
we went to the red sox game and
I went down there with my mom,

536
00:32:48,261 --> 00:32:51,110
took my mom to the game and had
a great time. We got pounded.

537
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:56,750
It's fucking hilarious. It was like
a, I think it was seven to nothing.

538
00:32:56,751 --> 00:32:57,710
After three innings,

539
00:32:57,711 --> 00:33:02,180
we'd already committed two or three hours
committed five for the game by the end

540
00:33:02,181 --> 00:33:02,571
of the game.

541
00:33:02,571 --> 00:33:07,370
Like some utility outfielder came
in and pitched for us and uh,

542
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:10,880
yeah, it was a shit show.
It was like a four hour,

543
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:17,310
four hour fucking game at four and five
minutes or something like that. And uh,

544
00:33:17,311 --> 00:33:21,200
it was freezing cold, but
um, I didn't leave, you know,

545
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:25,250
and I learned that from my mom and I was
there with my mom so we stayed to the

546
00:33:25,251 --> 00:33:26,720
end.
And um,

547
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:28,670
okay.

548
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:32,270
Was unreal.
We ended up walking out and uh,

549
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:35,240
the Bruins game was still
going because it was a,

550
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:39,250
it was an overtime. That's
right. Critical game too.

551
00:33:39,251 --> 00:33:43,960
We didn't want to want let Detroit
back into the series, you know,

552
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:46,390
and tie it up to, to, to this
was to go up three to one.

553
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:50,230
And we were walking back to the car and
we walked by a bar and the Bruins game

554
00:33:50,231 --> 00:33:51,910
was on in there. And I said
to my mom, hey, you want,

555
00:33:51,911 --> 00:33:55,000
you want to dip in there and watch a
little bit of the Bruins? And she's like,

556
00:33:55,001 --> 00:33:58,150
sure. So we walked in there, we will
literally in there for like 90 seconds.

557
00:33:58,151 --> 00:33:59,350
That's all I saw the game,

558
00:33:59,351 --> 00:34:02,680
the final 90 seconds in the Douggie
Hamilton came down and took the shot,

559
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:06,010
killed a tipped it in and everybody
went fucking nuts. And I gotta Tell Ya,

560
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:10,300
I really missed living
back here. Just how, uh,

561
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:13,960
sports crazy it is. And it's the teams
that I love. Like you're literally,

562
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:17,120
you're at the red sox game and out there
they, they, you know, they got the,

563
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:22,300
the old time scoreboard and they
still put the Bruins up there,

564
00:34:23,910 --> 00:34:27,240
you know, instead of first stating it's
first period, second period, third period.

565
00:34:27,241 --> 00:34:30,470
Then it got to the old, uh, the overtime.
And they left it there for a minute.

566
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,760
They like, well we don't have OT.
And somebody finally was like, well,

567
00:34:32,761 --> 00:34:35,940
just put the four up there,
they'll get it. And um,

568
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:40,860
I was a fucking great time.
Hey look, an animal back here,

569
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:45,330
all the fucking places I used to
eat at when I was in my late teens,

570
00:34:45,331 --> 00:34:49,140
early twenties where I could eat that
shit and still wake up with a flat stomach

571
00:34:49,141 --> 00:34:53,520
as opposed to now looking like
a fucking tub of Shit, you know?

572
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:56,850
And uh,
ah fuck.

573
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:00,660
I'm driving back from Albany and I'm
going to hit another spot before I go to

574
00:35:00,661 --> 00:35:02,820
the airport tomorrow.

575
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:06,270
I'm just loading up on it and then I'm
lying to myself that I'm going to eat

576
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:10,950
this fucking yogurt, this probiotic shit
and I'm going to beat down the bad guys.

577
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:13,970
I'd love to know where I'm at right now.

578
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:17,220
But those fucking things I'll
tell you right now. Booze,

579
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:24,950
if booze kills the bad
bacteria in your gut,

580
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:31,470
um, I will never decompose. How
about that? Huh? Um, anyways,

581
00:35:31,471 --> 00:35:32,130
well listen,

582
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:37,130
I'm glad a my podcast helps you a fall
asleep I guess that don't tell the

583
00:35:37,501 --> 00:35:41,040
advertisers that. Um,
yeah, me and Joe Rosa,

584
00:35:41,041 --> 00:35:44,370
we got to get that uninformed
thing going again. He's a,

585
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:46,350
he's a big fancy guy right now.

586
00:35:46,351 --> 00:35:50,760
He's been writing on the wonderful Pete
Holmes show and I think they're wrapping

587
00:35:50,761 --> 00:35:54,930
their series, um, their season,

588
00:35:54,931 --> 00:35:58,590
I should say this week. So
maybe me and Joe will, uh,

589
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:01,830
maybe we'll sit down and maybe we'll
crank an uninformed out. Who knows?

590
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:06,570
I don't want to keep raising up your hopes
because I keep saying that, you know,

591
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,740
like that fucking team that makes the
playoffs every year and then blows it in

592
00:36:10,741 --> 00:36:13,290
the first round. I don't wanna be that.
I kind of have been that way though,

593
00:36:13,291 --> 00:36:16,740
with the uninformed shit
though, so I apologize. Anyways.

594
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:21,120
All right, here's another
one. Bill, can I make it?

595
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:25,350
You guys remember that early 80
[inaudible] that didn't last for too long.

596
00:36:25,351 --> 00:36:30,210
Making it bake it, it
teeth. We'd done a bad blah.

597
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,580
We stomped and

598
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:36,490
day we did there Dan.
We blab, Blab, La Bake,

599
00:36:36,491 --> 00:36:37,630
baking it,

600
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:43,200
these turbid life.
I take it is a filter come people no more,

601
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:47,640
no more faking it.
I watched every episode you ever do that?

602
00:36:47,641 --> 00:36:51,750
You ever watch like every episode of a
failed sit calm and when it fails you

603
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:52,980
kind of feel like you failed.

604
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,950
Like I'm the only idiot
that was watching this shit.

605
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:01,140
I watched hello Larry every
episode of that and I loved it.

606
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:05,040
They fucking took that off.
I watched every episode of making it

607
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:10,580
my two dads.
That's actually an interesting one.

608
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:13,820
Joanie loves Chachi. I
watched every episode of that
and they just fucking made,

609
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:15,800
it just made me feel dumb.

610
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:21,230
Then I lost all my TV watching self esteem
and I just waited until find out what

611
00:37:21,231 --> 00:37:22,064
they hits were.

612
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:27,140
Then I would just bandwagon on like
cheers moonlighting in that type of shit.

613
00:37:27,141 --> 00:37:27,974
Back in the day,

614
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:32,660
how awful was Bruce Willis his
haircut in fucking moonlighting?

615
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:36,290
He was doing all he could fucking do.
He was starting to lose it.

616
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:41,410
He had like the Fonzi ducktail duck tail
or the da in the back and then on top,

617
00:37:42,261 --> 00:37:46,020
I don't know what the fuck he was
doing. He was poofing it up. Um,

618
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:48,500
either like a balding vampire.

619
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,073
Okay.

620
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:58,080
Okay. Anyways, a bill. Can I make it?

621
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,310
It was like a fucking disco ball
and shit in the beginning of it.

622
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,890
Did somebody find that?
I've actually tried to find it on youtube.

623
00:38:04,891 --> 00:38:06,540
I want to say a found at one time,
but I've,

624
00:38:06,541 --> 00:38:08,490
I've looked it up when
imdv I can't find it.

625
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:13,050
I know that the theme song was making it,
I think it was,

626
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:17,640
and I want to say the star of the show
actually sang the song so he would've got

627
00:38:17,641 --> 00:38:22,030
fucking paid that. That's a show
Biz thing you might not know.

628
00:38:22,031 --> 00:38:22,864
Show me is there,

629
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:27,900
you might not know that if you write the
song like the theme song to the show,

630
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,650
like you get paid every time they
fucking play it. I lost him as that.

631
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:37,460
That's why Merv Griffin, you know,
not only did he write those games,

632
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:41,200
you know, create all those game shows,
like wheel of fortune and jeopardy.

633
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:44,980
He actually wrote like,
you know when you're thinking of shit,

634
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:46,550
that Song Doodoo

635
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:48,370
Doo Doo Doo Doo

636
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:52,060
dude, that fucking thing. He wrote
that. So every time they played it,

637
00:38:52,061 --> 00:38:54,990
he got paid again.
Do you think you,

638
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,790
you think you have enough musical ability
to come up with something like that?

639
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,140
Doo Doo,
Doo Doo Doo dude.

640
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,830
Do. How far into it could you get? We
actually good enough to come up with

641
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:09,010
du Du, Du, Du, Du, Du, du Du du Du,

642
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:13,680
right. That's, that's, that's, that's
what makes everybody, that's the hook.

643
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:16,860
Du Du, Du, Du, Du. And then you go, oh,

644
00:39:16,861 --> 00:39:20,280
I remember that part from the beginning
and then you're fucking in there.

645
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:26,100
It's genius. What a giant head. That
guy had no money. We were so smart.

646
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:30,060
You know,
he must had a huge fucking brain.

647
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:33,660
I bet the bad bacteria is still
munching away on that one, Huh?

648
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:39,570
[inaudible] that's awful. Um,
can I make it? Hi there bill.

649
00:39:39,571 --> 00:39:44,040
My name is Ben and I'm from
Israel. No, you're not.

650
00:39:44,041 --> 00:39:45,690
There's nobody named Ben from Israel.

651
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:46,810
Hmm.

652
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:48,430
Ben's we'll visit Israel.

653
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:53,360
I thought that was like an American name.
Like Ben Franklin.

654
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:00,000
You know, sometimes I notice how dumb I
am. That was one of those moments. Sorry,

655
00:40:00,001 --> 00:40:01,070
Ben from Israel.
All right.

656
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:06,110
I'm 33 years old of Florida and I've
recently decided my dream is to work in

657
00:40:06,361 --> 00:40:09,420
comedy. I've written a lot
of funny bits, but sadly,

658
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:14,550
the standup scene isn't very developed
here. I'm also not a funny guy.

659
00:40:14,551 --> 00:40:19,410
He put in quotes,
so I feel it might not be for me to,

660
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:22,600
uh, might not be a, I'm going
to try to correct this is not,

661
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:25,770
might not be basically my path to perform,

662
00:40:25,771 --> 00:40:30,360
even though I write some funny shit.
How do you recommend I approached this,

663
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,593
uh,

664
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:36,540
practice the only open mic and Israel
filled with Weirdos and only once a week,

665
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:40,680
uh, get a funny actor
friend to do my material,

666
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:44,040
find amateur nights.
I don't want to waste any more time.

667
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:48,690
I want to make some sort of
career from comedy. Um, all right,

668
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:52,650
well, unfortunately, sir, you
can't rush these kinds of things.

669
00:40:52,651 --> 00:40:56,400
I would do all of that. Um, but the,

670
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:58,110
the advantage that you have,

671
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:01,410
because I know you want to do this quickly
because you feel like you're 33 years

672
00:41:01,411 --> 00:41:04,470
old and you've got to, you got
a kid, you gotta you gotta make,

673
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:09,380
make something happen here. Um, you're,

674
00:41:09,381 --> 00:41:11,450
you're,
you're actually advanced in that you,

675
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,840
you understand your strengths and your
weaknesses and you're trying to see if

676
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:20,530
you can work on your weaknesses to maybe
perform or go to your strength and have

677
00:41:20,531 --> 00:41:25,120
somebody else perform it for
you. I would try, um, look,

678
00:41:25,121 --> 00:41:29,190
the open mic is only once a week. So
what the fuck? What does that take it?

679
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,330
That's one night out of the week.
All right?

680
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:35,690
The rest of the time you can
try other, you can try, um,

681
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:40,700
making youtube videos,
you can try writing scripts,

682
00:41:40,701 --> 00:41:43,870
you can try all of that shit. And the
great thing about show business is a,

683
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:48,440
you just start doing it and then you're
in the business and if you don't stop,

684
00:41:48,441 --> 00:41:52,010
eventually you will start making money.
If you write something that people,

685
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:55,430
that appeals to people but you never
going to know unless you do it. Um,

686
00:41:56,420 --> 00:42:01,040
my biggest advice I would give you is
quit thinking about the fact that you're

687
00:42:01,041 --> 00:42:05,930
33 years old and focus more on the
fact that it's a dream that you wanted,

688
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:10,170
that you know, that you
want to achieve. And, um,

689
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:15,640
you got to go after that stuff in life
or else you're going to have regret. Um,

690
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:20,270
what you don't want, you know. So I
would just, I would focus on that.

691
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:25,100
Don't quit your day job as they say. Just
keep doing that. So everything's good.

692
00:42:25,101 --> 00:42:27,650
And then as you start
making more money in comedy,

693
00:42:27,651 --> 00:42:31,100
eventually you transitioned over.
That's all there is to it.

694
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:34,730
So all I got to really say as graduations,
Ben, welcome to the world comedy.

695
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:38,240
Have a good fucking time and don't
be too hard on yourself. All right.

696
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:42,470
Stay away from the Kuntz
negative people and uh, you know,

697
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:48,590
I dunno, there's no comedy
scene over there so you can
create one. How about that?

698
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:52,580
They get Gulf. Jesus Christ has got to
be plenty of shit to talk about there.

699
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:56,930
All that stuff going on. Huh?
You know what she should do?

700
00:42:56,931 --> 00:43:01,931
Why don't you start a fucking in
Israeli Palestinian comedy night?

701
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:04,320
You know,

702
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:08,330
you guys all hang out and get along and
then they can do a local piece going,

703
00:43:08,331 --> 00:43:08,811
you know,

704
00:43:08,811 --> 00:43:13,811
maybe politically leads still sides
don't get along well when it comes to

705
00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:17,270
laughing.
They all speak the same language.

706
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:20,090
My name is Susie Sunquest.

707
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:23,860
Here's my cleavage and I'm standing in
front of the first comedy club and his

708
00:43:23,861 --> 00:43:27,140
meal. Let's go over and talk to Ben. Ben,

709
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:28,910
how did you come up with,

710
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:34,540
did comedy with your mortal enemy? Yeah.
You know, fucking things right there.

711
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:38,410
It's wide open. It's wide open.
It's like when Vegas first starts,

712
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:42,640
they're waiting for you to
open the casino. Alright,

713
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:48,070
there you go. All right. What
do we got here? Girlfriends.

714
00:43:48,071 --> 00:43:49,300
Withdrawal.

715
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:54,810
She's withdrawing dear bill Nye the
illiterate guy and you know it's funny.

716
00:43:55,810 --> 00:43:58,990
That's a funny joke and I blew it because
I can't read out loud because I'm kind

717
00:43:58,991 --> 00:44:01,870
of illiterate.
Dear Bill Nye the literate guy,

718
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:05,740
a big fan of your podcast.
Looking forward to others.

719
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,270
I'll get right to it.

720
00:44:07,330 --> 00:44:11,320
My girlfriend and I have
a very active sex life.

721
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:15,460
We've been trying to say, we've
been trying to stay, sorry.

722
00:44:15,461 --> 00:44:18,700
I'm still thinking of why that green
thumb made me laugh and I'm not going to

723
00:44:18,701 --> 00:44:23,140
fucking tell you why. I'm a big fan of
his specials. Looking forward to others.

724
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:24,011
I'll get right to it.

725
00:44:24,011 --> 00:44:28,210
My girlfriend and I have have a very
active sex life and we've been trying to

726
00:44:28,211 --> 00:44:33,090
stay safe during and she
recently suggest during what?

727
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:37,560
And she recently suggested that we
withhold from sex until she obtains birth

728
00:44:37,561 --> 00:44:39,720
control. Well, Jesus Christ. Yes.

729
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:45,830
My issue is that the apartment
is a month and a half away.

730
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,480
Oh, Jesus Christ. Dude,
fucking rub one out.

731
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:53,390
Said my bs meter is going crazy on this.

732
00:44:53,391 --> 00:44:55,550
All of a sudden we can't
use a condom anymore.

733
00:44:56,150 --> 00:44:59,510
Do you think this is caused from more
concern or am I just being paranoid?

734
00:44:59,511 --> 00:45:02,150
Thanks in advance and go fuck
yourself. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

735
00:45:03,770 --> 00:45:06,760
That's interesting. I didn't even look
at it that way. Let me reread this. Uh,

736
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,130
my girlfriend,
I have a very active sex life.

737
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:13,040
We've been trying to stay
safe during this time.

738
00:45:13,041 --> 00:45:16,520
She recently suggested that we withhold
from sex until she obtains birth control.

739
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:21,080
All right. And then it's a month and
a half away. My bs meters going crazy.

740
00:45:21,081 --> 00:45:24,110
All of a sudden we can't use
even use a condom anymore. No,

741
00:45:24,111 --> 00:45:25,700
I don't think that's cause for concern.

742
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:28,163
Okay.

743
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:29,580
What do you think?
What do you think she's doing?

744
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:31,150
Yeah.

745
00:45:31,150 --> 00:45:33,400
That's not cause for
concern. That's a, you know,

746
00:45:33,401 --> 00:45:36,130
you will get in the cookie and now she
took the cookies away and you're kind of

747
00:45:36,131 --> 00:45:36,964
upset about it.

748
00:45:37,870 --> 00:45:38,730
MMM.

749
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:42,860
I Dunno. You're a young guy,
so you want to fuck every day.

750
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:46,010
And I imagine a month and a half
seems like a million miles away.

751
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,100
I'm an older guy, so I'm like, yeah,
I'll give a shit joke off like twice.

752
00:45:49,101 --> 00:45:49,970
I can do six weeks.

753
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:56,080
Okay.

754
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:58,450
Um, no I wouldn't, she might have.

755
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:03,580
Maybe one of her friends had an issue
and it scared the shit out of her and I

756
00:46:03,581 --> 00:46:08,140
don't know what, but, um, what
I would do is I would sit down

757
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:09,740
okay.

758
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:13,550
And talk to her about it without being
accusatory. And I would just say, listen,

759
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:17,870
I just want to talk to you about, uh, the
whole birth control thing if we could.

760
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:21,920
And there's nothing women enjoy
better than that guy actually saying,

761
00:46:21,950 --> 00:46:24,590
I would like to sit down and
discuss something in a relationship.

762
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:28,430
They love doing that. At least
the ones that Ma, you know,

763
00:46:28,910 --> 00:46:31,760
unless they're wired like a guy and if
they get it, they're like, oh my God,

764
00:46:31,761 --> 00:46:36,020
shut up and just say,
listen, you know, we've

765
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:40,740
Ben, obviously we've had a great sex
life. Yeah. And you know, I love you.

766
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:45,450
You got to do that bullshit. That's like
the beginning of a sweet chili welcome.

767
00:46:45,451 --> 00:46:48,630
Everybody laggy you for copy because
this is an auditive they out here.

768
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:51,660
That's what you're doing. You know I love
you. You're beautiful. Yeah, we'll, we'll,

769
00:46:51,661 --> 00:46:53,760
we'll, and then you get to the
fucking point. Just say, listen,

770
00:46:53,761 --> 00:46:56,520
we had a very active sex life.
We've been using a condom,

771
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,750
nothing's ever happened and
all of a sudden I understand
you want to be on birth

772
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:05,040
control, which is cool. I'm just
making sure if there's no other issue.

773
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:06,270
Yeah.

774
00:47:06,270 --> 00:47:07,260
MMM.

775
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:08,960
You know,
because you know,

776
00:47:08,961 --> 00:47:13,440
I find you really attractive as
six weeks is a long ways away at a,

777
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:16,130
I was just wondering why we
couldn't continue to use a condom.

778
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:19,040
I'm not pressuring you.
I'm just asking

779
00:47:21,050 --> 00:47:23,900
cause I really want to fuck you.
No, don't say that last part.

780
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:25,423
That's what I would do.

781
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:31,760
You Scots to sit and talk to
your bitch, motherfucker. Um,

782
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:35,020
I'm married,
I'm not dead.

783
00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:39,820
Dare bill bill the beguiling.
I don't even know what that means.

784
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,430
You know what's funny
you guys all the time.

785
00:47:42,431 --> 00:47:44,890
I'll writing in it and saying how
good I am at giving out advice.

786
00:47:44,891 --> 00:47:48,460
I am the classic person that's good at
giving out advice in that I give out

787
00:47:48,461 --> 00:47:53,110
great advice and then continue to walk
around and being a complete fucking idiot.

788
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:57,120
You know,
I got it.

789
00:47:57,190 --> 00:47:59,860
I got everything that I just
said to that fucking guy.

790
00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:02,950
I should be saying to myself,
why don't I do that?

791
00:48:02,951 --> 00:48:07,520
Why don't I sit down and just say, hey,
you know, I love you and I think you'd go,

792
00:48:07,521 --> 00:48:10,790
I just want to thank you for being here.
Come together as a evening

793
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:18,040
and then just be able to calmly,

794
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:24,000
I dunno, I got to get rid of this
fucking anchorman. It's, it's,

795
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:27,660
I got to get rid of this shit. You
know, I don't have to get rid of it,

796
00:48:27,661 --> 00:48:30,210
but it can't be the
default fucking emotion.

797
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:35,130
Like when I was driving across from
mine and New Hampshire down to Portland,

798
00:48:35,131 --> 00:48:40,131
Maine going across route to the amount
of times a mild heart attack is,

799
00:48:42,511 --> 00:48:46,290
I'm flipping out about the douchebag
driving in front of me only to finally,

800
00:48:46,291 --> 00:48:47,610
you know,
when it becomes two lanes,

801
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:52,590
go past them and see it's a cute little
old lady and that's why they're driving

802
00:48:52,591 --> 00:48:56,040
slow. You think I would learn
the lesson like, oh, you know,

803
00:48:56,041 --> 00:48:59,190
there's some old people out here, Bill,
why don't you relax the Serb country?

804
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:03,630
They do things a little slower
up here. You know, I did.

805
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:07,410
I just kept making the same mistake over
and fucking over again driving like a

806
00:49:07,411 --> 00:49:09,510
maniac.
You know,

807
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:14,340
I made the decision to get off the
fucking highway. You know what happens?

808
00:49:14,341 --> 00:49:17,160
You know you're going to end up behind
some pickup truck pulling a couple of

809
00:49:17,161 --> 00:49:22,140
fucking horses for a good hour and
I still got mad at me. I'm an idiot.

810
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:23,430
I really have to conquer that.

811
00:49:23,431 --> 00:49:26,760
If anybody knows how to fucking I go
through ebbs and flows where I'll be,

812
00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:30,600
my anger issues will be way,
way better.

813
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:37,090
The end. They're still
completely unacceptable as
far as he likes to say. Um,

814
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:43,300
but then, then they start ramping up again
and it's just a fucking embarrassing.

815
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:47,470
All right. Anyways, I'm married.
I'm not dead deer build a beguiling.

816
00:49:47,471 --> 00:49:52,340
What the fuck does that mean?
Look at that like right there.

817
00:49:52,341 --> 00:49:54,200
What the fuck does that mean? Why
couldn't I have been like, oh,

818
00:49:54,201 --> 00:49:59,090
I wonder what that means. Oh, a new
world, new word, new worlds, new word.

819
00:49:59,220 --> 00:49:59,840
And this is,

820
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:04,580
this is just a wonderful opportunity
to learn something here in my own point

821
00:50:04,581 --> 00:50:06,950
cans and you know, and you
know, he learned a lot.

822
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:10,550
I looked Jaycees much remain
leaking urine. Why do you,
why can I do that? Right?

823
00:50:10,551 --> 00:50:11,384
But guile,

824
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:16,340
charm or enhance parentheses,

825
00:50:16,341 --> 00:50:19,760
someone sometime in a deceptive way.

826
00:50:21,290 --> 00:50:23,960
Okay. So this is sort of a
compliment, but not really.

827
00:50:26,030 --> 00:50:28,100
Okay, here we go. Now, recently

828
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:32,600
I've been talking to a friend
that I haven't heard from
in a while via Facebook.

829
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:36,620
Oh, here we go. Uh,

830
00:50:36,621 --> 00:50:40,670
we continued to talk and catch up and
I found out he is married and has a two

831
00:50:40,671 --> 00:50:44,600
year old.
While that's fucking hilarious.

832
00:50:44,601 --> 00:50:46,310
That should come out immediately.

833
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:50,160
All right.
While away someone,

834
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:56,820
he asked me to wait while away somewhere.
Oh,

835
00:50:56,821 --> 00:51:00,660
when he was on the Internet, he asked
me to send him some sexy pictures.

836
00:51:01,830 --> 00:51:04,100
See right there.
The fact that you had to,

837
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:07,890
we went back and forth a
number of times before.

838
00:51:07,891 --> 00:51:10,440
He said he's married and has a
two year old. That's not a good,

839
00:51:10,441 --> 00:51:13,440
that should be immediately, boom.
He's supposed to do that immediately.

840
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:16,140
I'm married. Boom. Done. All right,

841
00:51:16,141 --> 00:51:19,740
so this doesn't go on a weird fucking
way because we used to fuck right.

842
00:51:19,770 --> 00:51:23,010
Isn't that what's supposed to
happen? Um, and he said, I said,

843
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:27,390
I said no and responded,
aren't you married? He replied,

844
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:31,200
I'm married. I'm not dead. God.

845
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:34,770
He's also been flirting with me a lot.

846
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:40,460
I think it's disrespectful to his wife
and to ask me for something like that

847
00:51:41,191 --> 00:51:42,690
when I'm sure it would,

848
00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:50,180
it would help his marriage by making
her feel attractive. If he asked her

849
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:56,400
what, this was such an interesting
email. Did I read it wrong?

850
00:51:56,550 --> 00:52:01,050
I think it is disrespectful to his wife
to ask me for something like that when

851
00:52:01,051 --> 00:52:01,920
I'm sure it would.

852
00:52:02,970 --> 00:52:06,120
I'm just gonna say what and wouldn't
help his marriage by making her feel

853
00:52:06,121 --> 00:52:08,760
attractive.
I'm sure it would help his Oh,

854
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:12,990
help his marriage if he asked her
to send him some pictures. Uh, okay.

855
00:52:12,991 --> 00:52:17,670
Some sexy pictures. See she said, I also
think the flirting is disrespectful. Um,

856
00:52:17,671 --> 00:52:22,020
a lady, by the way. What do you think? Um,

857
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:27,020
well yeah, you're obviously
right, but I am also wanting,

858
00:52:27,021 --> 00:52:28,850
why do you continue to talk to this guy?

859
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:35,500
You reached out to him. You
didn't know he was married. Okay.

860
00:52:35,501 --> 00:52:37,000
He doesn't say he's married.

861
00:52:37,890 --> 00:52:38,220
Yeah.

862
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:42,240
So it starts to, obviously it started to
go down, so I know. No, no, no, no, no.

863
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:45,990
And then he's, then you find out he was
married, had a two year old. All right.

864
00:52:45,991 --> 00:52:49,290
So he keeps it going.
And then when he's away,

865
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:54,291
he asked you to send him
some sexy pictures and you
responded and you said No.

866
00:52:54,541 --> 00:52:57,240
And you said, aren't you married? You knew
he was married. He said he was married.

867
00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:01,380
Why did you keep hanging around and
now he's continuing to flirt with you.

868
00:53:01,381 --> 00:53:05,190
Why are you still talking to this guy?
What's going on with you?

869
00:53:08,050 --> 00:53:11,200
Yeah. Why? Why are you, why are
you continuing to talk to this guy?

870
00:53:11,201 --> 00:53:13,510
This is a no brainer. Yeah.
He shouldn't be doing this.

871
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:15,110
Okay.

872
00:53:15,110 --> 00:53:18,790
This is completely not what you
supposed to be doing if you are married.

873
00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:22,520
All right. I'm not judging
anybody in this fucking thing.

874
00:53:22,521 --> 00:53:24,770
I'm just saying that he
shouldn't be doing that.

875
00:53:25,350 --> 00:53:29,610
And if you're offended by it,
you shouldn't continue to talk to the guy.

876
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:35,330
So, okay. So I guess, okay,

877
00:53:35,331 --> 00:53:37,250
so wait, so he doesn't, you
don't send them the pictures,

878
00:53:37,251 --> 00:53:41,630
but you continue to talk to him then
he's been flirting with you and you just

879
00:53:41,631 --> 00:53:46,330
think it's disrespectful?
Uh, yeah. I mean I don't,

880
00:53:46,331 --> 00:53:49,630
yeah. Yeah. It's, it's
disrespectful because

881
00:53:51,790 --> 00:53:53,770
he already said the sexy pictures thing,

882
00:53:53,771 --> 00:53:56,020
so it already brought
it into a bad fucking,

883
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:57,430
yeah.

884
00:53:57,430 --> 00:53:59,620
This guy would bang you if
you'd let them basically.

885
00:53:59,621 --> 00:54:04,120
So he already brought it into a bad area.
Um,

886
00:54:04,510 --> 00:54:09,250
do I think flirting is disrespectful
online? Absolutely. If you're at work.

887
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:14,980
I mean, I don't give a shit. You
know what? I Made Jesus Christ.

888
00:54:14,981 --> 00:54:18,500
We're at work.
I don't know.

889
00:54:18,501 --> 00:54:23,480
It depends on the level of it, but you
know, what are you suppose to fucking do?

890
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:27,580
Like I'm not one of those guys. If
I drive down the street, okay, look,

891
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,270
I gotta tell you this.
When I was in la,

892
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:30,750
yeah,

893
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:35,750
I was at a stoplight by myself
and this dude jogging by,

894
00:54:35,970 --> 00:54:38,460
I swear to God,
he looked like,

895
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:42,750
like marvel comics couldn't
draw a more jacked guy.

896
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:46,140
Like I looked at him and I went,
Jesus Christ,

897
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:50,070
his back was shredded.

898
00:54:50,610 --> 00:54:55,610
The guy had no fat on him whatsoever
and he's jogging down the street,

899
00:54:56,130 --> 00:55:00,240
no shirt on, no nothing. I mean, this guy
must be fucking everything in Hollywood.

900
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:05,450
Even. I'm sitting there going, Jesus
Christ. Now, if my wife was there, I I,

901
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:07,620
what am I going to do?
He wins.

902
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:13,820
I'll tell you right now, if I ran
down the street with my shirt off,

903
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:19,220
that would be the end of my career.
So what am I going to do?

904
00:55:19,221 --> 00:55:24,221
I'm going to get mad that she's looking
at this fucking statute was God damn

905
00:55:24,711 --> 00:55:29,210
Greek. God running down the
fucking street, Greek God
via Africa. You know what?

906
00:55:29,211 --> 00:55:32,420
I want to go, Hey, what the fuck? I don't
give a shit. I really don't give a shit.

907
00:55:33,670 --> 00:55:33,990
Okay.

908
00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:36,540
I don't,
I don't know.

909
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:39,240
You don't want to talk to me when
it comes to this stipend, it's,

910
00:55:39,290 --> 00:55:41,490
it's one of these,
when I look at that stuff,

911
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:46,080
like I always look at it like it
shouldn't be done. It's the Chris Rock,

912
00:55:46,081 --> 00:55:47,910
but you shouldn't do it.
But I understand

913
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:54,330
it's fucking a that. That's why
the Internet, it's terrible.

914
00:55:55,020 --> 00:56:00,020
It's terrible when it comes to that shit
because back in the day you wouldn't be

915
00:56:00,211 --> 00:56:01,140
able to get in touch.

916
00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:06,120
Tom Green has this fucking unbelievable
bid on this watch is special.

917
00:56:06,121 --> 00:56:07,830
I hope he did his bid on Facebook.
He,

918
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:10,240
he does this fucking
unbelievable bid on it. Yeah.

919
00:56:11,570 --> 00:56:11,930
Yeah.

920
00:56:11,930 --> 00:56:16,760
Well, it's just, it's just there.
It's just fucking there. It's,

921
00:56:16,761 --> 00:56:19,400
it's harder than ever. Not to fuck
around. I guess. I don't know.

922
00:56:19,430 --> 00:56:23,640
But is he doing something wrong?
Yeah, but your co I don't why you,

923
00:56:24,430 --> 00:56:27,460
I would ask yourself why you're still a,

924
00:56:28,730 --> 00:56:31,970
you're still talking to the
person. I mean, you reached out.

925
00:56:32,030 --> 00:56:34,820
That's what I'm guessing you reached out
to them because you're single right now

926
00:56:34,821 --> 00:56:38,360
is what I'm guessing this was somebody
maybe you had a fling with back in the

927
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:43,290
day or a, you know, maybe
you always want it to,

928
00:56:43,291 --> 00:56:44,550
when you reached out,

929
00:56:46,810 --> 00:56:49,440
maybe that's what you're doing and
then all of a sudden, you know,

930
00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:52,270
you find out he's married and has a kid
and then they all of a sudden he shows

931
00:56:52,271 --> 00:56:55,780
that he would fuck around on his wife
and you're like, wow, this isn't,

932
00:56:55,781 --> 00:56:56,680
the guy thought he was.

933
00:56:56,681 --> 00:57:00,730
So you continued to do more follow up
questions just so you in your own way.

934
00:57:00,731 --> 00:57:03,480
You can get this guy out of your head
because you've seen what a dirt bag is.

935
00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:08,500
I got to tell you this, I'm married, I'm
not dead, is a fucking terrible line.

936
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:12,460
That's the line you say to
your guy friend in the bar,

937
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:14,893
you know,

938
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:18,150
and she fucking says blah, blah,
blah, blah. I'm like, you know,

939
00:57:18,510 --> 00:57:20,850
can't believe she said that. I mean,
I'm fucking married. I'm not dead.

940
00:57:20,851 --> 00:57:23,280
That's something you see to what gain.
I say that to a woman. Jesus Christ.

941
00:57:23,281 --> 00:57:27,030
That's terrible.
That's just blunt force trauma of truth.

942
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:31,290
It's a one two punch. He shouldn't
have done that. All right. Whatever.

943
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:34,350
I don't know what to tell you.
I would just say stop talking to them.

944
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:38,630
Does that work? Does that work for
you? I don't fucking know. All right,

945
00:57:38,670 --> 00:57:43,650
so somehow I've limped my way through
this podcast. Oh Jesus Christ.

946
00:57:43,651 --> 00:57:48,210
I have more fucking advertising to re I
forgot. Hang on a second. Hi. Hang on.

947
00:57:48,211 --> 00:57:51,690
Hang on. Hang on. All right, here we go.
And then I'll tell you another story.

948
00:57:51,691 --> 00:57:54,000

973
00:59:27,650 --> 00:59:30,260
one of our favorites, dollar
shave club, everybody,

974
00:59:30,470 --> 00:59:34,820
nothing feels better than that first shave
with a fresh blade, right? It's smooth,

975
00:59:34,970 --> 00:59:39,830
it's close and the blade is as sharp
as it's ever going to be. God dammit.

976
00:59:39,831 --> 00:59:43,370
It feels fantastic,
but thanks to the shape company,

977
00:59:43,850 --> 00:59:47,410
ridiculous prices. You can't afford to
get a fresh blade every week canyon,

978
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:49,160
so you dragged that damn blade,

979
00:59:49,161 --> 00:59:53,090
that dull ass blade across your face
for two weeks, three weeks, 10 weeks.

980
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:55,010
Why do you keep doing that to yourself?

981
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:58,310
Maybe because the only thing more
painful than shaving with an old blade is

982
00:59:58,311 --> 01:00:01,340
shelling out 30 bucks for
a pack of new ones. Well,

983
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:03,650
if you want to enjoy a
fresh blade every week,

984
01:00:03,651 --> 01:00:06,020
but you don't want to take out
a second mortgage on your house,

985
01:00:06,021 --> 01:00:09,650
you got to join dollar shave club.com
for just a couple bucks a month.

986
01:00:09,890 --> 01:00:14,790
Dollar shape.com ships me
the highest quality blades
you can get. Um, a for Glade,

987
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:17,960
a blade guy,
and with dollar shave club,

988
01:00:17,961 --> 01:00:22,040
it's only six bucks for a four pack.
I actually like two blades,

989
01:00:22,041 --> 01:00:25,500
but they don't make those anymore.
At least I don't have the razor.

990
01:00:25,501 --> 01:00:26,960
So I used three seriously.

991
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:29,540
Only six bucks for the best
quality blades you can get.

992
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:33,920
So every week I can pop in a fresh blade
and treat myself to an amazing shave.

993
01:00:33,921 --> 01:00:35,720
It's incredible.
Um,

994
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:39,800
Dell Shave club.com gets amazing quality
blades in the mail for a couple bucks

995
01:00:39,950 --> 01:00:42,230
and treat yourself to a brand
new blade every single week.

996
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:43,370
Why wouldn't you do that?

997
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:46,190
Your face is going to love your hundreds
of thousands of guys have upgraded to

The youtube videos of the week.
Um, this is the one I got.

1028
01:02:20,821 --> 01:02:23,370
You guys got to look at this one,
six year old boxer.

1029
01:02:24,390 --> 01:02:26,010
This kid is fucking incredible.

1030
01:02:26,490 --> 01:02:29,940
His Dad is an amazing trainer and he
has this kid. The guy's hilarious.

1031
01:02:29,941 --> 01:02:32,480
He's like a, he's basically teaching
everybody else in the neighborhood.

1032
01:02:32,481 --> 01:02:35,370
I had a box and he's like,
well great. So now what?

1033
01:02:35,371 --> 01:02:37,650
They're all going to beat the shit
out of my kid. I don't think so.

1034
01:02:37,950 --> 01:02:40,620
So He's been training.
This kid had a box and I'm telling you,

1035
01:02:41,130 --> 01:02:45,300
this kid is throwing man
punches at six years of age.

1036
01:02:45,301 --> 01:02:48,750
He's popping the, you know those, you
know the pads that these guys put on

1037
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:55,700
God help
a six year old that fucks with this kid.

1038
01:02:55,701 --> 01:02:58,490
They are going to be in trouble.
He's slipping punches,

1039
01:02:58,820 --> 01:03:01,190
he's throwing combination
and then jump it back.

1040
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:03,590
All that shit that I still suck at it.
I swear to God,

1041
01:03:03,650 --> 01:03:05,810
this kid just wound up and
punched me in the face.

1042
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:10,320
I would be in trouble if he
caught me in the perfect spot.

1043
01:03:10,321 --> 01:03:12,890
He probably knocked me up.
I got to you gotta see this,

1044
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:15,380
this kid is absolutely adorable.

1045
01:03:15,740 --> 01:03:18,620
It's funny because like he's
into like six year old stuff.

1046
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:20,630
Like he likes Mike Tyson.

1047
01:03:20,631 --> 01:03:25,250
Mike Tyson is his favorite
and he basically likes him
because Mike had a tiger

1048
01:03:25,251 --> 01:03:28,610
and he wants to get a tiger, like how
adorable is and you're like, oh my God,

1049
01:03:28,611 --> 01:03:32,780
this kid's fucking adorable. He's
missing one front tooth, cute little kid.

1050
01:03:32,810 --> 01:03:37,610
And then he puts on the boxing gloves.
You like, God Damn Jesus Christ,

1051
01:03:38,150 --> 01:03:42,070
this kid would fuck me up. So you
definitely got to check that out. And um,

1052
01:03:43,550 --> 01:03:46,340
I think that's it. That's gonna be the
podcast for this week. Hey, if you guys,

1053
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:47,570
seriously,
I know I was fucking around,

1054
01:03:47,571 --> 01:03:51,620
but if you guys know any way that I can
figure out what is really organic shit

1055
01:03:51,621 --> 01:03:52,161
and what isn't,

1056
01:03:52,161 --> 01:03:56,090
because I even know if those farmer's
markets that a lot of that stuff is from

1057
01:03:56,091 --> 01:04:00,390
corporate farms and they just write a
bunch of horse shit on it. So you know,

1058
01:04:00,410 --> 01:04:02,120
you might as well just
go to the grocery store.

1059
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:07,110
I don't understand why and I guess money,
why they're so hell bent on fucking

1060
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:11,790
doing that to the food. But
whatever. You know, the older I get,

1061
01:04:11,791 --> 01:04:13,500
the harder it is for me to stay in shape.

1062
01:04:13,501 --> 01:04:16,890
So I got to try to make sure a plus with
all the cigar smoking in that I got to

1063
01:04:16,891 --> 01:04:20,400
try to do something. All right, so if you
can help me out, I would appreciate it.

1064
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:24,120
Um, anyways, I'm going
to keep watching the, um,

1065
01:04:25,290 --> 01:04:27,580
the NHL playoffs. I know
it's hard. In the NBA verse,

1066
01:04:27,581 --> 01:04:31,070
he told me I was full of Shit.
He said the Memphis Grizzlies and uh,

1067
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:35,760
Mama said Oklahoma. Sooners it's a
little, I watch basketball, the uh,

1068
01:04:36,810 --> 01:04:41,500
Oklahoma Thunder, right?
Oklahoma City Thunder,

1069
01:04:43,690 --> 01:04:47,350
the Tulsa turbulence, whatever. I heard
that that series is fucking amazing.

1070
01:04:47,351 --> 01:04:50,170
I actually really like Oklahoma.
Uh, I like Kevin Durant.

1071
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:55,560
He's my favorite player in the NBA
when I actually watch all right there.

1072
01:04:56,530 --> 01:04:59,050
Maybe I'll put on some NBA now.
Maybe I'll watch the late game.

1073
01:04:59,051 --> 01:05:02,260
Who the fuck knows? That's it. That's a
podcast for this week. Go fuck yourselves.

1074
01:05:02,261 --> 01:05:04,690
I apologize that it took me
so long to upload this thing.

1075
01:05:04,691 --> 01:05:09,691
Hopefully tomorrow I can find a God damn
radio shack or some shit and I can find

1076
01:05:10,031 --> 01:05:13,210
the connecting wire here that I need to
upload this fucking thing. All right,

1077
01:05:13,211 --> 01:05:15,250
that's it. Go fuck yourselves.
We'll talk to you next week.
