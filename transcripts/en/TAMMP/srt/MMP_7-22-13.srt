1
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:06,100
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's
the Monday morning podcast from Monday,

2
00:00:06,101 --> 00:00:09,370
July 22nd,

3
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:13,810
2013 off we go into the wild blue yonder.

4
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,440
Ah, fuck. I gave a bunch of shit
to do today. People just like you.

5
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:28,870
Even my Mondays are busy. I actually got
a lot of shit out of the way already.

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,230
I walk my dog around the block.
It took a shit.

7
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:36,910
I picked it up in a bag.
All right,

8
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:39,700
I like that Rappaport fella.

9
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:44,230
I picked it up right and I put it in
somebody's barrel. Somebody else's barrel,

10
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:47,950
which is the right thing
slash douchey thing to do.

11
00:00:47,951 --> 00:00:51,100
The ultimate neighborly thing is you
pick it up and you hold on to a t,

12
00:00:51,101 --> 00:00:55,090
get back to your own trashcan and then
you put it in there. That right there.

13
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:59,650
That is a class act. All right.
Then you have tier two you have me,

14
00:00:59,651 --> 00:01:03,130
well at least he picked it up, but then
the con threw it in my trash barrel.

15
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,220
I can argue, well, hey,
you know, to trash barrel,

16
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:10,660
what are you worried that it's just going
to smell like rotting garbage is the

17
00:01:10,661 --> 00:01:12,220
shit smell really going to ruin it?

18
00:01:12,221 --> 00:01:16,520
But I understand as a principal
it's your dog, it's your shit. Um,

19
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,910
you know, and you have the last one
is that people just don't pick it up.

20
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:24,700
But anyways,
anyways,

21
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,740
people have been breaking into cars and
my neighborhood, man, it's fucking him.

22
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,810
Every once in a while like this,
they'll come by here for a while,

23
00:01:30,811 --> 00:01:31,321
then they leave.

24
00:01:31,321 --> 00:01:36,321
La is really a weird city where it's like
you live in a place in one night it's

25
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:39,930
safe and then the next night it isn't.
You know,

26
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,910
there's the general vibe and then
there's also like the fucking rule,

27
00:01:42,911 --> 00:01:47,430
that aspect of living in Los Angeles.
So I think they come by,

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,730
they fuck with cars because it's the
same people, right? It's five of them,

29
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,800
five people running the world and there's
five people breaking all the windows

30
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,710
and stealing shit in this
car. I'm convinced of it.
All right. I have, I have,

31
00:02:00,711 --> 00:02:04,230
I have information that can back that
up. If you want it, I'll give it to you.

32
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:07,890
But I would appreciate it if you've
been listening to my podcast long enough

33
00:02:07,891 --> 00:02:11,880
that you would just take me at my own
with my word actually means something to

34
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:15,400
you, you know? Um, anyways,

35
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:18,870
I've been breaking in these fucking
cars and uh, uh, it's just annoying.

36
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,290
I told you they had me last time. They
fucking, there was nothing in my car.

37
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:25,560
And then they took all my
quarters as little Satchel,

38
00:02:25,561 --> 00:02:29,640
a quarters for the parking meters because
I still don't want to use my credit

39
00:02:29,641 --> 00:02:32,850
card because I don't want to tell
people where the fuck I am. You know?

40
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,200
Well, she, according to your, your, you're
a fucking parking meter records. You,

41
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:43,470
you were there sir.
And I know what right now do it.

42
00:02:43,471 --> 00:02:47,710
They can just track you with
your cell phone Yan. Um,

43
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:48,843
maybe they can.

44
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,733
Hmm.

45
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:54,600
But I could say, well, I lost my cell
phone. Someone else had it right.

46
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,910
I could come around with it,
but if he fucking down can say,

47
00:02:56,911 --> 00:02:58,550
somebody stole my credit card.
I Dunno.

48
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:02,690
I don't like people watching me
all the fucking time. You know,

49
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,510
you know what kills me is the amount
of people that actually are happy.

50
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,090
Snowden did what he did
and there's nobody any,

51
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:13,150
anywhere in media with any sort of a
fucking job that pays any decent amount of

52
00:03:13,701 --> 00:03:18,230
money that is open in their fucking miles.
Everybody's keeping quiet.

53
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:19,710
Yeah.

54
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:23,790
Good for you. Snow. Keep running. You
could stay at my house if you want to

55
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:31,350
hang out until you know, blows
over, you know, sit around,

56
00:03:31,351 --> 00:03:35,520
eat some TV. Hey, you know what
I did this week, everybody?

57
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:39,810
I uh, I went out and I bought the,
the body issue, the naked issue.

58
00:03:39,811 --> 00:03:44,400
The nude issue of ESPN. Why?
Cause I'm a pervert. Yes. Why?

59
00:03:44,401 --> 00:03:48,180
Because I always liked the 40 niners
but wanted to see their quarterback

60
00:03:48,181 --> 00:03:52,800
completely naked in the, on some
lava rocks. Absolutely. You got me?

61
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,210
Okay.

62
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:58,350
I can't remember how many times last year
when I was watching a 49 nighters gain.

63
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:02,130
You know, this call of Kaepernick, I'll
tell you, he's entertaining to watch,

64
00:04:02,131 --> 00:04:02,571
but you know,

65
00:04:02,571 --> 00:04:06,990
it'd be more entertaining if somehow
he would get down on all fours on some

66
00:04:06,991 --> 00:04:11,820
fucking lava rocks. Like he's going to,
uh, do a hundred yard dash into the ocean.

67
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:14,490
That's what I would really like.
No.

68
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,670
You know why I bought it because somebody
told me Gary player was on the cover.

69
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:21,630
That's what I was told.
Am I Gary Player?

70
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:25,040
Isn't that guy like fucking a hundred
years old. They're like, no, he's like 77,

71
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,383
you know,

72
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,500
and I go, he's an unbelievable
shape. You know me,

73
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,840
I'm obsessed with not becoming a fat fuck.

74
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:34,923
Right.

75
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,060
Fat People call that having a body issue,
you know,

76
00:04:38,061 --> 00:04:41,180
cause they didn't want to stop eating the
jelly and Ritz crackers late at night,

77
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:42,950
you know,
that they stuffed into ice cream.

78
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,650
You know what's funny is as mean as I am
to fat people, I've slowly begun to win

79
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:51,560
according to this guy last week.
And I'll take Kim is,

80
00:04:51,561 --> 00:04:53,580
is like every fat person
who listens to this.

81
00:04:53,581 --> 00:04:56,850
I'm beginning to shame
people into losing weight.

82
00:04:56,851 --> 00:04:58,590
And I think that that
would be a great show.

83
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:03,630
It would be just like biggest loser
as far as the amount of yelling,

84
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,500
but it wouldn't be as motivational.
Oh, it'd be like the opposite.

85
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:11,730
And then it would cause a controversy
and then there would be people doing that

86
00:05:11,731 --> 00:05:13,230
split screen on TV.
You know,

87
00:05:13,231 --> 00:05:17,890
you got the host and then he got the two
people like, uh, you know, what, what,

88
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:22,380
what do you think a person I've never
heard of before or I think it's great.

89
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:25,340
You know, I think these fat,
Fuck Charlotte's both types.

90
00:05:25,341 --> 00:05:26,820
Nobody called him a fat fuck.

91
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,870
What do you think about a female person
who of course you have to have the

92
00:05:30,871 --> 00:05:32,560
motherly side of this?
Well,

93
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:37,110
I just think that people have to
understand that it's a food addiction.

94
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,790
This negative reinforced is we're
seeing this in schools with by,

95
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:46,260
Oh fuck you lady. Okay. I think you'd go
out with a couple of pounds still. Hey,

96
00:05:46,261 --> 00:05:48,370
let's try to keep it
nice. So I, let's try it.

97
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:51,930
Like the fucking house who's exploring
the whole problem can then sit there

98
00:05:51,931 --> 00:05:56,280
rubbing his chin, shaking his head.
You know? I mean, you know, it's funny.

99
00:05:56,281 --> 00:05:59,180
All three of them in that moment,
they're all getting paid.

100
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:04,810
They're all making money off of the Lard
that's in the ashes of so many people

101
00:06:04,971 --> 00:06:09,920
these days. And I, I like to think that
that's the true Tao a tragedy. You know,

102
00:06:09,921 --> 00:06:14,720
I like to think right now that I'm
thinking outside the box, the ice box,

103
00:06:14,721 --> 00:06:18,230
I guess. I guess you would
call it. What's the deal? Um,

104
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:23,870
so I got the body issue and uh,
you know what bugged me?

105
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:29,180
It w this fucking trend,
like the fucking tattoos

106
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:31,543
mmm.

107
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:36,420
That people have in order. It is in
particular, what is it in particular bill?

108
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:39,770
I don't like people who write
fucking inspirational shit on them

109
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:43,010
body, like, you know,

110
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:46,130
and they always have it in a
place, you know, they don't always,

111
00:06:46,131 --> 00:06:50,120
but for a lot of times they have it in
a fucking place where only I can really

112
00:06:50,121 --> 00:06:54,620
get a good look at it. So there's no
way for me not to take that is like,

113
00:06:54,621 --> 00:06:57,340
what do you think I'm a fucking moron?
Like you have life all figured out

114
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,013
that,
you know,

115
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,170
you gotta write this shit on your body,
where the hell is it?

116
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,190
What the hell is this fucking
person who was this fucking Golfer?

117
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:12,200
Beautiful woman, right in like
a 1950s kind of way. You know,

118
00:07:12,201 --> 00:07:13,400
little houses,

119
00:07:13,401 --> 00:07:18,401
then they're all made out of Ticky tacky
and we fucked missionary only to have

120
00:07:19,821 --> 00:07:22,430
more kids.
They have blue eyes,

121
00:07:22,431 --> 00:07:26,150
they have brown eyes and they
all say fucking racist shit.

122
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:31,040
But it's the 1950s and
nobody knows better. Sorry.

123
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,083
Um,

124
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:34,200
okay.

125
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:38,910
That's a waterfowl niche just for us.
It's the 19 fucking fifties.

126
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:40,163
So this woman,

127
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:44,910
that's some of the worst second I've ever
done wolf that even sound that bad to

128
00:07:44,911 --> 00:07:49,440
me. So this is fucking lady,
her name is Carly booth.

129
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,580
Gorgeous little diesel.
She sitting there on the driving range,

130
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:56,850
looks like in Manhattan
driving some golf balls.

131
00:07:56,851 --> 00:08:01,110
I'm sure people going by and they're
fucking yachts, you know, all upset going,

132
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:04,500
is that naked woman playing golf?
And I wasn't invited to that party.

133
00:08:04,501 --> 00:08:08,520
I don't have enough money. I thought
I knew Bloomberg too. So anyways,

134
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:12,400
she has written on the side of
her body. All right. It's a,

135
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,760
starts at her waist and then
goes down to whatever that,

136
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:18,180
that piece of meat is that's between,
uh,

137
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,830
it's at the same level as your ass cheek.
You side beside of your hip,

138
00:08:22,831 --> 00:08:26,300
I guess you'd call it, right? Is
that what it's called? In the, uh,

139
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:29,670
the medical field. So anyways, it's
beautiful. Woman has something,

140
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,490
I can't even read the first.
It looks like the symbol for Pi.

141
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:36,210
I don't know what it is she has
written on the side of her body.

142
00:08:36,211 --> 00:08:39,000
It says whatever is not,

143
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,240
yeah.

144
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,780
Oh, Jesus Christ. I can't read this.

145
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:45,560
Whatever is not the stars
to hold our destinies,

146
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:50,690
but in ourselves or a destiny. I
can't read it. It's too far away,

147
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:54,980
but I just don't know why. Why
do, why do people do that? Yeah.

148
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,230
Is that for when she's hooking
up with some guy, right.

149
00:08:58,231 --> 00:09:01,590
And he's banging her doggy style and
he kind of leans over and he looks,

150
00:09:01,591 --> 00:09:05,580
and then he reads that and like, what's
he supposed to take that right? Like damn,

151
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,560
it's bitches deep.
Wow.

152
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:13,243
Okay.

153
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:17,550
They're endless guys.
Get them to, you know,

154
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,590
try to be a little fair,

155
00:09:19,591 --> 00:09:23,110
a little more fair and balanced and
the spirit of Fox News here, right?

156
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,160
Totally lean one way. But I tried to just
say I'm fair and balanced. This. Let's,

157

163

all right. This gorgeous woman,

164
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:59,040
she's doing that thing where she puts
her thumb in her fucking a belt loop and

165
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:00,420
Polzer Jane's down a little bit.

166
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:03,090
That's like the classic when
you have like the bathing suit.

167
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:04,430
Okay.

168
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:06,190
A edition of sports illustrated.

169
00:10:06,191 --> 00:10:10,370
He always got to have like for you
future women out there or male models,

170
00:10:10,371 --> 00:10:13,340
I think guys can get away with it to
what you do is you're totally naked.

171
00:10:13,341 --> 00:10:16,770
You have little speedos on and
you're not showing enough skins.

172
00:10:16,771 --> 00:10:18,080
So then you got to take a thumb.

173
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,350
You stick it in the side of it and you
pull it down a little bit and then you

174
00:10:21,351 --> 00:10:25,400
have this look on your face.
Like why sell thing happened.

175
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:30,080
Um, all right. She has on her side,

176
00:10:30,081 --> 00:10:32,870
fall down seven times.
Stand up eight.

177
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:41,010
If you're truly a strong person, can
you know, can't you just hear that?

178
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:45,430
Just like remember it.
I am enough the way I am.

179
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:50,710
This woman has this written on her a
collarbone and it goes right into the, uh,

180
00:10:50,711 --> 00:10:53,110
the ball and socket joint day,
whatever the fuck you call it,

181
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,650
a vol joint there and your shoulder.

182
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:02,080
I am enough the way I am,
you know,

183
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,910
like I see that all I want to do.

184
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:05,500
Yeah.

185
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:09,380
It's just give her a hug. Pat Her on
the head and just be like, I'm sorry.

186
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,200
Your parents did whatever they did to you.
I'm sorry.

187
00:11:12,201 --> 00:11:16,820
They didn't say the things they
needed to say. Um, all right.

188
00:11:16,821 --> 00:11:21,280
What does this person have? No,
it's written in French. You, no,

189
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:25,210
it's pretentious.
MMM.

190
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:30,390
In finite. I don't know why
you would have that on there.

191
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:31,900
Yeah.

192
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,840
This is my favorite one.
This guy has this written on his wrist.

193
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,950
Take a chance.
They don't come much bigger than this,

194
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,253
you know?

195
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:45,070
So whatever the situation is,

196
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,920
be it he meets the girl of his dreams or
some hooker who doesn't have a condom.

197
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:53,320
He looks down at his wrist and
that's what it says, right?

198
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,090
Okay.

199
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:59,890
I Dunno. It was just bombing. I was in
heaven. I was in hell believe in neither,

200
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:02,820
but fear them as well.
Damn.

201
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:06,250
Where are you really in
heaven and where you went?

202
00:12:06,251 --> 00:12:10,330
Hell here on earth or did
you visit another land?

203
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,180
Okay,

204
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,070
it's fucking jerk off.
You probably unloads trucks.

205
00:12:14,071 --> 00:12:17,820
He had it written on the back of his calf.
Right? You're just a fucking asshole.

206
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:22,620
You know you should've said asshole and
then a fucking Arrow pointed right up.

207
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:25,920
You fucking asshole. You know? Oh,

208
00:12:25,921 --> 00:12:30,720
you pretentious conch with your fucking
song lyrics and crap on your body.

209
00:12:30,721 --> 00:12:33,530
Can you put them in a place
where we don't have to look? Oh,

210
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:36,240
I don't have to look at, I'm going to
get to speak for everybody. All right.

211
00:12:36,241 --> 00:12:39,540
That guy. If I was a
dictator, I was running shit.

212
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,413
All right.

213
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:47,410
After I assassinated or imprisoned or
pistol whipped every fucking bank or I

214
00:12:47,411 --> 00:12:50,530
could find, I would
then be like, all right,

215
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:55,660
you have two options.
You either get that fucking thing removed,

216
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:00,160
all right?
Or you never wear shorts again.

217
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,750
You're allowed to wear your underwears
when you walk around your apartment,

218
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:08,170
but that's it. Other than
that, go fuck yourself.

219
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,630
Look at these fucking people.

220
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:16,120
Every new beginning comes from
some other beginnings and,

221
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:20,560
oh Geez. Wow, wow. I never
looked at it that way.

222
00:13:20,561 --> 00:13:22,840
Thank God you wrote that on your rib cage.

223
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,960
Would you like another fuzzy navel?

224
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,190
Oh my God, this girl's got an
entire story but not a back.

225
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:34,820
Okay.

226
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:39,410
I just love this passage and I always
wanted to have it written on my back.

227
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:44,180
All right, the shoulder blade
tattoo. What does she got here?

228
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,290
What does this one say?

229
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,160
That was a lot of women with the shit
written on their backs and different

230
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:52,100
languages. All right, here's to me,

231
00:13:52,101 --> 00:13:54,680
here's to you and here's
to life and laughter.

232
00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:00,040
I'll be true as long as you and not
a single moment after Jesus Christ.

233
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:03,730
Yeah.

234
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:07,570
What in in it literally looks like she
wrote it on her back and had someone else

235
00:14:07,571 --> 00:14:11,190
fill it, fill it in. He
used to me, here's, yeah.

236
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:12,730
Okay.

237
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:17,030
Love never fails.
All right.

238
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,910
This guy's getting written on
both forearms. I listened to the,

239
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:27,370
I listened to the Bray of
my heart. I am. I am. I am.

240
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:29,920
Oh my God, Dude. These are like, you know,

241
00:14:29,921 --> 00:14:32,680
the thing I like about this shit that
they write it on their bodies is,

242
00:14:32,681 --> 00:14:37,600
that's just a great thing to read during
your, during a first date. All right?

243
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:40,600
Here's the one for you. If you, if
you meet a girl with a foot tattoos,

244
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:44,020
like you got to go in another direction,
right?

245
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:50,340
There's nothing uglier than a foot
tattoo. They just did. You just,

246
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,440
I don't understand. I don't
understand. You know what?

247
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,860
I'm sure there's a lot of you guys out
to probably most of you at this point

248
00:14:57,861 --> 00:14:58,820
have tattoos,
right?

249
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:00,883
You know,

250
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,540
at what point are those things
going to go out of style?

251
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:07,740
Okay?

252
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,160
Has this podcast just completely lost
momentum? I feel like Lenny Bruce,

253
00:15:11,161 --> 00:15:14,460
when he fucking just kept
reading his, uh, his court cases,

254
00:15:14,461 --> 00:15:18,180
I really got way to enter that tattoo. I
just fuck it. I'm not enough. I am enough.

255
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,370
Every fucking athlete,
that's stupid issues.

256
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:27,380
Got some big dumb ass piece on
their back and their shoulders.

257
00:15:27,511 --> 00:15:29,370
And you know what I
gotta be honest with you.

258
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:34,550
It all looks the same bunch of squiggly
squibs scrabbly dues is always a or a

259
00:15:34,891 --> 00:15:36,180
fucking dragon in there.

260
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:38,143
You know,

261
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:43,260
the fuck is wrong with you.
Everybody else has what?

262
00:15:43,261 --> 00:15:44,400
I want one too.

263
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:49,360
It's one of the greatest things I ever
did was I never got a fucking tattoo it

264
00:15:49,361 --> 00:15:51,900
back. You know, it's funny,
back when, uh, when I was,

265
00:15:51,901 --> 00:15:55,260
when I was just the lad
and he got tattoos people,

266
00:15:55,261 --> 00:15:59,160
it was the tail end of getting like
cartoon characters like just about four

267
00:15:59,161 --> 00:16:03,850
inches away from your Dick.
You know, we get it like you,

268
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:05,570
I remember there was a
guy had you sent him, he,

269
00:16:05,571 --> 00:16:10,560
Sam with the two guns and said back
off and it was just to the right of his

270
00:16:10,561 --> 00:16:13,380
package. You know, I knew another guy,

271
00:16:13,381 --> 00:16:18,230
he got the fucking Budweiser label.
That's what you got.

272
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,353
You know,

273
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:22,030
he didn't sit there and
have to be like fucking

274
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:23,730
okay.

275
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:24,151
You know,

276
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:29,040
a stitch in time saves the sorcerer
who gets up early and catches the worm.

277
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:32,970
Yeah. A bunch of fucking constant. You
know what, keep getting your tattoos.

278
00:16:32,971 --> 00:16:33,751
I like it.
You know,

279
00:16:33,751 --> 00:16:38,700
it's branding you as someone
not worthy of talking to um,

280
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,530
give you guys do that for me this weekend.

281
00:16:40,531 --> 00:16:43,620
Can you walk around when you see people
who have those and when you just read

282
00:16:43,621 --> 00:16:46,570
them, just point at them like
you're in that version of the body.

283
00:16:46,571 --> 00:16:48,060
Snatcher and just go,
oh

284
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,900
yeah.
Damn.

285
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:55,620
And then fucking walk away. No,
don't do that. Don't you know what?

286
00:16:55,621 --> 00:16:57,900
Don't even listen to me. Um, all right,

287
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:03,420
the fuck was I going to talk about this?
Like, oh, guess what I did this week. Oh,

288
00:17:03,421 --> 00:17:05,520
freckle face bill. Guess
what I did, you know,

289
00:17:05,521 --> 00:17:09,060
a year ago I wrote a fucking motorcycle
or whatever. I went dirt bike riding.

290
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,080
I actually took a motorcycle
safety course. It was a,

291
00:17:13,081 --> 00:17:15,960
it was a day and a half
and I got to tell you, man,

292
00:17:15,961 --> 00:17:20,910
it was fucking a exhilarating
and terrifying. So I actually,

293
00:17:20,911 --> 00:17:24,000
I passed the class somehow.
I don't think I should have,

294
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:27,450
I was doing my little youth turns.
They had to put my little foot down there.

295
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,013
Uh,

296
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:35,030
um, no, it was a great fucking time sell.

297
00:17:35,031 --> 00:17:39,230
Basically how it worked was you rode for
like four hours and then he had a class.

298
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,103
MMM.

299
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:46,530
I realized how spoiled I am as a fucking
human being, you know, just having this,

300
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,400
the life that I have where I don't have
boss and I basically do whatever the

301
00:17:50,401 --> 00:17:52,470
fuck I want.
I have not been in a classroom.

302
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,593
MMM.

303
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,370
I just immediately,

304
00:17:56,430 --> 00:18:00,750
I just takes me back to why
I chose the route I chose.

305
00:18:00,751 --> 00:18:03,780
I just never liked the classroom
situation, but this, this was a,

306
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,890
was actually a great time,

307
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:09,720
but it just immediately had anxiety and
I'm like half paying attention and then,

308
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:12,210
and then in the end they're like,
okay, now we're going to do the test.

309
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:16,770
I went right back to when I was
like in eighth grade. And I got got,

310
00:18:16,771 --> 00:18:19,710
I'm going to fail this. And the guy's
like, no one has ever failed this.

311
00:18:19,711 --> 00:18:22,320
And you're like, oh, good
pressure pressure. I'm a moron.

312
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:26,220
Was sitting at the table and everybody's
fucking finishing. Before I was like,

313
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:30,120
there was like, I don't
know, 40 people in the class.

314
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,350
I think I finished 37th as far
as completing the test. Um,

315
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:40,680
I don't know. It's 50 questions I got
for run. It's like something like that.

316
00:18:40,681 --> 00:18:43,360
How fucking though?
But somehow I passed and um,

317
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:44,870
okay.

318
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:48,320
That was funny. I've never flipped
flopped so much of my life on a decision.

319
00:18:48,321 --> 00:18:51,110
I was thinking, am I going to get a
bike? Should I just get a dirt bike?

320
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:54,290
Should I just know how to
do this? And then, you know,

321
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:55,180
yeah.

322
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:59,650
I just wanted to learn how
to ride a motorcycle. You
know, I grew up in the 80s.

323
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,053
All right.

324
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:04,600
I watched a lot of action movies and one
of the things that I always was envious

325
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:09,601
of the Action Heroes Aside from their
oiled up fucking eighties lifting weights,

326
00:19:09,881 --> 00:19:12,550
no squats ever bodies,
was

327
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,553
uh,

328
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,860
the fact that no matter what
vehicle they approached,

329
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,400
not only with the keys always in it,
they knew how to drive it.

330
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:26,710
They knew how to drive everything from
a dump truck to a fucking helicopter

331
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,050
airplane. They could sail, they could
fucking do anything. So, you know,

332
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:35,410
it's coming up where, you know, we
got to raise the debt ceiling again.

333
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:40,180
Eventually the wave's going to hit the
beach and there's going to be a period

334
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:45,790
where you could quite possibly be getting
chased down the street by an angry we

335
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:50,650
fucking mob is, is this,
everything goes to shit, you know?

336
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:56,230
So at that point it would be
nice if you had the ability to,

337
00:19:56,231 --> 00:19:59,440
whatever escape vehicle
you meet you ran into,

338
00:19:59,441 --> 00:20:02,800
you could actually just jump in and
just be all right with it. Right.

339
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:07,360
Sylvester Stallone, fucking, uh,

340
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:11,650
Arnold Schwartzenegger,
Steven Seagal, Chuck Norris.

341
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,660
They never it,

342
00:20:13,661 --> 00:20:17,620
I challenge you to find anything that
they fucking ran up to when any of those

343
00:20:17,621 --> 00:20:21,760
movies that day did not a
jet ski fucking motor boat,

344
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,590
sailboat,
submarine,

345
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:27,090
combine helicopter fucking plane with,

346
00:20:27,091 --> 00:20:29,080
with only can land on water.

347
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,710
Those skis or the tires
doesn't make a difference.

348
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:35,170
They could instrument
rated they everything.

349
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:37,270
Yeah.

350
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:41,470
Everything. They could be on a
fucking plane, a commercial airline,

351
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:43,660
and somehow kill the person next to him,

352
00:20:43,661 --> 00:20:46,120
put a hat over their face
without anybody noticing,

353
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:50,140
crawl down where the luggages and then
jump off the landing gear and do a

354
00:20:50,141 --> 00:20:54,490
fucking mash at the end of
the, the, the, the runway.

355
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:58,090
They were unstoppable.
So I've added motorcycle.

356
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,330
All right.

357
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:05,100
I could drive a car stick or regular
and now I can drive a motorcycle.

358
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:06,630
I'm just checking off the list.

359
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,630
I have a day and a half of experience.
No,

360
00:21:12,631 --> 00:21:15,870
it's actually really fascinating and it
made me a better driver and I actually

361
00:21:15,871 --> 00:21:19,920
have a much more appreciation of,
uh,

362
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:20,750
okay.

363
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:24,560
Of this skill it takes to ride a
motorcycle. It's not like a car. Yeah,

364
00:21:24,561 --> 00:21:27,500
no shit bill now,
but just shit that you wouldn't think.

365
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:28,890
Okay.

366
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:29,461
Like I didn't,

367
00:21:29,461 --> 00:21:33,240
I didn't understand all that went into
just going around a turn on a motorcycle

368
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:37,230
and out. Not only do you hit the, do not
hit the break, but if you hit the brake,

369
00:21:37,231 --> 00:21:40,550
you're actually gonna you know
you're going to crash.

370
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:43,280
You gotta judge to look
through the whole turn,

371
00:21:43,281 --> 00:21:48,140
judge you speed and then fucking
power your way through it. Um,

372
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:52,750
pretty good tense. I got not going to lie
to you. I'm not gonna act like I was, eh,

373
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:53,271
got this.

374
00:21:53,271 --> 00:21:56,870
This is easy that we were going into
the class and like has anybody seen it?

375
00:21:56,871 --> 00:21:59,510
And I'm getting excited like wow.
Then I just wrote a bike for four hours.

376
00:21:59,511 --> 00:22:02,840
I've got it up to third gear
down and this is fucking great.

377
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,350
And then I went into the class
and one of the things, you know,

378
00:22:06,351 --> 00:22:09,380
the group discussion there was like
anybody ever see a motorcycle accident or

379
00:22:09,381 --> 00:22:12,500
been in a motorcycle accident?
It's like fucking almost everybody,

380
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:16,670
or at least half the class puts their
hands up and they start telling stories in

381
00:22:16,671 --> 00:22:21,050
this one guys was like a paramedic
and he's going like, Yay. You know,

382
00:22:21,051 --> 00:22:23,870
I saw this guy was going like 90,

383
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:26,840
he hit a car head on and his
heart came out of his chest.

384
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:32,510
He had like all these stories and
I was sitting there, I'm like,

385
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,170
okay,

386
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:37,380
like laughing at myself going,
what the fuck am I signing up for here?

387
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,170
This is insane.
Um,

388
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:41,430
okay.

389
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:44,430
And then like the guy who was teaching
the class who looked like he was born on

390
00:22:44,431 --> 00:22:48,540
a motorcycle and was fucking, you know,
wrote the same way it was. You know,

391
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:51,240
obviously he's the instructor,
he's fucking great. Ryan bikes.

392
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,880
He even had a story of a couple
months ago. Yeah. You know,

393
00:22:53,881 --> 00:22:55,610
I hit some sand and I was like singing,
oh,

394
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,950
I'm going over the fucking handle
bars and I'm like, keep my body relax.

395
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:03,720
And all I'm thinking in my head is just
like, dude, you went down, you went down.

396
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,240
Yeah.

397
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,910
Right. This guy, I'm telling you,

398
00:23:06,911 --> 00:23:09,000
it just looked like he was
just made the ride a fucking,

399
00:23:09,001 --> 00:23:10,830
we just had that I ride a motorcycle look,

400
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,890
as opposed to me who looks like some do.

401
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:16,320
She goes to take a safety course and
I'm just thinking this guy went down,

402
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:19,650
this guy's an EMT talking about people's
hearts coming out of their chest.

403
00:23:19,651 --> 00:23:21,500
I'm just like, what?
This is fucking stupid.

404
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:22,760
Okay.

405
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,160
You know? So, uh,

406
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:26,600
okay

407
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,200
on, I don't know where I'm at. I
think I'm just going to maybe just

408
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:34,140
right on dark is what I'll do.
You can't,

409
00:23:34,141 --> 00:23:36,870
you can't fuck or ride a bike out
here in la. You know what it is?

410
00:23:36,871 --> 00:23:40,770
I'm old enough to know it's fucking
stupid. So, uh, I think I'm going to,

411
00:23:40,771 --> 00:23:41,670
if I'm going to do it,

412
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:45,500
I just get like a dirt bike and
I put it in the back of my truck,

413
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:49,130
drive out of the city and
all the people texting,

414
00:23:49,131 --> 00:23:51,410
get to where the trailers and
then just ride around on dirt.

415
00:23:51,411 --> 00:23:52,870
And I know all you constantly be like,
yeah,

416
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:56,840
actually [inaudible] PTLD Jap in
off road people, not PA. Could you,

417
00:23:57,050 --> 00:24:00,830
I know I just stand this
risk with everything, but uh,

418
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,680
you know, I dunno. I,

419
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:08,270
I think it's a good thing that I waited
till I was 45 to learn how to ride a

420
00:24:08,271 --> 00:24:13,271
motorcycle because if I was thinking
if I was 21 and I would just,

421
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:18,290
I wouldn't give a shit ass.
I can happen to me.

422
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:21,670
And that's not going to happen to me.
Like you get older and by the time you're,

423
00:24:21,671 --> 00:24:25,360
my age, shit has happened to you or some
close friends. So you kind of like, yeah.

424
00:24:25,361 --> 00:24:26,320
You know,
that could happen to me.

425
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:31,360
Kind of like my heart in my chest
on this side of my rib cage. Uh,

426
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:34,000
but I got to tell you though,
I definitely got the bug and

427
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:35,440
okay.

428
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,180
It's the most fucking fun.

429
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,100
Okay.

430
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:44,040
I even by the second day I was actually
getting frustrated because I was

431
00:24:44,041 --> 00:24:46,110
thinking like, I just want to
take this out on the street.

432
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:48,930
I'm sick of speeding up and slowing down.

433
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:52,080
I just want to drive this fucking thing.
And uh,

434
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:53,930
okay.

435
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:57,140
I Dunno. Don't worry. I'm not
going to go out and do that.

436
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:58,250
I'm not gonna do that dumb shit.

437
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:02,180
This is exactly what a lot
of people do when they,

438
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:04,580
when they finally get to
where they want to be in life,

439
00:25:04,581 --> 00:25:07,550
which is what I feel I am, you know,
selling the tickets as a comic,

440
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:11,840
get some acting gigs every
once in a while. You know,
you got a little free time.

441
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,120
What do you do?
You pull a John Denver,

442
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:18,290
you go out and get a pilot's license yet
out you fly some experimental aircraft

443
00:25:18,291 --> 00:25:23,080
and next thing you know they're
the news today. Singer songwriter.

444
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:27,820
All right. So that's definitely
in the back of my head. But um,

445
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:29,740
yeah,

446
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,660
I dunno, I don't think nick is
going to let me get one anyways,

447
00:25:31,661 --> 00:25:33,190
to be honest with you.
That's probably a good thing.

448
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:35,800
But you know what she did
when she was saying no,

449
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:39,770
she did the classic thing like
why do you want to like, you know,

450
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:44,890
have all these toys. What is it with
guys and have, you know, you have your,

451
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:46,930
and like, what do I have? I
go, I get my truck. She goes,

452
00:25:46,931 --> 00:25:51,190
you get your guitars and it's like, you're
upset with me cause I'm a joint life.

453
00:25:51,191 --> 00:25:55,870
And she's like, no, you know, I think
she just doesn't want me to get one.

454
00:25:55,871 --> 00:26:00,070
So she tried to do that stupid argument
that the motorcycle was this extension.

455
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:02,370
Like it's like you, Dick, like you,

456
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:05,860
you guys like it's between their legs
and they have ride this thing down the

457
00:26:05,861 --> 00:26:09,310
street. It's just like, I dunno
what the fuck that is about.

458
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:10,550
Okay.

459
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:12,220
When I was riding for the last two days,

460
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:15,740
at no point was I thinking about
my dick other than thinking like,

461
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:18,470
I hope I don't fall off and,
uh,

462
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:21,320
when I'm going fast enough
that I get road rash on my leg,

463
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:22,223
Dick,

464
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:26,730
that would be the only thing. Other
than that, you know what, I wish,

465
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,520
I wish she took the class with me.
You know?

466
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:32,850
That's what I was actually think it'd
be great if she took the fucking class

467
00:26:32,851 --> 00:26:36,000
with me and she would just see
how much fun it is. It's fun.

468
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:37,450
Okay.

469
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:41,770
You know, I don't know. Fuck it.
No. So, uh, I got the bug now.

470
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:45,960
I The bug and I was looking at motorcycles
all last night, so I was telling her,

471
00:26:45,961 --> 00:26:48,330
I said, look, all I want to do, I'm
just going to get like the Honda rebel.

472
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:52,080
It's a fucking two 50. It's exactly
what I should get when I start out.

473
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:55,200
If I get something else up, kill
myself. And she starts, you know,

474
00:26:55,201 --> 00:26:59,410
looking up those stupid Ducati's, which
were cool about up until six months ago.

475
00:26:59,411 --> 00:27:01,260
And now every Douche
bag out there has him.

476
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,560
Like everybody seems to have
one of those fucking things. So,

477
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,273
you know,
I don't know.

478
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:10,240
And I looked at the new Harley's and I
don't like them. I think they're ugly.

479
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:15,040
They kind of lost their way. They lose
used to look meaner. So I'm just going to,

480
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:16,240
if I'm going to get one,

481
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:19,690
I'm either going to get dark bike or I'm
going to get this little fucking two 50.

482
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,330
I think the speedometer only
goes up to like 70 or 80.

483
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:23,893
MMM.

484
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,340
I Dunno. Tell me, what do you, what
do you guys think? And this is,

485
00:27:27,341 --> 00:27:29,470
and this is going to be
one of those extreme,

486
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,500
uh,

487
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,740
conversations. And believe me, I've
heard all the things get a motorcycle,

488
00:27:34,741 --> 00:27:38,280
you might as well buy the coffin
to go with it. It's not a helmet,

489
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:40,500
it's a brain bucket.
I've heard all of that shit.

490
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:44,800
Um,
I dunno.

491
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:48,010
Just dot.
It does seem like a lot of fun.

492
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,073
Right.

493
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:52,130
You know, if I, if I get one,

494
00:27:52,131 --> 00:27:55,070
I'm going to be one of those douchebags
who gets like a little two 50 and I'll

495
00:27:55,071 --> 00:27:58,970
have like all the gear on and
be dressed like all Samuelson.

496
00:27:58,971 --> 00:28:01,110
If he ever rode a motorcycle,
flipped completely over,

497
00:28:01,111 --> 00:28:06,111
protected fucking Robo cop suit on it
and I just ride around my neighborhood,

498
00:28:06,831 --> 00:28:10,830
never, never get out of
second gear. Um, anyway,

499
00:28:10,831 --> 00:28:13,550
so that's what the fuck I did
with my week. But, you know,

500
00:28:13,551 --> 00:28:14,390
it's good to know though,

501
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:18,380
if I ever get chased by a bunch of people
with hatchets down the street and I

502
00:28:18,381 --> 00:28:22,190
happened upon a fucking motorcycle and
there's a little key there provided it's

503
00:28:22,191 --> 00:28:26,330
not an old one with the throttles on the
other side or the shift or whatever the

504
00:28:26,331 --> 00:28:30,500
fuck it is. Uh, I'll be able to,
I'll be able to escape, you know?

505
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,320
Okay.

506
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,640
All right. I know what the fuck
I'm talking about. Okay, everybody,

507
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,890
it's time for a little bit of advertising.

508
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:40,130
I know this is your favorite part
of the week. Well, God damn it.

509
00:28:40,131 --> 00:28:44,510
It's mine to Bill's finally going to
stop babbling and actually read something

510
00:28:44,511 --> 00:28:46,190
that's prepared. All right, here we go.

511
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,140
Uh,

512
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:52,360
okay. He voice everyone.
You're screening calls,

513
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:57,640
closing deals and making money all while
lounging poolside in the summer sun.

514
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:02,260
Thanks to who he voice eve voice is a
better way to connect with people that

515
00:29:02,261 --> 00:29:05,590
drive your business. He voice will
forward business calls to your home,

516

Wherever you are, he voice.

517
00:29:09,101 --> 00:29:11,680
We'll find you don't
have time to take a call.

518
00:29:11,681 --> 00:29:15,850
It's routed to voicemail and you can
read it at your convenience as a text

519
00:29:15,851 --> 00:29:18,670
message. He voice not only gives
you an edge over your competitors,

520
00:29:18,671 --> 00:29:22,120
it takes away the edge of the big
companies have over you right now with he

521
00:29:22,121 --> 00:29:25,720
voice. You can create the appearance of
a whole office building of departments.

522
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:30,100
When customers call you a
sales department, customer
support, tech support,

523
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:30,641
you name it.

524
00:29:30,641 --> 00:29:34,450
It's going to sound like you have it all
through the wonder of the voice and it

525
00:29:34,451 --> 00:29:37,210
works with any phone, even
yourself. Hey, it's summer.

526
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,400
Don't be stuff stuck
in the office all day.

527
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:44,520
Free yourself with a 30 day trial of ee
voice so you can see what I'm talking

528
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:45,760

Go to [inaudible] dot com and enter the

531
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:56,970

and click on the voice banner.

532
00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:00,700
And uh, the next one, Tivo, Tivo.

533
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:05,320
Tim Tivo before Tivo
watching TV was weirdly hard.

534
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:09,220
You could only watch a show at a certain
time and if you missed it or even part

535
00:30:09,221 --> 00:30:12,460
of it, you literally had to wait for it
to go into reruns before you could see it

536
00:30:12,461 --> 00:30:15,130
again. I could vouch for
that. I am an old man.

537
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:19,510
Tivo totally changed all of that.
And while other dvrs exist,

538
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:23,560
they are not as sick. Alicia says
Tivo because if you have cable,

539
00:30:23,561 --> 00:30:27,220
Tivo lets you watch your shows
wherever you want. With Tivo stream.

540
00:30:27,221 --> 00:30:30,340
You can watch it on your iPad all
over your house and even transfer your

541
00:30:30,341 --> 00:30:34,510
favorite recordings and take them with
you on an airplane waiting in line at the

542
00:30:34,511 --> 00:30:36,780
DMV, the dentist office, Ti votes,

543
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:40,750
it makes other dvrs looked like they were
designed by some Soviet con committee.

544
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:44,920
Only Tivo searches both cable and
web to find any movie, any show,

545
00:30:44,921 --> 00:30:49,540
any video at the press of the button,
you hear that both cable and the web.

546
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:55,000
That's what sets him apart.
Netflix, Netflix, Amazon,

547
00:30:55,001 --> 00:30:59,500
Youtube. Uh, now those are just
like more channels on your TV.

548
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:02,500
Oh Wow. You can look at all
of that. That's amazing.

549
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:06,970
And what the Tivo mini one Tivo box works
on a second TV from the couch to the

550
00:31:06,971 --> 00:31:10,810
kitchen from the minivan to
35,000 feet up in an airplane.

551
00:31:10,811 --> 00:31:15,220
Tivo makes TV about a
thousand. Time's better. Um,

552
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:19,570
there you go. Alrighty. Thank
Bang. That was easy, wasn't it?

553
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,300
All right, let's get
back to this. So anyway,

554
00:31:22,301 --> 00:31:26,560
so I'm looking at the body issue here
and uh, I'm telling you to get inspired.

555
00:31:26,561 --> 00:31:30,880
Gary player. The guy is like 77 years
old. I forget what he's it, five,

556
00:31:30,881 --> 00:31:34,950
seven ways of buck 55. He's like it
his high school way. There he is.

557
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,930
Here he is who he is.

558
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:42,420
Golfer Pga tour winner
achievement award winner.

559
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:47,380
He's five, seven 150 pounds. Um,

560
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:50,980
I got to read this quote that he didn't
have to have tattooed on his tattoo

561
00:31:50,981 --> 00:31:55,240
lists body here. You said a great
man in India said to me, Mr. Player,

562
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:58,810
the less you eat,
the longer you live in western society,

563
00:31:58,811 --> 00:32:03,580
it's each eat plenty and die young.
I'm 70% vegetarian this morning.

564
00:32:03,581 --> 00:32:06,760
I didn't have any fats. No
Bacon, no sausage, no butter.

565
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,300
But I'm a normal human being.
I have a snickers if I want one.

566
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:14,660
I'm not a martyr now my duty, you can't
if that's not something too buyer to,

567
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:20,690
you know,
last time I was at one 50,

568
00:32:20,691 --> 00:32:22,700
I was in fucking,
I mean I'm taller than the guy,

569
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:26,570
but what was the guys at his
high school weight? You know,

570
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:30,050
you can still fit into his fucking
Tuxedo that he wore back in. Uh,

571
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:34,100
when he danced the Benny Goodman, you
know, you know what's funny about that?

572
00:32:34,101 --> 00:32:39,050
Vegetarian Shit. You always
fight it, right? You sit there,

573
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:42,530
you got to have some meat. You
got to Blahblahblahblahblah.
But I got to tell you,

574
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:46,250
do you need a giant salad? Every day
you're going to be right as rain.

575
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:50,510
You can eat a steak and afterwards you
can feel like you have a fucking shoe and

576
00:32:50,511 --> 00:32:52,460
your stomach, you got
to take a nap. You know,

577
00:32:52,461 --> 00:32:57,110
your body shuts down if you have red
meat and potatoes, right? You know,

578
00:32:57,111 --> 00:33:00,830
God damn well, you got to take a nap. You
literally have to fucking sleep it off.

579
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:06,110
You know, you never have to
sleep off the salad people. Uh,

580
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:09,560
that's what I've learned as I've gotten
older too. I got to stop fighting it.

581
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:14,420
You know, I want the meat eaters
to be right. Does that make sense?

582
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:16,100
Okay.

583
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,340
Who wants to eat a fucking stunt?

584
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:21,200
You want cheeseburgers and fries to be
the right way to go? Of course you do.

585
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:26,330
But I'm telling you, uh, oh, did I mention
I finally ate a tomato out of my garden,

586
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,270
my little modest garden.
Dude, I got to tell you,

587
00:33:29,271 --> 00:33:31,910
it was one of the most fucking
unbelievable experiences of my life.

588
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,060
It was, it was like, I don't,

589
00:33:35,061 --> 00:33:39,110
I don't know what the fuck I was eating
for the first 45 years of my life.

590
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:44,540
Um, I've got to tell you,
don't do it if you want. Don't,

591
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:49,040
this is great. I got tomatoes growing
right out in front of my house,

592
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:52,030
cucumbers and peppers.
I'm on my way.

593
00:33:52,031 --> 00:33:53,990
I'm gonna have a bunch of fucking
veggies growing out there.

594
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:58,880
I know how to ride a motorcycle, right?
So I'll just have a bag of veggies.

595
00:33:58,881 --> 00:34:03,800
Always ready to go. That's, that's my, uh,

596
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,860
that's my game plan.
But the other thing is,

597
00:34:06,861 --> 00:34:11,210
is if anybody on my block knows my
game plan, if they listened to this,

598
00:34:11,211 --> 00:34:14,590
then I'll let it going to do. It
was just still my vegetables. Right.

599
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,270
And puts some piano wire across the
street and that's going to be the enemy,

600
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:19,003
you know?

601
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:20,300
Okay.

602
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,910
Wouldn't that make sense? Oh, here you go.

603
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,880
I just got a text message
answering a question.

604
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:30,480
I would have this tattooed on my body.
Hang on a second.

605
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,700
I've been playing a lot of drums lately,

606
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:37,170
everybody and I've been fucking with that
Zeppelin Song in my time at dying and

607
00:34:37,171 --> 00:34:42,171
I never know how to count it to count
it in for that Barbara Barrett do you

608
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:47,990
don't, when he starts off, when
the fucking drums come in, I never,

609
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:52,050
I I can't fucking do, I knew, I kind
of thought it was maybe in four, four.

610
00:34:52,051 --> 00:34:53,970
So I got the answer here
to all you dramas out here.

611
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:57,090
This is coming from a professional
drummer. It's in four four.

612
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:01,230
If you mean the big Tom hits,
which I do, they are one

613
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:08,030
what?
They are one and have one and have to

614
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:14,120
get the fuck. So it's one end. And is it,

615
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:19,150
I thought it was convinced the guitar
riff that opens the song starts off on the

616
00:35:19,911 --> 00:35:23,130
end of four.
Ah,

617
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:28,120
that's what it is and one and
two and three. Okay. Ah, okay.

618
00:35:28,121 --> 00:35:32,590
You motherfuckers see that's the thing I
loved about Zeppelin is they always did

619
00:35:32,591 --> 00:35:33,700
that little tricky shit.

620
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:35,660
Okay.

621
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:40,020
So that Dan, Anna, Anna, it
starts on the and to four and
then know. Okay. All right.

622
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:43,110
Was that the most boring thing ever to
hear me trying to figure that shit out?

623
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:45,183
MMM.

624
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,990
All right. What the hell was I
talking about? Oh, hey, I owe,

625
00:35:48,991 --> 00:35:51,590
I owe a major fucking apology last week.
You know,

626
00:35:51,591 --> 00:35:53,300
I have the apologies every week.

627
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:57,080
So last week I was talking about,
uh,

628
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:01,400
I got to get his fucking name here.
The Guy who won Wimbledon,

629
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:07,480
let me, let me look this here. When
we'll do the 2013 something Marie, right?

630
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:12,370
What's his name? He, Andy
Murray. And I said, hey,

631
00:36:12,371 --> 00:36:16,900
for the first time ever, congratulations.
The first time ever an English guy,

632
00:36:16,901 --> 00:36:20,680
when the fuck in, uh, the Wimbledon,
turns out the guy was Scottish.

633
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:26,370
So right there I gave Andy Murray
is props and instead of calling,

634
00:36:26,711 --> 00:36:30,700
but then I called them English,
which is a classic example of what

635
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,110
that is.
Some cold lotion.

636
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,410
I wanna hear somebody sent me some audio
that with the fucking Scottish accent,

637
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,180
I apologize to everybody in Scotland.

638
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:43,310
People of Scotland can't stand
English people, you know. Actually,

639
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:46,610
most people in Ireland can't
stand him either. They're not,

640
00:36:46,611 --> 00:36:48,770
they're not a very well
liked group of people.

641
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:53,570
And you know why people just hating
on him, you know, just hating on him.

642
00:36:53,571 --> 00:36:57,060
I'll fucking successful.
They are with their kingdom,

643
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:02,550
right? Great Britain, the English Empire,

644
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:06,630
the guy, you know, something, they are
like a franchise that got bought out.

645
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:11,310
You know, like, remember back in the day,
there was Kinko's everywhere you went.

646
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,410
You know what?
Oh wait,

647
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:17,400
blockbuster feel like the blockbuster
video of fucking empires actually,

648
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:21,030
every empire is after a while.
You just get bought out by something else.

649
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,460
And I would say that, uh, our empire,

650
00:37:23,461 --> 00:37:27,750
the United States were like
blockbuster in like 2006. You know,

651
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:31,080
you see the writing on the wall.
Um, so that's it right there.

652
00:37:31,081 --> 00:37:34,200
You can't be a tub of shit. It's
coming to an end here. People.

653
00:37:34,201 --> 00:37:35,910
Something's going to fucking happen.
All right?

654
00:37:35,911 --> 00:37:37,590
So you got to get your ass in shape.

655
00:37:37,591 --> 00:37:42,150
You've got to start growing tomatoes and
he got to learn how to drive, ride sale,

656
00:37:42,151 --> 00:37:45,060
any fucking thing that's out there.
Um,

657
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:48,763
okay.

658
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:53,570
Uh, I'm a fucking moron. I don't have
anything to talk about this week. People,

659
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:57,560
I'm not going to lie to you.
I got nothing. Okay. Usually
I talk about sports. This,

660
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:00,920
oh, I know what I can talk about in
the wonderful wide world of sports.

661
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:06,320
Did anybody see Nellie going
off on Coby or discussing Coby?

662
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:11,520
Huh? That's why I finally, I feel
vindicated. Somebody else's seeing it.

663
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:16,380
He's talking about dove white.
Howard, Doug White. Howard leaving,

664
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:19,710
going. Maybe he doesn't want to play
with Colby. And you know, it's so funny,

665
00:38:19,711 --> 00:38:23,850
Steven A. Smith is sitting
there going, blasphemy.

666
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:29,660
Blasphemy as as he's as Nelly is credit
has the audacity to criticize Coby

667
00:38:31,201 --> 00:38:33,810
Brian. That's why I love Stephen A.
Smith cause that's the funniest thing.

668
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:37,660
And he's saying blasphemy like Nellie
is talking about the son of God.

669
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:40,660
That's how blinded Stephen A.

670
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:45,280
Smith is about criticizing Koby Bryant
because of his friendship with that guy

671
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:49,270
and protecting his
interview. Stephen A. Smith.

672
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:54,250
I know you can't say it.
Come on. Come on man.

673
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,970
You know, you know the deal.
Koby Bryant, they're the,

674
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:59,890
in the history of NBA basketball.

675
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:04,180
There's never been another
guy who's gotten more help
getting five championships

676
00:39:04,181 --> 00:39:06,130
that Coby Bryan.
All right.

677
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:11,520
The same way the Celtics piled on in 2008
and the Miami Heat the last couple of

678
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:14,680
years. Koby Bryant every year
he's on a team like that.

679
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:18,270
And I'm talking to my buddy Jason
Lawhead this say and Lebron.

680
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:20,050
The rumor is he's going to opt out.

681
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,350
So as Carmelo Anthony and
they're both going to go to la,

682
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,740
how much more fucking
help does this guy need?

683
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:33,150
Unfucking believable, but like Steven A.
Smith, can you ever address this? If you,

684
00:39:33,151 --> 00:39:37,380
somehow somebody sends this to you
because I am a huge fan. All right.

685
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:42,440
Explain this to me at the risk of you
saying blast for me as I say this,

686
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:47,930
how a player like Coby Bryant can walk
off the court twice this year during

687
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,690
horrific losses,
walk off on his own team.

688
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:56,220
You tell me how that does not breed
resentment in the locker room. All right?

689
00:39:57,270 --> 00:40:01,680
And how doing shit like that all year
does not end up with your fucking star

690
00:40:01,681 --> 00:40:05,160
center saying, I'm leaving. All right.
And I'm not saying that, you know,

691
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:10,020
Mr. Howard didn't fucking fall short.
All right. I just hate saying delight.

692
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:14,070
It's Dwight Dwight Howard,
Doh white. Spell it.

693
00:40:14,071 --> 00:40:18,450
D U H white. All right. Um,

694
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,610
I dunno.

695
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:23,520
All Dwight Howard has dudes just steal
a couple of moves from a keen and a

696
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:26,130
couple moves from Kevin Mchale and
he's going to be fucking unstoppable.

697
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:27,600
And he had a look on his face,

698
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:31,290
like maybe he was going to commit to
doing that for at least four days before.

699
00:40:31,291 --> 00:40:32,580
He's going to have that silly grin.

700
00:40:32,581 --> 00:40:34,560
Look how pretty I am and
look how big my arms are.

701
00:40:34,561 --> 00:40:37,830
I don't give a shit anymore that
he brings to the court every night.

702
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:42,900
Do you realize if you include Steven A.

703
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:47,220
Smith that I just criticized
about 40 foot of a human being?

704
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:51,390
You understand that that could all kick
my ass. I don't know about Steven A.

705
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:54,180
Smith. I think I could take them to the
ground, choke them out with his tie.

706
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:56,910
Who knows? Blasphemy, blasphemy. But uh,

707
00:40:56,911 --> 00:40:59,640
that's one of the youtube videos
of the week. You got to see that.

708
00:40:59,641 --> 00:41:03,060
And then I also have a great, uh, I was
watching the NHL network this weekend.

709
00:41:03,061 --> 00:41:07,650
A NHL network underrated. They,
they just, you know what they did?

710
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:08,850
They just, Oh, you know,

711
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:12,720
they just showed every islanders
clinching game during their,

712
00:41:12,721 --> 00:41:17,280
their four year dynasty that
they had from 80 to 83. And, uh,

713
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:21,960
I got this great clip after the boot.
Who did they beat?

714
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:25,300
They beat the north stars I think in 1980.
Uh,

715
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:29,880
when Nystrom had that overtime goal,
fucking unbelievable pass to.

716
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:34,550
And uh, one of the Sutter
brothers had just been called up

717
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:38,470
from the minus and they interview
them and it's just like,

718
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:42,190
it's just what's the most unsafe,
smooth ending to an interview. It's a,

719
00:41:42,191 --> 00:41:45,850
the name of the youtube videos is good
luck. We'll have that up there for you to,

720
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:49,950
uh, and with that, I've, I
babbled enough here. Let me, uh,

721
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:53,590
let me read a little fucking ad here and
then we'll get into the questions for

722
00:41:53,591 --> 00:41:54,810
the week. Sound good? Well,

723
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:57,370
you don't have a choice cause that's
how it was going down. All right.

724
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:00,400
Do all a shave club everybody.
All right.

725
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:03,430
This is why I like dollar Shave Club
because for years I've been complaining

726
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:07,560
about why do they treat like disposable
razor blades like the gold bullions.

727
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:12,490
You know? For some reason
it's like 40 bucks for a pack.
They got up behind glass.

728
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,500
You got to find somebody with the key.

729
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:18,610
You know the the reason why
you know why people steal them,

730
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:21,100
it's because they're
horrifically overpriced.

731
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:25,120
Wouldn't it be nice if someone was doing
something about that while I give you

732
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:29,590
dollar shave club? All
right. Dollar Shave Club.

733
00:42:29,591 --> 00:42:33,220
It's a cool brand and they send you
these quality radio written radios,

734
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:36,340
razors right to your door every month.
You don't have to think about it.

735
00:42:36,341 --> 00:42:40,000
You don't have to wait in
line, get someone to unlock
the key. Then from the cage,

736
00:42:40,001 --> 00:42:40,930
like I was just saying,

737
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:44,830
and pay way too much money for a bunch
of features that don't even fit on your

738
00:42:44,831 --> 00:42:49,300
old handle. Shaving has become such a
mess, but not with dollar shave club.

739
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:51,640
You know what,
I'm part of this now.

740
00:42:51,641 --> 00:42:54,790
It saves me time and it saves me
money and the razors are great.

741
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:57,970
They're just as good as any of that
crap behind the glass, you know,

742
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:00,640
except you don't have to go out
and get it. If you want to try it,

743
00:43:00,641 --> 00:43:04,660

746
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:15,850
they're going to bring you your blades.
You don't even have to think about it.

747
00:43:15,851 --> 00:43:19,270
You throw out the old ones.
Did He have a nice smooth shave all month?

748
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:22,540
You don't pay too much for
it. Give it a shot. All right.

749
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:26,350
God bless you and God bless the
United States of America. Okay,

750
00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:29,560
let's get to the questions for this week.
If I could find them.

751
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:35,730
Oh Christ, what did I do now? What did
I do? Oh, it was great. I was talking,

752
00:43:35,731 --> 00:43:40,110
I wasn't stuttering this week.
I've been reading copy, you know,

753
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:44,910
I feel like Mike, my copyright has
been good this week. All right. Okay.

754
00:43:44,911 --> 00:43:46,290
Water a day.
Bill.

755
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:49,200
This is in reference to your podcast
and the consumption of water.

756
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:54,090
I fell off working. I fell off
working out when I was working out.

757
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:58,680
What, what do you guys do this
to me? I fell off working out,

758
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:00,450
but when I was working out regularly,

759
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:05,250
I easy was drinking a gallon and a
half of water a day, sometimes two,

760
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,160
two gallons. Someone questioned,
questioned me on this,

761
00:44:10,161 --> 00:44:14,870
so I started to do research and basically
that's nowhere close to the limit.

762
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:20,410
Humans can consump I've consume
I think 10 liters a day safely.

763
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:25,220
Is that what you think, dude? You can
die drinking too much water like people,

764
00:44:25,221 --> 00:44:29,000
please don't go out and drink two
gallons straight. All right. Uh,

765
00:44:29,001 --> 00:44:30,950
he says thanks for the
three comedy by the,

766
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:36,780
that's what the reverse of Colt Lotion.
Thanks for, for the free comedy.

767
00:44:36,781 --> 00:44:37,470
By the way.

768
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:42,420
What's the reverse of cold lotion like
when you get a podcast out late Monday or

769
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:42,961
Tuesday?
Yeah,

770
00:44:42,961 --> 00:44:46,920
we didn't get the podcasts on Monday
because what Tuesdays mornings we're going

771
00:44:46,921 --> 00:44:48,230
to have one.
Um,

772
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:52,410
you guys would just never get beyond the
fact that the Monday morning podcast.

773
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:57,240
It's my Monday morning. It's 9:44 AM
Monday morning. I'm recording this. Okay.

774
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:01,980
All right. I'm just like you guys. I see
it in my world. It's my Monday morning,

775
00:45:01,981 --> 00:45:04,410
not yours. Go fuck yourselves. Um,

776
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:10,110
you know what's funny is this guy sitting
there like thrown out stats here and

777
00:45:10,111 --> 00:45:14,250
then in the end he goes,
um, humans can consume like,

778
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:17,700
I think 10 liters a day safely.

779
00:45:17,701 --> 00:45:22,110
So anybody listening to this don't
drink like I think 10 liters a day.

780
00:45:22,111 --> 00:45:27,000
Find out how many he can have an over
what amount of, of what period. You know,

781
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:31,860
look, you can have 30 drinks in a month,
but if you drink them right in a row,

782
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,530
you know,
I don't think that's a good fucking thing.

783
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:38,070
So there's gotta be a way
to s to space it out. Right.

784
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:42,120
And a fucking though.
All right. All right.

785
00:45:42,121 --> 00:45:46,050
The truth behind Jimmy's last week I
was talking about Jimmy's and I heard it

786
00:45:46,051 --> 00:45:48,390
was racist. The reason why, you know,

787
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:51,900
so you call them sprinkles or something
like up in Boston at the reason why they

788
00:45:51,901 --> 00:45:54,710
call them jimmies. That was a
reference to Jim Crow. A look,

789
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,280
got a couple of Jimmy's over the air.

790
00:45:56,970 --> 00:46:00,570
And then a lot of the sprinkles
being chocolate and color,

791
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:05,490
it didn't translate it over. And this guy
saying that I am wrong. All Right, Bill,

792
00:46:05,491 --> 00:46:07,920
love your podcast and it's great to
see you are getting more and more

793
00:46:07,921 --> 00:46:08,754
recognition.

794
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:12,570
I'm from Massachusetts and heard your
comment on the podcast about Jimmy's

795
00:46:12,571 --> 00:46:14,520
possibly originating as a racist term.

796
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:18,840
This is a bogus Smith and the history
of Jimmy's is innocent and actually

797
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:23,910
philanthropy pep thick. I can never
say that word. It's a philanthropist.

798
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:28,650
And whenever I see it, I can't
say it philanthropic, I dunno.

799
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:33,390
Fill anthropic fill
anthropic philanthropic.

800
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:34,801
Um,

801
00:46:34,801 --> 00:46:38,160
so please don't get sucked into these
urban myths just because you heard it from

802
00:46:38,161 --> 00:46:40,800
some idiot cunt.
Um,

803
00:46:40,801 --> 00:46:43,680
seems that I've heard you blast
these types in your acts anyways.

804
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,140
Thought you would find this
interesting and go fuck yourself.

805
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:50,520
The Jimmy story is below.
There is nothing racial about the name.

806
00:46:50,521 --> 00:46:53,550
Jimmy's and there are no connection
whatsoever with the Jim crow laws.

807
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:58,440
Jim Crow laws were anti African laws that
many southern states passed following

808
00:46:58,441 --> 00:47:02,430
the civil war and they had
nothing whatsoever to do
with maths at Massachusetts.

809
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:03,960
Now, wasn't Jim. Jim Crow was,

810
00:47:03,961 --> 00:47:08,550
was basically separate but equal and
it was never equal. It was separate.

811
00:47:08,551 --> 00:47:13,140
Shittier, but called equal. Correct.
Is that what it is? Anyways,

812
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:14,670
um,
here's the story.

813
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:18,960
The bring of family of Boston was in
the restaurant business in the early 19

814
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:23,240
hundreds of 1911 based on a
bequest, a bequest, not a real,

815
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:26,490
not a request of request
from the patriarch.

816
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:30,640
The Peter Brendt Brigham
Hospital was founded.

817
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:36,150
It later merged with the Boston lying
in hospital and is now known as the

818
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:40,090
Brigham Women's Hospital. Three years
later in 1914 a son Edward l bring them,

819
00:47:40,091 --> 00:47:43,420
started the ice cream restaurant
in Newton called Brigham's.

820
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:46,330
I remember that place.
Brigham's was the shit.

821
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:52,430
It later became a chain of restaurants
in 1927 Sidney Farber graduate.

822
00:47:52,481 --> 00:47:56,650
Jesus Christ is going to be this long.
Can I just tap out and say, you're right.

823
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:02,270
1927 Sidney Farber graduated from
Harvard Medical School and became a

824
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:03,620
okay,

825
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:04,790
a pathologist.

826
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:05,980
Okay.

827
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:09,940
At Peter Bent Brigham hospital cheese.
It's too fucking long.

828
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:14,670
In 1929 he became a resident just at
the children's hospital. Meanwhile,

829
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:18,440
1930 a candy can't fade out of
Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Do it.

830
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:21,490
Can you just get to the fucking point?

831
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:27,300
Bethlehem Pennsylvania called just born
introduced chocolate grains that could

832
00:48:27,301 --> 00:48:28,740
be used as a dessert topping.

833
00:48:28,741 --> 00:48:32,850
The man who ran the machine that
made the grain was Jimmy Bartholomew.

834
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:37,050
So the grains did.
Grains became known as Jimmy's,

835
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:40,710
you know,
everything was sounded great.

836
00:48:40,711 --> 00:48:44,430
You had all these dates and all these
long names of hospitals and they like,

837
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:49,360
yeah, with some guy named Jimmy
and he came up with them. Uh,

838
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:51,240
fast forward to 1947,

839
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:56,270
Dr Farber established the Children's
cancer foundation known as the Dana Farber

840
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:58,350
Cancer Institute.
The next year in 1948,

841
00:48:58,351 --> 00:49:01,380
Dr Farber established a fund
raise money for children's cancer.

842
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:06,390
A 12 year old boy named in our Gustafason.
This is such bullshit at this point.

843
00:49:06,391 --> 00:49:10,380
These names are too long. Became
the poster boy. He attracted wides,

844
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:11,670
assists the Jimmy Fund.

845
00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:13,670
MMM.

846
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:18,520
We attracted widespread attention after
1948 radio broadcast for the purpose

847
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:19,870
keeping the boys and MIT.

848
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:24,900
It was agreed that the poster boy should
have a more all American sounding name.

849
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:29,230
Yeah. Cause no one will care
about an ENR Gustafason.

850
00:49:30,930 --> 00:49:31,140
Okay.

851
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:33,330
In our Gustafason once
you'll have your papers,

852
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:37,800
Peter Bent Brigham Hospital where Dr Fiber
First participated, supported the fun,

853
00:49:37,950 --> 00:49:38,790
bring them restaurants.

854
00:49:38,791 --> 00:49:42,720
Also decided to help raise money for the
institute by offering to put chocolate

855
00:49:42,721 --> 00:49:45,720
grains on top of ice cream cones
and Sundaes for an extra penny.

856
00:49:45,930 --> 00:49:48,660
They got the grains from
the Jess born company,

857
00:49:48,661 --> 00:49:52,590
which sold them as Jimmy's the penny
went into the fund. When you got Jimmy's,

858
00:49:52,591 --> 00:49:55,950
the boys nickname became Jimmy and the
fund became known as the Jimmy Fund.

859
00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:59,340
Jimmy was a big fan of the
Boston Braves baseball team.

860
00:49:59,610 --> 00:50:01,710
Today they are the Atlanta Braves.
Holy Shit.

861
00:50:01,711 --> 00:50:03,180
Now we've got the history of baseball.

862
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:08,400
When the braise moved from Boston in 1953
the red sox took over as the sponsors

863
00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:12,300
to the Jimmy Fund. That's how the
sprinkles became known as Jimmy's. Well,

864
00:50:12,301 --> 00:50:16,800
you know what sir? Like
if that is an all true,

865
00:50:16,890 --> 00:50:19,740
that is the greatest filibustering
ever. All right, well fuck it.

866
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:21,780
I'll call them jimmies
again because you said so.

867
00:50:21,781 --> 00:50:25,380
Another unknown client who has a bunch
of dates with hospitals and all of that

868
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:30,410
and now know the rest of the story.

869
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:35,660
Jesus fucking Christ was that long.
You know,

870
00:50:35,661 --> 00:50:38,570
it's funny you heard all of it now
it would be great to see if he could,

871
00:50:38,571 --> 00:50:42,170
how much you could actually
remember and repeat. Hey Bill,

872
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,570
how did the name Jimmy's come along?
Ah,

873
00:50:44,571 --> 00:50:49,460
there was a guy who liked ice crave
and he knew someone at a hospital.

874
00:50:49,461 --> 00:50:53,730
Then a guy named Gustafason got
sick and then there was a gym.

875
00:50:53,731 --> 00:50:58,730
He showed up with the ice creams and uh,
they would call Jeremy's,

876
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:02,270
there you go. That's, that
sounds how it came about.

877
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:07,660
Public service announcement for
divorce listeners. Hey Bill,

878
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:08,780
a couple of weeks ago,

879
00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:12,560
you advise to force guys to go to
another city to increase their chances of

880
00:51:12,561 --> 00:51:17,030
getting laid by a good 40%.
Did I say that? You know,

881
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:18,200
I'm just trying to fill an hour.

882
00:51:18,350 --> 00:51:20,690
I don't even remember saying that
and now that I've read it back,

883
00:51:20,691 --> 00:51:25,370
it doesn't even make sense to
me. Um, I concur. Oh, okay.
I guess it does make sense.

884
00:51:25,371 --> 00:51:29,690
Allow me to provide a public service to
these guys and save them the trouble of

885
00:51:29,691 --> 00:51:33,200
trying to figure out where to
go get to Amsterdam. Gentlemen.

886
00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:38,990
I moved here four years ago from
Canada and it's been insane.

887
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:40,760
There are a couple of reasons for this.

888
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:44,000
None of which has to do
with weed or hookers though.

889
00:51:44,001 --> 00:51:48,830
You can go that route if
you want. Reasons. Dutch
women, gorgeous with bodies,

890
00:51:48,831 --> 00:51:53,210
sculpted by a lifetime of dairy
products and riding a bike, uh,

891
00:51:53,211 --> 00:51:55,700
as a definite bonus.
Uh,

892
00:51:55,730 --> 00:52:00,730
they are bored to death of
Dutch guys who have zero game.

893
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:05,870
It's like negative game. They're
all 14 year olds. No sense of humor,

894
00:52:05,871 --> 00:52:10,790
no manners, no flirting skills, Nada.
Wait a minute. The whole country,

895
00:52:10,791 --> 00:52:13,490
there's not one guy who's
fudge just slaying it.

896
00:52:14,870 --> 00:52:19,310
There's always one guy in every
grade is a handful, but then there's,

897
00:52:19,311 --> 00:52:24,160
that was the chosen one that
just has that thing anyways,

898
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:26,060
whatever. And he goes, as a foreigner,

899
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:29,240
you're way ahead of these stiffs as
soon as you step off the plane. Yeah,

900
00:52:29,241 --> 00:52:31,730
that's true. Because you have the
accent. You're from somewhere different.

901
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:37,460
Tell me about Winnipeg. Um, and
it's not just the Dutch chicks.

902
00:52:37,461 --> 00:52:40,580
The city is filled with hot
European women either on a,

903
00:52:40,610 --> 00:52:45,380
on a weekend bender as a highly
impressionable intern because their own

904
00:52:45,381 --> 00:52:49,700
country's economy is even in a shittier
place or as an expatriate sewing their

905
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:54,800
oats. It's a freaking gold
mine. Uh, you can get here,

906
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:58,850
you can get by here easily on English.
Everyone speaks it really well.

907
00:52:59,030 --> 00:53:02,690
Throwing a couple of Dutch words,
Shit that you can learn on the plane,

908
00:53:02,691 --> 00:53:07,340
and you've upped your chances by
another 30% anyway, they have at boys.

909
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:12,860
Uh, go fuck yourself. Oh, it says go
frig yourself. Canadian politeness.

910
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:16,940
Yeah. You know, that's something I wish
I knew back when I was a single man.

911
00:53:17,410 --> 00:53:21,770
Just get your ass to a different
country and your intro intro instantly.

912
00:53:21,771 --> 00:53:24,980
You're interesting. You
have an accent, you,

913
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:30,190
your clothes are a little different
at different perspective. You know,

914
00:53:30,191 --> 00:53:33,090
you've seen that these fucking cops
come over from England MLL love.

915
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:35,280
Oh God,
I love your art.

916
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:39,460
This sitting there with
their fucking tight pants,

917
00:53:39,461 --> 00:53:42,370
you could see their ankles in their
balls all at the same time. You know?

918
00:53:43,290 --> 00:53:46,390
I'm all right for the birds.
Hey Bill,

919
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,400
I got these two parakeets.

920
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:53,570
My problem is that these
little dudes don't like me. Uh,

921
00:53:53,571 --> 00:53:56,120
I've tried whistling petting them.
I don't know.

922
00:53:56,121 --> 00:53:59,210
You can pet a bird and
squirting them with water.

923
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:03,710
Uh, do they like water? I'm
guessing that that's a good thing.

924
00:54:03,711 --> 00:54:05,750
Parakeets like water.
I don't know.

925
00:54:05,751 --> 00:54:08,870
Why don't we ask the fucking Jimmy's
guy to write a fucking nine pages on it?

926
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:12,350
I love all them upset with that guy
cause he actually did the research as

927
00:54:12,351 --> 00:54:16,580
opposed to me who were like, oh yeah,
I overheard this in a bar. So anyways,

928
00:54:16,581 --> 00:54:17,900
this guy's petting his birds.

929
00:54:17,901 --> 00:54:22,400
He's fucking get them with the
water hose is Westlawn Adam.

930
00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:24,363
Woo.

931
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:27,030
Yeah.

932
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:30,390
I'm all to no avail.
I know they're only birds,

933
00:54:30,391 --> 00:54:32,760
but I feel they hold a
deep resentment towards me.

934
00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:34,980
Where your clip their wings
and you stuck them in a cage.

935
00:54:34,981 --> 00:54:37,530
How would you feel somebody cut
your fucking nuts off, came by,

936
00:54:37,531 --> 00:54:39,360
started whistling at you
and throwing water at you.

937
00:54:40,470 --> 00:54:41,303
You know,

938
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:45,090
I got an idea. Why don't you leave
him alone? She opened the cage.

939
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:47,013
Right?

940
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:50,520
Why don't you take him to one of those
car Dashi and doctors and I get a little

941
00:54:50,521 --> 00:54:52,830
botox in their fucking
wings and let them fly away.

942
00:54:54,570 --> 00:54:55,300
Okay.

943
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:57,970
Would that be annoying to you?
If you are in a cage,

944
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:02,010
your arms cut off at the fucking elbows
and somebody came up and running and

945
00:55:02,011 --> 00:55:03,530
then whistle and they
started speaking English.

946
00:55:03,531 --> 00:55:07,090
How are you speaking English at you?
He goes,

947
00:55:07,091 --> 00:55:10,750
I think it's because I yelled at
them. Oh, here we go. He goes,

948
00:55:10,751 --> 00:55:13,000
I think they were sent me
because I yelled at them.

949
00:55:14,170 --> 00:55:14,560
Yeah.

950
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:19,170
What did you, what, what, what were
they doing? Uh, I said no with my,

951
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:21,310
during my shows,
uh,

952
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:24,610
basically I had to scold them
for pooping in their water dish,

953
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:27,640
but I had their best interest in mind.

954
00:55:29,270 --> 00:55:29,840
Okay.

955
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:34,240
Do you understand how fucking insane you
are that you feel like you can talk to

956
00:55:34,241 --> 00:55:37,390
a bird?
You know,

957
00:55:37,391 --> 00:55:41,650
why don't you like not stick
the water dish, you know,

958
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:44,650
underwear that,
that was it underneath the swing.

959
00:55:45,490 --> 00:55:49,210
Or what I would do is I just get a
bigger cage. I get a bigger fucking cage.

960
00:55:49,450 --> 00:55:53,350
I put the water in the center that
isn't near any of those trapeze bars and

961
00:55:53,351 --> 00:55:56,260
hopefully they won't be at the top
of the cage is still shit down on it.

962
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:00,060
Or I would accept the
fact that it's a burden,

963
00:56:00,061 --> 00:56:02,800
a cage and that it's,
you know,

964
00:56:03,890 --> 00:56:04,410
okay.

965
00:56:04,410 --> 00:56:07,680
Basically anything at the bottom of
the cage might as well be the city of

966
00:56:07,681 --> 00:56:08,514
Dresden.

967
00:56:08,590 --> 00:56:09,423
Right.

968
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:13,060
I would just take that as part of it.
I wouldn't yell at the birds,

969
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:16,900
but it was this guy, he had to scold
them for pooping in their water,

970
00:56:17,470 --> 00:56:21,130
but I had their best interest in mind.
I heard if they drink contaminated water,

971
00:56:21,131 --> 00:56:24,520
it can cause a disease that makes
all their feathers fall off.

972
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:28,270
While you could also read up on it as
opposed to me who just repeat shits that

973
00:56:28,271 --> 00:56:31,000
they, here he goes, I do a
lot for those little guys.

974
00:56:31,001 --> 00:56:35,590
But putting jackets on nude parakeets
isn't one of them. Even if I wanted to,

975
00:56:35,591 --> 00:56:40,030
I couldn't, they don't even let me
pet them, let alone dress them. Dude,

976
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:44,470
you're not a bird guy. You
should've got a dog. Uh, he goes,

977
00:56:44,471 --> 00:56:45,700
when I originally bought them,

978
00:56:45,701 --> 00:56:48,250
I imagine I would have one pair
of keyed on each shoulder. Why?

979
00:56:48,251 --> 00:56:51,460
Hanging out around my house. But
instead, whenever I approached the case,

980
00:56:51,461 --> 00:56:55,810
they freeze and horror every time
they do that, I can't help her.

981
00:56:55,811 --> 00:56:59,560
Remember my brother's face when he fell
through the ice. We had to pull him out.

982
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:02,320
I thought maybe if I bought
them more toys, they would,

983
00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:07,510
that would somehow help to birds.
Motivation isn't more toys.

984
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:10,270
Their motivation is you not having energy.
Like,

985
00:57:10,271 --> 00:57:14,680
I'm going to fucking twist your head off
to their wings are clips so they can't

986
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:18,730
escape. You got him stuck in a cage
that terrified and you yelled at him.

987
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:22,600
I would say more than on one
occasion you yelled at them.

988
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:26,030
All right.
Um,

989
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:28,990
you need to fucking relax.

990
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:31,153
All right,

991
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:33,520
listen to this.
Would you,

992
00:57:33,521 --> 00:57:36,550
would you want to be like your
job to be in a cage all day?

993
00:57:37,470 --> 00:57:38,303
You know,

994
00:57:38,910 --> 00:57:40,290
and then some,
you know,

995
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:42,420
I dunno.

996
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:45,270
Some giant comes home and puts
you on his fucking shoulders

997
00:57:46,370 --> 00:57:49,250
and your whole job is to enhance the
giants fucking life. You know what?

998
00:57:49,251 --> 00:57:51,080
I'm having a little bit of
empathy for the fucking birds.

999
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:56,240
What I would do is I would just have a
totally relaxed energy and hope that they

1000
00:57:56,241 --> 00:58:00,680
forget that you're screamed at them,
treat them nicely.

1001
00:58:00,681 --> 00:58:03,500
Don't try to pet them, just don't fuck
with them. Every time you come over,

1002
00:58:03,501 --> 00:58:07,130
they'll graduate and be like, Oh, this is
the guy who feeds us. Scale brings water.

1003
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:09,650
This guys on our side,
you know,

1004
00:58:09,770 --> 00:58:13,910
as opposed to the mixed messages
that you send to them. Um,

1005
00:58:14,570 --> 00:58:16,820
yeah.
Birch don't give a fuck about toys.

1006
00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:18,813
You know,

1007
00:58:19,810 --> 00:58:22,330
do they? I don't think they do a, he said,

1008
00:58:22,331 --> 00:58:25,270
I bought them a new toy every Friday
on my way home from work and this is a

1009
00:58:25,271 --> 00:58:27,580
ridiculous amount of toys in the cage.
And here's the kicker.

1010
00:58:27,581 --> 00:58:29,680
They haven't played with the single one.
Not once.

1011
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:32,350
What do do you look at the birds outside?

1012
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:33,910
Okay.

1013
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:36,970
They're, they're not out there. If
you leave your toddler's toys outside,

1014
00:58:36,971 --> 00:58:37,751
they don't go,
oh good.

1015
00:58:37,751 --> 00:58:40,630
They left and then they go down and they
start playing on his fucking tricycle.

1016
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:42,850
He goes,
they just stare at me.

1017
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:43,970
Okay.

1018
00:58:43,970 --> 00:58:44,900
I took them to the vet,

1019
00:58:44,901 --> 00:58:47,900
but he spent more time looking at
his phone and the birds. Anyways.

1020
00:58:47,901 --> 00:58:52,160
Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
Um, I think you should find a bird lover,

1021
00:58:52,161 --> 00:58:52,994
sir.

1022
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:53,980
Okay.

1023
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:55,330
And now give the birds away

1024
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:57,880
and then,
um,

1025
00:58:58,560 --> 00:58:58,920
I dunno,

1026
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:02,790
I think you should get your temper in
check and before and before you do that

1027
00:59:02,791 --> 00:59:06,090
yet, get your temper in check.
And then if you want to get a dog,

1028
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:09,270
it seems like you want more
interaction with the pet.

1029
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:12,510
Most people get birds because they can
have an interaction with an animal,

1030
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:16,080
but they don't have to walk it down
the street. And uh, this is very,

1031
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:18,390
a lot less interaction with them.

1032
00:59:18,391 --> 00:59:23,391
You seem like you want a bird to
like a dog slash a little kid.

1033
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:27,980
Like, Hey, daddy's home. I
bought you a fire engine. Oh boy.

1034
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:31,580
Look at that as a bell work. You know,
somehow you want the bird to do that.

1035
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:37,510
Um, yeah, please stop
yelling at your birds.

1036
00:59:38,270 --> 00:59:42,190
All right. They can't help if they
shit in the water. You know, the birds,

1037
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:47,860
they're not supposed to be in cages. They
fly around. And they shit as they fly.

1038
00:59:49,150 --> 00:59:51,730
They shit when they're on branches,
when they have to go, they go,

1039
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:53,890
they don't have any stress,

1040
00:59:54,820 --> 00:59:57,940
they don't have any shame and
there's water all over the place.

1041
00:59:58,780 --> 01:00:02,080
So then I got them in this fucking
cage with little confined area water.

1042
01:00:02,730 --> 01:00:05,440
You know what are, what are
they supposed to do? Well,

1043
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:10,270
what do I know about the restaurant
business? All right, size issues.

1044
01:00:10,330 --> 01:00:15,130
Oh Jesus. Here we go again. Here we
go again. Maybe you need a motorcycle.

1045
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:18,600
All right.
Sizing issue,

1046
01:00:18,601 --> 01:00:23,570
a Cape Pasta Bill and Nardo Oh
la bill or not. They'll get past

1047
01:00:25,230 --> 01:00:26,720
show.
Uh,

1048
01:00:26,910 --> 01:00:31,470
we all know your disability
to read pop properly.

1049
01:00:33,070 --> 01:00:35,440
Well, you know what? You don't even
have to write a sentence properly.

1050
01:00:35,441 --> 01:00:38,970
Half of this shit is I get too far in
front of myself and the other half,

1051
01:00:38,990 --> 01:00:40,690
you guys don't have to
write a fucking sentence.

1052
01:00:41,590 --> 01:00:44,230
We all know your disability
to read properly.

1053
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:47,020
Is that even written correctly
or am I a moron? Again,

1054
01:00:48,190 --> 01:00:50,980
we all know you have a disability
when it comes to reading properly.

1055
01:00:50,981 --> 01:00:53,590
Isn't that how it's supposed to be?
So when I don't have to fuck,

1056
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:58,900
so I'm going to give it my best
shot to keep it very short. Okay.

1057
01:00:58,901 --> 01:01:02,290
You come in with the arrogance like you
have all light life figured out, right,

1058
01:01:02,291 --> 01:01:06,370
and you've got something
tattooed on your rib cage. Um,

1059
01:01:06,820 --> 01:01:09,610
as you may have read the
subject title of this email,

1060
01:01:09,611 --> 01:01:13,000
you may already know where
this is heading. Yeah.

1061
01:01:13,001 --> 01:01:17,110
You seem pretty cocky for a guy
with a little dick. He says,

1062
01:01:17,111 --> 01:01:20,110
I recently got into an argument
with my girlfriend who I've,

1063
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:23,140
who've I've been with for a little
more than two and a half years,

1064
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:28,000
where she told me that she
wished I had a bigger deck.

1065
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:32,590
Oh Man. Ah, yeah. That
relationship is over, dude.

1066
01:01:33,670 --> 01:01:37,390
DEB relationship is over at
one or two ways. Either one,

1067
01:01:37,391 --> 01:01:40,870
she's just trying to be so fucking
mean to you that you break up with her

1068
01:01:40,871 --> 01:01:45,790
because she doesn't want to be the
bad guy or she's just such a fucking

1069
01:01:47,250 --> 01:01:52,250
self-involved human being that she
doesn't realize like how mean that is.

1070
01:01:53,290 --> 01:01:55,720
That'd be like he said, yeah, I like
you. I wish the tits were bigger.

1071
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:57,130
That would just be the
mean is fucking thing.

1072
01:01:57,160 --> 01:02:00,340
Why would you say that to
somebody that you cared about?

1073
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,190
That's a horrible thing to
say, sir. You know what?

1074
01:02:03,191 --> 01:02:07,140
You started off as an arrogant cunt.
Now I'm feeling bad for you, dude.

1075
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:09,040
That's not the mother.
Your kids

1076
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:12,980
just take the dick out of the equation.

1077
01:02:12,981 --> 01:02:16,180
Why don't you just said your nose is
too big? That's just fucking a, that's,

1078
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,570
that's, that's, that's just a
terrible person says she goes,

1079
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:25,050
I was shocked to hear this and didn't
know what to say. There's nothing to say.

1080
01:02:25,051 --> 01:02:26,160
There's nothing you can do about it.

1081
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:29,610
This is the first time she
ever mentioned my penis size.

1082
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:31,860
Also the first time in my life.
By the way,

1083
01:02:31,861 --> 01:02:33,720
I guess anybody's ever
brought it up to be honest.

1084
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:38,970
I don't know that I'm not well
endowed with my 5.5 inch rocket.

1085
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:42,180
You're a little below average, sir. I'm
not going to lie to you now being me.

1086
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:46,560
You know, you can grab the rim, but you
can't stuff at home. You know what I mean?

1087
01:02:47,340 --> 01:02:51,570
Um, and I did have little, uh,

1088
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:55,620
have insecurities about it in the past,
but learn to accept it and moved on.

1089
01:02:56,220 --> 01:03:00,180
I never heard any of my former bed
partner girls complain and the sex was

1090
01:03:00,181 --> 01:03:02,580
usually great.
Um,

1091
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:05,310
I know that it may sound ridiculous,

1092
01:03:05,311 --> 01:03:09,810
but those few words were heartbreaking
to hear it put a big giant stain on my

1093
01:03:09,811 --> 01:03:12,210
confidence. Yeah. It's a
terrible thing that she said.

1094
01:03:12,570 --> 01:03:15,720
I haven't felt like having sex ever since.
And she made oh,

1095
01:03:15,721 --> 01:03:19,360
was ever since she made that remark.
And I am afraid it's going to be awhile.

1096
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:23,190
I haven't spoken to her since
the arguments since I work a lot.

1097
01:03:23,191 --> 01:03:26,850
We don't live together. I
know it's a stupid thing to
be upset about. No, it isn't,

1098
01:03:26,851 --> 01:03:30,960
sir. You're a 100% and the right hundred
percent in the right. And he goes,

1099
01:03:30,961 --> 01:03:34,610
and I usually don't really
care about penis sizes, blah.

1100
01:03:34,810 --> 01:03:39,540
But hearing that your small from your
own girlfriend is a whole other story.

1101
01:03:39,890 --> 01:03:40,590
Um,
typically,

1102
01:03:40,590 --> 01:03:45,420
typically not that guy that gets back at
her by pointing out her physical flaws,

1103
01:03:45,421 --> 01:03:49,890
but I don't know where to go from here.
Uh,

1104
01:03:49,930 --> 01:03:53,640
it's even more difficult texting with her.
What do I do? Bill? Got Any advice? Okay.

1105
01:03:53,641 --> 01:03:55,290
You said you don't know
where to go from here.

1106
01:03:55,440 --> 01:04:00,420
I can tell you exactly what to go right
out our front fucking door. That's it.

1107
01:04:00,421 --> 01:04:03,180
It's a wrap, sir. It's a wrap. Okay.

1108
01:04:04,410 --> 01:04:04,980
Yeah.

1109
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:09,660
Now listen, I'm not saying that she's
wrong for wanting a bigger dick.

1110
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:15,220
Okay?
Like she needs more to satisfy or,

1111
01:04:15,221 --> 01:04:15,811
or whatever.

1112
01:04:15,811 --> 01:04:20,010
Or She just wants to go out and bang
some fucking big Dick Dude at this point.

1113
01:04:20,830 --> 01:04:25,050
All right? You know,
but her tact is wrong.

1114
01:04:25,650 --> 01:04:28,470
Okay? You, you, you accepted yourself,

1115
01:04:28,471 --> 01:04:32,910
which is one of the greatest things you
can do that leads towards being happy

1116
01:04:33,030 --> 01:04:35,730
every day, which leads you to
treating the people around you,

1117
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:37,060
okay?

1118
01:04:37,060 --> 01:04:40,120
Respectfully. Which leads them
to treating you respectfully,

1119
01:04:40,121 --> 01:04:44,950
which leads to more happiness. She fucked
with the core, your happiness. You know,

1120
01:04:45,310 --> 01:04:46,900
you felt good about yourself.

1121
01:04:46,990 --> 01:04:50,470
She pointed out something and made
you feel horrible about yourself.

1122
01:04:50,471 --> 01:04:55,471
It's one of the worst fucking thing she
could've done as far as mentally to you

1123
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:56,830
and, and, and right now,

1124
01:04:56,831 --> 01:05:01,690
the last thing you want to do is go out
and say the same thing to her. All right?

1125
01:05:03,580 --> 01:05:06,880
If you really want to do just
paraphrase what the fuck I just said.

1126
01:05:09,020 --> 01:05:11,960
It just, just, I dunno and
I would just leave it dead.

1127
01:05:11,961 --> 01:05:16,010
I get in the childish thing to do. This
is what you really want to get it back.

1128
01:05:16,610 --> 01:05:21,250
Just saying challenges,
thing for me to do would point out some,

1129
01:05:21,340 --> 01:05:25,810
some of your physical floss. And the
great thing is is you leave it ambiguous,

1130
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:27,520
okay?

1131
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:30,700
And I guarantee you she's going to be
in a bathroom mirror staring at herself.

1132
01:05:30,730 --> 01:05:31,870
Uh,
if you want to get mean,

1133
01:05:32,620 --> 01:05:35,290
okay,
but um,

1134
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:38,510
you know what this, but I gotta
tell you some of what's even better.

1135
01:05:38,870 --> 01:05:42,320
You got to have this,
what's known as the self esteem breakup,

1136
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:44,573
okay?

1137
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:50,360
Which you totally in the right here
and you just say, listen. All right.

1138
01:05:50,361 --> 01:05:51,230
What you said to me,

1139
01:05:51,231 --> 01:05:55,280
I thought I used to feel good about
myself and what you said to me,

1140
01:05:56,660 --> 01:06:00,830
mess with the core of my own, my own
happiness and how I feel about myself,

1141
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:07,320
and that's not what I'm looking for
in a girlfriend or a potential wife.

1142
01:06:08,140 --> 01:06:09,190
And,
uh,

1143
01:06:10,210 --> 01:06:15,070
I just can't see you ever being a good
mother if you would say something like

1144
01:06:15,071 --> 01:06:17,950
that. It's just something along those
lines. I don't, I don't, I keep going.

1145
01:06:17,951 --> 01:06:21,610
Me Don't call me, uh,
whatever the fuck I just said.

1146
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,660
I was just trying to paraphrase what the
fuck I said, but it, dude, this, this is,

1147
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:29,140
you should feel good about
yourself. All right? You know, you,

1148
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:32,140
you're not a porn star, but you're
also, you know, you're not like a,

1149
01:06:33,650 --> 01:06:37,870
you're not what she's making out to be
here. All right? That's it. You still,

1150
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:41,110
you're still in the game, sir. Okay.
You're not part of the starting five. Hey,

1151
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:44,770
neither am I. You know, but you and
I, we come off that bench. Okay.

1152
01:06:44,890 --> 01:06:48,580
We're the kind of guys, well, the
guys that go in the corners, right?

1153
01:06:51,870 --> 01:06:54,610
Uh, yeah. Man, that's, that's you're,
you're a hundred percent advice.

1154
01:06:54,611 --> 01:06:57,250
My advice would be that this girl is,

1155
01:06:57,310 --> 01:07:01,820
is not anywhere near the level
of maturity she needs to be and,

1156
01:07:02,070 --> 01:07:05,760
uh, might never even
get to that level. Um,

1157
01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:07,900
the point,

1158
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:12,170
the redeeming thing that I can say to her
is she has such a difficult time doing

1159
01:07:12,171 --> 01:07:16,100
what she wants to do in life that maybe
she wanted to break up with you for

1160
01:07:16,101 --> 01:07:18,560
awhile and she didn't know how
to do it and it was building up.

1161
01:07:18,561 --> 01:07:23,180
And then there was just an argument and
then she just said that. Or, um, I dunno.

1162
01:07:23,181 --> 01:07:26,780
Have you said anything to her?
I have no idea.

1163
01:07:28,850 --> 01:07:29,683
MMM.

1164
01:07:30,530 --> 01:07:33,830
Oh, it's funny. He says, uh,
thanks for the weekly podcast.

1165
01:07:33,831 --> 01:07:37,910
You have no idea what it means
to me. See, when Amsterdam, well,

1166
01:07:37,911 --> 01:07:39,560
from what this other guy was riding,
sir,

ladies out there in Amsterdam,

bikes are in. Great God. Damn. Shake.

1169
01:07:49,941 --> 01:07:54,560

binge watch your favorite shows.

1222
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:07,820
I'm going to use Hulu plus to catch
up on the old family guy episodes I've

1223
01:11:07,821 --> 01:11:11,600
missed when I was on the road or Rockford
files or whatever the hell else I want

to watch, or maybe all the Lord of the
rings. Wouldn't that be phenomenal?

1225
01:11:15,570 --> 01:11:16,560
Didn't see an episode,

1226
01:11:16,561 --> 01:11:21,561
a new girl that's on Hulu plus two and
if I ever decide to watch lost Hulu plus

banner or go to Hulu plus.com/burr okay.
There you go everybody.

1235
01:11:51,330 --> 01:11:56,220
And that right there is all the
advertising for this week. Um, all right,

1236
01:11:56,221 --> 01:11:58,410
where am I going here? Back
to the question, Bulgaria.

1237
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:01,790
Everybody ate a Billy red face.

1238
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:04,860
Heard you ask about
Bulgaria in eastern Europe.

1239
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:09,660
I've traveled around Europe over the
last five years in Bulgaria is very nice.

1240
01:12:09,810 --> 01:12:13,440
Plus they love Americans.
Serbia is pretty nice too.

1241
01:12:13,441 --> 01:12:16,830
They don't love Americans like the bulks,
but uh,

1242
01:12:16,831 --> 01:12:20,070
it's still safe even though
we bombed them in the 90s.

1243
01:12:20,071 --> 01:12:22,140
They even have a pretty good
sense of humor about it.

1244
01:12:22,350 --> 01:12:27,210
And if they know you're American, you're
American. Perfect. Strangers will walk.

1245
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:32,370
Or if they know you're American dish
should be a common common there. Perfect.

1246
01:12:32,371 --> 01:12:37,080
Strangers will walk to you and ask and
ask the question, why did you bomb us?

1247
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:41,070
And even they settle, celebrate
a battle they lost to us. Well,

1248
01:12:41,071 --> 01:12:44,430
if they came up to me and said, why
did you bomb us? I would be like,

1249
01:12:44,431 --> 01:12:48,900
I wasn't even aware of we did that.
What happened?

1250
01:12:49,950 --> 01:12:54,180
Uh, that would make it even worse. May
even celebrate a battle. They lost us.

1251
01:12:54,181 --> 01:12:57,390
Serbia, Serbia has been very
commercialized over the last 10 years.

1252
01:12:57,750 --> 01:13:01,080
And there is a strict code of
masculinity amongst the men,

1253
01:13:01,081 --> 01:13:04,050
kind of like Americans plus,
I don't even know what that means.

1254
01:13:04,170 --> 01:13:09,170
Plus the exchange rate is great all over
the former Yugoslavia and instead of

1255
01:13:10,141 --> 01:13:11,310
booking a hotel,

1256
01:13:11,730 --> 01:13:15,510
you can rent a very nice apartment for
a month and it would actually be cheaper

1257
01:13:15,511 --> 01:13:19,350
and nicer than a hotel because there's
no first or last or at least as long as

1258
01:13:19,351 --> 01:13:22,740
you have cash in a place to crash,
stay away from Romania.

1259
01:13:22,741 --> 01:13:25,470
The only good thing I heard about
that country is the country,

1260
01:13:26,670 --> 01:13:31,410
which is beautiful in the summer. The
rest of the year it looks like Apalasia

1261
01:13:33,650 --> 01:13:36,440
I don't even know what that means. I
don't, I don't even know what that is.

1262
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:42,140
Apple Laka um, I, yeah,

1263
01:13:42,141 --> 01:13:44,120
I always feel like if I'm going
to get kidnapped in Europe,

1264
01:13:44,121 --> 01:13:48,020
I always feel like it's going to be in
eastern Europe. I would think of that.

1265
01:13:48,021 --> 01:13:49,430
And you never hear
anything about Bulgaria,

1266
01:13:49,431 --> 01:13:52,400
what the weight and what the fuck
did we do? I need to know this.

1267
01:13:52,790 --> 01:13:55,220
We're gonna be dropping
bombs on people in a bad way.

1268
01:13:56,170 --> 01:13:56,590
Okay.

1269
01:13:56,590 --> 01:13:57,760
We bombed Serbia.

1270
01:13:59,160 --> 01:13:59,430
Yeah.

1271
01:13:59,430 --> 01:14:04,220
Was that when there are
other Croatia, the Serbians,

1272
01:14:04,550 --> 01:14:08,420
Bosnia, Herzegovina. We were all
fucking battling with each other.

1273
01:14:08,570 --> 01:14:12,160
That's when you get sloppy and checklists
of archaea became independent of

1274
01:14:12,161 --> 01:14:16,060
Russia and now they didn't have a common
enemy and the Russians because they had

1275
01:14:16,061 --> 01:14:16,894
pulled out.

1276
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:22,200
You have to like 1990 and
then they instantly picked
up on these wars that have

1277
01:14:22,821 --> 01:14:26,980
been gone for like 90 years. Isn't
that what happened? Ah, Jesus.

1278
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:29,380
Hey,
America

1279
01:14:31,230 --> 01:14:32,940
bombs Serbia.

1280
01:14:35,340 --> 01:14:35,630
Yeah.

1281
01:14:35,630 --> 01:14:38,150
NATO bombing of Yugoslavia.
All right.

1282
01:14:39,110 --> 01:14:42,500
Reason why I hit USA
America bombing of Serbia.

1283
01:14:44,890 --> 01:14:49,210
That's a video. Oh, Bill Clinton.
Oh yeah, I remember that. Oh,

1284
01:14:49,211 --> 01:14:50,170
didn't he bomb them?

1285
01:14:50,171 --> 01:14:55,171
Because he fucking was fingering in that
fucking refrigerated faced fucking mess

1286
01:14:57,260 --> 01:15:00,190
of a woman.
You make me feel like a younger man.

1287
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:03,470
Can I stick this cigar and you pussy.
Um,

1288
01:15:03,490 --> 01:15:07,480
the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia was NATO's
military operation against the federal

1289
01:15:07,481 --> 01:15:10,120
public of Yugoslavia
during the Kosovo war.

1290
01:15:10,180 --> 01:15:15,130
The strikes lasted from March 24th,
1999 to June 10th. My birthday,

1291
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:19,150
1999 the official NATO operation,
well,

1292
01:15:19,151 --> 01:15:22,180
code was operation,
allied force, Yada, Yada,

1293
01:15:22,181 --> 01:15:24,760
Yada goals,

1294
01:15:25,930 --> 01:15:30,070
NATO's objective and the Kosovo conflict
or stated and the North Atlantic

1295
01:15:30,071 --> 01:15:33,280
countings means, but yeah, and I imagine
they said it was something about freedom,

1296
01:15:33,281 --> 01:15:36,490
but it was really about some sort
of natural resource or power.

1297
01:15:37,670 --> 01:15:38,630
MMM.

1298
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:44,170
Strategy today. What the fuck is
it? Come on, let's get to the,

1299
01:15:45,460 --> 01:15:49,390
what was her name? Margo Adams.
What was the name of that? Poor.

1300
01:15:49,450 --> 01:15:50,590
That unfortunate woman,

1301
01:15:52,420 --> 01:15:53,253
you know,

1302
01:15:54,470 --> 01:15:59,230
naval civilian. You don't want
to look up Bill Clinton bombs.

1303
01:15:59,610 --> 01:16:03,830
You Go Slavia
wait,

1304
01:16:03,831 --> 01:16:08,130
Margo Adams was the fucking chicken.
Uh,

1305
01:16:08,170 --> 01:16:10,360
what's his face bank from the Red Sox?

1306
01:16:12,660 --> 01:16:16,860
The hell was his name. Now he
still is. Wade Boggs. Bill Clinton

1307
01:16:18,660 --> 01:16:21,760
bombs.
Yugoslavia.

1308
01:16:24,230 --> 01:16:27,850
What the hell was her name?
Was it Margo?

1309
01:16:29,750 --> 01:16:32,680
But again with an m the
fuck was the name of like,

1310
01:16:32,681 --> 01:16:36,010
why are you stuck that cigar and a thing?
I can't remember her fucking name.

1311
01:16:38,110 --> 01:16:42,940
Uh, I'm just going to stick cigar.
Bill Clinton bombs. Yugoslavia cigar.

1312
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:44,710
Let's see if that comes up.

1313
01:16:49,210 --> 01:16:53,110
Bill Clinton,
what really happened?

1314
01:16:56,630 --> 01:16:59,720
It was bombing killed.
224 people.

1315
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:03,260
Why Clinton bombed the
Serbs. All right, here we go.

1316
01:17:05,910 --> 01:17:10,080
Oh, that's just, that's just too long.
You know what? I Dunno why did it,

1317
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:14,850
but Clinton did it. He did it in 1999.
I'll just look at the ground. Yeah,

1318
01:17:14,851 --> 01:17:19,240
sorry about that. Sorry. We
uh, sorry. We bombed. Ah,

1319
01:17:19,350 --> 01:17:22,530
Jesus Christ. All right, well that's a
podcast for this week. Everybody. I know.

1320
01:17:22,531 --> 01:17:27,170
It was kind of all over the
place. Um, as if my life, uh,

1321
01:17:27,180 --> 01:17:29,430
this is the wrap ups for the show here.
Now that the show's over,

1322
01:17:29,431 --> 01:17:32,370
don't forget to support all the
sponsors or just one of them.

1323
01:17:32,430 --> 01:17:35,130
Anything you can support.
Okay. We've got, you know,

1324
01:17:35,131 --> 01:17:39,810
you can get your will done at legal zoom.
You get your voice a he voice things.

1325
01:17:39,811 --> 01:17:41,040
He voice,
uh,

1326
01:17:41,110 --> 01:17:44,100
gives you a toll free number so you
can take business calls from anywhere.

1327
01:17:44,101 --> 01:17:48,490
Sound to the office. You remember it. I've
already talked about this stuff. Uh, no.

1328
01:17:48,490 --> 01:17:51,600
It shows over. You got Hulu plus
you can binge on all those shows.

1329
01:17:51,940 --> 01:17:56,160
If you don't like them, you can check
out Tivo, right. Give you two options.

1330
01:17:56,161 --> 01:17:58,670
You know, you don't want to buy
shaved, go to the dollar, shave clubs.

1331
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:01,680
You don't want to buy the blades.
I hate these fucking wrap ups.

1332
01:18:01,681 --> 01:18:04,410
You guys heard all of this shit before.
That's it. I'm not doing the wrap ups.

1333
01:18:04,411 --> 01:18:09,060
Go Fuck Yourself. I'm all right.
That's the podcast for this week. Okay.

1334
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:13,860
Coming up this week. Why am I shouting?
I am going to be Friday night.

1335
01:18:14,790 --> 01:18:19,230
I'm going to be in Boise, Idaho,
Saturday night, Saturday night,

1336
01:18:19,260 --> 01:18:23,820
Bozeman, Montana. If both
those shows are not sold out,

1337
01:18:23,821 --> 01:18:27,750
they're damn close. Ah, that's, this
is the beginning of the red state tour.

1338
01:18:28,110 --> 01:18:31,820
And uh, then right after that,
then I have to do my acting gig.

1339
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:36,170
And I never tell you guys much about the
acting gigs because so many guys I know

1340
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:40,550
get into movies or whatever and then
they tell people they're in them and then

1341
01:18:40,551 --> 01:18:41,780
they get cut out or whatever.

1342
01:18:41,780 --> 01:18:46,780
So I wait till it's in theaters when
it's in theaters and I'm actually in it.

1343
01:18:47,361 --> 01:18:51,020
Then I tell you I'm in the movie. That
seems to be the best way to go about it.

1344
01:18:51,021 --> 01:18:53,720
But I always a lot of people out
there where you will go, oh, you know,

1345
01:18:53,721 --> 01:18:57,430
you're supposed to be coming to my
fucking flyover state and now you're not.

1346
01:18:57,431 --> 01:19:02,290
What's the deal? Well, um, the
shows have not been canceled.

1347
01:19:02,291 --> 01:19:04,660
They have been rescheduled.
