1
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:06,400
Hey, what's going on? It's bill
bar and a, it's time for the, uh,

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:11,140
Thursday afternoon, Monday morning
podcast just before Friday. And I am

3
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:18,840
just checking in on you. How are you
guys doing? I you having a good day.

4
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:21,270
All right.
Day

5
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:27,810
vindication baby. Ah, fuck.

6
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:32,550
Finally. Finally shut. Nall
you sports. Sportsbar conch,

7
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,200
right the fuck up in the back of your
dumb fucking heads. You knew this was the,

8
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:41,190
you knew, you knew he
was innocent. You can't,

9
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,860
not even innocent. I'm just saying he
gives the whole fucking thing was so fun.

10
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,420
It was so fucking stupid. You
are pisses me off. Obviously.

11
00:00:48,421 --> 00:00:51,100
I'm talking about the Tom
Brady decision here. Um,

12
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,560
which doesn't even say that he's innocent
of all the fucking deflate gate shit,

13
00:00:55,561 --> 00:00:56,550
which pisses me off.

14
00:00:56,551 --> 00:01:01,551
It's just says that the commissioner
didn't execute article 46 on a proper ran

15
00:01:02,441 --> 00:01:04,970
or let the court date.
But I need a scalable whenever,

16
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,510
I guess article 46 has
to do with what the, the,

17
00:01:07,511 --> 00:01:12,420
the steps to commissioner is supposed to
take when he fucking goes to suspend a

18
00:01:12,421 --> 00:01:14,910
player. Evidently, I guess
I don't fucking know.

19
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,600
So basically they didn't have a fucking
case and he tried to fucking rubber

20
00:01:18,601 --> 00:01:21,660
stamp his way through it. I
still, I can't believe it man.

21
00:01:21,661 --> 00:01:25,770
I thought the court was going
to go inside with the fucking,

22
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:32,430
I really did, but fortunately
they didn't end. Um,

23
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:36,900
I dunno. I mean is happy as I am
that it's, it's over. What was,

24
00:01:36,901 --> 00:01:41,130
it was a huge distraction to the team
and it was a big fucking waste of time.

25
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,430
And uh,

26
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,490
I actually saw on Twitter
another Boston guy, uh,

27
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,710
Donny Walberg goes, okay, now what
about all those draft picks we lost?

28
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,640
Which is a great fucking point that
I didn't see anybody else bring up.

29
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,210
Everybody's sitting at skipping down
the street cause Brady's going to be

30
00:02:00,211 --> 00:02:04,050
playing, but we still got fucked
out of all those draft picks. Dude.

31
00:02:04,051 --> 00:02:07,740
How successful are the Patriots that
they are getting fucked with to this

32
00:02:07,741 --> 00:02:08,640
goddamn level?

33
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:14,010
How much of a bunch of fucking
babies is everybody in the,

34
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,671
not everybody,

35
00:02:14,671 --> 00:02:18,690
but I'll the higher ups in the cults
organization grow a fucking Dick.

36
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,450
You lost a game to
fucking drag it through.

37
00:02:21,451 --> 00:02:26,320
This whole thing make literally turned
it into fucking an episode of Falcon

38
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:30,360
Crest or dynasty. I'll go with dynasty. I
never watched either one of those shows,

39
00:02:30,361 --> 00:02:33,840
but it always seemed like somebody was
getting thrown in a pool right there,

40
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,750
dress and makeup on whatever.
I've gotta be honest with you.

41
00:02:36,751 --> 00:02:37,830
I don't even have any fucking,

42
00:02:37,831 --> 00:02:41,880
I don't even give a shit if you're honest
with you. I don't even give a fuck.

43
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,970
Once I saw that he got four
games and then the fifth game,

44
00:02:44,971 --> 00:02:48,000
when he was coming back, they were
going to be playing against the colts.

45
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:52,440
It was just like, is this like a
fucking soap opera? I don't know.

46
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,700
I got that same queasy feeling
when I used to watch the NF one.

47
00:02:55,710 --> 00:03:00,210
I was watching the NBA in the two
thousands and I sit there telling

48
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:02,850
my friends, go on this game.
This game is fucking fixed.

49
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:07,680
And then that got to the point of saying
the NBA is fixed. And of course it was,

50
00:03:07,681 --> 00:03:11,250
ah, you got your tin hat on. You're
fucking, you're a conspiracy theorist.

51
00:03:11,251 --> 00:03:13,260
And what do they do?
They find a fucking mobbed up ref.

52
00:03:13,261 --> 00:03:14,640
Who's throwing fucking games

53
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,680
and then I go, well, there
you go. I'm vindicated. Right?
And everybody's like, well,

54
00:03:18,681 --> 00:03:22,140
it's just one guy. Oh
yeah. It's just one guy.

55
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:27,510
It's always just one guy. That
fucking Guy Oswald. Right.

56
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,510
It's always just one fucking guy,
Oliver north.

57
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:34,800
It's just why Ollie north, he put the
whole fucking thing to get. It's always,

58
00:03:34,801 --> 00:03:36,660
it's always just one guy.

59
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:38,420
Yeah.

60
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,890
Let me tell you something.
If a,

61
00:03:39,891 --> 00:03:43,730
if you're involved in something and you
don't feel like you're getting all the

62
00:03:43,731 --> 00:03:47,240
information from your other fucking
criminals, just know that you're,

63
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,550
you're going to be the guy.
If Shit goes down,

64
00:03:49,551 --> 00:03:52,760
you're the guy going to be left holding
the fucking bag. They always had that.

65
00:03:52,761 --> 00:03:57,761
Any smart criminal fucking organization
always has the guy who's going to be

66
00:03:58,551 --> 00:04:03,350
left holding the bag just in case.
Just in case the shit hits the fan.

67
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,700
Who's a bad guy?
All the north fuck.

68
00:04:07,701 --> 00:04:11,780
And we said Oliver Stone, they're
fucking, what's his face there?

69
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:15,950
Old Shot in the gut.
Lee Harvey Oswald.

70
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,253
MMM.

71
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,170
And a whatever. I ain't want to, I can't
remember what my fucking point was.

72
00:04:22,171 --> 00:04:24,180
Why would you listen to this shit?
I don't give a fuck.

73
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,910
I gotta be honest with you.
I thought that, uh, I gave,

74
00:04:26,911 --> 00:04:31,230
I stopped giving a shit I think
like three months ago when they,

75
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:34,710
when I found out he was appealing it and
then he had to appeal it to the guy who

76
00:04:34,711 --> 00:04:39,480
fucking suspended them. I'm like, Gee, do
you think he's gonna win this one? And,

77
00:04:39,481 --> 00:04:42,510
uh, once they gave him a four game
suspension, I was just like, I, you know,

78
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,410
whatever. I was actually, I was the
guy going, hey, he shouldn't suspend.

79
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:51,120
He shouldn't appeal it. Just
take the suspension, become
a fucking martyr, rest up,

80
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:54,540
you're 38 year old bones
and come back and, and uh,

81
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:56,483
game five.

82
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,110
And I also thought there was no fucking
way that he was going to win it because

83
00:05:01,111 --> 00:05:05,520
I read something where they said that
they usually side with the decision made

84
00:05:05,521 --> 00:05:10,290
by the arbitrators. So, uh, I'm
whatever, I'm happy that it happened,

85
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:15,060
but I also don't really give a shit
who gives a fuck. You know what I mean?

86
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,760
It's,
it's a whole leaks become a fucking joke.

87
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,780
We've got a female ref that
got a female coach. Why?

88
00:05:21,781 --> 00:05:23,910
Because they give a fuck about women.
No,

89
00:05:23,911 --> 00:05:28,140
cause they're doing damage control
because of the ray rice thing.

90
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:30,480
They don't give a shit about women.
I give a fuck about anything. Right.

91
00:05:30,481 --> 00:05:31,350
They give a shit about money.

92
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:34,830
So they're wearing pink for
an entire fucking month.

93
00:05:34,831 --> 00:05:36,940
I don't even know what it
is anymore. Right. And Dude,

94
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,480
I called it as far as he would say.

95
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:44,450
So with all these concussions and all of
that type of shit and now they got all

96
00:05:44,451 --> 00:05:48,230
the women coming into the NFL. I'm calling
it right now, within 10 to 15 years,

97
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,770
the combination of the damage
that this game does does,

98
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,750
and the female

99
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:55,543
mmm

100
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:58,460
intellect being brought into the game,

101
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:01,910
this dumb game.
That's awesome.

102
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:06,970
Where guys bash each other's brains in
will become a much more intelligent game

103
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:12,020
of flag football. I think that
that's what's going to happen.

104
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,880
They're gradually,

105
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:19,180
they're just getting rid of all
the dumb shit that makes men great,

106
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,780
which is hurting one another
in a competitive way.

107
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,680
They're going to get rid of all of it.
They fucking with hockey.

108
00:06:27,681 --> 00:06:29,420
They got to get fighting at a hockey.

109
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:32,570
They're going to get a bunch of
women in the fucking, the NFL.

110
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,480
They'll start wearing pink
all four fucking months.

111
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:40,910
They'll have flags, you know,
maybe play a little two hand touch.

112
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:44,300
They'll start with offensive and
defensive lineman starting in the standup

113
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:48,350
position so they don't smash
into each other. And um,

114
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:55,170
and I dunno, then they'll have some new,
hey, hey, hey, take it easy fucking rules.

115
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:59,000
They'll just keep whittling away at it.
And in the end,

116
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,620
by the time I'm in my eighties,

117
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,970
the NFL and the NHL that
I watched will be like,

118
00:07:04,971 --> 00:07:09,110
I used to go to the Roman Colosseum and
watch Christians getting thrown to the

119
00:07:09,111 --> 00:07:13,640
fucking lions. But you know what? I got
to tell you this. It was a hell of a run.

120
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,890
Was there a hell of a run?

121
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:20,810
You know, they got all women,
uh, sports talk shows now.

122
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:22,030
Okay,

123
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:24,430
they're going to fucking
just through pressure alone,

124
00:07:24,431 --> 00:07:25,960
whether they're good or not,

125
00:07:25,961 --> 00:07:30,610
everyone's going to be so afraid of being
called sexist. They're going to those,

126
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:35,830
they're going to take over the
Terry Bradshaw, Howie long shows.

127
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:38,290
It'll be all women,
all women coaches.

128
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:43,500
It'll be all women all the
time wearing pink and it'll be,

129
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:45,250
it'll be a completely different

130
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,540
thank it's over.
It was a hell of a fucking run.

131
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:53,230
You know,
a lot of guys got hurt,

132
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,840
but a god damn it,
it was entertaining and now it's over.

133
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:03,770
So what are you going to do? It's a new
era. Just sit back and find that view.

134
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:14,450
Ah, fuck me. Good Lord. How
do you fuck up a good thing?

135
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:18,390
How do you fuck up a great
thing like that? Um, anyways,

136
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:22,770
I'm just giving the lady shit.
We all know the biggest lady out.

137
00:08:22,771 --> 00:08:25,980
There's Jim or say Jesus Christ.
You know,

138
00:08:25,981 --> 00:08:30,960
he's fucking fucking hide his face
right now behind a a little parasol.

139
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,830
Xe fucking runs into his office.
Twirling the thing crying. Yeah.

140
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:46,510
Fuck you

141
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:52,810
fucking baby fucking unbelief.

142
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,640
I have been holding my so bad.
Let's not talk about Jim or say,

143
00:08:57,641 --> 00:09:00,450
let's just talk about,
let's just go fucking random here.

144
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,370
All right,
for all you patriot haters out there,

145
00:09:03,371 --> 00:09:07,390
let's just say your next door
neighbor was a drug addict. Okay?

146
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:12,480
Who had a dead mistress and for some
reason he thought your fence was too much

147
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:18,820
on, on his side of the property, even
though you had a fucking God damn,

148
00:09:18,821 --> 00:09:20,080
whatever. Yeah, that's what happened.

149
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:24,610
It's like you put a coat of paint on it
and that extra coat of paint because you

150
00:09:24,611 --> 00:09:28,630
didn't strip it down to the, would you
put that extra coat of paint on it?

151
00:09:28,631 --> 00:09:32,320
And that just started to creep in
end to the other guy's property.

152
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:34,690
Let's just say that.

153
00:09:34,691 --> 00:09:39,550
Does your next door neighbor who's a drug
addict and as a dead mistress hires a

154
00:09:39,551 --> 00:09:44,551
guy who isn't a doctor but says he is
one to build a case against you and let's

155
00:09:45,401 --> 00:09:47,170
just say for some fucking reason

156
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:53,700
it's upheld and you stand to lose $2
million with any of that make any fucking

157
00:09:54,521 --> 00:09:57,100
sense to you.
And furthermore,

158
00:09:57,101 --> 00:09:59,950
when you appealed it and then
the entire thing got reversed,

159
00:09:59,951 --> 00:10:01,810
wouldn't you just be like,
well yeah,

160
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:06,280
that's kind of what it took
the NFL seven months to do.

161
00:10:06,281 --> 00:10:10,810
I feel um,
unfucking believable.

162
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,960
Unfucking believable.
Now, having said that,

163
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:18,760
I think it's going to be a hell of a
a year in the AFC east. I think. Uh,

164
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:22,570
I'm loving rex Ryan coming back
with the bills and he has a defense.

165
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,041
I think,
uh,

166
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:28,750
all the people that think
that he's learned something
from talking shit are, are,

167
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:33,760
are dopes. Uh, Rex Ryan
has not learned anything.

168
00:10:33,761 --> 00:10:36,460
Rex Ryan is Rex Ryan.
All right.

169
00:10:36,461 --> 00:10:40,810
And he's always going to be rex
Ryan and less he loses his defense.

170
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:46,360
Then he slumped his shoulders and tries
to act like he's a class act. He isn't,

171
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:49,420
I'm not saying he doesn't have class,
but he's not a quiet guy.

172
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:54,040
He said guy fucking talking with his
mouth full with spaghetti sauce on the

173
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:56,260
front of his shirt. That's just
two years. And you know what?

174
00:10:56,261 --> 00:10:59,950
You need that fucking guy. You don't
want to look at him when he's eating.

175
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,880
But other than that, he's a
fun guy to have around. So I'm,

176
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,620
I'm predicting right now without
even looking at the schedule,

177
00:11:05,621 --> 00:11:07,360
without even knowing a fucking thing,

178
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:11,860
I'm going to say that we split
with the bills and when the bills,

179
00:11:11,861 --> 00:11:15,910
when probably when the first
one or whatever I am go,

180
00:11:15,911 --> 00:11:20,350
I predict that a rex Ryan is going
to talk, not all kinds of shit.

181
00:11:20,351 --> 00:11:25,090
He will make some sort of comment and
you will see that manic look on his face.

182
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:29,740
Um, it'll probably, I don't know,
I'll probably say something dumb

183
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:34,640
about one and this one of the Superbowl
or some stupid shit like that. And uh,

184
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:35,743
and as always,

185
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:40,820
Bill Belicheck will be looked at as
a dud as a guy who's a, you know,

186
00:11:40,821 --> 00:11:43,070
socially inept and all that type of shit.

187
00:11:43,071 --> 00:11:47,090
I love when people buy into the fucking
press wine in about that, you know,

188
00:11:47,091 --> 00:11:48,860
fucking Bella check is a hot shit.

189
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:52,400
He's just smart enough not to talk
to those fucking cons in the press.

190
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:54,050
He knows that.
He says they're

191
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:58,340
going to twist around and it's just
going to be used as, as a, you know,

192
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:01,790
what do they call it?
Fucking bullet of board material.

193
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:05,690
Bill Bellacheck said this about you
guys, who does, who respect you.

194
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,820
That's why every fucking
week I don't give a shit.

195
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:13,040
If he was going to play a bunch of standup
Comedians, full pads, he still be like,

196
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:18,080
well, you know, any given Sunday anybody
can win. And uh, you know, you know,

197
00:12:18,081 --> 00:12:21,200
the second day leave you fucking breaks
out a Stogie and a scotch, right?

198
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:24,210
Start just telling stories.
Um,

199
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:31,490
I'm just saying, all right, just
because somebody wrote it a set,

200
00:12:31,491 --> 00:12:34,220
it doesn't mean it's true.
Do you know some asshole in Twitter?

201
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,670
I don't know if he's being an asshole.
He sent me a thing saying, hey bill,

202
00:12:37,671 --> 00:12:40,760
you should go back to drinking
because according to this study,

203
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,413
uh,

204
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:43,441
you know,

205
00:12:43,441 --> 00:12:48,360
taking time off from drinking does not
cleanse your liver and actually might be

206
00:12:48,361 --> 00:12:53,130
detrimental to your health.
So I click on it, Click Bait.

207
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:57,360
Fuck it. I can't resist. I'm weak
mentally. I click on the shit, right?

208
00:12:58,410 --> 00:12:59,040
We,
uh,

209
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,300
I go to it and I read and it's just some
woman talking to one doctor who just

210
00:13:03,301 --> 00:13:07,490
says a bunch of vague shit
about like, if, you know,

211
00:13:07,491 --> 00:13:09,110
if you normally drink or whatever,

212
00:13:09,111 --> 00:13:12,110
if you would just to stop cold Turkey that
yet, blah, blah, blah, blah, Blah blue.

213
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:16,940
It was, so I just wrote back yet one
dope talks to one doctor, get the facts,

214
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,380
the whole article,
just,

215
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:24,670
it just reeked of being a study
funded by somebody who sells alcohol.

216
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,640
And he could see how when they
use the quotes from the doctor,

217
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:33,140
it was always like dot, dot, dot.
Something that guy said. Dot, dot, dot.

218
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:36,590
So they just take a little fucking clip
of it. He was probably doing that thing,

219
00:13:36,591 --> 00:13:40,010
you know, where they say like, one glass
of wine every day is actually healthy.

220
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:43,940
And, uh, then they just, you
know, a cross examine, well,

221
00:13:43,941 --> 00:13:48,941
let's say somebody was to stop drinking
that glass of wine and was to eat

222
00:13:50,451 --> 00:13:55,100
McDonald's every day. Then would
that be a good, healthy thing?

223
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:58,200
And then the doctor's like, yeah,
well, you get all of that instance.

224
00:13:58,201 --> 00:14:00,330
I imagine that, uh, you know,

225
00:14:00,331 --> 00:14:04,850
if you were eating a hive
transfats food add, uh,

226
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,980
you did not have that
glass of wine that will,

227
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:09,420
I mean you would probably
be better off with the, uh,

228
00:14:09,421 --> 00:14:11,640
your arteries being clogged
up by the Trans fats.

229
00:14:11,641 --> 00:14:15,630
You probably want a little bit alcohol and
come in there, right. Uh, clean it out.

230
00:14:15,631 --> 00:14:16,970
So at that point, yeah. Yes.

231
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:20,340
I would venture a guess that
that would be detrimental.

232
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:23,430
And then they take all of that shit and
then they just say, taking one glance,

233
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:27,320
you know, knocking off booze could be
detrimental. Give me a fucking break.

234
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:31,340
I know I don't need a goddamn
study to tell me that.

235
00:14:31,341 --> 00:14:34,250
Taking a fucking 70 days
off from drinking is,

236
00:14:34,251 --> 00:14:38,120
is is good or bad for my liver.

237
00:14:38,121 --> 00:14:39,290
I see the results.

238
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:44,990
I did a Gig with Versie
like in the beginning of May
and he came walking in his

239
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:47,500
skin look amazing space.

240
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,670
It came at oh first he was glowing.
He goes, do it. Been crushing it.

241
00:14:51,671 --> 00:14:54,130
I haven't been, I haven't drank
in five days. I'm like, dude,

242
00:14:54,131 --> 00:14:56,740
I can see it in your face.
Your face is already thinner and it look,

243
00:14:56,741 --> 00:15:01,450
your skin looks clear.
I've got to look at some fucking study.

244
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:02,531
Now look,

245
00:15:02,531 --> 00:15:05,920
I'm not saying that you can drink like a
fucking animal like I did and then take

246
00:15:05,921 --> 00:15:09,610
75 days off or whatever,
and then you have a brand new liver.

247
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:13,030
I'm not a fucking dope.
I know that.

248
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:16,420
It's like I'd beat the shit out of
a car. All right? But you know what?

249
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:18,940
I didn't beat the shit
out of it and 75 days.

250
00:15:18,941 --> 00:15:23,941
So rather than the fucking car
being 75 more days beat on it,

251
00:15:25,511 --> 00:15:28,960
stopped at whatever fucking number
I beat on it. You know I get it.

252
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,250
Look, oh, you guys are, do
you know some of you guys?

253
00:15:33,251 --> 00:15:36,010
What you're doing to me is the same
thing that they do to the Patriots.

254
00:15:36,011 --> 00:15:41,011
You see me get into towards the
fucking brass ring of 162 pounds.

255
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:44,170
So now you starting to hate on me.
I get it.

256
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:48,810
You see me becoming a champion
right before your very ears on this

257
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:53,840
podcast. Actually, I got to tell you
this, I'm taking a loss this week.

258
00:15:53,841 --> 00:15:58,540
I'm already calling it on
Thursday. There's no way I'm
getting down to one 62. Um,

259
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:01,640
I got busy this week and then also
I was just feeling it. My bones,

260
00:16:01,641 --> 00:16:06,350
like I took a day off, then I go take
another day off, give you body arrest. Uh,

261
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:10,670
just try to eat as well as you can, which
I did. And then today I went to the gym.

262
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:12,783
Yeah.

263
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:15,630
Went down there and I trued
to fucking weights around,

264
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:20,160
did 45 minutes of cardio and I'm right
back on it, right back on it again.

265
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,570
Um,
so

266
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:22,340
okay.

267
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:25,970
Weighed my cell was like a buck 66
and change after the fucking workout.

268
00:16:25,971 --> 00:16:30,860
So I think by Sunday I may be,
I can be like one 65, one 64,

269
00:16:30,861 --> 00:16:34,310
so whatever, it's, what am I do
quick? Am I going to start crying,

270
00:16:34,311 --> 00:16:38,840
like fucking gym or say and have rules
change. That one 64 now means one 62.

271
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,780
Now. I'm not, I'm a, I'm just now,

272
00:16:41,781 --> 00:16:44,750
my goal is to get down to one
64 and then the week after

273
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:49,670
down to one 62 and then I did
it, you know, and then that's it.

274
00:16:49,671 --> 00:16:53,360
I'll buy myself a little fucking
a championship ring instead of a,

275
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:57,410
a fucking smoking a cigar.
I'm going to have one of those cakes,

276
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,470
those lollipop cakes.

277
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:03,850
I didn't know what
those things are called,

278
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:07,870
but those things are the funniest God
damn thing ever to me. Cake on a stick.

279
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,101
You know what I mean?

280
00:17:09,101 --> 00:17:11,680
Like that's one of those things
where you're just a fat fuck.

281
00:17:11,681 --> 00:17:14,590
If you eat cake on a stick, you're a fat.
Fuck it. I don't want to hear like, Oh,

282
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:17,920
a lot smaller than it out that
will fucking slice of cake.

283
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,740
Who the fuck has a slice of cake
other than on their birthday?

284
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,450
You know what I mean?

285
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:26,530
Now you just add in fucking cake on a
stick cause you'd think it's smaller.

286
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,460
There's certain things that uh,
you know, I just don't have any,

287
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:34,330
I have zero tolerance for
cake on a stick donuts.

288
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:36,283
MMM.

289
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:42,470
Any of that shit that stuffed
with marshmallow was sugar
and it's like the color

290
00:17:42,471 --> 00:17:46,970
of like those snowballs.
Does anybody eat those anymore?

291
00:17:46,971 --> 00:17:49,870
I don't know who the fuck he those things.
But anyhow,

292
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:52,930
when you're just sitting there with a
sugary lump a shit, like I don't have any,

293
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:54,670
I don't have any sympathy for you.
What are you doing?

294
00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:00,300
Um, so anyways, uh, oh,

295
00:18:00,301 --> 00:18:01,560
what the fuck was I going to talk about

296
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:07,580
Becky? Brain up. Bill, where are you
talking about cake on a staff. It's gone.

297
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:11,750
It just like that. It's gone and there's
nothing we can do about it. Um, oh,

298
00:18:11,751 --> 00:18:15,190
and also as far as my diet being
fucked, I'm going to try that. Uh,

299
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:16,920
yeah,

300
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:21,250
I'm going to try it. That, uh, that Sunday
gravy recipe. Then I was watching, uh,

301
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:25,380
like a bunch of fucking Italians making
the whole God damn it was just awesome.

302
00:18:25,381 --> 00:18:28,290
So I'll let you guys know how that goes.

303
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:33,260
And I'm also fucking with my garage here.
Uh,

304
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:34,530
let me, let me read the, uh,

305
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,520
okay.

306
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:40,580
Let me read the advertising here. Jesus
Christ, the whole momentum of this podcast

307
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,480
fucking went down.

308
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,890
Here we go. Away we go. You know, it's
funny, I had no idea that that the,

309
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:49,330
the decision even got
reversed about Tom Brady. I,

310
00:18:49,331 --> 00:18:52,490
I thought it was going to happen on
Friday so I wasn't even paying attention.

311
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:56,030
And then I got a bunch of text messages.
Congratulations.

312
00:18:56,031 --> 00:18:58,610
I'm like about what people like what
do you live under? A fucking rock.

313
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:03,260
It's like not items. Just tell them,
put on the TV today. Sorry. All right.

314
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:07,070
Two attachments to reads everybody.
Can you deal with two reads?

315
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,083
MMM.

316
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,370
All right. There we go. What is
it doing here? What are you doing?

317
00:19:13,371 --> 00:19:18,040
What are you doing? Come on. Sorry guys.

318
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:22,690
I usually have this ready.
You know,

319
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:25,970
I don't you fucking hate when somebody
just doesn't attach the fucking thing.

320
00:19:25,971 --> 00:19:30,040
Why do I have to fucking downloading it?
Well,

321
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:33,450
I think they'll do something like a,
Hey, what time do I need to be there?

322
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:38,580
I have all the information in the attached
document and you've got to download

323
00:19:38,581 --> 00:19:40,320
it for it to be,
say like seven 30

324
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:42,803
what is this

325
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,980
production node script for Ad Week of?

326
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,440
I can't read this shit.

327
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,420
Okay.

328
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,850
There's like riding on top of writing here

329
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:02,120
and for some reason they give me
their graphic to fucking download. I,

330
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:04,820
this is all going off the road that's
going off the fucking rails here.

331
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:13,030
All right. I'm going to try to read this,
but there's like words behind the words.

332
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:13,883
All right.

333
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,380
Okay.

334
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,610
I don't know what this is for.

335
00:20:16,611 --> 00:20:20,450
I think it says Oxyo Reid,

336
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:24,820
R D. I don't even know what it says. This.
This shit in front of this yellow shit.

337
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,670
All right. It's okay. You can admit it.

338
00:20:28,671 --> 00:20:32,720
The last thing anyone wants to do his
work after work is waiting in line at the

339
00:20:32,721 --> 00:20:35,960
grocery store. Oh, this is blue apron.

340
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:37,450
Yeah.

341
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:40,870
Schlep home and cook a
complicated meal and expensive,

342
00:20:40,871 --> 00:20:44,290
unhealthy takeout is hardly better.
That's where the new service,

343
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:45,520
blue apron comes in.

344
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:50,210
Blue Apron delivers farm fresh ingredients
and step by step recipes to your home,

345
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,710
allowing you to create healthy,

346
00:20:51,711 --> 00:20:54,530
handcrafted meals at home without
going to the grocery store.

347
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,660
This is way better than those.
Those,

348
00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:00,710
you know those fucking guys who drive
around in the cars with food and the back

349
00:21:00,711 --> 00:21:02,680
seat. It's like, when
the hell was that cooked?

350
00:21:02,681 --> 00:21:04,260
I've got a buddy of mine
that orders that shit. Yeah.

351
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,593
Yeah.

352
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:10,030
Guy Just you orders like a salmon dinner
and it shows up two minutes later.

353
00:21:10,031 --> 00:21:11,770
It's like who cooked that and when?

354
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:15,640
How long has it been riding around and
somebody fucking car. I like blue apron.

355
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:17,110
They like sending you the ingredients.

356
00:21:17,111 --> 00:21:19,090
This is just like something went
to the grocery store for you.

357
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:23,680
It's like you got a broad, your life
would, you don't have to pay up. Well,

358
00:21:23,681 --> 00:21:26,890
I mean you do, but it's way
cheaper for less than $10 per meal.

359
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:30,400
Blue Apron sends you fresh ingredients,
perfectly proportioned, making,

360
00:21:30,401 --> 00:21:33,910
cooking healthy meals, really
easy and fun. Oh Great.

361
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:37,480
No trips to the grocery store and
no waste from unused ingredients.

362
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:41,500
Plus you'll learn to cook with specialty
ingredients that are normally hard to

363
00:21:41,501 --> 00:21:42,334
find.

364
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:47,160
Blue Apron is perfect for date night
cooking with friends and they even offer

365
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:49,180
friendly family fam plants,

366
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:54,280
friendly plants with kid
friendly ingredients so the
whole family can eat well

367
00:21:54,281 --> 00:21:57,310
and have fun preparing the meals together.
God,

368
00:21:57,311 --> 00:21:59,620
there's so much coffee
and I'm so fucking stupid.

369
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:04,420
Each balance meal is 500 to 700
calories per serving and it's so tasty.

370
00:22:04,421 --> 00:22:06,700
You'd never know.
Cooking takes half an hour,

371
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,220
so does reading this copy you dumb as me.

372
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:12,220
Shipping is flexible and free
and the menus are always new.

373
00:22:12,221 --> 00:22:14,140
They won't send the same meal twice.

374
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,730
Okay,

375
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:18,460
get the fuck Outta here.
If I order it every day for a year,

376
00:22:18,461 --> 00:22:20,950
I'm not gonna get the same. What am I
eating? A squirrel by the end of the year,

377
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:24,610
they work around your schedule and
dietary preferences in Blue Apron.

378
00:22:24,611 --> 00:22:28,450
Experts source only the best seasonal
ingredients for incredible meals like

379
00:22:28,451 --> 00:22:33,240
Asian style pork burgers with
crunchy slaw. God Damn it.

380
00:22:33,241 --> 00:22:34,470
That sounds good.
And flat.

381
00:22:34,471 --> 00:22:39,060
Iron steaks with Romesco
sauce and roasted potatoes.

382
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,840
You'll cook incredible meals and be
blown away by the quality and freshness.

383
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:47,740
This is fucking unbelievable, man.

00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:51,910

386
00:22:56,801 --> 00:23:01,801
When you go to blue apron.com/burr
blue apron.com/burr.

387
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:05,100
All right.
And I was told I had two copies.

388
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:06,730
Okay.

389
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:09,760
I only got one. That's all I got. I
don't know what the fuck to tell you.

390
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,440
Okay.

391
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,370
Where the hell's my fucking phone? I
was told that I had, did I shut it off?

392
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:21,270
Good. Gives a shit. All right.
Anyway, so let's plow ahead here. Um,

393
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:23,740
so I'm,
I'm

394
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:24,940
okay.

395
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:28,630
Finally like turning my attention
to my fucking piece of shit.

396
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:31,990
Goddamn cock sucking
motherfucking cunt of a garage.

397
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,330
I have the worst fucking garage.

398
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,590
I have a worst garage than somebody who
has no garage. That's how bad my garages.

399
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:40,330
Okay.

400
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:43,780
As I told you guys before,
the property line down my driveway,

401
00:23:43,781 --> 00:23:46,760
like angles in at like a 30 degree angle.

402
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:50,780
My garage was built by two
different fucking people,

403
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:56,350
at least one person who added to the
front of it and built out the right side.

404
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:01,100
And on the left side when they went to
line up the right side with the left side,

405
00:24:01,101 --> 00:24:02,660
whether we're going to
put the garage doors,

406
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,870
looked straight at Clorox and
realized that there was a tree there.

407
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:09,830
So rather than removing the tree
or backing up their fucking wall,

408
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:14,030
they just fucking said fuck it
and put the wall behind the tree.

409
00:24:14,031 --> 00:24:16,910
So my garage doors are at
like a 15 degree angle,

410
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:20,090
which is an optical illusion as
I'm trying to back this trucking,

411
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:23,630
the doors have faced this way, the
garage, his face the other way.

412
00:24:23,631 --> 00:24:27,650
And I got a wall that's closing
in 30 degrees on the right.

413
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,050
Okay.

414
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:31,450
Which is now my left
as I fucking look over.

415
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:35,980
It's a fucking disaster is what
I'm trying to say. So anyways,

416
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:41,420
I'm sitting there and I'm
trying to, uh, you know,

417
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:45,320
I'm into this grip strength workout.
So I have, I have a pull up,

418
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:46,440
okay.

419
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:51,240
A pull up bar, Chin up bar, dip
station, and it takes up a lot of space.

420
00:24:51,241 --> 00:24:53,040
So I'm going to put that on craigslist.

421
00:24:53,041 --> 00:24:55,770
I'm going to sell that thing and
I'm gonna get this pull up bar.

422
00:24:55,771 --> 00:24:57,240
And just mounted to the wall.

423
00:24:57,770 --> 00:24:58,120
Yeah.

424
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,010
All right.
Then my wife wanted a speed bag,

425
00:25:00,011 --> 00:25:01,360
so I knew where I was going to put that.

426
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,050
I had two cabinets that were on the floor.
Those were going up on the walls.

427
00:25:05,051 --> 00:25:06,220
And then I have two bikes,

428
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:09,430
one for me and the one that I
bought my wife that she never uses.

429
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:12,360
And I'm putting those on the
wall. All right. And then I,

430
00:25:12,361 --> 00:25:13,870
I wanted to get a peg board.

431
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:14,760
Yeah.

432
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,290
All right.
So I get the peg board.

433
00:25:16,291 --> 00:25:19,620
The only place I can mount it is at the
front of the garage where that guy put

434
00:25:19,621 --> 00:25:23,670
that fucking Janky extension onto it
because there's enough head room for my

435
00:25:23,671 --> 00:25:27,450
giant head if and when I'm ever strong
enough to get up to the top of it.

436
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:32,850
So the fucking pegboard is 36 by
36 I go down there to measure it.

437
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:35,100
Right. And wouldn't, you know,

438
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:38,640
35 fucking motherfucking cunt inches in.

439
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:43,560
Is this galvanize fucking useless as pipe.
So I'm like,

440
00:25:43,561 --> 00:25:47,460
you fucking motherfucker.
So I call up

441
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,400
to come over.

442
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:52,340
Yeah.

443
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:55,280
[inaudible] fucking just hack it up
to shut off the water, hack it off,

444
00:25:55,281 --> 00:25:59,630
and then cap it right inside the wall.
And he comes in and immediately he's like,

445
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:03,650
oh, that's galvanized pipe.
That's original to the house.

446
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:08,120
And back in the day, they used to just
thread those things right on the spot.

447
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:12,020
So the only way for me to take that
thing out was I'd have to go all the way

448
00:26:12,021 --> 00:26:13,340
into the walls in your house,

449
00:26:13,341 --> 00:26:18,170
in the ceiling all the way downstairs
that you just re did. I'm like,

450
00:26:18,171 --> 00:26:20,760
you gotta be fucking kidding me. You just
can't cut it off there. He's like, no,

451
00:26:20,761 --> 00:26:24,110
I can't. I can't do that. I should
ask him if he could rethread it.

452
00:26:24,111 --> 00:26:24,980
They're the old school way,

453
00:26:24,981 --> 00:26:26,690
but I know they probably don't
make one of those anymore.

454
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:33,050
So he caps the fucking thing off
with this nipple sticking out,

455
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:38,180
which would then make the peg board
have to be off the wall just far enough

456
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:41,000
where if I went to open the garage door,
that swings in,

457
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:43,900
it would hit the fucking thing and
then I couldn't get my truck in.

458
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:46,783
So

459
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,340
I'm done fighting the garage.

460
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:53,630
I'm now going to try to find a peg board
that isn't 36 by 36 maybe they make one

461
00:26:53,631 --> 00:26:58,100
that's just 24 did they make one that's
just 24 and I don't want those long

462
00:26:58,101 --> 00:27:01,550
skinny ones because those things don't
fucking work because you need like a 200

463
00:27:01,551 --> 00:27:06,290
foot fucking roof, whatever. I'll
look it up later. So anyways, um,

464
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:09,590
I have decided that I'm going
to stop fighting my garage.

465
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:14,390
I'm going to get a peg board that fits
there and even if I have to cut it in

466
00:27:14,391 --> 00:27:16,220
half and fucking customized the thing,

467
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:21,250
it's what I'm going to do because I really
am fascinated with that grip strength

468
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:23,900
workouts.
And I like,

469
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:25,510
yeah,

470
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:29,230
I just like building up muscle like that.
It seems way more,

471
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:32,510
I dunno appliable to my life,

472
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:33,610
okay.

473
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,030
That I can fucking lift my,

474
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:40,060
my own body up to me is better
than trying to bench 200 pounds.

475
00:27:40,201 --> 00:27:43,200
Like I like to try to do back in the day,
which I guess is great.

476
00:27:43,201 --> 00:27:47,730
If a fucking rock fell on me, I could
get the goddamn thing off me or I guess,

477
00:27:47,731 --> 00:27:50,460
but I think mostly, you know, like what,

478
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:54,780
say I ever got kidnapped by
that guy in silence of the lamb,

479
00:27:54,781 --> 00:27:57,990
then he threw me down that fucking hole.
You know what I mean?

480
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:04,160
I would have enough fucking strength
that I could go horizontal, right.

481
00:28:04,161 --> 00:28:07,070
And just walk my way right
out of that fucking thing.

482
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:08,900
Or at least to the top of the whole thing.
I mean,

483
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:12,890
he's got all the weapons and shit,
but uh, you know, that'd be funny.

484
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:16,100
You get up to top of the hole and you're
fucking gassed and he's just standing

485
00:28:16,101 --> 00:28:20,270
there like, why is he such
running at you with a fucking ex?

486
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:24,710
Um, so anyway, so that
got me, you know, I was,

487
00:28:24,711 --> 00:28:29,240
I was looking at pegboards on Youtube,
which then got me into, uh, you know,

488
00:28:29,241 --> 00:28:32,240
those rock climbing gym. So
with all those, you know,

489
00:28:32,241 --> 00:28:33,920
those cool holds in that type of stuff.

490
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:37,250
And I watched this one
woman in this German stunt,

491
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:41,120
a stunt man class,
just like,

492
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:45,770
she literally had like chimpanzee
strength. She was just flying,

493
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:49,730
which one of most amazing fucking
things I've ever seen. So anyways,

494
00:28:49,731 --> 00:28:51,230
I ended up going to this,
uh,

495
00:28:51,231 --> 00:28:56,231
this website called atomic
holds a t o m I k atomic holds.

496
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,290
And uh,

497
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:04,820
I'd love to reach out to these guys to
see if they'd advertise slash send me

498
00:29:04,821 --> 00:29:09,590
some free fucking shit
is I redo my garage. Um,

499
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:12,590
and all I want to do is why
don't I saw this guy had,

500
00:29:12,591 --> 00:29:17,540
was he just had a couple of two by fours
in the top of is a ceiling and then he

501
00:29:17,541 --> 00:29:22,010
just had like some chains and then like
one of those c clamps that you could

502
00:29:22,011 --> 00:29:25,640
just put all these different holds on.
They have like small bombs,

503
00:29:25,641 --> 00:29:28,820
atomic bomb missile pipe bombs,
um,

504
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,610
and you just do like
pull ups on these things.

505
00:29:31,611 --> 00:29:33,740
And then if you get a number of
them and he got a long board,

506
00:29:33,741 --> 00:29:36,740
you can just put a run of
them together and, and,

507
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:40,550
and just sort of climb from one to the
other. It just seems fucking cool as shit.

508
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:44,210
It's a way better way to work your core
without having to get on the ground and

509
00:29:44,211 --> 00:29:48,200
do those old school fucking ups.
So I think I'm going to do a,

510
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:49,530
okay,

511
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:52,800
I'm going to turn my garage.
I'm done fighting the fucking thing.

512
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,630
I'm done fighting it.
I'm just going to,

513
00:29:54,631 --> 00:29:58,020
I'm going to work with the measurements
that I have and I'm going to put some,

514
00:29:58,021 --> 00:30:02,280
uh, some of those climate holds up
there and some of those, uh, missiles,

515
00:30:02,281 --> 00:30:04,290
pipe bombs of what they called it,
just different grips.

516
00:30:04,291 --> 00:30:07,400
I'm going to have those hanging
from the fucking ceiling and a,

517
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:11,730
I'll have my pull up bar,
my wife will have the speed bag and uh,

518
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:14,800
that's good. And I'm going
to get, uh, I flat, uh,

519
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:19,320
found this great flooring from rubber
flooring inc I made like a grocery list.

520
00:30:19,321 --> 00:30:20,730
I haven't ordered any of this shit yet,

521
00:30:20,731 --> 00:30:25,500
but rubber flooring inc seem to have
like the best gym flooring that I could

522
00:30:25,501 --> 00:30:29,130
find. And uh, and once again, I don't
know how I'm gonna I'm gonna have to

523
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,480
okay.

524
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,570
Cut that shit special when
it goes through Sunday.

525
00:30:33,571 --> 00:30:35,580
I really should just take
a picture of my garage.

526
00:30:35,581 --> 00:30:37,800
I'd just get weirded out showing
people the inside of my house,

527
00:30:37,801 --> 00:30:41,870
even if he is the garage, if
he just fucking see the, uh,

528
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,220
uh, it's actually embarrassing. I mean,

529
00:30:44,221 --> 00:30:47,350
part of me just wants to have it torn
down and rebuilt, but I know some,

530
00:30:47,351 --> 00:30:50,880
it'd be like, yeah, I can
do that for about 160 grand.

531
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:56,450
Can you meet me in the middle?
Um,

532
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:59,660
but even then, even if they
were to rebuild it, oh, I'm,

533
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:03,750
I'm still dealing with the property line.
I'm still really limited with space. So,

534
00:31:03,751 --> 00:31:06,330
uh, I think I'm just gonna
I'm just gonna fucking

535
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:07,900
okay.

536
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,640
I'm just going to work
with what the fuck I have.

537
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:13,090
I've done fight in the house the same
way we would done fight in the house when

538
00:31:13,091 --> 00:31:15,700
it came to our stairs.
Uh,

539
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:20,050
let go from the upstairs to the downstairs
at my house was originally a ranch

540
00:31:20,051 --> 00:31:22,720
and then they built the downstairs and
they blew out a closet and that's what

541
00:31:22,721 --> 00:31:25,620
they sent this to the staircase through.
So the,

542
00:31:25,621 --> 00:31:30,160
the opening is just a closet door opening.
So you can't get a couch down there.

543
00:31:30,161 --> 00:31:32,170
You've got to bring it to the
outside of the fucking house.

544
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:36,700
It's just a big fucking pain in the
God damn ass is all I can tell you.

545
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:38,590
I've got to bring it
through my fucked up garage.

546
00:31:38,591 --> 00:31:40,870
I got to literally care the
couch down the driveway,

547
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:44,350
through the garage into the backyard
and then up the stairs and just,

548
00:31:44,351 --> 00:31:48,550
it's a fucking, it's
ridiculous. So anyways, um,

549
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:51,280
but I'm slowly but surely
fixing all of this shit,

550
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:55,480
but we just gave up on the stairs one
day. We just, we just like, you know what,

551
00:31:55,481 --> 00:31:58,540
let's just stop fighting the stairs.
The stairs are the stairs. Fuck it.

552
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:02,410
So I think I might do that with the,
uh, the garage, you know what I mean?

553
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,740
The garage is the garage.
Fuck it.

554
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:08,920
And if I can hang a bunch of shit up
there and then not have to go to the gym

555
00:32:08,921 --> 00:32:13,900
cause I got my own fucking gym and um,
you know,

556
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:17,950
and maybe just get one of those flat
benches and I think that's all I need.

557
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,150
Rubber flooring and then all the,

558
00:32:19,151 --> 00:32:22,450
all the shit that I'm going to work out
with is going to be up off of the floor.

559
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:27,700
So in one corner I can have
all the original parts to
my truck that I had taken

560
00:32:27,701 --> 00:32:31,060
off and then I'm just going to have the
gym. Uh, that's, that is my game plan.

561
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:34,840
That is my dream fucking
home gym there. So, uh,

562
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:37,060
but if you're thinking of doing
some shit like that, and you know,

563
00:32:37,061 --> 00:32:39,040
if you're into American Ninja Warrior,

564
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,840
I am not like you're
going to compete in it,

565
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:44,200
but you just fascinated with how fucking
strong the men and women are on that

566
00:32:44,201 --> 00:32:48,400
thing. Uh, atomic holds
is a great website,

567
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:53,250
um, to go check out.
And the guys, you know,

568
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:54,760
go on Youtube too,

569
00:32:54,761 --> 00:32:58,900
if you just atomic holds and just look
at videos and this guys reviewing all the

570
00:32:58,901 --> 00:33:00,550
different holds and that type of shit.

571
00:33:00,551 --> 00:33:03,700
And they also kind of tell
you which ones are easy,

572
00:33:03,701 --> 00:33:06,040
which ones are more difficult.
You get to see what they look like,

573
00:33:06,041 --> 00:33:09,610
you learn the names of them, and then
just make a little grocery list, add a,

574
00:33:09,611 --> 00:33:10,331
that's what I'm going to do.

575
00:33:10,331 --> 00:33:13,900
I'm going to try and put
this fucking thing together,

576
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,633
you know,

577
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:21,290
I dunno what the fuck I'm talking about.
And then he come absolutely shred. Um,

578
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:26,100
for one last time as I'm sliding into 50,
I'm gonna be one of those guys.

579
00:33:26,101 --> 00:33:29,130
Like I'm going to start dressing like
Jack Lalaine if I actually get in shape,

580
00:33:29,131 --> 00:33:32,550
you know that onesy Fonzie
fucking mechanic zip up.

581
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:37,160
Um, so anyways, if anybody's
done anything like that, uh,

582
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:38,580
got any of those atomic holds,

583
00:33:38,581 --> 00:33:42,330
those things and can recommend
stuff for a beginner. Uh,

584
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:45,690
I just think that the, I think they're
fucking awesome and I've always,

585
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,011
I don't know why,

586
00:33:47,011 --> 00:33:51,030
but that level of strength I've always
respected the most people can climb up a

587
00:33:51,031 --> 00:33:53,970
fucking rope, the fucking pegboard and
all that shit. I think it's awesome.

588
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:57,170
So anyways, I hope that wasn't
too fucking boring for you.

589
00:33:57,171 --> 00:34:01,950
I'll let you guys know how the
Sunday gravy goes on Monday and uh,

590
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:04,160
whatever. I think it's going to be
a great football season. I'm happy

591
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:04,961
ladies back.

592
00:34:04,961 --> 00:34:07,540
I know that the lawsuit's going to
continue and all that type of shit and

593
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:12,520
Goodell's gonna, you know, appeal. It is
a lot of fucking big ego's going on here.

594
00:34:12,521 --> 00:34:16,480
Who? Who's kidding who, but, um,
I'm glad it's over and colts fans.

595
00:34:16,481 --> 00:34:19,120
I want you to know I'm
not shitting on you. Okay?

596
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:21,760
I'm not shitting on you guys and
I'm not shitting on your players.

597
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:25,060
I'm just shitting on Jim
or say, okay. And, uh,

598
00:34:25,061 --> 00:34:27,430
I don't think that we're
any better than that guy is.

599
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:30,490
I'm just sick of the fucking accusations.

600
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:34,690
Only going one way.
You know what I mean?

601
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:41,260
We've only came at you one time for
pumping crowd noise in. That was it.

602
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:45,550
We didn't say shit about all the other
stuff that I've said 9,000 times on it.

603
00:34:45,551 --> 00:34:47,860
So having said all that,
um,

604
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:50,020
I don't think the AFC east
is going to be a cake walk.

605
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:53,620
I think the bills are going
to be really fucking good. Um,

606
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:58,120
I think rex Ryan is great when he's got
a great defense and he has a fucking, uh,

607
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:03,640
you know, somebody quarterback, they can
just manage the game he's shown before.

608
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:07,720
You know, he did that with the jets and
they beat us in the playoffs at home.

609
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:11,880
Kicked our fucking asses. So I'm going to
pull a Bella check here, you know, hello.

610
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:16,900
That's take anybody lightly. He'll
the yes, but, um, and finally, oh,

611
00:35:16,901 --> 00:35:20,290
I gotta I gotta give it a
little law shadow to the
Toronto Blue Jays. I'm sorry,

612
00:35:20,291 --> 00:35:24,400
I wouldn't bring in new guys up.
You guys are fucking, uh, you know,

613
00:35:24,401 --> 00:35:28,710
I can't say you're walking
away with the Goddamn, uh,

614
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:33,280
a l lease, but I, yeah, good on you guys.
You know, you have a one in a while. 93,

615
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,910
God knows the fuck and you can't
depend on your maple leafs.

616
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:40,800
Maybe you get a world series out of it.
Um,

617
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:45,660
but I'm looking forward to that type of
shit. All went today. Hail to the victors.

618
00:35:45,661 --> 00:35:49,170
Value in Hail to the
victors. Fuck, get jam.

619
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:53,820
Haba is taken over. Go
Fuck Yourself. Big 10. Um,

620
00:35:53,821 --> 00:35:54,361
having said that,

621
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:57,170
I think it's going to take them at least
two years to turn the thing around, um,

622
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:02,040
substantially. But uh, you know, you
know, they get nervous. You know,

623
00:36:02,041 --> 00:36:06,360
they get nervous in Ohio state down there
in Columbus, you know, they get nervous.

624
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,640
They are, who gives a
fuck? You won it last year.

625
00:36:08,641 --> 00:36:10,710
Have you guys end up
going to the fucking NFL?

626
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:13,530
And even if they don't that
second half wield this year,

627
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,250
it's the hardest fucking thing in
the world is to continue trying to be

628
00:36:17,251 --> 00:36:22,140
successful I think at the college level
coaching because especially college, who?

629
00:36:22,141 --> 00:36:25,360
Jesus Christ, you get a guy for
one year now if he's any good. Um,

630
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,860
but whatever, as always, I don't
know shit about what I'm talking.

631
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:31,170
[inaudible] Bob, thank
you for listening. And uh,

632
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,280
I'm going to go smoke a fucking scoby and
watched this game. Can't fucking wait.

633
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,320
That's it.
Have a great weekend.

634
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:06,510
Oh my God.
That fucking line dancing.

635
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:11,220
Can there be a mass suicide
amongst the line dancers?

636
00:37:11,221 --> 00:37:14,880
Could that just fucking happen in the
middle of one of your fucking corn ball?

637
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:21,330
Stupid ass fucking sell country
music is country music is,

638
00:37:21,331 --> 00:37:24,090
I don't even know what it's for.
It's for like pod people.

639
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:29,790
There's absolutely no soul in it.
What's so it there? Is it all right?

640
00:37:29,791 --> 00:37:30,720
They're angry.

641
00:37:30,721 --> 00:37:35,721
Redneck listening to this punching the
dashboard or your Chevy s 10 all right.

642
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:39,120
There isn't it fucking sucks.
And that line dancing,

643
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:43,920
we sit there with your fucking thumbs
in your book and pockets and you do that

644
00:37:43,921 --> 00:37:46,800
little I'm doing, I'm, I'm actually,
I'm in Dallas, Texas this week.

645
00:37:46,801 --> 00:37:50,070
So let's just go for big error in this
one. We do that then you're fucking,

646
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:54,990
I wish, I wish this was a vodcast,
which I'm not doing by the way.

647
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,370
So stop fucking asking me.

648
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:59,520
The great thing about this thing is
you can listen to it while you're doing

649
00:37:59,521 --> 00:38:03,270
other shit. Right? All right. So anyways,

650
00:38:03,271 --> 00:38:07,040
they do that stupid thing where they
banned their fucking knees and the,

651
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:12,050
and I can't even think of the
fucking music [inaudible] is none.

652
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,920
Other music goes and,

653
00:38:14,921 --> 00:38:17,090
and then they do that little thing
where they just one of their,

654
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:20,190
one of their feet, right? The right
foot. We'll say the right foot.

655
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:25,290
It's just pivoting on the heel and the
toes face forward and then to the side

656
00:38:25,291 --> 00:38:26,710
and then back to the front.
Ah.

657
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:30,150
Then they do that little thing where
they bring their fucking foot up and they

658
00:38:30,151 --> 00:38:33,420
spanked the bottom of their foot.
All of them,

659
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,160
you don't kills me about those people

660
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:41,160
is they actually think that Jesus loves
them. I got news for you. Rednecks.

661
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,990
Jesus is looking the other way.
He's embarrassed.

662
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:48,310
He's combing his fucking hair to his face
when he watches you. People lie. Debts.

663
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:50,123
He has

664
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:53,700
looking like that chicken,
the rent money.

665
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:55,740
He's got a little gold watch.

666
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:12,360
Oh, I don't want, I'm going to talk
about fuck his bike newspaper here.

667
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:17,220
This is at the risk of burning
some potential material.

668
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:22,140
This is stuff that you could look
forward to watching me go off on in the

669
00:39:22,141 --> 00:39:25,620
future. On stage. All
right. Hang on a second.

670
00:39:25,621 --> 00:39:28,090
I got blow my God damn nose
again. Hold on. Hold on.

671
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:29,710
Okay,

672
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:31,390
let's go eat a pastry.

673
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:38,320
Ah,
fuck.

674
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:43,450
Wow. Yeah, we go. You had to
get it out of the mustache.

675
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:51,460
Anyways, so everybody saw what happened.
On a swatch Nigga this week, right?

676
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:56,420
So Time magazine has a uh,

677
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,090
yeah.

678
00:39:58,090 --> 00:40:02,090
Has An article out there
says sex lies arrogance.

679
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:05,360
What makes powerful men act like pigs?

680
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:09,260
Okay,
so

681
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:11,960
I look at who wrote it.

682
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,650
It's written by Old Lady.

683
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,650
How fucking funny is that?

684
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:19,360
Okay.

685
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:23,200
Sex lies. Arrogance. What Po? What
makes powerful men act like pigs?

686
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:28,530
A woman is going to tell the world
why guys act the way they act.

687
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:32,020
Do you realize how fucked up?

688
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:34,300
Yeah.

689
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:39,150
At what point are men get to make a
fucking stand here with this. Okay.

690
00:40:39,151 --> 00:40:43,050
I don't want to come off like a chauvinist
pig here and you just giving away.

691
00:40:43,051 --> 00:40:45,600
Every a guy should have
wrote this article.

692
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:51,420
He could've had so much more fucking
insight. What the fuck does a woman know?

693
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,860
She doesn't know. And the
whole thing, it's just a thick,

694
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:59,920
the whole thing is written.
But in the,

695
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,840
in the,
the female's point of view,

696
00:41:01,841 --> 00:41:05,710
which is the only thing you understand
is being that woman who got cheated on.

697
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:07,700
Yeah.

698
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:12,140
So there's this woman's scorn
vibe under the whole article,

699
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:16,100
but there's no information in here.
I learned nothing. I was really good.

700
00:41:16,101 --> 00:41:20,990
I learned nothing as a guy and she's
fucking wrong on most of her points.

701
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:26,650
One of the great things they like
to say is that a men of power,

702
00:41:26,831 --> 00:41:30,070
the reason why they cheat is
because they feel entitled.

703
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:34,500
They feel they're entitled.
I'm not going to burn the bit,

704
00:41:34,501 --> 00:41:39,501
but that is so that's so not even true
and what kills me is some fucking broad

705
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:44,250
like this. Nancy Gibbs would
sit there and argue with me

706
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:50,750
being a lady, a lady. Do you
understand what you're doing there?

707
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:55,780
You're basically telling me that you
know how my brain works better than I do.

708
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:59,630
I was watching her with the reason why I
bought this fucking article cause I was

709
00:41:59,631 --> 00:42:01,430
sitting,
I was watching it on television.

710
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:06,290
I saw the art and the obviously like
a fucking magnet. I'm drawn to this.

711
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,480
I'm like, Oh, I like this topic.
I want to hear about this.

712
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:13,190
And then Nancy Gibbs comes
on and she's talking to a guy

713
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:18,100
hit. He's going really? Oh is
as long as I was. Okay. Like

714
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:23,490
it's at Chateau. It's just, it's
fucking terrific. That would be like me.

715
00:42:23,491 --> 00:42:28,110
Like here's something for
you. His is like, like women.

716
00:42:28,111 --> 00:42:31,980
You never get to know what it's like
to have a dick. All right, so stop it.

717
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:33,670
Stop trying to write articles.
Try,

718
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:36,510
stop trying to act like you're in our
heads and you know what we're thinking.

719
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:39,510
You don't. You're always going to be
observed. You're going to be an observer.

720
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:42,630
You sitting on the grassy knoll what
to do? Where did the shots come from?

721
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:45,840
You have no fucking idea.
You just coming up with your theories,

722
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:49,770
the nerve of you to get
to cover. If fucking Time
magazine with this horse shit.

723
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:55,560
Just a bunch of horse shit. They got
one over there. Listen to this shit. Uh,

724
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:58,240
the turning points,
this is from another lay.

725
00:42:58,310 --> 00:43:00,690
They had two people write about this shit.
Elaine,

726
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:06,690
I can't even read a fucking last name
as CEO, Lino, whatever Frances having,

727
00:43:06,691 --> 00:43:07,920
it's Anita Hill moment.

728
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:11,970
When the law professor testified before
the Senate committee in 1991 that a

729
00:43:11,971 --> 00:43:15,030
former boss, Clarence Thomas,
had sexually harassed her.

730
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:18,090
He denied everything and was
elevated to the Supreme Court.

731
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:22,830
Notice how the fucking angry cunt leaves
out the fact that he was acquitted,

732
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:24,510
the guy was acquitted.

733
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:30,310
She makes it seem like he was accused of
that stuff and because of that he would

734
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:35,260
because of that attention,
he, he was elevated to the
Supreme Court. But anyways,

735
00:43:35,261 --> 00:43:37,480
hearings were attorney,
but hearings were terming point.

736
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:42,660
Women suddenly said that the mad men
style of behavior they had been putting up

737
00:43:43,421 --> 00:43:47,590
with at work for so long, the
leering, the inappropriate touching,

738
00:43:47,591 --> 00:43:51,160
the sexual banter was not acceptable.
Do you understand that?

739
00:43:51,161 --> 00:43:53,710
She's not talking about the 1960s there.

740
00:43:53,890 --> 00:43:58,570
She's talking about 1991 I'm not
saying that that shit wasn't happening,

741
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:02,470
but you know, I was in the
workforce. They're all right.

742
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,270
People weren't walking around going,
hey,

743
00:44:04,271 --> 00:44:09,271
touch grabbing people's asses at
work in 98919901991 they weren't,

744
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:13,900
I mean,
generally speaking weren't,

745
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:17,620
but this lady just fucking
goes the mad men style,

746
00:44:17,621 --> 00:44:22,360
which is from the 1960s Madison Avenue.
Hey Sweetie,

747
00:44:22,361 --> 00:44:23,920
go make me a fucking sandwich.

748
00:44:23,921 --> 00:44:28,921
That error completely ignoring all
the bullshit that happened in the late

749
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:31,980
sixties seventies right through the
fucking eighties and the 80s they were

750
00:44:31,981 --> 00:44:36,270
talking about women wearing their fucking
little power suits and power ties and

751
00:44:36,271 --> 00:44:37,750
all that fucking horse shit.

752
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:42,660
This is all just one of these classic
things where you just, you just,

753
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:45,440
you have your angle and then you just,
you just write the whole fucking article.

754
00:44:45,441 --> 00:44:49,920
It's complete horse shit. Um, what
the hell is the quote in here?

755
00:44:49,921 --> 00:44:54,570
I wanted to read. I don't
even know. All right,

756
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:58,120
let me tell you something Nancy,
let me tell you something, Elaine.

757
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:03,240
Those guys don't do that shit cause
they feel entitled. They don't.

758
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:06,090
All right,
they don't.

759
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:10,380
And if you want to know why come out to
a comedy club cause I'm not burden the

760
00:45:10,381 --> 00:45:12,510
fucking material.
I'll talk about it a little bit.

761
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,410
I'll talk about real quick.
Alright.

762
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:21,990
What it is is women don't understand
what it's like to have a dick.

763
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:24,840
They just don't get it.
Okay.

764
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:30,440
The fucking thing tells us what to do.
You know now,

765
00:45:30,490 --> 00:45:34,000
right now they're rolling
their eyes because they don't
understand the sex drive

766
00:45:34,001 --> 00:45:38,860
that we have. How could they?
They got a badge. All right,

767
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:41,031
and the thing is,

768
00:45:41,031 --> 00:45:45,430
there's no information out there to
help people to help guys out. Nothing.

769
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:51,020
All guys get, there's no information
about being a guy in general. Hey,

770
00:45:51,021 --> 00:45:55,460
keep it in your pants. That's the sexual
advice we get. That's what we get.

771
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,290
Fucking you got Kosmal.

772
00:45:57,291 --> 00:46:00,140
There's reams of shit talking
about all the folds in your vagina.

773
00:46:00,141 --> 00:46:03,350
Every goddamn month we get,
Hey, keep it in your pants.

774
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:07,370
That's the kind of advice guys get. You
go to jail. Hey, don't drop the soap.

775
00:46:07,970 --> 00:46:09,290
That's it.
That's all you get.

776
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:12,740
We get little fucking four sentences
and that's how we're supposed to fucking

777
00:46:12,741 --> 00:46:16,610
navigate through life.
So you're pulling with a deck,

778
00:46:16,611 --> 00:46:18,620
you've got this ridiculous
fucking sex drive.

779
00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:24,350
The only thing that fucking keeps it in
check is the fact that women won't fuck

780
00:46:24,351 --> 00:46:27,200
you. You got to figure out,
you got to talk them into it.

781
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:28,430
You go through dry spells.

782
00:46:28,610 --> 00:46:33,320
That's the only thing that prevents a
guy from fucking 24 hours a day is other

783
00:46:33,321 --> 00:46:36,470
women making it difficult
for us to get laid.

784
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:41,050
But then what happens is when you
become an a position of power,

785
00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:45,160
these cunts flip the fucking table and
will suck your Dick under your fucking

786
00:46:45,161 --> 00:46:47,890
God damn desk while your
wife's sits across from you.

787
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:50,200
So now the governor has taken off.

788
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:54,880
You've never had to control your sexual
urges because it was always done for you.

789
00:46:54,970 --> 00:46:57,690
You like a spoiled kid.
Now you're fucking famous.

790
00:46:57,691 --> 00:47:00,400
You got all these broads coming at you.
You don't know what to do

791
00:47:02,050 --> 00:47:04,630
because you never really noticed how
much you've been been led around by your

792
00:47:04,631 --> 00:47:08,200
Dick. Now, I'm not saying every
powerful guy out there is an angel.

793
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:11,710
There's not this definitely some pigs
out that there's definitely some guys out

794
00:47:11,711 --> 00:47:12,970
there who do feel entitled.

795
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:16,690
But to just paint it with that broad
fucking stroke of a brush and have a

796
00:47:16,691 --> 00:47:20,240
fucking woman sitting
there telling me it's you.

797
00:47:20,241 --> 00:47:23,200
You don't know what you
talking about, lady. All right,

798
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:30,600
you have to just fucking blows my mind
blows my fucking that they put two people

799
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:33,430
on this assignment and
they were both women.

800
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,820
Was that some political
correct fucking thing?

801
00:47:36,821 --> 00:47:39,700
Cause they were worried that guys we're
going to say what the fuck I'm saying

802
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:44,560
that basically their husbands would be
out fucking everything that moved if

803
00:47:44,561 --> 00:47:47,200
women wanted to fuck
the way we want it to.

804
00:47:49,850 --> 00:47:50,600
I don't know.

805
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:54,680
And not to mention most people can
handle power and that includes broads.

806
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:56,480
Okay,

807
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:00,440
so you get some guy in a powerful position
is ego's already going to go through

808
00:48:00,441 --> 00:48:05,441
the fucking roof and then you combine
that with the fact that basically half of

809
00:48:07,341 --> 00:48:09,470
the free world will now fuck him.

810
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:15,050
Any supposed to somehow rein that in and
is only piece of advice is keep it in

811
00:48:15,051 --> 00:48:18,470
your pants, you know? I mean I dunno

812
00:48:19,970 --> 00:48:23,000
did I, that gets really embarrassing
the Time magazine. What?

813
00:48:23,001 --> 00:48:26,150
This fucking superficial
that they just basically

814
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,370
they too. I mean, it was like psych 101

815
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:35,950
how they broke it down,
even though shit on,

816
00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:38,020
on a Arnold Schwarzenegger about how he,

817
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:42,580
he likes fucking around with girls
that aren't beautiful. You know,

818
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:46,270
they said it was because he was
intimidated by beautiful women and

819
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:48,730
Blahblahblahblahblah see,
they're women. They don't,

820
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:52,570
they don't get the difference between
hooking up with the hottie and hooking up

821
00:48:52,571 --> 00:48:56,230
with the plain Jane girl who's
going to try harder, okay.

822
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,030
As opposed to the fucking chick who's,

823
00:48:58,031 --> 00:49:02,200
who's got 0% body fat and just
thinks she's God's God damn gift.

824
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:06,430
You've seen that, right? You go to a
titty bar, the hottest one there does,

825
00:49:06,431 --> 00:49:10,090
she tries hard is that fucking
one in the middle? She doesn't.

826
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:13,510
And after a while, you know what? You
start looking at those hotties going,

827
00:49:13,511 --> 00:49:18,280
you know what? They're fucking more
trouble than they're worth. All right,

828
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:22,360
I'll wipe my dick sucked to completion.
Who am I going with?

829
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:27,660
The supermodel looking chick? Oh, that
chick who's just happy to be there.

830
00:49:47,490 --> 00:49:49,100
Anyway, so I got it. I got sick.

831
00:49:49,530 --> 00:49:52,910
Yeah. I, it's like, all right,
so I'm thinking, all right,

832
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:57,740
that means I got to get up at fucking
five 30 return the rental car and all that

833
00:49:57,741 --> 00:50:01,580
horse shit. Why don't I stay at a
hotel right next to the airport?

834
00:50:02,570 --> 00:50:06,980
So my travel agent gives
me the whole list of, uh,

835
00:50:06,981 --> 00:50:10,250
of options of where I can stay. So I'm
like, yeah, fine. Fuck it. All right.

836
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:14,690
I check them out. And one of them is
the Sheridan Sheridan, respected name,

837
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:19,700
a very quality hotel. I say,
I'm going to stay there.

838
00:50:19,701 --> 00:50:23,010
And the price reflected that it was a
quality hotel. It costs me like, oh,

839
00:50:23,011 --> 00:50:27,670
you know, 180 bucks or something like
that was a lot of fucking money. So, uh,

840
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:30,970
[inaudible] 99, something like
that, you know, for Philly,

841
00:50:30,971 --> 00:50:35,170
that's a lot of fucking money considering
I was right outside upper Darby.

842
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:39,140
So anyways,
here's my travel tip for you.

843
00:50:39,141 --> 00:50:44,141
Do not ever stay at the fucking Sheridan
at the Philadelphia International

844
00:50:44,570 --> 00:50:48,290
Airport. It is a beyond
ghetto, Sheridan and I,

845
00:50:48,291 --> 00:50:50,180
and it's so fucking ghetto that I,

846
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:54,140
I knew it was a fucked up Sheridan
before I even went into it.

847
00:50:54,170 --> 00:50:57,410
I pulled up and it looked fine. I
got out of my car, it looked fine,

848
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:02,060
and as I walked into the place,
as I was walking in,

849
00:51:02,090 --> 00:51:06,110
these four chicks were coming out and
they just look like horse from a reality

850
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:09,530
show,
awful tattoos on their feet.

851
00:51:09,770 --> 00:51:14,380
Tidies up and pushed together these cheap
ass looking stripper shoes. And I went,

852
00:51:14,381 --> 00:51:19,190
oh no. Oh No, not, not, not, not
a bad hotel. Please God, please.

853
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:22,790
I start praying to the travel
gods, please, please don't
let this be a bad hotel.

854
00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:26,870
You know, I'm like way, but you know,
at first I was like, all right, what,

855
00:51:26,871 --> 00:51:27,940
what are these like call girls?

856
00:51:27,941 --> 00:51:32,210
Did you just get done servicing some
fucking married business guy on the road?

857
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:36,470
Show what they did, but it was like
12 noon. It's like, no, no, no.

858
00:51:36,471 --> 00:51:41,450
Call Girls are up at 12 noon. All right.
They already wiped fucking washed off.

859
00:51:41,451 --> 00:51:44,600
The vaginas hosed him down
at like eight in the morning.

860
00:51:45,290 --> 00:51:49,070
And now they just fell asleep face down
in a fucking pile of glitter and they're

861
00:51:49,071 --> 00:51:51,890
not going to wake up against it like five
in the afternoon. That's how it works.

862
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,820
And they wake up, they fucking, you
know, I dunno what they do. You know,

863
00:51:57,821 --> 00:51:59,590
they put some fucking vitamin E on the,

864
00:51:59,591 --> 00:52:03,370
on the ligature marks around
the neck from the night before.

865
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:11,770
Do you know,
you know what's fucked up about ligature?

866
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:17,020
Nobody ever uses that statement unless
somebody's got choked to death, you know,

867
00:52:17,110 --> 00:52:20,200
ligature, my, no, it does never any
ligature marks because you know why?

868
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:23,380
Because these girls who
are into that type of shit,

869
00:52:23,381 --> 00:52:28,150
if they survive the encounter, they
fucking, they were that little, uh,

870
00:52:28,151 --> 00:52:31,600
that little ass got the next day around
that neck. You know, the hoary one,

871
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:34,420
a choker.
That's what they were to cover it up.

872
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:38,620
You have to have a girl wants
you to do that once you a choker.

873
00:52:39,210 --> 00:52:42,080
I remember one time I was with
this girl, right? And she, uh,

874
00:52:42,090 --> 00:52:43,360
she will all this type of shit.

875
00:52:43,930 --> 00:52:48,850
She wanted me to slap her in the face and
all this, all this crazy shit that, uh,

876
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:52,540
that all these fucking women
shows they never address.

877
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:57,400
They never addressed the amount
of fucking women that liked that.

878
00:52:57,401 --> 00:53:00,040
They like it rough.
It's fucking insane.

879
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:04,000
Unless I just keep picking the same kinds
of fucking women, but it's ridiculous.

880
00:53:04,001 --> 00:53:08,470
The amount of fucking Bra that
I've gone out with, you know,

881
00:53:08,471 --> 00:53:12,400
fucking women's Lib, fucking Blah,
blah, blah. My career comes first.

882
00:53:12,401 --> 00:53:17,390
If we get married, I'm not taking your
last name, Yadda Yadda, fucking Yada,

883
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:20,673
right?

884
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,900
Then you get them in, you
know, the fucking all pro
women. There's pro women that,

885
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:28,200
and I'm making my own money and fucking,
you know,

886
00:53:28,201 --> 00:53:32,020
in a couple of other fucking lyrics
from some stupid Beyonce song, right?

887
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:33,820
All that fucking horse shit.

888
00:53:33,821 --> 00:53:38,410
You're going to respect me eyeball
to eyeball the images of women on TV,

889
00:53:38,411 --> 00:53:40,120
all that fucking horse shit.

890
00:53:40,510 --> 00:53:43,420
And then you get them back to
your place and lo and behold,

891
00:53:43,421 --> 00:53:48,040
they have a rape fantasy. You know, am
I the only guy by the only fucking guy.

892
00:53:48,610 --> 00:53:51,700
So anyways, so I see these
fucking deceased, these hordes.

893
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:56,170
Father didn't stick around,
you know, George Foreman Grill.

894
00:53:56,171 --> 00:53:58,270
Eaton fucking just,

895
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:03,700
just never had a chance
for girls just coming out.

896
00:54:03,701 --> 00:54:06,790
Just never had a fucking chance.
And you know,

897
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:11,170
just dressed like fucking truck stock,
fucking whores.

898
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:12,730
And the sad thing is,

899
00:54:12,731 --> 00:54:16,990
is they think they look good and they
don't even realize the vibe that they're

900
00:54:16,991 --> 00:54:21,820
putting out. They don't know any better.
They don't fucking know any better.

901
00:54:21,970 --> 00:54:25,090
All right? There was a rusted out
car in their front yard that day.

902
00:54:25,091 --> 00:54:29,410
They were born and they never
had a fucking chance. You know,

903
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:36,720
the only fucking male voice that was in
their household when they was growing up

904
00:54:36,731 --> 00:54:40,120
was the Billy Best that the deaf,
they're fucking dead left behind.

905
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:42,310
You know what I mean? Just, they
just never had a fucking chance.

906
00:54:42,311 --> 00:54:45,520
So that was my first red flag
and I was gone off. God, maybe.

907
00:54:45,521 --> 00:54:49,270
Maybe they use some sky miles.
Is that how they got in here?

908
00:54:49,271 --> 00:54:51,330
And I just walked into the
second I walked in. I just,

909
00:54:51,370 --> 00:54:56,370
I just tell the caliber of human being
that was in there straight across the

910
00:54:56,651 --> 00:55:01,090
board here. Alright. The
caliber or white person,

911
00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:05,350
the caliber of black person,
the caliber of fucking male female,

912
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:08,050
you just can tell.
You know what I mean?

913
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:10,800
Saw some black dude,

914
00:55:10,801 --> 00:55:13,980
you know when they get their hair braided
but they don't have enough money to

915
00:55:13,981 --> 00:55:17,370
fucking get it braided enough so they got
all those little hairs sticking out of

916
00:55:17,371 --> 00:55:20,820
it, you know, cause he can't see the
scalp in between the braids. You know,

917
00:55:20,821 --> 00:55:23,550
it's not looking fucking right.
It's just not looking right.

918
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:27,360
The fucking white dude with
the chief Anderson little suit,

919
00:55:27,361 --> 00:55:32,130
the fucking creased up Brown loafers
with this gold lamay horse shit on the

920
00:55:32,131 --> 00:55:33,750
front of it.
You know,

921
00:55:33,751 --> 00:55:38,751
shoes look like they cost 11 bucks and
I'm just going out and now God least let

922
00:55:39,031 --> 00:55:42,150
the fucking room be clean, you know? So
I check and the lady behind the counter,

923
00:55:42,151 --> 00:55:44,660
she was nice enough,
you know,

924
00:55:44,690 --> 00:55:46,730
I don't know how she ended
up at this fucking Sheridan.

925
00:55:46,731 --> 00:55:50,930
Maybe she has stepped out of line
at the big a stockholders meeting.

926
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:54,560
This is, this is, they're
stitched Sheridan Siberia.

927
00:55:55,510 --> 00:56:00,080
So then I go up to my room and uh,
it's weird. It had like one of the,

928
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:02,390
it's almost looked like a little house.
You come walking in,

929
00:56:02,570 --> 00:56:05,960
there's a door and right next to it
there's this big window for some stupid

930
00:56:05,961 --> 00:56:06,794
fucking reason.

931
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:12,320
If I want to overlook half the elevators
in the fucking poor excuse for a pool

932
00:56:12,321 --> 00:56:15,110
that they had, so the blinds
would were down. All right.

933
00:56:15,111 --> 00:56:18,980
So I open it up and it's a sweet,
I'm like Nice. It was a nice room.

934
00:56:18,981 --> 00:56:19,880
It wasn't bad at all.

935
00:56:19,881 --> 00:56:24,630
So I'm in there for like five fucking
minutes and I hear this knock on the door,

936
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:28,830
right? Guy fucking knocks on the
door. It was covered in foam.

937
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:32,730
So that's what it sounded like.
And I opened the door,

938
00:56:32,731 --> 00:56:36,690
there's a guy standing there with this
giant coffee table and he goes and he's

939
00:56:36,691 --> 00:56:39,750
trying to walk in with this giant
cocktail. I'm like, Whoa, whoa. I go,

940
00:56:39,751 --> 00:56:42,450
you got the wrong room. I didn't
order a table. He goes, not all this,

941
00:56:42,451 --> 00:56:46,470
this tables is your, your,
your room's missing a table.

942
00:56:47,050 --> 00:56:51,420
Like it is. They go, yeah. Yeah. The last
people who are here broke the other table.

943
00:56:52,530 --> 00:56:55,860
I was like, Jesus Christ, what? They have
like a party or something. Anyway, yeah,

944
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:58,830
I thought he was going to say
no. He went like, yeah and I go,

945
00:56:58,831 --> 00:57:01,980
well did they fucking feel
they get the place now?

946
00:57:01,981 --> 00:57:03,760
I think everything's been just dawn.
I mean,

947
00:57:03,761 --> 00:57:07,800
you know I'm laying in fucking angel
dust and cocaine and shit. You know,

948
00:57:10,090 --> 00:57:13,000
he keeps getting worse that I'm sitting
there for another couple of minutes and

949
00:57:13,001 --> 00:57:15,460
then I just hear this lady
telling this story. Right.

950
00:57:17,390 --> 00:57:18,223
Mother fucker

951
00:57:20,590 --> 00:57:25,590
tell me that mother fucker can't
come up with a motherfucker.

952
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:27,640
And I'm like,

953
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:32,640
is that it leaves it at least a guest is
that at least the guests and I fucking

954
00:57:32,891 --> 00:57:37,150
opened the blinds to my window and she's
one of the people cleaning the rooms.

955
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:42,810
Just cursing up a fucking
store loud as fucking hell.

956
00:57:43,690 --> 00:57:44,340
Okay.

957
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:45,121
Like all broke.

958
00:57:45,121 --> 00:57:48,660
He broke people are the loudest fucking
people because they live near the

959
00:57:48,661 --> 00:57:52,870
freeways. They lived near the subway.
They used to shouting over shit.

960
00:57:52,871 --> 00:57:56,870
So she's out there. This mother fucker
trying to tell me what time it is paid.

961
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:58,530
Right.
And just screaming

962
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:02,210
and you know how much I curse.

963
00:58:02,830 --> 00:58:03,220
Okay.

964
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:07,600
Okay. I was offended and you know
how much I curse. I was just like,

965
00:58:07,601 --> 00:58:10,940
Jesus Christ, can you please,
I might have kids someday.

966
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:14,690
Can you please stop Carsten like that.
But I didn't say shit cause I,

967
00:58:14,691 --> 00:58:18,580
I mean at that point I knew it. What was
going to happen? I would have been like,

968
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:20,850
oh, it just would've been like,
excuse me, could you do me a favor?

969
00:58:20,851 --> 00:58:21,720
Could you use now?

970
00:58:25,010 --> 00:58:27,700
Ain't nobody talking to you baby.
Right.

971
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:30,390
I didn't want to go through that whole
fucking thing at her screaming at me.

972
00:58:30,391 --> 00:58:33,840
Plus she was so fucking big. She
probably could've just choke, slammed me.

973
00:58:33,990 --> 00:58:36,180
And we would have had to have
a new fucking table in my room,

974
00:58:36,330 --> 00:58:39,330
third fucking table that week.
And I'm a conservationalist.

975
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:43,750
Is that the right word? So, oh my God,
fuck it. Whatever. So I don't say shit.

976
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,770
So anyway,
so I dropped you off at Darwin.

977
00:58:46,771 --> 00:58:50,910
It was just unbelievably depressing
that people have to live that way.

978
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:54,780
Fellow Americans have to live that
way and that we're always sitting here

979
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:58,800
fucking acting like we give a shit about
other countries and we need to help out.

980
00:58:58,801 --> 00:59:01,570
We don't, all right, well we,

981
00:59:01,571 --> 00:59:05,440
I mean you give a shit or I give a shit,
but our government doesn't,

982
00:59:05,470 --> 00:59:08,320
we're working our way in
there to help them out.

983
00:59:08,321 --> 00:59:12,910
Air quotes so we can take their natural
resources. All right. That's how it is.

984
00:59:13,450 --> 00:59:17,920
That's what the fuck is really going
on. If you ever wondered why, all right,

985
00:59:17,921 --> 00:59:22,340
they don't give a fuck about upper Darby,
new New Orleans or whatever. Fuck it.

986
00:59:22,341 --> 00:59:26,390
All those blue collar towns that
are failing out there in Ohio,

987
00:59:26,391 --> 00:59:28,430
they don't give a shit about
them cause they already own them.

988
00:59:28,610 --> 00:59:30,050
So if there's any oil to be had,

989
00:59:30,051 --> 00:59:31,850
they can just go in and
suck it out of the ground

990
00:59:33,830 --> 00:59:35,480
that it didn't make any fucking sense.
So anyway,

991
00:59:35,481 --> 00:59:40,190
so I go back to my ghetto ass
fucking Sheridan. Alright.

992
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:45,260
I come walking in there and uh,
if this point,

993
00:59:45,261 --> 00:59:47,180
it's one in the morning.
Now,

994
00:59:47,181 --> 00:59:49,730
if it was one in the morning
and I was at a nice hotel,

995
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:53,810
there'd be the usual thing. There would
be some people hanging down at the bar,

996
00:59:54,050 --> 00:59:57,080
you know, drinking, getting
ready to cheat on their spouses.

997
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:02,150
Dress nicely though.
All right.

998
01:00:02,151 --> 01:00:04,520
But because it was a
ghetto fucking Sheridan,

999
01:00:04,521 --> 01:00:09,521
I went down there and most of the people
in the lobby where children running

1000
01:00:10,011 --> 01:00:13,610
around screaming like one in the morning,
kids just running around.

1001
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,280
I felt like I was in
fucking Atlantic city.

1002
01:00:16,310 --> 01:00:18,740
You know those gamblers
degenerate gamblers,

1003
01:00:18,741 --> 01:00:20,330
they don't fucking handle
their kids. Right, right.

1004
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:25,040
So just as see a fucking children. I
mean, I was waiting for fucking, you know,

1005
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:29,860
Yohei was missing with somebody there,
you know, gathering them like you could,

1006
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:32,510
you could've had a children's choir.
That's how many fucking kids were there.

1007
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:37,280
So I could go up the elevator and I,
and I get out,

1008
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:40,340
get out of the elevator and I walked
back up to my little, you know,

1009
01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:42,950
I told you the front of the room looked
like a house and there was a door.

1010
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:45,950
And then there's the window.
And as I'm looking,

1011
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:49,520
I'm at the door as I'm looking
down to take out my hotel key.

1012
01:00:49,521 --> 01:00:54,521
I looked down and on the window sill
is a three quarter eaten chicken wing

1013
01:00:58,610 --> 01:01:01,910
sitting on the fucking window sill.
I got pictures to prove it.

1014
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:06,290
They're all going to be up on the
[inaudible] pot. Mm. podcast.com.

1015
01:01:07,010 --> 01:01:09,580
Whatever the fuck it is.
Is that the name of the website?

1016
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:12,980
You know the name of the fucking website?
The Hell's wrong with me? Yeah, the MM.

1017
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:17,930
The MM podcast.com. Uh, if you go up
there, I'll have all these pictures,

1018
01:01:17,931 --> 01:01:20,720
the pictures of, uh, the
tower theater and all that.

1019
01:01:20,721 --> 01:01:23,420
I didn't take any pictures when I was
driving through upper Darby could for

1020
01:01:23,421 --> 01:01:26,540
obvious fucking reasons. I didn't
want to be, you know, I just,

1021
01:01:26,541 --> 01:01:29,480
I would not want to be taking pictures
down there cause people either think

1022
01:01:29,481 --> 01:01:34,220
you're a cop or you're just at a
documentary. They're level of poverty,

1023
01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:37,940
which would be fucking in knowing to me
if I was in that situation. So anyways,

1024
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:43,210
with that, that was my, Oh, and then
the next morning I woke up and uh,

1025
01:01:43,230 --> 01:01:45,440
I,
I dropped my car off it budget.

1026
01:01:45,441 --> 01:01:49,340
It was fucking hilarious
when these hilarious racial
moments here is I go to get

1027
01:01:49,341 --> 01:01:52,850
on the bus, the bus drivers,
black five white guys get on it.

1028
01:01:53,150 --> 01:01:56,570
He asked us where we're going, I got
US air. This guy says this and blah,

1029
01:01:56,571 --> 01:01:56,960
blah blah.

1030
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:01,520
So we're driving in that
and he's listening to this
preacher because it's Sunday

1031
01:02:01,521 --> 01:02:04,820
morning and the guy, you know,
he's talking about, you know,

1032
01:02:04,821 --> 01:02:07,430
people need to be in to Jesus and
blah, blah, blah, all this, you know,

1033
01:02:07,431 --> 01:02:08,780
regular Jesus Shit,
right?

1034
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:13,310
But then all of a sudden he starts
talking about Obama and around he's just

1035
01:02:13,311 --> 01:02:16,950
starts kind of trashing white people
just go.

1036
01:02:16,951 --> 01:02:21,951
And we should be giving thanks to Jesus
that a strong black man is president.

1037
01:02:22,450 --> 01:02:27,450
It's not afraid to stand up to the white
supremacy that we run in this country

1038
01:02:28,390 --> 01:02:29,810
and he's got it cracked.

1039
01:02:32,090 --> 01:02:34,190
And I'm sitting there fucking and all.

1040
01:02:34,191 --> 01:02:36,440
I did just cause I
wanted to have the laugh.

1041
01:02:36,470 --> 01:02:39,230
I just turned around and looked at
all the other four white guys and then

1042
01:02:39,231 --> 01:02:42,380
everybody is just sort of sitting down
looking at that wing tips like rarely.

1043
01:02:42,740 --> 01:02:47,330
What exactly is the call here? Or
can we say something? You know,

1044
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:51,140
excuse me, we're not all
white supremacy. You know,

1045
01:02:51,770 --> 01:02:55,190
like what exactly is the proper response
to that? Because I thought it was,

1046
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:57,470
I don't know. I actually thought
it was fucking hilarious.

1047
01:02:57,471 --> 01:03:01,110
I wish I could remember what the guy's
saying. Ah, Jesus. Now I'm fucking bomb.

1048
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:02,510
And again on this fucking podcast

1049
01:03:07,030 --> 01:03:07,863
dress.

1050
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:20,213
Okay.

1051
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:33,080
Somebody who wants to fill my girlfriend.

1052
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:36,510
It's like a centerfold.
Good for you. She's blonde.

1053
01:03:36,511 --> 01:03:41,070
She has a beautiful face,
a tiny waist and giant cans.

1054
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:46,740
I have outdone myself. What? What the
fuck man, don't you sell yourself short?

1055
01:03:46,741 --> 01:03:50,820
Maybe you, maybe you're a, you're
a stud. So he says, however,

1056
01:03:50,821 --> 01:03:54,120
having a girlfriend of such
caliber as you might imagine,

1057
01:03:54,121 --> 01:03:58,440
comes with its share of problems.
Genes is, here we go. Like,

1058
01:03:58,441 --> 01:04:01,560
uh, like your good self.
I battle my battle,

1059
01:04:01,561 --> 01:04:05,280
keeping my temper under control at
times and particularly struggle when my

1060
01:04:05,281 --> 01:04:08,130
girlfriend and I go out in
public together. In short,

1061
01:04:08,131 --> 01:04:11,310
the amount of male attention
she gets is ridiculous.

1062
01:04:11,610 --> 01:04:13,860
And if times it's infuriating.

1063
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:19,410
Have you ever found you found yourself
out with a girl and notice that every man

1064
01:04:19,411 --> 01:04:24,411
within a three mile radius from the
sweaty 22 year old walking boner to the

1065
01:04:25,771 --> 01:04:26,251
porky,

1066
01:04:26,251 --> 01:04:31,110
sexually frustrated father of three is
blatantly staring at her tits in her ass?

1067
01:04:31,860 --> 01:04:36,540
Um, I've always been of the opinion
that if a girl is obviously with a guy,

1068
01:04:36,930 --> 01:04:38,310
whether you know him or not,

1069
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:43,340
it's a gentleman's code not to have a
staring contest with there with her,

1070
01:04:43,590 --> 01:04:46,560
with her a ring piece.
I don't know what that means.

1071
01:04:46,561 --> 01:04:49,860
What's that looking at her pussy. I have
no idea. This guys from Australia, um,

1072
01:04:49,861 --> 01:04:54,060
if a girl there's a loan
or with girlfriends, sure
objectify the shit out of her.

1073
01:04:54,450 --> 01:04:58,110
But I think if a girl is holding hands
with your boyfriend and you make it

1074
01:04:58,111 --> 01:05:02,760
obvious that your helmet is pressing
against the inside of your front Zipper,

1075
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,630
then you're a cunt. Um, nothing
serious has happened yet,

1076
01:05:06,631 --> 01:05:08,430
but the weather is getting warmer.

1077
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:16,030
The outfits are getting smaller and I'm
concerned I'm going to wind up with,

1078
01:05:16,060 --> 01:05:21,060
I'm going to wind up with perverts blood
and quite possibly come on my hands all

1079
01:05:21,201 --> 01:05:23,210
for now. Um, all right.

1080
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:25,133
Okay.

1081
01:05:25,470 --> 01:05:28,380
All right. This is a tricky
situation. She's are, you know,

1082
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:33,090
is a very tricky situation.
You know,

1083
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:36,540
there's a price you pay for everything.
All right?

1084
01:05:36,570 --> 01:05:41,570
You're the one who has a
centerfold fucking girlfriend
with a great ass and Nice

1085
01:05:41,611 --> 01:05:45,420
set of fucking tits and a,
you just, you just have to,

1086
01:05:46,870 --> 01:05:47,330
okay,

1087
01:05:47,330 --> 01:05:50,990
this, this, this is, this
is how I look at this shit.

1088
01:05:52,750 --> 01:05:57,750
As long as you're a woman isn't going
around trying to get attention if she's

1089
01:05:58,601 --> 01:06:02,830
just fucking standing there and she's
so goddamn stunning that men are looking

1090
01:06:02,831 --> 01:06:05,800
at her, but you know, she's not, Ooh,

1091
01:06:05,801 --> 01:06:10,780
I dropped my lipstick and then slowly
bending over at the waist while looking

1092
01:06:10,781 --> 01:06:13,720
over her shoulder. Um,
if she's doing that,

1093
01:06:13,721 --> 01:06:18,160
I can tell you right now a bang or
another couple of times and then fucking

1094
01:06:18,161 --> 01:06:22,700
dumper because she's going to be an
absolute fucking nightmare. And a,

1095
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:24,280
you don't need that in your life,
okay.

1096
01:06:24,281 --> 01:06:29,020
But if she's just a
stunningly gorgeous woman, um,

1097
01:06:29,050 --> 01:06:32,890
you, that kind of comes with it. And, uh,

1098
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:37,030
if you lose your fucking temper
and you start acting like a maniac,

1099
01:06:37,031 --> 01:06:40,060
that's a great way to eventually
annoy the shit out of her.

1100
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:44,920
And because she can't help
it. Like I said, if she's
not trying to get attention,

1101
01:06:44,921 --> 01:06:49,200
she can't help it, that
she's gorgeous. And uh,

1102
01:06:49,660 --> 01:06:52,720
if you then,
it's in this weird way,

1103
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:55,420
you're giving her shit for being herself,

1104
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:59,740
which is not fun for anybody and then
you're going to have a problem. So,

1105
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:01,310
okay.

1106
01:07:01,310 --> 01:07:05,840
Um, I don't know how to, if you
know what it's like, it's like a,

1107
01:07:05,841 --> 01:07:09,320
it's like when I whore myself out at
the end of my shows and I sell DVDs.

1108
01:07:09,750 --> 01:07:11,150
All right.
I don't have to do that,

1109
01:07:11,151 --> 01:07:14,450
but I choose to do it and I'm
standing as a choice. I fucking made.

1110
01:07:14,870 --> 01:07:17,720
And then I stand there and what's
going to happen? I answered this. Yeah.

1111
01:07:17,721 --> 01:07:20,500
This is one of these podcast questions.
Alright?

1112
01:07:20,830 --> 01:07:23,560
Eventually somebody is going to come up
and they're going to fucking insult me.

1113
01:07:23,561 --> 01:07:26,570
He's tell me they didn't
like my act. Tell me. Uh,

1114
01:07:26,571 --> 01:07:29,990
they didn't think I was as funny as
when he saw me on TV and I can't get mad

1115
01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:33,830
because it's my fucking fault for
standing there like an asshole.

1116
01:07:35,090 --> 01:07:39,990
Just, you know, I, I put myself on the
Dunkin store and I got to admit, sir, if,

1117
01:07:39,991 --> 01:07:43,460
if you're, if this, if your girl is
the way that you've described her,

1118
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:47,190
you just have to accept that it's,
it's par for the course and, uh,

1119
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:51,290
just give yourself a little halftime
speech before you go out. You know,

1120
01:07:51,291 --> 01:07:55,250
I'm not going to lose my shit. Um, but

1121
01:07:57,370 --> 01:07:59,270
if it is overt,
uh,

1122
01:07:59,290 --> 01:08:04,290
there has to be a way that you can fucking
address it without pissing her off,

1123
01:08:04,631 --> 01:08:09,070
without, you know, you also don't
want to get into a fucking fight. Um,

1124
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:13,920
I dunno. Just say, hey buddy can,

1125
01:08:13,921 --> 01:08:17,670
can you limit it to like know five
second shifts of staring at her tea?

1126
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:21,850
I can't say tits.
Uh,

1127
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:25,720
I don't know what you do.
Do that. That's a rough one.
That's a rough run. They, man,

1128
01:08:25,721 --> 01:08:27,630
that takes me back to being a,

1129
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:29,900
okay

1130
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:32,480
Jesus Christ. I was like 21
years old. I went on this,

1131
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:36,620
I went out on a date with this girl who
was well out of my fucking league just

1132
01:08:36,621 --> 01:08:38,840
because I didn't have the
confidence to fucking be with her,

1133
01:08:38,841 --> 01:08:43,130
you know what I mean? Um, beautiful girl.

1134
01:08:43,131 --> 01:08:46,040
And I went out with her and I noticed he
just kept looking around the restaurant

1135
01:08:46,041 --> 01:08:49,790
to see who was looking at her and I
remembered it annoyed the shit out of me,

1136
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:53,360
but I, I, I didn't have any
experience with beautiful women,

1137
01:08:53,361 --> 01:08:58,160
so I just sort of accepted it. And um,
but I never went out with her again.

1138
01:08:58,161 --> 01:09:02,270
It just, it drove it. I stopped, I tapped
out somewhere through the fucking dinner.

1139
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:04,970
Even back then, I was an angry
son of a bitch. I was like,

1140
01:09:04,971 --> 01:09:05,511
let me get this straight.

1141
01:09:05,511 --> 01:09:08,300
I'm buying you fucking dinner and
you're looking around to see who's Elsa

1142
01:09:08,330 --> 01:09:12,560
staring at your tits.
Um, yeah, you're a cunt.

1143
01:09:13,540 --> 01:09:16,820
Good looking cunt. But uh, nonetheless,

1144
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:19,400
someday those looks are going to be gone.

1145
01:09:19,401 --> 01:09:20,930
And I'm just going to
be left with the cunt.

1146
01:09:22,190 --> 01:09:26,180
You know who's going to be a psycho cunt
because you're an attention whore and

1147
01:09:26,181 --> 01:09:27,500
when the attention goes away,

1148
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:30,560
you're going to be like some celebrity
who fell off the fucking man.

1149
01:09:30,590 --> 01:09:33,470
Fuck this bitch. Fuck this. Know.

1150
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:36,510
And that was the other big shows

1151
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:44,480
she does.
She gets what she wants.

1152
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:48,620
She puts the rest on a
tray and the zip blah

1153
01:09:51,330 --> 01:09:52,163
in the freezer.

1154
01:10:01,890 --> 01:10:03,300
He doesn't care.

1155
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:14,393
Does

1156
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:22,273
make

1157
01:10:26,550 --> 01:10:27,383
money.

1158
01:10:30,940 --> 01:10:33,420
He's gone a little gold watch.
She's

1159
01:10:35,740 --> 01:10:40,310
dressed mouse on his.
