1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:02,370
Okay.

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:03,900
Hey, what's going on? Is Bill Burn?

3
00:00:03,901 --> 00:00:08,460
It's time for the Monday morning
podcast for Monday, May 1st,

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,170
2017 what's going on?
How

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:16,570
you liked that echo?
I am in my garage.

6
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:18,900
This is what it's come down to.

7
00:00:18,901 --> 00:00:21,720
It's like fucking a quarter to seven
or 10 and seven in the morning.

8
00:00:21,721 --> 00:00:25,020
I got to go to the airport.
My lovely daughter was sleeping.

9
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:29,610
My wife is sleeping. There is no place
in the house, so me to scream and yell.

10
00:00:29,611 --> 00:00:33,120
So I'm out here in the garage and
oh by the way, in less than a mile,

11
00:00:33,121 --> 00:00:34,800
but an hour around eight o'clock.

12
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,150
There's people coming
to my house cause I'm,

13
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:44,730
well, you know the gas line is,
I dunno, 96 years fucking old.

14
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:51,450
It needs to be replaced because it's
leaking all over the goddamn place.

15
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:55,390
Um, that's always fun to
have a baby in your hands.

16
00:00:55,391 --> 00:00:59,300
You set it down towards the floor and
he kept to say things DYF like, um,

17
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:00,910
do you smell gas?

18
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,370
So I'm getting that taken care
of today and uh, this is it.

19
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,930
This is where my life is at.

20
00:01:07,931 --> 00:01:12,070
So I'm sitting here on
my workout bench that uh,

21
00:01:12,071 --> 00:01:15,820
I can't use cause I fucked up my shoulder.
It's gradually getting better.

22
00:01:15,821 --> 00:01:20,680
This is the longest, most nagging
fucking injury ever to try to heal.

23
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:24,400
But I'm almost there and um,
this is how I'm going to do with people.

24
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:26,200
This is how I'm going to celebrate.

25
00:01:26,201 --> 00:01:29,140
This is the 10 year anniversary
of the Monday morning podcast.

26
00:01:29,141 --> 00:01:33,580
Can you believe that for 10 years
I have been yapping to myself,

27
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:39,310
you know, 10 years. I have
not been reading 10 years.

28
00:01:39,311 --> 00:01:41,800
I had been making up shit for 10 years.

29
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:45,460
I've been saying shit that I thought was
true cause I heard somebody say it in

30
00:01:45,461 --> 00:01:49,240
an airport. I've been doing
that for 10 years. Um,

31
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:54,270
I want to thank everybody who's been
listening and I'm going to put a link to a

32
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:57,440
post, whatever the fuck
you guys say. It's,

33
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:00,040
it's a thing that you click on and then
it goes to the video that you want to

34
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:04,840
watch. What will be the, um, the
first Monday morning podcast ever,

35
00:02:04,841 --> 00:02:08,950
which I believe was about 90 seconds long.
I'll give you a little history.

36
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:13,300
I was over a Robert
Kelly's apartment back.

37
00:02:13,301 --> 00:02:16,180
We still live right around the corner
of each other when I was still living in

38
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:19,780
New York City and it was over his
house and he was just, you know,

39
00:02:19,781 --> 00:02:23,100
it was typical Bob. He was just like, hey,

40
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,850
you should do a podcast gig.

41
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:30,090
This isn't to May of 2007 one of the few
things I've ever been at the beginning

42
00:02:30,641 --> 00:02:34,930
of podcasting and getting
a special on Netflix.

43
00:02:34,931 --> 00:02:38,440
Those are the two things I was
at the front. Like I remember,

44
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:42,530
you know, for my intro and comedy
clubs, I would say a, they like,

45
00:02:42,531 --> 00:02:45,110
what do you want to say? Oh, say
he's been on this, he's been on that.

46
00:02:45,111 --> 00:02:49,880
And you can see he might've seen his
specials on Netflix and the host would say

47
00:02:49,881 --> 00:02:51,200
it and people would snicker.

48
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:52,390
Yeah,

49
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:56,150
they'd laugh in the crowd. They'd laugh
at that credit. Well now look at it. Huh?

50
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:58,840
Look at the feed the
fucking world dominating.

51
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:05,020
You know these oil companies now
to look at Netflix like, God damn,

52
00:03:05,021 --> 00:03:09,730
how the fuck did you do that
without firing a shot? How
the fuck did you do that?

53
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:14,200
Right. So Netflix, Netflix,

54
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,150
and podcasting, you know, if I was, if
I was on a, an oil company, I would, uh,

55
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,570
I said I would do, I would start
coming up with some original content,

56
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:26,770
you know what I mean? And just
make the show so amazing, you know,

57
00:03:26,771 --> 00:03:29,950
that the stars would then go over to
those countries and while everybody was

58
00:03:29,951 --> 00:03:33,370
fawning over the cast of
the reboot of friends,

59
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,770
I would then run around the corner and I
would start stealing their oil. That's,

60
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:41,180
that's how I would do it. You know,
it's a lot less messy. You don't,

61
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:43,780
there's excitement. Am I
going to get caught? Right?

62
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,330
Yeah.

63
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:49,340
Um, anyways, back in the day, so I'm
over Brava Kelly's apartment. He's like,

64
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,200
did he,
you should do a podcast.

65
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,060
And I was like, what is
a, what does a podcast

66
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:59,590
[inaudible] recording?

67
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:03,480
It's another way to connect
with your fears. Do, who knows?

68
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:05,613
Okay.

69
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,160
Now people listen to it.

70
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:13,000
You do in the stress factory
Tuesday to Sunday, dude.

71
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:16,430
And I'm literally just fucking around
on it. And I actually, I called it,

72
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,940
if you listen to my first podcast, he
listened to the link. I actually said it.

73
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,420
I said, ah, this is my podcast.

74
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:26,690
I was basically repeating everything
that Bobby was kinda yelling to me in the

75
00:04:26,691 --> 00:04:30,860
background. And um, and I called it,

76
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:34,700
I said a and who knows, maybe this
might lead to something mediocre.

77
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:38,900
And you know what, it took me to
taking me 10 years, but God damn it,

78
00:04:38,901 --> 00:04:41,060
I got there.
Here I am

79
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,480
sitting here and my fucking garage.

80
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:48,080
This is not some sort of cool
reverb that you listening to.

81
00:04:48,081 --> 00:04:50,640
This is me and my garage.
Um,

82
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,460
you know what's amazing though
is I gotta tell you something.

83
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,810
I don't know what it is. It's, I'm such
a cliched guy. I fucking love the garage.

84
00:04:58,811 --> 00:05:01,150
The garage is the shit.
You know what I mean?

85
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:05,560
It takes you back to being a single
man when you barely had anything.

86
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,780
Cause I have one of those fucking garages.
By the way,

87
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:12,900
I was not going to be the person that had
the garage. Right. That like you. Yeah.

88
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,800
Bye. Shit. And there's no more
room for this shit in your house.

89
00:05:15,801 --> 00:05:19,860
And then you take some other shit that
you used to like and you stick it in a

90
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,840
box and then you stick it in the garage,

91
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:26,160
right and gradually starts encroaching
on the car and next thing you know,

92
00:05:26,161 --> 00:05:29,520
the car can't be in there and it just
fucking fills all the way up. Well,

93
00:05:29,521 --> 00:05:33,190
you know what you're doing.
You're slowly becoming a fucking hoarder.

94
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:38,380
That's one of the saddest
things. I actually, you know,

95
00:05:38,381 --> 00:05:42,460
I came at and understand whether
it's sad or whether it's, um,

96
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,420
you just taking responsibility for,

97
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:50,200
for all the shit that you
buy in your life. You know,

98
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:55,210
I guess anybody could take
it down to goodwill. Anybody
can throw it in the trash

99
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,140
take to the dump.

100
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:02,550
It takes a real caring human being,

101
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,340
a real caring human
being to just sit there

102
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:11,580
and [inaudible] and all that fucking shit.
You bought your entire life.

103
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,580
Every fucking newspaper,
every tube of toothpaste,

104
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,560
just sitting them suffocating in
your own fucking carbon footprint.

105
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:26,540
You know, I just realized, you know, we
shouldn't be looking down at hoarders.

106
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:30,890
We should be looking at these people
going like, Holy Shit, one human being,

107
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,390
one human being can buy
all of that shit and alive.

108
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:39,300
It's not even a lifetime.
They still live in, you know,

109
00:06:39,301 --> 00:06:42,900
you can have that many pets,
fucking fish tags,

110
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,400
newspapers and all of
that crap. Um, I dunno,

111
00:06:47,401 --> 00:06:51,090
I would happen. I'm sitting there
looking over right now. You know,

112
00:06:51,091 --> 00:06:55,560
my neat little fucking garage.
I got like two different rooms.

113
00:06:55,561 --> 00:06:58,590
I got this old fucking mop. I don't
even know where that thing came from.

114
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,650
I think it came with the house,
you know?

115
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:02,733
Yeah.

116
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:05,910
And I've been meaning to throw that
thing up. Where does it end up?

117
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:07,683
Huh?

118
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:10,650
Fucking in some beavers house.

119
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:14,550
Some stupid mop handles sticking through
his little sucking thatch of a roof.

120
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:20,010
All those things fast. By the way.
I get those giant Goddamn teeth.

121
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:24,910
Fucking horse teeth, dude. It's so they
can cut through the back dude. Anyways,

122
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:27,600
so it's been 10 years in.
Um, I'm actually, you know,

123
00:07:27,601 --> 00:07:31,350
I had people on Twitter send in
some of their favorite moments,

124
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,130
which I'll be reading later if I could
somehow get this fucking computer to work

125
00:07:35,131 --> 00:07:39,750
while I'm out here. Um, yeah. So anyways,

126
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:42,600
let's get on with the podcast.
So I didn't know if I even said it.

127
00:07:42,601 --> 00:07:45,420
Thank you guys for listening.
Uh, throughout the years.

128
00:07:45,421 --> 00:07:49,560
Thank you to everybody who's
booth advertised on the podcast,

129
00:07:49,561 --> 00:07:51,960
whether you liked the read or you didn't,

130
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:56,490
whether you got upset and said that
I'm never going to advertise again.

131
00:07:56,491 --> 00:07:59,490
Whatever it was, it was fun. A lot of fun.

132
00:07:59,491 --> 00:08:04,020
So here's to the next 10 years,
I'm still not going to read,

133
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:08,580
right. I Dunno. Whatever.

134
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:11,460
You know what I liked though?
I'm a buck 76 right now.

135
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:15,150
I do like that the way 176 pounds.
So roughly the fucking way there was,

136
00:08:15,151 --> 00:08:17,550
I was probably a few pounds lighter,
but I got to get down to it.

137
00:08:17,551 --> 00:08:20,280
I got to get down the end of the
month, next month, my birthday,

138
00:08:20,281 --> 00:08:24,690
I want to be like one 71 71. Right. And
you know what? I get down to that way.

139
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:28,580
I get down to that way. Guess
what? Then I'll be happy. Ah.

140
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,720
Then it will fill the void.
You know when I go on,

141
00:08:30,721 --> 00:08:35,280
I put my little fucking tiger woods golf
shirt on even though I don't fucking

142
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:36,114
golf.

143
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:37,693
MMM.

144
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,760
Anyways. Is that fucking guy ever
going to win another tournament?

145
00:08:40,761 --> 00:08:41,690
It really bugs me.

146
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:45,620
Really fucking bothers me that there's
a bunch of broads out there that think

147
00:08:45,621 --> 00:08:48,140
the reason why he never want to another
fucking tournament was because of the

148
00:08:48,141 --> 00:08:51,200
bullshit of his personal life.
Give me a fucking break.

149
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:56,550
His body broke down. That's what the
fuck happened. This guy's a champion.

150
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,970
Do you understand what the champion could
do? Champion can block anything out.

151
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:02,910
If you see these guys going up trying
to get the fucking free throws,

152
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:05,550
everybody just waving their hands,

153
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:10,380
screaming a bunch of shit about the guy's
wife. What does he do? Nothing but net.

154
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:14,190
Nothing but fucking net.
You know, sky can't handle.

155
00:09:14,191 --> 00:09:17,400
A little spat gets hit with a golf club.

156
00:09:17,401 --> 00:09:20,250
He jumps in his Escalade and he hits a
fucking Rose Bush and all of a sudden,

157
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:25,110
all of that talent goes away.
I don't know. I don't buy it.

158
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:27,180
I think the,
and I think the reason why some women,

159
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:31,020
some women look at me being a little
measured in the next 10 years.

160
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:35,910
Some women, the reason why I think they
attributed to that is because I, you know,

161
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,790
I think that they want to buy
into that whole fucking thing.

162
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:42,900
He's behind the like, man is a
good woman. You know what I mean?

163
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:48,600
Which is so fucking stupid,
right? Obviously if you have
a happy fucking marriage,

164
00:09:48,601 --> 00:09:51,930
your life's going to be all right. But
that's just another fucking, you know,

165
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,910
everybody's always stealing credit.

166
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:56,920
Are we set up as a Hollywood thing until
you get into a relationship and it's,

167
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:00,900
everybody's fucking sits there. Oh,
now I'm laying down. There you go.

168
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:03,300
Now the back's better. Now.
The fucking back's better.

169
00:10:03,301 --> 00:10:05,450
I don't even want to talk about,
um,

170
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:10,520
to anybody wants a formula
one race from Sochi in, uh,

171
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:13,320
in Russia. It's such a
weird name. So cheap.

172
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,750
That sounds like a more like a,

173
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,710
like a Chinese or Japanese.
Vietnamese. So cheap.

174
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:23,520
That does not sound
like Russian dark evil.

175
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:26,390
[inaudible] so ci,

176
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:31,770
that sounds too happy to be Russian,
but I have to tell you it was a fucking,

177
00:10:31,771 --> 00:10:35,280
that's a what? A gorgeous city that
is. Huh? You know what I mean? I mean,

178
00:10:35,281 --> 00:10:39,120
Russia scares the shit out of me.
I grew up during the end of the Cold War,

179
00:10:39,121 --> 00:10:41,190
so I just figured you're going
to go over there and the second,

180
00:10:41,191 --> 00:10:46,170
if you have any sort of a, I dunno,
American Shit on, it's just, you know,

181
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,540
I remember being in Finland being in
this cap and it blew my mind how close I

182
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:55,320
was to Russia. It's like, well I
can't believe I'm this, you know,

183
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,930
Far East into Europe.

184
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,930
And I asked the guy if he'd ever been
there and he started telling me about

185
00:11:00,931 --> 00:11:05,790
Moscow. It was, you know, a little
dangerous after five, you know,

186
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,210
and I'm deciding, I just did the math
in my head. It's like, all right,

187
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:14,460
this guy's saying it's a little dangerous.
Finland beat Russia,

188
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:18,950
Finland defeated fucking
style. Okay. Style.

189
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:23,960
And whose those fucking people ran
over the Goddamn Nazi army with their

190
00:11:24,391 --> 00:11:27,690
Mercedes Benz fucking tanks.
Right?

191
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:29,400
The portion jeeps,

192
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:35,220
I can't name one fucking Russian car.

193
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:39,870
All right. Just the sheer will
and toughness of those people,

194
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:43,530
you know? Yeah. We read those
stories and them fucking,

195
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:47,550
they're running around in their socks
in the middle of a Russian winter just

196
00:11:47,551 --> 00:11:52,050
running the fucking German army.
Right back to Jeremy. You know?

197
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:54,430
Or where else would the German
people go back to? Well,

198
00:11:54,431 --> 00:11:57,090
I could have retreated back to Poland.
God knows they fucking took that over,

199
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:57,943
right?

200
00:11:58,370 --> 00:11:58,980
Yeah.

201
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,570
So I'm thinking,
you know,

202
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:02,010
okay,

203
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:04,770
take a beat. These guys,
Jesus Christ. What,

204
00:12:04,771 --> 00:12:06,930
how the fuck would they lose to Finland?
You know,

205
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:11,280
that's the championship match right there.
That's Cleveland versus the warriors.

206
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:14,130
Finland. I mean, I was looking
at them like, all right,

207
00:12:14,131 --> 00:12:17,880
that's the fucking warriors verse.
I Dunno the Phoenix Suns,

208
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,360
but the,
uh,

209
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:22,740
okay.

210
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,440
I Dunno, they fucking be
the fucking kick their ass.

211
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:30,710
But what sucked for them was at the
end of the war when Germany lost,

212
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:34,840
Italy fell and all that shit,
when the axis powers loss,

213
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:39,540
they were on the wrong side of the fucking
table. So they went down with them.

214
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:41,250
It was like a co op,
you know what I mean?

215
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,770
Like if you pay off your shares in
the building, you're like, all right,

216
00:12:43,771 --> 00:12:46,950
I own my apartment. It's like, no you
don't. You won't shares in this building.

217
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,140
But if everybody else goes belly up,

218
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:52,440
the whole fucking thing is done
and then you lose your shares.

219
00:12:52,441 --> 00:12:55,440
You have to go back to renting your
apartment or you have to fucking leave.

220
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,600
That's what it was like.
And that's what happened to them.

221
00:12:57,601 --> 00:13:00,570
They paid off their shares in the
building in Italy and Germany went fucking

222
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:04,570
bankrupt. And uh, next thing you know,
that was it. And they had the giveaways,

223
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:08,900
like the southern part of their fucking
country or some shit there to give away.

224
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:12,660
Basically the stadium in which they won
the game, they had to give that to them.

225
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:15,200
I'm pretty sure that's what the fuck
happened. So when he was subsequently go,

226
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,070
and this is the,

227
00:13:16,071 --> 00:13:19,920
this is the DNA that this guy comes from
and he's telling me that after five it

228
00:13:19,921 --> 00:13:24,720
gets a little fucking scary. These
are the people that fucking, you know,

229
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:30,360
looked old, Yosef Stalin in
the fucking ice, you know,

230
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,380
fucking kicked his ass. He be like
around fucking cross country skis,

231
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,130
cross country ski CPT sons of
bitches and this guy's nervous.

232
00:13:38,131 --> 00:13:42,150
So it's just like wow, it's gotta
be a scary fucking place over there.

233
00:13:42,151 --> 00:13:46,560
And then I'm watching the f
one race on some ci right.

234
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,670
And it was fucking beautiful.

235
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:56,220
It looked like a Ron Howard film
starring Tom Hanks. You know,

236
00:13:56,221 --> 00:13:58,710
you had a beautiful city
in the background. You had,

237
00:13:58,711 --> 00:14:02,360
you went into a forest and
you had mountains, a little
snow caps on top of it.

238
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:06,090
It looked like a postcard. Like when
they take a postcard of Los Angeles,

239
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:07,860
you know,

240
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:12,390
like once a year it's clear enough
where you could take a picture of the

241
00:14:12,391 --> 00:14:16,980
downtown La Skyline and then see snow
capped mountains in the background.

242
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,420
Right. Cause they always
say that, you know,

243
00:14:18,421 --> 00:14:22,110
you can snowboard in the morning
and be surfing in the afternoon.

244
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:25,650
And if you're in La, you're looking around
going, where the fucking you snowboard.

245
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:30,150
It's cause you can't see, he can see
through all the fucking pollution. Um,

246
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:34,110
so anyway, so I'm watching this
goddamn race from Sochi, right?

247
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:35,970
Okay.

248
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:38,910
And um,
I got to tell you,

249
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:41,460
F one f one figured it out so far.

250
00:14:41,461 --> 00:14:45,090
Four races in another
really exciting race.

251
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:46,900
Okay.

252
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:47,740
I don't know what happened.

253
00:14:47,741 --> 00:14:51,010
They made the tires 30% bigger and all
of a sudden there's more fucking grip.

254
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,130
The Dad would force all this shit that
they talk about and it before every

255
00:14:54,131 --> 00:14:55,630
frigging race,
I don't know what happened,

256
00:14:55,631 --> 00:15:00,450
but all I know and friary made better
cars. Now all of a sudden it's a,

257
00:15:00,451 --> 00:15:04,320
at least she got two teams race and Ford
is supposed to last year or was just a

258
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:06,720
Nico and, uh, Lewis Hamilton.

259
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:11,910
So anyways, congratulations. I
hope I say, speaking of Finland,

260
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:17,760
oh by say this guy's name, right?
Mercedes Benz, a tier two driver,

261
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:22,500
the upstart, the Tom Cruise
and days of thunder, right? Uh,

262
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:26,400
vault Valtteri bolt us.
I hope I said that right.

263
00:15:26,401 --> 00:15:29,890
And he's like one of like nine
finished drivers to everyone.

264
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:34,890
A Formula One race. It congratulations
him drove great race. Uh,

265
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,500
Sebastian Vettel from Ferrari,
second place,

266
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,340
Kimi Raikkonen broken in
Sydney is raking in Kimmy.

267
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,940
So Cheeky Kimmy,
Kimchi,

268
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:49,660
Kimmy Reagan and for Ferrari came in
third and then Lewis Hamilton came and

269
00:15:49,661 --> 00:15:53,110
forth. I can tell you right now, he
wasn't happy. You know, he wasn't happy.

270
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,960
That guy doesn't give a fuck if his
car doesn't work. He doesn't get,

271
00:15:55,961 --> 00:15:58,240
he'll fucking run his own
teammate off the fucking track.

272
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,250
That's what I,
a little I know about that race.

273
00:16:03,251 --> 00:16:06,010
All I know is if he's not
winning and his teammate can,

274
00:16:06,011 --> 00:16:09,600
when he doesn't give a fuck, he's
not getting out of the way. You know,

275
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:14,650
he just doesn't give a shit.
Um, but then he also wins.

276
00:16:14,651 --> 00:16:18,040
So whatever. Uh, so I guess that puts, uh,

277
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,560
the fuck's his name.
I was fucking up.

278
00:16:20,561 --> 00:16:24,220
Sebastian Vettel isn't
first place he's got,

279
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:29,230
I think he's got two wins and two
second places. So you get 25, 25,

280
00:16:29,231 --> 00:16:32,830
18 and 18.
So that's 50 and 3,686 points.

281
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,440
And I think, uh, you know,
I'm in the garage, dude.

282
00:16:38,441 --> 00:16:39,910
I don't know the fucking
internet as far as I remember.

283
00:16:39,911 --> 00:16:43,650
I think Lewis Hamilton has one victory,
two second places and a fourth.

284
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,140
Okay.

285
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,360
So that's 25,
18 and 18.

286
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:52,990
Oh Jesus Christ was at 61 36 and 25 slash
61 I'm going to say at 61 and he's got

287
00:16:55,581 --> 00:17:00,290
a fourth place. When you give for
fourth place, like 15. I don't know.

288
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:03,470
He's got like, I dunno, we'll say
76 some shit. I don't fucking know.

289
00:17:03,471 --> 00:17:06,950
All I know is it shaping up to be a
great year and for whatever reason,

290
00:17:06,951 --> 00:17:11,120
even though I have German blood in
me, uh, no Italian blood. I actually,

291
00:17:11,121 --> 00:17:12,030
I'm rooting for the fryer.

292
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:15,530
It's just because last year was it got
boring Mercedes one every fucking race.

293
00:17:15,531 --> 00:17:20,470
So it's good to see Ferrari
back. Um, and by, by the way,

294
00:17:20,471 --> 00:17:22,270
shout out to force India.

295
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:23,640
Yeah,

296
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,890
I think they came in eighth and ninth.
I was sixth and seventh.

297
00:17:25,891 --> 00:17:30,240
My fault for having the balls.
They have pink cars out there or Fuchsia,

298
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,740
whatever you want to call them.

299
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:32,780
Okay.

300
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:35,000
You know, they'd been Mike, my uh,

301
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,630
my other team like I want to see
one of them win a race this year.

302
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:41,300
I want to see a pink
car when a fucking race.

303
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:48,680
It's just funny to me.
So anyways,

304
00:17:48,681 --> 00:17:50,050
I don't know where the next race is.

305
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:50,781
I would look it up.

306
00:17:50,781 --> 00:17:54,260
Usually if I'm not fucking laying on
the floor of my God damned garage,

307
00:17:54,261 --> 00:17:56,870
I would know where the next uh,
the next race was.

308
00:17:56,871 --> 00:17:58,100
I know there's probably a
lot of you going like, Bill,

309
00:17:58,101 --> 00:18:00,830
what the fuck you getting into his,
first of all, it's a great fucking sport.

310
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:05,630
Second of law, it doesn't take a lot
of time to watch. There was 52 laps.

311
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:11,510
It's it, you can very
easily add debt, you know,

312
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,290
to whatever sports you watch.

313
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:15,770
And I'm telling you even during
the NBA and the NHL playoffs,

314
00:18:15,771 --> 00:18:18,320
cause I fucking watched everything.
You know,

315
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,350
I watched the Saint Louis
Blues right this weekend.

316
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:25,850
Watch them win and over time
game to believe it was game two.

317
00:18:25,851 --> 00:18:28,730
I watch so much shit this weekend
I watched, uh, the last two games,

318
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:32,450
Anaheim versus Edmonton.
Um,

319
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:36,470
amazing to see Edmonton like all of
a sudden looking like, wait a minute,

320
00:18:36,471 --> 00:18:39,680
these guys are going to be the
western conference champions,

321
00:18:39,681 --> 00:18:42,140
the way they are applying and all of
a sudden they get the old right there.

322
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:44,780
Fred from the fucking ducks in Edmonton,

323
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:48,140
one of those weird series where the three
games in and the home team has yet to

324
00:18:48,141 --> 00:18:52,640
win a lot of children going home
crying during that series so far.

325
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:57,320
And um, I hate to say this is a
Bruins fan, but fucking Lou Cheech,

326
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,030
he looks right in that
uniform and I got to feel,

327
00:19:01,031 --> 00:19:03,850
and he's going to stay there for awhile.
I don't know what kind of contract he's,

328
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:09,290
I don't know, signed up
there, but um, Jesus Christ,

329
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,130
he's looking like the old blue cheese
just to fucking force in nature.

330
00:19:13,131 --> 00:19:16,370
I remember he would like fucking bring
it over the Blue Line and he sorta had

331
00:19:16,371 --> 00:19:17,690
control of it,
but he didn't.

332
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,720
And he sort of just be kicking it in
and she wants somebody else's trying to

333
00:19:20,721 --> 00:19:23,330
like fucking stop them. You just
give him a little fucking forearm.

334
00:19:23,331 --> 00:19:27,980
The guy would fall down, he'd pass it
over version running score out. And she's,

335
00:19:27,981 --> 00:19:31,120
I miss those days. Anyways.
Uh, but watching that,

336
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:34,070
of course I watched the
Celtics fucking wizards.

337
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,321
Ah,

338
00:19:36,321 --> 00:19:41,000
the old sports rivalry that most of
the sports world does not realize is a

339
00:19:41,001 --> 00:19:43,910
fucking rivalry.
These two teams hate each other,

340
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:49,010
but you know the deal, it's all about
the fucking golden state warriors.

341
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,910
It's all about the Cleveland
Cavaliers. And, um,

342
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:55,930
so no one's really paying attention,
right?

343
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:58,970
No one's paying attention to these two
fucking people. They know. It'd be like,

344
00:19:58,971 --> 00:20:02,120
you know, you've got the rolling stones
and the Beatles and everybody says,

345
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:04,730
oh my God, they're fucking
amazing. And then meanwhile,

346
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:08,240
Herman in the hermit's doesn't get
along with the fucking partridge family.

347
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,440
I don't think we're that bad.

348
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:14,640
I'd like to think that we're not that
bad. But, um, anyways, so the first,

349
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:18,020
like if to give you a little bit of a
background for whatever stupid reason,

350
00:20:18,021 --> 00:20:21,110
earlier this season,
the wizards were like,

351
00:20:21,111 --> 00:20:25,190
we're going to dress all in black when
we play you guys, cause it's going to be,

352
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,100
it's going to be like a
funeral. And I was like, Oh,

353
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:33,050
J g h is that what you're going to do?
And then what are we going to do now?

354
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,033
Try,

355
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:40,400
are you going to try extra,
not extra hard tonight?

356
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:43,010
Fucking wizards,
right?

357
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:48,090
So even with that stupid
little fashion that they made,

358
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:51,690
they still beat us. So, but
not because they were black.

359
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:56,230
They beat us because they
scored more points. So anyways,

360
00:20:56,231 --> 00:20:59,580
so we're getting ready to go see them.
Uh, we're getting ready to play them.

361
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:02,130
And um,
my buddy Josh,

362
00:21:02,131 --> 00:21:07,131
Adam Meyers from the goddamn
comedy jam and from the comedy jam,

363
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,240
they had to clean it
up on a comedy central.

364
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,330
We decided that we're going to go down
to a cigar bar and we're going to watch

365
00:21:12,331 --> 00:21:16,440
the fucking game together. He's a
big wizards fan and a, and he's a,

366
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:20,580
she's a Shit Talker, right? So
He's been talking shit, you know,

367
00:21:20,581 --> 00:21:22,050
cause I think they won the,
uh,

368
00:21:22,051 --> 00:21:24,330
I think we beat them like once
and they beat us like three times.

369
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,193
I can't even remember.

370
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:29,120
And he was talking all this shit and at
one point they were ahead of us in like

371
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:32,310
the rankings. They were number two, we
went up a three or something like that.

372
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,280
He was just talking all
of this fucking shit.

373
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:39,840
So the game starts to Goldbar
bar doesn't open till 11 games.

374
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:40,683
It comes on at 10.

375
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:44,530
So I'm sitting there watching the
fucking first quarter they go up to,

376
00:21:44,531 --> 00:21:48,490
to nothing. Dennis, five to nothing.
Seven and nothing. Nine to nothing.

377
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:51,910
Fucking 12 to 16 and nothing
in case you missed the game,

378
00:21:51,911 --> 00:21:55,870
you don't have fucking sports center
or whatever. 16 to fucking nothing.

379
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:57,410
Yeah.

380
00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:00,020
To start the game, the game, it's over.

381
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:04,670
If it's any sort of illegitimates
I will legitimate sport.

382
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,370
This game is over and I gotta be,
I gotta be honest with you.

383
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:12,430
I will never like 100% be able to believe
that that basketball is not fixed.

384
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:15,570
Okay.

385
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:16,530
I don't understand it.

386
00:22:16,531 --> 00:22:21,240
I don't understand how one team
can spot another team's 16 points.

387
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:26,690
You end the first quarter one teams on
pace to score 120 points or some shit.

388
00:22:27,001 --> 00:22:31,680
And the other teams on pace to score
20 Ah, like 75 or some shit. Right.

389
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:38,120
Or whatever. 80 points or something.
And some I just, it's always,

390
00:22:38,121 --> 00:22:39,350
it's a gable runs.

391
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:44,740
Then out of nowhere they started like
16 to nothing and then we go on like a

392
00:22:45,891 --> 00:22:50,450
fucking 25 to eight runs and
somehow the score's tied. Oh,

393
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:53,620
we're up by like two what the
half? I don't know. I went,

394
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:56,240
I drove to pick him up and then
we went over to the cigar bar.

395
00:22:56,241 --> 00:23:01,241
So there's a lot of Chit chat going on
and by the end of the third quarter we

396
00:23:01,731 --> 00:23:03,140
were up by 15

397
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:04,710
okay.

398
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:06,330
We were down 16 nothing.

399
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:11,900
36 minutes of basketball later were up
by 15 a 31 point fucking turnaround.

400
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:14,490
Okay,

401
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:17,020
thank you man. When the bills came
back against the Houston Oilers,

402
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,820
this basically that,

403
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:23,850
that happens just about
every other game in the NBA.

404
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,630
I don't fucking get it. Well, it's
a game of runs. It's a game. Is it?

405
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:33,520
How does one team come out? Ice fucking
cold. The other team can't miss.

406
00:23:33,521 --> 00:23:34,354
And then like,

407
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:36,150
okay,

408
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:39,570
like I've never had a set where I go on
stage and it's just like I'm on and then

409
00:23:39,571 --> 00:23:43,200
all of a sudden I'm off and then
I'm on again and then I'm off.

410
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,450
That's what happens.
Basketball.

411
00:23:45,451 --> 00:23:49,140
So we're up by 50 Josh is
losing his fucking mind.

412
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,630
He standing up,
he's pacing,

413
00:23:51,631 --> 00:23:54,120
which is hilarious because it's a cigar
bar is supposed to be like totally

414
00:23:54,121 --> 00:23:56,280
Chili's fucking pacing back and forth.

415
00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:01,410
He's slamming down
fucking slices of pizza,

416
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:05,820
you know like doing like stress
eating and I'm just laughing.

417
00:24:05,821 --> 00:24:10,230
I was just going like Josh, it's the
fucking NBA. This game's going to be like,

418
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,530
now we're going to do the fourth quarter.
And because the third quarter ended,

419
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:16,790
the switch gets shut off and the other
one gets flipped on and do what is going

420
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:21,450
to be at fucking tie game. So what
happens? Fourth quarter starts,

421
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:25,680
the fucking Celtics can't score a
bucket for like the first four minutes.

422
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,671
And next thing you know,

423
00:24:26,671 --> 00:24:30,960
like the wizard to down by three and Josh
Joshua sitting down again and I'm just

424
00:24:30,961 --> 00:24:33,480
laughing. It's like, how many fucking
NBA Games do you have to watch?

425
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,250
Which you really do if you just want it,

426
00:24:37,251 --> 00:24:41,240
if you really get into the games and you
feel like you're going to fucking die a

427
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,030
thousand deaths, what you should really
do is just watched the last two minutes.

428
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:49,130
God knows that takes as much time
as the first fucking 46 minutes.

429
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:52,730
Just watched the last two minutes because
it's going to be like a fucking three

430
00:24:52,731 --> 00:24:54,350
point game anyways. And, um,

431
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:00,080
whatever the ebb and flow and then some
other Celtics pulled away again. But, uh,

432
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:04,250
I gotta tell you it's going to be a
fucking brutal series [inaudible] series.

433
00:25:04,251 --> 00:25:07,580
And I think a Jae Crowder might
get kicked out for one game.

434
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,920
This can be some sort
of physical altercation.

435
00:25:09,921 --> 00:25:12,830
I don't know what's going to happen,
but looking into my fucking crystal ball,

436
00:25:12,831 --> 00:25:13,820
I don't know who it's going to be,

437
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,840
but somebody's going to get
fucking kicked out of the game. Uh,

438
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,930
get suspended for a game because he's
fucking teams hate each other. And, um,

439
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,800
you already started to see it happen a
little bit in the first game. I just,

440
00:25:24,801 --> 00:25:26,640
they just don't like each other,
but I gotta tell you some,

441
00:25:26,641 --> 00:25:31,160
I actually love that John Wall
guy. I loved one, uh, uh, Josh,

442
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,710
show me this fucking,
uh,

443
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,660
whatever the fuck Instagram
picture or something like that.

444
00:25:35,661 --> 00:25:39,650
It gets a couple of years ago,
they lost to the, uh, Atlanta, um,

445
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:44,450
the fuck are they? The hawks, the
Atlanta Hawks. Yeah. Saint Louis Hawks,

446
00:25:44,451 --> 00:25:49,340
the Atlanta Hawks, right? They lose
two. And one of the guys on Atlanta,

447
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:54,050
you know, they had a picture of them.
Then the final seconds of winning

448
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:58,980
and John Wall has a real sad look on his
face to do the posts of it's real happy.

449
00:25:58,981 --> 00:26:03,530
And then there's another Lana Hawk
looking at John Wall laughing at him. And,

450
00:26:03,531 --> 00:26:08,340
uh, I guess John Walden, forget about
this. So when they beat Atlanta,

451
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,340
he posted a picture of him,
you know,

452
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:13,890
doing a crossover in the gout posted
the picture fell on his fucking ass.

453
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:17,400
I love people that hold grudges like that.
I think that to be great,

454
00:26:17,401 --> 00:26:22,110
you have to be like that, which is why
Eli Manning is such a fucking enigma.

455
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,570
You know what I mean? I swear to God,
like if you saw that guy in the most

456
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:31,520
in the final two,
two minute office of a Superbowl,

457
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:36,530
his heart rate is the same is somebody
at a fucking bake sale right outside of

458
00:26:37,111 --> 00:26:38,070
church.
You know what I mean?

459
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:42,510
Oh he thanks for coming out or
how big your kids are getting.

460
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:43,870
That's where his heart rate is.

461
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,950
You know,
I swear to God they should just see it.

462
00:26:46,951 --> 00:26:50,290
All those dockers he's always wearing
with the fucking sweater tucked into them.

463
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:54,640
They should just make a uniform just
to completely psych out the other team.

464
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:59,070
If I was the giant side, he'd have like
a special pair of football pants. They'd,

465
00:26:59,071 --> 00:27:02,020
they'd be the same colors. Dockers.
He'd still have the pads and shit in it.

466
00:27:02,021 --> 00:27:04,600
But you know,
some sort of dad jeans.

467
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:10,870
So anyways, I think the Celtics
was just going to go, uh,

468
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:15,430
I think that's going to go seven and I
think it's going to be fucking brutal.

469
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:19,950
I think, uh, the wizards when the next
one, and then I think we split down in DC,

470
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,090
I think it's just going to go back and
forth, back and forth, back and forth. Um,

471
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:27,910
did that evenly matched and um, I
dunno. I always forget the guy's name.

472
00:27:27,911 --> 00:27:29,920
That fucking Polish Transylvanian Dude,

473
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:32,770
the white dude with a shaved
head whose entire body is,

474
00:27:32,771 --> 00:27:35,830
is fucking hard as the top
of his goddamn head. I mean,

475
00:27:35,831 --> 00:27:39,190
that guy looks like he could have
played like fucking professionally,

476
00:27:39,191 --> 00:27:41,140
could have played like at
least three different sports.

477
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:47,790
Fucking played spin, some gigantic
fucking tight end. You know,

478
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:52,480
he's there. His body, he's like
fucking White Lebron. I know, I know.

479
00:27:52,481 --> 00:27:55,140
I've gone on a limb there, but I'm telling
you that guy, he's a fucking beast.

480
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:59,100
Who's joker with Josh coming?
His Dad fucking grew up in eastern Europe.

481
00:27:59,101 --> 00:28:03,270
His Dad probably fucking beat him with
one of those fireplace. Pokers all right.

482
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:06,650
We're all laughing. I was sitting there
going like that. That can't be the name.

483
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:11,400
Okay. There's gotta be a different
name for the four fire fireplace poker.

484
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:15,000
I'm just saying what it
does that can't be the name.

485
00:28:15,001 --> 00:28:17,310
And I looked it up and that's
exactly what it's called.

486
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:18,830
Okay.

487
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:21,470
Fireplace poker.
That's the best they could come up with.

488
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:26,660
They couldn't come up with some widget
name, you know, even with like the ladies,

489
00:28:26,661 --> 00:28:29,120
they got that thing they put in their
hair. Somebody came up. What's it called?

490
00:28:29,121 --> 00:28:33,080
That has called a Flowbee.
Oh, what? Yeah. A Flowbee.

491
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,760
The fuck is a Flowbee. I had
something. You sticking your hair,

492
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:41,780
it makes it to a couple of woopty dues.
I don't know what I'm talking about.

493
00:28:41,781 --> 00:28:44,540
Let me do, um, let me, uh,

494
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:47,450
let me read a little advertising here
and then I'll talk about what a sad time

495
00:28:47,451 --> 00:28:51,140
it is to be a Washington DC
fucking sports fan. Jesus Christ.

496
00:28:51,141 --> 00:28:53,480
All the fucking crying
these Cleveland fans did.

497
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:58,250
Did you ever see a city cry as much as
say did? Oh, we show funky, miserable.

498
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,040
I mean, maybe they did that in
Boston back when we weren't,

499
00:29:01,041 --> 00:29:03,500
weren't fucking winning, but I always
hated that shit over a long time ago.

500
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:06,950
Espn did this whole,
they wouldn't have some trial.

501
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:10,910
Like who has the more
miserable fucking sports fans?

502
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:14,610
Cubs fans are red sox fans. I remember
sitting at home laughing going, dude,

503
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:17,270
I don't know. I don't know
when this, you want to be more.

504
00:29:17,271 --> 00:29:18,860
Who the fuck wants to
be the most miserable?

505
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:20,403
MMM.

506
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,810
You know who those fucking the kind of
person you don't want to run into in a

507
00:29:24,811 --> 00:29:27,260
goddamn bar.
You know?

508
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:32,010
Could you sit there and just talk about
how life fucked him over? Sorry. Anyways,

509
00:29:32,011 --> 00:29:34,830
let me them read some of the, some
of this advertising here. Oh my God.

510
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:39,300
It's that time.
It's that time of year when you can say,

511
00:29:39,301 --> 00:29:42,190
I got to get something for my mother

512
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,600
pro flowers.

513
00:29:43,601 --> 00:29:47,650
Everybody talk about how
being a mom is often,

514
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:52,690
often a thankless job and mother's Day
is a chance to show your appreciation.

515
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:58,290
Um, I think that's talked about enough,
isn't it? It's always, you know,

516
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,180
I want to see if they have
that copy for father's day,

517
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:05,370
that it's a fucking thankless job when
we taste something right now. All right.

518
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:10,380
Is is difficult a job is being a mother
is you fucking babies are obsessed with

519
00:30:12,281 --> 00:30:16,000
you. My daughter barely looks at me. She
just looked at me, she smiles like, Hey,

520
00:30:16,001 --> 00:30:19,510
there's that guy that I kind of know,
but my wife walks in the room,

521
00:30:19,511 --> 00:30:23,050
she just like, she just follows her all
around. Just is looking at it. I'm like,

522
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:27,640
hey other parent or the parent over
here, Yo, Yo. You know what I mean?

523
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:28,491
You know like when you're at the,

524
00:30:28,491 --> 00:30:32,140
at the game and they're thrown free
tee shirts into the crowd, right.

525
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,740
And you standing up and then there's a
group of fucking hoe like hot chicks and

526
00:30:35,741 --> 00:30:39,880
shit. Like, like you're getting the
tee shirt. It doesn't stop you though.

527
00:30:39,881 --> 00:30:44,380
You still stand up fucking flailing.
Your arms never happens.

528
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:49,480
Um, so evidently for some reason
being a mom is a thankless job.

529
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:52,780
Even though everybody always talks
about how important the job is.

530
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:56,800
There's not one presidential election
that doesn't go by where they don't talk

531
00:30:56,801 --> 00:30:59,350
about it. Everybody's
always saying, you know,

532
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:02,920
mothers are saints and all of
this type of shit. You know,

533
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:05,560
what do they say about that?
They say nothing.

534
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:10,300
It's like put both on the same record
label, but only their album gets height.

535
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:13,420
You know, when our fucking do
nothing, managers go and like, yeah,

536
00:31:13,421 --> 00:31:15,790
you promised us at least one billboard.

537
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:17,860
Okay,

538
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:22,860
Easter fucking vine. You know,
you can't even give us that. Um,

539
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:26,230
but evidently I have to do it
again. Oh, Jesus. You know,

540
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:29,530
Keith just can't fucking
thank these divas enough.

541
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:36,110
These mothers out there. Is there anything
worse than when you listen to a woman?

542
00:31:36,111 --> 00:31:39,400
Say she lost herself in the relationship.
You know, and then you find that,

543
00:31:39,401 --> 00:31:43,550
you know, it's one thing if you just,
you know, if you don't have kids,

544
00:31:43,551 --> 00:31:47,350
but if a woman says that and they
have kids right there, you know what?

545
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:49,790
Terrible mother,
she deserves no flowers.

546
00:31:49,791 --> 00:31:51,740
But the rest of you ladies listen to this.

547
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:56,840
When you send the 100 blooms

whatever from pro flowers,

you will make a real impression. Oh yeah.
Now your mother's going to love you.

550
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:07,550
It looks down their work in the sibling
rivalry into this. He's fucking,

551
00:32:07,551 --> 00:32:09,740
people have no shame over that.

of what this thing is.

569
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,760
They act like this is the one thing
you need to get your mom. It isn't.

570
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:26,510
This is like at least the
thing you got to get few mom,

571
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:31,710
this is a great [inaudible] to something
else. Um, I do it every single year.

572
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,400
It's nice and fucking easy. And you
know what? Your mother loves flowers.

573
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:39,720
You know why? Because moms
are dreamers. They believe.

574
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:42,720
They believe that their husband's
not going to come home hammered.

575
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:46,680
This is the time Angela's ashes.
He's not going right to the pub.

576
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:50,640
He's finally going to take my kid to the
doctor and figure out what that fucking

577
00:33:50,641 --> 00:33:54,420
eye infection is. You guys ever read
that book? Angela's ashes. Jesus Christ.

578
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,940
You know, you thought Charlie Brown
had a bad trying to kick the football.

579
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:03,720
Fucking poor bastards went for
their dad to come up with the money.

580
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:06,060
Never came on. Went to

583
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:17,430
Everybody talk about a mom
you really admire and why?

584
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:20,220
Well,
wouldn't that be my mom?

585
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:25,350
I'll tell you as much as I love
my mom is a mob down the street.

586
00:34:25,351 --> 00:34:27,450
She just has those intangibles.

587
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:32,280
Mother's Day is coming
up and Sherry's berries.

588
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:37,500
Was that like some politically correct
thing? Like talk about your mom. Well,

589
00:34:37,501 --> 00:34:41,660
what about what if the podcast Ma mom's
dead? What about that? We want to,

there's a lot of things I think during
the day and that was not one of them.

599
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,020
I don't even know what they look like.

600
00:35:13,021 --> 00:35:17,430
I don't even understand why they taste
so good. We'll go fuck. Figure that out.

601
00:35:17,431 --> 00:35:19,950
God bless the person that did cause.
These things are delicious.

I will tell you that. Um, but you had,
but you've never seen anything like these.

603
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:27,210
Sherry's berries are huge, sweet, juicy,

604
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:31,680
and covered in decking and topics.
Chocolate chips,

605
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:35,130

berries, interoffice. Slash. Workplace.

610
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:56,350
You can't send chocolate covered
strawberries to your mom at work.

611
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:58,750
Everybody's going to think
she's having an affair.

Okay.

Andy's getting ready for mother's
Day Badu due to Mandy's Mia.

00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:14,380
Andy's drop your drawers
and she'll say, hey, Yay.

633
00:37:14,381 --> 00:37:16,910
Cup your velvety underwear drawers.

634
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:19,570
Stop shaking your ass.

635
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:24,600

you put on your Randy's for mother's Day.

636
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:29,790

Jesus Christ. Bill, how do you sell
underwear after that? Well, I dunno,

645
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,800
but we're going to try it.
All right.

646
00:37:59,801 --> 00:38:02,640
Elevate your underwear game to
the next level with me on DC.

647
00:38:02,641 --> 00:38:05,530
You've perfected your wardrobe,
but what about the stuff?

648
00:38:05,531 --> 00:38:09,730
Not everybody gets to see if you've been
settling for store, bought underwear,

649
00:38:09,731 --> 00:38:10,451
five packs.

650
00:38:10,451 --> 00:38:14,380
If you've been settling for going to
those prepackaged priest sewn together

651
00:38:14,381 --> 00:38:15,490
fucking underwears.

652
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:19,630
I have something that will change
your life for the better me undies.

653

Velvety fucking underwear.

655
00:38:25,751 --> 00:38:29,890
But due to [inaudible] take your
balls out and everyone stares.

656
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:33,520
Looking at this as a 10 year anniversary,
you're getting two songs,

657
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,890
rob nuts up against the modal.

658
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:39,380
Okay.

659
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:41,720
Grab your dog by the fucking throat.

660
00:38:41,721 --> 00:38:45,980
All throw it outside because it took a
shit right next to your underwear drawer.

661
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:51,680
I didn't go to jail for animal cruelty.
Alright me undies are designed in La.

662
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:53,180
Okay.

663
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:55,100
La,
Louisiana plus the Angeles.

664
00:38:55,101 --> 00:39:00,020
Who knows and made from
sustainably sourced micro
modal bow down a fabric three

665
00:39:00,021 --> 00:39:01,640
times softer than cotton.

666
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:06,940
Beyond these softer than soft luxury
under you come in an ever changing

667
00:39:07,521 --> 00:39:09,350
selection of classic colors,

668
00:39:09,351 --> 00:39:14,351
bold shades and adventurous patterns so
you can tailor your undies to your own

669
00:39:14,511 --> 00:39:19,190
personal style. I think this is why
Richard Simmons actually disappeared once.

670
00:39:19,191 --> 00:39:20,900
He could start ordering fucking velvety,

671
00:39:20,901 --> 00:39:24,470
soft different underwear every
fucking day. You know what I mean?

672
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,301
He probably, he's like, well,

673
00:39:26,301 --> 00:39:29,150
I can't wait these candy stripe fucking
shorts anymore. And that's my look.

674
00:39:29,151 --> 00:39:33,740
You know what? I've made enough fucking
money about. All right, and guess what?

675
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,330
You can save time and money.

676
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,540
[inaudible] I've got a frog in my
throat all of a sudden. And guess what?

677
00:39:38,541 --> 00:39:41,660
You could save time and money each
month with a monthly subscription.

678
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:44,990
And if you're not ready for a
scription but then go fuck yourself.

679
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:48,680
Stay with your regular goddamn under
way you piece of shit. No, I'm sorry.

680
00:39:48,681 --> 00:39:51,650
That's a well that's not the copy. If
you, I'm sorry. If you're not ready,

681
00:39:51,651 --> 00:39:54,740
that's okay.
Completely different direction.

682
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:58,820
You can still say that's because me
undies is offering you 20% off your first

686
00:40:12,511 --> 00:40:17,511

689
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:33,200
If you don't have, ah shit, it fell apart.

690
00:40:33,201 --> 00:40:34,820
stamps.com everybody.
I, you know something.

691
00:40:34,821 --> 00:40:39,821
I use stamps.com whenever I'm fucking
sending Mike a fresh pair of me undies out

692
00:40:40,281 --> 00:40:44,780
to Cleveland Hilarides who are, I'm
going to be this Tuesday and Wednesday.

693
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:49,880
Um, I use me on these whenever I'm pouring
myself out selling posters and I'm a

694
00:40:49,881 --> 00:40:52,100
moron if I can figure out how
to use that little device.

695
00:40:52,101 --> 00:40:55,790

00:40:59,380 --> 00:40:59,860

699
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:04,570
what's your favorite clip from fucking
a stroke, race? Whatever you want to do.

700
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:06,860
I can mail any letter,
any package.

701
00:41:06,861 --> 00:41:11,590
She was suggested my computer and printer
and the mailman comes and picks it up.

702
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,570
Unlike the post office.

703
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:17,720
stamps.com never closes right under,

704
00:41:17,721 --> 00:41:19,890
like unlike that fucking
whore you used to do

00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:22,140
date.
Okay.

706
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:25,330
No, I'm saying this wrong
with Sarah legs. Never close.

707
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:27,930
Unlike that prude.

708
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:31,910
I just, just going off the

There you go.

717
00:42:10,941 --> 00:42:13,910
You like that person that graduated
high school and never came back to their

718
00:42:13,911 --> 00:42:17,360
hometown and for some reason thinks that
they're a success because they didn't.

719
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:22,070
You know, you don't, it makes you a
success not leaving your hometown.

720
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:26,780
It's how you treat people and you
know something that's one to grow on.

721
00:42:26,781 --> 00:42:30,170
All right, before I get into the
questions here, let's talk about uh,

722
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:34,550
the Washington sad sack. Washington
DC sports fan. You know what I mean?

723
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:38,120
After all this fucking shit
about cubs fans, red sox fans,

724
00:42:38,121 --> 00:42:40,850
fans of Cleveland Sports.
Meanwhile,

725
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:43,250
look at fucking Washington DC.

726
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,220
They have nothing nationals.
They went and Shit.

727
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:51,770
The Redskins have been a fucking joke,

728
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:55,640
a fucking joke for 25 fucking years.
I know what you think will build.

729
00:42:55,641 --> 00:42:59,210
They want three fucking super bowls in
the previous basically 10 11 years. Yeah,

730
00:42:59,211 --> 00:43:02,690
but you know something.
They got some racist logo on the side.

731
00:43:02,691 --> 00:43:05,570
There was always something to take
it away. You know what I mean?

732
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:07,130
Where does thing ever,

733
00:43:07,131 --> 00:43:10,440
they had some black guy dressed up on
the fucking native American head dress,

734
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,850
maybe had some Indian blood in him. I
have no idea. Native American blood.

735
00:43:13,851 --> 00:43:15,020
Whenever the fuck you supposed to say,

736
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:19,700
you know the capital's how many times
they go with the president's trophy get

737
00:43:19,701 --> 00:43:21,450
bounced out in the second round.
They've won the case.

738
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:25,520
They won the president's trophy three
times since 2009 and every time they'd

739
00:43:25,521 --> 00:43:30,500
lost in the second round and they've
dropped the first two fucking games and I

740
00:43:30,501 --> 00:43:34,820
was watching the end of this series at
home against the Pittsburgh Penguins,

741
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:38,360
the reptilian ice water in their veins.

742
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:40,850
Pittsburgh penguins who
I'm telling you right now.

743
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:43,700
I'll go in on and they're going to
win this second Stanley Cup in a row.

744
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,890
You heard it here.
You heard it.

745
00:43:45,891 --> 00:43:50,610
Now you play it later and you will agree
with me or you don't have a combatant

746
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:53,720
fucking podcast again. No gift. Now
I think they're just going to repeat.

747
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:58,310
That's what it is. They're all
dialed in. They got Phil Kessel,

748
00:43:58,311 --> 00:44:00,800
they got Crosby.
They get so fucking day,

749
00:44:00,801 --> 00:44:03,590
got a fucking mock Andriy flour,

750
00:44:03,591 --> 00:44:06,440
whatever his fucking name
is Theo fucking flurry,

751
00:44:06,441 --> 00:44:08,570
whatever the goaltenders name is,
he doesn't give a shit.

752
00:44:08,571 --> 00:44:12,410
He's out there fucking doing the old
fucking jazz hands stop and everything

753
00:44:12,411 --> 00:44:15,590
that's coming right mark on brief flurry,

754
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:20,810
they got Jido this.
They're just gonna overpower you.

755
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:22,490
It's it.

756
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:27,550
Or does Washington DC with the Capitol
state rise up from the ashes in somehow

757
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:31,990
figure out

758
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:35,230
a fucking way to win. Game three.
I was watching the NHL network.

759
00:44:35,231 --> 00:44:36,360
This guy was going off going,

760
00:44:36,370 --> 00:44:41,370
this is the biggest fucking game in
Washington capitols history and I agree.

761
00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:46,330
They got to do this. They got to
this, and if they don't do this,

762
00:44:46,331 --> 00:44:48,820
they're going to blow up the whole
fucking team. It's going to be sad.

763
00:44:48,821 --> 00:44:50,410
They don't have to start all over again.

764
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:51,930
Okay,

765
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:55,230
Jesus Christ. How do you not root
for the capitals and game three?

766
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:58,220
You got to do it.
I'm going to be rooting for,

767
00:44:59,240 --> 00:44:59,730
yeah

768
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:01,580
dude. Sidney Crosby. I tell
I've been saying this for you.

769
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:04,570
Sidney Crosby's backhand
as more fucking velocity.

770
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:09,190
They're most guys for his most guys wrist
is in the league. It's fucking insane.

771
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:13,750
Thank God you know something. God blessed
his mother for raising him. Right?

772
00:45:13,751 --> 00:45:15,490
Cause I'll tell you right
now with his backhand,

773
00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:18,700
thank God he knows how to treat a woman.
Cause if he didn't Jesus Christ,

774
00:45:18,701 --> 00:45:21,700
he would make Oj looked like a
fucking cub scout. All right,

775
00:45:21,701 --> 00:45:25,810
so game three is coming up.
Definitely check that out.

776
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:28,090
And a,
and with that,

777
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:32,710
here's some of the people's favorite
Monday morning podcast moments.

778
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,590
MMP Bowman's,
that's what Andrew wrote.

779
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:39,770
Oh we should have like the little
big eyed smiling kids here. Um,

780
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:44,560
Douche bag of the week.
Brad, remember that? Um,

781
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:46,300
don't care enough to find the link.

782
00:45:46,301 --> 00:45:50,730
But when Nia gave white people credit
for creating the jug instrument,

783
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:55,090
it was incredible. Uh, that was funny.

784
00:45:55,180 --> 00:46:00,180
Oh then the classic member granny
fucking water it poor best.

785
00:46:00,651 --> 00:46:04,030
It's probably still getting weird looks
for those of you don't know a granny

786
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:06,430
water was,
this guy was playing some fucking game.

787
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:09,360
It's kind of seemed like it was old maid,
but a,

788
00:46:09,370 --> 00:46:11,800
you didn't want to like if you
played the grantee water card,

789
00:46:11,801 --> 00:46:15,490
you fucked everybody else in the game.
So it came as time to play it.

790
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:19,150
And he's with his girlfriend and they're
playing with the parents and out of

791
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:20,590
nowhere,
for whatever reason,

792
00:46:20,591 --> 00:46:25,180
he decides to give him the Monday
morning podcast answer on the f word.

793
00:46:25,181 --> 00:46:28,100
And when he played the car,
he just went granny fucking war

794
00:46:29,830 --> 00:46:31,600
and there was just dead silence.

795
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:32,580
Okay.

796
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:37,580
And then he tried, tried to have to sit
there and explain it to everybody. Uh,

797
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:41,930
the, it's granny fucking water listener
story from last year, I think. Uh,

798
00:46:41,950 --> 00:46:43,290
another one,
greedy fucking water.

799
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:47,490
The infamous Rosebowl story had me in
stitches at work. That was the time when,

800
00:46:47,491 --> 00:46:50,850
uh,
we got to put together a greatest hits.

801
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:55,650
We really got to do that. That was
the first rose bowl that we went to.

802
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:56,920
Yeah.

803
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:00,970
When we stumbled in there and
I fucking lost my balance.

804
00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:04,360
And there was an old woman in front of
me and I had to like at my forum was in

805
00:47:04,361 --> 00:47:08,370
her back and she was kind of leaning
forward and I was just sitting here going,

806
00:47:08,371 --> 00:47:09,670
oh, shy, sorry.

807
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:13,890
And no one helped me up cause he was
so horrified by the condition I was in.

808
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:18,730
The only way for me to get up was I had
to push off of her folded or and half.

809
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:23,720
Oh God. I always get this weird feeling
in my stomach whenever I don't have a,

810
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:25,960
I hate that I did that,
but I did.

811
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:27,410
Yeah,

812
00:47:27,410 --> 00:47:30,100
I apologize. Whoever his grandmother
that, but I made whatever. She's

813
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:32,660
a little more flexible, you know,
she'll enjoy the last, you know,

814
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:35,040
third of her life maybe.
Um,

815
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:39,120
not the person rose bowl
story with Joe Barden. Nick,

816
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:42,310
the old lady who kept getting angry and
calling. Her husband had threatened you,

817
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:44,650
mark. No, she wasn't an old lady.

818
00:47:44,651 --> 00:47:49,150
She was younger and that was the time
she made fun and she made fun to Joe

819
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:52,300
Barton. Nick's nose. Janie had a big
nose and he just looked at her and said,

820
00:47:52,301 --> 00:47:55,000
you need to lose about 30 pounds
before you talk to me, bitch.

821
00:47:55,030 --> 00:47:58,000
And I was just like, Oh God, all
right, we're getting kicked out.

822
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:03,670
And then she said, she's like, mark,
did you hear what he said? Right.

823
00:48:03,671 --> 00:48:06,030
So the guy turns around
to square off with Bartok.

824
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:10,330
Bartok just looks at him and he used his
big as a fucking Pittsburgh linebacker.

825
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:12,070
So the guy takes one look at Bart,
nick,

826
00:48:12,071 --> 00:48:14,970
and then starts fucking yelling at me
and started threatening to throw me down

827
00:48:14,971 --> 00:48:17,640
on the field. Uh, you fucking pussy. Yeah,

828
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:21,490
you go right past Barton and can you
go to old fucking bald carrot top.

829
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:24,820
All right. I'm a new listener.
He's a his his favorite moment.

830
00:48:24,821 --> 00:48:29,821
You asking Nia how she's so loud wearing
slippers and she saying that's why

831
00:48:30,401 --> 00:48:34,930
she's angry with you. That's love. There
you go. Um, all right, another one.

832
00:48:34,931 --> 00:48:38,170
You answered a question about a parrot
like three years ago that it had me

833
00:48:38,171 --> 00:48:41,590
crying, laughing at my job. I got
in trouble. I'll try to find it.

834
00:48:41,890 --> 00:48:46,630
I love how vague these are. This is just
as vague. Um, oh, this person like the,

835
00:48:46,631 --> 00:48:50,320
for me,
I just feel the Kardashians.

836
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:55,150
The Kardashians could literally watch a
baby starve to death and then then they

837
00:48:55,151 --> 00:48:59,140
would be crying, you know, fanning.
They're fucking eyeliner so it doesn't,

838
00:48:59,141 --> 00:49:01,240
you know, smear going. Like for me,

839
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:05,530
I just felt so sad because for me,
um,

840
00:49:05,531 --> 00:49:09,550
it has to be that or the Colby 11th.
Oh God.

841
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:14,050
Kelly Olynyk and those fucking Colby
11th is the worst thing I ever saw.

842
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:19,420
A when you said Corey Feldman was
the Lee Harvey Oswald of the robot,

843
00:49:20,890 --> 00:49:23,530
I had to pull over. I was
laughing so hard. I don't even,

844
00:49:23,531 --> 00:49:27,670
it doesn't even make sense
to me anymore. Um, anyways,

845
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:31,990
let's see. Don't blow it. Keep
it simple. Count your money.

846
00:49:33,290 --> 00:49:36,760
I don't even know what that is. Uh,
when you did the ad for draft kings,

847
00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:38,560
one guy won $1,000.

848
00:49:39,070 --> 00:49:42,970
One guy's giving hand jobs for rent
money or something like that. Oh yeah,

849
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:46,360
that's right. I called that thing out
for fucking being legalized gambling.

850
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:51,710
Um, what else? TC?

851
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:57,040
Come on. Frogs, dude. I
called it barefoot pitches.

852
00:49:57,190 --> 00:50:00,390
There's too many to remember. I'm still
working my way through the older ones,

853
00:50:00,391 --> 00:50:03,160
so this is really making me feel good
that you guys remember all this shit.

854
00:50:03,550 --> 00:50:04,321
All right,
here's another one.

855
00:50:04,321 --> 00:50:08,260
One of the best moments was when you
told the story of going to the basketball

856
00:50:08,261 --> 00:50:12,490
game and they kept playing
that everybody clap your hands.

857
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:16,870
That's right. And it was all that crazy
shit going on. Oh, everybody loves this.

858
00:50:16,871 --> 00:50:18,430
Read Old Zip,

859
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:26,530
uh, nature's box. Yeah,
I fucked that one up.

860
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:28,241
I called. It was,

861
00:50:28,241 --> 00:50:32,810
it was nature box was the name of it
and I thought it was like possessive

862
00:50:32,811 --> 00:50:37,700
nature's box and I was like, you going
down on Mother Nature? Needless to say,

863
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:41,030
that was one and done
read and full refund.

864
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:43,740
Okay.

865
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:45,680
Um,
some point we should put,

866
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:50,100
I want to put together all the fucking
one and done reads that I've had, um,

867
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:55,530
under the clip. Didn't make a dime
off those cans. All right. Um, oh,

868
00:50:55,531 --> 00:50:59,400
the Monday morning podcasts. Nia, did you,
Maria, did you hear about Paula Abdul?

869
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:02,520
She was like,
I was like,

870
00:51:02,910 --> 00:51:05,910
she's a former backup dancer for
the Lakers and now a big pop star.

871
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:10,390
She thought she died. I did it
better the first time. Anyways. Uh,

872
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:15,150
when you told Nia about not checking
out the funniest thing ever?

873
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:19,380
Oh yeah. When I don't check out at
hotels, um, I just walk out. I'm done.

874
00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:21,300
Done with you fucking people.
Uh,

875
00:51:21,301 --> 00:51:24,690
when you compared Harry Truman
to the guy from Shawshank,

876
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:29,400
am I being obtuse or your last
draft? Kings read. All right.

877
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:33,090
The Charlie Murphy one. No.
Yeah. Yeah. That was, uh,

878
00:51:34,530 --> 00:51:39,030
that was a sad one. But it happy,
happy memories. Uh, the Yoko Ono rant,

879
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:42,750
strawberry poops. That's from the, uh,

880
00:51:42,751 --> 00:51:47,220
the Joe Rogan on it and read a,
anytime you talk about cool cars,

881
00:51:47,221 --> 00:51:51,790
anytime you lean away from the mic
and Yell Lane, uh, we're all humans.

882
00:51:51,791 --> 00:51:56,490
Some of us are good. Most of us are
cons. Oh, the big tears. Big Tears.

883
00:51:57,150 --> 00:52:02,010
When Nia cried and, um, where
were we? Italy. And I didn't
know how to comfort her.

884
00:52:02,170 --> 00:52:04,260
I just kept going.
I was hugging her and she was crying.

885
00:52:04,261 --> 00:52:07,110
She had like the biggest
tears coming out of her eyes,

886
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:11,160
like just fallen on my hands,
like raindrops. I was like
hugging him from behind,

887
00:52:11,161 --> 00:52:13,080
you know, she, she hit her head.

888
00:52:13,081 --> 00:52:15,930
That's why she bent down to pick something
up and there was a shelf and she hit

889
00:52:15,931 --> 00:52:20,340
her head so fucking hard. My, my either my
eyes like, just watered like, Holy Shit.

890
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:23,340
I didn't know how to comfort
us. So she was crying. It just,

891
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:26,510
I just started reporting. But what
was going on? I was just going, ah,

892
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:28,260
that's just going big chairs.

893
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:35,640
All right. As a stoner, I find
your Auntie, we'd rans hilarious.

894
00:52:35,641 --> 00:52:40,170
I get so mad that I started
hyperventilating. The lovely Nia,

895
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:44,280
everybody eggs and not an, it's
not me. It's near like Nancy,

896
00:52:44,730 --> 00:52:48,990
uh, Nia story about hitting her head
in her big tears. Big Tears. All right.

897
00:52:48,991 --> 00:52:51,960
We said that one. Okay. Uh,

898
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:54,600
you said ric flair wouldn't
have come up that fast.

899
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:58,890
I don't even know what that is. Colby 11.
Why are you going to Indianapolis bail?

900
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:00,990
Oh,
that fucking freak from the plane.

901
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:03,110
MMM.

902
00:53:04,470 --> 00:53:04,891
Let me see.

903
00:53:04,891 --> 00:53:09,891
Friends trying to get the rat out of
your new house story is an all time

904
00:53:09,901 --> 00:53:13,500
favorite. Anytime there's a zip all
yeah. When we were renting that house,

905
00:53:13,501 --> 00:53:15,000
when I got the fucking kitchen redundant,

906
00:53:15,870 --> 00:53:17,340
um,
MMM

907
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:21,110
fucking zillion dollars I put in this
house, I'm never going to get back. Uh,

908
00:53:21,111 --> 00:53:24,620
the one time you were talking about
those two guys eating shit or riding the

909
00:53:24,621 --> 00:53:25,454
skateboard

910
00:53:26,390 --> 00:53:27,410
and motorcycle,

911
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:30,770
the skateboard or crashing is the funniest
story you've ever told that needs to

912
00:53:30,771 --> 00:53:34,250
be an animal. Oh my God. They, we
should animate. That is so right.

913
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:39,980
At time I saw that fucking Guy Griffith
park coming down and he wasn't dressed

914
00:53:39,981 --> 00:53:44,300
like a skateboarder and it was like
seven 30 in the morning. You know,

915
00:53:44,301 --> 00:53:47,570
when I was walking my old dog
Cleo, oh, I miss that dog.

916
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:48,770
I'm going to see her again next month.

917
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,850
I just feel it like she's in college
and I still always got a visitor. Look,

918
00:53:52,851 --> 00:53:56,120
I love that dog and I'm fucking going
to be there someday when she takes her

919
00:53:56,121 --> 00:54:00,530
final breaths, I'm going to fucking
be there. Um, anyways. Yeah.

920
00:54:00,531 --> 00:54:05,030
So I was walking my dog and this fucking
guy came by like the biggest hill in

921
00:54:05,031 --> 00:54:08,780
Griffith park and he was just dressed in
street clothes and it started wobbling

922
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:14,610
all my God, a new fucking
reference here, like in a moto GP,

923
00:54:14,630 --> 00:54:17,270
the tank slap when it starts
fucking oscillate and you know,

924
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:19,310
and all of a sudden they
can't get it to stop.

925
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:22,490
He started doing that shit and just like,
I don't know,

926
00:54:22,491 --> 00:54:25,490
I'll try and find the clip because
I was more vivid when I just saw it.

927
00:54:25,491 --> 00:54:28,640
It was one of the fucking
most insane wipeouts.

928
00:54:28,690 --> 00:54:33,050
It easily could have taken
over the agony of defeat, um,

929
00:54:33,290 --> 00:54:37,730
in wide world of sports. Um, anyways. Um,

930
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:41,690
what else? How many six year olds could
you kill before they took you down?

931
00:54:41,691 --> 00:54:43,730
You know, I was actually thinking
about animating that recently,

932
00:54:43,731 --> 00:54:46,730
but after all the fucking psycho horrible
shit that's happened in the world

933
00:54:46,731 --> 00:54:51,290
since I did that used to be
funny, you know, and that's
the world we're living in.

934
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,150
It's not funny anymore to me.
All right,

935
00:54:53,151 --> 00:54:57,350
Doug Flutie heckling story about
a friend who takes things too far.

936
00:54:57,351 --> 00:55:01,760
May Be cry laughing at the gym. No
idea which episode that was. Oh yeah.

937
00:55:01,790 --> 00:55:03,920
That was a buddy of mine who
didn't know how to talk shit.

938
00:55:05,610 --> 00:55:06,110
Okay,

939
00:55:06,110 --> 00:55:07,760
I'll tell you that one quickly.
Uh,

940
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:11,150
Doug Sudi came back playing for the
bills and we're sitting in the end zone

941
00:55:11,151 --> 00:55:13,040
seats and um,

942
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:18,360
everybody's like heckling Doug Flutie
gonyet killed image it. Hey Doug,

943
00:55:18,361 --> 00:55:20,090
you two small blah blah, blah, blah, blah.

944
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:23,980
And my buddy wanted to get in and
all the shit talk and uh, you know,

945
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:28,990
go back to the CFL and everybody's just
trashing him and my buddy doesn't know

946
00:55:29,811 --> 00:55:33,500
where the line is. And he also studied
starters and out of nowhere he just goes,

947
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:36,080
hey, hey, hey, hey Flutie.

948
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:41,560
I hope you kid dies in everybody in the
end zone who was hammered immediately

949
00:55:41,811 --> 00:55:46,430
sobered up just when like, ah, and
everybody just sat shifts like, dude,

950
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:50,600
what the fuck?
Fucking brutal.

951
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:51,770
All right.

952
00:55:51,770 --> 00:55:54,800
Which also used to kind of be amusing to
me until now I have a kid now I'm just

953
00:55:54,801 --> 00:55:58,130
kind of like, yeah, that really, he wasn't
really funny either. Alright, Jason Marks.

954
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:03,500
I don't know what that one is.
Draftkings final read. And lastly,

955
00:56:03,501 --> 00:56:06,200
but not leastly don't wear different.
No nowhere to find the link,

956
00:56:06,201 --> 00:56:11,000
but the one that introduced the great
add Paul Versey where you guys debated

957
00:56:11,001 --> 00:56:15,770
time travel. Oh, that was a good one.
That was a good one, man. All right,

958
00:56:15,771 --> 00:56:18,290
let me read, I got time here
to read a couple of, uh,

959
00:56:20,070 --> 00:56:22,800
a couple of questions here for
the week. All right. Military,

960
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:28,860
uh, their bill of the Boar Bu Oh, Ari,

961
00:56:28,861 --> 00:56:31,320
I don't know what that means.
I will see you podcasts all the time.

962
00:56:31,321 --> 00:56:35,190
I also from time to time, uh,
appreciate your standup comedy.

963
00:56:38,910 --> 00:56:41,050
Oh,
that was a nice backhanded compliment.

964
00:56:41,051 --> 00:56:44,290
I listened to your podcast all the
time and also from time to time,

965
00:56:44,291 --> 00:56:48,160
appreciate your standup comedy. You
know, it's got a ride from time to time.

966
00:56:48,161 --> 00:56:48,994
He makes me smile.

967
00:56:49,330 --> 00:56:53,530
I am from New Hampshire and your video
tour of Hampton beach was right on the

968
00:56:53,531 --> 00:56:57,490
money. I am writing to you about
my best bud in the military.

969
00:56:57,491 --> 00:57:01,810
We are both in the service as
we became friends. He confessed,

970
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:03,430
he confessed that he's a virgin.

971
00:57:03,610 --> 00:57:07,570
At the age of 32 over the past two years
since I've known the guy he refers to

972
00:57:07,571 --> 00:57:08,920
play video games and eat

973
00:57:10,370 --> 00:57:14,750
dunkaroos then going out in public.
Don't go rose.

974
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:16,430
What the fuck are those?
Um,

975
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:20,540
he's an exceptionally funny kid and has
no problem making good impression on

976
00:57:20,541 --> 00:57:22,190
strangers or even a lady.

977
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:25,820
He just cannot reach women
in a sexual way right now.

978
00:57:25,821 --> 00:57:28,840
He stationed in Europe in good shape,
has a bad ass jobs,

979
00:57:28,841 --> 00:57:31,280
speaks French and is
generally charismatic guy.

980
00:57:31,790 --> 00:57:36,500
He has every reason to be doubt drowning
and ladies and can even use the foreign

981
00:57:36,501 --> 00:57:38,810
card.
But as I check in with them,

982
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:43,040
he still hasn't gotten out from
behind the 60 inch plasma TV.

983
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:46,220
I don't know what his problem is because
he would always be bitching about

984
00:57:46,221 --> 00:57:49,880
wanting a girlfriend. I think he
may be whacking it too much. Uh,

985
00:57:49,881 --> 00:57:51,740
the new echo epidemic.

986
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:55,190
And another tidbit is that he
will turn to heavy drinking,

987
00:57:55,191 --> 00:57:58,160
which actually helps to open them up.

988
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:02,720
I can tell he's not satisfied being
sick single and using alcohol,

989
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:05,210
but will not take the
initiative to break the cycle.

990
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:09,920
I'm pissed because he's not using the
golden opportunity to slay over there and

991
00:58:09,921 --> 00:58:14,210
he's just disrespecting and it's
just disrespectful to the rest of us.

992
00:58:14,211 --> 00:58:17,710
That's fucking hilarious.
Um, yeah man, he seems,

993
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:20,810
I would say that he should probably go
to therapy and work out whatever it is

994
00:58:20,811 --> 00:58:24,960
hang up is, because that could be
a lot of shit that he's sitting on

995
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:26,920
and um,

996
00:58:28,470 --> 00:58:31,410
yeah, that's sad. I feel bad for that guy.
You know what I mean? It'd be one thing,

997
00:58:31,411 --> 00:58:34,680
like some people just naturally like
the loners and asexual or whatever,

998
00:58:34,681 --> 00:58:38,880
and they don't want to be out there,
but whatever his deal is, you know,

999
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:42,090
be a sad thing. If somebody wanted to
find love and they couldn't find love,

1000
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:44,340
that guy should be crushing it.

1001
00:58:45,020 --> 00:58:49,050
If he could speak French and he can
speak English like that. France,

1002
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:51,210
that's your whole
fucking world over there.

1003
00:58:52,290 --> 00:58:54,690
Even if you went to England and they
don't give a fuck that you could speak

1004
00:58:54,691 --> 00:58:57,930
English cause so today, but if you
go, so bust out some French, Bam,

1005
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:01,260
you crushed in that.
Yes.

1006
00:59:01,530 --> 00:59:03,930
And he's a man in
uniform through this guy.

1007
00:59:03,931 --> 00:59:07,140
He's like fucking like three
different porno fantasies for women.

1008
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:08,953
Yeah,

1009
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:11,500
he's got what? What is he going
to do next? Start cleaning polls.

1010
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:16,120
Delivering pizzas. Yeah. There's no reason
for it. I would tell you buddy that he,

1011
00:59:16,121 --> 00:59:19,240
she should go talk to somebody about it,

1012
00:59:19,241 --> 00:59:22,020
but it's kind of difficult
if he's drowning himself at

1013
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:22,950
booze and a,

1014
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:27,250
it's a delicate thing and
it's very difficult to get
somebody to go get help and

1015
00:59:27,251 --> 00:59:29,470
I mean they have to want to
do it themselves. So, um,

1016
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:33,610
but you've got Fred met cause you get,
you actually give a shit. All right.

1017
00:59:33,611 --> 00:59:35,470
Conspiracy theory. Sorry,
I'm rushing through this.

1018
00:59:35,471 --> 00:59:38,260
I'm coming up on an hour
in these fucking gas line.

1019
00:59:38,261 --> 00:59:42,370
People are going to be shown up
soon. Conspiracy theory. Uh, Bill,

1020
00:59:42,371 --> 00:59:46,450
what do you think of the flat earthers
it's a growing movement of people who

1021
00:59:46,451 --> 00:59:49,570
think we're being lied to
about the shape of the earth.

1022
00:59:49,810 --> 00:59:54,580
Do you think this is something you would
have bought into in your earlier more

1023
00:59:54,581 --> 00:59:57,420
intense conspiracy days? No, I wouldn't.

1024
00:59:57,430 --> 01:00:02,410
You fucking cunt all you guys. This is
what I hate about conspiracy theory.

1025
01:00:02,411 --> 01:00:06,970
Conspiracy theory is everybody
gets lumped into the,

1026
01:00:06,971 --> 01:00:10,360
people think the moon is made out of
cheese and that they're shape shifters and

1027
01:00:10,361 --> 01:00:11,950
lizard people.
Okay.

1028
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:16,660
All I was saying is that the fucking
Federal Reserve is a privately owned

1029
01:00:16,661 --> 01:00:20,020
corporation,
which is a fucking fact.

1030
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:23,170
Okay.
I'll say things like,

1031
01:00:23,171 --> 01:00:26,770
I don't think that the government or
the corporations give a shit about the

1032
01:00:26,771 --> 01:00:30,040
people in Iraq because I saw the way
they treated these people in New Orleans.

1033
01:00:30,130 --> 01:00:31,420
They don't give a fuck about them.

1034
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:35,140
They don't give a shit about those people
over there. Okay, so I don't buy that.

1035
01:00:35,141 --> 01:00:40,030
That's, that's the level that I go to.
All right. I don't take it to this.

1036
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:43,510
This is what I would say to those
fucking flat earth people. Okay. Okay.

1037
01:00:43,511 --> 01:00:46,510
Let's just say the earth is flat then.

1038
01:00:46,511 --> 01:00:49,630
Wouldn't all the ocean waters
just run off the end of it?

1039
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:53,380
Why isn't that happening?
How do you explain that?

1040
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:57,070
I would love to talk to a flat earth
person, you know, and be like, well,

1041
01:00:57,071 --> 01:01:01,510
why don't you guys do a startup and
get yourself a little fucking rocket?

1042
01:01:01,990 --> 01:01:05,620
Go up in the fucking air. It's like,
have you ever Fuckin flown in a jet?

1043
01:01:05,621 --> 01:01:08,390
You Jackass, you can look
out the window and say, cl,

1044
01:01:08,410 --> 01:01:09,970
you'd see the roundness of the earth.

1045
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:12,473
MMM.

1046
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:17,010
I Dunno, but you know what? I want
to fucking watch videos of it.

1047
01:01:17,011 --> 01:01:21,120
I want to hear what they think flat
earthers are actually more ridiculous than

1048
01:01:21,121 --> 01:01:25,090
people trying to exclude
believe in like, uh, uh,

1049
01:01:25,110 --> 01:01:27,390
creationism or whatever.
Believe in Adam and Eve,

1050
01:01:28,830 --> 01:01:32,790
Adam and Eve to white people that somehow
created Asians and black people and

1051
01:01:32,791 --> 01:01:34,830
all that type of shit. I don't
fucking get all that. Well, actually,

1052
01:01:34,831 --> 01:01:38,190
you know something. Yeah, I dumped, you
know what I think I actually believe,

1053
01:01:38,191 --> 01:01:41,880
believe what that type of shit.
I actually think that a,

1054
01:01:41,881 --> 01:01:44,640
I watched one of those Neil degrasse
Tyson things and he said, you know,

1055
01:01:44,641 --> 01:01:48,060
we actually came out of trees
and I was just like, you know,

1056
01:01:48,061 --> 01:01:51,150
what is fucked up is that is at least
I can look at a tree. It'd be like,

1057
01:01:51,151 --> 01:01:55,110
there it is. That is a trait.
Can Walk over, I can touch it,

1058
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:59,340
I can climb on it. Um, it actually
made more sense to me then. Um,

1059
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:01,480
okay.

1060
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:06,290
Then Adam and eve, I mean it's just,
I don't know if you put like Adam,

1061
01:02:06,291 --> 01:02:09,020
if Adam and eve was a movie and
then the tooth fairy was a movie,

1062
01:02:09,021 --> 01:02:11,900
I mean I'd put them in the exact same
category and I don't think that that's

1063
01:02:11,901 --> 01:02:14,910
right. All right. Conspiracy theory. Oh,
everywhere. I've already read that one.

1064
01:02:14,930 --> 01:02:18,230
India, taking cash out of
circulation. Oh, Jesus Christ.

1065
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:23,240
Bill just read an article about India
and it freaked me out a little bit.

1066
01:02:23,241 --> 01:02:27,770
Last November, India removed 86% of
the country's cash from circulation.

1067
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:33,040
Most people are now using mobile
payment options and the artists see,

1068
01:02:34,610 --> 01:02:39,210
I don't know what that means. Also
goes on to say the article, sorry,

1069
01:02:39,211 --> 01:02:42,320
I got the laptop on the
floor, but there was a TRC. I,

1070
01:02:42,530 --> 01:02:47,530
the article also goes on to say that ATM
machines at Bank cars would be obsolete

1071
01:02:48,110 --> 01:02:49,940
as early as 2020 in India.

1072
01:02:50,180 --> 01:02:53,870
Not having physical money and only using
a phone for buying stuff really makes

1073
01:02:53,871 --> 01:02:55,450
me uncomfortable. Any thoughts? Yet?

1074
01:02:55,451 --> 01:02:59,000
They're on their way to microchipping
all of us. And once again,

1075
01:02:59,001 --> 01:03:01,300
everybody's gonna think that's fucking
crazy. You can go on the Internet,

1076
01:03:01,301 --> 01:03:04,070
you can look at shitheads who work for
corporations that are like proud of their

1077
01:03:04,071 --> 01:03:07,880
fucking microchip and their level of
security clearance that they have. No,

1078
01:03:07,881 --> 01:03:10,310
they're going to phase
out fucking everything.

1079
01:03:10,430 --> 01:03:12,200
There's going to be cameras everywhere.

1080
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:14,540
You're going to be fucking
microchipped and this is the thing,

1081
01:03:14,541 --> 01:03:19,040
it's still not going to be
enough control for them.

1082
01:03:19,041 --> 01:03:20,750
They still won't feel
comfortable that they had.

1083
01:03:20,751 --> 01:03:22,760
That's how bad their
fucking you over that.

1084
01:03:22,761 --> 01:03:25,610
They need to have that level
of fucking surveillance on you.

1085
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:29,600
That's how fucking weird they are.
And they want to see what you talk about,

1086
01:03:29,601 --> 01:03:33,440
what you jerk off to and all this
shit that fits fucking beyond creepy.

1087
01:03:33,620 --> 01:03:38,030
And I hate when something like that gets
brought up on like the fucking news and

1088
01:03:38,031 --> 01:03:41,870
all in the best the news anchor could
do is kind of widen the eyes like okay,

1089
01:03:41,871 --> 01:03:45,080
that's kind of a,
that's going to be interesting.

1090
01:03:45,950 --> 01:03:48,680
And then they immediately go to talk
to us about some fucking old lady that,

1091
01:03:48,681 --> 01:03:52,250
you know, just, you know,
made her own jam or some shit.

1092
01:03:52,310 --> 01:03:55,790
That's the feelgood story to get out of
it. No, it's unbelievably fucking creepy.

1093
01:03:56,420 --> 01:04:01,180
And um, I dunno, I have
no idea how to stop it.

1094
01:04:01,390 --> 01:04:04,480
I have no idea how to, to fucking
stop it because no matter what you do,

1095
01:04:04,481 --> 01:04:06,780
people just sit there. Like,
I watched this thing on,

1096
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:10,000
on the news and they showed
a robot talking to a little
five year old kid in the

1097
01:04:10,001 --> 01:04:13,300
robot was going like if
you put me in the closet,

1098
01:04:13,301 --> 01:04:15,040
that would make me sad.

1099
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:20,520
And like the robot is preying on the
fucking emotions of a five year old kid.

1100
01:04:21,670 --> 01:04:23,260
Like that things should be illegal.

1101
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:25,250
Okay.

1102
01:04:25,250 --> 01:04:27,280
Like, do you realize how
fucked up that I make us?

1103
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:30,170
We've always done that with products,
preying on the emotions of kids,

1104
01:04:30,171 --> 01:04:34,670
but to just see it in that level of raw
form and just sit there and having this

1105
01:04:34,671 --> 01:04:39,230
robot lying to a five year old,
like it has fucking feelings. Um,

1106
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:41,250
I don't know.

1107
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:43,890
Does it mean it was everything seemed
like it's just really sped up the we're

1108
01:04:43,910 --> 01:04:46,730
just heading right over the fucking
waterfall. That's, that's what I thinks.

1109
01:04:46,731 --> 01:04:51,080
Gonna I dunno. That's what
I believe anyways. Um, I
actually, this is my theory.

1110
01:04:51,081 --> 01:04:53,900
I believe that there's the upper 1%
and that they are going to get us all

1111
01:04:53,901 --> 01:04:57,130
microchipped and when they
get sick of that shit there,

1112
01:04:57,140 --> 01:04:59,120
they're going to dig in a sick.
The robots on us,

1113
01:04:59,121 --> 01:05:01,880
they going to take us all out and it
eventually the robots will take over the

1114
01:05:01,881 --> 01:05:05,750
upper 1% and um, and not in the way you
think. They're not going to kill him.

1115
01:05:05,751 --> 01:05:09,260
They're just going to be like all
looking like supermodels and human beings

1116
01:05:09,261 --> 01:05:10,910
won't bang each other anymore
cause it's going to be,

1117
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:13,910
it's to be way more difficult.
You know what I mean?

1118
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:17,310
Be Way more fucking difficult to banging
a real fucking human being and then

1119
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:21,930
there will just become extinct. All
right. Overrated versus underrated.

1120
01:05:22,220 --> 01:05:24,870
Overrated. Giving a shit
bill. I just turned 35,

1121
01:05:24,871 --> 01:05:29,670
six months ago and I realized how great
life can be when you start to only care

1122
01:05:29,671 --> 01:05:32,730
about shit that pertains to you.
Oh,

1123
01:05:32,950 --> 01:05:35,910
I thought that that doesn't to be like
give a shit caring about your fellow man.

1124
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:39,420
This is completely for me.
This is the other way. Um,

1125
01:05:39,510 --> 01:05:42,060
I don't care about anything anymore.

1126
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:46,680
And my friends and family say they
really enjoy my company more these days.

1127
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:50,850
I wasn't yoga or Tony Robbins.
It wasn't yoga at Tony Robins.

1128
01:05:50,851 --> 01:05:55,500
No disrespect to either of them.
It was apathy. Uh, all right.

1129
01:05:56,100 --> 01:05:59,340
Maybe that's what that fucking 32
year old virgin needs underrated.

1130
01:05:59,341 --> 01:06:00,270
Waking up early.

1131
01:06:00,271 --> 01:06:03,030
I've been waking up early for the
last two years of my life has changed

1132
01:06:03,031 --> 01:06:05,250
drastically.
Everything I talk about doing,

1133
01:06:05,251 --> 01:06:09,660
I actually do now and I'm in better
shape than ever because of that. Hey,

1134
01:06:09,661 --> 01:06:10,830
you know what?
I'll throw another one.

1135
01:06:10,831 --> 01:06:13,680
I'll throw a good fucking
underrated out there. Sausage.

1136
01:06:15,870 --> 01:06:19,170
I got this great fucking a butcher,
you know,

1137
01:06:19,171 --> 01:06:22,440
a couple of towns over and I
make the drive. I make the drive.

1138
01:06:22,441 --> 01:06:24,840
That's how good this fucking butcher is.
And when I go in there,

1139
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:28,950
no, all I ever looked at was to steaks.
I looked at the chops, you know,

1140
01:06:28,951 --> 01:06:32,970
the fucking pork chops chicken. And
occasionally I would fuck with the fish,

1141
01:06:32,971 --> 01:06:35,690
but I blew right by the sausage.
I was just, I don't know,

1142
01:06:35,710 --> 01:06:39,940
I think just never was into it. You know,
it's weird. I'll have sausage on pizza,

1143
01:06:39,941 --> 01:06:42,510
I'll have it in an Omelet,
but I never gave a fuck about it.

1144
01:06:43,770 --> 01:06:46,740
So it was on the phone with
the lovely Nia and you know,

1145
01:06:46,770 --> 01:06:49,260
we'd been going there a lot and we
were kind of running out of options.

1146
01:06:49,261 --> 01:06:52,050
We'd done all the stake shit.
We'd done the fucking pork chops.

1147
01:06:52,051 --> 01:06:54,660
I don't fuck with veal though.
There's no need.

1148
01:06:54,690 --> 01:06:56,520
There's no need to do that to an animal.
You know what I mean?

1149
01:06:56,580 --> 01:07:00,570
Just let the thing run around and give
it the old fucking right there, Fred. Um,

1150
01:07:01,170 --> 01:07:04,660
anyways, so I was just like, I dunno,
what do you want to get now? It's just,

1151
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:07,900
and I was just sort of, as I was talking
to, I looked over at the sausages, right?

1152
01:07:07,901 --> 01:07:08,630
Yeah.

1153
01:07:08,630 --> 01:07:13,160
And there was one that looked like this
fucking giant, like a black Porno Dick.

1154
01:07:13,190 --> 01:07:15,230
Right? So I look at it and
go, what the fuck is that?

1155
01:07:15,231 --> 01:07:17,990
And it said it was short ribs,
sausage with cheese.

1156
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:24,080
So I said, I go near these,
got these fucking porno,

1157
01:07:24,081 --> 01:07:28,250
Black Dick look and sausages here
that say this short rib with cheese.

1158
01:07:28,730 --> 01:07:30,920
She goes,
get those right.

1159
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:35,780
And I don't know if that sounded delicious
or just she's sick of being with me.

1160
01:07:35,990 --> 01:07:38,390
But anyways, I got two of them. Right.

1161
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:42,830
And this is really just become
some big sexual thing. No,

1162
01:07:42,831 --> 01:07:46,190
my wife did not have a threesome with
them. We actually had them for dinner. Ah.

1163
01:07:47,990 --> 01:07:51,650
So anyways, uh, we came home, cooked
those fucking things up in the skillet,

1164
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:55,940
made some pasta and a little
bit of fucking sauce for it.

1165
01:07:55,941 --> 01:07:59,960
And uh, it was fucking
delicious. And now I'm,

1166
01:08:01,130 --> 01:08:03,920
now I'm all about it. Now I'm
just thinking, once again,

1167
01:08:03,921 --> 01:08:08,510
I want to on the big green egg, I want
to learn how to fucking make a pizza,

1168
01:08:08,540 --> 01:08:10,700
right? Maybe just cheat,
get the fucking pizza dough.

1169
01:08:10,701 --> 01:08:12,050
I can make it good enough sauce.

1170
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:14,480
I get some fresh cheese and
I'll go down the street,

1171
01:08:14,980 --> 01:08:19,660
get the fucking Pono Dick fucking
sausage, right? Paula Lorena,

1172
01:08:19,690 --> 01:08:23,320
Lorena Bobbitt, chop it up. Put It on
the fucking, I'm sorry. You know what,

1173
01:08:23,321 --> 01:08:25,300
underwriting, you know,
it's difficult, underrated.

1174
01:08:25,301 --> 01:08:30,260
Trying to talk about sausage and
not going into the porn world. Um,

1175
01:08:30,980 --> 01:08:32,840
I mean, what do you want to
do? Fucking lady looking at it?

1176
01:08:32,841 --> 01:08:36,110
It's a giant fucking meat.
All right.

1177
01:08:36,111 --> 01:08:38,270
