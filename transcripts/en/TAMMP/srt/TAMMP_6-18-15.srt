1
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:07,760
Hey, how are you? It's bill
burr on a Thursday afternoon and

2
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:10,003
yeah,

3
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:15,420
I'm just checking in on your
hair on a Thursday afternoon,

4
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,830
Monday morning podcast just before
Friday just to see how your week's going.

5
00:00:19,831 --> 00:00:24,130
Quick little 30 minute, you know, just
opening the door, sticking my head in.

6
00:00:24,131 --> 00:00:25,470
See now you're doing everything okay.

7
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:29,730
Everything okay over there and your
cubicle. Maybe you drive home. Huh?

8
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,230
You got your hands 10 and two on the
fucking wheel like you supposed to.

9
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,160
Driving like a fucking nervous Nelly.
Who is,

10
00:00:38,161 --> 00:00:41,540
have you ever been comfortable in a car
when someone who had their hands 10 and

11
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,150
two on the fucking wheel or whatever,

12
00:00:44,151 --> 00:00:47,870
nine and three whatever you supposed
to do and now six 30 and fucking 1123

13
00:00:47,871 --> 00:00:49,640
whatever the latest thing is.

14
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:55,360
New Studies have shown about the way the
collarbone, Rachel's the shelter. Well,

15
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:59,180
the most affective lane and all of the
Stanley. I was actually at nine 20 say,

16
00:00:59,181 --> 00:01:02,420
shut the fuck up, right? We sit
a zillion dollars on that study.

17
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:06,830
You know not to get going about that.
Fucking James Worthy again,

18
00:01:06,831 --> 00:01:11,660
fucking driving off the road. They're
female, James Worthy, right? So, uh,

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,440
anyways, I'm out here. I am in a, I'm in
Portland, Oregon. I'm going to say, well,

20
00:01:18,441 --> 00:01:20,030
have you ever been fucking comfortable?

21
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,270
Have you ever been fucking comfortable
with so much sitting there with you when

22
00:01:23,271 --> 00:01:27,200
you're riding in a car? All that
says is I am brand new at driving,

23
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:29,150
or I am lost,

24
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:34,400
or I am currently being abducted
and being forced to drive this car.

25
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:39,520
That's what having your hands get fucking
tenant to system me as a passenger by

26
00:01:39,741 --> 00:01:42,590
see somebody up there, you know,
they fucking lean to the, you know,

27
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,300
leaning on the door,
even if it's unlocked,

28
00:01:44,301 --> 00:01:47,390
I don't give a shit that drive like two
fingers. I'm like, all right, this person,

29
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:51,980
he or she, you know, they got this.
I see somebody fucking, you know,

30
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:55,970
tended to when then you start moving your
head towards the windshield, forget it.

31
00:01:55,971 --> 00:02:00,300
It's fucking over. Um, that's
like, is that a media, you know,

32
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,830
I just have one of the greatest
cab drivers I've ever had.

33
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,820
Now being up here in Portland,
Oregon at the beginning of my, uh,

34
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,680
my tour here as fu, basically Oregon, um,

35
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:18,140
California.
Um,

36
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:23,120
it's mostly California and
Oregon, by the way. Not Oregon.

37
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:27,260
All right? They don't like that
up here. They don't like that.

38
00:02:27,261 --> 00:02:28,970
They don't like deodorant,
right?

39
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,610
They don't like not dressing like you're
on little house on the prairie is all

40
00:02:34,611 --> 00:02:36,600
kinds of things that they
don't like up here, but they,

41
00:02:36,601 --> 00:02:37,850
they liked their food fresh.

42
00:02:37,851 --> 00:02:41,180
They like to keep it weird or
whatever the hell they doing up here.

43
00:02:41,181 --> 00:02:45,500
If they're keeping it weird with a fucking
Chase Manhattan Bank right downtown.

44
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:50,300
Oh, they're keeping it weird out here
in Portland. Is that a men's warehouse?

45
00:02:50,301 --> 00:02:52,490
God, it, this place is weird.

46
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,660
Corporations will always eat your way in.
I swear to God,

47
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:01,570
everybody joined a fucking cult and left
civilization within fucking 20 minutes.

48
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,020
These corporate clients would figure it
out and they'd figured out how to get a

49
00:03:05,021 --> 00:03:09,550
fucking a cult look at best buy
in there. They disguise it, right?

50
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:15,190
They make this sign, the color, a corn
and grass sprinkled little fucking,

51
00:03:15,191 --> 00:03:18,940
you know, sprays out like Pachulia Isam,
Shit. They'd figure out how to do it.

52
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:23,170
But anyways, they had this
great, uh, cab driver, um,

53
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,490
and the way from the airport over to
the hotel, you know, he's talking,

54
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:28,390
he had a thick accent.

55
00:03:28,391 --> 00:03:32,890
So I asked him where he was from and he
was Armenian and he was from Russia. So,

56
00:03:32,891 --> 00:03:36,100
uh, I always, you know, anybody
could speak a different language. Um,

57
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,540
I'm fascinated by,

58
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:41,620
so I just start talking to the guy and
somehow we started talking about cursing

59
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,180
and our own languages and this
guy was fucking hilarious.

60
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:50,430
Like he was talking to him, he said, he's
like, oh shit, it's more, it's more like,

61
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,840
I said, how do you say, go fuck
yourself. He goes, what does the,

62
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:56,140
it's not like you say, go fuck
yourself, and he was a good America.

63
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:00,850
It's all about fuck fucking and
everything. You know, fuck you. Fuck you,

64
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,860
go fuck yourself.
What the fuck is that?

65
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:06,790
He was saying all that shit where
he says in Russia it's more like,

66
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:10,090
do I sound like Yakov Smirnoff in an Asha?
Um,

67
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:15,880
it's more, um, like they act,
they don't say go fuck yourself.

68
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,130
They say go sit on deck.

69
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:25,240
Which I like, that sounds very
rushing. Go sit on Dick. I must break.

70
00:04:25,241 --> 00:04:30,230
You have to sit on Dick. Right? Then
they have another one a instead of say,

71
00:04:30,231 --> 00:04:34,450
what the fuck is that? Their translation
is, what kind of deck is this?

72
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:38,170
Like basically, you know,
I know I'm getting fucked.

73
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:43,350
What's going down here? And they don't,
they don't call anybody a motherfucker or,

74
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,530
and they don't say, go fuck your
mother. They will say fuck his mother.

75
00:04:47,531 --> 00:04:52,420
But it basically means it's
not like saying, you know,

76
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,700
somebody goes and has sex with his mother.

77
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:59,730
What it really means is fuck his mother
for doing such a horrible job raising

78
00:04:59,771 --> 00:05:01,930
this fucking asshole that
we all have to deal with,

79
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:05,890
which I think is actually a little more
intellectual then have fuck your mother.

80
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:10,270
You know, like imagine somebody
banging your mom. I mean,

81
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:13,870
that's definitely disgusting.
But to say, fuck his mother,

82
00:05:13,871 --> 00:05:17,350
like because she did such a horrific job,
you know,

83
00:05:17,351 --> 00:05:21,430
fuck your mother for raising you.
It's such a horrible way, that net,

84
00:05:21,431 --> 00:05:23,710
we're now having this conversation
or you're doing this to me.

85
00:05:23,711 --> 00:05:26,560
I thought that was one of my
favorites that I've heard. Uh,

86
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:30,700
that was one of my
favorites. Um, so anyways,

87
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:34,540
I am up here and he had all these
fucking, he was fascinating like, well,

88
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:38,440
just to listen to him talking
like he grew up in Russia,

89
00:05:38,441 --> 00:05:43,000
so he's not into the whole
democracy thing. Like he,

90
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:45,910
I was like, well, do you think what to
free over here? And he was like, yeah,

91
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,070
I can't do his accent.

92
00:05:48,071 --> 00:05:51,970
He basically said we were too free and
that there's fucking chaos over here.

93
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,180
And he started, he goes the other day
and he's here in Portland. He goes,

94
00:05:55,181 --> 00:05:56,014
they see this,

95
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:01,380
this man 28 years old and he's dressed
like a five year old child and the 1920s,

96
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:03,921
you know,
he's like,

97
00:06:03,921 --> 00:06:07,100
this man is not a leader of this man's
not a head of a household. And I'm dying,

98
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:10,370
laughing, going, I'm going, you
mean hipsters? And he's like, yeah.

99
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,650
And he was just saying how the kid was,

100
00:06:12,651 --> 00:06:17,651
was not fit to run anything to run the
country to be in a business or when it

101
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:22,270
was the one of the funniest fucking
takes. I've heard on hipsters, you know,

102
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:24,350
not saying it was right,
but just his perception of it.

103
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:27,740
And he said that coming from where
he came from, he likes having a king.

104
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:32,390
You know that someone has the balls.
Jesus do you know,

105
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:37,400
to lead people. And he
actually liked George W. Bush.

106
00:06:37,401 --> 00:06:40,640
She said he wasn't the smartest guys,
but he had balls. He was like, fuck you,

107
00:06:40,641 --> 00:06:44,510
I'm doing this. Which I couldn't argue.
I was not a fan of George W. Bush,

108
00:06:44,511 --> 00:06:49,460
but I always had to respect the fact
that that guy did not give a shit.

109
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:53,030
He's not on. Now we're going
to do it. Getting there. We
can fight tear. It's like,

110
00:06:53,031 --> 00:06:56,030
dude, you really don't, uh, I don't know.
You don't really have an exit strategy.

111
00:06:56,031 --> 00:06:58,880
I don't give a fuck. I'm fucking
going in there. Right. Um,

112
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:00,430
okay.

113
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:00,881
But anyways,

114
00:07:00,881 --> 00:07:05,881
this guy was actually into a having a
king and all of that type of shit and that

115
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:10,020
it just, I don't know, fucking
blew my mind listening to that.

116
00:07:10,021 --> 00:07:12,040
I've never heard anybody saying,
you know what, we're to free.

117
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,930
It's really weird and I
don't want to do that.

118
00:07:13,931 --> 00:07:15,190
I probably shouldn't have said that.
He was,

119
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,960
it was actually Armenian living in Russia.

120
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:20,470
I don't want to fucking get
everybody all going again.

121
00:07:20,471 --> 00:07:23,470
You know about the whole
fucking USA Russia thing.

122
00:07:23,471 --> 00:07:27,400
Did that end than the and already
or does it start back up again?

123
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:32,150
I don't fucking know. All I know is I'm
important Portland, Oregon, and I'm,

124
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:37,630
you know, this morning I had a hole,
I had a screw up with my itinerary.

125
00:07:37,631 --> 00:07:41,560
I thought I was going to lax
at like fucking, you know,

126
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:45,700
one o'clock in the afternoon and it
turned out I was flying out of Burbank at

127
00:07:45,701 --> 00:07:47,230
nine 30.
I discovered this.

128
00:07:47,231 --> 00:07:52,231
It's 757 in the morning about ready to
do the Thursday afternoon podcast here.

129
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,230
And uh,

130
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,513
okay.

131
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,450
So I fucking,

132
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:59,210
that's why I don't have a microphone
cause I threw all my podcast shit and I

133
00:07:59,211 --> 00:08:01,910
forgot to put the microphone in.
So I apologize for the bad quality.

134
00:08:01,911 --> 00:08:04,010
I'm going to try to
stop off at a good task.

135
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:06,560
Okay.

136
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,150
And buy one. If I can find a local mom
and pop music store, I would do that.

137
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:14,720
I just tried to find one within walking
distance and it was close for good,

138
00:08:14,721 --> 00:08:18,050
it said so. But anyways, so, um,

139
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:22,910
even with that driving over to Burbank
and fucking rushing through the airport

140
00:08:22,911 --> 00:08:25,040
and everything, I'm beyond excited to, uh,

141
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:29,660
to go on this tour and it made me
Amy site, you know, then I, you know,

142
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:33,190
if you have a shit day and you're
still excited to go to work, you, you,

143
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,810
you're doing the right job I think.
Anyways, but, um, so anyways,

144
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,320
what the fuck am I rambling?
A buff.

145
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,220
Okay.

146
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,420
I Dunno.
I'm a

147
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,673
okay.

148
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:48,270
What the fuck is with my brain tape? My
brain is all over the place. What they,

149
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,400
I want to talk about Donald Trump.
There we go.

150
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:53,520
I don't have my list in front of you and
you've got a couple of subjects to keep

151
00:08:53,521 --> 00:08:55,260
me rolling here.
Um,

152
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:58,470
did you guys see Donald Trump
talking about how that he wanted to,

153
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:03,060
when he's going to run for a run for
office here, president, the United States.

154
00:09:03,061 --> 00:09:04,860
How fucking stupid was that announcement?

155
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,660
The way he drew it out like
everyone was going to be excited.

156
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,060
So I am announcing
my candidacy

157
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,180
for the president of the United States
or mistake. We got it Donald. We got it.

158
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,690
We got it. Okay, we understand. All right,

159
00:09:24,691 --> 00:09:26,820
you're going to be running
like this is like a good thing.

160
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,540
I've seen guys like
this run my entire life,

161
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:32,370
these guys who were just like,

162
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:34,860
oh I got a ton of fucking money and I'm
just going to go in there and it's like,

163
00:09:34,861 --> 00:09:36,510
no dude, you're going to get
the shit kicked out of you.

164
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,810
You're going to get the shit kicked out
of you because you're going to be going

165
00:09:39,811 --> 00:09:40,350
up a venture,

166
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:44,490
a bunch of guys Smiley's that are already
bought and paid for and those are the

167
00:09:44,491 --> 00:09:47,880
guys that are going to get in.
But just listening to him talk,

168
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:53,130
like he went on the O'Reilly factor
and Bill O'reilly's going like,

169
00:09:53,131 --> 00:09:54,900
how are you going to stop isis?

170
00:09:54,901 --> 00:09:57,660
Which of course is always the
big question in this country.

171
00:09:57,661 --> 00:09:59,040
How are we going to stop isis?

172
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:03,030
Fuck these people that you know are
fucking with our food supply right here in

173
00:10:03,031 --> 00:10:06,930
the United States. Fuck these people that
are, you know, want a private taze wider.

174
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,060
Yeah.
Those guys aren't that big a threat.

175
00:10:09,061 --> 00:10:11,310
Let's go after these clients
all the way over here, right.

176
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:16,320
That are bankrupting us. So anyways,
sorry for the politics. So right.

177
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,360
This is just my own ignorant
point of view. All right.

178
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,730
And I finally found someone
of some dumber than me,

179
00:10:20,731 --> 00:10:22,950
which is fucking Donald Trump.
So they ask him was, he goes,

180
00:10:22,951 --> 00:10:26,530
so how are you going to get him? He goes,
I would hit them so hard. It would egos.

181
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,840
I would find the right general,

182
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:31,530
I would find my patent or Eisenhower
and I would hit them so hard.

183
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:35,730
It would make your head spin. Right. He
just sounds like somebody at a bar. Like,

184
00:10:35,731 --> 00:10:39,780
I hope he hangs in there long enough or
get a good six months side of this shit.

185
00:10:39,781 --> 00:10:42,990
Right? And they, so bill
O'Reilly's going like,

186
00:10:42,991 --> 00:10:46,770
so you're going to send in ground troops
and he, is that what you're telling me?

187
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,870
And Donald Goes, I'm not going
to tell you what I'm going to do.

188
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,280
I got to keep it a secret.
Right. Which I'm like, Eh,

189
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:56,500
it wasn't a bad answer and
that he, O'Reilly keeps
pressing him. He goes, so eat.

190
00:10:56,501 --> 00:10:59,400
So you're going to, but some point you'd
have to send in ground troops, right?

191
00:10:59,401 --> 00:11:03,270
You will be sending in ground troops
and it finally just caves. He goes, no,

192
00:11:03,271 --> 00:11:05,490
I wouldn't. And then a writer was
like, well, what would you do? He goes,

193
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:06,870
I bombed the hell out of him.

194
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:14,460
I got to tell you something.
Once again,

195
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:19,020
Donald Trump has proven that you have
to be literally out of your fucking mind

196
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,850
to either want to be president,
run for president,

197
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:27,400
anything at all for him to just
so just casually, just Sam,

198
00:11:27,401 --> 00:11:30,420
I'm going to bomb the hell out of them.
You know?

199
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:33,420
I would think that that would be like,

200
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,150
even if you knew that that's
what she had to do, that,

201
00:11:36,151 --> 00:11:40,500
that that's a hell of a fucking
thing to have to say. You know,

202
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:41,550
cause you know,

203
00:11:41,551 --> 00:11:44,610
not all of those bombs are going to
land on the people you're trying to hit

204
00:11:44,611 --> 00:11:47,400
someone we're going to land on some
mother feeding a baby in the end that's

205
00:11:47,401 --> 00:11:50,760
going to be on your conscience
for the rest of your fucking life,

206
00:11:50,761 --> 00:11:55,450
even if it was the right thing to fucking
do. So you, you try to like, I dunno,

207
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:00,250
I guess choose your words more carefully
or maybe it's refreshing that he just

208
00:12:00,251 --> 00:12:01,960
had bombed the hell out of him.
You know,

209
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:05,320
he should literally just been stuff on
a sandwich in his fucking mouth as he's

210
00:12:05,321 --> 00:12:09,520
taught, not Fucko. I kick the shit out of
him. I didn't really know fucking balls,

211
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:14,630
just speaking in like, just
total generality. I mean,

212
00:12:14,631 --> 00:12:17,170
he sounded like he was doing a podcast.
He didn't, you know, he sounded like me.

213
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:18,963
MMM.

214
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,990
I Dunno. But you know, he did all
right in the hair plug department.

215
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,300
Remember when he was doing that?

216
00:12:23,301 --> 00:12:28,301
Psycho fucking flock of sea gulls comb
over that he was doing that thing has

217
00:12:28,551 --> 00:12:32,540
disappeared. Let's give it up to
the people who make hair plugs.

218
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:36,610
They're really doing a hell of a job.
You know, they started off horrifically

219
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:38,543
mmm.

220
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,210
Or whatever. The hair transplant. I
think Elton John got like the first one.

221
00:12:42,211 --> 00:12:46,470
He's been wearing wigs ever since. Like
his top of his head looked like Bobby.

222
00:12:46,471 --> 00:12:50,730
Yours. Nice. By the time they
were done with it. And um,

223
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:53,360
so now you said the where that
little pageboy haircut. Yeah.

224
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,330
For the rest of the time,
you know, poor fella,

225
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:00,060
all he wanted was hair.
You know,

226
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,680
now he's got to have that little
little fucking, yeah, we're gone.

227
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:07,630
Just goes a little stubby fucking
fingers trying to reach those keys.

228
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,410
Got a little fat,
you know.

229
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:16,150
So a lot to feel bad about when you
look it out. John, poor guy, you know,

230
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:19,550
they're a little too much coke,
right?

231
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,250
One on one on MTV unplugged,

232
00:13:22,251 --> 00:13:25,510
a little coked up in a very
unfortunate fucking a running suit.

233
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,400
Why am I talking about him? Oh,
let's get back to Donald Trump case.

234
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:33,170
So the 90s right.
Then they went with the fucking ant leg.

235
00:13:33,171 --> 00:13:37,160
Once you remember though at the insect
like ones where you just couldn't stop

236
00:13:37,161 --> 00:13:40,250
looking at it, it was literally
like sewn into your fucking head.

237
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,200
People used to call it doll hair.

238
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:43,993
MMM.

239
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,800
And now they've gotten to the
point where they just sort of,

240
00:13:47,801 --> 00:13:50,650
they sort of sprinkle it in.
I think they take it off the back,

241
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:55,300
the vacuum mount out of the back and then
they put it on a tray and then like a

242
00:13:55,301 --> 00:14:00,301
fairy comes by and just takes the tray
and skips around your head going Chareau

243
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:04,450
la La. And they drop it in and
it looks very natural evidently.

244
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,580
But then what happens is,

245
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:11,530
is those ones I guess can survive whatever
hell is going on beneath the scalp.

246
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:14,740
But the other ones that weren't
built for it, they still fall out.

247
00:14:14,741 --> 00:14:17,110
So then you got it. You got to think
you've got to get receipted again.

248
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,183
I Dunno,

249
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,970
I'm still holding out for
the fucking pill until then.

250
00:14:21,971 --> 00:14:24,760
I'm going to keep buzzing my head.
That'd be fucking hilarious.

251
00:14:24,761 --> 00:14:26,680
It's like eight years.
They come out with a pill,

252
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,310
right to cure baldness and
all of a sudden guys like me,

253
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,410
we come back from for the fucking Mr
Clean look to come back looking like we're

254
00:14:35,411 --> 00:14:36,460
in the bgs.
Right.

255
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,040
Ah,
that'd be fucking hilarious.

256
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:45,320
I would actually be willing
to take the risk on that one,

257
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:48,830
which is really fucked up cause you
know that it would do some sort of

258
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:53,780
unbelievable damage to your liver. There's
no, there's no fucking way. I mean,

259
00:14:53,781 --> 00:14:58,390
you fucker with Mother Nature,
aren't you? I mean you can't.

260
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,180
That's the fucked up thing about plastic
surgery and everything is your really,

261
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,830
your, your face, your
hairline becomes a lie.

262
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:11,240
You know, if you're young enough,
especially, you know what I mean?

263
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,870
And people looking at you like,
and they are attracted to who you aren't.

264
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:16,723
You don't what I mean?

265
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,420
Like what if it's the nose that just gets
the person go and then that's not your

266
00:15:20,421 --> 00:15:23,810
real nose. Then you bang and
you have a kid. You're like,

267
00:15:23,811 --> 00:15:27,770
what the fuck happened to that kid's nose?
Did you cheat on me?

268
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:30,080
Hey [inaudible] your fucking whore.

269
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:33,950
And then she takes out a fucking
high school year book was like, no,

270
00:15:33,951 --> 00:15:36,910
this is what I really look like.
You know?

271
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:39,980
And every time your kid starts walking
towards you, what? That's crooked nose.

272
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:44,720
You can be thinking like fucking
bitch lied to me, you know,

273
00:15:44,721 --> 00:15:46,970
which will affect your child rearing.

274
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:52,590
One of the weirdest fucking words
ever. It's just, I don't know.

275
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,730
Was that before they realize
that pedophiles existed,

276
00:15:55,731 --> 00:16:00,170
that somebody came up with a, what's a
good word for raising your child? I Dunno.

277
00:16:00,171 --> 00:16:04,220
Rearing. Um, anyways. Oh,

278
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,460
in the world of Sports,
Sports, Sports, sports, sport,

279
00:16:07,461 --> 00:16:12,461
congratulations to the
Chicago Blackhawks and the,

280
00:16:12,501 --> 00:16:14,540
uh,
golden state or Sacramento is,

281
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:18,110
I call them golden state
warriors on their championships.

282
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:20,900
A opposite things. There. One

283
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:27,210
was a so called dynasty, which
it isn't, which it isn't.

284
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:31,030
All right. And then the other was the, uh,

285
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,770
a team that hadn't won in like a 37 years.
Is that what they said?

286
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,020
I should know this
Celtics one in 74 and 76.

287
00:16:40,021 --> 00:16:44,970
So the warriors one in 75, 40
fucking years. 41 seasons maybe.

288
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,080
Is that what it, is that how it works
out? I don't fucking know. Um, oh,

289
00:16:49,081 --> 00:16:52,700
basketballs hard. By the
way. 74 was the Celtics.

290
00:16:52,701 --> 00:16:55,650
75 was a warrior is 76 was a Celtics.

291
00:16:56,430 --> 00:17:00,570
77 was Portland.
78 was the bullets.

292
00:17:00,571 --> 00:17:05,571
79 was Seattle supersonics
with the young Dennis Johnson.

293
00:17:07,321 --> 00:17:12,300
Rest his soul. 1980 was the
Lakers. 81 was the Celtics. 82

294
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:16,160
it was the Lakers.

295
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:21,380
83 was the 70 sixers.
84 was the Celtics.

296
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:26,000
85 was the Lakers. All that when killed
when Kareem sank that Skyhawk any,

297
00:17:26,001 --> 00:17:28,330
any fucking,
you know,

298
00:17:28,331 --> 00:17:31,970
he did that double fist thing as he was
running down the court and they were

299
00:17:31,971 --> 00:17:35,690
going to beat the Celtics and there and
they were going to drink champagne in

300
00:17:35,691 --> 00:17:39,530
the Boston garden, which had never been
done. Uh Oh my God, that was brutal.

301
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:44,300
86 was a Celtics.
87 80 it was the Lakers ain't no weight.

302
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,590
87 was Lakers.

303
00:17:45,591 --> 00:17:50,040
Then it went back to back and then Detroit
went back to back and then it was the

304
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:52,400
Michael Jordan shelf for three
years and then Houston for two.

305
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:57,410
Then Jordan for three and then the
spurs and I think fucking Lakers,

306
00:17:58,021 --> 00:18:01,590
one three. I don't fucking remember.
Anyways, sorry. Got sidetracked there.

307
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:05,790
By the way, Black Hawks, you don't
have a fucking dynasty. Okay.

308
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:11,730
How much more lax or are we going
to get with the term dynasty?

309
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:16,350
When I was a kid, when I was a lad,
when I had a full eto, orange hair,

310
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:22,110
um, a dynasty was winning three
in a row. The early seventies.

311
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:26,790
Oakland ace was a dynasty,
the late seventies,

312
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:28,620
Montreal Canadians,

313
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:33,030
the early eighties
islanders was a dynasty.

314
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:36,780
All right. I'm trying to
think. Nobody is ever,

315
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:41,010
but the Steelers when in four and six
years, that was considered a dynasty too.

316
00:18:41,011 --> 00:18:44,580
So I dunno then I'm remember when the
Patriots won that we won three and four

317
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,200
years and people will go,
well,

318
00:18:46,201 --> 00:18:49,110
it's a dynasty because of the
salary cap and the boob tube.

319
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,090
And I still didn't buy into that,
but,

320
00:18:52,091 --> 00:18:55,770
and so then three and four years became
a dynasty when you had to win three in a

321
00:18:55,771 --> 00:18:59,550
row or four at a six to now,
just three and four.

322
00:18:59,551 --> 00:19:03,480
And now 10 years after that.
Now if you win three and six years,

323
00:19:03,481 --> 00:19:07,740
you're considered a dynasty,
which is so fucking stupid.

324
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:11,340
All right?
And I'll tell you why,

325
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:15,450
because the kings have one two times.

326
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,510
So they want to,
when the Black Hawks have three,

327
00:19:18,511 --> 00:19:23,400
I mean the dynasty is you have 1:00 AM
all three years in a row and everybody

328
00:19:23,401 --> 00:19:27,510
else has got a fucking goose egg.
That's how I look at it.

329
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:32,730
All right? I'm just a freckled old
man here though. I still believe that.

330
00:19:32,731 --> 00:19:34,450
I'm not trying to take anything
away from the Blackhawks,

331
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:38,340
what they've done with the free agency
and all that, you know, without a doubt.

332
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:40,230
It's fucking amazing.
And I love the Blackhawks,

333
00:19:40,231 --> 00:19:41,820
even though they fucking crushed me.

334
00:19:41,821 --> 00:19:45,090
If he'd couple of years ago when they
beat the Bruins. All right? But you know,

335
00:19:45,091 --> 00:19:47,230
come on, three and six fucking
years. Why don't you just, what?

336
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:50,670
When we get to the point of, hey, you're
one three, that's a fucking dynasty.

337
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,070
It isn't not a dynasty.
All right?

338
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,820
You got something going
on called you got to,

339
00:19:57,821 --> 00:20:01,380
you got a horrible case of
the every others. All right?

340
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:07,290
You want it in 2010 on Oh yeah.
Every others is the giants.

341
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:12,810
Baseball giants. They wanted 10 12
and 14 isn't that what they did?

342
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:16,230
Yeah, they got a horrible case
of the every others. All right.

343
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:20,940
Which can only be cured by when in fucking
three in a row and shutting jackasses

344
00:20:20,941 --> 00:20:24,150
like me. Right. The fuck up.
All right. But I don't think,

345
00:20:24,151 --> 00:20:25,860
I don't think three and
six years as a dynasty,

346
00:20:25,861 --> 00:20:28,800
even with free agency and all of
that fucking horse shit. I don't,

347
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:30,330
I think he got to win.

348
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:35,370
You got to win three in a row or we'll
give you the asterix three and four years.

349
00:20:35,371 --> 00:20:38,220
Or if he won four and six years, like
the Steelers, I'll give it to you,

350
00:20:38,221 --> 00:20:42,390
but three and six years when someone
else want to like now what happens if the

351
00:20:42,391 --> 00:20:46,530
fucking kings when it next year
and then they want three, right.

352
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,540
And then is it overlapping dynasties

353
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:51,630
that occurred at the same fucking time?
You see what I'm saying?

354
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,400
This is like that movie faceoff well
you don't know who's nick cage and who's

355
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:58,860
John Travolta at that point.
You can't have that. All right.

356
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,440
And who else want during that time?
The fucking Bro. That's right.

357
00:21:04,441 --> 00:21:06,810
The Boston Bruins won a Stanley Cup.

358
00:21:06,811 --> 00:21:08,820
You know what I love about
them winning the Stanley Cup?

359
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:13,010
Is everyone in Boston just about except
for newborn babies knows what it's feel.

360
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:17,820
Feels like. Dab your team, win
a Stanley Cup in. Meanwhile,

361
00:21:17,821 --> 00:21:21,240
up in Montreal,
despite all of this success,

362
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:25,800
there's an entire generation and a half
has no fucking idea what that's like and

363
00:21:25,801 --> 00:21:29,430
that I swear to God
makes me smile every day.

364
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:33,630
Um, I'm fucking with you. Montreal.

365
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,810
He a bunch of sensitive conch.
All right.

366
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:39,720
I like your language and I'm
going to learn how to fucking,

367
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:43,800
I'm gonna go and do a lingo. Maybe I'll
fuck with that over the next couple,

368
00:21:43,801 --> 00:21:48,240
a couple of hours before my show up
here in Portland, Oregon. Jesus. Bill,

369
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,650
can you tell us a little bit more
about your tour? Well, I would love to,

370
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:56,250
after I read out loud with these,
with the following message,

371
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:59,730
this fucking Internet would work.
Here we go. All right. All right.

372
00:21:59,731 --> 00:22:03,990
Right out of the bat. This sounds
fucking creepy to me. Video Doorbell.

373
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:08,970
Uh, we'll insert dinging
sound. What does that mean?

374
00:22:08,971 --> 00:22:13,410
I was supposed to fucking insert ding.
Dongs. All right, let's do it again. Uh,

375
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:18,660
I can do this. Here we go. Doorbell.

376
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,030
Yeah.

377
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,710
Sound.

378
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,140
This is like Donald Trump announcing
he's running for president doorbell.

379
00:22:28,141 --> 00:22:32,570
Sound effect. Did you meet
doorbell? All one word.

380
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:36,860
Of course I did.
I'll see if I can do this correctly.

381
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:41,750
All right. Hey everybody. Video Doorbell.

382
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:47,780
Let's do that again. Oh, I'm at and all
kinds of layers to the podcast here.

383
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:52,220
Hang on a second. It's got a
fucking, uh, it's gotta reload here.

384
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:57,370
Hey everybody. I'd like to take a
little bit of time to talk about, yeah,

385
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:02,770
video doorbell. What is really
odd? I was the shit video doorbell.

386
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:06,850
This is the sound of a package
being delivered or friends
coming over for dinner.

387
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:11,440
But it's also the sound of summing plants.
Someone planning to rob you blind.

388
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:15,500
Jesus Christ.
I took a left turn then it over 90,

389
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:20,530
95% of home breakins happened
during the day and I write the way.

390
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:25,230
Is it, what's going on here? Oh,

391
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:28,440
I think I'm stuck in one of those youtube
loops where they just keep playing the

392
00:23:28,441 --> 00:23:31,710
fucking the doorbell. Well, I
think it works with the copy.

393
00:23:31,711 --> 00:23:33,390
I'm going to keep it anyways,

394
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:37,470
and burglars always almost always
start by ringing the doorbell to see if

395
00:23:37,471 --> 00:23:39,810
someone's home before
pillaging your possessions.

396
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,790
I guess that's a fancier doorbell.
Yeah.

397
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:46,080
I like this

398
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,970
music too with ring video doorbell.
You can see and talk to anyone

399
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:58,590
from anywhere in the world
using your smartphone. Hi,

400
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:05,460
I'm bill per, what's happening?
It's just a DJ party.

401
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:08,523
MMM,

402
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:11,780
okay.
I think we're having a fire alert here.

403
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:19,060
Back to the copy rings.
Advanced motion detection alerts you,

404
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:24,650
even if someone doesn't ring the doorbell,
it's like a caller id for your home.

405
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:25,671
You know,

406
00:24:25,671 --> 00:24:29,870
millions of people suffer every year
and they don't have a video doorbell.

407
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:34,800
Please share a personal story how this
could help you or someone you love. Hey,

408
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:38,450
will you share a pocket person's story?
You content isn't enough.

409
00:24:38,451 --> 00:24:42,950
I'm reading your copy. I
don't know anybody who has a
video of fucking doorbells.

410
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:46,940
How does that work for you? Then
she's story. You look at another one,

411
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:51,920
I'm sorry.
It's sealing.

412
00:24:51,921 --> 00:24:56,921
Ring takes minutes and it works with
either your current wiring built in

413
00:24:58,251 --> 00:24:59,270
rechargeable battery.

414
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:03,620
Put your mind at ease and
protect your home and your Perry.

415
00:25:03,621 --> 00:25:08,621
Keep with the video doorbell Time magazine
named one of the top 10 gadgets of

416
00:25:10,341 --> 00:25:15,341
2014 Sheridan Kilmore porpoises cause
then eventually you'd have to throw out

417
00:25:15,591 --> 00:25:18,260
the wires and they will
end up in the ocean.

418
00:25:18,261 --> 00:25:23,261
The right now my listeners get the
ring video doorbell for only $174.

419
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:30,140
That's $25 off the normal price. Still
kind of expensive though. You know,

420
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:34,790
door fucking house comes with
the doorbell already attached.

421
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,700
He's still making payments.

Once again,

424
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:53,600
that's [inaudible] dot com slash

425
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:59,600
oh and it fades out the music,
Jesus Christ. That could be a DJ,

426
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,880
but a fucking mouse had on
me and see what happens.

427
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:07,140
I'll tell you what will happen, Huh?
Bunch of drugs will be taken. Um,

428
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,490
how much can I freak out
people that one of those rapes,

429
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:13,580
if you just had the DJ and he's clean,
all this mellow shit,

430
00:26:13,581 --> 00:26:16,940
then all of a sudden out of nowhere I
just started coming out with a mouse head

431
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,520
screaming Khan to over and over again.

432
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,200
Okay.

433
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,410
I would love to have an
overhead shot of that, you know,

434
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:25,630
maybe using one of those drones and just
watching them all scatter like fucking

435
00:26:25,631 --> 00:26:29,110
roaches all across the desert.
Stepping on side.

436
00:26:29,111 --> 00:26:32,590
Winders um,
anyways,

437
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:37,010
what else did I want to
talk about? Oh, an ant,

438
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:40,960
ant man, Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam.

439
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,920
I got my truck back.
Yeah,

440
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:48,360
I got my fucking truck back. Sorry.
Sorry for the big intro there. Um,

441
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:49,591
my truck a,

442
00:26:49,591 --> 00:26:52,950
I had some fucking issues with it and
I finally just decided to have him pull

443
00:26:52,951 --> 00:26:56,880
the engine and Redo the whole fucking
thing. It runs on unleaded gas.

444
00:26:56,881 --> 00:26:59,850
I don't have to do any additive anymore
and it's running a fucking like a

445
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:03,960
bastard. You in Boston there, it's
running fucking strong as shit.

446
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:08,340
And um, we ordered the air
conditioning and the power steering.

447
00:27:08,341 --> 00:27:11,640
It's going to be my fucking daily
driver because right now I don't know if

448
00:27:11,641 --> 00:27:14,610
you've ever fucking tried to turn the
wheel when there's no power steering,

449
00:27:14,611 --> 00:27:17,310
you do that.
And like a fucking 83 toilets herself,

450
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:21,370
which is the last one I ever drove
that didn't have power steering. Um,

451
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:23,460
that's a bitch.
This fucking f 100.

452
00:27:23,461 --> 00:27:27,120
I'm literally out of breath and when I
try to parallel park and then the anxiety,

453
00:27:27,121 --> 00:27:30,300
you have somebody behind me,
it takes like fucking,

454
00:27:30,301 --> 00:27:33,780
I swear to God it takes me like seven
minutes to park the fucking thing. So, um,

455
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,210
I was going to be one of those
purists where I was like,

456
00:27:36,211 --> 00:27:40,800
I'm going to keep it the way it was when
it rolled off the assembly line in 1968

457
00:27:40,801 --> 00:27:43,920
and then I just realized like, you know
what? It was meant to be on a farm.

458
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:48,960
It's now in Los Angeles. Okay.
I already added, um, you know,

459
00:27:48,961 --> 00:27:52,560
put some disc brakes on the front.
I am a guide and make this thing safe.

460
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:53,940
I fucking love it though,
man.

461
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:56,670
I got to tell you the
suspension that was fucked up.

462
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,620
You go over a bump on that thing, you
know, it's like, it just starts rocking.

463
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,890
And you know, if you don't have your seat
belt on, you literally hit your head.

464
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:07,000
And I was talking to,
um,

465
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:12,140
the guy worked on my truck about possibly
putting in an updated suspension and

466
00:28:12,181 --> 00:28:15,160
he was saying, well, I'd have to lower
it like two or three inches. And I, I,

467
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:19,610
I fucking hate that man. I don't like
those trucks that are lower down, man. I,

468
00:28:19,611 --> 00:28:23,790
I like, I like it that it rides up
a little high. Um, so I'm willing,

469
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,390
I only have three gears on in any way.
So how fast am I going to be driving?

470
00:28:27,391 --> 00:28:32,310
So I think, um, I think
I'm done messing with it,

471
00:28:32,311 --> 00:28:36,030
but, uh, I got a couple more
things I have to get done on it.

472
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,770
I don't have my direction most right now,

473
00:28:37,771 --> 00:28:39,810
but once I get the power steering
and then the air conditioning,

474
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:45,170
I think gold daddy is going to move on
to trying to find a 65 galaxy that's a,

475
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:49,050
got a straight body and everything
else is fucked up on it. And, uh,

476
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:53,430
and I'm actually going to get that
thing with automatic transmission.

477
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:57,390
I was thinking about
having a, a, a stick in it.

478
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,960
I've always liked driving a standard.
I just think it's cool man.

479
00:29:00,961 --> 00:29:04,260
You feel like you're driving
the fucking car, you know?

480
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:05,900
Okay.

481
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:09,260
I Dunno. I'm just sad, grumpy go. I'm
not dumb. Just like grumpy old man.

482
00:29:09,261 --> 00:29:11,090
Like now the cars are
going to drive themselves.

483
00:29:11,091 --> 00:29:15,680
It's like why the fuck would you want
to do that? And then you know what?

484
00:29:15,681 --> 00:29:16,520
You don't,
what's going to happen?

485
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:19,610
Everybody's going to be on their
fucking iPhones and reading and stuff.

486
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:23,450
And Are you going to see going down the
street is people hanging their heads out

487
00:29:23,451 --> 00:29:27,260
of these cars in the drive to they're
not driving puking out decide cause

488
00:29:27,261 --> 00:29:28,520
everybody's car sick.

489
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:32,750
That'll be the next thing that
somebody will sell for 1995.

490
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:35,150
It will be like these fucking,
you know,

491
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:40,610
one size fits all curtains that you
can fucking wrap all the way around the

492
00:29:40,611 --> 00:29:44,540
inside your car so you can read while
it's driving and not get sick or fucking

493
00:29:44,541 --> 00:29:47,210
jerk off of our have sex with somebody.

494
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:50,810
Right. What the fuck do you
care? You know what I mean?

495
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:54,240
You know what's funny about that is the,

496
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:59,300
the liability that the automakers
will somehow get off of themselves.

497
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:02,610
It'll somehow still be your fucking fault.

498
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:06,330
And the insurance companies still won't
pay you when the car that was supposed

499
00:30:06,331 --> 00:30:10,110
to drive by itself just stops working.
Dude.

500
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:13,260
How many times a week does your,
does your laptop crash?

501
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:18,050
How good are these computers are going
to be that I'm just going to just get in

502
00:30:18,051 --> 00:30:22,580
this fucking thing that has no
conductor, no pilot, no nothing.

503
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:24,350
I'm just sitting in this fucking thing.

504
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:30,130
The cars going 40 miles an hour and
so's my brain in my skull physics.

505
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:35,090
It's going as fast as the car and
when the car smashes into the tree,

506
00:30:35,091 --> 00:30:38,060
that's what my brain does to the
front of my skull and goes back again.

507
00:30:38,061 --> 00:30:42,190
And then what happens? Huh? What
happens? Like a good neighbor?

508
00:30:42,191 --> 00:30:45,650
I go fuck yourself. That's what, that's
what the insurance covers companies

509
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:50,250
will do. Um, I'm not into
that at all, man. I am into,

510
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:53,930
my phone is ringing here.
The fuck is this. Well,

511
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:58,330
I don't know who that is because you don't
have a phone. No Id. I don't pick up.

512
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,070
Um, I'm actually bullshit and
I'll pick it up after this. Uh,

513
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:05,410
what's this podcast is
over. So anyways, um,

514
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,730
I'm so fucking excited to
do this guide down tour.

515
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:12,040
I'm going to so many cities
that have never been to before.

516
00:31:12,041 --> 00:31:14,530
I've been to Portland
before a bunch of times.

517
00:31:14,531 --> 00:31:17,990
Actually back in the day I
used to work Harvey's um,

518
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:21,760
comedy club and a, and the last
time I was here I worked helium.

519
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:26,560
Um, I did a bunch of colleges up
here before he used to do cuse bay,

520
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:29,950
like every other year I
would go down there, um,

521
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:32,950
and after I do Portland and I just,

522
00:31:32,951 --> 00:31:36,490
I just blow all the way through fucking
California and all these places.

523
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:40,530
I never been to Sacramento. I've been
there before. I'm there on the 19th,

524
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:42,460
and I go to Reno,
which had been there before.

525
00:31:42,461 --> 00:31:46,120
I'm going to go to bizarre
guitar and gunshop. Um,

526
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:48,790
and then I'm back to California
and I play Santa Rosa.

527
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:52,480
Never been there doing two shows there.
And according to the people,

528
00:31:52,481 --> 00:31:56,080
that's the last place George
Carlin performed at before.

529
00:31:56,081 --> 00:32:00,510
Unfortunately he passed away. Well I'm
doing one show, sorry, one show that um,

530
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:04,390
on June 21st, so that's going
to be a, an unbelievable night.

531
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:07,210
Then on the 20 seconds I'm in San Jose.

532
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:11,630
Then when Fresno never been to
Fresno at the Warners theater though,

533
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:15,070
I said the warriors theater, I was like
that, that's a cool fucking name. Uh,

534
00:32:15,071 --> 00:32:18,790
then I'm in Bakersfield. Never
been there. I've driven through it.

535
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,370
He stopped and got gas,
never fucking hung out there.

536
00:32:21,371 --> 00:32:25,150
And then I'm in a Highland
California on the 25th for two shows,

537
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:28,450
Denim in Vegas at the Mirage.
And then I'm in Tucson.

538
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,810
I mean it's just going to be a fucking
awesome talk at a really bad ass poster.

539
00:32:31,811 --> 00:32:34,750
Once again, kind of making
fun of the drought out here.

540
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:39,720
I too actually retweeted
a copy of it. Um, and,

541
00:32:39,721 --> 00:32:41,850
um,
I'm just really looking forward to this,

542
00:32:41,851 --> 00:32:46,680
getting this fucking hour up to speed so
I can murder with it, you know, cause, uh,

543
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:50,870
this time last year I, I taped, uh,
I'm sorry you feel that way. So Marty,

544
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,130
uh,
the clock is ticking.

545
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:57,270
Sometime next year I will
tape another special and um,

546
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:01,230
it's what I plan on doing for
the rest of my career because a,

547
00:33:01,231 --> 00:33:05,010
I don't know why I still love
doing this shit 23 years in.

548
00:33:05,011 --> 00:33:08,040
I should not be excited to be
going to Fresno and Bakersfield,

549
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:12,480
but I am because I've traveled enough to
know that I'm going to meet some people

550
00:33:12,481 --> 00:33:14,490
out there and they're going
to tell me some places to eat,

551
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,830
like people make fun of
Reno and then you go there.

552
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:20,520
And that bizarre guitar and gunshot
thing just fucking blew me away.

553
00:33:20,521 --> 00:33:23,910
And that's only one thing that I saw
there. And then I drove over to the,

554
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:26,580
what's that fucking lakes
that's over there? You know,

555
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:29,250
where Michael Coler Corleone
had frayed a whacked,

556
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:34,290
I went over there and got a great burger.
Was it Lake Tahoe?

557
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:39,270
Um, I'm really fascinated with
that part of the country and, um,

558
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:42,630
I know that I said I was going to do
Eureka in and end up falling through,

559
00:33:42,631 --> 00:33:44,250
but I'm definitely going to come back up.

560
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:49,380
I might even just come up for the day
and fly my lovely wife up. And um,

561
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:51,990
then I was thinking and drive him back
down, checking out the redwood forest,

562
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:56,580
going to maybe wine country is some
shit like that. Um, but uh, you know,

563
00:33:56,581 --> 00:34:00,540
it's a beautiful state.
Fortunately there's not a lot
of water out here, but uh,

564
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:03,600
you know, who knows, it
might fall into the ocean.

565
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,020
One day I might be on the road and I
won't die with the state and I can tell

566
00:34:07,021 --> 00:34:07,980
people when I got older,

567
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:13,250
I remember I tore down whole stack
and kids will sit there wide eyed is,

568
00:34:13,831 --> 00:34:18,780
I described places like Fresno
and San Jose, Sacramento, right.

569
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:23,160
Taking all of them for granted.
I could tell him that I went there,

570
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:28,720
I went there and I went
to the FDF fucking uh, uh,

571
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:33,510
what is that fucking Mexican restaurant
at a Mcdonald's zones. You know,

572
00:34:33,511 --> 00:34:34,730
they got the burrito bowls,

573
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,710
so was trying to pick something mainstream
and not do the usual Wendy's and

574
00:34:37,711 --> 00:34:40,660
Mcdonald's.
I Love Mcdonald's is now freaking out.

575
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:43,380
If they're actually using
real meat. It's like, really,

576
00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:47,760
what the fuck were you using before?
They'll never answer that question. Um,

577
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:51,060
all right. This was the Thursday
afternoon podcast just before Monday,

578
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:54,300
just before Friday. Sorry,
the judge [inaudible] podcast.

579
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,850
I want to thank all you
guys for listening. Um,

580
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,300
there's gonna be another 30 minutes here.

581
00:34:58,301 --> 00:35:02,220
It's some throwbacks to some classic
Horse Shit that I talked way back in the

582
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:06,820
day. Um, thank you to everybody before
even do this tour. Everybody who shows up,

583
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:11,500
um, I can't fucking wait and I'm, and
I'm working with Joe Barton. Nick,

584
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:14,620
I never did a bus tour
with Joe Voir. Nick, um,

585
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:17,350
one of my favorite
people on stage and off.

586
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,930
We're going to have a
great time and a hey,

587
00:35:19,931 --> 00:35:22,000
as weak as we roll through
your cities and stuff,

588
00:35:22,001 --> 00:35:24,250
let us know some cool places
to get dinner or lunch,

589
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:28,660
a good place to go grab a drink
or something. Um, or whatever.

590
00:35:28,661 --> 00:35:33,370
If you've got something weird that we
got to go see, like I know in Tucson,

591
00:35:33,371 --> 00:35:36,580
Arizona, I want to visit
that, that, that, uh,

592
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:41,200
airplane graveyard that they have.
I got a fucking hit that,

593
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,290
um,
I want to see some crazy shit like that.

594
00:35:44,291 --> 00:35:47,830
I don't want to go to some fucking malls
or Cineplex horseshit that I can do in

595
00:35:47,831 --> 00:35:50,740
my own town. So tell me something
unique, something fucking weird.

596
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:54,820
If you know a bartender with the fucked
up by or a weird way of clearing his

597
00:35:54,821 --> 00:35:57,280
throat, just something
unique about where you live,

598
00:35:57,310 --> 00:36:00,130
please let us know and we'll try to hit
as many as we can. All right. That's it.

599
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:05,020
Have a great weekend. And uh, that's it.
Yeah. Have a good weekend. Your constant,

600
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:05,883
let's see.

601
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:26,420
I'll get some advice.
Somebody wants a bill.

602
00:36:26,421 --> 00:36:30,470
My girlfriend looks like a
centerfold. Good for you. She's blind.

603
00:36:30,471 --> 00:36:34,840
She has a beautiful face,
a tiny waist and giant cans.

604
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:40,670
I have outdone myself. What, what the
fuck, man, don't sell yourself short.

605
00:36:40,671 --> 00:36:44,750
Maybe you're, maybe you're a,
you're a stud. So he says, however,

606
00:36:44,751 --> 00:36:48,080
having a girlfriend of such caliber,
as you might imagine,

607
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:52,370
comes with its share of problems.
Ooh, Jesus. Here we go. Like,

608
00:36:52,371 --> 00:36:55,490
uh, like your good self.
I battle my battle,

609
00:36:55,491 --> 00:36:59,210
keeping my temper under control at
times and particularly struggle when my

610
00:36:59,211 --> 00:37:02,060
girlfriend and I go out in
public together. In short,

611
00:37:02,061 --> 00:37:06,980
the amount of male attention she
gets is ridiculous and at times it's

612
00:37:06,981 --> 00:37:07,814
infuriating.

613
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:13,340
Have you ever found you found yourself
out with a girl and notice that every man

614
00:37:13,341 --> 00:37:18,341
within a three mile radius from the
sweaty 22 year old walking boner to the

615
00:37:19,701 --> 00:37:20,211
porky,

616
00:37:20,211 --> 00:37:25,070
sexually frustrated father of three is
blatantly staring at her tits in her ass?

617
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:30,470
Um, I've always been of the opinion
that if a girl is obviously with a guy,

618
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,270
whether you know him or not,

619
00:37:32,271 --> 00:37:35,480
it's a gentleman's code not to
have a staring contest with their,

620
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:40,520
with her, with their ring piece.
I don't know what that means.

621
00:37:40,521 --> 00:37:43,790
What does that look into her pussy? I have
no idea. This guys from Australia. Um,

622
00:37:43,791 --> 00:37:48,020
if a girl there's alone
or with girlfriends, sure.
Objectify the shit out of her.

623
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:52,070
But I think if a girl is holding hands
with their boyfriend and you make it

624
00:37:52,071 --> 00:37:56,720
obvious that your helmet is pressing
against the inside of your front Zipper,

625
00:37:56,930 --> 00:38:00,560
then you're a cunt. Um, nothing
serious has happened yet,

626
00:38:00,561 --> 00:38:02,360
but the weather is getting warmer.

627
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:09,830
The outfits are getting smaller and I'm
concerned I'm going to wind up with,

628
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:13,850
I'm going to wind up with some perverts
blood and quite possibly come on my

629
00:38:13,851 --> 00:38:17,150
hands all for now. Um, all right.

630
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,310
All right. This is a tricky
situation, sir. You know,

631
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:27,050
it's a very tricky situation.
You know,

632
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:31,490
there's a price you pay for everything.
All right? You're the one who,

633
00:38:31,491 --> 00:38:35,150
who has the center fold fucking
girlfriend with a great ass,

634
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:39,350
nice set of fucking tits and
a, you just, you just have to,

635
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,290
okay,

636
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:44,980
this, this, this is, this
is how I look at this shit.

637
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,820
As long as you're,

638
00:38:47,821 --> 00:38:52,821
a woman isn't going around trying to
get attention if she's just fucking

639
00:38:53,051 --> 00:38:57,340
standing there and she's so goddamn
stunning that men are looking at her,

640
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:59,740
but you know, she's not, oh,

641
00:38:59,741 --> 00:39:04,720
I dropped my lipstick and then slowly
bending over at the waist while looking

642
00:39:04,721 --> 00:39:07,660
over her shoulder. Um,
if she's doing that,

643
00:39:07,661 --> 00:39:12,100
I can tell you right now a banger
another couple of times and then fucking

644
00:39:12,101 --> 00:39:16,640
dumper because she's going to be an
absolute fucking nightmare. And a,

645
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:20,770
you don't need that in your life. Okay.
But if she's just a stunning league,

646
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:25,150
gorgeous woman, um, you,
that kind of comes with it.

647
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:26,800
And,
uh,

648
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:30,970
if you lose your fucking temper
and you start acting like a maniac,

649
00:39:30,971 --> 00:39:34,030
that's a great way to eventually
annoy the shit out of her.

650
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:38,860
And because she can't help
it. Like I said, if she's
not trying to get attention,

651
00:39:38,861 --> 00:39:43,210
she can't help it, that
she's gorgeous. And, uh,

652
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,660
if you then,
it's in this weird way,

653
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:52,000
you're giving her shit for being herself,
which is not fun for anybody,

654
00:39:52,001 --> 00:39:53,770
and then you're going to have a problem.
So.

655
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,250
Okay.

656
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:59,780
Um, I don't know how to it. You
know what it's like. It's like a,

657
00:39:59,781 --> 00:40:03,230
it's like when I whore myself out at
the end of my shows and I sell DVDs.

658
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,090
All right?
I don't have to do that,

659
00:40:05,091 --> 00:40:08,420
but I choose to do it and I'm
standing as a choice. I fucking made.

660
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:11,660
And then I stand there and what's
going to happen? I answered this. Yeah.

661
00:40:11,661 --> 00:40:14,450
This is one of these podcasts questions.
All right.

662
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:17,490
Eventually somebody is going to come up
and they're going to fucking insult me.

663
00:40:17,491 --> 00:40:20,500
He's telling me they didn't
like my act. Tell me. Uh,

664
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:23,930
they didn't think I was as funny as
when he saw me on TV and I can't get mad

665
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:27,800
because it's my fucking fault for
standing there like an asshole.

666
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,920
Just, you know, I, I put myself on the
Dunkin stool and I got to admit, sir, if,

667
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:37,430
if you're, if this, if your girl
is the way that you describe her,

668
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:41,020
you just have to accept that it's,
it's par for the course and, uh,

669
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:45,230
just give yourself a little halftime
speech before you go out. You know,

670
00:40:45,231 --> 00:40:49,310
I'm not going to lose my shit. Um, but

671
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,230
if it is overt,
uh,

672
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:58,260
that has to be a way that you can fucking
address it without pissing her off,

673
00:40:58,571 --> 00:41:03,040
without you. And you also don't want
to get into a fucking fight. Um,

674
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:09,300
I dunno. Just say, hey buddy, can,
can you limit it to like, you know,

675
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:12,570
five second shifts of staring
at her tea and I can't say tits.

676
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:15,223
Okay.

677
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:19,330
I don't know what you do too. That's,
that's a rough one. That's a rough run.

678
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,580
The man that takes me back to being a,

679
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:23,813
okay.

680
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:26,420
Jesus Christ. I was like 21
years old. I went on this,

681
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:30,560
I went out on a date with this girl who
was well out of my fucking league just

682
00:41:30,561 --> 00:41:35,390
because I didn't have the confidence to
fucking be with her, you know, I mean, um,

683
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:37,101
beautiful girl.

684
00:41:37,101 --> 00:41:39,530
And I went out with her and I noticed
she just kept looking around the

685
00:41:39,531 --> 00:41:41,150
restaurant to see who was looking at her.

686
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:44,570
And I remembered it annoyed
the shit out of me, but I,

687
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:48,770
I didn't have any experience
with beautiful women, so I
just sort of accepted it.

688
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:53,970
And, um, but I never went out with her
again. It just, it drove it. I, it,

689
00:41:53,971 --> 00:41:56,210
I tapped out somewhere
through the fucking dinner.

690
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,910
Even back then I was an angry
son of a bitch. I was like,

691
00:41:58,911 --> 00:41:59,451
let me get this straight.

692
00:41:59,451 --> 00:42:02,250
I'm buying you fucking dinner and
you're looking around to see who's Elsa

693
00:42:02,251 --> 00:42:06,470
staring at your tits.
Um, yeah, you're a cunt.

694
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:10,520
Good looking cunt. But uh, nonetheless,

695
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:14,480
someday those looks are going to be gone
and I'm just going to be left with the

696
00:42:14,481 --> 00:42:15,314
cunt.

697
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:20,120
You know who's going to be a psycho cunt
because you're an attention whore and

698
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:21,440
when the attention goes away,

699
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:24,530
you're going to be like some celebrity
who fell off the fucking math,

700
00:42:24,531 --> 00:42:27,920
fucked his bitch. Fuck this. You know?

701
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:29,910
And that was the end.
[inaudible]

702
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:32,120
Shit.
That's probably cases fucking

703
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:53,080
all
right.

704
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:58,420
Question out there about, you know,
things that happen within society,

705
00:42:58,470 --> 00:42:59,303
especially,

706
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,890
this is something that I think a lot of
white people need because not because

707
00:43:02,891 --> 00:43:06,560
we're more racist than anybody else,
we just get just the,

708
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:11,700
the consequences of us fucking up is so
much harsher than other people because,

709
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:16,450
you know, we are the gold
standard when it comes to racist.

710
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:21,340
We are in the driver's seat right now.

711
00:43:21,341 --> 00:43:24,760
We have been in the driver's seat
for awhile, basically beating that.

712
00:43:24,761 --> 00:43:29,470
If we are ignorant ass holes, it has way
more effect than when other people are.

713
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:33,520
You know, back in the day
when other people were running
shit. That's the thing.

714
00:43:33,521 --> 00:43:37,750
Whoever's on top, if you
thinking ignorant, uh, that's
what, that's why, you know,

715
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,900
if you're on top and you're
thinking ignorant shit,

716
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:44,620
you have to be called on it because,
uh,

717
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:47,980
just cause he cause the effect that
you can have. You know what I mean?

718
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:49,610
Okay.

719
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:53,360
Like if somebody from Bangladesh fucking
hates me, that's such a stupid example.

720
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:56,720
Okay. That, that's not a race of people.

721
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,720
I don't even know what Bangladesh's
and I gotta be honest with you.

722
00:43:59,721 --> 00:44:01,430
I don't even know if
that's a city or a country.

723
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:06,350
Bangladesh have ever seen
that on the prices, right?

724
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:08,490
Yeah.

725
00:44:08,490 --> 00:44:13,210
I want to showcase showdown with selling
yet a Bangladesh and some white trash

726
00:44:13,211 --> 00:44:16,030
person like myself to sit with a
confused look on their face. Like yeah,

727
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:19,860
I don't know where that is.
Is that where the terrorists are?

728
00:44:19,861 --> 00:44:24,270
I don't want to go there. Whatever,
like a Filipino people fucking hate me.

729
00:44:24,271 --> 00:44:26,610
That doesn't affect my life.
It doesn't,

730
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,650
I'm not going to go and
do a job interview at,

731
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:33,660
at Walmart is not run by Filipinos.
So you know what I mean?

732
00:44:35,390 --> 00:44:38,640
You know, not saying there's anything
wrong with Filipinos. All right. See,

733
00:44:38,641 --> 00:44:40,500
we'll see what I have to do with
there's white person. They'll say,

734
00:44:40,501 --> 00:44:43,650
I'm saying I do bad about
Filipino because we clear hair. I,

735
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:46,520
I've never had issues.
I've got to have a valve of Catherine.

736
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:50,890
I'll fucking all that shit. You got to go
to the Jerry Lewis voice there lady. Um,

737
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:53,280
so yeah, people have
questions. So here we go.

738
00:44:53,281 --> 00:44:57,270
And I think all racist should shy men.
The questions that you have,

739
00:44:57,271 --> 00:44:59,920
if you have feelings about a different
race of people and you just think about,

740
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:03,330
you're thinking something funny, there's
nothing malicious, but is this offensive?

741
00:45:03,331 --> 00:45:06,300
Is it racist? This is, this
is the new topic. Okay.

742
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:11,130
And if you feel that I answered these
questions like the ignorant white man that

743
00:45:11,131 --> 00:45:15,990
I am, uh, call me out on it. I'm
here. So here we go. This first one,

744
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:19,440
Bill,
is it racist to call Indians,

745
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:25,140
Dibble Dab.
And I'm talking about the Asian ones,

746
00:45:25,141 --> 00:45:26,400
not native Americans,

747
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:30,390
I'm guessing by Dib and Dab as
you mean Dubai Dhabi or Dubai.

748
00:45:30,391 --> 00:45:35,260
October to move it the,
but you're saying like that debit Dabu um,

749
00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:40,830
is it racist? Probably,
but it's fucking funny.

750
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:43,410
So that knocks it down a little bit.

751
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:48,240
This is what I feel that makes
something like racist. It's like,

752
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:51,360
like the reason why,
uh,

753
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:55,710
that one isn't as offensive
is because we haven't,

754
00:45:56,070 --> 00:46:00,300
we never enslaved them. That's the
reason why white and black should,

755
00:46:00,301 --> 00:46:03,840
is so sensitive is because of
the shift that we did to him.

756
00:46:04,410 --> 00:46:06,810
But we haven't really fuck
with those people. You know?

757
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:11,170
So if the black version of that was,
is it,

758
00:46:11,171 --> 00:46:16,050
is it offensive to black people?
Hey man, mother fucker or whatever.

759
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:16,710
Yes.

760
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:21,270
That would be offensive if you did some
sort of mocking of the way they spoke.

761
00:46:21,271 --> 00:46:22,530
Yes.
That would be,

762
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:28,110
that would be offensive if some CEO was
giving a speech and I was driving, uh,

763
00:46:28,111 --> 00:46:33,111
actually I was having someone else drive
my town car and we drove by a group of

764
00:46:33,751 --> 00:46:38,430
a y'all mother fuckers and uh,
they proceeded to walk towards the gas.

765
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:40,230
You'd have to apologize. So I guess, yeah,

766
00:46:40,231 --> 00:46:43,410
I guess technically Duma
Dabo like that would be,

767
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:50,310
that would be offensive. Is it racist? Um,

768
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:55,350
this is what I, I really, I really,
it's hard for me to say because it had,

769
00:46:55,620 --> 00:47:00,270
it's what's in your heart, you
know, cause I make fuck I really,

770
00:47:00,271 --> 00:47:04,140
I make fun of, of everybody, you know,
I mean, I play a game out here, uh,

771
00:47:04,141 --> 00:47:07,920
when someone is make, let me ask you, I've
got a question for you. Is this racist?

772
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:13,080
I have a game out here when I ride around
with Nia and she does not approve of

773
00:47:13,081 --> 00:47:16,260
this to keep her in the clear,
she does not approve this.

774
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:21,390
When somebody makes a more ronic
move in front of me, you know,

775
00:47:21,391 --> 00:47:25,500
driving, you know, just makes
a fucking horrific move.

776
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:28,470
I play a game called old or Asian

777
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:33,880
and you have to guess why cause I'm going
to pass the person cause I got to see

778
00:47:33,881 --> 00:47:37,840
what they look like. You know, whenever
somebody does something fucked up,

779
00:47:37,841 --> 00:47:39,520
some committees do a
great joke about that.

780
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:43,780
You just want to see what the fuck they
look like. Right. Uh, that's the game.

781
00:47:43,781 --> 00:47:48,640
Older Asian. So as I speed up my little
hybrid to try to pull parallel to them,

782
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:51,390
I always say, what do you say, Nia?
What are you going with all the regime?

783
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:54,910
What do you got? Older Asian. She goes,
I'm not playing this game. That's mean.

784
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:57,670
And then I was going, I'm going to
go with the old and then I pull up,

785
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:01,690
oh it's fucking Asian, you know? Or
Oh I nailed it. It was an old guy.

786
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:06,520
So, um, is that racist?
I'm sure it's offensive,

787
00:48:06,521 --> 00:48:09,340
but within the context of my own car,
you know,

788
00:48:10,570 --> 00:48:13,640
I'm not yelling at anybody
and I got to admit, you know,

789
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:16,570
there's a lot of truth in
the fucking game, not Jesus.

790
00:48:16,571 --> 00:48:20,830
I'm going to have to apologize next week
on the podcast. So I would say that, uh,

791
00:48:20,910 --> 00:48:24,730
uh, Indian people, why don't you
chime in? I would say that, yeah,

792
00:48:24,731 --> 00:48:29,170
that they would find that they
would find that offensive. Um,

793
00:48:30,610 --> 00:48:35,110
is it racist? Let me see if I
can use it in a sentence here.

794
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:41,260
Hey, uh, you know, I called up
customer service, said, uh, you know,

795
00:48:41,261 --> 00:48:44,410
one of those blue bird dog was answered
and tried to tell me that his name was

796
00:48:44,411 --> 00:48:48,480
Steve and act like he was in Kentucky.
But I,

797
00:48:48,481 --> 00:48:51,310
I know that he was actually an India,
cause what he talked,

798
00:48:51,311 --> 00:48:55,810
he was going Dubak Dabo
Woods, how can I help you? Um,

799
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:01,920
is it racist?
Probably.

800
00:49:03,830 --> 00:49:08,330
You know what, something bad has to
happen between white culture and uh, or,

801
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:12,770
or western culture in Indians.
So, you know what I mean?

802
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:17,270
It's like a, it's like you're
playing a team and there's no rivalry

803
00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:23,470
like patriots versus jets.
This year was like a whites and blacks.

804
00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:26,330
It was bad. It was a
lot of hate, you know,

805
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:31,270
but like patriots verse,
like the Fucking Lions,

806
00:49:32,290 --> 00:49:36,100
you know? Yeah. And there's gotta be
some shit targets. It's knocked out,

807
00:49:37,270 --> 00:49:41,800
but it still hurts if somebody
says something mean. I don't,

808
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:43,750
I really don't. What the fuck
I'm talking about? All right,

809
00:49:43,751 --> 00:49:44,800
let's move to the next one.

810
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:50,070
The next one on the new controversial
topic on the Monday morning podcast.

811
00:49:50,770 --> 00:49:55,060
Is it racist? All right, here we go. Um,

812
00:49:55,660 --> 00:50:00,430
Bill, I had an interesting experience
today apparently involving me as a racist.

813
00:50:00,850 --> 00:50:05,440
I was walking with two of my coworkers
who are both black. Oh, Jesus. Here we go.

814
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,470
Um,
we were going to go get some lunch.

815
00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:12,800
One of my coworkers who are
most of friends with, uh,

816
00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:19,410
did a little high five fist bump shuffle
with one of the female sex security

817
00:50:20,051 --> 00:50:22,120
guards at the front desk.

818
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:25,330
Knowing both of them and how
they interact with one another.

819
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:30,080
I kind of made a passing
comment to the tune of, man,

820
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:34,310
you guys in your handshakes
while obviously laughing,

821
00:50:34,730 --> 00:50:39,730
laughing while obviously laughing at
just how choreographed it was in more or

822
00:50:40,161 --> 00:50:42,740
less picturing them in
a studio or something,

823
00:50:42,741 --> 00:50:47,270
working out the logistics to get the
fucking handshake. Perfect. Anyways,

824
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:52,070
we all laughed and moved on and
we got our lunch. All right,

825
00:50:52,071 --> 00:50:54,470
so nothing wrong yet.
So you're cool with these people.

826
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:58,280
You made a joke and everybody laughed.
No problems,

827
00:50:58,850 --> 00:51:03,260
no problems so far. Um, however,
after coming back through,

828
00:51:03,261 --> 00:51:05,300
secure back through security,

829
00:51:05,301 --> 00:51:09,950
I noticed the security guard stopped
me and Kinda had a scowl on her face.

830
00:51:10,490 --> 00:51:12,080
I thought she was mad at me for something,

831
00:51:12,081 --> 00:51:17,081
but it turned out she was mad at this
other lady who was black because she

832
00:51:18,021 --> 00:51:21,560
overheard my comment and was telling,
uh,

833
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:25,790
that security guard that she couldn't
believe I had the nerve to say something

834
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:30,710
like that. And I should be ashamed
also to the point where she could,

835
00:51:30,790 --> 00:51:31,623
um,

836
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:35,630
almost to the point where she could
actually go complain to the human resource

837
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:39,350
people because she was offended,
um,

838
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,750
et cetera without even considering that.

839
00:51:41,751 --> 00:51:46,340
Maybe just maybe I was talking about the
security guard and my coworker and not

840
00:51:46,341 --> 00:51:48,260
all black people now.

841
00:51:48,290 --> 00:51:52,430
It being corporate America in all I'm
sure rather than even face the pos

842
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,320
possibility of any bad press,

843
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:58,560
they'd rather just sweep me out the
door and completely ruined my re any

844
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:02,990
reputation I may or may not hold at the
company just to save their own assets.

845
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:07,940
I feel I did nothing wrong and they had
no intentions of ever doing anything

846
00:52:07,941 --> 00:52:08,990
wrong.
Anything wrong,

847
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:13,040
I'm not going to go on and on about
how I kiss black babies and trying to

848
00:52:13,041 --> 00:52:15,650
rehabilitate inner city
schools because I don't,

849
00:52:15,830 --> 00:52:20,830
but I'm certainly not some corn fed rebel
flag waving ignorant product of what

850
00:52:21,561 --> 00:52:22,730
might be incest.

851
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:27,170
I guess my question is do we really have
to walk on eggshells when we are just

852
00:52:27,171 --> 00:52:32,171
making casual conversation that just
any that just any cunt can pick apart,

853
00:52:34,370 --> 00:52:39,140
select the context that they might think
it is in and then start crying foul.

854
00:52:39,170 --> 00:52:39,980
Basically.

855
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:43,520
I would have liked to call that woman
a cunt and told her to go fuck herself.

856
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:47,270
But let's just say I was already
kind of worried about my job.

857
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:53,240
All right, let's see. Um,
yeah, I think this is,

858
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:56,870
this is the classic one where
you were fucking around.

859
00:52:58,100 --> 00:52:59,840
The other two people knew
you were fucking around,

860
00:52:59,841 --> 00:53:04,340
but they're one person decides to get
offended and then you have to go on TV and

861
00:53:04,341 --> 00:53:05,001
apologize.

862
00:53:05,001 --> 00:53:10,001
Which personally I think is the wrong
move because when you apologize now it's

863
00:53:10,491 --> 00:53:15,470
like you're, you're admitting that you
meant it in a bad way. I mean the apology,

864
00:53:15,471 --> 00:53:16,610
I would do that and say, look, you know,

865
00:53:16,611 --> 00:53:19,160
I'm sorry that you didn't
understand that I was joking,

866
00:53:19,550 --> 00:53:21,770
but I'm not going to sit here
and apologize like I have any,

867
00:53:21,830 --> 00:53:26,610
any sort of ill will come in way,
you know,

868
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:31,380
but I, but just to avoid
the problem in the future,

869
00:53:31,470 --> 00:53:32,131
uh,

870
00:53:32,131 --> 00:53:36,720
white people do not use the
expression you guys or you people

871
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:41,970
when talking about black people, that's
just it. It's just not going to, you're,

872
00:53:41,971 --> 00:53:46,900
you're setting yourself up for
someone to get offended. And, um,

873
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:52,260
there's a weird sort of a push
pull going on with that whole, uh,

874
00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:55,620
you guys and you people thing where,
um,

875
00:53:57,710 --> 00:54:02,710
with somebody white says that
there becomes this concern of,

876
00:54:02,961 --> 00:54:07,910
um, that you're separating.
You're separating like, yeah,

877
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:08,121
you know,

878
00:54:08,121 --> 00:54:12,920
you people over there with how you
live your lives and where over here,

879
00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:16,130
black people have that weird relationship
with white people where they're like,

880
00:54:16,131 --> 00:54:20,710
you know, can you stop stealing our
fucking music and our culture? And,

881
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:25,690
but then like, if something,
you know, hey, let's pave
the streets, you know, well,

882
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:28,340
make sure you do it in our neighborhood.
We're all in this together, right.

883
00:54:28,970 --> 00:54:31,700
All of us together.
You know what I mean?

884
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,900
So that's that weird sort of fucking
push pull thing going on. So yeah,

885
00:54:36,050 --> 00:54:40,880
just avoid, uh, avoid the whole fucking,

886
00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:45,870
um, yeah, you fucked up.
You didn't fuck up, but you,

887
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:49,160
you left yourself open for a
sucker punched by saying you guys,

888
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:55,100
you know, uh, I guess that
that's what it is. I don't
know. That's, that's, that's my,

889
00:54:55,970 --> 00:54:58,880
I basically a white guy telling
a white guy how he fucked up.

890
00:54:58,881 --> 00:55:03,290
So black people feel listening
to this think, uh, please,
please help me out here.

891
00:55:03,350 --> 00:55:05,930
Did I basically get it right?
Is that essentially it?

892
00:55:06,410 --> 00:55:09,950
And I know most people wouldn't get
offended at all. Right? So there you go.

893
00:55:09,951 --> 00:55:14,360
That's the new, that's the new topic.
Is it racist? And I would love to hear,

894
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:19,790
um, some honest comments from a non
white people about their thoughts.

895
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:25,370
You know, the fucked up ones too. Okay.

896
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:29,810
Cause I've watched enough spike Lee movies
to think that evidently it's just us,

897
00:55:29,811 --> 00:55:33,380
but I've hung around enough people from
different races to realize, oh yeah,

898
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:34,693
everybody's like,

899
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:39,820
[inaudible] so.
