1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:06,110
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's
the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

2
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:11,290
August 20th, 2012. How's it going out?

3
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:16,940
I can't fucking hear myself. I don't
know what the fuck happened to my, uh,

4
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:20,180
my other, my regular,
my regular headphones,

5
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:24,740
which suck by the way because
they flake all over my ears.

6
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:29,660
What does that mean bill? I don't know.
A little pieces of plastic. You know,

7
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:33,140
like they don't have the
space age technology.

8
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:35,810
Whenever somebody uses that expression,
you know,

9
00:00:35,811 --> 00:00:38,450
they have no idea what they're talking.
This is just coming from the gut.

10
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:42,470
Like they don't have the fucking
space age technology to make a set of

11
00:00:42,471 --> 00:00:46,310
headphones that, that will
just last forever. You know,

12
00:00:46,311 --> 00:00:50,150
can't do that canyon. Well we
might get lasts forever. Oh,

13
00:00:50,151 --> 00:00:54,550
they're never going to come
back and buy another one. Dan,

14
00:00:54,551 --> 00:00:59,260
what are we going to do? I don't know.
Go plant some beats. You fucking cunt.

15
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:04,570
Do you feel how fucking hot the
sun is lately? Have you felt it?

16
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,930
You know, do you remember it ever being
is fucking hot as it is now? Like,

17
00:01:09,931 --> 00:01:14,250
literally God has a magnifying glass right
up on the crown of your head. Granted,

18
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,410
part of it could be because
my hair's done and out,

19
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,490
but I choose not to
address that this week.

20
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:27,420
You know the God damn
hole in the ozone layer.

21
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:31,290
Can you make fucking headphones
last a little bit longer? You know,

22
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,540
so now what I'm supposed to
throw out these other ones,

23
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,640
these flaky ones that I can't
even fucking fine. Right? I love,

24
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:41,640
I yo put it in the trash,
put it in the fucking trash like,

25
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,810
like it's still not going to end up
outside somewhere. It is outside.

26
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,730
We just have it over here in this
contained area. You know what?

27
00:01:50,731 --> 00:01:53,610
I'm not going to be able to tell whether
any of this is funny cause I can't hear

28
00:01:53,611 --> 00:01:57,360
myself. I'm like a singer right
now. You know, turn up the monitors.

29
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,220
Oops,
I did it again as shaped my pathy.

30
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,710
Um, yeah, so I got to go
out and go buy another,

31
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,240
another fucking pair of headphones.

32
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,470
I'm one of those crabby old fucking
people who I, when I buy something,

33
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,290
I use it until it's fucking,

34
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:20,880
it becomes literally on a different
matter, you know what I mean?

35
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,330
Starts dissolving into a, a
powder. Is that a different matter?

36
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,170
All you egg heads out there, we'll
technically a powder is still a solid,

37
00:02:29,171 --> 00:02:32,590
it's just did a more granulated form.
Thank you.

38
00:02:32,591 --> 00:02:34,360
Never fucking got your Dick sucked.

39
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:37,750
Why don't you go back with the lab coat
and have a nice fucking hand job with

40
00:02:37,751 --> 00:02:42,100
yourself and a pipe in it again
later when I say something stupid.

41
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:46,900
Um, I'm a little wound up
this morning. I'm excited.

42
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:53,080
An older, wiser bill burr, wiser than
he was last week. I'm finally back, uh,

43
00:02:53,081 --> 00:02:57,610
back here in Los Angeles, Los Angeles,
you know, which is always, you know,

44
00:02:57,611 --> 00:03:01,200
kind of a creepy place to come to once
you've been on the east coast and you sit

45
00:03:01,201 --> 00:03:05,890
in there looking at all the green trees
and all the ponds and all the lush land

46
00:03:05,891 --> 00:03:09,010
back there. And then I fly across
the fucking country, as I always say,

47
00:03:09,011 --> 00:03:13,930
watching the country slowly die,
right? Slowly getting fucking,

48
00:03:13,931 --> 00:03:18,190
you know, geographical chemotherapy. Um,

49
00:03:18,191 --> 00:03:22,180
it's usually to be a big Bandanna tied
right over fucking Arizona in southern

50
00:03:22,181 --> 00:03:24,220
California. Oh, that's good. Beth.

51
00:03:24,221 --> 00:03:28,050
A little cancer joke in there with your
fucking musings about our topography,

52
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:33,250
topography. Um, but I got to admit,

53
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,420
I'm actually excited to be
on this side of the country.

54
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,540
I think I have a better
chance of surviving whatever
the fuck is going to happen

55
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:45,760
to this planet.
Believe it or not,

56
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,540
in this overpopulated city that
technically has no water supply.

57
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:54,250
I have a better fucking chance.
Why you ask? I'll tell you why.

58
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:58,090
Because I read a fucking article. I
didn't read it. Who's kidding? Who?

59
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,750
I glazed over it and it
was so fucking depressing.

60
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,750
It scared the fucking shit out of me.
But as far as I can tell,

61
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:09,190
New York City is going to look
like Venice and about three years.

62
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:14,430
That's what I'm guessing. You
know, it's going underwater.

63
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:16,283
That's what I think.

64
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,550
So if you're on the third floor or lower,

65
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:24,150
you might want to consider
selling your apartment now. Um,

66
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,250
they've just do an all this shit
talking about how, you know,

67
00:04:26,251 --> 00:04:29,910
the glaciers are melting
at a much quicker rate.

68
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:35,250
Len scientists first feared,
look at this picture from July.

69
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,320
Now look at this one.
You know, I have no idea.

70
00:04:37,321 --> 00:04:40,410
You know what's funny is I have no
idea if the pictures are fucking real.

71
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:45,870
You know, they're like these, uh, these
pictures that show like, you know,

72
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,250
red and white,

73
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,740
white obviously being the glacier red
being now like fucking the sunburn,

74
00:04:52,741 --> 00:04:54,780
shoulders of a red head or some shit.
Right?

75
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,360
So it's basically scaring
the shit out of me.

76
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:01,470
And then I actually found
comfort in something. Well,

77
00:05:01,471 --> 00:05:02,870
they were saying that scientists,
you know,

78
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:05,930
not so much shit has melted in Antarctica.

79
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:10,490
They're actually saying that,
um, this is even being recorded.

80
00:05:10,491 --> 00:05:14,310
I can't even fucking hear myself.
Uh,

81
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,120
what's the solution bill?
Should you turn it up a little bit?

82
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,440
Maybe a little bit halfway through
it. Why not now? Look at it now.

83
00:05:20,441 --> 00:05:24,100
It just went through the fucking roof
and I still can't hear myself anyways.

84
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:28,660
Scientists or the writer who wrote the
article, maybe they just made it up.

85
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:33,520
I have no fucking idea.
Basically said that,

86
00:05:33,521 --> 00:05:37,210
uh, they discovered, you
know that back in the day,

87
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:41,860
aunt Artica was aunt Artica
bill at Arctica, aunt Artica,

88
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,890
who gives a fuck,
you know,

89
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:49,540
God damn place with all this fucking
penguins sitting there pushing their

90
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:52,390
fucking, except who fucking went
and saw that march of the penguins.

91
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:58,280
Why don't you just call it, I want to
cry for the final half hour. You know,

92
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,940
that's what every nature show is.
Let's show you how fucking cute they are.

93
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:04,250
And now we're going to show
you what we're doing to them.

94
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,420
And now you sit there with this
hopeless, sad fucking feeling, right?

95
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:12,980
And then what if you'd like to donate,
give the flak and save the penguins feet,

96
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:17,930
right? Dotcom. And then what do you do?
You go over to your checkbook, you know,

97
00:06:17,931 --> 00:06:20,510
and you pull out another check
and you write, you write it out,

98
00:06:20,511 --> 00:06:22,820
and then you grab a fucking
envelope and you grabbed a stamp.

99
00:06:22,821 --> 00:06:27,260
You do all that bullshit. Or you print
out a stamp if fuse and stamps.com oh,

100
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:31,970
what a whore. Um, right. And you mail
it off thinking you did a good thing,

101
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:37,100
but what did you do? He just used a
whole bunch of paper. Yeah. You know?

102
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,690
Right.
Because you do that enough people do that.

103
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:40,250
They got to cut down another tree,
right?

104
00:06:40,251 --> 00:06:43,040
Next thing you know that little
fucking penguins got nothing to center

105
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:44,000
underneath.
You don't want to,

106
00:06:44,001 --> 00:06:47,900
Jax is a little fucking penguin dick to
make another egg. And then how it works.

107
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:52,520
Aren't they like asexual that they fucking
Jack often with their little flipper

108
00:06:52,521 --> 00:06:56,470
into the other flipper.
And then do like a pap smear fucking uh,

109
00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:00,800
sort of a George Gervin lay up
to their own fucking crotch area.

110
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:09,140
George Gervin the iceman that actually
made sense. Penguins ice, right?

111
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,810
I go fuck yourself.
Anyways,

112
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:17,510
so, um, this part is it made
up, they actually said that,

113
00:07:17,511 --> 00:07:21,060
that the fucking and article that
the fucking Antarctica, okay.

114
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:26,460
You people who are, uh,
scientists out there, Jesus
belt. Just say what they said.

115
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:31,290
Just say what? The Guy said that they
said that you now believe. Um, he said,

116
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,950
uh,
oh Geez,

117
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,880
I can stop talking to her
cell phone than Antarctica.

118
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:40,490
People punching the dashboard right now.
Spit it out.

119
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:46,210
And Arnica used to be a tropical
forest. All right. Nine. Oh,

120
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,170
a lot of rednecks went.

121
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,693
How

122
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:57,930
born to the fucking
swamps running over vapor.

123
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:02,340
Well, I think their tails is so
flat. They used me round to me.

124
00:08:02,341 --> 00:08:06,970
My truck went in that
crick. Hey, no, not likely.

125
00:08:06,971 --> 00:08:11,760
And driving over some hairy little
fucker. I love it. Raccoons.

126
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:15,150
These just something about him.
Raccoons, possums, all of them.

127
00:08:15,151 --> 00:08:19,170
They just got this look on their face
that just says, shoot me. You know,

128
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:24,650
I'm just going with my instincts. I'm
out in nature and I'm just going with it.

129
00:08:24,651 --> 00:08:28,730
I'm seeing these little fuckers to staring
at me. I got my headlights out them.

130
00:08:28,731 --> 00:08:31,880
They just keep fucking
looking at you don't get shot
stuff fucking looking at me.

131
00:08:31,881 --> 00:08:34,110
That's how I look at it.
Um,

132
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,880
this is what I believe with
that information that that
guy said that the other

133
00:08:38,881 --> 00:08:42,850
guy said that know what
they're talking about. So I,

134
00:08:42,851 --> 00:08:44,860
I think that the global war,

135
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,640
I can't believe I'm actually trying
to attempt to discuss this subject.

136
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:52,570
I think global warming is actually
natural, but we are hastening it.

137
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,860
We're just making it way fucking quicker.
We have it on forward. You're like,

138
00:08:55,861 --> 00:08:58,290
you fast forward through commercials.
That's what we're doing.

139
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:02,130
And we're doing that towards
our, uh, our own fucking demise,

140
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,740
which I think is going to be tremendous.
You know, and then we'll die.

141
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,370
And then maybe all this shit that,
you know,

142
00:09:09,371 --> 00:09:11,190
when they put a microscope
up to your skin,

143
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:14,240
all that little shit there that's
crawling all over you. Maybe.

144
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,520
Maybe that's the next thing that's
going to build a skyscraper.

145
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:23,150
Name it after themselves and have people
write a whole fucking nice version of

146
00:09:24,961 --> 00:09:27,810
their life because they're afraid that
there actually is some old man in the sky

147
00:09:27,811 --> 00:09:30,300
that's going to fucking judge
them when they die. You know,

148
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,130
if you could write your own little thing,

149
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:37,480
your own little ditty about your life,
how would you sum yourself up?

150
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:41,800
I love people that kind of know
they were a Douche, you know,

151
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:45,040
although he didn't always right
there, you know, like, okay,

152
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:47,170
I know I'm kind of going to hell in a way.

153
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:53,800
Speaking of which, I started
reading this book, sins of the,

154
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:59,050
it's a book I wanted to read for a long
time. It was about not Joe Kennedy.

155
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:04,800
And I figured what better time to start
reading that book while I was taking an

156
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:08,260
ultra white vacation on
the island of Nantucket,

157
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:14,020
considering you get on the high speed
ferry, run over a couple of seals,

158
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:19,480
um, right out of Hyannis port,
home of the Kennedy compound,

159
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:22,600
you know, and for so
long, what did they say?

160
00:10:22,601 --> 00:10:26,560
They call it Camelot there the first
fucking Royal Lee family and all that

161
00:10:26,561 --> 00:10:30,220
bullshit. Right. But I always heard,
you know that what's his face?

162
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,560
Joe Kennedy was, you know, Goddamn rum
runner, you know, he made all this money,

163
00:10:35,561 --> 00:10:38,050
insider trading and all this
fucking bullshit. Right?

164
00:10:38,051 --> 00:10:39,730
So I wanna I want to read about
it. I want to, I want to see,

165
00:10:39,731 --> 00:10:40,720
I want to hear the other side.

166
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:46,020
Now that I've read the fluff about all
the sacrifices he made for this country

167
00:10:46,391 --> 00:10:47,980
and all his kids die in,
you know,

168
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:52,300
in war and in public servants getting
assassinated and fucking going skiing

169
00:10:52,301 --> 00:10:55,300
while trying to play
football. Right. I was like,

170
00:10:55,301 --> 00:10:58,330
I got to check this shit out and I
read it. You know, I've got the book.

171
00:10:58,331 --> 00:11:02,260
I thought it was going to be a great book.
That book is,

172
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,140
it's like a fucking,

173
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:09,150
I feel like some soccer mom reading
some juicy like summer novel.

174
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:13,150
Like I should be digging my toes in the
sand with my knees up to my chest as I

175
00:11:13,151 --> 00:11:17,110
read it.
It's just such a one sided and it's so,

176
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:21,410
so much fucking hearsay. Oh, did he?

177
00:11:21,411 --> 00:11:25,550
Did he do this for this reason?
Or maybe he did it because he was a cunt.

178
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,890
First of all, the guy made a fuck
load of money. All right, let's,

179
00:11:29,891 --> 00:11:33,380
let's get down to brass tacks to guy is
one of the weirdest looking human beings

180
00:11:33,381 --> 00:11:34,340
I've ever seen in my life.

181
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:38,540
I used to think all the Kennedys had
that same look about them cause they sort

182
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:40,370
of did a Rothchild thing
where they kind of,

183
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:44,510
they kind of fucked real close
to the farm, so to speak.

184
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:49,700
So they kind of had that [inaudible]
here comes my big fucking head over here.

185
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:50,893
Right?

186
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,830
He's a fucking weird looking dude.
I will definitely give you that.

187
00:11:56,831 --> 00:12:00,340
But when he did his insider trading,
it wasn't illegal.

188
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:04,930
You know, the guy actually says in
the book that it wasn't illegal,

189
00:12:04,931 --> 00:12:09,130
so he didn't do anything wrong.
You know, it was looked down upon,

190
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,980
it was considered a shady thing to do.

191
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,120
But the guy goes and then he has some
sort of quote of Joe Kennedy go cabal,

192
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,060
let's do this quick before they
make a law against it. It's like,

193
00:12:22,061 --> 00:12:24,460
where did you get that fucking quote from?
I don't know.

194
00:12:24,461 --> 00:12:26,740
So all I do is I'm just
skipping around the book.

195
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:30,160
I want to see how he reacted
when when Jack got whacked,

196
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:33,020
I wanted to see what happened
to their kid that you know,

197
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,310
they said was a mentally
challenged but maybe wasn't,

198
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,640
was just a pain in the ass and
they gave her a fucking love.

199
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:41,650
Bottomy it's really
just a sad fucking read.

200
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:45,530
I just jumped around it and now I'm
going to use it as a fucking paper weight

201
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,000
and I can't tell you how long
I wanted to read that book.

202
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,520
I know what you're thinking right now.
Bill,

203
00:12:50,521 --> 00:12:52,590
where the fuck are you going with this?
I don't know.

204
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:56,490
I don't know where I'm going.
I can't fucking hear myself.

205
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:02,070
All right. For those of you who
did listen to my podcast last week,

206
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:03,960
I have a new stand up special called you.

207
00:13:03,961 --> 00:13:08,310
People are all the same and
it's airing exclusively.

208
00:13:08,311 --> 00:13:09,144
It's streaming,

209
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:13,290
whatever you could say on a Netflix
and I know what you're thinking.

210
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:17,520
Is it only on Netflix in
America or the United States?

211
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,240
No sir, ma'am. Transgendered person.

212
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:25,920
It's a hermaphrodites. It's
also on Canada. Netflix.

213
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:31,650
It's also on Ireland,
Netflix and Great Britain.

214
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:35,230
Netflix, which I'm really excited
about because I think I got,

215
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:38,160
I think I have a very, uh,
very, uh, user friendly,

216
00:13:38,161 --> 00:13:41,630
special [inaudible] got a
little choked up there. Um,

217
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:45,870
I think people are gonna like it. When
you think about that. I'm actually,

218
00:13:45,871 --> 00:13:49,110
I'm feeling good you guys. You guys wrote
so many nice things to be on Twitter,

219
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:53,070
which is a rarity to just get
a whole nice sea of niceness.

220
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:55,650
And I know a couple of cuts right now
just for the fuck of it going to write a

221
00:13:55,651 --> 00:13:59,710
bad one, but I know what you're up to. Um,

222
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:05,470
so people ask me, they said,
hey, how can I regular guy,

223
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:09,340
regular old gal,
just salt of the earth person.

224
00:14:09,341 --> 00:14:13,570
How can I get a hard copy version of that
hour of filth that you just put out on

225
00:14:13,571 --> 00:14:17,580
Netflix? Um, this is the deal. Um,

226
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,140
the hard copy version,
the digital version,

227
00:14:20,141 --> 00:14:22,840
whatever the fuck you want
to download it to your Ipod,

228
00:14:22,841 --> 00:14:27,670
you're fucking a iPad. What? I don't
know what, whatever you people use,

229
00:14:27,671 --> 00:14:29,860
I don't, I don't fucking
know anymore. Okay.

230
00:14:29,861 --> 00:14:33,190
However you want or you want to go fucking
old school, I'll put it out on VHS.

231
00:14:33,191 --> 00:14:35,260
You keep running your gaps.
Now I'm not doing that.

232
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:39,490
I'll put it out on DVD and all that stuff
and you will be able to get it at my

233
00:14:39,491 --> 00:14:44,220
website. And my website only
build bird.com. That's it.

234
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,410
We've got a whole page set
up, but I just, you know,

235
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:51,150
it will be coming out in September.
Going to let it marinate for good six.

236
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:55,100
Let people go. Oh, I like it.
Where could I bucket by it? Right.

237
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:58,700
And then Bam, it's going
to be available. And uh,

238
00:14:58,701 --> 00:15:01,010
the wonderful thing about this is,
uh,

239
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:06,480
I'm eliminating the middle man and
that way it can be fucking cheaper.

240
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,430
You know, I'm basically, I'm doing
what Radiohead did 10 years ago.

241
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:13,610
I'm doing what prince did. I'm
going to do that thing, you know,

242
00:15:13,611 --> 00:15:17,750
and now it's gone into the whole
fucking comedy world with uh,

243
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:23,290
Louis C k Aziz and all those guys and
I being the hack that I am and I am

244
00:15:23,331 --> 00:15:28,070
following right in line. Okay. Seems to
be working for everybody else. Why not me?

245
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:31,580
Um, so there you go. That's how
you're going to be able to get it.

246
00:15:31,581 --> 00:15:34,110
You're just going to go
to my website and um,

247
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:36,980
as that day approaches when you can do it,
uh,

248
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:39,680
I will let you know and um,

249
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:45,860
I don't know what the prices are going
to be. It seems like it's going to be $5.

250
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,121
I want to be,

251
00:15:47,121 --> 00:15:51,920
I want to have it be $5 and 1 cent
just to fucking piss people off,

252
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:54,890
you know,
sacrificing some sales just for people.

253
00:15:54,891 --> 00:15:58,010
But this got to think he's 1 cent better
than everybody else. Um, so that's,

254
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,790
that's the answer to your questions.
People have been asking me. Um, all right.

255
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:07,250
And that is it. Back to the podcast.
If this podcast is even being recorded,

256
00:16:07,251 --> 00:16:10,730
God knows I can't fucking hear myself.
Um,

257
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:16,580
speaking of stamps.com everybody,
come on.

258
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:21,380
Don't do this to me. Oh, I
hate this computer. I fucking,

259
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:23,180
what is the problem?

260
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:29,720
What is the fucking problem?
I did it right. Oh, what now?

261
00:16:29,721 --> 00:16:30,800
You're going to freeze up on me?

262
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:33,980
You're going to freeze up on
when I need you most, right.

263
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,770
Right in the middle of the podcast.
So now what do I have to do?

264
00:16:36,771 --> 00:16:41,420
I have to force fucking quit. I don't like
foursquare. That's a little too rapey,

265
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:45,410
isn't it? In a computer sense.
Forced quit. There you go.
I'm forcing you to quit.

266
00:16:45,411 --> 00:16:49,860
Yeah, like an overbearing
father. Hey. You know,

267
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:53,720
one thing that I noticed
about myself asides, you know,

268
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:58,220
the obvious that I'm an extreme douchebag
is when I was down in Nantucket,

269
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:03,280
I really had to work on not hating rich
people just because they were rich,

270
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:09,170
you know? Oh, let me get this stupid
commercial out of the way here real quick.

271
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,680
Not a stupid commercial.
A a very important information.

272
00:17:12,681 --> 00:17:15,870
Let me get this to you here.
I stamps.com everybody, um,

273
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,170

274
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:22,340

Are you busy? Do you got stuff to do?

275
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,580
Do you want to get caught up on
your favorite show? But, oh snap,

276
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:27,110
I have to go to the post office.

277
00:17:27,111 --> 00:17:29,720
Would it be great if you didn't
have to go to the post office yet.

278
00:17:29,721 --> 00:17:33,260
You could get everything that you
could possibly want at the post office,

279
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:37,490
minus the attitudes right in your
own home or apartment Gazebo,

280
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:39,200
wherever you live.
Well,

281
00:17:39,201 --> 00:17:42,980
with stamps.com it's easy to use to
do all of that and it's convenient.

298
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:47,490
I'm down in, uh, I'm
down in Nantucket and uh,

299
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,720
with all family friends, extended family
and all that type of stuff. Nieces,

300
00:18:51,721 --> 00:18:56,000
nephews, the whole nine
yards, drinking again.

301
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:59,360
Oh baby, I'm drinking again. You
know, I'm down there, boozing it up,

302
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:03,350
drinking some of that Cisco
Brewery, whale tail, Pale Ale,

303
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:05,120
whatever they got down there.
You know,

304
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:10,430
I got my little Nantucket Red Fuckin um,
I'm friends with the bankers shorts on.

305
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,280
I'm living the dream.
All right.

306
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:17,060
And I'm just sitting there walking
around and I'm looking at all these rich

307
00:19:17,061 --> 00:19:21,620
fucking people and I just
find myself, I fucking

308
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,200
the level with which I was judging them,

309
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:30,500
which of course no one would give a shit.
You know what I mean? If I was judging,

310
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:34,130
uh, you know, a Ey,

311
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,700
ey with the fuck am I doing?

312
00:19:35,701 --> 00:19:38,400
If I was judging like some
poor group of people like that,

313
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:42,060
I would be considered the
biggest douche ever. All right?

314
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:44,970
You don't all these poor people. Why?
Why are you judging in that way? Right?

315
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:47,820
But you, you, you did
he, why am I stuttering?

316
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:51,000
You're fucking judge rich people that way.

317
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:54,840
Everybody laughs. They all
think it's funny. You know,

318
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,990
I had to work the whole week.
It's like, why do I hate that guy?

319
00:19:57,991 --> 00:20:01,380
How do I know he didn't get his money?
Legitimately?

320
00:20:01,381 --> 00:20:05,460
Why am I immediately assuming that this
guy was a complete piece of fucking shit?

321
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:10,860
You know, you know what it is. I don't
like how rich people carry themselves.

322
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:13,590
People born into wealth.
They just have this,

323
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:18,600
like that time when I was in DC and that
little fucking six year old kid got up,

324
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:20,440
walked right up to the bark,

325
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:25,250
a client up on the stool and started
calling out to this adult behind the bar,

326
00:20:25,251 --> 00:20:29,450
sir, sir, excuse me
sir, like the co I can,

327
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:33,360
I'll never be able to do the proper
read of that. The way this kid said it,

328
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:37,430
there was such a comfort in, in,

329
00:20:37,431 --> 00:20:42,020
in summarizing this person over to come
and talk to them to do whatever the fuck

330
00:20:42,021 --> 00:20:45,080
he needed them to do at six years old.
Um,

331
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,010
if fucking the shit, I mean, I was

332
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:48,843
just looking at in these,

333
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,060
these fucking which people they have
the creepiest looking God damn kids you

334
00:20:52,061 --> 00:20:55,990
ever seen in your life.
Just creepy little fucking future bankers,

335
00:20:55,991 --> 00:21:00,400
CEO looking kids, you
know, little blonde hair.

336
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,740
They already got those, those
Chubby fucking, you know,

337
00:21:02,741 --> 00:21:07,360
all kids have chubby cheeks, but just
the way they look, that waspy pedigree.

338
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:08,763
Right.

339
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:11,720
Which is another thing I can get
away with. You know what I mean?

340
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:16,010
The waspy pedigree, everybody will laugh.
We can only gives a fuck about that.

341
00:21:16,011 --> 00:21:19,730
You can trash waspy people up and down.
I can't be always with this, this,

342
00:21:19,731 --> 00:21:20,600
this Jewish

343
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,740
blah blah. That's it. I
got to fucking apology.

344
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,420
Waspy totally gets a fucking open lane.

345
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:30,670
So anyways,
waspy fucking look upon them,

346
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:34,060
right with their fucking,
you know,

347
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:40,300
they look like little Winston Churchill's
like they still talk like little kids,

348
00:21:40,301 --> 00:21:42,590
but they should be walking around and
right here Troy Howard was numbers number

349
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:46,330
rider. How did, it just did just look
like they're going to fucking get,

350
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,180
they're going to get some
great fucking job and they,

351
00:21:49,181 --> 00:21:51,700
and they're going to steal from the
company and when they get caught,

352
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:53,560
they're not going to
get fucking prosecutor.

353
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,870
Just like these God bankers
just like all these rich cuts,

354
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,180
they just not gonna cause they're going
to have connections and Pete and he's

355
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:02,350
going to got to know shit about
people, whatever. And they just,

356
00:22:02,351 --> 00:22:04,840
they just hook each other up the same way

357
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:10,390
at the level that I grew up.
You didn't rat out your friends.

358
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,430
They're doing the same
thing at their level,

359
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:17,140
except what they can do affects the
entire population as opposed to the level

360
00:22:17,141 --> 00:22:18,700
that I came up with where,
you know,

361
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:23,470
maybe somebody's car that used to be
there isn't there anymore yet off.

362
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:28,540
That's insurance fraud, I guess that
hopes that hurts the group after a while,

363
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:32,620
doesn't it? I Dunno. So
that was basically, uh,

364
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,250
what I had to work at,
you know,

365
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,100
and they had this place down the
street called the summer house.

366
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,930
I was staying out in Wisconsin and uh,

367
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:45,770
it's absolutely fucking beautiful and uh,

368
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:51,030
I just couldn't get myself to go in there.
I want it to go in there.

369
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,920
I wanted to sit down and
have a fucking drink,

370
00:22:52,921 --> 00:22:56,850
but every time I saw another person
going in with their fucking boat shoes

371
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,850
without any socks on,
like I felt like this,

372
00:22:59,851 --> 00:23:04,110
this hatred coming up in me and I
justified it for like two, three days.

373
00:23:04,111 --> 00:23:08,390
And I was just like, what the fuck is
wrong with me? You know, I bet you know

374
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:15,210
those people that they're probably just
like me or the people I hang out with in

375
00:23:15,431 --> 00:23:18,470
that,
as I always say,

376
00:23:18,471 --> 00:23:21,020
most of them are douchebags but there's
going to be like four or five people in

377
00:23:21,021 --> 00:23:25,020
that are going to be really interesting.
I've totally time I flew on the plane,

378
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:25,480
right?

379
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:29,040
And I sat next to that guy who made a
ton of fucking money starting his own

380
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:29,970
credit credit card.

381
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,290
And then he parlayed that money
into buying cell phone towers.

382
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:39,180
The guy was fucking hilarious. He had
it lost it, had it all again, lost it.

383
00:23:39,181 --> 00:23:42,180
And then now he was on top again. He had
this a, what the fuck are you gonna do?

384
00:23:42,181 --> 00:23:46,040
Vibe self made man.
So I'm sitting there going,

385
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,350
they're not all like that,
but they all had that saved.

386
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:53,130
I def with their fucking feet. I
can't stand them. I really got issues.

387
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:54,490
Okay.

388
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:57,670
Cause here I am, I'm down there,
I'm vacation and to act and like,

389
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:01,600
oh but I'm the down to Earth Douche
bag with my salmon colored shorts on.

390
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:06,690
Fucking hypocrite. I Dunno. So anyways,

391
00:24:06,691 --> 00:24:11,310
I ended up going out
fishing, uh, with my family.

392
00:24:11,311 --> 00:24:15,930
We had a great time, didn't
catch shit, just catch blue
fish, didn't even catch us.

393
00:24:15,931 --> 00:24:18,990
Striper did catch anything,
but you know,

394
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:22,650
it was still cool and we didn't take
more than that then we were going to eat.

395
00:24:22,651 --> 00:24:25,530
So, uh, I didn't feel too
bad about that, but, uh,

396
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,340
I think I kind of got talked into
doing something really stupid.

397
00:24:29,341 --> 00:24:33,480
The guy who had the boat actually had
a fucking shark cage and he's like,

398
00:24:33,481 --> 00:24:36,930
you know, it's totally safe.
We take you about 15 miles out.

399
00:24:36,931 --> 00:24:41,160
We chummed the water and you get in
this fucking cage and you know what,

400
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:43,760
Ah,

401
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,600
you have to all these years of doing bits
about how fucking stupid it is to swim

402
00:24:47,601 --> 00:24:51,380
in the ocean and all that type of shit.
I'm going to do it next year.

403
00:24:51,381 --> 00:24:52,214
I'm going to do it.

404
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:56,090
I almost said it costs an arm and a
leg as your fucking pun right there.

405
00:24:56,570 --> 00:25:00,710
You're awful joke. But uh, it
does. It's really expensive,

406
00:25:00,711 --> 00:25:02,390
but I want to see a fucking shark.

407
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:03,920
Okay.

408
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:07,310
You know, and I got that
white thing in me where I, uh,

409
00:25:07,311 --> 00:25:11,990
that white person think where I
want to see the shark being a shark.

410
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,540
You know,
the same way.

411
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:17,780
I don't want to see a bear just
walking through the forest.

412
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:21,830
I want to throw something at it so it
gets up on its hind leg Ra and starts

413
00:25:21,831 --> 00:25:26,210
doing that shit. Like it's about ready
to step into the squared circle. Right.

414
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:31,460
I think that that is uniquely
a white thing that we, we just,

415
00:25:31,461 --> 00:25:36,461
we just want to see it animal looking
like it's going to kill us or we don't

416
00:25:36,771 --> 00:25:41,190
feel like we, that we got the
full experience now. Okay.

417
00:25:41,191 --> 00:25:45,150
Now can I not only not hear myself getting
hot as fuck in here and I don't even

418
00:25:45,151 --> 00:25:49,830
know why. Oh bill private. Cause
you don't have the windows open. Um,

419
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:52,950
anyways,
what else do I have here?

420
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:57,090
What else do I have here on the dock
at a shit that I want to talk about?

421
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:02,490
Oh, as you can tell, I read rolling stone.
Here's another article I saw, by the way,

422
00:26:02,491 --> 00:26:06,000
they have Rick Ross on
the, uh, on, on the cover.

423
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,290
I don't know much about the guy other
than he's the most confident fat person

424
00:26:10,291 --> 00:26:11,790
I've ever seen in my
life for half a second.

425
00:26:11,791 --> 00:26:15,150
I thought it was little Wayne and he just
went to like Wendy's for 20 days in a

426
00:26:15,151 --> 00:26:15,984
row.

427
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:24,560
How much does the tattoo artists not
want to tattoo the underneath part of

428
00:26:24,561 --> 00:26:27,200
fucking Rick Ross's man tits.
You know,

429
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:31,280
cause at some point you sitting there
with the surgical gloves and you got to

430
00:26:31,281 --> 00:26:34,910
hold it up and actually feel the
fucking weight of it. Is Your fucking,

431
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:40,210
I wonder if he giggles. Um, I actually,
I started to read that article, but I,

432
00:26:40,211 --> 00:26:41,044
I cannot,

433
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:46,090
I can't read articles about rappers at
that fuck who come with that vibe of look

434
00:26:48,331 --> 00:26:50,850
of, Oh look at all the shit
that I have. It's the most,

435
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,430
you feel like you're
reading like a fucking,

436
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:58,590
I dunno what Jordan Marsh catalog.
That's all they are.

437
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:02,370
He said something.
He was standing on Jewish marble.

438
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,850
Is there a such thing as Jewish marble?
I have no fucking idea.

439
00:27:05,851 --> 00:27:10,680
Is that somehow like a GM? I said kosher
if like some fucking Borshbelt joke.

440
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:14,760
Um, at one point and he goes
out to a fucking steakhouse.

441
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,750
They list everything that he
orders and how much it costs.

442
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:20,190
Okay.

443
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:24,260
Uh, it's unreal if you illiterate, if you,
honestly, if you have problems sleeping,

444
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:29,630
read that. And I'm not trashing
the writer. I just, I, I,

445
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:31,250
I'm on a fucking plane.

446
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:36,500
I'm trying to kill time and I couldn't
get through the fucking article. Oh,

447
00:27:36,501 --> 00:27:41,270
do you smoke weed the whole time? Do
you have 50,000 fucking cars? I got it.

448
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,273
Yeah.

449
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:47,850
You know what they call that Nantucket?
They call that new money.

450
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,600
I never used to know what that
expression is. He's new money.

451
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,230
You know what old money does old
money acts like they don't have money.

452
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,450
You know what I mean?
They'd walk around and Salmon,

453
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:02,350
fucking colored pants and they call up
their financial advisor and then they

454
00:28:02,351 --> 00:28:04,510
manipulate the market and
they make more fucking money.

455
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:06,040
And then all of a sudden they,

456
00:28:06,041 --> 00:28:09,730
a prohibition comes along and they got to
hook up for Scotch. So what do they do?

457
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:13,360
They fucking do it. I really don't
have a prop while you know something,

458
00:28:13,361 --> 00:28:14,740
I didn't get into how we,
uh,

459
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,150
I don't know who the fuck knows if
anything that they're saying about Joe

460
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:23,020
Kennedy's the truth. I want
it to be the truth. You know,

461
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:26,470
cause it makes you feel better
about yourself. That's what it is.

462
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,090
That's why you look at
rich people like that.

463
00:28:28,091 --> 00:28:30,880
You have to look at them like they
did something fucking crooked.

464
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:34,150
Because if you don't,
it makes you feel like a loser.

465
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,920
His fucking yacht is bigger
than all the houses on my block,

466
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,143
you know?

467
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:43,400
Now if you give him the
benefit of the doubt,

468
00:28:43,401 --> 00:28:45,800
then you just have to stand
there and just take that shit.

469
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:49,280
Or you can just say he's a crooked
son of a bitch. He's going to hell.

470
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:51,380
God loves me best.
Right.

471
00:28:51,381 --> 00:28:53,180
And you could walk around with
your fucking nose in the air,

472
00:28:53,181 --> 00:28:58,100
like you're better with your slightly
cheaper salmon colored fucking pants.

473
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,060
Okay.

474
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:02,380
I ain't know what the fuck
I'm talking about. So anyways,

475
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:05,470
so I'm not an operating that
whole fucking Rick Ross thing.

476
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,393
You know,

477
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:14,440
I don't know. I'm sure he's got good
music. I don't give a fuck. Okay.

478
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:18,880
How many different ways can you
say I have more shit than you do?

479
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:21,263
You know,

480
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:25,800
like he was bragging about eating
lobster bisque for breakfast.

481
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:27,930
That's what,
that's what new money does.

482
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:34,800
New money gets like fucking DVD.

483
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:38,940
Those DVD players in the head rest
when you drive in like a two seater.

484
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:42,760
Remember that Shit,
I got those best for the people behind me.

485
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:47,200
That's how much money I have.
I can actually waste it.

486
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:50,080
Rather than taking that money and,

487
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:53,470
and adding to my portfolio and be,
and,

488
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:57,610
and truly getting out of my
fucked up neighborhood. I'm
going to do that instead.

489
00:29:57,611 --> 00:30:02,560
That's what new money does straight across
the board. Straight across the board.

490
00:30:02,561 --> 00:30:06,790
You get a redneck, a bunch of money.
You know what's he going to do? Huh?

491
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:09,010
So you going to buy some gold?
Is he going to, you know,

492
00:30:09,011 --> 00:30:11,020
try to invest it and
seeking to start a business.

493
00:30:11,021 --> 00:30:13,900
Now he's gonna put another
three inches on that truck.

494
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:18,550
He's going to get some big fuck and motors
and he's going to fucking drive down

495
00:30:18,551 --> 00:30:22,330
the fucking street. He's gonna
make us fucking engine waterproof,

496
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:26,350
have that goddamn chimney coming up the
side of it so you can go into the swamp

497
00:30:26,351 --> 00:30:28,540
and right back and never
have to fucking stop.

498
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:34,660
That's my Apocalypto fucking truck
out there and he shit happens.

499
00:30:34,661 --> 00:30:37,780
I'll drive over everybody. I'll just
keep going to, I get up North Pole,

500
00:30:37,781 --> 00:30:41,680
make myself fucks.
NOCO that's what new money does,

501
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,150
right? Is that what they do?
I don't know what they do.

502
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:48,240
You know what I do with my money?
I just sit and stare at it.

503
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,470
I Dunno what to do with the
money that I have. I don't,

504
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:56,690
I have no fucking idea what to do with it.

505
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,690
Cause you know what would
wherever you invested,

506
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,790
this is the funny thing
about investing your money.

507
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:05,900
All of it involves you taking your money
and giving it to somebody else and then

508
00:31:05,901 --> 00:31:08,660
going, all right, call you in a month.

509
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:13,550
It's the dumbest Shit I ever did, you
know, and the fucking stock market.

510
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:17,450
That's like getting in the mob. Once
you're in, you can't get out. Oh,

511
00:31:17,451 --> 00:31:19,370
you can get out, you know?
But it's going to cost.

512
00:31:19,371 --> 00:31:22,450
You got to cut your fucking Dick off.

513
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,630
Get your fucking shit back out again.
All right.

514
00:31:25,631 --> 00:31:28,090
I think it's time for some more
advertising. This is great.

515
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:34,360
Hey, do you want to start your own
business? Do you want to make a will?

516
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:38,740
You want to do all of that stuff and
I have to pay a zillion dollars Bullis

517
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,581
before I get going.

518
00:31:39,581 --> 00:31:42,970
You've probably already heard about

527
00:32:11,651 --> 00:32:15,190

No one can sue you when,

face, you actually pay less taxes.

It's what smart people do.
Okay?

530
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:27,700
And I'm not smart so I can't explain it
beyond that. Um, and if you have a family,

531

uh, guess what? You need to make sure that
protected. I don't like that. Guess what?

Like I'm talking down to you
and if you have a family,

533
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:38,290

over 2 million Americans have used legal

they've saved hundreds,

538

00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,930
And I know what you
thinking. Well, I don't,

540
00:32:56,931 --> 00:33:00,560
I need a traditional lawyer to help me

I want to see who the first Monday
morning podcast listener is.

551
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:41,750
Who's going to use legal zoom because
they advertised here and now you're out of

552
00:33:41,751 --> 00:33:44,240
your cubicle and that'd be a great,

553
00:33:44,241 --> 00:33:46,790
that would be a great segment.

554
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:48,923
You know,

555
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:53,860
people talking about how they got
inspired by this filthy podcast and they

556
00:33:53,861 --> 00:33:57,130
somehow got themselves out
of that fucking cubicle.

557
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:02,460
Um, anyways, so I know I'm
drinking water here. All right.

558
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,640
What else can I talk about here?
34 fucking minutes.

559
00:34:05,641 --> 00:34:09,690
And you guys watching any preseason
football? Why not? What are you watching?

560
00:34:09,691 --> 00:34:14,280
Baseball and the six teams that are
competitive. Um, well, speaking of which,

561
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:17,010
I was back in Boston and uh,

562
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:21,270
I try really hard to listen to that
sports talk radio. It's just fuck,

563
00:34:21,271 --> 00:34:22,110
it's impossible.

564
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:28,200
Who listens to actually feel bad for the
on air personalities that they have to

565
00:34:28,201 --> 00:34:31,530
sit there for four fucking hours.
Like,

566
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:35,940
like those legitimate sports talk
radio guys, not the smart ones who go,

567
00:34:35,941 --> 00:34:39,600
all right, it's a sports talk radio
show. But we're going to talk,

568
00:34:39,601 --> 00:34:42,930
we're going to bitch about our wives.
Uh,

569
00:34:42,931 --> 00:34:46,650
we're going to fucking talk about how
we went golfing and we gambled and

570
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:50,250
so-and-so sucked. And I want all
that guy shit and smoke cigars.

571
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:54,870
And then if something interesting is going
on in sports, we'll bring it up, right?

572
00:34:54,871 --> 00:34:58,960
Like Roger Clemens gets
acquitted, you know, by the way,

573
00:34:58,961 --> 00:35:03,360
just cause he got acquitted, he got
acquitted, uh, of uh, lying under oath,

574
00:35:03,361 --> 00:35:07,950
which is one of the most difficult
things to proof. Okay. So,

575
00:35:07,951 --> 00:35:11,340
but if you think that that guy didn't
take a fucking something and stick at,

576
00:35:11,341 --> 00:35:14,220
you know, where and all of a sudden
he's winning those shiny things,

577
00:35:14,221 --> 00:35:17,440
you're out of your fucking mind. See how
he did that? So couldn't get sued. Uh,

578
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:20,280
that's just my opinion.
All right.

579
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:23,760
I actually have a number of people
that I'm watching as a sports fan.

580
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:25,853
You know,

581
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,490
I'm telling you what's his face?
Milky Cabrera.

582
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:32,940
I almost called Paul Versey
and gave him shit like, Hey,

583
00:35:32,941 --> 00:35:35,310
you should've got rid of this guy.
All of a sudden he's coming on.

584
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:40,400
That is the telltale fucking,
I think now of, of of PDS.

585
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:43,470
It's, it's one, it's one of the,

586
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:47,370
it's basically as simple as this because
you don't get fucking gigantic anymore.

587
00:35:47,371 --> 00:35:50,280
I think they got it down with
that little cream that'll solve.

588
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,280
They have like steroid lip, Bob, you
know, you just put it on your bottom.

589
00:35:53,281 --> 00:35:55,890
Let me go [inaudible] and next thing,

590
00:35:57,870 --> 00:36:00,060
next thing you know,
you're fucking running over people.

591
00:36:00,061 --> 00:36:03,090
You turn in the corner and
you're hitting home runs, right.

592
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:07,440
Just pay attention to
people who were okay.

593
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:11,820
And then they started to taper off and
all of a sudden they're fucking great up

594
00:36:11,821 --> 00:36:12,654
telling you,

595
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:14,150
okay,

596
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:18,240
that never happened when I was a kid.
Once you started tapering off, you have,

597
00:36:18,241 --> 00:36:22,230
you were fucking done. I Dunno, maybe,

598
00:36:22,231 --> 00:36:24,780
I'm sure there's always a couple
of examples. Oh, by the way,

599
00:36:24,781 --> 00:36:28,050
one little fucking editor, a note
last week when I brought up the, um,

600
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:32,340
the spurs and the Houston Rockets,
I talk so fast,

601
00:36:32,341 --> 00:36:35,820
it sounded like I was saying that those
were pile on teams. I wasn't saying that,

602
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,390
I wasn't saying that. I
realized that, you know,

603
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:44,230
you know that what's his face Olijahwaun
and they drafted and I obviously real,

604
00:36:44,231 --> 00:36:47,980
if I certainly realize that Tim Duncan
was from their system because the Celtics

605
00:36:47,981 --> 00:36:50,660
were in the lottery that year and
Tim Duncan would have been know,

606
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,730
he would have been great anyway,

607
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:56,080
but he was such a perfect Celtic
yet out fun of Bell Basketball,

608
00:36:56,350 --> 00:37:00,580
boring as hell, kissing the ball off the
glass. Jesus Christ. Fucking Tommy Heisen.

609
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:04,600
Um, and David Robinson, I realized
that those were your guys.

610
00:37:04,601 --> 00:37:08,410
So I w I was trying to say
that those teams I respect,

611
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:12,730
they weren't pile on teams, but
uh, you know, the NBA is a silver,

612
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,910
silver
bunch of little dream teams.

613
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:23,730
Um, what the fuck was,
okay. So I actually, I am,

614
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,480
and I'm not going to
say the person's name,

615
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:29,050
but it is a running back in the NFL

616
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:34,450
and his last name is the name of a bear.

617
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:40,550
And it also talks about
maybe a lady's muff. Um,

618
00:37:40,551 --> 00:37:44,770
they go,
it's just somebody who I saw was,

619
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:49,120
you know, was the man in
college, was not the man in NFL.

620
00:37:49,121 --> 00:37:52,750
And all of a sudden last year I'm watching
him. He's fucking running over people.

621
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:57,960
Rarely you learn how to run over people.
Four years into it, I'm not buying,

622
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:03,280
I'm not buying it. And the last sentence
he plays on the Seattle Seahawks,

623
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:06,000
that's just a misdirection.
Um,

624
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,900
you'd have to be a two year old enough
to figure it out. Um, all right.

625
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:14,920
And that's the deal.
I want to start taking fucking roids.

626
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,530
They make it up for us now. I'm,
I got a whole new bid on it too,

627
00:38:17,531 --> 00:38:18,850
so I can't burn too much of this.

628
00:38:18,851 --> 00:38:22,360
But it's about that synergetics
those fucking old roid it up.

629
00:38:22,361 --> 00:38:23,680
Those guys they're on,
they're on.

630
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:28,630
That's human growth hormone that
those guys are on. You know,

631
00:38:28,631 --> 00:38:32,260
they show him all sad but there
man ticks, tits ticks, man,

632
00:38:32,261 --> 00:38:36,310
tits on this stomach and then the stomach
hanging on their fucking old man ball

633
00:38:36,311 --> 00:38:41,260
bag. And then all of a sudden, like a
month later, that did look like an Adonis.

634
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:45,400
You know the ball bag looks
like a fucking speed bag again.

635
00:38:45,401 --> 00:38:48,790
They'd read their bay, their wife
is over in the corner, right?

636
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:53,920
Just fucking squatting on a
tub of fucking, uh, Ben Gay.

637
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,730
Cause he just tore it up
like it was 1926 again,

638
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:03,810
I want to know why those fucking people
aren't going to get brought before a

639
00:39:03,811 --> 00:39:05,460
grand jury for cheating.

640
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:07,010
Okay.

641
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:11,450
You're going to bring Clemons out there.
Clemens in his big old butt,

642
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:12,623
right?

643
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:16,650
You're going to bring him out there and
question all of the 87 cy young award.

644
00:39:16,651 --> 00:39:21,090
See One past the age of 50.
What about these fucking old guys?

645
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:26,550
All of a sudden they're old fucking heads
in a young body is going to go down to

646
00:39:26,551 --> 00:39:31,440
the Goddamn a fucking, uh,
whatever the clam shack, right?

647
00:39:31,441 --> 00:39:33,660
And just start banging
out fucking 20 year olds.

648
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,080
There's gotta be a price that
you're going to pay for that.

649
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,660
Is God going to allow that?
That can't be a god,

650
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:40,690
okay?

651
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:41,920
How is God allowing them?

652
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,540
That goes against all the laws of nature.

653
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:52,690
There's going to be fucking 80 year
old guys with knocked up 25 year olds,

654
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:56,283
okay?

655
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:58,580
My girlfriend's pregnant,
right?

656
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,790
They're going to be sitting there with
their fucking dentures and they'll write

657
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,500
it up. Bodies trying to talk to
these girls and to get an abortion.

658
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:10,470
You know that I'm telling you,

659
00:40:10,471 --> 00:40:13,770
that's what's going to happen to this
fucking generation. All these guys,

660
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:18,740
these guys who invented the fucking,
uh, youtubes, the, my spaces,

661
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:22,170
the Facebook's, all of them, by the time,
you know, once they figure this shit out,

662
00:40:22,171 --> 00:40:23,530
by the time they get in their [inaudible],

663
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:25,230
they're all going to
be fucking write it up.

664
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,940
They're going to be fucking knock it up.

665
00:40:26,941 --> 00:40:30,450
Fucking 22 year olds and then they're
going to have them like there's somehow

666
00:40:30,451 --> 00:40:35,410
happen CAFTA hadn't whacked.
Can you imagine that? Would you,

667
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:39,340
would you guys, uh, I dunno.

668
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:45,030
Would you do it? Cause they're
going to figure it out. Look it,

669
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,140
I'm 44.

670
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:51,900
I figured by the time I got to start
doing roids I figured right around 65.

671
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:57,180
So that's another 21 years. If
you go back 21 years, what is it?

672
00:40:57,181 --> 00:40:59,160
2012 21 years.

673
00:40:59,161 --> 00:41:02,190
That's 1991 it doesn't
seem that long ago to me.

674
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:06,680
Yeah. Shit. I'm fucking, you know
what the next guys, you guys,

675
00:41:06,681 --> 00:41:09,230
you guys in your twenties, by the
time you guys get to, you know.

676
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:10,730
Okay.

677
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:13,970
Cause if you go back another 20 years,
that'd be 1971.

678
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:17,930
And when you took roids back then,
like literally your balls,

679
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:19,580
they turned to dust.

680
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:24,200
You had like c Cup titties and uh,
you know,

681
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:26,960
you turned into a fucking Werewolf.

682
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:28,340
Okay.

683
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:28,821
Women did.

684
00:41:28,821 --> 00:41:33,260
Women turned in a wherefore Werewolf and
guys became like these fucking psychos.

685
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:36,530
Like women had like
those Merlin Olsen beards

686
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:43,160
and then guys just became these Adonises
who look like, you know, had like,

687
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:48,520
they had no balls anymore
and they had tits. They,

688
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:50,150
they look like if,
uh,

689
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,410
who's that guy in the
fucking Chicago bears?

690
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:58,370
Like if Mike Ditka became
like a transgendered person,

691
00:41:58,371 --> 00:42:00,380
that's what she ended up fucking
look alike. And now you know,

692
00:42:00,381 --> 00:42:01,810
you can't even tell,
look at Milky Cabrera.

693
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,110
That guy didn't look
like he was on anything.

694
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:05,950
So I figured by the time the people
in their twenties you guys get there,

695
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:10,130
it's going to be fucking over.
Like how good you guys are going to look.

696
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:14,260
It's going to be another 60 years
of them practicing facelifts.

697
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:18,410
All right, the probably cure
baldness, they're not even gonna know.

698
00:42:18,411 --> 00:42:21,350
You probably going to
get carded at fucking 68.

699
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:25,390
And that's going to be like
the new thing with like checks,

700
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:29,350
like the new lie guys are gonna tell.
They gonna tell chicks that there,

701
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:33,790
I'm legitimately 28 years old and then
one day you're going to forget to die

702
00:42:33,791 --> 00:42:37,210
your pubes and she's going to see a
couple of fucking silver ones down there.

703
00:42:37,211 --> 00:42:42,211
Or even worse white ones when she's down
there grabbing your fucking prohibition

704
00:42:42,461 --> 00:42:43,810
era.
Fucking Dick.

705
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:47,560
She's kind of flipped the fuck out.

706
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:50,000
Yeah.

707
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,970
Calling up cry. Mandy, what's right.

708
00:42:51,971 --> 00:42:55,160
I found out he's 80.

709
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,630
Well that's okay.
He still has another 70 years left.

710
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:04,000
Right. I remember reading
one time, this guy that said,

711
00:43:04,001 --> 00:43:08,110
these other guys said that the
scientists said that the fucking, uh,

712
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:10,990
that the body is actually the body.

713
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:16,110
My Boston accent coming back
bawd wide body is designed

714
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:21,320
to live 150 years. You know? That's how,

715
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:23,180
that's how difficult life is.

716
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:27,920
They had to have it designed to live
that long because the way nature of beat

717
00:43:27,921 --> 00:43:29,720
the shit out of you when
you lived in a cave,

718
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:33,260
you could only get fucking
30 years out of it, you know?

719
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:37,820
Oh by the fucking way,
not by the way people,

720
00:43:37,821 --> 00:43:39,590
this is by the fucking way,

721
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:44,390
which you know that I'm about ready to
tell you some shit that I believe in baby.

722
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:48,830
Uh, I'm at, I'm at Logan Airport,

723
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,870
Edward Lawrence Logan Airport.
I finally learned that.

724
00:43:53,890 --> 00:43:57,800
But Logan Airport is a,
as named after Eddie Lawrence Logan,

725
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:01,850
who was some sort of fucking a military
person who fought in the Spanish

726
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:04,820
American war and that they used to have
a statue of him before they had to make

727
00:44:04,821 --> 00:44:08,450
the airport even bigger because
people are fucked it, you know,

728
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:11,250
so why go there?
Okay.

729
00:44:11,251 --> 00:44:14,820
And I go through security and they
got the giant fucking microwave.

730
00:44:14,821 --> 00:44:19,080
They want me to stand in with my
legs spread doing the Jay z symbol.

731
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:24,240
Right.
Well the Sammy Hagar from the 51 50 tour,

732
00:44:24,810 --> 00:44:26,610
depending on what generation you are,
a business,

733
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:30,840
depending on what side of the tracks you
from. All right. This podcast is for,

734
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:35,400
um, I'm sure someone in the
village people did it there.

735
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:38,910
You see that reached out to
the gay community swell guy.

736
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:44,160
Pat Myself on the back here. So
anyways, I say I'm not fucking,

737
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:49,320
you know, I'm opting out. All right,
sir. Can you go stand over there?

738
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:51,120
I didn't even like standing over there.

739
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:53,970
I used to work in a fucking dental
office when I would take an x ray,

740
00:44:53,971 --> 00:44:56,280
somebody's tooth,
one little fucking thing.

741
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:59,130
And we put that camera right
up to the side of the jaw.

742
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:04,310
We've put a led vest over all their
vitals right down to their dick or who ha.

743
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:07,350
And then I left the fucking room,

744
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:11,460
stood behind a wall that had lead in
it and I pressed the fucking button.

745
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:16,170
Now I'm supposed to stand there.
You know,

746
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:18,210
like I'm just going into prison.
They do everything,

747
00:45:18,211 --> 00:45:21,090
but you have your bend over and spread
your fucking ass cheeks. I'm like,

748
00:45:21,091 --> 00:45:24,720
I'm not fucking doing it. And I know
what people are saying. Well Bill,

749
00:45:24,721 --> 00:45:28,560
you talk on his cell phone,
right? That's fucking radiation.

750
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:32,670
You fly in an airplane, right?
That's fucking radiation.

751
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,110
I understand that.

752
00:45:34,111 --> 00:45:38,640
I am getting radiated throughout the
course of the day in the way I live my

753
00:45:38,641 --> 00:45:41,730
life. I understand that. Okay.

754
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:46,560
But I don't need to get extra radiated.
So if there's a way to opt out,

755
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:51,750
believe me, if there was a way to opt
out of flying on a fucking airplane,

756
00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:55,770
a viable way,
aside from just saying,

757
00:45:55,771 --> 00:45:56,940
fuck this business,

758
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:01,230
I'm going to buy an old bus and just
drive around and that'll be my miserable

759
00:46:01,231 --> 00:46:03,810
life,
I would do it.

760
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:07,170
But the fact that I can just
stand there for an extra five, 10,

761
00:46:07,171 --> 00:46:09,990
15 fucking minutes,
you know,

762
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:14,610
and rather than stand in that microwave,
I could just go over and just have some,

763
00:46:14,611 --> 00:46:18,570
you know,
sort of cute male person,

764
00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:21,120
pat down my ass with
the back of his pants,

765
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:31,770
the sensitive areas. Uh, I would much
rather do that. Okay. And then, you know,

766
00:46:31,771 --> 00:46:33,690
people giving me shit about it,
saying it's stupid,

767
00:46:33,691 --> 00:46:37,320
it's fucking pointless and
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Well, so anyway, anyways,

768
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:41,790
I met Eddie Lawrence, Logan
Airport, Edward Lawrence, and um,

769
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:44,640
I'm standing and I'm waiting,
you know,

770
00:46:44,641 --> 00:46:48,300
and whenever you want to get fucking
padded down, they wait for fucking ever.

771
00:46:48,301 --> 00:46:49,890
They'd make it take extra long.

772
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,770
I'm convinced that they do it
just so you just say, fuck it.

773
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,800
I'm going to go into the toaster.
All right. But I don't give a shit.

774
00:46:55,801 --> 00:46:59,700
I was get to the airport early because I
know the game that they're running over

775
00:46:59,701 --> 00:47:03,600
there. Oh, the lovely Nia.
Everybody. Oh, are you?

776
00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:07,440
Come over here and talking to
the microphone. How you been?

777
00:47:07,441 --> 00:47:10,800
We couldn't hear you last week. Oh,
I've been great. Thanks for asking.

778
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:15,840
Great to be back. Are you reading
from a script? Oh, who just woke up?

779
00:47:15,990 --> 00:47:19,500
I am. Great. Thank you for
asking. Where's the Real Nia?

780
00:47:19,501 --> 00:47:22,530
Who is a sexy robot that was replaced?
Listen to this shit.

781
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:24,240
I'm telling you this story about,
you know,

782
00:47:24,241 --> 00:47:28,390
I always opt out of doing the Jay z thing
where they radiate everything but you

783
00:47:28,391 --> 00:47:30,010
fucking taint at

784
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:32,500
the airport, Jay Z. Yeah. You
know what? You're fucking,

785
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:36,910
you have your hands like the
whole aside. Oh, isn't, isn't
that what it is? Yeah. So,

786
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,590
um, I'm standing there waiting, right? And
I'm staring down some baldheaded Douche.

787
00:47:41,591 --> 00:47:44,920
Who knows? First of all, they always
have some chick there and she just goes,

788
00:47:44,921 --> 00:47:48,260
you know, what are they, what are
they, what do they say? A male.

789
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:54,130
What does what they say? Male pat down
or whatever they say male support.

790
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:59,320
I'll five. Whatever the fuck they say.
And it's typical chick voice where it,

791
00:47:59,321 --> 00:48:03,370
it can, it can only carry
what? What is, what is that?
You guys are good at yelling.

792
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:07,900
Yes, we are like, no one hears it.

793
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:12,400
No one hears it. All right, go ahead.
You know I've got the microphone away.

794
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:16,390
Yell male support aisle for yell at. I
want to hear it. I want to hear it. So

795
00:48:18,550 --> 00:48:22,780
that's good. That has a sense of
fucking her. Just say all right then.

796
00:48:22,781 --> 00:48:24,690
You know what?
They don't put their fucking Hartnett.

797
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:26,930
They just go a mail pack down.

798
00:48:27,790 --> 00:48:30,990
He's screaming like there's something
going down or whatever. Yeah,

799
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,230
but you got to communicate.

800
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:35,890
You've got to communicate to those
bald fatties guys down there.

801
00:48:35,891 --> 00:48:39,400
We're gonna put the back of their hands
on my ash there. Well they, they don't,

802
00:48:39,401 --> 00:48:40,121
they don't get it.

803
00:48:40,121 --> 00:48:43,410
They have a whole little system that
they're talking to each other that you use

804
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:46,390
fucking side. Do you want here?
Not Yours obviously. All right,

805
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:48,900
well listen to this shit. Listen
to the shit. Wait a sec, let me,

806
00:48:48,910 --> 00:48:52,870
let me get to the point. Timeout.
Timeout. Get another microphone.

807
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:55,300
Get another microphone.
Hang on a second.

808
00:48:55,301 --> 00:48:58,810
We're actually going to pause the podcast,
the podcast.

809
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:03,910
All right, so the magic of hitting pause
or something I never do on this thing.

810
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,040
Actually hit pause there. Uh,
so anyways, this is the deal.

811
00:49:06,041 --> 00:49:08,860
So I'm going through security.
Yeah. After all these people

812
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:12,190
[inaudible] you already getting
rid of each gene anyways man.

813
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:16,920
So why not stand there and have literally
have your entire body budget tank lit

814
00:49:16,921 --> 00:49:17,550
up,
right?

815
00:49:17,550 --> 00:49:22,550
So fucking standing there and this
lady is going to nail supportive,

816
00:49:23,490 --> 00:49:26,940
you know, and I'm like,
they're not hearing you.
They're not here. I know that.

817
00:49:26,941 --> 00:49:29,300
She goes, sir, could you stand over?
There I go. I'm going to stand right.

818
00:49:29,310 --> 00:49:32,730
And you'd watch my wallet. Okay. You can
stand right there. All right. So anyways,

819
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:38,100
this fucking, this Asian
kid comes up. Fat Asian Kid.

820
00:49:38,130 --> 00:49:42,090
One of the rare ones. Why? Why? Like
like, like, like, like a white elephant.

821
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:46,290
Why is that relevant? Because Asian
people in great shape, they eat great.

822
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:48,390
I don't know what it is.
There were fucking awesome shape.

823
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:51,480
There's every once in awhile you see one,
you see a fat age and you're like,

824
00:49:51,481 --> 00:49:53,700
Holy Shit.
Right?

825
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:57,300
I don't mean like he's a fucking
did it on purpose to sumo wrestle.

826
00:49:57,390 --> 00:50:01,530
This is just a fact. Sumo, sumo,
Samoan, whatever the fuck it is.

827
00:50:01,531 --> 00:50:05,970
This fat Asian kid comes up and relevant
to the story, but it is for the comedy.

828
00:50:05,971 --> 00:50:10,230
It is. Oh, I see. Alright,
sorry. Come on. Listen,

829
00:50:10,231 --> 00:50:13,300
I trashed waspy fucking white
people on this. Oh, you did?

830
00:50:13,301 --> 00:50:18,090
You're talk about Nantucket. Yes I did. Oh
boy. Oh boy. Yeah. See you just hate him.

831
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:23,340
Hate anybody. I don't have hate in
my heart. All right, shut up. Listen,

832
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:26,340
so this, this, this, this person.

833
00:50:26,370 --> 00:50:29,570
This fat comes up.
All right.

834
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:34,970
And The lady in lady, she goes, hi. He
couldn't even here. He goes, he's like,

835
00:50:34,971 --> 00:50:39,530
what does it, hey. He's like, what?
And I want to be like, how old are you?

836
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:42,320
That's what the fuck she's trying to say.
And he goes,

837
00:50:42,321 --> 00:50:46,160
13 and she goes, all
right, come over here.

838
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:49,250
And she had them go through
the old school one. Yeah.

839
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:55,760
So basically you want me to stand in
something that could kill a 13 year old.

840
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,040
That's what the fuck I'm supposed to do.

841
00:50:58,070 --> 00:51:02,450
You know why the white way on the way
out on the way back twice. Two Times,

842
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:06,230
two times that four times a month I'm
going to stand in this thing that can kill

843
00:51:06,231 --> 00:51:11,100
a 13 year old. I'm sure I can't kill
it. Maybe like can affect his like um,

844
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:15,620
puberty or his growth or something.
I think women that is Dick.

845
00:51:15,650 --> 00:51:16,700
I have a dick to what?

846
00:51:16,701 --> 00:51:21,110
Cause my Dick's old now
you're taking old 30 grown.

847
00:51:21,111 --> 00:51:23,660
Your shoulder are like down
between your knees cubes.

848
00:51:23,661 --> 00:51:28,160
No one cares about it anymore. Like
it's just kinda like out of commission.

849
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:32,840
I think women can avoid that full body
thing by saying that they're pregnant and

850
00:51:32,841 --> 00:51:33,591
they won't let you go.

851
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:35,720
They won't make you go in there
if you say that you're pregnant.

852
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:38,300
Women always have the,

853
00:51:38,301 --> 00:51:42,650
I'm just a girl excuse that's not get out
of this a girl twins that guys have to

854
00:51:42,651 --> 00:51:46,130
do. But stick with the thing
here. If that fucking thing.

855
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:47,810
How old are you?

856
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:52,970
13 get over here at him from getting like
chest hair or something. But you, yeah,

857
00:51:52,971 --> 00:51:54,740
you're old.
Like they don't care about you.

858
00:51:54,741 --> 00:51:58,310
It's the youth of tomorrow that we're
concerned about or there you go.

859
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:02,780
I sat there and I, I I man, I almost,

860
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:06,590
I'm not even, it's, this isn't about
me whether I feel like I'm older, not,

861
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:10,380
I know I'm old, I'm talking about bed. Um,

862
00:52:11,450 --> 00:52:15,680
I almost high five myself. I
actually, I burst out laughing,

863
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:20,470
extra laughed cause I wanted fucking
marry mumbles to be like, eh.

864
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:23,150
It Mary Mama. Yeah. What
are you laughing at?

865
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:25,280
I'm laughing cause I'm
doing the right thing.

866
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:28,610
If that fucking thing isn't
safe for a God damn 30,

867
00:52:28,611 --> 00:52:32,450
I could see if it was a bit and making
some little baby crawls through there.

868
00:52:33,310 --> 00:52:37,730
It's a fucking kid. Probably knows more
about computers than I do and they like,

869
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:42,290
yeah, no, don't think so. Come over
here. All Right Nia, you know what?

870
00:52:42,291 --> 00:52:43,040
It's time for.

871
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:47,810
It's time for some questions up
bu then we can wrap this up. Oh,

872
00:52:47,811 --> 00:52:49,520
first of all,
GI bill.

873
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:52,820
I enjoyed your standup special
on Netflix Canada so much.

874
00:52:52,850 --> 00:52:55,880
Are you coming up there? Actually I'm
not. I still updates in the states.

875
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:57,890
Don't you ever go to Canada?
Oh No.

876
00:52:57,891 --> 00:53:01,570
You've got to Montreal a couple of times
when I go to Canada because I didn't

877
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:05,900
like the way they were portrayed in all
those Michael Moore movies like they are

878
00:53:05,901 --> 00:53:07,580
just so god damn perfect up there.

879
00:53:07,581 --> 00:53:11,330
Despite the fact that they can't even
handle losing a fucking hockey game. Oh,

880
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:14,330
that's down every Starbucks or,
that was a kind of a,

881
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:16,610
is that something that
Canadians do often though?

882
00:53:16,611 --> 00:53:20,600
Is that a normal thing in Canada
for the the riots to happen?

883
00:53:20,610 --> 00:53:24,800
I never pretend to think that I know
what a Canadian person is thinking. Oh,

884
00:53:24,801 --> 00:53:25,800
you wouldn't?
I wouldn't.

885
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:26,401
Okay.

886
00:53:26,401 --> 00:53:29,610
That's an arrogant thing to do and you
want to be ashamed of yourself and you

887
00:53:29,611 --> 00:53:32,660
should apologize. I love Canada.
I have only been to Manchuria.

888
00:53:32,670 --> 00:53:35,970
I've only been to Montreal.
I've been there twice. It
was amazing. It was lovely.

889
00:53:35,971 --> 00:53:39,780
The people were awesome. And the
last strip clubs. I went to England.

890
00:53:39,781 --> 00:53:43,230
I only went to London and they'd be
like, Oh, I love England. All right,

891
00:53:43,231 --> 00:53:47,040
well then get out there and muck it
up. Get out there in the sticks. Fine.

892
00:53:47,041 --> 00:53:50,360
I love people who are too dumb to live
in London, living light to go to Toronto,

893
00:53:50,370 --> 00:53:53,040
sit next to one of them was some fish and
chips hanging out of his mouth and you

894
00:53:53,041 --> 00:53:56,850
tell me how much you like it.
You get to the ugly seedier side,

895
00:53:57,630 --> 00:54:00,840
the CD and r really seedy
underbelly like we're going to,

896
00:54:00,841 --> 00:54:05,010
Australia coming up are going to be to
and sick suddenly the shiniest of all

897
00:54:05,011 --> 00:54:08,450
shiny cities over there and that's how
you're going to judge us. Oiliness Sydney.

898
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:08,910
Yeah.

899
00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:12,540
Rather than going out to the fucking
outback with all those toothless people

900
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:16,470
playing that long horn. That doesn't sound
good. Right? Digital. He did you redo?

901
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:20,220
All right. I'm going to be in
Orlando, home of Disney world,

902
00:54:20,250 --> 00:54:25,080
September 7th eighth and ninth
then I'm going to be in Charlotte,

903
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:29,270
the comedy zone,
September 13th 14th and 15th it's now,

904
00:54:29,271 --> 00:54:33,270
these are all the comedy clubs. What
date was that again for Charlotte? 13th.

905
00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:37,110
14th and 15th of
September. Oh, okay, great.

906
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:41,820
Um, people that want to go
to that. Cool. And then, uh,

907
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:46,080
I'll be at Carolina in New York City,
the one I had to make up. That's right.

908
00:54:46,081 --> 00:54:49,110
I had to reschedule that because I had
that, I booked the pilot of the news,

909
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:54,000
the reboot of zoom, zoom, zoom,

910
00:54:54,001 --> 00:54:58,530
zoom, zoom. That's a
Caroline's is September,

911
00:54:58,530 --> 00:55:01,350
2021 22 and I believe 23.
It's a Thursday through Sunday.

912
00:55:01,351 --> 00:55:05,270
There's only $3 and be gone a lot.
Awesome. Yeah, we've had enough.

913
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:08,900
We've had enough of
which a lot of time lot.

914
00:55:08,901 --> 00:55:12,060
It's a lot to say it like that when you
go out of La and it's a high amount of

915
00:55:12,061 --> 00:55:15,510
time. It's been great. It's
been good by Nini. Fine.

916
00:55:17,930 --> 00:55:21,930
All right. Uh, funeral music.
Uh, I seen him, you know,

917
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:27,430
relative passed away how she
picked out her, her, her, her, uh,

918
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:32,970
our best funerals ever. Rather than
just being sad. It was like, Oh,

919
00:55:33,010 --> 00:55:37,080
you've got to feel more of a personality.
Who's awesome anyways?

920
00:55:37,081 --> 00:55:41,940
Hey bill funeral music shirt. You can
have some ac DC. Hey, it's your funeral,

921
00:55:41,941 --> 00:55:46,620
right. Um, I did the music for my dad's
funeral three years ago. Weird. Huh?

922
00:55:46,650 --> 00:55:50,520
I was 25 at the time. Dude. You
manned up. Yeah, you did. You end up,

923
00:55:50,521 --> 00:55:54,720
cause that's what happens when the older
generation dies is the younger one has

924
00:55:54,721 --> 00:55:56,610
to step up is always,

925
00:55:56,630 --> 00:55:59,310
there's always a person who steps up and
then there's the people who just can't

926
00:55:59,311 --> 00:56:03,870
deal. Then there's the selfish people like
I can, I have a rock throwing festival.

927
00:56:03,871 --> 00:56:07,260
I'm going to you handle the pain.

It's spelled G. A. U. D. E. T. E. I'm
sure I've heard it. Gow Dare Tech. No,

934
00:56:35,051 --> 00:56:36,790
I don't know what the updates,
I don't even know what that is.

935
00:56:36,791 --> 00:56:40,600
And a couple more rock ones that I
can't remember and no religious shit in

936
00:56:40,601 --> 00:56:44,290
between. That's fucking,
that's how I'm going out.

937
00:56:45,310 --> 00:56:47,930
Yeah. You know what? I'm
going to go to that damn a,

938

you to go to legal zoom.com write up my

939
00:56:52,511 --> 00:56:57,140

of it. You're going, whoa. Black minute.

940
00:56:57,390 --> 00:57:01,420
Bamba lamb. Whoa. One more thing
I got to, I got to read here.

941
00:57:01,590 --> 00:57:03,190
He voice and then we're done.

942
00:57:03,191 --> 00:57:07,330
I think with the advertising stuff for
two quickies in the end he voice, oh hey,

943
00:57:07,331 --> 00:57:10,210
if this is another a great way to start
a business where you know you still,

944
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:12,970
you know you don't have an office but
you want to make it sound like you do.

945
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:16,270
You don't have money for 58 cell phones,
but you could have,

946
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:18,430
you know a bunch of different cell phone.
Oh yes.

947
00:57:18,431 --> 00:57:21,340
He was showing me the website
to, yeah, that's very cool.

948
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:25,660
I keep saying viral phone numbers. It's
not that viral, not viral. What is,

949
00:57:25,661 --> 00:57:27,400
what is the proper kid terminology?

950
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:32,500
Tell me what do you have the
proper terminology for what now?

951
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:36,010
For phone numbers letter.
Then you're in the air. Man,

952
00:57:36,011 --> 00:57:39,280
but they're not there and they go into
your phone, man, I don't know what it is.

953
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:41,840
Virtual virtual phone numbers.

954
00:57:41,870 --> 00:57:44,770
You could literally have like
fucking 15 phone numbers.

955
00:57:44,771 --> 00:57:45,820
They all ring to your phone.

956
00:57:46,090 --> 00:57:49,990
They got these professional voice actors.

957
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:52,750
They will act like they're
your, you're sexy. You know,

seven. He's on top. Oh, I see. Right.

960
00:58:00,161 --> 00:58:02,440
You get it.
He voice your mobile phone at work.

961
00:58:02,650 --> 00:58:05,230
One of the great eve voice
features his music on hold.

962
00:58:05,410 --> 00:58:07,690
Make your business seem more
professional as the voice.

963
00:58:07,691 --> 00:58:10,570
We'll treat your clients and
customers to music on hold. Hey,

some giant building.

965
00:58:13,310 --> 00:58:16,480
As you're sitting there sneaking around
and you can paint and your cubicle,

966
00:58:17,170 --> 00:58:20,650
right. You go to legal zoom,
you get yourself incorporated.
You're on your way out.

967
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:24,330
Yeah. It's like the greatest scape you'd
digging the tunnel. Tremendous. Um,

968
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:27,970
you can even set up a voice to run
promotional advertisement for your company

969
00:58:28,270 --> 00:58:32,020
while people are on or are on hold
instead of music. Yeah, that's good.

970
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:36,550
Like coming up at Joe Blow's Frisbee
fest. You can, I have your toes painted.

971
00:58:36,551 --> 00:58:40,660
Sorry.

which is perfect for doctors,
lawyers, real estate agents,

973
00:58:43,691 --> 00:58:47,970
hiring managers in any other
professional discussing contracts. Um,

You just press star two to
start and tars start to to stop.

976
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,130
It's easier than me reading this copy.
Perfect.

977
00:58:57,131 --> 00:59:00,790
If you're driving and you can't write
something important down eve voice makes

978
00:59:00,791 --> 00:59:04,450
your life easier and seem more
professional for free, for free.

979
00:59:04,451 --> 00:59:09,160
Six month trial for six months.
That's pretty good.

980
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:12,990
Do it. Yeah. They have a cat on it.
You can do like a conference call.

You can have up to 90 people on hold if

You can use this for good or evil.

984
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:27,350
Just like the Internet.

985
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:32,690
You can learn about turtles
or watch something you
shouldn't have seen. You know,

986
00:59:32,750 --> 00:59:33,890
this is same thing with the voice.

987
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:38,810
They are giving you the option to start
your business and get out of I get out

988
00:59:38,811 --> 00:59:42,440
of your cubicle and start living your
dream. Or you can use it for evil.

989
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:44,120
You know,

990
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:47,000
I don't think that's probably a start
a whole nother family or whatever.

991
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:51,440
And he got six months to do it
with a free six month trial,

992
00:59:51,441 --> 00:59:56,441
go to www dot [inaudible] dot com slash
bill burr or go to the banner on my

993
00:59:56,631 --> 01:00:00,620
podcast page at [inaudible]
Dot Com and, uh, get out from
under it. Everybody. Yeah.

994
01:00:00,621 --> 01:00:04,430
You know what, that's, that's
good even for so that way.

995
01:00:04,450 --> 01:00:09,140
Is this a thing where you can
give somebody your actual, no,

996
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:12,190
it's not, you're not giving me a number
and they don't have your real numbers,

997
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:13,160
but they don't have your reality,

998
01:00:14,030 --> 01:00:16,760
but it brings kind of phone and you
have the option of turning it on,

999
01:00:16,761 --> 01:00:17,241
turn it off.

1000
01:00:17,241 --> 01:00:21,170
It's like it's some star trek stuff
and it gets you out of your cubicle.

1001
01:00:21,171 --> 01:00:24,770
So you can avoid situations like this.
Look at this right back to the podcast.

1002
01:00:24,770 --> 01:00:28,220
That right? There was a
professional segue, um,

1003
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:31,910
office rumor and Mary, uh, Hey, bill,

1004
01:00:31,970 --> 01:00:34,760
a great show and all that Bs.
Anyways,

1005
01:00:34,761 --> 01:00:39,761
I came in to the office where I work on
Friday and my boss came up to me very

1006
01:00:39,771 --> 01:00:44,750
angrily and said,
you up to something staring in his face.

1007
01:00:44,810 --> 01:00:48,500
See he voice, legal zoom. You get
off from under this. Um, he goes,

1008
01:00:48,501 --> 01:00:50,620
I didn't know what the hell he,
I don't know what.

1009
01:00:50,630 --> 01:00:55,010
I didn't know what the hell he meant. So
I said, no. He said he'd been watching me.

1010
01:00:56,270 --> 01:00:59,600
That's what he basically that you walk in
on a Friday, you site for your weekend.

1011
01:00:59,601 --> 01:01:02,960
This guy comes up and goes, you up to
something. You say no, and he's like,

1012
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:05,150
I'm watching you and walks away.

1013
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:08,120
You just have to sit
there and take it right.

1014
01:01:09,050 --> 01:01:11,960
Slink back into your God damn cubicle.
He goes,

1015
01:01:11,961 --> 01:01:15,530
I found out later that everyone in the
office thinks I fucked the secretary.

1016
01:01:15,531 --> 01:01:19,250
Mary. I didn't, Ooh. He
goes, I didn't, I asked,

1017
01:01:19,670 --> 01:01:22,820
I asked Mary about it and
she said that she made it up.

1018
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:27,200
Don't guys usually do that? He
goes, I thought it was sexy.

1019
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:31,980
Oh Geez. Jumping right into this one
and then they really fucked. Yeah.

1020
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:36,810
I had always admired Mary from afar and
thought she was a good match for me.

1021
01:01:37,740 --> 01:01:40,950
I really want to date her,
but I fee you want to date this girl.

1022
01:01:40,951 --> 01:01:44,130
Just put her on the desk and Banger.
You're already getting fucked over for it.

1023
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:48,180
You might as well this isn't the mother
your kids do. This trick is a psycho.

1024
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:49,950
Stop it already.

1025
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:54,810
What? You are such an asshole when
it comes to let me finish. Let me,

1026
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:58,470
let me let me show or asserting her
sexuality and you're such a fucking

1027
01:01:58,471 --> 01:02:01,800
hypocrite about it because
he'll love that shit. Okay,

1028
01:02:01,890 --> 01:02:04,830
so don't sit there on like
some sort of moral high horse.

1029
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:07,920
This is the mother of your children.
This is how women should act.

1030
01:02:07,950 --> 01:02:11,190
Madonna and whore like
you know what I'm saying?

1031
01:02:12,330 --> 01:02:16,890
I had done, yeah. Just say bitch,
please bitch please. There we go.

1032
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:20,010
All right. Coming soon to a podcast.
That's right. When are you going

1033
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:23,610
to start the bitch, please? I'm going to
start and I got a lot of shit going on.

1034
01:02:23,630 --> 01:02:26,310
Yes, it's coming soon. The
bitch please podcast. Yeah,

1035
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:29,940
my own and my own podcast and you should.
You should. Now that I've said the name,

1036
01:02:29,941 --> 01:02:34,140
you should definitely go out and start
the website or anything. Anyways,

1037
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:37,800
he goes, he goes, I really want to
date her, but I fear that if I do,

1038
01:02:37,801 --> 01:02:42,540
my boss will fire me or otherwise hurt
my career because he is strongly against

1039
01:02:42,570 --> 01:02:45,870
office relationships. What should I do?
All right. First of all, right there.

1040
01:02:45,871 --> 01:02:47,610
That's why you need to get
out from underneath this dick,

1041
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:48,780
because he's literally saying,

1042
01:02:48,781 --> 01:02:53,190
who can fuck who this guy is on a total
power trip? That's a normal policy.

1043
01:02:53,191 --> 01:02:57,240
And workplaces, they frown on
interpersonal relations up to something.

1044
01:02:57,300 --> 01:03:01,570
I'm watching you. That's a total. Now
j Edgar Hoover Shit. That's like, oh,

1045
01:03:01,571 --> 01:03:03,510
go to HR and talk.
You know what he should have done?

1046
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:07,020
He should have kicked him in the
balls from behind when he walked away.

1047
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:11,140
Get that nice sound. Yeah, that
nice sign of a foot hitting the,

1048
01:03:11,310 --> 01:03:15,030
the MC hammer part of
the selects. So Mary, Oh,

1049
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:19,320
you just tore me a new fucking asshole.
This is what I'm talking about Mia. What?

1050
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:22,560
That chick is fucked in the head.
Why she made,

1051
01:03:22,561 --> 01:03:26,400
she made a joke of inappropriate joke
that got around absolutely asserting

1052
01:03:26,401 --> 01:03:30,030
yourself sexually is that she just comes
up to him and asks him out or whatever.

1053
01:03:30,090 --> 01:03:33,180
I don't have a fucking problem
with that to walk around.

1054
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:35,490
You know what you want to
talk about fucking hypocrite.

1055
01:03:35,610 --> 01:03:37,130
You're a fucking hypocrite.
Why?

1056
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:39,540
Cause if he sat there and he
said that he fucked somebody,

1057
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:44,280
he didn't fucking the office. How
would you look at that? Uh, exactly.

1058
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:48,570
Okay. This chick is doing, she has
some sort of, she has some sort of,

1059
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:50,400
this chick is a fucking psycho.

1060
01:03:50,401 --> 01:03:53,010
You don't have to go that far
to be like they're a psycho.

1061
01:03:53,011 --> 01:03:55,530
But I gave you did you do me?
It's a major red flag.

1062
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:57,780
It's a decent point because
the Afa man said, oh,

1063
01:03:57,781 --> 01:03:59,620
I could down to me it's a decent point.
Stuff.

1064
01:03:59,630 --> 01:04:03,360
Pat me on the fucking head to break
Goddamn head and I gave you a fucking

1065
01:04:03,361 --> 01:04:06,510
example and you, you, you actually
shut you off for half a second.

1066
01:04:06,511 --> 01:04:10,170
Which is not an easy thing to do.
I am saying that it was a good point.

1067
01:04:10,171 --> 01:04:14,070
Put your eyebrows down. All right.
Now your eyes. See what you did.

1068
01:04:14,190 --> 01:04:18,870
That's classic female shit there. See
what you did. No, no, no. Your behavior.

1069
01:04:18,871 --> 01:04:23,610
Why do, why am I said what happened
for your classic overreaction and like,

1070
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:28,320
you know, because you assumed
that me saying that this
chick is a fucking psycho.

1071
01:04:28,510 --> 01:04:30,210
You immediately assumed that I was,

1072
01:04:30,211 --> 01:04:34,110
I was saying that women can
assert themselves sexually. Okay.

1073
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:37,860
And then I turned it around and I gave you
an example. I am pointing, you're away.

1074
01:04:37,861 --> 01:04:38,880
You better put it away.

1075
01:04:39,090 --> 01:04:43,460
I'll do the Bill Clinton fist out of
not have sex in proper relations. Um,

1076
01:04:43,530 --> 01:04:48,330
because bill about, let
me finish. All right.

1077
01:04:48,390 --> 01:04:49,500
Then I gave you the example.

1078
01:04:49,501 --> 01:04:52,320
What if some guy said he fucked
you and he didn't fuck you.

1079
01:04:52,950 --> 01:04:56,010
What would you think about that guy?
Always just asserting himself sexually.

1080
01:04:56,011 --> 01:05:00,360
Is he hot? What's the, what's
the stuff you suck? Suck on
with the joke. All right.

1081
01:05:00,361 --> 01:05:04,950
All right. All right. Yes,
I get your point. I get your
point. Yes it would. No, no,

1082
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:08,310
that's not good enough. What do you
want me to say? Cause you're going,

1083
01:05:08,430 --> 01:05:11,130
I get your point. That's a decent
point. You Pat me on the fucking head.

1084
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:13,020
I made a great God damn coin point.

1085
01:05:13,021 --> 01:05:16,410
After you sat there and you flipped out
on me calling me a hypocrite and all

1086
01:05:16,411 --> 01:05:18,910
this bullshit. You want your new
little bitch please fucking rant.

1087
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:20,081
And I came back.

1088
01:05:20,081 --> 01:05:23,950
Now you actually understand where I'm
coming from because you fucking leaped off

1089
01:05:23,951 --> 01:05:27,040
the got you just took a little thing
and you ran with it because you watch,

1090
01:05:27,041 --> 01:05:31,180
we tell some jokes for fucking 10 years.
Um,

1091
01:05:32,950 --> 01:05:36,520
I mean you're right. I am right.

1092
01:05:36,550 --> 01:05:40,450
It would not be and it's killing me to
say, okay, if we're got to do that Fellas,

1093
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:42,550
that's how you do it. You don't
let them warm or the way out of it.

1094
01:05:42,551 --> 01:05:43,360
That's what she did.

1095
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:45,730
She tried like three different
techniques of patting me on the head.

1096
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:46,720
It's decent point.

1097
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:49,510
And then you did the other thing
when you knew that I was right.

1098
01:05:49,510 --> 01:05:51,640
Then you put your eyebrows
up like, yes, you're right.

1099
01:05:51,641 --> 01:05:54,050
Like I'm being an
overbearing asshole because I

1100
01:05:55,700 --> 01:06:00,040
know when one of these things, because
I said, I said it was a good point,

1101
01:06:00,070 --> 01:06:02,900
so I don't know what more
you want from me, but yeah.

1102
01:06:03,130 --> 01:06:06,670
Do you remember you don't remember your
Newt Rockne speech she gave fucking 90

1103
01:06:06,671 --> 01:06:09,910
seconds ago about an asshole.
I was screaming and yelling and all that,

1104
01:06:10,150 --> 01:06:12,490
and then when you find out I'm right,
you go, okay, that's a decent point.

1105
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:15,310
You don't think that
that's, you know? Yeah.

1106
01:06:15,311 --> 01:06:18,660
I think it's me giving me be like if I
took my barefoot right now and I just

1107
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:22,450
know she right in the face with it and
then you went over the side of the bed,

1108
01:06:22,451 --> 01:06:26,650
hit your head, started to cry. This,
you said that I was wrong. And I said,

1109
01:06:26,651 --> 01:06:30,190
all right, you're right. Maybe I pushed
it too hard. This rights. You're right.

1110
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:32,770
That should not kicked you.
All of this is besides the point.

1111
01:06:32,771 --> 01:06:35,510
The point is he actually likes this woman.
No,

1112
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:38,800
he's trying to figure out what he not,
no. See once again the last second,

1113
01:06:38,801 --> 01:06:41,780
she tried to warm her way out
to just see that. Anything,

1114
01:06:41,830 --> 01:06:46,360
I'm just trying to get back
to the top aside. The point,
it is a beside the point.

1115
01:06:46,361 --> 01:06:48,700
You just read me the riot act
and you will fucking wrong.

1116
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:52,750
I don't know that I was completely wrong.
I don't know.

1117
01:06:52,751 --> 01:06:54,430
Why aren't you making eye contact anymore?

1118
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:57,160
I don't think that I was completely wrong.

1119
01:06:57,190 --> 01:07:01,540
I just think that you brought up a good
point that I hadn't considered passing

1120
01:07:01,590 --> 01:07:04,960
hatred. Of course. What else do I have
to judge you on paths, Beth course.

1121
01:07:04,961 --> 01:07:06,490
I judge you. I'm not
saying that's wrong. You.

1122
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:09,730
My entire life is judging
people on past behavior. Okay,

1123
01:07:09,850 --> 01:07:12,970
but when you find out you're wrong, you
just say, yeah, you know what I was wrong,

1124
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:16,420
which I do and you never give
me fucking credit for when?

1125
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:20,930
When do you ever say I was
wrong? Whatever. You do
something where I didn't know.

1126
01:07:21,010 --> 01:07:25,610
You come in and you snuggle up beside me
and you make a little joke or you like

1127
01:07:25,611 --> 01:07:28,270
to try to get me wrong and
I'm going to work on it. No,

1128
01:07:28,271 --> 01:07:29,890
that's not what happens at all.

1129
01:07:29,891 --> 01:07:33,550
You'd try to cute your way out of it and
like charm and do a little funny dance

1130
01:07:33,551 --> 01:07:37,570
and hey everybody, I'm Billy. Okay. You
know what is? You know what? And that's

1131
01:07:40,420 --> 01:07:43,900
some of the times I do that. I do admit
that when I'm seriously fucking wrong,

1132
01:07:44,610 --> 01:07:47,990
what I'm saying, I see wrong. You do
apologize. That's true. And I say, Oh,

1133
01:07:47,991 --> 01:07:51,790
we'll work on it. Right? What'd
he go? Jesus Christ. It's
like police fucking teeth.

1134
01:07:52,450 --> 01:07:56,330
All right. Female question about anal.
There's, there's a nice segue. Wait,

1135
01:07:56,350 --> 01:07:58,090
did we even give that guy advice though?

1136
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:02,410
Or do we just go off on our own
relationship? Here's the advice.

1137
01:08:02,790 --> 01:08:06,070
Uh,
don't date this girl.

1138
01:08:07,390 --> 01:08:08,470
If you're going to banger.

1139
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:11,740
I mean you're rolling the dice because
then she's going to be a, okay, lastly,

1140
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:14,530
go with a joke. Right now. I
really am. Oh, that's true.

1141
01:08:14,531 --> 01:08:16,250
She might blow up your
spot cause she's already

1142
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:19,160
talking out of school.
Yeah, that's a good point.

1143
01:08:19,420 --> 01:08:23,930
This and this guy has the problem that
I have is that when he makes a fucking

1144
01:08:23,931 --> 01:08:28,850
loony bird who's fucking all about it, you
just fucking, you. You can't, you can't,

1145
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:33,460
you know, you just, yeah, that's
like a, that's literally uh,

1146
01:08:34,790 --> 01:08:39,790
that's like a second degree like Dick
Black belt to be able to walk away from

1147
01:08:39,871 --> 01:08:42,620
pre pussy like that.
And I sorry that I'm being crass.

1148
01:08:42,730 --> 01:08:44,450
I've just one running out of time here.

1149
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:50,030
I'm just trying to get to the point here.
Followup was a virgin,

1150
01:08:50,031 --> 01:08:54,500
not a virgin anymore. This is before the
female question about anal. I wrote, okay,

1151
01:08:54,501 --> 01:08:57,770
this guy got fucking late.
Hey you broke your cherry.

1152
01:08:58,190 --> 01:09:02,570
I wrote in a few months back elaborating
on my situation. Remember this 20,

1153
01:09:02,571 --> 01:09:07,430
I got a lot of versions calling in uh,
writing, uh, as a 21 year old virgin,

1154
01:09:07,850 --> 01:09:10,980
uh Oh, I was going to make
a really bad joke there. La.

1155
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:15,820
I've got a lot of virgin typing
in on a semen stain, keyboards.

1156
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:22,070
I know it was gross. I, it is funny
to me in my head. All right, sorry.

1157
01:09:22,130 --> 01:09:23,150
I wrote it a few months ago.

1158
01:09:23,630 --> 01:09:28,630
I helped this person a few months back
elaborating on my situation as a 21 year

1159
01:09:28,851 --> 01:09:33,851
old virgin conservative girlfriend where
the furthest we went was oral sex as

1160
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:39,170
well as subsequent hookups with
other girls only stopping there.

1161
01:09:39,980 --> 01:09:43,700
Um, so you kind of get blown. I
don't really consider that a virgin.

1162
01:09:43,730 --> 01:09:48,030
I just can see you like how I was
going to say you like it, Dah, Dah,

1163
01:09:48,290 --> 01:09:52,200
Dah. You're not out in the field.
You know, you just come, you,

1164
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:55,010
you go to bed every couple of innings.
I don't know though,

1165
01:09:55,011 --> 01:09:58,910
but is that guys deliver like not a
virgin if he gets blown, but a girl,

1166
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:03,320
is it still a virgin if she just
gets EFA guidance goes down in our,

1167
01:10:03,321 --> 01:10:07,460
because then her hymen isn't
broken. No, no, no. As a guy,

1168
01:10:07,461 --> 01:10:09,560
you're still a virgin
until you banged a girl.

1169
01:10:10,270 --> 01:10:12,200
You've got to in there and a woman,

1170
01:10:12,230 --> 01:10:15,680
you're still a virgin slash kind
of Horry if the other way around,

1171
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:19,220
I don't have time to get involved
in the debate anyways. Um,

1172
01:10:19,221 --> 01:10:20,930
as well as subsequent hookups
or the Gobbler Blah, blah.

1173
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:25,400
This was when I asked you whether
telling a girl that I was still a virgin

1174
01:10:25,401 --> 01:10:29,930
before slash during, during, during,
quite as, I don't know what that means.

1175
01:10:29,931 --> 01:10:34,610
Fornicating was a good idea during,
does this jolt your memory?

1176
01:10:34,611 --> 01:10:35,510
Absolutely it does.

1177
01:10:35,780 --> 01:10:40,780
I actually lost my virginity 30 minutes
before my actual birthday with a girl

1178
01:10:40,970 --> 01:10:45,770
I'm currently dating go.
So yeah,

1179
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:49,310
it's not like I was a
fucking whore. Anything, uh,

1180
01:10:49,311 --> 01:10:52,970
you will write about telling a girl about
my sexual experience or lack thereof.

1181
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:57,140
She was actually totally fine with it.
Of course I'm not a bad guy.

1182
01:10:57,141 --> 01:11:00,620
Gave this guy some advice that
worked and we shouldn't Fry's that.

1183
01:11:00,621 --> 01:11:04,220
I was a virgin, which I guess I should
take as a compliment. Absolutely.

1184
01:11:04,810 --> 01:11:08,030
It means you probably kissing
a nice rubbing it tidies
the way she liked it over

1185
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:12,440
there. Um, anyways, I'd like to
thank you for that as a small part.

1186
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:14,010
Uh,
it

1187
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:17,490
may, uh, as small of a part as it may have
been, it still helps. Well, there you go.

1188
01:11:17,491 --> 01:11:22,130
So what is good now, if I could follow
this up with another short question out,

1189
01:11:22,770 --> 01:11:25,420
me and this girl been hooking
up pretty frequently in,

1190
01:11:25,450 --> 01:11:27,390
I'm going to have some dirt question
here. All right, here we go.

1191
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:30,400
Now he's going to get technical.
Not, I'm just fucking on.

1192
01:11:31,170 --> 01:11:34,620
How do I improve on that?
Um, is that disgusting? Um,

1193
01:11:34,650 --> 01:11:37,980
and the one issue I have is that I used,

1194
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:43,600
I have to use a rubber.
You did say safe sex is like boxing,

1195
01:11:43,620 --> 01:11:45,950
keep yourself protected at all times.
Uh,

1196
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:50,880
unfortunately when I do put one on I
can't feel shit and therefore tend to lose

1197
01:11:50,881 --> 01:11:53,400
my erection erection after awhile.

1198
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:58,380
And it's not like she is in hot
or anything. Uh, cute Asian.

1199
01:11:58,650 --> 01:12:02,610
That's number two with the Asians.
I know one fat Asian, one Q one.

1200
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:08,880
Now number one, what is wrong
with saying she's a cute Asian?

1201
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:13,080
Nothing. She's a hot chick.
How dare you say that?

1202
01:12:13,081 --> 01:12:17,040
She's good looking and
describe her. There you go. Um,

1203
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:20,760
stop talking for condoms were number one.

1204
01:12:20,820 --> 01:12:23,100
Have you ever encountered
issues like this? Yes.

1205
01:12:23,490 --> 01:12:27,510
And how would you go about solving it? Uh,
is it actually my fault? No. Cause what?

1206
01:12:27,511 --> 01:12:28,344
You know what it is,
dude,

1207
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:32,960
you're used to fucking mouth on Dick
contact and now all of a sudden you put in

1208
01:12:32,961 --> 01:12:36,090
the Dick. Oh yeah. Your, your, your
condom on and it feels like you're,

1209
01:12:36,091 --> 01:12:38,910
you're in the abyss.
This is what you're going to get used to.

1210
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:41,160
It jerk off with the condom bond.

1211
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:43,800
This stuff that you could do
don't jerk off for a while.

1212
01:12:44,070 --> 01:12:47,130
You have to get used to the
sensation again. It sucks.

1213
01:12:47,131 --> 01:12:49,740
But I'm telling you he could
get those thin ones though.

1214
01:12:49,770 --> 01:12:51,810
The real thin lambskin or whatever.

1215
01:12:51,811 --> 01:12:55,810
And I could run through that x ray
machine at the fucking airport to no,

1216
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:58,890
I'm telling you this is the greatest
thing you can do now that you're fucking,

1217
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:01,990
but I don't really get this kid some
advice. Get some different kind of car.

1218
01:13:01,991 --> 01:13:06,390
I'd like to experiment with different
condoms. No. Trojans are super thick. No,

1219
01:13:06,570 --> 01:13:10,320
there's other ones that are, oh, this
is what you want to do. Okay. Okay.

1220
01:13:10,460 --> 01:13:15,460
Well in this day and age with Greenland
fucking melting and the water rising in

1221
01:13:16,351 --> 01:13:20,820
New York. Okay. You, you cannot, you have
to where you got to fucking go all out.

1222
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:22,830
No,
I'm saying he should wear a condom.

1223
01:13:23,230 --> 01:13:26,010
You don't get the one that does the
fucking thin one. This thing too,

1224
01:13:26,011 --> 01:13:28,500
you can wear condoms. Still get herpes. I
still don't understand all that happens.

1225
01:13:28,620 --> 01:13:30,960
Is it on your ball?
Big Oral.

1226
01:13:30,961 --> 01:13:35,040
If you shaved your nuts that day
and then you fucking against it,

1227
01:13:35,220 --> 01:13:38,700
I have no idea. It's a risk of getting
something. That's just how it goes down.

1228
01:13:38,701 --> 01:13:41,130
So this is the thing, dude,
uh, right out of the gate,

1229
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:43,650
get used to fucking wearing condoms.

1230
01:13:43,740 --> 01:13:47,730
I can't even fucking tell you how
psyched you are going to be. You know,

1231
01:13:47,731 --> 01:13:51,420
if this doesn't work out, you have a one
night stand. As much as it sucks, there's,

1232
01:13:51,570 --> 01:13:53,130
there's no fucking better feeling.

1233
01:13:53,700 --> 01:13:56,290
The end when you walk out
knowing that you wore one and oh,

1234
01:13:56,310 --> 01:13:59,310
this is what you always do after you have
sex, you go, okay, you know, you act like,

1235
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:00,870
oh, I got to go throw
this thing out. Right?

1236
01:14:01,050 --> 01:14:04,680
And then you go and you put your Dick in
her sink in flux and you scrubbed that

1237
01:14:04,681 --> 01:14:08,740
fucker and then you walk out that need
to put, use her face towel. Oh Man.

1238
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:09,930
Get the fuck out of there.

1239
01:14:10,410 --> 01:14:13,990
Or you know what else it could do and
you don't fuck whores, which is hard.

1240
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:18,910
You know what else you could do if
he's in a relationship with his girl,

1241
01:14:18,911 --> 01:14:21,280
he's a virgin.
I don't know what her sexual history is.

1242
01:14:21,460 --> 01:14:25,060
They could both go to the clinic together,
get tested for everything wrong,

1243
01:14:25,180 --> 01:14:29,020
everything across the board and then
still wear a condom because you have no

1244
01:14:29,021 --> 01:14:31,720
idea what the other person's going to do.
You can be with a sociopath.

1245
01:14:31,730 --> 01:14:35,260
You don't have time for this.
Don't fuck that. Fuck all of that.

1246
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:40,240
But if they're in like a committed
thing, you know the 21, the 21,

1247
01:14:40,241 --> 01:14:41,860
she's going to run into one of these,
write it up.

1248
01:14:41,861 --> 01:14:45,160
80 year old guys that's has fucking
70 [inaudible] 70 years again,

1249
01:14:45,370 --> 01:14:48,520
he's going to fucking talk him into
going down on his fucking grows.

1250
01:14:48,521 --> 01:14:53,380
Babe Ruth Dick. Uh, female question
about anal. This is the last one.

1251
01:14:53,381 --> 01:14:56,260
I got to see this. I
gotta get Outta here. Um,

1252
01:14:57,130 --> 01:15:01,850
my husband keeps jokingly bringing up
the subject of anal sex. The funnies.

1253
01:15:01,870 --> 01:15:02,920
I fucked in the ass.

1254
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:11,840
Did you have him call me in and asked how
we should go about asking you for anal?

1255
01:15:12,260 --> 01:15:16,800
Um, there's no, there's no ask you
with anal. You just do it. Wow.

1256
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:22,760
Wow. Now what it is, you have to,
you have to do a survey during,

1257
01:15:22,790 --> 01:15:26,540
during doggy style. That's what
she, that's how you figure it out.

1258
01:15:27,140 --> 01:15:31,290
It's done with the thumb. It's sort
of a rubbing circular motion. William.

1259
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:44,790
It's finished reading. I just
finished reading it. Okay.

1260
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:49,420
Just stop and just read please.
For the love of God. Oh,

1261
01:15:49,421 --> 01:15:51,010
this guy just joking around.

1262
01:15:51,130 --> 01:15:55,600
I love these pancakes so much that I
love to fuck you in the ass. Just kid.

1263
01:15:55,770 --> 01:16:00,160
Just because kids sweetheart.
Oh, this poor guy.

1264
01:16:00,220 --> 01:16:01,540
He wants to fuck you in the ass.

1265
01:16:01,541 --> 01:16:03,460
He doesn't know how to bring
it up after corn flakes.

1266
01:16:03,461 --> 01:16:06,490
This is the funniest thing ever.
In the past,

1267
01:16:06,491 --> 01:16:09,310
he always acted as though
he thinks it's gross.

1268
01:16:09,730 --> 01:16:13,180
Maybe he did and he's just watched so
much porn that he's now graduated to it,

1269
01:16:13,660 --> 01:16:15,300
which is the danger.
Uh,

1270
01:16:15,310 --> 01:16:19,300
my sister told me that a few of her
girlfriends said they actually enjoy it.

1271
01:16:20,470 --> 01:16:25,410
Oh, that means your
sister likes it. You know,

1272
01:16:25,420 --> 01:16:30,010
I have this friend. Yeah, she
loves it. Says that it enhances,

1273
01:16:30,310 --> 01:16:34,900
um, he's very well endowed and I
weigh only all of 95 pounds. Yeah.

1274
01:16:34,901 --> 01:16:39,790
It ain't happening. It ain't happening.
I think my concern is well founded.

1275
01:16:39,791 --> 01:16:42,640
Yes it is. But wait a minute,
those porno girls can take it.

1276
01:16:43,060 --> 01:16:47,350
You can take it to come on, be a trooper.
Uh, what is your opinion about it?

1277
01:16:47,351 --> 01:16:50,110
Should I let him? What would need
to say? You just heard what he,

1278
01:16:50,140 --> 01:16:54,250
what she has to say. He, he
listens. He listens to this.

1279
01:16:54,310 --> 01:16:59,300
Say No, please. You want female
listeners. Punk helped me out. Thanks.

1280
01:16:59,490 --> 01:17:02,950
Lock Yourself. Ah, feed.

1281
01:17:02,951 --> 01:17:07,000
Really don't want to do it
then you shouldn't do it.
You know, there's no reason.

1282
01:17:07,001 --> 01:17:10,580
Yeah. It'd be one thing if you didn't
have a viable option somewhere else. Yeah.

1283
01:17:10,610 --> 01:17:14,590
That was actually, you know what I
mean? It's basically you have any Nikes,

1284
01:17:14,700 --> 01:17:19,500
you have a nice probably
mid size, uh, shit.

1285
01:17:19,501 --> 01:17:23,600
Dan going on there and this guy
for some reason, despite its size,

1286
01:17:23,601 --> 01:17:24,920
is going with the mini Cooper.

1287
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:33,200
Look, they do, I gotta be honest workshops
and it's not something you don't want.

1288
01:17:33,201 --> 01:17:34,730
You don't want to do that with your wife.

1289
01:17:35,850 --> 01:17:36,683
You just don't,

1290
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:41,360
okay. I thought that's the one person
you would want to do it. Well, no,

1291
01:17:41,530 --> 01:17:42,730
you do it with it.

1292
01:17:42,820 --> 01:17:46,760
With that fucking dig back that says
she's already banging you at work. Okay.

1293
01:17:46,790 --> 01:17:48,650
That's who you do it to write on a desk.

1294
01:17:48,890 --> 01:17:53,890
You fucker in the ass musher face into
the card catalog and then you know what

1295
01:17:54,230 --> 01:17:56,770
the card catalog,
whatever the fuck they got nowadays.

1296
01:17:57,470 --> 01:18:01,670
That that's how you do it with, that's it.
Okay. That's the podcast for this week.

1297
01:18:01,890 --> 01:18:06,500
Um, oh, I got it real quick. One
from, well if I'm a lady, uh yeah. So,

1298
01:18:07,530 --> 01:18:07,960
okay.

1299
01:18:07,960 --> 01:18:12,140
I Dunno. I Dunno what to tell you.
It's like, you know, get 95 pounds.

1300
01:18:12,141 --> 01:18:15,560
He has a giant Dick. What, what do
you, what are you going to do there?

1301
01:18:15,590 --> 01:18:17,150
I have no idea.
You know what I would do?

1302
01:18:17,151 --> 01:18:20,870
I would call in doctor drew
show and have them, uh,

1303
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:22,830
I would say I'm going to
pass up. You throw? Yeah,

1304
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:25,790
I'm gonna I'm to send that one up.
The up the up the, what'd they say?

1305
01:18:25,850 --> 01:18:30,350
What'd they say in the precinct? Send
that went up the up the ranks. They uh,

1306
01:18:30,351 --> 01:18:33,260
you know what? We don't have time.
No, no, no, no. Really quickly if you,

1307
01:18:33,261 --> 01:18:37,040
I don't know what city you live in,
but if there is a sex shop near you,

1308
01:18:37,190 --> 01:18:39,830
they normally have like
these anal sex workshops,

1309
01:18:39,831 --> 01:18:42,530
like taught by women or
whatever and a couple can go in,

1310
01:18:42,650 --> 01:18:46,970
you pay a little bit of money and
they like, they talk you like,

1311
01:18:47,090 --> 01:18:50,480
they tell you how to do it so that
it's gentle and it's not freaking out.

1312
01:18:51,410 --> 01:18:55,490
How do you see you could do that? How do
you start that? Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1313
01:18:55,700 --> 01:18:56,361
I understand that.

1314
01:18:56,361 --> 01:19:00,170
If she wants to get it when you go into
a sex store and they're fucking in there,

1315
01:19:00,290 --> 01:19:03,860
but how did you get there? Where are
the anal sex shop? Like open mics,

1316
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:04,941
like where do you start?

1317
01:19:04,941 --> 01:19:07,730
Like you're sitting in a cubicle and like
you know where I think I would make my

1318
01:19:07,731 --> 01:19:12,320
millions in New York City people how
to take their big Dixon and that little

1319
01:19:12,321 --> 01:19:13,370
white sand city.

1320
01:19:13,371 --> 01:19:16,580
There was a place called toys and babe
land and they gave all kinds of workshops

1321
01:19:16,581 --> 01:19:20,910
how to give blow jobs, but how do
whatever what's you're missing?

1322
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:23,120
Introduce SNM into your relationship.

1323
01:19:23,390 --> 01:19:26,240
They all have these things but
you're missing the point here.

1324
01:19:26,290 --> 01:19:29,750
What is the point is is how do you
become that fucking person? I don't know.

1325
01:19:29,780 --> 01:19:34,150
That's what I'm saying. Where
are the open mics? I Dunno.

1326
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:36,890
You probably see a good gig. You want
to sit there and talking about Amy,

1327
01:19:36,980 --> 01:19:40,070
you're acting like a bunch of hotties
I going to cry in or you work in a sex

1328
01:19:40,071 --> 01:19:42,620
shop, you learn about things and
then you just become an expert.

1329
01:19:42,621 --> 01:19:43,580
You study it or whatever.

1330
01:19:43,581 --> 01:19:45,920
You talk to people and I know you don't
even know what you're talking about.

1331
01:19:45,950 --> 01:19:47,690
You literally were
looking up at the ceiling,

1332
01:19:48,020 --> 01:19:51,770
sort of shaking your head like idea or
out of this guy. Probably just, yeah,

1333
01:19:51,870 --> 01:19:55,340
it just have a parachute and you
land on the store and they say, Hey,

1334
01:19:55,341 --> 01:19:59,960
you want to talk about dicks?
Humble, female breadwinner. Hi Bill.

1335
01:20:00,290 --> 01:20:04,580
I'm, I'm one of those ladies who
usually takes too long to tell a story.

1336
01:20:04,581 --> 01:20:06,380
So I tried really hard to make this quick.

1337
01:20:06,410 --> 01:20:08,040
This is actually than most of the guys,
so

1338
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:08,840
I appreciate it.
Uh,

1339
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:12,600
I make three times more money than my
boyfriend of 15 of one and a half years.

1340
01:20:12,601 --> 01:20:15,570
Sorry, 1.5 years. Jesus Christ.

1341
01:20:15,571 --> 01:20:17,760
How career-driven is her 1.5 years?

1342
01:20:18,290 --> 01:20:21,300
Let me sure that she's making more money.
Um,

1343
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:24,870
I have zero problem with this because
money is not a big issue with me.

1344
01:20:25,230 --> 01:20:27,990
It's a tough economy and he's
very hardworking. Lately.

1345
01:20:27,991 --> 01:20:30,300
This seems to be more of an issue for him.
Of course it is.

1346
01:20:30,690 --> 01:20:34,650
He makes a bigger deal about going out
to eat and took a weekend job so we could

1347
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:38,220
see each other less.
Um,

1348
01:20:38,580 --> 01:20:42,870
he has told me that he is ring shopping
and even though I've told them many

1349
01:20:42,871 --> 01:20:45,960
times that I don't want
anything fancy or expensive,

1350
01:20:46,170 --> 01:20:49,650
he counters saying when I show my friends
I'll be embarrassed and he wants to

1351
01:20:49,651 --> 01:20:52,440
give him some really nice yeah.
Any advice on how to convince them?

1352
01:20:52,441 --> 01:20:56,580
I'm not a material girl now what you got
to do is support the guy cause there's,

1353
01:20:57,410 --> 01:20:58,560
you got to understand
that as a [inaudible]

1354
01:20:58,580 --> 01:21:03,220
guy, like going out and earning a living,
that's, that's what we're there for.

1355
01:21:03,221 --> 01:21:04,450
And when we're not doing it,

1356
01:21:04,451 --> 01:21:08,290
not only we can't do it at that time
because we don't have a job and your

1357
01:21:08,291 --> 01:21:12,400
fucking doing it, no matter how cool you
are, it's totally fucking emasculating.

1358
01:21:12,580 --> 01:21:15,730
It'd be like if I could all of a
sudden have a fucking kid and you

1359
01:21:15,950 --> 01:21:17,630
get pregnant and I was over there,

1360
01:21:17,631 --> 01:21:21,770
fucking nursing a baby is
creepy as that example.

1361
01:21:22,850 --> 01:21:24,190
I'm just saying,
you know what I men,

1362
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:28,610
men want to be the provider that's
like in their nature. So no,

1363
01:21:28,611 --> 01:21:31,700
that's our job.
It's our job.

1364
01:21:32,810 --> 01:21:36,500
It's our fucking job. It's the same way
that women like when you're with a woman,

1365
01:21:36,501 --> 01:21:39,590
if you get in too good a shape,
they get fucking insecure.

1366
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:43,370
Like they don't like a lot of women.
As much as they liked those shredded guys,

1367
01:21:43,371 --> 01:21:46,250
they don't want to be with a guy that's
in that go to fucking shape cause then

1368
01:21:46,251 --> 01:21:47,030
they're like,
fuck,

1369
01:21:47,030 --> 01:21:50,360
now I have to be in that good of shape
and I can't go to those cheese fondue,

1370
01:21:50,361 --> 01:21:51,590
lava fucking things.

1371
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:56,750
You don't stick my tongue in it with a
glass of wine and pontificate about sex

1372
01:21:56,751 --> 01:21:59,840
in the city or whatever the fuck it is.
You brought stu. Listen, you want to,

1373
01:22:00,050 --> 01:22:02,210
oh my God. You want to like, uh,

1374
01:22:02,270 --> 01:22:06,560
those are absolutely disgusting by
the way that she's come on. They sit,

1375
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:11,570
they stick in the, she's calm.
That's gross. It smells awful.
Terrific. Yeah, I don't,

1376
01:22:11,571 --> 01:22:15,820
I don't like fondue. You only
fondue? No, that's weird. All right.

1377
01:22:15,830 --> 01:22:18,950
I went to a fondue restaurant. It's my
like feed. I would just say, listen,

1378
01:22:18,951 --> 01:22:21,140
you got to support this guy. Just
say to the guy, just say, listen,

1379
01:22:21,820 --> 01:22:26,530
I get it. I get it. You don't have a job
right now and it's fucking hard for you.

1380
01:22:26,620 --> 01:22:27,580
And,
uh,

1381
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:31,990
I have 100% faith that yet
you're going to find another job.

1382
01:22:31,991 --> 01:22:34,240
We're going to have a great life.
And you know,

1383
01:22:34,660 --> 01:22:37,510
you don't have to buy a ring right now,
but when you get your job and everything,

1384
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:38,470
you want to go out by me.

1385
01:22:38,471 --> 01:22:42,730
If I totally respect the fact that you're
thinking about me being embarrassed or

1386
01:22:42,731 --> 01:22:46,660
on my friends, just support
the guy, that'll be fine.
Yeah. That's all you gotta do.

1387
01:22:46,690 --> 01:22:48,850
Just support the guy.
Yeah. Because right now,

1388
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:51,160
no matter unless he hears that from you,

1389
01:22:51,370 --> 01:22:55,240
he's just going to automatically think
that you're thinking that, you know,

1390
01:22:55,270 --> 01:22:58,000
he's not a provider and he's not a
good guy. He needs to hear it from you.

1391
01:22:58,240 --> 01:23:02,440
The same way that when Yell Lady,
maybe put on a few,

1392
01:23:02,441 --> 01:23:06,010
you got to tell us she's
still looking good. Right? Why

1393
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:10,120
are you looking at me like that?
Because lately I've been slipping.

1394

play, she'll pleasure me later. Um,

all right. Just left it at
the good advice. You know,

1397
01:23:22,450 --> 01:23:25,360

didn't ask you on the podcast.
