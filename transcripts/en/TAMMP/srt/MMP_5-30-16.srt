11
00:00:38,601 --> 00:00:40,910
Silver Bullets fucking prom night.

00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:46,260
Um,

00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:51,720
Oh, Jesus Christ. I'm Happier
Memorial Day. Everybody.

14
00:00:51,721 --> 00:00:55,900
Thank you to everybody in the military
for doing what it is that you're dope.

15
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:57,121
Um,

16
00:00:57,121 --> 00:01:01,920
so that morons like me can run their
fucking yaps and not a have a black van

17
00:01:01,921 --> 00:01:06,030
pull up and take me away
to get reeducated. Um,

18
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,660
that's it. Happy, happy,
happy day off on a Monday.

19
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,690
They should have one of these
a fucking month. You know,

20
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,000
they should have won three
day weekend a month. If, if,

21
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:19,320
if Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders
would get on board with that,

22
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,960
the two candidates that the people,

23
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:27,520
people want to go, either one of
them too and they're gonna ramble.

24
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:29,360
Hillary right down.

25
00:01:29,361 --> 00:01:33,290
You Fuck El Cuckoo clock face
herself right down you fucking

26
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:38,050
throat. That's what they're
gonna do. I watched this clip
on Facebook, so you know,

27
00:01:38,051 --> 00:01:40,330
it had to be true where Chris Matthews,

28
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:44,880
right was basically just mind fucking
everybody's saying that Hillary was gonna

29
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:46,270
win it and blah blah blah, blah, blah.

30
00:01:46,271 --> 00:01:50,610
Just say when she wins it and all that
type of shit and she wasn't doing like,

31
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:54,430
he wasn't doing like a dude I called
the type of thing. He's just doing that.

32
00:01:54,431 --> 00:01:58,120
Like the, the, the
rich, the rich liberals,

33
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:02,110
you know those ones, you know the ones
who act like they care about anybody else,

34
00:02:02,111 --> 00:02:02,590
they actually,

35
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:06,160
they're worse than rich
Republicans because Republicans
don't act like they give

36
00:02:06,161 --> 00:02:09,070
a fuck about other people.
But rich liberals, AH,

37
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:13,060
they're the fucking worst bleeding heart,
you know,

38
00:02:13,061 --> 00:02:15,940
caring about everybody and
their fucking gated communities.

39
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:22,060
Oh Jesus, pill the fuck did you have for
breakfast? What did I have breakfast.

40
00:02:22,061 --> 00:02:25,960
I had two eggs over age,
two eggs over easy.

41
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:31,170
And I always buy these eggs from this
fucking Lily's farm because it sounds like

42
00:02:31,511 --> 00:02:34,510
it's some chick down the street who just
has a hen house and she's making them

43
00:02:34,511 --> 00:02:36,160
from my neighborhood.
But God knows, you know,

44
00:02:36,161 --> 00:02:39,280
it's some giant corporation and I dunno
what the fuck they're doing with these

45
00:02:39,281 --> 00:02:44,110
eggs. They have the thinnest
slash hardest eggshells ever.

46
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:47,590
So if you tap real lightly poop poop,
poop in the bottom of the fucking pants,

47
00:02:47,591 --> 00:02:50,350
they will not break. And if
he get, then there's this,

48
00:02:50,351 --> 00:02:54,580
this one fucking sweet
spot that you hit the,

49
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:59,540
you hit the fucking eggshell that will
actually crack and it won't break yolk.

50
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:03,220
All right? I don't know if you guys
know about this, know this about me,

51
00:03:03,221 --> 00:03:06,100
but I do not break egg yolks.
Okay.

52
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:09,340
And I'm also superstitious when
it comes to break an egg yolks.

53
00:03:09,341 --> 00:03:11,410
I feel like if you break the fucking yoke,

54
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,460
that means your day is going
to be a shit show, right?

55
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:20,020
It's a metaphor. You had a plan
and the whole thing went to shit.

56
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:23,890
And then you got a scramble it up.
Right. That's how I look at it.

57
00:03:23,891 --> 00:03:27,040
So not only did I broke,
I broke one,

58
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:32,080
the other one was okay,
but then I was just so fucking frustrated.

59
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:35,350
Cause you want them runny cause then
you still have the nutrition in there.

60
00:03:35,351 --> 00:03:37,270
Right. All these people to
have an overhardt. Yeah.

61
00:03:37,271 --> 00:03:40,960
Over hard like you fucking
arteries. Right. So, uh,

62
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,930
I go to flip the thing and I'm so fucking
frustrated that it's going to turn

63
00:03:43,931 --> 00:03:47,470
into basically a fried egg sandwich.
I got mad and I go to flip the other one.

64
00:03:47,471 --> 00:03:51,580
I broke that one too. And I just was
in my kitchen by myself going, yeah,

65
00:03:51,581 --> 00:03:54,670
there you go. Fuck the whole thing.
Right? Yeah. Fuck the whole thing.

66
00:03:55,670 --> 00:04:00,110
The Nini downstairs are right.
Yeah. By what are you doing?

67
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:04,460
Ah, just making some eggs,
honey. Does it sound like it?

68
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:10,620
Okay. Go see interrogation. Right.
It comes to fucking interrogation.

69
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:15,750
Like Norbert Leo Butz,
his wife on bloodline.

70
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:20,850
Oh my God. That character is
driving me up the fucking wall.

71
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:24,780
Not saying the actress, she's phenomenal.
But that whole dynamic, it's like,

72
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:28,830
can you get just shut up?
Can you leave the man alone?

73
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:33,770
Is anybody watching bloodline? I'm not
going to ruin any of this shit, but a,

74
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,890
you got to fucking watch it. You
got to watch it. I'm like, uh,

75
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,680
I'm already five episodes into season
two. What just came out? Um, you know,

76
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,490
I had a nice three day weekend, so
Billy fucking red cakes here. I, um,

77
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:53,610
I've been fucking Netflix the whole
weekend. Started off the weekend.

78
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:59,210
I watched the do over Adam Sandler's
new movie with David Spade.

79
00:04:59,431 --> 00:05:03,360
It was fucking great. I always loved
San Louis fucking movies and, uh,

80
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,160
I love spades character.
I,

81
00:05:05,161 --> 00:05:07,890
it's hard to talk about a movie
without saying what the fuck happens?

82
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:12,500
Just watch it. And also just being a fan
of people out here in Hollywood that,

83
00:05:12,501 --> 00:05:16,320
that do their own goddamn thing.
Um,

84
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,310
I guess Sandler's movies crush it
on Netflix. So he's like, well,

85
00:05:20,311 --> 00:05:22,740
why fucking take it to the movie theater?
I'll just take it right to you.

86
00:05:22,741 --> 00:05:26,580
So we cut a deal with them for like, is
next, I don't know, four to six movies.

87
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:32,100
And they went right right to that. So I
believe this is the first one. And um,

88
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:36,960
I fucking loved it, man. I loved it.
I got a, I can't say what happens,

89
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:40,200
but there was just one thing
that Sandler did and I was like,

90
00:05:40,201 --> 00:05:44,100
that's probably going to be the most
disgusting thing I'm going to see for the

91
00:05:44,101 --> 00:05:45,210
first half of the year.

92
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,380
And then something else happens that
involves a fucking old lady. Um,

93
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,320
so there you go. I just prime the
pump, check it out if you get a chance.

94
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:56,800
And I've been watching
bloodline and then, uh,

95
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:01,610
somebody else recommended I am road comic
and it was about a, just these comics,

96
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:06,170
Wayne Fetterman and these guys doing this
road gig and uh, enjoyed all of that,

97
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,540
joy, it, all of that. And uh,
but I mentioned earlier that, uh,

98
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,010
check those out if you can't check
them out at the camp. Anyways,

99
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:18,040
so I mentioned earlier that I am in a
much more upbeat mood than I have been in

100
00:06:20,511 --> 00:06:24,770
a while. You know, and I know what
you're thinking below. What, what'd you,

101
00:06:24,771 --> 00:06:29,600
what'd you get another bottle of
booze? Now. Not at all. Not at all.

102
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,700
I finally went to a chiropractor.

103
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:33,733
All right.

104
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:39,340
I went to a chiropractor, um, and
I never, I never go to the doctor.

105
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,780
All right? Because that's how I was
brought up. Christ, I'm telling you,

106
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,700
you to get down there and,
and you're going to find some

107
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:53,370
fucking white suit. It's take
a goddamn aspirin. I right?

108
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:56,620
You hang from a pull up bar,
you'll be fine. All right?

109
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:58,440
Okay.

110
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,430
I came from a family in a town where
you didn't go to the fucking doctor.

111
00:07:02,431 --> 00:07:04,410
If you went to the fucking,
do you go to the doctor?

112
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,890
You don't take your car to a mechanic
because they're going to fucking find

113
00:07:07,891 --> 00:07:12,510
something. So I finally go
to the chiropractor because
at this point I told you,

114
00:07:12,511 --> 00:07:13,620
I'm literally in the writer's room.

115
00:07:13,621 --> 00:07:17,070
I have cushions from this couch
on the floor and I'm, I'm,

116
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:21,210
I lay on the floor and uh,
I call it floor pitching.

117
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,910
I just pitched jokes laying on the floor.

118
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,750
And then when it gets to some
critical part, part of the story,

119
00:07:27,751 --> 00:07:32,070
I then stand up to see what's going on.
And then I laid back down and get,

120
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,390
then I just lay in the ground. What if,
uh, what if Frank said, uh, you know,

121
00:07:36,391 --> 00:07:39,300
I'll put you through the fucking
wall. Right. That's what I do.

122
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:43,770
So I finally couldn't take it anymore
and a buddy of mine who works on the show

123
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,710
said I got a great chiropractor. And I
finally was just like, you know what?

124
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:51,710
You've got to let that fucking
suburban Boston shit go. Okay.

125
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:55,040
There's no way. If they always fucked up,
everybody would still be going to them.

126
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:59,990
So I ended up going down there
and this guy was a fucking wizard.

127
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,000
Unbelievable.
Right?

128
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:07,180
He literally like put his hand right in
my lower back and was just pushing on my

129
00:08:09,141 --> 00:08:13,700
spine, like on one side of it. And it was
going on. It seems like you have a, a,

130
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:17,330
an older injury here from a long
time ago. And I was like, yeah,

131
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:20,600
how the fuck did you know that?
Because now I can tell cause this is bold.

132
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:25,400
J Like I had a bulging disc and he
goes, hey, I go, yeah, fucking I,

133
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:29,590
one of my, when I was in
fourth grade, you know,

134
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,140
I was into wrestling and a buddy of mine
knew how to do the figure four leg lock.

135
00:08:33,141 --> 00:08:37,160
And unfortunately the only way to teach
someone how to do it is to put a minute.

136
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:42,680
And he put me in the fucking thing.
And when I sat up to try to free my leg,

137
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:47,660
I was the first time I felt uh,
something go out in my back.

138
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:51,080
And then the next time was
playing football freshman
year of high school pickup

139
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,120
football.
I didn't play organized,

140
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:57,240
it didn't play organized cause I got a
d in math in fifth grade and that was,

141
00:08:57,241 --> 00:08:59,370
that was,
that was my retirement.

142
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,850
Like when Jordan retired
in 2003 except by never,

143
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:06,360
I won one championship
and I never returned. Um,

144
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:11,220
but anyways,
he was able to fix all of that shit.

145
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:15,810
I immediately felt better the next day
I was sore. And then over the weekend,

146
00:09:15,811 --> 00:09:19,440
like, um, like last night for the
first time in like two months,

147
00:09:19,441 --> 00:09:23,220
I was able to sit down for a significant
period of time and have no pain

148
00:09:23,221 --> 00:09:25,460
whatsoever.
And uh,

149
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:28,460
I've just been doing all
these stretches and uh,

150
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:32,340
the biggest one is I've
been doing, uh, that,

151
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:37,790
you know the up dog yoga stretch for your
a was he a so as muscle in the front,

152
00:09:37,951 --> 00:09:41,580
I just thought it connected you top to
bottom, just where your hips weren't,

153
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,770
it ran perpendicular to your waist.

154
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:48,480
I didn't realize that it came up and
then Kinda made like an s turn right to

155
00:09:48,481 --> 00:09:51,540
like the middle of your body. He was
explaining it to me. I forget what it is,

156
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:55,560
but like I've been stretched in that
thing and do what my Vietnamese gambler

157
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:59,260
squat and a couple of runner's stretch.
And um,

158
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:04,280
I think by this time next week I should
be, I should be right as rain. And um,

159
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:05,590
okay

160
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:08,230
dude, he fucking crack my back. I
didn't know he was going to do it.

161
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:11,080
I was laying on my back and he goes,
all right, bring your knees up,

162
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,780
bring him over to the side.
Just let it relax, relax.

163
00:10:13,781 --> 00:10:16,630
Let me have all the weight
and fucking right there, Fred.

164
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:20,560
And I just started fucking laugh.
I'm like, dude, what the fuck?

165
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,620
Cause I always thought it was like
they were cracking your bones.

166
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:27,910
I guess there's gas that they're releasing
in there. I have no fucking idea.

167
00:10:27,911 --> 00:10:29,040
But anyways,
yeah.

168
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,143
MMM.

169
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:32,410
I Dunno. I, I,

170
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:35,950
that's something I always have to
remember that just because something's a

171
00:10:35,951 --> 00:10:39,010
racket, does it mean that there's not
somebody that's really good at it?

172
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:43,090
You know what I mean? Like think of
the reputation that comedians have.

173
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:46,990
We don't have a good reputation.
We're on offstage or attention whores.

174
00:10:46,991 --> 00:10:51,340
We got the fucking lampshades on our head
and we tell fucking awful jokes. Yet,

175
00:10:51,341 --> 00:10:54,250
despite that, there's still,
you're fucking, you know,

176
00:10:54,251 --> 00:10:58,630
David Tells Chappelle's Louis C K
is and all of those fucking guys.

177
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,890
Um,
so that's what I guess what you gotta do.

178
00:11:02,891 --> 00:11:06,310
You gotta find the Louis Ck of
chiropractice before you fucking go in?

179
00:11:06,311 --> 00:11:08,290
And I think I did.
So,

180
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,253
mmm.

181
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,330
I Dunno,
this is a show.

182
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,820
I don't even know how to get out of this
if it's just something good happened to

183
00:11:14,821 --> 00:11:18,300
me and I told you the story and nothing
bad happened so I don't have any jokes

184
00:11:18,301 --> 00:11:22,170
about it other than I couldn't
find the fucking place. You know,

185
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:26,010
I was driving over with my phone.
Right. It's directed me over there.

186
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:30,810
And then in the last second,
um, right when I needed it,

187
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:36,300
where the building was, I hit like a
whatever, a dead zone and I had nothing.

188
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:37,873
MMM.

189
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,380
And I walked up to the building
was one of those partially

190
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:44,160
like rented buildings.

191
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:47,450
So it looked like it was abandoned from
where I was and I'm looking in and by

192
00:11:47,451 --> 00:11:49,870
now I'm already losing my
shit and I'm like this,

193
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,120
nobody even in this fucking
bill fucking build a faded.

194
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:56,710
Then I just see this nurse work by
looking at me with their scrubs on like,

195
00:11:56,711 --> 00:11:59,350
what the fuck is your problem? I was
just an, I had to kind of be like,

196
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:03,400
play it off and then kind of follow her
around the part of the building that was

197
00:12:03,401 --> 00:12:07,780
a actually being used.
I swear to God, man,

198
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:12,160
I need to learn how to
have patience. I just, uh,

199
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,870
I have zero fucking patients.
I have zero fucking tolerance,

200
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,350
all of that shit.
And um,

201
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:21,090
yeah,

202
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:23,100
I dunno.
It's really gonna be the death of me.

203
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:27,450
I really get to learn of just fucking
relax. It's weird little shit,

204
00:12:27,451 --> 00:12:31,680
Little Shit fucking drives me up the wall,
major shit, a major pains in the ass.

205
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:35,370
I just laugh and I don't. Yesterday I
was driving my lovely wife back from,

206
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,680
went over to the mall.
She picked up a few things.

207
00:12:37,681 --> 00:12:39,080
We got all the way home by back,

208
00:12:39,081 --> 00:12:43,200
was starting to kill me and she realized
she left one of her shopping bags in,

209
00:12:43,201 --> 00:12:47,850
I'm in a store and she flipped the fuck
out and I just, and I was like, oh no,

210
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:51,540
it's fine. It's fine. Okay. I don't give
a shit. Right. I drive all the way back.

211
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:55,770
My back's killing me. I didn't give a
fuck. Totally relaxed. That was fine.

212
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,083
Right?

213
00:12:57,090 --> 00:13:01,080
But then like an old lady walks in a
crosswalk and I have to wait an extra six

214
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:05,280
seconds to make a left. And I literally
have a meltdown for the life of me.

215
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:10,830
I can't figure out why that
is. Um, but anyways, um,

216
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:15,450
speaking of great standup Comedians,
um,

217
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:21,050
Doug Stan hope
puts something up.

218
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:22,730
He wrote something,

219
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:26,990
he's friends with Johnny Depp and he's
going through this brutal fucking divorce

220
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:28,910
and uh,

221
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:33,770
I just want to give him props for sticking
up for his friend and everything and

222
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:38,750
saying something. Cause you know,
you know what's really so fucked up.

223
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,373
All right.

224
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:46,060
It's for all the shit that happens to
women that guys do to women is fucked up.

225
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:50,590
But there has been a slight
overcorrection now where if somebody's,

226
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:55,570
a woman just says you do something
before you're ever tried or convicted,

227
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:57,340
it just gets put in the paper.

228
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:01,360
It gets put all over the Internet
and then all you fucking moron.

229
00:14:01,361 --> 00:14:05,710
So 90% of you on the fucking Internet,
just take it as truth.

230
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,710
Take it is fun.
Why do you take it as truth?

231
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:12,280
Because you want it to be true because
he's doing better than you in life.

232
00:14:12,281 --> 00:14:16,870
I mean, it's fucking unbelievable.
I really believe this. Okay.

233
00:14:16,871 --> 00:14:21,710
If somebody gets accused, okay. Of,

234
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:24,080
of,
of rape or domestic violence,

235
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:28,760
they should not publicize the person's
name until they're convicted of it.

236
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:33,790
I think that's more than fair considering
all the fucking dopes out there that

237
00:14:34,911 --> 00:14:37,820
the second day read something,
go to the Trump,

238
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:39,873
you know,

239
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,390
let it fucking see what happens first.

240
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:48,050
See what the fuck happens for us.
All that, that, that whole thing.

241
00:14:48,051 --> 00:14:49,880
Now that all you gotta do is just say it.

242
00:14:49,881 --> 00:14:53,510
The amount of fucking guys who
have falsely accused of that shit,

243
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:57,500
it's like you literally fucking
with their ability to get a job,

244
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:00,140
you fucking with your reputation
and you know the deal dude,

245
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:04,910
like domestic violence and anything
involving sex, that shit never goes,

246
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,200
that never goes away.

247
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:08,143
MMM.

248
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:09,650
So,
I dunno,

249
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:13,850
I just want to give Stan hope fucking
props were actually sticking up for the

250
00:15:13,851 --> 00:15:18,230
guy because there's a lot of people, you
know, because of the stigma around that.

251
00:15:18,231 --> 00:15:19,580
Even if they know it isn't true,

252
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:23,510
they were afraid to throw their
hat in the fucking ring right now.

253
00:15:23,511 --> 00:15:25,580
I don't know what the fuck
happened to whatever. Okay.

254
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,370
I'm just saying the fact that
somebody finally just said, hey,

255
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:31,460
this guy hasn't been tried for
anything yet. He's a friend of mine.

256
00:15:31,461 --> 00:15:33,320
I know we would never do this.
It was,

257
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:37,700
it was refreshing to finally read
that and for somebody to finally say,

258
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:42,690
you know what I believe is you shouldn't
put somebody's name out there until,

259
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:47,220
you know, 100% tried and convicted.
They definitely did that shit.

260
00:15:47,221 --> 00:15:50,790
And then if they did tar and feather them,
but to do that to somebody.

261
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:52,783
MMM.

262
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,680
And also to give that weapon to somebody
that they can just fucking say that in

263
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:02,410
blackmail you with that and,
and really destroy your reputation.

264
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,003
MMM.

265
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,800
I don't, it's, it's, it's
fucking reprehensible.

266
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:10,580
So this is another thing that
isn't really funny, you know,

267
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:16,730
you know, it's like all those
Duke lacrosse players, this shit,

268
00:16:16,731 --> 00:16:21,500
they just fucking faces all
over the fucking, and you know,

269
00:16:21,501 --> 00:16:24,830
to this day, despite the fact
that they were totally vindicated,

270
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:29,780
despite the fact that there was the 30
for 30 talking about how bad they got

271
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:32,630
railroaded despite all of that,
you know,

272
00:16:32,631 --> 00:16:34,370
that's still going to affect their lives.
You know,

273
00:16:34,371 --> 00:16:38,240
there's still going to be somebody going
yeah, but you know, something happen.

274
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,210
You know, somebody when they get mad
and they got nothing else to say it,

275
00:16:41,211 --> 00:16:43,130
they're going to call him a
rapist or something like that.

276
00:16:43,131 --> 00:16:47,300
You fucking know that the
gunner. Um, so I dunno,

277
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,840
I don't, it was, it was good to see and
of course it was stand up, stand up,

278
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:56,510
stand offs. A good fucking
man. Um, um, as is Johnny Depp,

279
00:16:56,511 --> 00:16:59,240
by the way, the few times that
he's a, he's a big standup,

280
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:03,860
he comes out to shows he's fucking
humble as hell, you know, gentle.

281
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:06,770
One of the most gentle fucking people
lever, you know what I mean? Look,

282
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:08,990
listen to me. Listen how to fuck
I talk. You know what I mean?

283
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,060
You don't understand it.
If it came,

284
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,410
you know somebody said that about me that
he fucking snap like posey and fucking

285
00:17:15,411 --> 00:17:18,230
dirty dozen. I don't know.
I barely know the guy.

286
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,600
I've only met him a few
fucking ties but like I don't,

287
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:26,020
I really tend to believe what the Fuck
Stan hope is sane and I 100% believe that

288
00:17:28,191 --> 00:17:31,400
you should not be putting somebody fucking
name out there just because somebody

289
00:17:31,401 --> 00:17:36,380
said it. You know? Oh it's fucking,
I'm always fucking status brutal.

290
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,630
She's going for fucking spousal support,

291
00:17:38,631 --> 00:17:40,850
you know going for
fucking spouse's support,

292
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:43,460
which means he's got to pay her for
like the rest of her fucking life.

293
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:47,210
She married the guy for 15 fucking months
and your kills me about that person.

294
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,410
She's going to fucking go to
the Beyonce concert, right?

295
00:17:49,411 --> 00:17:51,120
All the date is independent and she,

296
00:17:51,121 --> 00:17:54,660
while you watch your throw
a fucking hand up. Wow.

297
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:58,870
And Shit gets me heated. All
right, here we go. Here we go.

298
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,110
You're already fucking ribbons,

299
00:18:00,111 --> 00:18:04,580
foot from four guys falsely accused of
rape and domestic violence, you know, is,

300
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:07,110
did they get their month?
You know, we'll, we'll,

301
00:18:07,111 --> 00:18:10,200
we'll the NFL where a color for them.
Of course they want, they don't,

302
00:18:10,201 --> 00:18:13,110
they don't give a fuck. Um, anyways.

303
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,260
All right, here we go.
Let's talk about, um,

304
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,570
let's talk about that game six.
Holy fucking shit. Game six, Okc,

305
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:28,980
golden state warriors. And when I
say holy fucking Shit, not only do,

306
00:18:28,981 --> 00:18:31,740
I mean it was a great game.
I mean, holy fucking shit.

307
00:18:31,741 --> 00:18:35,490
You guys going up to sit here and listen
to a man who never watches basketball?

308
00:18:35,491 --> 00:18:36,900
Talk about basketball.
Actually,

309
00:18:36,901 --> 00:18:41,370
I watched the most I've watched this year
and I watched the Celtics mainly. Um,

310
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,160
fucking brutal, man. I will,
I'm not gonna lie to you.

311
00:18:44,161 --> 00:18:48,090
I always root for the underdog. So I
was going for Okc, right? Eh, you know,

312
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:51,240
golden state got this last
year. I like, I, you know,

313
00:18:51,241 --> 00:18:55,800
I've been to a home game
of, um, of the thunder.

314
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,230
The fans are fucking unreal,
and I love their stadium.

315
00:18:58,231 --> 00:19:00,510
It's like a college stadium,
you know,

316
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,310
it's not like fucking triple
decker raw, um, luxury boxes,

317
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:08,280
like down the staple center,
which every time I go in there,

318
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:11,820
there's a part of me that gets really
sad for the, for like true Laker fans,

319
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:16,590
true king fans, true clipper fan said
they got banished that fucking high up.

320
00:19:16,591 --> 00:19:21,120
It's fucking ridiculous. They've got a
Goddamn nightclub in there, you know,

321
00:19:21,121 --> 00:19:24,270
where you can hang out afterwards.
It's the stupidest shit ever. Right.

322
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,260
And meanwhile, all the
fucking, the real fance

323
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:29,520
okay.

324
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,420
That have been hanging out,
you know,

325
00:19:30,421 --> 00:19:33,570
the only real fan and the lower
level of at the Lakers game,

326
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,470
he got to Diane Cannon and Jack Nicholson.
They've been there for fucking ever.

327
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:42,390
And I think it was Jack
First. Um, but anyways,

328
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:46,680
uh, and I, I, I've seen,

329
00:19:46,681 --> 00:19:50,310
I saw Kevin Duran play when he was still
same at key arena when he's still with

330
00:19:50,311 --> 00:19:54,870
the sonics. And I was at that
game when a Okc was playing,

331
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,800
um,
the Miami Heat and Chris Bosh gotten in a,

332
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,620
one of the thunders guys' faces. And, uh,

333
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:05,580
Duran immediately walked over and said
some shit and broke it up and then he

334
00:20:05,581 --> 00:20:08,990
like was really fucking,
you know, look like,

335
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,330
not yelling but just laying
down the law to his teammate.

336
00:20:12,331 --> 00:20:14,820
And afterwards they asked
him what he said. He said,

337
00:20:14,821 --> 00:20:18,060
I just told them there's a lot of phony
tough guys in the league in that guys,

338
00:20:18,061 --> 00:20:21,780
one of them. And right there,
I mean, he was like 22, 23
when he did it, I was like,

339
00:20:21,781 --> 00:20:23,640
yeah, you got it. You can't
not love that guy. Right.

340
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,670
So I'm rooting for these guys and um,

341
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:28,160
okay.

342
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,310
It's the classic fucking thing about a
team that knows how to win another one

343
00:20:31,311 --> 00:20:33,140
that didn't, they had those
fights. They actually,

344
00:20:33,141 --> 00:20:36,980
they actually won the fucking game. They
had the fuck. I can't say they weren't,

345
00:20:36,981 --> 00:20:37,814
they had at one,

346
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:41,330
they were up by seven with four and a
half minutes left and they were playing

347
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:46,390
like they were down by 15
and fucking the warriors,

348
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,000
they were like, they were
like this patient. Like,

349
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:55,480
you know when you see like I want to
python grab something and it wraps itself

350
00:20:55,481 --> 00:21:00,481
around you and it just chill it and every
time you exhale it just fucking goes a

351
00:21:01,091 --> 00:21:04,600
little tighter and a little tighter,
you know, and then you're like,

352
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:08,800
you came fucking bring your pass out
and it's over. That's all they did.

353
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:13,690
If you rewatch that game, they never
increased the tempo of the game.

354
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:15,220
They just fucking,

355
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:19,840
they were like Jason and Friday the 13th
you know when someone's running away,

356
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:23,890
oh Casey was a victim running away,
looking over their shoulders.

357
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:28,420
So they're tripping over logs and shit
and they just fucking walked up on him

358
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:31,930
and that was it.
Fucking machete to the back of the neck.

359
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:37,270
They were playing like they went down by
15 when they were up by seven and then

360
00:21:37,271 --> 00:21:41,020
they just started coming down the court.
They stopped passing the fucking ball.

361
00:21:41,021 --> 00:21:43,120
And Josh,
that was,

362
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,040
that was one of the most
devastating losses I've seen of,

363
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,840
of a home team in a long fucking time.

364
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,660
They just ripped their hearts out,

365
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:56,530
fucking held it up to their faces
and then throw it into the crowd.

366
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:04,260
There was dead fucking
silence except for those 20,

367
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:10,080
unbelievable stereotypical jerk off
California sports fans that hung around.

368
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:15,550
They are the fucking worst. Not
all of them, but 80% of them.

369
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,760
They're the fucking way.

370
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:21,070
Maybe there was a touch of the Yolo
Douche that was fucking going on, right.

371
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,020
You know, the white guys with the hat to
the side and you know, two of them, DJ,

372
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,680
right? Um, they were
standing behind our, uh,

373
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,533
all of the,
uh,

374
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:35,080
all of the fucking announces they're
near killed me when we were watching it.

375
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:38,860
She was fucking make it
fun. A shack. He said he,

376
00:22:38,861 --> 00:22:43,600
she said he's one of his big blue suit.
There's big round head.

377
00:22:43,601 --> 00:22:46,060
She said he looked like one
of those talk in m and. M's.

378
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:53,560
Um, anyways, but Jesus Christ,
Klay Thompson, Mike God,

379
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,510
at what point are you
going to cover the guy?

380
00:22:56,020 --> 00:23:00,910
This is what's so fucked up about
the NBA. You know, when, uh,

381
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:01,860
when,

382
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:05,800
what it was fucking name with Steph curry
goes down the lane for like the 50th

383
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:10,320
fucking time look crossover Hailu Dan,
we'll pop do,

384
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:13,750
and he's in the air back in
the day that you would've got,

385
00:23:13,751 --> 00:23:16,780
you would've got fucking brought down
to earth on the back of your head.

386
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:17,643
That would have been it.

387
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,680
And everyone would have stood up and
pushed and shoved and nobody would've got

388
00:23:20,681 --> 00:23:23,830
ejected. He's fucking
like, that's something,

389
00:23:23,831 --> 00:23:27,490
because I watched very little basketball
for a long time during my standup

390
00:23:27,491 --> 00:23:32,140
career and I just cannot believe the
way you can just coast down the fucking

391
00:23:32,141 --> 00:23:36,490
lane. You know what I mean? Back in the
day, if you tried to go down the lane,

392
00:23:36,491 --> 00:23:40,480
you had to be a fucking man. You know,
you knew you were going to add some,

393
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:44,170
you know, you could get away with it
once, maybe twice. And then that was it.

394
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:48,380
It was like when Michael Vick was running
around as a quarterback, you know,

395
00:23:48,381 --> 00:23:52,860
eventually one of those linebackers was
going to have an opportunity. And um,

396
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:54,110
okay.

397
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:56,810
Yeah, it was gonna you know, this, you
know, if you're a running quarterback,

398
00:23:56,811 --> 00:23:57,650
you know,
eventually,

399
00:23:58,570 --> 00:23:58,980
okay.

400
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,460
You know,
it's almost like considered like a,

401
00:24:01,461 --> 00:24:06,030
I feel it's considered like
a cheap fucking play. Like
we got you guys covered,

402
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,730
you know what I mean? And then you
just going to fucking, you know,

403
00:24:08,731 --> 00:24:13,731
run and then fucking slide on your ass
for a first down that makes people mad on

404
00:24:14,281 --> 00:24:17,880
the defense and eventually you're not
going to have time to go down or they

405
00:24:17,881 --> 00:24:20,640
don't give a fuck that you're going down
and they're going to take the fucking

406
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:21,990
the fine.
And I'm,

407
00:24:21,991 --> 00:24:26,220
I'm amazed how that has been
taken out of the fucking game.

408
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,750
These guys just glide watch.
'Em

409
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:32,520
Yeah.

410
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:36,520
I, I want to say when Mikael hit Rambus,
I don't even know if there was a foul,

411
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:40,460
there must've been a file, but nobody was
ejected. That would have been like, what?

412
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:42,220
I don't know.
Whatever the suspensions are nowadays,

413
00:24:42,221 --> 00:24:47,110
three to five games suspensions. But
anyways, um, Clay Thompson, Jesus Christ,

414
00:24:47,111 --> 00:24:50,080
the fucking guy was unconscious and uh,

415
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:53,160
I got to tell you, man, I just,

416
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:55,060
okay.

417
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:59,410
The only reason why I think Okc can win
game seven is nobody thinks they can't.

418
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,980
And that always makes me feel like Vegas
is going to win a ton of fucking money.

419
00:25:02,981 --> 00:25:04,420
I actually have a bed.

420
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:09,740
I called in the I am Rapaport podcast.
Um,

421
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:14,830
because Rappaport, anytime anything bad
happens to, to fucking Boston teams,

422
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,230
he's just got a hard on for it.
You know what I mean?

423
00:25:17,231 --> 00:25:20,260
And then he tries to act like he
doesn't give a fuck about baseball.

424
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:25,450
And then when I bring up how successful
the Yankees are, he flips out.

425
00:25:25,451 --> 00:25:30,220
That's right. That's right. When we
fucking prison rate too, he flips out it,

426
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:32,500
it literally ages that man,

427
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:36,490
what has happened over the
last decade and a half,

428
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:40,360
what we have accomplished
with only four teams,

429
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:44,380
even a fucking soccer team, if
you want to throw that in, right?

430
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:49,180
Even they won a championship, it apples.
Absolutely fucking devastates that man,

431
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:53,300
you know? And all these got
is the two giant Superbowls,

432
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,540
which to be honest with Ya,
you know,

433
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:58,900
I don't give a fuck if you
told me 15 years ago, Hey,

434
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:04,050
the patriots are going to go to six
Superbowls and when four of them do you

435
00:26:04,151 --> 00:26:07,090
think I'm going to cry above the
other two? I don't give a fuck

436
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,010
foreign too.
I'll fucking take that.

437
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,860
You know what else would
take the fucking giants?

438
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,380
Okay.

439
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:20,700
If they could have gone to six and
one four and why wouldn't ya? Ah,

440
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,670
well you know something they
would probably say one and
two against the Patriots

441
00:26:23,671 --> 00:26:26,670
was better. And I would actually believe
that. I would actually believe that.

442
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,430
So whatever. You know what I mean? But
that's the kind of sports fan I am.

443
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:34,230
I don't have this blind hatred,
you know,

444
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:36,600
this is the thing of,
this is the thing about me.

445
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:40,380
As much as I sound like an upper deck,
I'm really not.

446
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:41,080
Yeah,

447
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,980
I am the way I drink,
I am the way I talk,

448
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:48,840
the way I curse. I am an upper deck
guy, but I am a logical son of a bitch.

449
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:53,460
I'm not saying I'm box seats,
I'm on the mezzanine level. Okay.

450
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:59,010
I'm just that much closer to the fucking,
to the field.

451
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:03,120
Now Rapaport Rapaport
is upper deck all day,

452
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:06,050
all fucking day. And if he hears
this, he's going to say he's,

453
00:27:06,051 --> 00:27:07,110
he's actually proud of it.

454
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:11,850
Rapaport set guy at the top of the
fucking stadium going, is anybody looking?

455
00:27:11,851 --> 00:27:15,000
Is anybody looking at any fucking
takes a piss up in the corner.

456
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:15,750
You know what I mean?

457
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:20,220
He actually really is more like
a Philly fan than a New York fan.

458
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:22,710
He can't help it.
He just can't help it.

459
00:27:22,711 --> 00:27:27,711
Demand demand has in when I hear is hatred
towards Boston sports and when I hear

460
00:27:30,001 --> 00:27:34,320
his excitement every time they
reinstate the Brady suspension,

461
00:27:34,321 --> 00:27:36,110
it just makes me,
it,

462
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:40,830
I can't even tell you how happy it makes
me that there's a New York sports fan

463
00:27:40,831 --> 00:27:45,831
that is experiencing this level of joy
that something bad is finally happening

464
00:27:46,951 --> 00:27:51,780
to, to uh, a Boston team this
century. It never used to be that way.

465
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,650
You know, you know what New York
sports fans are to Boston fans.

466
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,230
They like your big brother
that used to be able to,

467
00:27:58,231 --> 00:28:02,430
could beat you up until you were about
14 and then you finally kicked his ass,

468
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:06,480
you know, you know, throw them down
the flight of stairs. You know,

469
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:10,590
you felt them quit and it's fucking over.
You know,

470
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,140
but it's never over. Cause
you know, at some point,

471
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,650
some point in your thirties something's
going to come back and something's going

472
00:28:16,651 --> 00:28:19,770
to happen at like a family reunion and
they're going to come at you one more

473
00:28:19,771 --> 00:28:22,590
time. Right. You just give him
the old front face luck, right.

474
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:25,740
And do a back body drop
and then it's fucking over.

475
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:29,700
When she hid their body hit
that linoleum floor. Right.

476
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:33,120
The ankle just clips the counter.
They're fucking done.

477
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,090
I love Rappaport, you know. All right.

478
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:43,320
He's another pasty fucking human being
is out of his fucking mind. Just like me.

479
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:46,080
All right,
let's read a little bit of advertising.

480
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:51,180
Literally advertising here for a,
and when I say little, I mean little,

481

we only got two reads. Everybody. Ah,

482
00:28:54,421 --> 00:28:58,680

there it goes to honey right out the

483
00:28:58,681 --> 00:29:03,050

I'm happy they're doing this for
you because when I was your age,

494
00:29:45,011 --> 00:29:48,400
I had to pay through the nose for fucking
expensive fucking razor blades that

495
00:29:48,401 --> 00:29:53,401
are made out of fucking
plastic and recycled coke
cans and they charge you like

MMM.

00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:47,310
All right.
So all a oh Billy fucking fat cakes.

561
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:52,110
I'm in a writer's room and I have my
blew out my fucking sciatic nerve.

562
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,890
Right? I, uh,

563
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:59,190
so I have not been working out and
I've been trying to eat the best I can,

564
00:33:59,191 --> 00:34:02,010
but I finally bit the bullet and stepped
on the fucking scale the other day and

565
00:34:02,011 --> 00:34:05,700
I was one 83.
So my fighting waits one 72.

566
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:09,270
I went down to one 63 last year.
I knew I couldn't sustain that.

567
00:34:09,271 --> 00:34:14,220
That was like my emaciated fucking,
you know, underwear model weight.

568
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:18,510
But I still, you know, there's never been
a redheaded underwear model, a male one,

569
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:23,610
I don't think, you know,
but there's always a first.

570
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:28,110
Um, so I really want to be like one
72. So, uh, I just said, you know,

571
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:33,150
I started yesterday, uh, I got my
birthday coming up on June 10th, and um,

572
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:38,220
there cannot be an eight anywhere
in my body weight on my birthday,

573
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:42,870
full life. I've just decided that that's
it. It's not fucking happen. And so, uh,

574
00:34:42,871 --> 00:34:45,900
this morning I was one 81.6,
you know,

575
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:48,390
I got my gym right outside
my back's feeling good.

576
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:52,410
I'm actually doing fucking legs and
eggs today, right? Legs and eggs.

577
00:34:52,411 --> 00:34:56,130
The foxy lady. Hey guys, come on
down for legs and eggs. Right.

578
00:34:56,430 --> 00:35:00,120
I'm fucking doing some squats and um,

579
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:01,650
yeah,

580
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:04,920
I'll do the gym is the shit,
the fucking speed bag.

581
00:35:04,921 --> 00:35:06,850
The atomic holds the peg board.

582
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:08,653
MMM.

583
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:11,720
I just walked right up by one,
a fucking bench.

584
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:14,330
I don't have to worry about anything.
You know,

585
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:19,520
I got a wireless fucking
right. I actually don't,

586
00:35:19,521 --> 00:35:23,210
I have this, um, I've got this other
thing, looks like a Marshall amp,

587
00:35:23,211 --> 00:35:27,320
looks like the head of a Marshall amp
and you just plug your phone in there and

588
00:35:27,321 --> 00:35:28,040
uh,

589
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:33,040
and I just crank like fucking ACDC and
fucking all this shit that I love guns

590
00:35:33,861 --> 00:35:37,710
and roses and all that, like
back in the day. And uh,

591
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:42,740
my goal is one time in my life did I
ever put up to 25 and for you meat heads

592
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:49,540
leftover from the fucking eighties to
25 was the shit cause that was two 45

593
00:35:49,861 --> 00:35:51,720
pound plates on both sides.
Right?

594
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:54,870
And you just brought it down
and right back up again.

595
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:59,160
And I did that back when I
weighed about a buck 65. So, um,

596
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:04,390
I am an old man now. So, uh, right
now, you know, I just got the 45,

597
00:36:04,391 --> 00:36:08,060
so on either side, you know, whatever,
I'm working my way back and, uh,

598
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:12,220
I also know how to build myself up without
hurting myself. I always make sure I,

599
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:16,830
if I'm going to go 20 pounds up, that I
can do 20 pounds less at least six times.

600
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,800
And then I just go up and see,
you know,

601
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:23,970
if I can do 20 pounds up like two times,
maybe three.

602
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,240
And I just worked my way up. So, uh,

603
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:32,370
I literally started out with just
20 fives on either side, you know,

604
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,540
did that 10 times and I threw the
35 10 times and I put the 45 on.

605
00:36:36,541 --> 00:36:39,300
I could only do it like
six fucking times thick.

606
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:43,530
But now I'm back up to 10
reps on all of those. And uh,

607
00:36:43,531 --> 00:36:48,270
I just moved up to a buck 55, which
I put up like four times. So, uh,

608
00:36:48,271 --> 00:36:50,700
I should have my eighties body back soon.
You know,

609
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:54,480
we had just totally overdeveloped up
top and then I have my chicken legs.

610
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:56,160
Now it's not happening this time,

611
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:59,940
this time I'm actually going to do the
fucking squat, uh, the squats. So, um,

612
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:05,660
anyways, um, if anybody
else has those atomic holds,

613
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:08,420
like what are you, cause they
give you those, those little,

614
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,860
those plastic bands that you then put
like the c clamp on and then you can swing

615
00:37:12,861 --> 00:37:16,070
from those things. Like what do
you hook the plastic thing from?

616
00:37:16,071 --> 00:37:17,840
I got him on my chin up bar,
but,

617
00:37:17,841 --> 00:37:21,830
but the shit and the ceiling is like
a fish hook, but it's totally closed.

618
00:37:21,831 --> 00:37:23,690
So I can't put the plastic thing in there.

619
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:26,570
I guess I could just fucking email the,
uh,

620
00:37:26,571 --> 00:37:31,190
the company and I could figure out how
to do it. Anyways, let's, let's, uh,

621
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:33,320
literally babbling here.
Oh,

622
00:37:33,321 --> 00:37:37,730
who do you guys like in the Stanley
Cup playoffs in the Stanley Cup final?

623
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:41,120
Um,
I got to tell you,

624
00:37:41,121 --> 00:37:43,910
after watching the sharks beat my blues,

625
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:48,560
I have nothing but respect
for those guys now. And um,

626
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,410
I actually really liked that team.

627
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:53,823
MMM.

628
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:58,270
But then I got a ton of
friends in Pittsburgh. I Dunno.

629
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:03,290
I Dunno. I Dunno what to do. Why
is Sydney Crosby so hateable?

630
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:04,760
Is it the Pouty Lips?

631
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:08,090
Was it the crying after every fucking
call for so many fucking years.

632
00:38:08,091 --> 00:38:10,820
The guy's unbelievable.
He's unbelievable.

633
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:13,413
MMM.

634
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,220
I Dunno. I have no idea
who's going to win that one.

635
00:38:16,221 --> 00:38:18,140
But I'm going to watch Barton.
Nick actually invited me over.

636
00:38:18,141 --> 00:38:18,891
I got to get back to them.

637
00:38:18,891 --> 00:38:21,590
Maybe I'll be able to run over there and
watch this and then if I go over there,

638
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:24,950
I'm not one of those doses that even
if I wanted San Jose to when I would go

639
00:38:24,951 --> 00:38:27,770
over there and I definitely root
for the pence. Uh, you can't,

640
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,340
when you see how happy Joe Barton,

641
00:38:29,341 --> 00:38:31,820
it gives anytime the penguin
score of fucking goal.

642
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:34,310
There's does no way to
not root for the penguins.

643
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:36,130
And I'm not even root the penguins.
I'm just rooting

644
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:41,100
to see Joe Barton a copy.
All right, here we go. Um,

645
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:43,510
s the questions for the
weak, weak, weak, weak,

646
00:38:43,511 --> 00:38:48,170
weak online dating from a lady.
Hi,

647
00:38:48,171 --> 00:38:53,000
bumbling Billy butterballs. I
liked that one. Fumbling, rumbling,

648
00:38:53,001 --> 00:38:54,430
bumbling, stumbling. Um,

649
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:58,370
I actually tweeted about you just see
that four year old kid fell into the

650
00:38:58,371 --> 00:39:03,270
gorilla and closure and then they
killed the gorillas. Um, I said, uh,

651
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:04,390
I tweeted about that.

652
00:39:04,391 --> 00:39:08,380
I was saying how a four
year old does not fall,

653
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:12,940
accidentally fall into a
gorilla and closure. I wrote,

654
00:39:12,941 --> 00:39:16,810
that was a fun Hashtag. Chris Berman. Uh,

655
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:24,020
all right.

656
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:29,610
I am a 26 year old lady and I met this
guy I am really into on an online dating

657
00:39:31,601 --> 00:39:35,800
app. I am not on the APP for hookups
and don't think he is either.

658
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:37,210
We have met,

659
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:41,560
we have met up in public places three
times in the past week and I can really

660
00:39:41,561 --> 00:39:43,510
see potential with them.
That's so,

661
00:39:43,511 --> 00:39:46,840
I'm so fucking jealous that you guys
have that app where it's like I'm not on

662
00:39:46,841 --> 00:39:48,220
there just to hook up with people.

663
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:52,540
Like you literally can turn yourself
into like a Gigolo or a call girl with

664
00:39:52,541 --> 00:39:55,840
regular fucking people. It's
unbelievable. And he said,

665
00:39:55,841 --> 00:39:59,650
we have met up in public places three
times in the past week and I could really

666
00:39:59,651 --> 00:40:03,340
see potential with him. I haven't
been to his actual apartment yet,

667
00:40:03,341 --> 00:40:07,860
but met him once in the parking garage
if his complex and it sounds like a blow

668
00:40:07,861 --> 00:40:10,650
job. Uh, sorry, I shouldn't
have said that. Oh,

669
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:13,870
he wants to hang out and
watch a movie at his place.

670
00:40:13,871 --> 00:40:18,850
I'm not a prude naive or getting any
weird vibes or red flags from him.

671
00:40:18,851 --> 00:40:23,120
I just don't want to put myself in any
potentially dangerous situations or give

672
00:40:23,121 --> 00:40:24,400
him any false science.

673
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:28,840
How soon is too soon after meeting someone
online to hang out at their apartment?

674
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:33,160
Dude, what the fuck? I
don't know. I have no idea.

675
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:38,110
You don't sound comfortable. So I
wouldn't do it. I wouldn't do it. I would,

676
00:40:38,111 --> 00:40:38,944
uh,

677
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:44,020
I think if you're going to spend time
alone with him for the first time,

678
00:40:44,021 --> 00:40:46,270
I would do it at your place

679
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:52,330
and have nine one dialed in
the phone in your hand. I mean,

680
00:40:52,331 --> 00:40:54,130
I don't know if you get in
this kind of a creepy vibe,

681
00:40:54,131 --> 00:40:58,210
are you going to creepy vibe
because, um, you met him online?

682
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:02,000
Um, I, my advice is a,

683
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:05,480
I would not go over there anytime soon
until that whole fucking vibe goes away.

684
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:07,363
Um,

685
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:13,250
and whether you're approved or not
has nothing to do with anything.

686
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:17,390
That's just, it has to
do with being smart. Um,

687
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:21,260
Jesus Christ. Now you got me thinking
there's something wrong with them.

688
00:41:21,261 --> 00:41:25,280
You know what, stay away
from that guy. Um, all right.

689
00:41:25,281 --> 00:41:29,720
Boyfriend doesn't want a dog.
I don't know how to say this.

690
00:41:29,721 --> 00:41:34,610
Hey Billy, is that a French word?
B e with a little hat on the first.

691
00:41:34,611 --> 00:41:38,540
He, now I've got to look it up. Uh, you
know what happens when I do this shit.

692
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:39,943
All right.

693
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:40,730
Okay.

694
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:45,140
Oh, you know what? I actually was looking
up the other day, um, because I'm,

695
00:41:45,141 --> 00:41:47,300
I'm a big fan of the, uh, 83.

696
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:48,620
Yeah.

697
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:52,250
Philadelphia 70 sixers.
I was looking up, uh,

698
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:53,640
okay.

699
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:57,240
The, uh, Saint Louis spirits,

700
00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:02,490
which was a, um, an ABA team.

701
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:03,930
Okay.

702
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:06,980
French to English translation. There
we go. It was, it's an ABA team.

703
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:11,180
Oh, let me stop it. You fucking asshole.

704
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:12,733
Um,

705
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:13,690
okay.

706
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:18,260
Hey, Billy, stupid. Um, what was I gonna
say? Uh, I actually looked it up, the, uh,

707
00:42:18,261 --> 00:42:21,100
the Saint Louis spirits and,
um,

708
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:26,140
did some of the cool nicknames. Coolest
Nick's names ever. They had a guy,

709
00:42:26,141 --> 00:42:31,140
bad news, barns, fly Williams,
and then Moses Malone.

710
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:35,620
Moses didn't even need a fucking
nickname with the, with uh,

711
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:39,250
with this, that had been his
real name. Moses, Moses Malone,

712
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:44,370
bad news barns, fly Williams.
And uh, I watched it.

713
00:42:44,371 --> 00:42:46,540
I don't know if there's,
I think there's a 30 for 30 on it.

714
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:49,840
It seemed like I saw a trailer for it
and Bob Costas supposed to going like,

715
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:53,740
do you need to know anything about the
Aba? That team was the fucking Aba.

716
00:42:53,741 --> 00:42:55,090
Everything that was great about it.

717
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:58,720
And I believe Bob Costas
is a Missouri Guy and uh,

718
00:42:58,721 --> 00:43:03,670
so I think that he was doing all those
games. Um, if I ever meet Bob Costas,

719
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:06,970
that's the Shit I'm going to ask
them about out of fucking everything.

720
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:11,410
That's what I would want to talk
to him about is about the, uh,

721
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:12,400
the Aba.

722
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:13,323
Yeah.

723
00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:16,650
Where he got his start and all that. Just
can't fucking believe that, you know,

724
00:43:16,651 --> 00:43:21,510
he got to see all that stuff.
Um, so anyways, here we
go. Billy Billy. Bet Billy.

725
00:43:21,511 --> 00:43:22,250
Stupid. All right. Yeah.

726
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:24,500
Yeah.
I'm a longtime lady listener.

727
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:29,690
I love your standup specials and F
is for family is amazing. Thank you.

728
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:31,970
A nice work. Thank you. Thanks again.

729
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:37,000
I'm 29 and I just moved away from Seattle
to San Antonio with my air force pilot

730
00:43:37,491 --> 00:43:41,540
boyfriend hour. Right? A
100 summer is that one go.

731
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:46,130
If we go into the wild blue yonder,

732
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:51,950
this is my first time living away from
home and he's gone a lot for work.

733
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:55,700
I thought it would be a good idea
for us to get a dog to keep me sane.

734
00:43:55,701 --> 00:44:00,200
I love animals and was a part time dog
walker in Seattle. My boyfriend, however,

735
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:04,040
has never owned a pet in his life and
isn't hot on the idea of having a dog.

736
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:07,400
He's from Iowa and he believes
livestock should live,

737
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:11,030
shouldn't live indoors.
Oh Jesus.

738
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:13,730
I've owned cats and dogs my entire life.
In fact,

739
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:18,230
I had to leave my 17 year old cat
behind in Seattle and it broke my heart.

740
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:23,590
Can you offer any persuasive words to
help bring him around or should I just

741
00:44:23,901 --> 00:44:27,860
drop it? Thanks for the laugh
and go fuck yourself. Um,

742
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:33,300
how do you bring them around?
Well, you could do it. My wife did.

743
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:38,700
And you foster air, quote a
rescue dog. That's what happens.

744
00:44:38,701 --> 00:44:40,650
You foster a rescue dog,
which means yeah,

745
00:44:40,651 --> 00:44:45,651
just have it for the weekend and as
the bit when in my act I went from,

746
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:51,650
there's no fucking way I'm keeping this
dog in and a 48 hour period when all the

747
00:44:52,201 --> 00:44:54,660
way to, oh my God, this
thing's going to die some day.

748
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:57,430
How am I emotionally going to
be able to handle this? Okay.

749
00:44:57,630 --> 00:44:58,463
MMM.

750
00:44:59,210 --> 00:45:03,750
You could do that. Um, I don't listen.

751
00:45:03,770 --> 00:45:07,730
Well this is what I would do either way.
No matter how this works out,

752
00:45:07,731 --> 00:45:11,800
I would get a small dog. Okay. Small dogs.

753
00:45:11,801 --> 00:45:15,170
Small problems. Okay. Small expenses,

754
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:19,780
small shifts to pick up. Is your
house breaking the fucking thing? Um,

755
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:21,860
how's training? Whatever the
fuck it is. Not a horse pill.

756
00:45:21,861 --> 00:45:23,690
You don't ride the thing.
Um,

757
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:25,230
okay.

758
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:28,680
How would you do this? Well, it
sounds like he doesn't want to do it.

759
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:33,760
Why would he call it livestock?
Not Livestock. It's a fucking pet.

760
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:35,463
MMM.

761
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:39,360
I Dunno. You know what it is. This
is the thing. If you foster a dog,

762
00:45:39,390 --> 00:45:40,470
this is what's going to happen.

763
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:43,680
So this guy grew up on a farm or he
grew up in Iowa. This is the thing,

764
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:45,750
when you fucking come home on a farm,

765
00:45:45,751 --> 00:45:49,620
a cow's not flipping out and
excited to see neither is a horse.

766
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:53,310
They can do little things, but nobody
gets excited like a fucking dog.

767
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:56,770
You know what I mean?
It's like a Dick Vital Taylor,

768
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:00,993
right?

769
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:02,000
John,
you come home,

770
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:06,410
your dog flips out like you just dunk
the ball on a fast break and the other

771
00:46:06,411 --> 00:46:09,560
team called timeout.
That's the way your dog fucking reacts.

772
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:13,610
Now I know from experiences when I was
just a boy and I would walk to school and

773
00:46:13,611 --> 00:46:17,720
I used to feed this horse every day on
the way bill, is this a Tom Sawyer movie?

774
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:21,920
No, it isn't. This was my childhood and I
remember one time it wouldn't come over.

775
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:24,360
So I walked away and I fuck.

776
00:46:24,370 --> 00:46:28,040
When I look back it was doing that walk
or was nodding its head and flipping out

777
00:46:28,041 --> 00:46:30,440
for whatever fucking reason.
It was like playing hard to get.

778
00:46:30,441 --> 00:46:34,340
So I know that they can, I guess on some
level show a certain level of emotion,

779
00:46:34,341 --> 00:46:36,950
but like, um, I think maybe, um,

780
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:38,530
yeah,

781
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:42,550
I dunno what kind of dog, if you get a
little dog that has a nice mushed up face,

782
00:46:42,551 --> 00:46:43,384
you know?

783
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:44,933
MMM.

784
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:50,140
Maybe like one of those French bulldogs
something that snores and Farsi you'd

785
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:54,440
get boyfriend can find it funny. I have
no idea. Uh, maybe a dog like that,

786
00:46:54,510 --> 00:46:55,343
but uh,

787
00:46:56,410 --> 00:47:00,760
I find it hard to fucking believe unless
he grew up on a farm and anybody grew

788
00:47:00,761 --> 00:47:03,520
up on a fucking farm on a certain level.

789
00:47:03,521 --> 00:47:07,630
Like they got this cold blooded
next to them, you know what I mean?

790
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:12,190
They've just seen too much.
They've seen fucking animals slaughtered,

791
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:13,833
you know?

792
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:14,490
Okay.

793
00:47:14,490 --> 00:47:17,720
You know, like when they're a kid like
did dad goes, you want chicken for dinner?

794
00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:19,490
Is that what you want?

795
00:47:20,230 --> 00:47:23,090
She crying. You want chicken for
dinner? All right. He come out here,

796
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:27,770
you come out of here, right. Come on
out. Which ones is going to be dad?

797
00:47:27,771 --> 00:47:29,980
I don't want chicken anymore. No. You said

798
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:34,810
you want a chicken up. Pick one APP. Boy,

799
00:47:34,811 --> 00:47:38,660
if you don't fucking, I'm gonna
fucking have you per day interview one.

800
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:43,390
Then he fucking just grabs it,
puts it on the chopping block,

801
00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:48,840
and then hands that kid the fucking
clever. Go on and do it. I said,

802
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:52,570
damn right. They live through
that. It like the age of six.

803
00:47:53,530 --> 00:47:56,560
So they don't look at
animals the way we do.

804
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:58,750
And I gotta be honest with you.

805
00:47:58,751 --> 00:48:03,310
I remember one time I saw this guy shoot
a fucking cow because it was bullying

806
00:48:03,311 --> 00:48:07,120
the other fucking, it was shot a steer
because it was bullying the other steer.

807
00:48:07,121 --> 00:48:11,170
They couldn't figure out why
the, you know, you know, they,

808
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:15,430
they'd come back the next morning and
like two or three cows look like they

809
00:48:15,431 --> 00:48:17,800
fucking,
somebody tried to do a scrap,

810
00:48:17,830 --> 00:48:20,710
extrapolate some fucking information
from them. Right? Is that the right word?

811
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:24,940
I don't know. Um, but they
got slapped around, you know,

812
00:48:24,941 --> 00:48:27,110
like they walked into a door and they
couldn't figure out what the fuck,

813
00:48:27,111 --> 00:48:29,620
slapping the shit out of these stair.
And it turned,

814
00:48:29,621 --> 00:48:31,810
they figured out which one it
was. So they were like, all right,

815
00:48:31,811 --> 00:48:33,940
we got to kill this fucking thing,
but here's the deal.

816
00:48:33,941 --> 00:48:37,900
We don't want the thing to be stressed
before it's killed because that'll affect

817
00:48:37,901 --> 00:48:42,010
the taste of the meat.
So what they do is they just sewed it up,

818
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:46,870
put do booboo, do we do, do they just
sort of pen it in and yeah, you know,

819
00:48:48,510 --> 00:48:52,540
how are you doing? Do we do pick, do. And
then they just fucking take out a gun.

820
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:57,550
Blam they fucking kill it.
Right. And I was like, oh my God.

821
00:48:57,551 --> 00:48:58,420
So then they,

822
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:03,840
the guy had like this fucking this
tractor and they tied up the back things,

823
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:07,600
the back of its legs,
they tied it puts back legs,

824
00:49:07,601 --> 00:49:09,640
and then they just lifted
it up off the ground.

825
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:11,890
Then they gutted the fucking thing.

826
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:15,490
All the blood's pouring out
all the fucking end trails.

827
00:49:15,491 --> 00:49:19,450
And I'm just sitting there going, oh
my God, I'm never eaten meat again.

828
00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:23,140
This is fucking horrific.
Right? And then they,

829
00:49:23,170 --> 00:49:26,410
once they fucking chop the head
and the legs off and they get,

830
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:31,190
they get the for the hide off and
they started chopping it up. Ah,

831
00:49:31,350 --> 00:49:32,950
I went from like,
Oh my God,

832
00:49:32,951 --> 00:49:37,060
I'm never eating meat again to my
mouth watering gone, holy fuck.

833
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:39,070
Look at all those stakes.

834
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:44,770
And this guy was cutting them in like
four inch fucking slabs like Fred

835
00:49:44,770 --> 00:49:46,960
Flinstone fucking stakes.
And it's just like, dude,

836
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:50,860
you could literally eat yourself to death
and not get a third of the way through

837
00:49:50,861 --> 00:49:55,420
that fucking cow cattle or what a
steer or whatever the fuck it is. Um,

838
00:49:56,500 --> 00:50:00,580
so I think the thing about it is, is if
he grew up in Iowa, anywhere near a farm,

839
00:50:00,610 --> 00:50:04,690
that's how they look. And animals,
they look at it like, you know,

840
00:50:04,691 --> 00:50:09,580
this is a food source and don't
get too emotionally attached to it.

841
00:50:09,581 --> 00:50:12,580
Keep it outside.
Do not give it a fucking name.

842
00:50:13,330 --> 00:50:15,220
And when it can't make you any more money,

843
00:50:15,370 --> 00:50:19,030
you give it the old fucking right there,
Fred. So he might be a loss costs,

844
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:24,430
you know what I mean?
And as bad as that might be for you.

845
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:29,790
I got to tell you like the fact that he
can wall off those feelings like that is

846
00:50:29,811 --> 00:50:33,470
great if you ever have an intruder
because God help him when that guy,

847
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:36,380
when the intruder gets
those farm hands around them

848
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:44,900
fucking throwing bales of Hay since he
was four years at the farm, boy strength,

849
00:50:45,590 --> 00:50:48,770
Jesus Christ, that
fucking, all those fucking,

850
00:50:48,771 --> 00:50:53,510
every offensive lineman for Nebraska
just grew up fucking punching,

851
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:58,440
steer in the Goddamn head, the
fucking maniacs. So, um, Eh,

852
00:50:58,490 --> 00:51:01,010
the fact that he grew up in Iowa,
it might be a lost cause.

853
00:51:01,011 --> 00:51:05,360
So I would just say try fostering
a dog and try to just get,

854
00:51:05,361 --> 00:51:08,990
get one that is cool and chills.
What if you,

855
00:51:09,110 --> 00:51:10,460
if your boyfriend's active,

856
00:51:10,461 --> 00:51:13,370
maybe you want something that's a
little more athletic but like, you know,

857
00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:16,580
you're going to have a dog
that just wants to chill.

858
00:51:16,581 --> 00:51:19,790
Why you watch the fucking game? I mean,
that's the best. That's why I love my dog.

859
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:24,620
My dog is fucking shredded. It makes me
want to work out. But then also, you know,

860
00:51:24,621 --> 00:51:27,620
it is down to take a nap and
he fucking time you want,

861
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:31,850
it's not like those sheep herd and
fucking lunatic dogs that have like add.

862
00:51:31,851 --> 00:51:36,770
And if you don't give it a
project, it starts fucking
eaten the door, you know? Uh,

863
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:41,790
but anyways, good luck with that
shit. All right. Beyonce is album, uh,

864
00:51:41,850 --> 00:51:43,220
dear Billy def jam.

865
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:47,510
My girlfriend was listening to the new
Beyonce album for a couple days straight.

866
00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:51,410
I let her listen because, uh,
we usually listen to my music,

867
00:51:51,411 --> 00:51:55,370
which is music she loves.
Anyways, I didn't say it's funny.

868
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:58,670
I let her listen and you know what?
It's okay. You can listen to that. Um,

869
00:51:58,790 --> 00:52:00,830
I didn't say anything
for the first few days,

870
00:52:00,831 --> 00:52:03,710
but then I just started getting
sick of hearing the same songs.

871
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:07,400
She understood this and did not take
offense because she's a great girl and I

872
00:52:07,401 --> 00:52:10,840
don't waste my time with shitty
girlfriends who can't communicate through.

873
00:52:10,841 --> 00:52:14,170
I got to admit, right now at this
point, you sound like, you know, a girl.

874
00:52:14,171 --> 00:52:17,070
She's a great girl. As long. She wants
to do everything you wanted to do.

875
00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:20,390
She's a great girl.
I'd say I'm sick of the two days.

876
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:23,480
I'm sick of your music and she's been
listening to your music for fucking ever.

877
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:26,900
Uh, maybe I'm reading into
this. Anyways, later that night,

878
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:30,860
we're at a bar with their friends
or their friend who is really,

879
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:34,920
who has a really annoying name
that rhymes with small lien.

880
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:40,610
She brings up the album,
the Beyonce album and how great it is.

881
00:52:40,611 --> 00:52:45,470
And my girl laughs and says, yeah, I
burnt this guy out with it pointing to me.

882
00:52:45,770 --> 00:52:50,360
Her friend saw this as an opening to
regurgitate every stupid soundbite she's

883
00:52:50,361 --> 00:52:51,590
read on a blog.

884
00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:56,950
Apparently I'm not comfortable with women
being in a dominant position or if a

885
00:52:58,191 --> 00:53:03,080
guy did what she did, I
wouldn't care. Uh, yeah,

886
00:53:03,081 --> 00:53:03,831
I know this,
this,

887
00:53:03,831 --> 00:53:08,420
this happened when that Alannis
Morissette album came out and I remember

888
00:53:08,421 --> 00:53:11,510
enjoying some of the music and
some woman in a bar was going like,

889
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:15,610
do I even know what the song is the
bat like? Like I should like, like a,

890
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:16,351
like I had some,

891
00:53:16,351 --> 00:53:19,220
a relationship with the Atlantis and
she was yelling at me like I don't

892
00:53:19,221 --> 00:53:23,480
understand it. You know what I mean?
The songs see the fucking, you know,

893
00:53:23,481 --> 00:53:26,610
either like the music or you
don't, I don't give a fuck
what she's singing about.

894
00:53:26,630 --> 00:53:27,463
Right.

895
00:53:27,610 --> 00:53:28,443
MMM.

896
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:32,310
At the end of the day. Yeah. If you could
fuck me fucking be singing row, row,

897
00:53:32,311 --> 00:53:35,760
row your boat. If it sounds
good, I'm going to listen to it.

898
00:53:35,790 --> 00:53:40,790
Like I'm not necessarily a fan of her
shit but that one that she did with Jack

899
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:40,981
White,

900
00:53:40,981 --> 00:53:45,330
I liked that song cause cause the song
sounds good and I've heard it like 10

901
00:53:45,331 --> 00:53:50,070
times cause knee has been playing it and
I can not tell you one fucking lyric in

902
00:53:50,071 --> 00:53:54,690
it. I don't know. I don't even know
what it's about. Um, but anyways,

903
00:53:55,050 --> 00:53:58,050
I finally had to interrupt her and
explained that while I think she's,

904
00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:02,140
what she's singing about
is annoying.

905
00:54:02,141 --> 00:54:03,760
You said it annoying is annoying.

906
00:54:03,970 --> 00:54:08,410
My only complaint was that I was tired
of hearing the same song songs for three

907
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:09,244
days straight.

908
00:54:09,310 --> 00:54:14,310
She wouldn't even listen ignoring me and
the words coming out of my calm mouth

909
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:17,620
dismissing logic.
I turned to my girlfriend and said,

910
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:20,680
how can a girl is smart as you have such,

911
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:24,940
such one dismiss.
Oh,

912
00:54:24,941 --> 00:54:29,490
such a one dimensional friend.
Yup.

913
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:32,220
She tossed what was
left of her drink on me.

914
00:54:32,950 --> 00:54:33,510
Okay.

915
00:54:33,510 --> 00:54:35,190
Wow.
This chick is way out of line.

916
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:38,650
It was a beer bottle
that was almost empty.

917
00:54:38,651 --> 00:54:40,390
I barely got any drops on me.

918
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:45,580
She got mad when I laughed and turned
and stomped off. Did I say too much?

919
00:54:45,610 --> 00:54:49,660
Did I say too little? Listen, I'm not
saying you're not a dick. I think,

920
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:54,160
uh, I think you said, I think
what you said was perfect.

921
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:55,650
Okay.

922
00:54:55,650 --> 00:54:59,810
You know what I mean?
Like to be honest with you,

923
00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:05,010
at some point your girlfriend should
have stepped in and being lent pen like

924
00:55:05,011 --> 00:55:09,690
guys got, maybe she was guys, guys,
settle down, settle down, settle down. Um,

925
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:13,730
but whenever an album like
this comes up, I mean, she,

926
00:55:13,790 --> 00:55:17,750
she realizes that that album is just
like a big fucking, isn't that like,

927
00:55:19,130 --> 00:55:19,963
you know,

928
00:55:21,270 --> 00:55:24,060
just like a big fucking, what
do they call it? Trolling,

929
00:55:24,210 --> 00:55:27,210
isn't she just acting like that happened?
I mean,

930
00:55:27,211 --> 00:55:30,990
I don't think she let calluses grow on
her feet and do all that shit that she

931
00:55:30,991 --> 00:55:31,824
said.

932
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:38,820
She always looks like she just came from
the spa and I don't give a fuck what

933
00:55:38,821 --> 00:55:42,040
that guy did. I don't think
she's interrupting that. Um,

934
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:44,790
maybe she made the help go
down and go through that,

935
00:55:45,350 --> 00:55:48,930
that biblical Shit that she was talking
about, but uh, but whatever, you know,

936
00:55:48,931 --> 00:55:52,470
they got to have that fucking, you
know, not everything's for you,

937
00:55:52,471 --> 00:55:55,890
but I understand if someone's like
playing an album three days straight,

938
00:55:56,190 --> 00:55:59,190
you'd go fucking nuts. Um, but

939
00:56:01,310 --> 00:56:02,360
I think I,
yeah,

940
00:56:02,361 --> 00:56:07,361
I think you went too far
because you insulted your
girlfriend's girlfriend by in

941
00:56:09,261 --> 00:56:11,510
a roundabout way,
insulting your own girlfriend.

942
00:56:12,890 --> 00:56:13,723
MMM.

943
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:20,380
You know, but that you have to
understand like women like that,

944
00:56:21,130 --> 00:56:24,040
like in this day and age,
like this is like,

945
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,033
mmm,

946
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:30,820
this so into that shit that you're not
going to convince them one way or the

947
00:56:30,821 --> 00:56:35,620
other. That's like the type of person
that acts like an asshole and just goes,

948
00:56:35,621 --> 00:56:39,280
you know, guys are intimidated by me and
at no point have they ever examining,

949
00:56:39,310 --> 00:56:42,640
examining like their own behavior.
It's like a, did I tell you what guys,

950
00:56:42,641 --> 00:56:43,480
when I was in Seattle,

951
00:56:43,481 --> 00:56:47,530
when that woman came up and fucking
slammed her hands on the stage,

952
00:56:47,531 --> 00:56:50,920
cause like the stage was up to her chin
and it scared the shit out of me cause I

953
00:56:50,921 --> 00:56:52,480
couldn't see anything
because the lights were on.

954
00:56:52,481 --> 00:56:54,160
I thought someone had jumped on stage.

955
00:56:55,130 --> 00:56:55,550
MMM.

956
00:56:55,550 --> 00:56:58,320
And I felt like that jolt, like right
before you're going to get into a fight.

957
00:56:58,321 --> 00:57:03,120
And I looked down and there
was this woman, you know,
screaming at me or whatever.

958
00:57:03,450 --> 00:57:06,900
And I just said,
first of all,

959
00:57:06,901 --> 00:57:11,130
she was standing there forever and no,
no security did anything. And I joked,

960
00:57:11,131 --> 00:57:14,100
I said to the guys in the
crowd, be like, dude, how,

961
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:18,690
how many times would we have been choked
out at this point and dragged out of

962
00:57:18,691 --> 00:57:23,340
here and thrown into the throne in, into
fucking traffic. This is one of these, uh,

963
00:57:23,370 --> 00:57:27,260
women privileged moments where you can
just disrupt a fucking show and suits

964
00:57:27,261 --> 00:57:31,860
been standing there yelling at me for
like 30 seconds and nobody moved to do

965
00:57:31,861 --> 00:57:32,694
anything.

966
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:34,713
MMM.

967
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:39,130
And then finally I just said, ma'am,
can you, can you please take your seat?

968
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:41,020
And she goes, Oh, I'll take my seat,

969
00:57:41,021 --> 00:57:44,680
but I don't need your permission is
what she said. And it was just like,

970
00:57:45,610 --> 00:57:47,860
it's like, all right, I get it.
You're a feminist. But like, you know,

971
00:57:47,890 --> 00:57:52,090
you're applying it.
Like in this instance,

972
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:56,530
I'm not the bad guy. You're,
you're, you're the asshole.
I know you have a vagina.

973
00:57:56,531 --> 00:58:00,430
So that makes you this terminal victim
in your fucking world and that you can

974
00:58:00,431 --> 00:58:02,230
never be in the wrong,
but believer it or not,

975
00:58:02,231 --> 00:58:05,480
at some point you can be
the fucking asshole and

976
00:58:05,670 --> 00:58:06,503
mmm.

977
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:11,990
What you did was you,
you remain calm.

978
00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:13,200
Yeah.

979
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:17,610
Which is the way to beat anybody in a
fucking argument is as they get heated,

980
00:58:17,611 --> 00:58:21,150
you just stay calm.
And when she had nothing else,

981
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:23,190
uh,

982
00:58:23,190 --> 00:58:26,790
she threw your, your drink at you and
then, and then fucking stormed off.

983
00:58:26,791 --> 00:58:30,390
So it was weird you won that
argument, but, uh, your,

984
00:58:30,391 --> 00:58:33,150
your girlfriend and apology because,
uh,

985
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:37,440
you made shit weird between
her and her girlfriend and

986
00:58:37,570 --> 00:58:38,403
mmm.

987
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:40,880
Then he kind of insulted
your on girlfriend in a way.

988
00:58:42,050 --> 00:58:42,883
Uh,

989
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:46,520
having said that, I applaud you for saying
that because that's fucking hilarious.

990
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:50,870
And I actually wish I could have seen
that because anytime it's those types of

991
00:58:50,871 --> 00:58:55,460
songs come out, there's always said that,
that type of shit of like, uh, you know,

992
00:58:56,390 --> 00:58:59,870
Oh, you're just saying that because this,
you just saying that because that, and

993
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:01,680
yeah.

994
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:02,250
You know,
I,

995
00:59:02,250 --> 00:59:06,090
I don't know it because you know what I
don't like about that shit is then you

996
00:59:06,091 --> 00:59:09,210
just, you just have this built in
fucking excuse. So it's like, oh,

997
00:59:09,211 --> 00:59:14,160
so you're never in the wrong, if I
call you out and say, you know, x,

998
00:59:14,161 --> 00:59:17,520
Y, and Z, it's because of my
own issues. It's never you.

999
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:19,433
MMM.

1000
00:59:20,130 --> 00:59:22,100
Jesus Christ.
That takes me back to daisy

1001
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:24,200
Buchanan's in like 1990,

1002
00:59:24,201 --> 00:59:28,940
whatever when that Atlanta
more set fucking album came
out. All right, here we go.

1003
00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:30,200
Okay.

1004
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:34,520
Bobby boxing or porn.
Jesus Christ is a, uh,

1005
00:59:35,610 --> 00:59:39,360
it's fucking wide variety on this one.
A dear bill.

1006
00:59:39,361 --> 00:59:42,870
I'm facing a dilemma in my life and I
was hoping to gain an outside opinion.

1007
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:46,560
I'm a 20 year old male and I've
always had aspirations of becoming a

1008
00:59:46,561 --> 00:59:49,380
professional boxer.
However, I have a problem.

1009
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:54,860
I fear that I'm addicted to sex.
What?

1010
00:59:55,310 --> 00:59:58,460
I already don't believe this. This
is such a fucking left turn. I don't,

1011
00:59:58,461 --> 01:00:01,880
I believe this is causing problems
in my relationship with my fiance.

1012
01:00:01,881 --> 01:00:04,910
I absolutely,
I'm absolutely in love with this woman.

1013
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:08,600
She goes out of her way to make me
happy, sacrifice. So I got the hiccups.

1014
01:00:08,601 --> 01:00:10,840
I wolf down my breakfast before this.
Um,

1015
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:14,780
she goes out of her way to make me happy,
sacrifice so much,

1016
01:00:14,781 --> 01:00:18,590
just to be with me and
also pleasures me often.

1017
01:00:19,610 --> 01:00:23,760
Rofes what can you just
say? You have a nice,

1018
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:28,150
you have a wonderful sex
life. Pleasures me often. Um,

1019
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:32,870
I got a picture of you with
your head thrown back. Ah,

1020
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:35,340
why would you do that to
me yet? Can't. All right.

1021
01:00:35,341 --> 01:00:38,370
The only problem is my
sexual frustration with her.

1022
01:00:38,970 --> 01:00:43,530
We have passionate sex many times during
the week, but I still want it even more.

1023
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:48,000
Eventually ending up growing angry and
resentful towards her when she doesn't

1024
01:00:48,001 --> 01:00:52,620
want to. Jesus, don't go rub one out,
uh, in later feeling like an asshole.

1025
01:00:52,621 --> 01:00:56,310
This brings me to ask myself,
should I just fuck for a living?

1026
01:00:58,140 --> 01:01:03,060
My fiance and past partners have always
complimented me on my performance in bed

1027
01:01:03,061 --> 01:01:06,690
and my stamina. Jesus Christ. This
guy's going hard on memorial day,

1028
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:11,400
so we have a parade for you going
up to three hours on occasions.

1029
01:01:16,350 --> 01:01:20,040
I love the sport of boxing and
have always wore work toward that.

1030
01:01:20,041 --> 01:01:23,790
But this problem I have sometimes just
makes me want to drop everything and go

1031
01:01:23,791 --> 01:01:27,390
fuck the world anytime.
Any advice,

1032
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:31,710
this is real or fake. This is great. Any
advice you have regarding this problem,

1033
01:01:31,711 --> 01:01:35,040
my relationship or career path will
be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

1034
01:01:35,041 --> 01:01:39,840
And Go fuck yourself. Well,
look, if you're boxing, you're
in great shape. You know,

1035
01:01:40,110 --> 01:01:42,210
I don't know if you've
got the Porno Dick or not,

1036
01:01:42,870 --> 01:01:44,920
but you definitely got
the stamina. Like, dude,

1037
01:01:44,921 --> 01:01:47,490
you don't want to go into that world
if you have other fucking options,

1038
01:01:47,491 --> 01:01:50,070
you don't want to go into that world.
And um,

1039
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:51,820
okay.

1040
01:01:51,820 --> 01:01:55,270
You know that I really,

1041
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:59,770
there's very few like the people who seem
to make them the zillions of dollars,

1042
01:02:00,190 --> 01:02:03,520
which is still really hard to do at this
point because porno was become free,

1043
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:05,140
seems to be the women.

1044
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:07,113
MMM.

1045
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:10,410
They seem to be the ones that can become,

1046
01:02:10,590 --> 01:02:13,340
be a star just because guys watch
I guess way more of it. Yeah.

1047
01:02:14,170 --> 01:02:15,003
MMM.

1048
01:02:16,050 --> 01:02:20,880
So I would say, uh, Jesus Christ,

1049
01:02:20,881 --> 01:02:23,300
am I going to tell you to go get
your head kicked in or a fucking

1050
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:29,700
go join the dark world of
porn? Um, I would say boxing.

1051
01:02:29,730 --> 01:02:32,460
I would say this is what I would do if
I was you. You know, you usually say,

1052
01:02:32,461 --> 01:02:36,360
if you looked at you, you know
something with your fucking sex drive,

1053
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:39,480
they always say, you know,
boxes right before a big fight.

1054
01:02:39,481 --> 01:02:42,360
They abstain from sex for
10 days. Dude, you know,

1055
01:02:42,361 --> 01:02:45,120
you're only problems going to be coming
in. Then your balls are going to be,

1056
01:02:45,121 --> 01:02:48,270
feel like they're fucking through
the, the, the, the tarmac would avail.

1057
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:51,350
You call it the squared circle.
Um,

1058
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:56,710
yeah.
I say you keep fucking boxing.

1059
01:02:57,370 --> 01:03:01,720
You abstain from sex and uh,
hopefully you're good at,

1060
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:05,380
you're good at boxing.
You know that is not,

1061
01:03:05,410 --> 01:03:10,060
that's not a fucking good profession to
just be okay yet because you're going to

1062
01:03:10,061 --> 01:03:13,120
be fucking, you know, your
brain's going to be mush.

1063
01:03:13,870 --> 01:03:14,740
MMM.

1064
01:03:16,050 --> 01:03:20,760
Why don't you just, why don't you try
a, the UFC at least she got a chance.

1065
01:03:20,761 --> 01:03:24,530
If you can tap out,
you can just get fucking get.

1066
01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:26,200
Okay.

1067
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:27,610
That's it.
You'll get knocked out.

1068
01:03:27,611 --> 01:03:30,760
You don't take a bunch of
head shots in the UFC, but I
mean, you can get, you know,

1069
01:03:30,761 --> 01:03:32,290
an arm bar.
I'd rather have an arm bar.

1070
01:03:32,291 --> 01:03:35,540
They'd be knocked out because you can
tap out before they pop out. You fucked,

1071
01:03:35,550 --> 01:03:39,760
dislocate your elbow, you get choked
out, which sounds horrific to me,

1072
01:03:39,761 --> 01:03:41,890
but every professional fighter
I've ever seen, it's like, dude,

1073
01:03:41,891 --> 01:03:43,720
I'd much rather get choked
out then knocked out.

1074
01:03:44,390 --> 01:03:47,980
But you just go to sleep and then
the ref stops. It. If fine. Right.

1075
01:03:48,850 --> 01:03:53,440
Um, I've got to tell you, that's one
of the artists questions I've ever had.

1076
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:55,113
MMM.

1077
01:03:58,110 --> 01:04:02,760
I Dunno, Dude. But God help you. If
you become successful as a, as a boxer,

1078
01:04:02,761 --> 01:04:05,390
you are going to become famous and
God help your relationship then.

1079
01:04:06,550 --> 01:04:07,383
MMM.

1080
01:04:11,790 --> 01:04:14,730
There's no way to jerk it out of yourself.
Go out and lay on the front lawn,

1081
01:04:14,731 --> 01:04:15,800
like one of those sprinklers.

1082
01:04:19,310 --> 01:04:20,260
Just fucking,
you know,

1083
01:04:20,261 --> 01:04:22,960
shoot all your ges out and then get
on with you fucking day to go do your

1084
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:25,720
roadwork running with your
hoodie and you'd timberlands on.

1085
01:04:25,721 --> 01:04:28,120
I don't know what to tell you,
dude. That's, that's way beyond me.

1086
01:04:28,121 --> 01:04:30,280
You sound like you need a,
you need a therapist.

1087
01:04:30,970 --> 01:04:31,803
MMM.

1088
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:35,950
Jesus Christ.
I want to believe that that one was true.

1089
01:04:35,951 --> 01:04:39,220
I don't know about that one. But anyways,
that is the podcast for this week.

1090
01:04:39,221 --> 01:04:40,270
Happy Memorial Day.

1091
01:04:40,271 --> 01:04:45,040
Everybody enjoy your day
off and I'll check on, um,

1092
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:49,420
on Thursday. Yeah, that's right.
All right. Go Fuck Yourself.
