1
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:03,360
Hey,
what's going on is bill burn?

2
00:00:03,361 --> 00:00:06,830
It's time for the Monday
morning podcast from Monday, uh,

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,810
February 5th,

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,000
2018 what's going and on how,

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,300
how are you doing?

6
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,870
I'm actually doing pretty
good after a super bowl loss.

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:24,230
Congratulations to the Philadelphia
Eagles winning their first super bowl

8
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,910
championship. Bobo. The first one,

9
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:32,550
the first one's the best one.
Um,

10
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:35,550
if my team hadn't lost,

11
00:00:35,551 --> 00:00:39,960
I would have gone online or something
like that just to watch grown men crying

12
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,020
in Philadelphia over sports,

13
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:47,460
which is one of my favorite things ever.
Um,

14
00:00:47,461 --> 00:00:50,370
I remember when the Patriots won their
first one. I was actually at the game,

15
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,700
haven't gone previously to when we
lost to fucking bread five Bruh.

16
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:57,360
He took off his helmet
and ran down the field.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,120
I bet it's age and cried on that play.
We're going to make so much money.

18
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,890
Look at him. He's so adorable. Um,

19
00:01:07,891 --> 00:01:12,870
have you seen a picture of his Dick
Lately? No. Um, I just remember when we

20
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,060
kicked that field goal and we won and
I've got to say we, by the way, people go,

21
00:01:18,061 --> 00:01:20,910
oh, real. You will know
the field. Yeah. Well,

22
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:25,770
I get shit when my team loses. All
right. Whenever your team wins,

23
00:01:25,771 --> 00:01:30,080
people go, um, you weren't
playing, but if your team loses,

24
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:34,110
then they got, fuck you guys.
You guys lost. So suck a dick.

25
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,880
All right. We lost just
today. Anyways. Um, yeah,

26
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,470
I remember when we kicked a field goal
to win the fucking thing and everybody,

27
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,540
everybody tackled each other.
And I got up,

28
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,720
there was this guy just standing there
was just standing like tears in his eyes.

29
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:55,170
Like he was going to fucking start crying
and my eyes met his and he was looking

30
00:01:55,171 --> 00:01:57,060
at me. It's so weird. To this day,

31
00:01:57,061 --> 00:01:59,490
it's still weirdest moment that
I've had with another male.

32
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:06,600
I could see if we were at a fucking
funeral of Jesus Christ, you know, man,

33
00:02:06,601 --> 00:02:11,100
the fuck up. And I also remember,
um, if I was in Philadelphia,

34
00:02:11,101 --> 00:02:13,050
I would want to hear from that guy.

35
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,190
One of my favorite things this year
in the football season was when

36
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:19,740
dad got,

37
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:24,360
and Carson Wentz went down
and that Eagle's fan called
in the radio station and

38
00:02:24,361 --> 00:02:28,050
started breaking down crying to the
point he freaked out. The radio host,

39
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,530
he called up, he was like
sorta complaining that all
of a sudden he's just like,

40
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,770
when's it going to happen for us?

41
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:34,813
No

42
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:42,710
can radios is going like buddy,
buddy, you're crying for hours.

43
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,450
It was great.
It was just fucking great.

44
00:02:44,451 --> 00:02:48,320
So I would love to hear that guys followup
call, he's probably crying even more.

45
00:02:48,321 --> 00:02:49,154
So

46
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,760
I really wish when I finally saw the
eagles win the Superbowl that they weren't

47
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,800
playing my team so I could have
enjoyed it more because is something

48
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:04,510
as a sports fan that I really enjoy
because there's only a two two fan bases

49
00:03:04,511 --> 00:03:06,940
that I just wish,
wish eternal misery on.

50
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:12,070
And that's the Yankees because I have
to the same way they do it with red sox

51
00:03:12,071 --> 00:03:15,640
fans and the Montreal Canadiens. Other
than that, you know, if I, you know,

52
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:18,190
I wouldn't ever wished that,
you know,

53
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,120
a fan base never got to
feel a championship. So
congratulations to you guys.

54
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:25,780
All right. Now, having said that,

55
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,810
um,
I've had the,

56
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:33,830
that Don Henley song in my head this
whole morning just thinking about the game

57
00:03:34,751 --> 00:03:38,590
because there's always that fucking
devastating shock when your team loses.

58
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:44,400
And the song I woke up hearing today for
whatever reason was don Henley's last

59
00:03:44,801 --> 00:03:49,360
worthless evening and I was walking
around the kitchen, I was just singing.

60
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:54,390
That was the worst FARC and d
fence that I've ever seen to,

61
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,210
that was the, you know, it was an exciting
game. But if you really look at it,

62
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:05,440
that was arguably the ugliest
fucking Superbowl I've ever seen.

63
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:10,390
It was like both teams were
in a fucking prevent defense.

64
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:13,990
The entire game that was a
fucking Superbowl people.

65
00:04:13,991 --> 00:04:18,280
There was two punts the
entire game and no sacks,

66
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:21,700
unless you called call 'em
count the Brady fumble,

67
00:04:21,701 --> 00:04:25,360
which I don't know how that works if you
slap the ball out and then you tackle

68
00:04:25,361 --> 00:04:30,190
the quarterback if that's
considered a sac. Um,

69
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,920
I heard them kind of alluding saying
this was the first sack of the game.

70
00:04:32,921 --> 00:04:37,660
I was at a Superbowl party, which I
usually don't do, but I got a kid now. Um,

71
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:39,670
and I went actually, you
know, had a good time.

72
00:04:39,671 --> 00:04:40,690
It's a bunch of kids running around,

73
00:04:40,691 --> 00:04:45,160
throwing balls and all that stuff and
I was being the lunatic sitting in the

74
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:48,810
other room by myself trying to watch
the game or whatever. But, uh, anyways,

75
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,900
you know what's great about having a kid,
uh,

76
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,220
you don't have to watch the halftime show.
Haley,

77
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,030
I want to put her in the
stroller and go for a walk.

78
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,720
So I don't even know
who played the halftime.

79
00:04:58,721 --> 00:05:01,660
I just kept walking by the front door
and I kept hearing music and one of the

80
00:05:01,661 --> 00:05:05,440
music ended. I came back in
and then somebody goes, hey,
great timing, great timing.

81
00:05:05,441 --> 00:05:10,410
It's like, Hey, you know,
I've watched a few of these,
watched a good 40 of them. Um,

82
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:12,303
anyways,

83
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:17,370
I've never seen like the defense
was so fucking bad and that game,

84
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:21,970
it was literally like, how did either
one of these teens even make it here?

85
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:26,950
I don't know if it was still
weird match up or what. I mean,

86
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:30,040
I don't know anything about the fucking
eagles considering I thought that

87
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:31,630
fucking Sproles guy who was still playing,

88
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,180
but I did call it with the running game.

89
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,490
I just didn't know it was that fucking
dude that you got from the dolphins,

90
00:05:36,491 --> 00:05:41,260
whatever. Right. But I knew that that
was going to be a problem. Um, yeah.

91
00:05:41,261 --> 00:05:43,480
I don't know what the fuck
happened to the eagles,

92
00:05:43,481 --> 00:05:45,790
but I will tell you the
New England patriots,

93
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,550
the game this season where I
went like, oh boy, oh Jesus.

94
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:56,620
We went in at this year was when we played
the Pittsburgh Steelers and we went,

95
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:02,410
we went down and we scored.
The fucking game was over.

96
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,660
There wasn't enough time
left even with big Ben.

97
00:06:04,661 --> 00:06:07,750
And then we gave up a 90 yard screen pass.

98
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:14,130
And the only reason why we won that game
was because of that stupid fucking is

99
00:06:14,321 --> 00:06:19,321
it a catch isn't a catch that when he
catches the ball here and he turns and

100
00:06:19,331 --> 00:06:21,010
starts running with the ball,

101
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:25,990
we don't know if he has possession as he
possesses the ball and reaches over the

102
00:06:25,991 --> 00:06:27,770
fucking goal line.
I,

103
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:32,880
the my number one thing I want
them to fix in football is,

104
00:06:34,711 --> 00:06:39,670
is that fucking rule. Um, I don't
remember there really being a huge,

105
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:44,290
is it a catch isn't an a catch controversy
before they fucked with that rule.

106
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:45,670
So every once in a while,
you know,

107
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:50,671
you try to make the game
less controversial and you
do dumb shit like that.

108
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:54,880
Or even the Tuck rule. I mean, that
was fucking stupid. That was a fumble.

109
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:59,170
It's as stupid as fuck.
He tucked it in. I Dunno,

110
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:02,290
but I don't know the rule book the
way they do it. It's fucking dumb.

111
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:04,930
And all you rate a friends
who were jumping up and down
because of patriots fans

112
00:07:04,931 --> 00:07:05,980
said that that was a fumble.

113
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:10,420
Go watch the fucking roughing the passer
call that you guys got back with old

114
00:07:10,421 --> 00:07:13,740
Kenny stable and Ray Hamilton jumping
in the fucking hear that gave you a God

115
00:07:13,741 --> 00:07:14,860
damn Superbowl.
Okay,

116
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:20,190
so why don't you take off your fucking a
rocky horror picture show scary rate of

117
00:07:20,681 --> 00:07:23,440
costume and shove it up
your ass. All right. Sorry.

118
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:27,280
I'm still a little upset that my team
lost tack and fucking Raiders fans who are

119
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:32,260
about to become the most profitable
fucking franchise in the moderate and NFL

120
00:07:32,261 --> 00:07:34,900
era era of second day go to Las Vegas.

121
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,050
They're going to do so well in Las Vegas.

122
00:07:38,051 --> 00:07:42,010
This is my prediction that I'm going to
say the rams who will eventually move to

123
00:07:42,011 --> 00:07:45,580
Reno or Laughlin Nevada or some shit.
Right.

124
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:50,110
So anyways,
getting to the game,

125
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:55,170
that was the ugliest fucking
game collectively of team
defense I've ever seen in

126
00:07:56,141 --> 00:07:59,740
my fucking life. I don't remember
seeing a punter the whole game.

127
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,270
Yeah,

128
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,580
I haven't looked at the stats,
you know, cause my team lost.

129
00:08:03,581 --> 00:08:06,070
So you know you go on
fucking radio silence.

130
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:11,140
I'm not going on social media cause not
one eagle fan talk to any fucking shit.

131
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:14,790
And I already looked at my, my feed
last night so it was like a good day.

132
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,401
All this shit.

133
00:08:15,401 --> 00:08:19,480
It's like where was that before the game
when you're green needs were fucking

134
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,340
shaking.
Um,

135
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,580
I think there was two punts,

136
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:29,200
no sacks other than I guess separating
thing if they count that as a sec.

137
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:31,603
Okay.

138
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:36,540
If you told me before the fucking
game started, I'll just say,

139
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:39,420
cause I don't know what happened.
I'll say the eagles punted once and,

140
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:43,250
and the fucking patriots punted
once you just told me, all right,

141
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:48,000
you're not going to sack nick foals once
and the eagles are only gonna punt once

142
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:53,100
and you'll have one turnover. I'd be like,
oh boy. Oh, this is going to be ugly.

143
00:08:53,101 --> 00:08:56,010
We're going to get the living
shit kicked out of us. And I bet

144
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:59,010
if you told Eagle, I mean, what the for
the fuck ever the eagles difference.

145
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,720
I thought they were going to
kill us. I was like, Jesus,

146
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,590
this fucking team looks
like those giant teams.

147
00:09:06,591 --> 00:09:09,450
So they've got that great front
before they got to fucking run a game.

148
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:12,030
They're going to fucking make Brady move.

149
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:13,630
Okay.

150
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:14,190
And we're going to be,

151
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:16,780
we're going to be frustrated and
punting and all of that shit.

152
00:09:16,781 --> 00:09:20,200
And then they're going to have the running
game chewing up the fucking clock. Um,

153
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,420
it was still a great game.
Uh,

154
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:26,320
and I know there's a bunch of Patriot
fans whining about that trick play. Who,

155
00:09:26,321 --> 00:09:29,220
by the way, Chris Collins worth just
couldn't get over that play going.

156
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:33,490
They kept going back to it. This guy,
I mean I'm quite is icon and clay,

157
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:38,500
so la history. It's like you mean the one
the patriots just ran five minutes ago?

158
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:40,990
Yeah.

159
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:44,680
You see that at least five times a
fucking year in the NFL regular season.

160
00:09:44,681 --> 00:09:48,160
It wasn't like this unique trick play
and if you watch college football,

161
00:09:48,161 --> 00:09:49,870
you see it about 40 times a year.

162
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:54,900
It's just this standard fucking play now
I guess illegal formation as if this,

163
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:01,110
you need to six guys on the line and the
eagles had five and there was one guy,

164
00:10:01,111 --> 00:10:02,340
a cunt hair back,

165
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:06,870
so I dunno if you want to say that's
illegal formation. I'll tell you this,

166
00:10:06,871 --> 00:10:08,790
with the defense played
yesterday and they,

167
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:12,390
if they actually called that the eagles
would have scored on the next fucking

168
00:10:12,391 --> 00:10:16,590
play. All right. That'd be one thing.
If we were actually stopping them,

169
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,580
I would actually look at that and be like,
well wait a minute, blah, blah, blah,

170
00:10:19,581 --> 00:10:22,610
blah, blah. You know, my buddy said
something funny. He goes, you know what,

171
00:10:22,611 --> 00:10:24,990
the Patriot scored on that
and we actually won the game.

172
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:29,310
They would be calling it a formation
gate for the next three fucking years,

173
00:10:29,311 --> 00:10:32,120
which is hilarious. We probably would've
lost a draft pick because of that plate,

174
00:10:32,121 --> 00:10:36,170
but there's no fucking way,
um,

175
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:41,100
on any level I would ever take
that victory away from the eagles.

176
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:45,070
They, they total level, they
won the fucking Cape. All right.

177
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:48,360
And Ah,
this is how bad the difference was.

178
00:10:48,361 --> 00:10:50,880
Even on the last play of the fucking game,

179
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:55,560
they still had to give the eagles fan
base a fucking heart attack when they

180
00:10:55,561 --> 00:10:57,430
batted the ball all around me.
They like,

181
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:00,990
it was like three patriots that had a
shot at the balls as it was like hanging

182
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:05,670
in the air. Um, just a really a weird,

183
00:11:05,671 --> 00:11:09,300
weird fucking game. But,
um, I can't say this,

184
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:11,310
I am really happy for,
uh,

185
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:16,590
for eagles fans and the
city of Philadelphia and I
know that I will always be

186
00:11:16,591 --> 00:11:20,850
sort of connected to that city as if I
fucking hate them. I don't, I never did.

187
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:22,650
It was just,
I had a bad show.

188
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,670
I was in Philly and I went after this
shit that you loved. But I, I really,

189
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:31,170
the only time I ever really hated a
Philadelphia team was when the Celtics and

190
00:11:31,171 --> 00:11:34,140
sixers had that great rivalry. But
other than that, you know what I mean?

191
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,830
We're in the AFC. You're in the
NFC. We were in the Adams Division.

192
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:39,090
You are in the Patrick's division.

193
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,670
I actually used to like
the flyers back in the 80s,

194
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:44,340
because I liked fights and
I remember rooting for them.

195
00:11:44,341 --> 00:11:47,760
I think they played Edmonton,
I forget who they played,

196
00:11:47,761 --> 00:11:49,080
but they were going to lose the game.

197
00:11:49,081 --> 00:11:53,290
And I didn't know where Ron Hextall had
an absolute shit fit and for whatever,

198
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:54,070
I've never seen a goalie

199
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:57,040
do this. Just skated out of the
crease and started fighting.

200
00:11:57,041 --> 00:12:00,040
Somebody just completely spazzed out,

201
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:05,650
can ran out, skated out, I should say. Um,

202
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:08,530
but after a while,
I couldn't become a flyer.

203
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:13,560
I couldn't stay a flyers fan because
they reminded me of how I was living my

204
00:12:13,781 --> 00:12:18,460
life where it's like, well, this worked
fucking 30 years ago. Let me, uh,

205
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:20,620
let me keep trying it every year.
You know,

206
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,100
when they kept trying to beat their way
to the cop cars at one because that one,

207
00:12:24,101 --> 00:12:25,180
I'm a cup at 74,

208
00:12:25,181 --> 00:12:29,830
75 and then they continued to do
it well into the two thousands.

209
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:35,350
Um, so anyways, what else? I
made a couple of notes here.

210
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:41,080
Uh, I think that was
it. I think that was it.

211
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:45,070
Um, anyways, but this one,

212
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,850
it doesn't hurt the way
those giants one's heart. Um,

213
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:54,700
this one is just a, this one
just kind of sucks, but anyways,

214
00:12:54,701 --> 00:12:56,350
congratulations.
That's fucking great.

215
00:12:56,351 --> 00:12:59,980
So now the Philadelphia Eagles and
the last 10 years, the Philadelphia,

216
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:05,010
the city of Philadelphia has won a
world series and they won a Superbowl.

217
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:09,040
So now they need the flyers.
It's 76 is to win,

218
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:14,260
which I don't know how the
fuck that's going to happen.
So, uh, anyway, stay. You Go,

219
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:16,390
there's my Superbowl chatter.
Once again,

220
00:13:16,391 --> 00:13:21,370
congratulations to the eagles fans and uh,
you know,

221
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,960
patriots, feds, he has his, here's the
positive that you can take from it.

222
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:31,240
All right. The team come
100% over achieved this year.

223
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,480
All right.
Not Having an Edelman the whole year,

224
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:39,340
haven't Gronk concussed and Brandon
hooks, cooks, I should say hooks.

225
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:42,730
Brandon cooks essentially
knocking himself out of the game.

226
00:13:42,731 --> 00:13:46,660
I've never seen anybody do something
like that. When he peeled back,

227
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:50,140
I literally yelled,
what the fuck is he doing?

228
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:55,120
I'd never seen a guy peel back with the
ball and be looking the wrong way and

229
00:13:55,121 --> 00:13:56,740
get himself knocked out of the game.

230
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:01,170
They should have been like
Benny Hill music playing.

231
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:04,030
I don't know what the f I think he
was so surprised he was that open.

232
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,040
He didn't know what to do with.
He was like,

233
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:09,440
he had his own public park to himself.
Um,

234
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:16,150
anyways, he, here's, here's your, uh, as
patriots fans, how you can get past this.

235
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:20,170
Um, just be happy. You know, every, every
time the Patriots win the Super Bowl,

236
00:14:20,171 --> 00:14:22,440
you know, when you really
think about it, you don't,

237
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:26,150
have you ever gotten a ring yourself?
You don't get a ring.

238
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,150
All you have to do is now go out and
buy a championship tee shirt and get a

239
00:14:31,151 --> 00:14:34,240
subscription to sports illustrated.
So it's nice, you know,

240
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:39,850
to avoid that expense. Um, anyways,

241
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:44,590
so there you go.
And now the worst feeling ever,

242
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:50,640
almost as bad as you team losing
the fucking super bowl is a,

243
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,610
the football season is officially over.
No College,

244
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:58,960
no pro, no Canadian, no nothing.

245
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:00,853
MMM,

246
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,420
whatever.
You got March madness coming up.

247
00:15:03,421 --> 00:15:06,870
Formula One starts next month or whatever.
But um,

248
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:12,690
anyways, congratulations to the
Patriots on a great season. And, uh,

249
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,260
once again, congratulations to the
DC, you're super bowl champion,

250
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:20,400
Philadelphia fucking eagles, man.
Who would have ever thought, um,

251
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:23,600
now wait a minute, let's go
around the league. So who's left?

252
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,200
We all know the Cleveland browns

253
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:29,190
and they certainly didn't take a
step towards what he won this year,

254
00:15:29,191 --> 00:15:32,490
but you never know enough. Sure.
They got a bunch of draft picks.

255
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:36,090
Let's go run a league. Patriots
obviously have one giant is obviously,

256
00:15:36,091 --> 00:15:39,840
if one jets won Superbowl three eagles,

257
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:44,550
if one Pittsburghers one ravens have one,
Washington is one.

258
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:48,490
The Carolina Panthers,
Owen too.

259
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,310
Uh,

260
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,200
Tennessee titans

261
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,900
lost to the rams and one of the great
super bowls of all time. All right.

262
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:02,560
They never want to see Houston Oilers.
They did want an AFL title,

263
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:03,850
I believe the first year.

264
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,510
Okay.

265
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:09,220
Jacksonville Jaguars never
won. So there's, there's
three teams set up. Never won.

266
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,780
MMM.

267
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:14,850
And the brown sets for.

268
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:16,160
Okay.

269
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,180
Bangles. Never one. That's five
lions. Never one. That's six.

270
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:25,720
Dolphins have one. Tampa
Bay's one. Atlanta never one.
That's seven. I'll shut this.

271
00:16:25,721 --> 00:16:26,570
Whole lot of teams left.

272
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:28,480
Okay.

273
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,320
New Orleans is one. Okay. Right.

274
00:16:32,321 --> 00:16:36,490
Moving on up. And then as
soda never won. Bears have won

275
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:42,960
Kansas City chiefs one. So go for
cowboys. Have one. Houston Texans.

276
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:46,380
If never one.
That's nine Broncos have one.

277
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,710
Arizona cardinals. Never one. That's 10.

278
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:51,040
Okay.

279
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,100
San Diego Challenges.
Never one. Jesus Christ.

280
00:16:54,101 --> 00:16:56,770
This is really saying about how
many dynasties has been in football.

281
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,550
The rams never won.

282
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,740
Fuck yeah.

283
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:08,170
Raiders of one 49 is if
one Seattle have one,

284
00:17:08,171 --> 00:17:11,650
I probably missed a team or two there.
So 12 teams haven't won it.

285
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,090
Okay.

286
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:14,410
20 teams have.

287
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:15,940
Okay,

288
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:18,610
well I guess you know something.
If, when the Patriots,

289
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,790
we say the Steelers have
one six pages of one five,

290
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:23,370
okay.

291
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:28,370
49 is one five and cowboys have
one five that's 21 of the 52 bowls.

292
00:17:28,891 --> 00:17:32,550
Right. They're spread out against
what's just for fucking teams.

293
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,480
Giants got four.
So that's 24.

294
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:37,790
Yeah,

295
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,070
packers have four,
that's 28.

296
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:45,080
So it's one for like six
teams of one 28 of them. Well,

297
00:17:45,081 --> 00:17:46,340
I guess it kind of makes sense then.

298
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:50,640
So I guess since there's really
no shame at this point, you know,

299
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:54,660
having never won a fucking Superbowl and
considering like a lot of those teams I

300
00:17:54,661 --> 00:17:58,470
mentioned, we're expansion teams like
the panthers, Texans and fucking Jaguars.

301
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,860
Um, all right, there you go.

302
00:18:01,861 --> 00:18:05,180
Another goddamn season out the window
and I have to be honest with you. Uh,

303
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:06,910
okay.

304
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:08,530
I am really fearful.

305
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:14,400
You know what Tom Brady going to be
turning 41 here that it might be a long,

306
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:19,060
long time before we ever
get back to another one. Uh,

307
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,020
if we don't get back next year
because, uh, I'll never forget,

308
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,513
you know,

309
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:29,670
everybody talks about Dan Marino who a
on undeservingly gets all this shit for

310
00:18:31,091 --> 00:18:35,200
having never won a Superbowl. I mean,
the game had passed his coach by,

311
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:38,590
he never had a running game. He
never had a defense. He still did.

312
00:18:38,591 --> 00:18:41,890
What he did was he supposed to tackle
people too and come up with the fucking

313
00:18:41,891 --> 00:18:42,724
game plan.

314
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:47,170
The man would literally throw per 6,000
yards of season if the rules of pass

315
00:18:47,171 --> 00:18:49,720
coverage where the way
they, they are. All right.

316
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:55,210
Now that guy went to a super bowl in
his second year, I believe in 1984.

317
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:59,710
Not only did the dolphins never
get back during his career,

318
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:02,980
Dave never been back period since then.

319
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,250
So that was 34 fucking years ago.

320
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:11,310
Dan Marino was 23 years old.
He's now 57.

321
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:12,810
Yeah,

322
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:14,220
that's how fucking nuts this is.

323
00:19:14,221 --> 00:19:18,120
So I'm telling you right now
when Brady and Belichick leave,

324
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:19,893
mmm.

325
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:23,720
You know,
I'm going to be 50 years old.

326
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,100
If we go through what the dolphins
go through, I will be 84 years old.

327
00:19:28,101 --> 00:19:29,480
Still waiting for them to get back.

328
00:19:29,481 --> 00:19:32,080
So I don't take any of this for granted
because there's a lot of patriot.

329
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:35,870
People hate the pages go. I mean, you
guys, you must study big shining anymore.

330
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,540
It's like, no dude, it's
fucking unbelievable.

331
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,930
I'm trying to enjoy every second
of it cause I always think, okay,

332
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:43,820
this is the last time we're getting back.

333
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:44,730
Okay,

334
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:48,090
thank God we want, this is the last
time we getting back off. Fuck, we lost.

335
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:49,330
Okay.

336
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:53,770
This is the last time. Oh, we lost
again. All we won. We won again.

337
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:58,120
Now we've fucking la. Yeah, I
dunno. I Dunno. It's fucking, uh,

338
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,700
you know when for all your Patriot
haters, I'll tell you, I mean, you're,

339
00:20:00,701 --> 00:20:02,470
you're really supple birds.
He said it best. He goes,

340
00:20:02,471 --> 00:20:05,320
it's like you're literally watching
something you'd be probably never going to

341
00:20:05,321 --> 00:20:09,940
fucking see again that level of dominance.
But, um, I do understand it. You know,

342
00:20:09,941 --> 00:20:14,920
if you love you fucking team and all
that shit. But, uh, anyways, I, uh,

343
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,800
we had deaf and I don't know
where we are in the run.

344
00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:19,810
We're definitely in the final 10% of it.

345
00:20:19,811 --> 00:20:22,150
And I don't know if that was
the last time, but we shall see.

346
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:24,880
We shall definitely see. But
you know, here's the thing.

347
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:29,020
I think if they never get back again
in 34 years, so they do. Either way,

348
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:32,950
I'll be sitting there
watching because I have not.

349
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:39,250
Um, okay. What is that?

350
00:20:39,251 --> 00:20:42,760
20 minutes in? All right, let's read
a little bit of fucking advertising.

351
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:47,720
Shao we shall. We are
right. And don't, don't

352
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:51,400
talk about how every man looks
better in a suit. I'll tell ya,

353
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:55,120
I don't think I've ever been. So star
struck is when I see Tom Brady in a suit.

354
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,560
You know what I mean?

355
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:00,760
Hair and just all the perfect places are,

356
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:05,350

custom apparel company.

exact measurements for a great fit. Yeah.

358
00:21:10,371 --> 00:21:12,670
So after getting measured,
stop fucking eating stupid.

359
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,740
I'll try to remember exactly what you ate.

The one thing that can put my smile
on my face after a super bowl.

455
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,220
Bloss my wife and my beautiful daughter.

456
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:31,690
She insisted on coming in here.
Okay, come on in. You know what?

457
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:35,770
I don't know what happened last yesterday
and that Superbowl. I can't explain.

458
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:39,130
They should've been Benny Hill
music playing during that game.

459
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:44,080
Can you give us your breakdown,
honey bunch. What happened?

460
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:47,710
Pushing the microphone away. You don't
even want to talk about you so devastated.

461
00:27:47,711 --> 00:27:52,510
That's cause you're spoiled
because this is, hi. Hi.

462
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,553
Hi.

463
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:58,580
The Patriots won the Super Bowl every
year of your life until this year.

464
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:05,310
That's all right. She's one years old.
They've already been there twice. Oh,

465
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,700
it all she knew was winning.
Sorry.

466
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:11,720
Sorry that you had to learn
this ugly lesson. Oh my God.

467
00:28:11,721 --> 00:28:15,170
If they showed nick foals wife
one more frigging time. I get it.

468
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,790
Is it an unbelievable,
I guess I have to say as a redhead,

469
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:22,700
the white blonde people get treated.
I swear to God, if she was a Brunette,

470
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:27,200
maybe they would have panned passed her
face to some fat eagles fan eight and a

471
00:28:27,201 --> 00:28:30,380
cheese steak.
Are you going to say anything?

472
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,530
He just throwing your hands up.

473
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:36,260
Is it weird that I have headphones
on and a microphone here.

474
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:42,980
He say Mama, nothing. Nothing.

475
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:47,960
Nothing. She's speechless after that loss.
Right? There you go. There's the Mama.

476
00:28:47,961 --> 00:28:52,820
Can you say hi? Can you
say hi buddy? You can wave.

477
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:58,010
Hi. Hey, who played the halftime show
yesterday? Jassen Timberlake. Oh,

478
00:28:58,011 --> 00:29:00,170
it was Justin Timberlake. Oh
Shit. I should have watched that.

479
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:05,660
I was pushing her up and
down the driveway, having a
grand old time. All right.

480
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:06,523
Hi.

481
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:07,780
Okay.

482
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,860
All right, let's stop. Stop
trying to show off here. Let me,

483
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:13,490
let me finish my podcast here.
All right. Come on. Say Bye. Bye.

484
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,860
David showed a quarterback's wife
that much sense. Um, Kurt Warner's,

485
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:21,080
you know,
although she was a Brunette,

486
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:25,780
so there goes that theory. No, right.

487
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:31,890
They're stupid palm palm hat on. You're
in an indoor stadium. All right, Bill,

488
00:29:31,891 --> 00:29:35,750
don't be a bitter Douche. All right, I
won't. Congratulations to nick foals wife.

489
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:40,910
Um, I was hoping that the Patriots
were in to kick the shit out of the,

490
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,070
just so I could have seen

491
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:43,640
this sports headline, you know, and if,

492
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:47,080
if nick falls through like
three interceptions, they
would've said Nick folded,

493
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:53,350
but it didn't happen. Um,
all right, Formula One,

494
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:56,020
let's get to the questions here to see.
Oh No,

495
00:29:56,021 --> 00:29:59,410
am I going to tell you about
my show in Reno? So, uh,

496
00:29:59,411 --> 00:30:01,570
I want to thank everybody
that came out in Reno,

497
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:06,400
even the dose that tried to interrupt
my show and have a youtube moment. Um,

498
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:10,570
I, I, I fucking love that city,
man. I had such a great time.

499
00:30:10,571 --> 00:30:12,760
I went up there and I worked
with my buddy Rick Dalea,

500
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:16,520
who we started out together,
um,

501
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:21,370
way back in Boston in 1992. I think
he may be started like a month before.

502
00:30:21,371 --> 00:30:23,080
We were trying to figure
out who started before,

503
00:30:23,081 --> 00:30:27,920
but I always remembered seeing him and um,
you know,

504
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:30,490
seeing a friend, you know,
Jesus Christ and we were, were,

505
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,680
I've known him for 26 years.

506
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:38,140
I've actually known him longer than the
age we were at when we met each other.

507
00:30:38,141 --> 00:30:38,930
So it was,
you know,

508
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:41,950
just all the stories were coming
out and when he brought me up,

509
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:44,980
he actually made a reference to
this fucking hell Gig that we did.

510
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:49,540
Nick's comedy stop where I started.
Um,

511
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:56,050
they, I remember that was
such a big deal to work at.

512
00:30:56,051 --> 00:30:59,440
That comedy club was just a legendary
place. It was the house that, you know,

513
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:04,441
Steve Sweeney and Don Galvin and all
those guys built and we were both,

514
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:08,810
you know, no name comics,
just pass being open.

515
00:31:08,811 --> 00:31:12,520
Micros had started hosting in like,
you know,

516
00:31:12,521 --> 00:31:15,970
outside rooms like Dick Doroty
rooms and all of that. And um,

517
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,670
Rita from,

518
00:31:18,671 --> 00:31:23,671
Nick's called us up to do a private gig
for Nick's comedy stop and I couldn't

519
00:31:24,701 --> 00:31:28,840
believe it. I was like, oh my God,
things are finally starting to happen.

520
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:33,010
And you know, mean to Leah found out, you
know, we were working with each other,

521
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:37,120
which should've been a red flag
right there going like you,

522
00:31:37,121 --> 00:31:41,500
they called you to, oh my God,
they believe in us. Right.

523
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:46,020
That should have been a fucking red flag
right there because both of us should

524
00:31:46,021 --> 00:31:48,880
have been opening for somebody who
knew what the fuck they were doing.

525
00:31:48,881 --> 00:31:51,640
But instead we show up.

526
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:54,880
It was to fishermen's faced
in the north end of Boston,

527
00:31:54,881 --> 00:31:57,640
which is the Italian section,
or at least it was back in the day.

528
00:31:58,030 --> 00:32:01,450
I don't know what, what, what goes
on there now. Everything, the prices,

529
00:32:01,451 --> 00:32:06,070
they just driven every, every, any, any
sort of like culture has been removed,

530
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:09,170
which is why I like
going to be so-called B,

531
00:32:09,171 --> 00:32:13,870
c and d level cities because there's
still that unique vibe there.

532
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:18,640
Um, you'll go there and see stuff that
you don't see in every other fucking city.

533
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:23,380
Um, you know, the same 10 fucking
corporate chains in whatever, um,

534
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,670
everybody walking around with their
Instagram look on their face, you know?

535
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:32,140
Um, so when he was, we show
up to this Gig, it's outside,

536
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:36,880
literally in the fucking
streets. They tell his story
last week, I can't remember.

537
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:43,550
And it was like fucking band
on stage when no hits your eye,

538
00:32:43,621 --> 00:32:45,670
like a big pizza pie.

539
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:51,180
All the Italians is sitting there singing
and you're really just see the field

540
00:32:51,181 --> 00:32:54,810
is great sense of family,
tradition and culture.

541
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,910
And now you've got these two pasty faced,

542
00:32:56,911 --> 00:32:58,980
you know at least Rick was half Italian,
you know,

543
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:03,630
I'm fucking German Irish just standing
there with my fucking fire engine red

544
00:33:03,631 --> 00:33:06,450
hair.
So deleah goes on,

545
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:10,540
nobody has any idea what's like
this fucking guy I got now.

546
00:33:10,541 --> 00:33:13,570
They got a little comedy
and people like what the,

547
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,840
what the fuck is this guy talking about?
And then delete it goes on stage

548
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:22,970
trying to smile through probably
the biggest panic of his life.

549
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:26,180
And I remember wanting to laugh at him,

550
00:33:26,181 --> 00:33:28,490
but I couldn't because I
knew I had to go on next.

551
00:33:28,491 --> 00:33:30,860
So whatever he was feeling
I was about to feel.

552
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:36,010
But at least for me it was going to be
worse cause we leased before he went on

553
00:33:36,421 --> 00:33:39,390
stage, he had fucking hope. Like,
well maybe this will be good.

554
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:41,670
But when I saw reco on stage,

555
00:33:41,671 --> 00:33:44,250
I had confirmation that this
was not going to be good.

556
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:49,560
I just remember him just fucking
interrupting this great fucking party,

557
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,650
which is so many of the
early standup gigs, you know,

558
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,740
just interrupting something that everyone
was totally enjoying and they really

559
00:33:55,741 --> 00:33:56,311
don't need you.

560
00:33:56,311 --> 00:33:58,860
And then they don't know that you're
coming up there and then you go up there

561
00:33:58,861 --> 00:34:00,270
and they're like,
what the fuck is this?

562
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:01,973
MMM.

563
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:02,970
Well,

564
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:06,590
I remember it was when I went on stage
bombing and just looking up and seeing

565
00:34:06,591 --> 00:34:08,930
all these old Italian ladies
like hanging out the window,

566
00:34:08,931 --> 00:34:12,470
just looking down at us. Like,
like, what, what the fuck is this?

567
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:20,210
It just afterwards, I forget,
we probably walked out of there.

568
00:34:20,211 --> 00:34:23,900
There's no subway stop or
he walked over to our cars.

569
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:25,883
MMM.

570
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:30,010
I don't even remember what, anyway, it
was great to work with him. But, um,

571
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:35,900
I was in the middle of my set having a
great time and I do this bit where I make

572
00:34:35,901 --> 00:34:39,290
fun of the troops a little bit, you know
what I mean? And it's not even, you know,

573
00:34:39,291 --> 00:34:40,730
it's not even fucking remotely,

574
00:34:40,731 --> 00:34:43,640
it's like a fucking hilarious bit that
the first time I did it, I did it.

575
00:34:43,641 --> 00:34:47,090
At a VFW to make sure that, you
know, the way I was doing it,

576
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,030
I did it in front of the troops.
They were all fucking dying laughing.

577
00:34:50,031 --> 00:34:52,790
I mean those guys say that lost their
legs over there and shit and they was

578
00:34:52,791 --> 00:34:56,600
still laughing. They love the
fucking bit. So I do the bit there,

579
00:34:57,410 --> 00:34:57,831
you know,

580
00:34:57,831 --> 00:35:01,460
and I've moved on from the bid and at
this point I'm making fun of Isis and all

581
00:35:01,461 --> 00:35:05,750
of a sudden this, this guy walks all
the way up from the back of the room.

582
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:06,710
Unfortunately it,

583
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:10,220
the chairs were like where he couldn't
get all the way up to the front.

584
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,890
He starts yelling at me,
pointing at the stage,

585
00:35:12,891 --> 00:35:17,800
go show some fucking respect
what he started seeing.

586
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:21,410
I'm trying to have his fucking
youtube moment, you know what I mean?

587
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,450
And I was like,
what?

588
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:28,450
Show some respect for what he's still in
one of those fucking things like that.

589
00:35:29,901 --> 00:35:30,020
Yeah.

590
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:34,520
I love other military is just so fucking
off limits now who supports the troops

591
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:38,760
or you just have to constantly be blowing
the fucking military that she can't

592
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:42,630
even make fun of somebody in the Navy
who all he does is swab the fucking decks

593
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:46,170
and it's getting a standing ovation
walking through the fucking airport.

594
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:49,590
I've done that fucking pit.
It's in front of so many troops.

595
00:35:49,591 --> 00:35:50,720
They've all funded funding this fucker.

596
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:56,070
You know this fat fuck.
Oh my God,

597
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:58,710
I went off on that guy show.

598
00:35:58,711 --> 00:36:01,050
So why don't you show some fucking
respect and lose some weight?

599
00:36:01,051 --> 00:36:05,640
You fat cunt for your fellow American
for every time you get the middle seat on

600
00:36:05,641 --> 00:36:09,020
a flight and you fat fucking
mantat spill into the other.

601
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:10,770
I'm so fucking sick.

602
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:16,700
I'm so fucking sick of everybody being
so God damn fucking offended at comedy

603
00:36:18,121 --> 00:36:21,360
shows and just making the
whole moment about themselves.

604
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:26,580
You fucking mouth breathing chimp,
Jesus fucking Christ.

605
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:30,900
If you can't fucking see through
the fucking whatever that fucking

606
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:35,280
expressionists see the forest through
the fucking trees with all of this shit.

607
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:36,750
I just can't fucking help you.

608
00:36:36,751 --> 00:36:41,250
And considering all the shit that
I had said up until that point,

609
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:46,050
I didn't show any remote respect
for anything. Every fucking subject.

610
00:36:46,051 --> 00:36:47,160
That's what kills me.

611
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:52,170
I blamed women for sexual harassment.

612
00:36:52,171 --> 00:36:55,830
That's how I started my fucking show.
Where it was the risk,

613
00:36:55,890 --> 00:37:00,540
where we're the fuck was he
during that one fat fucking cunt?

614
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,880
Oh my God.
I was so fucking mad at that guy.

615
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:06,870
I hated that security escorted him out.

616
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,510
I appreciated that they did that
thinking that I want it to it.

617
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:12,960
I wanted to talk to that guy for
the rest of the fucking show.

618
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:16,800
Walks all the fuck way up.
You know,

619
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:20,910
he was waiting for his Oprah round of
applause when I told him to go fuck

620
00:37:20,911 --> 00:37:24,030
himself. Everybody left. I
can't believe that. You know,

621
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,260
that's the classic thing,

622
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:30,870
like a comedy show that usually
ends up on the fucking Internet. Um,

623
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:35,970
you know what I mean?
That's self righteous fucking Douche bag.

624
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:37,261
You know what I mean?

625
00:37:37,261 --> 00:37:42,261
Where everything else that I sent up to
that point was so fucking ridiculous and

626
00:37:42,751 --> 00:37:46,590
absurd. And then that's the
one that you're going to
take fucking seriously. Like,

627
00:37:46,591 --> 00:37:50,920
what kind of a fucking moron.
That's what I'm saying is his case like,

628
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:54,750
did you really think I'm anti
my own country? You dumb fuck.

629
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:58,860
And when you guys come out to my
show, when you see the bit, okay,

630
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:02,820
it's so fucking pedestrian.
It's ridiculous.

631
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:08,340
And I want to, even though when
I did the fucking bit at the Vfw,

632
00:38:08,341 --> 00:38:10,920
the troops came up to me and said,
can't we say that to each other?

633
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:16,350
But this fucking guy had to fucking, you
know, take his hair out of his pony tail,

634
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:21,610
Tassel it around and come. This tab is
big fucking head, Roland moment. Ah,

635
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:24,420
fucking kill yourself.
I hope you fucking have a heart attack.

636
00:38:24,421 --> 00:38:29,280
If fat fucking cunt. You know what
it was was if he didn't like the bit,

637
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:32,580
then heckle me. The fact that he came
up there and he's like pointing at me,

638
00:38:32,581 --> 00:38:36,490
yelling at me like he's like,
I'm his kidneys, my fucking dad.

639
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:44,460
Anyways. Anyways, let me, let me
just fucking that, other than that,

640
00:38:44,461 --> 00:38:46,580
the Gig and Reno was fucking awesome.
Um,

641
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,560
and I got to be telling you that that
was actually more upsetting to me than

642
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,290
watching my team fucking Lusa soup.

643
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:54,443
Both.

644
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,420
Um, all right. Anyways,

645
00:38:57,930 --> 00:39:02,070
let's get into the questions here for
this week to Formula One. Oh, by the way,

646
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:07,020
or Billy's getting in. It's continuing
with his getting in fucking great shape,

647
00:39:07,021 --> 00:39:11,820
man. Um, I had made it, my goal is,

648
00:39:11,821 --> 00:39:14,580
you know, turning 50 and Jude, you know,

649
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,910
two years of doing stand up comedy
and trying to get a positive out of a

650
00:39:17,911 --> 00:39:20,820
negative five people showed up.
What do I do here?

651
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,570
Do I give in to the fact that this five
people, oh, do I make those five people,

652
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:28,320
which they brought another 50. You know
what I mean? You get when you fucking,

653
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:31,170
I dunno,
when you're in this fucking business,

654
00:39:31,171 --> 00:39:33,090
the greatest thing about this business,

655
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:35,100
unless you knew somebody
when you got into it,

656
00:39:35,101 --> 00:39:38,850
most people get into it and they don't
know anybody and they have no idea what

657
00:39:38,851 --> 00:39:43,020
to do. Um, and they're standing out
in the street in broad daylight,

658
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:48,000
in the Italian section of
Boston eating your Red Dick.

659
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:53,020
I mean, if you, if you don't
figure out a positive mindset, uh,

660
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,930
you're really not going to,
you're not going to fucking,

661
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,290
you're not going to survive.
So I'm turning 50, which, uh,

662
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:00,000
I used to think was
going to be devastating.

663
00:40:00,001 --> 00:40:05,001
I'm actually really excited to try to get
myself in the best shape I've been in,

664
00:40:05,431 --> 00:40:08,880
in Bob about 20 years. So, um,

665
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:11,340
I'm trying to get down to my,
uh,

666
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:15,330
basically the weight I was at when a,

667
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:17,160
in the shape I was in when I started.

668
00:40:17,161 --> 00:40:20,130
Now I'm obviously going to fall
short because no matter what I do,

669
00:40:20,131 --> 00:40:24,570
I'm still fucking about 30 years older.
But, uh, that's not what it's about.

670
00:40:24,571 --> 00:40:28,230
It's about going for it. And
I'll still, you know, so anyways,

671
00:40:28,231 --> 00:40:31,290
I have a weight that I want to
get into my fucking shoulder.

672
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,550
The rotator cuff feels great.
Um,

673
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:40,580
and I finally have been able to get a
regimen between all the information that

674
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:45,300
I've gotten over the last year.
Um,

675
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:48,830
and I've put together a
program that that is, is,

676
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:51,960
is really fucking working for me.
And I have to tell you,

677
00:40:51,961 --> 00:40:53,040
you know what I did the other day,

678
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,700
other than taking my beautiful
daughter to the park on the swing,

679
00:40:56,701 --> 00:40:58,230
which I think I'm going to do again today,

680
00:40:58,231 --> 00:41:03,150
it's my favorite thing ever is
she was on the swing and um,

681
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:07,290
I was able, you know, once, once
they got to swing going, cause I'm,

682
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:10,410
I could finally lift my
right arm over my head.

683
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:15,000
I have been able to take my
shirt off, um, with both.

684
00:41:15,001 --> 00:41:18,690
I've had to take it out of my left hand.
I mean it'll take my shirt off with,

685
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:21,210
with both hands in like
over a year and a half,

686
00:41:21,211 --> 00:41:24,210
which is really fucked up my
closing bit. Everybody, you know,

687
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:27,810
cause I really tried to get
sexy in the end, you know, um,

688
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:32,730
I was actually able to reach up and
hold onto like the bar above the,

689
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:37,550
and I made sure I didn't put any
weight on the arm all the way.

690
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:41,540
It was obviously my feet were still on
the ground and I just gave it a little

691
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:45,560
bit of a fucking stretch. And it was
just this tightness but not pain.

692
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:50,060
Cause what happens, I found anybody
else going through this shit is,

693
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:54,680
is when you have an injury like that,
you get into this PR protective,

694
00:41:54,681 --> 00:41:57,980
like, um, the way you hold yourself.

695
00:41:58,010 --> 00:42:00,290
And it's fucking crazy man.

696
00:42:00,291 --> 00:42:05,150
Like having not put my hand
above my head for over a year,

697
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:10,020
like I can't physically do it anymore
because those tendons don't get stretched

698
00:42:10,021 --> 00:42:13,490
and all this fucking Shit just, I dunno,
grows over it or whatever. They just,

699
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:16,400
it's weird. It feels, it
doesn't feel like pain.

700
00:42:16,401 --> 00:42:19,070
It's like there's a doorstop
and I just see, or a governor,

701
00:42:19,071 --> 00:42:22,310
I just can't go any further. So, um,

702
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:27,730
after doing all these other exercises,
I end with that and it feels tremendous.

703
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,191
It was funny,

704
00:42:28,191 --> 00:42:30,740
I was doing that while watching the
Superbowl and one of these others,

705
00:42:30,741 --> 00:42:33,590
patriots fans is laughing at
me like, dude, you're really
getting into this game.

706
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:38,360
And I was like, no, no, sorry man. I'm
just fucking working out my, uh, shoulder.

707
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:44,080
Um, so anyways, uh, I hope
that helps anybody out that,

708
00:42:44,081 --> 00:42:47,780
that has set that, that issue. So I
will actually be able to work out.

709
00:42:47,781 --> 00:42:51,650
But the great thing is I've discovered
bands working out with bands,

710
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:56,720
um, you know, in a door jam and all that,

711
00:42:56,721 --> 00:42:57,980
which is really going
to help me on the road.

712
00:42:57,981 --> 00:43:00,500
And I think I'm done with the
weightlifting for a long time.

713
00:43:00,501 --> 00:43:04,010
That's kind of what got me into this
year's of weightlifting and not doing

714
00:43:04,011 --> 00:43:05,480
enough back exercises.

715
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:09,650
And the front part of my body was way
stronger than the back and it pulled my

716
00:43:09,651 --> 00:43:13,730
shoulders forward and one of them
came up and then I, you know,

717
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:17,020
was bench pressing and just the bones,
I don't know that,

718
00:43:17,021 --> 00:43:22,021
that the rotator cuff tendon just rubbed
on it and got inflamed and then I was

719
00:43:22,881 --> 00:43:26,870
just fucked. And it's really
something that if I, if I,

720
00:43:26,871 --> 00:43:29,990
if it ever happens again, I'll be able
to get out of it and like, you know,

721
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:33,230
six to eight weeks by just didn't
know what to do. I thought, oh,

722
00:43:33,231 --> 00:43:37,550
this will work itself out. And then
they just became all fucking glued up.

723
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:39,620
So anyways.
Um,

724
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:43,070
and have you ever gone through anything
just remotely physical like that to

725
00:43:43,071 --> 00:43:47,000
finally just be able to fucking take
your shirt off or brush your teeth?

726
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:48,430
You know what I mean?

727
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:50,870
I'll put the shaving cream on my
head when I go to shave my head.

728
00:43:50,871 --> 00:43:54,930
I always had to put it in
the left hand, you know? Uh,

729
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:02,160
I'm fucking mess. All right, here we go.
Formula One, everybody a, they there.

730
00:44:02,161 --> 00:44:04,130
Billy the red face cut.

731
00:44:05,450 --> 00:44:10,280
I've been a longtime listener for about
10 years now and the podcast has always

732
00:44:10,281 --> 00:44:13,610
been a great break from the
drudgery of everyday life,

733
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:18,230
especially back in my university, the
university days. Okay. I'm done blowing,

734
00:44:18,231 --> 00:44:20,780
you know. Anyways, my grandfather,

735
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:25,310
father and I are all car lovers.
That's great.

736
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:30,400
I remember falling Formula One closely
as a kid when shock villa new and Michael

737
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:32,453
Schumacher back in

738
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,170
1997.

739
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:37,770
I'm so pissed I missed that
because everybody tells me
I miss the great days of

740
00:44:37,771 --> 00:44:39,060
Formula One.
Uh,

741
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:42,150
listening to you get into Formula One
had me thinking of getting back into it

742
00:44:42,151 --> 00:44:43,830
myself.
With that in mind.

743
00:44:43,831 --> 00:44:48,480
I decided to buy myself an early birthday
present and bought tickets for the

744
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,780
Spanish Grand Prix in Barcelona for
this upcoming season for my old man.

745
00:44:51,781 --> 00:44:55,680
And I do, that's the shit I'm
trying to go to two races a year,

746
00:44:55,681 --> 00:44:58,530
so I'm trying to figure
out what I'm going to do.

747
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:03,560
It's either going to be Mexico City in
Brazil or if I do some tour dates over in

748
00:45:04,051 --> 00:45:07,850
Europe, I'll just book end
them with the race. Uh,

749
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:13,560
we shall see. Obviously Mexico
City is deceivingly far away from,

750
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:14,460
uh,
la.

751
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:19,320
Like I always picture that it's just
south of Los Angeles cause you know,

752
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:23,010
you just go south and you're in
fucking Tiawana. Let me look that up.

753
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:26,040
Where the fuck is it? Ah, you know
what? I got ahold of Microphonia can I,

754
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:29,580
can I do this? Do I have this ability? Uh,

755
00:45:29,581 --> 00:45:32,760
here we go north,

756
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:35,750
uh,
Merrick,

757
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:41,210
I see a map.

758
00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:47,840
Here we go. Come on. Come on.

759
00:45:47,841 --> 00:45:51,740
Slow Internet. All right, clicking on it.

760
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:53,271
Oh yeah,

761
00:45:53,271 --> 00:45:57,320
it's like south of like fucking Houston
or New Mexico or something like that,

762
00:45:57,321 --> 00:45:58,154
right?

763
00:45:59,000 --> 00:45:59,833
Yeah.

764
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:04,020
All right. Where do we go? There's
Australia with the fuck am I all right?

765
00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:08,370
Zooming in. I really
should've hit pause. Oh yeah.

766
00:46:08,371 --> 00:46:11,040
Mexico City is like south of San Antonio,

767
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:14,490
so it's like flying all
the way to San Antonio.

768
00:46:14,491 --> 00:46:17,640
It's like basically flying all the way
across and then all the way south again

769
00:46:17,641 --> 00:46:20,240
for almost the same distance is probably,
yeah,

770
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,570
the equivalent of flying to like Tampa
or something like that. But then Brazil,

771
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:28,980
if I go to Brazil,
I mean that's all the way you always,

772
00:46:28,981 --> 00:46:31,470
I used to think of when New York,
when my buddies just to go to Brazil,

773
00:46:31,471 --> 00:46:36,000
that they were flying due south and the
due south actually would get you into

774
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:40,740
like Peru or the western
side of South America. Um,

775
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:44,730
I would love to go down there too.
Um,

776
00:46:47,990 --> 00:46:48,920
yeah,
maybe I'll do that.

777
00:46:48,921 --> 00:46:51,380
And then how that would actually be done
with all the races on this side of the

778
00:46:51,381 --> 00:46:55,570
world. Uh, who knows? That's such
a cool thing that you're doing,

779
00:46:55,610 --> 00:47:00,290
doing that with your dad though.
Anyways, plowing ahead. Um,

780
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:05,810
I know you liked the Air India team. I
also liked the uh, Williams Martini team.

781
00:47:05,811 --> 00:47:09,230
I just like to colors and I don't want
to pick a perennial powerhouse like

782
00:47:09,231 --> 00:47:11,270
Mercedes or Ferrari.
So my question is,

783
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:16,130
which team race or did you enjoy watching
most by father and I are going to pick

784
00:47:16,131 --> 00:47:20,780
a team to root for during the upcoming
season to make our father son weekend a

785
00:47:20,781 --> 00:47:25,280
little more fun. Thanks.
And Go fuck yourself. Um,

786
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:26,900
okay.

787
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:31,670
Who did I like? I actually, Daniel
Ricardo is probably, you know,

788
00:47:32,270 --> 00:47:37,270
the closest to a Lewis Hamilton and
I would also say I really liked,

789
00:47:37,911 --> 00:47:40,220
uh, uh, cheese.

790
00:47:40,221 --> 00:47:44,150
I'm so new to the sport and I haven't
thought of them that did that guy. Uh, oh,

791
00:47:44,151 --> 00:47:48,440
I know in, in his teammate there,
his teammate was a fucking maniac.

792
00:47:48,441 --> 00:47:51,250
Hold on a second. I've got to make
sure nobody switched on a team.

793
00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:52,430
Let's say red bull.

794
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:54,560
Okay.

795
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:59,010
Racing team, that kid who
was like 20 years old, uh,

796
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:02,880
drivers, here we go and kick my
seat. She should be switched teams.

797
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:08,820
Max Verstappen was really fun to watch.
Um,

798
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:12,390
I would say out of the youngest of the
young drivers, he's probably the best.

799
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:16,470
Um,
I don't know if he's still on the team.

800
00:48:16,471 --> 00:48:21,471
These guys seem to jump around like free
agents and then it's all about getting

801
00:48:22,231 --> 00:48:24,900
on the Ferrari and Mercedes team,
which you know,

802
00:48:24,901 --> 00:48:27,180
two seasons in is getting a little boring.

803
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:31,170
So I would like to see
somebody else a win, you know,

804
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:36,780
so, uh, I max for step and I guess
that's, that's what I would say.

805
00:48:36,810 --> 00:48:40,620
I would say that and I'm, I'm,
that's such a great thing to do.

806
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:44,700
I'd never been to Spain. That's
amazing. I am going to be doing a Gig,

807
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,150
I believe to celebrate my 50th birthday.

808
00:48:48,510 --> 00:48:53,340
I believe it's coming together over
in Europe. Uh, I'm going to go,

809
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:58,560
I think I might be doing a gig
somewhere in England and then,

810
00:48:58,561 --> 00:49:00,030
uh,
um,

811
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:02,610
be with my lovely wife and beautiful
daughter and maybe we were going to go to

812
00:49:02,611 --> 00:49:06,460
France again. I'll try to polish
up and some of my French, but I'm,

813
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,880
if there's any races over there,
you know what, you've inspired me.

814
00:49:08,881 --> 00:49:12,050
I want to talk to my, the guy who books
me today and I'll be like, we got,

815
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:16,320
we got to figure out, you know what
Formula One race is going on over there.

816
00:49:16,321 --> 00:49:20,310
Cause I got add that 50th birthday and
go to a formula one race over in Europe.

817
00:49:20,311 --> 00:49:24,180
Man, that would be sick. All
right. More Formula One shit.

818
00:49:24,181 --> 00:49:25,860
Formula One grid girls.

819
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:31,230
Hey Billion Wallace and big
fan from Glasgow, Scotland,

820
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:36,210
uh, Formula One just announced
that they're getting rid
of the grid girls because

821
00:49:36,211 --> 00:49:40,920
they feel this custom does not
resonate with our brand values.

822
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:46,530
And clearly is it odd with the
modern day social societal norms?

823
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:53,240
Same thing has happened with the darts
and it's looking likely for boxing and

824
00:49:55,321 --> 00:49:59,780
UFC in the future. Are
these probably, Ugh, Ugh,

825
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:03,810
these probably ugly feminists
doing nice looking girls

826
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:08,760
out of a job or are they doing
the right thing? All right.

827
00:50:08,761 --> 00:50:10,530
I don't know what the fuck I kind
of know what you're trying to say.

828
00:50:10,531 --> 00:50:14,140
What are your thoughts? Cheers and
go fuck yourself. You can't, um,

829
00:50:15,810 --> 00:50:20,220
yeah, that's just all,
you know, lip service,

830
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:23,730
no pun intended. It's just
bullshit. You know what I mean?

831
00:50:24,270 --> 00:50:28,820
And you know,
I think it's all bullshit.

832
00:50:28,850 --> 00:50:33,170
Here's the deal to say, this customer
does not resonate as to say it's clearly,

833
00:50:33,171 --> 00:50:37,670
is it odd with modern day social
norms? It isn't. It's a it.

834
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:42,680
It's 100% at odds with
with the public horse shit,

835
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:49,150
political correctness,
which all political correctness really is,

836
00:50:49,810 --> 00:50:54,050
is being phony.
You know what I mean?

837
00:50:55,070 --> 00:50:57,980
It's just it just denying
what you're really feeling,

838
00:50:57,981 --> 00:51:02,120
denying what you really want
to say, denying what you're
really fucking thinking.

839
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:05,690
That's why comedians seems
so fucking outrageous.

840
00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:06,700
Yeah.

841
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:07,310
They always say,
Oh,

842
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:10,420
you're saying the things that
people take but afraid to say it.

843
00:51:10,421 --> 00:51:12,460
They're not afraid to say it.
They say it in their cars.

844
00:51:12,461 --> 00:51:15,310
They say what their friends, they
say it at home. You know I'm not,

845
00:51:15,311 --> 00:51:17,670
I'm not talking about being
a racist fucking moron.

846
00:51:18,930 --> 00:51:19,763
All right.

847
00:51:21,610 --> 00:51:26,610
They're basically trying to say that
men do not enjoy looking at beautiful

848
00:51:27,461 --> 00:51:28,294
women.

849
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:28,810
Okay.

850
00:51:28,810 --> 00:51:33,580
This is against the societal norm that
people do not gravitate towards beauty,

851
00:51:33,581 --> 00:51:37,270
both male and female. Like,
if you're a good looking guy,

852
00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:40,390
you're not going to have your pick
of the litter when it comes to women.

853
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:41,910
Okay.

854
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:44,520
And vice versa.
Like if you're a beautiful woman that's,

855
00:51:44,521 --> 00:51:45,970
you're not going to have to fucking,

856
00:51:46,890 --> 00:51:51,030
you know what I mean? The, I mean, you
could look at it and like a negative way.

857
00:51:51,031 --> 00:51:54,000
I always thought that because
it was outside of this country,

858
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:57,630
I always thought that they had a better
way of presenting beautiful women.

859
00:51:57,631 --> 00:52:00,330
That it wasn't just like that
Hooters vibe that we have here.

860
00:52:00,331 --> 00:52:04,140
Like does it look to just stick my
dick between those knockers, you know,

861
00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:08,780
the ugly way that we fucking do
everything over here. You know? Um,

862
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:10,921
I just,

863
00:52:10,921 --> 00:52:15,921
I think what that is is they probably
got enough crap from these women's groups

864
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:20,730
and they just don't need
the headache. So, um,

865
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:26,130
and I also feel that a lot of, you
know, when they say the, you know,

866
00:52:26,131 --> 00:52:28,710
you're exploiting women and
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

867
00:52:29,130 --> 00:52:31,890
I think there's a lot of truth in that.
I don't think it's,

868
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:35,190
it's that way with this. I
think that's, that's, you know,

869
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:40,170
what are they doing? What exactly are
they doing? Are they fucking, you know,

870
00:52:40,171 --> 00:52:41,600
twerking and all that shit.

871
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:44,730
That's just a beautiful woman walking
around with a ring card. That's it.

872
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:50,170
You know, getting attention in
a very safe fucking way. Me,

873
00:52:50,190 --> 00:52:54,630
what is the fucking problem? You
know? And I do know that, you know,

874
00:52:54,631 --> 00:52:59,631
the way a guys can handle a good looking
guy who's fucking Jack down at the end

875
00:53:00,751 --> 00:53:04,860
of the bar, you know, a better
looking guy. We've booked it.

876
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:08,070
You pluck a boot know to go fight him.
You know,

877
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:11,820
women do the same thing with the better
looking woman that comes walking into

878
00:53:11,821 --> 00:53:14,670
the bar. They fucking hate
him. That's, that's it.

879
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:18,750
So I think it's pretty fucking childish.
However,

880
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:22,530
Formula One is on ESPN and you know,

881
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:28,020
ESPN used to be, but now they kind of ruin
everything. So I'm going to blame them.

882
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:32,910
They are, they are obviously
with too fucking stupid to keep.

883
00:53:32,911 --> 00:53:37,650
Well Buxton, who was, was
phenomenal at his job. Um,

884
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,000
I dunno. So yeah, I think that's all
the whole thing is his fucking dumb.

885
00:53:43,001 --> 00:53:44,730
And eventually there's
going to be a backlash.

886
00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:49,440
God forbid there's a beautiful
woman walking around on
stage God for fucking bid

887
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:52,710
and guys are like excited by it,
like you know,

888
00:53:52,790 --> 00:53:56,220
in fucking whistle in a little bit.
Who gives a fuck it? Who Cares?

889
00:53:57,390 --> 00:53:58,223
You know what I mean?

890
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:04,080
This is my problem with feminism is that
all the corrections are made for them,

891
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:08,880
which is really kind of putting it out
there as if that women don't need to

892
00:54:08,881 --> 00:54:13,560
adjust their fucking behavior in any
ways when it comes to men, you know,

893
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:18,720
and, and feminists get to speak
in these unbelievable like broad,

894
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:23,430
no pun intended, blanket fucking
statements, but guys cannot.

895
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:28,320
You know what I mean? I'll speak in
some blanket fucking terms for men. Hey,

896
00:54:28,350 --> 00:54:31,470
how much you earn your own fucking money.
How about you buy around?

897
00:54:31,471 --> 00:54:34,620
Every once in a while I'll Bowman,
you'd go through a fucking divorce.

898
00:54:34,621 --> 00:54:37,980
She tried to do something fair and try
and instead of trying to take every

899
00:54:37,981 --> 00:54:41,400
fucking last dime you possibly can,

900
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:45,840
you're greedy cunts are right.
We're moving on to the next one now.

901
00:54:45,841 --> 00:54:47,310
They don't need to adjust that at all.

902
00:54:48,090 --> 00:54:50,820
They don't need to adjust any of
their fucking behavior whatsoever.

903
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:55,170
They don't do anything wrong whatsoever.
I tell you right now,

904
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:59,700
if women died that much sooner than men,

905
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,350
you don't think that
there would be a study.

906
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:03,630
You don't think that there
would be a fucking ribbon.

907
00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:07,830
You don't think some way that they would
blame men on some level that women die

908
00:55:07,831 --> 00:55:12,600
that much earlier than, than, than men.
If it was that fucking way, I dunno.

909
00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:14,190
I think that that's why guys are so funny.

910
00:55:14,191 --> 00:55:16,680
It's because nobody gives a shit about us.
They really don't.

911
00:55:16,710 --> 00:55:20,220
You know what I mean? They didn't, they
just dump anything that happens to a guy.

912
00:55:20,221 --> 00:55:24,720
He's a dude. Yeah. About Solid Zola.
Hate to bear such to be him. Right.

913
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:28,470
That's it. That's the level of support
we have for one another. Um, all right.

914
00:55:28,471 --> 00:55:32,760
Deported father. Dear Billy Justice. Uh,

915
00:55:32,761 --> 00:55:35,580
two and a half years ago,
my father was deported to Mexico.

916
00:55:35,730 --> 00:55:39,210
He had been in the u s
since 1978 since he was 13.

917
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:43,170
My family struggled without him
financially and emotionally.

918
00:55:43,171 --> 00:55:47,970
It's been very rough. I must have been
brutal. He's healthy and not dead,

919
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,410
but he can't be with us. Yeah. That's
got to be, oh man, that's fucking brutal.

920
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:55,950
It's been very frustrating and
words can't describe it. Uh,

921
00:55:55,951 --> 00:55:59,790
I'm getting married in a few weeks and
he wasn't able to be at the wedding every

922
00:55:59,970 --> 00:56:04,890
day. I see people criticized Trump and
can agree with their reasons for doing so.

923
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:08,070
But my father was deported under Obama.

924
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:13,230
My family knows three other people
who are also deported under Obama.

925
00:56:13,890 --> 00:56:18,890
My white friends think they're good
people because they liked Obama but never

926
00:56:19,201 --> 00:56:23,790
looked to see what was happening.
Um, they didn't care then they care.

927
00:56:23,791 --> 00:56:28,470
Now it makes me feel very mad
because it feels insincere and lazy.

928
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:33,450
As a white man who seems fairly
progressive, can you tell me why this is?

929
00:56:33,870 --> 00:56:38,760
What would you suggest? I say to
them, it's an emotional thing for me.

930
00:56:38,761 --> 00:56:42,270
So it's hard to choose the right words.
Congrats on your child.

931
00:56:42,271 --> 00:56:46,610
I have two nieces and it's really the
greatest thing to watch them grow. Uh,

932
00:56:46,650 --> 00:56:49,740
thank you. Um, what can you say to them?

933
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:51,660
How it depends on how
open minded they are.

934
00:56:52,890 --> 00:56:54,960
People who are really into politics,

935
00:56:55,530 --> 00:57:00,330
which means they 100% watch CNN or
Fox News all fucking day as if they're

936
00:57:00,331 --> 00:57:03,810
getting some sort of fair
and unbiased newsfeed.

937
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:07,320
You really can't say anything to
either one of them. Um, but I mean,

938
00:57:07,321 --> 00:57:12,000
there are a lot like sports
fans where, uh, I try to see,

939
00:57:12,001 --> 00:57:16,590
you know,
I tried to the best I can to see boats.

940
00:57:16,591 --> 00:57:19,740
Like I could legitimately be happy
for eagles fans. You know what I mean?

941
00:57:19,830 --> 00:57:22,440
I can legitimately look at
fucking Derek Jeter and say,

942
00:57:22,441 --> 00:57:27,441
that guy's fucking great and I can set
aside my hatred of the Yankees are my

943
00:57:27,481 --> 00:57:32,220
wanting for my team to beat
the eagles yesterday. But,

944
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:36,090
um, you know, it took me
a long time to get there.

945
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:42,480
Um, so I dunno, I mean,

946
00:57:42,481 --> 00:57:45,480
no one, the way I was wired, I would
just walk right up to him. Bj, you know,

947
00:57:45,481 --> 00:57:48,900
just so you know, you're fucking
angel there. Obama, you know,

948
00:57:48,901 --> 00:57:52,410
who for some reason gets
no shit whatsoever. I mean,

949
00:57:52,411 --> 00:57:54,210
it probably doesn't hurt that he went,

950
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:57,610
that his presidency was between
two of the fucking right.

951
00:57:59,790 --> 00:58:03,990
Two of the biggest fucking dip shits
I've ever seen is fucking, did I say dip?

952
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,140
Shyman so that cause trying to think all
the fucking word I could sing and not

953
00:58:07,141 --> 00:58:11,220
be too fucking offensive and think that
I'm a fucking lefty here. 100%. Which,

954
00:58:11,221 --> 00:58:14,810
you know, most of the times I am,
but I mean, yeah, he keep food.

955
00:58:14,811 --> 00:58:18,660
We Shantay ain't fucking me. Hey, you're
not getting full weekend when, after that.

956
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:20,910
And then this guy who
fucking tweets all the time.

957
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:26,790
And then before that you had a guy shoving
cigars in his fucking people's twats.

958
00:58:26,850 --> 00:58:27,683
I mean,

959
00:58:28,670 --> 00:58:29,220
yeah,

960
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:29,681
I'll tell,
you know,

961
00:58:29,681 --> 00:58:34,681
it's been really rough since the first
George Bush who actually had the,

962
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:38,913
you know,

963
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:40,770
okay,

964
00:58:40,770 --> 00:58:44,230
well we, we, we pushed
Saddam out of Kuwait,

965
00:58:44,890 --> 00:58:47,310
didn't go into fucking Iraq and was,

966
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:51,580
was strong enough to push back against
the fucking corporation. Say, hey look,

967
00:58:51,581 --> 00:58:53,200
this is not what we were doing over here.

968
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:57,910
We accomplished our mission and we're
going home. That's it. You know?

969
00:58:57,940 --> 00:59:01,550
So it's been a long fucking time.
So I think that there's a, uh,

970
00:59:03,690 --> 00:59:04,210
yeah,

971
00:59:04,210 --> 00:59:08,680
there's the thing with Obama, at least he
wasn't Bush or Trump, uh, kind of thing,

972
00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:11,290
so that people have a
hard time seeing them.

973
00:59:11,291 --> 00:59:15,790
And I think he gets handled with kids
gloves in the media, you know what I mean?

974
00:59:15,791 --> 00:59:17,470
They, they, you know, every image of him,

975
00:59:17,471 --> 00:59:21,190
he's like kayaking or fucking playing
highlight and all of this shit.

976
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:25,330
Like the joke I was doing in my
acting like it looks like an erectile

977
00:59:25,331 --> 00:59:29,380
dysfunction ad and they're
really kind of ignoring that,

978
00:59:29,381 --> 00:59:31,930
that guy for all the hope
that he said and everything.

979
00:59:31,931 --> 00:59:35,920
And I know that that job is,
you know, well, I don't know,

980
00:59:35,950 --> 00:59:39,520
like literally no, but I understand
that it's an incredibly difficult job.

981
00:59:39,521 --> 00:59:43,180
And they always say, if you could
get one thing done, which he did,

982
00:59:43,181 --> 00:59:46,840
he did get Obamacare through.
So I guess it was,

983
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:50,650
uh, an achievement.
But I have to tell you,

984
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:55,980
as someone who does lean left to watch
him go on tour now with $70 million a

985
00:59:57,581 --> 01:00:02,410
tour dates to go talk to a bunch of
fucking bankers and corporations,

986
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:06,860
you know, and all of that
and, and just, I dunno it just

987
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:09,880
as far as the way I read that,

988
01:00:09,881 --> 01:00:12,700
that's just those corporations
washing their bribe money.

989
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:16,540
Like we got you in office,
you did what we wanted you to do.

990
01:00:16,810 --> 01:00:20,920
Now come talk to us for an hour and
we'll give you a nice six figure paycheck

991
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:24,910
and we'll all do it. And then you can
be worth over a hundred million dollars.

992
01:00:24,911 --> 01:00:28,240
Like the Clintons, like the bushes
and all, like it's so fucked up,

993
01:00:28,241 --> 01:00:32,230
but none of them get called out on that.
It's like the bushes, the Clintons,

994
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:33,041
the Obamas.

995
01:00:33,041 --> 01:00:38,041
It's like you guys dedicated your life
to public service and the presidency is

996
01:00:39,671 --> 01:00:44,620
the highest paying job, which now is
like a half a million dollars a year.

997
01:00:44,621 --> 01:00:49,000
If you do two terms,
you're going to grow stops.

998
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:52,480
You Go, what is that? 500 times
fucking eight, what does that,

999
01:00:52,481 --> 01:00:53,890
that's 4 million bucks.

1000
01:00:54,610 --> 01:00:57,790
And somehow they all,
they're,

1001
01:00:57,791 --> 01:01:02,350
they're buying giant houses and they
all end up being worth nine figures.

1002
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:09,270
Um, and everybody just looks
the other fucking way. I Dunno.

1003
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:13,430
So, uh, I maybe,

1004
01:01:13,530 --> 01:01:17,790
maybe there's someone within your group
that is understanding enough and can see

1005
01:01:17,791 --> 01:01:20,520
both sides of that.
You know,

1006
01:01:20,521 --> 01:01:24,710
like if I said what I just said about
Obama to a Trump person, they will be

1007
01:01:26,610 --> 01:01:29,370
maybe be going fucking bananas.

1008
01:01:29,730 --> 01:01:33,540
But then if I even remotely suggested
that Trump seemed a little emotionally

1009
01:01:33,541 --> 01:01:38,541
unstable and that it's really doing the
country a disservice to be tweeting in

1010
01:01:39,691 --> 01:01:42,810
arguing with people on social
media like a seventh grade girl.

1011
01:01:42,870 --> 01:01:47,100
I don't even fucking respond to
people on Twitter when it comes.

1012
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:51,660
Occasionally I do. But this is supposed
to be the leader of the free world,

1013
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:57,750
trying to get a Trump supporter to admit
to how pathetic and embarrassing that

1014
01:01:57,751 --> 01:02:00,960
is. I mean, that's just kind of
the world that we're in right now,

1015
01:02:01,290 --> 01:02:04,360
but maybe one of those Obama
supporters. Maybe you could, um,

1016
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:10,490
you know, I dunno, but then also
we live in such a fucked up world.

1017
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:14,480
I'm going to believe that you're actually
Mexican and you wrote this and that

1018
01:02:14,481 --> 01:02:17,750
you're not some white person that wrote
this shit because they hate Obama.

1019
01:02:17,751 --> 01:02:21,710
I have no fucking idea. You never
know. There's no way for me to vet.

1020
01:02:22,220 --> 01:02:26,000
So, um, if what you just said
was true, uh, that is horrific.

1021
01:02:26,001 --> 01:02:29,180
And I understand what you're saying,
uh,

1022
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:32,220
about Obama because, you know, I,

1023
01:02:32,221 --> 01:02:35,810
I think the best thing he had was he
could deliver a speech better than Bush or

1024
01:02:35,811 --> 01:02:39,920
Trump, but a, at the end of the
day, I even know the, you know,

1025
01:02:39,921 --> 01:02:44,690
the needle kind of lean more left when
he was an office that the ship stayed on

1026
01:02:44,691 --> 01:02:47,510
course, if you know what I'm saying. Um,

1027
01:02:49,410 --> 01:02:50,750
now what I'm wearing right now,

1028
01:02:50,751 --> 01:02:53,420
I want that guy from Reno to come
walking into my fucking broom here.

1029
01:02:53,421 --> 01:02:57,050
Heck shows in respect. All
right. Boyfriend's best friend,

1030
01:02:57,710 --> 01:03:02,060
a dear Billy boy lady here.
Oh,

1031
01:03:02,061 --> 01:03:03,710
here comes some red shoe diaries.
Shit,

1032
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:07,220
I been seeing slash dating my best friend

1033
01:03:08,780 --> 01:03:12,350
for almost a year now. And we love
listening to your podcast together.

1034
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:16,370
It's almost, it's absolutely, it's
going absolutely fucking wonderful.

1035
01:03:16,371 --> 01:03:20,380
Except the one thing.
Oh,

1036
01:03:20,490 --> 01:03:22,130
this is the winter in a
completely different direction.

1037
01:03:22,131 --> 01:03:25,190
I thought you would say you wanted to
bang your fucking boyfriend's best friend.

1038
01:03:25,210 --> 01:03:28,010
All right. Okay. Um,

1039
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:32,540
it's going absolutely fucking wonderful
except for one thing is best friends

1040
01:03:32,541 --> 01:03:37,541
since and pictures of naked slash slash
half naked girls from Instagram to him.

1041
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:42,050
Uh,
we recently became long distance,

1042
01:03:42,051 --> 01:03:46,430
so I'm not sure of the frequency still,
but before I moved away,

1043
01:03:46,730 --> 01:03:49,970
he did it almost daily.
My issue is one,

1044
01:03:50,450 --> 01:03:55,130
his best friend girlfriends complained
to me about it instead of taking it up

1045
01:03:55,131 --> 01:03:55,964
with him.

1046
01:03:56,650 --> 01:03:57,483
Okay.

1047
01:03:57,710 --> 01:04:02,120
And I tell him, I tell her to just
talk to him. Wait, wait, wait.

1048
01:04:02,121 --> 01:04:04,610
I don't think there's too
many fucking pronouns in here.

1049
01:04:04,611 --> 01:04:09,480
I don't know who the fuck
you talking about. Oh,

1050
01:04:09,481 --> 01:04:10,740
his best friend's girlfriend.

1051
01:04:10,741 --> 01:04:14,940
So the girlfriend of the guy sending
the pictures complains to me about it

1052
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:20,100
instead of taking it up with him
and I tell her to just talk to him.

1053
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:21,270
And number two,

1054
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:26,420
it's actually hard to take that advice
because I don't want him to think I'm

1055
01:04:26,971 --> 01:04:28,440
trying to control his life.

1056
01:04:28,441 --> 01:04:32,940
Some of these pictures are actually girls
that they know and not just pictures

1057
01:04:32,941 --> 01:04:37,170
from the chive or the code of man.
I don't even know what that is.

1058
01:04:37,470 --> 01:04:38,251
My question is,

1059
01:04:38,251 --> 01:04:43,020
do I have the right to be heard
about out about this? Well,

1060
01:04:43,050 --> 01:04:47,400
are you heard about this?
Yes. I'm going to say yes.

1061
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:51,720
Are you a free person? Yes. As much as
they'll let you be. So I would say, yes,

1062
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:54,330
you do. If so, how do I
bring this up to them?

1063
01:04:54,570 --> 01:04:58,710
I've lost over 30 pounds over the course
of us seeing one another and frankly

1064
01:04:58,711 --> 01:05:02,080
thought it, it would stop, but it hasn't.

1065
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:06,690
That's not why I lost the weight,
by the way. Did it for myself.

1066
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:09,700
Okay, well that was weird. The,

1067
01:05:09,701 --> 01:05:13,450
I thought all of a sudden you were
stressing out or thanks for the advice and

1068
01:05:13,451 --> 01:05:15,880
kind of like go fuck yourself. Ah,
well that's great. First of all,

1069
01:05:15,881 --> 01:05:17,670
you got yourself in great shape.

1070
01:05:18,150 --> 01:05:20,470
You know he's giving you a
standing ovation right now. You're,

1071
01:05:20,471 --> 01:05:21,540
you're fucking vitals.

1072
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:26,130
All your major organs are loving you as
we live in a world now where everybody's

1073
01:05:26,131 --> 01:05:29,880
a hero, including overweight
people. You know what I mean?

1074
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:33,270
I'm telling you right now, uh, if your
vitals were standing in an airport,

1075
01:05:33,271 --> 01:05:36,540
you got off a plane that they would
not be giving you a fucking round of

1076
01:05:36,541 --> 01:05:38,610
applause.
Um,

1077
01:05:38,820 --> 01:05:41,490
staying in shape is the greatest fucking
thing you could ever do for yourself

1078
01:05:41,491 --> 01:05:42,990
and you fucking deserve it.
All right?

1079
01:05:43,170 --> 01:05:48,150
And fucking stop playing the victim and
do something about it and admit to the

1080
01:05:48,151 --> 01:05:51,300
fact that you're the one with the hand
shoving that fucking cupcake down your

1081
01:05:51,301 --> 01:05:55,020
fucking throat. I'm sorry, I'm
getting off track here. Um,

1082
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:58,890
I would actually, I absolutely bring it
up with them. That's completely fucked up.

1083
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:03,070
If that bothers you, you should
say something and that, um,

1084
01:06:03,510 --> 01:06:04,111
that other guy,

1085
01:06:04,111 --> 01:06:09,111
the guy sending the
photos is being completely
disrespectful to you and you and

1086
01:06:09,521 --> 01:06:12,960
your boyfriend. You know,
he's happy in a relationship.

1087
01:06:12,961 --> 01:06:17,550
Why the fuck is he doing this shit?
Maybe he's jealous. Maybe he's a moron.

1088
01:06:17,551 --> 01:06:18,181
I have no idea.

1089
01:06:18,181 --> 01:06:21,600
I would absolutely bring it up to them
and just say it the way he said it. Like,

1090
01:06:21,601 --> 01:06:24,060
you know, this is something that's
bothered me for a long time.

1091
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:26,313
MMM.

1092
01:06:27,450 --> 01:06:31,130
You know, this is so weird. I actually
think if you don't get emotional,

1093
01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:33,770
do you don't like cry
and do the woman thing,

1094
01:06:33,771 --> 01:06:35,570
which literally freaks most guys out.

1095
01:06:35,571 --> 01:06:39,230
Or maybe I'm superimposing most guys
with the way I feel like when a woman

1096
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:42,740
starts crying, I just started thinking
like, oh Jesus Christ, here we go.

1097
01:06:43,730 --> 01:06:47,000
Here's and isn't a high now how do I,
how do I argue my side now when you,

1098
01:06:47,001 --> 01:06:49,910
when you as an adult are actually
crying about this right now.

1099
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:52,833
MMM.

1100
01:06:53,900 --> 01:06:57,110
Then I'm a pushover. Okay. Cause anytime
my daughter cries, that's it. I'm done.

1101
01:06:57,870 --> 01:07:01,130
And my wife just rolls, rolls arise
in me just like she's not even crying.

1102
01:07:01,131 --> 01:07:04,160
She's whining bill. And I'm like, I nine
one of them. Fuck am I supposed to do?

1103
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:05,813
MMM.

1104
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:12,280
I would just matter of factly just selling
you. That really hurts me. And, um,

1105
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:15,250
but I didn't want to bring it up to,
cause I didn't want to seem like a Nag,

1106
01:07:15,251 --> 01:07:18,700
but I'm just letting you know that that
really bothers me and I don't think it's

1107
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:20,560
right.
And just imagine

1108
01:07:22,220 --> 01:07:26,870
if we turn the tables and
one of my girlfriends was
sending me pictures of guys

1109
01:07:26,871 --> 01:07:31,460
with their dicks out every day.
Like how would that make you feel?

1110
01:07:32,540 --> 01:07:35,450
Okay.
I'm not saying you have to stop doing it.

1111
01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:37,220
I'm just telling you that it bothers me.

1112
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:41,470
Just put it on that and let him make the
fucking decision rather than comment.

1113
01:07:41,471 --> 01:07:45,500
Cause I can say it.
Tell you as a typical fucking guy,

1114
01:07:45,710 --> 01:07:47,370
if you come out,
I believe

1115
01:07:47,630 --> 01:07:48,463
talk to you.

1116
01:07:53,550 --> 01:07:56,640
All the guys thinking it was like,
oh my God, Oh my God, how the fuck.

1117
01:07:58,020 --> 01:08:00,540
I mean I understand that
women are more emotional,

1118
01:08:00,541 --> 01:08:04,950
but when you fucking do that in a lot
of ways it's not fair to the guy because

1119
01:08:04,951 --> 01:08:09,951
there's no way you can argue with another
adult that is literally breaking down

1120
01:08:10,261 --> 01:08:11,094
crying.

1121
01:08:11,930 --> 01:08:12,360
Okay.

1122
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:16,060
Okay. I've been in relationships
and I've seen women crying,

1123
01:08:17,530 --> 01:08:21,580
you know, talking to me, me about
something to this level crying.

1124
01:08:21,581 --> 01:08:22,690
And I'm thinking in my head like,

1125
01:08:22,691 --> 01:08:25,360
I haven't seen people crying
like this at a funeral.

1126
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:29,020
So it really takes away your ability

1127
01:08:30,350 --> 01:08:34,280
to argue your side if you have a side.
And that causes resentment,

1128
01:08:35,170 --> 01:08:38,800
you know, to mention the fact that
women can cry on cue. I swear to God,

1129
01:08:38,801 --> 01:08:43,801
I feel like some of the time it's
a minimal manipulation tactics,

1130
01:08:44,111 --> 01:08:48,610
but if you are able to just
just say it and just say,

1131
01:08:48,611 --> 01:08:51,190
I don't want to be a Nag. And I'm not
saying that he has to stop doing it,

1132
01:08:51,220 --> 01:08:53,140
I'm just letting you know
that it really bothers me.

1133
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:56,710
And then if it was going the other way
and I was getting Dick pics sent to me

1134
01:08:56,711 --> 01:08:59,200
every day, uh, I don't think
that you'd be too thrilled.

1135
01:09:00,190 --> 01:09:03,010
And then just let them deal with that.
And that'd be like,

1136
01:09:03,011 --> 01:09:06,280
I'm not gonna say anything else about
it. I'm just letting you know. All right.

1137
01:09:06,460 --> 01:09:08,590
And then let him fucking deal
with it and see what he does.

1138
01:09:09,340 --> 01:09:12,880
That would be my advice. All right.
Girlfriend has higher sex drive than me.

1139
01:09:14,140 --> 01:09:17,230
Um, all right, dear Billy. Fuck nuts.

1140
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:20,320
That reminds me of that
classic Louis C K joke.

1141
01:09:20,321 --> 01:09:25,321
Tamil at that time when he was dating
the NYMPHOMANIAC and she and she kept

1142
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:28,810
going, let's do it again.
Let's do it again. And it goes,

1143
01:09:28,811 --> 01:09:33,811
and she was really just backing into me
and it really fucking hurt and I wanted

1144
01:09:34,901 --> 01:09:35,734
to say,
Hey,

1145
01:09:36,250 --> 01:09:40,600
can you stop banging back into me
before your rip my Dick off you fucking

1146
01:09:40,601 --> 01:09:44,950
psycho. But instead I
said, hey, take it easy.

1147
01:09:49,450 --> 01:09:53,050
All right, girlfriend has higher sex drive
to me. All right, dear Billy. Fuck nuts.

1148
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:57,160
I started dating an old girlfriend from
high school after 10 years of being

1149
01:09:57,170 --> 01:10:00,640
apart. Oh, like little when
Harry met Sally. Right.

1150
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:05,680
I'm now 26 and she's 27. We've been
going steady for about seven months.

1151
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:07,300
I love it.
You said we're going steady.

1152
01:10:07,301 --> 01:10:12,130
This guy's like an old soul and
everything has been great up until around

1153
01:10:12,130 --> 01:10:14,890
Christmas where the problem began.
To give you some background,

1154
01:10:14,891 --> 01:10:18,840
I work from seven in the morning.
Uh,

1155
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:22,710
she doesn't go to work until five in
the afternoon and gets out at one.

1156
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:26,280
Oh,
you go to work at seven in the morning.

1157
01:10:26,281 --> 01:10:29,790
You didn't tell me when you stopped
though. Um, she doesn't drive,

1158
01:10:30,030 --> 01:10:31,740
so I have to pick her up every night.

1159
01:10:31,950 --> 01:10:35,160
The only day we have off
together is every other Saturday.

1160
01:10:35,910 --> 01:10:37,590
By the time we get back to my place,

1161
01:10:37,591 --> 01:10:41,760
I'm completely exhausted and pretty much
falling asleep while she's wide awake

1162
01:10:41,761 --> 01:10:45,840
and usually wants to have sex. Recently
my sex drive has plummeted. Yeah,

1163
01:10:45,841 --> 01:10:46,770
but you're not getting any sleep.

1164
01:10:46,771 --> 01:10:49,770
It's gonna and I can tell
you that having a kid now,

1165
01:10:50,310 --> 01:10:54,240
and that's totally true to
sex in your relationship.

1166
01:10:54,540 --> 01:10:58,770
It just takes such a back seat. It
kid goes to sleep and it's like, hey,

1167
01:10:58,771 --> 01:11:02,520
we could hook up or we could
get like 50 minutes of sleep

1168
01:11:04,810 --> 01:11:09,680
point. It's like gold. Um, anyways, um,

1169
01:11:09,740 --> 01:11:11,320
recently my sex drive is plummeted.

1170
01:11:11,330 --> 01:11:14,340
Not because I don't find her attractive
or because I don't care about her,

1171
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:19,050
but I'm just drained of energy after
working 50 hours a week with maybe four

1172
01:11:19,051 --> 01:11:20,430
hours of sleep every night.

1173
01:11:20,490 --> 01:11:24,630
And after about five months
of sex every other night,

1174
01:11:24,810 --> 01:11:29,700
it starts to feel like a chore. Sometimes.
I've been turning her down lately. Uh,

1175
01:11:29,701 --> 01:11:32,700
this has caused a lot of arguments
and fights in the past two months.

1176
01:11:32,701 --> 01:11:36,690
That's probably because she
doesn't know why. You know,

1177
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:41,220
guys, you know, generally speaking,
our horn dogs in any, you know,

1178
01:11:41,250 --> 01:11:45,060
you could be in the middle of the fucking
having chemo and the in your girl be,

1179
01:11:45,061 --> 01:11:47,460
hey, you all, you fucking do
it. You know, banging her.

1180
01:11:47,461 --> 01:11:51,660
Will you stand up with that
fucking drip in your arm? Um,

1181
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:55,200
I feel like she doesn't respect my desire
to get some rest and I've suggested

1182
01:11:55,201 --> 01:11:58,860
sex in the morning, but at that
point she's already pissed at me.

1183
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:01,880
All right,
well if you communicated it

1184
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:04,903
and

1185
01:12:06,130 --> 01:12:09,690
she's still not willing to work with you,
then she's kind of being immature. Yeah.

1186
01:12:10,140 --> 01:12:10,360
Uh,

1187
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:14,430
she seems to think I don't care about
her and that when I try to suggest maybe

1188
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:17,110
sex a certain amount a week,
like three or four,

1189
01:12:17,230 --> 01:12:21,640
she gets mad at me and that she
always wants tasks to initiate it.

1190
01:12:22,030 --> 01:12:26,110
Uh, I've been trying to be more consistent
with being sexually available and more

1191
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:26,980
affectionate lately.

1192
01:12:26,981 --> 01:12:30,910
Like visiting her on lunch break and
getting her small clips like flowers to

1193
01:12:30,911 --> 01:12:33,280
show that I care. But the
problem is still here. Yeah.

1194
01:12:33,281 --> 01:12:35,830
Cause this is all you're
not communicating.

1195
01:12:36,850 --> 01:12:37,500
Okay.

1196
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:39,130
Uh,
when we do actually have sex,

1197
01:12:39,131 --> 01:12:42,940
sometimes it's just boring for me because
I'm not in the mood or I really don't

1198
01:12:42,941 --> 01:12:44,830
have the energy to do
anything but lay there.

1199
01:12:44,980 --> 01:12:47,830
I really love this girl and don't want
to lose her due to something like this.

1200
01:12:47,831 --> 01:12:51,310
Do you have any advice for my problem
and when we, when we come back,

1201
01:12:51,820 --> 01:12:55,180
you bald ginger ball bag.
Um, I would say this,

1202
01:12:56,130 --> 01:12:59,530
you guys need to sit down
and have a talk and just say,

1203
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:01,180
just say everything you just said to me.

1204
01:13:01,390 --> 01:13:05,590
This is the problem with
most relationships is people
in it say the things that

1205
01:13:05,591 --> 01:13:10,120
they should be saying to each other to
other people and then they expect the

1206
01:13:10,121 --> 01:13:11,590
other person to be a mind reader.

1207
01:13:11,650 --> 01:13:14,260
She has no idea that you
know how tired you are.

1208
01:13:14,470 --> 01:13:17,400
Just tell her and just tell her that
you love her and that you're afraid that

1209
01:13:17,401 --> 01:13:22,180
you're, that you're going to lose her and
all of that type of stuff. And just say,

1210
01:13:22,181 --> 01:13:26,530
the reason why I'm doing it not
been in the mood is not because you,

1211
01:13:26,531 --> 01:13:30,250
it's because I'm fucking exhausted.
I'm like a Zombie.

1212
01:13:30,430 --> 01:13:34,300
I'm getting four hours of sleep and um,

1213
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:37,990
and just tell her that it hurts you,
that you're hurting her.

1214
01:13:37,991 --> 01:13:42,991
So I really needed to clear the air and
just sit down and clear the fucking air.

1215
01:13:44,060 --> 01:13:48,250
All right? That's what the fuck I
would do. Okay. That's the podcast.

1216
01:13:48,310 --> 01:13:53,050
Once again, congratulations
to you or super bowl champion,

1217
01:13:53,051 --> 01:13:57,760
Philadelphia Eagles. Um,
like I said, you know,

1218
01:13:57,790 --> 01:13:59,470
I hope you guys know all
the, all these, you know,

1219
01:13:59,471 --> 01:14:02,620
I had one bad fucking show in Philly
and everybody thinks I hate the fucking

1220
01:14:02,621 --> 01:14:04,810
city.
I actually loved the city.

1221
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:10,140
Other than the fact you have 58 one ways
going to the left before there's one go

1222
01:14:11,391 --> 01:14:12,130
into the right

1223
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:15,550
and then another 58 going left and
then 60 going right after that.

1224
01:14:15,551 --> 01:14:20,410
It makes no fucking sense. Other than
that, I really don't have a beef with you.

1225
01:14:20,950 --> 01:14:22,540
Um, and a lot of times, you know,

1226
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:25,850
I wish that show happened in North
Carolina because I would've just stood on

1227
01:14:25,851 --> 01:14:30,430
stage making fun of them for
losing the civil war and a,

1228
01:14:30,431 --> 01:14:33,090
the fucking Charlotte
bobcat's in a hornets at all.

1229
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:35,770
I would just make fun of all that,
losing their fucking team and all of that.

1230
01:14:35,771 --> 01:14:39,460
That's what I would've done. I just happen
to be, I was actually in New Jersey.

1231
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:42,730
That's the funny thing about all of
it. Um, all right. That's the podcast.

1232
01:14:43,150 --> 01:14:47,710
Go fuck yourselves. Um, I
will check in on you on a,

1233
01:14:48,340 --> 01:14:49,840
what is it? Thursday. All right. See you.
