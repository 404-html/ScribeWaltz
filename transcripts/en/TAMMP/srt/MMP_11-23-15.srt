1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,430
Hey,

7
00:00:25,081 --> 00:00:29,280

I'm not doing shit for the last week.

8
00:00:29,281 --> 00:00:31,950
I already did it already accomplished
a dream of not doing shit.

9
00:00:31,951 --> 00:00:36,180
And this week I'm not doing shit right.
Greatest fucking holiday.

10
00:00:36,181 --> 00:00:39,420
The year everybody talks about Christmas.

11
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,600
People talking about flag day,
fucking Easter.

12
00:00:42,601 --> 00:00:45,060
I'm telling you this is the one you
don't have to buy shit. Oh you though.

13
00:00:45,061 --> 00:00:47,610
You just show up. You show up
little corn, beef and cabbage,

14
00:00:47,611 --> 00:00:51,660
whatever the whatever your little
family fucking dishes. You show up,

15
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,830
you smile, you do a couple
of air kisses, you know,

16
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:00,450
feed your fat fucking face and then
you just slip into the living room,

17
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:05,940
right?
And watch the game sitting on the sofa.

18
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,170
Then there's that other guy that's
socially fucking awkward guy who hides and

19
00:01:10,171 --> 00:01:12,930
alcohol sitting in the lazy boy.
You know,

20
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:16,260
you guys are angled just enough that you
can see each other in your peripheral

21
00:01:16,261 --> 00:01:18,660
but you never say anything.
You know,

22
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:22,800
a couple of times you go to start the
conversation and you see the lonely guy

23
00:01:22,801 --> 00:01:24,450
being excited,
but then he fucks it up.

24
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:28,320
He seen withdraw again and you try to
act like it didn't happen and that's just

25
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:32,160
a second quarter. All right. Anyways,

26
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,553
um,

27
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,450
I find I did my official way in
today to see the damage I did.

28
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,780
I was about a buck 65 or something before
I left to go to way back in September.

29
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:46,763
Right.

30
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:51,540
I was trying to get down to one 62 I
got to one 65 and one day I just skipped

31
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:52,890
rope and just sweated it out.

32
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,470
I got to like one 62 point something
but that's bullshit. Right.

33
00:01:55,471 --> 00:02:00,471
Got down on one 65 then I had a wedding
week long family event and then right

34
00:02:00,481 --> 00:02:05,280
after that I went to Texas for a week
and then Toronto and it came back for a

35
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,930
few days and then I went to DC. Then I
came back for a few days, like a week,

36
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,910
and then I did that two
week fucking tour of, uh,

37
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,980
the Midwest came back for three days.
Then I did the Philly run,

38
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,820
then I went to New York and I did MSG.

39
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:25,320
So in that time I knew I
was putting on way, uh,

40
00:02:25,321 --> 00:02:29,970
I knew I was doing, I knew
what I couldn't, I couldn't
stop, right? All right.

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,320
Now before I started this whole thing,

42
00:02:31,321 --> 00:02:35,970
I was 187 pounds of getting down to
one 65. I lost 22 fucking pounds.

43
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:40,590
So the big question is, Bill, you dumb.
Fuck. After you did all that work,

44
00:02:40,591 --> 00:02:44,340
you stupid cunt.
How much did you give back this morning

45
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:49,410
after weighing himself in September before
all the festivity of you see what I'm

46
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:53,190
talking about? 165 pounds. I weighed
myself this morning, right when I woke up,

47
00:02:53,191 --> 00:02:56,490
the most accurate weight from
what I've read on the Internet.

48
00:02:56,491 --> 00:03:00,550
So take that with a giant
grain of salt. And, uh,

49
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:05,530
one 76.8.
Ah,

50
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:10,870
Billy, what did you do? I just
remember my last night in New York,

51
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:15,960
fucking hammered eating
two slices of a sausage,

52
00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:21,160
Pepperoni, and it wasn't even good. And
after the first one, I was like, Jesus,

53
00:03:21,161 --> 00:03:22,480
this is so much shit on this.

54
00:03:22,481 --> 00:03:25,600
This feels like Chicago pizza
where like nobody in there,

55
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,600
nobody in their right mind ever has more
than one slice of deep dish pizza he

56
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:33,430
had just fucking can't do it.
You're, you're out of your
fucking mind. So anyways,

57
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:38,020
um, yeah. So I'm pissed that
I fucking went that hard,

58
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,440
fucked it up that much, but I'm
not, I didn't see the dreaded,

59
00:03:41,441 --> 00:03:43,930
the one that really depresses me is
when that second number is an eight.

60
00:03:43,931 --> 00:03:46,630
So I'm going to try to do the impossible.

61
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,330
The other thinkable Cleo, we have
stopped licking yourself so damn loud.

62
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,280
Hey Cleo,

63
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,063
Cleo,

64
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:03,280
we get you knock it off over there.

65
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:06,130
I know you gotta do what you gotta do.
You need a bath?

66
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:09,210
Okay.

67
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:12,660
Anyways, the fuck was I talking about? Oh,

68
00:04:12,661 --> 00:04:16,350
I'm gonna try to do the impossible.
The unthinkable. Now this, she goes,

69
00:04:16,351 --> 00:04:19,170
look at herself again. Good
Lord. No shame whatsoever.

70
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:23,640
I'm going to try to lose weight
during the holiday months here.

71
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,640
I'm actually during the week of
Thanksgiving, I'm trying to get to,

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,430
my goal is to be a,

73
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:32,100
to do the three pounds that I was doing
back in the summer drop three weeks.

74
00:04:32,101 --> 00:04:36,450
So that's one 73.8 is when I need to be
next Monday morning when I roll out of

75
00:04:36,451 --> 00:04:41,400
bed. And um, so we'll see what
happens. But he has a fucked up thing.

76
00:04:41,401 --> 00:04:44,430
I made three Pi's yesterday.
All right.

77
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,720
I'm not all for me obviously just people
come by the house and stuff like that.

78
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:53,721
So I made a cream pie or pumpkin pie and
an apple pie and I actually fucked with

79
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:57,840
the sacred family recipes.
Now I even had a slice of any of it yet,

80
00:04:57,841 --> 00:05:02,670
but I up the cinnamon
in my apple pie and um,

81
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:09,400
and I use this, this different recipe
was a butter base crust. And um,

82
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:13,840
my wife sent me a fucking text message.
I thought the house was on fire.

83
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:17,170
It was just Omg, Omg, Omg, OMG.

84
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,690
I can't even say it that fast
to fucking say it slower.

85
00:05:19,691 --> 00:05:23,820
Bill will be still on the stand. She wrote
Omg like 50 times in a row. So I was,

86
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:28,390
I had gone, I was driving. So I texted
while driving of course. And I said,

87
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:32,440
pie question mark,
question Mark House fire question mark.

88
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,820
And then she did a bunch of
Emoji Emoji Shit. And uh,

89
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:41,950
she wrote that pie is fucking delicious.
I said, how's the new cinnamon levels?

90
00:05:41,951 --> 00:05:45,970
She said perfect. And then I said yes
with an exclamation point. How about that?

91
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,710
You got to hear my whole
private text message

92
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:54,130
now that's the best apple
pies. A motherfucker, you know,

93
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,570
I don't know how you guys do it.

94
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:58,460
I use it like three different types of
apples got appeal and then you quarter

95
00:05:58,461 --> 00:06:01,970
and then you try to get like eight slices,
right? You slice them nice and thin.

96
00:06:01,971 --> 00:06:02,381
The Way Paul,

97
00:06:02,381 --> 00:06:06,440
he does the garlic and fucking good
fellas and you gotta you gotta have your

98
00:06:06,441 --> 00:06:08,780
mics ready though. So they don't
turn Brown. You stick them in there,

99
00:06:08,781 --> 00:06:10,060
you swish it around and all that.

100
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,920
You make sure it gets all over the
place and then, then the fucking,

101
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:17,720
the apples all intermingle, you know what
I mean? Like, like, like the higher ups.

102
00:06:17,721 --> 00:06:22,610
Don't want us to, everybody getting
along. I'm fucking with you.

103
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,470
I guess why I went down to the
comedy store yesterday for the,

104
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:30,980
for my first set since,
uh,

105
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:34,610
my last show in New York and I went
down there, I had the best fucking time.

106
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:35,871
I try it out,

107
00:06:35,871 --> 00:06:40,550
all this new material and I actually
walked into the comedy store and you know,

108
00:06:40,551 --> 00:06:43,700
they have the original room and
then they have the main room.

109
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,820
The original room is the
part of the original club
when they just bought half of

110
00:06:46,821 --> 00:06:46,911
it.

111
00:06:46,911 --> 00:06:51,200
It used to be in a nightclub called
Ciro's and a with the original room sits I

112
00:06:51,201 --> 00:06:56,000
think was the back of the main
room. So, um, and he's whatever,

113
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:58,250
come out to la, just walk
in, take a look at it.

114
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:03,080
So I got what's going on in the main room
and they go, Dick Gregory, I go white.

115
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:08,690
They go, Dick. Great. I go, Dick Gregory
is on stage right now. And they were like,

116
00:07:08,691 --> 00:07:13,610
yeah. And I went in there and the guy was
fucking hilarious. Still funny as hell.

117
00:07:13,611 --> 00:07:17,630
Still Edgy, talking about topical
stuff. He was talking about Paris,

118
00:07:17,631 --> 00:07:22,460
he was talking about all this
just right up to date stuff. Um,

119
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:28,190
he was fucking amazing. So that gave me
a charge. So then I go into the, the uh,

120
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:32,810
the original room, they bring
me up, I start doing my thing,

121
00:07:32,811 --> 00:07:37,130
everything's going great.
You know, I did my little one

122
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:41,390
wage gap, gift, a joke, and then
I get off stage, thanks a lot.

123
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:44,500
And uh,
all of a sudden there's lay,

124
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:50,720
she comes up to me and then she just
wants to present her case. She's like,

125
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:54,170
you know,
well actually I'm in my mid thirties,

126
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:58,430
and now I'm at an age now that when I
go out with a guy, he wants to go Dutch.

127
00:07:58,431 --> 00:08:03,320
She expects me to pay for half and
then I just go, well yeah, you should,

128
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,770
you know,
it should.

129
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,390
No, this is asking too much.
You're in your thirties.

130
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,080
You've demonstrated that you're not a
first round draft pick at this point.

131
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,560
You know you fucked up like
me so I know I'm fucked up.

132
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:24,790
I know you're fucked up or maybe
too driven to commit to anything.

133
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,820
So you know, we got to keep each
other at arm's length here, right?

134
00:08:27,821 --> 00:08:30,790
So I paid for my shit. You pay
for your shit. I couldn't be like,

135
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:33,870
I couldn't even listen to like that's
lets your big fucking complaint life that

136
00:08:33,871 --> 00:08:38,871
for the first 30 years you got free
fucking food and drinks like as a guide.

137
00:08:39,581 --> 00:08:41,410
You know how far back
into my life I got them.

138
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:43,150
They get to live like eight year olds.

139
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:46,720
When when you were a kid you just walked
around as a kid, you had no money.

140
00:08:46,721 --> 00:08:50,350
You went out with your parents yet
all fucking day. Yay you had drinks,

141
00:08:50,351 --> 00:08:55,000
you fucking on booze. But you know, cut
yourself a high c, whatever the you had,

142
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,190
you know,
went

143
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,950
to a ball game, whatever. You
never went in your pockets.

144
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,660
The life of a kid,
you know,

145
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,600
you essentially in that nightlight,
look,

146
00:09:06,601 --> 00:09:09,660
I obviously know that women don't
just not pay for fucking anything,

147
00:09:09,661 --> 00:09:13,320
but I'm just saying that
when they get courted,

148
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:14,693
you know,

149
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:20,960
you don't have to pay for Shit
generally speaking. Right.

150
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,740
So anyways, so she comes up to me and I
just didn't want to fucking hear it. And,

151
00:09:24,741 --> 00:09:28,790
uh, I made the mistake, I treated her like
a guy and I feel bad. I just completely,

152
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,210
I just gave a shit and then she was like,

153
00:09:32,211 --> 00:09:34,790
going how you're being mean and
everything I make, it's a comedy club,

154
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,350
but Canadians,
this is what we do.

155
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:38,220
Okay.

156
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,970
And then she wanted to make her
fucking point and I just, you know,

157
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:46,470
I just walked away and then of course
I made the mistake of asking another

158
00:09:46,471 --> 00:09:49,380
comic. I goes, I just two main
there. And he's like, yeah, no, no.

159
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,420
Comedian will never say you're to me

160
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,410
felt like the, uh, the
right level of it. Um,

161
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:02,640
that's a pet peeve of mine.

162
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:07,670
I don't like when I'm standing on stage
and you could heckle me while I'm making

163
00:10:07,771 --> 00:10:10,260
my point. Instead, you don't,

164
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:13,620
you wait until I get off stage and then
you want to have some fucking, you know,

165
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,010
Charlie rose conversation about
what the fuck you think of the jail.

166
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:19,200
I don't give a shit at
that point. I, you know,

167
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:22,380
I would much rather that
you yell out during my show.

168
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,680
Okay,
I'm in my thirties.

169
00:10:25,681 --> 00:10:28,710
I got to pay for a date that we could
have had that hilarious conversation a

170
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:32,370
little back and forth.
But instead, you know,

171
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:37,290
I got to get off stage and then you come
up to me like I'm being debriefed after

172
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:41,720
my shift. You know what I
mean? See where I went. Right.

173
00:10:41,721 --> 00:10:44,280
To see where I went wrong. Like,
I don't want to fucking hear that.

174
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,160
But you're more than welcome to heckle me.
I don't give a shit.

175
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:51,780
I don't care about that. You know, I'm
up there just me and the mic stand.

176
00:10:51,781 --> 00:10:56,740
You know, I feel safe.
Uh, who's given you,

177
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,130
I was probably too much of
an asshole. What do, what
do, what do you want from me?

178
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:03,690
So anyways,
what the fuck happened to my Lsu Tigers?

179
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,590
Jesus Christ. I'm not even what
was on the road. A lot to shoe,

180
00:11:07,591 --> 00:11:11,640
so I missed most of the season,
but I watched the end of the Alabama game.

181
00:11:11,641 --> 00:11:15,120
They lost that game and the fucking
wheels fell off and they got their asses

182
00:11:15,121 --> 00:11:19,410
kicked by Arkansas. Who even knew they
still had a football program out there?

183
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,520
I mean it's Arkansas. When was the
last time you even heard of that state?

184
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:27,060
Bill Clinton was in office and that
was only in the first term that former

185
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:30,750
governor, a little rock,
Arkansas. All right.

186
00:11:30,751 --> 00:11:34,560
By the time he got to his second term,
they phased out Arkansas,

187
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,190
like the older brother on happy
days. Right? No more chuck.

188
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:42,120
Now he's at school now he doesn't exist.
Right.

189
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:46,820
I'd a fuck do you lose to them then?

190
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:51,010
Add in the Midwest and not in the south.
They're just there.

191
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:53,990
The name their capital.

192
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:54,980
Okay.

193
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,310
Little Rock. It's got little. How does he,
how does your capital have little in it?

194
00:11:58,311 --> 00:12:02,570
Yeah. Unbelievable. We fucking lose to
them. What do you mean? What are you,

195
00:12:02,571 --> 00:12:03,710
he goes on in Arkansas.

196
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:05,270
Yeah.

197
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:07,310
Some reason why I think
Arkansas, you know, I think of,

198
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,330
I think of like an
Oldsmobile four, four, two.

199
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:10,640
Yeah,

200
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,330
I guess 65 for some reason.
I know that riding around it,

201
00:12:14,331 --> 00:12:18,140
but they're all driving around
old cars like Cuba, you know?

202
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:21,800
But that embargo hit them real hard to,
even though there's no embargo on them,

203
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:26,980
but to just Arkansas. How to
Fuck d lose to Arkansas. Um,

204
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:29,900
I'm just waiting for
those fucking Arkansas sc.

205
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,970
See if you were actually
in the conference.

206
00:12:33,971 --> 00:12:35,050
I don't care.

207
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:36,520
Okay.

208
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:41,040
And then who the fuck did they play
this past week? Uh, all miss. No,

209
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:43,750
right down there on the goal line.
And one guy thinks it's a fake play.

210
00:12:43,751 --> 00:12:46,720
The other guy's trying to hand it
off to him was fucking keystone cops.

211
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:48,763
Yeah.

212
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,170
Keystone cops.
This is what kills me.

213
00:12:50,171 --> 00:12:52,240
They'll probably end up getting rid
of les miles. You know what I mean?

214
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,680
I love that one bad fucking year.

215
00:12:53,681 --> 00:12:55,780
And then all of a sudden you don't
know how to coach anymore. He watched,

216
00:12:55,781 --> 00:12:57,480
they'll run them right out, you
know? Well, show me, show me.

217
00:12:57,481 --> 00:13:01,180
He's got to answer to this. Nobody
could just just be like, you know what?

218
00:13:01,181 --> 00:13:04,570
We had a bad fucking year. It's gotta
be like, Oh, you know what? That's it.

219
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,490
You're done.
You don't know how to do this anymore.

220
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,910
Does that happen at your guys' jobs?
You know what I mean?

221
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:14,320
Say you're working at staples,
right, and you fucking a,

222
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:17,710
you're going down to the dial with the
three ring binders and you think they're

223
00:13:17,711 --> 00:13:19,990
on the lefthand side. They were on
the right hand side. Then they go,

224
00:13:19,991 --> 00:13:24,440
you know why you just can't do it anymore.
It's over.

225
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,900
You've been here for fucking four years.

226
00:13:26,901 --> 00:13:30,120
I don't think you're not to work at
staples anymore. I know I'm, I'm, I'm,

227
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:34,690
I guess I'm belittling both people
belittling that job and I was a belittling

228
00:13:34,691 --> 00:13:36,160
the job of working at staples.

229
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:40,540
I think the job at staples is a big thing
as you hide in the back room because

230
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,570
they have so little people on the floor.
If you walk out on the floor,

231
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,280
everybody's going to ask you a question.
Right?

232
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,320
You're going to walk out and ski with me.
Excuse me

233
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,030
sir, sir, sir? Yes.
Could you tell me where

234
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:57,910
my dad is? Age, birthdays coming up
and we had Devon Kelley paper. Yeah.

235
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,040
That's when you should legally be able
to just grab somebody by the back of the

236
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:05,850
head and steer them towards
where they need to be. You know,

237
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:09,970
this then like push their head down to
see where it is on the shelf and then as

238
00:14:09,971 --> 00:14:10,601
you go to let go,

239
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:14,830
you give them that little push before
you do that causes them to do that half a

240
00:14:14,831 --> 00:14:19,060
step and put their hands out like
a toddler about ready to fall. Um,

241
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:24,280
anyways, um, I barely watched
any football yesterday.

242
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:27,070
I got a couple of things done that,
uh,

243
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:31,030
we're hanging over my head that we're
going to cause me to not enjoy my fucking

244
00:14:31,031 --> 00:14:35,630
holidays. Um, I am now at the age is,

245
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,420
it's somebody asked me to write
a letter of recommendation

246
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:43,690
for this fucking thing and I just kept
putting it off and putting it off and I

247
00:14:43,691 --> 00:14:46,600
was like, you know, Bill, this person just
trying to get on with their life here.

248
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:51,990
So I just sat down and fucking
forced all my add away.

249
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:57,350
You know, I opened the email, but I
looked at a bunch of other emails first.

250
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:02,450
I gradually closed all the windows and a,
I missed all the one o'clock games.

251
00:15:02,451 --> 00:15:07,070
I caught the tail end of the cowboys game.
I was psyched for the cowboys.

252
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:11,840
How fucking nuts is it that
they're undefeated with Tony Romo?

253
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:15,560
But the 10 games in,
it's just a fucking tragedy.

254
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:20,630
They were two and all Tony breaks
gets his fucking collarbone broken.

255
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,820
They lose seven in a row.

256
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,450
They go all four fucking seven

257
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:32,270
that totally comes back. Boom.
It's like he never left. You know,

258
00:15:32,271 --> 00:15:35,180
like that old friend you don't see for
20 fucking years and you can see each

259
00:15:35,181 --> 00:15:40,160
other. You just start laughing. You pick
up right where you left off. Tony Romo.

260
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:45,110
Tony Romo. I want to get a
cowboy. Feds bitch about them now.

261
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,600
Huh? Hey, you go. You got what you wanted.

262
00:15:47,601 --> 00:15:51,410
You got Tony out of the fucking
line up and look what happened. Oh,

263
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,760
four fucking seven.

264
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,330
Okay,

265
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:58,290
so now he's back.
Anyone I love is the fucking NFC.

266
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:03,291
He sucks so bad that they could actually
go on a run and still win the division.

267
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,270
Okay.

268
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,250
You know, that's what's killing
me about the giants right now.

269
00:16:07,251 --> 00:16:09,230
Cause I know I told you I never
want to see the giants can,

270
00:16:09,231 --> 00:16:11,240
I don't give a fuck that we beat him
in the regular season and thought it

271
00:16:11,241 --> 00:16:15,560
doesn't matter. Okay. I can't,
I, I can't handle another,

272
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,650
I can handle another Superbowl loss.

273
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:23,150
I can't handle another loss the way we
lose to the giants and just can't do it.

274
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:26,570
You know Tony Romm Rama Fades back.

275
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:30,540
That's a show comes up.
He does a show by accident.

276
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:34,900
Everybody goes after the show. A
tacky Friday. What? The football?

277
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,060
My Lane,
our touchdown.

278
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,370
Fuck that.
I can't,

279
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:44,240
I can't watch another one of
those John Brady back to pass.

280
00:16:44,241 --> 00:16:46,400
He's got to throw in fucking
half a yard or Westworld.

281
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,293
Correct.

282
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:51,600
I can't, I can't, I don't even
want to fucking deal with that.

283
00:16:51,601 --> 00:16:52,411
And this is what kills me.

284
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:57,030
The giants whose absolutely
have absolutely shit the
bed this year are in first

285
00:16:57,031 --> 00:17:00,060
place. I think with like
a fucking, you know,

286
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,460
foreign six record or something.
You know,

287
00:17:02,461 --> 00:17:05,640
I could just go on the Internet and I
could look this shit up or I could just

288
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:09,210
wing it. Um, no. Who's kidding? Who?

289
00:17:09,211 --> 00:17:12,650
I would love to play the giants
again as long as we win, you know,

290
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,980
to try it. But I even know if it was like
going to be a 50 50 and be like, yeah,

291
00:17:16,981 --> 00:17:19,050
you know, I don't need to go
through that emotionally anymore.

292
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:22,620
I really don't fucking kills me. How
much these stupid losses, you know,

293
00:17:22,621 --> 00:17:23,460
I never get a ring.

294
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:26,400
They don't ask me to get on the
duck boats for the parade duty.

295
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:27,810
Why the fuck do I care?

296
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:31,590
Why am I absolutely elated that the
Bruins if on two games in a row right now,

297
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:36,390
Huh? I don't know. I have no idea. Second,

298
00:17:36,391 --> 00:17:39,000
Wayne big winning against
the Toronto Maple leafs.

299
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:42,210
I've been at home getting caught up
with them being all they look all right.

300
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,980
Last couple games they look are right.
Definitely up and down season. Um,

301
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,020
so I don't know,

302
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:54,080
I won't pack it in until like February
and in February they still doing this

303
00:17:55,351 --> 00:17:57,330
stuff. Then he stuck getting
those awful feelings.

304
00:17:57,331 --> 00:18:01,560
Waikiki almost want your team to lose
so they get a better draft pick. Um,

305
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:06,000
but uh, I cannot, I can't
fucking do that. But anyways, oh,

306
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:09,540
did I miss it yesterday
to the islanders and uh,

307
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,470
Canadians play job bite
next from puck off.

308
00:18:13,471 --> 00:18:16,770
Told me that there was going to be bad
blood is going to be some bad blood in

309
00:18:16,771 --> 00:18:19,920
that game. I think I fucking
missed it. So anyways,

310
00:18:19,921 --> 00:18:24,921
but the big game tonight is a Ulu
to do is a patriots first the bills.

311
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,060
So,
um,

312
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,720
I'm going to try to do my best to get in
front of a TV so I can listen to bills,

313
00:18:33,721 --> 00:18:38,230
fans talking shit again, uh,
about what they're going to do,

314
00:18:38,231 --> 00:18:42,750
what we should have done. Right.
They're going to get all like, fuck Gig,

315
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:44,910
you fucking there.
I already got a text from somebody.

316
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,420
So one of my friends out there,
I think the shred and Reagan show,

317
00:18:48,421 --> 00:18:49,430
they texted me going,

318
00:18:49,431 --> 00:18:54,060
the Patriots are going to get their
asses whipped and I just wrote back,

319
00:18:54,061 --> 00:18:55,560
uh,
who were they playing?

320
00:18:56,410 --> 00:19:00,570
He goes to play in the bills
this year is super bowl champion.

321
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,900
And I just wrote back, I said,
well it should be a great game.

322
00:19:03,901 --> 00:19:07,500
You guys have a wonderful defense.
Good luck

323
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:14,550
just to fuses all this shit out.
Why is a, why you talking shit?

324
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,690
You know what I mean?
Dude,

325
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,690
the little fucking call me for good.

326
00:19:20,691 --> 00:19:24,360
He's going to do it for getting one
if he does it. And what if he does?

327
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,350
What are you going to do?
Huh?

328
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:30,250
You going to sit there and
grow your man tits with me?

329
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,250
You don't want to fucking do it.
You know?

330
00:19:32,251 --> 00:19:36,210
And I was watching a Bruins game and
I was so disgusted with myself. Um,

331
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:39,870
I had this workout for
like the last two periods.

332
00:19:39,871 --> 00:19:43,440
Every five minutes of the
game I would do 25 push ups.

333
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:48,830
Um, it's an easy way to do
200. You know what I mean?

334
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,800
You get nice long rest depending on uh,

335
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:53,430
how many penalties are
called and commercial breaks.

336
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:57,480
Just every five minutes you bang out 25.
I've got to do something guys.

337
00:19:57,481 --> 00:20:00,700
I made three fucking pies.
I'm in trouble here. Um,

338
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,800
but the key is I haven't had one yet so
I don't have the crack rolling around in

339
00:20:04,801 --> 00:20:08,220
my fucking system. All right, here we go.

340
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,410
Let me do some reads here for
this fucking weekend course.

341
00:20:10,411 --> 00:20:14,370
I got to type in my fucking podcast
and I park my password. Sorry.

342
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,860
See that I can't do two things at once.

343
00:20:16,861 --> 00:20:21,370
Like with like the women can
like the ladies. Um, alright.

344

It's gotta be snug and all the
right places. It's gotta look good.

It's got to feel good. Can't write up
your butt crack. You know what I mean?

But it can't lead you balls hanging
Jesus Christ.

384
00:22:56,251 --> 00:23:00,660
It's no wonder they don't fucking just
measure your whole fucking pelvic area.

385
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,380
I'd like to thank all of our pelvises
are different, just like fingerprints,

386
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:08,850
but despite that it'd be nice if we
could still find a common ground.

If you guys like straight ahead blues,

441
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:24,880
someone that can absolutely fucking shred
on the guitar and has a fucking voice

442
00:26:24,881 --> 00:26:25,690
to match.

443
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:30,690
Felicia Collins has a new album out
called Felicia Collins discovers the blues

444
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,160

448
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:53,610
CBS Orchestra and she was actually there
when they were way back when they were

449
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:57,750
on NBC. And um, so obviously the show's
over and now she's stretching out.

450
00:26:57,751 --> 00:27:01,170
So check it out. Tuesday, Felicia
Collins new album, the Felicia,

451

Um,

452
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:06,210

All right. And what else do

455
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:19,560
oh and p Corey Ellie is going to be a
guest on the Thursday afternoon podcasts

456
00:27:19,561 --> 00:27:22,390
just before Friday next week to promote.
Uh,

457
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:24,940
I believe it was new
standup special on showtime,

458
00:27:24,941 --> 00:27:26,500
which I heard is getting rave reviews.

459
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:31,000
He's one of my favorite comics of all
time and he's a great guy to go and see

460
00:27:31,001 --> 00:27:35,350
before he fucking blows up because
he's that level funny. Um, all right.

461
00:27:35,351 --> 00:27:37,120
And with that,
but that babbling,

462
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:41,800
let's march on here with the podcast.
Um,

463
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:44,860
what was I going to
say? Yeah, so I got it.

464
00:27:44,861 --> 00:27:47,170
I'm going to go to the fucking gym today.
At the second I do this.

465
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,550
So this is my game plan.

466
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:54,180
I'm going to do an hour
on the elliptical today,

467
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:55,683
Tuesday and Wednesday.

468
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,533
MMM.

469
00:27:56,710 --> 00:28:01,150
I'm doing the Joe Joe
Rogan's podcast on Tuesday,

470
00:28:01,151 --> 00:28:03,670
tomorrow. So, uh,

471
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,700
I might bring some of that
pie that I made over to them,

472
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:08,663
you know,

473
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:11,100
which should be a cool thing
to do for the holidays.

474
00:28:11,101 --> 00:28:13,920
Plus then I don't have it around here,
so I'm not fucking eating it. Right.

475
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:17,400
And then all they do is eat one.
I think that could work, right?

476
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:19,830
You've got to give away some of it.
Um,

477
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:25,380
but I'm going to do that three
hours of that by thanksgiving.

478
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:28,800
Am I one bad day is going
to be Thanksgiving then
I'm just gonna try to, uh,

479
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:29,970
I gotta turn around guys.

480
00:28:29,971 --> 00:28:32,400
If I go back up to the one 80 zone
would be so fucking depressed.

481
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:35,350
I just don't want to be that fucking
guy at the start of the year. Like, Oh,

482
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:36,540
good to fucking,
yeah.

483
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:37,510
Okay,

484
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:41,170
here we go. I'm going to
fucking get in shape. You know?
You know what that's like.

485
00:28:41,171 --> 00:28:43,330
You know, it's like starting
your year as a fat fuck.

486
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:47,530
Who's got dropped like fucking 20,
30, 40, 50, a hundred fucking pounds.

487
00:28:47,531 --> 00:28:51,280
It's the worst. Why not get started
now and not do the fucking damage?

488
00:28:51,281 --> 00:28:54,820
You know what I mean? You know, that
awesome feeling you get, you know,

489
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,230
okay,

490
00:28:56,230 --> 00:29:00,220
if before you go to work, you make the
bed and you come home and the bed's made,

491
00:29:00,221 --> 00:29:01,300
you know,
that fucking feeling.

492
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:04,780
Or maybe the night before you did all
the dishes and you wake up to make

493
00:29:04,781 --> 00:29:07,300
breakfast and there's no dishes
from the night before that, that,

494
00:29:07,301 --> 00:29:10,900
that ahead of the game feeling,
you know, or at least I'm even,

495
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:12,251
you know what I mean?
Like,

496
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:15,730
I don't get to start my day
doing yesterday's bullshit
plus whatever the fuck

497
00:29:15,731 --> 00:29:17,800
hits me today.
Um,

498
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:22,090
that's what it's like to be on
January 1st to actually be in shape.

499
00:29:22,091 --> 00:29:26,590
And I don't think I've, I've
done that since my twenties, so,

500
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,453
um,

501
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:28,570
okay.

502
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:30,220
I'm really gonna try and,
uh,

503
00:29:30,221 --> 00:29:33,190
it always helps me to announce it on the
podcast and I'm going to fucking do it

504
00:29:33,191 --> 00:29:35,560
because I know you guys will fucking,

505
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,320
you guys are going to check in on me
and you're going to give me shit when I,

506
00:29:38,321 --> 00:29:42,040
you know, if I'm not talking about it,
you know, I'm not doing well and God

507
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,750
knows you guys like to be mean,

508
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:47,380
but I probably deserve it after what
a cunt I was to that lady last night.

509
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:50,620
I wasn't even a cunt.
It's just the fact that she's a woman.

510
00:29:50,621 --> 00:29:53,020
You need just supposed to,
you know, you're just supposed
to let him win. Be Like,

511
00:29:53,021 --> 00:29:55,720
oh wow. Wow. Yeah. You,
you, you and you. Yeah,

512
00:29:55,721 --> 00:29:59,710
that's exactly what the joke was
about was all about you. All of you.

513
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:03,700
Why not talk about all of you?
Your so interesting.

514
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:08,701
Please tell me another story about your
Damn Day and what you said and all my

515
00:30:10,361 --> 00:30:15,070
God, what you were like. So I
said this and then she said that,

516
00:30:15,071 --> 00:30:16,240
and then I was like,

517
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,013
okay

518
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:20,730
ladies, how do you not see the pain in
your man's face when you're doing that?

519
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,360
You know what I mean?

520
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:25,140
I see the pain in my wife's face when I
tried to talk to her about a game, man,

521
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:29,510
it was fucking two minutes left, right?
Patriots or getting killed on defense.

522
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,100
Right. We get the ball back.
Tom Brady throws the ball.

523
00:30:32,101 --> 00:30:36,360
Giant guy grabbed any fucking lands on
his stomach, not just window. By then,

524
00:30:36,361 --> 00:30:40,770
it's just fucking over. She just
starts making fun of me. Really?

525
00:30:40,771 --> 00:30:44,430
Oh my God. That's amazing. Just
give a fuck. You know what?

526
00:30:44,431 --> 00:30:48,370
If I don't listen to her fucking stories,
oh Jesus. Oh, forget about it. To be,

527
00:30:48,371 --> 00:30:53,310
it's a big Goddamn, I don't
know what it is. Um, anyways,

528
00:30:53,311 --> 00:30:57,660
let's get to some of the reads for
this week. Okay? Yeah. Bell, it's fine.

529
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:00,060
It's absolutely fine.
All I'm doing the comedy jam tonight

530
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:02,970
are right with the fucking,

531
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,060
yeah,

532
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:09,290
the fucking text message is there.
Um, let's read the text message.

533
00:31:09,291 --> 00:31:11,210
I was that somebody else
who saw the F is for family.

534
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:13,363
Okay.

535
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:18,300
Yeah, I saw the trail. People are like
in the trailer. Thank Christ. All right.

536
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:21,350
Uh, venue dear Billy, big shot.

537
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:22,230
Okay.

538
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:25,620
Now that you've done the
mother of all venues with Msg,

539
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:28,620
what non traditional venue
would you like to play?

540
00:31:28,621 --> 00:31:32,630
Like something like the Great Wall of
China. Congrats on your year ago. Fuck

541
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:36,500
yourself. Um, no, there's still a,

542
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:38,330
there's still a bunch
that I would love to play.

543
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:41,870
A Royal Albert Hall is on my bucket list.

544
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:46,960
Um, and, but then there's also,

545
00:31:46,961 --> 00:31:51,010
there's a bunch of theaters that I would
still like to play or continue playing.

546
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:54,220
There's the one on out here
in California in Long Beach.

547
00:31:54,221 --> 00:31:58,290
So Long Beach something or other
where Richard Pryor did his, uh,

548
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,210
live in concert.
Um,

549
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,120
I already did a show at the palladium.

550
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:07,830
That's where he did live on the
sunset strip. And I forget if the,

551
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:12,040
the one that he performed at when he did
his here and now, which I think was in,

552
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:15,970
uh, New Orleans. I got to see
if that one's still exists.

553
00:32:15,971 --> 00:32:18,340
But I really,
uh,

554
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,810
I like doing those old theaters.
I like doing a man.

555
00:32:20,811 --> 00:32:23,600
It's like going to old ballparks and
you hear all the people that were there

556
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:24,890
like last night when we were

557
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:28,560
down the, um, the comedy
store, this is just

558
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:32,170
characters just show up,
right? Dick Gregory's onstage.

559
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:35,090
And then this other guy comes
in cause he knew Dick Gregory.

560
00:32:35,091 --> 00:32:40,040
He was the publicist for Ciro's. There
was this nightclub. I said it became a,

561
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:44,030
the comedy store. And uh,
you know, when Frank Dean,

562
00:32:44,031 --> 00:32:46,010
Sammy and all of them were down there,

563
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:49,460
he was just naming all of these
fucking names. He said, hey, he goes,

564
00:32:49,461 --> 00:32:54,110
I first came here in 1950 so immediately
doing the math going, Jesus Christ,

565
00:32:54,111 --> 00:32:59,060
if this guy was like 20 in 1950,
that's 65 fucking years ago.

566
00:32:59,061 --> 00:33:04,040
He's 85. He didn't look like it was in
his eighties. He actually looked great.

567
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:08,720
But, um, so let's see what
venue. You know, red rocks.

568
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:14,270
I performed there though, but I, I
did, I did red rocks when it was, uh,

569
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:18,710
there was some sort of animation
thing going on after it.

570
00:33:18,711 --> 00:33:23,390
So when do you get the comic comedy works?
Uh,

571
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:27,080
got me the Gig and we went out there,

572
00:33:27,081 --> 00:33:30,650
but it was cool to be at red rocks,
but uh, they weren't there for me.

573
00:33:30,651 --> 00:33:35,420
They were there for the fucking film.
So there was a lot of chatter. But um,

574
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:36,780
okay.

575
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:41,340
A lot of the things on my
bucket list are venues that, um,

576
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:47,470
that either bands played in that I love
and had some live album there or as

577
00:33:47,471 --> 00:33:50,380
comedians that did a, uh, special there.

578
00:33:50,381 --> 00:33:54,820
So I told you when I was in hammer town,
they're up in fucking, uh, Toronto,

579
00:33:54,821 --> 00:33:58,260
Ontario. I mean, I know
Ontario and it's Toronto. Um,

580
00:33:59,220 --> 00:33:59,700
okay.

581
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,060
They just kept calling a hammer town.
I can't remember the name of the town,

582
00:34:02,061 --> 00:34:06,350
but it's south of Toronto.
I didn't realize I performed
until after I was there.

583
00:34:06,351 --> 00:34:10,810
I performed at the theater were bill
Cosby did bill Cosby himself. Um,

584
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:15,620
arguably the greatest special of all time,
you know, now what he did afterwards.

585
00:34:15,621 --> 00:34:20,370
I don't want to get involved in that.
Um,

586
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:23,080
so that was cool.
Um,

587
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,090
okay.

588
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:26,330
I did a,

589
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:31,770
yeah, that's a great question. I
don't know. I just want to keep going.

590
00:34:31,771 --> 00:34:33,570
I liked going to venues
that I'd never been to.

591
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:36,360
You know what I really enjoyed this
year was when I was doing the tour of

592
00:34:36,361 --> 00:34:41,361
California going to Reno and Bakersfield
and Fresno and they were along the old

593
00:34:42,481 --> 00:34:44,850
school highways where
people were site too,

594
00:34:44,851 --> 00:34:46,840
like the highway went
right down main street.

595
00:34:46,841 --> 00:34:50,160
So they would have some big fancy sign,
you know,

596
00:34:50,161 --> 00:34:55,110
Reno biggest little's town and
uh, you know, the West Fresno,

597
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:57,750
you know, whatever the fuck
their slogan is. You know,

598
00:34:57,751 --> 00:35:00,870
they would always have like town and then
some sort of slogan Bakersfield, like,

599
00:35:00,871 --> 00:35:05,370
Hey, stop and stay awhile, you
know, some corny shit. But um,

600
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:06,370
okay,

601
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:09,820
I really liked that route.
66 type of stuff. And uh,

602
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:14,980
as far as Europe goes, that's to me is
all about world war two, World War One,

603
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:21,620
those, you know, those types of
places. But as far as performing,

604
00:35:21,621 --> 00:35:25,790
I don't know enough about Europe and
that type of thing. Uh, I did look up,

605
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:30,080
you know, Ac DC where they recorded a,
if you want blood, their live album,

606
00:35:30,081 --> 00:35:35,030
that was a place, I believe it
was in Glasgow or Edinburgh,
I want to say Glasgow,

607
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:39,540
but, uh, the venue
doesn't anymore. So, um,

608
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:40,920
yeah,

609
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,920
so that I would say that I get a big
charge out of a music place cause I'm a

610
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:47,940
total nerd when it comes to that shit.
And, uh, I remember when I was in England,

611
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:53,720
London a couple of years ago accidentally
coming upon that Ronnie Scott's and I

612
00:35:53,791 --> 00:35:57,270
saw Jeff Beck have one of
the great fucking was him,

613
00:35:57,271 --> 00:36:01,080
Vinny Coley Uda and that chicken base.
And they just will fucking unbelievable.

614
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:06,270
Like Jimmy page was in the
crowd, you know, sinking down
in his seat. Like, Oh yeah,

615
00:36:06,271 --> 00:36:09,480
I stole that riff on, it was still on that
one from him and nick in it, I believe,

616
00:36:09,481 --> 00:36:13,740
as they call it. So yeah, there's
still plenty left. And, um,

617
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:19,160
the MSG for me was not as much
as it was a high watermark.

618
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:23,580
It wasn't like this, you know, and
now I just slide down the back nine.

619
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:24,840
For me it was,
uh,

620
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:30,180
it just felt more like an honor to be
there and it was mine for an hour and a

621
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:30,871
half. And then, you know,

622
00:36:30,871 --> 00:36:33,870
the second you leave somebody else's name
was on the marquee and it's like, wow,

623
00:36:33,871 --> 00:36:38,610
I got to do that. Um, but I got to
tell you, I had just as much fun,

624
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:39,923
uh,

625
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,970
fucking around with the new stuff.
You know,

626
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:48,250
it's hard to describe unless
you're a comedian. The
excitement of new stuff. Like,

627
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,600
Oh,
I get to say new shit.

628
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:53,020
I have to keep saying this stuff and
trying to figure out how to make this

629
00:36:53,021 --> 00:36:55,750
fucking new again tonight.
Um,

630
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:59,260
so anyways,
so yeah,

631
00:36:59,261 --> 00:37:01,810
I would say I've Royal Albert Hall is
like the next one I'm really thinking

632
00:37:01,811 --> 00:37:02,051
about,

633
00:37:02,051 --> 00:37:05,410
but there's no way there was in something
in Ireland or something in Scotland or,

634
00:37:05,411 --> 00:37:09,580
uh, Finland, Norway. I mean, I
think I'm doing a tour of the, uh,

635
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:13,710
the fucking, um, eastern Europe.

636
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:20,090
Be Crazy to play a venue that like fucking
like Hitler or Stalin or Mussolini,

637
00:37:20,131 --> 00:37:22,470
one of those fascists.
When now I get stolen wasn't a fascist,

638
00:37:22,471 --> 00:37:26,850
but one of those fucking maniacs gave his
speech and you know, it's still exists,

639
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:32,760
you know, fucking nuts, right?
I Dunno. Alright. Baking.

640
00:37:32,761 --> 00:37:36,840
Hey, Bill. Uh, Bacon Bill.

641
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:40,890
I'm thinking about surprising
my girlfriend and her
family by bringing over a

642
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:43,830
homemade pie for thanksgiving.
All right, dude. I got you.

643
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:47,220
I'm going to make two pies
because one isn't enough.

644
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:50,610
I'm thinking about apple and
Pumpkin also because also,

645
00:37:50,611 --> 00:37:55,611
please know that apple capitalizes apple
as if there's no such thing is fruit.

646
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:01,560
Oh, the apple company.
Anyways, I know, uh,

647
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:05,610
from previous years that you're
killing it in the kitchen.

648
00:38:05,611 --> 00:38:10,170
I'll thank you before I called my mom
and her two s and get her 2 cents, uh,

649
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:15,180
from Youcan, I get some pointers,
some basic do's and don'ts, uh,

650
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:20,190
when getting into it, should I
avoid either apple, the fruit,

651
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:23,700
uh, or Pumpkin? Thanks. Um,

652
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,440
Pumpkin pies and an easy recipe.
Apple pies work as far as the filling,

653
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:32,410
but it's also fucking, now it's apples
and cinnamon. Man. I mean, come on. Um,

654
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:37,780
I'll give you the biggest, like the
filling is the, is easy. All right. The,

655
00:38:37,781 --> 00:38:42,220
the thing that scares and
intimidates people is doing the, uh,

656
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:45,580
oh my God guys, do I have to make
a fucking pie crust making video?

657
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,040
I'll fucking do it.
I'll put on the apron.

658
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,310
I'll put on the apron and a silly hat.
You want the,

659
00:38:51,311 --> 00:38:54,070
I'll do that for you for fucking
thanksgiving. How about that?

660
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:58,810
I will make a fucking pie video,
um,

661
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:02,110
pie crust video.
Uh,

662
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:06,640
but if you're going to do it right now,
because I won't get the video up in time,

663
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:11,470
I will show, I will show you. Uh, I'll
try to walk you through it. All right,

664
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:17,410
so the recipe that I use,
it's two cups of all purpose flour.

665
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,370
The kinds that people say, you know,
you're gonna die if you eat it.

666
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,420
That's what you want with the pie.
You don't want to go any low fat.

667
00:39:25,421 --> 00:39:29,170
You don't want to go wheat. You don't want
to do any of that fucking stinky feet,

668
00:39:29,171 --> 00:39:32,080
Seattle thing of with it.
All right? You want to go?

669
00:39:32,081 --> 00:39:35,590
Midwest Chicago heart attack.
All right? You're making a pie.

670
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:39,250
You want to be healthy? Go have a fucking
salad. That's not what we're doing here.

671
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,500
That's not what stock you're crying,

672
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:46,660
right?
And it's funny.

673
00:39:46,661 --> 00:39:49,840
There's roofers fixing something on my
fucking roof that's never going to be

674
00:39:49,841 --> 00:39:51,910
fixed.
And they probably just heard me yelled at,

675
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:55,180
now stop your crying and get
out of my kitchen. You know,

676
00:39:56,430 --> 00:40:00,040
that's how rumors start. I know that
guy. That guy tells jokes. Yeah,

677
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:04,200
he's fucking verbally abusive
to his wife. Um, anyway,

678
00:40:04,201 --> 00:40:07,420
so what you want to do is you
add two cups of flour, okay?

679
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:10,570
And you get yourself a sifter,
right?

680
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:13,930
And there's always a little bit of salt.
Go easy on the salt,

681
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:17,500
like an eighth of a teaspoon. So what I
do is I take the cup of fucking flower,

682
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,970
I poured into the sifter.

683
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:22,120
The sifter is sitting in the bowl
that you're going to sift into.

684
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:25,000
Don't just pour it into the sifter and
it's going to end up on your counter.

685
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:28,810
You don't want that, right?
So you're pouring one cup,

686
00:40:28,811 --> 00:40:31,750
then you put in your salt and you put
your next cup over it. Then you sit there,

687
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:37,930
right? It comes fucking out. Then a,
and then you add you shortening, right?

688
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:40,840
I use a stick of butter.
Sorry.

689
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,010
You want it to be cold so it's
not too fucking mushy. Uh,

690
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:47,860
take it out of the fridge. You
just cut it up and like, you know,

691
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,840
eighth of an inch slices,

692
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:52,810
you put it in there and then with your
little fucking thing that you hit. See,

693
00:40:52,811 --> 00:40:55,660
this is why I'm gonna to do a video.
You just, you want to cover it, right?

694
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,650
And then you put your shortening
it and then cover that.

695
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:01,610
You want it to be all like, uh,
like you make an a fucking meatball.

696
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:03,970
You want to get the bread crumbs
all over except it's the flower.

697
00:41:03,971 --> 00:41:07,420
And then when you do that,
you just lightly tap all the way around.

698
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,260
You know, he let in that
shortening sat kind of get into it.

699
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:13,360
Then you go a little harder,
a little harder,

700
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,270
gets a little mealy once it's a little
mealy, he started adding your water.

701
00:41:16,271 --> 00:41:17,230
I got to make a video,

702
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:22,660
I got to make a video and I can also show
you how much you can fuck up acrossed

703
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:27,760
and still save it. And uh,
uh, you know what, I gotta
do it. I'll actually do that.

704
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,760
But as far, listen man,
pumpkin pie is great,

705
00:41:30,761 --> 00:41:34,160
but if you want to knock people on
their ass, you got to make an apple pie.

706
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:38,160
And I'd get three different
types of apples. Uh,

707
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:41,180
throw a granny Smith in there so you got
a bitter thing and then something else

708
00:41:41,181 --> 00:41:43,190
for a little sweeter taste.
You know,

709
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:45,690
little surf and turf
going on in there and a,

710
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:48,800
you just make sure you use enough
cinnamon. You know what I mean?

711
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:52,560
I use about a half a
healthy half a teaspoon.

712
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:56,840
What has happened to me? I'm literally
just sitting here talking about this shit.

713
00:41:56,841 --> 00:41:57,880
Like I'm about right.
Like it's,

714
00:41:57,881 --> 00:42:02,510
this is a fucking game plan to win
the fucking football game tonight.

715
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:06,800
Um, all right. So
anyways, holiday wedding,

716
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:12,080
uh, Billy bell's, my friend
from college is getting married,

717
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:16,270
uh, the Sunday after Christmas. Oh, Jesus.

718
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:20,480
What a stupid time to do that was because
everybody's in your hometown. He goes,

719
00:42:20,481 --> 00:42:22,600
is there a worst time for a wedding now?

720
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:25,740
Can you believe that it's in
upstate New York? Of course I can.

721
00:42:25,741 --> 00:42:28,170
If he's going to be a [inaudible],
he's got to go all the way with it.

722
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:30,960
I'm sure it'd be fun once I got there,

723
00:42:30,961 --> 00:42:35,220
but I'm thinking about skipping the
circumstances are grounds for not going

724
00:42:35,221 --> 00:42:37,530
right. Absolutely they are. Fuck

725
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:40,090
that.
Fuck that.

726
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:44,670
You know what I mean? I always think that
when people do shit like that anyways,

727
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:48,990
it means one of two things that kind of
hope and most people won't show up or

728
00:42:48,991 --> 00:42:52,110
two, they don't have enough money
to throw a good wedding anyway,

729
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:54,180
so all that great food.

730
00:42:54,181 --> 00:42:59,181
You're going to walk away from that to
go up there and fucking eat hamburger

731
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:03,390
helper, you know,
standing out on the stage,

732
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,460
eating the fucking dance
floor, eating a steak, um,

733
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:12,910
gray, good tags, Calla Bu
du, Du, Du, Du, Du, Du, Du,

734
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:13,440
and you don't want,

735
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,050
your friends is going to cancel last
second that agreed to go and you're going

736
00:43:17,051 --> 00:43:18,180
to fucking show up day.

737
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,030
There's some shit food being served.
Ride here now.

738
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:28,830
Some fucking shitty food. It's going
to come out. Chairs. Yeah. Fuck that.

739
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:29,910
Yeah.

740
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:31,650
Fuck that.
And he can never give you shit.

741
00:43:31,651 --> 00:43:35,520
All you gotta do for the rest of your
life when he gives you shit or she gives

742
00:43:35,521 --> 00:43:38,700
you shit or whatever about
not going, just, you just,

743
00:43:38,701 --> 00:43:42,210
you don't use you sitting at the bar
and they're fucking [inaudible] man,

744
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:43,350
you're fucking ear.
You don't,

745
00:43:43,351 --> 00:43:47,310
you just keep looking straight ahead
and he just put throw your hands out and

746
00:43:47,311 --> 00:43:51,840
you just go. You got married
on the Sunday after Christmas.

747
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:52,600
Yeah.

748
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,880
Who does that?
That's it.

749
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:55,690
Yeah.

750
00:43:55,690 --> 00:43:59,590
And as they try to defend it.
You just talk over married

751
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:03,850
the Sunday after Chris,
when?

752
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:07,090
The Sunday after Christmas.

753
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:13,450
It's almost like he didn't want me
to be there. If you get divorced,

754
00:44:13,451 --> 00:44:16,150
when are you going to get married
this time? Fucking New Year's Day.

755
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:18,250
The Fuck Outta here.

756
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:19,670
Okay.

757
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:24,200
What do you think you're better than Santa
Claus? You better than the baby Jesus.

758
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:28,070
Huh? You think you're better
than the prime rip my mother
makes on Christmas Day.

759
00:44:28,071 --> 00:44:29,000
You mother fucker.

760
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:32,090
Where the fuck do you get

761
00:44:32,090 --> 00:44:34,290
an upstate New York?
How dare you?

762
00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:38,490
I want to be that fucking person
driving in his station wagon

763
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:44,970
fucking Sunday after critic.
Get to fight this.

764
00:44:44,971 --> 00:44:49,290
This is like my time off. This
is my time. All this is my time.

765
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:53,910
Okay, I'm going to go to
a God damn wedding. Oh,

766
00:44:53,911 --> 00:44:58,410
that just reeks of like my friend got
ordained as a fucking preacher and he's

767
00:44:58,411 --> 00:45:02,400
going to go up there and his
fucking street clothes. Oh yeah.

768
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:07,830
I bet they get married and like the
basement of a fucking holiday inn and the

769
00:45:07,831 --> 00:45:10,520
ceremony is going to be going in
the door to the function room,

770
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:13,680
still going to be open to people and
we randomly walking by looking at it,

771
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:14,970
you know,

772
00:45:14,970 --> 00:45:18,180
they got to keep the door open because
there's no bathroom in the function room.

773
00:45:18,181 --> 00:45:23,130
See, you gotta walk out. Oh, that's
a shit show. Jesus Christ. It was,

774
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:27,740
that's like a, it's like a sales
meeting. You don't want to go to, well,

775
00:45:27,741 --> 00:45:30,290
you know what?
I've convinced myself that I wouldn't go.

776
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:33,710
I don't know what you're thinking,
but I wouldn't go.

777
00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:37,670
That's totally grounds for skipping a
wedding alone is grounds for skipping.

778
00:45:37,671 --> 00:45:40,490
Who the fuck wants to go to that?
Unless you're still in your 20s,

779
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:44,570
you know, then it's a good time. You
want to go to a wedding single, right?

780
00:45:44,571 --> 00:45:46,550
Go there. Maybe bank, somebody's right.

781
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:50,120
Have a good time to go there.
You know?

782
00:45:50,121 --> 00:45:53,530
If you're not married then eventually
she's going to look. Oh wait, wait.

783
00:45:53,531 --> 00:45:56,490
Dad I did is,
uh,

784
00:45:58,190 --> 00:46:00,460
when you think of it, just
fucking running, doing a running

785
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,810
jump right off the
balcony. All right. Sleep,

786
00:46:02,811 --> 00:46:07,550
trouble sleeping trouble.
All right. I hate bell.

787
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:10,970
I just started traveling for work and
getting a good nights and getting a good

788
00:46:10,971 --> 00:46:12,860
night's sleep is brutal.
Yes it is.

789
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:16,760
I'm not trying ambien or
increasing my alcohol intake.

790
00:46:17,330 --> 00:46:20,630
How do you deal with all
the travel, uh, alcohol? Uh,

791
00:46:20,631 --> 00:46:25,190
do you use a one of those
stupid neck pillows? Nope.

792
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:30,200
Hotel beds aren't bad if I do sleep well,
I end up waking up feeling comatose,

793
00:46:30,201 --> 00:46:34,220
which leads me to being more tired
cause those beds are huge and soft and I

794
00:46:34,221 --> 00:46:35,210
don't want to get out of bed.

795
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,940
You're also making up for the sleep
that you didn't get on other nights,

796
00:46:37,941 --> 00:46:41,870
which you can't really do. You know,
there's that weird thing that a flake say,

797
00:46:41,871 --> 00:46:45,980
you know, you got six hours one night
and then 10 hours the next night. So

798
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:50,160
you got, you know, it
averages out to eight hours.

799
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:54,660
It still doesn't work that way for some
reason. Um, you can't retroactively,

800
00:46:54,661 --> 00:46:58,980
like when you miss out on whatever it
is you need. Some people only need six,

801
00:46:58,981 --> 00:47:02,310
some people just need four. But if you
need like whatever the fuck you need,

802
00:47:02,311 --> 00:47:03,690
I'm saying if you come up short,

803
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:08,160
you can't just sleep extra
one day and then even it off.

804
00:47:08,161 --> 00:47:11,010
It usually takes like a week. Like I've
been fucking sleep in this whole week.

805
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:16,230
I'm falling asleep like an old person.
So, um, but anyways, let me continue.

806
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:17,633
Um,

807
00:47:17,650 --> 00:47:20,360
and I don't want to get out of the
bed. It has, it hasn't happened yet,

808
00:47:20,361 --> 00:47:24,770
but I can see it's slowly turning me
into a grouchy asshole. How do you do it?

809
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:27,530
Well, you are cheery fellow
before hitting the road.

810
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:34,660
Thanks for the free labs. Um,
how do I do it? I'm German.

811
00:47:34,661 --> 00:47:39,660
Irish. That's how I do it. Um, we're
not in touch with our feelings,

812
00:47:39,661 --> 00:47:40,840
so even if I am tired,

813
00:47:40,841 --> 00:47:45,310
I'm just naturally trained to
block it out and I just get up and,

814
00:47:45,311 --> 00:47:48,040
um, then I go. But however,

815
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:53,070
every once in a while when I do make a
conscious effort to think about slowing

816
00:47:54,071 --> 00:47:58,120
down and relaxing and not having
something to achieve every fucking day,

817
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:02,590
be it picking up dry cleaning
or writing a new joke, um,

818
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:07,930
I suddenly become aware
of how tired I am. So, um,

819
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:13,390
what I would do is, yeah, it's not,
not, uh, not use any of the drugs.

820
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:17,680
And I also wouldn't fuck with alcohol.
I wouldn't do that either.

821
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:22,120
What I would do is workout in the
morning and then go to your job,

822
00:48:22,121 --> 00:48:23,770
whatever it is that you do.
And then at night,

823
00:48:23,771 --> 00:48:27,910
because you were working all day and you
worked out, you'll actually go to sleep.

824
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:33,040
If you just get into the good habits
out there, it's not that bad. But,

825
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:37,120
um, I dunno, biggest thing
that I found him, he sees food.

826
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:41,530
Food is difficult. And uh, if you're
doing like a bunch of one nighters,

827
00:48:41,531 --> 00:48:43,750
if you like a traveling
salesman kind of fucking thing,

828
00:48:43,810 --> 00:48:45,250
selling your widgets or whatever,

829
00:48:45,550 --> 00:48:49,090
that's when it gets hard because you
spend your day traveling and then you

830
00:48:49,091 --> 00:48:52,720
arrive at the hotel, you fucking
hungry. But you got to go to your Gig.

831
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:55,030
So you usually end up,
you know,

832
00:48:56,190 --> 00:49:00,930
did you guys get to have anything healthy
way? We got an apple base. Oh yeah.

833
00:49:00,931 --> 00:49:05,790
Do they deliver and you they, yeah,
he sure don't. They sure don't.

834
00:49:06,270 --> 00:49:06,700
Yeah.

835
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:08,680
Nodding yes.
They sure dope.

836
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:10,920
Yeah.

837
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,390
You should shake your head.
No.

838
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:14,040
Okay.

839
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:18,090
Can I get what I need? You
sure can't. Not In this town.

840
00:49:19,470 --> 00:49:20,303
So then you,

841
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:23,700
then they always have like fucking menus
and they're always going to give you

842
00:49:23,701 --> 00:49:27,120
some Chinese food,
which is just,

843
00:49:27,210 --> 00:49:32,210
is going to be unfucking believable
or absolutely horrific depending on,

844
00:49:32,390 --> 00:49:33,180
uh,
you know,

845
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:38,180
it has nothing to do with where you're
at every fucking town in the United

846
00:49:39,330 --> 00:49:41,400
States as Chinese food,
I believe.

847
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:46,800
And every town has a Chinese
family that moved there, right.

848
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:49,370
For the most part,
or at least within two towns,

849
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:53,400
is a Chinese family that moved there and
they will make that fucking food. Now,

850
00:49:54,030 --> 00:49:57,780
whether or not they're people
from China that know how to cook,

851
00:49:57,781 --> 00:49:59,040
that's the fucking rub.

852
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:00,720
Okay.

853
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:01,560
You know,
you never know.

854
00:50:01,561 --> 00:50:04,350
Even set and get five and in
the middle of fucking Kansas.

855
00:50:06,050 --> 00:50:08,810
And I got some of the best Sushi
I've ever had. Japanese family,

856
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:12,080
middle of fucking Kansas. It's
like, how did you end up out here?

857
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:13,760
Yeah.

858
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:17,000
Does unbelief. I, I, most of the white
people I know didn't end up out of here.

859
00:50:17,001 --> 00:50:18,050
How did you,
uh,

860
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:23,080
from Japan end up in
a lazy fucking Kansas.

861
00:50:25,670 --> 00:50:28,070
Oh, speaking of bucket
list, I have like a bunch

862
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:31,850
of college basketball games I want
to go to. I want to go to Kentucky.

863
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:37,190
I've always been a Kansas Fan. I
don't know why I want to go to their,

864
00:50:37,191 --> 00:50:38,090
their facility.

865
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:43,420
I want to go to a Duke Carolina
game at Carolina and at Duke.

866
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:48,510
Um,
can I have been to UCLA?

867
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:55,000
Who else has a big basketball
program? Georgetown. Syracuse.

868
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:57,400
You know the red men,

869
00:50:58,110 --> 00:51:00,910
Saint John's Redmen one of the
fuck they called now the red storm.

870
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:06,280
I grew up on big east basketball, but uh,
I used to love watching all that shit.

871
00:51:06,281 --> 00:51:09,960
So I've been to Indiana. I told you
guys I went to Indiana University, uh,

872
00:51:10,570 --> 00:51:13,900
university basketball game with Bobby
Knight was still on the team. I was,

873
00:51:13,930 --> 00:51:17,290
I could not fucking believe the level
of which set guy was screaming at his

874
00:51:17,291 --> 00:51:19,390
players was insane.

875
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:22,510
Come in all the way on his fucking head.

876
00:51:22,511 --> 00:51:26,680
Just snapping is a point that they let
up an easy bucket in the point guard was

877
00:51:26,681 --> 00:51:28,930
bringing it up the court and
the fucking guy, I swear to God,

878
00:51:28,931 --> 00:51:30,670
he walked like 10 feet out into the court.

879
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:34,690
Everybody was just like intimidated
by him. I just say, just annoyed me.

880
00:51:34,691 --> 00:51:37,810
I wanted to see like somebody
stand up to him, you know,

881
00:51:38,770 --> 00:51:43,240
give the guy next verbal fucking
slap. But it never happened. That guy,

882
00:51:43,241 --> 00:51:47,340
classic example, Eagle completely
out of fucking control. Um,

883
00:51:48,790 --> 00:51:51,580
when he started buying into being Bobby
Knight and he started doing those,

884
00:51:51,581 --> 00:51:55,240
I'm going to be Bobby Knight. You
know, what is, what is a game face.

885
00:51:55,241 --> 00:52:00,130
I never understood that. And he starts
mugging to the camera or when he goes, uh,

886
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,440
you know, I, boy my credits bury me.

887
00:52:02,441 --> 00:52:07,330
They bury me face down so they
can kiss my ass. I was like,

888
00:52:07,331 --> 00:52:11,060
Oh God, shut up. I have another drink. Um,

889
00:52:11,730 --> 00:52:16,030
I just make fun of Bobby Knight. What it,
what the fuck is wrong with me? Um, yeah.

890
00:52:16,031 --> 00:52:19,750
So I'm doing the goddamn
comedy jam tonight at the, uh,

891
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:24,900
if leaves the lyric theater
on a [inaudible] and I'm
looking forward to doing

892
00:52:26,411 --> 00:52:28,600
that. I got, yeah. You don't want to
tell you guys I've got nothing else.

893
00:52:28,630 --> 00:52:30,070
I can't even do a fucking hour.
That's,

894
00:52:30,071 --> 00:52:34,030
that's how little I've been doing this
week. I got caught up on peaky blinders,

895
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:38,730
peaky blinders. I don't know
nothing about no robbery, um,

896
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:43,780
peaky blinders with
subtitles, uh, um, up to the,

897
00:52:43,781 --> 00:52:47,860
a first episode of season two. So I'm
going to blow through that this week.

898
00:52:48,310 --> 00:52:52,780
And then my wife is watching bloodline, I
believe that's the name of it, with, uh,

899
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:57,470
Norbert Leo Butz, who I did a failed
pilot with a long time ago. And, uh,

900
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:01,630
he's a fucking great guy and I keep
walking in there and he's absolutely

901
00:53:01,631 --> 00:53:04,950
crushing every scene. And, uh, so I,

902
00:53:04,951 --> 00:53:09,490
I got to watch it out of
solidarity. Um, we actually,

903
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:14,620
a long time ago did a fucking pilot. Did
I ever tell you guys this fucking story?

904
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:20,230
We did a pilot and they wanted edgy.
All right.

905
00:53:20,830 --> 00:53:23,170
I thought I told you guys this
one, whatever. Who gives a fuck?

906
00:53:25,590 --> 00:53:29,520
They wanted edgy. Okay. It was, you know,

907
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:34,440
and they will let us go
really far. And the, uh,

908
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:40,830
the pilot name was playing chicken
was the name of this pilot.

909
00:53:40,890 --> 00:53:42,930
And the premise was,
um,

910
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:45,930
me and Norbert were brothers,

911
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:51,260
he was Republican and I was Democrat and
Norbert's character was paralyzed from

912
00:53:52,891 --> 00:53:57,891
the waist down and he was
paralyzed because he was
playing chicken on a fucking

913
00:53:58,831 --> 00:54:03,030
jet ski and neither person
turned away and he got paralyzed.

914
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:06,450
So that's what's the name of it.
So that's already the fucking premise.

915
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:10,930
So he was like over the top fuck homeless
people and all that Shit. So anyway,

916
00:54:10,931 --> 00:54:14,430
so we're doing, you know, whatever,

917
00:54:14,431 --> 00:54:18,630
they write this edgy fucking pilot and um,

918
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:23,100
right as we're about ready to do the
fucking run through where all the fucking

919
00:54:23,101 --> 00:54:27,210
major network guys come down. And
it's basically you do, it's basically,

920
00:54:27,211 --> 00:54:31,520
it's like a live play. All right,
let me just give you a little packet.

921
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:33,540
Basically what happens
is if you're on a sitcom,

922
00:54:33,541 --> 00:54:37,680
you have the table read on
Monday, right? If it kills,

923
00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:41,550
you go upstairs and you do a bunch of
blocking in the fake living rooms and all

924
00:54:41,551 --> 00:54:44,100
that, which is basically, I'm going
to stand over here when I do this.

925
00:54:44,101 --> 00:54:45,270
You go through the whole fucking thing.

926
00:54:45,570 --> 00:54:49,380
If it bombs and they know that they're
going to rewrite a lot of shit,

927
00:54:49,381 --> 00:54:50,760
you have a quick fucking day like,

928
00:54:50,761 --> 00:54:53,530
well we're going to get a new script
tonight and this'll be, you know,

929
00:54:53,550 --> 00:54:57,540
a little bit different. So then Tuesday
comes around, you fucking rehearse it,

930
00:54:57,810 --> 00:54:59,400
you still got your script in hand,

931
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,860
and then you do a run through and it's
just for the, uh, the production company,

932
00:55:05,130 --> 00:55:09,360
like the, whoever's making the thing.
So it's, that's friendly fire there,

933
00:55:10,230 --> 00:55:13,200
you know, those are like the executive
producers and the people that wrote it,

934
00:55:13,201 --> 00:55:17,340
the writers and all that. So they
watch it and they see what's working,

935
00:55:17,341 --> 00:55:19,850
what isn't, what needs to be
fixed, what can stay the same,

936
00:55:19,870 --> 00:55:24,720
what they can add on to. And then
Wednesday is the network run through.

937
00:55:24,721 --> 00:55:29,040
And that's when the people that can
cancel your fucking show show up and leave

938
00:55:29,041 --> 00:55:30,990
their sense of humor. At
the fucking door. Right.

939
00:55:30,991 --> 00:55:32,850
So that's always a nerve
wracking fucking day.

940
00:55:32,851 --> 00:55:36,480
And you go out there and if you do a
couple lines, they don't get laughs.

941
00:55:36,481 --> 00:55:40,110
You start getting in your head like
you're going to get fired. You know,

942
00:55:40,650 --> 00:55:44,310
and as you're walking from one fake
living room to the fake bar or a coffee

943
00:55:44,311 --> 00:55:45,270
house that you hang out,

944
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:50,420
the only sound you hear is the shoes of
the fucking executives walking over to

945
00:55:50,491 --> 00:55:54,580
the next fucking the next scene.
So anyway,

946
00:55:54,581 --> 00:55:57,900
so we're doing this fucking
pilot and the opening scene is,

947
00:55:57,901 --> 00:56:02,880
we're sitting there at some ice cream
place eating ice cream and this homeless

948
00:56:02,881 --> 00:56:03,541
guy,
whatever.

949
00:56:03,541 --> 00:56:07,320
We're having a back and forth and this
homeless guy comes up and asks for money.

950
00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:12,890
So I of course being the liberal go to
give some money and Norbert's character

951
00:56:12,901 --> 00:56:17,880
being the conservative guy, you know,
basically tells the guy to fuck off.

952
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:23,560
So everybody's loving it. He actually,
I remember flicked ice cream at him.

953
00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:27,670
Oh he decided he was going to do that
during the fucking run through cause we

954
00:56:27,671 --> 00:56:29,410
weren't going to do it all day long.
Flick and ice cream.

955
00:56:29,411 --> 00:56:33,130
And I'd be a fucking mess. So he just
kept miming flicking the ice cream.

956
00:56:33,131 --> 00:56:36,880
That's what it was.
So anyways,

957
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:40,420
people are digging the pilot, you know,
the producers and all the writers,

958
00:56:40,421 --> 00:56:42,130
they're all thinking it's funny,
they're laughing it up.

959
00:56:42,130 --> 00:56:43,840
We do the regular run
through what's going great.

960
00:56:43,841 --> 00:56:46,450
So now we've got the network
run through but the next day,

961
00:56:46,930 --> 00:56:49,960
and it just so happens that
during that week or whatever,

962
00:56:49,961 --> 00:56:54,961
Don Imus said the nappy
headed hoes fucking comment
and for whatever reason all

963
00:56:58,151 --> 00:57:00,460
hell fucking breaks loose like you know,

964
00:57:00,461 --> 00:57:03,370
Hitler's back and um,

965
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:09,250
it becomes this big fucking lightning
rod thing that allows a bunch of people

966
00:57:09,251 --> 00:57:10,480
who don't,
you know,

967
00:57:11,350 --> 00:57:14,470
want to increase the fines
with the FCC and all this shit.

968
00:57:14,471 --> 00:57:18,190
All basically what this one guy said on
the radio trickles all the way down to

969
00:57:18,191 --> 00:57:22,180
our pilot that has these fucking suits,
nervous,

970
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:27,070
you know, just in general about, we
better watch our step because Don Imus,

971
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:29,170
I dunno what loss,
some advertising money.

972
00:57:29,470 --> 00:57:33,280
So they in that fucking headspace and
they come down to our show where we got to

973
00:57:33,281 --> 00:57:37,540
half paralyzed guy, you
know, and the opening scene,

974
00:57:37,541 --> 00:57:39,940
we're doing the scene,
it's getting zero laughs.

975
00:57:39,970 --> 00:57:44,200
And I remember where the homeless guy
walked out and they even gasped at that

976
00:57:44,201 --> 00:57:47,410
because they really made them
look homeless. He was really dirty

977
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:54,500
and Norbit goes all the jokes of bombing
and he goes and turns around and flips

978
00:57:57,341 --> 00:58:00,760
this fucking Globa ice cream and
hits the actor right in the face.

979
00:58:00,790 --> 00:58:05,650
And they gasped and no law.
I mean I thought it was going to kill.

980
00:58:06,430 --> 00:58:10,030
We thought it was the funniest shit
ever. They, there wasn't a fucking,

981
00:58:10,450 --> 00:58:14,110
they just gasped and then it ended right.

982
00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:19,890
And then just the sound of their shoes
shuffling all the way down to the other

983
00:58:20,711 --> 00:58:25,210
side of the set for the next
fucking scene. And it, dude,

984
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:28,360
it was the worst run through
I've ever been in. I'm talking,

985
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:32,500
there was zero laughs,
it was dead fucking silence.

986
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:36,400
And I just remember walking
by this one actress,

987
00:58:36,401 --> 00:58:41,080
she delivered her line and it got nothing.
And she walked by looking at me like,

988
00:58:41,081 --> 00:58:42,340
what the fuck is happening?

989
00:58:42,341 --> 00:58:47,140
And I almost burst out laughing
because for actors it's like,

990
00:58:47,141 --> 00:58:51,730
fuck, I'm going to get fired and I'm going
to be unemployed again. For a comedian,

991
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:56,470
I can still, I'm not, I'm not unemployed.
I can just go back to doing shows.

992
00:58:56,471 --> 00:58:58,870
The fact that I'm on this thing is,
is gravy.

993
00:58:59,350 --> 00:59:02,920
So the look on her face was just, I
mean, I don't want it to be out of work,

994
00:59:02,921 --> 00:59:06,290
but it was just funny to me.
So the more it was bombing them,

995
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:11,340
the harder I committed to what I was doing
just because if you're going to bomb,

996
00:59:11,801 --> 00:59:13,930
you might as well just
fucking do the triple Lindy.

997
00:59:14,470 --> 00:59:19,090
So I was just going bigger and it
just was just dead fucking silence.

998
00:59:19,990 --> 00:59:22,970
So the run through ends,
I mean,

999
00:59:22,971 --> 00:59:26,180
you can hear a fucking pin drop and it
was to the point, he was like, dude,

1000
00:59:26,181 --> 00:59:27,800
I didn't think they gonna
shoot this fucking thing.

1001
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:33,050
So me and Norbert went back to the hotel.

1002
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:37,640
We go right to the bar and we just start
laughing, going, I'm getting fired.

1003
00:59:37,670 --> 00:59:41,090
He's going, no, I'm getting fired. And we
had like a bet who's going to get fired.

1004
00:59:41,091 --> 00:59:43,190
It's like somebody is going down
for that. It's like, you know,

1005
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:46,460
like Lsu loses three in a row of
somebody's got to pay the price.

1006
00:59:46,461 --> 00:59:50,210
Somebody getting fucking fired. So, um,

1007
00:59:51,650 --> 00:59:56,650
day ended up showing up and they would
talk to both of us individually in the,

1008
00:59:58,641 --> 01:00:02,900
uh, in our hotel rooms. I remember
the guy that directed the thing,

1009
01:00:02,901 --> 01:00:06,440
he came walking into my room
and just sat down on my bed.

1010
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:10,460
It started eating the peanuts,
my peanuts without asking.

1011
01:00:10,490 --> 01:00:12,800
And I was the most arrogant
thing I'd ever seen in my life.

1012
01:00:12,801 --> 01:00:13,850
And I was just sitting there going like,

1013
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:15,490
okay,

1014
01:00:15,490 --> 01:00:18,970
it's still bugs me to this day. I
didn't say anything to that guy. Um,

1015
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:22,420
but anyways, so they fucking, uh,

1016
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:23,860
okay.

1017
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:26,460
So they ended up towing this
whole fucking thing down.

1018
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:27,560
Okay.

1019
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:31,330
Right. They go, look, we're
not gonna, we're not going
to get rid of you guys. Uh,

1020
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:33,290
was the wrong tone,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

1021
01:00:33,620 --> 01:00:38,620
And then what ended up happening was
they fucking dialed it back like 40%.

1022
01:00:38,930 --> 01:00:42,030
Really took all the balls out of it.
Um,

1023
01:00:42,910 --> 01:00:43,650
okay.

1024
01:00:43,650 --> 01:00:44,401
And then,
you know,

1025
01:00:44,401 --> 01:00:47,700
a few days later we shot the pilot in
front of a live studio audience and it

1026
01:00:47,701 --> 01:00:52,420
actually killed it went great, but it
didn't end up getting picked up and a,

1027
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:52,930
and yeah,

1028
01:00:52,930 --> 01:00:56,620
that's my, uh, that's
my story about bombing.

1029
01:00:57,490 --> 01:00:59,650
Sorry guys. I had to, I had
to go in the weld air, man.

1030
01:00:59,651 --> 01:01:02,230
I ran out of fucking stories to
tell if you tell you for this week,

1031
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:04,720
all I know is that the bills are playing.

1032
01:01:04,721 --> 01:01:07,030
The Patriots tonight in Gillette Stadium

1033
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:09,920
can happen. Um, they just
don't have a quarterback.

1034
01:01:09,930 --> 01:01:12,720
They got a great defense though.
So we'll see what happens. Uh,

1035
01:01:12,721 --> 01:01:15,630
I don't think the Patriots losing
one game is the worst fucking thing.

1036
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:21,180
I think it's actually better, man. Get it.
Makes people focus on somebody else. So,

1037
01:01:21,181 --> 01:01:26,010
uh, you know, worst case scenario when
nine in one, I'm on vacation, you know,

1038
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:28,980
I'm having a good time
here. So, uh, that is it.

1039
01:01:28,981 --> 01:01:32,320
I'll talk to you guys on Thanksgiving.
Um,

1040
01:01:32,370 --> 01:01:36,840
I'll try and make up a pie crust video.
I'm going to do that shit. Why not?

1041
01:01:36,841 --> 01:01:38,120
I said I was going to do it.
Right.

1042
01:01:38,350 --> 01:01:39,700
That'll be me giving back,

1043
01:01:39,701 --> 01:01:44,701
giving thanks to you guys listening to
the podcast I'm doing to do I the Joe

1044
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:49,600
Rogan podcast, Joe Rogan experience.
I'm going to be doing that tomorrow.

1045
01:01:50,150 --> 01:01:54,530
Um, and, uh, I think that's it.
Happy Thanksgiving to everybody.

1046
01:01:54,531 --> 01:01:55,161
If you're traveling,

1047
01:01:55,161 --> 01:01:57,410
you don't have time to listen to podcasts
and he'll get a chance to say it.

1048
01:01:57,411 --> 01:02:00,830
Happy thanksgiving. Thank you to everybody
that's coming out to my show, uh,

1049
01:02:00,831 --> 01:02:03,440

heart. I really appreciate it. And, uh,

1050
