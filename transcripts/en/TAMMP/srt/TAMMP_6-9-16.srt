1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:01,580
Yeah.

2
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:04,760
Hey, what's going on is bill burn.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon,

3
00:00:04,761 --> 00:00:06,960
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast.

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:11,970
Just checking it on you.

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,630
Just checking in on your fucking
red line in the goddamn levels.

6
00:00:15,631 --> 00:00:19,710
Here we bring this down here. Ah, Jesus.

7
00:00:19,711 --> 00:00:22,800
I got shit to do today,
so let's fucking get right to it.

8
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:27,940
You see these? God Damn
digs. Fuck it by him.

9
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:32,350
I found that youtube clip the other day,
man, when the fat kid would review food,

10
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:37,570
that was my favorite one. Fat Kid
reviews, girl scout cookies. He goes,

11
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:42,571
sees a girl scout mint chocolate
chip cookies and I fucking love him,

12
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:43,170
right?

13
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:47,080
He sits there and he teach eight some
looks up in the air and then he goes,

14
00:00:47,081 --> 00:00:51,490
if some you see somebody selling these
goddamn things, fucking buy them.

15
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,890
It's one of the greatest
food reviews ever.

16
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:58,060
I totally believed them and I want
to girl scout cookies. But anyway,

17
00:00:58,061 --> 00:01:01,750
so I'm not here to talk about this.
I'm not in to talk about that.

18
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:06,460
I'm here as a casual
fucking fan of the NBA,

19
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,930
meaning I've probably watched seven whole
games in the last seven fucking years.

20
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:16,060
And I watched the second half of
last night's Cleveland Cavaliers,

21
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,010
first the fucking Golden State Warriors,
um,

22
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:25,240
in a bar with the sound out.
Now here comes my analogy,

23
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:31,270
my favorite fucking moment
of last night and this thing,

24
00:01:31,271 --> 00:01:32,410
I don't have a dog in the fight.

25
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:36,640
I'd love to see Lebron win a
championship for Cleveland. And um,

26
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:41,290
I always like the Golden State Warriors
because they, they stuck, you know,

27
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:44,470
and their fans fucking hung in there
and I liked their floor and all of that

28
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:48,430
shit in that old piece of Shit stadium
they play. And I went to a game there.

29
00:01:48,431 --> 00:01:52,420
I went to a game there about fucking
10 years ago and there was like nobody

30
00:01:52,421 --> 00:01:55,780
there and they had the sickest
fucking live band there.

31
00:01:55,781 --> 00:01:58,720
They were playing Herbie Hancock.
What does that sound?

32
00:01:58,721 --> 00:02:00,460
Well down there and what Bob?

33
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,700
Wow Dude, dude, dude at the beep,

34
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,200
fucking sickest shit ever ate was
way better than mine. I just did

35
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:16,460
the fuck was the name of that song.
I got that on my fucking phone somewhere.

36
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,450
Oh, Jesus. You know, and I'll
play it for you here in a second.

37
00:02:20,451 --> 00:02:22,190
Maybe you guys understand
what this one is.

38
00:02:22,191 --> 00:02:25,400
Herbie Hancock or wasn't watermelon man.
What the fuck was it called?

39
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:29,150
Headhunter her be head cock.

40
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,530
I'm going to hit pause while I look
this up so I don't torture you here.

41
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,990
All right. I got, they were playing. They
were playing Herbie Hancock Chameleon.

42
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,480
I met a professional basketball game.
There's nobody there.

43
00:02:38,481 --> 00:02:42,020
There's fucking live band is crushing
this song right here. Come on,

44
00:02:42,021 --> 00:02:43,580
play it for fuck sakes.

45
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,713
Okay?

46
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,240
That'd be stuck around like, just fucking
game sucks. Listen to this band though.

47
00:02:53,241 --> 00:02:54,740
They're killing it.
Harvey Mason,

48
00:02:59,070 --> 00:02:59,780
right?

49
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,070
Black people all start moving around.

50
00:03:01,071 --> 00:03:04,250
White people start getting uncomfortable
and then the guitar player comes in,

51
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,620
maybe comes in and the next spot,

52
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,120
very calm.

53
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:25,710
I felt like it was in a fucking
movie, so I was like, you know what?

54
00:03:25,711 --> 00:03:29,940
I love this franchise. You know
what this is? This is if you shut,

55
00:03:29,941 --> 00:03:31,680
this is what you should be
doing. Saying, listen man,

56
00:03:31,681 --> 00:03:33,120
we're only going to
win eight games a year.

57
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:36,210
Let's fucking get a killer band
to come in there and people,

58
00:03:36,211 --> 00:03:37,200
can Lisa have a good time?

59
00:03:37,201 --> 00:03:42,030
It was a fucking party and they lost
by like fucking 30. So anyways, I got,

60
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,820
I don't have a dog in this
fight and I watched this game.

61
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:46,733
MMM.

62
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:50,800
I watched this game with the fucking
sound on that was Herbie Hancock Chameleon

63
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,770
by the way,
before you try to shit it,

64
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:56,440
point your phone at your fucking dashboard
while you're driving down the street.

65
00:03:56,441 --> 00:03:59,530
Killing a fucking mother has six.
Um,

66
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:04,940
I have to tell you this over the last
couple of games that I've watched,

67
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:10,030
like the NBA has fucking changed so much
the way Steph curry just runs around

68
00:04:10,101 --> 00:04:13,820
the court. Like it's his,
like the whole thing is his,

69
00:04:13,821 --> 00:04:17,930
it's his fucking showcase when he was
sitting on the bench and that dude hits

70
00:04:17,931 --> 00:04:20,940
the three pointer and he did
that little jazz hand thing.

71
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,210
Yeah.
Whatever

72
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:26,000
the fuck he was doing,
you know,

73
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,860
dribbles out the game and then
it looks at the crowd, goes,

74
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:33,050
starts fucking screaming. I'm
just looking at them, okay,

75
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,080
now I know this guy could fucking
body slammed me. I'm just a comedian,

76
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:41,230
but I'm talking about NBA player
to NBA play at this fucking guy is,

77
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:45,290
he's built like an honor roll student.
All right.

78
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:49,580
And I know he can shoot the fucking lights
out from behind the three point line.

79
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:53,270
Fine. You know, you do the
best she can back there,

80
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:57,170
but you let that little motherfucker
just glide down the God damn lane like

81
00:04:57,171 --> 00:05:01,730
clear path, clear path.
Today's Nba don't touch him.

82
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:07,190
Don't fucking touch him.
That guy needs to get his head taken off.

83
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:13,030
Get one of those fucking giant white
dudes from fucking eastern Europe,

84
00:05:13,491 --> 00:05:18,440
some Transylvania guide. Get him
out there. He's got six files.

85
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:22,810
Just, you know, you know what
would happen? He do fucking
one. They'd be like, Ooh,

86
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:27,470
Ooh. 32 channel. Which the trade
or whatever the fuck they call it.

87
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:32,930
Was that a hard foul? Was he trying
to hurt his feelings with that fall?

88
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:37,160
Oh, let's go over and look at the
tape. What do you think was, was,

89
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:41,630
was his face snarling too much when
he did that? Uh, we can't have that.

90
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,250
Get him out of the game. You know
it's still worth it to fucking do it.

91
00:05:46,251 --> 00:05:47,330
Cause I could take back in the day,

92
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,440
you know the Rick Ma Horns that John
Sally's all at all of these fucking got

93
00:05:52,991 --> 00:05:54,380
John.
Sally passed away unfortunately.

94
00:05:54,381 --> 00:05:59,240
But all of those fucking old school NBA
guys gotta be this fucking kid and just

95
00:05:59,241 --> 00:06:01,870
be sitting there going like, yeah, there,
there, there weren't a half. All right,

96
00:06:01,871 --> 00:06:02,704
wait,

97
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,130
that guy would have got
his fucking head taken off.

98
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:10,970
Do you know if you watch highlights of
Jordan all you young millennial fucking

99
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:15,320
Yolo people out there. If you fucking
watch him, it's like he's skinny,

100
00:06:15,321 --> 00:06:17,990
he's skinny,
and then all of a sudden he's filled out.

101
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:22,340
That was because the Pistons beat the
shit out of him. EPFL like fucking two,

102
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:24,740
three years in a row in the playoffs.
He finally had enough

103
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,740
guy had to go to the gym because the
NBA reps weren't protecting them.

104
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:31,840
They could come down there.

105
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:35,630
They'd fucking do remember one time
fucking bill and beer, one of the,

106
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:39,980
it was like all Samuelson without skates
out there who hilariously and the 30

107
00:06:39,981 --> 00:06:43,190
for 30 years to be like, we used to
like to try to get in people's heads.

108
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:47,120
It's like, like he was playing this
high level fucking mind game. It's like,

109
00:06:47,121 --> 00:06:47,780
no dude,

110
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:50,990
you were just out there waiting for
people to leave their feet and you'd take

111
00:06:50,991 --> 00:06:54,500
their fucking legs out.
How'd you come up with that?

112
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:57,380
It's your major in Calculus.
Um,

113
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,330
so I remember one time he was
hacking the Celtics so fucking bad.

114
00:07:02,331 --> 00:07:06,500
Robert Parish finally couldn't take it
and the players go on up the court and he

115
00:07:06,501 --> 00:07:09,260
just fucking gave them two,
four. I'm smashes over the head.

116
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,890
He chopped them down
like a fucking jealousy.

117
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,770
Like when a guy who does not a chop down
a tree chopped down a tree and it falls

118
00:07:15,771 --> 00:07:20,480
into his house. That's the way he was
hacking away at Lam beer and lamb beer.

119
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:23,480
Just put both his hands
up like, oh, you know,

120
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:28,340
like George Michael when he was with
wham and he just fucking went down.

121
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:32,720
All right. He gave him to fucking ruin
your friends. Right. And he went down,

122
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:35,270
the refs didn't see it.
It was like wrestling.

123
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,480
And then when they back they went back
and looked at the tape. You're like, yeah,

124
00:07:38,481 --> 00:07:41,450
well, you know, we should've called
the file and there was no fines.

125
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:45,200
There was no objections, there
was no nothing. He just, you know,

126
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:49,820
live by the sword, die by the sword.
Um, there was so many of those.

127
00:07:49,821 --> 00:07:52,600
I just was thinking of another one that
I saw. They just, it just nowadays,

128
00:07:52,601 --> 00:07:57,400
you just Curry's out, they
just fucking gliding around.

129
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,370
He's built like a muppet.

130
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:02,090
I just don't understand in this
day and age how that has happened.

131
00:08:02,091 --> 00:08:05,750
And the only thing that I can come up
with is that the leagues are so fucking

132
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:07,910
guilty that not guilty.

133
00:08:07,911 --> 00:08:12,040
Greedy is that they
realize that, you know, um,

134
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:16,820
that offense sells tickets to the
casual fan. You know what I mean? Like,

135
00:08:16,821 --> 00:08:20,270
let's take the most boring game ever.

136
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:22,370
And I'm not talking about horseshoes.

137
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,340
I'm not talking about Shuffle Board.

138
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,860
I'm not talking about darts.

139
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:31,820
I of course am talking about soccer.

140
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,560
Okay.

141
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:38,270
Which the entire world has embraced except
for us and when you really look at it,

142
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:42,140
that's probably why we're number one.
You know what I mean?

143
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:47,780
The rest of the world is too stupid to
realize how boring that fucking game is

144
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:52,990
despite the fact that it's so fucking
boring that even their fans have to have

145
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:58,200
campfires singalongs as they
wait for something to happen.

146
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:03,390
I walked some matter what age,
right? Just sitting there,

147
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:08,030
they're fucking scarves and shit.
This is the thing about,

148
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,020
Oh man, I'm going to get
some fucking emails in this.

149
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,690
This is the thing about fucking soccer,
right?

150
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:18,290
If they just let the forwards run
pass the final line of defense,

151
00:09:18,721 --> 00:09:22,620
like in any other competitive
fucking gang where it's like, hey,

152
00:09:22,621 --> 00:09:23,820
I'm faster than you.

153
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,990
I understand like offsides to a point,

154
00:09:27,991 --> 00:09:31,920
but it's got to be it just a line
like in hockey and then after that,

155
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:36,660
if I'm faster than you, if I can see
the play developing before you do,

156
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,270
I get by you.
I don't have to fucking wait for you.

157
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:40,730
Okay.

158
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:44,600
If they would just adjust that and you'd
start to have some fucking 10 to eight

159
00:09:44,601 --> 00:09:47,060
games,
I'm telling you that game would blow up.

160
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,790
We blow up here in the United States,
we would sit down and fucking watch it.

161
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,550
You know why?
Because we don't understand the game.

162
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:58,800
You know what I mean?
If I was watching cricket right,

163
00:09:58,801 --> 00:10:00,390
I guess they score a lot
in that fucking thing.

164
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,220
That's a good one to just
sit around and booze with,

165
00:10:02,221 --> 00:10:04,020
but any fucking game than I'm not into.

166
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,650
If somebody is crushing it and everybody's
flipping out, I'm going to be like,

167
00:10:07,651 --> 00:10:10,320
what's going on? I'm going to actually
going to sit there and watch it.

168
00:10:10,321 --> 00:10:12,570
Like nobody.
Like when I walked by.

169
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:13,660
Okay.

170
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:16,880
You know in soccer is on, I don't even
look at it, but if I hit this guy go,

171
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,850
he's doing that. I stopped
when I watch, you know,

172
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:28,120
and I read all the fucking advertising's
all over there fucking uniforms.

173
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,140
I got to tell you,

174
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:32,230
the premier league has the worst fucking
uniforms I've ever seen in my life.

175
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:36,490
You can't figure out who the fuck any,
it doesn't say man United,

176
00:10:36,491 --> 00:10:37,960
it doesn't say Liverpool.

177
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:43,050
It just says Exxon and fucking
Joey's fish and chips fucking banks.

178
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:48,280
I heard they're going to do
that in the NBA. But anyways,

179
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:49,810
I think that that's what
happened in the game.

180
00:10:49,811 --> 00:10:51,580
And I know I don't know what
the fuck I'm talking about.

181
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,410
I'm too fucking busy to pay attention.

182
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,470
And at the end of the day I never
really excelled in sports anyway.

183
00:10:56,471 --> 00:10:58,090
So who better to break down?

184
00:10:58,091 --> 00:11:02,110
What's wrong with the fucking NBA then
some Sutter and fucking prick like me.

185
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,150
Okay.

186
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:07,420
I think you got an entire generation
of people that grew up playing Madden

187
00:11:07,421 --> 00:11:11,530
football and all of this shit and
everybody was the globe trotters.

188
00:11:11,531 --> 00:11:14,350
And now that just doing like the
real version of it. All right.

189
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,740
I love Steph Curry. He's the greatest
shoot I've ever seen in my life,

190
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:20,680
but watching him just glide down
the fucking lane is ridiculous,

191
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:24,760
which is why last night after
the fucking whistle blows,

192
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,300
he just decides like, Oh,
I'm just going to fucking,

193
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,050
I'm going to take a little lay up here.

194
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:30,010
Okay.

195
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:31,750
You know right next to Lebron James.

196
00:11:31,751 --> 00:11:33,960
And I loved that Lebron blocked
it and looked at him like,

197
00:11:33,961 --> 00:11:37,210
what the Fuck Outta here? That's
what they need to do. All right,

198
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:41,470
you're not going to beat these fucking
guys play in their damn game trying to

199
00:11:41,471 --> 00:11:44,710
out shoot fucking three pointers or
whatever the fuck it is they're doing.

200
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,800
Granted, I washed it with the
sound down in the second half. Um,

201
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:52,180
they need to fuck they got it.
They got you. I'm telling you,

202
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:55,900
they got to give him the old right there
for it. That's what they got to do. Okay.

203
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:02,040
That's what you do. If the other team is
faster, the other team fucking, you can't,

204
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:06,970
you have to play fiscal. I'm not saying
play dirty Pittsburgh Penguin fans.

205
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:10,400
I'm not saying you hire a
fucking knee breaker and,

206
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:13,630
and the career of the best player on
their other team. I'm not saying that.

207
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:16,900
All I'm saying is when the
guy comes down the lane,

208
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:21,130
your whole team should be
yelling clearer path, you know,

209
00:12:21,131 --> 00:12:25,030
and this guy looks like he's in
the fucking globe trotters. Um,

210
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:29,590
now, now that I'm done with
that little fucking Soliloquy,

211
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:34,450
most of that was based in what
happens is you get older, you know,

212
00:12:34,451 --> 00:12:36,760
and you start realizing
your own mortality.

213
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:40,450
And there's a couple of panic
thoughts that you have is, you know,

214
00:12:40,451 --> 00:12:44,800
the world is churches. Oh, I'm
gonna die and it's gonna keep going.

215
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:51,130
Part of it was that, that the game
has changed. You know what I mean?

216
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,210
I am kind of the old man going,
why can't they have shorts,

217
00:12:54,211 --> 00:12:58,060
shorts again and close line somebody.
It's amazing.

218
00:12:58,061 --> 00:13:01,600
Somebody balls didn't come out
like during that Rambus play.

219
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:04,510
It's unbelievable that his
junk didn't come out the side.

220
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:08,560
He fucking literally did. Like,
you know, like, uh, he did,

221
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:13,830
he was doing like a Thomas
flair in the air and do it.

222
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:17,830
I actually retweeted the other day,
it was enough game Jack Sigma elbows,

223
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:22,030
Kareem Abdul Jabbar in the fucking
like right in, right in the right.

224
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,640
Inhale solar plexus zs
to say in wrestling.

225
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:28,060
And Kareem had to like fucking
just run it off like, fuck.

226
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:31,600
So whatever happened on
the play where the sea, uh,

227
00:13:31,601 --> 00:13:36,040
the sonics hit the shot or not, they're
going back up to court or whatever. No,

228
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:38,500
they didn't cause what's his face?
Sigma was still setting up.

229
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:43,930
Corinne walked back into the play and
just got a little in front of Jack Sigma

230
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:47,170
turned around and punched
him right in the face.

231
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,290
And sigma had that great hair,
you know,

232
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:54,250
that hair that like moves around if he
get hit, you know, he had whip lash hair,

233
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,200
the white version of it.

234
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,010
We had Thomas Hitman Hearns had the
black version when he fought, uh,

235
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:05,050
when he fought Marvin Hagler. You know,

236
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,140
if a black guy, he's going to get
punched in the head in a boxing match,

237
00:14:08,141 --> 00:14:10,930
you want them to have a Jerry
curl because it just adds to it.

238
00:14:10,931 --> 00:14:13,570
When all that liquid just
shoots off his fucking head.

239
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:18,700
And Jack Sigma had the white version
of it where he had basically a Beatles

240
00:14:18,701 --> 00:14:20,800
haircut.
So it just enhances,

241
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:25,510
you really get to see like how much you
know, whiplash, somebody who's enduring.

242
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:29,750
Um, all right, there we go. That's just
the end of it. I, I, you know what,

243
00:14:29,751 --> 00:14:33,070
I'm going to, selfishly, I
want to see seven games, um,

244
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:37,210
and uh, I would like to see, all
right, one teams of finesse team,

245
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:40,960
the other teams of physical team,
I don't want to say any dirty play,

246
00:14:40,961 --> 00:14:42,700
but I don't see one team,
you know,

247
00:14:42,701 --> 00:14:47,560
putting on their Tutus and trying to
out fucking spin the other team. Right.

248
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:51,440
Isn't that what I'm saying?
Then you know, sorry,

249
00:14:51,441 --> 00:14:55,910
I'm trying to plow my way through this
podcast. So they got to go a table reader.

250
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:59,540
You want to join the podcast? He
just coming in to say hello. No,

251
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:04,480
I just called Tuesday.
Has a day.

252
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,520
Not Today.
I got one more day and I'm doing today,

253
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:11,960
but tomorrow it's your birthday.
Oh yeah. Where are you taking me?

254
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:12,950
Chucky cheese.

255
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:21,620
I get to work here. Come
here. I do. I feel about it.

256
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,460
How do you feel about your
birthday? This is a weird one. Why?

257
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,020
Because usually at my advanced age,

258
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:34,220
I start going like, oh
God. And I was this number.

259
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,810
Now I'm that number, right? This one.
I, I don't, I've just sort of, uh,

260
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:43,550
you know, somewhere when I,
during my year of being 47,

261
00:15:43,551 --> 00:15:48,320
I realized it's over
what's over my sex appeal.

262
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:53,360
My, uh, my dream of being
one of the People magazine's
50 most beautiful people.

263
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:56,460
Uh, yeah, that might
be in the latter rains,

264
00:15:56,510 --> 00:16:00,540
but a sex appeal I think is,
oh Geez.

265
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:03,650
Is everybody gets a ribbon nowadays.
Um,

266
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:09,530
so I just have settled into a,
I went and I got glasses the other day.

267
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:14,000
Yes, he did. Cleo, get out of
there. That was a grape nuts.

268
00:16:14,001 --> 00:16:18,520
Those are not for you. Go
Fat. She's getting fat.

269
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:22,970
She's fat. You're fat, and
you're not going to get a
date. No one's going to love,

270
00:16:22,971 --> 00:16:27,780
you know, I've been so busy,
I haven't been able to walk.

271
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,320
Grab a microphone here cause you're going
to drive people nuts off off the thing.

272
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,173
Go get a call.

273
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:37,980
You're gonna drive me nuts cause
a microphone in the closet. Huh?

274
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:43,220
I feel like de Niro and knock and I'm
Goodfellas now kick on right down there.

275
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:49,160
Yeah, it was scaring me, Karen.

276
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:54,980
Um, no, this one I'm just
now like, I'm Kinda like,

277
00:16:54,981 --> 00:16:59,420
all right, I'm old now. It's all
about, and because I had sight, Erica,

278
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:05,790
Erica,
um,

279
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:11,980
I realize now that all I give a shit is
that if I just can sit down and not have

280
00:17:13,251 --> 00:17:16,850
pain, I'll be fine. And I want to thank
everybody that's have given me all their,

281
00:17:16,851 --> 00:17:21,050
their, you know, remedies
and all of that stuff.

282
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:26,210
You know, it's funny. It's, yeah,

283
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,190
it's funny as hell how they fucking do
it, where it's, it's done with love,

284
00:17:31,191 --> 00:17:35,900
but in a Twitter way, like, hey
fuck it. Just if you have Sciatica,

285
00:17:35,901 --> 00:17:40,210
just do this. Get or get one of those foam
rollers and roll out your [inaudible].

286
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:43,070
And it's like, I did that, I did
that, I've done all of that shit.

287
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,280
I actually went to the chiropractor
again yesterday and he said that the

288
00:17:46,281 --> 00:17:49,920
swelling on my spine
has gone tremendously.

289
00:17:49,921 --> 00:17:53,070
I am now on the next level of healing.
Well now I don't have pain.

290
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:57,570
I just feel like, uh, it's a little
tingly sometimes my foot falls asleep.

291
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:02,400
I've been doing these stretches.
A buddy of mine at work got in this.

292
00:18:02,401 --> 00:18:05,110
You don't like do any of those things
where you hang upside down? Yeah,

293
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:09,480
he got one that's actually
not legal in this country. Um,

294
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,960
but you they sell it in Canada,
Canada and you just basically, uh,

295
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:16,650
you're more hanging from like your
waste as opposed from your ankle.

296
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:17,880
Dad was talking about,

297
00:18:17,881 --> 00:18:20,300
my dad was talking about the one
where you hang from your ankles. Yeah.

298
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:23,580
And what my chiropractor was
saying was that that one,

299
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,880
it puts stress on your joints cause
you got your whole body weight,

300
00:18:26,881 --> 00:18:27,840
puts like your ankles,

301
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:31,020
your knees and your hips because your
whole body weight with this other one.

302
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:34,050
He had loved that thing
though. Yeah. I don't know.

303
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,670
A lot of people love
it for whatever reason,

304
00:18:35,671 --> 00:18:40,110
but I've been using the other one
and that one would be like, uh,

305
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,660
say like you're at the zoo and you're at
the gorilla and closure and you want to

306
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:50,100
bend over and look for the dime.
You just fucking lost. Very timely.

307
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:55,320
Just imagine that except you don't
fall in is the thing and an adult,

308
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,420
if an adult fell in there,

309
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:01,380
would they have shot at
with a tranquilizer thinking
that maybe the adult could

310
00:19:01,381 --> 00:19:05,440
handle the fucking thrashing that he was
going to get? I think that they had a,

311
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:09,210
would have had the presence of mind
to like slowly try to back out of the

312
00:19:09,211 --> 00:19:12,630
situation as opposed to a baby that's
just kind of like sitting there.

313
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:16,080
Can you give us an example of how you
would slowly back of a situation with the

314
00:19:16,081 --> 00:19:20,460
gorilla? Alright. You fallen, I
god, what would you say? Hey Man,

315
00:19:20,461 --> 00:19:23,970
like easy, easy. Well, you know,

316
00:19:23,971 --> 00:19:26,610
I'm terrified of primates.

317
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:29,580
Like they just freaked me out in general,

318
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:34,540
so I don't really know what I would
do because I just feel like, oh,

319
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:39,150
I know what I would do common like Dna
wise or something with a chimpanzee than

320
00:19:39,151 --> 00:19:42,480
they do with a gorilla like
date. That freaks me out. I know,

321
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:44,970
I know exactly what I would do.
I don't like it.

322
00:19:44,971 --> 00:19:49,310
Actually I would curl up in the fetal
position and I would cover up my face so

323
00:19:49,311 --> 00:19:51,480
he wouldn't rip it off
and I would just be like,

324
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,480
if I got to take some
gorilla fucking kidney shots,

325
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:58,710
I would much rather take the ESV comes
over and just fucking whales on me,

326
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,010
like from fucking ankle
to the side of my head.

327
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,470
I will take that before I will.

328
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:08,070
I will just stand there with my face
out waiting for you to rip it off.

329
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:12,090
Well I do they, yeah, I mean I feel
like that's probably the best way to go.

330
00:20:12,091 --> 00:20:15,750
So they don't see you as like a threat
or something like you just sort of submit

331
00:20:15,751 --> 00:20:19,140
to them or something? I don't know.
But then I don't want them to be like,

332
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:22,920
I'm sure this information
is on the Internet wife now.
Like it's just so weird.

333
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:24,930
I don't know. They just,
they really freaked me out.

334
00:20:24,931 --> 00:20:26,160
I remember when we went to Australia,

335
00:20:26,161 --> 00:20:29,490
you know they're going to grab you by
your ankle and just drag you around like a

336
00:20:29,491 --> 00:20:33,420
fucking, like they did that little
kid. I haven't watched it. Oh,

337
00:20:33,421 --> 00:20:36,300
remember when we went to Australia and
I was telling they have video of it.

338
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:38,730
I don't want to watch that.
I did. I did watch the,

339
00:20:38,731 --> 00:20:42,510
one of the naked guy that walked into
the line and closure and he's trying to

340
00:20:42,511 --> 00:20:44,820
kill himself and the fucking his,

341
00:20:44,821 --> 00:20:49,310
his neck is in the guy in the
fucking and naked. I mean,

342
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:53,620
I was talking about that on the TV. Oh
my God. Yeah, a little. Yeah. It's like,

343
00:20:53,621 --> 00:20:55,600
go ahead, grab my neck, but
I still got a cup of my junk.

344
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:59,620
You still got to keep your boxes on,
right? No, but this is the thing.

345
00:20:59,621 --> 00:21:02,920
The thing was just handled by his neck.
But you survive. Yeah, but cause I,

346
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,950
they must have just fed the fucking thing.
So it just had him around the neck.

347
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,210
She and the guys literally,

348
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:12,240
he's got his arms around the things that
blinds neck and then he's basically in

349
00:21:13,121 --> 00:21:16,060
any wrapped his legs around his body.
He basically had it in the guard,

350
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:20,620
like a Jujitsu guard and the
fucking lion around his throat,

351
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,010
but he wasn't shaking him or anything.
And everyone like, you know, going,

352
00:21:24,011 --> 00:21:27,070
Oh my God, I'm a God and you
know, whatever fucking language.

353
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:29,040
What if a country was in
their film in the guy,

354
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:33,100
that guy was completely
fucking naked and um, yeah,

355
00:21:33,101 --> 00:21:36,610
he obviously had like mental
issues because if you're
in sound mind and you kill

356
00:21:36,611 --> 00:21:38,530
yourself, you just like
jump off something, right?

357
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:43,610
Yeah. You don't wander into a land on
somebody naked Volkswagen Passat. Wait,

358
00:21:43,611 --> 00:21:46,090
but I wanted to say when we
went to Australia that time,

359
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:49,780
were you with me when I was in
that monkey exhibit or whatever,

360
00:21:49,781 --> 00:21:52,540
and it looked like planet of the
apes and it was freaking me out.

361
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:56,320
And then we went into that other little
side room and there was a monkey behind

362
00:21:56,321 --> 00:21:59,620
the glass and everyone was looking at
it and taking pictures and he started

363
00:21:59,621 --> 00:22:02,830
rocking back and forth and I was like,
that thing is about to freak out.

364
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:06,970
And then it threw itself up against the
glass and like screamed and yelled and

365
00:22:06,971 --> 00:22:09,510
everyone was like, and then
the other chimp came in. Yes.

366
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,610
And like tried to come and I hugged it.
Yeah,

367
00:22:12,611 --> 00:22:17,140
we thought they were going to fight and
then they embraced each other and then

368
00:22:17,141 --> 00:22:20,440
they like put their backs toward the
glass with one of them's arm around the

369
00:22:20,441 --> 00:22:23,190
other. Like it's going to be okay. Like
we're going to get out of here some day.

370
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:28,360
Like it was so emotional and it
was so scary. I just, I can't,

371
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:32,830
I don't know. I can't deal with it. Like
that scene in the trailer for Tarzan,

372
00:22:32,831 --> 00:22:37,450
the legend of Tarzan or the monkey comes
in and like see as the Tarzan and the

373
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:41,740
bassinet and then picks it up and
then leaves with it as just like,

374
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:45,240
I don't know. I don't
like that shit. Yeah.

375
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:48,420
I just think it's really weird.
I mean,

376
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,700
if that was in the wild,
they would,

377
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,770
they would eat that baby and
they would actually leave it,

378
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:56,410
keep it alive as long as they could
because they enjoy the screaming cause. It

379
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:02,490
is that true that they get off on it,
man. Two chimpanzees are fucking evil.

380
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:05,430
Grill is a chill.
Gorillas don't have anything to prove.

381
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,210
Chimps have the short man's disease.
I feel like men are a little more chill

382
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,790
and then he got those tweaker monkeys.
Yeah, right. The meth head ones.

383
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:14,560
Those ones that throw their shit out.
Yet

384
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:18,350
the chimpanzee was the one that like
threw itself up against the glass and was

385
00:23:18,351 --> 00:23:19,730
like really loud and screaming.

386
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,710
The other girl is seem a
little bit more peaceful.

387
00:23:21,711 --> 00:23:23,060
Those are the ones that are handsome.

388
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:27,290
Like you saw that one gorilla
that everyone was freaking
out about in the zoo in

389
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:29,960
Japan because everyone
thought it was like a good,

390
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:33,080
it's actually a very good looking
gorilla, but yeah, that was weird.

391
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:35,420
It was really weird.

392
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:41,880
You will never find
another gorilla like me. I,

393
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,990
yeah, like sexy gorilla. That's
why they freak me out there.

394
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,620
So human like that is just,
it's unsettling to me.

395
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:54,070
And I don't like when they make gorillas
have agendas like that commercial where

396
00:23:54,561 --> 00:23:58,670
the little girl is deaf and she's doing
sign language with the other gorilla.

397
00:23:58,671 --> 00:23:59,504
It's like all,

398
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:04,840
oh, rang a Tan. What? One Orangutan? My
hope is that that's the ones that, look,

399
00:24:04,841 --> 00:24:06,540
if I was a fucking chimp,
that's what I would,

400
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:11,140
oh the ones with all the stringy hair.
Orange ones look like old men,

401
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:16,900
but they're like sign language in each
other and it's like, oh that's sweet.

402
00:24:16,901 --> 00:24:19,900
Like they're communicating through sign
language and then all of a sudden that

403
00:24:19,901 --> 00:24:22,030
orangutan is like,
oh,

404
00:24:22,031 --> 00:24:26,810
but like the way you live is destroying
my life. And it's like, wait a minute.

405
00:24:26,811 --> 00:24:30,310
And it was like for about palm oil
or peanut oil. And it was like,

406
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,150
don't get the monkey. Everything's
fucking cause now did you see,

407
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:36,640
I told you this morning, I
didn't see that. You get it,

408
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:39,430
but don't bring the animals into it.
And deaf children,

409
00:24:39,431 --> 00:24:43,820
like I just felt like that was his fucking
monkeys with their agendas. I didn't,

410
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,150
I didn't see the clip. It's,
I just, I just read about it.

411
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:51,330
Some reporter as Bernie Sanders,
the fact that he's staying in the race,

412
00:24:51,331 --> 00:24:54,980
they asked him if he was being
sexist by staying in it. Yeah.

413
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:57,060
Like he couldn't handle
lights into a home.

414
00:24:57,061 --> 00:24:59,160
And why is that sexist
for him to stay in there?

415
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:03,660
Because the reporter wants
Hillary Clinton. They want
him out. They want him out.

416
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:07,080
They want Trump out. Even Republicans
like where the money's at thick.

417
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:12,060
They are going to accept Hillary
Clinton before Trump and before,

418
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:14,940
um, uh, Bernie Sanders.

419
00:25:14,941 --> 00:25:19,830
And what I love about Trump and Bernie
Sanders was it showed that enough

420
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:24,950
Americans are sick of the
standard Republican Democrat.

421
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:27,390
Like Hillary Clinton is the
standard fucking Democrat.

422
00:25:27,391 --> 00:25:30,210
She's got the same money in our pockets.
The Republican,

423
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:33,310
the General Republican candidate
would have had. And he goes,

424
00:25:33,311 --> 00:25:37,440
all the fucking guys that was running
basically, um, and it's, you know,

425
00:25:37,441 --> 00:25:37,801
it was just,

426
00:25:37,801 --> 00:25:40,790
that means just the 1% is going to get
more fucking rich and going to push down

427
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:44,520
the middleclass the same fucking bullshit.
They're going to stay the course.

428
00:25:44,521 --> 00:25:47,920
They don't want somebody that's
off to the side. I got, uh,

429
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:51,360
I just had a scary thought.
What was that? Trump president?

430
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:56,620
No, I was thinking about, I don't
know that around your president now,

431
00:25:56,621 --> 00:26:01,330
that orangutan thing. And I just
literally got a picture of an orangutan.

432
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:05,980
Yeah. Like I said, Tang, like the drink
of my whole life isn't an orangutan.

433
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,740
No, it's a rang a Tan. It is. Nobody's,

434
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:13,120
I don't think that's
true. Well, oh wait, is it

435
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:16,390
rang a Tan.
I just,

436
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:20,470
it was making me think of planet of
the apes where it's like take over.

437
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:21,933
Oh yeah.

438
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:22,380
Yup.

439
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:25,570
And I got to made everybody made fun of
what's his face fell and potato with the

440
00:26:25,571 --> 00:26:30,100
knee. I always did potato Po. Tay
told, I think I used to smell,

441
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:35,010
I mean spell tomato with an e
at the end. Cause the, the toe.

442
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:37,450
Yeah.
It's like there's a toe.

443
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,130
So are both dumb.
Well

444
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:44,090
that's why we found each
other. That's right. Because

445
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:47,340
there was no one to be on the date going
like, oh my God, this person's an idiot.

446
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:51,270
We were both going like,
wow, this person gets me.

447
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:54,210
I'm excited for your birthday tomorrow.

448
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,690
You'll never find Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo.
Yeah you are.

449
00:26:57,691 --> 00:27:02,280
You're very resigned this year. I've
noticed even now talking about it as much.

450
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:05,790
Oh, cause I'm in the writer's room. I
know what's going to happen. My birthday.

451
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:08,130
I'm going to fucking go to the writer's
room and stare at a computer all day.

452
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:09,420
Oh yeah.

453
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:15,320
Well if this person says this and then
called back to that story til still

454
00:27:15,961 --> 00:27:20,550
track. Yeah, that's, but they'll
probably give you a cake at the office.

455
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:25,740
No, cause there's somebody's
birthday was yesterday.

456
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,260
That was the oh yeah.
You guys have some of these first date.

457
00:27:28,261 --> 00:27:32,910
Today's the ninth and mine is Friday.
If they get a cake,

458
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:38,120
you know, if they get me a cake,
it's because they all want cake. No.

459
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:42,780
Um, no. I know what I
wanna do for my birthday.

460
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:45,570
What do you want to do for
your birthday? Um, tell me.

461
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:49,140
Well, you know, in a perfect world,

462
00:27:49,141 --> 00:27:52,620
my back would be fine and I'd take you
up in the helicopter with an instructor.

463
00:27:52,621 --> 00:27:55,810
Of course, you know. Oh,
that would be fun. Yeah.

464
00:27:56,070 --> 00:28:00,800
And we'd fly over the ocean and I'd be
singing where no more nurture our Lord.

465
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:06,720
The more
I would do that.

466
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:11,640
My name is John Dacre.
My name is John Dacre.

467
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,460
That's my favorite fucking thing ever.

468
00:28:14,461 --> 00:28:17,160
I just more than any
question in the world,

469
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:21,870
[inaudible] Mori,

470
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,200
what's the first religious
song you sing? So, Oh,

471
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:31,440
I'm Rosa Lord,
or it was really

472
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:37,440
good.
It goes when he ends up here.

473
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:39,140
Oh

474
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:43,210
Hey had a fucking meltdown.

475
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:48,510
He was on TV and he just got in his
fucking head and I don't think he'd ever

476
00:28:48,941 --> 00:28:52,420
been in his head in his life that he's
a really cerebral guy and he couldn't

477
00:28:52,421 --> 00:28:56,860
understand that for the first time ever.
His head, his brain was failing him.

478
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,450
He was really looking around like,

479
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:02,250
I'm just as confused spot this as you are.

480
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:05,680
Did he choked and I feel like
in church or wherever it is,

481
00:29:05,681 --> 00:29:07,870
because the woman playing the piano,
she is like,

482
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:11,660
I guess she gives lessons
in that town and I,

483
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:14,560
I'm sure that in charge he kills it,

484
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:18,480
but then he's in that public access duty.
I don't think it kills her camp.

485
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,910
I think he can change changes,

486
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:26,980
like just he can carry a tune and they
bury them with like 40 people around

487
00:29:27,311 --> 00:29:30,880
them. Right, right, right.
He's probably still weird.

488
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:32,380
What kind of car you think he drives?

489
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:38,170
It's something very old and something
like tragically unhip it's Brown.

490
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:42,190
Yes. Brown. He drives a
brown, a brown interior.

491
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:46,510
Like it's just brown on Brown. Yeah,
it's like an old Pontiac Bonneville.

492
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:51,940
Then old Napoli.
[inaudible]

493
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,180
my name is John Dacre.

494
00:29:57,850 --> 00:30:01,840
My name is John Dacre.
Let them fuck.

495
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:05,950
There's so much. You guys have
to see this. No, no. I already,

496
00:30:05,951 --> 00:30:10,330
I already talked about that.
I do love it.

497
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:14,900
We got a table read. So I got to go over
my lines here today. They're Nino. Um,

498
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:19,150
Bebo let me a, I got to do a
little some reeds here. Alright.

499
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:24,230
Helix Hallux. I don't know. Uh,
your helix. Sadly. Helix. Helix.

500
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:25,720
Your unique.

501
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:31,110
You don't walk like anyone else talk like
anyone else or sleep like anyone else.

502
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:37,000
So why is your mattress one size fits all?

503
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,900
I don't know cause we're all
basically the same height. You know,

504
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,370
unless you're like an NBA freak because
a truly customized mattress will cost

505
00:30:45,371 --> 00:30:49,720
you five to 10 10,000 bucks until now.
Now,

506
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,920
now my name is John Dacre.
Go To Hague,

507
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,780
calyx sleep.com answer helix,

508
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:00,910
sleep.com I keep thinking of the band
for a answer, a few simple questions,

509
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:06,060
and they'll run a three d biochemical
model of your body through the proprietary

510
00:31:07,331 --> 00:31:12,220
algorithms they've developed with the
help of the world's leading ergonomics and

511
00:31:12,221 --> 00:31:12,971
biomechanics.

512
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:17,971
It's like just a troll me biomechanics
experts as a mistake or you know why?

513
00:31:18,011 --> 00:31:19,480
Because my brain is already gone.
All right,

514
00:31:19,481 --> 00:31:22,960
so they take a three d image of your
body and then that's on the Internet

515
00:31:22,961 --> 00:31:25,810
somewhere, right? It's
a custom mattress. Yeah,

516
00:31:25,811 --> 00:31:28,690
but any information goes on the Internet.
People can hack in,

517
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:33,700
so someone hacks in and see what they
take that five 11 right now and then they

518
00:31:33,701 --> 00:31:37,600
make some blowup doll of your body and
then someone's fucking a rubber version

519
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:40,890
of the Pacific with the
Ville. Birthdays. All again.

520
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:47,020
Yeah. This is, I have a theory about the
internet. I don't give a fuck what it is.

521
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:49,870
Somebody's jerking off to
it. I don't care. Yeah.

522
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:53,100
There's somebody that
gets excited about a,

523
00:31:53,101 --> 00:31:56,590
a kid getting dragged around by his ankle,
by a fucking gorilla.

524
00:31:57,370 --> 00:31:59,770
I you used to say that
about the goodwill to like,

525
00:31:59,771 --> 00:32:03,380
you didn't like it because you just
assume that everyone just just done

526
00:32:03,381 --> 00:32:06,070
everything.
Like all the clothes and all that.

527
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,900
It's like really cool vintage stuff.
You're like,

528
00:32:07,901 --> 00:32:10,450
I don't want something that
somebody just on. And I'm like,

529
00:32:10,451 --> 00:32:14,650
why do you automatically go to somebody
just on something cause of people or

530
00:32:14,651 --> 00:32:18,400
animals? Cause people show go out
to public events in their bare feet.

531
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,770
That's why you want this sweatpants.

532
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:25,730
You want somebody old couch,
everything's been fucked on or it's just,

533
00:32:25,731 --> 00:32:29,170
that's gross animal. Sorry. Let's
continue with the advertisers

534
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:35,800
helix. Yeah, I doubt the band was
called a Hallux also, by the way. Yes,

535
00:32:35,801 --> 00:32:40,460
they were. Oh, I you sure? Like
you've heard of like a double helix?

536
00:32:40,461 --> 00:32:43,760
Like that's not what they're talking
about. Oh No, it wasn't that deep. Oh.

537
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:49,040
Gimme an Har, r o, c. K.

538
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:52,190
And what'd you gonna do?
Rock. You don't remember that?

539
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:56,780
There was deep lyrics back in
the eighties helix, Helix, Helix.

540
00:32:56,781 --> 00:32:59,930
Customers report a 30% improvement
in overall sleep quality.

541
00:32:59,931 --> 00:33:03,440
I should really do this with
my Sciatica and for couples,

542
00:33:03,441 --> 00:33:08,360
they customize each side of the mattress.
Ooh, wow. We can along so much better.

543
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:14,270
Your mattress arrives at your door in
about one week and shipping is 100% free.

544
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:19,220

it out, and if you don't love it,

You sons of bitches,

616
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:23,563
eh.

617
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:42,973
Okay.

618
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,070
Hey,
what's going on?

619
00:38:46,071 --> 00:38:50,930
It's still the Monday morning podcast and,

620
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:54,950
uh, I'm in Raleigh, Durham airport.

621
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:56,721
I don't know if it's,

622
00:38:56,721 --> 00:38:59,870
I think she had the balls to call
this an international airport.

623
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:04,640
I'm not sure. I don't think
it's international cause
the lines went that long.

624
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:10,250
Uh, that's one of the dumbest
things I've ever fucking said.

625
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:13,850
Let me consider last. And the
lunch went that long. Really?

626
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:16,070
He didn't see anybody on
a fucking Jeannie rug.

627
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,700
So you don't think that flies
anywhere else? You idiot. All right.

628
00:39:19,701 --> 00:39:24,050
I'm not in a good mood. Why?
Bill? Why aren't you in a
good mood? I'll tell you why.

629
00:39:24,051 --> 00:39:27,740
Because a hair cut them in Raleigh,
North Carolina.

630
00:39:27,741 --> 00:39:31,130
There's no fucking connects.
There's no direct flights to Los Angeles.

631
00:39:31,131 --> 00:39:35,030
So for some fucking reason,
high after God,

632
00:39:35,031 --> 00:39:38,660
The lady with the voice
either hang on a second.

633
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:43,730
Every five seconds. Yes. Okay. All right.

634
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:47,600
Okay. Terrific. Phone message.

635
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:50,330
You don't have a cell phone with
friends who have that number.

636
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:56,030
Unbelievable.
Pick up a courtesy phone.

637
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,190
It's so fucking stupid.
Everybody has cell phones.

638
00:40:01,191 --> 00:40:05,840
Why would you use that archaic
form in an airport? Okay.

639
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:09,570
Whatever. Uh, anyways. Yeah.
So I'm in Raleigh at the,

640
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:13,040
I want to get to La for some fucking
reason. I have to fly to Cleveland first.

641
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:18,860
And, uh, it's annoying enough
when you have a connecting flight,

642
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:22,830
but you know, why can't it be in a
city that's at least going in the,

643
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:27,670
in the direction that I want to go. I'm
going to go fucking West. I want better.

644
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,530
They make me fly north. It's a
little bit west, but you know,

645
00:40:30,531 --> 00:40:35,060
at the end of the day, it's fucking north
going north of the Mason Dixon line,

646
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:39,380
you know, Mason Dixon Line
just to keep, uh, yeah.

647
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:44,030
What is that late in the lady's
talking so fucking loud over there.

648
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:49,670
Why is it, you know, in
society, why can't I just like,

649
00:40:49,671 --> 00:40:53,810
can you just lean over to her right now
and just be like, hey, Hey lady. Hey.

650
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:57,230
Yeah you do.
Could you shut the fuck up please?

651
00:40:57,370 --> 00:41:02,370
Or at the very least get you talk a
lot quieter because no one gives a fuck

652
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:06,770
about whatever the fuck it is.
It, you're yelling about it,

653
00:41:06,771 --> 00:41:11,210
but you stupid fucking board meeting.
You know what I mean?

654
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:16,010
Who the fuck are you talking
to? It's fucking, I guess
it's 10 25 in the morning.

655
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:19,760
You know what's annoying me?

656
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:25,090
And she's talking really loud and her
eyebrows are at full fucking mass.

657
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:31,130
Uh, Jesus. Is there anybody even
listened to these announcements?

658
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:35,630
I look at this person
by, she's got the, uh,

659
00:41:35,631 --> 00:41:39,470
the p diddy syndrome or the
Shaquille O'neal Syndrome.

660
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:44,810
You know those, you know
those people. Uh, okay.

661
00:41:44,811 --> 00:41:47,690
It's on a Cosby shirt.
You know those people who fucking,

662
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:52,460
their mouths are open even when they're
not talking. I call that PDD syndrome.

663
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:57,560
Is that what you call it? Bell? Yeah.
That is what I call it. All right.

664
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:01,160
I have a flask of time on
pm that I'm going to be,

665
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:06,740
I'm going to be taking, but I can't take
it because I have a connecting flight.

666
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,590
So I'm going to stay awake till
I get to Cleveland. By the way,

667
00:42:09,591 --> 00:42:14,210
my flight to Cleveland is delayed,
you know, they said because of wind,

668
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:20,240
you know what I mean? Really rough wind,
which I don't really understand. You know,

669
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,760
it was like, isn't that how the
fucking plane gets off the ground?

670
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:28,850
You wait for a gust of wind and you
drive into it, you know? I mean, granted,

671
00:42:28,851 --> 00:42:30,710
I never took a physics class.
I was getting you.

672
00:42:30,711 --> 00:42:32,690
I know you got to know how to
fucking plane gets off the ground,

673
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:36,530
which is one of the reasons why
have such a fear of flying take.

674
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:37,850
If I actually understood it,

675
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:42,940
if anybody listening to this could
actually explain in layman's terms how a

676
00:42:43,371 --> 00:42:45,770
fucking 10 ton piece of metal

677
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:52,450
with a bunch of people in various forms
of physical convinced condition can get

678
00:42:52,491 --> 00:42:56,810
off the goddamn ground, actually
get out, gets off the ground.

679
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:58,970
I just don't understand how
it stays off the ground.

680
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,880
Like I can get off the ground, I
can take a running leap, you know,

681
00:43:03,881 --> 00:43:06,740
and for good 0.8 seconds,
I am actually airborne,

682
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:11,540
but I quickly come crashing down to
the ground and roll my fucking ankle.

683
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,920
You know, it's kind of like a boat to
how the fuck does a boat not sanction.

684
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:18,470
You know what I mean,
Dave,

685
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:22,000
you just displace the weight
across the water and spill.

686
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,620
I don't, I don't, you know,

687
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,350
then a bunch of people get on
and then it still doesn't sink.

688
00:43:27,351 --> 00:43:31,580
It just goes down into the water
a little bit more. All right.

689
00:43:31,581 --> 00:43:35,300
I think we've established that Jesus
Christ, look at this guy, he's dressed,

690
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:40,370
he's got some guy,
he looks like he should be yodeling.

691
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:45,200
He has on khaki shorts than
about five inches above his knee.

692
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:47,420
Chancellor of Brown,

693
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:52,450
low cut suede hiking shoes
with ankle below the ankle.

694
00:43:54,231 --> 00:43:57,980
Black thought he just needs like, I
think, what do you call it? A shaft.

695
00:43:58,130 --> 00:44:00,670
One of those sticks with the,
with the curl on it.

696
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:03,380
Jesus Christ.

697
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:08,240
He's probably going to a whorehouse
and just looks like he has some sort of

698
00:44:08,241 --> 00:44:13,160
twisted fetish and wonder what's in
that briefcase. He's drinking coffee,

699
00:44:13,161 --> 00:44:16,610
but he's trying to appear
normal. Um, anyways,

700
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:20,660
if you're a new to this page,
this is the Monday morning podcast.

701
00:44:20,661 --> 00:44:24,230
I do one of these every single
week I hype upcoming gigs,

702
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:29,470
I rant about bullshit and people send me
questions and I tried to answer to the

703
00:44:31,381 --> 00:44:36,280
best of my ability and uh,
yeah.

704
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:37,800
And that's about it.

705
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:43,410
And I gotta admit my computer is tucked
away in my bag and I don't know what the

706
00:44:43,411 --> 00:44:47,580
fuck the questions for the second,
second week in a row.

707
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:51,360
You know what it is? I have one of
the, I have one of those g four Max.

708
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:55,800
I'm at my laptop was about
four years old and uh,

709
00:44:55,830 --> 00:44:56,850
actually have legs on it,

710
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:01,390
like an old TV and a and an
antenna fucking old. All right.

711
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:05,280
And uh, the battery evidently
is defective. So, uh,

712
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:09,810
when I turned it on it, it loses
battery power and about nine seconds,

713
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:13,990
actually it will say I have 75%
battery power. And then it says, um,

714
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:18,120
two seconds. I don't know what the
fuck I'm talking about. All right,

715
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:21,750
let's just get to the shit I
have coming up in my career.

716
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:27,110
I had stand up on the guys' choice awards
for Spike TV and that is going to be

717
00:45:28,291 --> 00:45:29,124
a,

718
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:35,020
it's going to be airing on June
22nd Sunday night on Spike TV.

719
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:40,620
Uh, it's actually a pretty big
award show. I was very amazed at the

720
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:47,100
level of a celebrity that was there.
It's like Harrison Ford, Cameron Diaz,

721
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,210
Jeremy Pivot, you know what
I mean? Spike TV, no offense.

722
00:45:51,211 --> 00:45:56,170
But I thought it was going to be
like Lee Majors and Micky Dolenz uh,

723
00:45:56,410 --> 00:45:59,640
and me, you know, that's what I thought
I was going to be. And then I showed up.

724
00:45:59,641 --> 00:46:04,440
I was like, Holy Shit. You
know, sent Steve Carell's.
Yes, it is. Isn't that amazing?

725
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:09,060
And uh, I was not sitting
seated at his table. I was uh,

726
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:13,380
I was seated at a table.
Well I dunno what the fuck one,

727
00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:17,220
one guy was a reality show director and
the rest of them were a seat filling

728
00:46:17,221 --> 00:46:21,810
horse. I think. Um, at
least that's what it said.

729
00:46:21,811 --> 00:46:25,000
And then the name tag.
Um,

730
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:30,090
so anyways, all right, let's get
to the podcast questions that, uh,

731
00:46:30,091 --> 00:46:33,900
that I can remember. Ah,
fuck with the announcement.

732
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:36,580
And he retains [inaudible]

733
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:42,420
fucking airports.
They make you hate.

734
00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:47,250
Have you got the in flight is delayed.
I'm actually looking a

735
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:52,710
horrific thought I had at the day.

736
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:56,590
I have the USA Today taper
in front of me and, uh,

737
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,980
one of the pictures they have is of,
uh,

738
00:46:59,970 --> 00:47:04,040
this guy looks like he's in the bowling
Joey. I can describe them all right?

739
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:09,750
He's got a checkered shirt on with
a t shirt underneath it. And uh,

740
00:47:09,751 --> 00:47:14,751
he's about up to his man tits and water
hanging onto a rubber raft that has

741
00:47:15,061 --> 00:47:16,860
some, uh, coast guard looking guy in it.

742
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:20,670
He's basically too fat to
get in the fucking boat. Um,

743
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:26,660
and he's walking along and it said Midwest
storm turns deadly and it says seven

744
00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:33,290
reported after tornadoes and heavy
rain pounds states in the heartland.

745
00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:36,910
So I'm like, wow, that's, you know,

746
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,400
at least I'm not fucking up to
my man tits and a rainwater,

747
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:46,570
you know, it's probably eels and
fucking water moccasins and shit.

748
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:52,740
But then there's a part of me because
there's so many goddamn people is a kind

749
00:47:52,951 --> 00:47:56,080
of happy, you know, wash away a few,

750
00:47:56,590 --> 00:47:59,720
let the traffic go down a little bit.
Isn't that a fucking terrible thought?

751
00:47:59,721 --> 00:48:01,180
But I actually,
I actually think that shit

752
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:06,100
underneath that it says a
FDA's tomato warnings grow.

753
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:07,900
This is all the happy
news I've looked at today.

754
00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:13,890
Outbreak of Salmon Nela from raw tomatoes
spreads to 16 states with up to 150

755
00:48:16,271 --> 00:48:18,760
people reported ill.
You know,

756
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:21,400
now a lot of people would look
at that like that's a bad thing.

757
00:48:21,430 --> 00:48:22,930
But I look at it like,
look,

758
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:28,740
those 150 people fucking die from eating
tomatoes or at the very least get some

759
00:48:31,031 --> 00:48:35,860
horrific cases of diarrhea or they're
not going to get into a car. Uh,

760
00:48:35,861 --> 00:48:39,790
you know, the roads would be a
little bit clearer. You know,

761
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:43,030
somebody, I guess, uh,
this is all the happy news.

762
00:48:43,031 --> 00:48:47,830
They don't have one fucking happy thing
on the front page. What do we got here?

763
00:48:49,270 --> 00:48:54,270
US gas average $4 and rising and then
they have a cartoon picture of a hand

764
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:58,360
squeezing a house with money
falling out of the bottom.

765
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:03,640
You know what the funny thing is is if
they didn't even bring this shit up,

766
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:04,960
I wouldn't even know it was happening.

767
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:08,420
Who would know that housing
houses were fucking, uh,

768
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:14,020
the values dropping? How would you even
know that if they didn't bring it up?

769
00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:19,330
Why don't they just stop talking about
it and we'd all walk around like Happy

770
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:20,164
Idiots.

771
00:49:20,470 --> 00:49:23,380
We've continued to spend our money in
malls and they won't be a recession.

772
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:28,570
You know what? That might be the
second dumbest thing I've ever said.

773
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:31,301
You know something?

774
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:34,630
I really resent the way fucking pilots
got to dress like they were on the love

775
00:49:34,631 --> 00:49:39,100
boat. You know what I mean? What is that?
What is that awful fucking uniform? Now?

776
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:41,200
Of course he's going to sit next
to me so I can't make fun of them.

777
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:44,470
You know what I mean? I hate
like the, the, the, the,

778
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:48,010
the shoulder pads with the stripes
on them. You know what I mean?

779
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:53,650
You could if they just came back from
battle as opposed to a round trip to

780
00:49:53,651 --> 00:49:58,590
fucking Seattle, you know
what I mean? I don't know.

781
00:49:59,290 --> 00:50:00,520
There's a golf shops at target,

782
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:05,920
you know it's going to go
shiny golf shirts on and
most Seinfeld white sneakers.

783
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:11,680
You know what? There isn't one well
dressed person in Raleigh, Durham airport.

784
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:16,450
I keep thinking everybody has on a Cosby
share, but it's the same fucking guy.

785
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:20,770
He just keeps pacing back and forth.
So every time, you know, I look up,

786
00:50:20,771 --> 00:50:23,130
he's on my right and then I
look, looked down, I looked up,

787
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:27,310
he's on my left and I think
it's a different guy ladies.

788
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:29,900
Definitely a mother you
got here. What? The little

789
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:35,990
personal size pizza, mothering,
hips swinging to and fro.

790
00:50:37,790 --> 00:50:40,580
That guy's a psycho. Look
at him. He's got a backpack.

791
00:50:41,870 --> 00:50:45,230
Probably tried to hike the Appalachian
trail. Get fucking Ricketts.

792
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:50,780
Umm. All right. So, uh, yeah,

793
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:55,730
the fuck was I talking about?
My girlfriend wants to see Kung Fu panda.

794
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:00,680
That's what I have to look forward to when
I get back to la. Just want to see it.

795
00:51:00,681 --> 00:51:03,140
God damn cartoon about
some fucking martial arts.

796
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:08,450
Why would it fucking pen to need to
learn Kung Fu? You know what I mean?

797
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:11,091
Why would it need,

798
00:51:11,091 --> 00:51:16,091
how to throw kicks when everybody knows
that a bear naturally just has that like

799
00:51:19,161 --> 00:51:21,350
you. Have you ever see like
a watch discovery channel?

800
00:51:21,351 --> 00:51:25,370
My show up bear killing
like a, uh, I don't know.

801
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:29,810
Fucking Yak, whatever. What the
fuck did they kill an elk or deer?

802
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:34,190
They don't come up and grab it by
the throat. All right. All messy.

803
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:38,330
Like all those other predators, they have
the bears come up. They have like that,

804
00:51:38,331 --> 00:51:42,500
that fucking, how do you describe
it? Got fucking bionic bitch slap.

805
00:51:42,501 --> 00:51:46,940
You know what I mean? Just
Bam. Just breaks their neck.

806
00:51:47,630 --> 00:51:51,170
So right there, that's the grizzly bear
proof equivalent of the one inch punch.

807
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,420
We've stopped yelling.

808
00:51:56,330 --> 00:51:59,300
I think she kind of heard me on that.
She's literally looking at me screaming,

809
00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:04,100
can you hear a voice?
She's one of those fucking women.

810
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:07,440
I hate women who were like 40 years
old and they talk like the eight

811
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:16,910
probably like guys kill their wives
while they just get sick of their voices.

812
00:52:16,911 --> 00:52:19,610
God, what a stupid fucking
thing to say. You know what?

813
00:52:20,030 --> 00:52:23,850
This is the bills and more on podcast
today. I'm just done a bad fucking roof.

814
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:29,170
Fucking plane was supposed to take off
at 10 15 and 45 I got some 40 year old

815
00:52:30,561 --> 00:52:34,910
lady with a kid's voice screaming
and then I got the the pie. Oh fuck.

816
00:52:34,911 --> 00:52:39,620
My plane's here, Valerie, that, you know,

817
00:52:39,621 --> 00:52:44,450
it's funny, the plane that I'm flying
from Raleigh Durham International Airport,

818
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:47,650
Esquire is uh,

819
00:52:48,410 --> 00:52:51,890
actually it looks like the kind of
plane that Tom Cruise flies by himself.

820
00:52:53,090 --> 00:52:56,270
You know, I always get excited when I
see those cause I imagine that, you know,

821
00:52:56,271 --> 00:53:00,740
I'm a fucking rock star and I'm getting
on it by myself as opposed to the fact

822
00:53:00,741 --> 00:53:05,240
that I'm getting onto it with 40 other
people. This is how fucked up Raleigh,

823
00:53:05,241 --> 00:53:08,960
North Carolina is as
far as a airport goes.

824
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:10,641
The plane,

825
00:53:10,641 --> 00:53:15,560
I actually flew down here from New York
City and I flew down here on I, yeah,

826
00:53:15,570 --> 00:53:17,990
a plane that had propellers.
I'm not even lying to you,

827
00:53:17,991 --> 00:53:20,390
but it was a new plane and I was like,
wow,

828
00:53:20,410 --> 00:53:23,360
this [inaudible] still going with this.
You know what I mean?

829
00:53:24,170 --> 00:53:25,070
And it was one of those,

830
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:30,380
there was so few people on the flight
that I was sitting in like feet five a and

831
00:53:31,501 --> 00:53:35,490
they go, sorry, excuse
me, excuse me there.

832
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:41,160
And I'm like, bitch, fucking bitch. What?
Excuse me, bitch. And she's like, sir,

833
00:53:41,161 --> 00:53:43,350
I don't need to listen. I'll get it.
And say that that's what I was thinking.

834
00:53:43,351 --> 00:53:47,220
I just said, I said, uh, I said yes,

835
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:50,550
but the underlying, the way
I said it was like, what?

836
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,070
And she's like,

837
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:56,790
I need you to move to the back of the
plane so we can redistribute the weight.

838
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:00,720
You know what I mean?
And it's like really,

839
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:06,510
you basically telling me if I don't go
to the back of this plane that it's going

840
00:54:06,570 --> 00:54:09,550
to like what fucking tip over when we go,
when we go to take off.

841
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:14,370
That makes me feel as a
customer, you know what I mean?

842
00:54:15,870 --> 00:54:19,950
But you know, they don't give
a shit fucking hilarious.

843
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:24,750
She makes me move back, but she
sits up front, you know what I mean?

844
00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:28,980
And when that stupid little fold
down stewardess chair, it's like,

845
00:54:28,981 --> 00:54:33,630
why don't you sit in the
back? I'm a customer. Okay,

846
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:37,980
I want to stay here and this lady to
dress like my fourth grade teacher.

847
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:40,050
Wow.

848
00:54:40,050 --> 00:54:45,050
Black on black pants to Bruce Lee
Kung fu shoes and a shiny pink blouse

849
00:54:45,930 --> 00:54:46,763
underneath it.

850
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:51,210
I Dunno if she's dressed like my fourth
grade teacher or a Nancy Reagan one or

851
00:54:51,211 --> 00:54:53,280
the other hand.
She did

852
00:54:57,100 --> 00:55:01,070
you dress like a first lady?
Uh,

853
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:06,720
all right. Wow. Ooh, let's
go with this talking. Oh,

854
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:09,060
he guides in the points.
That's why shirts so bright.

855
00:55:10,110 --> 00:55:12,720
So I shared so bright and
his mustache is so short.

856
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:16,770
That girl does not trim her Bush.
You can just tell,

857
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:20,280
just tell us going all natural.
I don't know what it is about her.

858
00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:25,110
That lady there has an above ground
swimming pool and her husband. Yeah,

859
00:55:25,111 --> 00:55:27,950
we're going that shoulder tattoo.
I fucking nailed it. I know it.

860
00:55:28,110 --> 00:55:32,370
Above ground swimming pool
made stuffed crust pizza

861
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,590
guy there was good at
basketball cause he's in shape.

862
00:55:37,591 --> 00:55:39,480
He's black and he has
dreadlocks right there,

863
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:43,260
which means he's like the sixth man ever
noticed that the black dudes with the

864
00:55:43,261 --> 00:55:46,410
dreadlocks, they like rebound
guy. You know what I mean?

865
00:55:47,370 --> 00:55:50,550
There's never been a Michael Jordan
style player with dreadlocks,

866
00:55:51,930 --> 00:55:55,230
dreadlocks. And you play
in the NBA. You, uh,

867
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:59,170
you get like fucking 12
rebounds a game and uh,

868
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:04,350
knock out 12 old ladies with your fucking
elbow. I don't know what. All right.

869
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:08,970
I ran out of references
there. Wow. Capri pants,

870
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:12,420
Khaki Capri pants, they
ago. You're married.

871
00:56:12,421 --> 00:56:15,850
There's no reason to give a fuck anymore.
Why would you dress like that?

872
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:20,040
Look at this black guy. Hey, go. Huh? He's
still doing with the extra baggy shit.

873
00:56:21,810 --> 00:56:23,530
Wow.
That look was like 10 years ago.

874
00:56:23,531 --> 00:56:26,740
Remember that one black guys would go
to footlocker and they would find those,

875
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:27,613
uh,

876
00:56:28,430 --> 00:56:32,050
quadruple fucking XLT shirts even
though they were five foot six.

877
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:35,620
I always thought they look like a,
you know,

878
00:56:35,621 --> 00:56:39,040
like after you bang a broad
over there in the next morning,

879
00:56:39,041 --> 00:56:43,360
now she gets up and put some
money, a tee shirts. Uh,

880
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:47,580
all right. I'm just making fun of
people, not because I'm like, well,

881
00:56:47,590 --> 00:56:48,500
I am kind of a con,

882
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:51,520
but I'm just making fun of him because
I don't have my podcast questions in

883
00:56:51,521 --> 00:56:52,660
front of me. So, uh,

884
00:56:53,470 --> 00:56:57,370
why don't we hide some upcoming gigs
and lady looks like Robert Plant from

885
00:56:57,371 --> 00:57:01,840
behind. Oh, it's the same fucking lady.
She's got all kinds of lists going on.

886
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:07,120
What happened to Robert Plant
Man, Jesus Christ. Like,

887
00:57:07,121 --> 00:57:11,620
I look great right after age 46 and all
of a sudden now he looks like he should

888
00:57:11,621 --> 00:57:14,590
be in like a children's book.
Like, like one of those, uh,

889
00:57:15,870 --> 00:57:20,590
it looks like a troll. I don't know what
a fairy tale. That's what it looks like.

890
00:57:20,591 --> 00:57:25,270
Robert Plant looks like. It
looks like he's in a fairy
tale. You know what I mean?

891
00:57:25,271 --> 00:57:30,220
Is this, this is a cruel thing about
life is even if you stay in shape,

892
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:34,660
life is still going to make you
look awful because for some reason,

893
00:57:36,170 --> 00:57:39,880
even if you stay at your high
school, wait, your fucking
head never stops growing.

894
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:45,880
So if you don't get a little out of shape,
if you look fucking ridiculous,

895
00:57:45,881 --> 00:57:50,200
you look like a,
I just lost my train of thought.

896
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:54,960
The fire stop taking this
time on a pen. No, you're not.

897
00:57:54,961 --> 00:57:57,640
You look like if you, have
you seen that fucking guy? Uh,

898
00:57:59,290 --> 00:58:01,570
he's like 45 years old and he's shredded.

899
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:06,960
I might have talked about this last
week again with the Mike Epps had, um,

900
00:58:08,830 --> 00:58:12,130
you know that guy late, late at night.
He does all the physical fitness shit.

901
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:15,520
He's like 46 years,
years old and he's shred it,

902
00:58:15,850 --> 00:58:20,850
but for some reason he still looks weird
and it's his head because his head,

903
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:23,620
I know it's not the head,

904
00:58:23,621 --> 00:58:26,500
it's your fucking knows it's
your ears or something like that.

905
00:58:26,501 --> 00:58:29,440
Something about your head.
It just keeps getting bigger.

906
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:33,880
Like classic example is Ted Kennedy.
Okay,

907
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:36,610
Ted Kennedy's been in the news lately,

908
00:58:36,611 --> 00:58:39,400
has got a fucking brain
tumor or something. Right.

909
00:58:39,790 --> 00:58:43,450
He will get that guy's head
and the 60s for granted,

910
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:47,170
all those Kennedy's had big heads.
You know what I mean?

911
00:58:47,230 --> 00:58:50,110
It's one of the reasons why two of
them got, got, got assassinated.

912
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:53,200
It's like there was no way to miss

913
00:58:55,910 --> 00:59:00,850
I, that's just fucking me. It really
is. But I got to tell you something,

914
00:59:00,851 --> 00:59:02,560
man.
I saw Ted Kennedy,

915
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:07,680
I shook his hand one time and his head
is as big as the seat that I'm sitting

916
00:59:08,021 --> 00:59:11,770
and he has been the biggest
fucking head I've ever, it wasn't,

917
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:15,610
it was unbelievable. I was just
staring at it. I couldn't fuck.

918
00:59:15,611 --> 00:59:18,850
And I got a big head,
but this guy's fucking head was huge.

919
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:24,740
And, uh, you probably want to, how
did I meet him? I actually, uh,

920
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:30,860
I fucking shook his hand and Bill
Clinton's hand, the long fucking story.

921
00:59:31,070 --> 00:59:34,010
Just remind me, I'll tell it to
you next week. Let's stay on track.

922
00:59:34,011 --> 00:59:37,940
You without biggest fucking head is,
I just kept looking.

923
00:59:37,970 --> 00:59:39,530
I just could not believe,

924
00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:43,130
decided like I just want it to like a,

925
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:48,110
I wish there was a way to just like
hold his head just to see how much it

926
00:59:48,111 --> 00:59:52,250
weighed. You know, I, I'm not even joking.

927
00:59:52,251 --> 00:59:55,130
I bet his head ways like,
like 27 pounds,

928
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:01,460
27 fucking pounds. When we think about
that, you know who got the less weight,

929
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:05,090
you know that when you're doing
your warmup set and you grab like,

930
01:00:05,610 --> 01:00:09,290
let's go with 35, the 35
pound plates, you know,

931
01:00:09,810 --> 01:00:12,500
you can do with one hand.
You know what they should have.

932
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:17,030
They should have like a part
of the strong man competition.

933
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:18,980
So those little kettle balls there,

934
01:00:18,981 --> 01:00:23,980
they should have like little Kennedy
hats and each one of them gets a,

935
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:28,490
it's a stupid idea. You know that, that's
why I don't have a fucking show on TV.

936
01:00:29,090 --> 01:00:33,800
All right, let, let's, let's get the,
get the hype and the upcoming Gig. Um,

937
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,420
first of all,
I just was in our Raleigh,

938
01:00:35,421 --> 01:00:38,030
North Carolina at a good
night's comedy club.

939
01:00:38,060 --> 01:00:42,860
I want to thank everybody who came out to
the shows. I had a great time. And, uh,

940
01:00:42,861 --> 01:00:47,861
I got drunk every night down at the bar
downstairs and I watched my Celtics go

941
01:00:48,411 --> 01:00:52,340
up two games to none and a,
I'm not going to lie to you,

942
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:56,500
I didn't know how much one Celtic
game all year. I fucking hate pro hoop

943
01:00:58,090 --> 01:01:01,940
pro who is the worst?
Like it's just too God damn long.

944
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:06,110
You Watch college basketball.
It's exciting. The crowd's
into it and it's over.

945
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:10,730
It seems like it's over in an hour.
Pro Hoop with,

946
01:01:10,731 --> 01:01:14,960
with the fucking files and the timeouts.
And I mean, that's final five minutes,

947
01:01:16,350 --> 01:01:20,120
final five minutes. It takes like
45 minutes to play to the point.

948
01:01:20,121 --> 01:01:22,930
You don't even give a
shit anymore. But, um,

949
01:01:23,150 --> 01:01:26,030
I put to the test to Phil Jackson
for bitching about the files.

950
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:30,170
You know what I mean? Fucking
baby. I can tell you right now,

951
01:01:30,171 --> 01:01:32,150
if your gamma definitely
bet on the Lakers,

952
01:01:32,770 --> 01:01:36,020
you definitely bet on the Lakers on game
three because they are going to call

953
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:41,260
9,000 files on the fucking Celtics
because Phil Jackson's a fucking baby.

954
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:47,950
You know what I mean? Give
me a goddamn break. What?

955
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:50,810
What about that guy in the Lakers
who stop dribbling at half court?

956
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:54,470
Ran The west rest of the way and dunk
the ball and they didn't call travel.

957
01:01:54,471 --> 01:01:57,650
And what about that? Okay, you'll get
in calls to, I don't want to hear it.

958
01:01:59,050 --> 01:02:02,540
Um, and also the two, three,

959
01:02:02,541 --> 01:02:06,470
two playoff system is bullshit.
You know what I mean?

960
01:02:06,471 --> 01:02:09,890
You give home court advantage to the
fucking visitor through game five.

961
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:12,530
It keeps saying the Celtics
have home court. They don't.

962
01:02:12,531 --> 01:02:16,600
The next three games are in la. We get
to spend a fucking weak out there. Me,

963
01:02:16,610 --> 01:02:17,800
I had,
he made tension.

964
01:02:17,801 --> 01:02:22,801
Please would the person
who has the current next to
the deal jail please report

965
01:02:23,041 --> 01:02:26,280
to the fucking front office.
All right.

966
01:02:26,281 --> 01:02:29,970
I'm starting to talk way too
loud with Tourette's. Um,

967
01:02:32,250 --> 01:02:36,600
I dunno man. I thought the Lakers were
going to beat us and like six games.

968
01:02:36,601 --> 01:02:37,830
I thought they were going to crush us.

969
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:42,460
I'm really impressed Ray Allen
keeps getting his shots. Uh,

970
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:46,200
we're just going to have to weather the
storm. I think Colby is going to get 30,

971
01:02:46,201 --> 01:02:48,540
40 every game.
And if we can just somehow,

972
01:02:49,830 --> 01:02:53,310
whether that storm, uh, I dunno,

973
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:57,900
I still think it's going
seven games and uh, I dunno.

974
01:02:58,950 --> 01:03:00,930
It's gonna. It's gonna be
great. It's going to be great.

975
01:03:00,990 --> 01:03:05,370
I just don't watch ESPN any most fucking
jackass. So overhyped everything.

976
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,410
Look at this lady,
Jesus Christ.

977
01:03:07,411 --> 01:03:10,700
She's never committed a crime
in their life and gave my cat,

978
01:03:11,010 --> 01:03:13,980
I go to church every week.
I have a little tote bag.

979
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:18,390
It's like the egg and I pack the
exact perfect amount of clothes.

980
01:03:20,340 --> 01:03:24,450
I don't swallow. Um, man, I'm
getting crude on these podcasts.

981
01:03:24,451 --> 01:03:28,830
I got to stop with this. Okay. All
right. Well that was a good 25 minutes.

982
01:03:28,890 --> 01:03:29,610
They go visit.

983
01:03:29,610 --> 01:03:33,090
There's a good damn near half hour of us
silliness to get your week started off,

984
01:03:33,091 --> 01:03:37,950

have a, have a great week.

985
01:03:38,490 --> 01:03:42,750
And, uh, you know, something,
you know, just, just be happy.

986
01:03:42,751 --> 01:03:45,690
You don't travel for a living. And
Andy, if you travel for a living, ah,

987
01:03:45,730 --> 01:03:50,370

this shit is ridiculous. Um,

988
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:54,510

990
01:03:57,270 --> 01:04:01,320
First Time I ever did award show and uh,
I killed on it.

991
01:04:01,590 --> 01:04:05,430
Hopefully it will come
across that way on TV.

992
01:04:05,431 --> 01:04:07,860
You never know what
happens in post production,

993
01:04:08,670 --> 01:04:11,070
but I was really excited to do that.

994

999
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:33,060
That's all I can really remember for
the summer because I'm getting old.

01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:56,333
Oh my God.

1028
01:06:56,610 --> 01:06:59,640
I have to tell you the story.
So I'm flying,

1029
01:06:59,641 --> 01:07:02,470
so I do what have to sort of close show.
Um,

1030
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:05,260
and always working with Nick Kroll.

1031
01:07:05,290 --> 01:07:07,680
You're guaranteed you're going to
laugh your ass off. I'll fucking deck.

1032
01:07:07,681 --> 01:07:10,390
Can I kiss the kids ass? I
fucking love him. I think he's,

1033
01:07:10,510 --> 01:07:15,100
I think he's a fucking
genius. So anyways, um,

1034
01:07:15,190 --> 01:07:16,110
I go,

1035
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:17,480
okay.

1036
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:22,130
I go to the airport and I'm taking
the red eye, taking this 10 55 flight,

1037
01:07:22,131 --> 01:07:24,170
nine fucking stop.
Cause that's how I do it.

1038
01:07:25,110 --> 01:07:25,943
All right,

1039
01:07:27,090 --> 01:07:28,200
I'm on a good plane.

1040
01:07:28,230 --> 01:07:31,920
Why would I want to get off it and switch
and roll the dice and get on another

1041
01:07:31,921 --> 01:07:32,754
one.

1042
01:07:33,020 --> 01:07:33,400
Okay.

1043
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:37,130
You know, let's just
fucking get there. When it,

1044
01:07:37,131 --> 01:07:40,730
when I drive up to San Francisco,
I don't pull over and fucking, uh,

1045
01:07:40,790 --> 01:07:44,390
Burbank and then get hit one another
cup. We get it bill. All right.

1046
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:46,160
Okay.

1047
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:49,460
So I get on the fucking
plane, right? I use my miles,

1048
01:07:49,461 --> 01:07:52,160
bump myself up like a fancy
person. You know, maybe,

1049
01:07:52,190 --> 01:07:54,020
maybe I invented the cheesecake factory.

1050
01:07:54,021 --> 01:07:56,660
People are thinking and then they
see how I'm dressed and I go, oh no,

1051
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:00,310
he didn't invent the cheese cake factory.
Um,

1052
01:08:02,380 --> 01:08:05,740
and I go to go to sit down on my seat
and I go to set my bag down and I was

1053
01:08:05,741 --> 01:08:08,230
going to set it down right in front of
me and the Nice fellas sit next to me

1054
01:08:08,231 --> 01:08:09,670
cause why don't you stick
it in the middle, this room?

1055
01:08:09,730 --> 01:08:11,650
And he moved his bag out of
the way. I'm like, all right,

1056
01:08:11,651 --> 01:08:13,180
this guy's a solid dude or whatever.

1057
01:08:13,750 --> 01:08:17,960
And then all of a sudden the waitress
by a stewardess, whatever, she comes by,

1058
01:08:18,410 --> 01:08:21,020
flight attendant, whatever the
fuck you supposed to call them,

1059
01:08:21,021 --> 01:08:25,990
she comes up and she, uh, can I get you
gentlemen and Drake? And I was like, yeah,

1060
01:08:25,991 --> 01:08:29,510
I can, I get a, let me get a
water please. Ice or no ice. What?

1061
01:08:29,511 --> 01:08:31,010
However you make it.

1062
01:08:32,660 --> 01:08:35,330
Stop acting like it's a fucking
Martini. It's war, right?

1063
01:08:35,331 --> 01:08:39,080
Just give me a water
with ice. Thank you. Um,

1064
01:08:40,730 --> 01:08:45,710
and the, the guy next to me, he orders
it doers. Neat. No, I, no nothing.

1065
01:08:45,711 --> 01:08:50,360
Just put it in there. So they bring our
drinks. All right. And I'm really thirsty.

1066
01:08:50,361 --> 01:08:53,570
So I start sucking mine down
and he just throws his back.

1067
01:08:53,870 --> 01:08:58,430
Like it's nothing like fucking John Wayne
right before he's going to turn around

1068
01:08:58,790 --> 01:09:02,990
and beat up three guys, three
mustachioed guys in the 1930s. Right?

1069
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:08,510
So, um, I'm just sitting
there and everybody's getting
on the flight, you know,

1070
01:09:08,570 --> 01:09:11,790
and I'm looking around at the passengers,
you know,

1071
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:15,140
fucking doing whatever I'm doing and
all of a sudden the guy next to me,

1072
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:18,470
Mr doers goes to me. Uh, he
goes, excuse me? He goes,

1073
01:09:19,220 --> 01:09:23,550
are you afraid to fly? And I
looked at him, I was like, what?

1074
01:09:24,220 --> 01:09:28,600
He goes, are you afraid
to fly? And I go, no,

1075
01:09:29,140 --> 01:09:33,970
no, I'm not. And he goes, he goes, all
right, but you know, it's, he goes,

1076
01:09:33,971 --> 01:09:37,600
it's okay. It's okay to tell
me if you're afraid to fly.

1077
01:09:38,390 --> 01:09:39,223
Okay.

1078
01:09:40,070 --> 01:09:44,540
And it's immediately getting weird. And
I'm like, no, I'm not afraid to fly.

1079
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:47,840
And, and I'm thinking in my
head, wait, is he afraid to fly?

1080
01:09:48,650 --> 01:09:50,900
And that's why he's drinking
the way he just drank.

1081
01:09:51,530 --> 01:09:54,530
And now he's hoping that I'm going
to be afraid to fly. So he, you know,

1082
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:59,830
he just wants to open up. That's what
I'm thinking. And I got, I'm like, yeah,

1083
01:09:59,831 --> 01:10:01,060
no,
I'm not afraid to fly.

1084
01:10:02,620 --> 01:10:03,120
Yeah.

1085
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:06,180
And he won't leave it alone. He goes, all
right, cause you know, you're, you're,

1086
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:10,050
you're fidgeting,
you're looking around at other passengers.

1087
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:11,490
Okay.

1088
01:10:11,490 --> 01:10:15,990
And I'm sitting there looking at it like,
is this guy fucking serious? And I go,

1089
01:10:16,050 --> 01:10:19,920
no. I go, I'm not afraid to fly.
So now I'm like, fuck this guy.

1090
01:10:19,921 --> 01:10:22,260
I'm not talking this guy for the rest
of the flight. This guy's weird man.

1091
01:10:22,710 --> 01:10:23,221
It's like a 30.

1092
01:10:23,221 --> 01:10:28,170
Just get paint the pictures like
32 year old winery in shape,

1093
01:10:28,171 --> 01:10:29,790
but like,
why are we white dude,

1094
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:34,680
he's got a skully cap on
with fucking glasses. Um,

1095
01:10:36,570 --> 01:10:39,330
you know,
and uh,

1096
01:10:40,650 --> 01:10:41,210
okay.

1097
01:10:41,210 --> 01:10:42,150
He goes,
uh,

1098
01:10:42,650 --> 01:10:45,680
like there's like a minute of silence
and people still getting on the plane and

1099
01:10:45,681 --> 01:10:48,290
then he goes, hey, sorry
about that. So we, we just,

1100
01:10:48,291 --> 01:10:52,490
we just got off on the wrong foot. He's
like, my name's So-and-so. He goes,

1101
01:10:52,491 --> 01:10:57,200
what's your name? And then I'm thinking
in my head like, what's my name?

1102
01:10:57,260 --> 01:10:58,340
My name's frank.

1103
01:10:58,970 --> 01:11:02,120
I wanted to give them like a f by just
some reason I just wanted it's bill.

1104
01:11:02,810 --> 01:11:04,430
And he goes, oh, hey bill
Nico's nice to meet you.

1105
01:11:04,431 --> 01:11:09,080
So we shake hands and I'm just looking at,
I don't have any poker face.

1106
01:11:09,081 --> 01:11:11,240
I'm looking at the guy like,
what the fuck is your problem?

1107
01:11:11,241 --> 01:11:14,220
I'm not even trying to not,
I'm not trying to be pleasant.

1108
01:11:14,221 --> 01:11:18,450
I'm already done with this guy. So then
the guy goes, oh, hey bill. He goes,

1109
01:11:18,780 --> 01:11:21,060
why are you going to Indianapolis Bill?
Right.

1110
01:11:21,061 --> 01:11:23,100
Like he's fucking interrogating me and I,

1111
01:11:24,050 --> 01:11:24,520
okay.

1112
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:26,500
I'm like,
is this gonna fucking serious?

1113
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:29,080
And I start doing the
math in my head going,

1114
01:11:29,081 --> 01:11:32,050
when is this guy like an air marshal or
something? And I'm like, no he's not.

1115
01:11:32,051 --> 01:11:35,380
He's fucking slamming bows over here.
Fuck this guy.

1116
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:41,500
So I just go, I go, look, I don't, I
don't have to answer your questions.

1117
01:11:44,260 --> 01:11:48,910
That's it. And I just look
straight forward. He goes, okay,

1118
01:11:48,940 --> 01:11:53,230
now I'm concerned. Okay, I am
concerned and I'm looking at,

1119
01:11:53,231 --> 01:11:57,420
I'm like concerned about what he
goes, you're fidgeting your, you, you,

1120
01:11:57,430 --> 01:12:00,280
you have issues with other
passengers and blah blah blah blah.

1121
01:12:00,281 --> 01:12:03,490
He's such a Peyton like, like this. Like
he's been, I don't know what the fuck,

1122
01:12:03,491 --> 01:12:08,230
like psychologically breaking me down.
All right, so now at this, by this point,

1123
01:12:08,231 --> 01:12:13,231
they've closed the fucking the door to
the fuselage and we're starting to taxi.

1124
01:12:16,010 --> 01:12:16,843
Okay.

1125
01:12:17,270 --> 01:12:20,970
And I just finally look
at the guy and I go,

1126
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:22,820
okay,

1127
01:12:22,820 --> 01:12:25,370
I go, you know, I came up
with the five one point.

1128
01:12:25,371 --> 01:12:29,180
I literally stick my hand out cause he
kept saying I was nervous and I stick my

1129
01:12:29,181 --> 01:12:31,610
hand right in front of his
face and I hold it level.

1130
01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:36,380
Well that's what I did the
first time. Yeah. I hold it
level. I go, I'm not nervous.

1131
01:12:36,381 --> 01:12:39,920
And he goes, well, anybody can do that.
And that's when I was like, fuck this guy.

1132
01:12:39,921 --> 01:12:43,580
I'm not talking to the guy. Sorry. Fuck
this story up. Then Denny Denny came back,

1133
01:12:43,581 --> 01:12:47,780
got my name. Now he's going, why are
you going to Indianapolis? And I find,

1134
01:12:47,781 --> 01:12:52,640
look at them. I say, listen pal, I'm
drinking waters. You're drinking doers.

1135
01:12:52,970 --> 01:12:56,870
Okay, there's no issue over here.
And then he goes, it wasn't doers.

1136
01:12:56,871 --> 01:13:00,440
What she gave me wasn't doers really.
What was it? Some sort of spy juice.

1137
01:13:00,530 --> 01:13:02,960
You fucking jerk off this point.

1138
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:07,790
I want to punch him right through his
fucking stupid wirey glasses. Right?

1139
01:13:09,140 --> 01:13:11,510
So he's going like,

1140
01:13:11,511 --> 01:13:14,140
you look around hostels and I said
something that just ticked him off.

1141
01:13:14,141 --> 01:13:16,520
I was just you that dude I got, I don't
have to answer your questions. All right,

1142
01:13:16,521 --> 01:13:20,660
leave me alone. And then he
goes, uh, he goes to, he goes,
he starts going like, okay,

1143
01:13:20,661 --> 01:13:24,410
now I am really concerned right now. He
goes, why are you going to Indianapolis?

1144
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:26,030
And I just look at him.
You know what I start doing?

1145
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:28,280
I start doing like this Ryan Gosling,

1146
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,810
you know that little smirk that fucking
Mona Lisa smile he has is his smarts his

1147
01:13:32,811 --> 01:13:36,560
way through all this fucking movies.
I do go. I go full on Ryan Gosling.

1148
01:13:36,590 --> 01:13:40,730
Now I'm not talking to this guy and I
just keep looking at him and I give them

1149
01:13:40,731 --> 01:13:44,420
that little half was smart and I
just shake my head. That's my game.

1150
01:13:44,421 --> 01:13:46,550
Now that's,
this is Mike.

1151
01:13:46,580 --> 01:13:49,910
It's like if you're going to be a Dick
Right now with your fucking delusional

1152
01:13:49,911 --> 01:13:52,220
authority, right? That
you're going to like,

1153
01:13:52,221 --> 01:13:56,630
we're in fucking Guantanamo and you've got
to waterboard me. Ah, there's no water.

1154
01:13:56,660 --> 01:13:59,840
There's no board. Go Fuck
Yourself. Here's my smart,

1155
01:13:59,930 --> 01:14:02,960
and I'm just going to shake my head at
you like you're a fucking pathetic human

1156
01:14:02,961 --> 01:14:07,010
being. This is what I'm doing, right? And
this is the funny thing. I'm such a Dick.

1157
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:08,990
All I have to say to the guys,
I'm a comedian,

1158
01:14:09,470 --> 01:14:12,580
I'm going to do a sold out show there
and that would make them back off,

1159
01:14:12,790 --> 01:14:16,390
but I'm a dick. I'm like, fuck this
guy. I want to see where this is going.

1160
01:14:17,140 --> 01:14:20,110
So now he's all fucking amped
up and he starts droppingF ,

1161
01:14:21,070 --> 01:14:23,680
you know she's saying the
f word. He sitting there
going, if you don't, he goes,

1162
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:25,480
you don't fucking answer
my question right fucking.

1163
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:27,460
Now I'm going to hit that
call button was sitting there,

1164
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:29,440
taxi and down the fucking getting in line,

1165
01:14:30,220 --> 01:14:32,890
I'm going to fucking hit this fucking
button if you blah blah, blah, blah, blah.

1166
01:14:32,980 --> 01:14:34,420
And I'm just fucking Mona Lisa.

1167
01:14:34,421 --> 01:14:38,860
Smile smirk in just shaking my head
like you are a fucking retard, right?

1168
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:41,560
So now he sees saying the f word so much.

1169
01:14:41,710 --> 01:14:45,700
The lady who's sitting in
front of me diagonally in
front, right in front of him,

1170
01:14:45,701 --> 01:14:49,660
turns around and looks at us, and
now my heart's racing. I'm like,

1171
01:14:49,661 --> 01:14:52,240
where's this going?
This is going to be great.

1172
01:14:52,390 --> 01:14:55,390
I am a hundred percent fucking innocent.
This guy's drunk,

1173
01:14:55,510 --> 01:15:00,160
and I think he's going to hit that button.
He's going to hit that button.

1174
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:03,400
What's going to happen? Right? I want
to see what the pilot looks like.

1175
01:15:03,550 --> 01:15:07,030
Let's see where the fuck this is going,
right? So he goes, you'll fuck you.

1176
01:15:07,180 --> 01:15:09,520
He starts eating such bringing
his hand up to the button going,

1177
01:15:09,521 --> 01:15:11,950
I'm going to hit that button.
You don't have to go fucking do it.

1178
01:15:12,010 --> 01:15:14,770
I'll hit that button and I'm sitting there
smirking and I'm thinking in my head,

1179
01:15:14,771 --> 01:15:17,260
go ahead and hit the fucking button.
Let's see what happens.

1180
01:15:17,590 --> 01:15:19,180
Let's see what happens. Right? So finally,

1181
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:22,270
now he wants to hit the button
and he can't fucking find it,

1182
01:15:22,420 --> 01:15:25,870
and it's an in defense of him. I couldn't
find it either. I was looking up there,

1183
01:15:25,871 --> 01:15:28,360
I half wanted to hit it myself.
Then he finally,

1184
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:33,010
he finally finds it and he hits it right?
And now I'm just like,

1185
01:15:33,011 --> 01:15:37,220
Holy Shit, what's going to happen? And
he's sitting there going, yeah, Huh,

1186
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:39,820
you want to fucking play this game and
you want to fucking play this game?

1187
01:15:40,330 --> 01:15:41,410
And I was surprised.

1188
01:15:41,411 --> 01:15:45,400
I mean it took like fucking like 30
seconds before a flight attendant,

1189
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:49,570
the one who gave him the booze,
which evidently wasn't booze comes over.

1190
01:15:50,020 --> 01:15:53,290
And at this point we're like doing
that shit where we're behind the plane,

1191
01:15:53,291 --> 01:15:54,700
we're almost ready to take off,

1192
01:15:54,701 --> 01:15:56,480
like we're pulling up and
then stop and pull it up and,

1193
01:15:56,481 --> 01:15:59,680
and stopping as planes are
taking off. So she goes, yeah,

1194
01:15:59,681 --> 01:16:01,480
what's the problem over
here? And he goes, ah,

1195
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:04,540
I'm not comfortable to fly with
this guy. This guy, he's fidgeting,

1196
01:16:04,630 --> 01:16:07,000
he's looking around at other fucking
people, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1197
01:16:07,001 --> 01:16:08,050
He's doing all this thing right?

1198
01:16:08,051 --> 01:16:11,530
And then the stewardess looks at me and
I'm just sitting there fucking my little

1199
01:16:11,531 --> 01:16:11,921
smart,

1200
01:16:11,921 --> 01:16:15,310
just shaking my head and I just looking
at this dude just shaking my head like,

1201
01:16:15,311 --> 01:16:18,640
this guy's out of his fucking mind.
I don't say a word,

1202
01:16:19,270 --> 01:16:22,870
and this guy goes on and on and on about
his fucking psycho babble about how I'm

1203
01:16:22,871 --> 01:16:23,950
the security risk.

1204
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:29,920
So she goes to, so she goes, okay. Um,

1205
01:16:30,250 --> 01:16:33,790
any other passengers?
Have you noticed anything?

1206
01:16:33,791 --> 01:16:35,650
She's talking to everybody first class.
This

1207
01:16:39,860 --> 01:16:40,060
is,

1208
01:16:40,060 --> 01:16:45,060
anybody noticed anything odd about this
guy and the lady who was sitting right

1209
01:16:45,671 --> 01:16:48,910
in front of the dude diagonally from
me turns around. She goes, yeah,

1210
01:16:48,911 --> 01:16:52,750
I've been listening to this guy,
bright berating this other passenger.

1211
01:16:53,110 --> 01:16:57,460
She's on my side and I haven't
said a fucking word. This is great.

1212
01:16:57,810 --> 01:16:59,650
And I'm just sitting there smirking.

1213
01:16:59,660 --> 01:17:02,710
Then they'll let students looks at
me and I shrugged my shoulders like,

1214
01:17:02,711 --> 01:17:05,500
I don't know what to tell you.
It's a finally she said, sir,

1215
01:17:05,530 --> 01:17:09,230
do you have anything to add to
this? And I just said, look,

1216
01:17:09,650 --> 01:17:14,180
I'm just a guy trying to go to
Indianapolis. This guy over here,

1217
01:17:14,181 --> 01:17:17,360
he starts slamming his doors. I kind
of felt like a rat when I said that.

1218
01:17:17,361 --> 01:17:20,480
I go slamming his doors. Next thing you
know, he's dropping the F bomb to me.

1219
01:17:20,660 --> 01:17:25,490
Then I'm thinking, oh fuck. I just
said bomb, right? Fortunately,

1220
01:17:25,491 --> 01:17:30,230
nothing happens. So now another fucking
the male stewardess comes over right now,

1221
01:17:30,231 --> 01:17:31,640
he's going like,
what's going on?

1222
01:17:32,270 --> 01:17:35,600
And the captain of the fucking now at
this point we've pulled over in the plane,

1223
01:17:35,601 --> 01:17:36,440
has stopped.

1224
01:17:37,380 --> 01:17:37,870
Okay.

1225
01:17:37,870 --> 01:17:42,080
250 people trying to get to Indianapolis
and jerk off over here who can hold

1226
01:17:42,081 --> 01:17:46,450
this fucking alcohol who just
watched a person of interest every,

1227
01:17:46,451 --> 01:17:50,800
every August. Evidently I have no
fucking idea. Now the plane is stopped,

1228
01:17:51,310 --> 01:17:52,780
is fucking jerk off,

1229
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:57,220
has stopped the plane
interrogating a Goddamn comedian.

1230
01:17:57,310 --> 01:18:01,240
Like I'm in the fucking Taliban and
like he works for the CIA, right?

1231
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:03,060
So now we're just sitting there

1232
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:09,070
and the captain is up front in the plane,

1233
01:18:09,071 --> 01:18:13,090
like saying to the stewards
is going basically relaying,

1234
01:18:13,091 --> 01:18:14,980
do I really have to
fucking come back there?

1235
01:18:15,310 --> 01:18:18,370
This is the last flight of the night.
Is it really a God damn problem?

1236
01:18:18,490 --> 01:18:22,690
And that was the vibe. And they finally
said to the doe, sit next to me,

1237
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:24,730
are you going to be okay to fly with him?

1238
01:18:25,030 --> 01:18:30,030
And at that point it appeased his fucking
ego that he was somehow in control.

1239
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:35,020
And he goes like, you know what? Okay,
it's fine. It's fine. It'll be fine.

1240
01:18:35,410 --> 01:18:36,243
It'll be fine.

1241
01:18:37,030 --> 01:18:37,460
Yeah.

1242
01:18:37,460 --> 01:18:42,380
So they go, okay. So now the plane's
going again and now we're now,

1243
01:18:42,381 --> 01:18:44,750
we fucking come around and
he's sitting there fucking,

1244
01:18:44,751 --> 01:18:48,750
he's in my ear and at this point I
am la like to fucking laugh. He him,

1245
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:52,790
me doing the podcast, that's what I'm
doing. And he's sitting there going, I,

1246
01:18:52,820 --> 01:18:55,640
he goes, you know what? I'm glad.
I'm glad. I hope you fucking do.

1247
01:18:55,641 --> 01:18:58,900
I hope you fucking try something. I'll be
fucking try something. One more update.

1248
01:18:58,910 --> 01:19:00,260
I really hope you fucking try something.

1249
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:04,610
And I'm just fucking like gut bust
and laughing, shaking it. Like,

1250
01:19:04,611 --> 01:19:07,970
what are you going to fucking do to me?
What are you gonna do to me?

1251
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:11,880
How are you going to punch me in the face?
You fucking winery jackass.

1252
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:16,940
You get fucking glasses on. You
know, that's a federal offense.

1253
01:19:16,970 --> 01:19:20,120
You're going to go to jail if you do
that or something. I Dunno what, right.

1254
01:19:20,900 --> 01:19:23,930
So I'm just in a fucking laughing
at the guy going, I actually,

1255
01:19:23,931 --> 01:19:28,340
at one point I put my fucking
little I pill thing on. Do you know,

1256
01:19:28,341 --> 01:19:31,370
like I'm going to sleep.
Oh, I had that out too.

1257
01:19:31,371 --> 01:19:33,140
When the stewardess was talking to me.
I was like,

1258
01:19:33,141 --> 01:19:37,070
putting it on is this total mind fuck.
Like I don't know what this guy is.

1259
01:19:37,071 --> 01:19:41,750
I'm just trying to go to Indianapolis.
I'm going to sleep. And um, so I got,

1260
01:19:41,780 --> 01:19:46,010
I got my fucking eye thing on, right
as he's sitting there threatening me,

1261
01:19:46,011 --> 01:19:48,410
just I was going with total passive
aggressive. It's like, dude,

1262
01:19:48,411 --> 01:19:52,700
I'm so not concerned with
you. I'm literally putting
a blindfold on. All right,

1263
01:19:53,850 --> 01:19:58,850
so this fucking guy, he
starts going, he goes, yeah.

1264
01:19:58,910 --> 01:20:01,560
He goes, you think you're fucking one
this, you fucking won this. He goes, my,

1265
01:20:01,561 --> 01:20:03,760
you know, my dad is my dad.
He started saying his dad,

1266
01:20:03,761 --> 01:20:07,500
some major CEO in Indianapolis, doesn't
sound like a fucking made up story.

1267
01:20:07,501 --> 01:20:09,630
I swear to God, this is
all true. He Goes, Mike,

1268
01:20:09,631 --> 01:20:14,550
my dad is such a major CEO in Indianapolis
and I'll have you fucking arrested.

1269
01:20:14,670 --> 01:20:15,990
And The lady turns around again.

1270
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:18,690
How have you fucking rested the
second weekend on the ground?

1271
01:20:18,691 --> 01:20:20,910
I'm thinking like for what?
For what?

1272
01:20:21,710 --> 01:20:22,110
Okay,

1273
01:20:22,110 --> 01:20:26,970
sitting here, you fucking loser.
Learn how to hold your alcohol. Right.

1274
01:20:26,971 --> 01:20:30,870
And he starts describing the view that
I'm going to have when I go to jail,

1275
01:20:30,871 --> 01:20:34,020
like some fucking law and order
episode. Oh, you're going to love it.

1276
01:20:34,170 --> 01:20:36,990
You'll be able to see Lucas oil
field in battered by the bar.

1277
01:20:37,020 --> 01:20:41,160
And I'm just sitting there cracking up
laughing and then there's this pause,

1278
01:20:41,161 --> 01:20:45,930
right? And I'm thinking finally he finally
shut the fuck up. It's like a three,

1279
01:20:45,931 --> 01:20:49,020
four minute pause. He finally just gave
up because I wasn't giving them anything.

1280
01:20:49,021 --> 01:20:52,710
I was just laughing and shaking my head.
I was being a dick to him.

1281
01:20:52,711 --> 01:20:54,210
I was cause I was enjoying it.

1282
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:57,120
And then there was like a three minute
pause and then all of a sudden he just

1283
01:20:57,121 --> 01:21:00,780
goes,
why are you going to Indianapolis Bill?

1284
01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:11,510
So we're like 20 minutes into the flight
and am I going to be honest? He's,

1285
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:16,520
my adrenaline was so going during all
of that because I knew I didn't do

1286
01:21:16,891 --> 01:21:17,581
anything wrong,

1287
01:21:17,581 --> 01:21:20,880
but I thought we were literally going
to go back and there was going to be

1288
01:21:20,881 --> 01:21:23,190
fucking cops there. And
if like, if, if, if,

1289
01:21:23,610 --> 01:21:28,610
if the fucking stewardess or the pilot
asked me who I am and where I'm going,

1290
01:21:29,970 --> 01:21:34,260
I'm going to tell him I respect your
authority. You're just some, Gee, I don't,

1291
01:21:34,380 --> 01:21:38,640
you don't have any fucking authority.
I don't have to answer your questions.

1292
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:41,100
It was pro was one of the most

1293
01:21:43,130 --> 01:21:46,010
fun experiences I've ever
had with another human being.

1294
01:21:46,011 --> 01:21:49,520
Like when somebody thinks that they
have power and you know, they don't,

1295
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:55,240
and all they can do is try just keep
bluffing and raising their voice and start

1296
01:21:55,731 --> 01:21:58,280
cursing at you.
And if you just start laughing at them,

1297
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:01,280
the look on their face
is fucking priceless.

1298
01:22:02,350 --> 01:22:03,183
So

1299
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:08,130
blessing. He said, he said, why are
you going to Indianapolis Bill? Right.

1300
01:22:08,131 --> 01:22:12,240
And I fucking started howling,
just fucking holding my stomach,

1301
01:22:12,241 --> 01:22:13,230
shaking my head

1302
01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:17,730
and with my fucking eye
pillow thing on right.

1303
01:22:18,870 --> 01:22:22,170
And I know I'm going to get a ton of
shit that I wear one of those eye,

1304
01:22:22,290 --> 01:22:23,580
they're fucking underrated.

1305
01:22:23,850 --> 01:22:26,910
Get the one at Brookstone where it's
literally a pillow. I'm telling you,

1306
01:22:26,940 --> 01:22:30,300
you could fall asleep 12 noon
facing the sun. It's awesome.

1307
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:35,320
So anyways, like after he
asked me what, what, you know,

1308
01:22:35,340 --> 01:22:37,860
where are you going bill? You're
like, there was like a 10 minute,

1309
01:22:37,890 --> 01:22:42,690
like probably 10 minutes had gone by and
I can't fucking sleep because it's so

1310
01:22:42,691 --> 01:22:45,990
fun. And to me I can't wait to
tell the story. Every comic I know,

1311
01:22:46,770 --> 01:22:50,520
I can't wait to try it on stage to
see if it's funny or whatever. Uh,

1312
01:22:50,521 --> 01:22:53,850
so finally I just like our fucking,
maybe I'll just get on my computer and I

1313
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:58,100
bring up my pillow and I like,

1314
01:22:58,101 --> 01:23:00,740
I got to look at the guy cause I
know he's fucking staring at me,

1315
01:23:00,741 --> 01:23:04,040
waiting for me to do something right.
So I lifted up,

1316
01:23:04,310 --> 01:23:08,440
I get my fucking Lisa smile going
and I look over at the guy and dude,

1317
01:23:08,441 --> 01:23:10,330
he is fucking passed out.

1318
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:15,970
He looked like he got shot.

1319
01:23:16,390 --> 01:23:21,310
He was sitting there like his head was
just hanging straight down and anytime

1320
01:23:21,311 --> 01:23:22,840
the plane move like his head was,

1321
01:23:22,841 --> 01:23:27,430
I mean he looked like he got knocked
out for the rest of the fucking flight.

1322
01:23:28,660 --> 01:23:33,340
All fucking uh oh. What's Matt
Damon's character? Jack Ryan.

1323
01:23:33,341 --> 01:23:38,230
Hold fucking Jack Ryan over here.
It's just, you know the sky marshal,

1324
01:23:39,130 --> 01:23:41,740
the fucking bows bag and God
knows what else he was on.

1325
01:23:41,770 --> 01:23:46,420
He was just completely out passed out
for the rest of the fucking flight.

1326
01:23:47,410 --> 01:23:51,070
And this is why I want you to dick. I am.
I was having so much fun with this guy.

1327
01:23:51,071 --> 01:23:52,570
I start,
I can't sleep.

1328
01:23:53,530 --> 01:23:58,530
So I start slamming waters because I want
to have to get up and take a piss just

1329
01:23:59,051 --> 01:24:03,010
to see if this guy's going to freak out
because this security risk is getting up

1330
01:24:03,250 --> 01:24:06,730
and this is, the joke was on me.
He never regained consciousness.

1331
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:10,090
And then I really had to take a Piss,
but I'm such a stubborn fuck.

1332
01:24:10,270 --> 01:24:13,960
I was holding it because I wanted to
make sure he was awake when I got up,

1333
01:24:14,530 --> 01:24:17,590
cause I was going to give him a little
smirk and then I was going to get out to

1334
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:22,300
see he hit the call button
again. Um, but he did,

1335
01:24:22,330 --> 01:24:26,250
he didn't wake up till
we hit the ground and um,

1336
01:24:27,620 --> 01:24:29,870
and then it's funny, then he woke
up and it was like four hours later.

1337
01:24:29,871 --> 01:24:33,620
So now he had kind of slept off,
whatever the fuck this guy was on. Okay.

1338
01:24:34,550 --> 01:24:37,310
And I'm sitting there SmartQ and
wait for the guy to start talking.

1339
01:24:37,311 --> 01:24:39,800
I mean he won't look at me and I,

1340
01:24:39,801 --> 01:24:43,190
and I think at that point
he kind of fucking realize
that maybe he got a little,

1341
01:24:43,191 --> 01:24:46,160
uh,
a little extra little too patriotic.

1342
01:24:47,270 --> 01:24:49,460
So we stop,

1343
01:24:50,330 --> 01:24:52,430
we stopped at the gate and
everything and we're going to get up.

1344
01:24:52,431 --> 01:24:53,750
So I grabbed my shit.

1345
01:24:53,810 --> 01:24:57,680
I get up and I'm just kinda looking
at him and he won't look at me.

1346
01:24:57,860 --> 01:24:59,900
And then the lady who was
sitting in front of me,

1347
01:25:00,670 --> 01:25:03,840
I had this big smile on her face. She
goes, hi. She goes, how are you doing?

1348
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:06,020
I don't want it good. I go, there
I go. That was an interesting one.

1349
01:25:06,021 --> 01:25:09,470
And I said it really loud. So the
guy heard and he didn't say anything,

1350
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:13,160
and this is what he did
to try to save face.

1351
01:25:13,580 --> 01:25:17,210
His pillow was kind of stuck behind this
kind of stuck behind his shoulder and

1352
01:25:17,211 --> 01:25:20,510
like a weird place.
So he was frustrated with it.

1353
01:25:20,511 --> 01:25:24,490
So he ripped it out from behind him and
kind of threw it down on the floor when

1354
01:25:25,850 --> 01:25:30,830
he tried to do some caveman grunt to try
to still have some sort of, yeah. Uh,

1355
01:25:32,020 --> 01:25:36,800
I don't know what, so, so that was
my flight to Indianapolis people.

1356
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:42,400
Um, you know what, how, how far into the
fucking podcast down here. It was a long,

1357
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:43,820
that was a long fucking story.

1358
01:27:43,380 --> 01:27:44,213
Yeah.

1359
01:29:57,140 --> 01:29:57,973
Okay.

1360
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,940
I
will.
