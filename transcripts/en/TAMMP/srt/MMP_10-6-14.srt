1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:03,180
Hey,
what's going on is bill burn?

2
00:00:03,181 --> 00:00:06,300
It's the Monday morning
podcasts about the October six,

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,960
2014 hello?
It's me.

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:15,270
I haven't podcast for a long,
long time.

5
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:21,470
Actually it was last Monday
in the morning due to Ooh,

6
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:24,980
it's important too.

7
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,090
Hey,

8
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:32,280
what's going on? How are
Ya? Um, as you can tell,

9
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:37,050
I screamed and yelled all this fucking
weekend and that only means one thing. Oh,

10
00:00:37,051 --> 00:00:40,200
Billy red face had a standup gig.

11
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,920
If you're new to my podcast,
well why is your voice gets raspy?

12
00:00:43,921 --> 00:00:46,740
FTF His show because I don't
know how to write a joke.

13
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,330
So what I have to do is I have
to scream my ideas. I asked,

14
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,980
I have to use the f word right and
left and left and right. You know,

15
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,440
and then make silly faces.
I was actually up in San Francisco.

16
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,300
If you're going to San
Fran [inaudible] goal,

17
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:10,670
um, I'm going to put some
flowers in your hair. Yeah.

18
00:01:10,671 --> 00:01:14,340
And some change in your pockets for the
fucking 9,000 homeless people that have

19
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:19,080
up there. Jesus Christ just inundated
with them. You know, it was great.

20
00:01:19,081 --> 00:01:23,150
It was towards the end of the
month and two great things. Wait,

21
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:23,941
that doesn't make sense.

22
00:01:23,941 --> 00:01:26,910
The beginning of the month was back when
you wouldn't see the homeless people in

23
00:01:26,911 --> 00:01:31,530
San Francisco because they actually gave
them a stipend, which was a, you know,

24
00:01:31,531 --> 00:01:35,490
a little bit of money so they could
get them off the fucking streets.

25
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,660
You know, like these fucking
people know how to handle money.

26
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,890
They knew how to handle money. They
wouldn't have been homeless. Hey,

27
00:01:43,891 --> 00:01:48,150
this guy sucks at math. I know. Let's
give them an Algebra book. All right,

28
00:01:48,151 --> 00:01:50,460
see a fella.
Good luck with that.

29
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:56,060
We're not going to teach you on any
level. That's not even true. That's,

30
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:59,250
that's even worse that, that, that
example doesn't even make sense.

31
00:01:59,251 --> 00:02:00,570
That wasn't the correct example.

32
00:02:00,571 --> 00:02:05,250
Because if somebody sucks with money
and you just give them money, you know,

33
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,500
so he sucks at math.
He give him an Algebra book.

34
00:02:07,501 --> 00:02:11,580
They could actually learn about math.
How do you just give somebody some math,

35
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,360
give him a bag and numbers, whatever you
want. You know what I'm trying to say?

36
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,330
All right.
And even if you don't,

37
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,720
I don't know that you don't because
you can't call into to this show.

38
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:27,810
All right.
The phone lines,

39
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:32,850
the nonexistent phone
lines cannot light up. I'm

40
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:37,770
trying to write down in Alabama, so I
don't forget to talk about them this week.

41
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:42,480
Alabama,
the dream ended this weekend.

42
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,910
Um,
anyway,

43
00:02:44,911 --> 00:02:49,911
so I was up there in San Francisco and I
was working Davies Symphony Hall and a,

44
00:02:51,341 --> 00:02:53,580
I had a great time.
And you know,

45
00:02:53,581 --> 00:02:58,160
my favorite part of the fucking weekend
was j law had Jason Lawhead Rosebowl

46
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:01,600
tailgate legend Jason Law head,
uh,

47
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:05,200
before he's gonna bring me out.
He's like,

48
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:06,450
okay.

49
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:07,690
He's like,
what do you want to have fast?

50
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,000
She turned on the
fucking air conditioning.

51
00:03:09,001 --> 00:03:13,680
Can he hear that stupid thing rattling?
I tried to tell her, you know,

52
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,020
you try to tell your wife
you don't want something.

53
00:03:16,021 --> 00:03:19,290
And what did they fucking do it anyways?
Because they think that they know.

54
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:23,210
I know what's good for him. I
know it's good from, hang on,

55
00:03:23,211 --> 00:03:24,650
I gotta shut this fucking thing off.

56
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,833
Yeah.

57
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:31,950
All right. I'm back. Unfucking
believable. I swear to God they they,

58
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:35,850
you know for all their bitch moaning
and complaining they do on all those,

59
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,820
those fucking Yap Yap and shows their,
you know,

60
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:42,600
I know I was what's better than
one woman running her? Yap.

61
00:03:42,601 --> 00:03:45,810
Well let's get three others and have
them all sit around with their shoes,

62
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,690
you know. Yap, Yap, Yap.

63
00:03:48,691 --> 00:03:52,230
And about all the fucking shit that's
going on are those shows by the way,

64
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,670
the view,

65
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:57,990
the talk and all those are those like
women's versions of like a guy watching

66
00:03:57,991 --> 00:04:00,210
those stupid pregame NFL shows,

67
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,060
you know rather than four broads,

68
00:04:03,061 --> 00:04:06,210
you get fucking four
meathead guys in their suits.

69
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:07,770
Okay.

70
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:10,200
You know it's,
it's a bit of bubble screen.

71
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:16,350
John Gruden says fucking bubble screen.
One more goddamn time this fucking week.

72
00:04:16,351 --> 00:04:19,970
I got it. It's a bubble screen.
There's a screen and there's a

73
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,540
bubble and he's got an option and they're
going to fucking have the Lyman go

74
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:26,660
this way and see what their doors
you. I took her to abroad broad. Okay,

75
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,840
now you guys just saw option over here.
If he wants to,

76
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:33,120
we could throw it burger
Gertrude to keep a fork, a ball.

77
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:37,230
And you could try to run it with
your cues to Corny book. Her's door.

78
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:42,250
Understood were to make the decision to
Eagle with loose the pool or to hold on

79
00:04:42,271 --> 00:04:45,080
to it. Oh, tell you work when you,
when you start to join no dirt, dirt.

80
00:04:45,081 --> 00:04:48,440
When good things will be helping
it. The, this you don't put pool.

81
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,553
Um,

82
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,140
so just all of that dumb shit that I
just fucking said that I don't need to

83
00:04:56,141 --> 00:04:59,400
know.
I don't need to know any of that.

84
00:04:59,401 --> 00:05:03,130
I don't need to know what a fucking
bubble screen is to watch a God damn gay.

85
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:06,920
It's a hot read. It's a hot read or
you, yeah, it comes up in the line.

86
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:08,640
It's a fucking hot.
Is it a heart rate?

87
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,350
It's a hot read. I can't, it just be,

88
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:19,700
he goes up to the line and if he sees
something, yeah, let's fucking do it.

89
00:05:19,701 --> 00:05:21,860
And if he doesn't,
let's just stick with the play.

90
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:27,370
It's a hot read on a bubble
screen in a cupboard to tango,

91
00:05:28,251 --> 00:05:32,210
Sierra Alpha. Um, anyways,

92
00:05:32,211 --> 00:05:36,860
so I'm up there in San
Fransisco and for once

93
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,910
every, I was up there
Friday, Saturday and Sunday,

94
00:05:41,911 --> 00:05:46,350
and it was beautiful weather
every single day. 85 degrees,

95
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:51,060
80 degrees, global warming
at its finest. Right?

96
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:56,130
This is how miserable the fucking
weather is in San Francisco.

97
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:57,323
They,

98
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:03,160
most places don't have air conditioning
because they don't fucking need it.

99
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:07,250
They're in California and they
don't need air conditioning.

100
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:08,340
Okay.

101
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,173
All right.

102
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:13,420
Why don't you wrap your little fucking
podcasting listening brain around that?

103
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,433
Alright.

104
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:19,660
I'm not sure when you think about a
California goes pretty much almost the

105
00:06:19,661 --> 00:06:20,620
entire coast

106
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:26,170
of the west coast of the continental
United States, the lower 48. Anyways,

107
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:30,290
so I guess at some point,
right?

108
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:33,030
You gotta be as far north is like Wyoming.

109
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:35,600
I know they get snow,

110
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,070
but I know people in Wyoming got
to have fucking air conditioning.

111
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:41,930
Yeah.

112
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:43,880
Does anybody in Wyoming listen to this?

113
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:49,670
You out there right now on a horse,
just sitting there staring a cattle,

114
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,740
trying to figure out what's out there
that keeps killing one or your cows every

115
00:06:54,741 --> 00:06:55,910
fucking eight days.

116
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,070
Okay.

117
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:00,700
Sitting there arguing with your buddies.
Look at the [inaudible] Lou,

118
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,310
the bite marks there.
I ain't no fucking coyote.

119
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:08,830
Coyote can't kill fucking dumb bitch.

120
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:11,860
You know you get that from
you get that from your mother.

121
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:16,970
I knew she was fucking dumb the moment
I looked down at her boots. All right,

122
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:21,340
butter titch wire hanging out.
My favorite song was on the Jukebox,

123
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:25,690
so I said fuck it. I ain't got
nothing in the back of my truck.

124
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:30,080
I layered her down there, stick my
cores, lied on her forehead and I'll,

125
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,990
I'll tell you I'm a put a rod in there.

126
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,720
Well next thing you know,
she starts calling me up.

127
00:07:38,721 --> 00:07:41,570
All my SAP come in,
they're good buddy.

128
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:46,820
My stomach's getting bigger and I ain't
been eating shit. I faked I'm pregnant.

129
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,990
And I'm like, why ain't this the
sum bitch? All right, let us,

130
00:07:50,991 --> 00:07:54,770
Jesus is coming back again as a baby.
It must be mine.

131
00:07:55,100 --> 00:08:00,100
Say you are here you are half a fucking
stupid telling me that a goddamn coyote

132
00:08:03,311 --> 00:08:04,870
killed his fucking cow.

133
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,580
I will tell you one more time
then it was a pack of wolves.

134
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:14,020
And if you keep having that dumb look
on your face, I swear to fucking God,

135
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,460
I'm a shoot you on my own God
damn property. Is that understood?

136
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,830
Oh, quit your crying and
you're just like your mother.

137
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:29,010
If you're out there in Wyoming.
All right.

138
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:34,950
Yeah, I know you got air conditioning.
You might not have teeth,

139
00:08:34,951 --> 00:08:37,380
but I know you have Eric and I'm sorry.
Why do I keep doing this?

140
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:39,900
You know what's funny about Wyoming?
Um,

141
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:44,070
a lot of it is fucking rich people
who've gone out there and bought property

142
00:08:44,071 --> 00:08:47,010
like Ted fucking Turner,

143
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:52,990
like Ted Turner I think can ride his horse
from the border of the United States,

144
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,083
Mexico

145
00:08:56,510 --> 00:09:00,490
and ride his fucking horse all
the way up to Canada. Please.

146
00:09:00,491 --> 00:09:04,970
That's his goal without ever not
being on his own property. You know,

147
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,070
and like most driven men,

148
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,060
at any point does he even think about
the fucking horse that does not want to

149
00:09:11,061 --> 00:09:16,061
walk Gallup or trot all the things
that horses do shit in public.

150
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:21,920
It doesn't want to do
it.

151
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:23,360
Doesn't want to do that.

152
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:25,800
Okay.

153
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,710
They never wanted you on
its back to begin with.

154
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,380
Why the fuck would it
want you on its back?

155
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:32,840
Yeah.

156
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,720
Jesus Christ. You're Ted Turner.
You can't afford a robot horse.

157
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:40,150
Hi with your jeopardy mustache.

158
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:46,180
Having said all that great investment,
I got to tell you that tech journey,

159
00:09:46,181 --> 00:09:50,750
you know when it comes to money,
he understands it. You know,

160
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:54,980
it'd be great if Ted Turner just walked
up to a homeless guy and rather than

161
00:09:54,981 --> 00:09:59,810
explain money to him,
just started yelling at him about money,

162
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:02,540
dressing them down.
You know,

163
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:08,230
like a head coach pissed
off at his fucking starting
quarterback who's making a

164
00:10:08,301 --> 00:10:12,080
bunch of mistakes. Right. And his job
is like right on the bubble. You know,

165
00:10:12,081 --> 00:10:13,850
if he just came walking
up to the homeless guy,

166
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:19,280
throws a fucking clipboard down at
his feet after he sees the guy by some

167
00:10:19,281 --> 00:10:21,080
fucking heroin with a bunch of nickels.

168
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:22,750
Okay.

169
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,480
I don't fucking, I don't got an immediate
FGL again. All right. I'm sorry.

170
00:10:25,481 --> 00:10:29,500
I just set up a total comedy scenario
and now I'm baling. All right.

171
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:32,410
I'm fucking rolling right out of it.
You know what? I can't do a Ted Turner.

172
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:34,210
I even know what he sounds like.

173
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:36,410
Okay.

174
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:38,780
I just, when I picture him,
I picture Norm Mcdonald.

175
00:10:38,781 --> 00:10:42,530
When he used to imitate that guy used to
hold the pan and run for President Bob

176
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:45,850
Dole or the above though.
That's how I pictured Ted Turner.

177
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:51,230
Ted Turner talking a new talk show.
He's so fucking rich.

178
00:10:51,231 --> 00:10:54,590
He doesn't have any guests.
Um, all right. So anyways,

179
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,590
I go up to som slams,

180
00:10:56,591 --> 00:11:01,370
see school and the
weather's beautiful and um,

181
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:05,450
you know, I got some family and
friends up there. We fucking hang out.

182
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:09,550
What do we do? What did
we do Friday night? Oh,

183
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:13,370
went out to this unbelievable
Italian restaurant and uh,

184
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,780
I actually have been craving
a pork chop for a while,

185
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:23,070
for years. I actually am not gonna lie to
you. I got to, I got a great pork shop.

186
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:26,390
Why is that word sounds so annoying.
Pork Chop.

187
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:32,010
I'm at this restaurant out here in la
and it was so fucking unbelievably good.

188
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:36,230
All right,
so unbelievably fucking

189
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:43,880
that. I came back like 10 days later
going, I got to get this pork chop again.

190
00:11:43,881 --> 00:11:47,900
Pork chops and applesauce g that swell,
right Brady bunch,

191
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:52,220
Brady bunch reference there wold
champion Apple, Shush, shush match. Well,

192
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:57,900
um, and I fucking, I went back
and they had taken it off the menu

193
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:02,990
and idea or just something else since
sucked. In fact, everything's sucked.

194
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:08,960
The offense shocked. The defense sacked.
We sucked. Um, the whole fucking,

195
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:10,970
the whole meal stunk.

196
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:16,850
So I went years just thinking
about this fucking pork shop,

197
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:22,220
waiting for the right fucking restaurant
with the right level of quality of food

198
00:12:22,221 --> 00:12:24,650
that if it was on the God damn menu,
I was going to order it.

199
00:12:24,651 --> 00:12:25,484
There's not a lot of plate.

200
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,450
Not a lot of Nice restaurants
will serve via fucking pork chop.

201
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,890
You know, your choices
are usually, you know,

202
00:12:33,891 --> 00:12:38,180
stake some sort of chicken fish,

203
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,970
maybe lamp.
All right?

204
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,290
They might do a pull pork.
Uh,

205
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:50,070
they might do a piggy or fucking
sandwich, a brisket or whatever, but,

206
00:12:50,071 --> 00:12:53,990
but to try to get somebody to get dim,
to make a fucking pork chop,

207
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:59,520
all right. The way that your mom
never did. Cause who's kidding who,

208
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,170
whose kid? No moms do not
know how to cook pork chops.

209
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:08,880
All right? They just date
as my dad would say, Christ,

210
00:13:08,881 --> 00:13:12,590
you're cut the shit out of it.
Right?

211
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:17,820
They cook the shit out of it,
which is very easy to do with pork.

212
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:18,750
I don't know why,

213
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,740
but it's very easy for that thing to
taste like one of the fucking tiles that's

214
00:13:22,741 --> 00:13:26,940
on the floor. Your
kitchen. Um, so anyways,

215
00:13:26,941 --> 00:13:30,510
I went to this restaurant and this Italian
restaurant that had homemade fucking

216
00:13:30,511 --> 00:13:34,890
pasta, one of my favorites, and
I saw that pork chop and I said,

217
00:13:34,891 --> 00:13:39,390
fuck that pasta. All right there, Luigi,
you tell Clemenza and the kitchen.

218
00:13:39,391 --> 00:13:43,140
I don't need his fucking
pasta. All right, I want,

219
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:49,230
I want to fucking porkchop. Solera
this portrait. I got a side of pasta.

220
00:13:49,231 --> 00:13:52,320
The Pasta was fucking outstanding.
And I know like most times,

221
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:56,580
most shows like Anthony Bordain would
tell you what fucking restaurant he went

222
00:13:56,581 --> 00:13:59,040
to. I don't do that. You know why?

223
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:02,640
Because I want to be able to go back
there without standing in any sort of a

224
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:03,474
fucking line.

225
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,250
So why don't you go to San Francisco
and figure it out for yourself?

226
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,050
That would be my cooking show.
Do you like how arrogant I am?

227
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:16,770
Anthony Bordain has this huge fucking
millions and millions of fans watching his

228
00:14:16,771 --> 00:14:18,060
show. I just got, you know,

229
00:14:18,061 --> 00:14:21,420
I got a couple thousand fans listen to
this fucking thing and I want to make

230
00:14:21,421 --> 00:14:23,340
sure I cannot guys,

231
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:28,350
I can't say the names of
things on my podcast, the, the,

232
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:28,581
the,

233
00:14:28,581 --> 00:14:33,581
the crush of people that will be showing
up to get a fucking porch up at God

234
00:14:36,401 --> 00:14:40,570
damn.
Oh my God.

235
00:14:40,571 --> 00:14:43,660
Are you kidding me? Oh my
God. Are you kidding me?

236
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:51,010
Oh my God. All right. I thought the,

237
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,260
I just thought this whole
fucking thing just shut off.

238
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:00,010
When I set it back down,
I'm doing this right as I woke up.

239
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,280
Okay.

240
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,690
The law many times that's happened to me.

241
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,320
Like I go to restart it and then I fucking
riff for 20 minutes and I look in the

242
00:15:06,321 --> 00:15:10,840
fucking recorders off and I'm like, oh
my God. Just like I just said, oh my God,

243
00:15:10,841 --> 00:15:13,480
are you fucking Katie?
I got to do it all over again.

244
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:17,870
I had a really funny character from
Wyoming. I'll never be recreated.

245
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:22,310
Um, all right, good. I just fucking
panicked. And you know what,

246
00:15:22,311 --> 00:15:26,000
that brings me into a fucking unbelievable
story that I got to talk about later.

247
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:28,970
Let me finish with the pork chop,
then I'll do a little bit of advertising.

248
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,960
All right.
That's your second course.

249
00:15:30,961 --> 00:15:34,640
They're right in the dessert will be
my little fucking story about panicking

250
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:38,300
that will not be enjoyable and listened
to it. Absolutely terrified me. Alright,

251
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:43,070
so I ordered this fucking pork chop.
Absolutely delicious.

252
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:44,140
Yeah,

253
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:49,010
absolutely. Fucking
delicious. You know, and um,

254
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:51,770
I was I talking about it yet and I'm
not going to tell you where I got it.

255
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:55,930
Not only what, I never tell you if I know
I can't even remember the name of it.

256
00:15:56,110 --> 00:16:00,160
So now I'm fucked.
I don't know who gives a shit.

257
00:16:00,161 --> 00:16:02,880
You heard me trying to remember the
name of the fucking x men as a Goddamn

258
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:06,760
zillion dollar movie. I'm going to
remember the name of a restaurant.

259
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:11,080
The fuck was it called? It was
a number in it. I remember that.

260
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:12,580
Okay,

261
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,570
that Jesus Christ,

262
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:17,480
this is when the cops would just
put away their little fucking,

263
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:22,190
you know that little pad that they write
on their part. We have an iPad now.

264
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,760
Can you describe what he looked like?
I Dunno. Why don't you go, fuck.

265
00:16:25,761 --> 00:16:29,690
I look at the security footage.
We're in the middle of nowhere. Well,

266
00:16:29,691 --> 00:16:33,170
fucking call up the drone company.
I'm sure they were watching something.

267
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:36,890
Fucking nerd Weirdos jerking
off to the top of my head.

268
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,860
All right, let's go. Let's do a little
bit of advertising here for this week,

269
00:16:42,861 --> 00:16:44,270
everybody,
all right,

270
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,350
okay.

271
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:50,350
Oh No. What? What is going
on with this shit? Come on,

272
00:16:50,351 --> 00:16:55,060
Bill for Christ. Fucking sakes.
All right. I swear to God.

273
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:59,830
Me Undies, right? Me
undies. I swear to God.

274
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:02,680
This is the name of a
company. Me undies, everybody.

275
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:08,610
It's unbelievable how putting on a great
pair of underwear changes your entire

276
00:17:09,191 --> 00:17:12,490
outlook for the day.
That is not a joke.

277
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,050
You know that feeling of putting
on that ratty old saggy underwear.

278
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:20,770
I want you to know that feeling
of wearing great fitting,

279
00:17:20,771 --> 00:17:23,790
great looking underwear
that's cupping you bull.

280
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:27,400

most comfortable underwear
you have ever tried on.

282

They fit perfectly.

283
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:38,490
They don't ride up on you
and they literally pull
moisture away from your skin.

284
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:46,200
They pull moisture away from your skin
all day. So you're cool all day long.

285
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:51,230
But here's the thing, they also make
you look great. They give you a package,

286
00:17:51,231 --> 00:17:52,250
a nice profile.

287
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:56,630
Go to me undies.com and check out the
pics of all the different styles of

288

344
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:48,720
I've created an empire with
this show. Have I? I Dunno,
that's what the copy says,

345
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:53,400
but when it comes to handling business
calls, you're stuck with a challenge.

346
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:58,500
Either hire a full time receptionist
or handle all of your calls yourself,

347
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:03,000
it's a lose lose. Uh,
that's why I love he voice.

348
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,650
They will set your business up
with a toll free number or a local,

349
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:11,160
a local number, toll free
number, or a local number.

350
00:22:11,161 --> 00:22:14,490
That's what I was trying to say. Sorry
about that one. Customer's calls call.

351
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,080
They're greeted professionally by,

352
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:21,000
by a virtual receptionist that will
route your call to wherever you are.

353
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:24,060
That's,
there's even a dial by name directory.

354
00:22:24,061 --> 00:22:27,360
You're going to sound like a fortune
500 company, and more importantly,

355
00:22:27,361 --> 00:22:32,190
you'll never miss an important call again,
all for under 13 bucks a month. Okay,

you've got a giant company. I mean,

00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,191
Oh yeah.

371
00:23:19,191 --> 00:23:24,191
So I go up to San Fransisco and I
got this great pork chop and um,

372
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:26,140
okay.

373
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:31,140
Smoked a cigar at the top of one
of those God Damn Hills and uh,

374
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,520
called it a night.

375
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:35,270
Okay.

376
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:38,010
And Oh my God, I almost forgot
about the fucking steam room.

377
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:39,700
Okay.

378
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,380
I got to tell you about
the fucking steam room.

379
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:43,630
Okay.

380
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,260
I gotta make sure I remembered
to tell you that. All right,

381
00:23:45,261 --> 00:23:49,490
so let's just get to the show.
So I go over to a Davies Symphony Hall,

382
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:54,220
beautiful venue. Bunch of people
showed up. And uh, so before I,

383
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,940
I go out on stage or whatever, before
we starting to show Jason Law had goes,

384
00:23:58,941 --> 00:24:03,330
hey bill. He's like, what do
you want me to say about you?
And I was like, you know,

385
00:24:03,331 --> 00:24:07,370
I'm going to see them on
Netflix, Letterman. And he goes,

386
00:24:07,371 --> 00:24:09,350
you want me to hype the new
special? And I said, yeah,

387
00:24:09,351 --> 00:24:13,070
if you don't mind doing that. He said,
absolutely. When does it come out?

388
00:24:13,071 --> 00:24:14,150
What's it called?
They said,

389
00:24:14,151 --> 00:24:18,680
it comes out December 5th
on Netflix and it's called,

390
00:24:18,681 --> 00:24:22,910
I'm sorry you feel that way. And
he goes, okay, all right, cool.

391
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:25,460
And then five minutes later he goes,
Hey, what's your special called again?

392
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,830
I keep thinking, why do I do
this? What did I go? It's called,

393
00:24:27,831 --> 00:24:31,460
I'm sorry you feel this way.
He goes, okay, I got it. I
got it. And I looked at him,

394
00:24:31,461 --> 00:24:35,630
I go, Jay, he's like, what? I go, you're
going to fuck this up. And he goes, no,

395
00:24:35,631 --> 00:24:38,630
I'm not. I'm a professional.
And he laughs and he leaves.

396
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:43,280
So he goes out and he does his thing.
He gets to his clothes and bit,

397
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,500
it crushes right. And uh, and I'm like,

398
00:24:48,501 --> 00:24:51,650
okay, you know, I'm getting a bubble.
I'm getting ready to get brought out.

399
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:57,140
So I'm ready to get brought up and I'm
waiting for him know to do as little

400
00:24:57,141 --> 00:25:01,900
fighting out of the red corner. He stands
at five foot 10. He can't get a Tan.

401
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:06,140
He's got freckles on
his ass though. Rating.

402
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:09,350
Right. Um, but he doesn't do that.

403
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:12,350
He just starts talking.

404
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:17,450
He finished his fucking act like he
always does. He kills like he always does.

405
00:25:17,451 --> 00:25:21,140
And now we supposed to fucking bring
me up and instead of bringing me up,

406
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:24,470
he starts Yammer and all and on going,
you know,

407
00:25:24,471 --> 00:25:27,560
it's been great out here to
be here in San Francisco,

408
00:25:27,561 --> 00:25:30,230
a beautiful weather today.
You know,

409
00:25:30,231 --> 00:25:33,620
me and bill were out there a sampling,

410
00:25:33,621 --> 00:25:38,621
some of the local fare
Blahblahblahblahblah and he
just starts just not telling

411
00:25:39,351 --> 00:25:41,630
jokes,
not really telling a story.

412
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:46,670
Just sort of vaguely describing the day.
Yeah.

413
00:25:46,671 --> 00:25:50,750
It was about 82 degrees out there,
barometric pressure.

414
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,280
And I'm sitting there going,
what the fuck is this guy doing it?

415
00:25:54,281 --> 00:25:57,830
And then he just goes, all right, you
guys ready for the man? He came to see,

416
00:25:57,831 --> 00:25:59,980
you know, you know, he is, uh,

417
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,670
he's got a special coming out on Netflix
and then he just looks over at me and

418
00:26:04,671 --> 00:26:08,600
he goes and he's like,
I can't remember what it's called.

419
00:26:08,601 --> 00:26:12,410
And then I fuckin died laughing,
died laughing.

420
00:26:12,411 --> 00:26:15,950
Cause then I realized what he was doing,
he wasn't even talking to the crowd,

421
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:20,450
he was just saying English words that
they'd understand is in his brain.

422
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,520
He was going,
what the fuck is it called?

423
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,620
So I went out there and for
five minutes just trashed him

424
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,450
for saying sampling some of the local fair

425
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:35,300
and looking back,

426
00:26:35,301 --> 00:26:39,080
I should have trashed the crowd for
not immediately heckling him for saying

427
00:26:39,081 --> 00:26:44,020
fucking sampling some of the local fare.
What the fuck does that mean? Do you

428
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:47,830
realize what a creepy,
creepy fucking expression that is?

429
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,810
Sampling the local fare.

430
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:55,140
Anybody who just blew into town could
be talking about anything from getting

431
00:26:55,141 --> 00:26:58,260
something to eat,
to being a fucking serial rapist.

432
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,290
And that was sampling some
of the local fare. You know,

433
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:04,590
something like Hannibal Lecter would say
50 fucking took a bite out of your neck.

434
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,890
Um,
so anyways,

435
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:13,530
so I went out there and I tried a bunch
of new shit and it seemed to work and

436
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:14,670
then we did a

437
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:15,970
okay.

438
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:19,150
It was just, it was just a perfect show,
man. That first show was just awesome,

439
00:27:19,151 --> 00:27:22,870
right? Not saying the second one wasn't,
but I had such a funny moment, uh,

440
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:28,060
during the show where I'm in the
middle of my act and the giants.

441
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:29,550
Okay.

442
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:33,810
You know, they were in the
playoffs, playoffs. And um,

443
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:39,290
I'm in the middle of one of my jokes and
I have no idea what's going on in the

444
00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:40,124
game.

445
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,470
And all of a sudden this guy just yells
out in the upper deck. He just goes,

446
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:50,750
and the crowd just fucking
erupts into chairs.

447
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:56,110
So I immediately do the math. I might, San
Francisco giants. It's fucking October.

448
00:27:56,111 --> 00:27:59,110
That's right. I've been watching some of
the minutes to playoffs and I was like,

449
00:27:59,111 --> 00:28:02,560
all right. Yeah. I can't get mad at that.
I can't get mad at that. Your giants fans,

450
00:28:02,561 --> 00:28:03,730
you want to be watching the games,

451
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:07,990
but you fucking bought tickets to my
show so you know you're going to do a

452
00:28:07,991 --> 00:28:12,070
little multitask in there. So I said, all
right, two to one and I was like, what?

453
00:28:12,071 --> 00:28:15,820
Editing is it?
And the crowd starts yelling,

454
00:28:15,821 --> 00:28:18,610
you know when a bunch of people are
yelling and you standing up on stage,

455
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:19,271
it bounced.

456
00:28:19,271 --> 00:28:23,590
The sound bounces off the wall behind
you and it can be very hard to understand

457
00:28:23,591 --> 00:28:27,560
what people are saying. So I
was like, what? Anything is
it? And they're like, Yay.

458
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:32,910
I'm like, why? Why don't you
know, Yay Jay. And then I go,

459
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:36,730
I go, I can't hear you.
There you go. Hey Jay.

460
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:38,490
Okay.

461
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:43,440
Oh gone. 88 80 come on. What? What?

462
00:28:43,441 --> 00:28:45,120
And just fucking hold up your fingers.

463
00:28:45,121 --> 00:28:47,910
And they kept yelling out and it sounded
like they was saying eight. I go,

464
00:28:47,911 --> 00:28:52,190
you know what? It sounds like
you're saying 18 what inning?

465
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:55,630
Just one person.
One person was holding up seven fingers.

466
00:28:55,631 --> 00:28:59,410
So I was like the seventh and
they were like, hey, chain.

467
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:02,340
I sorta kept sounding
like I kept the goal.

468
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:06,040
He keeps sounding like you're
saying the 18th a minute,

469
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,680
90 excruciating seconds to this.

470
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,100
Yeah,

471
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:13,100
until I find out they
were actually saying 18.

472
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:15,290
It was the fucking eighth inning.

473
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,250
Okay.

474
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:22,250
The national score to run in like the
third fucking inning to go up one to

475
00:29:22,291 --> 00:29:23,124
nothing.

476
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,390
Okay.

477
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:29,390
And then the giants scored one in the
top of the ninth to tie it up or the

478
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:32,520
bottom of the night. Oh No. Top of the
night. That's right. It was in Washington.

479
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:33,960
Yeah.

480
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:38,960
To tie it at one to one and then they
didn't score again until the fucking top

481
00:29:39,871 --> 00:29:42,530
of the 18th and neither did the nationals.

482
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:46,220
The nationals went 15 fucking
innings without scoring a run.

483
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,350
The giants played a whole nother
baseball game before they scored another

484
00:29:51,351 --> 00:29:56,230
fucking run. And uh, unfucking believable.

485
00:29:56,231 --> 00:29:59,980
And you know what? It's odd enough
that happened in the middle of July.

486
00:29:59,981 --> 00:30:03,490
You'd want to kill yourself, but if it
happens in October, it's unbelievable.

487
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:07,640
You know, for as much shit as
people give me as a hockey fan.

488
00:30:07,641 --> 00:30:11,390
Why do you watch the regular season?
It doesn't even count.

489
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,630
Everybody makes it, but like four
fucking teams. It's like, yeah,

490
00:30:14,631 --> 00:30:19,160
but there's exciting games.
They're allowed to fight. Okay.

491
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:21,530
There's great things that can happen.
You know,

492
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:25,750
baseball on the other fucking hand
other than the beginning in April where

493
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,720
you're excited because it's a new season.
Other than that, I mean it's just,

494
00:30:29,721 --> 00:30:33,080
it's fucking brutal
until you get to October.

495
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:36,920
And I would put baseball
playoffs right up playoffs.

496
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:41,470
I put it up there with any other
fucking playoffs. Um, I actually,

497
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:46,550
I love October baseball. Um, it's,
this is the best time of fucking year.

498
00:30:46,551 --> 00:30:50,990
October a playoff baseball,
national football league.

499
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:53,810
The national football league has been
going on long enough where he's starting

500
00:30:53,811 --> 00:30:55,670
to know who's going to be
competitive and who isn't.

501
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:59,150
And then hockey's coming up and
then right after that basketball,

502
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,070
it's unfucking believable.
Unbelievable. My life is perfect.

503
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:10,310
Um,
and I actually watched that first.

504
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:15,980
Um, cod knows Dodgers game.
I didn't see game too.

505
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,380
I watched game one and I was,

506
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:24,100
I am 100% convinced that
Donnie baseball is cursed.

507
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:30,470
I mean, they had their race. What's
the guy? Kershaw, I don't even know.

508
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:32,780
I don't even watch baseball. I have
no fucking idea. And all I do is I,

509
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:36,740
I just keep hearing about this guy that
he's basically having like a seasoned

510
00:31:36,741 --> 00:31:40,820
better than Pedro Martinez in like 1999.
I'm like,

511
00:31:40,821 --> 00:31:43,610
I gotta Watch this guy. And, uh,

512
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:48,740
I start watching the game and I
know the Dodgers have this debt.

513
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:52,250
Unbelievable, right fielder. He's
like fucking Willie Mays on steroids.

514
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:56,420
Not Literally steroids, but you know,
people are just bigger now. And uh,

515
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,410
so he gets drilled in the fucking arm
when he's up there and I guess the

516
00:32:00,411 --> 00:32:02,390
cardinals were doing that shit last year.

517
00:32:02,391 --> 00:32:05,060
So all of a sudden the next guy
that comes up there, first base,

518
00:32:05,061 --> 00:32:09,350
when he was like my height, he gets in
the face of fucking some guy named Benji.

519
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:13,130
I don't know anybody's name anymore. They
start fucking screaming at each other.

520
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:17,810
And uh, I was, I was totally
hooked. I was into it.

521
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,870
The fucking Dodgers were up six to two

522
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:26,400
going into the seventh or eighth
fucking ending. All right.

523
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:30,510
I think Clayton Kershaw is the name of
the pitcher. I have no fucking idea.

524
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:33,390
But now they all have beards
and all that crazy shit.

525
00:32:33,391 --> 00:32:36,420
They all stole it from the Red Sox who
stole it from the homeless guys, right?

526
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:40,680
And uh, you know, they've
got their fucking ace

527
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:46,760
guys got no, was it six to one or
62? It's got a full run fucking lead.

528
00:32:46,761 --> 00:32:48,020
The get Goddamn game is over.

529
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:53,360
All of a sudden he loads up the
basis is a single six to three.

530
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:57,410
There's another single six to four Donny
baseball comes walking out like, dude,

531
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,950
what the fuck are you doing in the
little bearded wonder goes, hey,

532
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:03,050
I may not be able to grow a man's beard,

533
00:33:03,051 --> 00:33:06,380
but I know how to get out of
this fucking Annie. All right.

534
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:08,900
I'm only at a hundred pitches.
I won the Cy Young Award.

535
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:11,510
I won every fucking award you
can win as a goddamn picture.

536
00:33:11,511 --> 00:33:14,000
I've got this Donnie and Donnie
baseball makes the right choice.

537
00:33:14,001 --> 00:33:18,920
That's a fucking locally. This is the
move to make. We've got to win game one.

538
00:33:18,921 --> 00:33:23,600
We got to do it on your arm,
right? Fucking comes up.

539
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,700
This other fucking dude who owns them.

540
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:29,540
This is the worst fucking sports coverage
ever. I don't know anybody's name.

541
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:33,140
He fucking,
it's a a God damn

542
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:39,550
double. That just clears
the basis. Three run score,

543
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:45,480
six to five, six to six.
Now it's six to seven.

544
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:48,750
They're down by a fucking run
and they've got a man on second.

545
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:50,700
Now Donnie baseball comes up,

546
00:33:50,701 --> 00:33:55,260
poses fucking kid brings in this
fucking pull Luca, he comes in,

547
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,480
serves up a fucking meatball,

548
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:05,570
right? That's gotta be the
Saint Louis fucking announcer.

549
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:10,610
They score two more runs.
It is now nine to six.

550
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:14,760
They started the inning,
six to two,

551
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:20,010
up for fucking runs with the greatest
picture of the last 15 fucking years.

552
00:34:20,011 --> 00:34:24,600
By the end of the inning, they are down
by three runs. How does that happen?

553
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,870
You know how bad I'm rooting
for the Dodgers to win.

554
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:33,990
There's so many teams that I love this
year. Kansas City, you got to love that.

555
00:34:33,991 --> 00:34:37,230
They're back in at the Baltimore Orioles.
You gotta love that. They're back in it.

556
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:43,240
You know, don Mattingly, you got
to want that guy to win a fucking,

557
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:47,360
uh, you know, when a ring and then he
got the giants. I mean, I, you know,

558
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:50,290
they've just one, two, I mean,
I like seeing a fucking dynasty,

559
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:54,570
whatever the fuck they would
be called. It's great, right?

560
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,560
A lot of fucking teams to root
for. And then they'd sit, nick, uh,

561
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,210
suggested that maybe the cardinals is
steel and signs from second base and that

562
00:35:03,211 --> 00:35:08,100
they have a reputation for doing that.
And once I found out that's not illegal,

563
00:35:08,101 --> 00:35:11,220
it's like a fucking love these guys.
And even if it was illegal,

564
00:35:11,221 --> 00:35:14,130
that's the kind of cheating that
you got to respect. You know,

565
00:35:14,131 --> 00:35:17,640
if you can look over at your fucking
neighbors paper and they're smarter than

566
00:35:17,641 --> 00:35:21,430
you are, you know, are
you're really cheating. Oh,

567
00:35:21,431 --> 00:35:26,310
you just delegating
power. Um, anyways. Oh,

568
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,480
what the fuck I'm talking about?

569
00:35:27,481 --> 00:35:31,770
So I watched that whole
game beside myself.

570
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:34,400
I just can't fucking believe it.

571
00:35:34,401 --> 00:35:39,401
And the thing about don Mattingly's
such a class act and he just sits there

572
00:35:40,381 --> 00:35:43,170
expressionless and you know,
it's just ripping his fucking hard out.

573
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,840
I want to see that guy get a ring.
So God damn bad if he doesn't,

574
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:48,720
I would love to see either
the royals or the Orioles.

575
00:35:48,721 --> 00:35:50,910
Because when I first started
watching playoff baseball,

576
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:55,020
it was always the royals would always
win the west and they could not get past

577
00:35:55,021 --> 00:35:59,720
the Yankees. Um, and then there was a,

578
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:04,310
when do they all they find got by him in
1980 and then lost to the Phillies with

579
00:36:04,311 --> 00:36:09,311
Pete rose at first base dribbling the
ball up to the picture on the fucking

580
00:36:09,411 --> 00:36:14,000
astro turf. And um, and the Orioles,

581
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:19,790
I, I have to see, I saw them when it in
83 and a, the first world series, well,

582
00:36:19,791 --> 00:36:23,520
the Third World series that I watched,
1979, the orals versus the pirate.

583
00:36:23,521 --> 00:36:26,120
So I was hoping the pirates are going
to win that one game playoff and maybe I

584
00:36:26,121 --> 00:36:30,630
could have a rematch in 1979 and nine
different, they'd bring back. We Ah,

585
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:36,380
Woo Hoo. Who? Um, sorry. Um, anyways,

586
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,593
uh,

587
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:43,700
so I watch that shit so that I'm
rooting for a Donny baseball. So anyway,

588
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:47,690
so I'm watching that shit. Then I go
on and I go do my show, smoke a cigar.

589
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:50,000
And one of the greatest things
you can do after you smoke cigars,

590
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:53,690
besides take a fucking shower and
gargle with mouthwash for an hour,

591
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:56,540
you still gonna wake up with that
taste in the back of your throat.

592
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:01,090
So if you have access to a steam shower,
you go down and you'd take a state,

593
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:05,630
you take a steam and you're fucking
sweat out all the impurities and um,

594
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:07,300
okay.

595
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,220
And then you get, yeah,
you, you're good to go.

596
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:11,350
You go out and you're fucking
jump in a cold shower.

597
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:15,430
A lot of people don't know how to
take a fucking steam. You know,

598
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:19,120
they fucking go into this steam sweat,
they're fucking nuts off.

599
00:37:19,121 --> 00:37:22,570
And then they walk out and they stand
there. Oh God, it's hot as shit.

600
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:27,550
And they just stand there and then they
fucking go back in and then they come

601
00:37:27,551 --> 00:37:28,710
back out and then they go,

602
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,870
I got one more session and mean
they fucking go back in again.

603
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:35,680
Morons fucking morons.
All right,

604
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:38,980
this is how you take a steam. You just
stay in there for like 10 minutes.

605
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,740
That's all you need.
And as you're in there for 10 minutes,

606
00:37:41,741 --> 00:37:45,850
be wiping the fucking sweat off of you.
Your body is,

607
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:50,350
is when he made you sweat. It's releasing
toxins. Your skin is like a sponge.

608
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:54,340
If you let it sit there on you,
okay,

609
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,040
you're gonna fucking reabsorb some of it.

610
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:02,560
As you're sitting there in the fucking
steam shower, these fucking guys do that.

611
00:38:02,561 --> 00:38:07,240
Then you supposed to walk out of the
steam shower and immediately walk in and

612
00:38:07,241 --> 00:38:09,640
take an ice cold shower immediately.

613
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:14,620
So your poor state closed and your wash
off as much of the fucking toxins that

614
00:38:14,621 --> 00:38:18,970
you sweat it out as possible and you
will feel like a fucking million bucks.

615
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:21,900
All right? And all you need
to do is just be in the water,

616
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:26,290
the ice cold water for like, you
know, whatever. Five, six seconds,

617
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:27,490
okay,

618
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:31,220
oh long it takes you to fucking hoes off
your body and then he could turn it on

619
00:38:31,221 --> 00:38:33,970
to an acceptable temperature
and then you're good to go.

620
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:35,660
And you always wear flops,

621
00:38:35,661 --> 00:38:38,930
so you don't get fucking plantars warts
or athlete's foot or any other fucking

622
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:43,700
awful bacteria. That's, that's, it's
in the God damn thing there. Right.

623
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:49,070
So, um, anyways, the fucking, uh,

624
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,340
how's it going to say? So we
fucking go there and there's, I,

625
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:58,400
I walk in one with law head and I walk
in to see if there's anybody in the steam

626
00:38:58,401 --> 00:39:03,380
shower and I walk and there's the, uh,
the sauna, which is just the dry heat.

627
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:08,590
And I look in there and there was this
Asian dude completely fucking naked.

628
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:10,773
Yeah.

629
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:14,310
Okay. He had the decency to put his
arm in front of his junk as I walk by,

630
00:39:14,311 --> 00:39:18,380
kind of like Burt Reynolds when he
did the fucking, uh, the playgirl,

631
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:23,920
whatever the, the playgirls center
fold or whatever the fuck he did. Um,

632
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:30,610
I'm like, Oh God, a naked Asian and
Asian. We've got an Asian in their law it,

633
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:31,770
and he's like,

634
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:36,770
and then he's sitting there butt ass naked
on the fucking seat that someone else

635
00:39:36,991 --> 00:39:37,890
has to sit on.

636
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:39,670
Okay.

637
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:40,790
Fucking unbelievable.

638
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:45,310
So meanwhile I had,
you know,

639
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:49,160
because I was walking in and make
sure that the steam was on. Uh,

640
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:52,070
so then we fucking come walking back in.

641
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:56,690
And as we walked back in the, the
naked Asian, the nation there is,

642
00:39:57,050 --> 00:39:58,550
he had gone into the shower,

643
00:39:58,551 --> 00:40:03,230
he knew to take the cold shower and he
just comes walking out completely fucking

644
00:40:03,231 --> 00:40:08,120
naked. All right, so I'm laughing.
There's always the fucking naked guy.

645
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:11,140
All right. So then I, uh,

646
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:17,120
I opened the sauna and in, no, no, no,
no, no. If I fucked up as, as we go,

647
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:19,100
that's right. Then we went
back to the lockers. We change.

648
00:40:19,101 --> 00:40:21,710
Now we're walking back in and we'll laugh.
And about the naked Asian dude.

649
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:26,060
And right as we go to turn the
fucking corner to go into the sauna,

650
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:31,120
like the fucking Truman show for people
walk in front of us and go right into

651
00:40:31,251 --> 00:40:33,260
the sauna and there's this little fuck,
I mean,

652
00:40:33,261 --> 00:40:36,950
the steam room is this little ass fucking
steam room and they all fucking go in

653
00:40:36,951 --> 00:40:39,690
there and I'm thinking, Oh man, maybe
it's, maybe there'll be enough room.

654
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:41,960
And I opened the door and then
I'll just fucking sit in there.

655
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,240
It's just a nice guy, a
packed house, whatever.

656
00:40:44,241 --> 00:40:46,130
These guys will just being
in here for 10 minutes.

657
00:40:46,131 --> 00:40:49,310
So me and law had go back and we'd just
sitting there and we're laughing about

658
00:40:49,311 --> 00:40:53,810
the naked Asian dude,
right? Um, long story short,

659
00:40:53,811 --> 00:40:58,811
these fucking jerk offs
are in this Goddamn a steam
room and they're doing that

660
00:40:58,851 --> 00:41:02,540
shit with a commonality.
So fucking hot and then drinking water,

661
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:07,810
letting it all reabsorb and they just
go on back in there in there for like a

662
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:12,840
fucking half hour. So finally me lie, how
to like, fuck, we got to go with like,

663
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,730
you know, we want to go watch the
football. What the fuck are we gonna do?

664
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:18,360
Okay?

665
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,680
You know what our options,

666
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:25,160
you got all fucking 20 sweaty ball guys
in there or we go in with the nation and

667
00:41:26,571 --> 00:41:30,900
in, in the sauna. So we say, well,
the naked agent guy had left.

668
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,400
At least we thought he did.

669
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:37,760
So we go into the sauna and who comes
fucking walking back the naked Asian.

670
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:41,210
But now he's got a fucking towel
on. Now he sits down, me and Jay,

671
00:41:41,211 --> 00:41:44,930
a fucking wearing towels.
Thank God. Generally speaking,

672
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,230
they come from a polite culture, so he
leaves his towel on. So I'm thinking,

673
00:41:48,231 --> 00:41:50,660
all right, we're good here.
We're fucking good here.

674
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:52,910
And I'm sitting there and the sauna,

675
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:57,560
the sauna isn't hot enough so
the door hasn't clouded up.

676
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,660
So we're just sitting there,

677
00:41:59,661 --> 00:42:03,770
we can see right out the door and
all of a sudden this other naked guy

678
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,480
completely fucking naked,

679
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:09,110
comes walking out of the
fucking is steam thing,

680
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:14,570
just butt ass naked and is standing
there like fucking will Ferrell and old

681
00:42:14,571 --> 00:42:19,310
school at the water fountain, Bending
over, getting a goddamn drink.

682
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:21,920
And me and Jay are just
laughing our asses off,

683
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:25,220
staring down into the floor going,
what the fuck is going on?

684
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:30,730
And then the naked Asian guy crosses
his fucking legs and starts cracking his

685
00:42:31,041 --> 00:42:33,710
toes in the ungodly.

686
00:42:33,711 --> 00:42:38,711
Sa Silence in this fucking sauna is this
fucking will Pharrel asses in front of

687
00:42:38,991 --> 00:42:42,350
us. We're just like, I can't
fucking believe it, right?

688
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:45,920
So then we're sitting there and
we got this deal. Like I said,

689
00:42:45,921 --> 00:42:47,180
the window is in fogged up.

690
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:52,450
Then this fucking World War Two vet comes
walking by completely fucking naked.

691
00:42:52,971 --> 00:42:55,610
You know the greatest generation,
they never put a towel on.

692
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:59,930
He comes fucking walking by all
man balls and Dick and everything.

693
00:42:59,931 --> 00:43:03,980
And at this point, which is fucking
does not to duty, just start laughing.

694
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:06,920
And another guy comes walking in,

695
00:43:06,921 --> 00:43:10,310
he has a robe on another tub of
shit and he goes into the song,

696
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:12,620
he goes into the steam. And
finally we were like, look,

697
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:14,280
if we just don't fucking walk in there,

698
00:43:14,281 --> 00:43:16,730
whenever going to be able to take a steam.
And I fucking hate us on.

699
00:43:16,731 --> 00:43:18,380
I don't like the dry heat.
I like the other thing.

700
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:22,910
So we finally come walking in
there. All right. And as I walk in,

701
00:43:22,911 --> 00:43:24,440
I see a place where I can sit down.

702
00:43:24,441 --> 00:43:27,110
This is all fogged up and I
see how the corner of my eye,

703
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:31,460
there's someone else sitting there,
no towel on Dick and balls hanging out.

704
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:37,040
So I go to shoot the guy at dirty look
and who is it? It's the naked Asian.

705
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,300
I thought he left. He did. And he left,

706
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:44,100
got in the shower and then fucking
went back in there. Fucking nightmare.

707
00:43:44,101 --> 00:43:46,430
So then we're sitting in there,
all right,

708
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:50,780
the will feral naked dude too.
Fat fucks in the naked agent.

709
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:52,880
And then me and Jay law had

710
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:58,630
And the football guys now they're running
their yaps totally killing any sorta

711
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:02,960

chilling out. Anyways, royal
axes you can be with fucking,

712
00:44:02,961 --> 00:44:07,010
you know, naked guys all around you.
And this sitting in the, you know,

713
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:11,750

some sort of benefit that they would do

714
00:44:11,751 --> 00:44:16,250
it. Aw Man. Arizona was unbelievable.
Is just hookers everywhere. People,

715
00:44:16,251 --> 00:44:19,490
Drake and blah blah blah blah, blah.
The kids guys telling this story.

716
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,400
It was some sort of benefit for kids
and in the end he goes, you know,

717
00:44:22,401 --> 00:44:24,320
but it's all about the kids.
It's all about the kids.

718
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:29,030
Fucking jerk off starts the
story talking about hookers. Um,

719
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:31,570
anyways,
long short,

720
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:35,530
it finally ends up just being the two of
us in there and we're just laughing our

721
00:44:35,531 --> 00:44:36,820
covered balls off.

722
00:44:37,730 --> 00:44:38,070
Okay.

723
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:41,760
I, I've never seen, I've
never seen it like that ever.

724
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:47,160
Look like if you go to any sort of
fucking gym, any sort of locker room,

725
00:44:47,161 --> 00:44:51,270
this going to be the naked guy,
the guy just standing there. Right.

726
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:53,550
And for you ladies out there,
you'd probably think that, well,

727
00:44:53,551 --> 00:44:58,230
it's gotta be the well endowed guy
showing off his fucking God damn mule,

728
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:03,240
right. It, it, it usually isn't. It's
usually just fucking some average guy,

729
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:07,740
regular old fucking user-friendly
Dick just standing there.

730
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,233
You know,

731
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:13,740
like the kind of package that they always
make when they're like sculptors make,

732
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:18,690
you know, they never make like
a fucking huge Dick Statue.

733
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:23,010
They don't, they just draw a regular
old Dick. That's what it usually is.

734
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:27,160
And there's usually one of them and he'd
just sit there. Got Out is always why?

735
00:45:27,161 --> 00:45:29,160
Why the fuck does he fucking not notice?

736
00:45:29,161 --> 00:45:34,161
He's the only fucking naked
dude in here of yourself.

737
00:45:34,561 --> 00:45:36,240
Right.
But there's always that one guy,

738
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:39,540
unless you go to the YMC a then there's
usually about three because there's

739
00:45:39,541 --> 00:45:40,380
older people there.

740
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:46,190
I never seen a fucking Dick and
ball display like this in my life.

741
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:52,390
Unfucking believable. We would joke and
we were waiting for what's his face,

742
00:45:52,391 --> 00:45:54,000
uncle melty to come walk in.

743
00:45:57,070 --> 00:46:00,730
Um, anyways, so that's
the Dick and balls story.

744
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:04,300
So plowing ahead here.
Oh, I actually said that.

745
00:46:04,301 --> 00:46:08,590
I was going to tell you a fucking
goddamn creepy story here.

746
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,940
Um, and I gotta wrap this
podcast up because a, I get,

747

a day job now. Tell you what,

748
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:20,120
I'll read the rest of the
advertising and then I'll, uh,

749
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:24,170
I'll tell you this fucking terrifying
story that I read while on a plane.

750
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:25,100

All right,

795
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:54,710
so the terrifying story
than I have been teasing,

796
00:48:55,730 --> 00:49:00,560
teasing you guys about over the
last couple of, uh, I don't know,

797
00:49:00,561 --> 00:49:03,860
minutes here. Um, so anyways,

798
00:49:03,861 --> 00:49:08,610
the shows went great in San
Francisco and San Francisco and um,

799
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:13,910
we're flying back and my wife bought, um,

800
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:15,980
vanity fair I think.

801
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:17,240
Okay.

802
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:18,073
I Dunno,

803
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:22,700
it's the magazine where Robert Downey Jr
is on the cover and he looks like he's

804
00:49:22,701 --> 00:49:27,290
leaning out of the port hole of a ship
dressed in a Tuxedo. It makes you think,

805
00:49:27,291 --> 00:49:30,770
are they, are they remaking the
titanic? It's one of those photos.

806
00:49:30,771 --> 00:49:35,240
So she says, Hey, you are a,
you know, she knows I'm a fan,

807
00:49:35,241 --> 00:49:39,050
obviously guys, unbelievable
fucking actor. And she goes, hey,

808
00:49:39,051 --> 00:49:40,520
this is a great article.
You ought to read it.

809
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:44,060
So I'm looking in the table of contents.
You know, it's one of those magazines.

810
00:49:44,061 --> 00:49:48,440
You've got to go buy 50 pages of
advertiser advertisements before.

811
00:49:48,470 --> 00:49:49,303
Um,

812
00:49:50,090 --> 00:49:50,640
okay.

813
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:54,000
You know, you get to the actual
story. And the table of contents.

814
00:49:54,001 --> 00:49:59,001
So I found the table of contents and
there was a story about this flight.

815
00:50:00,090 --> 00:50:00,610
Okay.

816
00:50:00,610 --> 00:50:04,510
Um, that was flying from
Brazil to Paris, France.

817
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:06,700
Um,

818
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:11,230
and it was talking about technology and
how this thing just basically fell out

819
00:50:11,231 --> 00:50:16,231
of the fucking sky because the
pilots was the perfect storm of not

820
00:50:16,661 --> 00:50:20,770
communicating, getting
confused, a malfunction in the,

821
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:25,640
the, the, the system and um,

822
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:28,310
these guys being able to recover.

823
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:29,840
Yeah,

824
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:30,510
it was uneasy.

825
00:50:30,510 --> 00:50:35,510
You know what the malfunction was
basically they were flying out and the,

826
00:50:37,221 --> 00:50:41,090
uh, the captain, you'd only got an hour
of sleep and he wanted to go take a nap.

827
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:44,090
They had some thunder storms or whatever,

828
00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:49,940
a line of storm clouds coming up there
flying at 36,000 feet and this guy wanted

829
00:50:49,941 --> 00:50:54,941
to climb up to 38 which is basically
the ceiling that that plane could fly at

830
00:50:55,281 --> 00:50:57,490
safely. Cause at that point the
air is going to be too thin.

831
00:50:57,491 --> 00:51:02,030
I and I would assume that the engine
has to work too hard to suck in the air,

832
00:51:02,031 --> 00:51:06,710
suck, squeeze, Bang, blow, whatever the
fuck they say. How a jet engine works. Um,

833
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:09,920
and they said that the guy sounded nervous
and it was this weird thing where the

834
00:51:09,921 --> 00:51:13,290
guy had like
the,

835
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:16,250
the copilot had like over 2,500 hours,

836
00:51:16,251 --> 00:51:20,870
which is a significant amount of time
flying a fucking this type of an airplane.

837
00:51:20,871 --> 00:51:24,680
But most of it was just sitting
there while it was on autopilot.

838
00:51:25,610 --> 00:51:27,900
And this was kind of the point of,
of the um,

839
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:29,400
okay.

840
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:32,510
The article where,
how just through the,

841
00:51:32,511 --> 00:51:37,511
the whole timeline of aviation back in
the day you just had stick and rudder

842
00:51:37,871 --> 00:51:41,220
guys and they just flew the fucking thing.
MMM.

843
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:46,070
And then gradually they worked on these
automated systems and the pilots were

844
00:51:46,071 --> 00:51:50,510
arguing against them saying
there's nothing better than
a thinking human being.

845
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:54,350
And then these automated
systems got so good that the um,

846
00:51:55,130 --> 00:51:55,590
yeah,

847
00:51:55,590 --> 00:52:00,590
basically accidents and everything went
through the floor and it became way

848
00:52:00,781 --> 00:52:04,530
safer to fly and the
automated systems took over.

849
00:52:04,531 --> 00:52:06,960
But now they've gotten to the point where,

850
00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:09,720
I don't know if they're saying that
they can actually be dangerous. So

851
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:15,600
basically what happened was
that the captain went to
go take a nap and then this

852
00:52:15,601 --> 00:52:20,370
other guy goes and he sits down and there
was a miscommunication as to who the

853
00:52:20,371 --> 00:52:24,000
pilot in command was or who
was in command or whatever.

854
00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:27,090
And they don't even have
sticks anymore up there.

855
00:52:27,091 --> 00:52:32,091
They have like a joystick that you
move and then the system interprets the

856
00:52:32,851 --> 00:52:33,684
movement.

857
00:52:34,570 --> 00:52:35,190
Yeah.

858
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:36,390
Like not instantly.

859
00:52:36,391 --> 00:52:40,170
It has to have that split second where
it interprets it and then it, it,

860
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:44,370
it acts on whatever
movement you did and um,

861
00:52:45,810 --> 00:52:48,900
the sticks camp,
the joysticks can't move at the same time.

862
00:52:48,901 --> 00:52:51,980
Like say if both people in both,
mmm.

863
00:52:53,430 --> 00:52:54,510
Both seats up there.

864
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:58,770
If one was to move the joystick to the
right and the other was to move it all

865
00:52:58,771 --> 00:52:59,640
the way to the left,

866
00:52:59,641 --> 00:53:02,610
what the computer would do would
split the difference on the movement.

867
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:06,710
And I dunno,
it just,

868
00:53:07,930 --> 00:53:10,840
basically all that happened
was they went into this storm

869
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:16,650
and the air was cold enough with a water
droplet said formed into ice crystals

870
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:21,450
and it blocked there. Pito Tube. The Pito
Tube is, you know, is on all aircraft.

871
00:53:21,451 --> 00:53:26,150
It's just a tube that points towards the
front of the aircraft. And as you fly, as

872
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:29,510
the air is coming in it,
that's how you figure out your airspeed.

873
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:34,400
So what happened was they flew through
this ice, ice went into the Pito Tube,

874
00:53:34,430 --> 00:53:37,220
it froze it up so the air
couldn't go in anymore.

875
00:53:37,850 --> 00:53:42,140
So they no longer could,
they lost their,

876
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:44,930
uh,
their air speed indicator.

877
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:49,320
So they immediately lost that.
All right.

878
00:53:49,321 --> 00:53:52,530
And they had the lights on in the
cabinet there out over the ocean.

879
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:57,130
They must've been
then,

880
00:53:57,131 --> 00:53:59,260
it must have not been any
moonlight or anything.

881
00:53:59,710 --> 00:54:03,750
So basically they couldn't see a horizon.

882
00:54:05,290 --> 00:54:05,621
All right.

883
00:54:05,621 --> 00:54:10,621
But all they had to do was just look at
that little plane thing that just let

884
00:54:10,931 --> 00:54:14,350
you know if your level and not,
and for some reason,

885
00:54:14,351 --> 00:54:18,040
when they lost their airspeed indicator,

886
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:21,970
they then lost all faith in
the entire fucking system.

887
00:54:22,570 --> 00:54:25,600
And the nervous Nelly
Guy who wanted to climb,

888
00:54:27,010 --> 00:54:31,480
you know, above the storm play, he
wanted to fly at the absolute height.

889
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:35,880
He's immediate instinct
was he started pulling the,

890
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:37,930
or moving the joystick back.

891
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:44,050
And if you lose all faith
in your instruments and you,

892
00:54:44,110 --> 00:54:46,510
and you don't have any horizon to look at,

893
00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:48,850
you don't know where the fuck you're at.

894
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:53,910
And this dude was panicking so he pulled
the stick back too far and it got to

895
00:54:53,911 --> 00:54:56,550
the point where they were going to stall.

896
00:54:57,670 --> 00:54:58,110
Okay.

897
00:54:58,110 --> 00:55:02,160
And I forget, it's such a long fucking
article and it's really involved. So he,

898
00:55:02,161 --> 00:55:06,090
they start, the other guy
starts going, no, what are
you doing? What are you doing?

899
00:55:06,210 --> 00:55:07,050
Do this,
do this.

900
00:55:07,051 --> 00:55:12,051
And he starts moving his thing and then
that the computer is going dual input,

901
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:14,070
meaning that they're both
moving the fucking thing.

902
00:55:14,071 --> 00:55:18,750
So they start going up and
down and they basically,

903
00:55:18,751 --> 00:55:19,830
the fucking nervous Nelly,

904
00:55:19,831 --> 00:55:23,400
he pulls it all the way back
and they start feeling the,

905
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:27,480
the airplane starts rocking and that's
that point where you're going to stall.

906
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:28,980
Okay.

907
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:33,630
Because at that point,
the air foil is so far back,

908
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:37,810
you're going to lose lift and it's,
the air is just tumbling over the tea.

909
00:55:37,811 --> 00:55:40,290
It's like all of a sudden now you might
as well have a fucking two pieces of

910
00:55:40,291 --> 00:55:44,130
plywood,
like flying into the fucking wind.

911
00:55:44,670 --> 00:55:49,590
So they start losing altitude.
So they see that they're losing altitude,

912
00:55:49,591 --> 00:55:52,230
they're basically starting to
fall out of the fucking sky.

913
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:58,610
Um, and what kills me is in part
of this, as they started to drop,

914
00:55:58,910 --> 00:56:02,870
they started to basically fall out of
the fucking sky and not recognizing the

915
00:56:02,871 --> 00:56:06,530
sound of, of, of basically as the,

916
00:56:06,531 --> 00:56:10,370
is the air's rolling over the fucking
win over the wings there that they were

917
00:56:10,371 --> 00:56:12,710
starting,
they were going to stall.

918
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:16,100
They were so in their head looking
at the fucking screens going,

919
00:56:16,101 --> 00:56:18,800
what the fuck this, this thing's
going haywire. Where are we?

920
00:56:18,801 --> 00:56:22,820
They panicked and this
fucking guy kept pulling back.

921
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:26,490
He pulled back the fucking joy so far.

922
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:30,720
They almost got to get
to a 46 degree angle.

923
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:35,400
They said it was so far back that the
computer didn't even recognize that as an

924
00:56:35,401 --> 00:56:39,360
input that would be possible because
no one would do it. So it stops saying,

925
00:56:39,361 --> 00:56:42,420
stall that thing that you know or
pull up, pull up. It's still not,

926
00:56:42,430 --> 00:56:45,420
I wouldn't say pull up there. It stopped
warning that they were going to stop.

927
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:49,680
So then it got quiet and that literally
just falling out of the fucking sky.

928
00:56:49,830 --> 00:56:54,780
They were falling it like,
like 10,000 feet per minute at one point.

929
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:56,880
Okay,
so do the fucking math.

930
00:56:56,881 --> 00:56:59,820
They're like 36,000 feet up to falling
10th that you've got three minutes before

931
00:56:59,821 --> 00:57:02,820
you're gonna hit the deck.
Right? So these fucking guys,

932
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:07,050
that one guy goes,
no level of the nose level to know.

933
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:12,060
So he goes to level it off from 46
degrees to start bringing it back down to

934
00:57:12,241 --> 00:57:14,160
something that the computer
could actually understand.

935
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:17,610
And as he brings it down again, it
starts going stall, stall, stall.

936
00:57:18,090 --> 00:57:22,240
So he pulled back again. So it would
stop saying that shit. And then they're,

937
00:57:22,241 --> 00:57:25,260
they're calling the captain and the
captain finally goes up there and now he's

938
00:57:25,261 --> 00:57:28,680
come in in the middle of this fucking
crisis. He doesn't know what's going on.

939
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:33,180
He had, they, he at no point was
informed that the pito tube was frozen.

940
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:38,430
And at this point they had lost so much
altitude that they were down into warmer

941
00:57:38,431 --> 00:57:40,440
air in it and an unfroze and it was,

942
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:45,330
the airspeed indicator was
actually fucking working,
but they had no faith in it.

943
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:49,890
And these guys were basically
falling out of the fucking sky.

944
00:57:49,891 --> 00:57:52,950
And this is the scariest thing
when they get to 12,000 feet.

945
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:58,650
That was the last moment that they had
where they could have just pushed the

946
00:57:58,651 --> 00:58:03,651
joystick forward and started a dive and
that they will at the speed that they

947
00:58:03,871 --> 00:58:04,471
were falling,

948
00:58:04,471 --> 00:58:08,580
that they would have had enough time to
try to restart those engines and fucking

949
00:58:08,581 --> 00:58:13,230
pull back up again, you
know, and basically buzz the
surface of the fucking water.

950
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:17,370
And, um, they kept falling.

951
00:58:17,371 --> 00:58:20,130
They were fallen at one point 15,000 feet.

952
00:58:21,010 --> 00:58:21,550
Okay.

953
00:58:21,550 --> 00:58:25,260
Permitted. And uh, the whole thing,

954
00:58:25,290 --> 00:58:29,640
they just basically pancaked into the
ocean in a perfectly good airplane because

955
00:58:29,641 --> 00:58:31,020
they're pido tubes froze.

956
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:36,980
And because they panicked and because
I guess most of their hours is just

957
00:58:37,261 --> 00:58:40,170
sitting there letting something
else fly the fucking plane.

958
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:44,330
I'd never heard of this story. Uh, I
believe it's in Vanity Fair. I can,

959
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:47,160
I can't believe I just said all this
shit and I can't even tell you. And I'm,

960
00:58:47,161 --> 00:58:51,990
and of course I'm reading
this on a, uh, on a flight

961
00:58:54,590 --> 00:58:58,590
and I remember at the end of my flight,
this baby's face looking dude gets out.

962
00:58:59,210 --> 00:59:01,320
Um, baby face to me, I'm 46.

963
00:59:01,321 --> 00:59:05,540
He looked like he wasn't even 30 and
he, oh, he's doing this simple flight,

964
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:08,660
San Francisco to La. Nice quick
flight. But whatever. Yeah,

965
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:11,580
we were flying commercial airline,

966
00:59:11,581 --> 00:59:15,090
we were flying all the way up there
and uh, but it was during the day.

967
00:59:15,090 --> 00:59:16,980
So that was one thing that was
actually keeping me calm. I'm like,

968
00:59:16,981 --> 00:59:21,640
even if the pedal tubes where the frees
up the sky can still see the horizon. Um,

969
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:26,470
but anyways, man, it was
absolutely terrifying.

970
00:59:26,471 --> 00:59:30,490
And they were writing the dialogue or
the shit that they were saying and every

971
00:59:30,491 --> 00:59:33,610
input that they would like,
describe what the plane was doing,

972
00:59:34,150 --> 00:59:35,260
what they should've done,

973
00:59:35,261 --> 00:59:38,740
and then they would then they would write
out the dialogue of what they did and

974
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:43,390
what they said, and I'm telling you to
do. My fucking heart was in my throat. Um,

975
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:45,880
so for someone who flies all
the fucking time, you know,

976
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:49,510
that wasn't a very fun article
to be reading. Um, shit,

977
00:59:49,511 --> 00:59:50,860
I got to end this fucking podcast.

978
00:59:50,861 --> 00:59:53,710
I didn't even get into any of the
questions for this week. A really,

979
00:59:53,711 --> 00:59:57,550
really quickly, the Patriots came
back against the Bengals and a,

980
00:59:57,551 --> 01:00:00,490
I know a lot of people now we're going
to go all the way to the other side. Oh,

981
01:00:00,491 --> 01:00:02,370
they're gonna win the Super Bowl.
Um,

982
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:07,240
I don't think the Patriots were the
team that lost to the chiefs and I don't

983
01:00:07,241 --> 01:00:09,850
think they, they were
necessarily that team last night.

984
01:00:10,270 --> 01:00:11,950
I think there's somewhere in the middle.

985
01:00:12,010 --> 01:00:14,680
I'm hoping they're more towards
the team that beat the Bengals.

986
01:00:14,681 --> 01:00:19,000
But I think we got a couple
more brutal losses in us. Um,

987
01:00:19,210 --> 01:00:21,610
you saw what happened when Reavis
went down, and I hate to say it,

988
01:00:21,611 --> 01:00:26,220
but he gets injured a lot. Um, the second
he got injured, these fucking scored him.

989
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:31,000
God Damn. Two, three plays. But you
know what's amazing about Darrelle?

990
01:00:31,001 --> 01:00:34,390
Revis even the fact that
he's on our fucking team and
then I'm actually cheering

991
01:00:34,391 --> 01:00:36,630
for that guy who I couldn't,
I always respected,

992
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:40,240
but I hate him because he was a jet.
He's only 29 years old.

993
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:42,251
I had no idea.

994
01:00:42,251 --> 01:00:44,530
It seems like he's been in the league
forever and he also looks like he's like

995
01:00:44,531 --> 01:00:49,510
37. Um, all right, let's, uh, let's
plow ahead and the jets. Jesus Christ.

996
01:00:49,511 --> 01:00:52,510
Jts Jess just jets. They're
in a fucking bad way, man.

997
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:55,860
They are in a bad God damn
way. I didn't see that one. I,

998
01:00:55,990 --> 01:00:59,140
I watched the cowboys Texans,
which was a great game,

999
01:00:59,710 --> 01:01:03,910
won and I saw a little bit of
the bills game. Big Win for them.

1000
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:09,100
How about the Cleveland browns
coming back? Um, and also the saints.

1001
01:01:09,101 --> 01:01:11,920
A lot of great games. It was one o'clock
games. We'll fucking insane this week.

1002
01:01:11,921 --> 01:01:13,390
But uh,
I got a plow ahead here.

1003
01:01:13,630 --> 01:01:16,930
Let me just read some of your questions
and then I'll get out of here.

1004
01:01:16,990 --> 01:01:20,050
I'm Aussie with an idea.
Bill,

1005
01:01:20,051 --> 01:01:23,320
how about you shooting your next special
in Australia? You draw huge crowds here.

1006
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:27,970
And when was the last time someone
shot a special down here? Um,

1007
01:01:28,490 --> 01:01:31,070
you know what a I did
this last one down south.

1008
01:01:31,071 --> 01:01:33,680
I kind of like taping them a different
place. I don't know how to fuck.

1009
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:36,290
What kind of cameras do
you guys have over there?

1010
01:01:36,291 --> 01:01:39,410
Do you guys make movies over there?
Do you wait for us to make them for you?

1011
01:01:39,890 --> 01:01:44,780
That would be my big question. Do you
have the latest in fucking the technology?

1012
01:01:45,470 --> 01:01:49,580
Cause then maybe you know, maybe
I would die. Wasn't hey bill,

1013
01:01:49,581 --> 01:01:53,360
why don't you get on a plane and fly 14
hours and have jet lag and then do your

1014
01:01:53,361 --> 01:01:55,010
fucking special?
I'm not going to do that.

1015
01:01:55,130 --> 01:02:00,130
I will definitely be torn your country
though. We're looking at January. Um,

1016
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:02,840
all right car dear Billy oil rag.

1017
01:02:03,230 --> 01:02:05,540
I want to get an old
car and learn to fix it.

1018
01:02:05,541 --> 01:02:08,390
Every time I asked someone what
make and model year I should buy,

1019
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:09,890
they give me horrible answers.

1020
01:02:10,130 --> 01:02:15,130
Can you please narrow it down to two or
three cars from the late sixties to the

1021
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,690
early mid seventies?
That would be a great car to work on.

1022
01:02:17,930 --> 01:02:21,040
I know there are a ton of just
looking for a place to start.

1023
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:25,570
I have a little experience with
parts and repair, but not a lot.

1024
01:02:25,571 --> 01:02:29,980
That's why I want to dive right in
and learn. Thanks. Uh, well look,

1025
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:34,210
you want to call it you want to you will
you I would ask, uh, Christopher Titus,

1026
01:02:35,170 --> 01:02:38,410
he could give you that answer, but I would
tell you what I would do if I was you.

1027
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:43,750
All right? What I would do is I
would buy an old fucking engine,

1028
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:49,170
all right? That would buy, I buy
that fucking thing that you did.

1029
01:02:49,230 --> 01:02:52,860
Whatever that engine mount thing is
that you can have non engine mount that

1030
01:02:52,861 --> 01:02:56,250
thing where you can just have
it on a rotisserie. All right.

1031
01:02:56,280 --> 01:03:01,140
And I would take that entire fucking
thing apart and rebuild that engine.

1032
01:03:02,670 --> 01:03:03,300
All right.

1033
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:08,300
I might even do that a couple of fucking
times just so I got it down so that

1034
01:03:09,741 --> 01:03:12,540
that's how I would learn.
Don't go out and go buy a whole new,

1035
01:03:12,690 --> 01:03:15,510
a whole fucking car.
Just go buy a fucking engine.

1036
01:03:16,490 --> 01:03:16,950
Okay.

1037
01:03:16,950 --> 01:03:21,300
Just take the, you know, what would
you do? You'd be remove the carburetor,

1038
01:03:21,301 --> 01:03:23,100
then you've got the intake manifold,

1039
01:03:23,101 --> 01:03:25,590
then you've got the valve
covers and you got the valves.

1040
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:28,020
Take all of that shit off.

1041
01:03:29,110 --> 01:03:29,570
Okay.

1042
01:03:29,570 --> 01:03:31,760
Then you're down to your fucking
year, your Pistons. Right.

1043
01:03:31,761 --> 01:03:35,990
I'm not good with the
electrical or anything like
that, but you go all the way.

1044
01:03:35,991 --> 01:03:39,680
Do you know the cam shaft all the way
down to the crank shaft and if you just

1045
01:03:39,681 --> 01:03:40,221
start over,

1046
01:03:40,221 --> 01:03:44,450
even if you just put the thing back
to fucking gether with the old shit,

1047
01:03:44,451 --> 01:03:46,970
although probably they'll probably have
a problem trying to get some of the shit

1048
01:03:46,971 --> 01:03:49,610
off. You might break something,
but I would just do that.

1049
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:51,100
Okay.

1050
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:54,820
And I would buy,
if you could buy a four cylinder.

1051
01:03:55,060 --> 01:03:57,160
I look at it the same way I
learned how to tune drums.

1052
01:03:57,161 --> 01:03:59,840
You start with the smallest drum
that had the fewest amount of Lug.

1053
01:03:59,841 --> 01:04:02,710
So it was easier to tune because you
couldn't make that many mistakes.

1054
01:04:03,370 --> 01:04:04,770
So I would actually,
if I,

1055
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:07,930
if you can't buy an old four
cylinder engine at a junkyard,

1056
01:04:08,170 --> 01:04:09,580
I would buy an old six cylinder.

1057
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:12,070
Then you only get six cylinders
you've got to worry about,

1058
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:14,830
or you could just buy the eight cylinder
and then you've got to do everything

1059
01:04:14,831 --> 01:04:17,890
eight fucking times and you're
going to be that much better at it.

1060
01:04:18,340 --> 01:04:21,400
And I think once you fucking tear down
an engine and then just build the thing

1061
01:04:21,401 --> 01:04:25,540
back up, even if he did it a
couple, two, three times. Um,

1062
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:29,020
I mean I think that that's the way to
go two or three times just by an old

1063
01:04:29,021 --> 01:04:33,580
engine, by the whole fucking kit
on how to replace everything.

1064
01:04:34,750 --> 01:04:39,550
Go through the hell of fucking getting
it apart and shipping stuck and frozen

1065
01:04:39,551 --> 01:04:40,630
and all goop together.

1066
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:44,470
Get that whole fucking thing torn
apart and then rebuild the thing,

1067
01:04:44,620 --> 01:04:46,150
make all your fucking mistakes.

1068
01:04:46,180 --> 01:04:50,590
And then do it again and then do it
again and then do it again and then do it

1069
01:04:50,591 --> 01:04:53,080
again and then go out and buy
the fucking car you want to buy.

1070
01:04:54,620 --> 01:04:55,200
Yeah.

1071
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:55,921
You know, I mean, dude,

1072
01:04:55,921 --> 01:04:59,010
you can buy an old piece of shit fucking
engine for a couple of hundred bucks

1073
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:01,611
and then go buy.

1074
01:05:01,611 --> 01:05:04,830
What did I forget how much I was going
to do this if I ever had fucking time on

1075
01:05:04,831 --> 01:05:06,990
my life? I think that that's
the way to go about doing it,

1076
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:10,050
rather than buying a whole God damn car
that's going to have all kinds of other

1077
01:05:10,051 --> 01:05:10,884
fucking problems.

1078
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:14,520
If you just learn how to do basically
the heart of the goddamn engine,

1079
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:16,920
I really feel like all of a sudden

1080
01:05:18,030 --> 01:05:22,200
the rest of the car is not going
to be nearly as intimidating. Um,

1081
01:05:22,270 --> 01:05:25,770
maybe the transmission could
get a little la a little scary,

1082
01:05:25,771 --> 01:05:29,250
but that's another thing to go out. Buy
a fucking transmission, take it apart,

1083
01:05:29,370 --> 01:05:32,550
rebuild it, put it back together. Do
it again. Do it again. Do it again.

1084
01:05:34,950 --> 01:05:35,500
Okay.

1085
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:35,891
Sorry.

1086
01:05:35,891 --> 01:05:40,270
The battery just crapped out on me there
and now I'm fucking late and I got to

1087
01:05:40,271 --> 01:05:43,320
get going here. So yeah,
that's what I would do if, uh,
if you want to learn how to,

1088
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:47,530
you know, how to fix up a
car, I mean that's, that's,

1089
01:05:47,740 --> 01:05:49,730
that's basic. What I would
do maybe if, you know,

1090
01:05:49,731 --> 01:05:51,820
if people who are into cars
gearheads out there, if he,

1091
01:05:51,821 --> 01:05:56,110
if he know a better way to go about
it, um, which I'm sure you do. Um,

1092
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:59,770
but that's basic what I would do and a,
but if you aren't going to buy a car, man,

1093
01:06:01,430 --> 01:06:01,810
okay.

1094
01:06:01,810 --> 01:06:02,441
I don't know.
I would,

1095
01:06:02,441 --> 01:06:06,190
I would maybe one of those cars that I
always had the slant six and everybody

1096
01:06:06,191 --> 01:06:09,670
says like, the greatest engine isn't
the easiest thing to work on. You know,

1097
01:06:09,671 --> 01:06:12,220
everything's like right in a row.
All the spark plugs,

1098
01:06:12,221 --> 01:06:15,190
all of that stuff is like right there.
Um,

1099
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:21,370
I would work with dodge darts, I think
usually had those, the lower level models.

1100
01:06:21,371 --> 01:06:24,580
I don't know. I'm not, I don't
know, cars to that level, but, uh,

1101
01:06:25,570 --> 01:06:30,040
that is on a mom, you know, I would
like to do that at some point.

1102
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:33,550
Just take apart a whole engine and then
rebuild it and put it back together.

1103
01:06:33,910 --> 01:06:35,310
Even if I didn't put it in something,

1104
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:38,050
just sell it or something and
give it to somebody else. Um,

1105
01:06:38,510 --> 01:06:40,870
because I think that's cool as hell.
The Nora do something like that.

1106
01:06:40,871 --> 01:06:43,480
If I just had the fucking time in my life.
And speaking of time,

1107
01:06:43,481 --> 01:06:48,100
I don't have any time here, so I
got to a, I gotta jump off here.

1108
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:51,730
Thanks to everybody listened to the
podcast and thanks to everybody in San

1109
01:06:51,730 --> 01:06:54,820
Francisco. That was ridiculous. The
amount of people that showed up. Um,

1110
01:06:54,821 --> 01:06:58,450
I had a great time and I appreciate you
guys listening to the new material is

1111
01:06:58,451 --> 01:07:01,630
I'm working it out as I have a new
special, as I mentioned before,

1112
01:07:01,631 --> 01:07:06,610
coming out on Netflix December 5th
called, I'm sorry you feel that way. And,

1113
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:10,870

1114
01:07:10,930 --> 01:07:13,970
comedy album, vinyl, um,

01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:18,580
live and Andrew's house is available
for purchase on my website and a,

1116
01:07:18,581 --> 01:07:21,550
for those of you would like to donate
to this podcast and easy way to do it is

1117
01:07:21,551 --> 01:07:25,910
if you're going to buy
something on Amazon, uh,

1118
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:29,140
just swing by [inaudible] Dot com
first click on the podcast page,

1119
01:07:29,141 --> 01:07:31,930
click on the link and I'll, it's a bit of
a pain in the ass. Do it if you want to.

1120
01:07:31,931 --> 01:07:32,321
If you don't,

1121

I get it and it takes you right to
Amazon and I'll get credit for the,

money and whatever you buy,

1124
01:07:40,001 --> 01:07:44,590
they give me like a percentage of, uh,
whatever. That's basically how it works.

1125
01:07:44,591 --> 01:07:49,030
All right, that's it. Uh, that's
the podcast. Go fuck yourselves.

1126
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:50,440
I will talk to you next week.
