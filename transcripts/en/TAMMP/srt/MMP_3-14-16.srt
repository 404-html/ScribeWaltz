1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,420
Hey,
what's going on is bill burn?

2
00:00:03,421 --> 00:00:08,421
It's time for the Monday
morning podcast from March 14th,

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,860
2016 how are you doing? How's
it going? How are you, oh,

4
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,800
is that a new blouse? What did she
tell you? Did something different? Um,

5
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,650
is there anything worse than watching
somebody do that? You know, coming up,

6
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:30,900
when they take the two women meet, right?
And they grab each other by both hands.

7
00:00:30,901 --> 00:00:34,350
Right? And then they look at you
and they fucking hold the hands out.

8
00:00:34,351 --> 00:00:38,430
I think I've talked about this before.
Look at you. What are you doing? You know,

9
00:00:38,431 --> 00:00:40,830
secretly hating the woman
cause she looks better.

10
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:46,340
You know I can't you be like guys,
we just look each other in the attic.

11
00:00:46,341 --> 00:00:47,174
I said Pussy,

12
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:56,610
I don't know. I'm talking about,
oh Billy fucking cuisine over here.

13
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,000
I want to try and make
Gnocchi this week or no? Yeah.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,560
Where the fuck you supposed
to pronounce it? Um,

15
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:09,480
doesn't seem too fucking hard. Right?
So anyways, we got these old pants,

16
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,120
right? Like everything in my
life. It's fucking old, right?

17
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:16,500
I'm old and everything I own is old.
Cause I bought it when I was young. Um,

18
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,940
so I guess the Teflon or whatever, the
no ship with you whenever it was square,

19
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:26,300
Ted scraped off over the years and was
flaking up and somebody told my lady that

20
00:01:26,971 --> 00:01:29,820
it was getting in our food.
So now of course all my God,

21
00:01:29,821 --> 00:01:33,920
we got to get rid of them. We're
going to get cancer, you know,

22
00:01:33,921 --> 00:01:38,610
or eaten Teflon fucking omelets.
Evidently. I don't know.

23
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,110
I didn't taste it. My fucking
omics bomblets or rather delicious.

24
00:01:43,111 --> 00:01:47,080
I didn't feel any Plano
crunchy. Like, wait a minute.
What was that? What was that?

25
00:01:47,081 --> 00:01:50,610
What was that onions? Or was that
part of the frying pan? I can't tell.

26
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,920
It's such a similar taste.
Eggs and parts of the frying pan,

27
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,140
you know, I don't know.
I figured, you know,

28
00:01:58,141 --> 00:02:01,950
with the amount of booze and I
do whatever that, that, you know,

29
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,240
Teflon that went to my system got
eaten up by the fucking my liquid diet.

30
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:11,790
Right. But whatever. So now we got to
go get a fucking frying pan. So I go,

31
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:13,400
all right. You know, we, we,

32
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,280
we have one nice one and then
we had like three shit ones.

33
00:02:16,281 --> 00:02:17,460
So the three shit ones,

34
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:21,790
I guess we're giving us cancer because
someone who isn't a doctor saw,

35
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,080
saw the pants and told us that that
was what was, what was happening.

36
00:02:25,081 --> 00:02:26,820
So we threw those outs and all that.

37
00:02:26,821 --> 00:02:30,300
I'm sure those are going to be fucking
hitting some octopus on the fucking head

38
00:02:30,301 --> 00:02:32,970
when they dump it into the ocean soon
and ups and now I'm going to go buy some

39
00:02:32,971 --> 00:02:33,804
more,
right?

40
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:37,950
I already had what I needed and I throw
it out and I got to go buy some more.

41
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:42,930
Right. Classic fucking
capitalism. It's how it works.

42
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:46,700
It's how we keep it going. That's how
we keep the plates spinning. You go out,

43
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,780
you buy what you need and
then when you have it,

44
00:02:48,781 --> 00:02:50,670
you throw it out and then your rebuy it.

45
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,370
And the second people stopped doing that,

46
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:56,730
this whole country goes down the shitter.
That's it. That's how simple it is.

47
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,190
All these fucking stupid
terrorists over there, you know,

48
00:03:00,191 --> 00:03:03,340
who do think they got to come over here
and Bama. So all they gotta do is just,

49
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,930
she just start sending leaflets over here,
telling us not to buy stuff.

50
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:13,060
Hey, wait, you already own that? You
don't need to buy that. Keep the money.

51
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:17,980
Treat yourself. Put your feet up. Don't
go to the mall. Relax. You just said,

52
00:03:17,981 --> 00:03:20,620
you know, propaganda like we used
to one them in the wars, right?

53
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:24,230
We drop a drop little leaflets,
you know,

54
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,070
I would love to read one of
those everything together.

55
00:03:26,071 --> 00:03:30,890
They ain't fucking pictures
of those wartime leaflets
to try to get people like,

56
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,990
I don't understand. How the fuck
are you going to do that? Like,

57
00:03:32,991 --> 00:03:34,200
I don't think I could have a flyover.

58
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:38,240
Yankee stadium with leaflets telling
people to become red sox fan. So like,

59
00:03:38,241 --> 00:03:38,661
how do you,

60
00:03:38,661 --> 00:03:42,680
during a fucking war when the country
that's bombing your country is going to

61
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:45,890
send you a leaflet. What the fuck
does it say on it? Yeah. Hey,

62
00:03:45,891 --> 00:03:49,300
sorry about most of your
relatives. Uh, anyways,

63
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:54,620
you want to come over to our side?
We could get you a ham sandwich.

64
00:03:54,621 --> 00:03:58,460
Them fucking smoky. Um,
all right. Let's see.

65
00:03:58,461 --> 00:04:03,380
World War,
two leaflets.

66
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,920
We flipped propaganda. All right.
Let's read a couple of these.

67
00:04:06,921 --> 00:04:09,620
Let me see if this would make
you fucking switch sides.

68
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:13,130
Go from Red Sox to the
Yankees are fucking Dodgers.

69
00:04:13,131 --> 00:04:18,131
The giants are fucking avalanche to
the fucking red wings or a Michigander.

70
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,153
Hi.

71
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:30,060
You get, um, all right.

72
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:33,240
Oh, Jesus Christ. Lay this one.

73
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,310
Why are you German? Still fighting? Not
that's, that's no way to get the reader.

74
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,030
The question is extremely
difficult to answer.

75
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:47,130
Did they understand that these
people spoke to spoke German?

76
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,230
You're going to write it?
Yeah.

77
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,300
This is almost over my head and
I speak the fucking language. Uh,

78
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:57,270
why are you German still
fighting on via you, Jeremy?

79
00:04:57,271 --> 00:04:59,000
Still fighting is the fear of blues.

80
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:02,080
The fucking brains out and x
two is six of a chip. There are,

81
00:05:02,081 --> 00:05:05,220
the question is extremely
difficult to answer. In fact,

82
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:09,330
there is no reasonable answer to
it at all. You go on fighting,

83
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,500
although you cannot,

84
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,670
I should believe fucking click on the
page here so I can read this a little

85
00:05:14,671 --> 00:05:18,660
bigger. Oh, and then it always
disappears. Doesn't it always disappear?

86
00:05:18,661 --> 00:05:20,940
You just click on it. Where'd it
go? Okay. There we go. All right.

87
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:23,040
You go on fighting,
although you can not

88
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:29,470
help but realize that Germany
is losing the war. Wow.

89
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,380
Jesus. This would make me want to be
gay. I fuck these fucking assholes. Uh,

90
00:05:34,381 --> 00:05:38,520
you go on fighting. Although you know
that every day, which the war still lasts,

91
00:05:38,521 --> 00:05:40,500
meets new destruction to your homeland,

92
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:44,640
new danger and new hardships to
your family. You go on fighting.

93
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:49,230
Although it is clear that the only
people interested in the pro prolonged

94
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,010
[inaudible] of the war, someone's going
to read that in a second language.

95
00:05:53,011 --> 00:05:53,521
I can't even read it.

96
00:05:53,521 --> 00:05:58,521
Prolongation of the war or the party
leaders who want to delay at any price,

97
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,830
the consequences,

98
00:05:59,831 --> 00:06:04,060
which the Nazi defeat is inevitably
going to have for them personally.

99
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:06,680
In other words, we're
going to hang them. Uh,

100
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,910
remember that your dear
ones want you back alive.

101
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Remember also that there is only one
safe way home the way through allied

102
00:06:16,301 --> 00:06:20,230
captivity.
You know,

103
00:06:20,231 --> 00:06:23,770
we had a lot of balls dropping these
after we were firebombing fucking cities,

104
00:06:23,771 --> 00:06:25,840
Huh? Yeah. You know,
I know we just burned.

105
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:30,100
You're all fucking city to the ground
and evidently he didn't die screaming in

106
00:06:30,101 --> 00:06:34,540
agony. A, the only way for you to avoid
that is to, uh, become our prisoner.

107
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:40,720
According to the Geneva Conventions,
which has been recognized by Brazil,

108
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:45,250
you will have the following
privileges and allied captivity.

109
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:50,020
Oh Jesus. This is the, this is the
classic checks in the fucking mail.

110
00:06:50,021 --> 00:06:52,600
You will be removed immediately
from the battle zone.

111
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:57,400
You will get the same food as
allied troops. If six sick,

112
00:06:57,401 --> 00:07:00,430
you will be treated in the
same hospitals as our soldiers.

113
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:05,410
And after the end of the war, you will
go home as soon as possible. Well,

114
00:07:05,411 --> 00:07:10,360
that's pretty vague. As soon as we,
uh, decide when you can fucking leave.

115
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:14,970
Did anybody believe a word of that? I
didn't. I wouldn't do it. I was like,

116
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,990
you know what the fuck you want
these fucking guys are doing.

117
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,430
They want us to surrender

118
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:19,950
cause they don't want
us to kill more of them.

119
00:07:19,951 --> 00:07:21,490
They're just going to fucking
kill us. You know what? I

120
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:27,560
all GI, he speaks the truth. Um,

121
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:30,380
that was me in a foxhole
with a Boston accent,

122
00:07:30,381 --> 00:07:33,170
talking to somebody who sounds like
Hans and Franz. How'd you like that?

123
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:37,520
He didn't think that was coming on
the old podcast there. Did Ya? Um,

124
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:40,190
the fuck did I start talking
about World War II leaflets?

125
00:07:40,191 --> 00:07:41,900
I was talking about buying a frying pan.
Oh yeah.

126
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:46,310
So I get down the street
driving down the old road there.

127
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,340
Okay. It's a Sunday evening.
I'm like, you know what,

128
00:07:49,341 --> 00:07:53,360
I'm going to knock this shit out before
Monday comes around and all these

129
00:07:53,361 --> 00:07:56,930
assholes have to go to work. You
know what I mean? Oh, I'm sorry.

130
00:07:56,931 --> 00:08:01,080
It's an election year. All these hard
work, Joe, six backs, they put that pants.

131
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:06,890
Um, anybody who was in my ways and
ask is there either a cunt. Okay.

132
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,820
And I wish I was more enlightened to
realize that I'm just impatient. But, uh,

133
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:14,200
that's, you know, it hasn't
happened yet. So anyways,

134
00:08:14,201 --> 00:08:18,620
so I'm driving down the fucking
road crews and along, you know,

135
00:08:18,621 --> 00:08:19,520
and all of a sudden,
you know,

136
00:08:19,521 --> 00:08:23,510
they're doing road construction and then
it's just this massive fucking traffic

137
00:08:23,511 --> 00:08:27,550
jam. And I knew I had to do the podcast
tonight cause I'm doing some bullshit

138
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,690
tomorrow morning and I'm just like,

139
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,230
it can you can kids fucking city can
it just ever give you a fucking break,

140
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,780
you know,
I got to tell you something.

141
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:39,080
All these shit where they talk
about New York, you know if I can,

142
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,170
my dad,

143
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,633
oh that shit.

144
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,700
You know they're always blow in New
York about how fucking difficult it is.

145
00:08:46,701 --> 00:08:50,230
I got to tell you. Okay, there's
an outsider from Massachusetts.

146
00:08:50,231 --> 00:08:51,700
I've lived in both places.

147
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:56,220
New York is definitely has
its way grinding you down,

148
00:08:56,221 --> 00:08:58,890
but there is no place like
fucking Los Angeles Dude,

149
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:03,310
this fucking city is,
it's just, it's brutal.

150
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:08,790
It just fucking, it never,
never lets up, you know.

151
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:13,020
And then the whole time you're just baking
in the sun of the exact same weather

152
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,790
every fucking day.

153
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,130
And everyone in the east coast comes
out here and they're like here for five,

154
00:09:17,131 --> 00:09:19,650
six days. I'm like, God, this is great.
This is great. Yeah, this is great.

155
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,820
For six days it's fucking great.
But every day waking up that fucking Sun,

156
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:27,150
Sun sign, Sun Burn. It
down on your fucking head.

157
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,940
I'm telling you this fucking place.

158
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:35,900
And you combine that with being in this
business that I'm in trying to fucking

159
00:09:35,971 --> 00:09:40,740
move ahead. It is. It is brutal. Fucking
brutal and all that shit. You know?

160
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:45,030
I can't tell you how many fucking New
York comedians have moved out here and

161
00:09:45,031 --> 00:09:48,030
then move back. I moved back. First Time
I came out of it, I couldn't take it.

162
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:51,490
I was like, I gotta get the Fuck Outta
here. I'm telling you, they're always saw.

163
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:56,490
Ah, you know, New York is so fucking
real. I'll fuck you. Fuck you. Bullshit.

164
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,630
You couldn't take it.

165
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:01,710
You couldn't take it and you wanted to
move back to you familiar surroundings to

166
00:10:01,711 --> 00:10:04,710
only be 20 minutes away from
your grandmother's special sauce.

167
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,100
That's why the fuck you move back.
All right.

168
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:13,610
You dumb fucking leather coat. It
was a pizza sucks out here. You know,

169
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:19,500
I'm telling you, if I had to vote,
which is a tougher city to live in,

170
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:24,420
I would definitely say Los Angeles over
New York. It is. Fuck you Nazi. That's it.

171
00:10:24,421 --> 00:10:28,770
Fucking catches on fire out here. There's
mudslides, this fucking earthquakes,

172
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,610
you know, in New York. What's great about,

173
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:35,490
but I'm just talking basically trying to
make it in show business to live in New

174
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:38,310
York, in show business, which
is what is great about it is,

175
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:43,640
is you can get on the subway and stand
amongst a bunch of regular people,

176
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:49,560
real people, right? And then you get
to feel this feeling that you're real,

177
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,710
that you're not this big
show Biz fucking phony.

178
00:10:52,711 --> 00:10:56,430
Who wants their own Goddamn TV show.
Yeah. New York. It's so fucking real.

179
00:10:56,431 --> 00:11:00,960
Look at that chair. Look how real
that fucking chair is. Right. Um,

180
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:05,580
I just think because you know,
everybody's all mixed into fucking gather.

181
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:08,310
He ride on the subway that
these New York show Biz people,

182
00:11:08,311 --> 00:11:11,100
they just automatically think
that they're there. You know,

183
00:11:11,101 --> 00:11:14,220
everybody here is all plastic and phony
because you come out to la and the whole

184
00:11:14,221 --> 00:11:17,010
place looks like a fucking
movie set. Right? You sit there,

185
00:11:17,011 --> 00:11:20,700
you know you'd ride on the subway and you,
you sit next to some fucking,

186
00:11:20,701 --> 00:11:22,560
I don't know,
some construction worker,

187
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,060
union guy with his hard hat getting
ready and you, you start, yeah, yeah.

188
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:28,620
One of these guys now. No, you're
not. You're in show business.

189
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:30,390
You're a big fucking phony,
right?

190
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,480
You're on your way to puppet puppeteer
or school or whatever the fuck it is.

191
00:11:33,481 --> 00:11:36,090
You're doing your little song and dance
because you don't want to have a job.

192
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:41,490
Sorry, I shouldn't have said
all that shit. But you know,

193
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,280
I really should have said that having
seen all the bullshit that I've,

194
00:11:45,281 --> 00:11:49,080
I've seen like, you know,
Bernie Sanders talking about,

195
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:51,480
I don't know what the fuck he was
talking about. Like I don't think it's,

196
00:11:51,481 --> 00:11:52,314
you know,

197
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:55,840
a good way to try to bring black and
white people together by talking about how

198
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:59,370
white people have never lived in a ghetto
because automatically you just going

199
00:11:59,371 --> 00:12:03,380
to put them into a defensive
posture where they're going,

200
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,680
they're going to sit there and think
about all the shit that they've gone

201
00:12:05,681 --> 00:12:08,680
through and then they get, and then
to go, they're going to get upset.

202
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:12,610
You know what I mean? Um, yeah.
I don't, generally speaking,

203
00:12:12,611 --> 00:12:14,110
white people do not live in ghettos,

204
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:17,620
although I don't think other races of
people do not live in the middle of

205
00:12:17,621 --> 00:12:20,500
fucking nowhere off the Appalachian trail.
You know,

206
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:25,300
washing their clothes in a fucking
bathtub. Sharon, a pair of shoes,

207
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:29,080
some of that fucking horrific
poverty that I've seen, um,

208
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:32,440
that most of these fucking
politicians will never see.

209
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:36,610
I don't think it's one of
these fucking politicians.

210
00:12:36,611 --> 00:12:40,300
They should go on the road and open for
a fucking comedian who's traveling to

211
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:41,890
all these different
than you will see shit.

212
00:12:41,891 --> 00:12:44,140
You can't fucking believe
Koc levels of poverty.

213
00:12:44,141 --> 00:12:47,800
You can't fucking believe
exist in this country. Um,

214
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:50,160
I don't want to name cities,
but a,

215
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:53,290
there's some places
down South Jesus Christ.

216
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,720
I remember one time I was,

217
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,050
I drove from Indianapolis to Nashville
and there was someplace in southern

218
00:12:59,051 --> 00:12:59,591
Kentucky.

219
00:12:59,591 --> 00:13:03,520
I was running out of gas and I pulled
over and they'll fucking humanity.

220
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:09,880
My God, I swear to God, there was
something in the fucking drinking water.

221
00:13:09,881 --> 00:13:13,210
I've never seen it.
Always just like I do.

222
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:17,470
I describe these people without
just absolutely insulting them. Um,

223
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,350
I dunno, it was just like, uh, you know,

224
00:13:23,351 --> 00:13:26,980
when somebody is like so dumb,
you get nervous, you know,

225
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:29,730
they start talking to you and they're
looking at you and they're your,

226
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,070
you can tell they're just smart enough
that they know that you think that

227
00:13:33,071 --> 00:13:36,490
they're dumb and you're trying not
to fucking give it away. You know,

228
00:13:36,491 --> 00:13:38,830
she just kind of puts your eyebrows
up like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

229
00:13:38,831 --> 00:13:40,690
You try to get out of the
fucking conversation. Yeah.

230
00:13:40,691 --> 00:13:42,670
It was like an entire gas station of that.

231
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,940
Even the person running the gas station,
um,

232
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:50,740
and this was off a major highway, you
know, there was a subway, you know,

233
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,600
you know when you get drive
in the middle of nowhere,

234
00:13:52,601 --> 00:13:56,500
you don't ever go into just some
fucking, you know, mom and pop place.

235
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:01,090
You don't want to do that. What you
do is just stay, you stay brand loyal,

236
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,030
you pull into the Mcdonald's,
right?

237
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:08,890
You get gas at the fucking Sunoco
or whatever. You keep it fucking,

238
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,060
yeah.
You want to get breakfast.

239
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:13,450
Let's do you wanted to try the mom and
fucking pop place where everyone's going

240
00:14:13,451 --> 00:14:17,770
to fucking turn around and look at you
or are we going to Denny's, you know?

241
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,700
Um,
anyways,

242
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,450
I really should be talking
about politics because I,

243
00:14:24,451 --> 00:14:27,310
I literally do not watch any of it.
Um,

244
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:29,410
I know it was all that
bullshit with Trump.

245
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:34,120
I don't understand why people won't let
Trump speak and how you feel that that's

246
00:14:34,121 --> 00:14:38,080
going to derail his campaign. I think
if anything, it will just strengthen it.

247
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:39,940
Um,

248
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,380
I'm sure there's probably plenty of
Trump people that don't like what Bernie

249
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:48,400
Sanders or Hillary saying they're not
going in there and literally disrupting

250
00:14:48,401 --> 00:14:52,720
the whole fucking thing.
Right? I don't know.

251
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:57,280
Just seems stupid at me.
He sees a fucking reality TV show star.

252
00:14:57,281 --> 00:15:00,310
Just let the guy talk who gives a shit.
He's not really saying anything.

253
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:02,020
He's appealing to some people.

254
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:07,510
Who the fuck votes in a primary anyways,
aren't you guys like me?

255
00:15:07,511 --> 00:15:11,550
I vote once every fucking four years.
I hate to say it, but I do. I vote.

256
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,560
I vote for president.
That's who I vote for.

257
00:15:13,561 --> 00:15:16,960
And I always vote for the
fucking the third party person.

258
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,470
Although I don't know about Bernie Santa.

259
00:15:19,471 --> 00:15:22,480
I don't know if I'm going to fucking
vote for this guy. I'm just sick of it,

260
00:15:22,481 --> 00:15:23,470
you know? Hey, you know,

261
00:15:23,471 --> 00:15:28,070
we're going to take all the money from
fucking these 10 people and give it to

262
00:15:28,071 --> 00:15:31,390
all you guys cause all you
guys deserve it right now.

263
00:15:31,391 --> 00:15:35,330
You guys are lazy concert. Don't want to
pull their own way. You're all a joke.

264
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,720
Your angels send everybody up there
is devils right? That dumb shit.

265
00:15:40,721 --> 00:15:44,170
It's just as extra. It's, it's
fucking Donald Trump to the left.

266
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,550
I can't listen to any of it. And then
sitting right in the fucking middle,

267
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:53,580
drafted behind both of them is all fucking
square head or Self Hillary Clinton,

268
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,930
she's gonna fuck. She's going to go right
in underneath, right in, underneath.

269
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:02,170
She's going to get in there and you're
going to have listened to that fucking

270
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,070
busted trumpet for fucking
the next four years.

271
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:05,973
Yeah.

272
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:12,250
Fucking filthy, filthy family. I don't
like any of them. All three of them.

273
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,173
You know what?

274
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,620
You have a c on the Donald Trump show
when he does like a combo firing.

275
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:19,900
You know what? You'll find? You're
fucking fired and you're fired.

276
00:16:19,901 --> 00:16:22,770
That's what I would like to do with the
three of them. Dawson, when the fucking,

277
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:26,800
I could say that head on because I only
vote once every four years and I do not

278
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:30,790
watch the debates. All right, so, you
know, I'm standing on farm ground here.

279
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,880
Such a dope. Hey, you
know what I did do? Um,

280
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,680
God knows it wasn't read something.
Uh,

281
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,610
I, um, I watched on Netflix,

282
00:16:45,611 --> 00:16:49,550
I watched that Ukraine documentary
a winter on fire. It, um,

283
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,410
you know, it was just one of those
things where it's just like Jesus Christ.

284
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:54,980
Okay.

285
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:59,150
I knew I wasn't politically active,
but watching what these people did,

286
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,440
what they turned around,
I'll,

287
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:05,600
I'll try to give you a simple version
of what happened, which, you know,

288
00:17:05,601 --> 00:17:10,040
with my brain, that's all you're going
to get is basically what happened,

289
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:13,970
I guess around 2003, 2004, uh,

290
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:16,640
there was some fucking
Russian dude pro Russian dude.

291
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:19,070
He claimed that he won the fucking
election and they were like, no,

292
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:20,840
you didn't need a piece of shit.
You're rigged it.

293
00:17:20,841 --> 00:17:24,200
And they proved it and
he got bounced on 2009,

294
00:17:24,201 --> 00:17:26,660
the same dude comes back and guess what?

295
00:17:26,661 --> 00:17:30,560
He wins the election like that
wasn't corrupt. So anyways,

296
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:35,180
the Ukraine has a chance to
join the European Union, right?

297
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:39,800
To start being more like a European
country and for once and for all get out

298
00:17:39,801 --> 00:17:43,700
from underneath a, whatever you call,
whatever. Russia has a dictatorship.

299
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:49,360
So the fucking Russian dude who
allegedly got elected legitimately,

300
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:54,620
you know, listens to the people and
they say that that's what we want to do.

301
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,660
We don't want to take
a step towards Russia.

302
00:17:56,661 --> 00:18:00,830
We want to become part of
the European Union. We want
to have a future here. Like,

303
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:01,520
um,

304
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:06,170
what we see going on in western Europe
and all of the fucking politicians go,

305
00:18:06,171 --> 00:18:08,810
you got it. All right.
The people have spoken.

306
00:18:08,811 --> 00:18:11,930
We're going to do what you said
and what do you think happened?

307
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:15,170
Right in the midnight hour they gave me
all right there, Fred. They're like, yeah,

308
00:18:15,171 --> 00:18:17,720
you know what? We're not
sign to that. And, uh,

309
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:20,690
we're going to go hang out with
though Vladi daddy over there.

310
00:18:20,691 --> 00:18:23,430
Potanin let them be in Nanana.

311
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,660
We're going to fucking shoot 18 holes
of golf with him and we're going to sell

312
00:18:26,661 --> 00:18:28,000
out your country to the risky.

313
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:34,100
So started off this whole
fucking revolution. I'm not
going to say what the fuck.

314
00:18:34,101 --> 00:18:39,080
I mean, you gotta watch it. It's
unbelievable. But, um, you know,

315
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,960
I mean, it's not like, it's not the
news. I mean they ended up winning.

316
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:45,170
The somehow ended up winning and these,
these fucking people had no weapons.

317
00:18:45,171 --> 00:18:49,040
They were just getting shot
at what I don't understand.

318
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,440
I mean I do understand it, but I, I,

319
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:56,720
there's no place in the world where
you can protest. You can't do it.

320
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:57,680
You protest,

321
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:02,590
cops show up and they beat the fuck out
of you until you go home and they arrest

322
00:19:02,591 --> 00:19:05,420
a few and then that's it. Every,
what happens in this country,

323
00:19:05,421 --> 00:19:09,150
this country with all its all would
to fray brave freedom of speech.

324
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:14,010
You know those fucking occupy
Wall Street people, right?

325
00:19:14,011 --> 00:19:15,000
They come down there,

326
00:19:15,001 --> 00:19:17,730
they beat the fuck out of him and
everybody knows the old trick,

327
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,260
the same shit that they was.

328
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:22,080
They were claiming they did it in
the Ukraine where it basically,

329
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,350
when you have a peaceful
demonstration, it's like, well fuck,

330
00:19:25,351 --> 00:19:27,510
we can't beat the fuck out of him.
What should we do?

331
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,480
They hire a couple people to go
down there and pretend to be,

332
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,720
the protest is they throw a couple of
fucking rocks and then the cops go nuts.

333
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:40,320
And then on the news, they're like the
protesters started attacking the police.

334
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:43,550
You know, the police were just doing
their job well, blah, blah, blah, blah.

335
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,440
The police's job is to go down there
and beat the fuck out of him. All right,

336
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:50,830
isn't it? Isn't that what it is that
Jesus Christ built? I don't know, Bill,

337
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:53,970
what do you know? I don't know. That's,
that's kind of what I got out of it.

338
00:19:53,971 --> 00:19:55,080
I got out of it that,
um,

339
00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:00,390
it was an amazing documentary that
these people actually with basically no

340
00:20:00,391 --> 00:20:04,350
fucking weapons and just, you know, died,

341
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:08,130
lost their eyes, had all these horrific
fucking injuries, got kidnapped,

342
00:20:08,131 --> 00:20:12,980
disappeared, all of this horrific
shit and they were able to,

343
00:20:12,981 --> 00:20:15,930
um,
hold them off for a while.

344
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:19,860
So then the fucking Russian guy
ends up having to leave, right?

345
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,660
He fucking leaves and then the Yay Nay,

346
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:27,600
he's a jolly good fellow. It's all
fucking over. And then all of a sudden,

347
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,660
out of nowhere,
this,

348
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:33,180
this other revolution starts
with people who are pro Russia.

349
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:37,410
So once again,

350
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,200
all they did was they just had Russian
troops pretend to be you crazy.

351
00:20:42,201 --> 00:20:46,410
And just say, wait a minute,
we don't want to be free.

352
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:50,540
We to be oppressed. Right. So now I
guess they got to fight that thing.

353
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:55,430
It's since the, since the documentary we
made like 6,000 Ukrainian people died.

354
00:20:55,431 --> 00:20:59,150
But um, well I don't, I
don't understand why a,

355
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:00,580
yeah.

356
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,740
If you just look at the
United States of America,

357
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:06,610
the amount of money you can still make,

358
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,290
if you're up on top,

359
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:12,940
the amount of taxes you can get out of
paying the amount of parks that you can

360
00:21:12,941 --> 00:21:16,330
fuck and a half and just pass
it on to the middle class.

361
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,160
I don't understand why,

362
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:23,140
like why Russia is still does the whole
fucking a dictator thing or why any

363
00:21:23,141 --> 00:21:27,700
country does just set it up the way
we set it up. You pretend that people,

364
00:21:27,701 --> 00:21:28,960
you know, you give him, you know,

365
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,250
okay.

366
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,850
You let them be as free as
they could be, you know? Yeah.

367
00:21:33,851 --> 00:21:35,620
You do the whole rhetoric out there,

368
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:39,730
but basically there is still a ruling
class and you don't have to pay your fair

369
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:43,420
share and all that fucking shades
works out and we know you're doing it.

370
00:21:43,421 --> 00:21:46,200
But as long as you know, you let us
drive down the street and a convertible,

371
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,253
you know,

372
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:53,340
listening to some tunes, man by,
I mean somebody's got to run it.

373
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,380
I don't want to fucking do that shit.

374
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:57,163
You know,

375
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:01,010
all of a sudden make decisions.
I don't even like running my own website.

376
00:22:01,011 --> 00:22:03,710
There's no fucking way I could be sitting
there making decisions for an a whole

377
00:22:03,711 --> 00:22:08,470
goddamn country. I don't want
to do that. You know what,

378
00:22:08,471 --> 00:22:09,790
uh, what, what the, what are the, what is,

379
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:14,440
what does that like every fucking day
waking up and not a God damn problem.

380
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,630
That's why the, I think thanks.
That's why he can't have a dictator.

381
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,430
That's why they're all so brutally mean.

382
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:21,340
After a while they just get sick
of answering questions. Why?

383
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:24,260
What's the problem where I have just
fucking shoot them all right. I don't,

384
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:27,540
I don't care.
I said fucking shovel.

385
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:32,770
Put 'em in jail. Fuck. I've got
to do everything around here.

386
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:38,500
She got here and about it
anyways.

387
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:42,760
So if you get a chance, I'll try to say
is if you get a chance check out, uh,

388
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,060
Ukraine,
winter on fire and um,

389
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:47,860
okay.

390
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:50,560
I Dunno. I, I should, you should really
start paying attention to politics more,

391
00:22:50,561 --> 00:22:53,620
but I, I just think it's
all bullshit. I can't,

392
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:57,910
I can't sit there and listen to it.
I started screaming at the fucking TV.

393
00:22:59,060 --> 00:22:59,893
MMM.

394
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,620
And I get all fucking upset.
So why would I do that?

395
00:23:03,621 --> 00:23:08,060
And then I ended up with three fucking
options, none of which I want. You know,

396
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:11,990
I do have to tell you, watching
all fat boy, they're from
New Jersey. Jesus Christ,

397
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:15,050
the look on his face when he was
fucking listening to Donald Trump.

398
00:23:15,051 --> 00:23:18,770
That was the funniest fucking shit ever.
That looked like a shotgun. Wedding

399
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:25,160
it all. He was thinking, is that
a fucking fuck? Do I get it?

400
00:23:25,161 --> 00:23:29,510
I get myself into this. How do
I get out of this? You know,

401
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,180
AH,
Jesus Christ.

402
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:37,760
How much did he fucking binge
eat that night? Poor guy.

403
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:39,200
That's really bad.
It's gotta be,

404
00:23:39,201 --> 00:23:41,840
you know what sucks about being fat
is people just know it. You know,

405
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,990
you can't hide that shit and just bomb it.
Just fucking write on it.

406
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,300
You know what? Me, I guess we, I'm a
baldheaded motherfucker so I got that now.

407
00:23:49,301 --> 00:23:54,260
But when I was younger, well then I had
orange hair orange then turned red. Yeah.

408
00:23:54,261 --> 00:23:57,500
You know, I kinda got shit the whole time,
you know, if I really look back at it.

409
00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:02,210
Um, all right. Save you just some regular
brown haired Brunette fucking, you know.

410
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,353
Okay.

411
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:07,690
I'm just, you know, when you think about
Chinese people, right? Cause they don't,

412
00:24:07,691 --> 00:24:12,220
they other, any redheaded like naturally
redheaded, naturally aspirated.

413
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,860
Um,
Chinese people hang on a second here.

414
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:19,570
Natural red head,

415
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:21,370
Chinese

416
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,840
nine natural redheads from different
backgrounds, the forever war.

417
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:29,390
Why a Chinese girl has red hair?

418
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:33,980
Well because there was a fucking
military base nearby, I would think.

419
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:39,330
All right. The forever war. Why
a Chinese girl has red hair.

420
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:44,700
When you zoom out of history to the level
where empires rise and fall and people

421
00:24:44,701 --> 00:24:47,640
migrate, conquer, collapse
and absorb it disappear.

422
00:24:47,641 --> 00:24:49,800
You find that the story
is always the same.

423
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,530
That the what?

424
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:56,350
The tall stock tie stock.

425
00:24:57,130 --> 00:25:01,750
The original stock is light
non black hair. Non Brown eyes.

426
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,740
Fair skin.

427
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:04,700
Yeah.

428
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:08,810
Well am I on a racist website?
Don't fuck am I reading here?

429
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,400
MMM.

430
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:17,530
The others are darker. The
others are weaker but breed
faster. Ah, there we go. The,

431
00:25:17,531 --> 00:25:21,340
I saw the red flags.
The fuck is the name of this website.

432
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:26,580
Co Anik. Soul life to the
neanderthal death to the void.

433
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:28,060
Okay.

434
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:32,260
Christis rex the forever war.
Why a Chinese girl has red hair.

435
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,013
Oh God.

436
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,130
Fucking Internet is amazing. And I just
affected, he just gives every glutamate,

437
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,800
just a bunch of fucking dopes.

438
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,360
Yeah.

439
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,090
Why are blonde and red
hair color not seen?

440
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:51,570
Can an Asian and a natural redhead if
have a redheaded Asian look at this shit.

441
00:25:51,611 --> 00:25:56,410
The redheaded Chinese girl,
Asian red hair on Pinterest.

442
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,030
The world's first Asian redheads.

443
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,030
So I'm gonna go out on a limb and say
that they don't really don't have any

444
00:26:04,031 --> 00:26:06,220
blondes or any of that type of shit.
So I was just thinking,

445
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:10,870
do you think that people get less
shit? Like, what do you get bullied for

446
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:16,020
in, uh, in China? Oh God,

447
00:26:16,021 --> 00:26:18,720
please let to be some fucking
native Chinese people. This
does this. What are the,

448
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,880
give me the top fucking 10 reasons that
Chinese people get bullied in China.

449
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:26,770
Okay.

450
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:29,710
It's probably a usual shit.
Economic is going to be looks right.

451
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:32,530
There's always going to be
better looking mediocre.

452
00:26:32,531 --> 00:26:35,200
And then there's always going to be some
poor bastard coming down the street.

453
00:26:35,201 --> 00:26:36,910
You know, some fucking
happen. I don't know.

454
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:41,140
Something that's going on with his nose.
His fucking ears is there. The kids,

455
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:44,430
they'll, they'll, they'll find something.
Yeah, but you would think, you know,

456
00:26:44,431 --> 00:26:47,550
if everybody just had the
fucking jet black hair,

457
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:50,350
and maybe I'm more overly sensitive
to this because I just came, you know,

458
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:53,700
I came on, I came in the
world with a bullseye. Right?
Right there, there you go.

459
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:56,910
What the fuck is that?
Get it right.

460
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,313
MMM.

461
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,780
This has been a fucking crazy podcasts.
I don't,

462
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,430
and I don't have any advertising yet.
I,

463
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:09,180
this is usually the time that I tap
out and I start fucking reading.

464
00:27:09,181 --> 00:27:12,540
But it hasn't come in yet. It
has not come in yet. Let me see.

465
00:27:12,541 --> 00:27:13,980
I'll look it up right now.
See if I got it.

466
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,170
Why don't I was at 50
fucking windows open. No,

467
00:27:19,171 --> 00:27:23,100
I got a French book here that I
was reading. I wasn't reading.

468
00:27:23,101 --> 00:27:25,870
I was listening to it.
It's a book.

469
00:27:25,871 --> 00:27:28,060
Something about a wolf that
wanted to change its colors.

470
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:33,250
I've gone 15 or 16 straight
days on a dual lingo.

471
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:37,180
Asked me to say something in French.
I can't really, but you know what?

472
00:27:37,181 --> 00:27:38,320
I can read it pretty well.

473
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,253
MMM.

474
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:47,950
For, I know that that means for children.
Poor off false children. All right.

475
00:27:47,951 --> 00:27:50,110
What am I doing? I'm I completely
losing my train of thought here.

476
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,350
Oh fuck. He's something. He's a
window. This is the amount of shit.

477
00:27:55,351 --> 00:27:59,130
I look out one window. I have
French school books. All right.

478
00:27:59,131 --> 00:28:04,131
And then the next window I have
critical engine opened up on Wikipedia.

479
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:09,060
I was talking to Paul Versey cause we're
doing this tour and I was saying like,

480
00:28:09,061 --> 00:28:09,301
all right,

481
00:28:09,301 --> 00:28:13,470
these are going to be like four or five
hour drives or we could rent a small

482
00:28:13,471 --> 00:28:17,200
plane but it's going to be maybe
two to sin. Paul's me, hello, hello.

483
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,470
I don't like small plane starts
freaking the fuck out. Right.

484
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:23,070
Like small planes sticking. It's like
a Chevy Chevette a piece of shit.

485
00:28:23,071 --> 00:28:24,270
Like it's not,
it's going to die.

486
00:28:24,271 --> 00:28:26,580
And I was saying like two but
it's going to be dual engine.

487
00:28:26,581 --> 00:28:29,820
We're going to be fucking
fine. Uh, you got two engines.

488
00:28:29,821 --> 00:28:32,580
I mean the odds of them both fucking
failing at the same time and one of them

489
00:28:32,581 --> 00:28:35,280
can still fly the plane. You
fine. This is what I believed.

490
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:37,740
But then I started looking it up
cause I was trying to give them some

491
00:28:37,741 --> 00:28:41,370
information. I was saying like, look, I
mean I don't know 100% know this ship.

492
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,910
This is what I've basically been told.
And a,

493
00:28:44,911 --> 00:28:48,420
I started looking it up and evidently,
uh,

494
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,450
one engine for the most part is
more critical than the other.

495
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:54,990
And also when one engine goes out,

496
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:59,040
it isn't like he just keep flying it
normally. Well you know, we still got one.

497
00:28:59,041 --> 00:29:03,060
We're good like that.
Obviously you know,

498
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:06,750
it fucks with the not the balance.
What would it be?

499
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:10,440
I don't know how to say it scientifically.
It's not a jet engine.

500
00:29:10,441 --> 00:29:14,520
So there's no like thrust is
there? Ah, of Jesus Christ.

501
00:29:14,521 --> 00:29:16,540
Can you believe I have a pilot's license
and fucking I believe. All right,

502
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,300
let's read this year.
Uh,

503
00:29:18,301 --> 00:29:22,650
the critical engine of a multi-engine
fixed wing aircraft is the engines whose

504
00:29:22,651 --> 00:29:27,480
failure would most adversely affect the
performance or handling abilities of an

505
00:29:27,481 --> 00:29:29,850
aircraft on propeller aircraft.

506
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:33,870
There is a difference in the remaining
yawing and that's just the nose going

507
00:29:33,871 --> 00:29:38,280
right to left moments after failure of
the left or the right outboard engine.

508
00:29:38,281 --> 00:29:42,950
When all propellers rotate in
the same due to the p factor.

509
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:46,310
And I was like,
what the fuck is the p factor?

510
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:49,430
It has something to do with like when
you're flying straight and level flight.

511
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:53,060
Okay. Your propeller blades are, um,

512
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:55,570
you know,
they're there.

513
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,940
You got the angle of attack with the
wind is basically coming straight.

514
00:29:58,941 --> 00:30:01,460
You're perpendicular to the
angle of attack of the wind.

515
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:06,380
That way you are getting the most bang
for your buck with for the work that the

516
00:30:06,381 --> 00:30:07,880
engine is doing,
what the propellers.

517
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:12,680
But the more you angle nose up
or nose down, the more the wind,

518
00:30:12,681 --> 00:30:16,310
the way it's hitting, it affects the
performance. It's what I sort of believe.

519
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:20,870
I got all this Mumbo jumbo in my fucking
head. I have no idea. But I had no, I,

520
00:30:20,871 --> 00:30:24,710
so I started reading more about this
and there's all these fucking debates.

521
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:26,421
You know,

522
00:30:26,421 --> 00:30:31,040
I was always of the belief
that if you had two engines,

523
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:32,600
if you could afford to engines,

524
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,960
you buy that fucking airplane because
you know the engines run independently.

525
00:30:39,141 --> 00:30:41,810
So you got to fucking engines.
What are the odds of both of them?

526
00:30:41,811 --> 00:30:44,990
One fails and then the other
one fucking fails, you know,

527
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,470
but it's it.
So it's gotta be almost zero.

528
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,680
However, there's all
these, I could, you know,

529
00:30:51,681 --> 00:30:56,681
something I started to read about it and
there was all these debates where they,

530
00:30:57,791 --> 00:31:01,820
at first it was obviously believe that
yeah, more engines is better, it's safer.

531
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:05,510
And then somewhere along the line somebody
did a study and saw that more fatal

532
00:31:05,511 --> 00:31:07,130
action, uh, actions,

533
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:12,520
more fatal accidents happened in dual
engine aircraft and people were going

534
00:31:13,301 --> 00:31:17,060
like, oh, and then so maybe a single is
better. And then that person came back.

535
00:31:17,061 --> 00:31:20,210
It was like, no, you weren't
hearing what I was trying to say.

536
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:23,750
I was actually saying it was safe
and then it doubled back on itself.

537
00:31:23,751 --> 00:31:25,880
And I have no fucking clue what is safe.

538
00:31:25,881 --> 00:31:30,881
But what I did learn in it in a very
layman kind of way was I had no idea that,

539
00:31:30,981 --> 00:31:35,630
um, I mean it does make sense if
you just have one side working,

540
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:40,040
you know that it'd be sort of pollen
that side along of the aircraft more so

541
00:31:40,041 --> 00:31:42,970
than the other one causing the other one.
The drag and I, you'd have to, I dunno,

542
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:46,430
crab your way into the fucking wind.
I have no idea.

543
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:50,780
But all I know is I was reading it says
if one of your engines dies and the

544
00:31:50,781 --> 00:31:53,510
other one's still going,
you obviously have a much,

545
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:56,300
they said a much better chance
of making it to the airport.

546
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:59,720
They didn't say you would make it though.
And a witch.

547
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:03,860
Here's my question to anybody out
there who might know this shit

548
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:08,240
on it,
on your average twin engine airplane,

549
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:14,510
can both, both engines
independently fly the airplane?

550
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:20,630
You know what I mean? With one quick,
do they both have the ability to,

551
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:21,523
uh,

552
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,000
can basically get,

553
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:30,120
have you flying fast enough where
you can still maintain lift?

554
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,030
You know, cause then I was
then thinking like, okay,

555
00:32:34,031 --> 00:32:36,970
well if they went from one to two engines,
you know,

556
00:32:36,971 --> 00:32:38,830
you're adding more weight to the aircraft.

557
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:42,560
Well I guess you'd build a
bigger fucking plane. Sorry,

558
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:45,080
I'm trying to do this math in my head.
You build a bigger fucking plane.

559
00:32:45,081 --> 00:32:49,850
But my thing is is do they then go
all because of on certain aircraft,

560
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,530
because it's a cheaper twin engine.

561
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:57,110
It's the both engines in unison have
enough power so you can maintain lift.

562
00:32:59,331 --> 00:33:00,710
But if you lose one of them,

563
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:05,180
the other one can't still give you the
hundred percent of the lift that you need.

564
00:33:05,181 --> 00:33:09,530
You actually only have like 60% if you
still have the critical engine or only

565
00:33:09,531 --> 00:33:12,500
40% of the critical one goes out.
Like I have no idea how it works.

566
00:33:12,501 --> 00:33:16,850
All I know is it scared the fuck out
of me. That's all I can tell you. Um,

567
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,320
all right. Isn't it an amazing the
amount of topics I can talk about that.

568
00:33:21,321 --> 00:33:24,590
I have no fucking idea. It's

693
00:40:44,491 --> 00:40:48,420
We are back, I guess. Did I read it? Did
I sound good? How much did I stumble?

694
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:50,520
I never even finished
the frying pan story,

695
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,700
so I get all the way down to the
fucking frying panting. All right.

696
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,760
And we already have like the
regular whatever, a 10 inch one.

697
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:59,100
So I want to buy the eight
inch one that matches.

698
00:40:59,101 --> 00:41:01,920
And of course the only way to do that
as that to buy the whole fucking set.

699
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:03,130
Okay.

700

You know, I was just like,
you know what? Fuck you.

701
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:08,530
And I bought one of those little
pasta cutter thinks and that was it.

702
00:41:08,531 --> 00:41:10,270
And I fucking left.
And I called for the life of me,

703
00:41:10,271 --> 00:41:13,600
could understand one of them was
nine 95 the other one was 21 bucks.

704
00:41:13,601 --> 00:41:16,930
And I sat there for 10 minutes holding
both of them, trying to see like,

705
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:21,520
does it handle better?
How is this one more than twice the price?

706
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,520
I Dunno. Bill, why would you think
it's interesting to us? I don't know.

707
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:30,030
Trying to fill up a fucking hour here,

Okay.

709
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,000
By the way, I got some, I have,

710
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:37,850
I do have some dates and I will never
again announced cities, um, that I,

711
00:41:37,851 --> 00:41:40,670
that I'm saying, you know, we're working
on it. I'm never going to do that again.

712
00:41:40,671 --> 00:41:41,121
Like I said,

713
00:41:41,121 --> 00:41:45,230
what I said with buffalo
and fucking Syracuse because
that hasn't worked out yet.

714
00:41:45,231 --> 00:41:47,570
Now everybody's like, dude, what the
fuck you said you will come in there.

715
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:51,750
I shouldn't open my
big Yap. All right. Um,

716
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:54,230
I am coming to Albany.
I do know that.

717
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:59,300
So people in Buffalo, like, dude, that's
like a four hour fucking drive. I know.

718
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:03,800
I know. I'm sorry. All right. I'll, I'll,
I'll figure something out. All right.

719
00:42:03,801 --> 00:42:08,300
Here we go. On match 25th
I'm in Riverside, California,

720
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:10,131
Riverside,

721
00:42:10,131 --> 00:42:14,170
which I believe is the beginning of
the inland empire or maybe it isn't.

722
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,440
I have no idea.
Um,

723
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:20,450
on the 26th I'm at the terrorists
theatre in Long Beach, California.

724
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:24,980
Unbelievable honor to be playing in a
place that is the place where Richard

725
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:27,950
Pryor taped live in concert
where he had the red shirt,

726
00:42:27,951 --> 00:42:31,610
the black pants and the silver shoes.
I will be standing on that stage.

727
00:42:31,611 --> 00:42:34,850
I'm sure they redid it since
he's been there, you know,

728
00:42:34,851 --> 00:42:37,120
so I won't be standing on
the exact same floorboards,

729
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:39,110
but I will be within the same structure.

730
00:42:39,111 --> 00:42:44,111
It would be standing in the same place
where he did standup comedy to me,

731
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:49,300
the greatest standup comedian of
all time on the 22nd of April.

732
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:54,270
I will be in Saint Louis the oh ago.

733
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:59,000
Y'All on the 24th.
He's a great ones.

734
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:03,640
I will be in Iowa in
Ames, Iowa, 20 seconds.

735
00:43:03,641 --> 00:43:06,560
St Louis, Missouri and the
24th there'll be an ames, Iowa.

736
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:11,590
I have not been an ios since I did
the rich bitch tour way back in 2004.

737
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:16,220
Um, speaking of which, to anybody's Dick,

738
00:43:16,221 --> 00:43:18,120
one of the guys that did the
tour with Darnell Rawlings,

739
00:43:18,121 --> 00:43:22,400
did you see that TMZ video?
The guy's getting breakfast.

740
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:25,400
It's got a $12 check.
He goes outside to have a cigarette.

741
00:43:25,401 --> 00:43:29,270
He leaves his bag inside and all of a
sudden they came running out in Philly

742
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:32,900
screaming and I'm thinking he was,
he was, he was dining and dashing,

743
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:37,730
but showing it as we used to call
it in Boston. You know what I mean?

744
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,300
Fucking unbelievable.
Unbelieving.

745
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:42,170
The ends up getting in a big
fucking fight and I'll, let's see,

746
00:43:42,171 --> 00:43:44,640
he's got his bag inside.
They won't give it to them.

747
00:43:45,810 --> 00:43:46,643
MMM.

748
00:43:47,330 --> 00:43:49,600
According to the shit that I read
and it's just fucking unbelievable.

749
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:51,800
I can tell you that as a white guy,
that would not happen to me.

750
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:57,500
That would not happen to me. Um,
that, that was, that was fucked up.

751
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,030
Definitely fucked up. And
uh, you know what? It didn't
happen in Boston. All right.

752
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:05,210
All you fucking haters that happened
in Philly sake. It's all around.

753
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:06,913
MMM.

754
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:10,580
You know, it was funny. Donald threw
that punch in. The dude caught it.

755
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:14,420
Yeah.

756
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:16,790
The next time I see him,
I'm going to tease him about that.

757
00:44:16,791 --> 00:44:20,640
I wouldn't do it now because it's
fucking fresh and it was bullshit. I can,

758
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:23,230
I can definitely tell you as a
white dude, uh, that you know,

759
00:44:23,231 --> 00:44:24,620
that not we would not have happened to me.

760
00:44:24,621 --> 00:44:27,250
That's a complete racial
profiling incident,

761
00:44:27,251 --> 00:44:31,710
but it was dead fucking dude lean
back and just caught it. You know,

762
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:32,821
you ever see a picture?

763
00:44:32,821 --> 00:44:35,850
Just catch a fucking one that comes
right back to the mound. He did that.

764
00:44:35,851 --> 00:44:40,310
But with Darnell fist, um, anyways, uh,

765
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:44,640
plowed ahead. Uh, May
7th, Orlando, Florida,

766
00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:48,870
May 8th. I'll be in Jacksonville, Florida.

767
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:54,540
And a clear, what are you staring
at before? What's the matter?

768
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:56,480
I'm not,

769
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:00,240
I already gave you f o o d so let me look
at me like that and I already took you

770
00:45:00,241 --> 00:45:03,780
out. Um, well you just
want attention buddy.

771
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:05,820
You're getting lonely over there,

772
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:10,430
Huh?
All right.

773
00:45:11,290 --> 00:45:14,170
Fucking dog is so needy.
All right. Portland May,

774
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:19,450
June 4th, 2016 I'll be there. Uh,

775
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:24,100
and I also know I in the early April,
I got a bunch of Canadian dates. Uh,

776
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:29,230
they're all up on my website.
[inaudible] DOT com. Um, so anyways,

777
00:45:29,231 --> 00:45:33,820
speaking of dogs, I kind of tweeted
about this shit where, um, you know what?

778
00:45:33,821 --> 00:45:35,620
The fucking dog,
I have the biggest problem with,

779
00:45:35,621 --> 00:45:38,830
like their owners never have money
control. I'm not blaming the breed here,

780
00:45:38,831 --> 00:45:42,880
but there's just something
about the fucking the owners
and how hyper the dog is,

781
00:45:42,881 --> 00:45:46,240
is those fucking giant poodles.
There was another one today.

782
00:45:46,241 --> 00:45:47,260
I was at the supermarket.

783
00:45:47,261 --> 00:45:51,880
This person had tied it up outside and
it's just literally outside the fucking

784
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:53,370
supermarket the whole time.
Okay.

785
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:59,580
Route, route, route, route.

786
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:03,510
You just would not stop. Sorry.
I get my dog all amped up. Um,

787
00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:08,550
those fucking dogs are insane. I don't
know what the deal is with them be,

788
00:46:08,570 --> 00:46:12,130
did they? I think they are like,
they're kind of like greyhounds.

789
00:46:12,131 --> 00:46:15,210
I really just think you need to run
them around a fucking track for an hour

790
00:46:15,211 --> 00:46:17,340
every day just to get them to
get it out of their system.

791
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,500
But they got like that palm going on.

792
00:46:19,501 --> 00:46:22,980
So I don't think anybody really thinks
it's an issue. Clear. What are you doing?

793
00:46:22,981 --> 00:46:26,550
You're going to distract
me on the podcast. He can't
be this adorable right now.

794
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,410
Okay. For those of you don't
know anything about pit bulls,

795
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:35,440
they are like the most needy
fucking like love bugs.

796
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:36,321
They're ridiculous.

797
00:46:36,321 --> 00:46:40,670
Like she just wants to crawl up here and
fucking put her head in my lap and go

798
00:46:40,671 --> 00:46:42,290
to sleep.
You know what I mean?

799
00:46:42,291 --> 00:46:46,670
She's not over in the corner of fucking
doing some prison workout thinking about,

800
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:49,970
you know, people she wants to
kill right now. Right Buddy.

801
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:53,480
Now that I've stereotyped giant poodles,

802
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:56,180
I'm going to try to undo
the damage with pit bulls.

803
00:46:57,380 --> 00:46:59,960
Who's getting all my dog would try to
rip your face off if he came into the

804
00:46:59,961 --> 00:47:02,840
fucking
end of the house.

805
00:47:02,841 --> 00:47:06,620
She fucking barked at a guy yesterday
and I actually loved every second of it.

806
00:47:06,621 --> 00:47:10,610
I was sitting in my Prius on
these mean streets of Los Angeles,

807
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:13,820
downtown Hollywood.
And uh,

808
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:19,000
some fucking degenerate came
up to the window and uh,

809
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:23,630
I don't know what the fuck he's asking
for money or booze or some shit.

810
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:27,350
And my dog just fucking flipped out,

811
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:30,430
flipped out and the guy jumped
back and everything was great.

812
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,990
It's like having my own security.
Um,

813
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:37,780
and the guy was such a fucking alkie
d backed up off the car and then still

814
00:47:37,810 --> 00:47:41,980
mimed like I want to drink,
I'm trying to get some money for drinks.

815
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:49,300
I just, you know, I told him the beat it
every once in a while to tell him to be,

816
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:52,500
you know, there was a one legged homeless
guy and he seemed like he was saying,

817
00:47:53,010 --> 00:47:55,410
and he was talking to himself.
Maybe it was a little crazy,

818
00:47:55,411 --> 00:47:58,350
but I will be talking to myself too if
I had one fucking leg standing next to a

819
00:47:58,351 --> 00:48:02,310
stop sign. Right. What else are you going
to do? There's nobody else there. So him,

820
00:48:02,311 --> 00:48:03,150
I gave money to.

821
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:05,133
Okay.

822
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:07,660
And I was actually joking to myself when
I gave him the money and I drove away.

823
00:48:07,661 --> 00:48:11,360
I go high. There's, there's my good deed
for the day. Hey, let's go in and rub it.

824
00:48:11,361 --> 00:48:15,460
Tongue
rub and tug.

825
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:17,500
I can't believe fucking
people go to those places.

826
00:48:17,501 --> 00:48:22,240
Math that don't you worry that the cops
are gonna show up any second, you know,

827
00:48:22,270 --> 00:48:24,770
you lie in there with the fucking woody,
right?

828
00:48:24,771 --> 00:48:26,700
With a little fucking Woodrow Wilson,
right?

829
00:48:27,690 --> 00:48:31,200
Some girl fucking giving you real handy
and all of a sudden everybody get down

830
00:48:31,201 --> 00:48:34,560
to the ground, you know, you're like, oh
shit. Right. And what are you going to do?

831
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,000
Say it was legal.

832
00:48:36,001 --> 00:48:39,360
You're not a will that hard on to go away
before that fucking dude comes in and

833
00:48:39,361 --> 00:48:44,010
sees you with a half his stiffy, you
know, I swear to God it hangs like that.

834
00:48:44,370 --> 00:48:48,960
I was in here. I had a
problem with my shoulder, man,
they're going to arrest you.

835
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:52,110
Is she a fucking half naked?

836
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:56,300
Bring it down to the jail.
You're already ready to get fucked.

837
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:57,740
You don't even have any clothes on.

838
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:04,790
He got an oil all over your body. The
fuck is wrong with you. So anyways,

839
00:49:04,791 --> 00:49:09,320
June 5th, I'll be in Albany,
New York and a June 17th,

840
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:10,340
I'll be in,
no.

841
00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:11,840
Okay.

842
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:15,390
No work. Fucking New Jersey at the, uh,

843
00:49:15,470 --> 00:49:18,500
New Jersey fucking performance
arts center for the, uh,

844
00:49:18,501 --> 00:49:21,640
the fucking cock suck is there.
Um,

845
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:22,880
okay.

846
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:25,880
You don't really make me happy. The
other day I was watching the NHL channel.

847
00:49:25,881 --> 00:49:28,130
Obviously they were talking about how
the Bruins could potentially get the

848
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:29,570
number one seed in the east.

849
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:33,800
Unfucking believable the job
that Clode Julian has done.

850
00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:36,500
And I'll tell you something right now,
Dan Shaughnessy,

851
00:49:36,501 --> 00:49:39,890
you remember last year when you were
calling for his fucking head and saying

852
00:49:39,891 --> 00:49:42,110
maybe he stayed here too long.
You all went on and on.

853
00:49:42,290 --> 00:49:44,480
You should write an apology article.

854
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:48,680
Unbelievable how these
fucking sports writers,

855
00:49:48,681 --> 00:49:51,530
because they got nothing else to
write. We'll, we'll try to run out,

856
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:53,173
run out of town,

857
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:57,740
a fucking coach who brings us our first
Stanley Cup and almost 40 fucking years.

858
00:49:57,980 --> 00:49:58,813
Why would you do that?

859
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:00,630
Yeah.

860
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:03,480
Jesus fucking Christ. Why would
you do that? All right, let's, uh,

861
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:08,580
let's read some of the, uh, the questions
here for this week. Oh, we got an update.

862
00:50:08,581 --> 00:50:12,700
I love when there's an update number last
week, the, uh, the granny fucking war.

863
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:15,070
Yeah.

864
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:17,680
No. But that story all right
here, we got an update. Hey,

865
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:19,930
they're all Billy fucking water.

866
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:25,630
I got an update for you on this one. Uh,
the story has good news and bad news.

867
00:50:25,631 --> 00:50:28,150
All right, so last, last week, for
those of you who didn't listen,

868
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:32,360
I'll give you a little recap. There
was some kid, uh, you know, he was,

869
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:35,990
he's basically, he's engaged,
he's getting married in six weeks,

870
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:40,160
so he's over his fiance's house
as it was future in laws house,

871
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:43,460
her fucking parents. That's
all I'm trying to say, right?

872
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:48,140
So they're playing some card game and
evidently they're down to the final hand

873
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:52,760
and he has, uh, the cards
called granny water.

874
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:55,310
I don't know what the game is or whatever.

875
00:50:55,311 --> 00:50:57,860
Some people sent me pictures of
the car at the game does exist,

876
00:50:58,130 --> 00:51:02,360
but it's a really high point card
or whatever. And he was laying down,

877
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:06,410
ah, fuck, I'm yon and sorry. He
was laying down his card last.

878
00:51:07,410 --> 00:51:10,910
I basically, when he laid it down, he was
going to do the old fucking right there.

879
00:51:10,911 --> 00:51:13,080
Fred.
I won the game and uh,

880
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:16,060
he had the grantee water card and I guess
in the end of the game is probably the,

881
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:18,620
you get it, you hold onto it and
you played at a crucial point.

882
00:51:18,890 --> 00:51:21,500
So everybody's sitting there as
everybody's laying the cards down,

883
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:23,690
waiting to see who's going
to fucking lay it down.

884
00:51:23,691 --> 00:51:28,430
So this kid fucking finally his turn,
he lays it down to be like, you know,

885
00:51:28,431 --> 00:51:30,500
like hitting the last second three,
I just won.

886
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:33,440
And because he listens to the podcast,
instead of saying,

887
00:51:33,441 --> 00:51:37,430
I got the grantee water card,
he goes, he goes, look, he goes,

888
00:51:37,431 --> 00:51:41,310
it's all fucking grant now. He
goes, it's granny fucking wall.

889
00:51:42,590 --> 00:51:46,430
And just screamed it
to his in laws.

890
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:51,500
Okay, who never heard this guy curse
before and do not listen to this podcast?

891
00:51:51,501 --> 00:51:55,940
So they just stared at him
like, what? What was that?

892
00:51:55,970 --> 00:51:57,500
What is my daughter marrying?

893
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:00,290
Like he just completely screwed
the whole fucking thing up.

894
00:52:00,291 --> 00:52:03,770
So he's asking me for advice. Should he
bring it up? Should he not bring it up?

895
00:52:03,771 --> 00:52:05,450
All right, now you guys
are caught up. Here he go.

896
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:08,270
He says the story has
good news and bad news.

897
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:14,150
The good news is my fiance's parents
were super cool about the whole thing.

898
00:52:15,990 --> 00:52:16,670
Um,

899
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:21,670
I bit the bullet and waited until we went
over for game night again last night.

900
00:52:22,310 --> 00:52:27,020
I apologized, of course, and they
said they initially just thought,

901
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:30,260
why or where you're like this?
Fuck.

902
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:33,560
They initially thought it was really
odd for me to yell like that without

903
00:52:33,561 --> 00:52:38,270
knowing, without them knowing the
context. The once it was explained,

904
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:43,430
my fiance texted them about it. It
was no big deal. It was a huge relief.

905
00:52:43,431 --> 00:52:48,260
We played the game again and every
time someone played that card,

906
00:52:48,261 --> 00:52:52,400
they did the whole granny water thing
minus the fucking in the middle.

907
00:52:53,450 --> 00:52:58,040
Okay, cool. He goes, so my
embarrassment will be immortalized. Uh,

908
00:52:58,041 --> 00:53:01,970
the bad news is that I mentioned that
you read the letter on the podcast.

909
00:53:02,030 --> 00:53:06,970
Oh No. You know what? You're
one of those guys, dude,

910
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:10,400
you just like, you just like
stepping in shit. He goes naturally.

911
00:53:10,401 --> 00:53:11,720
They wanted to listen to it.

912
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:16,160
I thought it wasn't a big deal because
they lived through the story and your

913
00:53:16,161 --> 00:53:17,930
commentary was hilarious.

914
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:22,340
I warn them about the explicit nature
of your podcasts and that there were

915
00:53:22,341 --> 00:53:23,840
plenty of fucks throughout.

916
00:53:24,110 --> 00:53:28,920
The fact that he did grantee water
thing before it was even brought up,

917
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:33,180
uh, was perfect. And everyone
thought the story was hilarious.

918
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:37,710
That is until the p s
uh,

919
00:53:38,190 --> 00:53:42,840
if you recall, I may or may have not
called Hillary Clinton a current,

920
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:48,000
uh, Jesus. That's right. You
did. He goes, yeah, I know.

921
00:53:48,001 --> 00:53:52,290
I'm a dumb ass bill. My fiance just
turned to me and said, did you write that?

922
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:56,910
Uh, he said, my fiance
turned to me and said,

923
00:53:56,911 --> 00:54:01,890
did you write that with that look
on her face? I knew I was fucked.

924
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:06,300
So freckles. I did the only
thing I could, I said, oh,

925
00:54:06,301 --> 00:54:10,650
sorry about that. I didn't write
it. Bill's email screener guide did,

926
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:16,170
Andrew did, he picks the emails each
week, then writes the little opening line,

927
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:17,281
pun,

928
00:54:17,281 --> 00:54:22,260
and then sometimes throws in a ps to
make them more in attaining when I,

929
00:54:22,261 --> 00:54:24,710
why would you write this? Cause if
they listen to this, you're fucked.

930
00:54:24,711 --> 00:54:27,570
If you don't do it, I have no sympathy
for you. So here we go. He goes,

931
00:54:27,571 --> 00:54:28,201
they bought it.

932
00:54:28,201 --> 00:54:31,650
So we just listened to the rest and
we're laughing again by the end.

933
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:34,350
So I through Andrew under
the bus on that one.

934
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:38,940
I'm going to repeat my only good move
from the last story and just shut the fuck

935
00:54:38,941 --> 00:54:42,060
up about it forever in the end.
All is well.

936
00:54:42,061 --> 00:54:45,720
Thanks for reading it on the podcast.
It seemed to help smooth it over.

937
00:54:45,721 --> 00:54:48,990
No worries. Just tell him not to listen
to this one. He goes, by the way,

938
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:51,030
um,

939
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:55,320
I just bought tickets to your show and
I'm not going to say where the show is in

940
00:54:55,321 --> 00:54:57,270
case anybody's figuring
out what the fuck this is.

941
00:54:57,780 --> 00:55:02,780
It's the week after my wedding and my
fiance slash wife by that point is coming

942
00:55:02,851 --> 00:55:07,480
too. I'd love to meet you in person.
Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. Uh,

943
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:08,860
all right,
well you know,

944
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:12,860
I'll be hanging out after the Iowa.

945
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:16,080
Just scream out. Oh, I
just said where it was,

946
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:22,250
how well you fucked granny
water. Screaming out and
I'll fucking say allodia.

947
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:25,320
All right, now everybody's going
to do that there. All right,

948
00:55:25,321 --> 00:55:29,580
girlfriend leaving cleo.
Relax buddy.

949
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:33,180
Go cold. You knows this. It's
usually not cold at night.

950
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:36,780
You got a little gas left in the tank.
Hockey. You want to go? Oh, I know. Okay.

951
00:55:36,810 --> 00:55:38,850
I got it. I'm not going to say
the whole sentence. I will.

952
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:44,010
I'm going to take you know who you know
where when I'm done with this. All right,

953
00:55:44,790 --> 00:55:47,970
cool. Yoko lay down, buddy.
Could you please lay down?

954
00:55:47,971 --> 00:55:50,370
I don't have it in my heart to
yell at you here. All right, cool.

955
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:54,840
Could you lay down your fucking
[inaudible] looking to get out. Go on.

956
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:58,590
Go on please.

957
00:55:59,130 --> 00:56:03,800
Can you lay down please cleo?
Yeah.

958
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:06,960
Yeah. Step on all my shit. As you
go over there, just go lay down

959
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:14,730
Jesus dog. Whisper. I am
not. Um, oh, by the way,

960
00:56:14,731 --> 00:56:18,240
how about those fucking concert wounded
warriors? How much money did I give them?

961
00:56:18,241 --> 00:56:21,540
If they're actual pieces of shit over
there and they didn't give that fucking

962
00:56:21,541 --> 00:56:23,840
money to wounded troops,
you know,

963
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:27,590
can I sue them to get the money back and
then just give it to the fucking people

964
00:56:27,591 --> 00:56:28,730
they were allegedly going to help?

965
00:56:30,330 --> 00:56:30,820
Okay.

966
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:35,530
I am really just, I'm done. I'm
done with fucking charities.

967
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:39,130
I'm fucking done with them.
I just damn eight. Oh,

968
00:56:39,750 --> 00:56:41,160
I'm going Donald Trump on this one.

969
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:44,100
I've seen two or three bad ones and
I'm judging all of them. Fuck them.

970
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:48,840
Saint Jude, I'm sticking with them. Okay.
If they ended up turning foot that bad,

971
00:56:48,870 --> 00:56:51,930
then fuck all of them. I'm just doing
why I'm doing what I did the other day.

972
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:54,810
Drove up to somebody with
one leg at a stoplight,

973
00:56:55,050 --> 00:56:57,840
observed that they weren't fucking
wasted as much as I could tell in.

974
00:56:57,841 --> 00:57:00,960
There you go. You know, even if they were,
I'd be drinking too if I had one leg.

975
00:57:01,310 --> 00:57:04,980
Right standing at a fucking stop sign.
Um,

976
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:07,650
I know what the stop sign has to do with
it. What was the traffic light fill?

977
00:57:07,651 --> 00:57:10,260
Well, they need all, maybe
I have some yogurt, um,

978
00:57:10,410 --> 00:57:13,230
girlfriend leaving for religious mission.

979
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:17,130
Hey,
Billy Ball bag.

980
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:21,360
My girlfriend and I are both college
students and although we haven't been

981
00:57:21,361 --> 00:57:24,480
together for too long,
I could tell she is special in the way.

982
00:57:24,690 --> 00:57:28,920
When you meet the one,
you just know she's the person I have.

983
00:57:29,910 --> 00:57:34,560
She's the best person I've ever met. Kind,
funny, intelligent. And on top of that,

984
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:39,120
just drop dead gorgeous. What?
Jesus locked that down to. Um,

985
00:57:39,121 --> 00:57:41,310
if things seem to be too good to true,

986
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:45,810
what if things seem too good to
be true? Jesus Christ, I have.

987
00:57:45,811 --> 00:57:50,310
So I got to have some form of fucking
mild dyslexia or how many even dealt with

988
00:57:50,311 --> 00:57:54,240
it. I thought he is a reform. Uh, uh,
things seem too good to be true. They are.

989
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:57,030
She's Mormon.
Oh

990
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:58,890
g

991
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:01,860
and she's leaving for her mission in July.

992
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:05,130
If you don't know Mormons,

993
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:09,000
I don't give a shit about Mormons and
just anybody who is actively religious,

994
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:10,680
you know, to the point it, it,

995
00:58:10,730 --> 00:58:14,640
it affects the decisions they make in life
other than basic shit. Like, you know,

996
00:58:14,641 --> 00:58:17,100
don't throw a rocket that guy, cause
you wouldn't want him to do it to you.

997
00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:18,960
You know, I am at one
with that. But you know,

998
00:58:18,961 --> 00:58:22,260
when you start forming other
opinions on your fucking religion,

999
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:24,390
it starts to get a little,

1000
00:58:25,290 --> 00:58:29,570
a little a scion taller.

1001
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:33,830
Christie, Judy, Buddha,

1002
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:35,810
fucking Newsom, whatever it, all of them.

1003
00:58:35,811 --> 00:58:40,811
Throw them all in one fucking Maslovian
is a big fucking party and stick it on a

1004
00:58:41,091 --> 00:58:45,500
fucker part, right? Yeah.
There you go. Show me the
microwave. Right. Turn it on it.

1005
00:58:45,501 --> 00:58:46,820
Don't shut it off.
All right.

1006
00:58:46,821 --> 00:58:50,180
She's a Mormon and she's leaving for
her mission in July. If you don't know,

1007
00:58:50,181 --> 00:58:52,100
Mormons are a type of Christian.

1008
00:58:52,250 --> 00:58:55,970
I didn't know that and they
send missionaries around
the world to convert people

1009
00:58:55,971 --> 00:58:59,540
into their religion and she's
getting sent to Zimbabwe.

1010
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:03,080
Fucking Zimbabwe.
They leave for two years.

1011
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:07,310
Have to pay for everything themselves
and aren't allowed to contact home the

1012
00:59:07,311 --> 00:59:08,330
entire time.

1013
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:10,310
Yeah.

1014
00:59:10,310 --> 00:59:12,650
Why aren't they allowed to
contact home the entire time?

1015
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:14,220
Yeah.

1016
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:18,300
That's fucking weird. If she goes,
not only would that be the end of us,

1017
00:59:18,301 --> 00:59:23,090
but it's seriously hurts.
Chances of her future career aspiration.

1018
00:59:23,390 --> 00:59:26,420
We both want to become doctors.
I'm an atheist,

1019
00:59:26,421 --> 00:59:30,380
but I've recently found myself praying
to Jesus that she doesn't actually go

1020
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:33,470
because if and when she leaves,
that will be the end of it.

1021
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:36,620
I don't know what to do.
Should I break things off now?

1022
00:59:36,621 --> 00:59:39,230
Should I try and convince
her not to go waiting?

1023
00:59:39,231 --> 00:59:43,280
Is Not an option for me because we'd be
completely different people by the time

1024
00:59:43,281 --> 00:59:47,330
she gets back. Thanks
and go fuck yourself. Um,

1025
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:51,830
I dunno dude. I'm starting to think
maybe she isn't the one for you.

1026
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:56,600
If you're just gonna, you know, if
you have to debate telling her not,

1027
00:59:56,601 --> 01:00:00,140
should I just break it off or
tell her not to go? I mean,

1028
01:00:00,141 --> 01:00:02,900
I think if she really loved this woman,
you would you be going,

1029
01:00:02,901 --> 01:00:06,200
I'm just going to talk to you
until I'm blue in the face

1030
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:11,120
and tell her not to go. And then even
if she went, you'd be thinking like,

1031
01:00:11,121 --> 01:00:14,690
well maybe you know,
you'd have a rail light going.

1032
01:00:14,691 --> 01:00:16,400
Well maybe to two years.

1033
01:00:16,401 --> 01:00:21,110
I don't know if we agreed a
fucking cool it for two years.

1034
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:25,070
You know, it's only two years. When
you look at the rest of your life,

1035
01:00:25,071 --> 01:00:25,881
you kind of like,
hey,

1036
01:00:25,881 --> 01:00:29,120
we'd be two completely different
people as they pick it up now.

1037
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:34,160
Yeah. Look, she wants to go
to Zimbabwe, her, you know,

1038
01:00:34,161 --> 01:00:38,570
to spread the fucking word of a whatever
the fuck they're doing there. Yeah.

1039
01:00:38,571 --> 01:00:43,050
Let her go. Just, you
know what he looks at.

1040
01:00:43,770 --> 01:00:46,580
Somebody wants to go somewhere to go do
something and what are you going to tell

1041
01:00:46,581 --> 01:00:51,440
him not to go? Go ahead.
Yeah, go ahead. Go.

1042
01:00:51,441 --> 01:00:55,280
Go. Spread the fucking dumb shit
they put in your head and go, go, go.

1043
01:00:55,281 --> 01:00:58,070
Spread it on the other side of
the world's poor fucking Zimbabwe.

1044
01:00:58,071 --> 01:01:02,740
Peep Zimbabwean people. And he
went fucking Zimbabwe. Yeah,

1045
01:01:02,741 --> 01:01:05,760
and I was assuming you meant because
it's so far away you couldn't visit her.

1046
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:10,610
Let's see what's going on in
Zimbabwe right now. Zim. Bob,

1047
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:14,770
way as exactly how it should
be spelled. Z I m B A. Bwe.

1048
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:18,530
I'd be such a great fucking speller if
everything was spelled like Zimbabwe.

1049
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:23,720
Zimbabwe's Z I m B A, B, Wwii,

1050
01:01:24,350 --> 01:01:26,530
Zimbabwe,
Z.

1051
01:01:28,490 --> 01:01:32,780
Soon we'll be converting you to more men

1052
01:01:33,930 --> 01:01:37,890
do, do, do you got to go two years
of your life to fucking for what?

1053
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:41,280
All right.
Zimbabwe.

1054
01:01:42,140 --> 01:01:46,080
Zimbabwe's a beautiful country and
southern Africa that is known for its

1055
01:01:46,081 --> 01:01:49,290
dramatic a way. Wait, wait, wait.
Come on. Oh, this is the government.

1056
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:52,110
It's the government website. So this
is all the propaganda here. Yeah,

1057
01:01:52,111 --> 01:01:55,140
it's absolutely beautiful. You can have
your wallet, fucking tape your chest.

1058
01:01:55,141 --> 01:01:55,974
No one will take it.

1059
01:01:56,610 --> 01:01:59,130
Everybody's wonderful down here.
Everybody's welcome.

1060
01:01:59,131 --> 01:02:02,520
Please come down and spend
all your fucking money. You
know, if you don't mind.

1061
01:02:03,270 --> 01:02:03,670
Okay.

1062
01:02:03,670 --> 01:02:08,670
Zimbabwe was voted the number one place
in Zimbabwe to go three years in a row.

1063
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:13,990
Wow. Jesus, look at that. Fuck. That
puts Niagara Falls to shame. Holy Shit.

1064
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:18,520
Zimbabwe's a beautiful country in southern
Africa that is known for its dramatic

1065
01:02:18,521 --> 01:02:22,750
landscapes. Diverse wildlife,
see Cobras and tigers,

1066
01:02:23,170 --> 01:02:28,040
and it's hard working. People home
do the Great Zimbabwe Monument,

1067
01:02:28,070 --> 01:02:32,690
the mighty Victorian falls and
the majestic eastern highlands.

1068
01:02:32,691 --> 01:02:37,310
The country also boasts of worldclass
national parks in which a variety of

1069
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:41,570
animals, including the big five
can be fired. The Big Five.

1070
01:02:41,630 --> 01:02:43,280
What the fuck are the big five?

1071
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:44,953
Yeah,

1072
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:48,330
Big Five. I've got to go
lion. Who's your big five?

1073
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:51,240
It's like the Chris rock movie top five.
Give me a big five.

1074
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:55,860
I'd say the big five a.
You gotta go lion. Tiger.

1075
01:02:55,890 --> 01:02:58,200
Elephant doubt a doubt,
right?

1076
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:04,650
That's like Montana. Brady can Johnny
Unitas the third one? You never know,

1077
01:03:04,651 --> 01:03:07,440
right? Whatever. They're there
were in everybody's top five.

1078
01:03:07,441 --> 01:03:10,820
If you know anything about football,
right? All right. Lion, tiger, elephant,

1079
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:16,560
hippos, rhinos. Giraffes are big

1080
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:22,860
gorillas. Some big motherfuckers. Hang
on a second. I got to look up big five.

1081
01:03:22,861 --> 01:03:24,240
They see, this is how you
do it. Well, you know,

1082
01:03:24,241 --> 01:03:28,680
I'm going to get the sports club
big. Five sporting good, big five

1083
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:31,790
animals.

1084
01:03:32,730 --> 01:03:33,150
Okay.

1085
01:03:33,150 --> 01:03:37,910
In Africa. All right. In Africa,

1086
01:03:37,911 --> 01:03:41,300
the big five game animals are

1087
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:43,060
okay.

1088
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:44,290
The African Lion,

1089
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:52,330
the African elephant is African.
You know like what it's supposed to.

1090
01:03:52,331 --> 01:03:56,890
What the Rhode Island one, the one
at the fucking zoo. The Cape Buffalo.

1091
01:03:56,950 --> 01:03:59,650
Ah,
the African Leopard

1092
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:05,890
and the white slash black rhinoceros.
All right, so I've got three out of it.

1093
01:04:06,030 --> 01:04:09,970
Hippo. Rhino. Well, what the
fuck's the Hippel big five game.

1094
01:04:12,930 --> 01:04:16,270
All right. And Africa, the big five game
animals are American. Okay. The line,

1095
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:19,610
the elephant, the Buffalo, the
leopard, and the rhinoceros. Oh,

1096
01:04:19,611 --> 01:04:22,970
is this the thing that dentists pay
to fly over and go fucking shoot these

1097
01:04:22,971 --> 01:04:26,790
things? All right. All
right, so there you go.

1098
01:04:26,791 --> 01:04:29,850
So we learned a little something
here. That's the big five. A,

1099
01:04:29,910 --> 01:04:34,260
the largest of these are the national
park in the west and the something else

1100
01:04:34,261 --> 01:04:37,720
transfrontier park in the south
has a total area of three and nine.

1101
01:04:37,721 --> 01:04:41,010
Is that it ends. Yeah. All
right, let's get to the, let's
get to the real questions.

1102
01:04:41,970 --> 01:04:42,680
Okay.

1103
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:47,460
Um,
Americans welcome

1104
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:52,450
in Zimbabwe.

1105
01:04:53,470 --> 01:04:53,900
Okay.

1106
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:55,600
Did we do anything?
Did,

1107
01:04:55,601 --> 01:04:59,060
did the upper 1% in this
country piss them off?

1108
01:05:01,730 --> 01:05:06,690
All right. Americans in Zimbabwe that,

1109
01:05:06,691 --> 01:05:11,320
that at the de and I say, hey, looking
for fellow Americans in Zimbabwe.

1110
01:05:11,380 --> 01:05:13,420
No,
I'm not looking for a fucking pen pal.

1111
01:05:14,340 --> 01:05:14,720
Yeah.

1112
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:17,790
Six things I had wrong. Cause last
thing I read about Zimbabwe. Alright.

1113
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:20,820
Six things I had wrong
about traveling to Zimbabwe.

1114
01:05:20,850 --> 01:05:22,440
Look at those elephants and
fucking love those shoes.

1115
01:05:22,441 --> 01:05:26,820
I cannot believe people kill those things.
How could you kill an elephant?

1116
01:05:26,821 --> 01:05:28,020
I couldn't kill any of
those fucking things.

1117
01:05:29,580 --> 01:05:30,413
MMM.

1118
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:32,570
All right.
The top five things.

1119
01:05:33,020 --> 01:05:36,410
Six things I had wrong about traveling
to Zimbabwe and one I had right?

1120
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:39,800
Number one, Zimbabwe's dangerous. Uh,

1121
01:05:39,801 --> 01:05:44,801
at Matador we believe most
travel advisories in American
perceptions of overseas

1122
01:05:44,871 --> 01:05:48,870
destination being dangerous
are way overblown. I enjoy
visiting. Say that Dah, Dah.

1123
01:05:49,010 --> 01:05:50,120
The big cities.

1124
01:05:51,140 --> 01:05:51,973
MMM.

1125
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:57,660
The big cities are the are where the most
violent crime is concentrated like in

1126
01:05:57,661 --> 01:05:58,321
the United States.

1127
01:05:58,321 --> 01:06:03,321
It wasn't a surprise that then that
Victoria Falls as well as the couple of

1128
01:06:04,371 --> 01:06:07,920
national parks we visited fell to just
about a safe and is friendly is any place

1129
01:06:07,921 --> 01:06:08,701
can get,
in fact,

1130
01:06:08,701 --> 01:06:13,620
Victoria Falls has such a small town
feel that other journalists joked.

1131
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:18,090
It had the vibe of US national park
in the off season. All right, cool.

1132
01:06:18,510 --> 01:06:23,010
Zimbabwe's wildlife has all been
wiped out. This was a big one for me.

1133
01:06:23,011 --> 01:06:26,220
I love seeing wildlife.
This is making me want to go there.

1134
01:06:26,221 --> 01:06:30,360
Three hyperinflation will make
buying things a total hassle.

1135
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:34,780
You have to sing years of news coverage,
hyperinflation, and I was fixing him.

1136
01:06:35,820 --> 01:06:37,650
I'd have to carry around bricks of $10,

1137
01:06:37,710 --> 01:06:42,480
$10 billion notes to buy a bunch of beer
at the currency of Zimbabwe has become

1138
01:06:42,481 --> 01:06:44,940
so worthless.
They've retired it completely,

1139
01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:47,970
and the country now operates
at a mist of foreign currency,

1140
01:06:47,971 --> 01:06:52,350
including the South Africa, k beyond the
wildlife. There's not much to do or see.

1141
01:06:52,351 --> 01:06:54,240
There's rafting,
bungee jumping.

1142
01:06:54,780 --> 01:06:59,040
Microlight flying over victory
fall fishing. Swimming.

1143
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:04,720
All right, well, what the fuck did you
get? Right? I'm not reading all this shit.

1144
01:07:05,620 --> 01:07:10,180
Look at this fucking video. Swimming and
Victoria Falls. Get the fuck Outta here.

1145
01:07:11,130 --> 01:07:11,630
Okay.

1146
01:07:11,630 --> 01:07:14,090
This is this thing that looks like
it's bigger than Niagara Falls.

1147
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:15,920
No fucking way.

1148
01:07:20,050 --> 01:07:20,880
Okay,

1149
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:24,570
so basically the water isn't flowing
fast enough to these fucking got, okay.

1150
01:07:24,571 --> 01:07:26,370
I got to put us in a link to this video.

1151
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:28,153
Okay.

1152
01:07:30,930 --> 01:07:34,620
Who is the absolute fucking psycho
that figured out you could do that?

1153
01:07:36,210 --> 01:07:39,900
Dude, if you just saw the
pasty fat fucking white dude
who just jumped in there.

1154
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:45,030
You know, it's funny. He's there
with two fucking two black guys, man.

1155
01:07:45,060 --> 01:07:48,690
It'd be funny if they grabbed him and
threw him over. That was for slavery.

1156
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:55,830
All right, let me, uh, all
right. I got a copy of that.

1157
01:07:56,940 --> 01:08:00,780
Jesus Christ. What a fucking
low in it. There's no, no
way. There's no fucking way.

1158
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:04,530
No fucking way. All right, let's get back
to the, uh, the things here. All right.

1159
01:08:04,890 --> 01:08:05,723
MMM.

1160
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:12,390
Where am I? All right. Tinder. Oh, Billy.
Let's read some emails for the week.

1161
01:08:12,420 --> 01:08:16,640
Uh, I hooked up with this girl I
met on Tinder the first in years.

1162
01:08:16,850 --> 01:08:19,730
I'm not a bad looking guy.
I'm not a bad looking guy.

1163
01:08:19,731 --> 01:08:24,110
I think I just suck at small
talk over or over text any who.

1164
01:08:24,111 --> 01:08:27,910
This girl is 21 I didn't expect it
to go anywhere after we matched up,

1165
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:31,430
we ended up hooking up. She's really
cool. You've hung out a few times since.

1166
01:08:31,670 --> 01:08:35,810
My friend and his girlfriend
started saying that was gross.

1167
01:08:36,410 --> 01:08:38,990
Uh,
I am 30 years old now.

1168
01:08:38,991 --> 01:08:43,790
I know my friend is being lame because
his girlfriend was there but gross not at

1169
01:08:43,791 --> 01:08:47,660
all. So I let them have their
ignorant opinions. Then I
dropped the facts of them.

1170
01:08:48,110 --> 01:08:51,260
She looks more like she's 24 through
this really isn't helping you.

1171
01:08:51,470 --> 01:08:54,110
I look like I'm 25 that's
also not helping you.

1172
01:08:54,290 --> 01:08:58,430
She took extra classes to graduate
college early and is already accepted into

1173
01:08:58,431 --> 01:09:02,840
medical schools. Still not helping you.
She speaks four languages fluently. Oh,

1174
01:09:02,841 --> 01:09:05,210
I see what you're saying. She's not a
dumb fuck. She knows what she's doing.

1175
01:09:05,211 --> 01:09:06,500
I don't mean hello and goodbye.

1176
01:09:06,501 --> 01:09:09,260
She can carry on full on con
conversations in Mandarin,

1177
01:09:09,261 --> 01:09:11,180
French and Italian as well as English.
Of course,

1178
01:09:11,570 --> 01:09:16,490
she has much better table manners then
both of them. Oh, you said that. Wow.

1179
01:09:16,540 --> 01:09:17,810
If you just torched the whole friendship.

1180
01:09:17,990 --> 01:09:19,910
I pointed this out to
my friend's girlfriend.

1181
01:09:19,911 --> 01:09:24,290
It didn't have a Napkin on her lap and
her elbows were on the table and pointed.

1182
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:25,840
Okay.

1183
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:28,180
That very fact out to her as well.
Also,

1184
01:09:28,181 --> 01:09:31,000
I mentioned that when me and
this girl met for a drink,

1185
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:36,160
she put her napkin on her lap before
she bought her drink to her mouth.

1186
01:09:36,790 --> 01:09:41,260
Uh, which would have hovered over
her lap awareness levels maximum.

1187
01:09:42,580 --> 01:09:47,260
A 21. Who gives a fuck? I like to think
I'm right and then I made a good point,

1188
01:09:47,261 --> 01:09:51,970
but I need the opinion of
your honor. Billy burr. Uh,
yeah. Fuck. Damn. You're 30.

1189
01:09:51,971 --> 01:09:55,090
She's 21 who gives a shit good for you.
You're fucking crushing it.

1190
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:58,960
She's a fucking adult and a,
she's not a dope.

1191
01:09:58,961 --> 01:10:03,200
You didn't roof here and there too.
Miserable fucks in a relationship. Right.

1192
01:10:03,201 --> 01:10:06,540
We've got food coming out of
the side of their mouth. Carrie.

1193
01:10:07,570 --> 01:10:11,120
All right. My kid wants to play
football. Hey, Billy Bella,

1194
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:14,610
check Bella. Bella. Lik, um,

1195
01:10:15,790 --> 01:10:16,030
okay.

1196
01:10:16,030 --> 01:10:19,020
I'm a huge football fan. Watch
every week. Yada, Yada, Yada.

1197
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:20,560
My kid is seven and loves it too.

1198
01:10:20,710 --> 01:10:23,170
He plays baseball and
basketball and it's really fast.

1199
01:10:23,171 --> 01:10:27,520
We played catch with a football
in the yard and he's really fast,

1200
01:10:27,521 --> 01:10:30,460
which has given him the desire
to be a wide receiver. Granted,

1201
01:10:30,461 --> 01:10:32,470
it's not the worst powder
you can get on the field.

1202
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:35,830
I don't want to play football.
Uh, he's a great athlete,

1203
01:10:35,831 --> 01:10:40,000
but I'm not one of those delusional dads
who thinks he's going pro in whatever

1204
01:10:40,001 --> 01:10:44,410
he does. He's not small, but definitely
not the biggest of his age group.

1205
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:48,760
How do I not sound like a cranky old man
or worried old mother and explained to

1206
01:10:48,761 --> 01:10:50,050
him how it's not worth it?

1207
01:10:50,290 --> 01:10:53,920
Should I just show him footage from a
30 for 30 to scare the shit out of him?

1208
01:10:55,390 --> 01:10:57,900
Oh Man. Dude, that is such a, um,

1209
01:11:00,380 --> 01:11:04,060
contemporary question, relevant
question, whatever, you know. Um,

1210
01:11:05,610 --> 01:11:06,080
okay.

1211
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:09,620
I would actually defer this to
the Internet, believe it or not.

1212
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:13,780
And then you have to use your own
judgment as to whether you're listening to

1213
01:11:13,781 --> 01:11:18,310
somebody who is informed and or somebody
who isn't you can you do like a middle

1214
01:11:18,311 --> 01:11:22,850
ground and maybe hockey, maybe you can
get them into hockey I guess so you, you,

1215
01:11:22,851 --> 01:11:26,070
you'd have to like hockey if
you don't like hockey. Um,

1216
01:11:26,110 --> 01:11:30,280
cause it would have the physical
aspects of it. But um, those guys don't,

1217
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:35,230
don't fucking slam into
each other every play. Um,

1218
01:11:36,370 --> 01:11:38,620
you know what dude,
I don't know how to bring that up.

1219
01:11:38,710 --> 01:11:40,870
I would just be honest with
them and just say, listen,

1220
01:11:41,890 --> 01:11:43,810
I don't want to seem
like a cranky old man.

1221
01:11:43,811 --> 01:11:46,750
I don't want to seem like a worried
mother like you just said. But um,

1222
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:50,440
I'm really worried about
the longterm effects

1223
01:11:52,150 --> 01:11:53,440
of you playing football.

1224
01:11:53,530 --> 01:11:58,470
And I would even say longterm effects
talk to him like an adult. Just say, yeah,

1225
01:11:58,590 --> 01:12:02,670
I am worried that you know, you,
if you get hit the wrong way,

1226
01:12:02,671 --> 01:12:05,790
God forbid people get paralyzed,
people die.

1227
01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:09,570
People have fucking don't say fucking
people that have brain injuries.

1228
01:12:09,571 --> 01:12:12,660
I would go down that road and just,
I would just say to the kid,

1229
01:12:14,070 --> 01:12:14,440
yeah,

1230
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:18,580
your concerns and if he
really wants to fucking play,

1231
01:12:19,390 --> 01:12:24,360
then you know, you just do it. Peyton,

1232
01:12:24,390 --> 01:12:26,560
did you just get some
roids sent to your house?

1233
01:12:26,590 --> 01:12:29,090
You put them in your wife's
name and you get this kid,

1234
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:34,030
you let them do a cycle right before the
season starts and you let him kick the

1235
01:12:34,031 --> 01:12:37,570
fuck out of somebody else's kid and
that shows right. There you go. Okay.

1236
01:12:39,340 --> 01:12:41,380
I'm just fucking around. Obviously.
The first thing I said I would,

1237
01:12:41,381 --> 01:12:45,220
I would seek more information on that
and figure out how you do it in the best

1238
01:12:45,221 --> 01:12:49,690
way. All right, Peyton, my
house, ma'am. Dearest Bill,

1239
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:52,810
my house needs painting.
It has about six years.

1240
01:12:52,811 --> 01:12:56,740
It's been about six years since it's
been painted. We moved in four years ago.

1241
01:12:56,741 --> 01:12:58,000
I've painted a house before by,

1242
01:12:58,001 --> 01:13:01,090
my wife thinks I'm going to fuck
it up and or it will take too long.

1243
01:13:01,390 --> 01:13:06,140
You know what? I'm with her
already. Uh, I've been telling
her that I, I'll say, oh,

1244
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:10,300
it'll save thousands of dollars.
She says that's not the point.

1245
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:13,750
She's right. It's not entirely
the point. I make good money.

1246
01:13:13,751 --> 01:13:15,520
I just want to paint the house.

1247
01:13:15,850 --> 01:13:19,720
It's my first house and I feel the need
to do something to leave my mark on it,

1248
01:13:20,050 --> 01:13:24,120
literally and figuratively
speaking. Um, I'll to,

1249
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:28,270
it'll take me about three weeks to do
the whole house. Not working every day,

1250
01:13:28,390 --> 01:13:29,800
but three,
four days a week.

1251
01:13:29,801 --> 01:13:31,990
I have a neighbor who's going
to be home from college,

1252
01:13:31,991 --> 01:13:36,340
who I've introduced to music
and he's never heard. Oh,

1253
01:13:36,341 --> 01:13:37,750
listen to him to music he's never heard.

1254
01:13:37,751 --> 01:13:41,500
So it's a great excuse to give the kid
a few bucks while introducing him to

1255
01:13:41,501 --> 01:13:45,760
early Soundgarden and Jane's Addiction.
Uh, she started bringing things up like,

1256
01:13:45,761 --> 01:13:49,360
well, what if it starts raining?
She's got nothing left on this one.

1257
01:13:49,390 --> 01:13:53,650
I have to paint my house. It's not a
manly thing. It's not to prove a point.

1258
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:58,360
It's taking pride and ownership thoughts
on this. I say, you listen to your wife,

1259
01:13:59,950 --> 01:14:01,840
don't you want to do some fucking,

1260
01:14:01,841 --> 01:14:05,830
you finish your garage to
something like that. Okay.

1261
01:14:05,831 --> 01:14:09,820
Do something in there where it's a
part of a room that she doesn't have to

1262
01:14:09,821 --> 01:14:13,560
fucking deal with. Just have some pros
come over there, have them knock it out,

1263
01:14:13,570 --> 01:14:17,350
have them charge it to the fucking nose
and you sit inside drinking a fucking

1264
01:14:17,351 --> 01:14:20,950
beer. All right. This other shit
that you can do on the house.

1265
01:14:21,650 --> 01:14:25,540
Um, you know, I just

1266
01:14:25,820 --> 01:14:29,810
Peyton a fucking houses. That's a
big one, dude. That is a big one.

1267
01:14:29,811 --> 01:14:31,190
I understand that you want to do it?

1268
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:32,673
MMM.

1269
01:14:33,690 --> 01:14:36,180
But yeah, I, I'm with you wife
on this one too. You know,

1270
01:14:36,270 --> 01:14:40,980
you already got a fucking job. Okay. You
make it good money. Pay Somebody to do it.

1271
01:14:41,180 --> 01:14:41,690
All right.

1272
01:14:41,690 --> 01:14:44,610
This is a bunch of shit on my house
that I started to do and I just started

1273
01:14:44,611 --> 01:14:46,380
thinking, you know what? I'm
making a good living. Fuck this.

1274
01:14:46,381 --> 01:14:49,080
Why don't I have a pro come over.
I can do it. I can figure it out.

1275
01:14:49,081 --> 01:14:52,590
Was patching up holes in walls.
I was learning how to do that shit.

1276
01:14:53,670 --> 01:14:54,120
You know,

1277
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:58,650
I was fucking fixing the j trap under my
sink and doing all of that fucking crap.

1278
01:14:58,651 --> 01:15:00,510
It did learn all of that shit.
My last department.

1279
01:15:00,511 --> 01:15:01,860
Then I got to the house and it's like,
all right,

1280
01:15:02,010 --> 01:15:06,330
well I can do this or I can have a
pro come over here and do it and do it

1281
01:15:06,331 --> 01:15:09,120
fucking right. Okay. Now I'm
speaking for myself here.

1282
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:14,600
My house was fucking wall toward
wall floor to ceiling inside and out.

1283
01:15:14,970 --> 01:15:18,900
Do it yourself. Fucking
hacks. All right. And

1284
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:22,650
I wasn't going to carry
that fucking baton anymore.

1285
01:15:22,651 --> 01:15:25,620
Everything that I have had done on
my house has been done by fucking

1286
01:15:25,621 --> 01:15:28,950
professionals and my house is
as much as I bitch about it.

1287
01:15:29,710 --> 01:15:30,543
MMM.

1288
01:15:31,190 --> 01:15:34,340
It's 70% this shit at this point.
It really is. We'll take it,

1289
01:15:34,341 --> 01:15:36,920
this garage done and then I
got my kitchen's fucked up.

1290
01:15:38,060 --> 01:15:41,450
Don't even get me started with all
the exterior doors and windows. Okay.

1291
01:15:41,510 --> 01:15:43,970
In the wood rot and some of the
other shit I have to deal with.

1292
01:15:43,971 --> 01:15:48,970
But generally speaking, like this
fucking place is solid and I dunno, dude,

1293
01:15:48,971 --> 01:15:52,150
fuck that dude. You don't go a
fucking ladder. You know what I mean?

1294
01:15:52,151 --> 01:15:56,130
Mixing the Goddamn paint,
doing all of that bullshit. Um,

1295
01:15:56,290 --> 01:15:57,640
I would just,
I would,

1296
01:15:58,160 --> 01:15:58,993
yeah,

1297
01:16:00,030 --> 01:16:04,720
just, just pay for it. Just pay for it
and just say this bull is what you do.

1298
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:08,350
Don't just do it. Just don't do what
your wife says. Get something out of it.

1299
01:16:08,430 --> 01:16:11,050
All right. Be like, alright, you
know what I thought about it.

1300
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:13,180
I don't agree with it,

1301
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:16,930
but I know that you would feel
better if somebody else did it. Okay.

1302
01:16:16,931 --> 01:16:21,931
So I am going to hire a
professional company to paint
the house and she be like,

1303
01:16:23,460 --> 01:16:25,960
okay, good. And I'll be like, I'm
not finished. I'm not finished.

1304
01:16:26,820 --> 01:16:27,653
However,

1305
01:16:28,860 --> 01:16:30,360
because I am doing that,

1306
01:16:30,690 --> 01:16:35,690
I am going to Redo the garage and the
garage is going to be a place where me and

1307
01:16:36,871 --> 01:16:40,080
my friends, we play poker and
we smoked cigars once a week.

1308
01:16:40,230 --> 01:16:43,680
I'm gonna have my own fridge in there
that's going to be a lock on the door that

1309
01:16:43,681 --> 01:16:46,380
you do not have a key
for. When you see, um,

1310
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:50,400
exotic women walking in and out of that,
you are not to ask questions.

1311
01:16:50,430 --> 01:16:51,660
Is this understood?
Right?

1312
01:16:51,661 --> 01:16:54,630
You just say crazy shit like
that right over the fucking top.

1313
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:57,900
And then she's done laughing. Then you
say, what the fuck you really want?

1314
01:16:57,901 --> 01:17:02,070
It will pale in comparison to fucking
exotic women walking in and out of your

1315
01:17:02,071 --> 01:17:05,730
garage and you'll be fucking in.
So I would think about what else you want.

1316
01:17:06,430 --> 01:17:09,090
All right. And at the end of the fucking
day, you're going to get something.

1317
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:12,080
You want somebody else going to pay
your house, paint, uh, paint your house.

1318
01:17:12,081 --> 01:17:15,050
I think you're going to win personally
speaking. That's what I think. All right.

1319
01:17:15,051 --> 01:17:18,980
And you know what, that's a
podcast for this week, mother. Um,

1320
01:17:19,190 --> 01:17:22,580
thank you for listening as always and
I'm really excited about all these dates

1321
01:17:22,581 --> 01:17:26,280
that I have coming up and uh,
I,

1322
01:17:26,460 --> 01:17:29,810
I cannot fucking wait to go to Iowa.
I'm so excited about the Saint Louis.

1323
01:17:29,990 --> 01:17:33,560
Some of the great fucking sports fans
I've ever met my life or in Saint Louis

1324
01:17:33,561 --> 01:17:38,070
and God knows they got enough Budweiser's.
Long Beach is fucking,

1325
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:42,980
uh, the Goddamn motherfucking
Richard Pryor Gig. Riverside,

1326
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:47,430
Riverside, California. I
fucking, you know, when I was
learning how to fly, I had,

1327
01:17:47,510 --> 01:17:51,380
I had the land then when I did
the fucking French valley flight,

1328
01:17:51,381 --> 01:17:52,400
head of flight or Riverside,

1329
01:17:52,401 --> 01:17:57,080
they're not the French valley
and back to Long Beach. Um, shit,

1330
01:17:57,081 --> 01:18:00,080
I might fly over there. That
would be awesome. Um, ames,

1331
01:18:00,081 --> 01:18:03,800
Iowa obviously cannot wait to go to
there or Lando haven't been there in a

1332
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:04,800
minute. Jacksonville, Florida.

1333
01:18:04,801 --> 01:18:08,390
The last time I was there and went to a
gun gun range and shut fucking guns with

1334
01:18:08,391 --> 01:18:11,690
silencers, he think I'm not going
to do that again. Portland, Maine,

1335
01:18:11,691 --> 01:18:16,220
my old stomping grounds.
Albany, New York, Newark,

1336
01:18:16,221 --> 01:18:18,320
New Jersey. These are all
places I love all those places.

1337
01:18:18,321 --> 01:18:21,170
I can't wait to get out there.
I've been working my ass off on my act.

1338
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:23,810
If he come out, I'm gonna make you
laugh your fucking ass off. Okay.

1339
01:18:24,590 --> 01:18:27,020
So if you can make it, I would
really appreciate it. All right.

1340
01:18:27,021 --> 01:18:28,520
And I'm actually trying
to think of a tour name.

1341
01:18:28,521 --> 01:18:31,970
If you can come up with a name for it, you
know, cause these dates. I'm in Canada,

1342
01:18:31,971 --> 01:18:35,390
I'm in North America. I'm in fucking,
you know what? Canada's North America.

1343
01:18:35,391 --> 01:18:38,270
I'm in the United States of America,
right? I'm on the east coast.

1344
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:41,960
I'm in the Midwest. I'm in the south.
I can't think of a name for the tour.

1345
01:18:42,260 --> 01:18:44,030
I don't know why I have to name the tour,

1346
01:18:44,031 --> 01:18:46,130
but my agent says I got to
come up with a name for it.

1347
01:18:46,131 --> 01:18:48,710
Something in the checking in on your
tour. I don't, I don't know what,

1348
01:18:48,770 --> 01:18:53,520
if you guys got on any ideas, just
tweet them to me, uh, at Bill Burr,

1349
01:18:53,580 --> 01:18:55,630
whatever the, I don't even know
what my Twitter is. You know what?

1350
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:58,610
I don't even know where it
is. So whatever. If you've
got time to look it up,

1351
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:01,340
send it to me. If you don't, I
understand. All right. Go fuck yourselves.

1352
01:19:01,341 --> 01:19:02,180
We'll talk to you on Thursday.
