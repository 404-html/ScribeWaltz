1
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:02,820
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02,821 --> 00:00:06,300
It's bill bar and it's the Monday
morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:10,860
May 28th, 2012. How's it going?

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,870
Wow, I'm happy. Memorial Day.

5
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,700
Um, thanks to all the troops, you know,

6
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,640
that's what you're supposed to do today,
right?

7
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:29,340
Anybody and you still
recovering from the cookout,

8
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,020
your cookout for the troops,

9
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,710
your 12 pack to the head
for the fucking heroes.

10
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,090
I don't give a shit what a holiday is.
I don't give a fuck what is for.

11
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,770
Eventually enough years goes by and it's
just an excuse to become a tub of shit

12
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:48,240
and drink a 12 pack, you know, and
get all your feelings off your chest.

13
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:50,063
You know,

14
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,780
all that shit that you've been hammering
about the person that you with.

15
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:00,180
You know, a few weeks ago somebody
was asking me, Ah, you know,

16
00:01:00,181 --> 00:01:02,750
they wanted to break up with somebody and
I was saying, listen, you gotta listen.

17
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:03,210
You know,

18
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:08,210
the person who has it down how to
do the breakup was minivan men,

19
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:12,870
podcasts,
own celebrity star Al Madrigal.

20
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,930
But if you don't have
time to email Al Madrigal

21
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,790
just listened to ll cool j a big old,
but

22
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,800
I don't know why. I never really listened
to him when I was growing up. You know,

23
00:01:28,801 --> 00:01:32,010
Mama said knock you out. Oh,
did she? Is that what she said?

24
00:01:32,011 --> 00:01:35,460
Ll Cool J I don't care. You
know, I just wasn't into it.

25
00:01:35,461 --> 00:01:39,870
And his deodorant and his armpits when
he was jamming with those white guys.

26
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,930
I just, I never got into it. But lately,

27
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,580
lately I dunno. I Dunno what
happened. I just just come

28
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,180
onto my youtube shit.
I don't know what it is,

29
00:01:51,181 --> 00:01:54,090
but I was listening to some
of his stuff. Oh, I know why.

30
00:01:54,091 --> 00:01:55,650
Yesterday I was trying to remember like,

31
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,680
what was that song he used to have that
I'm the type of guy and you're the type

32
00:02:01,411 --> 00:02:03,720
of guy, he put Paprika,
what the fuck was that?

33
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:08,400
And then I listened to it and I kind of
liked it, but I hated that. Oh we, oh,

34
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:12,540
part of it really annoyed me and my co
that's why I never downloaded this shit.

35
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,200
But then on the side,
they had a ll cool j big old,

36
00:02:16,201 --> 00:02:20,550
but you know, I play drums at Michael.
Let me hear what this tracks sounds like.

37
00:02:20,551 --> 00:02:21,270
Can I put it on?

38
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:26,270
And he basically teaches you hide
a breakup with a girl in that song,

39
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:31,320
but that rap or that, uh, that rhyme,
whatever, however you supposed to say it,

40
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,970
he breaks it down and just
in fucking 11 seconds,

41
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,400
he sits his girls down.

42
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:43,050
He's basically hanging out and like some
sunglass hut or some shit and some girl

43
00:02:43,051 --> 00:02:48,051
comes in with an insane ass and
he does what every guy does.

44
00:02:48,421 --> 00:02:52,500
He stares at and he thinks, I want to fuck
that. But Oh shit, I have a girlfriend.

45
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:57,150
So what does he do? Does he
sneak around on earth? No.

46
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:00,010
He goes home and he sits
her down. He says, listen,

47
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:06,070
I met this girl named Tina.
Okay. Tina's got a big old,

48
00:03:06,071 --> 00:03:11,071
but I know that I said I'd
be true really whiteness up.

49
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:17,890
But Tina got a big old butt. So
I'm leaving you. It's, I mean,

50
00:03:17,891 --> 00:03:21,220
that's just fucking air tight.
You can't fuck with that.

51
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,670
He was 100% I don't know.
She could get mad.

52
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:30,870
I think that I think women's show expect
guys to be lion weasely pieces of shit

53
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,190
that if you actually hit him
with that level of honesty,

54
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,920
I think they would just be stunned.
Just like the chicken, the video.

55
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:43,630
Like I didn't think that
that was bad acting.

56
00:03:43,631 --> 00:03:46,570
I think that they would absolutely be
stunned if you just came home and said,

57
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:49,840
listen,
I met this girl.

58
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:53,710
I know that I said it'd be faithful to
you, but she's better looking than you,

59
00:03:53,711 --> 00:03:55,180
so I'm breaking up with you.

60
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,083
Okay.

61
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,150
What is the comeback?

62
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:05,710
There's nothing that'd be like if
your girl came home and said, listen,

63
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:10,630
I know we're together, but this guy,
you know, I met him at the mall,

64
00:04:10,631 --> 00:04:14,330
is deck is twice the size of yours
and he's got a better car. So, uh,

65
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:19,180
it's kind of a no brainer.
Amada, what are you going to do?

66
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:23,170
What are you gonna do with your little
dick in your fucking Domino's pizza?

67
00:04:23,171 --> 00:04:27,850
It's over. You just got to fucking be
like, you know, you only go around once.

68
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:31,810
So, uh, yeah, I, I, I get it.

69
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:37,390
So anyway, so if you don't
have time to email Al Madrigal,

70
00:04:37,391 --> 00:04:38,440
which you should,

71
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:43,780
which you should just listen
to a ll cool j big old bud.

72
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:50,770
You got to see his face. He
goes, so I'm leaving you. It's,

73
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:57,070
it's, I don't, can't explain it.
It's way meaner than it has to be.

74
00:04:57,071 --> 00:04:58,540
That's what it makes it funny.

75
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,400
Cause there's a way to read that where
you're kind of letting them down easily,

76
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,510
you know, but he didn't,
he just did it like, yeah,

77
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,190
this is how it works.
So they,

78
00:05:10,191 --> 00:05:15,191
you go look at that on a holiday as you
shaken off your fucking keystone lights

79
00:05:15,431 --> 00:05:17,710
that you drank for the troops,
you know,

80
00:05:17,711 --> 00:05:22,270
you're fucking bong hits for the men
and women in the Marine Corps that you

81
00:05:22,271 --> 00:05:26,230
took. Right? Flag Day's
coming up. Everybody.

82
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:30,220
Well we respect and honor
all the flags of the world.

83
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:33,950
Come on down and gets your
Busch lite for Fuck Ed.

84
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:37,800
$12 a fucking case.
Uh,

85
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:41,971
what the fuck would happen?

86
00:05:41,971 --> 00:05:44,350
What would the world be like if
there was no way to get fucked up?

87
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,530
If you couldn't get high,
couldn't get drunk.

88
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,160
Jesus. How long would marriages last
then? They'd probably be even shorter.

89
00:05:56,290 --> 00:06:00,890
Would they just be rage?
Just sitting around fucking stone sober?

90
00:06:00,891 --> 00:06:04,990
Eight and strawberry shortcake
could be horrific. Um, anyways,

91
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,950
this is the Monday morning podcast. It
is the end of May. Everybody. All right.

92
00:06:09,951 --> 00:06:11,000

101
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:49,191
All right,

102
00:06:49,191 --> 00:06:53,930
so you had till have you guys have until
Thursday midnight to make something of

103
00:06:53,931 --> 00:06:58,400
May, 2012 all right. Are you
on a fucking relationship?

104
00:06:58,401 --> 00:07:02,480
You don't want to be in,
do you want to be in this relationship?

105
00:07:02,481 --> 00:07:04,280
You don't want to be in,
in June?

106
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:08,210
Why don't you celebrate the end of
May by getting out of your fucking

107
00:07:08,211 --> 00:07:10,670
relationship and sitting down

108
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:16,730
and basically just go
with the ll cool j vibe.

109
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:21,420
Hold her hand and just go
straight up honesty and then what?

110
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:25,340
What's she gonna do? What's he gonna
do? They're going to flip the fuck out,

111
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:30,290
but the the die has been
cast to ship is set sail.

112
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:34,580
The ball is already rolling. The
Sun is setting, the rain has fallen.

113
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,470
Whatever the fuck you want to call it.
It's out there. Just put it out there.

114
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,240
Let him scream and yell and in your head.
As much as it sucks,

115
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,110
you're going to be like,
okay, I did it. I did it.

116
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:48,670
Now I just got to sit here
and get yelled at. And uh,

117
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:51,560
how long can somebody really yell
before they lose their voice and hour,

118
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,980
90 minutes and an hour and a half.

119
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:59,900
I'm going to be in the car listening to
ll cool j driving away from that thing.

120
00:07:59,901 --> 00:08:02,720
I didn't want to be in. All right. Now
I know I talk about this shit a lot,

121
00:08:02,721 --> 00:08:06,230
but I think a lot of people
are in situations like this
and they don't know how

122
00:08:06,231 --> 00:08:09,830
to sit. Somebody dumb it
just say, so I'm leaving you.

123
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:19,060
You know, if I was ll cool
j and I stopped, you know,

124
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,930
selling tickets and all that type of shit,

125
00:08:20,931 --> 00:08:22,850
that would be a side
business that I would have.

126
00:08:22,851 --> 00:08:27,851
I would take that little fucking rhyme
that he had and I would custom do it for

127
00:08:28,851 --> 00:08:33,520
everybody in their life and just, and then
people could just write you all right,

128
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:37,940
I need to charge. You charge them 100
bucks and he would write you a, you know,

129
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:43,670
four bars.
It all rhymes and you just get out exactly

130
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,090
what you say it,
you know,

131
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:54,520
just be like you eat with your mouth
open. I know I said that. That'd be true.

132
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:03,260
But to eat with your mouth open so
I'm leaving you just get right to you.

133
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:07,680
Just get right down to it.
The mom is a fucking con.

134
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:12,620
I know. I said that I'd be true. What,

135
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,930
she's fucking always coming over here and
some of the rhymes with and I, you got,

136
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:20,020
you got the idea right? Jesus Christ.
What do I have to be yellow? Um,

137
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,540
hang on a second. What the fuck just
happened? Did I knock this out? All right,

138
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:31,290
10 minutes in. Look at that. That was
an easy 10. It was a fucking easy 10.

139
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:36,030
I actually, uh, actually bought a,

140
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,210
I bought a new grill. I didn't get
to grill. You know what I bought?

141
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:43,960
I bought that fucking egg thing. Big
Ceramic was like a giant fucking avocado,

142
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,410
which sucks is I can't even talk about
the shit that I bought cause I feel like

143
00:09:46,411 --> 00:09:49,100
now it feels like it's a
commercial on this side. Um,

144
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:51,690
they're not paying me to advertise.
So what?

145
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:54,180
So what I feel now you can't talk
about them and see what happens.

146
00:09:54,181 --> 00:09:55,530
It's a catch 22.

147
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,250
Okay.

148
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:00,040
Speaking of looking like a giant avocado,

149
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,470
how bout those Boston Celtics,

150
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,670
what up Philly? How, what'd you take?

151
00:10:06,671 --> 00:10:08,410
Did you really think that that
was going to happen again?

152
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:12,850
That you were going to go into Boston
for a game? Seven on the fucking PLA k.

153
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:15,230
Okay.

154
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:18,380
And that and that, that, that wasn't
going to happen. I almost would park.

155
00:10:18,381 --> 00:10:21,080
Hey butter at that point,
if I ever made that joke,

156
00:10:21,081 --> 00:10:25,850
you guys should have just fucking
just unsubscribe. Unsubscribe.

157
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:30,650
Is that how you say it?
Um, Celtic speech, Philly.

158
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,400
I actually watched a most of the game
and then I had to go do my gig over at

159
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:36,950
flappers.
Um,

160
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:42,050
so I had to listen to the rest on a,
on the radio as I went over there,

161
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:44,030
I got to tell you stuff that,
you know,

162
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:49,430
I'm not expecting the Celtics to win the
championship. I know we're old, you know,

163
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:54,200
but, uh, the officiating
in the fucking NBA,

164
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:59,540
I don't think in any other sport.
I swear to God,

165
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,480
do the reps just dictate the
fucking pace and all that.

166
00:11:02,481 --> 00:11:06,470
And I know that I've had a fucking Tampon
in my ass about this for a long time,

167
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:11,080
but it's ridiculous. Paul,
let me ask you a question.

168
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,600
What in the ever in any game
ever forget about a game.

169
00:11:17,081 --> 00:11:21,400
Seven of an NBA playoff to
go to the conference finals.

170
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,990
Let's just say a regular season game
in the middle of fucking December.

171
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,670
Does Coby Bryan ever get called for a,

172
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,580
does he ever fall out on a fucking charge?

173
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,620
Is that call ever going to be made against
that guy? I'm going to go with never.

174
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:43,690
Right? Paul Pierce got
five files ticky tack fall.

175
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,750
They fall the guy out on a fucking charge.

176
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:50,260
It's UN fucking believable.

177
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:53,500
And just three days before,
watch,

178
00:11:53,501 --> 00:11:58,501
hope Holby I watched Colby fucking
hack a guy across both forearms,

179
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,600
but that would have been his third foul
in the second quarter and they would've

180
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:06,040
had to sit the guy. And what did
they do? They have a meeting.

181
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:09,520
The reps have a meeting and they give
it to some bumps standing next to them.

182
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,450
It's just fucking,

183
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:15,190
it's you to tell me the difference
between the NBA officiating in the

184
00:12:15,191 --> 00:12:19,500
officiating and fucking wrestling.
Okay. If you can do that, then

185
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:25,210
Jesus Christ. Sorry, did I
just lose you guys on that one?

186
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,540
Why don't you set the fucking recorder
where it's supposed to be there,

187
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:33,100
right down on the floor.
It's just bring everything down here.

188
00:12:33,101 --> 00:12:36,860
There we go, Bill. Seriously, if
you can do that, I will fucking, uh,

189
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:42,160
I will go to your town
and I will do karaoke. Um,

190
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:44,470
and I'll sing whatever
song you want me to sing.

191
00:12:44,471 --> 00:12:47,020
I'll do that ll cool j
song and I'll wind it up.

192
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:52,270
I know that I said that I
would be true. Um, that's what,

193
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:55,000
that's what kills me about the NBA.
Okay.

194
00:12:55,001 --> 00:12:59,200
I fucking ever really been watching
it because of the hangover and the

195
00:12:59,201 --> 00:13:02,380
devastation of seeing the Bruins getting
knocked out and I got into it again.

196
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:06,170
It's just like basketball is a fucking
phenomenal game. It's a pure game,

197
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,150
you know, fucking ball
in a hoop, loving it.

198
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:15,010
If those fucking striped cuts would just
get out of the way and stop taking out

199
00:13:15,011 --> 00:13:19,210
there fucking frustration that there's
some 23 year old kid who's getting more

200
00:13:19,211 --> 00:13:22,990
pussy and it's worth millions of more
dollars than you and your fucking

201
00:13:22,991 --> 00:13:27,010
footlocker outfit. So now you got to
go around and just fucking Dick to you.

202
00:13:27,011 --> 00:13:30,670
I have power.
I'm going to do what I want to do.

203
00:13:30,671 --> 00:13:34,780
I don't know if it's that shit or if it's
fucking David Stern in their rare with

204
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:39,640
the Bluetooth, whatever, whatever. So Hey,

205
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,250
New Jersey's own, Paul Versey,
he's been talking a lot of trash,

206
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:49,880
you know, talking about Oklahoma
City, you know, it's a WHO's,

207
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,480
that's who he's picking. And I
actually picked the spurs, you know,

208
00:13:52,481 --> 00:13:55,720
cause my whole theory that the spurs play,
they play basketball,

209
00:13:55,721 --> 00:13:57,520
the way your dad fights,
you know,

210
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,810
and I think that that was evident
and last night's game, you know,

211
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,450
Oklahoma came out all fucking,
you know,

212
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:10,570
all young full of piss and vinegar running
up and down the court or what do they

213
00:14:10,571 --> 00:14:13,780
do that they just started jogged
after him. I, I keep running,

214
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:17,010
keep folks like that. And
that movie colors that, that,

215
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:21,850
that street joke with a papa
bowl in the, in the, in his son,

216
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:22,990
the son,
both

217
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,810
father and son bull standing on the hill
and they're looking down at a bunch of

218
00:14:28,811 --> 00:14:33,280
cows and the sun goes, hey, let's run down
the hill and go fuck one of those cows.

219
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,700
And the dad goes, now let's walk
down and fuck them all. All right,

220
00:14:36,701 --> 00:14:39,220
that's the spurs.
Let's walk down,

221
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:41,810
pick and roll and fuck them all.

222
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:45,910
That's what they're going to do all
the way to another NBA championship and

223
00:14:45,911 --> 00:14:49,990
they're still not going to get respect
because they play in a city that nobody

224
00:14:49,991 --> 00:14:54,290
cares about. Okay. Mexicans don't
even care about San Antonio.

225
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,390
They don't.
All right.

226
00:14:56,391 --> 00:15:00,680
That's just a little stop off that they
have when they crossed the border before

227
00:15:00,681 --> 00:15:04,940
they go to like fucking, I dunno, l
pass off. All right. It was a bad,

228
00:15:04,941 --> 00:15:09,590
that was a bad example. El
Paso, I should've said a winter,

229
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:13,550
were legal immigrants
usually end up Denver.

230
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:19,330
Come right up through Albuquerque,
through Santa Fe, you know,

231
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:24,490
run past Columbine and they go right
into Denver, don't they? What does that,

232
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:26,500
is that the 35 north

233
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:32,570
or zen out the 35 goes to Austin.
This how much fucking road tribe,

234
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:37,600
road drive and road traveling.
I'd done it goes to 10

235
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:43,370
is the eight, then there's the 10
and there's a 40 and there's this 70,

236
00:15:43,371 --> 00:15:47,210
then there's the 80, then there's
the 90. That's going east, west.

237
00:15:47,211 --> 00:15:51,420
Those are evens odds go north,
south.

238
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,180
Ah Fuck.
I can't fucking remember anymore.

239
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,020
I have gives a shit anyways.

240
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:07,520
So what do you guys think? Can the
Celtics lived through another round?

241
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,990
Can they beat a, I like how they act
like, because Chris Bosch is out of it.

242
00:16:11,991 --> 00:16:16,550
Like they don't still have Lebron James
and uh, that guy with the little mouth.

243
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,293
What's that?

244
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,960
Dwayne Wade. What does with his
fish lips? I don't understand.

245
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:30,730
He looked like a fucking tuna
that can dunk. Um, all right.

246
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:35,350
What the fuck am I right now? I know
I gotta I gotta do some advertising.

247
00:16:35,351 --> 00:16:36,710
I'm sorry. People I'm
doing like, you know,

248
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:39,550
like one of these days I'm
actually going to, Nah, we'll get,

249
00:16:39,551 --> 00:16:41,170
I'm not even gonna lie to you.
I was gonna say, you know,

250
00:16:41,171 --> 00:16:45,010
one of these days I'm going to get this
thing into a studio and you know there's

251
00:16:45,011 --> 00:16:46,090
going to be the guy,

252
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:50,060
the the fucking Baba booey guy who
comes in or the fucking this guy.

253
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:55,190
This is not happening. All right. It
isn't, this is what it is. All right?

254
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,780
It's just like ACDC his first album.
Okay.

255
00:16:58,781 --> 00:17:01,390
Do you think that they were
going to do something else? Now?

256
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,410
This is what we're doing.

257
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:07,390
Three chords kick in the cunt
and a guitar solo and that's it.

258
00:17:07,391 --> 00:17:09,790
Go Fuck yourself with done
until the next one comes out.

259
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:14,680
That's what I'm doing with this. All
right. I don't have time. Yes, I do.

260
00:17:14,681 --> 00:17:18,370
I have. I have the time or I'm
lazy. All right, well fuck you.

261
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:22,410
You put shit off and your life's don't
ya? All right, here's one for you,

262
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:28,090
the man. Great. Everybody and
I just received my first man.

263
00:17:28,091 --> 00:17:32,740
Great. They just sent me a free one. Um,

264
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:37,350
this father's day, they're there.
There's only one. Perfect. Yeah.

265
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,110
If you guys all grilled
this weekend on you,

266
00:17:39,111 --> 00:17:43,120
a little Hibachi is with those anorexic
little grates that you have and all the

267
00:17:43,121 --> 00:17:47,170
grease drips down and light shoe egg
mcmuffin on fire. Isn't that annoying?

268
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:52,920
You know, cause that's one of the things
that you really, you get judged as a guy,

269
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:56,850
you know what I mean? What your woman
looks like, what kind of car you drive,

270
00:17:57,030 --> 00:18:01,530
and then your skills on the grill.
Okay. That's how you're judged.

271
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:05,220
And I'm sure that this will be made fun
of some day on a show like the office.

272
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:09,840
They will somehow try and
uh, just, they'll show a
guy who's good on the grill,

273
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,050
right? And then somehow they say,
but you know, underneath he has,

274
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:15,340
he has an underlying insecurity,
right?

275
00:18:15,341 --> 00:18:19,470
Because no one could just be the
fucking man anymore. I'm the man. Great.

276
00:18:19,471 --> 00:18:22,020
Everybody,
this is the deal.

277
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:26,790
It's a grill enhancement system.
You don't have to go buy a new grill.

278
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,560
Do you already have a grill? Are you
nodding your head? Yes. All right.

279
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:36,210
Once you like to fucking
put a supercharger on it,
that's what the man great is.

280
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:38,520
All right. Oh, the next line.

281
00:18:38,521 --> 00:18:43,350
What does a man great us man grates

American's jobs and you're grilling.

283

Good Lord. All we need is a stripper
in here and written an American flag.

284
00:18:51,991 --> 00:18:54,880

286

Now,

287
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:02,640

to grill correctly. Um, or at least,

290
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:16,170
you know what I'm trying to say here with
man grades, patented design, chicken,

291
00:19:16,171 --> 00:19:20,670
steak or veggies for all the
trader Joe People, veggies.

292
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:25,050
We'll have never tasted so good. No
more flip flare ups. No more dry meat.

293
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:27,690

294
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,510

talking trash to your friends about
how good your burgers are going to be.

298
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:39,181

stuff here. Um, you know,

315
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:39,750
lately I've been asking,

316
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:45,330
I've been asking some of the
ladies to write in and uh, finally,

317
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:49,720
I haven't even read this yet, but
this already seems like gold. This is,

318
00:20:49,721 --> 00:20:50,920
this is the,
the

319
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:56,300
on the subject line of this email it says,

320
00:20:56,301 --> 00:20:58,490
I think the guy I'm dating is a pussy.

321
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,260
Hello Bill.
I am a 21 year old student.

322
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:10,410
I began listening to your podcast recently
and I heard you complaining about how

323
00:21:10,451 --> 00:21:15,160
women have not written in on awhile and
being a woman myself decided to do so

324
00:21:15,161 --> 00:21:18,190
and ask you for advice.
Well, God bless you. Uh,

325
00:21:18,191 --> 00:21:21,940
I live at home with my mom and go to
college. I recently found a very nice guy.

326
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,270
Uh, they were college
and was really into them,

327
00:21:25,271 --> 00:21:27,700
but then I started
suspecting something strange.

328
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:30,610
I started suspecting that
maybe he was a pussy.

329
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:34,300
At first I thought it was pretty harmless,

330
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:38,050
but then one night we had a house
party and everyone was pretty drunk.

331
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:43,290
And a friend of mine who I haven't seen
in a while was there and when everyone

332
00:21:43,451 --> 00:21:45,700
was way, way, way past drunk,

333
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:51,690
she tried to get into a fight with me
and eventually pushed me down the wall,

334
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:56,560
then stole my iPhone and he
was there and did nothing.

335
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,740
Jesus Christ.

336
00:21:59,741 --> 00:22:03,610
I was so scared that I called
my ex to come get me any did.

337
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:05,210
Okay.

338
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:09,010
Wow.
Uh,

339
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:10,770
you think you're dating a pussy?

340
00:22:10,771 --> 00:22:15,450
I mean that right there g and he just
stood there and let this other guy who

341
00:22:15,451 --> 00:22:18,360
used to hook up with you come
in riding in on his white horse.

342
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:24,070
Anyways, my ex was more of a
man than the guy was dating now,

343
00:22:24,071 --> 00:22:26,200
even though the guy I'm dating was drunk,

344
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:29,680
I felt like he should have protected
me or done something, anything.

345
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:30,700
He did nothing.

346
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,650
And later he even confessed to me that
he was scared of my drunk friend and even

347
00:22:35,651 --> 00:22:38,800
scared of me. What the fuck? Right.

348
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,710
Even though he says this
will never happen again.

349
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:46,300
I have enough knowledge to know that
people do do not usually change like that.

350
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:51,400
You know? That's a really wise that
you're really wise for your age at 21,

351
00:22:51,401 --> 00:22:55,600
if you, if you're already not buying
into the, I'm going to change.

352
00:22:56,370 --> 00:23:00,790
That's a, you're, you're wise
beyond your years. You know,

353
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,010
they say that you're basically,

354
00:23:03,011 --> 00:23:05,650
your psychological makeup is
done by the time you three.

355
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,570
So if you see some
little toddler standing,

356
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:11,830
there was somebody is taking his blocks,
that kid's going to be a pussy

357
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:19,550
anyways, so should I be upset or give him
another chance? Is this a deal breaker?

358
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,600
Is there no way to change a
guy from a pussy to a real man?

359
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:27,140
Should I just break things
off with him and if so,

360
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:31,150
should I remain friends with him?
Thanks, Bill. I hope you read this. Uh,

361
00:23:31,151 --> 00:23:34,880
I love you and Nia. Oh,
that's nice. Um, all right.

362
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,093
This is the deal.

363
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:38,590
Okay.

364
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:40,180
Uh,
you asking a question?

365
00:23:40,181 --> 00:23:43,690
Is there no way to change a
guy from a pussy to a real man?

366
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,340
Yeah,

367
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,220
no,
I don't

368
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:49,000
think,
I think that that happens.

369
00:23:49,001 --> 00:23:54,001
I think it happens way more in movies
where somebody has a life changing moment.

370
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:55,893
Uh,

371
00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:00,810
and then they just decide I'm
not gonna take shit anymore.

372
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,460
But even then,

373
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:07,410
that just begins the journey of not
being a pussy. You don't just say,

374
00:24:07,411 --> 00:24:10,850
I'm not going to be a posting and Bam,
you're not a pussy anymore. You have,

375
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,090
you got to work your way up.

376
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:15,510
It's like if you were a hundred pounds
overweight and you like this, I'm done.

377
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:19,140
I'm not eating fucking ice cream anymore.
The next day you don't have a six pack,

378
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:23,730
you know, it takes a fucking
year or something. You
really got to turn it around.

379
00:24:23,731 --> 00:24:27,480
So, um, I dunno,

380
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:30,270
what are you looking for in a guy?
I mean,

381
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:33,240
I think the fact that you're
writing me and you're saying,

382
00:24:33,241 --> 00:24:36,300
I think the guy I'm dating as a pussy,
I mean that,

383
00:24:36,301 --> 00:24:41,301
that actually hurts me on some level
just because I insert myself into this

384
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:46,680
story and the person updating would be
calling me a pussy or it could it be the

385
00:24:46,681 --> 00:24:50,370
ex, I guess. I don't know. This isn't
about me. This is about you come up,

386
00:24:50,371 --> 00:24:53,970
you'll stop being selfish. Alright.
Um, I think you've totally,

387
00:24:53,971 --> 00:24:57,450
Ross lost respect for this guy. And if
you don't respect the person you're with,

388
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:01,860
eventually you're going to
blow somebody else. You know,

389
00:25:01,861 --> 00:25:03,930
if you don't break up with this guy,
that's what I'm predicting.

390
00:25:03,931 --> 00:25:04,980
If you don't break up with this guy,

391
00:25:04,981 --> 00:25:07,770
you just going to cheat
on him just to facilitate

392
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:11,730
getting out of the
relationship because uh,

393
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:12,663
yeah,

394
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:16,940
you know, to get to that ll cool j
moment, we can just be fucking honest.

395
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:20,460
But I don't think you'll like that was
something about you knowing that people

396
00:25:20,461 --> 00:25:24,180
don't change at your age and the fact that
you like, you know, this guy's a pussy,

397
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:25,680
he's not sticking up for me.

398
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:29,610
And the fact that he didn't stick up for
you and then you took charge and say,

399
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:32,190
well, I'm going to fucking
call somebody who will,

400
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:38,240
I mean, technically you should have fucked
your ex boyfriend that night and he,

401
00:25:38,241 --> 00:25:40,250
and he shouldn't have been mad.
He should have been like any,

402
00:25:40,251 --> 00:25:42,800
he probably wouldn't have been because
he's a pussy. I ain't no, I understand.

403
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:45,770
I mean, you know, when you needed
a big swinging Dick, I mean,

404
00:25:45,771 --> 00:25:48,800
God knows it wasn't me. So, uh, yeah.

405
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:54,560
Um, I think if you don't break up with
this guy, you're actually fighting nature.

406
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,410
All right?
And

407
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,770
you guys are wired to,
to,

408
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,800
I know you guys aren't wired to

409
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:12,210
have kids with pussies. You know
what I mean? You want a strong sun,

410
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,810
right? You don't know, you know what
that Pussy Dna and your kid, right?

411
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:18,000
All that's going to kill you.

412
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:22,800
Imagine that you have a kid with this
guy and you want this kid to be like a,

413
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:25,980
like your ex boyfriend and it comes down
and it's like this fucking little wormy

414
00:26:25,981 --> 00:26:29,770
worm guy. Ah, that'd be awful.

415
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:33,280
Walking down the aisle to marry
this guy with dead sheepish.

416
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,650
And usually these years,
you know what dad,

417
00:26:35,651 --> 00:26:39,760
you want this guy to be the man standing
down there and a white Tuxedo like

418
00:26:39,761 --> 00:26:43,830
fucking Roger Moore James
Bond. I think I, uh, look,

419
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:48,270
I don't know if this just
happened and you're really upset.

420
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:51,420
So, uh, you know, and like,

421
00:26:51,421 --> 00:26:54,390
and in three days you're not going to
care and you're going to go back to having

422
00:26:54,391 --> 00:26:56,970
a picnic with this guy
because for all I know,

423
00:26:56,971 --> 00:26:59,400
your ex who came coming back,

424
00:26:59,401 --> 00:27:01,380
maybe you broke up with him
because he cheated on you.

425
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:04,320
Maybe he was too much of a guy,
if you know what I mean.

426
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:10,020
So then you said, well,
all right, I'm going to,

427
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:14,130
maybe I'm this next time I'm dating a
nice guy. He's now, he dated a nice guy.

428
00:27:14,131 --> 00:27:16,260
The thing about is sometimes
you date a nice guy.

429
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:21,000
They can be so nice that they're
pussies. Alright, and look, I'm not,

430
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,010
I'm not sitting there acting like,
you know,

431
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:26,730
if I'm out with my girl in
some fucking 200 pounds,

432
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:31,760
300 pounds jacked fucking 25 year old
comes up and starts doing shit that I'm

433
00:27:32,821 --> 00:27:36,090
going to start swinging because I'm not,
I'm not,

434
00:27:36,091 --> 00:27:40,860
I'm not getting my fucking head
kicked in just for the fuck of it. No.

435
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:45,270
You know what I mean? I mean,
it's not like just, you know,

436
00:27:45,271 --> 00:27:47,190
straight across the board as a guy,

437
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,040
you have to fucking go and get
yet God damn head kicked in.

438
00:27:50,041 --> 00:27:54,600
But this was a fucking woman.
This was a lady. I mean he, Jesus,

439
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:58,050
it is a weird situation
in defense of him where,

440
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,440
how do you get the fucking iPhone back?

441
00:28:01,441 --> 00:28:04,290
You start wrestling with her and now
you're kind of fucking throwing a girl

442
00:28:04,291 --> 00:28:08,970
around so you're looking at that possible
assault charge cause God knows that's

443
00:28:08,971 --> 00:28:13,170
how the world worked. Works
right now, your honor.

444
00:28:13,171 --> 00:28:15,840
I was trying to steal a phone and he,

445
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:20,160
this guy is salted me and you're
gonna be sitting there going,

446
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:22,790
she was stealing a phone and they're
not gonna be able to get past your,

447
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,530
you're a guy and she's a girl.
But um,

448
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:29,820
yeah,
he should have just,

449
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:34,120
he should've just held there by the back
of her pants so she couldn't leave and

450
00:28:34,121 --> 00:28:37,390
just stayed out of reach of her swinging.

451
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:43,940
That's what you do. If you're in that
situation as a guy, he just reached out,

452
00:28:43,941 --> 00:28:47,930
you grabbed by the back of their pants
and you just start running in a circle

453
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,610
until cops get there. So they can't swing
at you. That running backwards. I mean,

454
00:28:52,611 --> 00:28:53,550
I don't know what you,
you get.

455
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:55,850
You got to fucking do something
and he didn't do anything.

456
00:28:55,851 --> 00:28:57,800
That's the big thing that if you told him,
honestly,

457
00:28:57,801 --> 00:29:01,010
if you told me that this was some giant
guy who could kick the shit out of him,

458
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:01,933
uh,

459
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:07,490
I wouldn't say that the guy's a pussy.
You know what I mean?

460
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:10,640
I mean, what is the point of
going in and getting a concussion?

461
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:13,100
Getting your tooth driven up
through your fucking nose.

462
00:29:13,101 --> 00:29:16,010
The guys still gonna leave
with your phone. You know,

463
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,890
let's set old Richard
Pryor. Bit Macho, man.

464
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:23,780
I'll take that knife and stick it up
your ass macho man. It's like, no,

465
00:29:23,781 --> 00:29:26,900
you're going to get the shit kicked out
of you. But this was a woman. All right.

466
00:29:26,901 --> 00:29:30,710
Pill for fuck sakes. Quit. You have
God damn rambling. Wrap it up. Um,

467
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:35,750
I think you know what you want
to do when you should do it. Um,

468
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:39,590
you are dating a pussy.
The fact that when he was sober,

469
00:29:39,591 --> 00:29:43,030
he said that he was scared
of her and a view. Uh,

470
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,900
he seems like he's a
little for limped and uh,

471
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:51,280
I just can't imagine
there's going to be a stereotype,

472
00:29:51,281 --> 00:29:55,540
but a guy like that actually putting it
on you in the bedroom. I really don't.

473
00:29:55,541 --> 00:29:59,350
He probably stares at you and the I, am
I hurting you? Is Everything okay? God,

474
00:29:59,351 --> 00:30:01,660
you're so beautiful. I
mean, come on. Alright.

475
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:05,770
Flip her over and wash your face and
the pillows. I'm always, she says in ps,

476
00:30:05,771 --> 00:30:08,030
don't worry.
Uh,

477
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:12,130
that con I used to call a
friend who pushed me and
took my phone is no longer in

478
00:30:12,131 --> 00:30:16,810
my life. She gets your phone back.
Well, what happened with you guys?

479
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:20,380
Now wait a minute.
What can I hear the followup here?

480
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:23,770
There's so many different ways that this
could be gone. Was that like a girl?

481
00:30:23,771 --> 00:30:28,771
Like when you thought that maybe you
were a swing in another way and all of a

482
00:30:29,531 --> 00:30:33,310
sudden you broke up with her
and, uh, uh, probably not.

483
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:37,360
It's just my own red shoe diary
kind of fucking thing. So anyways,

484
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,430
um, what are we 30 minutes in and
the Monday morning podcast? Um,

485
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:48,360
I gotta I gotta give a little shout
out here to our flappers comedy club in

486
00:30:48,701 --> 00:30:53,550
Burbank, California. This city
that Johnny Carson made famous. Um,

487
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:58,120
I had a fucking unbelievably
great time this weekend.

488
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,390
I did four shows out there Friday,
Saturday night.

489
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:06,100
It's the perfect size club.
They couldn't have been more friendly.

490
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:08,680
They'll all,
the shows were packed.

491
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:12,520
I was working out my new hour and um,

492
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:14,171
it was great.

493
00:31:14,171 --> 00:31:19,030
I was working with a Chelsea
Peretti Sacramento zone,

494
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,080
Chelsea Peretti.

495
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:24,850
She was Hella funny as they say up there.
Um,

496
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:26,920
yeah,
she was fucking great.

497
00:31:26,921 --> 00:31:31,210
She's sang some ridiculous line
about Michael Bolton backstage,

498
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,560
like just fucking around. And I said
to her, you got to do that on stage.

499
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:40,090
You got to do that on stage, right? So
most people go, oh, I can't do the youth.

500
00:31:40,091 --> 00:31:42,850
The youth came up with it
and the big keep looking do,

501
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:47,510
she went up and she did it and closed
with it and it was just one of those,

502
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:49,150
one of those weekends.
It just, I don't know,

503
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:52,810
you'd have to be a comedian to understand
how much that like gets you going to

504
00:31:52,811 --> 00:31:53,470
be like,
all right,

505
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:57,730
I'm going to go up and go try some shit
if she's just going to go fucking sink

506
00:31:57,731 --> 00:32:00,980
some fucked up in line about
Michael Bolton, what? I'm
going to go up there and,

507
00:32:00,981 --> 00:32:05,900
and pussy out of my jokes, my, the
new things that I want to try. So, um,

508
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,280
I was psyched.
I feel like I already got,

509
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:15,360
I have a solid 25 minutes towards
my new hour where I can actually,

510
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:18,783
you know,

511
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:23,110
run my mouth and not do anything on the
special that's coming up because that's

512
00:32:23,111 --> 00:32:26,830
basically the game you do.
You take the special the second it's done.

513
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:31,360
You then have from whenever
you finish taping too,

514
00:32:31,361 --> 00:32:36,361
when the new one comes out to somehow
come up with an hour of shit that you can

515
00:32:36,491 --> 00:32:40,040
say to a crowd and they won't
demand their money back. So I

516
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:44,690
have until October and I figure, I feel
like I'm already halfway there, you know,

517
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:49,710
this time next week I'm actually going
to go out with a buddy of mine. Uh,

518
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:54,500
you know, I never wrote a motorcycle. My
life is going to teach me how to do it.

519
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:55,920
I know what you guys are thinking.
Ah,

520
00:32:55,940 --> 00:33:00,020
motorcycle fucking just go by the
coffin with and I'm not a dirt bikes.

521
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:02,360
Just gonna ride it.
Fucking dirt bike.

522
00:33:02,361 --> 00:33:04,520
Just cause I want to learn how to fucking
ride one. Do you know what I mean?

523
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:09,950
Just for that, uh,
macgyver moment. This too.

524
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:11,870
There's a couple things I
want to learn how to do.

525
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:16,730
I want to fucking learn how to ride a
motorcycle and maybe fly a helicopter just

526
00:33:16,731 --> 00:33:18,500
so I have my,
you know,

527
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:22,790
just in case if I'm ever in some
Jason Bourne kind of situation.

528
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:27,723
Okay.

529
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:30,860
You ever think about that
shit was great about action.

530
00:33:30,861 --> 00:33:35,510
Fucking heroes is I don't give
a fuck what vehicle it is.

531
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:38,930
I don't care if it can fly.
If it's on the water,

532
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:43,280
if it's a fucking dump truck,
if it's a God damn tank,

533
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:47,720
it's just a fucking hovercraft.
Those sons of bitches,

534
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:52,880
not only did they have time to be
trained in every form of martial arts,

535
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,900
swords, weaponry, guns, anything.

536
00:33:56,901 --> 00:34:01,070
They know how all that works and they
can drive every fucking vehicle known to

537
00:34:01,071 --> 00:34:05,120
man. You know, you got to do
that. You got to, as a guy,

538
00:34:05,121 --> 00:34:08,330
you got to make your or a woman,
right as a girl.

539
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,470
Remember that when he used to spell it,

540
00:34:09,471 --> 00:34:12,450
G R R l because you guys
weren't taking no mas.

541
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:19,460
You got to make that fucking your,
your action hero list. You know,

542
00:34:19,461 --> 00:34:20,870
you're Jason Bourne list.

543
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:25,280
Have you ever seen an action movie where
the fucking guy jumps into some vehicle,

544
00:34:25,281 --> 00:34:28,640
a plane or anything? It's like I,
I just, uh, how does this work?

545
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:32,960
Does anybody know how to drive a
fucking helicopter, fly it or whatever?

546
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:36,440
I want to be able to do that shit.
You know

547
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,910
what's his face?
Tom Cruise.

548
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:46,530
Tom Cruise has a pilot's license.
He can ride a motorcycle.

549
00:34:46,531 --> 00:34:50,360
Remember top gun when he
was fucking riding with it
without his helmet on, right.

550
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:53,330
He can ride a,
you can drive a sports car.

551
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:57,010
I wanted at the helicopter though.
That's probably the wildcard.

552
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:59,630
Everybody's got that. It's like
a great pitcher. He's got his,

553
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:03,840
he's got his four pitches or whatever,
but not everybody has the cut fastball.

554
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:07,550
I think the helicopter is
the cut fastball for a,

555
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:12,530
maybe it's a knuckle ball for an
action hero, whatever, whatever.

556
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:15,650
I never learned how to ride a motorcycle
because my parents would not allow it.

557
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:21,980
They just wouldn't allow it. And uh,
you know, the fuck was I going to do,

558
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:25,730
I didn't have the money to buy one.
I wanted to get one,

559
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:29,870
which required them. I was like,
can you buy me this? Still like no.

560
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,860
And if we could afford it, we wouldn't.
And I was like, why not? They're like,

561
00:35:33,861 --> 00:35:36,860
cause you're gonna fucking die.
All right.

562
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:41,430
And this is knowing as you are, as a
child. We don't want that to happen.

563
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:44,190
So no, we're not. We're
not getting you that.

564
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:49,380
And then I remember I got old enough and
I was going to buy this motorcycle came

565
00:35:49,381 --> 00:35:53,490
out, it was called the Honda
rebel and it was only 1200 bucks.

566
00:35:53,491 --> 00:35:56,760
This was the 80s.
And I still remember the commercial,

567
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:01,590
you something like a look at my
watch. He was not 51. So I called up,

568
00:36:01,591 --> 00:36:06,591
my girls said let's have some fun and we
road riding on a rebel [inaudible] get

569
00:36:08,881 --> 00:36:12,810
this fucking bike, something
like that. Right. And um,

570
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,270
I was going to buy it and the girl
I was seeing at the time said,

571
00:36:18,271 --> 00:36:21,090
if you buy that, you might as
well buy the coffin to go with it.

572
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:24,413
And I don't know,

573
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:27,570
I talked to a couple other people
and people work in emergency rooms.

574
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:31,410
They call people who ride motorcycles.
They just call him organ donors.

575
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:35,940
And uh, and I was under
the impression of, yeah,

576
00:36:35,941 --> 00:36:38,610
but what if you got really good
at riding a bike? You know,

577
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,310
people suck it riding bikes.
Maybe if you've got really good at it.

578
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:46,350
And I basically, eventually, probably
somebody told me, it's like, listen,

579
00:36:46,351 --> 00:36:48,510
stupid.
It doesn't matter how good you are.

580
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:53,040
If somebody sucks it driving a car,
they're in a fucking car.

581
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:55,980
You're in a motorcycle.
That's it. You know,

582
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:00,630
there's no fender benders as they say
on those things. So I was just like,

583
00:37:00,631 --> 00:37:05,550
all right, you know what? That's
probably a good idea. Oh, fucking action.

584
00:37:05,551 --> 00:37:09,190
Heroes can also ride a horse.
It's just nothing. Can't,

585
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:10,140
there's nothing they can fit,

586
00:37:10,141 --> 00:37:14,880
can't fucking do and climb up the side
of a building. So what you gotta do,

587
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:18,360
you gotta get a chin up bar and then
you got to start knocking down all these

588
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:20,160
modes of transportation because that's,

589
00:37:20,161 --> 00:37:24,810
that's as big a part of fucking
Armageddon. As you know,

590
00:37:24,811 --> 00:37:27,570
growing your own food and
having your own water supply,

591
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:31,530
you have to be able to drive
every mode of transportation.

592
00:37:31,531 --> 00:37:36,090
I guaran fucking tee you. If you go
on Youtube, there's gonna be a video.

593
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:39,630
I've never looked this up,
but how to drive a tank,

594
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:44,640
I bet somewhere on the Internet and
if the, uh, somewhere on the Internet,

595
00:37:44,641 --> 00:37:49,200
I bet that there's a video that will
teach you how to do that shit. Um,

596
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:52,620
so anyways,
what the hell was I talking about?

597
00:37:52,621 --> 00:37:57,000
I just totally lost my God damn
train of thought. Um, oh yeah.

598
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:58,680
So I'm going to be a off to,

599
00:37:58,681 --> 00:38:01,860
I know what I'm talking about coming
up with this new hour of material.

600
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:07,460
So how I do it day sees how I do it is um,

601
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:11,610
I obviously I throw out all my other shit,
man.

602
00:38:11,611 --> 00:38:15,960
I only go back to the old
hour if I have to. Um,

603
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,730
and I just keep talking new shit.
I take all rules of hack.

604
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:24,360
I throw him out the
window. I will, I will.

605
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:27,480
And right down to a Michael Jackson
impression, if I could do it,

606
00:38:27,481 --> 00:38:29,400
I would do it on stage. I
wouldn't give a fuck. And I just,

607
00:38:29,401 --> 00:38:34,080
just to be saying something new
that'll just get me thinking that way.

608
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:36,040
And then in my personal life,

609
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:40,390
I go out and I try and do some shit that
I never did before because I know God

610
00:38:40,391 --> 00:38:43,780
damn well, I'm going to make an ass
of myself trying to ride that bike.

611
00:38:43,781 --> 00:38:47,290
I'll stall it out. I'll do a face
plant, I'll do something fucking stupid.

612
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:51,310
Um,
or whatever.

613
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,051
I don't know.

614
00:38:53,051 --> 00:38:56,080
Maybe even that fucking Shit I just said
there about the fucking action heroes

615
00:38:56,090 --> 00:39:00,550
so they can drive some, something will
come out of it. So that is my, uh,

616
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,970
that is what I'm going to
be working on coming up.

617
00:39:03,971 --> 00:39:07,570
And I got a bunch of actually
standup gigs he gets,

618
00:39:07,571 --> 00:39:09,760
starts to get crazy again in,
um,

619
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:15,730
in June I'm going to be at
the San Jose Improv. Uh,

620
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:19,540
Chelsea Peretti is on that one also.
I had to give her that one.

621
00:39:19,541 --> 00:39:23,710
It's so close to her hometown
in Sacramento. All her
peeps are gonna come down,

622
00:39:23,711 --> 00:39:28,270
be Hella excited. Um, that's
on June 15th and 16th.

623
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:31,120
And then I'm doing the aunt and,
and on the 17th,

624
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:36,010
I'm at the Chicago theater and
that's a Vince Vaughn show,

625
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,810
Vince Vaughn, wild west show. It's
going to be me. Obviously Vince Vaughn,

626
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:44,710
Steve Byrne, I gotta get you guys in that
lineup. That's going to be insane. And,

627
00:39:44,711 --> 00:39:46,300
uh,
the Chicago theaters to shit,

628
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:50,500
I actually got to work at
one time previously when I
was working with the Great

629
00:39:50,501 --> 00:39:55,030
Jimmy Norton on his tour, uh,
the antisocial tour, it was me,

630
00:39:55,031 --> 00:39:59,230
Norton a tell in brewer that
was such an unbelievable show.

631
00:39:59,231 --> 00:40:02,520
And the Bruins won the Stanley
Cup that night. So, um,

632
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:07,540
this is my triumphant return
to the Chicago Theater.
That's going to be Sunday,

633
00:40:07,541 --> 00:40:12,310
June 17th and all right,
so all you mustachioed, uh,

634
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:16,570
stereotypical Chicago people bring fucking
6,000 of your closest friends down to

635
00:40:16,571 --> 00:40:20,260
that Gig and Ontario Improv,

636
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:25,030
the inland empire, June
29th, 30th and July 1st.

637
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:30,730
And then the next Gig I got after that
is Hampton beach and in New Hampshire on

638
00:40:30,731 --> 00:40:35,530
July 14th in Newport, Rhode Island
of doing the Newport yachting center,

639
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:38,890
which sounds really, like I said, snooty,

640
00:40:38,891 --> 00:40:43,630
but it's a tent that they put up in the
parking lot in Newport, Rhode Island, uh,

641
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:47,820
July 15th. And that's actually
one of my favorite gigs. Um,

642
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:51,880
cause I get to go back and see all kinds
of friends and family and that's it.

643
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,630
And by then I'm guaranteeing
you by that July 15th,

644
00:40:55,930 --> 00:41:00,310
I'm going to have my 45 fucking
minutes down. That's my goal.

645
00:41:00,311 --> 00:41:04,750
By July 15th to have a new 45
minutes and then I can coast through,

646
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:11,140
you know, August and September. Get that
next 15 and then my special comes out.

647
00:41:11,141 --> 00:41:12,670
Right.
And hopefully everybody likes it.

648
00:41:12,671 --> 00:41:15,370
Then they come out to see me and
he's was like, oh fuck. We show him.

649
00:41:15,371 --> 00:41:17,080
He's got a whole new fucking hour.

650
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:21,700
And that is how you do it. Um, all right,

651
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:23,740
dilemma bill.

652
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:28,800
Would you rather lose your driver's
driver's license forever or spend the rest

653
00:41:29,261 --> 00:41:33,980
of your life as a Vegan?
Oh man,

654
00:41:33,981 --> 00:41:35,240
that is a great one.

655
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,460
And I obviously can't cheat on the Diet.

656
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,393
Ah,

657
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:50,250
what a hell of a dilemma
drive around is a grumpy,

658
00:41:50,251 --> 00:41:52,620
skinny Douche for the rest of my life.

659
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:59,930
No, no, no, no. Wait. Yeah. Wait, what'd
you write? I just got lost in that.

660
00:41:59,931 --> 00:42:03,800
Lose your driver's license forever or
spend the rest of you have license. Oh,

661
00:42:03,801 --> 00:42:08,030
I'd have to walk around
is a meat eating jackass.

662
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:14,490
Spend the rest of my life as a Vegan.
I F I'd have to be a Vegan.

663
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:19,660
I'd have to be a Vegan. What am I going
to pick? I just sit around eating Burgers,

664
00:42:19,661 --> 00:42:24,370
walking around the block,
asking people to drive me places.

665
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:29,210
I wonder if you could
get used to that though.

666
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:33,540
I lost my license for drinking
and driving a long time ago,

667
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:37,890
and that was back when you only lost
it for 45 days on a first offense.

668
00:42:37,891 --> 00:42:40,680
And they didn't count the first two weeks
while I was waiting to get arraigned.

669
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:46,480
Um,
so it was probably more like 45.

670
00:42:46,481 --> 00:42:49,720
I probably lost it for,
I don't think it was two weeks either.

671
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:53,130
I lost if like 50 something days.

672
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:57,390
And I remember towards the end of it,
I almost,

673
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:59,370
I forgot what it was like to drive

674
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:02,950
just after that amount of time.

675
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,830
You know what I, if I lost my driver's
license forever, I would just live.

676
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:13,310
I would live in New York City.
That's what I would do,

677
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:18,030
man. You know, I'd be like one of
those fucking people, you know,

678
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:21,780
when you live in New York, Jesus
Christ, New York City, man, I,

679
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:24,760
you know what the smartest thing I
ever did. I left New York City at 39.

680
00:43:24,761 --> 00:43:26,350
That was the smartest thing I ever did.

681
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:30,580
New York City is such a city
for young people, you know,

682
00:43:30,581 --> 00:43:34,660
I know I've said to ship before, but like
if you, this is thing, I really feel it,

683
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,260
you got to live there at some point
you life, it's fucking awesome.

684
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:42,970
You have to live there, but don't stay
there too long. You stay there too long.

685
00:43:42,971 --> 00:43:47,050
That's just something happens. You
become a gore of phobic. You know,

686
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:52,210
you have some unhealthy
relationship with a fucking animal.

687
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:55,810
And I'm not saying beastiality, but
like, you know, instead of having a kid,

688
00:43:55,811 --> 00:43:59,710
you have like a cat and all you do is
sit around bitching that there's no

689
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:03,370
fucking good restaurants in your
neighborhood and it just, it just,

690
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:07,450
you get all hunched over you, you start
looking like you have osteoporosis,

691
00:44:07,451 --> 00:44:11,390
even if you don't this, that, that
city is for young people. And, uh,

692
00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:14,380
go there and have a good time.
And then you got to get out.

693
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:17,830
Don't hang there too
long because you end up,

694
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:20,320
it's like Matthew mcconaughey
in dazed and confused.

695
00:44:20,321 --> 00:44:25,090
You just hanging around and uh,
it's, it's not a good thing. Um, oh,

696
00:44:25,091 --> 00:44:29,350
and speaking of which,
I bought the New Jersey Devils,

697
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:33,660
the New Jersey devils, the La Kings.
Who Do you like? Who Do you like?

698
00:44:33,661 --> 00:44:38,661
And the Rangers lose the Rangers lose my
condolences to all rangers fans and my

699
00:44:39,091 --> 00:44:43,800
condolences to the world's most famous
arena slash food court. Once again,

700
00:44:43,801 --> 00:44:48,480
another year goes by. No
NBA title, no Stanley Cup.

701
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:50,200
Yeah.

702
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:55,200
But for some reason it's the world's most
famous arena because of music cause of

703
00:44:56,031 --> 00:44:59,660
Frankie Sinatra because the led
Zepplin because of Muhammad Ali,

704
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:03,740
not because of the rangers or the next.
Okay.

705
00:45:03,741 --> 00:45:07,820
And I know that's a bitter pill for you,
New York sports fans to swallow.

706
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:11,390
And that's exactly why I'm handing
it to you on a nice fucking pillow.

707
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:15,470
Swallow it because it's all you.
Um,

708
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:20,740
Celtics by the way, are still in it going
for their 18th NBA world championship,

709
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:23,650
all championships.
One in the NBA,

710
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:29,700
in the National Basketball Association
as opposed to that other team out west

711
00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:33,790
that counts that be a title.

712
00:45:35,770 --> 00:45:39,580
We want an NBA title before
there was even an NPA.

713
00:45:40,870 --> 00:45:45,750
Um, anyways, by the way, I've
got to give the rangers props.

714
00:45:45,751 --> 00:45:49,440
Don't arrange your fans.
Everybody stole your let's go rangers.

715
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:52,350
Everybody stole that
from you guys in 1994.

716
00:45:52,351 --> 00:45:56,730
You guys were the only guys doing and it
became fucking iconic and now everybody

717
00:45:56,731 --> 00:46:01,380
does it. Okay. You know, let's go bro
ends. No one ever did that. It was,

718
00:46:01,381 --> 00:46:06,270
here we go, Bro. Edge. There we go,
Bob. Bob. That's what the fuck it was.

719
00:46:06,271 --> 00:46:10,510
Now I, people go, let's go.
Bro Wins and it bugs me. Um,

720
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:15,400
I actually looked up the history
of, uh, the beat La Chan and uh,

721
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:17,590
cause some jackass was trying to be like,
oh shit,

722
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:20,330
you fucking a DCF Francisco giants fan.

723
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:24,260
You should say that to the did back in
the [inaudible] go fuck yourself. No,

724
00:46:24,261 --> 00:46:26,110
they did all right.

725
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:29,960
According to my fucking Internet research,
uh,

726
00:46:30,110 --> 00:46:35,110
the history of the beat La Chant was
actually when the 70 sixers beat the

727
00:46:36,431 --> 00:46:41,431
Celtics in game seven in 1982 and they
were going and we hated the fucking

728
00:46:43,391 --> 00:46:46,480
Lakers. That's how much we
hated the Lakers to sell.

729
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:50,470
The 70 sixers beat us in
our own goddamn building.

730
00:46:50,890 --> 00:46:55,450
We knew it was over and the
fans chanted beat La. Actually,

731
00:46:55,451 --> 00:46:58,990
they chanted it to the 70 sixers.
All right?

732
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:03,280
That's how much we fucking hated La.
You know, we weren't going, fuck you.

733
00:47:03,281 --> 00:47:07,210
76 is Yada, Yada, Yada. All that bullshit.
We were just like, all right, you beat us.

734
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:11,080
You know, as much as we fucking
hate that, we hate the Lakers more.

735
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:14,650
And then the beat La chant was born.
All right.

736
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:18,250
And if that isn't a fucking phenomenal
story, I don't know what is.

737
00:47:18,251 --> 00:47:21,310
And I got to tell you something
I hated the 76 is back then.

738
00:47:21,311 --> 00:47:26,080
But when I look back and I remember
those teams, I fuck, I love him now.

739
00:47:27,850 --> 00:47:32,290
Maurice Cheeks, Andrew,
Bobby Jones, Dr Jay.

740
00:47:33,870 --> 00:47:38,610
Oh. And then when they brought in
Moses Malone, it was just phenomenal.

741
00:47:38,611 --> 00:47:40,260
And I love their uniforms back then.

742
00:47:40,261 --> 00:47:42,210
I don't know why they just
don't go back to those.

743
00:47:42,211 --> 00:47:45,840
I don't know why every fucking uniform
has to be so Goddamn discoed up.

744
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:52,150
I just don't get it. They were
just simple back then. I Dunno.

745
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:55,270
Although I gotta say I liked
the new Atlanta Hawks uniforms.

746
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:57,460
I like those better though.

747
00:47:57,461 --> 00:48:00,970
Then once they had back in the day
during Dominique's they were, uh,

748
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:06,550
they were definitely, uh, I dunno what
the fuck was going on with that. Um,

749
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:08,740
all right.
Please beat the dead horse bill.

750
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:11,800
You've received this email
a million times. All right.

751
00:48:11,801 --> 00:48:15,010
Can you please beat the
dead horse and make,

752
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:17,290
make it clear one more time.

753
00:48:19,290 --> 00:48:20,100
Okay.

754
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:24,600
That she should not be wasting
any more time with him anymore.

755
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:30,090
Sincerely pronouns.
What?

756
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:32,700
I don't even get that.
I know you're trashing me.

757
00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:36,090
Can you please beat the dead horse
and make it clear one more time?

758
00:48:36,091 --> 00:48:39,060
That she should not be wasting
any more time with him anymore.

759
00:48:39,090 --> 00:48:42,000
I didn't know what the fuck that is.
You got me.

760
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:44,940
You got me surf or Ma'am or whatever,
you beat me.

761
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:46,380
I don't even know what that means.

762
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:50,460
A weird signals from a sort
of a creepy friends. Hey Bill.

763
00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:54,750
Uh,
I'm a girl that has a lot of guy friends.

764
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:59,810
I'd say about 70% of my friends are
guys a half our gay half aren't,

765
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,750
you know what?
I can't fucking stand.

766
00:49:04,590 --> 00:49:09,590
I Hate Wa women who have gay
friends and they refer to them all.

767
00:49:09,691 --> 00:49:14,260
That's my gay, he's my gay. I fucking, ah,

768
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:15,930
those women are the fucking worst.

769
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:20,750
And then there's stupid gay friend
comes around Cock blocking Ya, you know,

770
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:25,260
with his Sassy fucking bullshit coming
in and out. That's when he just like,

771
00:49:25,261 --> 00:49:29,370
why aren't the two you go
fucking finger blast each other.

772
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:38,710
No, it's really, it's
really fucking annoying.

773
00:49:39,850 --> 00:49:43,640
It's really annoying. It's, and then
I always feel like the gay guy is gay,

774
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:48,410
ended up his act and he just
like acting extra gay, uh,

775
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:51,810
like sit-com gay, not like
real life gay. And it's,

776
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:55,540
the whole fucking thing is just
annoying. So anyways, she goes, uh,

777
00:49:55,900 --> 00:50:00,430
and lately I've been noticing a lot of
my male friends have started staring at

778
00:50:00,431 --> 00:50:01,264
me.

779
00:50:01,690 --> 00:50:05,170
It's a little weird because I've known
them for a while and no one ever looked

780
00:50:05,171 --> 00:50:07,270
at me twice,
but over the last two months,

781
00:50:07,271 --> 00:50:12,070
I keep catching them looking
particularly my friends, so-and-so.

782
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:15,280
All right, well what's going on
with you? Did you hit the gym?

783
00:50:15,281 --> 00:50:19,120
Were you late developing?
Are you dressing differently?

784
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:24,070
Um, uh, so and so is my age and sword

785
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:30,230
and sort of kind has a girlfriend,
but not really. Oh Jesus.

786
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:33,410
Are you that kind of girl?
Nia went off on back in the day.

787
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:39,290
Girl has all guy friends. Uh,
anyways, she just turned 15.

788
00:50:41,610 --> 00:50:44,190
Oh wait a minute. Now you wonder
age. I don't want to read this.

789
00:50:45,290 --> 00:50:45,680
Okay.

790
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:50,390
She just turned 15 and he's determined
to wait around for two years until she's

791
00:50:50,391 --> 00:50:55,391
legal in the eyes of the state we live
in to officially date and get what their

792
00:50:57,141 --> 00:51:01,490
sense all they've done is
kiss creepy, I think. Yes. Uh,

793
00:51:01,491 --> 00:51:03,320
I would say definitely yes.

794
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:05,060
Okay.

795
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:07,940
You sitting there floating around, just
going, let me tell you something, man.

796
00:51:09,410 --> 00:51:13,490
The second model law allows me to take
my dick out. I'm going to do with it.

797
00:51:14,090 --> 00:51:17,150
That's fucking creepy.
Anyways,

798
00:51:17,990 --> 00:51:21,080
now even though he's allegedly
in love with this child,

799
00:51:22,010 --> 00:51:24,920
he gets super flirty
with me when we hang up.

800
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:28,130
Even going so far as the cop feels,

801
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:32,390
make jokes about us hooking up
and give me long hugs. Yeah.

802
00:51:32,391 --> 00:51:37,010
Stay away from this guy.
This guy's a creep. She goes,

803
00:51:37,011 --> 00:51:40,760
I'm friends with this dude. But this whole
situation weirds me out as it should.

804
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:45,650
I'm not sure if he really wants to stay
with his girlfriend or try to get or try

805
00:51:45,651 --> 00:51:49,950
his hand at dating someone
age appropriate.

806
00:51:51,030 --> 00:51:51,490
Okay.

807
00:51:51,490 --> 00:51:55,590
But there's a fucking ton of mixed signals
going on here and any outside insight

808
00:51:55,591 --> 00:51:57,710
would be awesome. Thanks in advance. Um,

809
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:00,510
I think you got to go
with your gut on this one.

810
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:05,370
I think the reason why you're getting
creeped out is because this guy's creepy.

811
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:09,770
That's fucking creepy.
That's fucking creepy.

812
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:11,100
Okay.

813
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:15,950
All right. A 22 year old guy
with the 15 that's Chris Hansen.

814
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:21,270
Can you wait?
Can you kiss a girl who's 15 at 22?

815
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:25,620
What are you doing? You're in the prime
of your life. There's plenty of fucking,

816
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:26,483
uh,

817
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:27,970
yeah,

818
00:52:27,970 --> 00:52:31,760
you're 22 years old. That's
it. You're a fucking rock star.

819
00:52:31,761 --> 00:52:36,280
There's a zillion women that you could
get with. Yeah. This guy is a creep.

820
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:41,350
He's beyond a fucking creep. I remember
when I was 22 with an 18 year old girl,

821
00:52:41,351 --> 00:52:44,890
felt like a child at that point. It was
just weird like that. That's a huge jump.

822
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:47,560
This is still living at home.
You know,

823
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:51,700
you're of legal drinking age.
You go on a titty bars.

824
00:52:51,701 --> 00:52:54,040
You getting arrested for
fucking drinking and driving.

825
00:52:54,190 --> 00:52:58,410
You flunked out of college. I mean you're
eons away from where they were at 18.

826
00:52:58,411 --> 00:52:59,350
That's how I felt.

827
00:53:00,930 --> 00:53:01,360
Okay.

828
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:05,590
Um, I remember as a, as a senior in
college, like freshman seem like,

829
00:53:05,770 --> 00:53:09,850
like children. That's fucking weird.
Yeah. I would stay away from that guy.

830
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:11,390
And um,

831
00:53:12,410 --> 00:53:12,640
okay.

832
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:15,570
And as far as guys looking at you,
it sounds like you're a,

833
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:17,920
you have to turn it into a swan.
They acuity pie.

834
00:53:18,430 --> 00:53:21,520
So why don't you go get a guy
you deserve, stay away from, uh,

835
00:53:21,730 --> 00:53:25,990
the future sex offender. You
know, because you're just gonna

836
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:30,660
have to testify in his trial because
you're friends that he's actually a good

837
00:53:30,661 --> 00:53:35,370
guy rather than a bad guy
that is beyond fucked up.

838
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:39,870
A 22 year old guy making out with a
15 year old girl is beyond fucked up.

839
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:44,570
That's beyond fucked up. All right? Yeah.

840
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:47,430
Like to the point, I wish I
didn't even read it. They're like,

841
00:53:47,431 --> 00:53:51,990
ruins takes all the fucking comedy out
of this shit. All right, 53 minutes in.

842
00:53:51,991 --> 00:53:54,810
What do we gotta do here? Uh,
Hey Hubbard, some advertising.

843
00:53:54,811 --> 00:53:56,940
That's a nice set upon
little Chris Hansen story.

844
00:53:56,941 --> 00:54:00,480

things that are bigger waste of time,

875
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:56,460
it'd be great if you could bring
the titty bar into your apartment.

876
00:55:57,540 --> 00:56:01,470
Are you sick of going there and paying
those high ATM fees for a Woman Who's not

877
00:56:01,471 --> 00:56:02,101
going to bang you?

878
00:56:02,101 --> 00:56:04,860
Wouldn't it be nice if somebody came and
shook their teddies right in your own

879
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:09,030
department? It. tidies.com um,

880
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:15,020
I was telling you guys how if you go
to amazon.com through my website on the

881
00:56:16,021 --> 00:56:18,750
podcast page, you just click on it
and if you're going to buy something,

882
00:56:18,751 --> 00:56:20,520
you just buy it. That way you
don't have to do anything else.

883
00:56:20,521 --> 00:56:25,210
Once you get to amazon.com that they
kicked me back some money in 10% of the

884
00:56:25,211 --> 00:56:27,290
proceeds go to the wounded warriors.

885
00:56:27,310 --> 00:56:31,900
Well I got my first check
from amazon.com so I,

886
00:56:32,650 --> 00:56:34,090
I can't do it today
cause they don't do that.

887
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:37,720
They don't pick up the mail tomorrow.
I get to write a nice check, um,

888
00:56:38,110 --> 00:56:42,070
courtesy of you guys for taking the
time to go through bill.com go to the

889
00:56:42,071 --> 00:56:44,230
podcast page and clicking
on the Amazon banner.

890
00:56:44,650 --> 00:56:48,700
And I want to thank all you guys
for doing that because uh, you know,

891
00:56:48,730 --> 00:56:52,630
this is really perfect
memorial day weekend to be
bringing this up to we get to

892
00:56:52,631 --> 00:56:55,600
actually, uh, you know,

893
00:56:56,560 --> 00:57:01,560
help out the wounded warriors project
through a buy and flowbees on amazon.com.

894
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:06,490
So I actually use it.

895
00:57:07,270 --> 00:57:11,590
I'm rebuilding this cabaret data and
I'll just go on my own damn podcast,

896
00:57:11,591 --> 00:57:13,570
click on that,
you know,

897
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:18,380
rebuild in the Holly 41 60 dude and uh,

898
00:57:18,430 --> 00:57:22,600
I know that, that sounds impressive. It
definitely has that man great vibe to it,

899
00:57:22,601 --> 00:57:23,021
doesn't it?

900
00:57:23,021 --> 00:57:27,520
But I gotta tell you it's
not that difficult taking
it apart and then putting it

901
00:57:27,521 --> 00:57:30,070
back together. It really
isn't that difficult. Uh,

902
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,950
what is difficult though is a,

903
00:57:33,010 --> 00:57:35,130
I haven't got to the part where
you get to use a little measurer.

904
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:39,430
It makes sure the float is that the
right level and then adjusting the

905
00:57:39,431 --> 00:57:41,170
carburetors.
But I gotta be honest with you,

906
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:44,440
I don't think that that is going to get,
is going to be that hard either.

907
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:49,660
Once you've taken something apart,
you know what I mean? I don't,

908
00:57:49,661 --> 00:57:52,150
and then put it back together.
It's not as scary anymore,

909
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:55,570
which is why surgeons is so
God damn arrogant. You know,

910
00:57:55,630 --> 00:57:59,330
when they cut you open and move
around you frigging ovaries,

911
00:57:59,331 --> 00:58:03,100
easy your goddamn liver and then sew
you back up when you don't die. I mean,

912
00:58:03,101 --> 00:58:06,610
do you really think that they think
they're buying the next round? I think,

913
00:58:06,910 --> 00:58:11,080
you know, is arrogant, is professional
athletes are, I think that like,

914
00:58:11,081 --> 00:58:16,081
surgeons should be twice as
fucking arrogant really to
just split the d and dunk

915
00:58:17,171 --> 00:58:20,170
from the foul line.
I cut open a guy's skull,

916
00:58:20,710 --> 00:58:22,810
fucking played patty cake with his brain.

917
00:58:22,811 --> 00:58:26,080
Put it back together and he
can still talk. All right,

918
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:31,090
go fuck yourself, Colby. Um,
and then he steps on you.

919
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:34,450
All right, let's get back to the
podcast here. Where the hell is it?

920
00:58:34,451 --> 00:58:38,960
What's the rest of this stuff here? Uh,
oh my God. Here's one for you guys. Uh,

921
00:58:39,070 --> 00:58:42,610
my boyfriend wants to have his
foreskin restored. By the way,

922
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:46,330
how fresh and new are these,
uh, these emails here?

923
00:58:46,331 --> 00:58:49,870
Just because it's coming from the female
perspective. I love this shit. All right.

924
00:58:50,170 --> 00:58:52,100
Not Saying I don't want guys to email him,
but I,

925
00:58:52,101 --> 00:58:56,140
I would like to have a nice balance here.
I already say enough shit.

926
00:58:56,141 --> 00:59:01,140
Trash and women. So it helps if women
come in trash and guys, because, uh,

927
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:05,350
I, you know, it'll, it'll be a
nice balance here. All right.

928
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:08,890
My boyfriend wants to have his
for skin restored. Dear bill,

929
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:13,530
I wanted to get your take on the situation
I'm in with my current boyfriend. Uh,

930
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:16,000
I'm a girl. All right. A few weeks ago,

931
00:59:16,510 --> 00:59:21,510
my boyfriend of two years told me that
he's become totally upset that he and

932
00:59:21,921 --> 00:59:26,921
wants to restore his for skin via
taping and stretching methods.

933
00:59:29,210 --> 00:59:30,043
What,

934
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:36,530
and basically why he wants to do this
is because everybody, they say that, um,

935
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:41,420
intercourse you, you lose like, I don't
know, some percentage of sensitivity

936
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:45,500
when you have, you're
forced skin removed. And um,

937
00:59:46,330 --> 00:59:46,730
okay.

938
00:59:46,730 --> 00:59:51,440
All I can say is no guy can tell the
difference whether he has a four skin or

939
00:59:51,441 --> 00:59:52,274
whether he doesn't.

940
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:56,240
Because unless you got laid when
you were fucking six weeks old,

941
00:59:56,750 --> 00:59:58,790
you don't know what you're
gaining of what you're missing.

942
00:59:58,791 --> 01:00:03,710
So I don't understand why you would do
this. So t by restore his force can,

943
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:07,340
via taping and stretching
methods. She goes, I know, I know.

944
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:12,500
It makes me want to throw up just
thinking about it. I want him to tell him,

945
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:17,210
I think he's out of his mind. Uh, but
I don't want to hurt his feelings.

946
01:00:17,450 --> 01:00:18,171
The thing is,

947
01:00:18,171 --> 01:00:23,171
I'm totally grossed out by the idea
of for skin penises are gross enough

948
01:00:24,981 --> 01:00:29,360
already. There's no need to make
it even grosser. Uh, you know,

949
01:00:29,361 --> 01:00:31,940
what am I the only guy that
totally agrees with that?

950
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:34,700
Is there anything more fucking disgusting?

951
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:38,900
Then I'll fucking flacid
for skin covered Dick.

952
01:00:42,110 --> 01:00:43,490
I didn't know what it looks like.

953
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:49,250
It looks like I got a fucking,
I don't know what it looks like.

954
01:00:51,070 --> 01:00:51,830
Okay.

955
01:00:51,830 --> 01:00:56,480
I, it's just this fucking disgusting.
I don't even have like a reference.

956
01:00:58,430 --> 01:01:01,660
Looks like an Elephant Dick.
I get, I don't even know
what to say. It's just gross.

957
01:01:01,661 --> 01:01:06,130
It's fucking disgusting. Um, she goes,

958
01:01:06,131 --> 01:01:08,110
obviously I can't tell him how I feel.

959
01:01:08,830 --> 01:01:11,050
He's clearly having a
really hard time with this.

960
01:01:11,051 --> 01:01:15,970
He tells me that he feels violated
and disfigured. This guy's a pussy,

961
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:18,970
this throat, this throw this
guy into the fucking pussy, Ben,

962
01:01:18,971 --> 01:01:19,990
and get on with your life.

963
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:24,310
He also claims that for skins has a
lot of advantage for both partners,

964
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:29,640
but it's hard for me to totally buy that
considering the fact I have slept with

965
01:01:30,610 --> 01:01:34,630
a couple uncircumcised guy and I
didn't notice any extra pleasure.

966
01:01:34,930 --> 01:01:39,100
Although I did use a condom
with both guys. Yeah,

967
01:01:39,101 --> 01:01:43,090
he's full of Shit. He's full of Shit.
It may be more pleasure for him.

968
01:01:43,690 --> 01:01:44,890
I don't know what I mean.

969
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:47,800
I think it's amazing that women
will put a dick in their mouths.

970
01:01:48,310 --> 01:01:51,430
You know the at least you can do is
try and tidy up down there. You know?

971
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:53,950
How about having fucking empathy?

972
01:01:55,730 --> 01:02:00,160
I've asked you this, discuss. It's
just fucking extra skin. Yeah.

973
01:02:00,161 --> 01:02:04,540
Nothing more sexier than
extra skin. Yeah. Yeah.

974
01:02:04,541 --> 01:02:07,600
It's like your Dick used to be
obese and then lost a ton of weight,

975
01:02:07,601 --> 01:02:12,520
but didn't have enough money to have
that surgery. They get rid of the extra.

976
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:17,320
Ah, it's gross. There's
another two paragraphs,

977
01:02:17,321 --> 01:02:21,540
people just just preparing you for
another two paragraphs of having an

978
01:02:21,570 --> 01:02:26,310
uncircumcised stretch taped
dick in your head. Anyway,

979
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:30,690
I think it's absolutely disgusting and
totally weird that he wants to do this

980
01:02:30,691 --> 01:02:34,560
and I'm starting to get really turned off
by the idea of sleeping with him while

981
01:02:34,561 --> 01:02:36,320
he's stretching out his force.
Good.

982
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:41,460
He told me he's going to
tape it to an elastic strap,

983
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:44,760
which is going to tie around his leg.
I know.

984
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:47,460
What the fuck is he just coming
up with this shit on his own?

985
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:49,810
Yeah.

986
01:02:49,810 --> 01:02:52,540
I told him that he should see a
doctor before he starts to do this,

987
01:02:52,541 --> 01:02:53,374
but he doesn't want,

988
01:02:53,470 --> 01:02:57,400
but he doesn't think that doctors know
much about this sort of thing. Oh,

989
01:02:57,401 --> 01:03:01,810
so he's just going to take it in his
own hands. Congratulations sweetheart.

990
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:03,490
You're dating a fucking moron.

991
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:06,040
Yeah,

992
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:09,220
that, come on. This is
the father. You children.

993
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:10,690
Okay.

994
01:03:10,690 --> 01:03:15,390
Coming up with, you know,
taking an erector set to his
fucking Dick. It was this,

995
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:18,550
do I have to finish reading this?

996
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:20,230
Yeah.

997
01:03:20,230 --> 01:03:24,010
I'm thinking of breaking it off
with them really. Course you are.

998
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:26,050
I thought he was a normal guy,

999
01:03:26,051 --> 01:03:29,800
but I had no idea he had all this freaky
shit going on underneath the surface.

1000
01:03:30,130 --> 01:03:32,920
Anyways.
What do you think about all of this?

1001
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:35,230
You got to go ll cool j.

1002
01:03:38,130 --> 01:03:40,270
You just got to do any of that.

1003
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:46,980
You're stretching out your fucking
Dick. I know. I said I'd be true.

1004
01:03:47,010 --> 01:03:51,960
You're stretching out your fucking Dick.
So I'm leaving you go fuck yourself.

1005
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:56,610
It's over. Yeah. Fucking gross.

1006
01:03:57,450 --> 01:03:57,871
Anyway,

1007
01:03:57,871 --> 01:04:01,470
what do you think all this is my justified
dumping him away or would that make

1008
01:04:01,471 --> 01:04:05,820
me an insensitive comment? No, it
would make you as strong person.

1009
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:11,190
All right.
Go with your gut on this one.

1010
01:04:12,350 --> 01:04:12,700
Okay.

1011
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:17,320
This guy is trying to to
do the impossible, like,

1012
01:04:17,321 --> 01:04:20,680
uh, like he said, fucking
scientist in that Michael J.

1013
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:22,000
Fox movie back to the future.

1014
01:04:22,950 --> 01:04:23,480
Okay.

1015
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:25,730
He's basically,
you know,

1016
01:04:25,731 --> 01:04:29,960
doing the Delorean bullshit with his Dick
and he doesn't want to go see a doctor.

1017
01:04:29,961 --> 01:04:32,390
Any doctor would tell them,
you can't do that.

1018
01:04:33,370 --> 01:04:33,770
Yeah,

1019
01:04:33,770 --> 01:04:36,920
you'll be funny. That was if you dumped
this guy right, and it actually works.

1020
01:04:36,980 --> 01:04:40,930
And then he starts screaming
like Billy Mays on TV with his,

1021
01:04:40,931 --> 01:04:44,630
his Dick Stretcher and
he sells it for 1995.

1022
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:49,490
It makes a zillion dollar. I'm just
playing devil's advocate here. You know

1023
01:04:51,430 --> 01:04:54,490
there's a 99% chance you're
doing the right thing,

1024
01:04:54,491 --> 01:04:58,090
but there is a 1% chance you
could be walking away from a,

1025
01:04:58,310 --> 01:05:03,000
a potential millionaire.
Cause I gotta be honest with you if,

1026
01:05:03,020 --> 01:05:08,020
if that guy actually pulls this off,
no pun intended, he pulls this off.

1027
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:09,340
Okay.

1028
01:05:09,340 --> 01:05:12,880
And he's able to do it with some
household material and then he,

1029
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:16,860
you know, Pete, they already make
millions of dollars with those,

1030
01:05:16,861 --> 01:05:19,600
those pills that say they're
going to make your Dick Bigger,

1031
01:05:20,380 --> 01:05:23,290
which we all know it doesn't
work because of it fucking work.

1032
01:05:23,291 --> 01:05:26,770
That would be an international story.
And um,

1033
01:05:26,860 --> 01:05:30,190
and then it still wouldn't work because
then what would happen was everybody

1034
01:05:30,191 --> 01:05:31,540
would take big dick pills,

1035
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:35,440
even guys with big dicks because they
don't want everybody else catching up with

1036
01:05:35,441 --> 01:05:35,920
them.

1037
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:40,920
So then having a little dick would
then be like having a six inch dick as

1038
01:05:41,231 --> 01:05:43,180
opposed to a three inch,
four inch Dick. Right.

1039
01:05:44,870 --> 01:05:48,320
It's a math workout on that or get bumped
up. You've got to six, seven inch Dick.

1040
01:05:48,321 --> 01:05:51,590
You just, he just regular, no,
you don't actually, not regularly.

1041
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:52,550
You'd have a little Dick.

1042
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:54,490
Okay,

1043
01:05:54,490 --> 01:05:56,770
so if this guy actually
fucking is able to pull this,

1044
01:05:56,771 --> 01:05:58,180
that doesn't even make sense.

1045
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:04,070
He's going, he, if he
thought he was disfigured,

1046
01:06:04,071 --> 01:06:08,600
now wait till he tries to fucking do this.
I mean his dick is going to look like,

1047
01:06:08,601 --> 01:06:10,970
you know when those people put that shit,
their ear lobes,

1048
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:17,630
they put those fucking, um,
those circles circular things.

1049
01:06:17,631 --> 01:06:21,640
You could shoot a God damn fucking bow
and Arrow through somebody's ear low,

1050
01:06:21,641 --> 01:06:24,500
but not drawing any blood.
He's going to do that to his deck,

1051
01:06:25,220 --> 01:06:27,890
except he's not going to have that
thing in there and it's just going to be

1052
01:06:27,891 --> 01:06:31,700
hanging. Ah, right bill. We
got it. It's disgusting. All
right. Overrated. Underrated,

1053
01:06:32,490 --> 01:06:35,600
underrated.
A steakhouse dinner with your bullies.

1054
01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:39,410
There's nothing better than stuffing
your fat face with your friends devouring

1055
01:06:39,411 --> 01:06:40,970
menu. Philemon, yawn,

1056
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:44,630
prime rib and porterhouse and leaving
nothing on your plate at the end.

1057
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:49,160
Recently my two buddies and I went to
Morton steak house and we spent a 115

1058
01:06:49,161 --> 01:06:53,930
bucks despite having a hundred dollar gift
card. We each got our own stakes side,

1059
01:06:53,931 --> 01:06:57,320
shrimp cocktails to start and
drinks to keep us twisted.

1060
01:06:57,620 --> 01:07:01,880
We ate like royal royalty despite
being low level pieces of shit.

1061
01:07:03,110 --> 01:07:03,890
He cannot even,

1062
01:07:03,890 --> 01:07:08,150
we could not have been that
gluttonous with the ladies.

1063
01:07:08,930 --> 01:07:11,660
Why not?
No offense to any wives or girlfriends,

1064
01:07:11,661 --> 01:07:16,310
but nothing beats pigging out on quality
food and not giving a shit about how

1065
01:07:16,311 --> 01:07:17,780
you look in the process.

1066
01:07:18,350 --> 01:07:21,560
You and your girl just can't do
that sort of steakhouse thing,

1067
01:07:21,890 --> 01:07:26,630
but you can do it with your
boys. Abso-Fucking-Lutely
uh, you know what dude?

1068
01:07:26,690 --> 01:07:30,170
You sound like a chick. You're not
going to pick out in front of you girl.

1069
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:32,320
Yeah.

1070
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:33,153
You know what?

1071
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:38,590
Come see me in San Jose when
fucking Peretti opens up for me.

1072
01:07:38,591 --> 01:07:41,950
She actually talks about eating. A lot of
women don't want to fucking throw down.

1073
01:07:43,210 --> 01:07:43,940
Yeah.

1074
01:07:43,940 --> 01:07:46,840
All right. But I know what you mean.
I thought just to hang out with guys,

1075
01:07:46,870 --> 01:07:50,200
it just makes you feel like you're running
your own corporation when you have a

1076
01:07:50,201 --> 01:07:53,380
steak dinner with, with, with just
hanging out with the guys, right.

1077
01:07:53,470 --> 01:07:54,520
It's smoking a cigar.

1078
01:07:54,521 --> 01:07:57,700
I get drinking a scotch and everybody
feels like they're fucking, you know,

1079
01:07:58,420 --> 01:08:02,650
HD Buttercup, Shea, um,
overrated fake tits.

1080
01:08:03,130 --> 01:08:05,680
They're too stiff. The, uh,

1081
01:08:05,710 --> 01:08:08,230
they look silly to me and
uncomfortable for her.

1082
01:08:08,410 --> 01:08:11,770
I don't know why women keep doing
this. It isn't better. Thank you.

1083
01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:17,430
That's one of the truest things
ever. You, they're fucking,

1084
01:08:17,550 --> 01:08:19,270
they're horrific and they don't feel good.

1085
01:08:19,271 --> 01:08:22,570
And I think natural
titties look better always,

1086
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:27,850
regardless of the size. It's just,
it's just not that big a deal.

1087
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:30,520
It really is that you would do that,

1088
01:08:30,521 --> 01:08:34,390
that you would take a bag of chemicals
and have it inserted into your body.

1089
01:08:34,391 --> 01:08:39,130
It's just fucking insane. I think, uh,

1090
01:08:39,220 --> 01:08:43,980
it was a bad idea and I think
it's over fake titties. It's,

1091
01:08:43,981 --> 01:08:46,990
it's like bell bottoms. It's over.
All right. Let's just let it go.

1092
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:51,730
It was a bad idea. Uh,
underrated. The natural boob,

1093
01:08:51,940 --> 01:08:56,630
both Gigli and ECO friendly.
Absolutely. Um, all right.

1094
01:08:56,631 --> 01:08:58,370
That's the podcast for this week.

1095
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:02,930
I think I hit everything I had to talk
about except a, I guess, game fly.com.

1096
01:09:02,931 --> 01:09:06,720
I didn't bring that up. All
you video gamers out there,
you guys seen the new, uh,

1097
01:09:06,770 --> 01:09:11,480

1098

Why am I cursing?
Why don't you go to game fly.com?

1099
01:09:14,910 --> 01:09:15,743
Yeah.

1100
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:20,410
Huh? Why don't shift? Where the hell is
it? Where the hell it man? Grades. Stabs,

1101
01:09:20,630 --> 01:09:24,490
duck advertising
schedule. Here we go. Stay

days of playing a 8,000 video games.

1108
01:09:47,541 --> 01:09:50,390
If that's even possible. You can
be like, yeah, you know what?

1109
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:53,360
I don't want it go to health.
Why wouldn't you do that?

1110
01:09:54,460 --> 01:09:55,293
Huh?

1111
01:09:55,300 --> 01:09:58,990
You know why? Because you self
sabotage and you have to stop in.

1112
01:09:58,991 --> 01:10:02,620
It begins today with gamefly.com/
[inaudible] all right.

1113
01:10:02,830 --> 01:10:04,480
That's the podcast for this week.

1114
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:06,270
MMM.

1115
01:10:07,590 --> 01:10:11,310
Congratulations to everybody who's
team who won in the playoffs and a my

1116
01:10:11,311 --> 01:10:14,550
condolences even to the Rangers, man,
I just break you guys balls. Okay?

1117
01:10:15,930 --> 01:10:16,763
MMM.

1118
01:10:17,810 --> 01:10:22,560
That's it. That's the podcast. Let's
go. Celtics fucked the Miami heat a,

1119
01:10:22,770 --> 01:10:26,480
it's going to crush me to see the spurs
win the championship again this year

1120
01:10:26,481 --> 01:10:30,470
because I always felt Tim Dunkin
should have been a Celtic. He was,

1121
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:34,790
he's the perfect Celtic
fundamentally sound, not flashy.

1122
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:36,800
The Anti Showtime Lakers.

1123
01:10:36,950 --> 01:10:40,130
It's what made the Celtics
Lakers rivalry so great.

1124
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:43,820
They were both awesome teams who did it
two different ways and we were always

1125
01:10:43,821 --> 01:10:48,020
the, uh, we're going to bore you to
death and still score 108 points.

1126
01:10:48,021 --> 01:10:51,830
That's how we always were.
And uh, ah, I forget what,

1127
01:10:51,831 --> 01:10:54,110
there was some bullshit that
happened that year on the lottery.

1128
01:10:54,111 --> 01:10:56,990
We had like two lottery balls and
we still didn't fucking get them.

1129
01:10:57,860 --> 01:10:59,630
I don't know who the fuck we
want to aunt wound up with,

1130
01:10:59,631 --> 01:11:04,310
like Joe Barry Carroll or some bullshit.
So it kills me. And uh, you know what?

1131
01:11:04,311 --> 01:11:07,010
It's a, you know what I think
you think maybe San Antonio,

1132
01:11:07,011 --> 01:11:09,470
we'll finally get some fucking respect.
If they win it again,

1133
01:11:10,250 --> 01:11:14,400
would this be Tim Duncan's fourth
or fifth title? I can't remember.

1134
01:11:14,401 --> 01:11:15,630
He wanted 99.

1135
01:11:17,610 --> 01:11:19,710
Then they want to like oh
four then they want to like,

1136
01:11:19,770 --> 01:11:22,020
they want like every other year
for a couple of years. I have no,

1137
01:11:22,021 --> 01:11:24,930
I gotta look that up.
I got no idea and I should know that ship.

1138
01:11:25,170 --> 01:11:29,700
He was want at least three Oh bill, shut
the fuck up. All right. Go Fuck Yourself.

1139
01:11:29,701 --> 01:11:30,720
So I'll talk to you next week.
