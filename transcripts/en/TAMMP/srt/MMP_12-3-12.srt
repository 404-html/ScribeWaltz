1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:02,820
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02,821 --> 00:00:06,360
It's bill burr and it's the
Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:06,361 --> 00:00:10,860
December 3rd, 2012 and uh, how are you,

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,980
this is going to be a as promised last
week and promised all over Twitter that I

5
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:18,630
would have a special guest this week.

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,080
Stand up and Rosebowl legend,

7
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,150
the one and only the guy whose name I
would never mention on the podcast after

8
00:00:27,151 --> 00:00:29,430
our first experience at the Rose Bowl.
And here he is,

9
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:33,270
the statue of limitations had run out.
Ladies and gentleman, Mr. Joe Barton.

10
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:38,240
Oh Man. Thanks bill.
Now in that coffin. Uh,

11
00:00:38,241 --> 00:00:42,220
well I know as soon as coughed into
the, this is a, this is fun. Finally.

12
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:47,060
Absolutely. After all the rose
bowls and a dude, the rose bowls.

13
00:00:47,061 --> 00:00:50,900
I mean you've given me probably the
two greatest thrills of my adult life.

14
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:55,930
One obviously setting me up in my first
six seconds on the ice with a goal or

15
00:00:56,481 --> 00:00:58,720
setting up your periods
and then then the rolling

16
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,200
when we,

17
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,980
when we were playing pickup hoc pick up
hockey and you gliding around there like

18
00:01:02,981 --> 00:01:05,200
the great white shark.
I got shout in front.

19
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,170
I mean to step on the ice,
tap my stick.

20
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:13,730
Rocky would tool hits me in the slot.
I go top shelf.

21
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:16,610
I should have just quit.
Then w why I ended up,

22
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:20,090
why I spent 500 bucks on the
equipment and only played once.

23
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:24,650
Well I played like 10 times with like no
pads, eat bag, finally gave me a helmet.

24
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:27,680
Then I bought all the stuff. I played
once after that, but it was good,

25
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,390
scary.
Joe Joe's like me,

26
00:01:29,391 --> 00:01:33,020
he's one of those guys who's
watched hockey for a good
35 years but never played.

27
00:01:33,021 --> 00:01:34,410
We just didn't come from hockey families.

28
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:38,300
We both figured we'd take up the game
in our forties and we both looked like

29
00:01:38,301 --> 00:01:40,050
make a wish kids and
when we were out there,

30
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:42,380
the look on your face when you scored,

31
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:46,700
you scored the goal and you just put your
arms up and you just left them up and

32
00:01:46,701 --> 00:01:49,790
you said you had this big grin on
your face and I saw it in your eyes.

33
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:52,430
You're like, this is
what it feels like. This,

34
00:01:52,431 --> 00:01:55,190
you would have thought you scored
one at the NHL Level as opposed to

35
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:59,420
I felt like his NHL level cause I'll tell
you I was scary when I first got there.

36
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:02,720
I mean you guys know Ian bag, he's
like six [inaudible] five. He's big.

37
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,210
He's on skates unlike

38
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:07,490
from Canada and that he, he can fuck it.
Like I heard he's skated with the conduct

39
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,430
did he played junior hockey.

40
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:14,530
So I'm walking into the rink with just
literally like my street hockey stick and

41
00:02:14,531 --> 00:02:19,020
those, then the rented scapes am I read
it and I walked in and I see him skating

42
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:22,900
around. I didn't even recognize him.
I'm like Holy Shit, what did I get into?

43
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,870
And then the step and to do that
and I scored another one real quick.

44
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:28,900
So I'm like I'm looking for the,
I'm looking for the natural hat trick,

45
00:02:28,901 --> 00:02:32,140
your hat trick and 10 seconds
and after that then bag,

46
00:02:32,141 --> 00:02:35,800
cause there's no hint league unless
you can't stop. Right? Like me.

47
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,593
Uh,

48
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,110
so the bags like you're not going to get
the hat trick and then cause I love bag

49
00:02:41,111 --> 00:02:41,944
and he loves me.

50
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:44,800
He just started cross checking me
in the crease and then that was,

51
00:02:44,801 --> 00:02:48,820
I never got the other thing I touched
another park. But uh, like I said that

52
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:52,970
back when that, that pickup game is still
fun. But that was, that was hilarious.

53
00:02:52,971 --> 00:02:54,210
It like the bad news bears,

54
00:02:54,211 --> 00:02:56,580
it was like everybody out
there was a different level.

55
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:00,760
So you could tell like how good somebody
was by much equipment they had and how

56
00:03:00,761 --> 00:03:03,280
new or how old it was.
You went out there,

57
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:07,270
you had that fucking Pittsburgh
penguins with no shield mass.

58
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:08,021
That's all I remember.

59
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:11,530
And you kept playing do and
you are getting scary cause
you're like fucking Cam

60
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:12,340
Neely size.

61
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:15,310
So that's what everybody was kind of
saying was like if that fucking guy ever

62
00:03:15,311 --> 00:03:19,300
learns how to skate and doesn't
learn how to stop, like he can't,

63
00:03:19,301 --> 00:03:20,770
if someone's going to get fucking killed,

64
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,630
well that's why I quit
playing roller hockey.

65
00:03:22,631 --> 00:03:26,260
I played roller hockey in San Francisco
for a season and like 10 like eighth

66
00:03:26,261 --> 00:03:29,620
game in.
I couldn't stop on roller skates either.

67
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:34,860
And I just absolutely buried
some kid about your size,

68
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,790
but not really athletic like
you not to make it nice.
Yeah, my son. No, no, no, no.

69
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:43,030
Like you're, you're like, you know,
you've been climbing your rope and stuff.

70
00:03:43,031 --> 00:03:43,661
I mean, you're, you're,

71
00:03:43,661 --> 00:03:48,661
you're not like this was a little kid
trying to be actor in shape and I just be,

72
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:53,200
I buried him like when Kevin Stevens had
to buy a new face after the islanders,

73
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:56,230
that's how hard I buried him and I'm like,
you know what,

74
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:59,710
I'm not here to hurt people purposely.
I mean, it's, it's time to give that,

75
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,320
but you got a good heart. I do
have, I do have a good heart.

76
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:05,620
Really. You get one of those guys, if
you played in the Nhl, you'd be that guy.

77
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:08,310
You would fucking knock the dude
down and the dude's land in the ice.

78
00:04:08,311 --> 00:04:10,180
You'd cochlear arm back and
then you'd be like, no, no.

79
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,480
So now he's had enough and it, I don't
think that would have a good dance though.

80
00:04:13,481 --> 00:04:15,790
After I won the fight,
I do a nice Hogan.

81
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:20,380
I'm sure it had one of those where I
would have been in the stands once.

82
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,940
Well I hope everyone has a good,
like either junior ae or in Europe.

83
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:30,270
Some every good goon has
been in the stands was like
someone would say something

84
00:04:31,331 --> 00:04:35,680
about Mulkin in like, you know, some,
some mafia heroin, den in the, you know,

85
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:40,320
uh, Mag Nita Gorse and that'd be up
there swinging away protecting his mom.

86
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,400
No, I like that. You know, did you want
to have to have you watched a fuck was,

87
00:04:44,401 --> 00:04:47,100
I just think it might, I have like
add, you've just brought up something.

88
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,570
Oh I know. For Fans, you know,

89
00:04:48,571 --> 00:04:51,500
cause you know hockey's like
the rogue sport for fans, uh,

90
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:53,930
who don't know what Joe's
talking about. Well, I'm gonna,

91
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,170
I'm gonna have a link up to that,

92
00:04:55,171 --> 00:04:59,940
that classic one where the Bruins went
up into the stands at the Madison Square

93
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,940
Garden and Mike Milbury, who now does
like commentating wearing a suit.

94
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:07,500
You actually watch him. He takes this
guys loafer off loafers. We're big in the,

95
00:05:07,501 --> 00:05:08,041
uh,
the 70,

96
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,260
speaking of which you actually still
have them cause you're old school.

97
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,170
He took them off. He never hit
the guy, he cocked it back.

98
00:05:13,171 --> 00:05:16,040
He was gonna hit him with the heel
of it and it was uh, it's, it's,

99
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:18,840
it's just something that
can't be described. So you
have to, you got to see it.

100
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:19,291
These,

101
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:23,220
these loafers are my guilty pleasure and
everybody remarks on them now because

102
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,210
I've passed into the age where now I
wear loafers and don't give a fuck.

103
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,360
Like I went to Ross to buy some,
I was by,

104
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:34,800
by the time she was at Ross because why
not buy Air Jordans that were 140 for 29

105
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:36,890
bucks?
Like I don't need to know

106
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:40,480
like giant guys. Like you go to those
kinds of places like when I go to like,

107
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:43,490
like Ross, uh, for
people on the east coast,

108
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,140
was it Ross dress for less shit for less,
whatever the fuck they call it.

109
00:05:47,141 --> 00:05:51,580
You walk in that they actually have Shaq
size shoes in there for that six foot

110
00:05:51,581 --> 00:05:52,780
eight guy who couldn't dunk.

111
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:57,090
Yeah. And like neon green and
purple, they're all that crazy shit.

112
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,280
It's always like that fucking shit
you get when your house gets flooded.

113
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,610
Those fucking giant sneakers that are like
neon green. Yeah. Apps a Fuckin lutely.

114
00:06:06,611 --> 00:06:09,680
So dude, I gotta tell you,
speaking of the fucking Rosebowl,

115
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:14,140
the granddaddy of them all like got a, I
went out and I got the tickets, you know,

116
00:06:14,141 --> 00:06:15,490
every year that's my job.
I go out,

117
00:06:15,491 --> 00:06:19,870
I get the tickets and then I rent the
fucking four door fucking dodge ram pickup

118
00:06:19,871 --> 00:06:21,840
to drive over there doing.
I'm actually, uh, I,

119
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:24,850
I've just completely checked out of
Christmas shopping and all the other shit.

120
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:26,080
All I'm doing is thinking about that.

121
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,600
What do you think about fucking
with Wisconsin's in it again?

122
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:32,290
Uh, yeah. You know, we could've,
we could've been ugly game.

123
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,260
That's going to be ugly
in the parking lot. No,

124
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:39,070
I mean there's some Nice Wisconsin people.
I wish I in Nebraska, I liked them.

125
00:06:39,071 --> 00:06:41,730
Corn husker girls you've ever
played in Nebraska, Nebraska.

126
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,310
La had said like,
he,

127
00:06:43,311 --> 00:06:45,950
he was rooting for Nebraska yesterday
because he said so we can look at

128
00:06:45,951 --> 00:06:46,790
different fat chicks.

129
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:51,250
Yeah, the brass because they're a
little bit, they're like younger,

130
00:06:51,251 --> 00:06:53,110
little healthier,
like did their kind of like this,

131
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,720
like the playboy centerfold kind of
chicks. The present Cornell's for girls.

132
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:02,430
Uh, when they get them, they get them
from that sort of the uh, Oklahoma,

133
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:03,180
Nebraska.

134
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:07,720
Right. The bigger loss though was UCLA
because Stanford has nicely can girls,

135
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:11,200
but they're really smart. Then that
the type of girls that like, Hey,

136
00:07:11,201 --> 00:07:13,540
let's get her,
let's take her tops off at 8:00 AM

137
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,740
that girl last year with
the, the fucking, uh, oh,

138
00:07:19,741 --> 00:07:23,320
is it tequila with the pickle
juice? Dirty Mexican. Oh my God.

139
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:27,340
Is that what they call that drink? They
did, yes. They did the dirty Sanchez.

140
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,610
I actually walked around
with Picardy dirty Mexican.

141
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:35,800
The leaf blower. It's what they call
that a leaf blower. There you go. Oh,

142
00:07:35,801 --> 00:07:36,634
we actually walked,

143
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,700
I actually went to like five different
people's houses with Tequila and pickle

144
00:07:39,701 --> 00:07:43,450
juice. Try and explain to them
and everybody thought I was like,

145
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:48,310
you've lost your mind. Bardic I'm like,
yeah. I mean obviously I did 30 years ago.

146
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,140
Right, but here's the great
pickle juice. It's cost effected.

147
00:07:52,141 --> 00:07:55,550
Everybody for saving money over the
holidays because you can get the most rot,

148
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:58,750
Gut Tequila in the world.
It tastes good.

149
00:07:58,751 --> 00:08:00,460
If you chug pickle juice with afterwards,

150
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,470
you chase it because I hate,
I hate to kill the dude that's always,

151
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,960
not like I ever drank antifreeze,
but if I ever did,

152
00:08:05,961 --> 00:08:09,320
I always feel it tastes like some
sort of cleaner. It's really fucking,

153
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:13,130
and it's the amount of people too who
really like, uh, just slam that shit.

154
00:08:13,131 --> 00:08:14,930
I had somebody a long time ago,

155
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,850
one of one of work for one of my managers
that I had back in the day and he,

156
00:08:18,851 --> 00:08:22,460
he fucking drank Tequila and he drank.
He drank that shit like, you know,

157
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:26,870
like we drink crown royal. Like it was
nothing. Now I'd like to this day, dude,

158
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:30,800
as much as we'll fucking booze bag as
I am, if you give me a shot of Tequila,

159
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:34,790
I will make a face like I'm
in seventh grade. I just
can't get that shit down. Oh,

160
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:36,890
remember that coalesced she,
she had the fucking overalls.

161
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,740
Yeah, I remember bad ass in the
fucking half shirt and underwear.

162
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:42,390
I remember all of it. He was
good. Yeah, I remember that.

163
00:08:42,391 --> 00:08:46,410
That was before it got a little blurry
or that I in the chronological history of

164
00:08:46,411 --> 00:08:50,180
the Rose Bowl Rao. Uh, first
one ever. The epic, the,

165
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:52,020
the granddaddy of them all the one,

166
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:55,870
it's like every great empire
starts with a big crime. Yes.

167
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:00,780
That was a crime against you
made that was this the greatest?

168
00:09:00,781 --> 00:09:04,160
That was probably my funniest time
as an adult ever. That there's,

169
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,740
why was that? Cause I feel like
we get just as drunk every year,

170
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:12,960
but that there was just something about,
I think because it was all new. Yeah. No,

171
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:16,570
but everything worked out. We walked
in that completely fuck hammered.

172
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,080
I remember I bought that, that
50 year old guy. A program.

173
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:22,690
Cause he thought it was too
expensive and I was like,

174
00:09:22,691 --> 00:09:25,210
let me get to you like technical.
Do you know what you're looking at?

175
00:09:25,211 --> 00:09:27,290
You're looking at a big shot.
You're not going to see a lot of,

176
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,840
I suppose chocolate,
like a fucking idiot.

177
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:33,400
And we smoke in those Cubans and we
what we got in and somehow you still had

178
00:09:33,401 --> 00:09:36,360
your Cuban cigar. I could, you
have your ticket around you.

179
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:41,150
You bought the, uh, the super duper
ticket holder and they do, I'm a nerd.

180
00:09:41,151 --> 00:09:45,020
I tried to say it was so many people's
squishing in that they weren't even

181
00:09:45,021 --> 00:09:47,540
looking at me that I was
still smoking a Cuban cigar.

182
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:51,200
There's something about eating a steak,
drinking a bottle of crown,

183
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:56,150
smoking a Cuban cigar that makes
you feel empowered to do anything.

184
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,580
People listen to this thinking that you
mean he means splitting a bottle every

185
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:05,870
year. Joe shows up with two bottles
of crown, one for us and one for him.

186
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:06,920
And Dude,

187
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,140
I heard Jimmy page and all that picture
that he takes where he puts the,

188
00:10:10,141 --> 00:10:12,890
the Jack Daniels back like that.
I already just stuck his tongue in the,

189
00:10:12,891 --> 00:10:17,170
in the holder. Just, it was
just like a photo op thing.
You actually down the hall.

190
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,440
Oh, that's considered a fifth.
That's terrible. Yeah, it's, well,

191
00:10:20,441 --> 00:10:22,720
it's the regular size crown,
but that's terrible than though.

192
00:10:22,721 --> 00:10:23,680
I didn't want to know that.

193
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:27,100
Well, he made it up with the
fucking, uh, the heroin abuse. Oh,

194
00:10:27,101 --> 00:10:31,450
I'm just repeating something from somebody
in a bar who allegedly met fucking,

195
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,710
well,
let me tell you something Mr and a bar,

196
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,780
if you're going to talk
shit about Jimmy page,

197
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:38,750
I just make sure it's true because that's,

198
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:42,350
that's not a rumor that she'd be like,
you know Jimmy page,

199
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,340
he's not really drinking.
That's like Jay Jimmy Page's jacked.

200
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,740
His is really ice tea. It's like when
you find out when Dean Martin like,

201
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:52,610
like no dean was drunk most of the
time just when he was already gone.

202
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:55,280
Like the producer,
like let's put a little less water,

203
00:10:55,281 --> 00:10:58,850
this one down because now people
want to revision is history like,

204
00:10:58,851 --> 00:11:02,630
Oh dean was drinking ice tea like yet
in the hookers were fake like gimme a

205
00:11:02,631 --> 00:11:04,460
break.
Like these guys were partying

206
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:07,630
their asses off and they could,
they had a good buzz going, look,

207
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:08,590
you got to know me.

208
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:12,700
Most of my shit is just stuff that I just
repeat shit that somebody tells me and

209
00:11:12,701 --> 00:11:13,870
then that's it. That's
it. I don't, I don't.

210
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,130
No, but we do drink a lot, but I haven't,

211
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:22,210
well I had though liar is the cook lie
ads looking at a barbecue brisket or

212
00:11:22,881 --> 00:11:23,250
something.

213
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:26,490
Dave gave a game too.
I'd say the other thing too,

214
00:11:26,491 --> 00:11:30,270
just the planes coming over when you're,
when you are bombed,

215
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:32,370
there is nothing better than to uh,

216
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,870
to like f 16 flying right over your
head that you're not expecting.

217
00:11:36,871 --> 00:11:39,070
I mean that was just like,
yeah,

218
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,760
those are like two like
historic teams too.

219
00:11:42,761 --> 00:11:45,580
It's like we went to first
year and it was USC versus

220
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:50,790
Penn State and Penn state gained six
total yards in that game and I celebrated

221
00:11:51,731 --> 00:11:53,580
it.
Like they won 40 nothing.

222
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,680
Well that's cause you yelled
at that fucking contract
was sitting in front of Oh,

223
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:58,010
she got mad at you with the cigar.

224
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:02,820
Yeah. Yeah. The funny thing was was I mean
I, my sister went to Penn state, my sats,

225
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:04,200
I could've taken him six times,

226
00:12:04,201 --> 00:12:06,810
I wouldn't get an independent state
if you added them all together. But

227
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:11,910
like a three 90 or a four oh four oh
seven combined and I took a prep course

228
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,570
but we were like, actually the day
I was going to take the sats, I uh,

229
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:19,290
the night before my, a
friend of mine is like, Hey,

230
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:20,950
come help me collect some money.

231
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:25,060
So I didn't get a good night's sleep
before I took my test. Oh, that's right.

232
00:12:25,061 --> 00:12:27,640
Back in the day when you were in
Pittsburgh back in the day. Yeah.

233
00:12:27,641 --> 00:12:30,070
We want tell them those stories.
But that's, that was my essay.

234
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,780
That's what I didn't do
too good on the sats.

235
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:34,110
You don't, yeah. Is it those
that, that stuff about uh,

236
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:37,130
collected money back in the day
when you are, you are the, uh,

237
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:40,710
the fucking dude they brought
around the enforcer that you,

238
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,170
you don't get into that stuff ever,
Huh?

239
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:45,210
No, it was just fun. It's just, it's
just, it was just for beer money.

240
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,613
Let's talk about that.

241
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:52,790
That's why that guy,
that one year,

242
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:56,720
the first year the wife were that
lady after she gave you shit,

243
00:12:56,721 --> 00:13:00,110
she said something about your nose and
then you said you need to lose about 20

244
00:13:00,111 --> 00:13:01,880
pounds before you talk to me,
bitch.

245
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:06,560
And then she turned to her husband and
he turned around and took one look at you

246
00:13:06,561 --> 00:13:08,270
and then started John at me.
You know,

247
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:13,490
I send me, like I said, like 40
though. She was a big ugly woman.

248
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:18,230
The thing was, I'm a nice guy, bill
and I, if you just went and said, hey,

249
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:22,720
can you please put that cigar
out? I always said, oh my
God. Oh my God. I actually,

250
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:25,580
I snuck this in. I'm, I'm
sorry I didn't sneak it in.

251
00:13:25,581 --> 00:13:30,120
I just forgot it was smoking it. I'm like,
uh, uh, sorry. I'll put it out. You had it

252
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:33,690
chomped in your mouth,
like you were a general surveying,

253
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:37,010
conquered land. It was like
I was, it's like I was,

254
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:41,980
it's like I was a a boxing efficient
auto from the 1920s yeah, it was awesome.

255
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:42,883
She said

256
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:47,720
she came out of the gate
and then I was just like,

257
00:13:47,721 --> 00:13:51,130
well that's uncalled for
and that's what I said,

258
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:53,450
you need to lose about
40 pounds to talk to me.

259
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,310
And then I thought we
were getting kicked out.

260
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:58,050
But in defense of her though,
like we were,

261
00:13:58,051 --> 00:14:02,190
so you realize how fucking
ridiculous it was. Well first of all,

262
00:14:02,191 --> 00:14:06,690
I fell on that fucking old lady
sort of fell into her. Yes.

263
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,960
And nobody helped me up. I had to push
off her and I felt folded her and half.

264
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:13,440
And then you got to the seat and
then you had the fucking cigar too.

265
00:14:13,441 --> 00:14:15,800
So already we, we were kind of
a spectacle will be, we have,

266
00:14:15,801 --> 00:14:16,750
we have to have a little bit of empty

267
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:20,030
to paint the picture of
where we were at though too.

268
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:23,930
If you ever wish to a college football
game, you see the stands and it's like,

269
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:28,580
oh my God, there's 100,000 people
wearing red or orange or green.

270
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:34,090
There was literally 50,000 people wearing
USC colors and just a speck of me and

271
00:14:35,151 --> 00:14:38,800
bill just wearing like neutral.
Nothing yet. But they knew we were

272
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:41,340
Penn state immediate. Once that lady's
started yelling at me, I was just,

273
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,620
I mean I'm not a USC fan anyways,
so I uh,

274
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:44,190
but I,

275
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:49,190
I did like to use because the girls were
so hot and then we met a guy that was

276
00:14:50,531 --> 00:14:53,000
such a fan.
He literally had the uh,

277
00:14:53,001 --> 00:14:56,840
the Trojan outfit and let us put on
the Trojan helmet and at the helm.

278
00:14:56,841 --> 00:14:59,990
That's the beauty of the rose boy. I
think that makes it so much fun as, hey,

279
00:14:59,991 --> 00:15:04,991
it's 80 degrees outside everywhere else
the weather sucks and the teams are so

280
00:15:05,421 --> 00:15:09,380
happy to be there. There's nothing
really on the line. Know what I mean?

281
00:15:09,381 --> 00:15:11,180
Other than you know,
your own bedding purposes.

282
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:15,050
So everyone's just happy to be
partying is not like in your, in your,

283
00:15:15,051 --> 00:15:18,280
in Pittsburgh and I mean like some of
the best tailgates or green bay or any

284
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:19,370
other city where rules,

285
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:24,260
there's tension in the
air and it's 20 degrees.

286
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,690
It's sunny. Everyone's happy to be there
throwing the ball around. It's just,

287
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:30,730
it's the way it should.

288
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,130
No, you told me something the other
day. I thought it was, cause you know,

289
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:36,750
you know I'm a big like maniac as far as
going around to different stadiums and

290
00:15:36,751 --> 00:15:37,141
all that.

291
00:15:37,141 --> 00:15:40,260
Like I love all of them and I got a
chance to go to three rivers before they

292
00:15:40,261 --> 00:15:42,090
knocked it down.
I saw and didn't see a Steelers.

293
00:15:42,091 --> 00:15:45,450
I saw a pirates game there when they
honored Willie Stargell literally like two

294
00:15:45,451 --> 00:15:48,000
weeks before he died. Oh, pops. Yes.

295
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,970
And I remember it was a cubs game and I
was sitting down in the right field line

296
00:15:50,971 --> 00:15:53,460
and Sammy Sosa was still playing.
And uh,

297
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:58,410
but you were saying your dad has had
season tickets since the stadium that they

298
00:15:58,411 --> 00:16:00,340
played in before three rivers,
which was what,

299
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,670
yeah, my dad has had tickets
since Forbes field, Forbes.

300
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,250
And then they went to Pitt stadium
or something for a couple years.

301
00:16:07,251 --> 00:16:10,310
I may have this reverse, but he's had
them like in both of those places.

302
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:15,640
Then they went to three rivers and my
dad sat exactly on the 54 rows from the

303
00:16:17,061 --> 00:16:19,030
top four rows for us

304
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:22,800
top. And he sat there and he,
he watched them go from sucking,

305
00:16:22,801 --> 00:16:24,900
I mean you guys were the absolute,
you know,

306
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:27,960
you're one of the original NFL teams and
you are a doormat for the good, what,

307
00:16:27,961 --> 00:16:29,100
30 40 years.

308
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:33,270
It's finally come back to where now
we're like better than we suck. Like,

309
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:38,120
like I was born in 1969 that's
the year they drafted Joe Greene.

310
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:41,450
I'm 43 for the first 40 years.

311
00:16:41,451 --> 00:16:44,240
They you when like four
games now we finally,

312
00:16:44,241 --> 00:16:47,810
now it's like we'd been better than,
and then we've been, then we sucked.

313
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:49,790
It was probably when I was
watching the Super Bowl era. Yeah.

314
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:52,220
Cause when I was like five or six,
my dad would take me to games.

315
00:16:52,221 --> 00:16:56,510
That's when it was all steel workers
went there. And you saw Lambert Ham?

316
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:57,860
I saw every,

317
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:02,690
I saw the game where Bradshaw supine
in the ice anyway. Lay off games.

318
00:17:02,691 --> 00:17:05,630
Yeah. I mean the greatest
thing was we were on our,

319
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:09,170
our side was this dealer that was on
the cover of sports illustrated I think.

320
00:17:09,171 --> 00:17:11,240
Yeah.
Our side was on the Steeler bench.

321
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:16,360
So the greatest thrill ever is in a is
the Steelers would kick off and then

322
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:22,490
this, then okay, the other team would
have the ball one, two, three and out.

323
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,411
And then this too,

324
00:17:23,411 --> 00:17:27,120
this come off to our side and then it's
like watching the hall of fame induction

325
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:31,350
community come off. But I mean that's
the Steelers and the place of that.

326
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:33,550
There's 11 guys on defense,
like six of them,

327
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:38,560
maybe a well four for four on defense
and a dude LC Greenwood bell sees not in

328
00:17:39,981 --> 00:17:41,060
yet. He isn't. No,

329
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:46,090
it's mean Joe Lambert Ham and Mel Blunt
and then it's on the offense as Webster

330
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:50,160
Swann Stallworth Bradshaw Franco and of
course the emperor Chuck Noll and they

331
00:17:50,161 --> 00:17:50,740
used to be flat.

332
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:51,573
That's nine.

333
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:57,100
Nine out of your 22 that's almost
half the guys on your fucking t.

334
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:00,000
Your of your starting team made
the fucking hall of fame on a foot

335
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:00,853
ball team.

336
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:04,730
Well the thing was is in for years they
wouldn't put swan or Stallworth in and

337
00:18:04,731 --> 00:18:06,140
it used to be the old
manager of the punchline.

338
00:18:06,141 --> 00:18:09,140
Jim Cornet knew at like five in the
morning when I'm bottle of crown and you

339
00:18:09,141 --> 00:18:11,120
want to get me to argue for an hour,
just say,

340
00:18:11,121 --> 00:18:13,130
I don't think Lynn Swann
should be in the hall of fame.

341
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:14,980
Okay.

342
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:18,000
That, that was always, it's almost
like now I can die in peace.

343
00:18:18,001 --> 00:18:19,030
Like the ranger fan?
No,

344
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,920
like that was the first time we brought
up you and I discussed all Samuelson and

345
00:18:22,921 --> 00:18:25,620
Cam Neil and you were like, yeah, I
mean, yeah, you know I didn't take off.

346
00:18:25,621 --> 00:18:29,970
Was that bad a guy I was
like, you got and you,

347
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:33,600
what's funny about you is you
just don't ever lose your cool.

348
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:35,820
You just sit there and just
be like, hey, you know,

349
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,550
which was making me
fucking matter and matter.

350
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:42,030
I remember we were over fucking Jimmy
doors and Jimmy was killing everybody

351
00:18:42,031 --> 00:18:45,930
playing ping pong. Oh, take an inbetween.
Jimmy was fucking talking shit to him.

352
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:47,850
Just,
I'm just returning the ball bill.

353
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:51,030
I'm just returning the ball and he
put all this fucking spin on it.

354
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,200
I get my ass kicked off.

355
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,160
Well, the Democrats must've
been losing that year.

356
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,550
Don't play door when the
Republicans in the White House,

357
00:18:57,551 --> 00:18:58,660
he'll take it out on you.

358
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:03,390
Exactly. So we got in that epic fight,
but you know, I'm trying to think.

359
00:19:03,391 --> 00:19:06,510
So the first NFL game you went to you,
he brought you there when you were like,

360
00:19:06,511 --> 00:19:07,380
what,
four or five years?

361
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:10,140
Yes. There was like 10, 10, no women,

362
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:14,370
no women ever in like just 10 boys
that were lucky enough to have.

363
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,840
I went with my dad and my grandpop
and that was the original curtain,

364
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:19,200
the original everything.

365
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:23,780
So wait, um, now can you remember, did you
ever see Oj Simpson? I'm eats a frame. No,

366
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:27,030
I won't eat some of the guys you saw
because the first game I went to was like,

367
00:19:27,031 --> 00:19:30,330
I'm the 80s. I saw the guys
like Dan Marino. I saw Jim Zorn.

368
00:19:30,331 --> 00:19:33,450
I saw guys from like leftovers 70
guys and all the 80 guys when I,

369
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,880
when I would go to the patriots,
but like 70s guys,

370
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:38,850
that's when I collected football cards.
That's when they were like gods to me.

371
00:19:38,851 --> 00:19:42,430
So can you remember anybody,
uh, any party you saw Earl?

372
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:44,840
Oh yeah.
I still saw Earl Campbell to me,

373
00:19:44,841 --> 00:19:47,270
still the greatest running back I've
ever seen because he's the only guy that,

374
00:19:47,271 --> 00:19:48,260
that was when I was a kid.

375
00:19:48,261 --> 00:19:52,910
I was ever afraid of like when I was a
kid that the Steelers were like the globe

376
00:19:52,911 --> 00:19:53,744
trotters.

377
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:58,760
Like they never law when they lost in
[inaudible] 77 to the orange crush in

378
00:19:58,761 --> 00:20:01,010
Denver in mean Joe,
my favorite Steeler,

379
00:20:01,011 --> 00:20:03,590
obviously he punched the guy in
the stomach and got thrown out.

380
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:07,370
It ruined Christmas.
Like I still believed in Santa Claus,

381
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,400
but the Steelers losing and
mean joke and tossed out.

382
00:20:10,401 --> 00:20:12,980
It was like Christmas was ruined.
I was such a fucked up. Yeah.

383
00:20:12,981 --> 00:20:15,260
That was the year with Craig Morton
and those guys, right? Ah, yeah.

384
00:20:15,261 --> 00:20:19,100
That's next week. They'd beat the
Raiders. Yes. John Madden, Madden,

385
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:22,880
and then they got crushed by the cowboys,
which is such a joke. Oh, the team.

386
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:25,760
The team. That decade where there,
you'd never beat anybody for real.

387
00:20:25,761 --> 00:20:28,520
When it ever really mattered. Dallas,
they wouldn't have a called the team.

388
00:20:28,521 --> 00:20:30,790
They would call Americas two Americas
team. Yeah. That's like, whoa.

389
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,710
Nope. America's team means is
that you have fans in every city.

390
00:20:33,711 --> 00:20:36,650
It doesn't mean that you're the
best team will take that the wrong.

391
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:39,850
Well for years though, it's like they
always revisions. We know this and that,

392
00:20:39,851 --> 00:20:44,110
you know, and it's like Lynn Swann
always says the game gives you moments.

393
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:49,630
It's what you do with those moments. Yeah.
And Jackie Smith, you dropped the ball.

394
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,090
You must be the sickest man in America.

395
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:56,760
Bless his heart.
He's got to be the sickest man in America.

396
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:59,460
I got to put that clip up
there too. That was like, dude,

397
00:20:59,461 --> 00:21:03,540
I gotta tell you something though.
When I went over to, uh, Stockholm,

398
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:06,450
Sweden and I was totally jet lagged,

399
00:21:06,451 --> 00:21:10,680
some fucking Steeler fan put all four
of the Steelers Superbowls in their

400
00:21:10,681 --> 00:21:14,040
entirety. I don't know if is still up
on youtube. It was the fucking shit.

401
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,990
And I gotta tell you something
about the Dallas cowboys.

402
00:21:15,991 --> 00:21:18,210
1976 they had you guys beat,

403
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:23,130
they played Marty Ball and they started
the game with the fucking reverse on the

404
00:21:23,131 --> 00:21:26,910
kickoff to fucking Hollywood Henderson.
He runs up the sideline.

405
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:30,630
Roy Jarell knocked it, knocked him out
of bounds. He took a need of the ribs.

406
00:21:30,631 --> 00:21:32,940
He missed like three field goals
because of that fucking place.

407
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:37,130
And Tom Landry got all fucking
conservative and shut his offense down.

408
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:41,950
No, ensued the kickoff and let
it in the hands of his defense.

409
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,400
I really like,
I mean,

410
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:48,240
yeah,
like those games really did.

411
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:51,330
That to me is those who like to be like
the best soup I ever saw us just as far

412
00:21:51,331 --> 00:21:55,920
as two powerhouse teams was
that 79 one the Steelers first,

413
00:21:55,921 --> 00:21:59,390
the cowboys and the to that worst,
uh,

414
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:04,530
matchups to the worst matchups that were
almost great fucking super bowls was if

415
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:07,200
the fucking Raiders beat the
stupid orange crush that year.

416
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:10,740
They were defending super bowl champions
and they would've gone up against the

417
00:22:10,741 --> 00:22:13,950
Dallas cowboys with a
rookie Tony Doerr set.

418
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:17,490
Now how much fucking better that guy
and said it's stupid. 27 to 10 game.

419
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:21,360
And then in 85,
when my stupid patriots,

420
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,210
we beat the fucking Miami Dolphins.

421
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,830
The Miami on reason why the bears
didn't go undefeated was because the Dan

422
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:31,650
Marino beat him on Monday night
football beat the 46 defense.

423
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:34,740
They were 15 and fucking won.
It would have been the rematch.

424
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:38,550
Dan Marino defended the
undefeated dolphins that
Superbowl would have happened,

425
00:22:38,551 --> 00:22:40,230
but the stupid fucking patriots.

426
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:44,580
We went into the orange ball one for the
first time in like 20 years and then we

427
00:22:44,581 --> 00:22:47,580
go in there and just, we got Rick, I think
we've got raped. We literally got raped

428
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:52,160
and I hate the, I hate the shit on
the Pittsburgh guy who I love, but he,

429
00:22:52,161 --> 00:22:53,790
he should let pate and get the touchdown.

430
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,480
That was a disgrace when he gave the
fridge the ball really going to get there

431
00:22:57,481 --> 00:22:59,940
and to give the fridge the ball
because the fridge is the fridge

432
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:03,520
cause they got caught.
They got caught up in that soup

433
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,920
as opposed to like Walter Payton

434
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:10,950
who was playing on like two and 14 teams
or two and 12 teams when he started

435
00:23:10,951 --> 00:23:11,770
because they didn't have

436
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:14,270
wait when everyone's still
ran the ball like the SCC,

437
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,790
when football was about it was
a man's game. And it's not like

438
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,930
spread everybody out and
get a pass interference. Oh,
can we talk about that? I,

439
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:23,510
I got to read some advertising
here real quick, but we got to, uh,

440
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:27,980

with the legendary Joe Barton. Nick,

499
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:49,590
before we get into this, aside from the
fact you were one of my great friends,

500
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:53,220
both in and out of this business, uh,
we're here to actually promote Joe Barton.

501
00:26:53,221 --> 00:26:56,880
ACC has a new standup CD,
uh,

502
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:00,840
hour long a CD that he's going to be
releasing off of all things comedy,

503
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:04,680
our podcast network called
salute. Um, tell the, uh,

504
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:06,000
tell the fine folks about it.

505
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:10,210
Oh, it's a, it's a fun CD recorded it
live at the punch line San Francisco.

506
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,650
It's about 15 minutes
of Barton a classics,

507
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,810
so I can hopefully bury
some of that material.

508
00:27:16,811 --> 00:27:18,850
I've been lagging around and need
some new stuff. Everyone's like,

509
00:27:18,851 --> 00:27:22,020
we've heard that 10 times. It's like,
well, you can keep coming back. Thanks.

510
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:27,670
But I'm actually buy it on Amazon
and it comes out Tuesday. Help Bill,

511
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:31,270
help the wounded warriors and don't go
out and traffic. I'll tell you what,

512
00:27:31,271 --> 00:27:33,490
I was just in traffic yesterday
going to a Gig and I was like,

513
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,980
heavenly people figured out Amazon yet.

514
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:40,450
Like you can just sit at home in your
underwear. It's like they have your, your,

515
00:27:40,451 --> 00:27:45,220
your, they have your mastercard, they have
your sister's address. You just go boom,

516
00:27:45,221 --> 00:27:49,480
boom, boom. And then is it,
that's it. It's amazing. But yeah,

517
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:53,420
it's a called salute. Like instead
of cheers as Italian scope salute.

518
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:56,830
And since I'm a big drinker and a lot
of the jokes are about drinking and the

519
00:27:56,831 --> 00:27:58,960
one way or the other,
it's good.

520
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:03,500
First time I ever heard salute was
that on some live old a Sinatra album.

521
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:04,520
I heard it,

522
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:07,490
it was with him with the count Basie
orchestra and they brought out a drink.

523
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:10,340
He said something and he said,
salude Gin Donna,

524
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:11,960
I could almost somewhat Italian shit.
I don't know what.

525
00:28:11,961 --> 00:28:13,490
And he laughed or whatever.
And I was just like,

526
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:16,640
it just seemed like even just
in that moment on the record,

527
00:28:16,641 --> 00:28:21,410
it just seemed like it was
so much better that like, uh,

528
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,710
I dunno, it was just like
if you went and saw frank,

529
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:27,860
it's not like somebody would take out a
fucking iPhone and then film it and then

530
00:28:27,861 --> 00:28:30,980
if you didn't make it, you could see
a clip of it. It's just like you,

531
00:28:30,981 --> 00:28:35,420
it was such a fucking, everything was just
such a fucking event. That's why like,

532
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:39,440
you know why I'm sitting here being
a total geek about listening to you,

533
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:43,170
going to those, you went to NFL
games in the 70 through the 70.

534
00:28:43,171 --> 00:28:46,250
[inaudible] that was like the
golden age of NFL football.

535
00:28:46,251 --> 00:28:48,380
Like the level of quarterbacks
that were in the League,

536
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:53,630
Stabler Bradshaw Stop Act,
Fran Tarkington.

537
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,310
Uh,
who else?

538
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:56,320
Some of the biggest ones.

539
00:28:56,450 --> 00:29:01,450
Even the Shitty quarterbacks like
Ken Anderson or Brian's site,

540
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:06,310
Dan Fouts. Oh, balance is amazing. But
even like, bet, even the backup plan,

541
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:09,210
pastor Areni,
Dante passionate like junk.

542
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:14,040
Don Strock construct would be a
playoff quarterback nowadays. Oh,

543
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:16,900
the way they fucking throw now. Yeah.
They don't even run for four yards.

544
00:29:16,901 --> 00:29:20,310
So those guys will throw for 300 yards
and they're literally like, you know,

545
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:23,830
42 for 48 and you're like,
oh my God, the accuracy.

546
00:29:23,831 --> 00:29:26,260
It's like now they're throwing
four yard fucking passes,

547
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:28,990
but allowed to touch a wide
receiver. I mean, think of,

548
00:29:28,991 --> 00:29:32,290
think of what swan would do now.
They couldn't touch them. I mean,

549
00:29:32,291 --> 00:29:35,470
they used to just try to abuse them
every second did the Raiders are like,

550
00:29:35,471 --> 00:29:39,070
you know, hit him in the head
swan play with concussions
every week. It's like, oh,

551
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:40,010
Mel Blount

552
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:40,221
rule,

553
00:29:40,221 --> 00:29:45,221
which if you can find this
guy's footage on the on on,

554
00:29:45,311 --> 00:29:49,820
on Youtube of the 1976 soup bowl,
Mel blanches beats the shit out of,

555
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:51,040
of a Golden Richards,

556
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:54,340
the whole fucking game called Richard's
almost as crying and the end of it.

557
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:56,590
And he finally gets so fed
up in the fourth quarter,

558
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:59,740
he punches Mel blunt back and Mel Blunt,
just,

559
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:03,910
I forget it was a forearm shiver
or something to his ribs and uh,

560
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:06,490
Golden's laying on the ground,
almost crying, no flag.

561
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:09,790
And like the ref saw like the,
the the fucking elbow and stuff.

562
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:11,620
It was just considered football.

563
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:14,380
It's a man's game.
They used to be football.

564
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:19,420
Well he used to be football was like
the 12 like the 10 guys in the bar.

565
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:24,450
You wouldn't mess with those guys played
football now it's like the 10 guys who

566
00:30:24,641 --> 00:30:27,010
when they were 15 started
taking steroids and like,

567
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:29,600
and they went through all the best
schools and they got recruited and they,

568
00:30:29,601 --> 00:30:32,800
they they did good in the combine
and Blah Blah Blah. It's like,

569
00:30:32,801 --> 00:30:34,030
cause the guys that played the stuff

570
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,320
here, you don't even see me. I'm
just pitching about the rules.

571
00:30:36,321 --> 00:30:39,140
I still think that those
guys are fucking maniacs man.

572
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,390
I just think like the level of like,

573
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:45,080
like the money and there's so much at
stake now that you can't just be going

574
00:30:45,081 --> 00:30:47,810
down to the bar, drinking a 12 pack and
then going out and playing your, your,

575
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:50,930
your high school football
game Friday night. You know,
you really got to take it.

576
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:55,100
But I think the, I think in the 70s
those, those guys were way more outlaws.

577
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,840
They were the outlaws,
the steel.

578
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,960
I mean like Ernie Holmes shot at a
police helicopter and Rooney brought,

579
00:31:02,061 --> 00:31:05,480
uh, brought a bag of money up to
Cleveland. Like I let them off the hook.

580
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:08,930
It was like, it was like that, that
that wouldn't happen now. Nowadays,

581
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:12,740
now that they should have rate [inaudible]
have a Rachel Nichols outside the,

582
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:16,440
outside the facility that
was wrong with Ernie.

583
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:22,580
I mean it's like, I just read that big
ESPN book, that like thousand page book.

584
00:31:22,581 --> 00:31:26,290
I'll give it to you and it's all like
behind the scenes it's like, you know, I,

585
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:29,300
anyway, you painted, I
still hate Suzy Kolber.

586
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:32,030
She despicably did not kiss.

587
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:35,480
I would kiss Joe Willie
name if on national TV.

588
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:41,690
Why would you disparage Joe Willie
name if it's like it's Broadway Joe.

589
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:45,530
Everybody loves the ladies than
poor man had to go to Rehab.

590
00:31:45,531 --> 00:31:46,820
He was embarrassed like you can

591
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:50,520
funny was the second he started
talking. You knew he was hammered. Yeah,

592
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,540
he was just, he just had that
fucking, I can't feel my nose glow.

593
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:57,990
Look on his face, but it's
Joe Namath. He's allowed.

594
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:00,360
I know Andy was back
there with his friends.

595
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,640
You know what they would do and you know,
they would talk and shit gone.

596
00:32:02,641 --> 00:32:05,430
Come on guys. You know, if
we were healthy, we'd fucking
kill this team. You know,

597
00:32:05,431 --> 00:32:08,370
they were having a good time and all of
a sudden he's talking to some fucking

598
00:32:08,371 --> 00:32:12,960
lady and you know him. He went back to
the 70s back at the playboy mansion.

599
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:15,800
Well she grabbed them, the show come
over here and she grabbed was like, well,

600
00:32:15,801 --> 00:32:18,170
what's he going to do?
I really want it kiss.

601
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:23,230
Oh I love do I follow him on Twitter.
He's the best. I love that. I just,

602
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:26,840
I love Joe. Ease the is Joe name. That's,
that's one thing about Pittsburgh too.

603
00:32:26,841 --> 00:32:30,080
It's like, you know, and then you hate
when I go off of it. But you know Johnny,

604
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:31,920
you basically invented football.
Oh

605
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,550
No, no, no, no. I just, I give you shit
about the amount of times that you quote.

606
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,940
Like, I don't give a fuck what situation.
We could be in the middle of the desert,

607
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,830
like running out of water and
you just be like, wait, no.

608
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:43,160
One time Mike Wagner said,

609
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:48,300
well John Stallworth to quote you on to
Stallworth my fucking super fair man.

610
00:32:48,301 --> 00:32:52,560
I keep my two favorite sports coats or
Lynn Swann. The game gives you moments.

611
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,820
My other one is actually,

612
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:57,530
I told it to John Madden's face and he
loves to tell that story though. Okay.

613
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:00,330
So we're out in a business park,
me and my buddy,

614
00:33:00,331 --> 00:33:04,680
the captain out in like an
hour west east of Oakland,

615
00:33:04,681 --> 00:33:08,640
which is basically, if you're not on the
coast and California muzzle be in Texas,

616
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:12,140
right? This is like, this is actually
where they shoot the sons of anarchy. Uh,

617
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:15,750
it's just the bad lands of California.
Anyway, we're out there, uh,

618
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,630
probably dropping off a bag of weed to
a friend of mine or something when we

619
00:33:18,631 --> 00:33:20,780
were there around lunchtime and uh,

620
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:25,410
[inaudible] and we see this massive force
coming out of a diner and John's huge

621
00:33:25,411 --> 00:33:27,690
and he's wearing like a big winter
coat because it gets cold there.

622
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:30,630
It's like 42 recognize Matt.
And immediately, immediately,

623
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:34,230
and that it would be like,
Hey John. So I'm going to go
into captain like, hey man,

624
00:33:34,231 --> 00:33:37,680
like kitten. I'm like, look,
look, look, look, look. And
all of a sudden, so anyway,

625
00:33:37,681 --> 00:33:42,120
we started walking and he's like, oh my
God. So then so there we go. Hey Mr. Mad.

626
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:46,560
Or like, hey, hey, hey, what,
what was, was he freaking
out? He just said guide to be.

627
00:33:46,561 --> 00:33:50,060
Yeah. And I mean the captain at noon
and an office park, it's like a,

628
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:53,430
it's like an office park. We're getting,
you know what these guys want. Yeah.

629
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,710
So he starts walking really fast.

630
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:58,980
Like I'm getting away from these gals
trying to go to his car and he's like not

631
00:33:58,981 --> 00:34:02,670
fun with his keys. He's trying to hurt
with his keys. So then I, so then,

632
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:05,910
so he's totally ignoring us.
Just like maybe these guys will go away.

633
00:34:05,911 --> 00:34:08,490
I'm going to blow my rape whistle,
like get away.

634
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:12,120
And then I just yell out my
favorite quote actually, which is,

635
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:15,120
he told his super bowl pregame speech was,

636
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:19,710
this will be the greatest day
of your life. Only if you win.

637
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:25,050
So you yelled that I yelled at him,
right. Then he turns around and goes, oh,

638
00:34:25,051 --> 00:34:29,360
hey fellas, how you doing? And
he showed us his Superbowl ring.

639
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:32,400
We went over and shook his
hand and then an autograph guy.

640
00:34:32,401 --> 00:34:35,810
And until like a year ago, I
wasn't even a picture guy. Right.

641
00:34:35,890 --> 00:34:38,640
But you kind of have to do that now.
So I'm just like, it was just a thrill.

642
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:43,170
And then literally we got in our car and
just called the first thousand people

643
00:34:43,171 --> 00:34:44,410
we could talk to,
like we just met.

644
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:51,900
They use that line on myself for like
big sets are big shows or big appearances

645
00:34:51,901 --> 00:34:54,390
or something is like, oh, that's what
you use it to psych yourself. Yeah.

646
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,340
Like this'll be the
greatest day of your life.

647
00:34:56,670 --> 00:35:01,080
Only if you kill, I'll leave you kill.
That's hilarious. Fucking late. Yeah.

648
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:05,850
I gotta admit like I'm, I'm,
I'm, I'm fighting really
hard not to become the, uh,

649
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,990
the crabby old guy sitting there
talking about how the game used to be.

650
00:35:09,991 --> 00:35:14,250
And I think, you know, I understand
they got to do what they gotta do.

651
00:35:14,251 --> 00:35:17,250
You understand dude, this,
there's future football.

652
00:35:17,251 --> 00:35:20,650
They're going to start with
the Lyman standing up so
they don't slam their heads.

653
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,550
Well, I would, I understand
is that you know what,

654
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:28,240
you want to live till you're 70
drive a bus. You will, you will,

655
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:33,240
you want to have baby Mamas and mansions
and drive cars. It'd be on Yo MTV raps,

656
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:36,270
then you're going to die when
you're 50 and that's the way it is.

657
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:40,560
If he don't it play in the
CFL, like, I mean that's just,

658
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:43,950
that's just, that's football.
See that's the thing bill. I,

659
00:35:43,951 --> 00:35:47,910
that's what I grew up on. I grew
up on that. That's, it's just,

660
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:52,110
I still enjoy it. How I work for
the NFL on Fox, it pays me. I love,

661
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,660
I get to take it. I watch
every game. It's still good.

662
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,080
It's still better than what you,
98% of everything else,

663
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:03,030
but it's not the third one.
You got five wide receivers in the game.

664
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:09,800
That's not football. Right. I mean, that's
what I love about me. You know, like,

665
00:36:09,801 --> 00:36:12,990
and all these tricks and like Chuck Noll,
coach Chuck Noll again or for the,

666
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:16,890
you know, like, Eh, you can, you can
fool some of the people some of the time.

667
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:21,690
But in the end it comes down to blocking
and tackling. And that's football.

668
00:36:21,691 --> 00:36:26,220
It's about lining up. It's
the Oklahoma drill, you know,
it's bad. Then he would do

669
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:30,720
you quote Steelers the way like a
Jesus free quotes like scripture?

670
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:35,100
Well, NFL films to me, it
shocked knowl three 16 to me,

671
00:36:35,101 --> 00:36:36,180
if you grew up in Pittsburgh,

672
00:36:36,181 --> 00:36:38,910
if you're from Pittsburgh in the
70s you can jerk off to super,

673
00:36:38,911 --> 00:36:41,580
but you could jerk off to NFL films.
It's that great.

674
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:43,860
In San Francisco I was roommates with,

675
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:47,000
that's the greatest running the soup
bowl. Have you guys won? Four and six.

676
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:51,850
Four and six. My, my old roommate, one
of my old roommates who is a complete,

677
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:56,740
uh, art guy and drew and it was sensitive.
He probably wrote poetry, I dunno,

678
00:36:56,860 --> 00:37:01,180
but he hated football,
but he just loved the cinnamon tography.

679
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:05,050
If NFL films unreal, I mean, that's,
that's how great. It's almost like,

680
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:08,320
it's almost like regular football. If
you just watch a game, like whatever,

681
00:37:08,321 --> 00:37:10,060
you're going to watch,
whatever today.

682
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:13,060
It's not as good as watching
the NFL films version.

683
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:17,530
And if, yeah, NFL films, I always
forget the guy, the voice of God.

684
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,550
Oh John Facenda what? The
autumn wind is a radar. Oh yeah.

685
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,440
You know, it was great. You haven't
heard already a already lang.

686
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:31,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, all the
time. I love that. We can dig
in already. That's the best

687
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:33,620
when he quotes that. Oh
yeah. I want to, I went in,

688
00:37:33,621 --> 00:37:35,090
I did nick and already showed such a,

689
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:37,640
if you guys aren't listening
to what your autumn audio mind,

690
00:37:37,641 --> 00:37:40,550
if you just want to listen to two people
talking sports and even if you're not

691
00:37:40,551 --> 00:37:42,740
into sports, you can just going to
love listening to it. Cause it's just,

692
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:46,550
they're just guys, guys. It's fucking
great. And I was sitting out, uh,

693
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:49,840
waiting to go in and he went into his,
uh,

694
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,390
his impression of that the
autumn wind is a radar.

695
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:58,400
I can't remember how the fuck it goes.
And he just did the whole poem. And, uh,

696
00:37:58,490 --> 00:38:01,670
he fucking, he's just his delivery because
he's a fucking great actor too, man.

697
00:38:01,671 --> 00:38:02,504
You know,

698
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:06,660
he's, he's, I mean, I love already
like, I mean, are you laying his,

699
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,790
his football jokes on his,
uh,

700
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:13,050
Jack and coke special is the greatest
when he wrote, when he rips on the eagles.

701
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:16,180
Let's just the funniest thing ever,
I made Kevin Shay watch or like tape.

702
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:16,871
I got to see it.

703
00:38:16,871 --> 00:38:21,400
It's just funny to do a chunk on the
eagles and his standup special. Yeah.

704
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:23,380
Do my buddy Paul verse. He said
one time he goes, you know,

705
00:38:23,381 --> 00:38:26,560
it's fucking weird is everybody
watches sports for the most part.

706
00:38:26,561 --> 00:38:30,490
We say everybody. I mean the masses
watch real men. Yeah, but, but no

707
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:34,610
people who you're going to talk to. What
sports? Not that the guy with the, well,

708
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:35,260
we,

709
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,040
anybody who's into our

710
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:36,910
shit,
real guys,

711
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:41,180
guys that you like it if you're wearing
a hat just because you think it's cool.

712
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,670
Uh, and I like, you're
trying to do like, you know,

713
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,670
I'm not going to talk
to you anyway like that.

714
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,150
That's just how I have you stand up.
Like,

715
00:38:47,151 --> 00:38:49,040
I like the guys who I
would be drinking with.

716
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:51,620
I don't like the guys who I
wouldn't be drinking with.

717
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,720
And that's just the way it is now.
Some guys are just,

718
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:55,540
do I like hanging out with you?
Cause I need a,

719
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,700
over the years I've gotten
a little more fucking,

720
00:38:57,701 --> 00:39:02,350
a little something of your bite neck stuff
has rubbed off on me cause I'm one of

721
00:39:02,351 --> 00:39:04,540
those fucking, I'm like,
you know, I'm a liberal.

722
00:39:04,541 --> 00:39:07,910
I'm one of those empathetic people. Hey,
let me see the other side of this shit.

723
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,700
Lot of people wouldn't believe that.
Listen to this podcast.

724
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,910
Well that's like you go ahead. I'm
sorry, but I fucking, uh, you know,

725
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:17,200
at finally I've gotten to the
point of IOL actually now,

726
00:39:17,201 --> 00:39:20,590
like if someone's a fucking
Dick, I'll just be like, all
right, that guy's a dick.

727
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:24,550
But it's still won't stop me from
trying to understand why they're a dick.

728
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:28,960
But you're, you're, you're like, you're
just so fucking efficient with that shit.

729
00:39:28,961 --> 00:39:32,200
Like I know a couple of guys like
you in my life where it's just,

730
00:39:32,201 --> 00:39:34,900
you've just real efficient,
you size somebody up.

731
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:38,920
And the second you think that they're
udicky like fuck that guy and you don't

732
00:39:38,921 --> 00:39:42,550
give a fuck about whoa. Maybe his
dad laughed. You don't give a fuck.

733
00:39:42,551 --> 00:39:43,690
You just like fuck him.

734
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:47,530
I Dunno. I mean I feel bad for him if
his dad though I feel bad. You know what?

735
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:51,040
I feel bad for people who lose their
mothers cause and just like the,

736
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:52,870
not to be tragic,
the Kansas City thing.

737
00:39:52,871 --> 00:39:55,310
That's what's sad is like some weeks
it doesn't have a mother, but uh,

738
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:58,390
that's a fucking, I didn't want to get
into it cause it's just a sad topic.

739
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:02,890
But uh, the uh, no, uh, we're
going to talk about now, uh, oh,

740
00:40:02,891 --> 00:40:07,000
sizing people up. Well, I grew up in
bars. My grandfather owned and ran bars.

741
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:08,440
And so

742
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:13,070
wait a minute, why the fuck isn't that
the name of your Special Joe Part? Nick?

743
00:40:13,071 --> 00:40:17,780
I grew up in bars. If you
somehow had picture, if you
sitting there on this stool,

744
00:40:17,781 --> 00:40:19,520
I'm sorry,
I'm interrupting you Greg Story.

745
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,750
No, no, no, but that's
so, you know, when you're,

746
00:40:21,751 --> 00:40:26,700
when you're like four years old in
Pittsburgh, in, in the 70s. And bars.

747
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,130
You can size people up.

748
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:32,280
You understand people's Mojo in
about a second if they're good old.

749
00:40:32,281 --> 00:40:34,560
Were you when they, when he, when you
were getting brought into these bars,

750
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:37,830
like three, four, five, six
of my grandfather always
have three. He was like norm,

751
00:40:37,831 --> 00:40:40,610
he had a seat in every bar. He
goes and people are like, hey hair.

752
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:42,300
He can everybody Harry,
his name was Dominic.

753
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:44,100
He was like the original
guy that would say, dude,

754
00:40:44,101 --> 00:40:46,650
cause he couldn't remember a million
people's names. So he would just go,

755
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:50,310
hey hair. Hey Harry. And he was totally
bald. That's why it's either games.

756
00:40:50,311 --> 00:40:52,410
He was the genie cause they'd
rub his head for good luck.

757
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:55,580
They actually rubbed his head before
the immaculate reception and that's,

758
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:56,640
that's a true story.

759
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:59,480
So he was always the genie after
that to lift up what's happening?

760
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:00,790
Say that you were at that game.

761
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:03,950
I was not at the immaculate
reception game. No, it was not.

762
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:08,820
My first live game was in
1976 actually it was the,

763
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:11,600
it was Tampa Bay versus the Steelers.

764
00:41:11,601 --> 00:41:15,020
They won 40 to nothing in a blizzard.
No ones.

765
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:17,180
Half the quarterback
was Doug Williams there.

766
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:20,710
I don't remember.
I mean I was like six years old.

767
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:23,020
It was just a blizzard and
everyone was mad that we went.

768
00:41:23,021 --> 00:41:25,020
That's where my dad would
go to every game to Mac.

769
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:29,620
Now if it's like raining and in early
October, Eh, it's a little chilly outside.

770
00:41:29,621 --> 00:41:33,010
I'm going to stay home.
But before Kizzy waited 40 years to see a,

771
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:37,100
but just as you saw I sites were up like
and women to spray like that and an old

772
00:41:37,101 --> 00:41:39,730
girlfriend of mine was like, she was
like, I love Sarah over by there.

773
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:42,380
Her name was like, Sarah. Sarah is a
great friend of mine. She's my friend.

774
00:41:42,381 --> 00:41:45,140
I'm like, she's like, cause I'm
like, don't, don't deal with her.

775
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:47,810
We broke up three years later,

776
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:52,580
this girl comes in because you were so
right about Sarah. She was such a big,

777
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:57,770
I'm like, I told you I can just, but other
people in Hollywood or they were like,

778
00:41:57,850 --> 00:41:59,660
they're, they're nice to everybody
because they were all only one.

779
00:41:59,661 --> 00:42:02,570
If that guy gets it. Tonight's show
and, and the old way, like really?

780
00:42:02,571 --> 00:42:05,110
Who gives a shit? Like life's
too short. If he's a dick now,

781
00:42:05,111 --> 00:42:06,980
he'll be a dick then I don't really care.

782
00:42:06,981 --> 00:42:10,190
Like I'm friends with who I want
to be friends with, but I'm nice.

783
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:13,400
I'm pretty much nice to everybody though.
I'm just not their friends.

784
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:14,780
No,
no I wouldn't.

785
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:17,530
I would 100% agree with that before we
get too deep into the podcast and we're

786
00:42:17,531 --> 00:42:18,700
going to talk football the whole time.

787
00:42:18,701 --> 00:42:22,060
I mean I guess there's not a lot to talk
about. What about fucking hockey? But uh,

788
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:24,490
and there was Saturday I been kind of
blaming the owners cause it's been a

789
00:42:24,491 --> 00:42:27,330
lockout and they agreed to a deal but
someone was giving me shit on Twitter

790
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:29,570
saying, did you see this
shift to players did now you,

791
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:31,630
are you still on the player's side?
I hope not.

792
00:42:31,631 --> 00:42:34,120
And I haven't really been paying
attention. Last I paid attention.

793
00:42:34,121 --> 00:42:38,220
They were down to like, you know,
players were going from 57% and out of 50

794
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:43,020
I have three things to say about the
hockey thing. One is why does it just,

795
00:42:43,021 --> 00:42:46,080
I know, let me Save, talk you three
times. But he used to come back again.

796
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,730
What does it Lemahieu Shanahan,

797
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:51,810
Holly and Steve Eiserman just getting
a room and just say, you know what, we,

798
00:42:51,930 --> 00:42:56,670
you know, this is the fucking game. Here's
the deal. Just play hockey in. That's it.

799
00:42:56,850 --> 00:43:00,090
But the two things I do want to say is
like, you know the other for like a month,

800
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:04,320
I'm like, it's dark outside. I need to
be watching five games. Like I'm shaking.

801
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:08,550
Then last week I just was like, you know
what? I'm reading the book. I don't,

802
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:12,270
I don't miss it. And you know
what? Nhl, if I'm not missing it,

803
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,570
who the hell is going to
be watching like Carolina,

804
00:43:15,571 --> 00:43:18,930
Ottawa on Fox sports south to alternate,

805
00:43:20,290 --> 00:43:23,340
you know you don't want, I've got me
back in the hot. I'm not watching it.

806
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:24,660
Who's going to,
who's who's coming back?

807
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:28,760
They're really sad thing is my daughter
for Christmas got this doll that's like

808
00:43:28,761 --> 00:43:31,830
the super doll that you have to
knife to buy $80 outfits for.

809
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:34,890
So my sister was like,
I'm going to buy her a penguin outfit.

810
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,780
The lady in Pittsburgh is like,
oh,

811
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:40,320
we're not making penguin outfits
this year because of the strike shit.

812
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:44,250
I'll get her a Steeler one. So that's
just how far down like everything is.

813
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:48,560
The hockey just gets lower and
lower now because of the stress.

814
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:51,440
Stupid. And they made more money
than they ever made. They get the,

815
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:52,550
they have the winter classic dude,

816
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:57,050
it's an NHL hockey has not been
on network television on NBC,

817
00:43:57,051 --> 00:44:01,100
CBS or ABC has not been on it
the entire time I've watched it.

818
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:02,330
It was on in the 70s.

819
00:44:02,331 --> 00:44:06,560
The worst time they could've made the
deal when it was just absolutely a fucking

820
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:11,420
bar room brawl every, um, every game you
don't something, this is the one thing,

821
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:15,020
the only thing I like it just two things
I like about the Montreal Canadians

822
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,390
being a Bruins fan.

823
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:21,770
One was when they booed Patrick
Wa and he said, fuck you guys,

824
00:44:21,771 --> 00:44:24,650
I'm never playing here again,
cause that really fucked that franchise.

825
00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:26,540
And then he goes to when
to with the avalanche,

826
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:28,610
which were the Nordiques
so that could piss off

827
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:31,980
the, uh, the, the Ray Borg Cup. Yeah.

828
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:36,330
Yeah. It was awful. We, we, what
do you think about that though? Um,

829
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:37,291
I actually,

830
00:44:37,291 --> 00:44:41,900
I don't have a problem with it because let
me get you the other thing. Okay. Yeah.

831
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:44,170
The thing about that I
loved was when fucking, uh,

832
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:48,360
Larry Robinson beat the shit out of
Dave Schultz to start the Canadians run

833
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:50,790
where he was just standing up to
him was like, all right buddy,

834
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:54,470
you want to play this fucking
game? No, that's, I mean,
you, you, you, you know my,

835
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:58,350
I love that. You know, my hatred for
the flyers. Oh, it's, it's legendary.

836
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,640
Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh and Philly. They,
they're in the same state. They are.

837
00:45:02,641 --> 00:45:03,990
That's Hatfield and McCoys.

838
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:09,150
That's the only rivalry Pittsburgh
has because people like when the bed,

839
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:11,310
the browns, it's like, Oh, you're
not Robert with your doormat.

840
00:45:11,311 --> 00:45:16,170
The ravens there like new
and who, who cares? I mean,
the flyers and the penguins.

841
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:19,210
We've, we used to be, oh,
for Nixon we were like, oh,

842
00:45:19,211 --> 00:45:24,030
for Watergate in the spectrum until
[inaudible] 88. I mean, it's just, I mean,

843
00:45:24,031 --> 00:45:27,030
that's it. And that's fans
and their fans hated Lemieux,

844
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:29,280
but then they actually cheered
Lemahieu when it came back for cancer.

845
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:31,710
They hate Crosby.
Lot of fancy Crosby,

846
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:35,610
but they hate Crosby and he
cries be just sticks it to them.

847
00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:40,560
That's just the best people have to
have a hateable face. Crosby has,

848
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:44,730
he has sort of a Danny Ainge pouty
face. That's that. Unless he's your guy,

849
00:45:44,731 --> 00:45:48,690
you're not going to like it. He's, he's
the best. So it's like Lebron people just,

850
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:51,300
there's haters. No,
they're already, exactly,

851
00:45:51,301 --> 00:45:55,200
they're already going to fucking
hate him. But he, he's so much east,

852
00:45:55,201 --> 00:45:57,630
so much easier to hate because
there's something about his face.

853
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:00,780
It'd be like Eli Manning would
be so much more respected.

854
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:04,890
You'd be at least considered
at Aaron Rodgers level,

855
00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:09,000
which I think he finally has after that
second one. But like, it was, his face is,

856
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:13,530
he just doesn't look like, you know,
he doesn't have like that fucking, uh,

857
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,090
everything's gonna be okay.

858
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:18,850
I'm banging the fucking captain
of the cheerleaders fucking, uh,

859
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:23,010
in high school, maybe hooked
up with a teacher, just said,

860
00:46:23,011 --> 00:46:26,490
fucking get out of that fucking
five o'clock, shadow the gunslinger.

861
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:31,440
He doesn't have that. Look. Luck
has that look luck. Luck is a myth.

862
00:46:31,470 --> 00:46:34,290
I love the fact that, you know,
something I realized, I, uh,

863
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:38,130
cause the fact that actually like Andrew
Luck and actually liked the cults.

864
00:46:38,131 --> 00:46:41,760
Now I actually realized that I never
really even hated Peyton manning.

865
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:44,580
I just hated the Tom Brady that
wasn't getting the respect.

866
00:46:44,581 --> 00:46:45,690
Cause now like I'm watching,

867
00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:49,860
I'm watching Peyton manning with
the Broncos and I'm rooting for him.

868
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:52,090
And I actually think the
Patriots, dude, I, man,

869
00:46:52,091 --> 00:46:53,970
I don't even know if we beat the
dolphins at this point. It was close.

870
00:46:53,971 --> 00:46:58,020
But like I say, we already beat
Broncos this year. We got a 50,

871
00:46:58,021 --> 00:47:02,880
50 chance of, of, um,
of, of losing fucking,

872
00:47:02,881 --> 00:47:05,100
uh, we play them in the
playoffs because he, he's,

873
00:47:05,101 --> 00:47:08,340
he's so jelled with that
team now. Oh, they're good.

874
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:13,620
The Broncos on anybody, but I mean,
anybody be Houston. Give me a break.

875
00:47:13,621 --> 00:47:15,300
I'm saying Houston,
Houston.

876
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:19,920
I mean like gimme your old school
hatred of the Oilers. Oilers,

877
00:47:19,921 --> 00:47:20,754
not marijuana.

878
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:27,480
I used to have this shirt that had the
little iron on from the mall that had a

879
00:47:27,481 --> 00:47:30,070
bum Phillips beating on the
door that said Super Bowl

880
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:33,100
and Jack Lambert's in front of it.
Just holding it back like,

881
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:37,930
like a bomb knocking on this door. They
can't, they won't let him in. Awe Dude,

882
00:47:37,931 --> 00:47:39,760
if you still had that,
that's fucking legend.

883
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:45,120
The sweat rings of visa right through.
But uh, no, I mean I just used it.

884
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:47,930
Certainly. I mean like, I mean this dude,
these are down here. But I mean like I,

885
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:49,570
the thing about the AFC to me is like,

886
00:47:49,571 --> 00:47:54,070
you always either go through Pittsburgh
or you gotta go through the Baltimore

887
00:47:54,070 --> 00:47:54,670
Cause unless you,

888
00:47:54,670 --> 00:47:59,140
unless you can look James Harrison and
Polamalu in the face and say we're going

889
00:47:59,141 --> 00:48:01,990
to cover both.
Or you can look uncle ray in the face.

890
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,660
Then you haven't really beaten,

891
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:10,050
you haven't played man football and
Houston Schwab, really. Schwab, Schwab.

892
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:15,070
You think boot ballot check is Gail
that Schwab go to the Super Bowl,

893
00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:19,280
the patriots. So we we put up Gadi numb.
I feel like we're the patriots right now.

894
00:48:19,281 --> 00:48:22,670
We're like how the colts were back
in the day when, when pate manning,

895
00:48:22,730 --> 00:48:26,090
they would go 13 and three or 12 and
four and then losing the first round.

896
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:27,770
We don't lose in the first round,
but like,

897
00:48:28,190 --> 00:48:30,530
like we're not going to play the bills.

898
00:48:30,531 --> 00:48:32,240
We're not going to play
the jets in January.

899
00:48:32,241 --> 00:48:34,760
So who gives a fuck that we
put up 50 fucking points.

900
00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:37,720
It inflates your stats and it
makes everybody think that yeah,

901
00:48:37,730 --> 00:48:42,730
this juggernaut and the best thing our
secondary has going for it is our running

902
00:48:42,951 --> 00:48:47,150
game because it can chew up the clock
and keeps them off the field as long as

903
00:48:47,151 --> 00:48:48,110
possible because dude,

904
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:52,760
we fucking let up like 300 yards
to that bomb and fucking Buffalo,

905
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:56,570
whatever the fuck his name is. Patrick.
Yeah, he's out there like he's fucking

906
00:48:57,620 --> 00:49:01,290
his contract. His horse, his
country is horrible. His country,

907
00:49:01,291 --> 00:49:02,930
he's like 10 years for all this money.

908
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:08,470
He's like just not even my strength and
their contract with Ryan for his back

909
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:08,960
deck

910
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:11,870
is that Ray Borg thing. Where you going
to ask me like how I felt about it?

911
00:49:12,230 --> 00:49:16,160
Like you got to understand that that
the Bruins fan base was so loyal.

912
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:18,590
It didn't matter that
we weren't winning cups.

913
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:20,980
They were still going to
sell it out and send it in.

914
00:49:20,990 --> 00:49:25,460
Those guys would just cheap fucks and
they would never just make that extra move

915
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:26,900
to get us over the top.

916
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:32,080
And Ray stayed with us dude from 1979
to June of 2000 and he went through,

917
00:49:35,691 --> 00:49:40,400
I don't know how many
rebuildings especially in the
90s when we really started

918
00:49:40,401 --> 00:49:43,040
falling off. He went through he
fuck, what was he supposed to do?

919
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:44,450
He had one more year left.

920
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:48,830
There was no fucking way we were going to
win it and that was they denim a solid.

921
00:49:48,831 --> 00:49:52,040
They traded them to a contender and
they still had to go out and win it.

922
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:56,750
The only thing I didn't like, and I
know his heart was in the right place,

923
00:49:56,751 --> 00:49:58,250
but when he finally won the cup,

924
00:49:58,490 --> 00:50:02,810
he brought the cup back to Boston as
like a show of, hey man, you know,

925
00:50:02,811 --> 00:50:05,300
here's the Stanley Cup.
And it's just like,

926
00:50:05,450 --> 00:50:08,390
I know his heart was in the right place,
but it was brutal. It's like, yeah,

927
00:50:08,391 --> 00:50:12,530
here's this thing you have in fucking one
in 30 28 years at that point you're 28

928
00:50:12,531 --> 00:50:15,660
years. But um, but so I
don't have, I don't know.

929
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:18,600
It was cool. We went to Denver
too, so it's like a new city.

930
00:50:18,601 --> 00:50:20,550
It wasn't like he went to like,
oh,

931
00:50:20,551 --> 00:50:24,090
I would say the flyers and fan he went
to like the rangers or someone that's

932
00:50:24,091 --> 00:50:27,180
just like, oh look, you've hated him
for 30 years now here it's like, yeah,

933
00:50:27,210 --> 00:50:28,700
I don't forget,
don't get mad at a laundry.

934
00:50:28,701 --> 00:50:32,150
Didn't even have a team like Ray Allen
going to Miami. It doesn't bug me.

935
00:50:32,151 --> 00:50:34,460
Like people actually get like pissed.
Like he was one of our guys.

936
00:50:34,461 --> 00:50:39,020
It's like he wasn't, he was, he was a
free agent. He's, he's Jim Calhoun's guy.

937
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:41,690
I don't, I don't, you know
who my way more than me.

938
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:45,950
I mean hoop is a hoop is and it's so
sad. Talking about the demise, the NFL,

939
00:50:46,070 --> 00:50:49,790
the biggest demise. Demise of
the big east. Why now? Huh?

940
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:52,940
Big He spec college basketball. We
was supposed to talk about that. Oh,

941
00:50:52,941 --> 00:50:55,430
there's gonna be worth it. Yeah.
Oh, we still can't. It's the gray.

942
00:50:55,670 --> 00:50:59,660
I used to watch that all the time. Fucking
Georgetown. Chris Mullin. Pete. I mean,

943
00:50:59,661 --> 00:51:02,270
whenever people say they were
the Washington, I read that book.

944
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:06,060
Oh you know Nascar and
no,

945
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:11,080
he know what you know what invented ESPN
was the big east because then because

946
00:51:11,481 --> 00:51:13,400
he had no stupid
programming in the African,

947
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:16,610
you didn't have like a Michelle
Beale on in the afternoon talking.

948
00:51:16,730 --> 00:51:20,450
Let's see what Collin Coward things like
who gives a shit what that guy thinks

949
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:25,580
they, they just ran big east basketball
games again in the afternoon.

950
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:28,400
So what we need when you're out
all night in high school playing,

951
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:31,640
then you just stay home from school
the next day and watch the big east all

952
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:32,040
afternoon.
My Grandmother,

953
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:34,160
let me stay home from school at the
time I just watched the big east.

954
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,240
It was the best used to go to New York
too. And you will go to New York City,

955
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:41,030
the tournament's. Yeah, absolutely.
So you saw Ewing and I saw,

956
00:51:41,090 --> 00:51:42,980
I saw two years in a row,

957
00:51:42,981 --> 00:51:46,580
I saw the Patrick Ewing the year that
they won the big east championship.

958
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:50,690
We actually saw them in Laguardia,
their whole team.

959
00:51:50,691 --> 00:51:53,780
And my dad's still pissed this day cause
I became a Knicks fan because I love

960
00:51:53,781 --> 00:51:57,410
Pat Ewing didn't give me an autograph.
My Dad wanted to sucker punch him.

961
00:51:58,070 --> 00:52:00,740
He didn't give you an autograph
though, the whole team. So Bill Martin,

962
00:52:00,741 --> 00:52:02,900
who was the power forward back
then gave me an autograph.

963
00:52:03,050 --> 00:52:07,940
But these guys were huge and Thompson was
the biggest unwell. And Thompson goes,

964
00:52:07,941 --> 00:52:09,110
who wants lunch hoards?

965
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:14,120
Remember horns Broadnax he the stack a
hundred dollar bills like John Goddy.

966
00:52:14,350 --> 00:52:17,660
He's ripping them off, give him
the, giving them the players. Jesus.

967
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:22,790
And then two seconds later, Andre the
giant walk past and I swear to God,

968
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:27,560
I'm almost ready to call bullshit on that
store size. What I can call my dad's,

969
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:32,480
except he's at, he's like,
you know, panicking over the
coals over the Baltimore.

970
00:52:32,481 --> 00:52:35,150
I said colts. That's how old
school I am. I getting ravens.

971
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:39,020
That's fucking awesome.
I,

972
00:52:39,021 --> 00:52:41,900
you know he's already happy interrupted
eight months ago. The work already.

973
00:52:41,901 --> 00:52:46,070
What happened to a bottle of a J and
B or something? Whenever he's 18,

974
00:52:46,190 --> 00:52:49,060
he my dad like he likes to mix it up.
I respect that. He's like, you know,

975
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:52,010
he changed it up some days but he
married some these, they never know.

976
00:52:52,011 --> 00:52:56,120
He's ain't gon go back to Andre. Oh always
interrupt your great stories. So, so, uh,

977
00:52:56,270 --> 00:53:00,140
so literally, uh, just right after that
we lock up Andre the giant walks bet.

978
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:03,110
Honestly, John Thompson was
bigger shoulder wise than him,

979
00:53:03,310 --> 00:53:04,760
but he walked by just how big he was.

980
00:53:04,761 --> 00:53:08,120
He actually duct and assign
in Laguardia Airport signs.

981
00:53:08,121 --> 00:53:12,830
Like she can see from six 10? No,
he's like seven, four. Who is Andrea?

982
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:15,830
The giant. I'm sorry, I thought you were
talking about Oh John Tops. Like, so yeah,

983
00:53:15,831 --> 00:53:17,810
he's backed up bill. Okay. All right.

984
00:53:17,870 --> 00:53:20,900
That's how he knows how to play
center cause he worked with giant,

985
00:53:20,901 --> 00:53:23,120
they had a thing in sports
illustrated one time and they would,

986
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,980
they would just uh, they
talked about, you know, all the

987
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:29,670
shit he would do as a joke.
Like he would like somebody's car.

988
00:53:29,671 --> 00:53:32,580
He would like turn it around and face
it and make it facing the other way.

989
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:34,710
And they showed him like one
night he allegedly drunk,

990
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:38,280
drank like a hundred beers and they showed
him when he holds a 12 ounce beer can

991
00:53:38,281 --> 00:53:41,880
in his hand. I liked the top of
the can is flush with like if you,

992
00:53:41,881 --> 00:53:43,980
how old your hand sideways,
the way you would hold a bear,

993
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:47,790
like from the top of his hand to the
bottom of his hand is the whole beer.

994
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:50,220
He could fit a 12 ounce can
and there it literally looked,

995
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:54,330
it wasn't even like a pony. It looked
like half a pony shot. So it's just like,

996
00:53:54,331 --> 00:53:56,910
yeah, this is like him
doing like three swallows.

997
00:53:56,911 --> 00:53:58,830
He'd be done with it and
still raise a hundred beers.

998
00:53:58,831 --> 00:54:00,720
It's still fucking respectful. But, uh,

999
00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:04,360
he's one of the greatest biographies
on a and e ever cause right.

1000
00:54:04,361 --> 00:54:06,040
What he knew was gonna die
at like four months left.

1001
00:54:06,041 --> 00:54:09,490
He just went back to his hometown and
just played cards with all of his friends

1002
00:54:09,491 --> 00:54:13,720
until he died. Just like just bought like
a cabin. Just like, yeah, come on over.

1003
00:54:13,721 --> 00:54:17,240
I got a kegger playing cars I
think is fucking on, you know,

1004
00:54:17,241 --> 00:54:19,420
so you know how bad I
hope I go out like that.

1005
00:54:20,410 --> 00:54:24,460
Cause you know this something to be said
about dying peacefully, like in your,

1006
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:28,090
in your sleep and not realizing it.
But there's also, there is something,

1007
00:54:28,091 --> 00:54:31,930
if you've lived long enough and you've
done, you know, he had the kids,

1008
00:54:31,931 --> 00:54:34,390
you get you, you went after your
dream, he did all that stuff.

1009
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:38,140
Bendis whatever did did
shit you wanted to do and

1010
00:54:38,310 --> 00:54:42,600
was the most recognizable human being
on the face of the earth. That's all.

1011
00:54:42,690 --> 00:54:45,360
That's the only thing that Andre
accomplished at his Wikipedia page.

1012
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:50,580
It was unreal. Yeah, he was,
he was like bigger than Jordan,

1013
00:54:50,910 --> 00:54:52,600
like literally bigger than I,

1014
00:54:52,710 --> 00:54:55,500
they still have those fucking
stickers that obey thing.

1015
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:57,820
That's his face that they
have all the way around that.

1016
00:54:57,821 --> 00:54:59,840
But I would love to go out
like that and just be like,

1017
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:03,470
when you're like fucking 85
and they just go, all right,

1018
00:55:03,471 --> 00:55:05,660
you have three months to
live. And you're like, cool.

1019
00:55:05,661 --> 00:55:08,480
And enough of your friends a
left. That's the one thing, dude,

1020
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:11,940
if you live too long, you fucking
outlive all your friends. I just said,

1021
00:55:11,941 --> 00:55:14,000
my grandmother, God
bless her, she just, uh,

1022
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:16,430
she passed away just
shy of 105th birthday.

1023
00:55:17,210 --> 00:55:22,040
She was on her third set of front,
like generation. Like she outlived,

1024
00:55:23,090 --> 00:55:27,830
I mean, it's just unbelievable. I
mean, uh, you know, she played bridge,

1025
00:55:27,831 --> 00:55:30,710
kept her mind sharp and she had
to just keep getting new friends.

1026
00:55:31,610 --> 00:55:35,240
She outlived my grandfather
by fucking 25 years,

1027
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:40,670
25 fucking, they were married for
62 years. Mean granted they get,

1028
00:55:40,671 --> 00:55:42,020
they eloped when they
were like, you know, six,

1029
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:45,000
it's 17 like way back in the
day when you could back then

1030
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:47,581
you weren't,
you weren't like,

1031
00:55:47,581 --> 00:55:50,700
I think we're going to move in together
for a while and then see how it goes.

1032
00:55:50,701 --> 00:55:54,760
We're gonna get, we're gonna get the dog
and if we can do that then yeah, yeah,

1033
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:58,090
yeah. No, they to do anything.
You better be married. Lead.

1034
00:55:58,250 --> 00:56:01,970
Exactly. That was exactly his yesterday.
They eloped. But yeah, so they made,

1035
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,820
cause I remember going to their 60th
anniversary and that was like in the

1036
00:56:04,821 --> 00:56:06,140
fucking eighties,
dude.

1037
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:11,000
That was like 84 85 my grandfather passed
in [inaudible] 87 and then she lived

1038
00:56:11,001 --> 00:56:13,650
all the way to 2012 but that's the
thing there is you, you actually,

1039
00:56:13,651 --> 00:56:17,420
you end up like you, you
outlived everybody. Somebody
was telling me last night,

1040
00:56:17,421 --> 00:56:21,520
I'm working with Todd Rex, who I
got to get on this podcast. Todd,

1041
00:56:21,550 --> 00:56:25,300
we're at t rex is one of the
funniest motherfuckers he ever, oh,

1042
00:56:25,301 --> 00:56:29,390
that's that story I told on this podcast.
You know, he says, Hey, what do you say?

1043
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:32,380
It's him. You know, he
says the Shit we, uh,

1044
00:56:32,410 --> 00:56:34,930
we got pulled over cause his windows
were too tinted or something.

1045
00:56:34,931 --> 00:56:38,820
This guy pulls us over. We're on the
101. The Guy, you know, the guys talking,

1046
00:56:38,821 --> 00:56:41,450
a little cops talking on the
loudspeaker. He goes, you know, uh,

1047
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:44,710
get off at the next exit. And that got us
onto the one 10. Now we're on, we're on,

1048
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:47,680
we're on our way to the break improv.
It's now on the one 10.

1049
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:49,970
We had to drive that quarter of a
mile to get to the next fucking ice.

1050
00:56:49,971 --> 00:56:52,750
When we get off, we literally like five
miles away from where the fuck we were.

1051
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:57,910
We pull off and for some reason he
has a stop under the fucking overpass.

1052
00:56:58,330 --> 00:57:00,850
Right? So I don't know what
we're underneath the thing.

1053
00:57:01,390 --> 00:57:05,260
And Todd's been silly all week. Never seen
any anchor. Now first time seeing him,

1054
00:57:05,261 --> 00:57:06,700
like he's looking angry,
right?

1055
00:57:06,701 --> 00:57:11,050
And this baby face cop comes walking up
and he didn't, Todd doesn't give a fuck.

1056
00:57:11,051 --> 00:57:14,670
Puts the window down as the
cop comes walking up, licensed,
had ready. Good. Yeah.

1057
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:17,560
What do you say,
dude?

1058
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:22,480
We just start fucking bursting
out laughing and the cop
stood there and he kind

1059
00:57:22,481 --> 00:57:24,240
of looked her,
I guess he watched comedy central.

1060
00:57:24,241 --> 00:57:27,570
So you recognize someone in the car
and then he recognized Todd and then he

1061
00:57:27,571 --> 00:57:30,900
literally got on his fucking heels
like, Oh shit, you guys are comics.

1062
00:57:30,901 --> 00:57:34,080
And we just started laughing and
he actually let us go. You know,

1063
00:57:34,110 --> 00:57:36,240
I don't want to tell too much more
because he end up being like a really good

1064
00:57:36,241 --> 00:57:39,330
shit about it and I don't get the
guy in trouble. And uh, you know, uh,

1065
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:40,313
but whatever.

1066
00:57:40,450 --> 00:57:42,640
Well he didn't find the heroin in
the truck is what you're saying.

1067
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:47,710
Maybe a few weeks later somebody you know,

1068
00:57:47,711 --> 00:57:51,490
had a fucking moving violation and maybe
he did something to make it go away.

1069
00:57:51,491 --> 00:57:52,324
He was a good shit.

1070
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:55,150
Oh, right on. Oh, there's
nothing like good cops.

1071
00:57:55,550 --> 00:58:00,550
Well thank God he was a good guy because
even if the guy was like a fucking old

1072
00:58:00,621 --> 00:58:01,430
school,

1073
00:58:01,430 --> 00:58:05,110
I'm going to shoot you and plan a gun
on you taught that t rex still would've

1074
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:06,350
said the same shit.
Well

1075
00:58:06,350 --> 00:58:10,340
those say some. That's the problem
in Los Angeles on the west coast.

1076
00:58:10,341 --> 00:58:14,150
San Francisco has got some old school
city cops and they're cool and they let me

1077
00:58:14,151 --> 00:58:17,220
off the hook on a couple of
Duis. But I mean like, oh,

1078
00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:21,590
Pittsburgh cops were the best for
Duis. Just like, yeah, go home.

1079
00:58:21,591 --> 00:58:25,910
Like y'all right, good. Get outta here.
I mean, there's not black or white,

1080
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:29,240
old school. City cops are the
best, cause they don't give a shit.

1081
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:31,610
They've dealt with everything.
So he's like the young,

1082
00:58:31,730 --> 00:58:32,810
like straight out of the academy.

1083
00:58:32,811 --> 00:58:36,730
We were in Desert Storm Republican
kids or need or collar or, or, or, or,

1084
00:58:36,731 --> 00:58:40,040
or the broads. They're the worst
cops. But the old school man,

1085
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:43,340
they don't give a shit.
They're over. I mean, I mean,

1086
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:44,990
the worst was the one time I just,

1087
00:58:45,050 --> 00:58:47,690
we just did the party in her
ass off in New York City.

1088
00:58:47,930 --> 00:58:51,530
I'm coming back out in New York. I'm
like interstate 80 or two 80, whatever,

1089
00:58:51,531 --> 00:58:55,730
going through jersey, they get to
Pennsylvania. And um, you know,

1090
00:58:55,731 --> 00:58:56,720
when you're just in that morning,

1091
00:58:56,721 --> 00:58:59,780
the sun comes up and you're still
just gagged and just like drunk.

1092
00:58:59,781 --> 00:59:02,240
And I was like 10 lanes of traffic.

1093
00:59:02,270 --> 00:59:05,180
I didn't know I was
actually in the 11th lane

1094
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:11,420
in the middle like I had, no, I wasn't
paying. I didn't know. And I'm like,

1095
00:59:11,421 --> 00:59:12,890
why is this cop just shitting?

1096
00:59:12,950 --> 00:59:16,910
It stopped in the middle of the freeway
here it was the center lane. What we win,

1097
00:59:16,911 --> 00:59:19,640
like the breakdown lane, like I
was in the middle, like whatever.

1098
00:59:19,641 --> 00:59:21,770
It's like right next to the wall
being like the mediums? Yeah,

1099
00:59:21,771 --> 00:59:25,780
the median strip lane. Yeah, the that
lane. It's not grass. It is pain but no,

1100
00:59:25,810 --> 00:59:28,580
it's paved. Yeah. I'm thinking like
what's a cop doing sitting there.

1101
00:59:28,850 --> 00:59:30,900
So then I pull over and I'm like,
hi,

1102
00:59:30,910 --> 00:59:35,660
swerve out of the way is he drived Uber
pulls you over for pulls me over and at

1103
00:59:35,661 --> 00:59:36,500
the time my card,

1104
00:59:36,530 --> 00:59:41,260
my window didn't work so I had so like
I went to open the door to get the,

1105
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:43,570
if I kicked it in theirs there was like,

1106
00:59:43,630 --> 00:59:46,160
I think when they trade the car in
the boot print of the New Jersey state

1107
00:59:46,161 --> 00:59:50,330
trooper, we still in the car here.
It was his first Monday back.

1108
00:59:50,331 --> 00:59:54,770
He'd been hit by a drunk driver.
He was out eight months. Oh No.

1109
00:59:55,010 --> 00:59:57,860
But it was so early in the morning
on a Monday morning and rush hour.

1110
00:59:57,861 --> 01:00:02,040
He just couldn't believe
I was drunk. Yeah. He,

1111
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:06,860
he's just like, what's wrong with you?
Oh my God, you need to see as a, as a,

1112
01:00:06,861 --> 01:00:09,740
you know, strung out. And he's like,
or whatever. I said, he's like, oh,

1113
01:00:09,741 --> 01:00:11,840
you need to know.
I luckily had the Pennsylvania,

1114
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:14,330
nothing like out of state plates.
Like I'm the asshole.

1115
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:18,110
They don't have this stuff in our state.

1116
01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:22,220
I didn't know you couldn't drive on
the fucking medium strip. Pennsylvania

1117
01:00:22,430 --> 01:00:25,730
legal really got three lanes. You're like
a big city officer. I don't really know.

1118
01:00:25,790 --> 01:00:26,190
But that's,

1119
01:00:26,190 --> 01:00:28,830
that's why I don't drink and drive ever
anymore because I've been pulled up.

1120
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:29,960
I got literally got off.

1121
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:32,700
That's why not. Cause you don't want to
kill somebody because you don't want to.

1122
01:00:32,710 --> 01:00:35,190
Well, I mean, I don't, I
don't want to waste 10 grand.

1123
01:00:39,890 --> 01:00:44,780
That should be the thing. How much
of that last shot cost me 10 grand?

1124
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:47,560
I mean, obviously I don't
want to hurt anybody, but, uh,

1125
01:00:47,970 --> 01:00:52,440
for that shit and 89, December of
89 it was, it was a duty as a layup.

1126
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:55,260
It was a layup. I was so fucking
drunk. I couldn't even get my shit.

1127
01:00:55,290 --> 01:00:58,230
I wasn't even nervous. That's how drunk
I was. I was like, ah, you got me.

1128
01:00:58,290 --> 01:01:01,310
But that's, that's just stumbled
through the, I blew a one nine mm.

1129
01:01:02,030 --> 01:01:05,340
That's the problem. They had the two
problem nowadays though, it's like, yeah,

1130
01:01:05,341 --> 01:01:07,370
you know, if you're that
fucked up. And like I said,

1131
01:01:07,371 --> 01:01:12,230
I was like five or six times out of my
mind and then each time I left the hook,

1132
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:16,040
that's why I was like, you know
what? That's it. I can't do it.

1133
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:17,910
Right, right. Did you ever
get busted for it or no?

1134
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:21,380
No. I was always, I always like knew
the cop or that my boss knew the cop.

1135
01:01:21,381 --> 01:01:23,110
It was always in Pittsburgh.
In Pittsburgh,

1136
01:01:23,111 --> 01:01:26,410
it was five times legitimately
like just off the hook. Like,

1137
01:01:26,690 --> 01:01:29,220
ah, Yay. I know you are blah, blah, blah

1138
01:01:29,470 --> 01:01:31,210
friends, friends. You
know. One time I was,

1139
01:01:31,330 --> 01:01:34,060
I was coming home from a Christmas party.
I was working in this warehouse.

1140
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:38,740
We were under age and me and this other
guy, sarge was his nickname. We got,

1141
01:01:38,770 --> 01:01:42,550
we got absolutely fucking hammered and
we were driving his mother's like Pontiac

1142
01:01:42,551 --> 01:01:45,010
grand am you remember
those things in the 80s.

1143
01:01:45,011 --> 01:01:47,850
So what they look like with that
plastic shit, they're like side,

1144
01:01:48,010 --> 01:01:52,270
they were like this Chevy celebrity.
Yeah. Except for pawn. Yeah. By Pontiac.

1145
01:01:52,271 --> 01:01:55,550
Exactly. Yeah. So we were driving right
through the center of town and uh,

1146
01:01:55,570 --> 01:01:57,320
there was this jeep sitting at the red,

1147
01:01:57,340 --> 01:02:00,550
old schooled CJ seven when they made him
like out of fucking steel and the guys

1148
01:02:00,551 --> 01:02:04,000
stopped at the red light. I got
a beer between my legs, you know,

1149
01:02:04,001 --> 01:02:07,750
drinking and the other guy's fucking,
he's, we're hammered. We both see it,

1150
01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:10,300
we see it.
He starts to slow down.

1151
01:02:10,450 --> 01:02:13,620
He just didn't press the brakes hard
enough when we just sorta, yeah.

1152
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:16,300
Oh Bam. Slam into it. Right.

1153
01:02:16,740 --> 01:02:18,930
And this shit at all.
Like the brand new safety,

1154
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:21,990
it's to the edge and fucking drops
down under the fucking there.

1155
01:02:21,991 --> 01:02:26,160
Just the whole thing. Just crumpled
up. I've slammed my head off the visor.

1156
01:02:26,490 --> 01:02:29,820
Beer just goes all over me
covered in fucking beer.

1157
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:33,810
We're right in the center of town in my
hometown. Fucking cops have it and like,

1158
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:36,900
and, and it was so funny, the whole,
the fucking grand am was totaled.

1159
01:02:37,050 --> 01:02:39,900
There was like just a
scratch on the back bumper.

1160
01:02:39,901 --> 01:02:43,290
The CJ seven like I don't even think
the fucking guy that keep barely noticed

1161
01:02:43,291 --> 01:02:45,060
who was sitting in the GP got out.
Right.

1162
01:02:45,990 --> 01:02:48,750
Cops are there and like
fucking two seconds they show.

1163
01:02:48,751 --> 01:02:52,740
I'm literally covered in beer and the
cop, you know, standing there, he goes,

1164
01:02:52,741 --> 01:02:56,050
you guys been drinking like, Naw, Naw,
I'm a just get it all right there.

1165
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:59,040
Fucking beer shower. So we stand
down. He goes, yeah. He goes,

1166
01:02:59,041 --> 01:03:01,860
his car resale called get out
of the car. We're like, fine.

1167
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:04,080
So I'm standing there on the sidewalk,

1168
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:07,570
on the other side of the jeep with a
stooge sarge covered in, fuck, I'm, I'm,

1169
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:09,960
I'm so drenched in beer.
I'm actually cold.

1170
01:03:10,990 --> 01:03:15,780
It's like fucking like 30 degrees out
and I'm soaking wet and I'm sitting there

1171
01:03:15,810 --> 01:03:18,270
like an I already been through.
I know I hadn't been through my shit yet.

1172
01:03:18,630 --> 01:03:21,030
I ain't got arrested yet.
So for drinking and driving,

1173
01:03:21,031 --> 01:03:22,650
so I'm sitting there talking to sergeant,

1174
01:03:22,651 --> 01:03:26,690
I'm just going to give a fuck
they arrest y'all go to Cornell.

1175
01:03:26,691 --> 01:03:30,600
I under oath that don't give a fuck. I'll
say weren't drinking. I got you back.

1176
01:03:30,601 --> 01:03:32,700
I'm fucking lifeway.
He said all this shit.

1177
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:37,020
And then when I was done I turned and
faced the street and there was a cop

1178
01:03:37,021 --> 01:03:42,021
sitting in the cruiser staring right at
me when I thought heard the whole thing.

1179
01:03:43,650 --> 01:03:47,750
To this day, I can't believe we, he
didn't get fucking arrested. Yeah,

1180
01:03:47,751 --> 01:03:50,760
that he didn't get fucking, I don't know
what happened. I have no fucking idea.

1181
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:54,630
I had the empty beer, there was beer
all over the windshield, all over me.

1182
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:57,480
Somehow we got out of it. He
didn't get, he didn't get busted.

1183
01:03:57,481 --> 01:04:02,481
I remember my dad picked me up and at
that point I was smart enough to shut the

1184
01:04:02,641 --> 01:04:06,750
fuck up and he picked me up. Dude. I
mean, I am like swaying in the wind,

1185
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:11,840
the car smashed and I get in the car just
covered in beer and he's just like a I

1186
01:04:12,811 --> 01:04:15,240
doing you all right. I was just
like, yeah, yeah, I'm good. I'm good.

1187
01:04:15,241 --> 01:04:16,080
I didn't say shit.

1188
01:04:16,081 --> 01:04:18,690
I think he wasn't mad at me cause I
wasn't driving and we just fucking drove

1189
01:04:18,691 --> 01:04:21,810
home. But yeah, but that was the 80s
everybody that that's what happen.

1190
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:26,360
They let you go are so cool about that
stuff in general. It's like, oh it was,

1191
01:04:26,361 --> 01:04:28,880
it wasn't my car. It wasn't like,
yeah, shit happens. Like who?

1192
01:04:28,881 --> 01:04:32,510
Like what dad hasn't been the passenger
in a drunk driving incident? No, my dad,

1193
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:35,920
my dad was in the navy and
he was in a Frat, so he has,

1194
01:04:36,070 --> 01:04:40,060
and he did that shit in the 60s so I
remember when I finally got busted for

1195
01:04:40,061 --> 01:04:43,810
drinking and driving, uh,
my dad was totally cool.

1196
01:04:43,930 --> 01:04:47,470
My mother was upset and that, that
was their dynamic, like little shit.

1197
01:04:47,710 --> 01:04:51,670
My Dad flipped out like Christ
fucking clean up your room,

1198
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:55,030
but big shit. You got arrested for
drinking and driving. He was just like,

1199
01:04:55,031 --> 01:04:57,070
you all right. All right, cool.
We'll fucking blah, blah, blah.

1200
01:04:57,220 --> 01:05:00,550
My mother was the opposite. She let the
little shit go and then the big stuff,

1201
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:02,610
I just remember, dude, I, I,

1202
01:05:02,620 --> 01:05:07,620
my dad woke me up like they bailed
me out of fucking jail and uh,

1203
01:05:09,390 --> 01:05:12,970
take, I'm still fucking hammered.
They fucking takes me home.

1204
01:05:12,971 --> 01:05:13,571
By the time I get home,

1205
01:05:13,571 --> 01:05:16,810
it's like fucking maybe like four
in the morning I go to sleep.

1206
01:05:16,990 --> 01:05:21,370
My Dad wakes me up at seven
in the morning. All right,
three fucking hours later.

1207
01:05:21,470 --> 01:05:26,200
I'm like, still just ham. I'm still going
up. That's how drunk I was. And he goes,

1208
01:05:26,220 --> 01:05:28,960
I think should go downstairs and uh,
tell your mother what you did.

1209
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:31,920
You know that old school shit.
So I fucking stumbled downstairs.

1210
01:05:31,940 --> 01:05:34,510
Mother already knows. Hammered
out of my mind. I'm like,

1211
01:05:36,020 --> 01:05:39,070
should I get a drive? And she had
this fucking look of pain on her face.

1212
01:05:39,170 --> 01:05:41,080
It was brutal.
It was fucking brutal.

1213
01:05:41,081 --> 01:05:44,820
Then I went back upstairs and I
probably slept til like two and a,

1214
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:48,630
I only got 45 days.
45 days is all you got back then.

1215
01:05:48,660 --> 01:05:52,000
Now it's like fucking 90 days or like six
months. We're not making light of this,

1216
01:05:52,001 --> 01:05:54,340
by the way. People, we realize
this is a serious crime, but

1217
01:05:54,460 --> 01:05:57,850
oh yeah, please take a cab. I mean,
that's what gets me about the,

1218
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:01,390
when these athletes, like there's nothing
I love better than being driven around.

1219
01:06:01,630 --> 01:06:04,120
I mean like me and now magical actually
have a thing like we wouldn't have,

1220
01:06:04,390 --> 01:06:08,480
we have a race in our careers and
obviously he's way ahead of the first one.

1221
01:06:08,490 --> 01:06:12,460
Do a drive going on the daily show and
one of the founders of this company,

1222
01:06:12,461 --> 01:06:16,810
the podcast company, the record company
that the CD salute is coming out on.

1223
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:19,800
Please, please. By the way,
everybody go on Amazon down.

1224
01:06:19,830 --> 01:06:21,060
Can they download it anywhere?

1225
01:06:21,140 --> 01:06:24,350
Yeah, they can download it from Amazon.
I believe in buy it from Amazon.

1226
01:06:24,710 --> 01:06:28,820
It's on everything. But iTunes,
literally everything. But I think, yeah,

1227
01:06:29,060 --> 01:06:31,940
and when Joe says,
these are his classic jokes,

1228
01:06:31,941 --> 01:06:36,941
like the first time I worked with you
met you was in the punchline in San

1229
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:38,930
Francisco. Molly had booked
you and she goes, you're gonna.

1230
01:06:38,931 --> 01:06:41,360
I think you're going to like this guy to
do it within five minutes. I was like,

1231
01:06:41,361 --> 01:06:43,850
not only do I love his bitch,
I fucking love this guy.

1232
01:06:44,210 --> 01:06:48,650
You would like every one IA jokes,
especially in San Francisco,

1233
01:06:48,651 --> 01:06:53,651
how liberal it is would
totally be offensive and
you'd feel the crowd pull back

1234
01:06:53,721 --> 01:06:58,070
and then you would just keep tagging the
punchline with even more offensive shit

1235
01:06:58,071 --> 01:07:02,660
and they just had to just give in. Like
this guy just doesn't give a fuck. It was,

1236
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:07,100
I just remember that when you did about
the chicks sucking Dick for something.

1237
01:07:07,580 --> 01:07:10,660
What the hell was that when you would
run from the side of the stage going, oh,

1238
01:07:11,410 --> 01:07:15,220
oh, that's sucking a dick. The
difference between La and San Francisco.

1239
01:07:17,530 --> 01:07:18,760
That's my differences.

1240
01:07:22,340 --> 01:07:22,610
It was

1241
01:07:22,610 --> 01:07:27,610
so loud and it was so fucking graphic
and everybody was just like pulling back

1242
01:07:28,251 --> 01:07:29,600
and you just kept doing it.

1243
01:07:29,601 --> 01:07:33,740
Running from side to side miming sucking
a dick to get your fucking career going

1244
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:37,670
and it was just, it was so fucking over
the top. It was, it was awesome, man.

1245
01:07:37,671 --> 01:07:38,151
It was awesome.

1246
01:07:38,151 --> 01:07:41,210
So I really hope that people are going
to do the right thing and you know,

1247
01:07:41,211 --> 01:07:44,960
something like, and, and speaking of
doing the right thing, dude, uh, we, uh,

1248
01:07:44,980 --> 01:07:49,100
me and some of my friends,
we put together, uh, a
benefit for the lake. Great.

1249
01:07:49,101 --> 01:07:53,270
Patrice O'Neal in New York City
tickets went on sale on a Thursday.

1250
01:07:53,450 --> 01:07:55,880
And I know a lot of my podcast listeners
are going to give me shit for not

1251
01:07:55,881 --> 01:07:58,940
announcing it on Monday, but there's
a reason why I wait until Thursday.

1252
01:07:58,941 --> 01:08:02,900
Thursday was the one year
anniversary of Patrice is death.

1253
01:08:03,230 --> 01:08:06,650
And I just feel like the stuff
that opie and Anthony did for him,

1254
01:08:06,651 --> 01:08:11,240
like they just had like this just hours
and hours of stuff of Patrice and this

1255
01:08:11,241 --> 01:08:14,830
show is ridiculously amazing.
Was that

1256
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:16,830
the benefits show? Oh,
the shell that we got to,

1257
01:08:16,831 --> 01:08:21,600
we're doing that show could be held in
the astrodome. Yeah. Is that good? I mean,

1258
01:08:21,601 --> 01:08:22,434
it's really,

1259
01:08:22,450 --> 01:08:26,690
so it's sold out. It's
sold out in 24 hours. And,

1260
01:08:26,691 --> 01:08:28,400
um,
you know,

1261
01:08:28,430 --> 01:08:31,600
I was able to tell Patrice has mom and
it's the happiest I've heard of since all

1262
01:08:31,610 --> 01:08:34,700
this whole fucking awful scenario started.
So I want to thank everybody,

1263
01:08:34,940 --> 01:08:38,750
Ona fans and everybody who saw it on
Twitter who went and bought tickets. Uh,

1264
01:08:39,110 --> 01:08:42,410
you really fucking did a great thing by
buying those tickets and it's going to

1265
01:08:42,411 --> 01:08:47,270
be a fucking awesome
show. So, um, anyways, um,

1266
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:51,380
I don't know where the fuck to go
with that. So do another solid here.

1267
01:08:51,830 --> 01:08:54,310
I know I didn't bring it up
about the own Neil tickets.

1268
01:08:54,311 --> 01:08:56,760
So if you want to fucking
do with solid Joey,

1269
01:08:56,780 --> 01:09:01,640
be salute from the all
things comedy network. Do.

1270
01:09:01,641 --> 01:09:03,860
We're an hour and seven.
This has been fucking effortless.

1271
01:09:03,861 --> 01:09:04,860
You've been a great fucking

1272
01:09:04,940 --> 01:09:06,950
yes. Thank you so much for me. Like hours.

1273
01:09:07,190 --> 01:09:09,200
I forgot I was holding
the microphone actually.

1274
01:09:09,201 --> 01:09:12,080
It's like we're so used to a bullshitting.

1275
01:09:12,190 --> 01:09:16,870
Well, let's talk fucking Rosebell. Ah,
well, uh, what do you think Stanford,

1276
01:09:16,871 --> 01:09:19,720
Wisconsin. I was working with
Nate Kraig last night. Uh,

1277
01:09:19,780 --> 01:09:22,780
one of the guys you played hockey
with these openings out there. He was,

1278
01:09:22,781 --> 01:09:24,880
he was saying Wisconsin
stinks. He's like, we stink.

1279
01:09:24,950 --> 01:09:29,390
Oh one like a thousand. I mean, you
know, honestly about the Rose Bowl,

1280
01:09:29,420 --> 01:09:31,910
the least the most,
the thing I hate,

1281
01:09:31,940 --> 01:09:35,780
the thing I liked the least about
the rose bowls, the game, I actually,

1282
01:09:35,781 --> 01:09:39,740
it's like a drag. Oh, there's
going to be a game. Oh, you know,

1283
01:09:39,741 --> 01:09:43,760
I mean it's like he's so much fun in the
parking lot. I'm telling you, it's the,

1284
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:46,540
by the way,
people is a fucking golf course.

1285
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:49,540
You owe it to yourself at
some point in your life.

1286
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:51,460
If you've ever wanted
to go to the Rose Bowl,

1287
01:09:51,461 --> 01:09:53,980
I'm telling you the tailgate
is better and do it up.

1288
01:09:54,820 --> 01:09:56,410
Bring somebody who knows how to cook,

1289
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:59,890
bring a bunch of booze and you just
sitting there. It, dude, it's, it's,

1290
01:10:00,010 --> 01:10:02,590
it's the greatest fucking
way ever to start the year.

1291
01:10:02,770 --> 01:10:06,250
All those years of doing stand up and
going on stage where they gave the

1292
01:10:06,251 --> 01:10:10,930
noisemakers out to the crowd before you
go up and absolute hell and then like

1293
01:10:10,931 --> 01:10:15,100
the fucking clock strikes, whatever.
And you got to do the countdown. Okay,

1294
01:10:15,101 --> 01:10:19,840
you fucking an animal's ten nine all
those years of doing that shit and just,

1295
01:10:19,841 --> 01:10:22,510
I don't even know how the fuck we ended
up talking about it. We just bought it.

1296
01:10:22,511 --> 01:10:23,340
That's the greatest.

1297
01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:24,060
We went to the,

1298
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:28,170
we went to that amazing Tennessee Ucla
game when Tennessee was up like 20 to

1299
01:10:28,171 --> 01:10:31,140
nothing, and we're like, we could leave
at halftime. This game's over. We stayed,

1300
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:34,230
Ucla made the comeback and we were like,
we gotta go to the Rose Bowl.

1301
01:10:34,231 --> 01:10:35,740
This place is amazing.
Right.

1302
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:38,310
And then we had the ultimate
experience of the first year.

1303
01:10:38,311 --> 01:10:39,570
Second year we brought along Jason.

1304
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:42,360
Jason had showed up and if
you don't know Jason Law had,

1305
01:10:42,361 --> 01:10:46,910
unfortunately he's not the trademark
batting stance guy he got, he's like,

1306
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:49,380
it's like someone stole the formula
and then he got screwed out of it.

1307
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:53,730
But law head can do the big
red machine batting stances.

1308
01:10:54,060 --> 01:10:57,300
Reggie Jackson,
he won't let me post the Reggie Jazz.

1309
01:10:57,350 --> 01:11:00,910
He said he was out of shape
when he did it. Oh he it.

1310
01:11:01,180 --> 01:11:04,840
His debt. Reggie Jackson thing. He
does this Reggie Jackson. He goes,

1311
01:11:04,841 --> 01:11:05,950
when do you want to see them?

1312
01:11:06,250 --> 01:11:09,670
Do you want to see him when he's younger
or when he's older? He does the hall.

1313
01:11:09,730 --> 01:11:13,090
He does the home run. He hit in
the fucking all star game through.

1314
01:11:13,230 --> 01:11:16,170
He stands up there. Right. I'm standing
up now for people listening here.

1315
01:11:16,171 --> 01:11:17,580
Obviously he fucking,

1316
01:11:17,581 --> 01:11:21,690
when he does that thing where he brings
the bat up and then fucking adjust the

1317
01:11:21,691 --> 01:11:25,260
glasses through the second he did
that I was like, it's fucking Reggie.

1318
01:11:26,010 --> 01:11:27,660
The fact that you can do
the whole big red machine,

1319
01:11:27,661 --> 01:11:32,280
but to me my favorite is Pete Rose's. Uh,
when he, when he beat ty Cobb, he does,

1320
01:11:32,310 --> 01:11:36,850
he does him rounding
first base, the clap, the,

1321
01:11:36,851 --> 01:11:41,390
the handshake. It's anyway, he showed all
the way to crying on his son shoulders.

1322
01:11:41,391 --> 01:11:45,030
Yes he does. He does the whole
awkwardness at first base.

1323
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:46,710
And how great is it when he does like,

1324
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:51,270
he does like Pete Rose's stance stay where
he's sitting there crouching down and

1325
01:11:51,271 --> 01:11:54,360
he literally does. What about
when he did? He did Willie McGee,

1326
01:11:54,361 --> 01:11:57,750
he had his dying laughing, do a Willie
McGee and when he does the swing,

1327
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:01,800
we're on the fucking ground laughing
and then is classic quote. He goes,

1328
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:06,020
he loved the high fast ball,
didn't it? I don't know Jake diddy,

1329
01:12:06,050 --> 01:12:08,760
it looked just like him.
So, so he joined the crew.

1330
01:12:08,761 --> 01:12:10,500
Then we have Andrew during the Q does.
Yeah.

1331
01:12:10,530 --> 01:12:14,230
This is the fifth year universe
analysts. This is it. Yeah. Universally.

1332
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:16,110
So let's get plenty of thank you.

1333
01:12:16,111 --> 01:12:19,230
Think Stanford's is going to
come in and pound them. Uh,

1334
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:21,660
I think Sanford has a better team,
but you never know if they knew.

1335
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:23,250
They take like a month off.
It's like,

1336
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:26,550
it's like when you don't go on stage
for a month, you never really know.

1337
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:28,980
Even though you know your jokes,
you don't really,

1338
01:12:29,190 --> 01:12:33,000
Sanford Sanford should burn those
uniforms they played in last week.

1339
01:12:33,060 --> 01:12:37,080
That flat black helmet. That was
just fucking, oh, the black on black.

1340
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:40,170
Was that designed by Jay z?
It was terrible.

1341
01:12:40,420 --> 01:12:43,590
[inaudible] y'all because of Jay z did it.
It would have been the shit.

1342
01:12:43,591 --> 01:12:45,680
If you've seen the fucking
bar place center, you know,

1343
01:12:45,700 --> 01:12:48,600
knowing that this is a Celtics fan,
we've got 17 fucking banners.

1344
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:50,100
We just went down to home depot,

1345
01:12:50,101 --> 01:12:53,670
bought a bunch of cinder blocks and built
a fucking square dude Barclay Center.

1346
01:12:53,940 --> 01:12:57,150
The hardwood floor is supposed to
be like a brownstone in Brooklyn.

1347
01:12:57,151 --> 01:13:00,220
If you have a nice one in you redo
it right. And the luxury boxes,

1348
01:13:00,221 --> 01:13:02,600
I like mini fucking brown spots. I, I'm,

1349
01:13:02,601 --> 01:13:05,880
I'm just kinda night into the cities
with two teams. It just kind of like,

1350
01:13:05,881 --> 01:13:07,730
you know what? Move somewhere else. Give,

1351
01:13:07,731 --> 01:13:10,650
give somebody a team how you
can be a lifelong knick fan.

1352
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:14,850
Go through coming this close to win in
the championship with Pat Riley and the

1353
01:13:14,851 --> 01:13:15,130
finger.
