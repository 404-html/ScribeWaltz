1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:01,613
Yeah.

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:05,700
Hey, what's going on? Is Bill Burn?
It's time for the Thursday afternoon,

3
00:00:05,701 --> 00:00:09,270
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast.

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:13,050
And I am just checking in on you.

5
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:17,890
I'm not yelling it.
I'm in Houston right now and I have a,

6
00:00:17,891 --> 00:00:20,560
I got a show here in a couple
of hours and you know, Bill is,

7
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:25,120
I am in an advanced age at this point.
You know,

8
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,320
this is how old I am.

9
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:30,400
I now qualify for something
I'd never heard of before.

10
00:00:30,401 --> 00:00:35,050
It's called a p a r. P. I
don't know what it does.

11
00:00:35,051 --> 00:00:39,040
It's for old guys like me.
We're not 65 with 50.

12
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,460
And evidently I can now go to
the movies for eight bucks.

13
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:48,880
I'd probably get a free side of Metamucil,
you know,

14
00:00:48,881 --> 00:00:53,740
maybe a little Ben Tuba, Ben Gay
when I walk out, but I'm site. So,

15
00:00:53,741 --> 00:00:58,630
um, yeah, don't let anybody ever tell
you that getting old fucking sucks.

16
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:02,200
Okay. Yeah, it does. You body breaks
down. Eventually you take a dirt nap.

17
00:01:02,201 --> 00:01:04,300
Who's kidding? Who? You know,

18
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,270
you fucking surrounded by
loved ones as you lay in there,

19
00:01:09,271 --> 00:01:13,470
everybody's bottom lip quiver and you
just sit. No. Was I a good person?

20
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,280
Was I a good person?
Right. Yeah. That sucks.

21
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,840
But there's a lot of shit that
balances it off. All right.

22
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,840
$8 tickets to movies,
Bam

23
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:33,730
talking shit to somebody in their
twenties. You know, like you're a bad ass,

24
00:01:33,731 --> 00:01:35,740
but you're too old for
them to fuck with you.

25
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:40,360
So you look tough right in front
of your 50 year old wife. Boom.

26
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,160
MMM. I mean, that's pretty much
the extent of it. I haven't really,

27
00:01:47,161 --> 00:01:51,090
I know I'm new to this being
fucking over the hill here, uh,

28
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,270
but you know,
getting to wear a stupid hat,

29
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:59,970
right? One of those fucking old
man coats. I can't fuck man. It's,

30
00:01:59,971 --> 00:02:04,930
it's not like I can't wait, but
uh, I'm going to enjoy it. Um,

31
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,580
anyways, uh, before we get started, I
have a couple of things to promote. Oh,

32
00:02:09,581 --> 00:02:14,230
rough and rowdy brawl. August 5th, uh,

33
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:18,680
the people over there were nice
enough l pres, Dave Portnoy's,

34
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,690
uh, was nice enough to invite me back
and of course I jumped at the chance.

35
00:02:22,691 --> 00:02:26,100
I had such a great time the last
time when we were in fucking shallot.

36
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,660
Um,
it's so cool.

37
00:02:29,661 --> 00:02:34,220
And I will show up to these things as long
as they have me because, uh, it's, uh,

38
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:38,600
it's ridiculously fun. So it's
going to be in Youngstown, Ohio.

39
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,690
All right.
Kids come out of the womb swinging.

40
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:44,580
Okay.

41
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:48,580
All right. When the doctor hits
the baby on the ass in Youngstown,

42
00:02:48,581 --> 00:02:52,300
he's wearing headgear. That's all I'm
saying. And a mouthpiece. Um, all right.

43
00:02:52,301 --> 00:02:56,470
But we get it to tough. All
right. Who knows. I don't
know what their deal is. They,

44
00:02:56,471 --> 00:02:59,920
I don't know why they're so
tough there. I imagine, you know,

45
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:04,390
I think each little pool of people,
you know, starts off with a,

46
00:03:04,391 --> 00:03:08,050
with a couple of Adam and eve. Right.
And they bang and then whatever,

47
00:03:08,051 --> 00:03:11,560
if they're in the box, then
you get like Seattle, you know,

48
00:03:11,561 --> 00:03:14,220
but if they got hammered and they
beat the shit out of each other, yeah.

49
00:03:14,221 --> 00:03:15,100
You get Youngstown.

50
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,420
I haven't researched any of this,
but I don't know what all I know is,

51
00:03:19,421 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm not looking at anybody in the eye
when I get there, cause I don't, I don't,

52
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:26,200
I don't need to be clocked by
fucking Kelly. Pavlics third cousin.

53
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,200
Um, but anyways, so I,
I got to do a Gig. A,

54
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm going to do a gig right before I
get there. I'm going to be in Rochester,

55
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:35,880
New York.
All right.

56
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,910
I believe Home Steve Gadd childhood home.
I remember he was,

57
00:03:39,911 --> 00:03:43,210
I remember that I used to watch that
instructional DVD that he had a zillion

58
00:03:43,211 --> 00:03:47,920
times up close and he would talk about
how he got his hands together playing in

59
00:03:47,921 --> 00:03:52,480
the Rochester Crusaders.
It was a drum corps. Um,

60
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:56,860
I know crazy inflammation, but whatever
it's in my head, I got to get it out. Um,

61
00:03:56,861 --> 00:04:01,000
so that will be on August 4th, August
5th, I'll be driving down to Youngstown,

62
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:04,630
um,
for rough and rowdy.

63
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:08,950
So go to rough and rowdy
brawl.com to get your tickets,

64
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:13,690
um, to stream it. Whatever you got to
do, it's going to be fucking awesome.

65
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,460
And I've already seen
some of the highlights,

66
00:04:15,461 --> 00:04:17,680
so I should really be tweet some of the,
some of the guys,

67
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,020
they got some Pittsburgh,
Cleveland guys,

68
00:04:20,021 --> 00:04:25,021
no love lost there with all the Steelers
trophies and a Cleveland's baron shelf.

69
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:29,410
Cause for some reason they
don't count NFL titles,

70
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:34,660
which Cleveland one I think in 65 but
you know, as far as franchises go,

71
00:04:34,661 --> 00:04:39,550
that went out to fucking
Baltimore, Baltimore, Scarface,

72
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:44,110
reference any hoo. I'm here in a,

73
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:45,990
okay.

74
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:49,440
Houston, Texas. Oh my God. I thought it
was going to be fucking brutally hot.

75
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,100
I was like, I was almost ready
to call my agent and be like,

76
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,340
how many fucking years have
you been in this business?

77
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:03,120
Slash how many years have you been
booking me that you would book a bald,

78
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,950
redheaded male?

79
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,170
Yeah,

80
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:11,170
that qualifies for Arp in Houston,

81
00:05:11,181 --> 00:05:14,600
Texas in fucking July.
But um,

82
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,810
we were coming in for Atlanta and I was
looking out the window and all, all the,

83
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:21,920
you know, fields that I saw were
green. So I was like, all right,

84
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:25,250
maybe they getting some rain, I don't
know. But it's not that bad down here.

85
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:26,490
Okay.

86
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:31,200
The bad thing is, is I forgot
my show shoes. You know,

87
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:33,300
for those of you not in show business,

88
00:05:33,301 --> 00:05:36,450
you have your shoes that you
walk around in your shoes,

89
00:05:36,451 --> 00:05:41,010
your workout in or whatever. All right.
This is a very first world here, okay?

90
00:05:41,011 --> 00:05:44,760
For those, those of you listening
in lesser countries, okay?

91
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:48,750
We are so privileged here that we
have shoes for different events.

92
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:53,400
I need to work out, right? I'm
going to fucking wear these shoes.

93
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:59,120
I'm good to go. Uh, I don't know. Go
run some. Oh, I think I'll grab those.

94
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:02,540
And then you got to put on a
show and dance like a monkey.

95
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,930
You have these other fucking shows and I
know other people, other towns, you know,

96
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,800
uh, countries I should say. You know,
you've got one pair of shoes if you lucky,

97
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:10,843
right?

98
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:15,620
You and 18 other people jump on a fucking
moped with 37 boxes and somehow you

99
00:06:15,621 --> 00:06:18,680
don't tip over. You go down the street
making fucking Instagram videos.

100
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:23,720
I see out there, I see out there all
the time. I don't know how you do it.

101
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,850
Is it like young style where
you just grow up fighting?

102
00:06:27,851 --> 00:06:32,851
You guys just grow up fucking stack
and shit up until it makes no sense and

103
00:06:33,551 --> 00:06:34,860
somehow they stay upright.

104
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:39,160
Everybody always watches fucking evil
Knievel jumping over the buses with a,

105
00:06:39,161 --> 00:06:44,080
with a motorcycle that probably weighed
like four to 500,000 fucking pounds.

106
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:49,300
You know, as great as that is,
as impressive as it is, you know,

107
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,660
to drive down the street with
all your personal belongings,

108
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:55,270
your wife and all of your kids.

109
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:56,310
Okay.

110
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:00,720
With that much to lose. I don't think
evil Knievel can touch that, you know,

111
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,620
cause if he wiped out,
he died. That was it.

112
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:10,070
He didn't lose fucking everything
and all his clothes. All right,

113
00:07:10,071 --> 00:07:15,070
so that's one to grow on. Next
time they say evil Knievel is, is,

114
00:07:15,071 --> 00:07:18,740
is the grandfather of
fucking, uh, uh, the x games.

115
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:22,670
All right? You know, there's
always somebody else.
Everybody talks about Edison.

116
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:27,500
There's always a Tesla. I'm
sorry, what do you want from me?

117
00:07:27,501 --> 00:07:31,610
I got to fill up a fucking half hour here
and wait for my salad with the protein

118
00:07:31,611 --> 00:07:33,790
coming.
Um,

119
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:37,160
I've been doing real well with the whole
eating and everything and I actually

120
00:07:37,161 --> 00:07:39,260
got in contact with a nutritionist.

121
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:43,420
I took a long pause there for
all you guys would be like,

122
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:46,630
Oh gee you are you are you going
to do next? You get to get botox,

123
00:07:46,631 --> 00:07:48,800
you fucking freckled can't.
Huh?

124
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:53,260
You going to find some ginger cat and
skin it and put the fucking hair on top of

125
00:07:53,261 --> 00:07:54,670
your head?
Well maybe I will.

126
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:01,100
That makes me feel better about myself.
Fuck that cat

127
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,690
never been a cat person.
Right.

128
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,890
You know why they have such attitudes
is because they were allowed to shit in

129
00:08:08,891 --> 00:08:12,370
the house and then they think you're on
the same level and then they're faster

130
00:08:12,371 --> 00:08:15,820
than you and then it's over.
Then you can, you know,

131
00:08:15,821 --> 00:08:19,510
you can instill like fucking martial
law with the water spray bottle.

132
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:22,150
You don't want to fucking do that.
Although I would enjoy doing that.

133
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:25,480
I would actually, you know, if I wasn't
in this business I would do that as a job.

134
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:26,940
Okay.

135
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,190
Um, cause I don't like
cats. I respect him.

136
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:30,710
Okay.

137
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:31,071
I do.

138
00:08:31,071 --> 00:08:35,090
But I would get an a lot of enjoyment
spraying water at cats that jump on the

139
00:08:35,091 --> 00:08:39,850
back of couches. Is that actually
a career? Can you do that?

140
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,220
Is that how my life's going to end?
Wait a minute.

141
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:48,240
Is that what's going to happen? Me,
I'm going to die alone with like a cat,

142
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,760
you know,
have a cigar,

143
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:55,170
a little glass of fucking
whiskey or something and
I'll just be sitting there in

144
00:08:55,171 --> 00:08:58,920
my rocking chair and I have all these,
all these fucking cats.

145
00:08:58,921 --> 00:09:03,120
So that'll be like my fucking
playstation 19 right. Cause I, you know,

146
00:09:03,121 --> 00:09:04,290
I wouldn't have saved my money.

147
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:08,790
I'll have all these fucking cats and
then I'll just be spraying and I'm just

148
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:13,740
cackling laughing to like Keel over
like Brando in fucking the Godfather.

149
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,640
Jesus built you. Really? But I know,
I don't know what it is. You know,

150
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:20,640
I was doing so well with my
anger and just, I just fucking,

151
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:23,700
I just been losing it lately.
Fucking losing it.

152
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,620
I Dunno. I think I need to let
it out. It's Kinda like booze.

153
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,580
It's like if I don't do
it then it just builds up.

154
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:36,660
I went online yesterday looking up
like what do you, what you call that a,

155
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,220
it's not a fifth of Jack down
since it's the smaller ones.

156
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:43,110
The little brother to that one.
That's always been my favorite.

157
00:09:43,111 --> 00:09:46,770
If you just going to get fucking hammered,
he'd get that sides of it. Right.

158
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:51,090
I was just talking to Nate Craig, who's,
who's going to be with me this weekend,

159
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,050
crushing it in front of me. I
was saying, I liked that size.

160
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,900
You're poured over on the rocks.
You don't get like,

161
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:01,190
there's no guilt that
you're, you're, you're,

162
00:10:01,191 --> 00:10:04,560
you're wasting this booze that's been
in a barrel for fucking, I dunno,

163
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:08,760
since Nixon was in office and you
just sit in there getting shit faced,

164
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:12,120
watching a baseball game. It's,
you know, it's Jack Daniels, this,

165
00:10:12,121 --> 00:10:16,410
there's plenty of it. Right. And
then when you finish the bottle,

166
00:10:16,411 --> 00:10:18,210
you get like a sense of accomplishment.

167
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:22,590
So that's all like not boozing
does for me. It just makes me, uh,

168
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,570
makes me want to booze more.

169
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:30,150
And I think like not flipping
out is the same thing right now.

170
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,720
For those of you new to the podcast,
if you're questioning,

171
00:10:33,721 --> 00:10:38,610
did he just justify not controlling
his emotions and his drinking problem?

172
00:10:38,611 --> 00:10:42,630
Yes, I did. Yes I did. And
thank you for noticing.

173
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:47,610
Um,
I don't have fucking drinking problem.

174
00:10:47,611 --> 00:10:48,780
I drink just fine.

175
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,740
What I have is a drinking buddy problem.

176
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,030
Can't seem to get anybody
I can fucking drink with.

177
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:01,030
That ain't going to be sitting there
counting my fucking drinks. All right.

178
00:11:01,031 --> 00:11:04,380
And now we both went to public schools.
We can both count up to 20.

179
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:08,520
Yank pressing me. All right. You
wanna impress me by fucking round.

180
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,490
Quick reminded me that I drove tonight.

181
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:16,770
The fuck could fucking drive that car.
I'm my fucking sleep.

182
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:20,580
I'll back it on home.
We keep fucking talking.

183
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:26,220
That's my main or alcoholic
is a fucking redneck. Um,

184
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,590
anyways, oh, shout out to Chris
Hardwick. Congratulations.

185
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:35,010
They investigated and they found
out what most of us already knew.

186
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,000
You're a good guy.

187
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:41,310
And it was nice to see one of those
ones that seemed really sort of fucking

188
00:11:41,311 --> 00:11:46,311
frivolous be investigated thoroughly
according to CNN entertainment.

189
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:49,860
And you know, that's a, that that was,

190
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:53,930
that needed to fucking
happened because uh, you know,

191
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:57,410
that whole me too movement was supposed
to be for people that were like victims.

192
00:11:57,411 --> 00:12:01,910
It wasn't supposed to be, you
know, something to be used

193
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:07,930
to get back at somebody, you know, I don't
know. I shouldn't, I guess allegedly,

194
00:12:07,931 --> 00:12:09,250
whatever the fuck you're supposed to say.

195
00:12:09,251 --> 00:12:13,840
But it was nice to see that AMC
took the time to investigate it,

196
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,390
saw that nothing happened.
Yeah.

197
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:19,960
They were satisfied with it and they
brought the guy back. There you go.

198
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:25,240
There you go. I hope that
this is like, you know,

199
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,570
cause it kind of needed that. And then
there was the initial fucking, you know?

200
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:30,940
Yeah.

201
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,620
Because nobody listened to women.

202
00:12:32,621 --> 00:12:35,900
So then to just be there was just
this floodgate of fucking anger.

203
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,290
You had to ride through it and just,

204
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:41,510
you knew eventually somebody who didn't
do shit was going to go down. So it's,

205
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:45,190
it's, it's nice to see that they,
they rectified that situation.

206
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:50,080
Did I just get myself in trouble by
saying rectified? Is that too much?

207
00:12:50,081 --> 00:12:53,320
Like rectal? Then I just, I just
advocate something. You get me.

208
00:12:53,321 --> 00:12:57,450
This is just a strange time, you know? Um,

209
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,490
anyways, um, plowing ahead here.

210
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,413
MMM.

211
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:06,530
Yeah. So I forgot my God
damn show shoes. All right.

212
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:12,780
Um, uh, you know, I'm becoming Billy
minimalist but not, not on this level.

213
00:13:12,781 --> 00:13:17,280
Like I like to wear a nice pair of fucking
sneakers or shoes when I do my shows

214
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:21,600
and uh,
I don't have them what I have,

215
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:23,580
I just have my fucking workout sneakers.

216
00:13:23,581 --> 00:13:27,360
So I'm going to go out there looking sharp
from the ankles up and then I'm going

217
00:13:27,361 --> 00:13:29,360
to have these big clunky fucking,
yeah,

218
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:30,270
yeah.

219
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:35,010
50 year old white guy. My feet hurt
sometimes sneakers on. So, you know,

220
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,190
I give it about seven minutes
before somebody heckles me.

221
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:40,810
Well now that I've put it out there,

222
00:13:40,811 --> 00:13:42,520
someone's going to do it
and think they're original.

223
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:46,570
Or maybe it's their way of saying that
they listened to the podcast. I Dunno,

224
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:49,300
but I'm going to beat all of you cause
I'm just going to come out and address it.

225
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:51,683
MMM.

226
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,390
Anyways, you know what they
look like? They actually,

227
00:13:54,391 --> 00:13:55,950
they don't even look like men's sneakers.

228
00:13:55,951 --> 00:14:00,390
You know those fucking sneakers that like
old lady was old ladies with big feet

229
00:14:00,391 --> 00:14:01,224
get.

230
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:01,810
Yeah.

231
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:02,111
You know,

232
00:14:02,111 --> 00:14:05,800
you see him on the bus and they just
have like you see in the cute little old

233
00:14:05,801 --> 00:14:09,880
ladies and they just have these giant
fucking sneakers over their feet.

234
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:12,070
You know what I mean? That's
what they look like. No,

235
00:14:12,071 --> 00:14:15,010
they're not all white Reeboks
from the late eighties.

236
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,970
MMM. Anyway, so I am
really looking forward to,

237
00:14:23,971 --> 00:14:28,260
uh, I got two days here in Houston
and then I got one in Dallas. Uh,

238
00:14:28,261 --> 00:14:30,300
Houston's going to be fun.
Thousand is going to be awesome,

239
00:14:30,301 --> 00:14:33,720
but it's going to be a little sad.
Um,

240
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:37,470
because this is my first time going to
Dallas and with Vinnie Paul not being

241
00:14:37,471 --> 00:14:40,890
around anymore and he was a big comedy
fan and he was somebody that I always

242
00:14:40,891 --> 00:14:43,920
made sure I reached out to and I had a 50,

243
00:14:43,921 --> 00:14:47,660
50 chance cause he also lived in Vegas
that uh, he was going to be in town,

244
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:51,980
but um, yeah, going to suck. I was just

245
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:56,590
talking to a buddy of mine who
was hanging out with Vinny, um,

246
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:58,940
just a few days before he passed.

247
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:03,890
And he was saying that he used to always
quote Comedians' bits and he would

248
00:15:03,891 --> 00:15:08,280
always like mess him up. He was just the
funniest fucking guy ever, man. Goddammit.

249
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,361
Um,
anyway,

250
00:15:09,361 --> 00:15:14,361
so I'll be going up there and in my
mind will be dedicating my show to him.

251
00:15:15,201 --> 00:15:17,460
Saw that means I have to go hard,
but it's by the wave.

252
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,440
I don't know how I missed all of this
pant terra shit now that I'm like totally

253
00:15:21,441 --> 00:15:26,441
fucking into them and like trying to play
drums along to their amazing music and

254
00:15:27,711 --> 00:15:28,544
um,

255
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:29,990
yeah,

256
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:31,790
somebody sent me the uh,

257
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:37,850
the official video to unbroken,
which I never saw and what I love is they,

258
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:43,030
they spent enough time on Vinny that I
saw this shit that I was playing wrong as

259
00:15:44,081 --> 00:15:46,210
far as uh, oh, whatever. Just, you know,

260
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:50,830
the two open and crashes like I didn't
know he had like four crashes to what

261
00:15:50,831 --> 00:15:53,290
each side and then there was another part.

262
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:56,380
I thought he was playing an eighth
seems plain sixties pretty fucking cool.

263
00:15:56,381 --> 00:15:58,240
You don't get that a lot.
And music videos,

264
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:03,250
music videos usually barely shows
the drummer. And when they do,

265
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:07,810
they have the snare when he's hitting the
snare or he or she's hitting the snare.

266
00:16:07,811 --> 00:16:12,370
It's on the one in three and the bass,
the bass drums on two and four.

267
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:17,380
I cannot tell you how many fucking
times they do that. It's like,

268
00:16:17,381 --> 00:16:19,330
are you even listening
to the music right now?

269
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:20,620
Yeah.

270
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:23,110
You're in the crack of the
snare and you got him fucking,

271
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:27,880
you're lining up the video
and he's hitting the fucking
bass drum, if anything.

272
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,370
Okay.

273
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:32,670
And the music videos
genre drove me more nuts.

274
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:37,650
There wasn't anything, it was that, that
they would never fucking show the drama.

275
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:42,720
And when they did they, it was
just like they didn't give a fuck.

276
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,710
I think they just looked at the right
hand to just line up the music and that

277
00:16:46,711 --> 00:16:49,080
was it. And then it didn't
see what else we was fucking,

278
00:16:49,081 --> 00:16:53,550
the amount of times they
cut to like the singer,

279
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:57,630
he sing in some part and you see the
drummer playing the f of Phil that you

280
00:16:57,631 --> 00:17:02,010
don't even hear or you hear of Phil and
the guys just playing the beat. It, it's,

281
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:06,000
you know, all the fucking guitarist
does something. Oh Jesus Christ.

282
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:07,530
Okay.

283
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:11,270
Make sure we fucking line that up. Note
for note the singer, pay attention.

284
00:17:11,271 --> 00:17:14,330
I always like fuck the drummer.
So anyways,

285
00:17:14,331 --> 00:17:18,380
it's a great video because they did
not do that in that video. Sorry.

286
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:21,380
Look at me getting all worked
up over nothing. So anyways, um,

287
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:27,430
a friend of mine got me in touch with the
nutritionist and this is not code name

288
00:17:27,771 --> 00:17:32,180
for a drug dealer, so we just knock on
my door. Oh Jesus. Hang on a second.

289
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:34,963
Anyways,

290
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:37,120
so,
uh,

291
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:42,980
I got this fucking nutritionist cause
I wanna learn, I wanna learn how to eat

292
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,050
well.
Um,

293
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:48,790
you know what I mean? I don't want
to just be this guy like, hey,

294
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,810
I'm going to fucking cut this out

295
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:55,360
and I'm going to start fucking doing
it. You know, like I mentioned before,

296
00:17:55,361 --> 00:17:58,510
like how many,
like the amount of fat fucking vegans

297
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,360
I'm talking like back fat.

298
00:18:01,361 --> 00:18:03,670
I'm not just saying they got a
little pooch or something like that.

299
00:18:03,671 --> 00:18:04,830
I'm just talking about like,

300
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:05,803
okay,

301
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,030
you know, just looking at people,
like you just look at him like you,

302
00:18:09,031 --> 00:18:13,020
you look like you're not healthy.
And there'll be like, oh,

303
00:18:13,021 --> 00:18:15,720
I'm a vegetarian or I'm
fucking Vegan and all of that.

304
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:20,100
So when he was just like I mentioned, say
bring the fucking food trade over here,

305
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,233
there's like,

306
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:26,640
there's so much fucking like
misinformation. I don't know how to,

307
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:31,620
I don't know how to sift through it.
And I don't want to become a vegetarian,

308
00:18:31,621 --> 00:18:34,140
you know what I mean?
But I also fucking hate working out,

309
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:39,020
you know what I mean? So I would
like to fucking just eat smarter

310
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:44,660
is what I'm trying to do, you know?
Now that I'm on the fucking road,

311
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:49,880
this is what always gets me, you know,
I come in, I'm grumpy from a flight,

312
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:50,960
you know,

313
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,170
and you look at the salads and when
you're in a fucking bad mood and you're

314
00:18:54,171 --> 00:18:57,740
hungry, a salad never looks
like the right option, does it?

315
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,330
It never does. What do you do? You,

316
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:04,730
I'm gonna get a fucking burger and you're
trying to say, I want a side salad.

317
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:09,380
And then the lady's like,
do you want fries with that?
And in your head going, no,

318
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:09,960
Bill,

319
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,960
do it. And then he, yeah, yeah. Fuck it.

320
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,560
Gimme some Goddamn fries,

321
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,580
sir. You can order your food
without using that language.

322
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:22,820
I like to remind you all
you are in the bottle.

323
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:27,120
Yeah.
So I've been at Houston a thousand times,

324
00:19:27,121 --> 00:19:29,760
so what am I supposed to do now? Am I
going to go to the fucking Alamo again?

325
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,750
Going out of that God forsaken, I
never even been in it. You don't?

326
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:38,280
And I'm not talking about the
original Alamo in San Antonio.

327
00:19:38,281 --> 00:19:41,550
I'm talking about the
Houston Alamo. It's a, uh,

328
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:46,970
it's a mom and pop place.
You know, I don't know what
the fuck I'm talking about.

329
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,770
I just wanted us to say the
different cities, the wrong city,

330
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:52,260
so people could be all like,
oh, we should we each book

331
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:58,820
shaking my head. All right, let me
read some advertising here for Y'all.

334
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:08,040

Oh Shit. Yes. Oh, this is, this is
odd. Yeah. Okay. I remember this one.

336
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,890
This is a good one. Do you never heard
a digital eye strain? Chances are,

337
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:22,220
chances are you've experienced the

00:20:22,771 --> 00:20:25,050
dry eyes,
and migraines.

339
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,510
I'm turning the hose on your cat.

340
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:32,230
All of these things can happen when you
stare at a computer screen for too long.

341
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,350
Now you can profit with
your eyes. Nike, Oh, sorry.

fix stitch fix.

404
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:45,610
Stitch fix has reimagined the
way we we find and buy clothes.

405
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:48,590
First of all,
hats off to these guys.

406
00:24:48,591 --> 00:24:52,280
No Pun intended that they took the time
to figure out how to fix this boring

407
00:24:52,281 --> 00:24:56,840
problem. Um, we've reimagined
it. Like Disney convenience,

408
00:24:56,841 --> 00:24:59,480
stitch fix understands
that life gets busy.

409
00:24:59,481 --> 00:25:02,750
So just tell them your sizes and your
favorite types of clothes and how much you

410
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:06,920
want to spend and your personal stylists
will pick out your clothing for you

411
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,770
based on your preferences.
Try before buying.

412
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:13,700
If an item doesn't fit or you just don't
like it, no worries. Just send it back.

413
00:25:13,701 --> 00:25:17,210
Free of charge style. Some of
us have it, some of us don't.

414
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:21,050
But just because a sense of style seems
elusive for some doesn't mean it's

415
00:25:21,051 --> 00:25:23,690
impossible. Doing Tane to attain, sorry.

416
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:28,040
There's no time like the present to
discover that style you never knew you had

417
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:31,280
and you can with a little help
from our friends at stitch fix.

418
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,730
This is like when they would go into the
musical montage in any eighties movie

419
00:25:34,731 --> 00:25:37,010
when they would be like re
remaking the nerdy chick,

420
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:41,300
you know she wasn't good looking cause
she wore glasses and had our hair up.

421
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,970
Right. Then they'd let the hair
down and take the glasses off.

422
00:25:43,971 --> 00:25:46,820
It's like Oh my God Megan,
you're beautiful.

423

I Dunno anyways, but I'm, I'm uh,
I'm liking the way I look right now.

457
00:27:41,091 --> 00:27:44,390
I gave her a date, so I
would like to continue, uh,

458
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:48,650
with the nok booze and for a while I'm
not going to do with like the way I smoke

459
00:27:48,651 --> 00:27:53,360
cigars like a chimney. No, I'm going to
drink the way I smoke cigars, which is,

460
00:27:53,361 --> 00:27:55,960
you know, once every 10 minutes. No,

461
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,610
once every 10 to 14 days I have a cigar.

462
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,880
So I would like to get hammered or have
a couple of cocktails twice a month.

463
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:09,080
That's not bad. 24 times
a year, 24 times a year.

464
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:13,070
I just want to remind my liver
that this is not a game. Okay.

465
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:20,510
The pre season is over. All right. So
keep your head on a fucking swivel.

466
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,110
Stay on your God damn toes. Um, oh,

467
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:28,250
I got a night coming up. I'm going
to come off the wagon for one day.

468
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:29,180
Like what I would like to do,

469
00:28:29,181 --> 00:28:33,260
come off the wagon for one day in August
and then I am not going to drink again

470
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:37,340
until I'm going to a Michigan Wolverine
game this year at the big house.

471
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:38,950
Oh,

472
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:44,650
I have not been to a game there
since 1999 and the only guy,

473
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:47,650
there was some guy in Michigan I believe
when the Heisman and if for some reason

474
00:28:47,651 --> 00:28:49,300
I remember that Guy David Boston,

475
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:53,710
cause he had the last name Boston and
then he went to the chargers or something

476
00:28:53,711 --> 00:28:57,610
like that. I can't remember.
But uh, I went to the uh,

477
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:01,810
Michigan Ohio state game,
you know,

478
00:29:01,811 --> 00:29:04,780
the big fucking rivalry game at the
big house. That's a, that's a good one.

479
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:09,370
I've been to some good ones, man.
I've been to that one. I went to a,

480
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:15,380
what is it, the fucking,
uh, Texas versus Oklahoma.

481
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:16,670
I've been to that one.

482
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:18,330
Okay.

483
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:21,330
I haven't been to USC. Ucla, that's
fucked up. I don't hear for so long,

484
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:25,770
but the one I would love to go to,
I want to go to Alabama. Auburn.

485
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:29,190

those fucking sec games are the
best. Um, I shouldn't have said that.

490

Anomalous and everybody who actually you
big tangible can be be the BB. I get it.

491
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:49,750

to where the fuck you're from. All right,

494
00:29:56,861 --> 00:30:01,540
the music that we're going to be using
is Darren King. He did a cover of,

495
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:06,580
uh, is it Richie haven? Is that
his name? The guy from Woodstock.

496
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,480
He did a cover of his, uh, freedom. Um,

497
00:30:10,481 --> 00:30:15,481
if you guys want to know who this
artist is staring king and uh,

498
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:20,560
he's done everything. He used to play
drums with mute math. He plays guitar,

499
00:30:20,561 --> 00:30:22,540
he sings.
And from what I've heard,

500
00:30:22,541 --> 00:30:26,600
he's going to be maybe doing
a small tour coming up. Um,

501

00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:53,450
if you're a redhead and he'd go
down to the pool, like, yeah,

517
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:56,740

00:31:56,950 --> 00:32:00,550
look how white you are. You
know, like, I never noticed.

519
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:02,560
It's like I'm fucking around myself.

520
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,880
I've been around myself since the 60s,
the late sixties.

521
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:09,850
I know how white I am and if
I ever forget how white I am,

522
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:12,010
there's always somebody
there to remind me.

523
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:13,760
Yeah,

524
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:18,470
sorry. I don't know if you've noticed
your skin tone. What am I meditating?

525

526
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:25,070
c'mon in the poor. And like, I
don't want to go in the pool.

527
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,820
I don't want to go on the fucking
pool. You know? They're like, why? No,

528
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:31,750
why don't you want to go to the pool?
You know why? Because the fucking,

529
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:34,010
yeah,

530
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:38,190
look at, look at these people. Look
at them, look at them. And you're gay.

531
00:32:38,191 --> 00:32:41,360
You're getting you, you know,
would you take a bath with all,

532
00:32:41,361 --> 00:32:43,550
with any one of the
people that you see here,

533
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:48,020
these fucking just masses of human beings.

534
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:52,620
There's not enough chlorine and a fucking
pool to kill whatever the fuck they're

535
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,280
dragging in the pool. You know, it was
like, I finally end up going to the pool.

536
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:58,550
Then everybody made fun of how white
my fucking alabaster chest was,

537
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:02,600
a da that I had to stay in
the shade of the fucking, uh,

538
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,630
the lifeguard's chair,
you know,

539
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,510
you know, I had a show to
do, I'm being a professional.

540
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:13,550
I can't come out stage later,

541
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:18,250
half in the bag looking like
a lot of stuff right now.

542
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:22,970
I've got to do my little song and
dance later on that night. So anyway,

543
00:33:22,971 --> 00:33:26,840
so I ended up getting in the fucking pool
against what I wanted to do, you know?

544
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:28,210
Okay.

545
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:32,290
And then I get out of the
pool. First of all, for my age,

546
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,820
I am an absolutely
phenomenal top shelf shape.

547
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:41,380
All right? I got to tell you, the fucking,

548
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:46,860
just the deaf fuck the humanity
that I saw poolside in Las Vegas,

549
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:51,520
the fucking humanity

550
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,100
keyword manatee,

551
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:03,040
not the skep step on a Jim Gaffigan.

552
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,850
I just realized he used to use that
reference and I'm pretty sure he used it.

553
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:09,730
I can't remember how the fuck he used it,

554
00:34:09,731 --> 00:34:14,110
but if he used it to
describe a fat pale torso,

555
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:17,860
not really pale border, whatever the
fucking Shit I saw the side of the,

556
00:34:17,861 --> 00:34:22,000
he was dead on that.
Oh my God.

557
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:28,300
Is there anything worse than seeing
a tattoo come of age? You know?

558
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:29,930
Okay,

559
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:31,970
Jesus Christ, if you get
a tattoo, you better.

560
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:35,960
You better just make the mental decision
that you're going to pay 90 x for the

561
00:34:35,961 --> 00:34:38,330
rest of your fucking life.
Cause when you don't do it,

562
00:34:38,331 --> 00:34:41,530
I saw this guy down at the pool.
All right?

563
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:46,940
He had like not only the worst tattoo
she you've ever seen in your life,

564
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:50,600
like the worst placement.
You know what I mean?

565
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:53,990
Like you get one like on the side of
your arm up by your shoulder that looks

566
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:58,810
good, right on the bicep.
That looks good. You know Joe,

567
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,230
somebody got gets one right over there.

568
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:04,310
Voicebox like I don't give a fuck
what you have surrounding that.

569
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:07,940
That leads into that part of the,
of the, of the work or the piece,

570
00:35:07,941 --> 00:35:12,920
whatever they call it. It looks fucking
horrible. Leg Tattoos, horrific,

571
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:16,400
horrific.
So this fucking jerk off.

572
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:22,060
He has basically the exact sort of like
tribal thing that the rock has except he

573
00:35:22,791 --> 00:35:26,480
doesn't look tribal. He looks
like an accountant, you know,

574
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,360
and he doesn't work out.

575
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:33,920
So just imagine if the
rock was his pasty as I was

576
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:38,250
and it never worked down in his life,

577
00:35:38,251 --> 00:35:41,730
but it has that same tattoo that
starts at the elbow, goes up the arm,

578
00:35:41,731 --> 00:35:44,490
over the shoulder and
covers one whole peck.

579
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:49,410
But the way this guy had it done was
it didn't cover his whole packet,

580
00:35:49,411 --> 00:35:53,040
came swinging in and went right above his,
his man nipple.

581
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,340
So now all of the,
all of that is like colored in.

582
00:35:57,330 --> 00:36:00,720
So because of the pace genus of his torso,

583
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:03,930
your eye is just drawn
to his right nipple.

584
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,730
Is he standing in the fucking pool?

585
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:13,960
My neck was sore from shaking
my head at people. It was,

586
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:17,860
it was absolutely fucking
horrific, right? So, so anyways,

587
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:24,100
um, I go back up to the, uh, I go back
up to the hotel room, right? You know,

588
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:29,020
gotta make sure that I'm all shipshape
for my God damn show and I put on the

589
00:36:29,021 --> 00:36:32,470
news and what are they ended
up doing a story about,

590
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:37,380
they start doing a story
about the amount of uh,

591
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:41,800
fecal matter found in public pools

592
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:47,900
right after I just got out
of a God damn pool. You know,

593
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:51,350
and I know what people always think,
oh, stay away from where the kids are.

594
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:54,580
Stay away from the Kiddie Pool.
Right. Stay away from that.

595
00:36:54,581 --> 00:36:56,510
They always blame the fucking kids.
Will I,

596
00:36:56,511 --> 00:37:00,620
you know something after seeing
what I saw a poolside, you know,

597
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:01,970
there weren't a lot of kids in there,

598
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:07,310
but I guarantee you somebody's got a cola.
I know this is fucking disgusting,

599
00:37:07,311 --> 00:37:09,620
but people, you've,
you're basically bathing,

600
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:14,240
you know what's even more fucked
up is Vegas is just like, you know,

601
00:37:14,241 --> 00:37:18,890
people fly in from all over the world.
You're taking a fucking aids bath,

602
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:23,570
you know, with a shot of fucking, ah,
what the hell is that shit that came out.

603
00:37:23,571 --> 00:37:25,970
But it killed people so fast
that it just burned out.

604
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:30,590
Everybody just ran into the woods.
The fuck was that shit cold.

605
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:37,180
Ah, Christ. I can't
remember a bola. That's it.

606
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:41,470
With a shot of a Bulla or whatever.
Food poisoning.

607
00:37:41,471 --> 00:37:43,780
I don't know what it is.
A salmon, Ellis shower,

608
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:46,960
whatever the fuck you want to call it.
I'm done with public pools.

609
00:37:46,961 --> 00:37:50,200
The only pool that I will
ever swim in again is my pool.

610
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,450
If I ever get one or the pool of some
hot chick that I want to fucking bank

611
00:37:54,451 --> 00:37:57,520
cause I have needs permission.
That's the only way it's going to go down.

612
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:01,330
Other than that, you know, I'll
just go, I'll just go take a bath.

613
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:10,600
That way I'm out of the sun. You know,
I'll take a couple of vitamin E pills,

614
00:38:10,601 --> 00:38:14,110
whatever the fuck it is you get from
the sun. Other than skin cancer,

615
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,393
I'm done with it.

616
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:21,600
You know what America needs to implement
after years and years of calling the

617
00:38:21,701 --> 00:38:24,160
French people smelly.
You know,

618
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:28,090
that's Kinda like the thing when we went
over to France and saved their ass for

619
00:38:28,091 --> 00:38:32,370
the second time last century. Oh wait, did
we do it once? We did it one time, right?

620
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:35,830
I can't fucking remember.
So anyways,

621
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,470
we've always made fun of the
French father. They smell.

622
00:38:38,471 --> 00:38:42,490
If you ever watched a bugs bunny
growing up, man, you saw pepe Le Pew.

623
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:45,160
If you noticed he had a French accent.
You know,

624
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:48,160
that's the kind of Shit you couldn't get
away with today because of a political

625
00:38:48,161 --> 00:38:51,790
correctness. I guess they were basically
saying that you know, that they stuck.

626
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:57,150
But I'll tell you one thing that the
French have when it comes to hygiene over

627
00:38:57,881 --> 00:39:02,740
Americans. All right? Is
the buddy day. All right?

628
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:06,220
I can guarantee you if I ever go
swimming in a public pool again,

629
00:39:06,221 --> 00:39:11,221
it's going to be at Fred's
Ellis is a bunch of Americans.

630
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:16,700
I know. I've been over to England. I never
saw it, but day over there, you know,

631
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:22,610
but day is basically a car
wash for your asshole Ed. Uh,

632
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:28,040
you know, it leaves you feeling refreshed,
puts a fucking smile on your face.

633
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:32,090
And evidently in France, she's so fucking
happy. You forget to put on deodorant,

634
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,810
but I'll tell you right now, you can
jump in that pool. I bet the night,

635
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:36,950
but they're not talking
about that shit over there.

636
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:07,030
Hey, how are you? It's bill burr and it
is the Monday morning podcast from Monday,

637
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:10,750
July 26th,

638
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:15,010
2010 look at that hot
the last Monday in July,

639
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:19,540
another summer month flying by.
And once again there they are.

640
00:41:19,541 --> 00:41:23,380
The goddamn banker cuts just
staring you in the face,

641
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:25,370
sticking their hands out there.

642
00:41:25,371 --> 00:41:30,040
A little grubby fucking hands asking
for another pound of flesh as they do at

643
00:41:30,041 --> 00:41:30,940
the end of every month.

644
00:41:30,941 --> 00:41:34,640
Don't they actually talked to a buddy
mine who's outside the business and got to

645
00:41:34,641 --> 00:41:39,320
check the other day, right? And was,
you know, bitching about the taxes,

646
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:43,760
was talking about all the taxes taken
out. And he goes, thanks a lot Obama,

647
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:45,850
you know,

648
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:50,850
and then I got into a fucking argument
trying to get this dude to stop blaming

649
00:41:53,331 --> 00:41:55,040
the standing fucking president.

650
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,110
You got to get to the fucking guys
who pull, pull, put the dude in there.

651
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:05,070
Not even put the dude in there, but
can take the dude out. You know,

652
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:10,160
it doesn't fucking make a difference. I
remember I voted for Ron Paul. You know,

653
00:42:10,161 --> 00:42:14,000
I always vote for those guys who,
Ralph Nader's and all that,

654
00:42:14,001 --> 00:42:15,820
the Ross Perot's and
everybody always ever,

655
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:19,610
he always tells me it's a fucking
waste of a vote. Is it though?

656
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:24,230
You tell me one fucking thing different
that Obama's doing that McCain wouldn't

657
00:42:24,231 --> 00:42:27,530
be doing. I know there's little subtle
differences, you know, he's going to,

658
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:29,870
rather than giving it to the fucking rich,

659
00:42:29,871 --> 00:42:34,460
he's going to give it to the fucking poor.
You know, both their philosophy suck.

660
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:40,130
And now in bankers just keep
getting richer and fucking richer.

661
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:45,030
And it just, it just blows my mind.
You know, it's one thing I've,

662
00:42:45,031 --> 00:42:49,280
I've learned finally figured out over
all this shit, that whole rich guy,

663
00:42:49,281 --> 00:42:52,940
we'll give it to the rich and they'll
create jobs and it'll trickle down.

664
00:42:52,941 --> 00:42:55,860
The keyword is trickle and we're all going
to be sitting there with that tongues.

665
00:42:56,060 --> 00:43:00,080
Ah, Eh, trying to catch a
drop of fucking prosperity.

666
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:05,400
And then on the other side, if
you just give people shit, you,

667
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:09,950
you don't help them. They come back
the next day like a fucking cat,

668
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,250
you know, waiting for another
bowl of milk. It's like, no, dude,

669
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:17,030
I was trying to give you nourishment
so you could go fucking, you know,

670
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:20,000
have enough strength to go milk a cow
or whatever the fuck you supposed to do.

671
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,700
Oh, I didn't know. I thought
you were going to give a dog.

672
00:43:22,701 --> 00:43:27,260
This is where I get the free
milk from. All right, day.
I get the fuck out of here.

673
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:33,140
Fucking piece of shit. You
know, anybody got a, I've got a,

674
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:38,060
I've got a bomb for a friend always
asking for money. You ever do that?

675
00:43:38,061 --> 00:43:41,840
And you're doing well in your life and
you feel guilty and they get themselves

676
00:43:41,841 --> 00:43:46,370
into a jam. Man, I'm in
fucking jam, you know,

677
00:43:46,371 --> 00:43:47,750
and it's everybody's fucking fault.

678
00:43:47,751 --> 00:43:52,620
But theirs and their girls got 'em on the
outs and the cops fucking arrested. Um,

679
00:43:52,621 --> 00:43:56,270
and Eh, they're going to put
them in fucking jail. You know,

680
00:43:56,271 --> 00:43:57,680
or whatever's going to happen.

681
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:02,120
They're going to take the fucking car
and they need 500 bucks and you fucking

682
00:44:02,121 --> 00:44:05,270
give it to him. Right. And what do you do?

683
00:44:05,271 --> 00:44:09,700
They get out of that jam for fucking 10
minutes and what within a month they're

684
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:12,860
in. Another fucking jam or
they learned anything. No,

685
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:15,620
and a lot of times it's
an even worst predicament.

686
00:44:15,621 --> 00:44:18,710
I'm going to stop saying jam
like I'm in the fucking seventies

687
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:22,580
started off me doing the character.

688
00:44:22,581 --> 00:44:25,700
I'm in a jam and then I just
started saying it is me.

689
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:29,630
And I felt like fucking the dude who
drives the mystery machine on Scooby Doo.

690
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:32,060
I wouldn't say that he was too much

691
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:33,200
of a square.
Right.

692
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,110
Fucking the hot chicken,
the missionary position.

693
00:44:38,370 --> 00:44:42,630
Am I really doing Scooby Doo
jokes? Um, the fuck was his name.

694
00:44:42,631 --> 00:44:45,940
Was it Fred? This ascot. Okay.

695
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,990
That's all I'm saying, dude.
It's all fucking bullshit.

696
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:53,610
I believe there's plenty of fucking money
if these fucking banker assholes will

697
00:44:53,611 --> 00:44:58,260
stop taking all of it in
these corporations. I Dunno.
Does it, does it really cost?

698
00:44:58,970 --> 00:45:02,180
Well, it really costs like
fucking 40 bucks a tee shirt.

699
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:06,530
If you pay somebody a decent wage to
make it the really got to have some eight

700
00:45:06,531 --> 00:45:09,980
year old make $3 a fucking day.
You know?

701
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,860
Isn't there a a fucking middle ground?

702
00:45:15,290 --> 00:45:18,570
Yeah, I don't get it. I just
don't get it. I, I just refuse.

703
00:45:18,571 --> 00:45:22,040
I don't blame politicians anymore,
democrat or Republican.

704
00:45:22,041 --> 00:45:24,890
I just don't fucking blame him anymore.
It's an absolute,

705
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:27,260
it's a fucking shit storm.
And look at,

706
00:45:27,261 --> 00:45:29,900
look at a shitstorm Obama came
walking into, that's like, Yo,

707
00:45:29,901 --> 00:45:34,130
y'all hosting one of those hoarder shows
and you walk into the house and it's

708
00:45:34,131 --> 00:45:35,750
just piled high was shit.

709
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:41,070
Trillions of fucking things that
need to be thrown out. Right?

710
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:42,211
And then what?

711
00:45:42,211 --> 00:45:45,810
You give the guy 10 minutes to clean out
the fucking house and then after that

712
00:45:45,811 --> 00:45:48,330
it's his mass. Well, they'll
fucking mess you made

713
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:54,020
out of fucking though. I gotta I gotta
admit like politics is just like baseball.

714
00:45:54,021 --> 00:45:57,050
I stopped watching in June of last year,
you know,

715
00:45:57,051 --> 00:45:58,820
although I'm starting
to come around again,

716
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:02,500
I'm coming back around
to baseball and I'm, I'm,

717
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:06,610
I'm like in the nationals and I'm
liking the Pittsburgh pirates.

718
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:10,780
I'm coming back into the
fucking back door. All right,

719
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:16,860
going, I'm going down to tier three. I'm
bored shitless with Yankees, red sox.

720
00:46:16,861 --> 00:46:20,400
I gotta admit I'm fucking burned out.
Burned out with this shit.

721
00:46:20,401 --> 00:46:22,760
It's just like whatever.
We won the fucking world series.

722
00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:25,650
Then we want another one that's the
end of the movie. Roll the credits.

723
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,960
I got to fucking try to give a shit,

724
00:46:28,050 --> 00:46:31,530
act like I give a fuck
12 times a goddamn year.

725
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:38,160
Um, I don't know. Yeah. But I don't
watch politics either. Um, I just, uh,

726
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,910
and those, those political
fucking shows on TV, I just,

727
00:46:41,970 --> 00:46:44,510
I can't get into them because,
uh,

728
00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:49,630
there's nobody really taken the people
that I feel need to be taken to task.

729
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:50,830
And at the end of the day,

730
00:46:50,831 --> 00:46:55,670
the people I feel need to
be taken to task are, uh,

731
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:59,610
it's, it's all based on shit I
watched on youtube, you know,

732
00:46:59,611 --> 00:47:03,840
so who the fuck am I to bitch? So I just
tapped out. I just said, you know what?

733
00:47:03,841 --> 00:47:08,190
Fuck it. Fuck it. I'm
going to get myself a bear.

734
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:12,310
Okay. You know, maybe get a pistol.
Learn how to shoot the fucking thing.

735
00:47:12,850 --> 00:47:14,740
You know what a beer sounds
really good right now.

736
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,620
If I ever drank a beer
on the fucking podcast,

737
00:47:18,310 --> 00:47:21,220
I think I'm gonna think I'm
going to go fucking get one.

738
00:47:22,330 --> 00:47:24,250
Do I got time to go run and get it?
You know what?

739
00:47:24,251 --> 00:47:27,340
It's not one of those beers you can really
drink out of a fucking can you get a

740
00:47:27,341 --> 00:47:32,050
poured into a glass and I, you know
what? I have the ability to hit pause,

741
00:47:32,051 --> 00:47:36,940
don't I? I really do. Let me see if
I know how to do it here. Ah, Jesus.

742
00:47:36,941 --> 00:47:41,350
This is always tough. Do I hit
play? Do I hit record? Hit record.

743
00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:45,880
All right.
And with the magic of the pause button,

744
00:47:45,881 --> 00:47:49,740
I am back and I got to fucking
brew right in front of me. See,

745
00:47:49,830 --> 00:47:53,260
this is what I'm doing.
I don't give a shit anymore.

746
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:57,520
I gave a fuck and a all you end
up doing it. You just start.

747
00:47:57,550 --> 00:48:02,460
You just start yelling at people in bars.
That's all given a fuck get ya.

748
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:06,010
You know what are you gonna make a sign

749
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:12,710
in on some street corner honk.
If you give a fuck, that's,

750
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:17,620
that's going to stop the banks.
You can't do it. I quit. I give up.

751
00:48:17,650 --> 00:48:21,040
I don't give a shit.
Just tell me what to believe.

752
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:24,670
I don't fucking care anymore.
I want to get a gun though.

753
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:29,440
I really do stand on my fucking
porch waving it at people.

754
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:34,060
Just be that guy. We always knew he
was going to be a problem. I mean,

755
00:48:34,061 --> 00:48:38,410
you had a gun. I've got a gun too.
What? I'm responsible. I'll keep it in.

756
00:48:38,510 --> 00:48:42,640
I'll keeping him safe. That
way. If somebody breaks in,

757
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:46,420
uh, I go, can you wait a second?
I've never understood that. You know,

758
00:48:46,421 --> 00:48:49,660
it's like if you're going to
have a fucking gun, you know,

759
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:52,660
to really protect yourself,
don't you have to sleep with it.

760
00:48:52,661 --> 00:48:54,190
Like fucking Tony Soprano.

761
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:59,050
And the second to last episode on the
Soprano's when you thought this Tony

762
00:48:59,051 --> 00:49:04,050
Montana ending was going to happen
and then it didn't, I don't get this.

763
00:49:04,051 --> 00:49:07,240
You keep it in the gun safe and then you
keep the bullets in the trunk of your

764
00:49:07,241 --> 00:49:12,040
car, right? You keep the scope
up in the attic. You know,

765
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:19,030
as, as the intruder is chasing
you around your fucking house,

766
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:21,700
you grabbing different parts of the gun,
assembling it,

767
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:24,760
stick it under your fucking pillowcase.

768
00:49:24,761 --> 00:49:27,040
Like Beretta is not what
you're supposed to do.

769
00:49:29,410 --> 00:49:31,690
You know what?
I've never owned a nightstand in my life.

770
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:35,560
I'm going to get a gun too. This is a, I
should have done this on the 4th of July.

771
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:37,540
I'm doing a podcast.

772
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:40,200
I'm talking about getting a gun and
I'm drinking a fucking beer and I,

773
00:49:40,201 --> 00:49:41,110
one of those pussy ones.

774
00:49:41,111 --> 00:49:46,111
Either he's a fucking one
pint Boddington's pub Ale,

775
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:49,420
you know one of those ones,
you open it up and it's got that fucking,

776
00:49:49,421 --> 00:49:52,780
I don't know what it has in there. That
metal ball at rattles around you look in,

777
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:55,750
you can never find it.
They had no idea what it is,

778
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:59,860
but for some reason he never had the
curiosity enough to fucking gut the can to

779
00:49:59,861 --> 00:50:03,130
see what it looks like. I like the
mystery. I like the mystery of it.

780
00:50:04,270 --> 00:50:05,103
I don't know what it is.

781
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:08,410
Isn't it weird how a fucking beer
like quenches your thirst and then

782
00:50:08,411 --> 00:50:13,370
automatically makes you
thirsty again? Once the deal,
it, it cools. It's, Ooh, Ooh,

783
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:17,170
Ooh. Um, speaking of guns,

784
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:22,360
Oh, what'd you guys do? If I just got
absolutely shit faced on this podcast,

785
00:50:22,361 --> 00:50:24,730
I feel great and I wouldn't even
think that I had a drinking problem.

786
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:28,110
I can just keep hitting pause.
You guys wouldn't even

787
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:31,020
know and technically because I'm
talking to you. I'm not drinking alone.

788
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:32,613
All right?

789
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:37,110
Isn't that what George Thorogood one off
the fucking rails when he did that song,

790
00:50:37,111 --> 00:50:37,944
I drink alone.

791
00:50:38,670 --> 00:50:40,220
The adjunct can loon

792
00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:44,680
rarely and they started putting on the
weight and he's still wear those rattle

793
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:49,960
snake skin fucking pants with
matching top. You know, at
some point, I mean, dude,

794
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:54,010
I should fucking talk.
I should really talk with my fucking,

795
00:50:55,070 --> 00:50:58,850
my God damn ma round,
smooth white belly.

796
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:02,570
It's fucking beer at Goddamn quarter
to nine at night is not going to help

797
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:05,000
least it's hot as fuck in here.

798
00:51:05,001 --> 00:51:08,620
You know my old bastard fucking
neighbor downstairs is home.

799
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:14,100
You know, like I bring my voice down
because I don't need the bullshit.

800
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:18,870
I can't fucking wait in. I got a
new special coming out. All right,

801
00:51:18,871 --> 00:51:22,410
it's coming out in September
and I get a feel on this thing.

802
00:51:22,411 --> 00:51:26,630
It's going to fucking hit and it's going
to hit hard and I'm finally going to go

803
00:51:26,631 --> 00:51:31,631
out and buy a gun damn house out here and
a day I do when I load up that fucking

804
00:51:31,971 --> 00:51:34,820
you all right. You like that. Even
though I'm dreaming about buying a house,

805
00:51:34,821 --> 00:51:38,270
I'm still a broke ass hole and I have to
move my shit myself when I load up that

806
00:51:38,271 --> 00:51:40,580
you all okay?

807
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:44,990
And I bring that fucking tailgate
down one last time. All the way down.

808
00:51:44,991 --> 00:51:47,660
That little fucking Faggot,
he little bumper,

809
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:51,740
that's only an inch off the ground to
make it easier for pussies like me to load

810
00:51:51,741 --> 00:51:52,900
their bureau in there.

811
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:59,080
You know I'm going to ring his doorbell
and I'm going to get in his face and be

812
00:51:59,481 --> 00:52:03,420
like, listen old man. I don't know when.

813
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:07,160
I don't know how,
but I'm going to fucking get back.

814
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:10,430
I'm going to do something to you.
I don't know what the fuck I'm gonna I,

815
00:52:10,431 --> 00:52:13,100
you know I sound like I sound like
fucking jumping Jeff Farmer right now.

816
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:16,310
I'm coming at you full force.

817
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:22,250
You turn the tables on me
in the wrong way. Old Man.

818
00:52:23,930 --> 00:52:26,480
No, I don't know. I can, I can, I, you
know what, I don't do the revenge thing.

819
00:52:26,481 --> 00:52:29,840
I told you that guys a long time
ago. I don't do it. You know,

820
00:52:29,870 --> 00:52:32,360
if I wasn't so worried that
he'd have a heart attack,

821
00:52:32,361 --> 00:52:36,830
I really want to scare them one
day. Just do a fake sneeze, right

822
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:42,280
close to them, make them shit
his pants a little bit, you know,

823
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:47,290
take a Geritol shit and it's
fucking Dickies. Miserable bastard

824
00:52:48,850 --> 00:52:51,360
really is.
He's really the fucking ghost of a,

825
00:52:51,770 --> 00:52:55,010
was it future? Was that the one that
was a, I don't know what the fuck he is.

826
00:52:55,990 --> 00:52:58,360
All right, let's move on here. I
talked about getting a gun. It's on,

827
00:52:58,361 --> 00:53:00,620
and this is a thing too,
because I'm doing this podcast

828
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:05,420
so early in the week,
um,

829
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:10,430
you know, I, I actually, I went through
a bunch of old emails and you know,

830
00:53:10,431 --> 00:53:13,070
I get a ton of emails
from you guys and uh,

831
00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:15,320
and I know sometimes people get
upset when I don't read them.

832
00:53:15,321 --> 00:53:19,070
I just get a ton of emails, but I just
went back because it's only Thursday.

833
00:53:19,071 --> 00:53:21,690
So I didn't really have that
many current ones. And I, uh, I,

834
00:53:21,691 --> 00:53:26,691
I saw some gems that I missed and I
guess one week I was talking about the

835
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:30,120
amount of people that Stalin
had killed verse Hitler.

836
00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:32,580
And how come people
when they bring up evil,

837
00:53:32,581 --> 00:53:36,510
they don't talk more about
Yosef Stalin considering it,

838
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:40,770
it seems to me that he killed like
three times plus a little bit more.

839
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:46,100
I mean what, what, what exactly
are Hitler's, uh, exact numbers?

840
00:53:46,101 --> 00:53:49,950
Cause I know he says that they killed
600, 6 million, 600 and Jesus Christ,

841
00:53:50,250 --> 00:53:54,510
6 million Jewish people.
But I also know that he killed gaze.

842
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:59,340
He killed, uh, uh, I think he killed
blacks. If there's only blacks in Germany.

843
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:05,070
Um, maybe some Catholics,
I dunno, whatever.

844
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:08,010
Traders, people who helped out
Jewish people. I mean what,

845
00:54:08,050 --> 00:54:10,500
I mean did he get another
fucking million out of that?

846
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:13,350
I don't know what his exact number is,
but I'm pretty safe.

847
00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:17,580
It's pretty safe to say that it's
under 10 million. So I was saying like,

848
00:54:17,581 --> 00:54:20,790
you know, Joseph, Yosef, Stalin or where
the fuck you said, or you know, this,

849
00:54:20,791 --> 00:54:24,150
this son of a bitch killed like twice
as many of that if you give Hitler 10

850
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:28,800
million. All right. So that was basically
what I've referred on. So this game,

851
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:33,670
this game made a great point. He
actually wrote to me and he said, um,

852
00:54:34,110 --> 00:54:37,340
I ran across something I thought you
might find interesting. Uh, I know you're,

853
00:54:37,350 --> 00:54:41,100
how you talk about Hitler versus
Mussolini Versus Stalin and the number of

854
00:54:41,370 --> 00:54:43,720
deaths attributed to each one of them.
Well,

855
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:46,440
I don't think they actually
did much of the dirty work.

856
00:54:46,830 --> 00:54:51,000
They outsourced it to a Indian kids
who did it for half the price. Hahaha.

857
00:54:51,001 --> 00:54:53,970
And it's actually a decent joke.
If I read it better, I'm seriously,

858
00:54:53,971 --> 00:54:56,190
they had it done and they
didn't do it themselves.

859
00:54:56,191 --> 00:55:00,810
So thinking about the fact that they
didn't do much of the dirty work got me

860
00:55:00,811 --> 00:55:03,830
thinking about who did the
dirty work for themselves. Um,

861
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:07,050
after a little research I came across,
uh,

862
00:55:07,051 --> 00:55:12,051
the person who I think was the
baddest motherfucker of World War Two.

863
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:18,150
And A, I love the suspense. He
builds up. Was He from the u s no.

864
00:55:18,570 --> 00:55:23,490
Was He from Germany? Ah. Was
He from England? No, cigar.

865
00:55:23,491 --> 00:55:27,790
Mother fucker. Was He from
Philly? Finland? Fuck yeah. Seven.

866
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,820
This dude was from Finland.
The guy's name was,

867
00:55:29,821 --> 00:55:33,950
and I'm going to butcher this because even
the, the, the phonetic pronunciation, I,

868
00:55:33,951 --> 00:55:37,830
I don't know how to say the guy's name.
Maybe anybody in Finland.

869
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:43,620
And what's a fuck isn't, is that
Helsinki? I have no fucking idea. Uh, um,

870
00:55:44,490 --> 00:55:49,290
CMO. Hey Ha. I don't know how the fuck
to say it. My best attempt at the,

871
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:53,640
at the pronunciation of the last name is,
what did he say?

872
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:56,010
How Ha as in hat hat?

873
00:55:56,820 --> 00:56:00,880
How Ha Cmo, how hair, I don't know.

874
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:02,041
Anyways,

875
00:56:02,041 --> 00:56:06,180
he was nicknamed white death due to the
fact that he would operate in the snow

876
00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:10,800
and had a completely white uniform so
he couldn't be seen. All right, let's,

877
00:56:10,801 --> 00:56:13,590
let's go onto the Wikipedia. Let me read
about this guy. The first thing you know,

878
00:56:13,591 --> 00:56:17,580
if you look at, look at, look,
this guy up, it's s I m o h.

879
00:56:17,581 --> 00:56:22,581
A.

880
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:27,110
Y. H. A. M. Live to be 96
years old. All right. Nickname.

881
00:56:27,111 --> 00:56:32,111
The white death by the Russians is
highest recorded number of kills.

882
00:56:33,071 --> 00:56:36,070
He was a sniper,
was 505.

883
00:56:36,070 --> 00:56:41,070
He has the highest recorded number
of kills 505 kills in any major war.

884
00:56:42,530 --> 00:56:47,110
All right. Uh, before entering
combat, he was a farmer and a hunter.

885
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:51,160
His farmhouse was reportedly full
of trophies for marksmanship.

886
00:56:51,850 --> 00:56:55,480
So I guess he was a natural, he was kinda
like the Wayne Gretzky of killing shit.

887
00:56:55,481 --> 00:56:59,320
Right? It was during war,
the world, the winter war,

888
00:56:59,350 --> 00:57:04,120
1939 to 1940 between Finland
and the Soviet Union.

889
00:57:04,121 --> 00:57:08,500
Isn't that interesting? They
call it the winter war. Um,

890
00:57:08,650 --> 00:57:12,400
well maybe that was an aspect of
World War II. I have no idea. Anyways,

891
00:57:12,401 --> 00:57:13,540
the winter war,
uh,

892
00:57:13,570 --> 00:57:18,570
that he began his duty as a sniper and
fought for the Finnish army against the

893
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:24,060
Red Army and temperatures of minus
40 and minus 20 degrees Celsius.

894
00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:28,360
So what's that like 80 degrees Fahrenheit?
I have no idea. It's fucking cold out.

895
00:57:28,870 --> 00:57:33,280
Um, dress completely in white camouflage.
Hey Ha. Whatever the fuck he said.

896
00:57:33,281 --> 00:57:35,770
Call his name. Hey Ya. Uh,

897
00:57:35,771 --> 00:57:40,210
was credited with 505 confirmed
kills of Soviet soldiers.

898
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:45,070
542 unconfirmed if unconfirmed
deaths are included.

899
00:57:45,071 --> 00:57:50,071
The unofficial finished frontline figure
with the battlefield battlefield of

900
00:57:50,171 --> 00:57:54,820
Cola places the number
of his kills at over 800,

901
00:57:56,200 --> 00:58:00,670
cause I guess he also had a sub machine
gun and people give him credit for

902
00:58:00,671 --> 00:58:02,320
killing another 200 people,

903
00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:07,210
thus bringing his credits up
to at least 705 remarkably,

904
00:58:07,211 --> 00:58:08,200
this is the biggest thing here.

905
00:58:08,410 --> 00:58:13,410
This motherfucker did this in fewer than
a hundred days with very limited amount

906
00:58:14,681 --> 00:58:18,370
of daylight per day.
So he just sort of woke up,

907
00:58:19,570 --> 00:58:22,060
I guess, you know, he's killing
like seven people a day.

908
00:58:23,050 --> 00:58:25,810
If he's up for 16 hours
once every couple of hours.

909
00:58:27,550 --> 00:58:30,700
Uh, what else can I
say about this guy? Um,

910
00:58:32,110 --> 00:58:35,950
I missed a part where he got to formed
part of the way through there. He was, uh,

911
00:58:37,870 --> 00:58:38,703
one

912
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:44,920
of the fuck is it now the tech
to hae a was to compact the snow.

913
00:58:44,921 --> 00:58:48,700
You can pack the snow in front of him so
that the shot wouldn't disturb the snow

914
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:50,350
and reveal his position.

915
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:55,680
He also kept snow in his mouth so that
when breathing this steam would not give

916
00:58:56,131 --> 00:58:59,740
them away. How have they not
made a movie about this guy?

917
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:04,750
He preferred to use iron sights
rather than telescopic sites.

918
00:59:04,751 --> 00:59:07,360
For all your gun nuts to
present a smaller target.

919
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:11,110
Uh Oh,
I see.

920
00:59:11,111 --> 00:59:15,160
Cause the sniper must raise his head
higher when using a telescopic sight to

921
00:59:15,161 --> 00:59:19,930
prevent visibility risks. A telescopic
sights glass can fog up easily.

922
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:22,110
Okay.

923
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:23,000
I,

924
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:27,680
the Soviets tried a number of ways to
get rid of him counter sniper's artillery

925
00:59:27,681 --> 00:59:29,410
strikes and filing.
On May 6th,

926
00:59:29,411 --> 00:59:33,770
the guy was shot through the jaw during
combat by a Russian soldier. The,

927
00:59:34,060 --> 00:59:37,370
the bullet tumbled upon
impact and left his head.

928
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:41,420
Fellow soldier picked him up.
Half his head was missing.

929
00:59:41,421 --> 00:59:44,600
He regained consciousness
seven days later,

930
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:50,060
the day peace was declared. Shortly
after the war, uh, this dude was,

931
00:59:50,061 --> 00:59:52,310
went straight from corporal
to a second lieutenant,

932
00:59:52,311 --> 00:59:57,170
the highest jumping rank in the
history of the Finnish army. Uh Wow.

933
00:59:57,620 --> 01:00:01,670
Did that bore, I'll be like, I didn't
bore you guys too much but a day ago.

934
01:00:01,730 --> 01:00:04,460
And they asked him later on in
life, did, did it bother you?

935
01:00:04,490 --> 01:00:07,670
The amount of people that you kill,
which is such a Douchey fucking question.

936
01:00:08,090 --> 01:00:10,940
And he just basically said, look, I
was doing the job they told me to do.

937
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:15,500
Like they all end up fucking same.
Did it bother you?

938
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:19,610
Did it bothered me that I killed the
guys who were trying to kill me? Uh,

939
01:00:19,670 --> 01:00:20,503
no it didn't.

940
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:28,160
I'm sure a couple of dumb fucks who
thought they were in the clear and got up

941
01:00:28,161 --> 01:00:30,260
and took a Piss,
you know,

942
01:00:30,350 --> 01:00:33,950
and he kind of felt bad like Jesus Christ
who can at least piss behind a tree.

943
01:00:35,030 --> 01:00:38,540
You know? Maybe that wouldn't make
you feel bad. What do you guys think?

944
01:00:38,541 --> 01:00:41,570
Do you think you'd feel bad?
Um,

945
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:47,930
I would just think if I went to war,
I've always felt this,

946
01:00:47,931 --> 01:00:51,320
that the second the battle started,
I would be,

947
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:53,210
I would be the guy crying in the Fox hole.

948
01:00:53,211 --> 01:00:57,590
But if I could ever just kill that first
fucking person, I would just be like,

949
01:00:57,591 --> 01:01:01,390
all right, well, you know,
fuck it now. And, uh,

950
01:01:01,430 --> 01:01:06,350
I just think I would be so
filled with anger and fear that,

951
01:01:06,351 --> 01:01:09,440
uh,
I dunno.

952
01:01:11,030 --> 01:01:13,070
I Dunno. That's, and I have no fucking,

953
01:01:13,090 --> 01:01:17,180
and you know those people who fight in
wars, man, people that join the service,

954
01:01:17,181 --> 01:01:21,160
Jesus Christ. I, I don't know. I,
I don't think I could, you know,

955
01:01:21,161 --> 01:01:23,570
as much as people sit there
and they talk about, you know,

956
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:27,860
the balls it takes to do stand up,
you know,

957
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:32,300
it, it really pales in fucking
comparison when, you know,

958
01:01:32,930 --> 01:01:36,050
if you just talk about someone who goes
into the peace corps and is trying to

959
01:01:36,051 --> 01:01:38,840
bring water to a tribe, forget about
somebody who's fucking going to war.

960
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:43,880
And speaking of, let's talk about stand
up terminology. Here's something that, um,

961
01:01:45,110 --> 01:01:49,810
has been bugging me lately
is I've noticed that, um,

962
01:01:49,811 --> 01:01:54,800
in this happens, you know, people
come up with new words like a,

963
01:01:54,801 --> 01:01:56,150
you know,
I'm chilling,

964
01:01:56,820 --> 01:01:59,720
I'm going to use like hip hop slang
because that's always the easiest.

965
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:01,640
You know what I can,
as long as I can really think of,

966
01:02:01,641 --> 01:02:06,590
and then they just become words. But,
uh, just as a, as a, as a standup comic,

967
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:10,820
purest I've noticed, you know,
when I get into it with the crowd,

968
01:02:10,821 --> 01:02:14,120
when somebody heckles me and then
I give him shit back, I get emails.

969
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:16,520
I was at your second show,
sat on Saturday night.

970
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:21,360
I loved the way you heckled that guy
in the audience after he heckled you.

971
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:25,020
Um,
heckling is done by the crowd.

972
01:02:25,710 --> 01:02:27,630
The comedian does not heckle the crowd.

973
01:02:27,631 --> 01:02:31,180
He can play with the
crowd and he can fucking,

974
01:02:31,190 --> 01:02:35,790
I don't even know what it's called. When
you, when you fucking murderer a heckler,

975
01:02:35,791 --> 01:02:39,000
you destroy him but you're
not heckling him. All right,

976
01:02:39,001 --> 01:02:43,320
you're up there trying to do your rack.
The only way for a comedian to,

977
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:45,180
to heckle a crowd as if he,

978
01:02:45,181 --> 01:02:49,620
if he sat in the crowd and the hope and
the whole crowd got up on stage and then

979
01:02:49,621 --> 01:02:54,621
tried to do some to some
sort of performance and I
interrupted and fucked up

980
01:02:55,831 --> 01:02:59,880
their performance. But when they
tell me to go fuck themselves,

981
01:03:00,030 --> 01:03:04,970
fuck myself, they're not
heckling me. Jesus Christ.

982
01:03:04,971 --> 01:03:07,320
You would think that I would actually
have the decency to look up heckle.

983
01:03:09,930 --> 01:03:13,910
Why don't I do that? Heckle
definition. Goddammit.

984
01:03:13,950 --> 01:03:17,070
That beer tasted good and
I get a fucking 6:54 AM

985
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:20,040
definition for heckle.

986
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:24,870
Uh, okay. Here we go.

987
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,810
Try to embarrass and annoyed by questions.

988
01:03:30,811 --> 01:03:32,280
Jibes or objections.

989
01:03:32,281 --> 01:03:36,630
Badger try to annoy someone speaking
or performing in public by questions.

990
01:03:36,631 --> 01:03:39,570
Jibes or objections in
bad. There you go. See,

991
01:03:39,571 --> 01:03:43,680
that's why you can't because you're not
trying to perform in public. All right,

992
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:46,080
I skipped over the shit in parentheses,
so let me read that again.

993
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:51,320
Try to heckling is trying to embarrass
and annoy someone speaking or performing

994
01:03:52,441 --> 01:03:56,790
in public by questions. Jibes or
objections, badger or whatever.

995
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:58,230
That's what it means.

996
01:03:58,231 --> 01:04:03,231
So the comedian can't heckle the crowd
because the crowd is not on stage trying

997
01:04:04,231 --> 01:04:07,800
to give a performance.
So for the love of God,

998
01:04:08,100 --> 01:04:11,820
stop sending me fucking emails saying
you loved how I heckled the crowd.

999
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:16,350
I didn't do that. It's like telling
a guitarist, I love your drum solo.

1000
01:04:18,030 --> 01:04:20,700
Did that make any sense? Is this
alcohol taking? I haven't drank,

1001
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:23,280
I haven't fucking eight in a minute.
You know,

1002
01:04:24,150 --> 01:04:27,720
this beer is fucking delicious. You know
what makes a beer like this? Tastes good.

1003
01:04:27,721 --> 01:04:30,150
A good beer glass.
Do you guys have beer glasses?

1004
01:04:30,390 --> 01:04:34,560
Talking to the men out there and the few
women out there who are, fuck you guys.

1005
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:38,630
Women aren't into beer
glasses. Are you, you know,

1006
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:40,170
do I have any lesbians on my podcast?

1007
01:04:40,171 --> 01:04:44,760
Maybe you guys have the brains to
like beer glasses. Um, Jesus Christ.

1008
01:04:45,030 --> 01:04:45,271
You know,

1009
01:04:45,271 --> 01:04:49,140
I usually don't make any sense but me
buzz doing this podcast is going to make

1010
01:04:49,141 --> 01:04:50,400
even less and less sense.

1011
01:04:51,270 --> 01:04:55,260
That's a fucking sign of maturity of
beer glass. And that's another thing.

1012
01:04:55,261 --> 01:04:59,250
If you want to stave off the fact
that you kind of think that you have a

1013
01:04:59,251 --> 01:05:02,430
drinking problem is if in your house,

1014
01:05:02,431 --> 01:05:07,431
if you have the proper glasses for
whatever alcohol you're drinking,

1015
01:05:07,770 --> 01:05:10,500
okay, you're drinking whiskey
out of a disc Dixie Cup.

1016
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:13,020
Me Stuttering like a shit head.
That was a good line too.

1017
01:05:13,230 --> 01:05:17,950
If you're drinking whiskey out
of a Dixie Cup take to uh, yeah,

1018
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:22,570
there's really no way,
you know,

1019
01:05:23,790 --> 01:05:25,690
a little vodka in a sippy cup.

1020
01:05:26,410 --> 01:05:28,810
She kids crying in the corner
because he's fucking hungry.

1021
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:34,870
Uh, hang on one second. Hang on a
second. What do I go? What do I got here?

1022
01:05:35,490 --> 01:05:38,140
Hey Paul, let me call you back.
I'm doing my podcast. All right.

1023
01:05:40,230 --> 01:05:44,800
All right man. Take it easy. Um,
all right. Where the fuck am I?

1024
01:05:45,910 --> 01:05:48,820
Yeah. You know what I mean? But if you
have the right, you have the proper glass.

1025
01:05:49,930 --> 01:05:52,870
I have the classic 16 ounce,
you know,

1026
01:05:52,871 --> 01:05:54,670
you'd pour a Heineken
in this type of thing.

1027
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:56,740
I actually got those
Sam Adams glasses too.

1028
01:05:56,741 --> 01:05:59,710
You know the ones that they had where
they got some sort of special glass thing

1029
01:05:59,711 --> 01:06:03,940
at the bottom and it makes the beer,
you know, the Sam Adams and swirl up.

1030
01:06:04,150 --> 01:06:07,690
They're really cool glasses. But what I
don't like is they only hold 12 ounces,

1031
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:11,410
you know? And it's just
like, well, what about me?

1032
01:06:11,470 --> 01:06:14,620
Who likes to go 16 ounces at a time?
You know?

1033
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:19,210
All right.
I'm not even being funny right now.

1034
01:06:19,211 --> 01:06:23,590
I'm just fucking sitting here enjoying a,
there's nothing better.

1035
01:06:23,591 --> 01:06:26,200
One Nice fucking beer.
But can you ever stop?

1036
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:30,070
You know what's funny is my
girl's not here right now.

1037
01:06:30,071 --> 01:06:33,100
He'd be funny if I'm just sitting here
in my fucking boxers and just, just,

1038
01:06:33,130 --> 01:06:36,880
she comes home and I'm about ready to
go on the row front of the five days,

1039
01:06:36,881 --> 01:06:41,260
and then she just comes home and I'm just
fucking sitting him buzzed, you know,

1040
01:06:42,070 --> 01:06:45,940
t shirt, boxers, socks. I mean,

1041
01:06:45,941 --> 01:06:48,670
I'm just dressed like I'm unemployed

1042
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:55,510
and all I gotta do is just start giving
a shit. Why am I such a Dick? All right,

1043
01:06:55,540 --> 01:06:58,480
let's continue on here. Um, yeah,

1044
01:06:58,481 --> 01:07:00,580
that would be unsightly will
in our speaking of shit.

1045
01:07:00,581 --> 01:07:03,910
That's just fucking
insightful. To use a, a,

1046
01:07:04,660 --> 01:07:07,530
a segue from the 1980s,
um,

1047
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:11,980
I was flying back from New York and uh,
you know,

1048
01:07:11,981 --> 01:07:14,050
it's a real peppy pet
peeve of mine is these,

1049
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:18,820
these mother fucking like regular
looking people who just get here.

1050
01:07:18,820 --> 01:07:21,700
They kicked his shoes off
during the flight. All right?

1051
01:07:21,701 --> 01:07:26,200
And then not wearing any socks.
All right?

1052
01:07:26,201 --> 01:07:28,930
So it's gross enough that she,

1053
01:07:28,931 --> 01:07:33,931
you have your bare feet on that airline
carpet where God knows what is in the

1054
01:07:34,841 --> 01:07:37,630
rug.
Okay.

1055
01:07:38,580 --> 01:07:41,500
You know how filthy the fucking
errors in the God damn tube.

1056
01:07:41,501 --> 01:07:44,170
They never recycled that fucking air.
You just breathing.

1057
01:07:44,171 --> 01:07:47,680
I mean it's like 80% carbon dioxide,
right?

1058
01:07:49,270 --> 01:07:51,400
So what the fuck you think is in the rug?

1059
01:07:52,180 --> 01:07:55,090
Have you ever seen him shampooer
goddamn rug in between flights.

1060
01:07:55,091 --> 01:07:57,880
They don't do it. And you put your
bare feet on it. This what kills me.

1061
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,540
This is regular fucking people af
after they've kicked her shoes off,

1062
01:08:01,541 --> 01:08:02,440
they have to go to the bathroom.

1063
01:08:02,441 --> 01:08:07,441
They get up and they think walked down
the aisle into the bathroom with no

1064
01:08:07,721 --> 01:08:11,530
fucking socks or shoes on.
It's the most disgusting.

1065
01:08:11,530 --> 01:08:15,190
I saw this girl sitting next to me. She
had one of those uh, English Australian.

1066
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:18,030
I can't pick out the accent,
you know,

1067
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:22,600
the next time you fucking European
shit on what animals? We are over here.

1068
01:08:22,601 --> 01:08:26,500
One of your fucking, one of you fucking
birds who was sitting next to me,

1069
01:08:26,501 --> 01:08:30,160
got up with their flip flops on now kicked
them off. And then what? She actually,

1070
01:08:30,161 --> 01:08:33,280
I'll give her credit. She did walk halfway
to the bathroom and then came back,

1071
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:36,930
you know, and I was like, all
right, she has some class,

1072
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:40,040
but she had her hair up and
she had flakes behind her rear.

1073
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:42,660
It's disgusting how fucking flight.

1074
01:08:42,661 --> 01:08:46,200
And I could stop looking at it every time
I'd glance over and then I would just

1075
01:08:46,201 --> 01:08:48,270
keep making these noises going.
Ah.

1076
01:08:48,980 --> 01:08:51,680
Then she sort of glance at me and I
pretend like I didn't do what she probably

1077
01:08:51,681 --> 01:08:55,280
thought I had Tourette's and she didn't
realize that I'm reacting to the fucking

1078
01:08:56,810 --> 01:08:59,510
fucking flakes behind you. You'll
kind of a mother, are you going to be,

1079
01:08:59,540 --> 01:09:01,580
you can't even clean behind
your own fucking years.

1080
01:09:02,620 --> 01:09:05,510
Put your head down and go walk
barefoot to the fucking airplane,

1081
01:09:05,690 --> 01:09:09,700
goddamn bathroom and clean yourself
up before I slap the shit out of you.

1082
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:13,300
All right, what else do
we got here? All right,

1083
01:09:13,301 --> 01:09:16,600
here's a good youtube video for the
week as the fucking booze is starting to

1084
01:09:16,601 --> 01:09:21,500
kick in a Boddingtons. I highly recommend
it. All right, you youngsters out there,

1085
01:09:21,501 --> 01:09:25,720
you're probably not gonna
like it. Um, all right.

1086
01:09:26,110 --> 01:09:30,580
But as your voice gets deeper and your
ball stuck to drop even further into the

1087
01:09:30,581 --> 01:09:32,980
toilet bowl, I'm telling you it's a
beer you're going to fucking like,

1088
01:09:33,010 --> 01:09:36,790
what am I doing here? What
the hell am I? All right.

1089
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:39,950
Note to self, don't drink when you
do the podcast anymore. Would you,

1090
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:43,340
would you guys enjoy podcasts? So I just
got completely shit faced. The thing is,

1091
01:09:43,341 --> 01:09:46,510
is it's only an hour long, so it's
kind of hard to get drunk that quick.

1092
01:09:46,511 --> 01:09:49,240
I can get pretty buzzed,
you know, really bill,

1093
01:09:49,241 --> 01:09:51,640
is that what we're here we
were down to right now is like,

1094
01:09:51,641 --> 01:09:55,060
you're going to do like some fucking
stunt like David Blaine. Bill,

1095
01:09:55,061 --> 01:09:58,090
why don't you do the podcast in a
fucking block ice? He had dumb cunt.

1096
01:09:58,390 --> 01:10:00,340
I think it's time for a special guest.
At some point.

1097
01:10:00,341 --> 01:10:04,090
I gotta I gotta get another special
guest on this podcast. Um, all right,

1098
01:10:04,091 --> 01:10:08,980
plowing ahead here. Um, here's a
youtube video to watch for this week.

1099
01:10:09,010 --> 01:10:12,590
A baby preacher with subtitles.

1100
01:10:13,850 --> 01:10:15,380
Uh,
it's just fucking awesome.

1101
01:10:16,630 --> 01:10:18,100
It's a a,
I dunno,

1102
01:10:18,970 --> 01:10:21,790
this baby who guesses goes
to church every fucking day.

1103
01:10:21,791 --> 01:10:25,900
And his watched these preachers preaching
and then they gave the baby the Mike

1104
01:10:25,901 --> 01:10:29,650
and it's just sort of walking around
going, hey, eh, talking baby talk.

1105
01:10:29,651 --> 01:10:34,651
But somebody transcribes what the kid
is saying and I swear to God it the way

1106
01:10:35,081 --> 01:10:36,320
they put it up there it

1107
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:38,160
right as you read it.

1108
01:10:38,161 --> 01:10:41,640
The baby says it and it sounds like
the baby's saying and it's fucking,

1109
01:10:41,970 --> 01:10:45,990
and it's a visual joke and I'm trying to
explain it here. All right. Underrated.

1110
01:10:45,991 --> 01:10:47,130
Overrated for this week.

1111
01:10:47,190 --> 01:10:51,480
I'm doing this at a half hour in knowing
full well that I have to somehow fill

1112
01:10:51,481 --> 01:10:53,520
up another 20 fucking minutes.
All right.

1113
01:10:55,060 --> 01:10:59,620
Overrated for this week. This
is a great one. Overrated.

1114
01:10:59,650 --> 01:11:02,440
When Chames this dude says,

1115
01:11:02,441 --> 01:11:06,730
I hate the annoying clink clank
sound with a fucking passion.

1116
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:08,710
What is wrong with the people?

1117
01:11:09,330 --> 01:11:13,050
Huh? What's wrong with people?
Seriously, the world is not loud.

1118
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:15,360
You have to fucking add to it.

1119
01:11:17,610 --> 01:11:18,720
You know they,

1120
01:11:18,810 --> 01:11:23,810
they do believe the sounds will make
them better people or make life better.

1121
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:26,160
You know what dude?
You want such a great role to your right.

1122
01:11:26,161 --> 01:11:28,590
Brought that fucking sentence. Okay. Oh,

1123
01:11:28,591 --> 01:11:32,900
what do they believe the sounds will make
them better people or make their life

1124
01:11:32,901 --> 01:11:36,710
better? I found it most
annoying and of in invasive,

1125
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:42,770
I find it the art. Jesus Christ. I'm
never drinking on the podcast again.

1126
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:46,580
Go Fuck Yourself. All right. What
is wrong with Pete? Where am I?

1127
01:11:46,820 --> 01:11:51,020
I find it the most annoying and
invasive thing I am forced to listen to,

1128
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:55,800
even with closed windows, but
there's so peaceful. Yeah.

1129
01:11:56,450 --> 01:11:58,100
Um,
if you fucking like the sound,

1130
01:11:58,220 --> 01:12:01,640
why don't you put them up inside your
home and have the fucking fan going

1131
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:06,970
in any way? What gives anybody the right
to push their taste on others? Dude,

1132
01:12:06,971 --> 01:12:10,840
I totally agree. It's like if you're
going to make smokers smoke outside,

1133
01:12:10,990 --> 01:12:14,290
then you want to make these fucking wind
chime. People take that shit indoors.

1134
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:16,840
I can't tell you how annoying that is.
It's an,

1135
01:12:16,870 --> 01:12:21,430
you know what's annoying about it is it's
an annoying sound that's trying to be

1136
01:12:21,431 --> 01:12:25,640
fucking spiritual. That's what
kills me. It's even, um, it's,

1137
01:12:25,690 --> 01:12:28,970
it's more annoying than just the loud,
annoying sound that's fucking annoying.

1138
01:12:28,971 --> 01:12:32,420
Cause at least the loud annoying sound
has the fucking courage to be annoying.

1139
01:12:33,950 --> 01:12:36,620
Those fucking things. They
actually, they're there.
They're there. You don't want,

1140
01:12:36,621 --> 01:12:39,920
when I go on youtube and just get some
fucking wind chime sounds for all you

1141
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:42,440
dumb cons out there who do yoga,

1142
01:12:43,130 --> 01:12:47,150
you know and actually think that these
fucking things sound good. Here we go.

1143
01:12:47,151 --> 01:12:52,130
Wind fucking chimes. Youtube.
Let's see what we got. Here we go.

1144
01:12:52,131 --> 01:12:54,710
Yeah, cause somebody fucking loves
him so much. They put up a video.

1145
01:12:54,711 --> 01:12:58,570
Here we go for all you can't
see out there. Here it is. Okay.

1146
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:03,440
Ooh,

1147
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:09,650
I got to met.
Those are nice.

1148
01:13:13,050 --> 01:13:16,590
This isn't fair. This guy's got fuck. He's
got the professional grade level ones.

1149
01:13:16,591 --> 01:13:21,140
He thinks look like the exhaust on a
God damn. Oh that's giant wind chimes.

1150
01:13:21,170 --> 01:13:26,070
All right. I just learned
something. I don't mind. Giant
wind chimes. Oh, here's one.

1151
01:13:26,071 --> 01:13:28,890
Here's one of these little douchey. Once
you get it, a fucking hardware store.

1152
01:13:31,450 --> 01:13:35,070
Typical Youtube, you just can't put wind
chimes. Elliot, he beautiful wind chime.

1153
01:13:35,470 --> 01:13:36,580
It's just the Cantisano.

1154
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:41,600
There it is.

1155
01:13:47,170 --> 01:13:49,260
You know what the great thing is,
is they're made out of metal.

1156
01:13:49,261 --> 01:13:50,340
So when you rip them off,

1157
01:13:50,341 --> 01:13:54,000
you have a fucking blunt object to beat
your neighbor to death with [inaudible].

1158
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:55,051
That's what you do.

1159
01:13:55,051 --> 01:13:59,190
And then you dip it and fucking peroxide
bleach and you hook it back up again.

1160
01:13:59,430 --> 01:14:01,860
Let those a and e cuts
figure out that murder.

1161
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:07,750
Well my and murdered on his porch.
You know, somehow they find,

1162
01:14:07,751 --> 01:14:12,160
you know, and a fucking, I don't know,

1163
01:14:12,161 --> 01:14:15,730
an eighth of an inch of his face
imprint on that fucking wind chime.

1164
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:18,350
If you ever watch shows ane he
thinks how they catch people, it's,

1165
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:20,440
it's like it's not even fucking fair.

1166
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:27,150
Do you ever see the one as I take
another healthy swap. I got news for you.

1167
01:14:27,151 --> 01:14:29,370
I'm having another beer.
This might be the new thing.

1168
01:14:29,371 --> 01:14:33,120
I might do this shit Thursday night.
Take a night off from stand up.

1169
01:14:33,660 --> 01:14:36,030
Tell my chick to hit the fucking bricks.

1170
01:14:36,780 --> 01:14:39,180
Is anything better than
drinking your own goddamn house?

1171
01:14:39,181 --> 01:14:43,390
It just makes you want to start screaming
about the shit you own. You know

1172
01:14:46,420 --> 01:14:50,800
I paid for this shit.
You hear that old man downstairs,

1173
01:14:50,801 --> 01:14:52,300
I'm going to get louder and
he's going to come up here.

1174
01:14:52,301 --> 01:14:54,070
That would be the ultimate podcast.

1175
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:58,120
You know the thing about old people is
you always have to worry that they are a

1176
01:14:58,121 --> 01:15:02,570
fucking [inaudible]. They fought in
a fucking work cause I never had,

1177
01:15:02,900 --> 01:15:03,591
I never have.

1178
01:15:03,591 --> 01:15:07,520
So I have total respect
for fucking veterans in the
fact that they still got it

1179
01:15:07,521 --> 01:15:10,140
in him. You know, that would be insane.

1180
01:15:10,141 --> 01:15:12,870
One night if I actually just totally
pissed him off and he really did fight in

1181
01:15:12,871 --> 01:15:16,860
the Korean War and he just fucking
through whatever that fucking thing is you

1182
01:15:16,861 --> 01:15:20,820
throw up when you, when you got to climb
up the rope on the side of the building,

1183
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:25,340
you know that, that, that fucking
land fish hook thing throws it up.

1184
01:15:25,341 --> 01:15:26,570
Dan just climbs up,

1185
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:31,580
comes over my railing as I'm sitting
here doing this podcast, half in the bag,

1186
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:35,940
he's got a kitchen knife between
his teeth, like a fucking pirate.

1187
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:38,353
What would I do?

1188
01:15:39,630 --> 01:15:44,630
I've probably taken 12 karate classes
in my life and they've all been like,

1189
01:15:45,650 --> 01:15:49,720
yeah, you know, six years apart. Yeah.

1190
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:53,880
Fucking guide. Coming
and filet me, you know,

1191
01:15:55,730 --> 01:15:58,850
I don't fucking know. I just sat back
and I just lost the screen here. Yeah.

1192
01:15:58,851 --> 01:16:02,260
So whatever wind chimes are
fucking overrated. They really are.

1193
01:16:02,261 --> 01:16:04,460
But I gotta tell you, if you get
the giant ones, the giant ones,

1194
01:16:04,461 --> 01:16:07,810
a nice listen to the giant ones at
giant ones. Have a nice tone to him.

1195
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:10,570
It's a little deeper.
I think I figured it out.

1196
01:16:12,890 --> 01:16:13,723
Yeah.

1197
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:15,703
Ooh,

1198
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:21,500
come on man. You gotta admit that's
not bad if you let go of the anger,

1199
01:16:21,501 --> 01:16:23,900
your childhood, right? Let
go your anger for a second.

1200
01:16:29,690 --> 01:16:30,523
Si

1201
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:33,350
sound of a ship in the background.

1202
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:37,510
Uh,

1203
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:45,960
hoshin coming up on the beach.

1204
01:16:52,850 --> 01:16:54,030
You have it. Get to that point, right?

1205
01:16:54,031 --> 01:16:57,630
When are you going to get relaxed and let
go? And then you get so fucking scared.

1206
01:16:57,631 --> 01:17:01,110
You get right back into the anger and
then you want to punch somebody in fucking

1207
01:17:01,111 --> 01:17:05,920
yoga pants. Okay. Um, all right. Let
enough with the fucking wind chimes here.

1208
01:17:06,470 --> 01:17:09,070
That was really painting a picture
of their fucking Michael Winslow.

1209
01:17:09,590 --> 01:17:12,110
I think it's time for more booze.
What do you guys think?

1210
01:17:12,450 --> 01:17:14,000
How about a nice healthy sip?

1211
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:20,550
Ah, God damn it. That's fucking delicious.

1212
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:23,700
He poor bastards and oh and oh and a,

1213
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:28,460
you pull pastors and Aa and that was
one good thing about the trip, uh,

1214
01:17:28,470 --> 01:17:32,220
when I went back is actually got to do
opening Anthony and I'm going to do it

1215
01:17:32,221 --> 01:17:32,600
again.

1216
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:36,290
Um, next week, probably
again the Tuesday again,

1217
01:17:36,291 --> 01:17:40,730
I'm on the exact same flight
back to Los Angeles. I did it,

1218
01:17:40,731 --> 01:17:45,020
the opiate Anthony show this past Tuesday,
popped in there for like an hour.

1219
01:17:45,021 --> 01:17:49,160
I had a good fucking time.
Didn't get a chance to argue with Anthony,

1220
01:17:49,161 --> 01:17:54,070
but you know, it was still good
to see them as adorable as ever.

1221
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:57,930
All right, let's uh,
let's plow ahead here. Um,

1222
01:17:58,420 --> 01:18:01,870
let's get to some more fucking
overrated shit. Overrated.

1223
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:04,840
Super expensive TVS.

1224
01:18:05,620 --> 01:18:09,250
Who the fuck needs to
spend two grand on a TV?

1225
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:14,200
I know the super clear, et Cetera,
but it's not like it's, it's some,

1226
01:18:14,201 --> 01:18:18,930
a huge jump.
My eight year old Sony still works great.

1227
01:18:19,110 --> 01:18:21,990
The picture is fine.
If I want to watch some great TV,

1228
01:18:22,170 --> 01:18:26,430
I'll just go to one of the a hundred
bars in the city that have 80 of them

1229
01:18:26,431 --> 01:18:29,170
slapped on the walls.
Which another thing,

1230
01:18:29,260 --> 01:18:33,970
which is another thing that's overrated
cookie cutter bars with a million TVs

1231
01:18:34,150 --> 01:18:37,090
and zero atmosphere.
But I digress

1232
01:18:39,180 --> 01:18:39,950
you guys.

1233
01:18:39,950 --> 01:18:43,400
You guys are fucking good writers and I
like how you said I digress rather than

1234
01:18:43,401 --> 01:18:44,570
me last week when I say,

1235
01:18:44,571 --> 01:18:49,571
but I digressed in the past tense because
I never used that expression animal

1236
01:18:50,150 --> 01:18:53,600
moron. Um, dude, I have to
totally agree with you. In fact,

1237
01:18:53,601 --> 01:18:56,750
I would still have an
old school TV if I'm,

1238
01:18:57,580 --> 01:19:01,360
I did move from New York, New York to La.
I was going to keep my old school one.

1239
01:19:01,390 --> 01:19:06,390
I had no problem watching the
game on the old school square TV.

1240
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:12,430
It didn't bug me. You know, I don't
need to see that. The inside of shacks,

1241
01:19:12,910 --> 01:19:16,750
I don't need to see shacks. Fucking,
you know, knows Cartlidge. Ever.

1242
01:19:16,751 --> 01:19:18,700
When I first got HD TV,
I was watching,

1243
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:22,950
I was watching ESPN and like Stuart Scott
or one of those guys is doing it and

1244
01:19:22,951 --> 01:19:25,920
I'm like looking at his pores and I
could see actually a little bit of the

1245
01:19:25,921 --> 01:19:29,490
inside of his nose. His nose wasn't dirty
or nothing, but it was just, it's like,

1246
01:19:29,491 --> 01:19:32,160
dude,
all I need is just to hear the scores.

1247
01:19:34,590 --> 01:19:36,330
I'll tell you,
you know what's fucking overrated too,

1248
01:19:36,331 --> 01:19:41,010
and I hope it flops like
fucking David Beckham in La are.

1249
01:19:41,011 --> 01:19:44,940
Here's one great overrated
is fucking Shit in three d.

1250
01:19:46,570 --> 01:19:50,410
All right,
Avatar in three day,

1251
01:19:50,411 --> 01:19:55,150
who gives a fuck some butterfly
flying near your face.

1252
01:19:55,151 --> 01:20:00,070
You've got damn ferry. The fuck is
wrong with you and all of these idiots.

1253
01:20:00,220 --> 01:20:02,560
We're going to go out and buy three d TVs.

1254
01:20:02,980 --> 01:20:07,210
You dumb fucks if you buy a three d TV,

1255
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:08,190
you know what you like?

1256
01:20:08,370 --> 01:20:09,000
You like those.

1257
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:12,930
You were like one of those dumb shits
who keeps buying the new razor blades.

1258
01:20:14,190 --> 01:20:17,590
Has any razor blade work
better than the fucking,

1259
01:20:17,610 --> 01:20:22,610
all you needed was to one sucked too
was the shit three doesn't do underneath

1260
01:20:23,161 --> 01:20:24,930
your nose.
You got to pinch your nose,

1261
01:20:24,931 --> 01:20:27,660
like you're in a barbershop
in the 19 fucking twenties,

1262
01:20:27,810 --> 01:20:31,080
getting a straight razor shave
during a fucking three stooges film.

1263
01:20:31,890 --> 01:20:33,660
And then it goes all the way up to four.

1264
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:37,470
And then they knew they couldn't do
five or did they do five and now they're

1265
01:20:37,471 --> 01:20:42,030
trying to act like the blades or even
fucking sharper. It's all bullshit.

1266
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:43,920
The worst thing that ever happened to me,

1267
01:20:43,921 --> 01:20:46,170
one time I was doing college or something,

1268
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:50,220
I think I was in Florida and
it was the double whammy.

1269
01:20:51,420 --> 01:20:52,810
I had a toilet tree,

1270
01:20:53,150 --> 01:20:56,910
a bag from tough crowd,

1271
01:20:57,720 --> 01:21:01,970
one of my favorite fucking shows to
do. Tough crowd with Colin Quinn. Um,

1272
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:05,450
and one of the, one of the, the gift
bags they gave you what it was, was this,

1273
01:21:05,451 --> 01:21:08,400
this toiletry bag. It's a tough
crowd on it and Shit, you know?

1274
01:21:09,270 --> 01:21:10,500
And uh,

1275
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:15,510
not only did I leave that for God
and in the bathroom, but my, uh,

1276
01:21:16,350 --> 01:21:17,130
my razor,

1277
01:21:17,130 --> 01:21:22,020
my twin bladed razor was in it
and they don't sell them anymore.

1278
01:21:22,021 --> 01:21:25,890
And ever since then I've had the
triple one and it just sucks. Hey,

1279
01:21:25,891 --> 01:21:27,450
if there's one whisker right in that,

1280
01:21:27,451 --> 01:21:31,980
that the skin between your fucking
nostrils, I can't get it, can't get it.

1281
01:21:31,981 --> 01:21:34,590
And I got to do all these different
fucking tricks. I'm doing it right now.

1282
01:21:34,591 --> 01:21:35,910
You just, I gotta like, you know,

1283
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:41,250
make my nose look like that fucking
chicks knows in the Batman revenge movie.

1284
01:21:42,750 --> 01:21:47,100
Um, I bet she has no
problem. I was kind of mean.

1285
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:54,510
Yeah. So do you guys do me a
favor? All right. Don't buy
it. Don't buy three D TV's.

1286
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:59,460
Don't fucking buy them. Okay. Two
dimensional football is still the shit.

1287
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:04,080
Are you really going to sit there on
the couch with your friend wearing those

1288
01:22:04,081 --> 01:22:05,970
stupid fucking glasses?

1289
01:22:06,540 --> 01:22:10,950
So what tos balls can be in your face.
Come on.

1290
01:22:11,940 --> 01:22:14,430
You want to see it in three d?
Go to the fucking game.

1291
01:22:16,020 --> 01:22:20,220
Now watch the TVS will be awesome.
The TVS would be awesome.

1292
01:22:20,221 --> 01:22:22,860
And eventually I'll get them. If you
guys know what a fucking hypocrite I am,

1293
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:27,930
I bought the Prius, I defended it. And
slowly I'm going towards a challenger.

1294
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:32,040
You know, I'm fucking totally
into conspiracy theory.

1295
01:22:32,041 --> 01:22:34,170
I'm actually still into that shit.
And I don't give a fuck.

1296
01:22:34,171 --> 01:22:36,930
Now I'm just sitting here in my
underwear doing a podcast on Thursday,

1297
01:22:36,931 --> 01:22:39,030
drinking a beer.
You know,

1298
01:22:39,990 --> 01:22:42,570
I quit fucking quit.

1299
01:22:42,571 --> 01:22:46,090
You know what I realize the other
day too is you don't want to be yet.

1300
01:22:46,100 --> 01:22:48,990
You start talking shit.
When you get into conspiracy theory,

1301
01:22:48,991 --> 01:22:52,710
you actually think that
like, you know you, you're a,

1302
01:22:52,711 --> 01:22:56,700
you're on to something dangerous and
people are going to start watching you.

1303
01:22:56,701 --> 01:23:00,300
But the bottom line is,
is the second you recorded it and there's,

1304
01:23:01,260 --> 01:23:03,960
you know, I just look at what
Mel Gibson is going through,

1305
01:23:05,650 --> 01:23:09,490
what he's going through with the
recorded shit that he's fucking said.

1306
01:23:10,150 --> 01:23:12,040
I'm not saying I said
anything racist or anything,

1307
01:23:12,041 --> 01:23:14,650
but everything that I've done in the
podcast and last three fucking years,

1308
01:23:14,860 --> 01:23:19,480
I could never pull a Schwartzenegger.
Let's just fucking just like totally

1309
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:21,820
get into fantasy here.

1310
01:23:21,821 --> 01:23:26,821
Let's pretend that I actually somehow
became a huge fucking movie star.

1311
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:31,210
Did it for 20 years and then get sick
of it and decided to run for political

1312
01:23:31,211 --> 01:23:32,044
office.

1313
01:23:32,110 --> 01:23:36,160
You could pick any one of my podcasts and
that would be the end of the campaign.

1314
01:23:37,030 --> 01:23:37,863
You know,

1315
01:23:38,140 --> 01:23:41,500
especially those ones early on when I
said con to every other fucking word,

1316
01:23:43,090 --> 01:23:47,980
I just, I go through phases. I
didn't, I get into golf for a minute.

1317
01:23:47,981 --> 01:23:49,930
I got into conspiracy theory for a minute.

1318
01:23:50,230 --> 01:23:54,130
I got in to say and confirm
a minute and I dunno,

1319
01:23:54,131 --> 01:23:56,640
it just all goes by the fucking wayside.

1320
01:23:56,650 --> 01:23:59,470
This is one of the reasons why it
can't sustain a fucking relationship.

1321
01:24:00,340 --> 01:24:04,910
Although I've been able to sustain
this one. You know, I finally realized,

1322
01:24:04,930 --> 01:24:09,310
uh, I'm, I'm, I'm going to stop fucking
running like that fucking Eagle Song,

1323
01:24:10,270 --> 01:24:15,160
that stupid song. Desperado you
know, I would like to do that.

1324
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:19,840
I would like to do a three stooges slap
to everybody in the eagles is great of,

1325
01:24:19,841 --> 01:24:23,890
of musicians that they are those
cheese balls, songs that they wrote.

1326
01:24:26,410 --> 01:24:30,670
Desperado why don't you come to,

1327
01:24:30,671 --> 01:24:34,030
you'll say it is shut up Don Henley.

1328
01:24:35,170 --> 01:24:38,020
Just play the fucking drums.
Why don't you make a good fucking song?

1329
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:42,970
This song's a class. I want it.
What the fuck? Who am I kidding?

1330
01:24:43,660 --> 01:24:47,230
I'd love to be making the fucking
bank. Those guys are making, you know,

1331
01:24:47,470 --> 01:24:48,490
I'm going to warn you guys we have,

1332
01:24:48,491 --> 01:24:50,200
when I make some fucking
money in this business,

1333
01:24:50,201 --> 01:24:55,120
I'm going to sell out like you've never
seen anybody sell out in your fucking

1334
01:24:55,121 --> 01:24:59,890
life. I don't know what I'm going
to do, but I'm going to tap out.

1335
01:24:59,950 --> 01:25:04,240
I know I am. I'm going to buy a modest
house in the middle of fucking nowhere.

1336
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:07,570
I was actually looking at property
in like Wyoming and Montana.

1337
01:25:07,870 --> 01:25:09,190
I'm getting into that shit.

1338
01:25:10,270 --> 01:25:15,270
Having a fucking ranch couple of fucking
JAKKS God damn pig that you can boot in

1339
01:25:17,171 --> 01:25:19,990
the ass when your well water
isn't coming up that day.

1340
01:25:20,530 --> 01:25:25,450
Fucking shit ain't working.
Thing running over the hill.

1341
01:25:25,750 --> 01:25:29,530
Who's gonna report you?
You're out there by yourself,

1342
01:25:30,580 --> 01:25:33,220
dude.
You live in fucking Wyoming or Montana.

1343
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:38,440
You get yourself a spread.
You know you might as,

1344
01:25:38,450 --> 01:25:40,150
it's like you have your own country

1345
01:25:41,950 --> 01:25:46,180
just walk around naked on your property.
Nothing but you and your fucking timble.

1346
01:25:46,181 --> 01:25:47,014
It's

1347
01:25:50,650 --> 01:25:55,650
just shooting shit slowly go and crazy
best friends with like a pheasant.

1348
01:25:57,310 --> 01:26:00,250
You know,
I fucking love it.

1349
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:04,040
Learn how to grow fucking
vegetables and shit.

1350
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:06,410
You want to stand that?

1351
01:26:06,430 --> 01:26:09,650
How fucking awesome that would be
because I'll still do stand up.

1352
01:26:10,370 --> 01:26:11,260
Just listen to this.

1353
01:26:11,261 --> 01:26:15,920
This is the fucking dream that for
some reason this week I'm totally into,

1354
01:26:15,921 --> 01:26:17,150
I'm going to live like that.

1355
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:22,480
And then every other week I get to leave
the Ponderosa and then I fly into a

1356
01:26:22,731 --> 01:26:26,420
fucking metropolis. All
right? Get this, you know,

1357
01:26:26,421 --> 01:26:30,710
hang out with everybody who's was
living on top of one another. You know,

1358
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:36,020
soak up that vibe for a minute. Hang
an extra day and go to a football game.

1359
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:39,920
You know, eat somebody barbecue
that they claim is the greatest,

1360
01:26:39,921 --> 01:26:44,750
but it's always some dried out fucking
ribs and chicken with some sweet sauce.

1361
01:26:44,751 --> 01:26:49,610
The sauce always tastes the best to
meet. Always sucks. You know, once again,

1362
01:26:50,060 --> 01:26:53,270
I had some more smoked fucking barbecue
when I whatever the hell it is,

1363
01:26:53,271 --> 01:26:54,104
I always eat it.

1364
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:57,560
I always believe like this is going to
be the one that's going to make me like

1365
01:26:57,561 --> 01:27:01,580
it. Um, anyways.

1366
01:27:02,210 --> 01:27:04,730
Now Dude,
I would love to fucking do that shit.

1367
01:27:06,170 --> 01:27:07,220
I don't know if I could do it.

1368
01:27:07,250 --> 01:27:10,910
I don't know if I could live way
out in the middle of nowhere.

1369
01:27:12,230 --> 01:27:17,060
Um, but I'm telling you
man, that, that really the,

1370
01:27:17,061 --> 01:27:22,061
the longer I'm in this business and the
longer I'm on flights and I'm sitting

1371
01:27:22,971 --> 01:27:26,900
next to people with fucking flakes behind
their rears and they're getting up and

1372
01:27:26,901 --> 01:27:30,470
they're walking to the bathroom
without their fucking shoes on,

1373
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:36,440
and I'm listening to the male stewardess
on the mic. We have a very full flight,

1374
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:41,600
you know,
if he can feed,

1375
01:27:41,750 --> 01:27:45,610
if he can feed and if they can
fit in the seat and Frannie deal,

1376
01:27:45,620 --> 01:27:49,970
please be caring. Hands down the people
on the flight. And they never are.

1377
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:51,710
They never are.

1378
01:27:53,030 --> 01:27:56,780
People up there just stick and shit that
could easily fit in front of the seat

1379
01:27:56,781 --> 01:27:59,900
in front of them. And I swear to
God, man, it'd be like John Denver.

1380
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:04,280
I learned how to fly a plane and by some
experimental fucking thing and crashing

1381
01:28:04,281 --> 01:28:06,200
it in the side of him out.
That's the thing though. That's,

1382
01:28:06,201 --> 01:28:10,460
that's the ultimate right there.
That th I'll tell you right now,

1383
01:28:10,670 --> 01:28:13,130
if you guys want to know what
it's like to do the fucking road,

1384
01:28:13,430 --> 01:28:14,330
and I'm telling you right now,

1385
01:28:14,331 --> 01:28:18,680
I know salesman and people with
corporate jobs who have to fly around the

1386
01:28:18,681 --> 01:28:19,370
country.

1387
01:28:19,370 --> 01:28:24,230
What you do after a while as
you fantasize about the way,

1388
01:28:24,610 --> 01:28:26,750
um,
you want to do the road,

1389
01:28:27,080 --> 01:28:31,610
if you could do the fucking
road and I would love it.

1390
01:28:32,030 --> 01:28:35,060
I don't know if I could live in fucking
in the middle of nowhere like that, but,

1391
01:28:35,061 --> 01:28:38,510
well, let's just say I could,
so this would be the deal.

1392
01:28:39,650 --> 01:28:43,160
I live in the middle of nowhere
on the fucking Ponderosa, right?

1393
01:28:43,580 --> 01:28:46,510
Woodburn and stove.
It's,

1394
01:28:46,640 --> 01:28:50,600
it's like it's a fucking log cabin,
but you still got the flat screen.

1395
01:28:51,410 --> 01:28:55,250
I'll build a fucking ice rink out
back for the kids that I don't have,

1396
01:28:55,970 --> 01:28:56,803
you know,

1397
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:02,130
have like four fucking dogs
because who gives a shit?

1398
01:29:03,010 --> 01:29:06,000
You could buy a mansion for
like 1200 bucks out there.

1399
01:29:06,420 --> 01:29:11,400
Have like four fucking
dogs keep I get got Cleo,

1400
01:29:11,550 --> 01:29:14,910
I'll get a fucking, okay. Pitbull boxer,

1401
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:19,440
a fucking bulldog. And then
what else? I'd get a month.

1402
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:23,640
I mean a bloodhound. Yeah.
Something that likes to Howl,

1403
01:29:23,670 --> 01:29:26,340
but also likes to lay around,
you know,

1404
01:29:27,390 --> 01:29:30,300
do my MTV cribs. And rather than
have a bunch of fucking cars,

1405
01:29:30,301 --> 01:29:33,900
they'll have the baddest of the
Lamborghini, the Ferrari, the Porsche,

1406
01:29:34,380 --> 01:29:37,530
and the fucking dodge challenger.
A dog's right line. I'm,

1407
01:29:37,531 --> 01:29:40,500
I'm up in my fucking dirt driveway,

1408
01:29:44,750 --> 01:29:49,590
you know, and then down the street,
somehow I'd have my own pride. This is,

1409
01:29:49,591 --> 01:29:53,370
this is the ultimate, right? I'd
have my own fucking private jet. Oh.

1410
01:29:53,371 --> 01:29:56,550
Meanwhile the business is also
sending me fucking movie scripts.

1411
01:29:56,610 --> 01:30:00,990
Just offer me begging me, begging
me, not only to be in the movie,

1412
01:30:01,140 --> 01:30:05,250
but all I got to be is like the
fucking six lead. And when I show up,

1413
01:30:05,340 --> 01:30:09,450
they shoot all my shit. You
know, you have me for five days,

1414
01:30:09,451 --> 01:30:13,530
shoot all my fucking scenes and I'm that
guy who was in the movie like fucking

1415
01:30:13,531 --> 01:30:18,120
three, four times, but kills it. So I
keep my career going. This is the dream.

1416
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:23,700
Then I live in the middle of nowhere.
I fucking make my fucking, uh, God,

1417
01:30:23,701 --> 01:30:28,560
my garden in the back, fresh vegetables,
got a chicken coop every once in a while.

1418
01:30:28,561 --> 01:30:31,080
Who wants a fucking Burrito?
Hang on a second.

1419
01:30:31,260 --> 01:30:32,790
I'm going to go wring
the neck of something.

1420
01:30:32,791 --> 01:30:35,940
You grab it and you fucking
by the neck is how you do it.

1421
01:30:35,941 --> 01:30:40,470
You grab it by the neck and then you
spin their fucking body around and that's

1422
01:30:40,471 --> 01:30:44,970
it. All right. You have your
oldest son named John Boy,

1423
01:30:44,971 --> 01:30:46,350
and you have him plucked the shit.

1424
01:30:49,470 --> 01:30:54,210
You stick it in the set it and forget
it. You kept it as a joke, as a reminder,

1425
01:30:54,211 --> 01:30:57,390
a civilization. You fucking eat that
way. And then whenever I got a Gig,

1426
01:30:57,510 --> 01:31:01,500
I go down the fucking street
down the street, whatever,

1427
01:31:01,620 --> 01:31:04,720
rural road number 47,
and there's,

1428
01:31:04,840 --> 01:31:09,270
and there's a fucking airport and I
got my own jet and pilots on call.

1429
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,880
All right.
And in the back of the plane,

1430
01:31:11,881 --> 01:31:15,120
that's just a big goddamn bed
with a huge fucking seat belt.

1431
01:31:15,990 --> 01:31:20,000
And they fucking knock me out if
it's a long flight. If it isn't,

1432
01:31:20,010 --> 01:31:24,600
I just sit there shooting the shit
with the pilots. And that's what I do.

1433
01:31:24,640 --> 01:31:29,370
And then I fly in, I do the Gig, and
then I fucking go to a sporting event.

1434
01:31:29,371 --> 01:31:31,350
Then I fly back.
That's my fucking dream.

1435
01:31:32,010 --> 01:31:36,900
That's my dream of how I'd like to do
the road. How do you like that? Huh?

1436
01:31:37,230 --> 01:31:39,420
Booze is good on the podcast,
isn't it?

1437
01:31:39,610 --> 01:31:41,160
I hope I'm not going to
listen back to this one.

1438
01:31:41,161 --> 01:31:43,380
I'm not buzzed and think
that this is fucked up,

1439
01:31:43,381 --> 01:31:47,970
but that's something I would like to
do. Um, but I gotta be honest with you.

1440
01:31:47,971 --> 01:31:52,470
I don't think that I could
live in Wyoming or Montana.

1441
01:31:53,970 --> 01:31:57,510
Um,
I do think that I could live,

1442
01:31:59,050 --> 01:31:59,980
where could I live?
I

1443
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:03,220
could live in parts of Pennsylvania,

1444
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:06,970
Connecticut,
upstate New York,

1445
01:32:08,590 --> 01:32:10,450
parts of northern New Jersey.

1446
01:32:12,280 --> 01:32:15,880
Uh,
maybe western Massachusetts.

1447
01:32:18,310 --> 01:32:20,920
I Dunno.
Maybe Northern California.

1448
01:32:20,950 --> 01:32:25,150
We get up there and they got some
redwoods and shit. I don't know.

1449
01:32:25,151 --> 01:32:28,720
That's fucked up, man. It's scary. You
want to do something fucked up. Go, uh,

1450
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:33,400
go on a, go on Google maps and just, uh,

1451
01:32:33,430 --> 01:32:37,480
just look at Montana and then just pick,
um,

1452
01:32:37,540 --> 01:32:41,830
pick a town and then hit
satellite. And then just, you know,

1453
01:32:42,070 --> 01:32:46,510
drop that little man and then just go
down a fucking street and you'll see what

1454
01:32:46,511 --> 01:32:50,950
it's like out there. You know?
And if you don't hear Banjo music,

1455
01:32:50,951 --> 01:32:54,730
you're not a fucking human being. It's
scary. I'd love to go out there, man.

1456
01:32:54,731 --> 01:32:57,790
I want to check it out. You know, just
see what the fuck is going on up there.

1457
01:32:58,080 --> 01:33:00,580
I actually know a guy who has
a gig out in fucking Montana.

1458
01:33:00,580 --> 01:33:03,190
I've actually was thinking about
doing it just cause I've never been,

1459
01:33:03,880 --> 01:33:06,520
never been out that way. Um, all right,

1460
01:33:06,521 --> 01:33:11,320
let's get on with the overrated underrated
now or continue with it, I should say.

1461
01:33:11,380 --> 01:33:16,330
Uh, to do overrated. The word.

1462
01:33:16,360 --> 01:33:20,080
Oh, I like this one. Overrated.
The, the use of the word countless.

1463
01:33:20,830 --> 01:33:22,900
I hear it on the news all the time.

1464
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:27,010
This tragedy has left countless
numbers of people homeless.

1465
01:33:27,730 --> 01:33:32,650
That's bullshit. I think there are
like six or 7 billion people on earth.

1466
01:33:32,920 --> 01:33:37,570
I know the numeric system works.
I can count to 7 billion. Hell,

1467
01:33:37,750 --> 01:33:41,110
I could count to 7
trillion given enough time.

1468
01:33:41,410 --> 01:33:44,170
I'm not saying the tragedies
that happen aren't bad,

1469
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:48,760
but trying to jack up the fear quotient
by making it sound like the number of

1470
01:33:48,761 --> 01:33:53,230
people affected is just too
big to comprehend is bullshit.

1471
01:33:54,010 --> 01:33:57,940
I liked that. I never noticed that.
Leaving countless people homeless.

1472
01:33:58,870 --> 01:34:02,500
Uh, what do you mean by the
actually 1,247? Well, you know what?

1473
01:34:02,501 --> 01:34:03,670
I think I could count that high.

1474
01:34:05,530 --> 01:34:09,220
Are you saying that you don't care
about the homeless? No. You dumb cunt.

1475
01:34:10,060 --> 01:34:14,290
I'm saying that I can count that
high. So it's not countless. 1200 is,

1476
01:34:14,291 --> 01:34:17,590
it's countable leaving
countable people homeless.

1477
01:34:18,280 --> 01:34:19,840
This guy is absolutely right.
Or this woman,

1478
01:34:19,841 --> 01:34:22,480
whoever wrote it in
absolutely fucking right.

1479
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:27,840
You are absolutely fucking correct
on that one. Uh, underrated, uh,

1480
01:34:27,910 --> 01:34:29,770
animated shows on TV today.

1481
01:34:29,771 --> 01:34:33,070
The Simpsons and family guy
are legitimately well done.

1482
01:34:33,071 --> 01:34:35,980
Shows and South Park to a lesser degree.
Dude,

1483
01:34:35,981 --> 01:34:39,940
I think South Park is still the best.
I'd go South Park,

1484
01:34:39,941 --> 01:34:41,770
the Simpsons and then the family guy.

1485
01:34:42,130 --> 01:34:46,930
South Park has the best social commentary
on TV. But I have to tell you this,

1486
01:34:46,931 --> 01:34:51,190
I don't watch that show. What the
fuck is it? I always mean to watch it.

1487
01:34:51,190 --> 01:34:55,290
It comes on Sunday night. The, uh,

1488
01:34:56,290 --> 01:35:00,860
I had, fuck do I describe
it? It's the, uh,

1489
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:04,640
African American one. There
we go. Come on. You know it.

1490
01:35:05,390 --> 01:35:07,580
I don't know what it is,
but I heard that one is the shit.

1491
01:35:07,820 --> 01:35:12,290
What the fuck is the name of it? I can't
remember. I heard that one's awesome.

1492
01:35:12,291 --> 01:35:15,560
I got to get into watching that. I always
say I'm going to, and then I never do.

1493
01:35:16,670 --> 01:35:20,150
And there's also a billboard I've seen
on sunset boulevard out here for that

1494
01:35:20,151 --> 01:35:23,000
show. Children's hospital.
It looks creepy as hell.

1495
01:35:23,300 --> 01:35:27,350
And it's on a adult swim.
That's what I'm trying to say.

1496
01:35:27,351 --> 01:35:31,700
Adult swim is what that other, the
Boondocks, right? Is that the name of it?

1497
01:35:31,970 --> 01:35:35,090
And then there's the, um, I heard
that children's hospital is great.

1498
01:35:35,990 --> 01:35:39,170
I want to check that one out too.
All right. Um, what are we doing?

1499
01:35:39,590 --> 01:35:43,850
Where are we going? They hit OK. Ko, um,
cartoons that they have good writing,

1500
01:35:43,851 --> 01:35:47,690
good plot points and legitimate social
commentary. Totally agree on all of them.

1501
01:35:48,680 --> 01:35:52,580
This is what pisses me off though. I can
tell you that the number of times it's,

1502
01:35:52,581 --> 01:35:55,460
someone will ask me what
I've watched on television.

1503
01:35:55,610 --> 01:35:59,840
I will give them the plot of a Simpsons
episode, not mentioning any names,

1504
01:36:00,530 --> 01:36:05,450
um, or the fact that it's a cartoon and
they will tell me how funny they think it

1505
01:36:05,451 --> 01:36:08,750
is. But then when I tell them it's
the Simpsons of the family guy,

1506
01:36:08,751 --> 01:36:10,790
it's a Simpson or a family guy episode.

1507
01:36:11,060 --> 01:36:15,860
All of a sudden they turn their noses
up and say that they're adults and they

1508
01:36:15,861 --> 01:36:19,940
don't watch cartoons anymore.
What the fuck is up with that?

1509
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,730
A funny show is a funny show,
Dude. I couldn't agree with more.

1510
01:36:23,330 --> 01:36:24,320
I couldn't agree with you more.

1511
01:36:25,610 --> 01:36:29,030
Let me take the last fucking Swig here
and I'm going to, uh, I'm going to,

1512
01:36:29,031 --> 01:36:32,350
I'm going to finish this thing off and
I'm gonna Finish up the podcast. Um,

1513
01:36:33,260 --> 01:36:37,220
here's something that I have learned
on a, on the podcast. Hang on a second.

1514
01:36:37,221 --> 01:36:40,220
Here we go. Let me get a little
more, a little more happy juice here.

1515
01:36:43,550 --> 01:36:46,080
Oh God. Damn. That's fucking perfect. Um,

1516
01:36:48,110 --> 01:36:50,590
anyways. Oh, by the way, uh,

1517
01:36:51,260 --> 01:36:54,590
I've been watching a lot of
the old Jackie Gleason. Um,

1518
01:36:54,620 --> 01:36:57,770
I used to watch him when I was a kid
and I never really noticed how many the,

1519
01:36:57,860 --> 01:37:01,850
the oldest shows.
It was weird.

1520
01:37:01,851 --> 01:37:04,220
I don't know what it was
because I came up in the 70s.

1521
01:37:04,970 --> 01:37:08,480
You have to understand that a lot of
the original shows weren't filmed,

1522
01:37:08,900 --> 01:37:13,370
so there was no syndication. That was
the brilliance of Ricky Ricardo there.

1523
01:37:14,220 --> 01:37:17,570
Uh, what's his face there? Ricky
Ricardo was his character named,

1524
01:37:18,230 --> 01:37:19,370
um,

1525
01:37:20,330 --> 01:37:25,330
Desi Arnaz that he actually
had the brilliance to film.

1526
01:37:26,150 --> 01:37:30,380
I love you. I love Lucy and get
the rights for the old episodes.

1527
01:37:30,381 --> 01:37:35,381
Like nobody in the business for saw
the money in reruns and they just,

1528
01:37:35,811 --> 01:37:39,140
they signed off and just gave them to
them basically for fucking nothing.

1529
01:37:39,470 --> 01:37:44,440
So anyways, it wasn't a lot of reruns.
Certainly from the 1950s. There's,

1530
01:37:44,470 --> 01:37:49,340
you know, a lot of those live shows, they
just went live and that was it. But, um,

1531
01:37:49,430 --> 01:37:53,930
so like what am I trying to
say? And actually television
was I this how old I am.

1532
01:37:53,931 --> 01:37:56,010
Television for the most
as far as the golden

1533
01:37:56,010 --> 01:37:56,880
age of television,

1534
01:37:57,150 --> 01:38:01,620
right up was only 20 years old
and there was only three networks.

1535
01:38:01,621 --> 01:38:03,540
So you basically got the best of the best.

1536
01:38:03,541 --> 01:38:05,550
And I used to watch like
the Jackie Gleason show,

1537
01:38:05,551 --> 01:38:08,340
they used to show reruns
of the Dean Martin show.

1538
01:38:08,341 --> 01:38:10,860
I know this makes me sound like
I'm older than fucking dirt,

1539
01:38:10,861 --> 01:38:14,310
but they used to play it. They
supply all that shit, three stooges,

1540
01:38:14,311 --> 01:38:15,180
all that type of shit.

1541
01:38:15,181 --> 01:38:18,780
And I used to watch the Jackie Gleason
show and he had this character,

1542
01:38:18,781 --> 01:38:21,900
Reginald van Gleason.
And um,

1543
01:38:23,220 --> 01:38:26,220
I don't know the character,
he just had this little brown mustache.

1544
01:38:26,730 --> 01:38:28,140
And before he would say anything,

1545
01:38:28,141 --> 01:38:31,950
he would cuss sort of hum and
then say whatever he said.

1546
01:38:31,951 --> 01:38:34,310
And I watched one the other
day where he was playing, uh,

1547
01:38:34,710 --> 01:38:36,330
just trying to solve a murder mystery.

1548
01:38:36,920 --> 01:38:41,920
And he comes walking in on this
couple is a dead body in there and a,

1549
01:38:42,330 --> 01:38:46,110
but before he starts questioning
them about the murder,

1550
01:38:46,710 --> 01:38:50,550
he actually sees a wet bar.
So he just puts his index finger up.

1551
01:38:50,580 --> 01:38:54,310
This is why I'd love to, but
Jackie Gleason was how, um,

1552
01:38:54,570 --> 01:38:58,740
without saying anything, he free
could go for like, you know,

1553
01:38:58,890 --> 01:39:03,750
minutes on end without saying anything
and just have you dying laughing. And He,

1554
01:39:03,800 --> 01:39:06,150
and, and he never rehearsed
either and he just fucked.

1555
01:39:06,151 --> 01:39:11,151
He puts his finger up and after he sees
the bar and he walks over to the wet bar

1556
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:15,690
and he does all this exaggerated
shit of making the drink,

1557
01:39:15,691 --> 01:39:19,470
but before he walks with a second,
he's explaining this wrong, whatever,

1558
01:39:19,710 --> 01:39:22,260
he comes walking over to the bar,
the second he sees it,

1559
01:39:22,290 --> 01:39:26,520
he just goes booze,
right?

1560
01:39:26,550 --> 01:39:31,200
And it gets this huge fucking laugh.
I Dunno. I don't even know the,

1561
01:39:31,201 --> 01:39:33,090
I just love that old school shit.

1562
01:39:33,091 --> 01:39:37,920
We're fucking drinking and having
a drinking problem is funny.

1563
01:39:38,010 --> 01:39:38,550
This guy,

1564
01:39:38,550 --> 01:39:41,970
this is a dead body in the room and he's
going to make himself a drink first.

1565
01:39:41,970 --> 01:39:42,960
He obviously has,

1566
01:39:43,330 --> 01:39:46,680
he's preop priorities are out of
fucking whack and nobody gives a shit.

1567
01:39:46,681 --> 01:39:51,210
So whatever. But anyways, this last week
of this podcast, I really learned, man,

1568
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:56,400
uh, how to do, uh, if I ever
want to do a fucking radio show,

1569
01:39:56,820 --> 01:39:57,630
there's three,

1570
01:39:57,630 --> 01:40:02,630
there's three topics that get me the
most email responses of either I totally

1571
01:40:05,341 --> 01:40:08,220
agree with you or you're fucking
annoying the shit out of me.

1572
01:40:08,250 --> 01:40:12,780
And they are politics,
sports and,

1573
01:40:12,781 --> 01:40:17,700
uh, in Jesus or any sort of religion.
If I go off on any of those,

1574
01:40:18,840 --> 01:40:22,160
like, uh, you know,
trashing the fucking, uh,

1575
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:26,460
[inaudible] what did I do a
few weeks ago I trashed, um,

1576
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:30,510
New York and the Knicks. I got all
these fucking emails from Knicks fans,

1577
01:40:30,511 --> 01:40:35,130
you know, last week I trashed the fucking,
uh, I didn't think I trashed the Lakers.

1578
01:40:35,131 --> 01:40:39,300
I thought it was just talking
about Kobe versus, um, um, Jordan.

1579
01:40:39,780 --> 01:40:40,231
But,
uh,

1580
01:40:40,231 --> 01:40:45,231
all these fucking Laker fans just
fucking writing in writing and capital

1581
01:40:46,801 --> 01:40:50,940
letters, flipping the fuck
out. And, uh, I dunno,

1582
01:40:51,630 --> 01:40:56,630
this podcast has been very in like
in like that level where it's like,

1583
01:40:57,600 --> 01:41:00,210
if I ever do a fucking radio show,
which I don't think I will,

1584
01:41:00,211 --> 01:41:03,870
I like doing this shit better.
And I always felt when I did on informed,

1585
01:41:03,871 --> 01:41:05,550
when we were actually able
to do episodes of that,

1586
01:41:05,551 --> 01:41:09,260
I always felt the collars
slowed down the show, you know,

1587
01:41:09,261 --> 01:41:11,420
and it was so many people just
fucking with you or whatever.

1588
01:41:11,421 --> 01:41:12,650
But if I ever get a situation,

1589
01:41:12,651 --> 01:41:15,740
I have to do a radio show
and I want to get college.

1590
01:41:15,770 --> 01:41:20,770
Those are the three fucking magic topics
that just get people flipping the fuck

1591
01:41:22,321 --> 01:41:27,130
out. I guess the fourth would be a fee
if you trash one of the sexist, you know,

1592
01:41:27,400 --> 01:41:28,600
I don't even,
what the fuck I'm saying here?

1593
01:41:28,601 --> 01:41:32,920
I'm just enjoying the nice buzz of one
fucking beer. That's a great thing to do.

1594
01:41:32,921 --> 01:41:33,341
Drink up,

1595
01:41:33,341 --> 01:41:38,240
drink a 16 ounce [inaudible] really
good beer on an empty fucking stomach,

1596
01:41:39,380 --> 01:41:40,213
you know,

1597
01:41:40,230 --> 01:41:44,580
and do a God damn podcast and tell me
you're not proud to be a fucking American.

1598
01:41:45,390 --> 01:41:47,250
All right, that's it. Okay.

1599
01:41:47,251 --> 01:41:50,100
I think we had a little bit of something
for everybody here. Wind chimes,

1600
01:41:50,101 --> 01:41:52,860
booze reminiscing, telling you my, my,

1601
01:41:52,890 --> 01:41:55,590
my dreams of how I want to
live in the fucking future.

1602
01:41:56,580 --> 01:42:01,140
I guess none of which included having
a spouse or children. Fucking creepy.

1603
01:42:01,141 --> 01:42:03,330
Is that, uh, that's it.

1604
01:42:03,331 --> 01:42:08,210
That's the podcast here that I
did it on a Thursday and I'm,

1605
01:42:08,220 --> 01:42:10,830
hopefully I'm going to try to
do Letterman again next week.

1606
01:42:11,010 --> 01:42:15,870
My set is more than ready to go and I'll
try to give you the heads up this time

1607
01:42:15,871 --> 01:42:20,580
if I, if I get bumped. Uh, but
whatever. It's actually, I actually,

1608
01:42:20,581 --> 01:42:23,700
I'm kind of psyched that I got bumped
because there's nothing cooler than going

1609
01:42:23,701 --> 01:42:27,330
to the Ed Sullivan Theater. It's just a
shit and you just, you come up beforehand,

1610
01:42:27,690 --> 01:42:30,930
they show you where your mark is and as
much as is showing you where your mark

1611
01:42:30,931 --> 01:42:33,690
is, you sit, sit in and God, Jesus
Christ, the fucking Beatles were here,

1612
01:42:34,200 --> 01:42:38,500
the stones were here, the doors came as
well. The doors came out and then, and,

1613
01:42:38,501 --> 01:42:39,420
and Jim Morrison,

1614
01:42:39,820 --> 01:42:44,050
whatever the fuck he wasn't supposed
to say. He said, it's incredible.

1615
01:42:44,110 --> 01:42:45,620
It's an incredible,
uh,

1616
01:42:45,830 --> 01:42:50,830
it's one of the few things left in show
business that is still as big as show

1617
01:42:51,451 --> 01:42:54,780
business was back in the day before
it all got splintered into like 400,

1618
01:42:55,230 --> 01:42:59,330
400 different channels. Um, so whatever,

1619
01:42:59,360 --> 01:43:01,910
all you young comics out there and never
done, let them, and I'm telling you,

1620
01:43:01,911 --> 01:43:06,650
it's not going to fucking disappoint
you. It's a, it's a huge thrill.

1621
01:43:06,651 --> 01:43:10,310
And this is my fifth time doing it and
I'm beyond excited and I'm really hoping

1622
01:43:10,311 --> 01:43:13,580
I get to get on this weekend. Ah, that's
it. That's the podcast for this week.

1623
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:16,380
I hope all you guys enjoyed it.
And

1624
01:43:17,790 --> 01:43:18,940
I will talk to you next week.

1625
01:43:19,470 --> 01:43:24,470
He's [inaudible].
