1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:01,360
Yeah.

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:02,230
Hey,
what's going on?

3
00:00:02,231 --> 00:00:05,050
Is Bill burn his time for the
Monday morning podcast for Monday,

4
00:00:05,051 --> 00:00:09,450
April 10th, 2017 what's
going on? How is Yah,

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:16,030
how's it going everybody?
You're doing good. I apologize
that the podcast is late.

6
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:20,620
I apologize that it's laid I a,
he was flying back from San Antonio.

7
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:21,700
I meant to do it yesterday,

8
00:00:21,701 --> 00:00:25,870
but I was doing a tour of San Antonio
and the day got away from me, you know,

9
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,940
I was going all around San Antonio,

10
00:00:27,941 --> 00:00:31,030
went out to Jeff Wright drum shop.

11
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,110
I got some Mexican food around the
corner that was fucking delicious.

12
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:39,370
Um, I forget the name of that place,
but it's going to be on the video.

13
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:44,530
Then it went down to the river,
walk it over to the stupid fucking Alamo.

14
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:49,840
Jesus Christ, just crawling
with fucking tourist reenactors,

15
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:53,950
all kinds of magnets and shit.
And I just was like the, you know,

16
00:00:53,951 --> 00:00:55,450
every time I go to San Antonio I was like,

17
00:00:55,451 --> 00:00:58,870
I'm going to fucking go in there and I
want to read up on all these guys who

18
00:00:58,871 --> 00:01:00,910
fought to the last guy
I'm going to read up on.

19
00:01:00,911 --> 00:01:05,110
Every time I get there there's like
9,000 people in Jean shorts is a fucking

20
00:01:05,111 --> 00:01:08,770
gift shop and I just say forget
it. I felt bad about it. Like, Hey,

21
00:01:08,771 --> 00:01:10,150
what do you know? What do
you not patriotic? Then

22
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:11,780
Bill,
you know?

23
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:14,570
Then I ran into somebody from San Antonio,

24
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:18,080
you ever go into this thing and they go,
no, we live here. And I was like, oh,

25
00:01:18,081 --> 00:01:18,914
I get it.
No,

26
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:20,253
I get it.

27
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,460
The Alamo is your time square. If like
nobody in New York goes to Times Square.

28
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:27,920
Okay.

29
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,920
Nobody in La goes to fucking Disneyland
or fucking universal unless you have

30
00:01:33,351 --> 00:01:33,621
kids.

31
00:01:33,621 --> 00:01:35,960
But I mean just as an adult you're not
going to do now is just going to fucking

32
00:01:35,961 --> 00:01:40,640
go there. You know you don't stand in
line in your own fucking town. Okay.

33
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:44,900
One of the advantages of it being your
own fucking town is you don't have to

34
00:01:44,901 --> 00:01:47,660
stand in line with everybody else.
Cause you know all the spots.

35
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:50,360
You know where to go,
you know where not to go.

36
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:55,670
And when you're in San Antonio,
where not to go is the fucking Alamo,

37
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:57,680
unless you're a goddamn tourist.

38
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:00,680
Then you'd go in there and then you're
going to go over to the river walk,

39
00:02:00,681 --> 00:02:03,770
which is actually for a touristy thing,
was very nice. That man made river.

40
00:02:03,771 --> 00:02:06,360
I got to tell you something.
That's the first time I walked down and I,

41
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:09,380
I liked it.
I really enjoyed it.

42
00:02:09,381 --> 00:02:12,530
There was a bunch of people standing
outside getting a little hustle going on,

43
00:02:12,531 --> 00:02:15,440
trying to get you to go in
and drink a Margarita. Right?

44
00:02:15,441 --> 00:02:17,890
All kinds of wacky
people wearing the hats.

45
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:21,830
People driving by on the little gondolas,
you know, it was like he went Venice,

46
00:02:21,831 --> 00:02:26,600
but it was Texas right there.
Little slice of fucking Italy,

47
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,700
you know. And then right around
the corner was the majestic.

48
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,013
Yeah,

49
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:37,550
very ornate. The word only use to
describe a theater. Very ornate. Hey,

50
00:02:37,551 --> 00:02:40,820
my buddy redid his garage. Oh, it's,
it's beautiful. It's so ornate.

51
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:44,990
Nobody ever says that, right? To say they
call it a fucking man cave. It was. Okay.

52
00:02:44,991 --> 00:02:48,320
So the man caves for fucking,
you know, the twinkle toes there.

53
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:51,500
The Broadway stars are these theaters
and this thing had like a, I mean,

54
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:55,580
it had like fucking houses and she
looks on Peter Pan Stuff was amazing.

55
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,870
And evidently while I was on stage,
it was a flying around.

56
00:02:59,871 --> 00:03:03,820
They went past me and aside
the fact that it was a bat,

57
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:07,570
like nobody even reacted. They're so used
to bats down there. Evidently they, uh,

58
00:03:07,571 --> 00:03:11,260
they kill all the fucking mosquitoes are
enough of them. You know what I mean?

59
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:15,690
So people in San Antonio
evidently cool with bats. I Dunno.

60
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:16,870
But I had two great shows,

61
00:03:16,871 --> 00:03:20,020
the first show when awesome in the
second show was just fucking next level.

62
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,400
And I actually texted my agent, I was
like, the hours ready, and he was like,

63
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:28,960
really? And I'm like, yes. So let's fill
up the calendar. They have, fuck, oh no,

64
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,640
that's not how I talk to my agent. Um,
I go, let's fill up the full, you know,

65
00:03:33,641 --> 00:03:36,940
let's fill up the fucking calendar.
So his mission should,

66
00:03:36,941 --> 00:03:41,470
he chooses to accept that he's going to
fill up my calendar and then in I gave

67
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:46,471
him the list of the eight teams that
I have left that I need to go see.

68
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,330
All right,
so if you're on this list,

69
00:03:49,331 --> 00:03:53,530
I'll be doing a show at some point within
the next fucking year cause I'm not

70
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,760
these out in the next year before my
daughter starts walking and talking and

71
00:03:57,761 --> 00:03:59,920
doing all that stuff.
I got to knock this out.

72
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:05,140
So I need the Toronto Raptors,
the Auto Isac

73
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:09,790
playing my Boston Bruins and
the first round of the playoffs.

74
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:13,290
Congratulations to both teams making
the playoffs. It's a big deal. Playoffs.

75
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,890
I'll wait. No, no, no. Wait. Are we
playing them? I think we are playing on,

76
00:04:16,891 --> 00:04:20,080
which makes no fucking sense to me.
Fucking hockey.

77
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:23,740
If we'd like the aid seat,
should we play the capital's?

78
00:04:23,741 --> 00:04:28,270
Shouldn't the capital's be rewarded that
they won their fucking division rather

79
00:04:28,271 --> 00:04:31,360
than having to play the fucking penguins
and then they knock one another out and

80
00:04:31,361 --> 00:04:34,090
all we got to do is try to get
past the senators. No disrespect,

81
00:04:34,091 --> 00:04:38,020
but disrespect intended. I'm
just being honest. All right,

82
00:04:38,021 --> 00:04:41,410
let's check this shit out right now.
Okay? You know this isn't going to work.

83
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:44,340
You know it's not I, you know I'm
going to be on the wrong fucking one.

84
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,420
The Boston Celtics or a second seed.

85
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:51,010
They're a fucking second seed
there. All right. Hang on a second.

86
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:55,090
And H L playoff

87
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,640
bracket. All right,
here we go. And it fail.

88
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:04,960
Nhl fucking playoff
bracket. All right. Yes,

89
00:05:04,961 --> 00:05:07,390
this is what the fuck I want.
You gonna make me click on it again.

90
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:10,450
I typed what I wanted and then he like,
is this what you want? Yes, this is,

91
00:05:10,451 --> 00:05:15,430
this is what I want. All right.
The ranges of verse Canadians,

92
00:05:15,431 --> 00:05:19,690
the Bruins. Get the senators. I don't get
it. Capital's get the maple leafs. Okay.

93
00:05:19,691 --> 00:05:22,960
All right. All right. All
right. I thought. And then
coal, there's a good one.

94
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:27,970
Columbus first of penguins that
[inaudible] Nashville predators made the

95
00:05:28,331 --> 00:05:32,200
playoffs playing the black hawks,
Minnesota wild versus the St Louis Blues.

96
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,810
And I'm ducks first. The Calgary
flames in the San Jose shacks first.

97
00:05:36,811 --> 00:05:39,850
Edmonton Oilers, Eh, we go,

98
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,050
Brad Marshawn is back and all
of that shit. So anyways, yeah,

99
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:48,310
I got to get the Toronto Raptors
auto senators. I got to get a,

100
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,740
the Brooklyn Nets.
I've already seen the New Jersey Nets,

101
00:05:50,741 --> 00:05:53,320
but my rule is if you get a new stadium,
I don't give a fuck.

102
00:05:53,321 --> 00:05:57,920
I'll eventually see it. But if you
move to a new city, especially a state,

103
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,063
you know,

104
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:03,920
then yeah, I got to go fucking
see you again. All right.

105
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,370
I need the Carolina Hurricanes,
Orlando Magic,

106
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,290
Tampa Bay Buccaneers,

107
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,050
the Memphis Grizzlies and
the New Orleans Pelicans.

108
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,750
So there you go. So I'm going
to try to get, you know,

109
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:22,280
I probably do the Canadian ones at the
same trip and I'll try to do the fucking,

110
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:25,460
um,
Orlando Tampa at the same time.

111
00:06:25,461 --> 00:06:28,940
Then I think I'm going to do a bus
trip to knock out those fucking three

112
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:34,040
Carolina fucking Memphis and New Orleans.

113
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,260
I think that that's what I'm
gonna do and then it'll be done.

114
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,280
And then what we do build,

115
00:06:37,281 --> 00:06:40,520
well you know what I'll do is I'll
move on to fucking college. All right.

116
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:43,400
Cause the day I go out on the road and
I don't have something to fucking look

117
00:06:43,401 --> 00:06:46,220
forward to and I just sit in the God damn
hotel waiting for the show. That's it.

118
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,180
I'm going to dry up.

119
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:49,870
You hear me dry?

120
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:53,581
So anyways,

121
00:06:53,581 --> 00:06:58,581
I got Boise coming up and I just got an
email from the CEO via my agent saying,

122
00:06:58,681 --> 00:07:02,010
Hey, we've been watching these videos,
seen a bill, likes to play the drums.

123
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:05,550
What if we rented a drum kit and put
it in the theater during the day and if

124
00:07:05,551 --> 00:07:08,790
Phil wants to play during the day,
he can come in and play for like an hour.

125
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:13,950
How fucking great is that? It's the
coolest thing ever. I made, I'm a put my,

126
00:07:13,951 --> 00:07:15,300
put that on my fucking writer.

127
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,760
I don't give a shit how much
it costs because this is
the thing that we say, hey,

128
00:07:17,761 --> 00:07:20,730
we'll do that for you. And then they
just, you know, they pay me less money.

129
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:27,630
That's how it works now. God Damn
it. This isn't in fucking stereo.

130
00:07:27,631 --> 00:07:31,320
I just realized that,
wait a sec, wait a second.

131
00:07:31,321 --> 00:07:35,100
She let me see something. There we go. Oh,

132
00:07:35,101 --> 00:07:38,640
you fucking son of a bitch.
That's not it.

133
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:42,570
How do I get this thing in stereo?
You know,

134
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,280
this is just one of these
fucking days, isn't it? Isn't it?

135
00:07:45,281 --> 00:07:47,790
It's just one of these days.
Now I'm just going to push buttons.

136
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:52,230
What's going on there it is.
Now it's in Stereo.

137
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:57,000
Oh, Jesus Christ. I thought there
was something wrong with the wire.

138
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:01,850
My fault. Well, you had to suffer
for seven 53. I'll let you know.

139
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,900
I'll just say that it isn't, you
know this, he know something.

140
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:06,690
You know what's great about it? It'll
give you something to complain about.

141
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,700
You know, unless the Great Andrew
Feminist fixes the fucking thing. I Dunno.

142
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:16,080
Anyways, plowing ahead here. Um,

143
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,810
so what else? Okay. So I went
down there and I saw, uh,

144
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:25,340
I saw a lot of San Antonio this time.
Like I said, I had great fucking shows.

145
00:08:25,341 --> 00:08:26,810
You know what? Who's kidding, who? I lost.

146
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,960
I completely lost my train of thought
cause now I'm fucking mad at myself.

147
00:08:29,961 --> 00:08:31,940
Why didn't I think that?
Just fucking push that button.

148
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:34,760
I immediately thought it was the wire.

149
00:08:34,761 --> 00:08:39,410
I troubleshooted I never
knowingly lied about the wire.

150
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,850
Um, all right, so now I know what you
guys are thinking. Hey Bill, you know,

151
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,700
you said that you were going to watch
some alternative sports this weekend.

152
00:08:46,701 --> 00:08:48,770
You said you were going
to watch the masters,

153
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:53,480
the Moto GP fucking Formula One.
Well,

154
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:57,590
all fucking Billy freckled the Fed tinted,
no glued,

155
00:08:57,591 --> 00:09:00,500
haven't fucking cunt.
I did two out of three.

156
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:04,040
I watched the moto GP.
You know what's hilarious?

157
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:07,460
I didn't realize that there was two
undercard motorcycle races and I'm sitting

158
00:09:07,461 --> 00:09:11,120
there going like this fucking race. It
was only 20 laps. What's going on here,

159
00:09:11,121 --> 00:09:15,830
right? The first one was the GP three
then or something. The Moto three,

160
00:09:15,831 --> 00:09:18,950
then the moto two. And then,
uh, then there was the last one.

161
00:09:18,951 --> 00:09:22,010
So I kind of fast forward
through the first two. And
then I watched the whole, um,

162
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,260
I watched the whole a moto GP,
uh, the real fucking one. And,

163
00:09:27,261 --> 00:09:29,250
uh,
congratulations to a,

164
00:09:29,251 --> 00:09:32,930
I don't even have to say this
guy's named maverick finales.

165
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:37,400
You know, I saw that mark, mark and
Berg, whatever his fucking name is,

166
00:09:37,401 --> 00:09:40,760
he was cruising around and all of a sudden
he just didn't make this turn and he

167
00:09:40,761 --> 00:09:44,990
was very upset with himself.
That's his name. Mark Menendez.

168
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:50,600
That's old is this again, I'll kill
this fucking did he kill his parents?

169
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,300
I don't know what happened. And then, uh,

170
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,420
Valentino Rossi came in
second and both of them,

171
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,510
they seem very excited about that. You
know what I mean? They got some points,

172
00:09:59,511 --> 00:10:02,810
they felt good about themselves and,
uh, I gotta tell you something, man,

173
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,420
those fucking guys and you
gotta check out the Moto Gp.

174
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:06,650
Okay.

175
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:11,150
It's unfuckable the amount of crashes
that I saw too in all three of those

176
00:10:11,151 --> 00:10:14,760
races. There was one guy who
was going through the turn.

177
00:10:14,761 --> 00:10:17,460
He started to accelerate in the backend,
kind of kicked a little bit.

178
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,390
So he got off it,

179
00:10:18,391 --> 00:10:22,500
then he got back on it and the fucking
the God damn bike had I had a seizure,

180
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:28,540
fucking did a couple little ss then just
like started slipping over and then the

181
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:32,590
guy of course fee flies off
the damn thing. It hits him
in the back of the head.

182
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:36,980
It amazes me that they get back up again.
Those suits they have are incredible.

183
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:38,950
They got little air bags in them and shit,

184
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:41,920
but still they always end up fucking up
their hands or their ankles or something

185
00:10:41,921 --> 00:10:45,760
like that. But this Guy Kinda high sided
on it, which is basically, you know,

186
00:10:45,761 --> 00:10:48,870
if you're a novice like me when they
just sort of lay it down and the bikes

187
00:10:48,871 --> 00:10:50,260
starts sliding and then you just Kinda,

188
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,490
you just touch the ground and slide
with the fucking thing hi sightings.

189
00:10:54,491 --> 00:10:57,820
When it hits the ground and you
fucking catapult over the top of it,

190
00:10:57,821 --> 00:11:00,370
the high side of it.
And that's when you get,

191
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:05,410
seems to me that's when you get
fucking hurt. Um, it's ridiculous.

192
00:11:05,411 --> 00:11:09,460
They're going like 200 miles an hour in
something that you can just fall off of.

193
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:12,850
Um,
but I enjoyed the race immensely.

194
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,000
I enjoyed that race as much as you guys
probably didn't enjoy the first seven

195
00:11:16,001 --> 00:11:16,271
minutes.

196
00:11:16,271 --> 00:11:21,271
53 seconds of fucking no stereo
on this m I n I then I watched,

197
00:11:22,991 --> 00:11:27,991
I watched the masters too and I could
not be happier for Varage Sergio Garcia.

198
00:11:28,451 --> 00:11:29,770
I man, I just, you know,

199
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:34,630
it's one of the things about being at
his level when you go that long without

200
00:11:34,631 --> 00:11:35,700
winning is that gives you,

201
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:40,900
it gives every mouth breathing Haagen
daas eating fucking Douche bag who never

202
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:41,920
achieved anything.

203
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:45,460
The right to walk up to you and start
telling you about how you can't get it

204
00:11:45,461 --> 00:11:48,610
done. You know what I mean? Sitting
there wearing a wife beater with you.

205
00:11:48,611 --> 00:11:51,970
Flabby Grandmother fucking arms.
You know,

206
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:57,060
just given this Guy Shit, when he missed
that one on 18 I was like, oh God.

207
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,540
Oh boy, here we go. Here we
go. Shades and Kenny Perry,

208
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,830
is this what we're going to see again?

209
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,650
And actually every year when I
watched the masters, you know,

210
00:12:04,651 --> 00:12:07,590
I don't watch it every year. I shouldn't
say that, but every time I watch it,

211
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:12,860
somebody always folds in the back nine
and I actually get mad at the tournament.

212
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,880
I always ended up, you know,
I was actually texting my,

213
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:20,890
I was texting that court
who did the live um,

214
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:25,350
final day of the masters
and I was just like, dude,

215
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,480
can somebody just win this fucking event?

216
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:31,830
Does anybody ever just when the masters,
no one ever wins the masters.

217
00:12:31,831 --> 00:12:35,790
Somebody fucking loses it every year
and you just have to watch somebody.

218
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:40,680
Like a buddy of mine tested me, uh,
texted me test it, texted me and said,

219
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:43,530
uh, it, Sergio doesn't win this playoff.

220
00:12:43,531 --> 00:12:46,050
He said that punt Wa
that pot will haunt him.

221
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:47,690
Okay.

222
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:49,430
It's like, no it won't. It will.

223
00:12:49,431 --> 00:12:52,990
But you know what's going to haunt him
is every cheesecake factory and Douche

224
00:12:52,991 --> 00:12:56,480
bag walking up to him,
Hey, remember that time,

225
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:01,250
you know, giving him shit, right.

226
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:04,820
Not Realizing that that ms pot is a
fucking metaphor for the other person's

227
00:13:04,821 --> 00:13:09,030
entire goddamn existence. This guys played
in over 70 something major. So anyway,

228
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:12,560
it's just like watching Phil Mickelson
when it way back in the day and like,

229
00:13:12,561 --> 00:13:15,170
oh four was so great to watch
him get the monkey off his back.

230
00:13:15,171 --> 00:13:18,230
So congratulations to him.
Um,

231
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,560
winning the most difficult activity known
to men playing the non sport that is

232
00:13:24,981 --> 00:13:25,814
golf.

233
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:26,953
Okay.

234
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:31,450
You know, I still had to give
a shit. Right? It's such,
um, I know it's such a dude.

235
00:13:31,451 --> 00:13:36,130
It's so hard. It's such a
fucking mind. Fuck, I get it.

236
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,320
I get it. But I would rather have to do
that than face a fucking roided up. Uh,

237
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:45,010
uh, oh, he never got convicted.

238
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:48,670
So Cardiac remens right.

239
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:55,150
Roger Lemons. Right. I wouldn't want
that guy thrown half a fucking bad at me.

240
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:00,220
You know, just muttering inexplicatives
as I walk up to the plate,

241
00:14:00,221 --> 00:14:03,910
like I would much rather have to
try to sync a fucking three foot,

242
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:10,510
then some fucking roided up maniac on
the goddamn mount who can't admit that

243
00:14:10,511 --> 00:14:11,860
it's fucking career's over.

244
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:14,550
So he's got to go out and take
some fucking horse tranquilizers.

245
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:18,970
Not saying that he did it. And you
know what if he did? God bless him.

246
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:23,860
God bless him that he did. I am. I am
so fucking, I told you I'm pro steroids,

247
00:14:23,861 --> 00:14:26,470
dude. I'm fucking pretty.
Everybody should get on him.

248
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:32,440
You know I want every fucking
athlete on steroids. Okay.

249
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:35,830
And then the doctors can look at you and
see what the side effects are and they

250
00:14:35,831 --> 00:14:39,460
can gradually make them better and better
and better and better till it's like

251
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:41,140
vaporized. We'd, you know,

252
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:45,190
you just have like a steroid mist
and meet with my fucked up shoulder.

253
00:14:45,191 --> 00:14:48,040
You know what I mean? I'll just come in
and just walk into the doctor's office.

254
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:51,430
You know,
they'll put a fucking hot towel over head,

255
00:14:51,431 --> 00:14:54,760
like I have hay fever and then they'll
just have be breathing steroids.

256
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,000
I'll walk out,

257
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:02,950
I'll have glutes again after 20 years of
sitting on my ass and planes and rental

258
00:15:02,951 --> 00:15:07,510
cars, my fucking glutes will come
back. They're just like nonexistent.

259
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:10,490
I don't know what happened. I just
fucking like, you know, like a,

260
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:13,030
when you're going to make something
and you got to pound out like a fucking

261
00:15:13,031 --> 00:15:13,870
chicken breast.
Yeah.

262
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:18,090
That's what my fucking ass is like
after years of being on a plane. So, um,

263
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:21,940
I actually made my way across to the
gym when I was in San Antonio to their

264
00:15:21,941 --> 00:15:26,941
sister property sister
property mean the other hotel

265
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:33,050
fucking Weirdos. Anyways,
and I went in there,

266
00:15:33,051 --> 00:15:38,051
I did the elliptical for about 40 minutes
and then I just did a fucking for me,

267
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:43,820
for me, I did a savage fucking
leg workout and now I, you know,

268
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:46,310
I know you guys are all thinking,
well, what did you do bill? All right,

269
00:15:46,311 --> 00:15:48,860
this is what I did.
I add the exercise ball,

270
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:53,360
I put it on the fucking wall between me
and my back and then I would just roll

271
00:15:53,361 --> 00:15:56,610
down with that, you know, so I can
keep my back nice and straight and my,

272
00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:01,040
my weight on my heels,
pushing through my heels to engage my,

273
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:02,900
my veal fucking buttocks.

274
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:12,240
Uh, there, what did I do? I did
hip thrusts after that, you know,

275
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:16,350
then I did a some calf raises,

276
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:18,600
then I did the classic,
you know,

277
00:16:18,601 --> 00:16:21,840
the things you sit down when you do the
front parts of your quads and then the

278
00:16:21,841 --> 00:16:25,600
other one, the stick them in your fucking
go the other way. You do the back party,

279
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:29,220
your legs.
And then I got on the squat machine.

280
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:32,490
I don't like the old thing you stand up
on like the one that you sit down on.

281
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:36,840
I feel you can go deeper. You don't have
to worry about your fucking back. And uh,

282
00:16:36,841 --> 00:16:37,531
and I did that.

283
00:16:37,531 --> 00:16:41,340
I did fucking three sets of all of that
shit and a this morning my legs were

284
00:16:41,341 --> 00:16:46,050
definitely killing me. Um, so
that's a new part of my workout.

285
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,400
Okay.
That's what I'm doing.

286
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:50,490
But I don't have all those leg machines
when I'm here, you know what I mean?

287
00:16:50,491 --> 00:16:53,430
And my shoulder's fucked up so I'm not
putting a bar bell on my back with a

288
00:16:53,431 --> 00:16:55,440
bunch of fucking weight.
Okay. I will just,

289
00:16:55,441 --> 00:17:00,150
I will choose to do more squats without
any weight because I am an old man,

290
00:17:00,151 --> 00:17:01,140
but I swear to God.

291
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,310
Okay.

292
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:03,210
I swear to God,
man,

293
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:07,380
that's fucking athletes manner that he
got to keep taking steroids. You know,

294
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:10,620
just like the singer, she know a singer
can't sing a song. What do they do?

295
00:17:10,621 --> 00:17:14,220
Give her, give her a little bit of
fucking steroids right in the throat.

296
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,070
Give her throat. The old right there,
Fred. And what happens? She fucking,

297
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:21,630
she goes out there and start
singing a song. She makes it simple.

298
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,870
And you know what, in the last,
the whole night launch, sorry. Um,

299
00:17:24,871 --> 00:17:28,980
and then lastly for alternative sports
are I thought I'd take the fucking

300
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:33,810
Formula One race in Shanghai, China,
and I didn't fucking pisses me off.

301
00:17:33,811 --> 00:17:36,080
So all I did was I just
watched the highlights.

302
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:40,170
So a congratulations to Lewis
Hamilton, him and the, uh,

303
00:17:40,171 --> 00:17:41,700
the guy won the Australia.
They could, you know,

304
00:17:41,701 --> 00:17:44,970
they came in one and two and now they
just flipped. So the tide was 43 points.

305
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,720
The fuck's his name. I should know his
name. He only want a goddamn race. Right.

306
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:50,570
That's all right.

307
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:56,830
Sebastian Vettel for the Ferrari team did
tied at 43 and Max Verstappen is 25th,

308
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,400
25 points.
I'm sorry.

309
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:06,630
In third place at a fucking Rikki rocket
isn't fits place Kimi Raikkonen now

310
00:18:11,931 --> 00:18:14,420
he's not the guy called who's a
guy called fucking Rikki rocket.

311
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:18,700
Nico Rosberg is that it? No, Nico Rosberg
fucker. Yeah. I don't fucking know.

312
00:18:18,701 --> 00:18:21,420
There's too many God damn sports
going around my head now. Anyways,

313
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:26,320
the play in Nhl Stat would play in Ottawa.
I like her goddamn chances.

314
00:18:26,321 --> 00:18:29,200
I heard that defense is a little banged
up according to Joe Barton, a gun,

315
00:18:29,201 --> 00:18:33,220
the puck off podcast. I'll be watching
all of those. I'll be tweeting.

316
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,090
I'll be fucking Facebook and I won't be
doing any of that ship and maybe I will.

317
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:42,010
Um, so anyways, eight pretty good when I
was on the road now. So he kind of bed,

318
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,140
you know, I had that Mexican food
and was just fucking, you know,

319
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:47,290
I used to always make fun and the tour,

320
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:49,990
I was making fun of like Mexican
food as far as like, you know,

321
00:18:49,991 --> 00:18:52,840
the re fried green beans and the
rice that they put on the plate.

322
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:54,370
And I was just like,
you know what this shit is.

323
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:58,000
This is Mexico's version of Coleslaw.
You know what Coleslaw,

324
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:02,410
like most people don't take it seriously
and it's basically, it's a plate filler.

325
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,010
You know, you got your piece
of meat, he got your vegetable,

326
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:08,980
and then they just throw that
shit. They're just so, the
plate doesn't look naked.

327
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,700
You know what I mean? Yo, wow. Look at
this big plate of food. I got not, I not,

328
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:15,760
that's Mike. More than 60% rice
and beans. I didn't get it.

329
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:19,570
All right then. One sentence stands.
No, you mix all that shit in together.

330
00:19:19,571 --> 00:19:22,510
He grabbed one of those little
fucking round pieces of bread,

331
00:19:22,511 --> 00:19:24,430
whatever the fuck you call it.
You put it on there,

332
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,440
you know a little bit of hot sauce.
It's delicious.

333
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:31,900
You got a little bean and rice. Fucking
a fucking thing there. Thingamajig sorry,

334
00:19:31,901 --> 00:19:35,620
I'm white. I don't know. I'll learn it.
I've only been out in La for 10 years.

335
00:19:35,621 --> 00:19:39,550
At some point I'll, I'll, I'll
learn it. Was that a Tostada? Um,

336
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:43,750
I know what an Enchilada is.
I know what a crispy Taco is.

337
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:47,740
She said crispy or puffy.
Puffy before.

338
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:53,140
Um, I always go crispy, you know
what I mean? But the crispy Tacos,

339
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:55,030
it's, it's a, it's only
good on the first bike,

340
00:19:55,031 --> 00:19:58,060
cause then the whole fucking thing
falls apart. You know what I mean?

341
00:19:58,061 --> 00:20:00,400
It's like an old person's Hipaa.
You barely touch it in the whole thing.

342
00:20:00,401 --> 00:20:04,210
Just cracks and it doesn't work anymore.
So you kinda got to go soft Taco, right?

343
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:08,690
The flash at TACO. All right, I'm sorry.

344
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,820
But then if you mix the beans and rice
in there is all I can say. It was a,

345
00:20:11,821 --> 00:20:14,810
this was God damn delicious. Let me, yeah,

Now is the time to step up your game.
Go to movement,

423
00:24:57,591 --> 00:25:00,890

Once again,

424
00:25:00,891 --> 00:25:04,850
it's Mvmt Mike Victor,
Mike Tango,

425
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:06,261
speaking of which,

426
00:25:06,261 --> 00:25:10,760
I flew a helicopter for the first
time since October 31st of last year,

427
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:13,460
and although I'll tell you it was
a rough one, I was fucking rusty.

428
00:25:13,461 --> 00:25:16,250
I'll tell you that story in a second,
right after our old friends here,

429
00:25:16,251 --> 00:25:20,900
stamps.com oh stamps.com come on. Shake
the colt off high. You Bet. All right.

430
00:25:20,901 --> 00:25:25,070
I've used, I use stamps.com anytime I'm
selling my posters, you know I'm a moron.

431
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:27,980
If I could figure out how to use the
scale on the postage meters, so can you,

432
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,800
okay.
Stamps save you time and money,

433
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:34,100
which you can use to grow your business
or maybe just sit there scratching your

434
00:25:34,101 --> 00:25:37,970
ass. Anything's better than going down to
the post office. You can mail a letter,

435
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:40,790
any package using gesture
computer and your printer,

436
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:45,260
and the mailman comes and picks it up
the mail, man. All right. Not that lady.

437
00:25:45,261 --> 00:25:46,880
He got to drive down and
fucking give it to her.

438
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:50,870
Avoid the hassle of the post office
man and mail everything from the post,

439
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,030
from postcards to envelopes to packages,

440
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:58,330
domestic or international stamps.com will
help you to decide out of the fucking

441
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:02,690
the best class of mail
based on your needs.

442
00:26:02,691 --> 00:26:07,010
No need to lease an expensive postage
meter right now. You can enjoy this.

447
00:26:24,771 --> 00:26:29,771

again unless you're one of those Weirdos

448
00:26:31,251 --> 00:26:35,570
that collect stamps. Okay? Yeah,

449
00:26:35,571 --> 00:26:40,571
I flew for the first time I went up
with an instructor and a holy shit.

450
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,250
Anybody out there with flies
helicopters? I mean, Gees,

451
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,450
I missed the fucking pad
when I was coming in.

452
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:51,460
I mean I missed it by probably 60 yards,
just coming in way too fast.

453
00:26:51,461 --> 00:26:54,190
I was like, I gotta a guy
settling with power. Fuck this.

454
00:26:54,191 --> 00:26:56,500
I just kind of continued on past it.

455
00:26:56,501 --> 00:27:00,040
Like you supposed to came back
around the next time. You know,

456
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:03,010
I came up a little short. It
took me about, I don't know,

457
00:27:03,011 --> 00:27:07,690
26 goes around till I was starting to
feel it again. And uh, it was funny,

458
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:12,130
like my fourth time I just
flew the traffic pattern
down there at long beach and

459
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:12,964
um,

460
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:18,180
my fourth time around I was turning to
go downwind and I just started laughing

461
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,010
and my instructor started laughing too,
cause he knew I was laughing.

462
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:24,220
It was just like, this is fucking
awesome. It's just fucking,

463
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:26,530
it's fucking awesome.

464
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:31,740
And it just totally re lit the fire in
me to go do it and I'm going to try and

465
00:27:32,081 --> 00:27:33,520
fly again before the end of the month.

466
00:27:33,521 --> 00:27:37,240
So if I can just kind of fly like once
every 10 days or something while I'm

467
00:27:37,241 --> 00:27:41,500
getting a little one going, you know,
um, I would be very happy with that.

468
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:42,130
It's such a,

469
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:47,080
it was such an accomplishment in
my life to get my pilot's license.

470
00:27:47,081 --> 00:27:49,870
I would hate to just not do
it and forget how to do it.

471
00:27:49,871 --> 00:27:53,230
It's so much fucking fun and it's
really safe, you know what I mean?

472
00:27:53,231 --> 00:27:55,270
If you just do what they say,
the way they maintain them.

473
00:27:55,271 --> 00:27:57,940
I know everybody always tries
to freak out, but you know,

474
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:00,010
they always freaking and know
what was freaking me out.

475
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,900
Like he'll be careful out there.
Be careful. Oh yeah. Okay. I can,

476
00:28:02,901 --> 00:28:07,800
I was going to fly with a blindfold, you
know, but I get it. I get it. Anyway,

477
00:28:07,801 --> 00:28:11,470
so let's, um, let's plow ahead here. Um,

478
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:15,040
oh yeah. So I ended up, uh, you know what,

479
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:17,470
I can't plow ahead here cause I was gonna
start doing the reads and I'm only at

480
00:28:17,471 --> 00:28:21,520
28 minutes, so I need to run my
yap a little bit longer. So, um,

481
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:22,460
yeah,

482
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:25,850
yeah, I think we flew the
tab traffic pattern for like
just like a little over an

483
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:30,020
hour.
I got a 1.1 in the Hobbs meter and um,

484
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:33,590
didn't do any autos. It was just all
low approach, you know, normal approach.

485
00:28:33,591 --> 00:28:37,580
Steve Approach. That's
all I was doing. And um,

486
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:43,190
it was fun flying the 22, which
is my, that's my favorite one.

487
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:47,330
Even on the 44 is cool.
You know, it's a nicer one.

488
00:28:47,331 --> 00:28:51,800
I just thought the 22 is like driving
an old sports car with no power windows,

489
00:28:51,801 --> 00:28:56,720
no power steering, fucking drum
brakes. I always just put that one.

490
00:28:56,721 --> 00:29:00,020
It's just like whatever it's doing,
I'm actually doing it.

491
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:03,980
I heard on some of those
high end helicopters if you
want, if you want to hover,

492
00:29:03,981 --> 00:29:06,800
you just push a button and
it just does it for you.

493
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:10,520
That's the one you get when you get older.
You know what I mean?

494
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:11,720
Okay.

495
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,860
I don't want to shut out, draw it on
a dime. Um, all right. You know what?

496
00:29:15,861 --> 00:29:17,360
I'm just going to start
reading these fucking,

497
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:19,120
I'm going to start doing
the reeds here for the week.

498
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:21,130
Okay.

499
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:21,831
Oh, by the way, what,

500
00:29:21,831 --> 00:29:26,590
what's the deal with all the
haunted houses in San Antonio?

501
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:30,170
You know, it was the
usual stuff as far as, uh,

502
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,460
as far as you know,
Texas goes,

503
00:29:33,461 --> 00:29:36,850
Texas is the king of the shiny four
door pickup truck that's never seen a

504
00:29:36,851 --> 00:29:38,530
construction site or off road.

505
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:40,693
Okay.

506
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,140
In Texas.
That's a four

507
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:45,680
door sedan. Then I'll tell you,
they got some fucking nice ones.

508
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:50,420
I saw a guy pull up in
a Ford F one 54 door.

509
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:55,400
It's got giant tires on it. This old
fucking guy, big white cowboy hat,

510
00:29:55,910 --> 00:30:00,890
big fucking belt buckle in white
cowboy boots. I was just like, ah,

511
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,440
this is just, you know,
as a tourist. It's like,

512
00:30:03,441 --> 00:30:06,890
that's what the fuck I wanted to see.
Now I could say I went to Texas.

513
00:30:06,891 --> 00:30:07,401
You know what I mean?

514
00:30:07,401 --> 00:30:09,290
I don't want to see somebody
looking at their fucking iPhone.

515
00:30:09,291 --> 00:30:13,850
I can do that out here. All right.
Update Psycho from yogurt shop video.

516
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,530
All right, Bill. Turns out that
Nutjob I don't even remember this.

517
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:22,100
Who was it costing? The couple.
All, all, oh, that's right.

518
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:26,000
This goes back to like
a couple podcasts to go,

519
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:31,430
whether it was this woman who was trashing
these two people kissing in public

520
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:36,050
saying that it was sexual harassment
and all of that type of stuff. And uh,

521
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:39,740
I kind of agreed with her
on on a level is I just,

522
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:41,960
I hate watching people kiss in public,
you know what I mean?

523
00:30:41,961 --> 00:30:46,400
Give each other a quick peck, you know,
going for one real one if you want to,

524
00:30:46,401 --> 00:30:48,230
but then just keep it moving.
You know what I mean?

525
00:30:48,231 --> 00:30:51,080
To literally sit there and take it to
the point where her policies getting wet

526
00:30:51,081 --> 00:30:52,760
and your Dick Start standing up.
It's like,

527
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:55,940
what are you don't get the
fuck out of here. It's gross.

528
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,490
[inaudible] all over each other.
I fucking can't stand it.

529
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:04,430
I don't like it in movies, you know,
I've put disgusting. Um, anyways,

530
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:08,600
so here's an update for this lady flipped
out and was yelling at them and you

531
00:31:08,601 --> 00:31:10,040
know, I dunno, I'm going to call the cops.

532
00:31:10,041 --> 00:31:12,140
I couldn't get through the whole thing
because she looked like she was a little,

533
00:31:12,141 --> 00:31:15,050
uh, you know, had some
mental issues going on.

534
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:18,500
Some was going on and she was extremely
lonely or somebody filled her up with

535
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:22,140
Jesus. I don't know what happened.
Anyways, Bill turns out then that nut job,

536
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:27,260
who was a costing, the couple of the
yogurt shop is an amateur porn actress,

537
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:29,060
Eh,

538
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:34,060
boy and witnesses say that the guy only
kissed his girlfriend on the forehead.

539
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:36,530
No lip service. Oh, all right. My fault.

540
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,920
And it wasn't the first time
she's yelled at people in public.

541
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:44,690
It took the interland like half a
day to get to the bottom of it. Ah,

542
00:31:44,691 --> 00:31:46,920
well that's too bad.
Yeah.

543
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,330
Aww. That's too bad. You know what I mean?

544
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,380
You know what's weird about watching
porn as much as you watch it, you know,

545
00:31:54,381 --> 00:31:58,460
nobody wants to do it. No, but
that was not a fucking job.

546
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:01,550
All right, let me read
this here. Go to the page,

547
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:06,160
go to the page.
That's what I sage.

548
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:09,680
All right, here we go. Is
it going to come up for me?

549
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:11,230
Okay.

550
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:15,700
Viral video of meltdown over for how
exactly did they figure out who she was?

551
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,940
How does the Internet get to
the bottom of all of this stuff?

552
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:26,520
All right, here we go. Uh, recently,
a viral video video went viral.

553
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:29,790
Having a meltdown over a forehead kiss.

554
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:31,230
Yeah.

555
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:34,080
Yeah. This all happened at a
Santa Monica or restaurant.

556
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:35,760
Okay.

557
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,910
Go so far to believe that the women, a
woman is something, something that seems,

558
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,710
oh Jesus Christ. Yeah. Come
on man. It's not enough.

559
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:49,350
It's not enough. She made an ass
of herself. We've got to take it.

560
00:32:49,351 --> 00:32:51,600
I don't want to fucking know about
this person. Feel bad for him.

561
00:32:51,601 --> 00:32:54,060
She turns a life around.
All right. Update.

562
00:32:54,061 --> 00:32:56,850
Great Barrier Reef is
time for another update.

563
00:32:56,851 --> 00:33:01,230
Sounds like your skepticism of the
reports that it ain't all that bad was

564
00:33:01,231 --> 00:33:05,580
warranted. All right. The Great
Barrier Reef. Yeah. This is more shit.

565
00:33:05,581 --> 00:33:10,200
I don't want to read about fucking people
have gone crazy doing porn and I don't

566
00:33:10,201 --> 00:33:13,170
read about the fucking great barrier
reef died. What are you guys doing to me?

567
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:19,200
I got another fucking 27 minutes to go.
Oh my God.

568
00:33:19,201 --> 00:33:21,420
Is this the Holy Shit. Okay, great.

569
00:33:21,421 --> 00:33:26,421
Barrier Reef at terminal stage scientists
despair at latest coral bleaching data

570
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Australia's politicians has betrayed the
reef and only the people can save it.

571
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,790
Oh I should read this cause maybe I dunno,
maybe they can turn it around.

572
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:42,670
Cause there are uplifting stories
about nature out there. You know,

573
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:46,740
where certain species are making a big
comeback, you know what I mean? All right.

574
00:33:46,741 --> 00:33:47,491
Back to back.

575
00:33:47,491 --> 00:33:52,020
Severe bleaching events have affected
two thirds of Australia's Great Barrier

576
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:55,260
Reef. A new aerial survey
have found the founding.

577
00:33:55,320 --> 00:34:00,270
The findings have caused alarm amongst
scientists to say the proximity of the

578
00:34:00,271 --> 00:34:05,271
2016 and 2017 bleaching event is
unprecedented for the reef and we'll give

579
00:34:05,731 --> 00:34:10,620
damage, coral little chance
to recover. Um, all right.

580
00:34:10,621 --> 00:34:15,450
What side is this? This is called the
Guardian. Now what? What is their agenda?

581
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:17,490
Yeah. I mean you never know
what the fuck. Believe here,

582
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:21,450
scientists with the Australian
Research Council, Center of Excellence,

583
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,670
Jesus Christ, take it
down a little bit, Huh?

584
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:27,090
Fucking arrogant bastards for
coral reef studies. Last week,

585
00:34:27,091 --> 00:34:31,590
compiled aerial surveys of the world's
largest living structures, scoring,

586
00:34:31,591 --> 00:34:36,270
bleaching at 800 individual coral
reefs across 8,000 kilometers.

587
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:41,220
The results show the two consecutive
mass bleaching events have effected 1500

588
00:34:41,221 --> 00:34:45,030
kilometer stretch, leaving only
the rates southern third unscathed.

589
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:47,580
Oh boy.

590
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,500
Okay.

591
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,550
Oh,
there you go.

592
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,430
Okay.

593
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:56,900
You know what the deal is? We have to go.
A significant portion of us have to go.

594
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,550
You know,
maybe it's good that the robots come.

595
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:04,450
Are they going to be electric robots?
Are they going to require oil also?

596
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,160
But you know something.
All these fucking electric cars,

597
00:35:06,161 --> 00:35:09,790
you know when you go to just split
that Tesla, that giant Tesla battery.

598
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:13,210
Now what do they do with that?
When you're done with the car,

599
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:16,600
what happens to that battery?
I know that car constantly has updates.

600
00:35:16,601 --> 00:35:19,780
Does that also include the battery?
Can you make the battery better?

601
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:22,271
Let's look that up.

602
00:35:22,271 --> 00:35:25,660
I bet there's a bunch of fucking
oil companies putting some shit out.

603
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:30,520
True or otherwise about this. Um, Tesla.

604
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:32,420
Okay.

605
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:33,410
Car.

606
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,673
Okay.

607
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,070
Footprint.

608
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:37,320
Okay.

609
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,010
Okay.
Let's

610
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:42,590
see. The carbon footprint of
Tesla manufacturing Teslas.

611
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:47,490
Electric cars aren't as green as you might
think. The electric cars aren't green.

612
00:35:47,491 --> 00:35:51,640
Yeah, nothing is green.
Nothing is green. Okay.

613
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:54,330
Then Doug Stanhope, Doug
Stam. Nope. Had a great joke.

614
00:35:54,331 --> 00:35:56,850
He said the greatest thing
you can do is kill yourself.

615
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:01,710
And I would go further
if he didn't just say,

616
00:36:01,711 --> 00:36:05,190
and then add yourself buried in the
topsoil so you'll get fucking give it some

617
00:36:05,191 --> 00:36:07,010
nutrients.
Um,

618
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:11,220
actually we're also full of fucking
God knows what Mcdonald's and shit.

619
00:36:11,221 --> 00:36:14,550
You'd probably cause the tree
next to your body to die. Um,

620
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:18,600
does the Tesla model s electric
car pollute more than an SUV?

621
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:22,080
This is the green car
report. All right, let's see.

622
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:23,710
Okay,

623
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:27,130
let's see
who's kidding?

624
00:36:27,131 --> 00:36:28,900
Who the Tesla is not about being green.

625
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:31,840
That's about going zero
to 60 in 2.3 seconds.

626
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:34,390
Does that supposedly clean green test?

627
00:36:34,391 --> 00:36:38,860
Somara s really pollute more than a
gas guzzling jeep grand Cherokee sports

628
00:36:38,861 --> 00:36:42,940
utility vehicle.
That's what one analyst has claimed.

629
00:36:42,941 --> 00:36:45,580
Now what I love about this is
everybody has a dog in the fight.

630
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:50,800
Obviously the oil guys don't want you
to switch over to the fucking electrical

631
00:36:50,801 --> 00:36:54,460
shit and all the electric people,
they are so convinced at batteries.

632
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:58,420
You know? Did Michael Jordan do
a commercial a long time ago,

633
00:36:58,421 --> 00:37:01,420
but recycling your batteries
to need do that. You know?

634
00:37:01,421 --> 00:37:03,910
That's how I know about it. Right,
because an athlete told me not to do it,

635
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:06,110
but what about that giant battery
at the bottom of the Tesla?

636
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,020
What do you do with that thing?
What do you do with that when it's done?

637
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:09,580
All right.

638
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:14,580
In an exhaustive 6,500 word article on
the financial websites seeking alpha

639
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:15,311
analysts,

640
00:37:15,311 --> 00:37:20,311
Nathan Weiss lays out a case model
s that the case model s actually.

641
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:23,050
Okay. Okay. We know what he
said. He said it was worse

642
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:29,470
as an owner. I was shocked. For
me, I just felt this is crazy.

643
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:32,870
Although the carbon emissions, we're not
a big factor in my decision. Blah, blah,

644
00:37:32,871 --> 00:37:35,390
blah, blah. Okay.

645
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:37,973
Okay.

646
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:43,070
Weiss has been advising his clients to
short the stock of Tesla and it's good.

647
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:46,860
Okay.

648
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:49,590
All right. Not so fast. Power
plant emissions counter. All right.

649
00:37:49,591 --> 00:37:51,480
I'm not reading all this fucking shit.
You know what this is.

650
00:37:51,481 --> 00:37:55,890
This is just a media war right now going
on and I don't know where the fuck to

651
00:37:55,891 --> 00:37:58,650
get the facts and I'm not going to just
look at the up the first goddamn thing

652
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:03,510
and read it. I have no idea. You know?
But I can tell you this. All right.

653
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:07,480
I know that guy that had a Tesla has
like ridiculous security roundup because

654
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:10,650
remember that Gao came up with the car
that could drive across the country just

655
00:38:10,651 --> 00:38:13,500
on water and then he went
around and told people about it.

656
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,970
His last words when he walked out of the
diner was they poisoned me and then he

657
00:38:17,971 --> 00:38:22,500
died and then his car disappeared.
Um, I know that sounds crazy,

658
00:38:22,501 --> 00:38:27,090
but that's a true fucking story. It's
a true story according to the Internet.

659
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:31,580
All right, follow up girl. Who gave,
we'd ultimatum. I love the followups.

660
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:35,710
Everybody. This is like our own
little mini series here on podcast.

661
00:38:35,711 --> 00:38:39,850
This is tremendous. I'll give you that
guy's name too if you guys can look it up.

662
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:43,910
But you guys let me know if you think
this is fucking, yeah. All right. Uh,

663
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,130
water power.

664
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,590
Car

665
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:54,400
inventor vanishes. What is
his name? What's his name?

666
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:59,220
What's the name of the fog and
water guy? Yes. Stanley Myers.

667
00:38:59,221 --> 00:39:02,880
Water fuel cell.
There you go.

668
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:07,690
Look that guy up. Go down that
fucking Rad. Hope rabbit hole.

669
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:10,150
M e y e r I think is how you spell it,
right?

670
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:15,020
Stanley Stanley's are always
fucking honest, aren't there?

671
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:18,830
Um, one of my favorite promoters around
the country, that's his first name,

672
00:39:18,831 --> 00:39:22,320
Stanley, right. Is fucking rain. Um,

673
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:27,050
all right, follow up to the girl who
gave me the weed ultimatum. All right,

674
00:39:27,051 --> 00:39:31,370
for those of you missed the podcast a
couple times ago, there was a, this woman,

675
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:32,900
this guy was dating,
you know,

676
00:39:32,901 --> 00:39:36,050
he's always smoking weed around her as
she had problems with alcohol and shit.

677
00:39:36,051 --> 00:39:37,700
And then one day,
I don't know,

678
00:39:37,701 --> 00:39:40,910
she cleaned up and she just lashed out
at him and said he needs to just totally

679
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:44,940
quit smoking weed or you know, it's
either her or the wheat. All right,

680
00:39:44,941 --> 00:39:49,130
so here we go. It says, Yo
brother bill on four, three.

681
00:39:49,131 --> 00:39:53,450
You responded to my email about the
ultimate and my girlfriend gave me, uh,

682
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:57,620
her versus wheat. Uh, my fucking
computer's going to die. Hang on.

683
00:39:57,621 --> 00:39:58,341
I got to hit pause.

684
00:39:58,341 --> 00:40:01,670
I can't keep fucking yammered expect you
guys to listen to this shit. Hold on.

685
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:06,620
All right, I'm back. I'm back. I'm powered
here. I'm powered up here. All right.

686
00:40:06,621 --> 00:40:09,040
On four, three, he responded to
my email about the ultimatum.

687
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:13,960
My girlfriend gave me her versus we'd
be the choose her or the weed man.

688
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,320
Uh,

689
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:18,340
she has sense admitted that she was being
a cunt by giving me the ultimatum and

690
00:40:18,341 --> 00:40:22,480
no longer cares if I smoke. She has
since been smoking more weed than me.

691
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:26,320
And two days after she
gave me the ultimatum, the
following happens yet, dude,

692
00:40:26,321 --> 00:40:29,410
I don't even need to read this. See, this
woman is unstable. She needs to get help.

693
00:40:29,411 --> 00:40:31,180
And if I was you,
I'd get out of this relationship,

694
00:40:31,181 --> 00:40:34,180
but I'll read it for the
entertainment value here. Uh,

695
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:37,450
she stumbled into our apartments
so drunk that she couldn't stand.

696
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:40,900
She was accompanied by another
man. Oh, bonus. Here we go.

697
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:45,260
The guy she was with happened to be the
one guy that she swore she'd never talk

698
00:40:45,261 --> 00:40:50,020
to again because a couple months ago he
sent her a 10 page email professing his

699
00:40:50,021 --> 00:40:54,610
love for her and trying to convince her
that I'm an asshole and she should be

700
00:40:54,611 --> 00:40:59,440
with them. Up until that point, they
were friends that hung out on occasion,

701
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:04,270
which I was okay with, oh Jesus.
But after he sent the love letter,

702
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:07,960
which she read to me, she told me
she would never speak to him again.

703
00:41:07,961 --> 00:41:12,600
Why did she read this to you? You
didn't need to hear all of that. Okay.

704
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,600
Anyways,
back to the cup a couple of days ago,

705
00:41:15,601 --> 00:41:19,710
we got in a fight and I said I was
going to leave because of the bullshit.

706
00:41:19,711 --> 00:41:22,320
We'd ultimatum,
but instead she left.

707
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:24,493
What?

708
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:29,500
Anyways, back to a couple of days ago.
So wait, when did she stumble into,

709
00:41:29,501 --> 00:41:33,180
this is like a fucking Tarantino movie.
Two days after she gave me.

710
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:38,100
All right,
so I guess before this bullshit happened,

711
00:41:38,101 --> 00:41:40,890
you said you were going to leave
due to the fucking weed ultimatum.

712
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:43,763
Is that what you're telling me?

713
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:48,210
But instead she left claiming she was
spending the night at her sisters and said

714
00:41:48,211 --> 00:41:51,450
she went straight to this dude's place,
got shit faced drunk,

715
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:55,410
went to a bar with him, then came
back to our apartment, both of them.

716
00:41:56,580 --> 00:42:00,570
She did not expect me to be home.
When she saw that I was there,

717
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:05,550
he immediately walked out.
Oh Jesus. She was so drunk.

718
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:07,230
She was unresponsible.

719
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:10,710
So the fight didn't come until the next
morning when she claimed that the only

720
00:42:10,711 --> 00:42:13,920
reason he walked in was probably because
he was just making sure she got home

721
00:42:13,921 --> 00:42:17,700
safely. Oh boy. Um,

722
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:20,910
I told her that I'm done and then
I'm moving back to my home state,

723
00:42:20,911 --> 00:42:24,240
seeing as she's the only reason I no
longer live in my home state. Good,

724
00:42:24,241 --> 00:42:27,180
good move. Good move.
Sir. Since this incident,

725
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:31,020
she has been crying and begging for
me to stay and wants to get married,

726
00:42:31,021 --> 00:42:32,760
et cetera.
I get the fuck Outta here.

727
00:42:32,761 --> 00:42:37,230
She claims that she has no interest in
him and she was just mad at me and was

728
00:42:37,231 --> 00:42:41,340
under the impression that I had already
packed my things and left and she just

729
00:42:41,341 --> 00:42:42,930
needed a friend.
At the moment,

730
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:46,860
those are all lies and this is the
tip of the fucking iceberg, sir.

731
00:42:46,861 --> 00:42:49,800
That goes all the way down to the
fucking ocean floor. Personally,

732
00:42:49,801 --> 00:42:52,470
I don't think I can forgive
her on her or trust her,

733
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:56,040
but I need to make a decision and
fast get the fuck out of there, sir,

734
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:59,640
because I'm either going to tough
this out and stay here. Oh Jesus.

735
00:42:59,641 --> 00:43:03,480
Hoping this shit doesn't happen again or
I'm going to get the fuck out of dodge

736
00:43:03,481 --> 00:43:06,180
and moved back home and start over.
Help me out, brother. Should it,

737
00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:11,340
should I stay or should I go your
thoughts? Thanks. And Go fuck my life.

738
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:14,610
No, not fuck your life. If
you stay, you're fucking,

739
00:43:14,611 --> 00:43:18,330
you'll have to get out of there now that
you just heard what you wrote out loud

740
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:22,060
back by me reading it out loud,
which probably made no sense. Um,

741
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:23,590
okay.

742
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:28,330
You realize how insane that is.
How insane it would be for you to do that.

743
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:32,320
Um, I'm almost thinking it as much
as she needs to get her life to get,

744
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:36,580
you need to look at yourself as to why
you would stay with a person like this.

745
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:37,500
Okay?

746
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:40,380
Yeah. You need to get the fuck
out of it, dude. All right.

747
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:42,450
You still got your
whole life ahead of you.

748
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:43,390
Okay.

749
00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:46,810
All right. And as far as
like marrying somebody, you
basically get one draft pick.

750
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:49,120
All right?
Cause when you get divorce,

751
00:43:49,121 --> 00:43:52,930
your franchise gets cut in half and then
you start drafting in the later rounds.

752
00:43:52,931 --> 00:43:56,170
You know you're getting older and shit.
This is your number one draft pick.

753
00:43:56,470 --> 00:44:01,470
This is what you're going to pick this
person with all the fucking problems that

754
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:06,370
happen at the college level.
I'm telling you.

755
00:44:07,690 --> 00:44:11,170
Get the fuck out of it. Right
it dude. I mean Jesus Christ.

756
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:19,430
If you don't believe me, go, go as
tell 20 strangers that fucking story.

757
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,700
I swear to God they're all
going to say the same thing.

758
00:44:23,701 --> 00:44:25,010
Get the fuck out of there.

759
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:26,640
Okay,

760
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:31,020
go on Doctor Phil Hill.
Do you need to get the fuck out of dodge?

761
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:35,310
He'd say the same thing.
Actually, he probably wouldn't
be because she's a woman.

762
00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:39,150
His audience is female. So he
probably got, well maybe if you

763
00:44:40,690 --> 00:44:45,690
smoked a little less weed and she tried
to fuck a little less other people,

764
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:51,360
maybe y'all could find a middle ground.
Now we're going to be like, Woo.

765
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:56,550
I inserted myself into that situation.
All right.

766
00:44:56,551 --> 00:44:59,260
Men going their own way. You can't go. Oh.

767
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:03,270
Um,
all right.

768
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:07,680
This is a fucking amazing bouquet.
Hey Yo Billy boy.

769
00:45:07,681 --> 00:45:12,300
I was wondering if you are secretly behind
this movement. This is fucking crazy.

770
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,120
This right here is,
um,

771
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:19,710
there's some movement
evidently down in Australia,

772
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:23,190
down in all Aussie down in all
is whatever the fuck they say.

773
00:45:23,191 --> 00:45:26,070
I don't know if the fuck they say, I've
only been there a couple of times. Oh,

774
00:45:26,071 --> 00:45:30,480
the plug came, I'd done.
Was there a reason why they
turn the plug into a magnet?

775
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:35,640
You know, back when it plugged in, it did
much better. I guess it's easy to find,

776
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,630
you know, it's got navigation kind
of, and you can find the fucking hole.

777
00:45:39,631 --> 00:45:41,850
But it won't stay in there. All right. Uh,

778
00:45:41,851 --> 00:45:46,320
there's a growing movement of men in
Australia called men going their own way.

779
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:50,720
I just paused for all the guys listen to
this with their girls so she could have

780
00:45:50,721 --> 00:45:54,170
time to roll the rise and be
like, oh God. All right. M,

781
00:45:54,171 --> 00:45:57,620
g t o w Mega Sao.
Um,

782
00:45:57,650 --> 00:46:00,140
it's an offshoot of the
men's rights movement,

783
00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:05,350
but rather than getting stuck in and
tack stuck in and tackling issues,

784
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:07,180
okay.

785
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:09,700
Now, rather than getting
stuck at tackling issues,

786
00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:12,340
these guys have vowed
to stay away from women,

787
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:15,730
stop dating and not have children.

788
00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:18,303
Jesus.

789
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:22,960
Essentially m g t o w was a statement
about living your life rather than trying

790
00:46:22,961 --> 00:46:27,850
to make a woman happy. Sorry, happy.
Sorry, screamed all my jokes last night.

791
00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:31,720
Or being a slave to cultural expectations.

792
00:46:32,110 --> 00:46:35,330
One sw members says,
um,

793
00:46:36,070 --> 00:46:39,370
this isn't about a specific rule book.
More a mindset.

794
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:43,720
Although there are purists in the movement
who are the most extreme and avoid

795
00:46:43,721 --> 00:46:47,830
women entirely. There's a growing
number of men who've had enough,

796
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:52,570
enough of the feminism and enough of
being told they have to work for a greater

797
00:46:52,571 --> 00:46:54,580
good,
which doesn't actually exist.

798
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:59,620
Start looking into this manosphere and
it's like going down a rabbit hole.

799
00:46:59,621 --> 00:47:00,431
This person says,

800
00:47:00,431 --> 00:47:05,431
happiness here is supposedly freedom and
shutting relationships is now sweeping

801
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:07,870
through the younger generations.

802
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:12,430
Is it or is this just a very
interesting article? Okay,

803
00:47:12,431 --> 00:47:16,720
Tom 15 from NSW north,

804
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:20,370
south west, whatever the fuck
that is is what you call it,

805
00:47:20,410 --> 00:47:24,910
what you would call the growing
number of teens going their own way.

806
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:28,540
Jesus kid never even got off the
ground. He goes, it's probably not.

807
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:33,290
It's probably not true. But I got to
Philly and women are actually dangerous.

808
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:36,890
Maybe the men around me have
just had bad experiences.

809
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:40,330
He tells the news woman.
Um,

810
00:47:40,430 --> 00:47:44,540
you said it's scary being a teenage boy.
I'm not sure how it all,

811
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:47,600
it's all meant to fit together
in the future. Says Tom,

812
00:47:47,810 --> 00:47:52,640
last year my uncle lost everything
because his wife of 40 years decided she

813
00:47:52,641 --> 00:47:56,450
didn't love him anymore. Just like
that. She randomly got up and left.

814
00:47:56,570 --> 00:48:00,980
It got nasty and he lost everything.
His house, cars and loads of money.

815
00:48:01,130 --> 00:48:04,130
There's no way I'm ever getting
married. Well they, I mean Shit,

816
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:06,320
you saw a very traumatic thing.
Of course,

817
00:48:06,321 --> 00:48:10,460
teenage boys look at other males in
their life together. Some perspective.

818
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:13,340
I'm just going to read quotes cause
I'm not gonna read all this. Uh,

819
00:48:13,370 --> 00:48:16,340
my older brother who's 20,
was dating a girl for a few months.

820
00:48:16,370 --> 00:48:19,940
She turned real nasty in the breakup
and made a string of allegations to the

821
00:48:19,941 --> 00:48:24,380
police. That made me suspicious of women
to my mother. My brother's a good guy.

822
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:25,640
Okay.

823
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:29,110
Okay. Why should she be able
to just say what she wants,

824
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:32,150
accuse him of anything and then
get on with her life like that?

825
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:36,920
It doesn't seem fair to me. I'm not
sure what rights I have. Maybe none.

826
00:48:37,850 --> 00:48:38,270
Yeah.

827
00:48:38,270 --> 00:48:41,780
Okay. Both sex is okay. It's crucial
that we encourage our children,

828
00:48:42,590 --> 00:48:45,530
find a mentor or a teacher of some
blah, blah, blah. Someone who supports,

829
00:48:45,531 --> 00:48:49,910
communicate the, yeah. About skills
of getting a healthy relationship.

830
00:48:49,911 --> 00:48:51,170
That's exactly what I was going to say.

831
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:52,383
Yeah.

832
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:55,760
What do you get? You just going
to walk away from women, you know,

833
00:48:55,820 --> 00:49:00,110
you're never gonna Bang another one.
Maybe just go on Tinder.

834
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,620
Look, you can get a lot done not being
in a relationship, male or female.

835
00:49:03,621 --> 00:49:06,680
Just focus it on your fucking
career buddy. And you know,
if you want to be alone,

836
00:49:06,681 --> 00:49:10,370
that's fucking cool. But uh, to do
it because of fear reasons is wrong,

837
00:49:10,371 --> 00:49:13,760
but you need to learn how to do is set
up your relationship and how you set up a

838
00:49:13,761 --> 00:49:16,040
relationship is you have to,

839
00:49:17,210 --> 00:49:19,590
you don't pretend to be something.
You're not.

840
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:21,300
Just tell him what the fuck you want

841
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:27,590
from day one when she's going like, do
you watch sports all the time? Be like,

842
00:49:27,591 --> 00:49:28,700
yeah,
I love them.

843
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:30,850
Okay,

844
00:49:30,850 --> 00:49:32,930
love it. Do you know what I
like doing most when I do that?

845
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:36,460
Like drinking a beer and then going
out smoking a cigar. That's what I do.

846
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:40,000
Hey Sweetheart, what do you do? Don't lie.

847
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:44,520
Just tell me what you do and let's
see if what you do mixes. What's what,

848
00:49:44,521 --> 00:49:49,060
what I do. Because if we both start
pretending that we don't do it,

849
00:49:49,061 --> 00:49:51,550
we go and pitch a minute, go
back to go. Well, we don't know.

850
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:54,790
We all make God you changed.
No, I didn't change. I just,

851
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:58,210
I just started being myself
for the first time around you.

852
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:00,750
Okay.

853
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:05,420
I didn't mention that I was
into a dog sleds. Yeah. Uh,

854
00:50:05,490 --> 00:50:07,130
well I just figured during
the first three months,

855
00:50:07,131 --> 00:50:10,350
like I'd make you fall in love with me
and then I would bring my 18 huskies into

856
00:50:10,351 --> 00:50:14,220
the fucking house. Um, all right.

857
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:17,040
You're talking about a guy who's made
every fucking possible mistake that you

858
00:50:17,041 --> 00:50:18,090
can make in a relationship.

859
00:50:18,330 --> 00:50:21,360
I've fucked up more goddamn
relationships with great women.

860
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:23,580
I got to taste something. Okay. You know?

861
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:25,270
Yeah.

862
00:50:25,270 --> 00:50:28,980
I, I, I dated some great and I,
I fucked him all up. All right.

863
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:33,510
And it wasn't until I met my now wife,

864
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:36,390
not saying I did make a bunch
of fucking mistakes after that,

865
00:50:36,391 --> 00:50:39,300
but I just met somebody, dad. Uh, I dunno.

866
00:50:39,330 --> 00:50:41,490
I was in that part of my life where
I could just be like, all right,

867
00:50:41,491 --> 00:50:45,390
this is what I do. Is that what
you do yet? I never get, no,

868
00:50:45,930 --> 00:50:47,430
that's the one thing I am,
you own a few things.

869
00:50:47,431 --> 00:50:51,270
I am proud of all the relationships I've
had with women as I've never liked a,

870
00:50:51,271 --> 00:50:54,000
I never judged him as far as like
whatever the fuck they were into.

871
00:50:54,001 --> 00:50:57,840
I didn't give a shit. You
know, whatever you want to do,

872
00:50:57,841 --> 00:50:59,100
just just fucking do it.

873
00:50:59,101 --> 00:51:01,770
Because I just looked at it like
if I give you that sort of freedom,

874
00:51:01,771 --> 00:51:04,380
then you'll give it back to me.
And if you don't then I'm,

875
00:51:04,381 --> 00:51:07,470
I'm fucking out of here.
And what are you going to say?

876
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,790
What are you going to say? That's
the thing that's my, you know,

877
00:51:10,791 --> 00:51:12,200
my friends come over there.
Jesus Christ fail.

878
00:51:12,201 --> 00:51:14,560
You always fucking
cleaning up the kitchen.

879
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:17,630
You fucking doing all this type of shit
around the house. It's, I can't exactly,

880
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:19,280
it's the genius.

881
00:51:20,690 --> 00:51:23,210
I earn a great living and then I
come home when I fucking crush it.

882
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:25,063
Yup.

883
00:51:25,930 --> 00:51:28,280
So then when I want to go out and go
see my buddy played drums tonight,

884
00:51:28,281 --> 00:51:32,980
what's my wife going to say? No. Why?

885
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:36,600
Because you have a daughter.
Ah Shit. You're right. Okay.

886
00:51:37,810 --> 00:51:40,090
She got the daughter car now.
So what am I going to do?

887
00:51:40,091 --> 00:51:43,750
Plus I fucking love my daughter. So break
coming off there. Not Match the best.

888
00:51:43,751 --> 00:51:47,260
It's the greatest thing ever.
Greatest thing ever. She's not,

889
00:51:47,261 --> 00:51:51,610
she's slept through the
night for the first time. Um,

890
00:51:52,450 --> 00:51:55,900
of course the day I had to get
up early, you know, and fly out.

891
00:51:55,901 --> 00:51:57,730
So I missed the last
three hours. She, she,

892
00:51:58,270 --> 00:52:01,420
I think she slept that she slept from
like 10 to like seven in the morning.

893
00:52:01,670 --> 00:52:05,590
It was fucking unbelievable.
And um,

894
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:10,660
she's such a cute, happy, chill kid.
I'm so happy about that. You know,

895
00:52:10,661 --> 00:52:13,510
cause I am a fucking lunatic and I,
she's not home right now.

896
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:14,950
That's why I'm doing the
podcast a little late too.

897
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:20,020
So she's out with her
mother and that is my goal.

898
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:23,890
You know, I don't know if we'll
have another one. I have no idea.

899
00:52:23,891 --> 00:52:27,850
But whatever kid or kids that I ended
up having, I want them to be happy,

900
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:33,190
relaxed. I want them to feel like they
can approach me. They can ask questions.

901
00:52:33,191 --> 00:52:35,200
I am by no means going to be a pushover.

902
00:52:35,350 --> 00:52:37,120
I'm not going to buy him a bunch of Shit.

903
00:52:37,930 --> 00:52:41,170
I'm already against that by and kids
fucking toys before they're like three

904
00:52:41,171 --> 00:52:45,430
years old or two and a half is stupid.
They don't even know what toys are. Okay.

905
00:52:45,550 --> 00:52:48,220
They want to go out in the kitchen,
they want to play with pots and pans.

906
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:52,420
You know, they want to play with you
shoes. They want to play with everything.

907
00:52:52,421 --> 00:52:57,180
But toys, toys actually bore them.
Okay. You get them some pots and pans.

908
00:52:57,181 --> 00:53:01,210
It's over. They love him. They like
the noise, they liked the handles.

909
00:53:01,211 --> 00:53:04,180
They like make it a fucking
mess. It's great. Um,

910
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:08,950
but you know, I'm not going to be
that fucking person by, you know,

911
00:53:08,951 --> 00:53:10,480
78 fucking iPad.

912
00:53:12,310 --> 00:53:14,980
Be Funny by daughter's pissed at me in
the future and she goes back and listens

913
00:53:14,981 --> 00:53:19,810
to this episode is now playing it to me
sometime in the future. You know, Jesus.

914
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:23,730
Oh, that'd be a rough one. Anyways. Uh,
let's plow ahead. Let's get, um, yes.

915
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:27,730
I would say like that whole, like men
going their own way. I don't know. It's,

916
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:31,880
that's silly. Why would you
do that? You're 15 years old.

917
00:53:31,881 --> 00:53:33,040
You're in the prime of your life.
You don't,

918
00:53:33,041 --> 00:53:35,840
don't want to be in a relationship to
just be that Gail finger banks checks on

919
00:53:35,841 --> 00:53:40,550
the weekends, you know? And then on Monday
when you go to school and they're like,

920
00:53:40,551 --> 00:53:43,160
hey, you know, like we going to
do that again and be, I, you know,

921
00:53:43,161 --> 00:53:44,830
if you want to hang out, I
mean, I'm kind of doing so,

922
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:46,760
and then when they fucking go and like,

923
00:53:46,761 --> 00:53:50,310
so what should deal you just going to
finger me? And it's just like, what?

924
00:53:50,390 --> 00:53:51,290
You didn't enjoy it.

925
00:53:52,330 --> 00:53:52,930
Okay.

926
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:55,060
Yeah. And like, I did
something bad, you know, just,

927
00:53:55,061 --> 00:53:59,410
I just don't want to be in a relationship
right now. I'm young, you know?

928
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:04,280
And they called it finger banging,
Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo.

929
00:54:04,290 --> 00:54:07,120
I'm Eric girlfriends.
Spiked my drink.

930
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:09,510
Yeah.

931
00:54:09,510 --> 00:54:12,180
Jesus Christ. You know what's funny?
If I said that in front of a crowd,

932
00:54:12,181 --> 00:54:16,500
everyone would laugh. It's the
other way around. Everybody gasps.

933
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:19,440
What she do is spike your drink
and fucking take your wallet.

934
00:54:23,570 --> 00:54:24,240
Okay.

935
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:28,360
That's a woman raped some man.
Um, all right. Uh, hey bill.

936
00:54:28,361 --> 00:54:30,420
A couple of months ago,
I went to a party,

937
00:54:30,430 --> 00:54:35,430
went to a garden party to reminisce
with my old France a couple months ago.

938
00:54:36,010 --> 00:54:38,830
That was Ricky Nelson. Everybody
if you didn't recognize it. Um,

939
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:42,340
a couple of months ago,
I went to a party with a few friends.

940
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:47,650
Among them was the girl that would become
my current girlfriend and a few drinks,

941
00:54:47,651 --> 00:54:50,830
but was shocked to see
just how drunk they got me.

942
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:54,670
I don't remember the entire night
because I was so drunk, you know,

943
00:54:54,671 --> 00:54:57,130
some of these is so fucking over the top.
I just can't believe.

944
00:54:57,131 --> 00:54:58,900
Don't even tell me.
Then you ended up with this person.

945
00:54:58,990 --> 00:55:00,100
I'm supposed to believe this.

946
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:05,680
I went to the bathroom twice because I
felt that was going to throw up. Today.

947
00:55:05,681 --> 00:55:10,580
My girlfriend confessed to me that she
and her friends had spiked my beer with

948
00:55:10,581 --> 00:55:15,370
shots of vodka.
That's not so bad at some college shit.

949
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,450
He didn't taste it.

950
00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:21,250
She thought it was a funny prank until
I clearly expressed how fucked up that I

951
00:55:21,251 --> 00:55:25,690
was. She apologized and all that
saying she never wanted to hurt me.

952
00:55:25,691 --> 00:55:27,900
But I'm thinking this is break upworthy.

953
00:55:28,150 --> 00:55:31,150
Most of my friends and
family agree I should leave.

954
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:33,790
This isn't the only issue
in our relationship.

955
00:55:33,791 --> 00:55:37,750
And I'm thinking red flags at this
caliber are too large to ignore.

956
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:41,030
Should I walk away?
We'll dude,

957
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:43,000
you only gave me one
piece of the puzzle there.

958
00:55:44,330 --> 00:55:44,840
Okay.

959
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:45,590
You know,

960
00:55:45,590 --> 00:55:48,800
if she was drunk and she was in a silly
mood with their friends and they fucking

961
00:55:48,801 --> 00:55:49,634
did that.

962
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:52,113
MMM.

963
00:55:53,150 --> 00:55:53,983
I Dunno.

964
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:59,080
But like it seems like there's a bunch
of other shit that she's doing and uh,

965
00:55:59,121 --> 00:56:01,640
you already seem convinced
that you should fucking walk.

966
00:56:01,641 --> 00:56:04,580
So I don't know what the other stuff is,
so I can't give you advice on that one.

967
00:56:04,581 --> 00:56:08,600
Sir. I don't have in that you,
you, I'm a hung jury on this one.

968
00:56:10,010 --> 00:56:12,950
I need, I need more information
and I don't know what to tell you.

969
00:56:14,350 --> 00:56:15,183
MMM.

970
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:20,010
So I dunno if that's the only one that
you were going to tell me and that's not

971
00:56:20,011 --> 00:56:21,990
a great way to start a relationship.

972
00:56:23,210 --> 00:56:24,043
Okay.

973
00:56:24,330 --> 00:56:28,730
It is kind of funny though.
I Dunno. I'm kind of an LTE,

974
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:30,100
so in a way that's my dream girl.

975
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:33,850
Do you know at some point you also got
to admit that she knows she did buy a

976
00:56:33,851 --> 00:56:38,240
couple of shots that night, didn't she?
You just didn't know it. Um, all right.

977
00:56:39,370 --> 00:56:41,860
I'm taking a lot of shit on me.
TV for me.

978
00:56:41,861 --> 00:56:44,560
TV taping,

979
00:56:44,561 --> 00:56:49,110
a couple episodes of 'em.
Oh,

980
00:56:49,111 --> 00:56:50,020
with what the fuck's,

981
00:56:50,021 --> 00:56:53,680
his name of that show was he was
show Valerie Bertinelli was in

982
00:56:56,210 --> 00:56:57,830
with the red headed lady.

983
00:56:58,710 --> 00:56:59,190
Okay.

984
00:56:59,190 --> 00:57:02,010
And then the other chick and
then Schneider next door.

985
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:05,840
The fuck was the name of that show.
Not The apartment.

986
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:11,160
Not The odd couple.
Not Three chicks in a janitor of,

987
00:57:11,161 --> 00:57:12,870
what the fuck was the name of that?
Shut God.

988
00:57:14,690 --> 00:57:16,400
S C H Snyder.

989
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:21,380
Sit Calm.
Let's see what we got.

990
00:57:21,381 --> 00:57:24,410
What do we get one day at a time.

991
00:57:25,850 --> 00:57:29,360
One day at a time. I take a
couple episodes of that and
then an episode of Alice.

992
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:32,180
I didn't remember how those
fucking theme songs went.

993
00:57:32,181 --> 00:57:34,400
Do you guys remember those
ones day in a day at a time

994
00:57:36,410 --> 00:57:37,243
theme?

995
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:43,750
It's called this,
is it the fuck out of here?

996
00:57:45,950 --> 00:57:49,480
What happened to my memory?
See if I remember this.

997
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:50,973
Okay.

998
00:57:53,910 --> 00:57:54,743
Oh yeah,

999
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:01,660
I used to have such good

1000
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:04,960
crush and Valerie Bertinelli, but
the, they were so fucking broke.

1001
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:08,680
That's what all these fucking
70 sitcoms were about.

1002
00:58:08,681 --> 00:58:10,660
They were just fucking broke ass people.

1003
00:58:12,370 --> 00:58:16,180
I guess it was a reflecting the
economy at the time, you know,

1004
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:18,940
like Alice was like,
you know,

1005
00:58:18,970 --> 00:58:23,970
divorce driving this piece of shit
to Phoenix Ford Ltd station wagon.

1006
00:58:39,710 --> 00:58:42,450
What is it that cannot
be the real fucking song

1007
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:47,030
that was fucking horrible singer.

1008
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:48,930
That's what happens when we let
the star of the show sing it.

1009
00:58:48,931 --> 00:58:52,230
Did she sing that fucking thing?
You know what?

1010
00:58:52,231 --> 00:58:55,200
I can actually block out the sing and
to listen to the old studio musicians.

1011
00:58:55,201 --> 00:58:57,070
That's what I missed because now
it's just some asshole. What?

1012
00:58:57,071 --> 00:58:58,770
The fucking laptop and the keyboard.

1013
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:02,070
Those are all individual people
playing all those instruments.

1014
00:59:02,950 --> 00:59:03,783
Oh

1015
00:59:13,670 --> 00:59:15,760
Jeez.
God

1016
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,360
got divorced,

1017
00:59:18,390 --> 00:59:22,840
got the station wagon and
I'm in a new neighbor hood.

1018
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:26,830
Remember that kid who played Tommy?
He was fucking adorable.

1019
00:59:26,831 --> 00:59:30,760
And then in between like
season five and season six,

1020
00:59:30,761 --> 00:59:33,880
he grew like three feet and
that includes his teeth.

1021
00:59:33,881 --> 00:59:37,660
All of a sudden you had these fucking
horse teeth. He was fucking gigantic.

1022
00:59:38,110 --> 00:59:43,110
He looked like he went from fucking being
her kid to be in the a walk on for the

1023
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:48,280
Phoenix Suns. Um, anyways,
that's the podcast for this. Uh,

1024
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:53,250
for this Monday, I want to thank
everybody that came out. Um,

1025
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:57,760
two shows at the majestic theater
on a Sunday night. And Noah,

1026
00:59:57,761 --> 01:00:00,130
you guys had to go to work the next day.
I had such a great time.

1027
01:00:00,131 --> 01:00:03,100
San Antonio is great. I didn't talk
about it. I went to the spurs game,

1028
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:06,910
went to the spark as far as fucking,
uh,

1029
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:12,430
against the La Clippers. Great
game. Fucking amazing fans. Very,

1030
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:16,840
very knowledgeable of the game. I got
to see their five championship trophies.

1031
01:00:16,841 --> 01:00:18,520
They got him right out
there where you can see him,

1032
01:00:18,610 --> 01:00:22,480
took a picture and all that
shit was great. And um,

1033
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:26,170
but I gotta tell you something.
If you want to win some free shit,

1034
01:00:26,171 --> 01:00:29,740
go to a spurs game. I've never seen so
much free shit given out of my life.

1035
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:30,911
First of all,

1036
01:00:30,911 --> 01:00:35,911
they had this coyote and a mask and a
up a guy in a coyote mascot costume and

1037
01:00:37,091 --> 01:00:42,091
like 19 times during the game he stoled
the vendor's cotton candy and they would

1038
01:00:42,791 --> 01:00:43,780
play the Benny Hill Song.

1039
01:00:47,430 --> 01:00:48,020
Yeah.

1040
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:50,630
And the vendor would sort of mock
chase them around is a thing,

1041
01:00:50,631 --> 01:00:53,030
was fucking throwing free
cotton candy all over the place.

1042
01:00:53,031 --> 01:00:54,590
They did that like 10 fucking times,

1043
01:00:55,310 --> 01:00:58,310
which made me immediately think like
they ordered too much cotton candy this

1044
01:00:58,310 --> 01:00:59,031
month.
It's going bad.

1045
01:00:59,031 --> 01:01:01,310
Let's just get rid of the shit
so we don't have to throw it out.

1046
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:04,910
And we'll also look like, you know,
like we're good guys for giving it away.

1047
01:01:06,410 --> 01:01:10,880
They had cookies coming down
from the ceiling in parachutes.

1048
01:01:11,630 --> 01:01:15,860
You know, they would just float down.
People jumping up for fucking cookies.

1049
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:19,430
They dragged some guy out of
the fucking crowd and put us,

1050
01:01:19,431 --> 01:01:23,390
put a couch that you could recline
it and they put it at the foul line.

1051
01:01:23,391 --> 01:01:26,570
They're like, if you could sit down and
you can fucking sink this file shot,

1052
01:01:26,571 --> 01:01:29,570
we're going to give you this couch.
And next thing you know,

1053
01:01:29,571 --> 01:01:32,570
I geeky like you forget about the game.
There's so much shit going on.

1054
01:01:32,571 --> 01:01:36,710
I'm rooting for this fucking couch potato
to when a new fucking couch to slowly

1055
01:01:36,711 --> 01:01:41,330
die on, you know, shoots the
first one. Oh, the next one,

1056
01:01:41,331 --> 01:01:46,130
rems out. Oh. And then he hits
it and it was like freaking out.

1057
01:01:46,310 --> 01:01:50,240
He's jumping up and down his man tits
flopping all over the place and then they

1058
01:01:50,241 --> 01:01:54,050
just drag this leather porn couch off guy.
You're fucking water and your water.

1059
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,960
All right. And then you're looking up at
the scoreboard like, oh, wait a minute,

1060
01:01:56,961 --> 01:02:00,920
I'm watching the fucking sparse.
They're playing the clippers.

1061
01:02:00,921 --> 01:02:04,160
That's what's happening here.
This is a critical part of the game.

1062
01:02:04,161 --> 01:02:07,640
There's a timeout.
Now I'm watching Awkward Dad's dancing.

1063
01:02:08,390 --> 01:02:13,340
Who's the Best Awkward Dad Dancing?
Other than that, it was fucking great.

1064
01:02:13,341 --> 01:02:17,840
I really enjoyed it. And um, that was
franchise number 118 that I've seen.

1065
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:20,250
I know I'm getting like
the rain man with this.

1066
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:22,380
I got eight left and
until the next season,

1067
01:02:22,410 --> 01:02:25,890
you know when the La chargers
in the Vegas Knights start.

1068
01:02:25,891 --> 01:02:29,520
But I plan on knocking
those guys out early, early.

1069
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:34,230
I might even go to that first charges
game just for them having the audacity to

1070
01:02:34,231 --> 01:02:39,150
fucking move on me. You
know, as of right now,

1071
01:02:39,151 --> 01:02:39,751
in this moment,

1072
01:02:39,751 --> 01:02:44,580
I've seen every team fucking west of the
Mississippi from fucking as far south

1073
01:02:44,581 --> 01:02:48,570
as San Antonio is far north is Edmonton
and these two consequent to come along

1074
01:02:48,571 --> 01:02:52,050
and fuck the whole thing up for me.
I will not tolerate that.

1075
01:02:52,110 --> 01:02:55,740
I will avoid my family. I will take a
trip and I will go see both of these.

1076
01:02:55,741 --> 01:02:58,350
Fuck why? I'll take a trip to San
Diego. I sound like a crazy person.

1077
01:02:58,351 --> 01:02:59,340
Go fuck yourselves.

1078
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,360
Thank you for listening and I'll
check in on you on Thursday.
