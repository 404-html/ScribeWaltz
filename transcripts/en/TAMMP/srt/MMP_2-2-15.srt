1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:02,730
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02,731 --> 00:00:05,970
It's bill burr and it's the Monday
morning podcast from Monday,

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,230
February 2nd, 2015. How
you doing? How the fuck?

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,770
Ah, yeah. Um,

5
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,300
I know what you guys are all expecting.

6
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:21,460
You guys are all expected me for to get
on this fucking podcast and to start

7
00:00:21,461 --> 00:00:26,320
going absolutely fucking crazy because
the new England patriots won another

8
00:00:26,321 --> 00:00:31,321
fucking Super Bowl and beat the loud
mouth green comments from Seattle.

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,940
You know what? There is nothing that
I would love to do more than that.

10
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:42,130
I would love to sit here and tell you
that I enjoyed every fucking second of

11
00:00:42,131 --> 00:00:43,240
that Goddamn game.

12
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:49,050
But unfortunately all freckles missed the
game every fucking second to that game

13
00:00:52,361 --> 00:00:55,360
I missed. And I know what you guys are
thinking. What Jesus felt. We were,

14
00:00:55,361 --> 00:01:00,300
you kidnapped. Did somebody chloroform
rag you. What the fuck happened? Um,

15
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:04,270
what happened was is I booked this
fucking tour in Australia, New Zealand,

16
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:09,280
Singapore. I hope this is the,
he's not gonna be too loud.

17
00:01:09,281 --> 00:01:12,220
I'm doing it on my fucking
iPhone because uh, you know,

18
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:15,460
cause I'm in fucking New Zealand and
I can't get any outlets to work and my

19
00:01:15,461 --> 00:01:19,090
batteries don't fucking work. I'm just
having a technological nightmare anyways.

20
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:22,630
You know, I booked this
fucking tour back in November.

21
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,530
How the hell did I know the Patriots are
going to be in the God damn Superbowl?

22
00:01:26,531 --> 00:01:27,700
I didn't know.
You know,

23
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:30,940
I'm one of the few fucking football
fans that actually admits that he had no

24
00:01:30,941 --> 00:01:35,200
fucking idea what his team was going to
do this year. I had no idea. You know,

25
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,770
um, I can't fucking believe
you want, I just landed.

26
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:43,330
I was literally in the air the exact
moment the fucking game started and when I

27
00:01:43,331 --> 00:01:47,440
landed it was fucking over. I
missed absolutely everything. Uh,

28
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:52,441
I'm obviously unbelievably psyched that
we won for a number of fucking reasons,

29
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,370
aside from the obvious,
you know,

30
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,790
more so than fucking excited that we won.

31
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:05,770
I'm just so happy that I didn't get
half to watch Richard Sherman run into

32
00:02:05,771 --> 00:02:09,010
fucking Brady's face and
disrespect the guy again.

33
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:13,510
That whole fucking you mad bro thing.
I just, I don't know. You know,

34
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,720
you run it up to a champion,
the guy's got three rings,

35
00:02:16,721 --> 00:02:20,980
you want a regular season game and you
treat him like he's a fucking rookie.

36
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:25,060
I mean, I dunno, I've never liked
people that do that type of shit.

37
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:28,630
I'm sure he's a hell of a guy to sit down
and have a fucking cap, a Chino with.

38
00:02:28,631 --> 00:02:32,110
But I just, you know, all that
mug into the camera and shit.

39
00:02:32,111 --> 00:02:35,250
I've already seen the highlights where
he did the 24 thing and all that.

40
00:02:35,251 --> 00:02:38,650
And I'm sure that's another thing that
would have kind of ruined the Superbowl

41
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,610
for me was every five seconds they got
to cut over to him or his reaction.

42
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:46,270
I hate when they do that to Tom Brady,
like at the other team scores.

43
00:02:46,271 --> 00:02:49,330
Then he got to see Tom Brady sitting there
with that. I'm mad. Look on his face.

44
00:02:49,331 --> 00:02:52,450
It's like, I this, there's too much
fucking coverage at this point.

45
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:57,190
Having said all of that.
Um, um, so it's, this is,

46
00:02:57,191 --> 00:03:00,370
this is still weird,
kind of like fucking excitement.

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,140
Like the level of excitement
I have right now is I,

48
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:07,690
I guess I know what it feels like
before the days of TV and radio.

49
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:08,411
You know,

50
00:03:08,411 --> 00:03:11,620
we just live in the middle of nowhere
and someone walks up to you and like,

51
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,010
Ethel did,
she here we won the war.

52
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,770
That's what I feel like right now.

53
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:22,040
I got on a fucking plane and um,

54
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,580
yeah,
I missed the whole thing.

55
00:03:24,581 --> 00:03:28,930
And I was praying to God that they were
going to have live TV because they had

56
00:03:28,931 --> 00:03:33,880
sports bars down here that had the
fucking game on and everything. And um,

57
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,560
you know, I know what a lot of
you guys are going to see. Well,

58
00:03:35,561 --> 00:03:38,710
why didn't you change your fucking flight?
Um,

59
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,610
because I am on the other side of the
fucking world and I can't miss shows

60
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:47,410
because of a fucking football game, be
it the Superbowl on not be the Superbowl.

61
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,980
Okay. With Tom Brady fucking cancel
a flight to watch one of my specials.

62
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:52,900
I don't think he would,
you know,

63
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:55,720
I don't want to get all Bronx tale
on you right now, but I, I, you know,

64
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:59,710
I got to fucking life. I
got to lead here. So, um,

65
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,970
uh, my God, I can't believe I missed
the fucking game, but, uh, pardon me.

66
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,380
When I saw the ending and
there was another fucking
ridiculous catching the ball

67
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:12,070
against your helmet and your ball bag
catch and it looked like we were going to

68
00:04:12,071 --> 00:04:14,710
lose again, I literally would
have died a thousand deaths.

69
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:15,580
I can tell you right now,

70
00:04:15,581 --> 00:04:18,850
I would have missed that interception
because after that fucking catch,

71
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:23,890
I would've been walking outside
doing laps around my house. Like,

72
00:04:23,891 --> 00:04:28,120
you gotta be fucking kidding
me. Um, but anyways, uh,

73
00:04:28,121 --> 00:04:32,500
I'm psyched that we want
obviously, and um, you know,

74
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:35,920
my condolences to Seattle Seahawks fans,
the real ones,

75
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,990
the ones from back in the kingdom era,

76
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:42,910
the ones that is still going to be in
your fucking stadium after Pete Carroll's

77
00:04:42,911 --> 00:04:46,660
gone and everybody's fucking gone.
And you guys, you know, stink. Again,

78
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,110
the same way to patriots will stink again
when Belichick and Brady lead those,

79
00:04:50,111 --> 00:04:51,250
the real fucking fans,

80
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,520
I feel bad for you all you fucking
loud mouth shit talk and fucking cunts.

81
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,560
Who were those lime green wigs?

82
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,740
You are the guys that I'm happy
that you'd fucking suffer that loss.

83
00:05:02,741 --> 00:05:06,970
Go Fuck yourselves with your
stupid 12th man fucking shirts.

84
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:12,430
Do you know I heard Seattle actually
has to pay the college Texas a and M for

85
00:05:12,431 --> 00:05:14,890
that 12th man thing that they
didn't come up with that, you know,

86
00:05:14,891 --> 00:05:18,910
so they got to pay them and not to
mention the buffalo bills had a 12th man

87
00:05:18,911 --> 00:05:22,540
thing, you know, back in the early
fucking nineties. I don't know.

88
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:27,670
I'm just so fucking happy that we won
and that, uh, you know, who knows.

89
00:05:27,671 --> 00:05:29,280
I'm sure they'll fucking dealt,

90
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:34,090
measure the thread count in the fucking
towels that we were using to drive the

91
00:05:34,091 --> 00:05:34,960
balls off with.

92
00:05:34,961 --> 00:05:38,470
I'm sure Jim Irsay is somewhere trying
to figure out a fucking way to try to

93
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:41,410
taint this fucking victory.
I swear to Christ.

94
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:45,370
Did you guys see that thing where the
Atlanta Falcons maybe got busted for

95
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:50,470
pumping extra crowd noise
in? Did you happen to catch
that story? I swear to God,

96
00:05:50,471 --> 00:05:52,240
if the Patriots did something like that,

97
00:05:52,241 --> 00:05:56,530
we would literally be sitting down in
front of the fucking Senate. You know,

98
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,300
that was another thing,
another

99
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,960
reason why I was so fucking happy that
we won because I'm so fucking sick of

100
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:06,450
winning games and these
fucking cunts bitching about.

101
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:07,720
Yeah.

102
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,160
Absolute horseshit.

103
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,500
Okay.

104
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,640
At the end of the fucking game, I
mean deflate gate, the flake gate,

105
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:15,810
all of that fucking shit.

106
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:20,160
And nobody brings up how many people on
the fucking Seattle Seahawks team had

107
00:06:20,161 --> 00:06:23,430
tested positive for steroids
over the last four fucking years.

108
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:28,290
Nobody brings up that Pete Carroll had
a championship taken away from him for

109
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:31,590
fucking cheating. And I gotta tell
you something. I don't give a fuck.

110
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:32,900
Yeah,

111
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,570
I don't give a fuck. That's
Seattle. Use Steroids.

112
00:06:35,571 --> 00:06:39,800
I'm sure what fucking using them too
and whatever fucking Pete Carroll did at

113
00:06:39,801 --> 00:06:40,670
the college level.

114
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,610
I know there's a bunch of other
coaches doing the same fucking thing.

115
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:48,130
So I don't know why people get
comfy with us, but who gives a fuck?

116
00:06:48,131 --> 00:06:52,470
We won the Goddamn thing and I am
literally sitting out here right in the

117
00:06:52,471 --> 00:06:56,370
fucking abyss. That's like,
I'm ridiculously excited.

118
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:57,880
Okay.

119
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,790
Like this must be like what it's
like to find out the Patriots won.

120
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:05,770
If you sit in and fucking Walpole
prison in like solitary confinement,

121
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,630
I can't fucking believe I missed it.
Jesus fucking Christ.

122
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:12,880
I'm sitting there watching
documentaries about cricket.

123
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,710
My fucking head phones won't work down
here. Nothing's fucking working. Um,

124
00:07:20,711 --> 00:07:22,120
so anyways,
if you called,

125
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:27,130
if you fucking are listening this week
to hear my blow by blow Horse Shit,

126
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,670
you're not going to get it this week. So
I suggest you listen to another podcast.

127
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:35,080
But if you want to know what my fucking
Australian tour is like in the New

128
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:39,610
Zealand, that's basically, uh, I
guess what I'm going to be a Todd.

129
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:44,350
Can't fucking believe. What
are the fucking odds? What
are the fucking odds step?

130
00:07:44,351 --> 00:07:47,110
Literally from the time my
flight started to when it ended,

131
00:07:47,111 --> 00:07:50,240
that was the exact time
that the game was on. Um, I,

132
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,780
I don't know anything about the gang.
I really don't.

133
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:56,410
I just know in the end is that Seattle
was up by 10 points and for some reason

134
00:07:56,411 --> 00:08:00,100
they're going to say that they lost the
game by not running Marshawn lynch in.

135
00:08:00,101 --> 00:08:04,570
But I would just say that if you were
up 10 points with a quarter to go,

136
00:08:04,571 --> 00:08:08,080
there's more than one reason why you
lost that fucking game. And uh, you know,

137
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,960
I don't think it's the worst
call in Superbowl history.

138
00:08:10,961 --> 00:08:13,690
I think it's going to be called
that because it didn't work.

139
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:19,150
You know what I mean? And
uh, if it fucking works,

140
00:08:19,151 --> 00:08:22,390
then he's a genius.
Let me talk about guts.

141
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:26,380
Everybody in the building is keying
on Marshawn Lynch and he dumped,

142
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:28,060
you know that that was going
to be the fucking thing.

143
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,870
I'm just so happy that the Patriots
didn't lose another Superbowl on some

144
00:08:31,871 --> 00:08:36,580
fucking circus catch.
I swear to God after the helmet catch.

145
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,850
Well, I guess, you know, I didn't
actually mind the fucking helmet.

146
00:08:39,851 --> 00:08:41,810
Catch as much as I met.

147
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:46,190
I was annoyed that a satay Samuel drop
that interception. Other than that,

148
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,390
um,

149
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:51,110
the 2007 Superbowl wasn't that bad because
I felt that the giants were a better

150
00:08:51,111 --> 00:08:52,940
team.
The second giant loss,

151
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:56,150
that one was brutal
because fucking blew that

152
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:59,390
game. Um, we fucking blew that game.

153
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:03,860
We had the right call and it was Brady
to Welker eight yard pass wide open and

154
00:09:03,861 --> 00:09:07,370
it bounces off his back fucking shoulder.
That would ice the game.

155
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,840
That was a fucking brutal one. But, uh,

156
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,630
that first one we definitely
lost. So anyways, there you go.

157
00:09:14,631 --> 00:09:18,770
Now the championship for Boston. How
do you like that New York City? Huh?

158
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:23,840
Nine championships and like 12 seasons.
What do you got?

159
00:09:23,841 --> 00:09:27,380
58 fucking teams and you can't even
do that yet. It's a fucking unreal.

160
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,990
Uh, uh, Jesus Christ. Why am I
shitting on fucking New York? You know,

161
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,980
I'm shitting on New York,
is it?

162
00:09:33,981 --> 00:09:36,550
My fucking team won the Superbowl and
I didn't even get the fucking, see.

163
00:09:36,551 --> 00:09:41,300
It's unbelievable. Unfucking
believable. So I guess I take the game,

164
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,360
so I'm going to have to watch it after
I do gigs in New Zealand and then

165
00:09:47,061 --> 00:09:50,570
Singapore, Hong Kong, Mumbai, India,

166
00:09:50,571 --> 00:09:53,420
and then I go to New York for
the Patrice O'neal la benefit.

167
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,710
Speaking of which last night, but when it,
what, uh, let me, let me just finish here.

168
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:01,340
Seriously. Do my condolences.
Tell to a Seattle Seahawk Trans.

169
00:10:01,341 --> 00:10:02,570
I don't break any balls a little bit.

170
00:10:02,571 --> 00:10:05,990
There's nothing fucking worse than losing
a God damn Superbowl and to lose it

171
00:10:05,991 --> 00:10:09,560
like that in the fucking end.
I know it fucking blows. Um,

172
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,610
but you know,
he just got fucking,

173
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:18,300
well that ex extra fucking horseshit
hype about you guys being loud, you know,

174
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:21,650
got a little annoying.
So maybe I am being a little bit of a con.

175
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:26,140
What are you going to do
anyways? Um, plowing ahead here.

176
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:27,783
Uh,

177
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:32,080
speaking of the Patrice O'neil comedy
benefit that we're doing for the third

178
00:10:32,081 --> 00:10:36,150
time, um, which I want to thank everybody
over the last three years who've,

179
00:10:36,151 --> 00:10:38,590
who've bought tickets
because you've really,

180
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:43,030
you've changed people's lives
that Patrice loved. All right.

181
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:47,260
I'm not going to get into the details
of it, but like, you know, yeah,

182
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:52,370
this does charities on the up and
up. I just know that, you know,

183
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:54,960
we're not doing a show
with a pink microphone.

184
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:01,200
Um,
this is so fucked up.

185
00:11:01,201 --> 00:11:06,040
Some people tweeted me so much shit about
awful commercials during the Superbowl

186
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,950
and I just had no idea.
I literally, you know,

187
00:11:07,951 --> 00:11:11,550
I might as well have been orbiting the
earth and the fucking space shuttle that

188
00:11:11,551 --> 00:11:15,520
that's like how, how much, how little I
know about whatever the fuck happened. Um,

189
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:20,730
I do know that it looked like a
hell of a game and uh, you know,

190
00:11:20,731 --> 00:11:23,310
my heart said we were going to win.
I had a feeling we were going to win,

191
00:11:23,311 --> 00:11:27,230
but my brain said that, uh, you know,

192
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:30,620
on paper we were going to lose.
And to be honest with you,

193
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:33,050
before the game started,
when I was thinking about it,

194
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,270
I had no feeling one way or the other.

195
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:38,420
I didn't have a bad feeling
like we were going to win.

196
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,930
I didn't have a good feeling.
Okay.

197
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,770
If we won by 40 or lost by 40 hours,

198
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:46,620
I I don't think either
would have surprised me.

199
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:50,760
I just had no fucking id on
this one. So, um, anyways,

200
00:11:50,761 --> 00:11:55,650
I feel like I'll let you guys down because
I was doing this fucking Goddamn tour

201
00:11:55,651 --> 00:11:59,100
and you wanted to hear me globe and
Shit. But, uh, you know, I'm not a guy,

202
00:11:59,101 --> 00:12:02,400
I'm not a guy who fucking gloats
anyways, come on. I break balls,

203
00:12:02,401 --> 00:12:03,250
but I don't fucking do dude.

204
00:12:03,251 --> 00:12:06,810
I'm not going to fucking sit here and go
act like I played the Goddamn game, but,

205
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,940
um,
anyways,

206
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:13,050
and as much as I don't like the way
Richard Sherman acts when he fucking wins,

207
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:15,520
that guy is one of the best
corners in the fucking Lakey is.

208
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:17,250
And I wish she was on my team,

209
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:20,820
although I wouldn't like to watch that
fucking dumb shit that he does. Um,

210
00:12:20,821 --> 00:12:25,380
so anyways, uh, like I said, speaking
of the Patrice O'Neal benefit,

211
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,970
um, last night I was playing
the, uh, the Sydney Opera House,

212
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:32,970
which was, it was a ridiculous
honor playing two shows there.

213
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:35,460
And at the end of the show,

214
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:39,750
somebody in the front row handed
me a shirt that they made, um,

215
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:43,390
that had Patrice, I'll take a
picture of it. It's fucking unreal.

216
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,700
It has Patrice on the front.

217
00:12:44,701 --> 00:12:49,701
And then on the back is Patrice
talking to me and it's got Colin Quinn,

218
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:53,670
uh, Keith Robinson, Jim Norton

219
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,700
who have Robert Kelly's in it. It's
the fucking shirt is unbelievable. And,

220
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,220
uh, the person that front row just handed
it to me as I was getting off this,

221
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:07,590
you know, it was, I was getting off really
quick, so I just grabbed it and I just,

222
00:13:07,591 --> 00:13:09,450
you know,
I handed them my setlist from the show,

223
00:13:09,451 --> 00:13:11,460
which I hope it didn't come
off as a douchey move on,

224
00:13:11,461 --> 00:13:15,000
just kind of getting off
stage there. And, um,

225
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:18,400
I didn't have a chance to look
at it until I got backstage. Um,

226
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,280
whoever you are that made that shirt,

227
00:13:20,281 --> 00:13:24,660
please try and reach out to me on
Twitter or whatever. Cause uh, you know,

228
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:28,350
I wish I could have thanked you,
um,

229
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:33,240
personally for cause it's a fucking
unbelievable, uh, piece of work.

230
00:13:33,241 --> 00:13:38,040
I don't know how the hell you did it
and I wish you made more of them. Um,

231
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:42,270
cause I know all my friends would love
one and it was just amazing. But, um,

232
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,051
anyways,

233
00:13:43,051 --> 00:13:48,051
I'm about a week into this tour
of Australia and it has been,

234
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,120
uh, you know, just take it right now.

235
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:53,580
I'm thinking of all the Patriots fans
that are just fucking shutting it off

236
00:13:53,581 --> 00:13:57,840
right now. Going, what the fuck, dude?
I thought he was going to go off. Sorry,

237
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:01,230
I didn't see the game.
Ah,

238
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:06,590
yes. Anyways, let me get back into the,
you know what I did do this week? I,

239
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,180
I saw some tennis.

240
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,200
Does that help you out at
all? This sports fans? I, um,

241
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:20,100
I went to the Australian Open,
I thought some tennis.

242
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:25,810
I saw Maria Sharapova and
the SMEs and I saw us,

243
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:29,990
Serena Williams, both winning the semis
to play each other in the finals. And uh,

244
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,360
if you've never been to a tennis match,

245
00:14:32,361 --> 00:14:35,490
this is so fucking funny to be doing this.
The day after Superbowl,

246
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:39,000
I might as well be baking a pie right now.
Um,

247
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:45,110
if you'd never been to a, uh, to a
fucking tennis match, you know what,

248
00:14:45,111 --> 00:14:49,970
just the level of wealth that is, they're
like, you know, um, you don't have,

249
00:14:49,971 --> 00:14:53,630
first of all, the tickets weren't
hard to get like a, you know,

250
00:14:53,631 --> 00:14:55,850
I just scalped a pair of them, you
know, I'm not gonna lie, you know,

251
00:14:55,851 --> 00:15:00,430
they were like 300 bucks a whack, but I'm
like, fuck it man. You know, it's, it's,

252
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:04,610
it's one of the majors. I'll fucking,
you know, bring it up on the card.

253
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,780
I'll deal with it later. Right.
Fuck it. And when you go there,

254
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:13,610
like the level of fucking wealth that's
sitting around there and they smell it

255
00:15:13,611 --> 00:15:18,260
on you when you show up the second they
see the fact that you're not wearing

256
00:15:18,261 --> 00:15:20,510
loafers with no socks on,

257
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:24,500
they just look at you like you're
a fucking animal. You know,

258
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,930
you watched him getting
old boozed up and shit.

259
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:29,740
And I always get excited when I
sit around. Those people just said,

260
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,730
I just want to ask them, you
know, Shit like, you know,

261
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:34,490
when's the dollar going to collapse?
Like,

262
00:15:34,491 --> 00:15:38,130
what's the insight information that you
fucking know? You know those people,

263
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,950
they'd like, they sit there, right?

264
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:43,370
They have tickets for the whole day
we just had for the afternoon. Right.

265
00:15:43,371 --> 00:15:47,630
And it's sitting there and they got,
they were like the sweaters, you know,

266
00:15:47,631 --> 00:15:50,570
where you're not wearing it, you just
have it draped over your shoulder.

267
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,600
You don't, you don't have a tied around
your neck, you just have it draped over.

268
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:56,750
I think that's the new way to do it.
And then not doing it like ironically,

269
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:01,700
like they have a sweater for when it
gets cold later when they're watching the

270
00:16:01,701 --> 00:16:05,870
tennis. But anyways, we sat close enough,

271
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:11,300
um, and got, got to watch Serena right
before she won the, uh, the 19th,

272
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:14,180
her 19th championships.
So I got to do that.

273
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:18,760
I went to Bond Scott's
grave when I was out in, uh,

274
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:23,030
when I was out in Perth and um,
it was really cool.

275
00:16:23,031 --> 00:16:25,890
They had a little bench there
cause I guess bonds, Ma,

276
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:29,990
mother for as far as I know, is still
alive. She's well into her nineties,

277
00:16:29,991 --> 00:16:33,920
and up until recently would go down and
visit the grave every almost every day,

278
00:16:33,921 --> 00:16:36,160
which of course is really
sad, but they, so they made,

279
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,470
they raised some money and they made like
a little bench for her and everything.

280
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:42,370
And uh, you know, it's, it's,

281
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,350
if you ever get a chance to go to
Australia and Perth, first of all,

282
00:16:45,351 --> 00:16:46,370
purpose is the shit.

283
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:49,460
I talked to some woman when I was here
in the states and she tried to tell me,

284
00:16:49,461 --> 00:16:51,950
you know, she was from Australia and
she was shitting all over at saint it.

285
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:56,600
Like it was, you know, that it was
fucking horrific or whatever. It's uh,

286
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,120
it's quite the opposite man.
Very impressive city.

287
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,520
It seems like the kind of place where you,
a

288
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,200
vacation or something man and beautiful
beaches. That was another thing.

289
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,060
Cool tools.
We uh,

290
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:12,410
we went down to the beach one day and
I quit laugh and fuck you. I know.

291
00:17:12,411 --> 00:17:15,170
I'm pasty, but I had
to do it, you know, um,

292
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:21,260
and just to see the Indian
Ocean, you know, never seen that.

293
00:17:21,261 --> 00:17:21,840
And I'm,

294
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:25,820
my wife of course went in the ocean cause
she fucking loves the ocean and I sort

295
00:17:25,821 --> 00:17:30,320
of frolicked along the fucking
along the fucking beach.

296
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,460
I just do not go,

297
00:17:31,461 --> 00:17:34,430
I went into the water just to say
I've been in the fucking Indian Ocean,

298
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,280
but I do not fuck with,

299
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:41,470
I just don't fuck with the
ocean on any level. And uh,

300
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,450
but if I was going to fuck with it,
I would go all in.

301
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,750
Like I would get certified to scuba dive
and the next time I come here I would

302
00:17:47,751 --> 00:17:51,620
go to the Great Barrier Reef and that
I would do that before I would fucking

303
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:56,210
just start, I don't know, swimming,
align the fucking coast, you know,

304
00:17:56,211 --> 00:18:01,040
like I guess that the sharks
come out in the morning.

305
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:03,470
They, they're basically
out when the seals are out,

306
00:18:03,471 --> 00:18:05,270
so you don't want to be
out when the seals are out.

307
00:18:05,271 --> 00:18:09,260
I guess it's early morning
and dusk or something. And um,

308
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:11,270
they,

309
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:15,000
they were telling me some fucking story
where there was a helicopter following

310
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:17,250
an 18 foot tiger shark.

311
00:18:17,251 --> 00:18:20,820
Just keeping an eye on it to make sure
it didn't go into the beach area. I mean,

312
00:18:20,821 --> 00:18:25,340
give me a fucking break. I'm not
going to that God damn water. You.

313
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:27,030
What's funny about the
Australia is down here too.

314
00:18:27,031 --> 00:18:29,340
When they talk about somebody
getting attacked by a shark,

315
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:33,270
they don't say you got to attack. They
say he got taken and I was like, yeah,

316
00:18:33,271 --> 00:18:36,850
there was a bloke got taken. I don't say
bloke. I came up the fuck they said this,

317
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:41,640
if you'd like. Some dude got taken
about 20 miles up. They told a story.

318
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:44,280
I don't even know if this is true,
if they just trying to scare a tourist,

319
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:49,620
but they were saying this fucking
guy was surfing and he was, you know,

320
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,660
not waiting for a wave.

321
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:55,470
He was in the wave riding the wave I
should say in the fucking shark and jumped

322
00:18:55,471 --> 00:18:59,990
out of the water and grabbed him
like some sharp NATO shit. Like I'm,

323
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,590
he jumped out of the fucking wall.

324
00:19:01,591 --> 00:19:04,860
I thought you had to have like your
arms hanging off the board and then from

325
00:19:04,861 --> 00:19:09,600
underneath you look like a seal.
Sort of a strange shape seal or whatever.

326
00:19:09,601 --> 00:19:12,360
But like, if you're, if you're
fucking on the board at that point,

327
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:16,830
if they're jumping out of the water, I
don't know. I don't know. Like I'm saying,

328
00:19:16,831 --> 00:19:21,240
I don't fuck with the water, but I had a,
uh, I really had a great time in Perth.

329
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:21,480
Uh,

330
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:26,010
my favorite beer out here is that little
creatures and it turns out they had a

331
00:19:26,011 --> 00:19:29,950
brewery and I was able to
go to the brewery. I could
have taken the tour, but I,

332
00:19:29,951 --> 00:19:33,900
I don't understand going,
taking a tour of a fucking brewery,

333
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,930
looking at the, uh,
the distillery process.

334
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:41,610
All I look at is like the entire
time I'm taking this tour,

335
00:19:41,611 --> 00:19:46,200
I could be drinking your product
fresh out of your fucking big silver,

336
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:51,060
whatever the fuck you call those things.
So a boost it up there.

337
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,620
Um, went over to bond Scott's grave
like I mentioned. And uh, you know,

338
00:19:55,621 --> 00:19:58,410
it's funny when you get there, like
people all, it's kind of weird.

339
00:19:58,411 --> 00:20:02,490
People leave like all these, you
know, bottles of booze there.

340
00:20:02,491 --> 00:20:05,460
It's like the guy kind of died
from that, you know. I mean,

341
00:20:05,461 --> 00:20:07,290
do you somebody overdoses on heroin?

342
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:11,520
Do you leave like fucking used needles
there? And it's really weird. But um,

343
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:16,260
I kind of felt bad when I showed up and
there was an empty Miller genuine draft

344
00:20:16,261 --> 00:20:20,370
bottle next to bond Scott's grave.
And the uh,

345
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:24,420
the ACD,
not only the ACDC fan and me,

346
00:20:24,421 --> 00:20:27,210
the beer lover in me wanted to
take it away from the grape,

347
00:20:27,211 --> 00:20:29,800
but there was just something about
removing something from that place.

348
00:20:29,801 --> 00:20:34,210
Just seemed a little a sacrilegious.
So I refrained from doing that.

349
00:20:34,211 --> 00:20:35,410
But if you ever get to Perth,

350
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:40,160
they have this own little entrance
little gateway and you come walk,

351
00:20:40,161 --> 00:20:42,370
he says Bon Scott entry or
something like that. I took,

352
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:45,130
I'll have all the pictures
up on the podcasts. I,

353
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:50,010
I did a retweet some this
shit. But you walk in, um,

354
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,820
very easy headstone to find.
And a,

355
00:20:53,821 --> 00:20:57,270
if you look down on the ground,
they have like a lightening bolt,

356
00:20:57,271 --> 00:20:59,760
like the ACDC lightening
bolt in the pavement.

357
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,970
And then above it is like
a looks like a record.

358
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:07,380
And then they had something else. I forget
what it was. Uh, which is really cool.

359
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:10,770
So it just sort of guide you right to it.
And um,

360
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,870
and then if you go over,
down onto the wall,

361
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:18,920
the water where they have the little
creatures makes their beer and shit a

362
00:21:19,051 --> 00:21:21,840
little bit further up from that.
They have a statue of Bon Scott,

363
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:23,430
which I think used to be in the graveyard,

364
00:21:23,431 --> 00:21:26,250
but they moved it because I guess
back in the day he was a deckhand,

365
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,330
a red decky as they call it down
here in Australia. So they, uh,

366
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:34,800
they put them down there on the water
and um, I don't know. It was really cool.

367
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:38,370
And, uh, what did I go from
there? Then I went to Melbourne,

368
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,740
I got there and that was a, uh,
that's when I saw the Australian Open,

369
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:47,160
did a couple shows that night.
And um,

370
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:50,520
evidently some comics came out
to see me throughout this tour.

371
00:21:50,521 --> 00:21:52,020
I'm glad I didn't know
they weren't in the crowd.

372
00:21:52,021 --> 00:21:55,290
That would've made me fucking nervous.
Um,

373
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:58,750
and I basically been putting
together my new hour out here,

374
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:00,130
watching this thing come together,

375
00:22:00,131 --> 00:22:02,290
get my fucking standup
shops back together again.

376
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:03,520
It's going to fuck just been a great tool.

377
00:22:03,521 --> 00:22:06,480
I really want to thank
everybody who came out and um,

378
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:07,540
okay.

379
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,940
You know,
throughout my time here in Australia,

380
00:22:09,941 --> 00:22:13,450
this has been a fucking incredible to
come out here and play these big venues

381
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,080
and be adding shows and stuff.
Uh Oh.

382
00:22:17,081 --> 00:22:20,150
Then I did Brisbane and um,

383
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:25,350
had a fucking, uh, I don't know how to,

384
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,590
one of my best shows I had in
Brisbane and then I got all,

385
00:22:28,591 --> 00:22:31,080
I got pictures of all this shit. Sorry
guys. I'm a little fucking jet lag.

386
00:22:31,081 --> 00:22:33,710
I know this shit isn't funny. I'm just
kind of go through my fucking tour here.

387
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:36,990
I played city hall. There was one of
the best looking theaters I ever played.

388
00:22:36,991 --> 00:22:40,800
Literally you could shoot a fucking
special there. It was phenomenal. Um, oh,

389
00:22:40,801 --> 00:22:44,730
here's what I got a funny fucking story
for you. All right. Listen to this shit.

390
00:22:44,731 --> 00:22:46,380
So I'm going to fucking security.

391
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:47,970
Okay.

392
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:48,803
All right.

393
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:52,460
And they have the reg regular metal
detector and then they got the fucking

394
00:22:52,461 --> 00:22:54,350
ex-ray one that I don't go through.

395
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,270
Yeah.

396
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:58,570
I don't go through that fucking thing
cause I don't give a shit what they tell

397
00:22:58,571 --> 00:23:00,580
me.
Death thing is not good for you.

398
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,270
I remember when it first fucking came
out and people were opting out and I

399
00:23:04,271 --> 00:23:06,280
remember people going,
look, Ooh, it's a big deal.

400
00:23:06,281 --> 00:23:09,430
You already talk on your cell phone.
Like all that dumb shit that people say.

401
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,080
You know?
Um,

402
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:12,450
yeah,

403
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:15,660
yeah. It's like, oh yeah, so why
don't I get extra radiation, you know,

404
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,690
but I just add to it. Just makes
sure I get fucking cancer. Right.

405
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:22,680
And what did they say? They tried to say
that the thing was totally fucking safe.

406
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:26,760
And then what ends up happening after a
year and a half of radiating everybody

407
00:23:26,761 --> 00:23:27,900
in my country too much,

408
00:23:27,901 --> 00:23:30,510
they realized that they had the
fucking thing turned up too high.

409
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:33,830
And to this fucking day, when you
go through one of those, if they,

410
00:23:33,831 --> 00:23:34,950
if a kids young enough,

411
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:39,980
they fucking send them around because it
fucking retards the puberty process or

412
00:23:40,501 --> 00:23:43,290
something like that. But I'm supposed
to go through it, go fuck yourself.

413
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:46,170
So I always opt out and
I don't give a fuck about

414
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:49,140
your opinion on this by the way.
I don't need to hear your fucking opinion.

415
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:52,560
This is just my opinion. If you want
to go through the fucking thing,

416
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:53,760
more power to you.

417
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:57,660
So I'm down here in Australia and they
got the regular one and then they got the

418
00:23:57,661 --> 00:23:59,310
fucking,
the bad one.

419
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:03,690
So every third person or whatever
it has to go through, whatever.

420
00:24:03,691 --> 00:24:04,980
So I come up and guess what?

421
00:24:04,981 --> 00:24:07,980
They want me to go to the other
one and it and I'm like, yeah,

422
00:24:07,981 --> 00:24:11,820
I'm opting out and they like,
you can opt out in Australia.

423
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:15,570
So now I'm in this fucking thing where
I'm challenging authority in a different

424
00:24:15,571 --> 00:24:20,010
country, which is always scary.
But I just said I'm not, I'm not,

425
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:26,250
I'm not going through it. And the guys
starts going like, oh well he goes,

426
00:24:26,251 --> 00:24:27,600
do you mind if I ask
you why? And I go, yeah,

427
00:24:27,601 --> 00:24:31,020
cause he used to work in a dental office
and I took fucking x rays and I put a

428
00:24:31,021 --> 00:24:35,310
led vest over somebody before I fucking
took an x ray and I got cancer in my

429
00:24:35,311 --> 00:24:37,230
family, so I don't want to
go through it. And he goes,

430
00:24:37,231 --> 00:24:41,190
well you can opt out here plus the ones
down. Here you go. He goes, this thing is,

431
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:44,250
he goes, ecosystem only sees through
your pockets is fucking rent a cop.

432
00:24:44,251 --> 00:24:47,370
Like he knows how this fucking
thing works, right? Oh,

433
00:24:47,371 --> 00:24:50,520
just see through your
pockets. Really you fat. Fuck.

434
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:53,970
What do you know about anything other
than eating too many fucking donuts?

435
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,530
You Do, right? So I say to the guy, I go,

436
00:24:58,531 --> 00:25:00,840
well we had the one in the states, they
had it turned up too high. It goes,

437
00:25:00,841 --> 00:25:04,620
this is a different one. I go, no it
isn't. I go, that's the same company.

438
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:07,500
I'm not going through
it. He goes, all right,

439
00:25:07,501 --> 00:25:09,180
well then you have to stand
over there. And I'm like, fine.

440
00:25:09,181 --> 00:25:11,400
So the guy fucking makes me stand
over there for like 10 minutes.

441
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:16,550
Then this other fucking guy comes walking
over and he's got this little fucking,

442
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:19,010
do you know like when you don't like you,

443
00:25:19,011 --> 00:25:22,890
when you get your baseball team schedule
or your hockey team schedule for the

444
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:26,730
fucking year, he comes over with one
with one of those that's like four pages.

445
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:31,050
Most of it is pictures and he goes,
if you just want to read up on it,

446
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:32,790
and I'm just started laughing like what?

447
00:25:32,791 --> 00:25:37,320
That little kid's book you have there
that explains that complex fucking machine

448
00:25:37,321 --> 00:25:41,270
over there. And he goes, no.
When he explains it, I go,
who to? Who explained it?

449
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:45,150
The people who made that fucking thing.
I'm obviously not cursing at them,

450
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:49,440
but they just said, you can't fuck an
opt out. It's a lot down here. Now,

451
00:25:49,441 --> 00:25:52,290
if I had the fucking
time and the wherewithal,

452
00:25:52,291 --> 00:25:55,050
the presence of mind during that
conversation, I should have said,

453
00:25:55,051 --> 00:25:58,290
tell me what law it is.
Tell me what fucking law that says.

454
00:25:58,291 --> 00:26:02,640
I have to go through that fucking thing.
Pat me down. We don't do that here.

455
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:06,980
Well you should fucking start
fucking unreal.

456
00:26:06,981 --> 00:26:09,560
So then I ended up having to
go through the God damn thing.

457
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,800
The guy was actually nice. He apologized
for it and I just said, listen man,

458
00:26:13,801 --> 00:26:16,290
I know it's not you. It's, this is
what it always is. It's not you.

459
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,440
You're just the guy here who has to
tell me I have to fucking go through it.

460
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:22,620
But the real cops who were making money
off their, who fly fucking private,

461
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,210
who never have to go through that thing,

462
00:26:24,211 --> 00:26:27,090
don't have to worry about having their
entire fucking head all the way down to

463
00:26:27,091 --> 00:26:29,430
be a balls in their fucking toes.
Radiated.

464
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:33,220
So is if there's anybody out there that
it has a fucking scientific background

465
00:26:33,221 --> 00:26:36,810
and can explain to me how something that
can see through my fucking clothes is

466
00:26:36,811 --> 00:26:40,500
not a, it's not a, uh, it's
not some sort of an x ray.

467
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:45,430
I mean, Jesus Christ Drinking
Coca Cola can give you cancer.

468
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:50,470
You're telling me standing in that fucking
thing head the fucking toe puts your

469
00:26:50,471 --> 00:26:53,210
arms up. Oh, just shoots beans out yet.

470
00:26:53,211 --> 00:26:55,740
It's just looking at what's
in your pockets. Oh yes.

471
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:59,290
Is that why you want to come up the other
side? There's an entire image of me.

472
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,590
Yeah.

473
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:05,390
I don't know. So whatever. So that was my
fucking big goddamn moment. Fucking fat.

474
00:27:05,391 --> 00:27:07,940
Fuck. Make, make me stand there for
legs. Another thing that they do,

475
00:27:07,941 --> 00:27:10,850
that passive aggressive thing is they
make you stand there for fucking 10

476
00:27:10,851 --> 00:27:13,220
minutes trying to break your will.

477
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:15,920
No one that you probably
late for your flight.

478
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:20,460
I fucking hate myself that I didn't
say. You know what? Let me, uh,

479
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:27,410

you show me the Goddamn fucking law there.

480
00:27:27,411 --> 00:27:30,290

these people's tweets now saying, ah

00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:31,820

489
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:59,270
I made a lot of friends in that
movie and uh, Kevin Costner, uh,

490
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:02,930
kind of put up his money for the whole
fucking movie. He financed the thing. So,

I'm reading this from down in New Zealand.
Sherry's berries.

496
00:28:21,381 --> 00:28:24,440
If she tells you she does not
want anything for Valentine's Day,

497
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:27,770
what she means is,
is get me something for Valentine's Day.

498
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:31,550
Don't you love how this fucking holiday
is just so geared toward broads?

499
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,270
I just don't understand
this whole fucking holiday.

500
00:28:35,271 --> 00:28:37,940
And I like how it's just about them.

isn't there that there's some somewhere
there's a fucking day and they

503
00:28:42,981 --> 00:28:45,890
completely blow it off
because we don't give a fuck.

504
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,100
The last thing we want them
to do is to talk more to us.

505
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:53,690
Even if they're saying something
nice. Anyways, show her. Yeah.

00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:33,940

strawberries and some flowers. Perfect.

576

I actually love this I advertising
and I totally endorse this.

577
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:30,800
This is exactly what you should
get thrown a stuffed bear too.

578
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:35,030
There you go sweetheart. And if she gives
you shit, all you gotta say is the fuck.

579
00:33:35,031 --> 00:33:39,390
Did you get me? You know, exactly. Yeah.

580
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,450
Each is strawberry. Smell your
flowers and shut your face in tonight.

581
00:33:42,451 --> 00:33:45,040
You're cut on one with the
bear cause I'm sick again. Um,

582
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,520
get it done early before it's too late.
Profile was,

583
00:33:47,521 --> 00:33:49,080
makes it easy to check off the list.

584
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:53,040
Even if you already have Valentine's Day
plans, you still need flowers delivered.

585
00:33:53,041 --> 00:33:56,550
It's a must. When she say she does,
when she says she doesn't need flowers,

586
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:00,450
she means you better get me
flowers or isn't that convenient?

587
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,510
Is that what she means? People who sell
flowers, how come it doesn't mean I want,

588
00:34:04,511 --> 00:34:08,600
I'm fucking butter. Basted
a pork chop. All right,

589
00:34:08,601 --> 00:34:12,020
go to full proflowers.com click on the
blue microphone in the top right hand

590
00:34:12,021 --> 00:34:13,750

591
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,260

on the microphone and type
in birth bur order today.

592
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:21,110
This deal expires Friday at midnight.

593
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:22,903
All right?

594
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,140
Sure. I'll get some shit about those,
but they don't understand that.

595
00:34:26,141 --> 00:34:27,770
I know who you guys are in that,

596
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,830
that that'll make you actually
buy those fucking things.

597
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:34,590
You Know Valentine's Day?
What are you going to get her?

598
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:38,140
What's going to happen?
It's the stupidest fucking thing ever.

599
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:41,470
My wife is cool as shit. You know what
we do? I've told you this for years.

600
00:34:41,471 --> 00:34:44,320
We don't go out on Valentine's Day
and we don't buy each other anything.

601
00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:49,060
We go out like three days after a
couple of days before when food costs,

602
00:34:49,061 --> 00:34:51,730
what it's supposed to cost. We
sit down, we have a nice meal,

603
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:57,200
we shoot the shit and that's fucking it.
I don't go to cvs and buy fucking,

604
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,520
oh, they'd fucking confetti. Whatever
the fuck it is you supposed to do.

605
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,400
I don't know. I'm in such a country moved
because I missed the super Superbowl.

606
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,790
You can't fucking believe it
and we want, goddammit, we want,

607
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,940
I'm so fucking psyche one on not
even winning. I just so site.

608
00:35:10,941 --> 00:35:12,890
They don't have to hear
it from Seattle fans.

609
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:14,270
Yeah,

610
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:14,781
so site.

611
00:35:14,781 --> 00:35:17,810
They don't want to listen to another
fucking Goddamn story about how fucking

612
00:35:17,811 --> 00:35:20,540
loud they are and that and
nobody addressing that.

613
00:35:20,541 --> 00:35:23,390
The stadium is built to make
them louder than they really are.

614
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,680
Fucking drives me up the wall,
but whatever. You know what?

615
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,390
This is the first 24 hours,

616
00:35:29,391 --> 00:35:32,930
I'm sure Jim or say we'll figure out a
way to save somehow we were cheating.

617
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:38,080
All right, let's get into the
questions for this week. Everybody. Um,

618
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:40,960
wait,
am I told him I fucking stories.

619
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:44,200
I really don't have a lot of stories
about here being down here in Australia

620
00:35:44,201 --> 00:35:47,980
other than the people are unbelievably
friendly. It's really relaxed.

621
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:51,910
It's a ridiculously
underrated place to go.

622
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,030
And um,
for tennis fans,

623
00:35:55,031 --> 00:35:59,950
if you want to go to a great city and
if you want to go to an unbelievable

624
00:35:59,951 --> 00:36:01,390
fucking venue,
gold,

625
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:06,420
go to the Australian Open and go
into the rod like fucking arena.

626
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:13,150
I mean
I went to the u s open like twice,

627
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:18,070
like 10 12 years ago and it's a giant,
it's for tennis. It's still a huge,

628
00:36:18,071 --> 00:36:21,620
it's really big venue. And you know,
we were sitting up top and they were,

629
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:25,690
they know they were very far away.
This, this venue, I swear to God,

630
00:36:25,691 --> 00:36:28,000
it felt like I was watching
it with 600 other people.

631
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:30,940
Like you could hear everything,

632
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:34,040
like Serena would throw the
ball up and if you know,

633
00:36:34,041 --> 00:36:37,360
like when you throw it up
and then you don't serve, you
know, you just felt weird.

634
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:40,420
You just grabbed the ball to serve again,
he'd literally, here we go, sorry, sorry.

635
00:36:40,421 --> 00:36:41,254
Sorry.

636
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:45,190
I felt like I was at her house and she's
playing in the backyard or something

637
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,410
was amazing. And, um,

638
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:52,600
I would say that Melbourne
is probably the, uh,

639
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:54,880
like if you're,
I dunno,

640
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:59,540
I would say that that's sort of the
New York City of a, of Australia.

641
00:36:59,541 --> 00:37:00,520
If I'm going to get shit right now,

642
00:37:00,521 --> 00:37:01,870
if I'm just starting to
try to compare to this,

643
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:04,060
is this is made knowing very
little about their country.

644
00:37:04,061 --> 00:37:05,000
That seems like more like,

645
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:06,583
you know,

646
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:12,770
I don't know. We're all like a lot of
the, just where all the shit is, you know,

647
00:37:12,771 --> 00:37:15,430
and you're not spoiled. New Yorkers
are, since they grew up in New York,

648
00:37:15,431 --> 00:37:17,770
everything is right there.
So when they go every place,

649
00:37:17,771 --> 00:37:19,060
they think every place else sucks.

650
00:37:19,061 --> 00:37:22,120
I've kind of noticed that Melbourne people
kind of think every place else sucks.

651
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:25,870
Um, but, uh,

652
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:29,500
and I think Sydney is more
like a touristy place.

653
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:33,060
Both have their merits or whatever. It
all depends on what age you are, what you,

654
00:37:33,061 --> 00:37:36,940
whatever the fuck you're into.
And, um, Brisbane was the shit.

655
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:41,830
I had a great time up there.
Beautiful beaches. What do they got?

656
00:37:41,831 --> 00:37:44,710
The gold coast or some shit like that
around there. I don't know much about it,

657
00:37:44,711 --> 00:37:46,600
but it was just a
phenomenal place to visit.

658
00:37:46,601 --> 00:37:49,630
And I was actually a little
melancholy when I was leaving.

659
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:54,280
And also one of the great
things is when a comedian,

660
00:37:54,281 --> 00:37:58,090
I actually started out with Al del Benny,
I got to uh,

661
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,970
he married an Australian girl and uh,

662
00:38:00,971 --> 00:38:05,350
they relocated to Sydney outside
of Sydney about a year ago.

663
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:07,390
And uh,
he hit me up out of the blue,

664
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:11,740
asked if he could come down and hang
out for a show. And he actually,

665
00:38:11,741 --> 00:38:16,240
I throw them on and did about five,
seven minutes before each show. And uh,

666
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:20,650
it was great just hanging out with him,
talking about the fucking old days,

667
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:23,020
trying to figure out how the
hell we became the old guys.

668
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:26,440
Like I saw a thing the other day that,
you know, the same like top 20 comics,

669
00:38:26,441 --> 00:38:29,110
new comics to watch. So you
know, I'm a fan of stand up.

670
00:38:29,111 --> 00:38:33,880
I want to see who's coming up. And I
probably knew like two of them and um,

671
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:35,830
and I was looking at him like,
Jesus Christ,

672
00:38:35,831 --> 00:38:39,950
I've been doing stand up since all
of these people that they're shown.

673
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:43,190
We're probably like anywhere from
two years old to eight years old.

674
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:48,310
So starting to feel my fucking
age here. Um, but anyways,

675
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:51,910
um, a New Zealand and I missed
the Superbowl, you know,

676
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:54,460
if you're going to miss a fucking
Superbowl flying to New Zealand,

677
00:38:54,461 --> 00:38:58,770
I got to think is a pretty good. Got It.
Thanks is a pretty good excuse. Um, okay.

678
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:02,230
Got To admit being down here and not here
in any of the Superbowl hype or any of

679
00:39:02,231 --> 00:39:06,220
that type of shift. I really fucking
enjoyed it. Did Not miss any of that,

680
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:11,380
any of this shit. Oh, did you hear so
and so said this? Somebody said this,

681
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:14,470
blah, blah, blah, blah
blah and I fucking crap.

682
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:19,340
I'm so fucking psyched. I miss that.
And that's like that Mr Goddamn game.

683
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:23,410
Um, anyways, Australian
food. You know what's weird?

684
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:27,280
I'll actually do a recap of the Superbowl
when I get back after like February,

685
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:30,620
you know, and I'm back February.
Whenever the fuck I get back at, um,

686
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:35,650
I'll watch the game helped do a special,
I'll do a special podcast and bid week.

687
00:39:35,651 --> 00:39:39,860
How about that? And I'll react to the
game. Like it just happened. Yeah. Okay.

688
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:43,440
That Jesus film. Anyways, Australian
food. Let's get to the, uh,

689
00:39:43,441 --> 00:39:44,880
the questions here for this week.

690
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:46,580
Okay.

691
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:50,150
Hey Bill, I'd never been to
Australia. I've watched my
fair share of food network,

692
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,940
but I've never heard of
authentic Australian cuisine.

693
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:56,750
The whole shrimp on the Barbie thing has
to be exaggerated and I'm pretty sure

694
00:39:56,751 --> 00:40:00,710
the only people who drank Foster's are
morons not living on that prison island.

695
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,390
What's the meal you've had so far?
Uh,

696
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,440
what's the best meal you've had so far
and can you give me some insight as to

697
00:40:06,441 --> 00:40:09,620
what you think, uh, as
to what they're known for

698
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,030
down under,
down on that.

699
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:15,020
Thanks. And go fuck yourself,
dude. I have to be honest with you.

700
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:19,670
I am barnstorming across this
part of the world. I land,

701
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:23,360
I do a show and then I go to
the airport. Um, occasionally,

702
00:40:23,361 --> 00:40:26,750
like today I landed in New Zealand and I
have tonight to go out and grab a quick

703
00:40:26,751 --> 00:40:30,960
drink. And then tomorrow
I have to do the show. Um,

704
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:32,840
I've been doing a lot of press
when I've been over here.

705
00:40:32,841 --> 00:40:34,670
I haven't really seen or done shit.

706
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:39,020
Um,
I've drank a lot.

707
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:40,970
What are they known for?

708
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:45,060
I don't know. The food over here is
great to see foods, obviously tremendous.

709
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:46,380
You know what they're
really known for over here.

710
00:40:46,381 --> 00:40:47,730
I think they're known for their beaches.

711
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:52,370
Um, beautiful people, men, women
over here. Yeah. Fucking uh,

712
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:55,690
over and not over here anymore. I'm in
New Zealand, but they're fucking gorgeous.

713
00:40:55,691 --> 00:40:58,810
But as far as the food was the best thing,
I've had a,

714
00:40:58,811 --> 00:41:03,220
I got to tell you something, man. I've
had some French fries or chips down here.

715
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,080
Ordered Room Service.
This one fucking hotel,

716
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,950
one of the best order of French
fries I've ever fucking head.

717
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,710
That's the only thing that I can
think of that's, that has stood out.

718
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:16,180
Other than that, everything, the
food has been great. Um, but I mean,

719
00:41:16,181 --> 00:41:19,540
I haven't had any fucking kangaroo
or any shit like that. I don't know.

720
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:22,380
I have no idea. Sorry man. MMM.

721
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:25,190
Can you guys tell a fucking jet lag?
Diane,

722
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,480
I really apologize for this
fucking podcast so far. Um,

723
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:34,280
El Camino looking cars in Perth.
Okay. Hey Bill, on last week's

724
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:34,851
podcast,

725
00:41:34,851 --> 00:41:39,320
you said you saw two guys in El Camino
looking cars driving like assholes in

726
00:41:39,321 --> 00:41:44,120
Perth. Um, I didn't say assholes. I said
driving like people who have el Camino's.

727
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:45,050
Um,

728
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:49,700
in Australia we have cars that we call
you and they are similar to the American

729
00:41:49,701 --> 00:41:54,590
pickup, but more like a normal sedan.
Basically. They are mostly a uni body,

730
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:58,450
like car rather than a body on
frame, like a pickup. Do you know,

731
00:41:58,451 --> 00:42:02,410
somebody tried to tell me that the pickup
was invented by a woman here and uh,

732
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:04,420
well over in Australia.

733
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:05,810
Okay.

734
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:06,800
But they used to have what the,

735
00:42:06,801 --> 00:42:10,520
what they used to have like these
vans sort of looking to hell.

736
00:42:10,521 --> 00:42:14,420
They used to call those things, uh,
God, my brain is mush this week.

737
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:18,110
Um,
what would those fucking things called?

738
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:19,460
Okay.

739
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:22,980
Begins with a p those fans from
like the 1950s but they had,

740
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:25,160
they had pickups in the 1930s I dunno,
whatever.

741
00:42:25,161 --> 00:42:28,810
It had more like a van type thing and
this woman got sick of fucking back in or

742
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:32,360
something and having to like open the
doors and throw hay in the back and she

743
00:42:32,361 --> 00:42:33,740
just cut the top off of it.

744
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:38,420
Somebody I guess from the states was
over here and saw it doesn't sound right.

745
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:41,420
Does it sound right to me?
I doesn't make any fucking sense,

746
00:42:41,421 --> 00:42:44,240
but somebody tried to claim that they
came up with them over there. Anyways,

747
00:42:44,241 --> 00:42:48,800
our division of General Motors is called
Holden and they make the commodore,

748
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:53,900
which is the current Camaro which the
current Camaro is based on and you can get

749
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:57,680
in the u s as a Chevy s s wait a minute,

750
00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:02,990
our Camaro is based on yours or your,
your shit's based on our shit. Okay.

751
00:43:02,991 --> 00:43:05,510
Don't get it twisted buddy.
We came up with the fucking car.

752
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:09,080
We invented the Goddamn
car. All right. Then we,

753
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:12,620
I have no idea who invented the
fucking car we flew first, didn't we?

754
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:15,920
Other than those French guys
who said they flew first.

755
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:19,450
How the fuck would we know
what you were doing back then?

756
00:43:19,451 --> 00:43:22,450
We'd have to take a fucking ship.
Um,

757
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:25,200
well actually the Camaro was the 60s.
I Dunno.

758
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:29,110
Actually took a picture of a couple of,
uh, some muscle cars over here. Man.

759
00:43:29,111 --> 00:43:31,900
It's cool cause they almost
look like ours, but they're not,

760
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:35,140
but they still look bad ass
and actually found a sleeper.

761
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:37,840
This fucking a mustard colored wagon.
Man,

762
00:43:37,841 --> 00:43:41,320
that thing was bad ass a algae
also try and post that photo.

763
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:45,630
Let me finish reading
this thing for Australia.

764
00:43:45,631 --> 00:43:48,750
Builds the Falcon a parenthesis.

765
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:52,660
The interceptor from Mad
Max was an Xb Falcon, uh,

766
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:54,780
which can also be bought as a u.

767
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,500
We have both these cars in
Australia for well over 30 years,

768
00:43:58,501 --> 00:44:03,030
but unfortunately they will no longer
be built here anymore after 2017.

769
00:44:03,031 --> 00:44:08,031
Also douchebags love clapped out
commodores to Hoon about in case they are

770
00:44:08,851 --> 00:44:12,540
cheap. And pretty quick, there's
some Aussie slang for you.

771
00:44:12,541 --> 00:44:17,130
I have no idea what the fuck he's talking
about. Bragging about commodores. Uh,

772
00:44:17,131 --> 00:44:18,780
I know you're a Ford Guy,

773
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:23,100
so you should really check out some of
the Aussie Bill Falcons throughout the

774
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:26,970
years. Yeah, I actually did that.
I looked up and a check them out.

775
00:44:26,971 --> 00:44:29,370
I was surprised how much longer
you guys built the Falcon.

776
00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:32,010
I actually saw a model falcon

777
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:35,100
that looked like a fucking Ford Taurus
station wagon when it was outside that

778
00:44:35,101 --> 00:44:38,370
little creatures beer place.
Um, he goes on to say,

779
00:44:38,371 --> 00:44:41,940
and also if you have some spare time you
should check out the v eight supercars.

780
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:46,260
It's like Australian, a NASCAR, but
they race on a road course. You know,

781
00:44:46,261 --> 00:44:46,711
it's funny,

782
00:44:46,711 --> 00:44:51,120
I actually mentioned the corvette one
night when I was on stage out here that I,

783
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:54,930
I love the corvette and I was thinking
about getting one and people had no idea

784
00:44:54,931 --> 00:44:58,680
what a corvette, at least the new
one, you know, they know what's,

785
00:44:58,681 --> 00:44:59,840
I guess some of the old ones aren't.

786
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:03,690
I started just sort of
looking for Corvettes when
I was in Australia and not a

787
00:45:03,691 --> 00:45:06,910
one, not a one. So, you know
what, if I lived down on that,

788
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,730
you know what I would get?
I get that new corvette,

789
00:45:08,731 --> 00:45:12,150
z o six habit fucking shipped over here.
You'd be the only one on your block,

790
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:17,090
right? And I go fuck and drive around the
scare. Some fucking Kangaroos. Alright.

791
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:18,750
Australian woman bill.

792
00:45:18,751 --> 00:45:21,240
I have a couple of friends who
studied abroad in Australia.

793
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:25,290
They all say that women
down down there are unreal.

794
00:45:25,291 --> 00:45:29,400
What are your thoughts to make it fair?
Because you with the lovely Nia, uh,

795
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:34,110
you or she can comment about the
men as well. Fucking hilarious.

796
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:38,590
Uh, no good looking people. Tall, blonde.

797
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:43,660
Um, it's weird. Their eyes, their
eyes are you, they have Ozzie eyes.

798
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:47,360
It's weird. It's somewhere
between white guys and Asian eyes.

799
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:52,300
You don't like John Denver?
That's what I would say.

800
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:57,040
Oh Shit. That's what they got. They
got John Denver eyes with blond hair,

801
00:45:57,510 --> 00:46:02,200
uh, Tan people, a really good
look and fucking, you know,

802
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:05,140
tall, blonde and 10, they get go. I mean,

803
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:08,230
I don't know what Hitler's
feelings were about Australia,

804
00:46:08,231 --> 00:46:10,690
but I think he would have loved
it. You know, if he, if he just,

805
00:46:10,930 --> 00:46:13,390
he's such a fucking moron that Hitler,
you know,

806
00:46:13,391 --> 00:46:16,600
why didn't he just fucking take his easel?
Travel abroad?

807
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:18,820
You would have been interesting.
You would have had a fucking,

808
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:21,130
you would've had an accent.

809
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:24,910
He could've come down here and got
himself some tall drink of fucking water,

810
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:26,980
painted the beautiful beaches,

811
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:31,090
could lived out in a nice
quiet fucking life. Right.

812
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:35,730
But now he had to go for the glory.
He wanted to get into show Biz Dendy,

813
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:36,940
uh,

814
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:41,350
response to army guy from last week
considering marrying girlfriend to get her

815
00:46:41,351 --> 00:46:44,770
out of the UK. All right, this is okay.

816
00:46:44,771 --> 00:46:49,030
This is this guy last week who
was talking about, uh, you know,

817
00:46:49,450 --> 00:46:51,310
he was,
he was joined the fucking,

818
00:46:51,311 --> 00:46:55,810
some branch of the US armed services
and he was stationed over in England and

819
00:46:55,811 --> 00:46:58,900
the only way he could get his beautiful,
perfect girlfriend over to meet him is,

820
00:46:58,901 --> 00:47:02,410
uh, to live over there was if he fucking
married her. So this is what this guy,

821
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:06,520
this is good. The guy's
response here. Hey, burnout. Uh,

822
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:11,530
on the one 26 podcasts, there was a guy
you called me. Oh, burn it. B. U. R. R. N.

823
00:47:11,531 --> 00:47:14,080
I think it was talking about the guy
who's going to get married, right? Hey,

824
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:17,620
burn out on the January 26 podcasts,

825
00:47:17,621 --> 00:47:20,800
there was a guy who was worried about
getting married in order to get his

826
00:47:20,801 --> 00:47:25,510
girlfriend to come to Europe with
them. My advice, get legally married,

827
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:27,250
but don't have the ceremony.

828
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:30,970
If you just need some
to show you I'm married.

829
00:47:30,971 --> 00:47:33,400
This is a great way to
avoid the added stress.

830
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:37,360
If you explain that you love her
and you want her to be with you,

831
00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:42,220
but you're not ready for marriage, she
will likely understand. Explain it.

832
00:47:42,221 --> 00:47:45,550
You still have a regular wedding later
if you decide to make the emotional

833
00:47:45,551 --> 00:47:46,720
commitment.
Also,

834
00:47:46,721 --> 00:47:51,310
the issue of getting a prenup can be
brought up to make you feel more secure

835
00:47:51,311 --> 00:47:55,090
without her thinking. It's a trust
issue. Waiting. What are you saying?

836
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:59,590
Get legally married, but don't have
the ceremony so you're already married.

837
00:47:59,591 --> 00:48:02,130
Then if you're legally married,
does he need to get the fucking prenup?

838
00:48:03,610 --> 00:48:06,880
I'll continue reading here. I was in
the reverse situation when I want,

839
00:48:06,881 --> 00:48:08,560
when I wanted to get
married to my girlfriend,

840
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:12,430
she had student loans that would get
much more expensive if she was married.

841
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:15,160
So we had the ceremony
without the legal contract.

842
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:19,870
We were contact connected
without the added cost. Um,

843
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:21,970
later when she needed health insurance,

844
00:48:21,971 --> 00:48:25,000
we went to the JP and
got her on the insurance.

845
00:48:25,450 --> 00:48:30,380
Just separate the legal marriage from
the emotional one until you're ready, uh,

846
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,520
for the commitments they entail.
Thanks to go fuck yourself. Yeah.

847
00:48:33,521 --> 00:48:37,390
But then if you're not emotionally ready
to get married and then you get married

848
00:48:37,391 --> 00:48:38,470
to somebody legally,

849
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:42,190
and then you decide later that you don't
want to be married to them, then you're,

850
00:48:42,191 --> 00:48:43,060
then you're fucked.

851
00:48:45,410 --> 00:48:48,740
And there's no way to bring up a fucking
prenup without the other person going

852
00:48:48,741 --> 00:48:53,360
like, so just exactly what he was
thinking of tapping out. Believe me.

853
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:58,280
Um, all right. Princess or just a lady.

854
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:04,330
All right. What do we got it?
Yeah. Uh, Bill, I'm a sweet guy,

855
00:49:04,390 --> 00:49:09,390
so hang on. So hang out
with this girl. What bill?

856
00:49:09,391 --> 00:49:11,580
I'm a sweet guy.
So when I hang out with this girl,

857
00:49:11,581 --> 00:49:15,060
I often tried to be nice towards her,
either with compliments or little acts.

858
00:49:15,061 --> 00:49:17,640
For example, sometimes when
we're just watching a movie,

859
00:49:17,810 --> 00:49:21,750
I'll look at her until she sees me
staring and then say, she looks beautiful.

860
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:25,650
Yeah, I'm sure that's not creepy at all.
You may be gagging right now, but hey,

861
00:49:25,651 --> 00:49:29,040
go fuck yourself. I care about
her. The problem is not that,

862
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:30,180
okay.

863
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:32,760
[inaudible] problem is not that she loves.
When I do that,

864
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:37,590
the problem is my gift giving a few times
now I've walked off campus a short way

865
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:40,410
to pick up her favorite dish
from her favorite restaurant.

866
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:43,740
The first time was because she was
busy with homework and miss dinner,

867
00:49:43,741 --> 00:49:47,730
so I wanted to surprise her and the
other was when we were going to hang out

868
00:49:47,731 --> 00:49:52,260
around lunchtime in our dorm.
I got us both something.

869
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:53,520
I got exposed to something.

870
00:49:53,521 --> 00:49:58,090
Then I've also gone to the store when
she told me one night how she wishes,

871
00:49:58,091 --> 00:50:02,220
how she wished she had this one
type of cereal. Oh Jesus, Gee,

872
00:50:02,221 --> 00:50:04,290
I wish I had this one type of cereal.

873
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:09,380
And then you go fucking running down
the street like fucking mister McFeely

874
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:12,780
speeding. Mcfeely uh, how she
needed a blah, blah, blah,

875
00:50:12,850 --> 00:50:16,080
some type of cereal and how she needed
to go to the store for milk and coffee

876
00:50:16,081 --> 00:50:19,830
creamer. While I've only spent like
$30 total honor over the past month,

877
00:50:19,831 --> 00:50:20,760
my friends wore me.

878
00:50:20,761 --> 00:50:25,050
It's either going to get excessive
or lose its special touch.

879
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:29,180
I wonder if that's true and what should
I do, Bill and have a great day. Uh,

880
00:50:29,181 --> 00:50:34,160
just kidding. Go Fuck Yourself. Ps,
she's not a manipulative bitch. Uh,

881
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:37,790
she's gotten actually upset that I
went all out of my way to get her these

882
00:50:37,791 --> 00:50:41,780
things and she told me how she feels very
grateful but kind of bad about it. Um,

883
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:43,280
all right,
well first of all,

884
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:46,050
I didn't say she would never say
that she was a bitch. I don't know.

885
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:48,200
But all women are
unbelievably manipulative.

886
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:52,040
They have to be because they can't
physically beat the fuck out of us unless

887
00:50:52,041 --> 00:50:55,790
they're like, you know,
taking that UFC shit,

888
00:50:56,390 --> 00:50:59,660
then that's just game set
and match because they could
already beat you mentally.

889
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:03,440
Women can always be a guy mentally
because they fucking work on that.

890
00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:07,520
That's all they work on. You know what
I mean? They're like a boxer, you know,

891
00:51:07,610 --> 00:51:10,250
standing up, just throwing
punches and what do you as a guy,

892
00:51:10,251 --> 00:51:12,520
you got to learn how to fight. You've
got to do all this other fucking shit.

893
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:16,070
You just become a jack of all
trades, master of none. Okay,

894
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:19,040
so they fucking do that mental
shift their entire Goddamn life.

895
00:51:19,041 --> 00:51:21,440
And then they go down to a Dojo,
like,

896
00:51:21,441 --> 00:51:25,850
can you imagine trying to fucking debate
a point with, with Ronda Rousey, how far,

897
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:28,640
how many on how many levels?
It would be fucking over as a guy.

898
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:32,960
She could beat you mentally because she's
a woman, so she's going to be fucking,

899
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,270
she's just going to weigh you down.
It's going to be over.

900
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:38,900
Or if she decides or you decided
to say something stupid tour,

901
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:42,410
she could then beat the fuck
outta here. So I mean, I dunno,

902
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:46,250
I dunno what you say that that's like
the ultimate fucking debate. I would say

903
00:51:47,870 --> 00:51:52,870
as a guy trying to be a woman in an
argument that also holds a UFC belt.

904
00:51:57,270 --> 00:51:58,103
Okay?

905
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:01,840
Oh my God.
Jesus Christ.

906
00:52:01,841 --> 00:52:05,170
How many times would you have to get
your fucking ass kicked mentally and

907
00:52:05,171 --> 00:52:08,050
physically before you
even found a weakness?

908
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:11,890
And that would just be fucking brutal.
Anyways, going back to this, uh,

909
00:52:13,810 --> 00:52:16,150
first of all, dude, I dunno
what the fuck you're doing here.

910
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:20,830
You should never hang out with
a girl that you like. All right?

911
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,780
You got to get it on some sort
of, let's, I want to take you out.

912
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:25,950
You're going to ask
this fucking woman out.

913
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:29,880
You just going to stare at it and
just say, she looks beautiful.

914
00:52:29,910 --> 00:52:32,680
Then run down the street and get her some
food that's not going to get you where

915
00:52:32,681 --> 00:52:36,250
you want to be. Okay. Um,

916
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:38,990
you've been hanging for a month.

917
00:52:39,830 --> 00:52:43,100
You're acting like her personal butler
and she hasn't said anything like she

918
00:52:43,101 --> 00:52:46,020
wants to fucking get with
you. I mean, I don't know.

919
00:52:46,021 --> 00:52:50,450
I think I feel like the window of
opportunity is closing because pretty soon

920
00:52:50,451 --> 00:52:52,460
it's going to be weird if
you fucking ask her out.

921
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:53,870
Okay.

922
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:57,910
Um, I don't want to crush your dreams
here. I didn't know what your question is.

923
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:02,490
It says princess or just a lady.
What did you say?

924
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:06,420
Uh, well I do all that. Do I think
it's going to be excessive? Yeah,

925
00:53:06,421 --> 00:53:09,120
I think you're going to be,
she's either going to use you,

926
00:53:09,121 --> 00:53:12,330
which you said she's not like that or
I think you're just going to become

927
00:53:12,331 --> 00:53:15,690
annoying or she's just going to treat
you as a friend and women don't have a

928
00:53:15,691 --> 00:53:17,760
problem looking at you
just as like a friend.

929
00:53:17,761 --> 00:53:21,540
So then when Sunday you go to ask her
out or try to kiss her or something,

930
00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:24,390
you're really going to weird her out and
the whole thing's going to get fucked

931
00:53:24,391 --> 00:53:29,340
up. So, um, I dunno, you know,

932
00:53:29,341 --> 00:53:32,130
at some point when she goes, you know, I
wish I had some cereal. It's like, well,

933
00:53:32,131 --> 00:53:33,640
you know, there's a 24
hour store down. Yeah,

934
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:37,920
the street might just give me some cocoa
puffs while you're at it. And you know,

935
00:53:37,921 --> 00:53:42,410
something is rude as that
sounds for some reason. I Dunno.

936
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:44,400
They respected on some
level that you like.

937
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:46,560
Okay.

938
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:50,130
I Dunno. But most women, they just don't
want some guy that's just like, oh my God,

939
00:53:50,131 --> 00:53:53,580
you're beautiful. Could I buy you stuff?
As much as they think they want that,

940
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,980
they just, they just look
at you like you're pathetic.

941
00:53:58,010 --> 00:54:00,470
Probably because they know on some
level that they're fucked in the head.

942
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:04,220
And the fact that you can't see it,
you don't see any flaws. They just,

943
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:08,330
they look at you like this guy's got
and you just, his judgment stinks.

944
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:10,213
This is the guy.

945
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:14,000
Then I'm going attach my fucking wagon
to somebody with no goddamn judgment who

946
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:16,610
can't read people. And like somehow
he's going to bring home the bacon,

947
00:54:17,870 --> 00:54:20,150
fry it up in the fucking pan.
I don't think he's going to do it.

948
00:54:20,510 --> 00:54:24,950
So what I would say, dude is a, yeah, I
stopped being her food bitch. All right.

949
00:54:24,951 --> 00:54:28,470
Does she wants to,
she should go get her fucking self and um,

950
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:33,370
almost think you need to back it off and
then you've got to lay it on the line.

951
00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:36,820
That's what you got to do back off.
Stop buying your shit.

952
00:54:36,821 --> 00:54:39,400
Stop fucking hanging out with, they, when
they run into would just say, listen,

953
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:44,050
what's the deal with us? Okay. Cause I
don't want to just be friends. I like you.

954
00:54:44,051 --> 00:54:46,510
I'd like to take you out and I
would like to date you. That's what,

955
00:54:46,511 --> 00:54:49,330
that's the direction I want to go home.
All right.

956
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:52,990
I don't want to fucking hang out with
you and go buy your smores even though

957
00:54:52,991 --> 00:54:55,450
that's what the fuck I was doing.
That's the old me. This is the new me.

958
00:54:55,510 --> 00:54:59,230
You see me right now. Look at me. Grabbed
my Dick Right now. Okay. Cause it's mine.

959
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:04,300
Would you care for some, you know, just
something like that. Sorry. All right.

960
00:55:04,330 --> 00:55:05,830
Dollar Shave Club.
Everybody.

961
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:10,300
Can someone please tell me when
razors got so goddamn expensive. Huh?

962
00:55:11,110 --> 00:55:13,780
What is the deal people have?
I been asleep for 20 years.

963
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:18,010
I was in the store the other day and one
pack of razors costs 20 bucks, one pack.

964
00:55:18,310 --> 00:55:22,220
That is insane, but hey, sometimes when
you buy those razors, you also get a free,

965
00:55:22,270 --> 00:55:26,230
you also get a free gift,
which is actually a punched in the Dick.

966
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:29,320
All right? Don't get beat up
with ridiculous razor prices.

967
00:55:29,321 --> 00:55:30,850
Get your shape gear where I get mine.

a right to my doorstep. They're
planning starts at just $3 a month.

972
00:55:47,290 --> 00:55:49,970
Here's how it works.
They sent me,

973
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:53,780
they sent me the handle for free and every
month they sent me replacement blades.

974
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:55,610

They've got lots of grooming supplies too.
You know that.

977
00:56:01,851 --> 00:56:04,850
I love the one wipe Charlies.
I've never used them.

978
00:56:04,851 --> 00:56:08,300
I just think it's fucking
hilarious and I love, you know,

979
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:12,770
I always said I love the shit
talking of one wipe Charlies. Really?

980
00:56:13,730 --> 00:56:16,910
I got to try some of those.
Just fuck it off.

981
00:56:18,590 --> 00:56:21,440
That's disgusting that you guys had said
to envision me trying some of those,

982
00:56:21,470 --> 00:56:22,430
like taking a test,

983
00:56:22,431 --> 00:56:27,220

and then just go one, one white, right.

984
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:29,630
God dammit they did it.
Uh,

985
00:56:29,650 --> 00:56:33,340
why pay $20 for a razor when you can
get a fantastic shape from dollar shave

986
00:56:33,341 --> 00:56:37,300
club.com for a fraction of the price
stock getting smacked around by rate,

987
00:56:37,301 --> 00:56:39,520
high razor prices,

what do we got left here?
I think I ran out.

1037
00:59:42,091 --> 00:59:45,690
I had got damn and I read all the fucking
questions for the week, right at 59.

1038
00:59:45,691 --> 00:59:48,270
Look at that. Um, once again,

1039
00:59:48,271 --> 00:59:52,140
congratulations to the New England
patriots sets the podcast for this week.

1040
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:55,320
Uh, you know, beyond being a fan,

1041
00:59:55,321 --> 01:00:00,321
I'm really happy for a Tom Brady and
bill Belichick a grant to get his first

1042
01:00:01,591 --> 01:00:05,580
one, the defense and all those guys
to get their fucking rings. It's just,

1043
01:00:05,670 --> 01:00:09,750
it's just awesome. And uh, you know, whose
kidney with Tom last, this fucking one.

1044
01:00:11,010 --> 01:00:14,010
Then you'd be three and three and all
the fucking jerk offs would be seen a

1045
01:00:14,011 --> 01:00:16,680
bunch of shit about them.
And to be honest,

1046
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:19,080
this is six Superbowls in a row.

1047
01:00:19,081 --> 01:00:23,040
This guy drove from behind for
the winning fucking touchdown.

1048
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:26,040
It ain't his fault. Well
actually, no, I can't say that.

1049
01:00:26,041 --> 01:00:27,990
The last one that's wrote a Welker,
I dunno.

1050
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:32,520
I don't know who to blame on that
one. But, um, five out of six,

1051
01:00:32,521 --> 01:00:34,320
this guy is always doing the fucking deed.

1052
01:00:34,321 --> 01:00:38,940
So it's so psyched that the
defense finally stepped up
and I don't even know the

1053
01:00:38,941 --> 01:00:41,790
name of the guy that picked off the ball.
I never even fucking heard of them.

1054
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:45,300
I read his name. I had
no idea. So, uh, anyways,

1055
01:00:45,301 --> 01:00:49,080
my apology to the sports fans that listen
to this fucking podcast because, uh,

1056
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:53,310
I did not see the God damn game. I can't
fucking believe it. Um, but anyways,

1057
01:00:53,311 --> 01:00:56,710
I'm looking forward to my time
down here in New Zealand, um,

1058
01:00:56,800 --> 01:01:01,800
work in Auckland tomorrow night and
I'm working a Wellington and then I go,

1059
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:05,370
then I go to fucking Southeast Asia.
Man,

1060
01:01:05,371 --> 01:01:07,590
can you fucking believe that
I'm going to be going to Asia?

1061
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:13,160
And I already had an an amazing interview
as far as like just talking to this

1062
01:01:14,371 --> 01:01:17,340
guy from Hong Kong and uh,

1063
01:01:17,341 --> 01:01:21,840
I'm really looking forward to meeting
comics in Singapore or Hong Kong and India

1064
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:24,720
just to hear their,
you know,

1065
01:01:24,750 --> 01:01:27,210
cause the scenes is so new over
there and that type of stuff,

1066
01:01:27,211 --> 01:01:31,560
it's fucking ridiculous. You know, I
did a podcast this week out of India.

1067
01:01:31,561 --> 01:01:34,350
These guys, two guys called me
up, right. Fucking hilarious.

1068
01:01:34,351 --> 01:01:39,000
Guiding India is going to be fucking
hilarious because Indian people seem like

1069
01:01:39,001 --> 01:01:43,710
my favorite kind of comic where my
nothing I like better than somebody who's

1070
01:01:43,711 --> 01:01:45,780
really smart,
but they're fucking silly.

1071
01:01:46,470 --> 01:01:50,580
And these guys in this podcast for like
that as they tried to trick me to get in

1072
01:01:50,610 --> 01:01:53,480
talking about the fucking government,
um,

1073
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:57,400
when they didn't have the fucking
balls to or whatever, they,

1074
01:01:57,450 --> 01:01:59,910
they weren't going to do what they tried
to get me in trouble over there. Man.

1075
01:01:59,911 --> 01:02:01,710
It's fucking hilarious.
When I called him out on it,

1076
01:02:01,711 --> 01:02:03,750
they fucking laugh their asses off.
It was like,

1077
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:09,060
it was like talking to fucking rich
vos is some shit from over there.

1078
01:02:09,061 --> 01:02:13,060
Men that same kind of ball buster. And so
I'm just really looking forward to, uh,

1079
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:18,110
to that I think it's going to be life
changing. And, uh, and then once again,

1080
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:22,670
when I, after I'm done with
this, this whirlwind tour here,

1081
01:02:22,730 --> 01:02:27,560
I flied from India over
to Dubai connecting Dubai
and then I go to New York.

1082
01:02:27,561 --> 01:02:29,840
So I will literally have
flown around the world,

1083
01:02:30,530 --> 01:02:35,270
which is an unbelievable
privilege to be able to do that.

1084
01:02:35,271 --> 01:02:39,500
So I really want to take the time to
thank everybody who sent me emails telling

1085
01:02:39,501 --> 01:02:43,340
me to come over to these places
because it's definitely a life changing

1086
01:02:43,341 --> 01:02:46,100
experience. And, um, you know,

1087
01:02:46,101 --> 01:02:49,880
I ran into a bunch of Indian comics at
the laugh factory maybe like four years

1088
01:02:49,881 --> 01:02:52,310
ago or something, three years ago.
I can't even tell at this point.

1089
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:55,430
And they actually, you know, knew what my,

1090
01:02:55,460 --> 01:02:58,310
knew my stuff and said that there was
people over there that would come see the

1091
01:02:58,311 --> 01:02:59,630
show.
And that's all I need to say.

1092
01:02:59,631 --> 01:03:04,070
And I'll fucking figure out a way to
get over there. And, uh, I actually,

1093
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:09,350
when I did that podcast, like
they were talking about, you know,

1094
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:13,760
they asked me about the Philly
thing when I got booed, I was like,

1095
01:03:13,761 --> 01:03:17,180
you fucking guys saw that
over there. They're like,
yeah, you know, we do comedy.

1096
01:03:17,181 --> 01:03:21,140
You know, we fucking watch this
shit. So it's a pretty humbling that.

1097
01:03:21,170 --> 01:03:24,260
So I'm looking forward to it,
going to get some dumplings in Hong Kong.

1098
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:26,940
I want to get some fucking,
you know, it's funny, I,

1099
01:03:26,941 --> 01:03:30,530
I'm going to ask the people in
India where should I go eat?

1100
01:03:30,531 --> 01:03:33,290
And I was just thinking they're
probably sick of Indian food. You know,

1101
01:03:33,291 --> 01:03:36,050
they're probably going to take me to
a Sushi joint or something like that.

1102
01:03:36,051 --> 01:03:37,670
Cause you know,

1103
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,910
I want to go over there and get some
fucking the best Indian food I ever had.

1104
01:03:40,910 --> 01:03:42,920
So hopefully that's where
they're going to take me. But uh,

1105
01:03:43,790 --> 01:03:45,470
I'm really looking forward to it.
You know,

1106
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:49,880
a lot more shows to do a lot more whiskey
to drink and I'll do, do you know,

1107
01:03:49,881 --> 01:03:52,340
they don't fucking have any
cigar bars in Australia.

1108
01:03:53,510 --> 01:03:57,320
That's what this fucking guy told me.
And when you go to buy the Cuban cigars,

1109
01:03:57,321 --> 01:04:00,980
I made a video. I got to show you this,
like how fucking hardcore they are.

1110
01:04:01,850 --> 01:04:05,380
I bought a Cuban cigar and you had to
sit outside like a fucking animal smoking

1111
01:04:05,390 --> 01:04:06,260
this thing outside.

1112
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:10,790
Like I smoked a cigar the way Paul
Versey smokes a cigar standing out in the

1113
01:04:10,791 --> 01:04:12,320
street next to a trashcan.

1114
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:20,590
Uh, anyways, I don't know
what to tell you. Uh,

1115
01:04:20,620 --> 01:04:24,040
thanks for listening to
the podcast. That's it.
Congratulations to the Patriots,

1116
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:27,700
ed. Seriously, I'm not joking. Condolences
to the Seattle Seahawks fans. I know.

1117
01:04:27,701 --> 01:04:32,280
What the fuck that feels like to have
a crushing goddamn defeat. But uh,

1118
01:04:32,290 --> 01:04:33,700
you'll be back next year.
You know,

1119

you're gonna fucking great
team and fucking organization
and I don't give a fuck

1120
01:04:37,630 --> 01:04:40,690
