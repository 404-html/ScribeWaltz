1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:01,660
Yeah.

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:05,950
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's
the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,420

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:14,770
2014 Cinco de Mayo,
everybody happy.

5
00:00:14,771 --> 00:00:19,750
Cinco de Mayo to all a Mexican listeners
and a white people and everybody else

6
00:00:19,751 --> 00:00:23,500
who just wants to go out and get shit
faced tonight. Uh, for whatever reason.

7
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:28,150
So you haven't excuse tomorrow when
you drag an ash. Yeah, no real sure.

8
00:00:28,151 --> 00:00:32,680
A that up to your level of productivity
that we're used to here at Cogswell

9
00:00:32,681 --> 00:00:37,030
cubs. And he'd be like, well, fuck you.
I went out and I celebrate last night.

10
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:41,590
What's the matter?
You don't like Mexicans there you go off.

11
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:45,580
One of the few times a white person can
use the race card. Just slam that fucker.

12
00:00:45,581 --> 00:00:49,930
Write down, are you against Mexico? Well,

13
00:00:49,931 --> 00:00:54,931
how right then kindly remove
yourself from my cubicle area.

14
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,800
All right.
I got drunk last night for America.

15
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:08,720
Um, oh, here's one for your last night.
I was hanging out with Jason Law had,

16
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,360
you know, obviously race has
been a huge fucking split,

17
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:16,790
a huge topic of interest over
the last couple of days. Um,

18
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:20,500
I was over a Jason Law heads, uh, place.

19
00:01:20,501 --> 00:01:23,710
He's got this apartment bill has
got a really cool rooftop and uh,

20
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,030
and I get to Cla,

21
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,560
get to see the helicopters fucking
with their spotlights down on some poor

22
00:01:29,561 --> 00:01:30,820
bastard trying to run away.

23
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:35,290
I don't know how I feel about police
helicopters out here or just in general.

24
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,510
I mean,
I'm all for catching the bad guys,

25
00:01:37,511 --> 00:01:39,220
but it does kind of get to
the point of like, you know,

26
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:43,670
how much fucking help do you need here?
You guys already have your,

27
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:47,650
you guys are all on the same
team. You'll have uniforms. Okay.

28
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:52,000
It's like 900 cop cars to one cop
car. You're all on the radio. Hey,

29
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:54,520
just made a right on fucking sunset.

30
00:01:56,230 --> 00:02:00,880
You need a helicopter to lighten
the guy up. Jesus Christ.

31
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,270
How long would Bonnie and Clyde last

32
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,430
in this day and age,
you couldn't fucking get away with,

33
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,690
what am I defending right now?
Homicidal maniacs, I guess I am.

34
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,540
There's just something about like,
you know,

35
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,090
so like when you watch a
cowboy and Indian movie,

36
00:02:19,091 --> 00:02:21,220
you've got to root for the underdog.
You Go, you go for the Indians.

37
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:25,060
I guess the native Americans is that
when they call them now, am I in trouble?

38
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,670
Do I have to apologize?
Um,

39
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:29,240
yeah,

40
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,600
yeah. He always root for the
fucking underdogs. So I look at it,

41
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:38,240
I ain't, what the fuck I'm saying? So when
he was, so we're up on this roof and um,

42
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,870
as we walk up on the roof, there's
already some people partying up there. Um,

43
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:46,040
and they're celebrating Cinco de Mayo,
mostly Mexican people.

44
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:49,160
I think up there playing the music and all
that shit, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

45
00:02:49,161 --> 00:02:52,730
Everything's fine. So me and lie
ahead and a bunch of white guys,

46
00:02:52,731 --> 00:02:56,060
we go up there and then we sit down on
these other chairs and we start smoking

47
00:02:56,061 --> 00:02:56,894
cigars.

48
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:01,120
And then all of a sudden one of
the dude's comes walking over.

49
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,620
He'd been drinking and they
had like, you know, these,

50
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:08,170
these potted plant bushes and the dude's
walking over to an area where there is

51
00:03:08,171 --> 00:03:12,460
no exit. And then he walks
behind the bushes and we're like,

52
00:03:12,461 --> 00:03:17,290
is he going to Piss over there? So one of
the guys that were with goes, he's like,

53
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:20,380
Yo, Yo dude, that's not a bathroom
man, that's not a bathroom.

54
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,230
And the guy stayed down
there for a minute.

55
00:03:23,231 --> 00:03:27,040
So then we go back to talk and in our
cigars and then I hear him talking to his

56
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:31,150
friends and you'll bro,
that's not a bathroom.

57
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,240
And then I hear, oh, we got your
back, we got your back. Right.

58
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:40,550
I'm sitting there going, Oh God,
here we go and here we go. And a,

59
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:43,480
so then I'm thinking like
maybe he wasn't pissing.

60
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:47,440
So that's why he's mad.
And then he's looking at us going like,

61
00:03:47,441 --> 00:03:51,370
all those white guys already didn't like,
it's up here with our music.

62
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:54,430
And now we assumed just because
I walk behind these bushes,

63
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:59,200
then I was taking a fucking pissed and
maybe I was just looking down over the

64
00:03:59,201 --> 00:04:01,570
side of the building to see if
my friend was showing up. Right.

65
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:05,110
So that's what I'm thinking is playing
out in my head. So long story short,

66
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:10,420
he's fucking, you know, a couple of
mean muggin looks over our way. And, uh,

67
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:16,690
so I'm already thinking in my head how
to verbally talk the whole situation

68
00:04:16,691 --> 00:04:20,800
down. Basically doing the exact opposite
of what a bouncer does. You know,

69
00:04:20,801 --> 00:04:23,740
where they, their security, but
they always escalate the situation.

70
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:27,330
Remember that story told a while back or
I saw two guys almost got into a fight

71
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:30,200
in the bounces, fucking break
them up and okay, hey, hey,

72
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,920
you know what's going on here?
And this guy goes, well this guy,

73
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:36,070
and he kind of put his hand on the box
of shoulder and the bouncer goes, okay,

74
00:04:36,071 --> 00:04:37,480
first of all,
don't touch me.

75
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:42,090
And immediately fucking escalated it
now rather than he was coming over to,

76
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:45,280
to diffuse it, he was escalating it. So I
was sitting there going like, all right,

77
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:46,721
out of fuck,

78
00:04:46,721 --> 00:04:51,190
am I going to fucking conveyed to them
honest mistake if to stu wasn't pissing,

79
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:53,560
you know, I mean, what the fuck are
we supposed to think? You're drinking,

80
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:58,510
you stumbling over, you walk behind
bushes on the roof, you know,

81
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:03,190
to me that is classic.
I'm drunk and I'm going to Piss

82
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:09,520
the first place I can find, you know,
no cover. I mean cover I should say,

83
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:13,840
nobody could see me is what I should
say. So, um, long story short,

84
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,810
uh, this black dude comes over who's
gay? This is like a fucking reality show.

85
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,183
You know,

86
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:25,270
where they get what all we need is an
Asian guy and somebody with a sassy

87
00:05:25,271 --> 00:05:29,140
attitude. And I think I have
a hit show here, you know? Um,

88
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:34,250
so he comes over and
he's like, yeah, sorry.

89
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:37,180
I don't even know he's gay,
but he has like the gay accent,

90
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:40,990
which I guess is homophobic to say,
but he had an a feminine accent.

91
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,700
I assumed he was gay. Not saying
he can't get married in someday.

92
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:48,670
Get divorced and lose half his shit.
He has the right to do that.

93
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:53,020
He has a right to do everything
straight people do. Even the dumb shit.

94
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,180
All right,
did I cover my tracks?

95
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,360
So he comes over and he goes,
hey man,

96
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,740
sorry about the blah blah.

97
00:06:00,741 --> 00:06:04,100
He goes into a policy mode and I go
immediately into apology mode. I just say,

98
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:08,630
hey man, honest mistake. We thought he
was a taking a piss. I didn't know, blah,

99
00:06:08,631 --> 00:06:11,690
blah, blah, blah, blah. And
then in the end when he walks
away, my other buddy goes,

100
00:06:11,691 --> 00:06:15,020
no, I could hear him piston. So I
don't know what the fuck happened.

101
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:20,200
So then I guess the roof is
really fucking thin and you know,

102
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:22,160
they're playing music,
dancing and shit.

103
00:06:22,161 --> 00:06:26,240
And then like the owner came up and then
a little bit later this security person

104
00:06:26,241 --> 00:06:30,020
came up and I'm thinking the
whole fucking time these guys,

105
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:34,880
these Mexican dudes think that we called
those people that these white guys

106
00:06:34,881 --> 00:06:37,640
showed up. Like, oh, what are
they doing up on our roof?

107
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:43,130
And that was completely not the case.
And I was sitting there and of course,

108
00:06:43,131 --> 00:06:44,840
because I'm a Hollywood phony,

109
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:48,800
rather than actually giving
into the tension of it, I
was actually thinking like,

110
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,540
hey, this would be a really
good scene in a script.

111
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:58,980
Just a complete misunderstanding.
And uh,

112
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:03,270
I thought, I still think it's a comedy.
I don't think it's more like crash.

113
00:07:03,271 --> 00:07:06,870
I think it's a comedy because they were
all young and in shape and we were a

114
00:07:06,871 --> 00:07:10,050
bunch of old white guys smoking cigars.
So that would be a funny fight.

115
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,180
There would definitely be like,

116
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:16,350
you know the dual headlock shit going
on with the shirt coming up in the ass

117
00:07:16,351 --> 00:07:20,160
crack coming out. You know what a real
fight looks like. It's never pretty,

118
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:25,130
you know, by the way, who all, who
saw the Mayweather fight? Anybody? Um,

119
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,720
I actually didn't see it. I heard it
was a, it was actually a good fight.

120
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,570
I just have so much faith in May,
whether as a,

121
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:35,870
as a fighter that I don't order his
fights because he just wins every fucking

122
00:07:36,781 --> 00:07:40,830
time and, but he never knocks him out.
So I just watch him pepper in the guy,

123
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,780
you know, kind of dances around
the first couple of rounds. That,

124
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:47,250
is that what you're doing? Hey,
you can try and do that. Okay.

125
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,860
Did that pimp up a peep?

126
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,880
Ah, fuck it. Trey magic out again.

127
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,630
Fucking old guy starts yelling.

128
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:02,150
I don't know.

129
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:06,120
He made it more polo shirt. Your new
book gave a pip. I Dunno, I think.

130
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,300
Do you think he's going to get out
and he's got three more fights.

131
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:13,070
He's three more of, I'm actually
worried about me, whether I can't tell.

132
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,930
I know he's a smart guy,

133
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:19,820
but I can't tell if he understands
money or if that's all just to show,

134
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,793
you know what I mean?

135
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:27,640
Anytime you see a guy in a
field where age is a factor,

136
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:32,330
like by the time you hit
40 and they have like,

137
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:37,710
like fucking an airport
hangar of all white cars,

138
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:42,260
you know what I mean? You
just start saying that. Or
like once you buy the tiger,

139
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:47,260
what's some other dumb shit? You have
your own water park in your backyard.

140
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,860
I mean,
you just can't sustain that.

141
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,460
You literally start living
a lifestyle where it's like,

142
00:08:52,461 --> 00:08:57,461
the only way I can afford this is this
for is if I'm champion of the boxing

143
00:08:58,021 --> 00:09:00,060
world,
you know,

144
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:03,960
eventually you're going to be 50
and unless you Bernard Hopkins,

145
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:04,920
I mean you're not,

146
00:09:04,921 --> 00:09:09,240
you're not going to be the champ anymore
and now you got a tiger next to a water

147
00:09:09,241 --> 00:09:14,170
park next to fucking nine white
Bentley's and I don't know. I don't know.

148
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,920
You gotta get like that.
You got to get the,

149
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,150
you got to get the outside the
business money. You know what I mean?

150
00:09:20,151 --> 00:09:21,980
I'm literally drawing a
half a circle right now.

151
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,750
As I'm saying outside the business money.

152
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,550
I'm trying to think of
a good example of it.

153
00:09:25,551 --> 00:09:28,730
I would say 50 cent with this
fucking vitamin water. Brilliant.

154
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,210
Yeah,

155
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:35,040
that's fucking brilliant.
That's like a fucking hooker with who,

156
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:40,180
who fucking take so hookah money and then
fucking buys an apartment building so

157
00:09:41,671 --> 00:09:45,230
you can get underneath out from underneath
your pimp because that's really kind

158
00:09:45,231 --> 00:09:47,640
of what show businesses.
It's funny you come into this business,

159
00:09:47,641 --> 00:09:52,440
you think you're the pimp, and then about,
I don't know, for me about 15 years in,

160
00:09:52,441 --> 00:09:54,450
you're like, oh, wait a minute,
I'm the guy walking the block.

161
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:03,720
I need to somehow try and
make money outside of this
business because I can only

162
00:10:03,721 --> 00:10:07,920
shake my ass for so long before another
young red heads going to be coming along

163
00:10:07,921 --> 00:10:11,940
and then I'm finished. Right? So I
need, I need to go buy a whorehouse,

164
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,820
which is a fucking comedy club.
I don't know what I need to do,

165
00:10:14,821 --> 00:10:18,540
but I got to start making money outside
of this business because I'll be fucked

166
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:23,690
if I'm going to be some old bald guy in
a fucking wrinkled Tuxedo on a cruise

167
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,250
cruise ship, you know,
I'll be sold at that point.

168
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,590
Not only will I be telling jokes,
I will,

169
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:33,530
I'll do be also kind of singing classic
songs from the American Song Book.

170
00:10:33,531 --> 00:10:36,870
You know, you know what's
up with the president? Yeah.

171
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:40,890
We got to get back up budget. I think
you need to go back to fucking Arkansas.

172
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,950
People laugh and then I'd
be like, ah, here we go.

173
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:48,960
A Samoan but up k blow it in from across
the sea and I do a big thing like,

174
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,330
like,
like you know,

175
00:10:54,331 --> 00:10:58,740
I got a fucking one of those check whores
on fucking prices, right? Oh, new car.

176
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,240
They do that little swing with their hand.

177
00:11:00,241 --> 00:11:01,950
Like as if he can't see the fucking car.

178
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:06,780
That's what I would be doing a
cross the sea, you know, just like,

179
00:11:06,781 --> 00:11:09,510
there it is.
We're out on a boat.

180
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,820
You are a fat fuck.

181
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:13,480
Okay.

182
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,950
You know, fucking dance with
me. We'll go to the casino.

183
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,690
You don't really like about cruise ships?

184
00:11:19,691 --> 00:11:23,230
I don't like how they decide
when you fucking eat. You know,

185
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:26,650
like all of a sudden I
joined this guy's navy.

186
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:31,280
I did one cruise ship and that's
the thing that I hated the most.

187
00:11:31,281 --> 00:11:34,160
Aside from the fact that you couldn't
get away from the crowd there. You good?

188
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:38,750
Sheller says ILS that, hey, just want to
tell you that. Take it to the fire house.

189
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:44,120
Fuck off. It's over. Hey,

190
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:46,580
I liked your shorts yesterday.
Those shorts, your war.

191
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:51,140
How would you like to hear that? I'll
fucking day. It's not their fault. I do.

192
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,640
You come up with your material.

193
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:56,560
I actually thought about jumping
overboard like half the fucking time,

194
00:11:56,561 --> 00:11:57,910
and I am terrified of the ocean,

195
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:01,360
but I thought the water would be cold
enough that hypothermia would get me

196
00:12:01,361 --> 00:12:03,070
before I get eaten by a fucking shark.

197
00:12:03,071 --> 00:12:07,600
And even then by then I'd be so fucking
numb. You know? Maybe it wouldn't hurt.

198
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,080
Okay.

199
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,420
I don't know. What am I,
what was I talking about?
Oh, we're talking about race.

200
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,510
We're talking about racial issues.
Um,

201
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:19,880
so this week I'm going to try to remember
what the fuck happened. Oh, okay.

202
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:24,770
The first one that happened
literally happened the day
I put up the podcast. And,

203
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:28,700
um, you know, it's a fucking
pet peeve of mine is on Twitter.

204
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:29,910
Okay.

205
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:34,220
All right. When some con we'll
fucking send me a tweet. Male.

206
00:12:34,221 --> 00:12:38,640
A female client. Okay. Equal,
equal look up, Tony. Um,

207
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,630
we'll say like, uh, hey bill,

208
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,770
did you see this thing about
Donald Sterling and the clippers?

209
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:48,080
And then they just write thoughts?

210
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,060
Yeah.

211
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,700
Like I'm just supposed to just
start fucking, oh, well shit.

212
00:12:52,701 --> 00:12:56,210
Let me just take time out
of my fucking day, you know?

213
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,580
Hey, talk about, uh, this fucking thing
and then when you fucking talk about it,

214
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,670
I talked to you once a week on Monday.

215
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:06,983
Okay.

216
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,210
Fucking Twitter crunch. Drive
me nuts. Thoughts, thoughts.

217
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:18,640
Anyways, sorry, I'm really being a car
today, but I, I just, uh, I can't help it.

218
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,250
It's who I am. So anyways, yeah.
Uh, I love that. What, what,

219
00:13:22,251 --> 00:13:25,180
what could your thought fucking
possibly be other than like, yeah,

220
00:13:25,181 --> 00:13:26,050
that was horrific.

221
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:27,150
Yeah,

222
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:29,410
it'd beat. I'm like a lady. It's
not like I don't have a bit on it,

223
00:13:29,411 --> 00:13:33,160
but I'm not going to do it on the podcast.
But a, I can't tell you this though.

224
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:36,550
I didn't understand what Mark Cuban was
talking about where they were saying,

225
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,620
well,
he gave these slippery slope.

226
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:40,190
Okay.

227
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,630
The slippery slope thing there.

228
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:46,130
There's always somebody like
whenever you like a, you know, hey,

229
00:13:46,131 --> 00:13:49,760
this guy says he loves Hitler,
we got to get rid of them.

230
00:13:49,761 --> 00:13:53,480
And then there's always that. Well, you
know, that's a slippery slope. You know,

231
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:58,730
you start with this guy, you know,
where do you draw the line? How about,

232
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:02,300
you know, you draw the line at a
racist with fucked up mustaches.

233
00:14:02,301 --> 00:14:06,230
How about we draw?
It's pretty clear and present line.

234
00:14:06,231 --> 00:14:09,420
Like I don't understand
where the slippery slope.

235
00:14:09,421 --> 00:14:14,420
It's like if you're going to fire an
owner for being overtly racist, what next?

236
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:15,800
You don't like my shirt?

237
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:24,380
Ah, fuck. I mean I don't, I
actually, in defense of him,

238
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,720
I read the [inaudible]. Yeah, this isn't
the fence. They might just Google it.

239
00:14:29,721 --> 00:14:34,290
And then I looked it up and I saw
these sense kind of retracted it. Um,

240
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:38,660
and all I have here is that the outspoken
billionaire said it was a slippery

241
00:14:38,661 --> 00:14:42,710
slope to suggest that sterling should be
forced out as owner over comments made

242
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:46,580
in the privacy of his
home. Um, yeah, I mean,

243
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,940
well that's taken out of
context, but I, I don't know. He,

244
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:53,210
he said what said was wrong.
It was abhorrent.

245
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,900
I don't even know what that word means.
Must be bad cause whores in their hip.

246
00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:00,740
Horan uh,
there's no place for racism in the NBA,

247
00:15:00,741 --> 00:15:03,350
any business I'm associated with.
But at the same time,

248
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:05,630
that's a decision that I make.

249
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,030
I guess he's saying I make
a decision not to be racist.

250
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:09,590
I think you've got to be very,

251
00:15:09,591 --> 00:15:13,280
very careful when you start making blanket
statements about what people say and

252
00:15:13,281 --> 00:15:17,840
think as opposed to what they do.
It's a very,

253
00:15:17,841 --> 00:15:20,910
very slippery slope. So what, what
is he saying there? I don't get it.

254
00:15:20,911 --> 00:15:24,230
And is he saying that all right,
this guy says racist shit.

255
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,113
MMM.

256
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:33,640
In his personal life. But during
the day, his business is made,

257
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,880
he has 11 employees on his players,
on his team,

258
00:15:36,881 --> 00:15:41,290
and 10 of them are African American.
So despite what he says on the fall,

259
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:48,730
if everybody hired the way this guy did,
I mean that's a higher than 90%

260
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,500
okay.

261
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,920
African met shit.
White people will be out of jobs.

262
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,830
I don't know what he's saying there.

263
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,460
I don't understand where the
slippery slope is, but um,

264
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,840
I dunno. Well, I mean, what,

265
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,530
what are you going to do with the
guy said when he fucking said,

266
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:10,300
and I understand that it was a private
conversation, but he was dumb enough

267
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:16,200
to do it over the phone. He,
he's just by dumb enough.

268
00:16:16,201 --> 00:16:19,350
I'm not saying that you, he should have
just said it without being on the phone.

269
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:22,770
I'm, I know what he said
was wrong. But the thing is,

270
00:16:22,771 --> 00:16:26,880
is every fucking move he made
is his own fucking fault.

271
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,230
That's his own fault.

272
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:32,190
Does his own fucking fault that you
would say something like that over the

273
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:33,240
fucking phone

274
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:40,490
to a woman who's acting like she's into
you, who's 50 years younger than you?

275
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:45,180
You're a fucking moron. It was
unbelievably reckless. And uh,

276
00:16:45,181 --> 00:16:48,810
I'm glad he did it because a,

277
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:54,390
I dunno, it's just fucked up. It's
just fucking, you know, I don't, I,

278
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,160
I would,
I would understand that guy.

279
00:16:56,161 --> 00:17:00,420
If that guy lived in the middle of
fucking nowhere and he lived around all

280
00:17:00,421 --> 00:17:04,230
fucking white people and he was 80 years
old. I mean, that's a layup. I mean,

281
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:07,450
shit he does. Yeah. That's obviously
how he's got a fucking thing.

282
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:10,730
This guy was born in 1930 something,
you know,

283
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:14,070
and he was raised by people who were
born in like the turn of the fucking

284
00:17:14,071 --> 00:17:18,630
century and had Harry Truman for a
president who was one of the most biggest

285
00:17:18,631 --> 00:17:22,530
fucking racist sever. Right? Was that
his first fucking name? I don't know.

286
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,113
MMM.

287
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:28,220
So anyways, I mean, yeah.
What the fuck you think he's
going to be thought? I mean,

288
00:17:28,221 --> 00:17:31,280
this guy, he got raised by racist and
then, and then he didn't fucking travel,

289
00:17:31,281 --> 00:17:32,720
but this guy actually traveled.

290
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:34,843
Okay.

291
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,730
That's, that's the one that
I don't get. I don't get,

292
00:17:37,731 --> 00:17:41,690
when you finally have interaction and
you actually have examples and it's a

293
00:17:41,691 --> 00:17:46,670
specific person that you now know
that you can still think that way. Um,

294
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:48,290
and then the,

295
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:51,990
the fucking phone messages hilarious
because he's literally talking to somebody

296
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,160
who's half of,

297
00:17:53,161 --> 00:17:58,161
what will she have a black half Latino
and he's literally trashing black people

298
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:03,950
tour. And as she's getting offended,
he's sitting there going like, oh,

299
00:18:03,951 --> 00:18:07,640
you're mean, oh, don't you
understand how your words hurt

300
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,593
me

301
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,300
and is fucking awful as it was.

302
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,450
I would love to have that
level of money that you're,

303
00:18:18,451 --> 00:18:23,451
that fucking just so wrapped
up in yourself that you
don't even realize you're

304
00:18:23,551 --> 00:18:27,180
hurting people in your, actually you're,
you're playing the victim yourself.

305
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:31,920
I Dunno. So now it's actually, I don't
think he's going to try and sell the team,

306
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:35,580
which is going to be fascinating
as they try and force this guy out.

307
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:40,410
But I think they should be able to do
it because he's fucking with the whole

308
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:41,580
image of the league.

309
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,120
Okay.

310
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,360
You know, I dunno, one of it, one
of his shit like this comes out.

311
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,630
It always bugs me because then everybody
gets to act like holier than now

312
00:18:49,631 --> 00:18:53,530
because they didn't get caught
saying anything fucked up.

313
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:57,280
You know what I mean? I don't know.
I think people say fucked up shit.

314
00:18:57,281 --> 00:18:58,870
I think everybody says fucked up shit.

315
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:02,110
And I think people think fucked up shit
and they're just smart enough to not say

316
00:19:02,111 --> 00:19:04,810
it out loud. And I don't even
think that it makes you a racist.

317
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:09,040
You just think you just see it.
You can't hit fucking help it.

318
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,310
Okay.

319
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:14,150
You just fucking, your
approach, how you grew up,

320
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:17,390
you proud of experience in every,
you know it is. Everybody has fear.

321
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:23,260
So fear will drive you into thinking
the worst of somebody if you're in a

322
00:19:23,661 --> 00:19:25,970
fearful situation.
Like I used to do a bit in my act,

323
00:19:25,971 --> 00:19:30,770
how everybody's racist at night and
almost like you have to be so you can get

324
00:19:30,771 --> 00:19:32,810
home.
You have to think the worst of people.

325
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,540
So you're not that fucking idiot that
just walks into a wood chipper. Well yeah,

326
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,660
I'll help you start it,

327
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:43,390
go over there and get knocked
over the head and thrown in it.

328
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:45,880
And then that's the worst. Then the
next day everybody's like, yeah,

329
00:19:45,881 --> 00:19:49,480
it's awful that it happened. But Jesus,
I think, well, what was this guy begging?

330
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:54,450
So, um, I don't know, but I've got
to commend all the clipper players.

331
00:19:54,451 --> 00:19:57,550
We're actually still going
out and playing because, uh,

332
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,600
I don't know that I would have,

333
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:00,503
you know,

334
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:04,100
I mean, you've got to feel like
he just got to feel like, yeah,

335
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,790
I've worked for some club owners that
have been absolute dicks and I still had a

336
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:13,791
couple up a fucking shows left and I
wanted to like burn down the club and then

337
00:20:13,831 --> 00:20:16,050
choke the guy to death and
throw them on the fucking ashes.

338
00:20:16,051 --> 00:20:19,370
Like I've felt that and still had to
trudge through the show and there was no,

339
00:20:19,371 --> 00:20:21,120
no racism involved.

340
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:25,020
There wasn't this negative thing that
affected my life every fucking day.

341
00:20:25,021 --> 00:20:27,000
And then this guy
actually persona fight it.

342
00:20:27,001 --> 00:20:31,800
It was just a guy being a dick and I
still had to go up there and entertain his

343
00:20:31,801 --> 00:20:32,310
fucking,

344
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:34,530
the people that were coming there
because at that point it wasn't a draw.

345
00:20:34,531 --> 00:20:37,920
So they will basically come to the
club and I wanted them to have a bad

346
00:20:37,921 --> 00:20:39,960
experience because I wanted this
person to go out of business.

347
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:43,950
I can only relate to it at
that half a percent level.

348
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:47,000
So I can't imagine what the fuck they
will go through. But uh, it's going,

349
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,880
I have to tell you on a selfish level,

350
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:53,290
it's going to be really entertaining to
watch this guy fight the fucking NBA,

351
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,640
um,
and not try and

352
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:02,770
lose his team. I mean, Jesus
Christ. What a fucking situation.

353
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:06,530
It's just like, dude, just be a
fucking man now and just walk away.

354
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:10,310
You're going to drag down everybody
with you. One of those guys,

355
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,400
you know,
I dunno.

356
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:18,380
It's just what he did then
causes everybody else too.

357
00:21:18,381 --> 00:21:21,630
A little bit about the other owners and
all of that type of shit. It's just,

358
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:26,350
he fucked up. He fucked up. He is fucked
up. He got caught a bunch of times.

359
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:26,831
I have a dental,

360
00:21:26,831 --> 00:21:31,630
he doing other shit and he never changed
his fucking ways is fucking chickens

361
00:21:31,631 --> 00:21:36,190
came home to roost and uh, you know,
and what's, what's his big penalty?

362
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,470
He sells it and has $1 billion,

363
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,033
you know,

364
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,670
let's go buy a yacht,

365
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,700
just drive out in the ocean and scream
all your racist shit. And you know,

366
00:21:45,701 --> 00:21:49,870
you can be free out there, free
to do what you want. I don't know.

367
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,630
Did that make any fucking
sense? You don't. It was,

368
00:21:52,631 --> 00:21:54,420
I had to fucking steer around all the,

369
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:58,900
all the funny areas where
I'm doing the bid on it. Oh.

370
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:01,720
And then also the,
uh,

371
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:04,180
the Boston Bruins in the Montreal command,

372
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:08,760
Canadian started another classic
classic playoff series a,

373
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:12,640
the first game went to
overtime fucking Canadians one.

374
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,960
And uh, then, uh,

375
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:19,240
they had game to looked like they had it
all wrapped up and the Bruins came back,

376
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:23,980
came storming back to steel
game too. So it's one, two, one,

377
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:26,290
two,
unbelievable.

378
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:31,320
Like I put those games up against any
fucking games and though in the history of

379
00:22:32,501 --> 00:22:34,900
that series, but unfortunately, PK,

380
00:22:34,901 --> 00:22:37,240
sue Vaughn scored the goal
in overtime in game one.

381
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:41,770
And then like a couple of
years ago when that other, uh,

382
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,740
African American player scored in
overtime goal on the capital's,

383
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:50,490
a portion of the Bruins fan base goes on
and starts fucking trending the n word

384
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:56,110
on a,
on Twitter and then,

385
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,420
and then that just opens the shit storm,
you know,

386
00:22:58,421 --> 00:23:02,500
it's fucking ugly and all that
type of stuff and it really ruins,

387
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:08,320
it's such a pussy fucking move. You
know what I mean? It's such a fucking,

388
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:14,290
it's such a pussy fucking, I don't even
get it in 2014 to do something like that.

389
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:20,070
And a almost equally annoying is then
when people on Twitter start doing that

390
00:23:20,351 --> 00:23:24,490
real classy Boston when they send out
like, that's like this hacky thing to say,

391
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:30,190
way to stay classy. Like who started
that and why does everybody say that now?

392
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:35,340
And you only use class when you're talking
about like a sports team now did that

393
00:23:35,591 --> 00:23:39,310
come from Ron Burgundy stay classy.
San Diego? I don't know what it is,

394
00:23:39,311 --> 00:23:43,360
but I don't understand why people on
Twitter can't express their views without

395
00:23:43,361 --> 00:23:47,600
using like,
I dunno,

396
00:23:47,601 --> 00:23:51,830
like Twitter language
white. Why can't you,

397
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:55,410
why can't you just say that? You know,
that was fucked up Boston whaler you know,

398
00:23:55,411 --> 00:23:57,810
way to stay class or was that
like that trending thing?

399
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,250
I don't know what these
fucking kids are doing,

400
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:04,370
but here's the deal for all you holier
than thou cons that tried to make racism

401
00:24:04,621 --> 00:24:07,460
a Boston thing. And I'm like, I
can't defend Boston. Norwell lie.

402
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:11,040
It isn't an overtly racist yet.

403
00:24:11,041 --> 00:24:13,590
Liberal fucking bizarre place.

404
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:17,310
Like I think the reason why it's so
democratic is because so many people in

405
00:24:17,311 --> 00:24:21,510
Boston want to get a fucking state job
so they don't have to work. I mean,

406
00:24:21,511 --> 00:24:24,390
that was a lot of my friends.
I want to get on the doll,

407
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:27,990
I want to lean on a fucking
shovel and know, get the benefits.

408
00:24:27,991 --> 00:24:31,980
Don't you know the fuck.
Um,

409
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:36,540
there's a lot of that go on that yet.
It's still just fucking overtly racist.

410
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:38,190
But having said that,

411
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:41,970
all you people that fucking wrote like
Boston was the worst fucking city ever.

412
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,640
Um, and also believe that racism
is in the south and in Boston.

413
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:52,380
Um, become a comedian and
traveled the road. And,

414
00:24:52,381 --> 00:24:52,980
uh,

415
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:57,980
tell me what you think because
that has not been in my experience,

416
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:03,750
and I'm not gonna fucking be a Douche now
and name a bunch of towns or countries

417
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:08,940
that I've been to, but I got to tell
you that, uh, I dunno, it's weird.

418
00:25:08,941 --> 00:25:13,941
It's on one level where I think we've
progressed a long way as far as maybe in

419
00:25:15,691 --> 00:25:16,524
the media.

420
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:17,760
Okay.

421
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,530
Um,
it's not as bad and I,

422
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:24,750
but I sometimes I just think that people
just know what not to say now, but, uh,

423
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:27,210
on another level, I think a, you know,

424
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:29,300
yeah.

425
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:33,080
If the dollar collapsed, another Hitler
could come along and fucking crush it,

426
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:37,100
no problem there would,
there would be enough,

427
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:42,650
there would definitely be enough people
signing up for that at that point so

428
00:25:42,651 --> 00:25:46,850
they could get their chicken noodle soup
and get a nice fucking outfit, you know,

429
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:49,700
and, and take out whoever the fuck
he supposed to take out. I basically,

430
00:25:49,701 --> 00:25:52,610
that's what I have. I have, after
traveling all of that, I've traveled.

431
00:25:52,611 --> 00:25:56,350
I have no faith in humanity.
Ah,

432
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,740
that's such a terrible thing to say, but
it's true. It's awful. It's fucking awful.

433
00:26:00,741 --> 00:26:05,060
And you know what pks brother actually
plays for the minor league Bruins.

434
00:26:05,061 --> 00:26:08,000
I don't know his name.
He plays goal. And uh,

435
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:13,060
so now this kid has to put on the fucking
Jersey of a fan base that not only

436
00:26:13,461 --> 00:26:16,070
said it the most offensive
word to his race,

437
00:26:16,071 --> 00:26:20,390
but called his brother that and it's
just fucking, I just wished, you know,

438
00:26:20,391 --> 00:26:21,224
something.

439
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:25,940
I don't want like a big
brother or anything like that.

440
00:26:25,941 --> 00:26:30,020
The only time I'm pro big brother is I
really wish that when you wrote shit like

441
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:31,820
that,
then all of a sudden,

442
00:26:31,821 --> 00:26:35,240
like one of those police helicopters
would just be circling your fucking house.

443
00:26:35,241 --> 00:26:36,830
And then you had to go
to work the next day,

444
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:41,780
hanging your head in shame because it's
such a pussy fucking thing to do. Uh,

445
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,830
and unfortunate and it
takes away from this,

446
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:49,080
this amazing series, the
Bruins verse, the Canadians,

447
00:26:49,081 --> 00:26:51,930
which is going to go seven games.
And uh,

448
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,200
already there's a bunch
of great storylines going
on in it and the Canadians

449
00:26:55,201 --> 00:26:57,330
have a great fucking team.
So the Bruins,

450
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:01,230
I feel like the Canadians on the way up
and we're getting a little bit old yet

451
00:27:01,231 --> 00:27:03,690
we have this young defense.
I got tell you, dude,

452
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,930
I'm fucking loving Douggie Hamilton,

453
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:09,003
you know,

454
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,550
just because he's young. He shoots
the puck all the time, I feel,

455
00:27:13,551 --> 00:27:17,450
and he's coming down offensively
and like, um, I dunno.

456
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,160
Whenever you get like an older defensemen,

457
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:23,060
it just seems they never shoot the
puck and they always do the smart play.

458
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:28,160
And you sit there like blowing out your
fucking voicebox screaming at the TV

459
00:27:28,161 --> 00:27:31,700
going shut the fucking
day. Just showed it. I,

460
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:35,690
and I know they know the game
way more than me, but uh,

461
00:27:35,691 --> 00:27:37,790
that doesn't stop me
from choked the fuck it.

462
00:27:37,791 --> 00:27:41,600
They'd scream and you never have to
yell that it Doug Hamilton, it's great.

463
00:27:41,601 --> 00:27:46,310
He just shoots it. Craig's the
same way. Fucking phenomenal,

464
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:47,390
by the way.

465
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:53,110
I absolutely loved Johnny Boychuk Boychuk
Johnny Boy Chuck Celebration when he

466
00:27:55,881 --> 00:28:00,110
fucking blasted that one in from the, uh,
the Blue Line, the fucking Howard a shot.

467
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,940
And when he put his hands up in the air,

468
00:28:01,941 --> 00:28:05,660
I swear to God he did his own
version of the frank the tank.

469
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:10,100
Remember frank the tank and old school
when he started fucking doing the thing,

470
00:28:10,101 --> 00:28:13,370
like he was anti aircraft gun,
he did his a little slower.

471
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,090
So I think we hit as he was
doing more six shooters.

472
00:28:17,091 --> 00:28:20,510
But that's gotta be the fucking
greatest feeling ever. And the NHL,

473
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:21,740
you're a Defenseman,

474
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:26,390
you could skate 90 miles an hour
backwards and then you bring it into the

475
00:28:26,391 --> 00:28:29,750
offensive zone and you just,
from the Blue Line,

476
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:36,100
a fucking Bob goes right through
everybody right into the back of the net.

477
00:28:36,101 --> 00:28:40,000
That's gotta be the greatest
fucking feeling ever. So
whatever. So the first one,

478
00:28:40,001 --> 00:28:43,570
uh, the next game is going
to be in Montreal and

479
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:48,700
game three is always a fucking
crucial one in a seven game series.

480
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:50,723
MMM.

481
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:54,950
I think if the Bruins, when it, we're
definitely going to win the series.

482
00:28:55,400 --> 00:29:00,100
I would say, well definitely
when the fucking series,
if we lose that game, it's,

483
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,000
it's going to be an uphill battle.

484
00:29:02,001 --> 00:29:05,150
I still think we can do it just because
we have enough guys who were experienced.

485
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,880
Um,
but I dunno,

486
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:13,340
that game's reason that
motherfucker, uh, Allen, by the way,

487
00:29:13,341 --> 00:29:14,450
look at the Black Hawks.

488
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,080
All right.
They

489
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,910
now they're where they want six in a row.

490
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,680
Those mother fuckers are
going to win it all again.

491
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:24,820
And I think that we can get to the finals
and I'm worried that it's going to be

492
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:29,770
the same problem that we ran into last
year, which was they were just too deep.

493
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:34,720
They just had too many fucking
guys. You know, Patrick Kane,

494
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:40,390
Hosa,
Jonathan Tabes and then you got there,

495
00:29:40,391 --> 00:29:43,630
great defense know Duncan [inaudible]
halls guys. And it's just,

496
00:29:43,631 --> 00:29:46,600
it's just too fucking,
you know,

497
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:50,710
like you just don't get time off man.
It's a fucking,

498
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,850
they are still is still the team to
beat. And I think that they can, uh,

499
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,670
I mean they went and again this year,
that's 2010,

500
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:03,280
2000.
No wait,

501
00:30:03,281 --> 00:30:06,880
there was a 2010 then we
wanted an 11 who won 2012.

502
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:12,720
They want it last year,
obviously. Oh, the kinks. Also,

503
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:15,920
that wouldn't be a dynasty because
they would want three and five years.

504
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:18,200
They'll give you three out of four.
They'll call it a dynasty.

505
00:30:18,201 --> 00:30:22,310
Back in the day you had to went three
years in a row to be at dynasty. Um,

506
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:23,120
okay.

507
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,570
But either way, three and five
years would be the shit. So I,

508
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:30,140
I mean my money's on them to win
it all. I just don't see, um,

509
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:31,810
yeah.

510
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:35,320
You know, barring injury, I just don't see
anybody stopping him. I hate to say it.

511
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,640
I mean,
I'm obviously my heart.

512
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:40,360
My brain tells me that my heart for the
Bruins out, but uh, it's been amazing.

513
00:30:40,361 --> 00:30:42,880
And um, I've been kind of watching
a little bit. The NBA playoffs,

514
00:30:42,881 --> 00:30:44,590
they look like they're fucking great too,
but I just,

515
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:46,360
I just don't watch this shit.

516
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,670
You gotta pick one of the other dude,
I got to tell you right now,

517
00:30:51,671 --> 00:30:55,450
if you're watching all the
NHL in all the NBA playoffs,

518
00:30:55,451 --> 00:30:58,810
you have no fucking life. There's
no, especially the first round.

519
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:00,630
Okay.

520
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:01,590
Jesus Christ,

521
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,550
you're going to fucking watch 16 playoff
series or whatever the hell it is.

522
00:31:05,551 --> 00:31:08,670
He left. There's no way you can do it.
Hey Bill, we're not arguing with you.

523
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:13,120
Fucking relax. Okay. Um, all
right, here we go. Let's, uh,

00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:24,710
Um, I did something very
UN redhead ish yesterday.

591
00:35:24,711 --> 00:35:28,730
I actually went to the beach.

592
00:35:28,731 --> 00:35:33,710
my wife wanted to go and, uh, I gotta
tell you I don't like the beach.

593
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:38,820
All right? It's fucking dirty and
it's too hot. I'm not built for it.

594
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:43,680
You know, people just stare
at me like, look at it.

595
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:49,380
Is it gonna take his shirt off?
Or at least they feel like they are.

596
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:54,390
You know, I go out there and
it's just, it's a shit show.

597
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:58,380
It's a fucking shit show.
But, uh, I love my wife,

598
00:35:58,381 --> 00:36:01,830
so I took it and she has a
great time soaking up the sun.

599
00:36:01,831 --> 00:36:05,010
She absolutely loves it. And it's just
one of those things I have to deal with.

600
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:05,873
You know,
it was funny,

601
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:10,340
we ran up a mall cause I had to buy some
sunglasses cause this fucking dickhead

602
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:12,750
bus boy stole my sunglasses.

603
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:17,190
I get this nice pair of sunglasses.
I did this acting Gig, right?

604
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:21,330
And in the end they got
everybody something got really
a nice pair of sunglasses

605
00:36:21,331 --> 00:36:26,160
that actually looked really good
on my fat fucking head. And uh,

606
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:31,740
I went into a Vegan restaurant,
everybody Vegan fucking restaurant,

607
00:36:31,741 --> 00:36:36,450
my favorite Vegan restaurant in Los
Angeles. Could I sound more pretentious?

608
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:39,630
I'm bitching about sunglasses
that I got for free,

609
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:44,810
for working in acting in a movie and now
going to a Vegan restaurant and now I'm

610
00:36:45,511 --> 00:36:48,570
going to bitch because the bus
boys stolen and yeah. Yeah.

611
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:52,720
That's how out of touch I am.
You know what? Fuck that dude.

612
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,500
I was a busboy and I didn't steal shit.

613
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,240
I fucking send them down.
I walked out and I,

614
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:02,990
the time it took me to walk to my car
I said I'll fuck, can I turn back?

615
00:37:02,991 --> 00:37:07,640
And my table was clear and
they had already sat down
to other fucking emaciated

616
00:37:07,641 --> 00:37:12,570
fucks, you know, to eat some brown
rice and beans. And uh, I go,

617
00:37:12,571 --> 00:37:15,170
I left my sunglasses and
there can be camphor. Hey,

618
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,980
I got the busboy cleared off the table,
ask him. And he's just like, Yay.

619
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:22,070
He say he didn't see him and then
I was just like, yeah. Oh really?

620
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,270
So I'm not going to get him back.

621
00:37:23,271 --> 00:37:27,350
Basically basically saying that he fucking
swiped them. And then she's just like,

622
00:37:27,351 --> 00:37:31,610
no. Like they, people have found
I iPads and they did. Yeah.

623
00:37:31,611 --> 00:37:36,220
Cause it's fucking big to fucking iPad.
Ah.

624
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,570
[inaudible] me off.
You know something.

625
00:37:38,571 --> 00:37:41,830
I don't mind losing a pair of
sunglasses in a steak house.

626
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:45,380
You don't to use stereotypes.
You expect somebody do that.

627
00:37:45,381 --> 00:37:50,120
Been a fucking Vegan restaurant.
Is it supposed to be all like,

628
00:37:50,121 --> 00:37:53,780
hey man, like, no, I'm a stay, you know,

629
00:37:53,781 --> 00:37:56,000
happy Tuesday,
man.

630
00:37:56,090 --> 00:38:00,570
This is the only Tuesday and [inaudible]
right. That's supposed to be that vibe.

631
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,480
Okay.

632
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,830
I just kept picturing some Douche out at
a party wearing those fucking glasses,

633
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:08,960
you know?

634
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:13,960
And I had all these fucking Jason State
them fantasies of how I action hero my

635
00:38:14,911 --> 00:38:19,890
way in to get my fucking sunglasses back.
Except I have such a temper.

636
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,950
Even in my fucking fantasies.
I still punched him in the face,

637
00:38:22,951 --> 00:38:26,190
threw my glasses and broke them.
Huh?

638
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:31,130
You want them there is do they
are stuck in your fucking head.

639
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:35,060
Not a piss me off. So anyway, so uh,

640
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:39,430
so we go out to the beach and we're out.
This is mall in Malibu,

641
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:44,590
right? And it's just like the trophy
wife fucking, it's, it's unreal.

642
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:48,490
It's unreal. Like they are
walking around in trophy wife,

643
00:38:48,491 --> 00:38:51,100
he know a trophy wife because she's,
you know,

644
00:38:51,101 --> 00:38:55,660
she's still trying to look hot like
well into a fifties she has kids.

645
00:38:55,661 --> 00:38:59,320
It's like you did it, you're
married. Yeah, you have kids.

646
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:03,700
Why are you still trying to look fuckable
just look like a mom. It's great.

647
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:08,800
Comfortable clothes given to it. But
the thing is, is they don't have,

648
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:12,850
they don't have like a, I think that they
know that the second they let it slide,

649
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:16,810
you know that, that they're going
to get traded in or something.

650
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:21,700
I don't know what it is. They
all looked least to me, you know.

651
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:25,330
So anyway, so I went over there and
bought a pair of [inaudible] sunglasses.

652
00:39:25,331 --> 00:39:29,140
Then it went to the god Damn Beach, kept
my tee shirt on the whole fucking time.

653
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:34,730
I just sat there putting on sunblock
50. Oh yeah. I also said, you know,

654
00:39:34,731 --> 00:39:36,850
should we get an umbrella?
You want to get an umbrella?

655
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:41,080
So like he can like sit in the shade.
And I was like, no, I don't want it to,

656
00:39:41,081 --> 00:39:44,540
cause I don't want to see me
even like more of a freak. Um,

657
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:46,631
and then when I got there,

658
00:39:46,631 --> 00:39:49,570
there was a bunch of people with fucking
umbrellas who actually had pigment and

659
00:39:49,571 --> 00:39:52,530
then I felt like an asshole and a

660
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:53,880
okay.

661
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,713
I Dunno.

662
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:58,290
I ended up just walking down along the
water and the water was fucking ice cold.

663
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:03,600
And, uh, even when I get like knee deep
in the ocean, I just think like, you know,

664
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:08,670
what are these a fucking shark and just
swims by and sees my white calf and it

665
00:40:08,671 --> 00:40:13,020
looks like a fucking drum stick. Like
why would you go in this God damn thing?

666
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:17,200
I, I literally don't
fucking understand it on it.

667
00:40:17,201 --> 00:40:20,740
Like I guess I do because
people surf every day,

668
00:40:20,741 --> 00:40:23,380
like the amount of people that surf the
whole life and they never get bit by a

669
00:40:23,381 --> 00:40:27,310
shark. But this is the
funny thing. They, uh,

670
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:29,620
there's not a surfer I've
ever met that hasn't seen one.

671
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:33,980
I talked to someone in Hawaii, right.
And they will go on like a, I go, dude,

672
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:38,230
don't nervous about sharks. They're
like, well, I mean, you know,

673
00:40:38,231 --> 00:40:41,050
you try not to think about it.
And I go, have you ever seen one?

674
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,300
And she was just like,
well yeah,

675
00:40:43,301 --> 00:40:47,500
I just kind of lie to myself and say it's
a porpoise that maybe it's a porpoise.

676
00:40:47,501 --> 00:40:52,501
Like do you just see something big swim
underneath you and you just fucking

677
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,550
don't look at it?

678
00:40:55,750 --> 00:41:00,280
Look the way you don't look at as psycho
on a subway train or whatever. I Dunno.

679
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:04,360
I, I really, I honestly do not
have the fucking balls for that.

680
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:10,450
So, um, anyways, oh, guess
what I rented this week.

681
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:15,940
I rented a Chevy spark. Um, um,

682
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:21,010
we're finally getting the downstairs fixed
after all the water damage, you know,

683
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:24,820
cause this fucking house
is the money pit and a,

684
00:41:24,821 --> 00:41:27,970
so we're getting that shit fixed
downstairs. So I have my car,

685
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:32,350
my truck in the garage, and they got to
bring all the shit in through the garage.

686
00:41:32,351 --> 00:41:33,890
So I to,
you know,

687
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:36,230
I didn't wanna leave my truck out on
the street because I was afraid it was

688
00:41:36,231 --> 00:41:40,700
going to get stolen.
So I had to put that in fucking storage.

689
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:42,030
Okay.

690
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:45,000
And Nias working and shit. So now I
had to go rent a car. So they said,

691
00:41:45,001 --> 00:41:48,300
what do you want us to let me get a
mid sized car, whatever, fucking sedan.

692
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:51,480
Perfect. So I show up down
there and they did the crisis,

693
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:55,740
like griswell moved to me where they
bring out the family truckster and they

694
00:41:55,741 --> 00:41:56,401
basically like,

695
00:41:56,401 --> 00:42:01,260
well you're the Camry or whatever the
fuck is still being washed or Corolla is

696
00:42:01,261 --> 00:42:02,094
what it was.

697
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:03,050
Okay,

698
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:07,790
but this one's already
ready and I was late.

699
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:09,530
I had to get the fuck out of there.

700
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:11,030
Okay.

701
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:14,410
I already hated being there,
so I say, fuck it. I'll take
that little fucking car,

702
00:42:14,411 --> 00:42:18,440
dude. It is the worst hunk
of shit. You know, I don't,

703
00:42:18,441 --> 00:42:20,570
I don't get mad at cars
for being what they are.

704
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,790
If you're a little car and
you're a great little car,

705
00:42:22,791 --> 00:42:26,540
I actually fucking love him. Like I like,
you know, VW bugs in that type of shit.

706
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:30,080
But this thing is so fucking underpowered
just with one person in the car,

707
00:42:30,081 --> 00:42:33,860
if I put the AC on, it is literally
screaming at like, I swear to God,

708
00:42:33,861 --> 00:42:37,580
like 4,000 rpms going up
like the littlest inclined.

709
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:42,560
But I got to tell you, having watched
every episode of Fast and loud,

710
00:42:42,561 --> 00:42:47,540
that would be a fucking hilarious
car to Redo a Chevy spark.

711
00:42:47,541 --> 00:42:52,541
If you somehow yanked that engine
out and you could turbocharge a,

712
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:56,810
maybe you could get a six in there and
just put a fucking hurst shifter in there.

713
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,730
I bet you could tip
that fucking thing over

714
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,290
and there would no,

715
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:05,870
no way would that car not be one of
the most fun cars you would ever drive

716
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:11,230
because it would be like driving this
fucking this turbo charge golf cart.

717
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:13,760
That's all I keep thinking about that.

718
00:43:13,761 --> 00:43:15,710
Can I just keep thinking of
the potential of that thing?

719
00:43:15,711 --> 00:43:18,650
And that is the fucking
disease of watching.

720
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:23,030
And the great thing about watching those
car shows is rather than just accepting

721
00:43:23,031 --> 00:43:25,370
your car for what it is, you start
getting fucking ideas. Like, oh,

722
00:43:25,371 --> 00:43:28,400
what if I did this?
What if I did that? Um,

723
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:32,150
that's why I wanted somebody to paint
my file cabinet, which by the way,

724
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,820
I never even gave into,

725
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:38,180
I finally just looked at it and I just
hated the file cabinets so bad. I just,

726
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:41,480
I gave it away to somebody.
So it was a complete fucking loss.

727
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:46,400
So when are you guys who've been asking
me for pictures about my custom painted

728
00:43:46,401 --> 00:43:49,520
file cabinet? I ended up just
giving it away and I felt great.

729
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:52,370
I felt like a weight
was taken off my chest.

730
00:43:52,371 --> 00:43:55,370
It was just something about it that was
just so fucking depressing to look at.

731
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,340
Um,
I don't want to fucking file cabinet.

732
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:01,650
That's one of the worst sounds ever.

733
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:04,740
The opening and closing
of a fucking file cabinet.

734
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:05,730
Okay.

735
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:09,090
Have you ever heard that sound
and Ben where you wanted to be?

736
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:11,283
You know,

737
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:13,800
it's just an awful sub.

738
00:44:14,830 --> 00:44:18,990
I remember that sound when
I got my license back from
drinking and driving when

739
00:44:18,991 --> 00:44:23,100
he opened it and fucking closed it and
he as he was handing me the fucking

740
00:44:23,101 --> 00:44:26,580
license back this statey
right as I went to grab it,

741
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:30,120
he pulled it back away and he goes,
wait, what was it for 45 days if for 90?

742
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:34,710
And just gave me that last
little fucking heart attack. Um,

743
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:39,760
just to be a dick in a good way
to teach me a fucking lesson. Um,

744
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:41,360
okay.

745
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:45,110
I, speaking of that, somebody told me
you went on a Twitter to watch this

746
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:49,780
thing on, uh, on Netflix, on green berets.

747
00:44:49,781 --> 00:44:52,330
I don't even know if I rented the
right one. There's a couple of them.

748
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:55,110
The one that I rented was, uh, I dunno,

749
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:58,000
some 11 weeks of hell or
something to hang on a second.

750
00:44:58,001 --> 00:45:02,830
Let me see if I can find this shit.
Oh, sorry. 11 weeks. Two weeks.

751
00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:06,190
Do you know what I said? 11 because of
the two L's and health. I swear to God,

752
00:45:06,191 --> 00:45:09,520
the way my brain works, this is the
only fucking job I could ever do.

753
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:10,470
So this is a couple of,

754
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:13,960
there's one national Gri of geographic
special forces brought over this two

755
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:14,800
weeks in hell.

756
00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:18,910
I was watching this thing they just
showed the first couple of fucking days.

757
00:45:18,911 --> 00:45:19,780
I can tell you right now,

758
00:45:19,781 --> 00:45:24,040
there's no fucking way I
could ever be a green baret.

759
00:45:24,041 --> 00:45:28,170
You lie to yourself having never been
in the military that I could do that.

760
00:45:28,171 --> 00:45:31,120
You know,
I put my fucking head down no fucking way.

761
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:32,670
Yes.

762
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:36,810
Go on Netflix and check that out.
That's my youtube video of the week,

763
00:45:36,811 --> 00:45:39,870
except it's on Netflix.
Watch two weeks of hell.

764
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:42,090
I've only watched the first episode.

765
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:43,490
Okay

766
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:46,550
Dude, it's just fucking insane.
The first day you're there,

767
00:45:46,551 --> 00:45:50,390
they have a thousand pound
log that 12 guys grab.

768
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:51,710
Yeah.

769
00:45:51,710 --> 00:45:54,890
And you're just sitting there bending
over at the waist as you're holding it.

770
00:45:54,891 --> 00:45:56,000
Like you're going to do curls.

771
00:45:57,010 --> 00:45:57,610
Yeah.

772
00:45:57,610 --> 00:46:02,050
Up, down, up, down, up, down,
up, down. Like my lower back
would just, that would be hit.

773
00:46:02,110 --> 00:46:03,430
I would never walk right again.

774
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:07,660
And then they have it on your shoulder
and you got to pick it up over your head

775
00:46:07,661 --> 00:46:10,030
and then down and then,
and they're sitting there going,

776
00:46:10,450 --> 00:46:12,880
move the lug around your head,

777
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:17,710
not your head around the law,
number one 67,

778
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:22,120
what is your problem? They
fucking going off on him. And uh,

779
00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:25,090
you do that for like a fucking hour.

780
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:29,020
Then they just have you rolling on the
ground from one side of the pit to the

781
00:46:29,021 --> 00:46:30,190
other.
And if you too slow,

782
00:46:30,191 --> 00:46:34,510
other people roll over you
and it's supposed to make
you dizzy and disoriented.

783
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:38,950
And when you puke,
you have to get up and run out of the pit.

784
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:41,800
There's no puking in the pit,
but they know you're going to Puke,

785
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:45,580
so you have to run out of the pit
and Puke. If you puke in the pit,

786
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:49,870
you have to pick the puke up and put it
in your pockets and then get back on the

787
00:46:49,871 --> 00:46:51,160
ground to start rolling again.

788
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:52,903
And

789
00:46:54,070 --> 00:46:55,780
even the people who are
dropping like flies,

790
00:46:55,810 --> 00:46:58,150
I got to commend them for even
less than an hour of that shit.

791
00:46:58,570 --> 00:47:00,310
You got to see it all right.

792
00:47:00,311 --> 00:47:03,400
If you think you're working out
doing your insanity workout,

793
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:08,060
go fuck yourself and watch this thing.
It's the sick I and,

794
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:12,130
and now I'm just on the second episode
with it, just showing the teamwork.

795
00:47:12,850 --> 00:47:14,440
Oh my God. Do they have one thing? They,

796
00:47:14,510 --> 00:47:19,150
they're new mill in North Carolina and
they call this thing like the star where

797
00:47:19,151 --> 00:47:23,170
you have these five points to make a star
that you have to find using navigation

798
00:47:23,171 --> 00:47:26,020
and you can't use your light and you
can't go on the roads and you're just

799
00:47:26,021 --> 00:47:27,730
walking through the fucking forest.

800
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:33,670
And when come upon a river or a pond, you
have to walk through the fucking thing.

801
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:37,120
You can't go on a road and they bused all,
you can't sleep.

802
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:42,700
They bus and they got these guys with
these infrared goggles like Rambo hiding

803
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:46,090
and catching all of these guys when
they cheat and then you're out of the

804
00:47:46,091 --> 00:47:50,650
fucking program. Um, it's just like,

805
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:55,030
I don't think I could go more than 18
seconds watching this thing without going.

806
00:47:55,450 --> 00:47:58,480
I'd quit there. I'd quit
there. I would fail that.

807
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:01,690
The only thing I thought I'd
be halfway decent on is the a,

808
00:48:01,691 --> 00:48:06,520
the obstacle course because, uh,
I do pull ups and climb a rope,

809
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:10,480
but even then I do pull ups and
climb a rope after eight hours sleep.

810
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:13,690
And I had a nice bowl of oatmeal,
you know,

811
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:19,900
my wife gives me a kiss on the cheek and
then I go down there and I do is I go

812
00:48:19,901 --> 00:48:24,080
and, you know, I do as many as
I can until it starts to hurt.

813
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:25,790
That hurts.
And then I stopped.

814
00:48:31,350 --> 00:48:35,070
Ah, Jesus. I thought I was way closer to
being in Greenbrae than I actually am.

815
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:38,700
I thought I was only, you know,
1 million miles away from it.

816
00:48:38,701 --> 00:48:42,780
I didn't realize I was light years
away. So, uh, anybody listen to this,

817
00:48:42,781 --> 00:48:47,781
if you ever even attempted to become one
if or if you are one or whatever you,

818
00:48:48,031 --> 00:48:53,031
if you have any fucking personal stories
that you could send in about attempting

819
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:57,570
that, uh, I don't know. The
level of pain, whatever,

820
00:48:58,230 --> 00:49:01,530
what it's like to scoop up.
You can put it in the fucking pockets.

821
00:49:01,531 --> 00:49:02,970
I Made Jesus Christ.

822
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:08,790
You know what's funny is those, you know,
when you join a Frat, how they go, Hey,

823
00:49:08,791 --> 00:49:10,680
they have hell week and
all that type of shit.

824
00:49:11,790 --> 00:49:15,720
Like anybody's a Greenbrae should be
an honorary member member of every

825
00:49:15,721 --> 00:49:20,721
fraternity in the country because
I know that those fucking what it,

826
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:25,620
why can't I remember how long it is? I
want to say two weeks. It is two weeks.

827
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:30,060
I keep thinking 11 they're
right there, dude, look at that.

828
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:33,570
I have already fucked in the head before
they actually deprived me of sleep.

829
00:49:34,290 --> 00:49:36,930
They asked this one guy, they go, how
long have you been in here? And he said,

830
00:49:36,931 --> 00:49:40,920
Hash browns.
Okay.

831
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,550
And this is the thing,
he didn't take a head shot.

832
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:47,020
It's not like a football player.

833
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:50,170
They just had him pick a
log up for a fucking hour,

834
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:53,870
enroll around in the ground.
And they asked him,

835
00:49:54,050 --> 00:49:57,920
they asked him something like that,
like how you feeling? And he said,

836
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:02,920
hashbrowns so I dunno Jesus Christ,

837
00:50:02,921 --> 00:50:05,920
if that doesn't make you want to watch it,
I don't know what we'll all right,

838
00:50:05,921 --> 00:50:10,450
let's get on to the, um, the
questions for the week. Uh,

839
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:15,910
all right. Uh, no bends in
Israel. Oh, Jesus. Did I make
an ass of myself last week?

840
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:21,030
Somebody sent me a letter last
week. MMM. And the guy said,

841
00:50:21,031 --> 00:50:23,880
hi, my name is Ben and I'm
from Israel. And I said, dude,

842
00:50:23,881 --> 00:50:26,280
there's no fucking Ben's in Israel.

843
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,520
Like I thought that was
more of an American name.

844
00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:32,060
And I've met a bunch of people from
Israel and they always have these crazy

845
00:50:32,061 --> 00:50:35,870
fucking names. Most of them
begin with a y, you know,

846
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:38,570
you know,
like these bad ass,

847
00:50:38,571 --> 00:50:43,490
like I know Israeli martial arts
Moussad kind of fucking names, right?

848
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:47,900
I never heard a Ben,
Hey, my name's skippy.

849
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:50,600
They just sound like a regular
fucking name to me. So anyways,

850
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:54,500
and I got corrected brutally in
this fucking email here. Bill,

851
00:50:54,501 --> 00:50:59,501
you said on your four 28 14 podcasts that
no one from Israel is named Ben Dude,

852
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:04,310
they're prime minister is
named Benjamin Netanyahu.

853
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:10,730
Their fucking president
basically is named Benjamin.

854
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,510
Well I probably didn't hear it cause
they always say his whole name Benjamin

855
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:15,230
Netanyahu.

856
00:51:15,230 --> 00:51:18,530
You know like you have think how many
sports guys have really fucking awful

857
00:51:18,531 --> 00:51:21,290
names, but you never noticed it
until they just say their first name.

858
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:24,860
But if you hear though the whole name,
I can't think of a name,

859
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:29,240
but there's a couple of people that
just have really fucking awful God damn

860
00:51:29,241 --> 00:51:32,780
names. Let me think. I don't know.
I'll, I'll, I'll think of one.

861
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:34,100
I won't think of one.

862
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:37,080
I'll walk around and all of a
sudden it'll just pop in my head.

863
00:51:37,110 --> 00:51:39,500
Maybe I'll bring it up next
week, but yeah. All right.

864
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:42,440
She got me number two solid info bill,

865
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:46,730
except Ben is an name of Hebrew origin.

866
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:50,900
It means son of the south
or son of the right hand.

867
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:55,400
Hold yourself a press conference.
I don't know what that means.

868
00:51:56,330 --> 00:52:00,380
Um, all I know is that it's
an unbelievably arrogant
name to name your kid,

869
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:04,820
son of the right hand. I'm
assuming of God, Jesus Christ.

870
00:52:04,821 --> 00:52:07,580
Where to give the kid a complex.
The second he comes out of the womb,

871
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:12,500
he's got to live up to that name. Why
don't you go native American? You know,

872
00:52:13,370 --> 00:52:15,170
like he who sits with the hawks,

873
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:18,320
you know you got to do is hang out with
some fucking birds and your dad loves

874
00:52:18,321 --> 00:52:23,120
you. Um, number three.
How about Ben Stiller?

875
00:52:23,121 --> 00:52:25,940
Your blockhead.
What about them?

876
00:52:26,930 --> 00:52:29,660
I'm going to Google them right now.
Why you acting like that guy's from?

877
00:52:29,661 --> 00:52:34,250
Is he from Israel? Now Jesus am
I make it another fucking moron.

878
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:36,380
I thought he from New York.

879
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:42,530
Ben Stiller born in Brooklyn.

880
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:49,040
The fuck. I mean, I know. I'm
German and Irish. My name is,

881
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:51,350
and Wolfgang, you know
I have, I have bill.

882
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:55,610
I guess that's probably an English
name. I had a fucking, now you know, go.

883
00:52:55,790 --> 00:52:59,080
You know something. This is what I
don't like about this shit is listen,

884
00:52:59,090 --> 00:53:01,580
look at the way this dude calls
me out. He can't just say, hey,

885
00:53:01,581 --> 00:53:05,420
you made a fucking honest
mistake. Right? He goes, Bill,

886
00:53:05,421 --> 00:53:08,720
I know you're going to get a ton of
me emails about this Ben thing because

887
00:53:08,721 --> 00:53:13,280
you're wrong is fuck
great debating skills.

888
00:53:14,870 --> 00:53:19,760
Do you have a counterargument? Yeah,
this guy's wrong is fuck. Uh, anyways,

889
00:53:19,761 --> 00:53:20,450
he goes,
Bill.

890
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:23,720
But I know you're going to admit you're
wrong because that's what you do best.

891
00:53:23,721 --> 00:53:27,600
You're always ready to admit when you're
wrong and that my friend means you're a

892
00:53:27,601 --> 00:53:30,000
trustworthy person. Oh, look at them now.

893
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:34,230
Now that he fucking called me a moron
areas, he's bringing me back into this,

894
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:38,460
this fucking a sadistic relationship.
I'm sorry baby.

895
00:53:38,461 --> 00:53:41,070
I shouldn't have said those
things about you. Come on, let me,

896
00:53:41,071 --> 00:53:45,720
let me go buy a burger. Um, anyways,
he says a true sign of honesty. Uh,

897
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:47,160
no sir.
It isn't it,

898
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:49,980
it just because somebody who's honest
on a podcast doesn't mean they fucking

899
00:53:49,981 --> 00:53:54,870
walk around doing trust. I'll a complete
piece of shit, but I appreciate it. Um,

900
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:56,070
anyways,

901
00:53:56,070 --> 00:53:59,910
read this email after the
others and realize I could
be a great publicist if you

902
00:53:59,911 --> 00:54:03,570
need one, I'll be the Benicio
del Toro to your Johnny Depp.

903
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:06,240
Like in fear and loathing.
I'll be a bit of a mess.

904
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:09,690
You know some drugs and I don't know
where this guy's going with this shit.

905
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,810
I'm all right.
Probiotics.

906
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:16,470
Thank you for letting me
know Sir Benjamin Netanyahu.

907
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:21,120
I never noticed his first name was Ben.
This just so many syllables in letters,

908
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:23,680
like that's a name.

909
00:54:23,681 --> 00:54:26,970
Like you know when somebody drives by
in a car and they try to yell some ad?

910
00:54:26,990 --> 00:54:27,823
Yeah, you just hear, yeah,

911
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:32,320
that's like what that guy's
name is Benjamin Netanyahu.

912
00:54:32,321 --> 00:54:34,750
How the fuck am I supposed
to even notice Ben?

913
00:54:36,490 --> 00:54:40,540
After you get to Jamon Netanyahu,
it's fucking God.

914
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:42,700
Like The Ben part.

915
00:54:42,701 --> 00:54:46,030
It's like being part of a part of a large
family trying to get your story and at

916
00:54:46,031 --> 00:54:49,240
the dinner table I was getting
who I fucked up. All right, bye.

917
00:54:49,241 --> 00:54:50,420
I have to be honest with you. Like, I,

918
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:54,670
I forget Obama's first name a lot of the
times because I don't pay attention to

919
00:54:54,671 --> 00:54:59,650
politics. And, uh, it's
always like Obamacare. Oh,

920
00:54:59,651 --> 00:55:02,630
you know that boy who's just,
what'd you give the vogue? Vrbo,

921
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:06,670
are you surprised or Barb a lot? And they
just keep saying Obama. Obama, Obama,

922
00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:08,830
nobody ever says is first fucking name.

923
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:11,170
Okay.

924
00:55:11,170 --> 00:55:13,240
I guess. Say we say
Clinton, they said Bush.

925
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:17,333
I Dunno.

926
00:55:17,850 --> 00:55:18,120
Okay.

927
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:20,580
I just sit there and think what
the fuck is this guy's first name?

928
00:55:20,910 --> 00:55:24,660
That's how out of it I am. So if I don't
even know my presence first name, Barack,

929
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:26,220
or I've got to think about it.

930
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:27,790
Yeah.

931
00:55:27,790 --> 00:55:30,080
Out of fuck,
am I going to know Benjamin Netanyahu?

932
00:55:31,270 --> 00:55:31,920
Okay.

933
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,110
I can't stand looking at that part
of the fucking world. Anyways,

934
00:55:34,111 --> 00:55:36,240
that's such a shit show over there.

935
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:39,870
And the way that whole thing
was fucking handled to right.

936
00:55:39,871 --> 00:55:43,440
A wrong with another wrong. And then
the wrong becomes the, the, the, the,

937
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:45,330
the so called right.
Become the wrong.

938
00:55:45,331 --> 00:55:48,360
It's just the whole fucking
thing is absolutely ridiculous.

939
00:55:49,990 --> 00:55:53,980
They should just take everybody out
of there. Palestinians and Jews.

940
00:55:53,981 --> 00:55:56,510
And he just fucking,
I dunno,

941
00:55:56,530 --> 00:56:00,090
push the whole thing into the ocean
and just why don't you guys go,

942
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:04,000
go live in a place where you
just just look at it like, oh,

943
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:06,100
I like this street.
You know,

944
00:56:06,101 --> 00:56:11,101
rather than tying all that stupid fucking
religious horse shit into that part of

945
00:56:12,101 --> 00:56:16,720
the world. Well, this is where
God, Jesus use the Porta potty.

946
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:21,340
Eddie said, I love everybody,
but I love you guys best,

947
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:24,610
but whatever the fuck it is,
everybody's the chosen one.

948
00:56:24,611 --> 00:56:28,900
You Punch your fucking babies.
That's the dumbest shit ever.

949
00:56:29,930 --> 00:56:33,220
Yeah, I'll probably get a bunch of emails
on that, but I, I really feel that, like,

950
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:38,130
I swear to God, if I was part of either
one of those groups, I would just be like,

951
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:40,510
oh, you know what? I'm fucking,
I'm going to move to Rhode Island.

952
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:45,490
I'm going to get the fuck outta here. Fuck
this. You want it? It's yours. Go ahead.

953
00:56:46,550 --> 00:56:49,390
It gives a fuck.
Sit.

954
00:56:49,391 --> 00:56:52,570
They're dealing with is Hatfield and
McCoys shift for the rest of my God damn

955
00:56:52,571 --> 00:56:55,540
life. I want to go, I want
to go ride a boogie board.

956
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:01,240
I want to take a cooking class. I don't
want to fucking deal with this shit,

957
00:57:03,010 --> 00:57:03,791
you know,
I don't know.

958
00:57:03,791 --> 00:57:06,240
It's like I got burned out in
that Yankees red sox should after.

959
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:09,520
Well the while he just like you.
Yeah. And I did reduce it to that.

960
00:57:09,550 --> 00:57:11,950
It's fucking childish.
There you go.

961
00:57:12,130 --> 00:57:16,030
The guy who didn't know that Benjamin
was in Israelis name is telling that

962
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:19,810
entire part of the world to grow
up after the fan base of the team.

963
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:22,510
He loves drop the n word this
week. How's that? You like that?

964
00:57:22,511 --> 00:57:26,080
How's that for you guys at a nice
big bullet? Hypocrisy for you?

965
00:57:27,490 --> 00:57:32,260
Well, get used to it. Um, oh by the way,

966
00:57:32,261 --> 00:57:36,340
last night I came home and I
was an absolute fucking saint.

967
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:41,560
My wife was sitting down and she was
watching that guy there, um, who,

968
00:57:41,810 --> 00:57:46,810
who basically he has all
the real housewives get on
the show and then he just

969
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:50,290
stokes the flames to get them arguing.

970
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:55,930
And it was the Nini leaks group of people.

971
00:57:56,800 --> 00:58:01,800
And I sat there and didn't say a fucking
word and it might have been some of the

972
00:58:02,171 --> 00:58:06,310
meanest, most horrific shit. Um,

973
00:58:07,690 --> 00:58:11,260
I, I've ever heard people say to each
other and they all just look tired.

974
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:14,860
They just look spent there.

975
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:18,530
These ugly fucking looks on their faces
and they would just say in all of this

976
00:58:18,531 --> 00:58:22,640
hurtful shit to each other, and I
didn't say a fucking word. I usually go,

977
00:58:22,641 --> 00:58:26,640
how can you watch this shit?
You know,

978
00:58:27,450 --> 00:58:29,670
I thought you were a feminist.
How can you watch this shit?

979
00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:31,530
This is like depicting women.

980
00:58:31,531 --> 00:58:35,010
Like they can't even get
along for five seconds and a,

981
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:40,011
I didn't say shit last night and actually
Nia came in afterwards and was like,

982
00:58:40,411 --> 00:58:41,910
I had to shut that off.
I actually

983
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,770
had physical reactions trying to watch it.
The,

984
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:48,260
some of the meanest shit I've ever
heard anybody say to each other.

985
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:53,690
And I think I'm done with that show.
So there's one for the guys out there,

986
00:58:55,070 --> 00:58:58,100
just stop complaint,
just sit there in silence.

987
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:03,380
If you just sit there in silence
and let those women's voices,

988
00:59:05,410 --> 00:59:08,620
you know, why should he say those
women? Just say those people,

989
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:10,340
cause I'm not trying to
make it a female thing. I,

990
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:14,830
one of them said to the other
one, I mean dude, it was like,

991
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:17,660
it was be on a roast,
it would've got grown.

992
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:23,430
This woman's trying to get
pregnant using a sperm donor.

993
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:24,820
Yeah.

994
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:28,270
And this woman was saying like, you have
to do that because you don't have a man.

995
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:34,320
So now some guy who wants $10 to go buy
a pizza is now going to go jerk off into

996
00:59:36,311 --> 00:59:40,150
a cup and you don't know if you're
going to have a serial killer or a child

997
00:59:40,151 --> 00:59:44,680
molester for a baby because
you don't have a man.

998
00:59:46,630 --> 00:59:51,340
And then she said something Sassy after
that. Like, uh, you know, I dunno,

999
00:59:51,390 --> 00:59:52,930
I dunno, I'm not up on SAS, you know,

1000
00:59:52,931 --> 00:59:55,690
put that in your checkbook and fucking
cash it in or whatever the fuck,

1001
00:59:57,580 --> 01:00:01,960
what the fuck she said. But
it was, it was just like,

1002
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:07,140
and you just saw the fucking
hurt on the other woman's face.

1003
01:00:07,211 --> 01:00:08,044
Like she almost,

1004
01:00:08,890 --> 01:00:11,920
and then another woman who also
doesn't like that woman like laughed.

1005
01:00:12,490 --> 01:00:15,850
It was fucking,
it was fucking

1006
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:21,810
brutal. I mean, I mean, look,

1007
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:26,010
fucking comedians that I've hung
out with from Patrice O'Neal,

1008
01:00:26,011 --> 01:00:28,500
rest his soul to Keith Robinson,

1009
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:34,340
those two alone and rich vos like some
of this shit that they said like this,

1010
01:00:36,001 --> 01:00:37,650
like paled in comparison.

1011
01:00:39,590 --> 01:00:43,220
Jesus fucking Christ. It was brutal,
but I didn't say a fucking word.

1012
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:46,430
I Dunno. I was in the zone.
I didn't say anything.

1013
01:00:46,670 --> 01:00:50,600
I just sat there and I was looking at
a drum magazine and it was occasionally

1014
01:00:50,601 --> 01:00:53,930
look up and I didn't say a fucking word.
And then finally

1015
01:00:55,490 --> 01:00:58,520
everything that I wanted her to
think about the show finally happen,

1016
01:00:58,521 --> 01:01:02,660
I think because I finally shut the fuck
up and she could actually listen to it.

1017
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:06,650
Or maybe they truly just went way too far.
Um,

1018
01:01:08,130 --> 01:01:09,720
she said she was done with that show.

1019
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:14,750
So now I have this hope that if I just
shut the fuck up during all of these

1020
01:01:15,570 --> 01:01:17,880
reality shows where it's
a bunch of fucking people,

1021
01:01:17,881 --> 01:01:19,710
men and women just yelling at each other,

1022
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:24,540
that she'll finally stop watching
them and then start watching sports.

1023
01:01:25,510 --> 01:01:28,140
I know that's not going to happen,
but I can, I can fucking dream. Right?

1024
01:01:29,430 --> 01:01:31,020
I can have a dream.
All right.

1025
01:01:31,021 --> 01:01:34,230
You know what my dream is right now is
to read these next three ads without

1026
01:01:34,231 --> 01:01:38,640
making too many fucking mistakes. Okay?
All right. Dollar Shave club, everybody.

1027
01:01:39,030 --> 01:01:43,710
Nothing feels better than that first
shave with a fresh blade, right?

1028
01:01:43,740 --> 01:01:47,340
It's smooth. It's close in. The blade
is as sharp as it's ever going to be.

1029
01:01:47,341 --> 01:01:49,170
It feels absolutely fantastic,

1030
01:01:49,470 --> 01:01:52,380
but thanks to the big shaving
company is ridiculous prices.

1031
01:01:52,381 --> 01:01:56,670
You can't afford it to use a fresh blade
every week or even if you can. The, the,

1032
01:01:56,700 --> 01:02:01,590
the sheer principle of having to overpay
for that little piece of crap that

1033
01:02:01,591 --> 01:02:03,810
they're acting like is a bar of gold.
So what do you do?

1034
01:02:03,811 --> 01:02:07,890
You drag that Dell as blade across your
fakes face for two weeks, three weeks,

1035
01:02:07,891 --> 01:02:10,200
10 weeks.
Why do you do that to yourself?

1036
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:13,500
Maybe because the only thing more
painful than shaving with an old blade is

1037
01:02:13,501 --> 01:02:15,780
shelling out 30 bucks
for a pack of new ones.

1038
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:18,300

fresh blade every week,

but you don't want take out a
second mortgage on your house,

1058

1059
01:03:27,390 --> 01:03:31,350
He's actually getting much better
looking with age, you know,

1060
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:35,580
unless these are just bad pictures of
him when he was younger and Jesus do I

acidophilus as a dolphin list.
I Dunno.

1105
01:06:17,580 --> 01:06:21,570
It's a pill that has billions of cultures
of probiotics. It's really fantastic.

1106
01:06:21,810 --> 01:06:26,490
I take it all the time.
Um, what's the side effect?

1107
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:31,580
That's what I want to know. I always get

they're doing great for my gut,

antibiotic use can cause problems with

1129
01:07:43,790 --> 01:07:45,000
Also,
it's pretty much straight up.

1130
01:07:45,001 --> 01:07:46,490
You just gotta make sure
you don't get a bad one.

1131
01:07:46,730 --> 01:07:50,420
The FDA has not reviewed this
product for safety or effectiveness.

1132
01:07:51,050 --> 01:07:55,340
Consults your pharmacist for more
details. Well, there you go sir. Wait,

1133
01:07:55,341 --> 01:07:56,180
when was this written?

1134
01:07:58,620 --> 01:08:01,740
May 5th, 2014. Now this is the thing,

1135
01:08:02,670 --> 01:08:06,420
is this some other company just putting
this out because they have another pill

1136
01:08:06,421 --> 01:08:08,010
so that they're just writing bad shit.

1137
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:11,640
Like the people who made Jeep said this
is Suki Samurai tipped over when it

1138
01:08:11,641 --> 01:08:15,590
didn't cause they wanted to
sell more jeeps. Who, how
do you know who to believe?

1139
01:08:16,430 --> 01:08:20,600
I'm at medicine.net.
That's pretty fucking,

1140
01:08:22,740 --> 01:08:25,590
I dunno. I Dunno. It just seems,
does that seem like that's

1141
01:08:27,070 --> 01:08:27,500
okay

1142
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:31,400
Dr Com? I don't know. It sounds kind
of fucking generic. I Dunno. Whatever.

1143
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:35,000
I so he's saying is fantastic.
What do I know? What does he know?

1144
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:36,510
What does anybody know?
I don't know.

1145
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:41,260
I'm going to keep fucking reading
number two, uh, Kefir or Kefir.

1146
01:08:41,270 --> 01:08:45,980
K E F I r is like normal yogurt but has
many more strains of good bacteria in it.

1147
01:08:45,981 --> 01:08:48,830
Like those pills you were looking at.
I drink it in the morning,

1148
01:08:49,310 --> 01:08:52,790
in the morning to respect my stomach.
After a night of boozing.

1149
01:08:53,270 --> 01:08:57,500
It's at all the grocery stores.
All right, well fuck it.

1150
01:08:58,610 --> 01:09:01,700
I'll try that. See how I feel.
Um, thank you for the information.

1151
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:07,520
I'm somebody who else was saying that
that Stonybrook yogurt is a all natural

1152
01:09:07,550 --> 01:09:11,780
Stonyfield Stonyfield yogurt. I just
got to find out where to get it. Um,

1153
01:09:11,810 --> 01:09:14,950
cause I'm trying to get in shape for
my, uh, my damn special coming up. Uh,

1154
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:18,970
also by the way, tickets going
on sale for my special, uh,

1155
01:09:19,220 --> 01:09:22,190
we'll be in the next week.
I'll have more information.

1156
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:23,550
Okay.

1157
01:09:23,550 --> 01:09:27,950
MMM. Sorry. I have an Asian band.

1158
01:09:29,510 --> 01:09:29,990
Okay.

1159
01:09:29,990 --> 01:09:31,550
Isn't a select agent karate movie

1160
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:35,800
to first learn the way you must walk away.

1161
01:09:36,860 --> 01:09:37,200
Okay.

1162
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:41,260
Um, I ride, I get it. Don't you know I'm
not going to fucking pick it up after this

1163
01:09:42,940 --> 01:09:47,470
fucking 15 rings. All right. Thanks for no
music. That's funny. Thanks for no music.

1164
01:09:47,471 --> 01:09:50,080
And then there was some music right
there. Thanks for no music, Billy. Boy,

1165
01:09:50,081 --> 01:09:53,200
I'm so fucking glad that your
podcast doesn't start with music.

1166
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:57,040
Now that I said that the next one
probably will. I don't enjoy it.

1167
01:09:57,041 --> 01:10:00,640
When podcasts tried to go pro
and slick it all up to look real,

1168
01:10:00,641 --> 01:10:04,720
a rigid fuck that just shut
up and talk. I say, all right,

1169
01:10:04,721 --> 01:10:06,880
well I'm not doing that because
I'm trying to be a purist.

1170
01:10:07,570 --> 01:10:11,050
I got into this business because
I didn't want to have a job,

1171
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:15,040
so I don't edit these. I just sit
down. I talk for the most part.

1172
01:10:15,041 --> 01:10:18,430
I don't have guests, although
I did a special one. Uh,

1173
01:10:18,460 --> 01:10:22,480
last week I did an extra
one with the head director,

1174
01:10:22,481 --> 01:10:27,060
Steven Brill of the movie walk of
shame that I have a [inaudible]

1175
01:10:29,620 --> 01:10:31,390
now that you have passed the first test,

1176
01:10:31,990 --> 01:10:34,930
it is now time to start your lug training.

1177
01:10:38,770 --> 01:10:39,603
Sorry.

1178
01:10:39,650 --> 01:10:42,520
That just sounds like the music and every
fucking awesome karate movie that you

1179
01:10:42,521 --> 01:10:46,510
watch and it makes you want to get in
shape and start punching would then you

1180
01:10:46,511 --> 01:10:50,240
realize it hurts the quit. Um, all right.

1181
01:10:51,010 --> 01:10:51,530
Okay.

1182
01:10:51,530 --> 01:10:51,941
Oh yeah.

1183
01:10:51,941 --> 01:10:54,830
So I had Steven bro come in and he was
talking about the movie I've got to do

1184
01:10:54,831 --> 01:10:58,460
last year with a Ethan to
play and a Elizabeth Banks.

1185
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:03,950
Um, and it came out and that
people set a bunch of Nice stuff.

1186
01:11:03,951 --> 01:11:06,230
I guess they liked the work that I didn't,
they said I was funny.

1187
01:11:06,231 --> 01:11:09,340
Thank God and I appreciate that.
So, uh, if you get a chance,

1188
01:11:09,350 --> 01:11:12,170
you got some money to spend at checkout,
walk of shame.

1189
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:15,900
And if you don't want to go to the
movies because you have a great year own

1190
01:11:15,901 --> 01:11:19,710
entertainment system, you can actually
download it off iTunes immediately.

1191
01:11:19,740 --> 01:11:22,140
It's the new way they're going to do
movies, which I think is brilliant.

1192
01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:24,660
It makes me want to
upgrade my system at home.

1193
01:11:25,770 --> 01:11:29,790
Fucking perfect download. It's like
six bucks or something like that.

1194
01:11:29,850 --> 01:11:33,000
Costs you less money. You don't
have to go anywhere. Pop it in.

1195
01:11:33,630 --> 01:11:38,340
Support the podcast, my career and
the friends I worked with. Come on.

1196
01:11:38,430 --> 01:11:41,460
Do we solid Cinco de Mayo.

1197
01:11:41,461 --> 01:11:45,660
Everybody watch walk of shame.
All right. Here's the next one.

1198
01:11:45,690 --> 01:11:49,860
Balding at 19 Dear Bill Emoji.

1199
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:52,740
I don't know what that means.
Did I say it right?

1200
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:55,500
You guys just just tripped me
up right and left this week.

1201
01:11:55,740 --> 01:11:57,960
First I'd like to apologize
for my English. Dude.

1202
01:11:57,961 --> 01:12:01,650
You're fucking English is amazing already.
I know.

1203
01:12:01,670 --> 01:12:05,670
I can't say first I'd like to apologize
for my French and I've been working on

1204
01:12:05,671 --> 01:12:09,450
this shit for over a month. It's
Spanish. I can't even, I suck at it.

1205
01:12:10,140 --> 01:12:14,010
You'll tango Pero Pero I say it right now.
Fuck it.

1206
01:12:14,100 --> 01:12:18,510
I think first I'd like to
apologize for my English.

1207
01:12:18,511 --> 01:12:20,130
Since it's not my native language.

1208
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:23,340
I hope this won't give you difficulties
reading out loud because that would

1209
01:12:23,341 --> 01:12:27,150
really make the podcast lose its momentum.
You being sarcastic.

1210
01:12:27,151 --> 01:12:31,800
This happens every week. Um, anyway. I
am a 19 year old male and I'm balding.

1211
01:12:31,801 --> 01:12:35,430
For a long time I hadn't noticed
because I had longer hair.

1212
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:37,260
When I recently got my haircut,

1213
01:12:37,290 --> 01:12:40,650
I discovered my hair had started
thinning a long time ago.

1214
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:44,700
How the fuck do I deal with this?
Girls will often call me attractive,

1215
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:49,200
but I know I'm not attractive in
a very masculine way, so buzzing.

1216
01:12:49,201 --> 01:12:52,050
It would hardly make
me feel like a bad ass.

1217
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:57,210
I probably have a Dick shaped skull
hiding under my thinning main anyways.

1218
01:12:57,660 --> 01:13:01,560
Oh. Anyways, so that would make me
look extra ridiculous. Besides that,

1219
01:13:02,490 --> 01:13:07,140
I feel like I'm at an age when my hair
is still a big part of my identity and

1220
01:13:07,141 --> 01:13:12,141
losing it feels like Lou and losing
it feels like losing it away.

1221
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,750
Oh, it feels like losing a way
to express myself in some way.

1222
01:13:15,751 --> 01:13:19,830
Losing hair at a young age like this
feels like a one way ticket to mediocrity.

1223
01:13:20,190 --> 01:13:23,970
Always being one step behind the rest.
For the rest of my life.

1224
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:28,770
What's your advice on this since you
don't exactly have your axle rose Maine

1225
01:13:28,771 --> 01:13:29,640
anymore either.

1226
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:36,660
Thanks for the podcast. I love
just showing Amsterdam. Oh,

1227
01:13:36,661 --> 01:13:39,420
well thanks for coming out.
I'd love to going to Amsterdam.

1228
01:13:39,421 --> 01:13:43,380
It was a privilege to come to your
country and do my little fucking dance.

1229
01:13:44,010 --> 01:13:47,370
Um, all right. Uh,

1230
01:13:47,371 --> 01:13:49,530
your fucking feelings are natural.

1231
01:13:50,010 --> 01:13:54,870
Especially at 19 when I first figured
out I was losing my hair and my early

1232
01:13:54,870 --> 01:13:58,230
thirties, I freaked the fuck
out. I couldn't believe it. Like,

1233
01:13:58,231 --> 01:14:01,420
how could this happen to me? I was
like, Nancy Kerrigan. I just said,

1234
01:14:01,530 --> 01:14:06,270
Dan will go, why, why, why?

1235
01:14:07,180 --> 01:14:10,880
And then, uh, as I always
do, I just fucking go. All

1236
01:14:12,610 --> 01:14:13,930
this is the situation.

1237
01:14:13,931 --> 01:14:18,931
I can either sit here and act like a
fucking bitch or I cannot try to find the

1238
01:14:19,211 --> 01:14:23,680
positive. And I was just like, I, I
always, this is what I always try to do.

1239
01:14:23,681 --> 01:14:28,180
I just look for people who are in my
situation or worse that succeeded.

1240
01:14:28,181 --> 01:14:29,380
And that's how I think about,

1241
01:14:30,130 --> 01:14:33,370
I immediately just looked at
fucking guys like Ed Harris,

1242
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:35,890
Woody Harrelson.
I'm like,

1243
01:14:35,891 --> 01:14:39,430
they're still leads in movies and still
crushing it and getting nominated for.

1244
01:14:39,431 --> 01:14:43,930
So, you know, if I want to
let it stop me, it will,

1245
01:14:44,770 --> 01:14:48,970
um, who gives a fuck? Uh, why you
got a whole bunch of options now?

1246
01:14:50,050 --> 01:14:54,850
You know, you can even try and fight it
or you can just say fuck it like I did.

1247
01:14:55,510 --> 01:14:59,410
Um, you know, I've just
fine just giving it to,

1248
01:14:59,411 --> 01:15:02,560
I just find a given into
it is way fucking easier.

1249
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:06,100
It's just easier to just like, all right,
well I guess I'm going to be that guy.

1250
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:09,700
I'll be the friend in the movie. I
won't be the lead. So who gives a fuck?

1251
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:15,060
You know, he's still in the movie. I know
you don't do that for fucking living.

1252
01:15:15,070 --> 01:15:16,030
Okay.
First of all I would say,

1253
01:15:16,031 --> 01:15:18,740
but as far as like buzzing your head like
you have no idea what you had looked.

1254
01:15:18,741 --> 01:15:23,710
So I can tell you do it and you might
as well fucking do it. It's a fucking,

1255
01:15:23,950 --> 01:15:26,950
it's great having a shaved head.
Um,

1256
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:31,450
I would fucking just see what it
looks like and maybe it looks cool.

1257
01:15:32,020 --> 01:15:34,990
And then the, here's the deal,
if you, if you bald young,

1258
01:15:35,140 --> 01:15:38,140
this is how you catch up is if you keep,
if you stay in shape,

1259
01:15:38,650 --> 01:15:41,580
because most people,
um,

1260
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:46,130
it's an absolute shit show by the
time that 35, my balding at 19. Yeah,

1261
01:15:46,131 --> 01:15:47,170
that's gonna fucking suck.

1262
01:15:47,171 --> 01:15:52,171
But this is the thing you like women
really respect confidence and if you carry

1263
01:15:53,531 --> 01:15:57,730
yourself and you just make jokes
about you fucking hairline,

1264
01:15:57,731 --> 01:16:01,720
you have a sense of humor about it. Like
there's something about it that, I dunno,

1265
01:16:01,780 --> 01:16:03,010
women really respond to that.

1266
01:16:03,011 --> 01:16:04,870
I mean other guys will still
break your balls or whatever,

1267
01:16:04,871 --> 01:16:09,640
but like they just fucking respond to
it because it's a great character trait

1268
01:16:10,180 --> 01:16:12,910
that you're, you're, you have a
sense of humor about it. You're,

1269
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,970
you're dealing with, you
know, some form of adversity.

1270
01:16:15,971 --> 01:16:20,620
You're not being a pussy and letting
it drag it down. Like, oh my God,

1271
01:16:22,260 --> 01:16:24,390
it's making me start to think
that it's actually serious.

1272
01:16:24,391 --> 01:16:25,410
I never get phone calls.

1273
01:16:26,910 --> 01:16:29,730
BOMP bomp bomp bomp bomp
bomp bomp bomp bomp bomp

1274
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:34,290
if I have a host of late night fucking,
I can read your mind

1275
01:16:36,660 --> 01:16:37,980
shell.
This is going to be the music.

1276
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:39,140
Okay?

1277
01:16:39,140 --> 01:16:43,250
I look all mysterious and
I'll have like eyeliner. Um,

1278
01:16:44,810 --> 01:16:48,370
yeah. Your whole thing. Like I feel like
it's a one way ticket to mediocrity. Uh,

1279
01:16:48,410 --> 01:16:52,040
the one way ticket to mediocrity is
believing that you're on the road to a one

1280
01:16:52,041 --> 01:16:56,780
way ticket to mediocrity. Um, you know,

1281
01:16:56,810 --> 01:17:01,610
fortunately, uh, women are way more
forgiving of physical flaws then guys are,

1282
01:17:02,410 --> 01:17:06,380
um, so dude, you're 19 years old. Uh,

1283
01:17:06,410 --> 01:17:10,820
just stay in shape and go
out and crush it. Talk Shit.

1284
01:17:11,420 --> 01:17:14,840
Fucking hit on women that are
allegedly way out of your league.

1285
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:19,730
Just swing for the fucking fences and do
the same thing with as far as whatever

1286
01:17:19,731 --> 01:17:21,980
dream you have as far as the,
your dream job.

1287
01:17:22,230 --> 01:17:26,570
Just absolutely swing out of your fucking
shoes every time you get an at bat.

1288
01:17:27,230 --> 01:17:31,460
And you know, honestly, dude,
if you fucking hairlines
going to stop you, I mean,

1289
01:17:31,461 --> 01:17:36,260
Jesus Christ. Okay? You better than
that. You're better than that comment.

1290
01:17:36,290 --> 01:17:39,260
You're over there in Europe. You probably
can speak more than one language.

1291
01:17:39,290 --> 01:17:40,610
There's no fucking reason.

1292
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:44,480
Hairline or no hairline that you shouldn't
be out there just fucking crushing it.

1293
01:17:44,810 --> 01:17:47,330
And if you don't,
you have no one to blame but yourself.

1294
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:48,710
And I'm not being hard on you.

1295
01:17:48,860 --> 01:17:51,170
I'm just letting you know
that you have all the power.

1296
01:17:51,380 --> 01:17:56,080
You hold your fucking destiny in
your hand. All right? And they go,

1297
01:17:56,081 --> 01:17:58,730
and here's the upside. You're only
19. By the time you fucking 30.

1298
01:17:58,731 --> 01:18:02,240
God knows what they'll have. If you
want to have a comeback, you know,

1299
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:06,740
that's what I'm doing. I'm a hold it
out by the time I'm like fucking 60,

1300
01:18:06,741 --> 01:18:09,170
they're going to have the cure,
but by then who gives a fuck?

1301
01:18:09,171 --> 01:18:14,080
I'm 60 and then I think it will
actually be cool. It's like,

1302
01:18:14,081 --> 01:18:17,580
it's like having a civil war,
fucking facial hair, except you not,

1303
01:18:17,590 --> 01:18:21,340
if you're not a fucking hipster,
you actually fought in the civil war.

1304
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:23,440
I'll be that bald guy.
I'll be the last one.

1305
01:18:28,150 --> 01:18:33,100
Um, yeah. I recently just buzzed my
head down and I, I grew it back out.

1306
01:18:33,101 --> 01:18:36,340
I busted initially and then I got an
acting work and they wanted me to grow it

1307
01:18:36,341 --> 01:18:39,760
out a little bit. And then the
next couple of years I kept it

1308
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:44,430
and um, yeah, so you lose you. Hey,

1309
01:18:44,431 --> 01:18:46,380
just like what is the
fucking point of this shit?

1310
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:49,800
Keep going to get a haircut and
paying for a full fucking haircut.

1311
01:18:49,801 --> 01:18:53,850
This is bullshit. These people, that dog
in it, there's not enough up there. So

1312
01:18:55,170 --> 01:19:00,020
he just buzz it down and it's
just, I don't know. I like it. I,

1313
01:19:00,090 --> 01:19:01,350
especially in the business I am,

1314
01:19:01,380 --> 01:19:06,380
I am 100% of the v of the viewpoint
of not thinking what do they want more

1315
01:19:08,251 --> 01:19:12,840
coming with. This is what I look like and
I get it. If you don't want to cast me,

1316
01:19:13,580 --> 01:19:17,550
you know, how am I going
to, I'm never going to know.
It's because of my hairline.

1317
01:19:17,551 --> 01:19:19,920
I'm never going, they're not going to
call me about Jews to let you know.

1318
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:23,220
I'm just going to think I didn't
get the fucking park. But you know,

1319
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:27,060
you just keep looking at, you fucking
look in. Either they hire you,

1320
01:19:27,061 --> 01:19:29,810
you don't fuck up. But at
the end of the day, the word,

1321
01:19:29,820 --> 01:19:32,400
if say I never get another
acting job because of that,

1322
01:19:32,850 --> 01:19:37,260
then all I do is tell jokes in theaters
for the rest of my fucking life.

1323
01:19:37,261 --> 01:19:40,920
I mean I won. So fuck it.
And how did I win Sir?

1324
01:19:40,921 --> 01:19:43,620
Cause I went after my dream,
my dream job too.

1325
01:19:43,650 --> 01:19:46,110
So that's what the fuck you should do.
And as you get older,

1326
01:19:46,111 --> 01:19:50,010
I'm telling you the big thing
is not going to be your hair.

1327
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:54,360
It's going to be that you don't
have man tits. You don't have like

1328
01:19:55,770 --> 01:20:00,240
you body does it look like the
aftermath of a fucking mud slide.

1329
01:20:00,780 --> 01:20:05,010
That is something that they're,
you know, you need literally,

1330
01:20:06,470 --> 01:20:08,240
I dunno,
I don't know how you make a comeback

1331
01:20:08,310 --> 01:20:11,400
from that. It gets to the point
where it's so fucking stretched out.

1332
01:20:11,810 --> 01:20:14,940
Oh and I'll make it fat. People feel bad.
I mean they have operations for that,

1333
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,250
which looked better than hair plugs.

1334
01:20:16,270 --> 01:20:20,160
I'm just saying what happened to just
fucking don't come at me with that

1335
01:20:20,161 --> 01:20:22,080
negative shit that made
me sad to read that,

1336
01:20:22,081 --> 01:20:26,280
that you feel that shit about
yourself. All right, fucking, you know,

1337
01:20:27,470 --> 01:20:31,380
go have some probiotics and do some
pushups. You'll be fine. You'll be fine.

1338
01:20:31,470 --> 01:20:34,170
All right. There you go.
All right. My New Lady,

1339
01:20:35,830 --> 01:20:38,620
my new lady. Hey bill birth.
I have a major problem.

1340
01:20:38,621 --> 01:20:42,310
My New Lady of about three months
has opened a can of worms on me.

1341
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:47,500
We're both in our mid thirties.
Never been married and have no kids.

1342
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:49,420
Uh,
you know,

1343
01:20:49,420 --> 01:20:52,840
I don't know why that just remind me
of a joke in my act that I wanted to do

1344
01:20:53,830 --> 01:20:58,420
that it had to do with watching women
doing floor exercises at the gym to write

1345
01:20:58,421 --> 01:21:03,040
this down.
Floor exercises and there you go.

1346
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:05,380
I'm done writing the joke.
That's how I write people.

1347
01:21:06,370 --> 01:21:09,430
I'll write that and I'll write it on a
cocktail Napkin and I looked down and it

1348
01:21:09,431 --> 01:21:12,480
will say floor exercises and then I'll
tell the story and then it'll probably

1349
01:21:12,490 --> 01:21:15,910
bomb. But there'll be a couple rays
of light that I will walk towards.

1350
01:21:16,570 --> 01:21:19,390
And that's how it works. You liked
that? That was inside the comedy studio.

1351
01:21:19,590 --> 01:21:21,460
I'm sorry,
I gotta Stop Smoking cigars.

1352
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:26,380
I got two more left to more Cubans
from overseas and then I am done.

1353
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:29,490
I'm done.
I can't let them go to waste.

1354
01:21:29,491 --> 01:21:32,760
So I'm going to finish him in his fucking
done and I'm not going to smoke for a

1355
01:21:32,761 --> 01:21:33,270
long time.

1356
01:21:33,270 --> 01:21:36,840
I made the decision this morning when I
woke up and my fucking mouth tastes like

1357
01:21:36,841 --> 01:21:37,674
an ashtray.

1358
01:21:38,130 --> 01:21:41,100
And I also find when you have a bunch of
Cuban cigars and he just starts smoking

1359
01:21:41,101 --> 01:21:43,260
them all the time, you don't,
they don't taste as good anymore.

1360
01:21:43,290 --> 01:21:46,890
They just tastes like a cigar.
So it's like having steak every night.

1361
01:21:48,150 --> 01:21:52,510
So I need to fuck off with that
because it's a really bad habit.

1362
01:21:53,290 --> 01:21:57,760
All right. Having said that, I just bought
a humor door yesterday. Ah, Jesus. Bill,

1363
01:21:58,350 --> 01:22:01,960
if I can pick a sentence fence. All
right. My New Lady. Um, all right.

1364
01:22:01,990 --> 01:22:05,240
We're both in our mid thirties and
never been married and have no kids. Uh,

1365
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:09,730
she's bright, sexy, funny, and
quite wealthy. I love her. Uh,

1366
01:22:09,731 --> 01:22:13,600
she comes from an Irish American
descent and her first name is,

1367
01:22:13,601 --> 01:22:17,820
am I going to say what her first
name is? Uh, no problem. So as far,

1368
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:20,040
yeah.

1369
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:22,860
Okay. No problem so far
you say true. However,

1370
01:22:22,861 --> 01:22:27,861
two weeks ago we were
enjoying each other's company
having sex over there and my

1371
01:22:28,231 --> 01:22:30,030
new lady whispered.

1372
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:32,433
Okay.

1373
01:22:32,620 --> 01:22:33,760
Oh No.

1374
01:22:34,610 --> 01:22:35,170
Okay.

1375
01:22:35,170 --> 01:22:40,090
Oh my God. Oh Jesus. All right,

1376
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:42,850
you guys at work right now?
You guys at work?

1377
01:22:42,851 --> 01:22:45,760
Turn this up a little bit cause you're
not going to want to miss this. Okay?

1378
01:22:46,630 --> 01:22:50,950
Turn around, look around your cubicle.
Make sure the boss isn't coming.

1379
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:55,270
Turn your raw open for business.
Sign to close.

1380
01:22:57,680 --> 01:23:00,160
All right. I usually don't name names
and I got a name the name. Okay.

1381
01:23:00,161 --> 01:23:05,050
Her name is Bernadette. Okay. And I'm
only saying that because this is pivotal.

1382
01:23:05,740 --> 01:23:06,371
She goes,
however,

1383
01:23:06,371 --> 01:23:11,020
two weeks ago we were enjoying each
other's company and my new lady whispered

1384
01:23:11,021 --> 01:23:16,021
basically during sex that bur
B e r short for Bernadette.

1385
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:18,913
Okay.

1386
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:20,670
Would like it up the ass.

1387
01:23:24,090 --> 01:23:26,760
That's what she said. [inaudible]
would like it up the ass. Oh wait,

1388
01:23:26,761 --> 01:23:30,840
did you think of me then?
Oh No. That's hilarious.

1389
01:23:31,740 --> 01:23:34,740
Oh Shit.
He goes delighted with the opportunity.

1390
01:23:34,830 --> 01:23:38,820
I assumed the position and an
awful thoughts suddenly struck me.

1391
01:23:39,420 --> 01:23:41,150
Burger is for now.
It's the same.

1392
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:43,170
Yes.

1393
01:23:43,170 --> 01:23:46,850
The bar at my problems began.
Oh No,

1394
01:23:47,750 --> 01:23:50,330
you didn't have a performance
problem, did you? He goes,

1395
01:23:50,331 --> 01:23:54,950
I can only picture your redheaded freckled
face looking over a shoulder that at

1396
01:23:54,951 --> 01:23:57,800
me.
I tried mushing her face into the pillow.

1397
01:23:57,801 --> 01:24:02,330
Bowman in my mind all I could hear
your muffle Bostonian Twang shouting,

1398
01:24:02,331 --> 01:24:05,630
go fuck yourself. This is killing
me now. And it's stuck in my head.

1399
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:09,230
Every time we get friendly or anytime
I call, I call her [inaudible].

1400
01:24:10,340 --> 01:24:15,020
Your face pops in my mind. I'm going
crazy. What can, can you suggest?

1401
01:24:15,021 --> 01:24:19,400
Should I just dumper? Go
Fuck Yourself. Oh God,

1402
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:21,080
yeah.

1403
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:22,640
You ruined my name for me.

1404
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:27,420
What do you do?
First of all,

1405
01:24:27,421 --> 01:24:32,421
stop listening to my comedy and my
podcast immediately cold Turkey.

1406
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:36,870
And then second of all,
I guess you got to fucking decide.

1407
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:39,713
Yeah,

1408
01:24:40,270 --> 01:24:41,940
I, this is what I would
say. Two. I say, listen,

1409
01:24:42,660 --> 01:24:46,140
you've got to stop referring to yourself.
Is that name?

1410
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:49,110
I would just be honest with it. Listen,
I gotta tell you something. All right.

1411
01:24:50,060 --> 01:24:50,500
Yeah.

1412
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:52,810
You don't, when you said bird
would like it up the ass,

1413
01:24:55,020 --> 01:24:55,853
like

1414
01:24:58,510 --> 01:25:00,340
it is good to tell the fucking story.

1415
01:25:06,150 --> 01:25:09,420
Oh my God. That's the creepiest
fucking email I've ever read.

1416
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:15,110
Jesus Christ. Dude, I
really feel bad for you,

1417
01:25:15,111 --> 01:25:18,890
but it's also fucking funny as hell. I'm
sorry I'm wrong. Ruining your sex life.

1418
01:25:20,590 --> 01:25:23,980
Um, yeah, man. You got to
stop listening to the podcast.

1419
01:25:25,260 --> 01:25:27,180
I don't know what that would do.
Oh my God.

1420
01:25:27,181 --> 01:25:29,310
Do you know what that
reminded me of one time? Uh,

1421
01:25:30,330 --> 01:25:34,710
you have a day that you have a data or
go out with a girl that has the same

1422
01:25:34,711 --> 01:25:38,160
first name as your mother.
I mean, any, it doesn't,

1423
01:25:38,161 --> 01:25:39,930
you've the first thing when
you're younger, you go, oh,

1424
01:25:39,931 --> 01:25:43,140
she has the same name as my mom.
Maybe this is meant to be, you know,

1425
01:25:43,141 --> 01:25:46,530
I loved my mother. Maybe I'll love
this woman. Maybe she's the one,

1426
01:25:46,890 --> 01:25:51,320
and then the first time you having
sex and you go to say their name,

1427
01:25:51,330 --> 01:25:55,710
it's just like, it's
over. It's fucking over.

1428
01:25:56,620 --> 01:25:57,230
Yeah.

1429
01:25:57,230 --> 01:26:00,950
So, uh, I don't know what to
tell you, dude. Jesus Christ.

1430
01:26:00,951 --> 01:26:04,310
If I knew I don't read these things
before I fucking look at these things.

1431
01:26:04,311 --> 01:26:06,380
If I knew that one was coming,
I would have closed on that one.

1432
01:26:06,381 --> 01:26:10,580
I don't know how to, how do you
follow that one? You know what?

1433
01:26:10,581 --> 01:26:14,780
I'll tell you how you follow it with
an email. Trans gender athletes.

1434
01:26:15,890 --> 01:26:20,300
Uh, hey Billy beer belly. Ah, I
fucking hate how fucking true that is.

1435
01:26:20,690 --> 01:26:25,250
I'm a lady listener on your podcast.
Ah, thank God a woman wrote in Jesus,

1436
01:26:25,251 --> 01:26:29,180
I wish you guys would do that more often
to try to balance this out. He goes,

1437
01:26:29,181 --> 01:26:32,900
I'm a lady listener of your podcast and
think your opinions are often really

1438
01:26:32,901 --> 01:26:37,340
honest and truthful. Why do I sense an a
fucking uppercut coming? So I was hoping,

1439
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:40,850
hoping you could give your opinion
on something. All right. She said,

1440
01:26:40,851 --> 01:26:45,851
I just started getting really interested
in Trans Rights transgender athletes.

1441
01:26:47,811 --> 01:26:48,351
Right,
okay.

1442
01:26:48,351 --> 01:26:52,430
And have become a major advocate for the
lovely people that ended up having to

1443
01:26:52,431 --> 01:26:57,180
fight such a difficult uphill battle.
Um,

1444
01:26:57,270 --> 01:27:00,840
I am definitely convinced that
trans people, why does she,

1445
01:27:00,990 --> 01:27:03,810
why does she have like a
fucking Asterik next to it?

1446
01:27:06,170 --> 01:27:11,170
Trans people really should be allowed
to be the gender they identify with,

1447
01:27:13,130 --> 01:27:15,230
identify as without discrimination.

1448
01:27:15,530 --> 01:27:20,530
But the issue is still hard for me to
grasp is that of trans athletes competing

1449
01:27:21,231 --> 01:27:24,470
in professional sports.
It seemed like it could be unfortunate.

1450
01:27:24,620 --> 01:27:28,970
It seems like it could unfortunately be
an unfair advantage for the Trans woman.

1451
01:27:29,210 --> 01:27:31,460
Meaning they were born
with male genitalia,

1452
01:27:31,490 --> 01:27:36,080
but identify as a woman because of their
extra testosterone and bigger build.

1453
01:27:36,530 --> 01:27:41,210
I am really conflicted on the issue and
wonder what you think. Yeah, I definitely,

1454
01:27:41,660 --> 01:27:46,280
yeah. There was a while ago, there
was a dude who wanted to be a woman,

1455
01:27:46,610 --> 01:27:49,970
became a woman and he was a professional
tennis player and he just started

1456
01:27:49,971 --> 01:27:53,660
crushing it on the female, like
whatever. He was ranked as a guy.

1457
01:27:53,661 --> 01:27:57,080
He was ranked way higher. And uh,
yeah, I don't think that that's fair.

1458
01:27:58,090 --> 01:27:58,923
MMM.

1459
01:28:00,060 --> 01:28:02,700
But there's not enough of them
to start their own league.

1460
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:06,750
So I don't know what you do. Maybe
they should start their own. Um,

1461
01:28:09,150 --> 01:28:13,410
why don't they start their own like
NFL or something transgender NFL.

1462
01:28:14,740 --> 01:28:15,580
Is that bad?

1463
01:28:16,790 --> 01:28:20,060
I don't understand. Like the
women's started w NBA one
don't they started trend.

1464
01:28:20,090 --> 01:28:24,060
That's that. Maybe that's
the solution. You got the,

1465
01:28:24,061 --> 01:28:27,420
I have a dick and always had one
and want to continue having one.

1466
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:31,200
And then you have the, I have
a VAD, I'm happy with it.

1467
01:28:31,201 --> 01:28:35,520
You have both those leagues and then
you could have another leak. You know,

1468
01:28:35,521 --> 01:28:38,640
I'm a seeker.
That'd be a good name for a team.

1469
01:28:38,641 --> 01:28:41,040
Write the fucking Omaha seekers.

1470
01:28:44,100 --> 01:28:45,030
Why not?

1471
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:50,270
And I think the biggest problem with the
league was figuring out when to air it

1472
01:28:50,660 --> 01:28:52,100
so you could get some TV time

1473
01:28:53,810 --> 01:28:56,420
now then you just have the
fucking transgendered. Oprah.

1474
01:28:57,530 --> 01:29:01,660
You don't start his, her own
fucking network. I mean it's just,

1475
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:03,150
it's just fucking sitting there.

1476
01:29:03,690 --> 01:29:08,260
I think the big problem that a lot
of people make is they try to go, uh,

1477
01:29:08,340 --> 01:29:11,730
when you doing something
that different is you try to,

1478
01:29:13,310 --> 01:29:17,810
you're so hooked on the main stream,
Mike,

1479
01:29:17,811 --> 01:29:21,740
I want to be accepted. The way somebody
who isn't transgender is accepted,

1480
01:29:21,770 --> 01:29:24,290
like walking around.
That should be the deal.

1481
01:29:24,291 --> 01:29:29,180
But like there's actually something
to be said for being, uh, you know,

1482
01:29:29,570 --> 01:29:31,400
to not be in mainstream.
I mean,

1483
01:29:31,401 --> 01:29:34,460
there's a bunch of bands that aren't
mainstream that have this underground

1484
01:29:34,461 --> 01:29:37,760
following that make a really good living.
I mean,

1485
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:42,140
I'll make an a great living as a comedian.
I don't have a fucking TV show.

1486
01:29:42,170 --> 01:29:45,440
Never had one, you know, so I guess

1487
01:29:46,940 --> 01:29:48,500
why, you know, you could, you could start,

1488
01:29:48,501 --> 01:29:51,650
you could start your own shit and then if
you start your own shit and you own it,

1489
01:29:51,680 --> 01:29:55,520
like Dana White, I dunno, that's
how I was looking at shit.

1490
01:29:55,630 --> 01:29:59,600
I never look at it like, Hey, let's
join the thing that already exists.

1491
01:30:00,350 --> 01:30:03,620
It already exists.
So shit is set in stone.

1492
01:30:04,430 --> 01:30:08,060
The fuck overs are already in there.
And the people getting paid,

1493
01:30:08,061 --> 01:30:09,170
I mean you gotta you gotta you know,

1494
01:30:09,171 --> 01:30:12,410
he got to spill some blood now that try
to fucking change it or he could just

1495
01:30:12,411 --> 01:30:16,220
start your own shit. Right? Like the AFL,

1496
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:21,470
who knows? One day he gets so successful
they try to buy out. I Dunno. Anyways,

1497
01:30:22,340 --> 01:30:25,490
where am I going here?
A Mam MMA fighter.

1498
01:30:26,840 --> 01:30:30,530
Fallon Fox is an example of a trans
woman who is trying to compete

1499
01:30:30,531 --> 01:30:33,950
professionally.
If you want a reference.

1500
01:30:35,240 --> 01:30:37,490
Oh yeah, yeah. See now
that's the kind of thing,

1501
01:30:37,491 --> 01:30:41,510
I mean that that is like
an unfair advantage.

1502
01:30:43,400 --> 01:30:44,240
I mean,
you know,

1503
01:30:44,360 --> 01:30:48,920
you're removing all right the dude's Dick,

1504
01:30:49,700 --> 01:30:50,960
but not as shoulders.

1505
01:30:53,830 --> 01:30:55,610
That is kind of fucked up then.
Cause then it,

1506
01:30:55,611 --> 01:30:58,150
it's like a dickless dude is
beating the shit out of a woman.

1507
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:04,600
Ask Him. But it's not like a
domestic violence. It's a fight.

1508
01:31:07,700 --> 01:31:08,451
I don't know.
And I,

1509
01:31:08,451 --> 01:31:13,451
and I would say every woman in the m m
m m m a I can say this with confidence

1510
01:31:13,820 --> 01:31:17,960
could kick my ass with ease.
Um,

1511
01:31:18,470 --> 01:31:22,680
so maybe it isn't, I don't fucking
know. I don't know what else. It's,

1512
01:31:22,681 --> 01:31:24,000
you know what it is?
It's brand new.

1513
01:31:24,060 --> 01:31:27,630
So we got to fucking throw them in
the mix and see how it all settles.

1514
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:32,150
They go kind of copped out on that one.
I don't have any fucking solutions.

1515
01:31:32,151 --> 01:31:32,491
Sometimes.

1516
01:31:32,491 --> 01:31:35,700
I think you guys asked me this shit just
as fucking watch me talk myself into a

1517
01:31:35,701 --> 01:31:37,710
God damn corner.
So there you go.

1518
01:31:38,430 --> 01:31:41,940
It's an hour and 31 fucking minute
podcast. I don't know how that happened,

1519
01:31:42,990 --> 01:31:46,680
but somewhere in there I tried to solve
the problems in Israel and transgender

1520
01:31:46,681 --> 01:31:49,110
sports and uh,

1521
01:31:51,340 --> 01:31:55,920
and then there was that other
email. Jesus. All right,

1522
01:31:55,921 --> 01:31:59,040
that's the end of this podcast. Everybody,
uh, if you'd like to contribute to the,

1523
01:31:59,590 --> 01:32:04,590
you can always go to a billboard.com and
you can click on the podcast page and

1524
01:32:04,721 --> 01:32:06,430

1525
01:32:06,431 --> 01:32:08,710
click on the Amazon banner
will take you right there.

1526
01:32:09,370 --> 01:32:12,970
Buy something on Amazon and they'll kick
me a link for driving traffic to this

1527
01:32:12,971 --> 01:32:17,110
site. Uh, that is it. I'm going
to be in San Diego this weekend.

1528
01:32:17,140 --> 01:32:21,700
We just added this date. As I'm
getting ready for my a standup special.

1529
01:32:21,701 --> 01:32:26,590
I will give you the city. Um, cause
it looks like it might have changed.

1530
01:32:26,650 --> 01:32:30,260
It might not have changed. I don't know.
Shit is kind of up in the air, but the,

1531
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,610
the first couple of weeks of June,
it's going down and we might,

1532
01:32:33,611 --> 01:32:38,140
I might have ticket information
by the end of this. Uh, this,

1533
01:32:38,141 --> 01:32:42,820
uh, this week. So look for it on Twitter
and on Facebook. All right, that's it.

1534
01:32:42,821 --> 01:32:45,280
Go Fuck Yourself. I'll talk
to you next week. Bye. Bye.
