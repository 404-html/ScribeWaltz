1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,390
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's
the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,080
January 13th,

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,870
2014 are you doing Monday the
13th you know, I heard that one's,

4
00:00:13,871 --> 00:00:18,030
it's bad luck to oh with
the a fucking trinkets.

5
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:19,530
Oh,

6
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:23,790
what are you going to grow up and just
just fucking man up lady and realize that

7
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:26,730
you fucked up your own life.
You know,

8
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,940
you know those people that got to spin
around three times and throw some cookie

9
00:00:29,941 --> 00:00:33,600
crumbs over there.
Fucking padded shoulder.

10
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,580
You know, so, so, so something
doesn't, something bad doesn't happen.

11
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,760
I'd like to take all superstitious people,

12
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:46,620
put them in a room and after I'm done
slapping him with a fucking garden hose,

13
00:00:46,621 --> 00:00:51,240
I just like to tell them that listen,
bad shit happens in life. Okay?

14
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,860
No matter what you got
hanging around your neck now,

15
00:00:53,861 --> 00:00:56,460
I mean how many times you
fucking point your fucking toe,

16
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,120
your left boy due south.
Whatever the fuck you supposed to do,

17
00:01:00,121 --> 00:01:03,360
it's still going to happen.
Still gonna happen.

18
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,630
Balances out the good shit. All
right, so why don't you stop,

19
00:01:06,631 --> 00:01:10,770
meet such a fucking pussy. Oh Man am
I talked about that a long time ago.

20
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,880
I don't care if you do it. You don't. I'm
going to bring it back up. Do you ever,

21
00:01:14,881 --> 00:01:19,080
did you guys ever see that there was
a Jesus camp? No. No, no, no, no.

22
00:01:19,081 --> 00:01:21,750
It was one of those big brothers shows,
one of those shows, one of those,

23
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,950
one of those. What else?
Fucking reality shows.

24
00:01:25,951 --> 00:01:29,730
You know where they got a couple of
meatheads in there? One of them's gay,

25
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,650
the other has no was raised by wolves.
And then there's a couple of hotties,

26
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,560
there's never a fat chick.

27
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,520
You know all these people getting
in trouble for fat shaming.

28
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:46,350
How about these reality shows once
the last time you saw a fat chick just

29
00:01:46,351 --> 00:01:49,920
walking around in a thong
in the big brother house,
you're never going to see it.

30
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,970
You're never going to fucking see it.
All right.

31
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,430
The only time they put them on fat
people on a reality show, if it is,

32
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:01,890
if the show is about,
I don't want to be fat anymore,

33
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:04,403
you know,

34
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,420
I can't think of one.
But anyways,

35
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:13,110
there was this show and
there was some chick on it,

36
00:02:13,111 --> 00:02:16,770
the reality show and every time she
had some big challenge coming up,

37
00:02:16,771 --> 00:02:19,860
she had to climb into a
fucking tree house, you know,

38
00:02:19,861 --> 00:02:21,420
without tipping over the cupcakes.

39
00:02:21,421 --> 00:02:25,740
Whatever the fuck they're supposed
to do is some angry at his dad hosts.

40
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:29,310
Now the blue team slowing down.
What the fuck?

41
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:33,630
You know that guy from the island show?
What is it called?

42
00:02:33,631 --> 00:02:36,060
Dangerous as survivor.

43
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,940
I fucking hate that show with my wife
watches that Goddamn show and we both sit

44
00:02:41,941 --> 00:02:46,680
there laughing. He's such a
cunt. I Dunno what happened.

45
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,580
He never used to be that way. I think
he's sick of doing it. One of those like,

46
00:02:50,581 --> 00:02:53,670
be careful what you wish for.
Like,

47
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,270
I mean at first it was his dream job.
He comes home to his wife, honey,

48
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,360
I got this idea for a show. I'm so fucking
sick of being out here in Hollywood.

49
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:03,710
Stuck in this God damn traffic.
You know,

50
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:07,420
trying to get the that side of the four
oh five Todd addition to be fifth banana

51
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:11,470
and like a fucking chaps to commercial.
I don't want to do it anymore. Okay.

52
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,570
I'm thinking of,
uh,

53
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:17,680
moving to Colorado Springs and
opening up a fucking burrito joint.

54
00:03:17,681 --> 00:03:22,570
What do you think? And she's sitting
there going, wow, why don't, okay,

55
00:03:22,571 --> 00:03:26,390
I understand you're stressed.
Um,

56
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:32,270
so go ahead. Just say it for me
anyways. That's not what I'm saying.

57
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:37,790
I'm saying just, just, you know, you're
very emotional at this point. These,

58
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:42,220
this is very, this is extreme. Um,

59
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,590
why don't you create your own show?

60
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:46,723
You know,

61
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,150
why don't you just, I
dunno. You like Iowa,

62
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:58,750
don't you? We will. You
do like go. All right.

63
00:03:58,751 --> 00:04:01,600
And then they just sit there at the
little fucking starving artists kitchen

64
00:04:01,601 --> 00:04:06,490
table and they come up with this fucking
show that puts him on a god Damn Island.

65
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:10,990
He gets paid, he's on TV.
He's going to get, you know,

66
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,330
groupie island, chest hair, pussy, right.

67
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:18,940
Chest air mean chicks who like tanned
up chests with, with, with hair on it.

68
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:23,870
And he gets his job.

69
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:25,370
Okay.

70
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:27,410
But then they're like, well wait, wait,
no, no. Before that they're like, well,

71
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,450
I don't, I don't know how to
write a script and like, well,

72
00:04:31,451 --> 00:04:36,450
why don't we just make it like a
game show? Well that fucking stupid,

73
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,820
right? And he's all pissed again and
he wants to go back to the Burrito.

74
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,410
But she kept them in the pocket.

75
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,490
Like every great woman behind every
great man kept him in the pocket.

76
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:50,350
And some are at some point,
probably halfway through the second joint,

77
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:53,530
they fucking realize, wait a
minute, what about the real world?

78
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,710
We'll do a reality show,
right?

79
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,910
We'll take 10 fucking morons and
we'll stick them on this. God Damn,

80
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,660
I would all right. And they'll, they'll,

81
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,770
they'll play hopscotch and fucking
connect for whatever the fuck we got to do

82
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,640
and the last fucking so whatever.
So he gets the God damn job.

83
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,340
I didn't know what the
fuck I am in this anymore.

84
00:05:15,341 --> 00:05:19,180
So he gets a fucking job and now this,
he's out there and did this.

85
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,370
This is a tipping point
where after a while it just,

86
00:05:21,371 --> 00:05:23,500
you're a human being and
you just get fucking bored

87
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,400
of the same fucking routines. The exact
way that I ended up in this business, I,

88
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:33,550
one of the main reasons maybe why I
travel so much is because one of the most

89
00:05:33,551 --> 00:05:36,010
depressing feelings I ever had when I,

90
00:05:36,011 --> 00:05:40,840
back when I was in the Matrix and I
actually had a real fucking job, you know,

91
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:44,410
I got up in the morning and made
myself a little tuna fish sandwich.

92
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:50,590
A little plastic thing is some fritos
toss an apple in there walking out to the

93
00:05:51,491 --> 00:05:52,324
car,
right?

94
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:56,800
The grease from the Fritos already
making that pit stain on my little brown

95
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:03,500
is I walk up to my rusted out car hoping
it's going to start hope and I don't

96
00:06:03,501 --> 00:06:05,510
have a problem with the fucking old,

97
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:08,470
okay.

98
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:13,150
Right.
There was nothing more fucking depressing.

99
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,390
Then that moment when I was,

100
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:21,450
had been there for a year and I was
actually sitting there going one year ago,

101
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:24,190
I was right fucking here.
I hated that shit.

102
00:06:24,191 --> 00:06:27,500
And I think that that fucking island dude,
he's not an island dude.

103
00:06:27,501 --> 00:06:29,260
He's a mainland dude
on the fucking island.

104
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:32,290
I think it's fucking with
them at this point. Okay.

105
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:33,970
He doesn't give a shit anymore.

106
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:39,150
He just wants to get through those
stupid fucking obstacle courses cause he

107
00:06:40,151 --> 00:06:43,150
wants to get, he's going fucking
nuts out there. He's already,

108
00:06:43,151 --> 00:06:47,380
these guys have been out on that fucking
island since like 1999. All right.

109
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:48,520
At this point,

110
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,970
he's kind of like those Japanese soldiers
that didn't know World War Two ended

111
00:06:51,971 --> 00:06:53,860
and they didn't find him until 1974.

112
00:06:53,861 --> 00:06:55,600
That's what the fuck is
going on with this guy.

113
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,370
So I don't know if you've noticed,

114
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:03,030
but Nia watches that show religiously
and with every season that fucking guy

115
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:07,720
gets angrier and angrier.
Now the red team,

116
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:11,140
they need to pick it
up. You just shit. Fuck.

117
00:07:11,141 --> 00:07:14,470
I just realized she's still sleeping
upstairs. Uh, what the fuck?

118
00:07:14,471 --> 00:07:16,770
It's five at 10 in the morning.
You know,

119
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:19,160
at that point I'm allowed to
fucking drill a jackhammer.

120
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:22,630
I get to a fucking podcast.
This is how I win arguments.

121
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:26,620
I rehearse what I'm going to
say before I get into, you know,

122
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:29,050
and then during the argument
I act like I'm fishing.

123
00:07:29,051 --> 00:07:33,910
Like I don't already have the
information and that's how I win. Um,

124
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,900
anyways, this is the Monday
morning podcast everybody and uh,

125
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:39,600
yeah,

126
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,920
I don't even know what
the fuck I was talking.

127
00:07:40,921 --> 00:07:44,280
I was talking about a
superstitious people. Boop, boop,

128
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,453
boop,
boop.

129
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:53,190
You guys like when I do Stevie wonder,
could that have been any wider bup, bup,

130
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,170
beat up booboo.
You know what?

131
00:07:55,171 --> 00:07:56,970
I think I'm going to do that
down in Korea town tonight.

132
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:01,440
I'll probably get a standing ovation.
Um, golden globes. Everybody.

133
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,960
Look, I went from reality
TV. What was I talking?

134
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:10,590
I was talking about fat chicks and thongs
does that my point.

135
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:14,090
Oh, there's never any point to
this fucking thing. The point is,

136
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:18,210
is for me to talk for an hour and just
somehow eat up an hour your Monday.

137
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:21,150
That's what it is. Whether it's in
the morning or it's in the afternoon.

138
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,660
One of my favorite things about this
podcast is that it is called the Monday

139
00:08:24,661 --> 00:08:28,710
morning podcast in the amount of fucking
people who so selfishly feel that it's

140
00:08:28,711 --> 00:08:30,240
their Monday.
You know,

141
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:33,600
like they're doing any sort of heavy
lifting on this podcast other than

142
00:08:33,601 --> 00:08:36,330
downloading it for fucking free.
All right,

143
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:39,660
why don't you and your index
finger go fuck yourselves.

144
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,070
This is my Monday morning.

145
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:45,330
It's 9:56 AM where I am and I am
recording this fucking podcast.

146
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:46,950
All right.

147
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:51,150
How many times have you sent something
Fedex second day to get there before nine

148
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:53,850
and it doesn't get there till three,
three in the afternoon.

149
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:58,110
Are you one of those constant
to hold FedEx? You know,

150
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,490
try to get $3 in a quarter taken
off your little fucking envelope.

151
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:06,750
Not even thinking that you sent something
from San Diego to Bangor, Maine,

152
00:09:06,751 --> 00:09:08,400
and isn't that fucking amazing?

153
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:13,080
Because me as a person who actually
gives a shit about getting there,

154
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,510
can't get there that quick.
Can I? I don't think I can.

155
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,840
I don't fucking know. It's amazing
because the letter doesn't care.

156
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:23,550
Doesn't have a dog in the fight.
It's fucking left.

157
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:28,250
It's just sitting there waiting to
biodegrade. So I cut him some slack.

158
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:32,240
Jesus Christ. Can you tell I
got a bunch of shit to do today.

159
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:36,260
None of this is gonna make sense. Um,
let's talk about the Golden Globes.

160
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:41,960
So, uh, oh, yesterday, yesterday
I went and I saw the, uh,

161
00:09:41,961 --> 00:09:45,020
the other, the Wah Wah. So the
wolf, the wolf of Wall Street,

162
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:49,550
I saw with Joey roses in my lovely wife,
Nia.

163
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,510
I went down and I saw, I saw the
movie, we were in the movie theater.

164
00:09:53,511 --> 00:09:58,250
We watched it together. It was, it was a
great moment because me and fucking, uh,

165
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:01,850
Derosa loves Scorsese.
All of his movies.

166
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:05,030
We quote him all the fucking
time verse he does it to yet,

167
00:10:05,031 --> 00:10:09,250
I've never gone to a brand
news Scorsese scores,

168
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:11,900
Scorsese, however the fuck you
say it, they'll say it different.

169
00:10:11,901 --> 00:10:14,960
Last night at the Golden Globes add,
didn't have an angry look on his face.

170
00:10:14,961 --> 00:10:19,230
So I think I've been saying it
wrong. Of course. Score Sassy. Um,

171
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:24,410
we went down and saw his, uh, so I
was movie had a great fucking time.

172
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:26,143
Um,

173
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:27,620
okay.

174
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:30,570
And then I went home and I said,
all right, I'm going to fucking, uh,

175
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,060
yeah.

176
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,700
Oh, what moves my point? My point
was, oh, yeah, me, me and Joe,

177
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:37,640
we're going to start doing the
uninformed show again. All right.

178
00:10:37,641 --> 00:10:41,240
We're in the same city. We're going
to start it out doing it once a month.

179
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:42,570
Okay.

180
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:45,270
And for those of you never heard
of it, it's basically UNEF, uh,

181
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,330
the uninformed show, no reading,
no research, just strong opinions.

182
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:53,760
And basically me and Joe, we go off
for an hour on a particular topic,

183
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:58,290
just coming from the hat,
making all kinds of ignorant statements.

184
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:01,620
And then when our, our
of ignorance is, is over,

185
00:11:01,621 --> 00:11:04,410
we bring in an expert on whatever
topic we were discussing.

186
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:07,620
And then he basically tells us how
fucking stupid and wrong we are.

187
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,250
Then that's the shelf. All right?
But if he can't do the math on that,

188
00:11:11,251 --> 00:11:15,690
I can't help you. Um, so we will
get an excited talking about that.

189
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:20,280
And, uh, so then later on last night
later, I decided I was going to,

190
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:21,110
while I don't know,

191
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:24,480
I'm going to be a good fucking person
here and I'm going to watch the Golden

192
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,470
Globes, right? I,

193
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:33,590
I watched the first playoff game and then
I recorded the second one playoffs and

194
00:11:33,961 --> 00:11:37,920
a, so I watched the, I watched
the charges versus the Broncos.

195
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:42,510
I watched that game and about 50 minutes,
it was fucking phenomenal,

196
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,190
was fucking phenomenal.

197
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,520
And I already forget the name of the
charges receiver who just fucking,

198
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:54,010
it's going to be a God damn superstar.
Whatever the fuck his was. He really,

199
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:58,360
really impressed me on
the, uh, on the big stage,

200
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:02,290
on the big stage there. So, uh, oh
fuck it. Let's talk NFL football.

201
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:05,770
I'm already into it. What do you like,
how, what do you say? What do you say?

202
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:06,970
A football,
feds.

203
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,940
All the favorites one
as far as I can tell,

204
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,493
you know,

205
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:18,640
like verse, he said the dumbest
thing ever. He goes, patriots,

206
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:22,840
Broncos in the AFC
championship. Dude, I called it

207
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:30,130
oversee going out on a limb again.
Um,

208
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:34,660
I'll take Brady and manning.
I think they're going to do something,

209
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,960
but I actually, I didn't believe
in the Patriots. I still camp.

210
00:12:37,961 --> 00:12:39,790
I can't believe how fucking
well they're playing.

211
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:44,800
The only injuries that
they've had obviously going
into Denver is going to be a

212
00:12:44,801 --> 00:12:49,330
tough, a tough game. I traveled so
much. I think we beat them this year.

213
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:51,370
Yeah, we did. That's right.

214
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:53,890
They were up big and then we
came back and be all right.

215
00:12:53,891 --> 00:12:55,540
It's not going to go in their
house and they're going to beat us.

216
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,760
That's how it works.
That's how it works.

217
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:01,810
And the one I can't understand is,
uh,

218
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:06,460
this is going to be a tough one.
Seattle and San Francisco.

219
00:13:06,461 --> 00:13:08,440
Cause you got the division rivals,

220
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:14,560
you never know which way it's going
to fucking go. It's like the Patriots,

221
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:18,190
no matter how good they are, every year
they're going to lose to the bills,

222
00:13:18,191 --> 00:13:20,380
the jets and the dolphins.
Two out of three of them,

223
00:13:20,381 --> 00:13:24,820
they're going to lose to him like once
at least,

224
00:13:24,821 --> 00:13:26,800
unless they get some
juggernaut of a fucking thing.

225
00:13:26,801 --> 00:13:30,790
But I'm just saying they see you twice.
They know what you do.

226
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:34,660
And every other fucking cliche out there,
but I still am sticking with Seattle,

227
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:36,301
uh,

228
00:13:36,301 --> 00:13:41,301
blocking out that fucking Douche chill
12th man musical that's going on.

229
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:47,470
Oh, we registered in earthquake
every fucking game. Ah,

230
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:50,880
they'd go in the way the rate of France
to more and more people are starting to

231
00:13:50,881 --> 00:13:53,700
become characters.
They're starting to paint their faces.

232
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:57,240
It's just somebody the real,
you know,

233
00:13:57,241 --> 00:13:59,340
they have the real housewives
of fucking Atlanta.

234
00:13:59,341 --> 00:14:02,460
I need the real Seattle
Seahawks fans of Seattle.

235
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:07,620
You got to tell those people to
leave the capes at home. You know,

236
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:11,820
every team has got that one jackass
that paints his fucking face,

237
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,810
shaves his head and sticks the
emblem on the side of his head.

238
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:19,560
Everybody's got that one
fucking jerk off and it's fine.

239
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:21,840
It's fine to have one,

240
00:14:21,841 --> 00:14:26,760
but there is a tipping point in the
stance where there's too many of them

241
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:30,960
and they start bringing this size.
We would make it fun of that Shit.

242
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,430
Like if you have end zone seats
and you make a bullseye sign,

243
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,040
just how fucking on originally you are.

244
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:43,460
That's right up there with the defense
side and the John Three 16 I don't even

245
00:14:44,371 --> 00:14:49,310
read the Bible. Okay. I don't
know how to make songs like that.

246
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,260
I don't know what words to use.

247
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:02,380
Sorry. Um, yeah. How about
an original fucking sign?

248
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:03,680
Yeah.

249
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,150
You run of the mill everyday.

250
00:15:05,151 --> 00:15:09,740
Fucking conch sitting around talking
about all this comics. Not original.

251
00:15:09,741 --> 00:15:11,900
That movie's not original.
This is derivative.

252
00:15:11,901 --> 00:15:14,480
This guy ripped off this and look at you.
Look what you guys,

253
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:19,160
he got all fucking week.
Probably more than a week.

254
00:15:19,161 --> 00:15:21,680
You probably got the tickets
for your birthday Assam. Shit.

255
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:26,390
You have all that time to come up with
a fucking side and you make the defense

256
00:15:26,391 --> 00:15:27,224
side.

257
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:33,110
Why don't you just put on a stupid hat
and then act like you're the crazy guy,

258
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:37,220
despite the fact that you're a faithful
married father of three who pays his

259
00:15:37,221 --> 00:15:41,960
taxes on time? Little toy you just saw.
Map happens when he puts out hat on.

260
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,550
We don't know what he's gonna do. He's
paid for his pretzels just like you are.

261
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:50,990
Ah, there's nothing I hate
more than the character.

262
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:54,740
Fucking the fan.
That's become a fucking character.

263
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:57,890
Ah, right there. I swear to God,

264
00:15:57,891 --> 00:16:00,080
you know what they should do
to everybody who does that?

265
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:04,310
They should pull him out of the stands
and make them throw a ball in public.

266
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:08,150
Okay, and when you watched the,
the, the lack of whipping motion,

267
00:16:08,151 --> 00:16:11,000
you don't let fall off a check throws
a ball that didn't have brothers.

268
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,493
You know what I mean?

269
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,810
The way they throw the,
our motion of a girl throwing,

270
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:24,590
who didn't have a dad that stuck around
and taught her how to throw a ball,

271
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:29,390
it literally looks like cheap animation.
Like it skipped a couple of frames.

272
00:16:29,391 --> 00:16:34,070
It's just the worst thing. I would put
my money down, put your money down.

273
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:39,130
I'd put my money down that if you took
one of those fucking face painted Douche

274
00:16:40,281 --> 00:16:44,240
bags out of the fucking crowd,
that's how they would throw a ball.

275
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,180
I could be wrong.
I could be wrong.

276
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,270
I don't, I, I liked the way it used to be.

277
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:56,550
When you go to a fucking game back
in the day you went to the game,

278
00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:01,550
maybe you had some old shitty
hat from your team. You know,

279
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:07,280
and that was it. And the rest you had you
stupid Jack. He just, the rest of you,

280
00:17:07,281 --> 00:17:09,050
you know,
other than your fucking hat,

281
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:13,610
when you walked out of that stadium
and your alcohol level, you could do,

282
00:17:13,611 --> 00:17:17,270
you could go to work. You just fucking
looked regular and you went there,

283
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:21,350
you drank beers,
you got drunk and you're scared kids.

284
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:24,680
That's what you did in the old
days. Okay. You have pissed Piston,

285
00:17:24,681 --> 00:17:29,681
a giant horse trough and there wasn't any
Sushi and there wasn't in this fucking

286
00:17:29,931 --> 00:17:32,850
dumb ass music.
What did I went to a game recently?

287
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:37,150
I went to the Bruins are
La Kings game and uh,

288
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,150
the Bruins played like, they really
enjoyed their time out here in la.

289
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,210
Do you have any times I've
gotten burned on that.

290
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:50,460
Any Boston fans who are coming
out here, um, and you know,

291
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:54,030
you get home sick and everything.
So anytime the Celtics,

292
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:57,390
the Bruins are the red sox,
go down to fucking Anaheim,

293
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,710
play the angels or whatever,

294
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:03,210
unless they do some inner league shit
with the Dodgers, you're gonna to go. Um,

295
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:08,280
I got to warn you actually
specifically with the, uh,

296
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:14,700
with, with the Bruins and the
Celtics. I gotta warn you. Okay.

297
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:17,100
Don't buy expensive tickets
cause I'm telling you,

298
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,770
especially with hockey,

299
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,210
and these poor bastards have to go play.
Uh,

300
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,790
they got to go do a road trip
in the middle of February,

301
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:31,800
two cow, Winnipeg, Calgary, Edmonton,

302
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:36,390
and Vancouver. It, that's fucking kill me.

303
00:18:36,391 --> 00:18:39,780
I would be a raging alcoholic
if I had to do that.

304
00:18:39,781 --> 00:18:43,980
So by the time they come down
to the sunny fucking cities, I,

305
00:18:43,981 --> 00:18:48,630
they got cabin fever. I'm telling
you. Or it's just, you know,

306
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:53,440
La has got some of the best look
at women out here. They're famous.

307
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:56,590
I'm telling you, if they don't
play, I can't believe the kings.

308
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:58,490
Yeah,

309
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:00,200
it took them this long to get good.

310
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:05,730
I would think that they would fucking
destroy all east coast teams and Canadian

311
00:19:05,731 --> 00:19:10,590
teams other than maybe Vancouver just
because they don't fucking like each

312
00:19:10,591 --> 00:19:11,970
other.
I don't know.

313
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:16,560
The amount of times I spent like 80 a
hundred bucks through stubhub to watch the

314
00:19:16,561 --> 00:19:20,630
Celtics play the clippers back
when the clippers sucked. Um,

315
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:24,300
and I would watch the big three
come in there and just get smoked

316
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,510
fucking brutal. So I'm
just saying, all right,

317
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:33,060
just be careful with your money out here.

318
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:37,650
Just get the upper deck shit,
don't wear any this stuff.

319
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:39,330
Yeah.

320
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:41,670
It just go there dressed like you,

321
00:19:41,671 --> 00:19:44,970
you fucking going to work or something
and then just cheer your team and it's

322
00:19:44,971 --> 00:19:49,440
great if your team Wednesday win, if they
lose, you'll walk out of the stadium,

323
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,260
you know?
And you don't have to listen to anybody.

324
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:56,070
Take it to that next level that makes you
want to throw a fucking punch and then

325
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:58,920
you're going to get stomped
by the neck tattoo guy.

326
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:01,230
It's just a different thing out here.
It's not fun.

327
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:04,620
It's not a fun place to see a game
out here. They take it to a Ya,

328
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:07,830
that's just a different level.

329
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:11,360
You don't really like when you sit
around giving each other shit that'll get

330
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:13,950
sure that blah blah blah.
You shirts too tight and all that crap.

331
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,800
And there's somebody that yeah,
at least my mother was a dead.

332
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:19,860
There's always like that person.
That's what west coast fans are.

333
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:22,120
Okay.

334
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:26,680
Anyways, the fuck was I talking
about? Um, oh, NFL football.

335
00:20:26,681 --> 00:20:29,610
So I still think it's a,
it is Seattle's.

336
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:35,440
I just think that, that, I dunno,

337
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:39,790
I just liked the way they play. They
get Marshawn lynch. He's a fucking,

338
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:45,270
it was the last time he didn't get
hit three times before he went down.

339
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:48,150
I

340
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:49,860
cannot get that fucking guy down.

341
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:55,550
All right. The defenses is insane. Keith
tell I've been on the road for so long,

342
00:20:55,551 --> 00:20:58,790
I can't even fucking name anybody's
name. They have beautiful uniforms. No,

343
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:02,320
I just think out of the way they're
playing and I, I don't think that, uh,

344
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:07,600
I think they match up well with
the Broncos. I Dunno about the 49.

345
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:10,600
This is the Superbowl they get
by the 49 is, I'm, I'm, I'm,

346
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,140
I'm saying that went in it,

347
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:17,190
they beat the 40 niners they're
gonna win it because, uh,

348
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,060
okay.

349
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:22,850
I just did. Defense is better
than the Broncos and I think the,

350
00:21:22,851 --> 00:21:23,631
with Marshawn Lynch,

351
00:21:23,631 --> 00:21:26,330
they can fucking shoe up the clock and
if patient doesn't have the ball in his

352
00:21:26,331 --> 00:21:27,500
hand,
what the fuck is he going to do?

353
00:21:27,501 --> 00:21:32,501
And I think Peyton gets frustrated when
he goes up against really a physical

354
00:21:34,191 --> 00:21:35,600
aggressive receivers.

355
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:40,610
At least he did back in the day when
that's what we had on our team. Um,

356
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,570
and who knows if the
Patriots go that Jesus,

357
00:21:43,571 --> 00:21:46,090
I'll just be fucking thrilled
that we made it. I really will be.

358
00:21:46,091 --> 00:21:47,310
And everybody's giving me Shit, dude. Oh,

359
00:21:47,311 --> 00:21:48,970
can we come down in your own fucking team?
I don't know,

360
00:21:48,971 --> 00:21:50,650
cause we lost their whole
fucking receiving core.

361
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:51,910
Okay.

362
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,470
Lost all these guys on defense.
I'm,

363
00:21:53,471 --> 00:21:56,460
I'm stunned that they've been able
to do it once again. I'm saying it,

364
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:57,200
I'm telling you right now,

365
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,340
Tom Brady's have one of the best fucking
seasons he's ever had working with what

366
00:22:00,341 --> 00:22:02,230
he's working with. All right. With that,

367
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,900
I have no idea it was going to one next
week. I hope we fucking win. But uh,

368
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:09,130
you know, I feel like, you
know, we beat them last time.

369
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:10,610
Okay.

370
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:15,290
And uh, I dunno, I was really
impressed with Denver's defense too.

371
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:17,780
So who the fuck knows whatever.

372
00:22:17,781 --> 00:22:21,050
All I know is there going to be great
fucking games and I'm watching every

373
00:22:21,051 --> 00:22:23,360
second of it. All right,
and that's the deal.

374
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:24,860
That's all they got to say about that.
All right,

375
00:22:24,861 --> 00:22:27,410
let's do a little bit of
advertising here this week.

go. That was pretty painless this week.

433
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,060
Um, anyways. Okay,

434
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:06,080
so I watched the Golden Globes
and watch most of them last night.

435
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:11,570
Um, as you do, you know,

436
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,740
I was watching all the football this
weekend, so I figured, you know,

437
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:19,370
I got to come her way. I'll sit down. Oh
cool. We'll come and watch it with me.

438
00:26:19,371 --> 00:26:21,560
I worry.
I want you to watch it with me.

439
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:26,560
So I sat down and I watched
the Golden Globes and

440
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:32,690
what wasn't working. It wasn't bad
for an award show. It wasn't bad.

441
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:36,500
The hosts were great.
They were funny. And uh,

442
00:26:36,501 --> 00:26:39,200
the only thing that bugged me was the
amount of people who went up there and

443
00:26:39,201 --> 00:26:43,920
when they won a golden globe, like, all
right, God, I can't, I have that tablet.

444
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:49,280
I was not ready for it as ready
for you a fucking nominated

445
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:51,790
Jesus Christ head.

446
00:26:51,791 --> 00:26:56,280
You fucking bets the amount of people
that went up there and said, oh my God,

447
00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:00,780
I can't believe this. I, I'm not prepared.

448
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:04,750
I didn't think I was going to fucking win.
You know,

449
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:10,510
like some fucking backup
goalie just sitting there and
all of a sudden, you know,

450
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:15,620
they are not getting in this game. We're
up five. Nothing is a joke. You know,

451
00:27:15,621 --> 00:27:18,700
you start texting on the bench and all
of a sudden the start and goalie pulls

452
00:27:18,701 --> 00:27:21,460
his groin and now you got to go out there.
What the fuck?

453
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:23,800
Yeah,

454
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,650
unbelievable. Do you see? How might
you want to see how it's done?

455
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:30,610
You should have seen Michael Douglas
the way he accepted his golden globe.

456
00:27:30,611 --> 00:27:32,260
First of all,
for some fucking reason.

457
00:27:32,261 --> 00:27:37,261
Anybody who won a golden globe last night
was seated like 75 yards away and you

458
00:27:37,451 --> 00:27:42,451
had to fucking walk all the way down
and then backstage and then come walking

459
00:27:43,571 --> 00:27:47,770
out from backstage. Like everybody didn't
just see you get up from your table.

460
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:49,691
So what does he do?

461
00:27:49,691 --> 00:27:53,290
He assesses the situation like Jesus
Christ has taken too fucking long.

462
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:58,350
So the second he gets called, he doesn't
go, all right, God, all right, got it.

463
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,380
Do you believe it?
And you know,

464
00:27:59,381 --> 00:28:04,000
clasp his hands together and then slam
him down into his lap. You know the Hacky,

465
00:28:04,001 --> 00:28:07,750
I've just won an award in
show business move. He didn't,

466
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:11,800
he got up and he starts jogging,
right?

467
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:17,800
Like a wily veteran, a grizzled veteran
who's knows how to utilize the clock.

468
00:28:17,801 --> 00:28:22,400
He's running up to the offensive line.
He fucking gets on the stage. He,

469
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:26,920
he goes into a great story about how he
got the part he thanked everybody before

470
00:28:26,921 --> 00:28:29,920
the fucking oboe player
even started was phenomenal.

471
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:35,860
It's like watching Joe Montana,
Joe Montana run a two minute offense.

472
00:28:35,861 --> 00:28:39,490
It was great. He did everything but
say John Candy in the crowd. Right?

473
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,830
That's probably a bad joke because
he could have been at a crowd.

474
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:45,730
He would have been at a crowd if
he didn't die shit. You know what?

475
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:50,320
It was a great analogy right up until
then, but other than that, I swear to God,

476
00:28:50,321 --> 00:28:52,810
like 40% of the people went
up there and said, oh my God,

477
00:28:52,811 --> 00:28:55,030
I can't fucking believe it. What do
you mean? Can't fucking believe it?

478
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,100
What do you mean you're not prepared?

479
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:01,990
Didn't the fact that you got
nominated months ago or weeks ago,

480
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,850
it's like a fucking 50 seconds.
They give you like a minute.

481
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:10,960
You know who you're
supposed to. Thank right.

482
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,510
Is that just like what
you're supposed to do?

483
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:17,260
He's supposed to have false
humility. False humility. So he said,

484
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:20,710
if I ever win a golden globe,
I'm not going to be fucking modest at all.

485
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,930
I'll just be up there talking shit.

486
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:28,740
Okay,

487
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:33,710
well before I even get up to the
podium. That's right. That's right.

488
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,640
I'm not going to come up here
and pretend to be modest. Dude,

489
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:40,960
I fucking crushed it this year.
Do you see what I was working?

490
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:45,760
You see that horse shit that they put
on the paper that I'd bring the life,

491
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:51,580
pay attention to me, Alice. That was
supposed to be me yelling at Ambi Davis,

492
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:58,060
Jesus Christ. I this, I don't what
the Fuck I had to keep walking out.

493
00:29:58,061 --> 00:30:01,180
There was some Zombie that went up there.
First of all,

494
00:30:01,181 --> 00:30:06,010
she sat for fucking a minute looking
around just milking the whole fucking

495
00:30:06,011 --> 00:30:10,570
moment, you know? And she was
a classic old actress, right?

496
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:14,800
She had the body of a 23 year old
and and the in the face of a mummy,

497
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:24,780
you know, go fuck yourself if you
think that's to mean all right.

498
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,770
Dress and act of God damn.

499
00:30:26,771 --> 00:30:30,520
Age with the fucking shoe Polish in your
hair coming down there looking like a

500
00:30:30,521 --> 00:30:35,110
sexy scarecrow. Anyways,
so she fucking comes down.

501
00:30:35,111 --> 00:30:39,390
They like something out of a horror movie.
I literally,

502
00:30:39,391 --> 00:30:43,710
I had to walk out of the room. I have
this thing, not only do I hate bombing,

503
00:30:43,711 --> 00:30:47,250
I can't stand watching people bomb I,

504
00:30:47,251 --> 00:30:49,890
it makes me uncomfortable.
I had to walk out.

505
00:30:49,891 --> 00:30:54,150
Nia sat there with their hand up to her
mouth and I don't know what this woman

506
00:30:54,151 --> 00:30:54,984
was doing.

507
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:59,220
At one point I heard she asked another
actor to stand up in the crowd for

508
00:30:59,221 --> 00:31:04,080
inspiration. I'm sure everybody's ripping
her apart on the fucking Internet,

509
00:31:04,081 --> 00:31:07,980
but Jesus Christ just
go up and say thank you.

510
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:09,310
Okay,

511
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:11,230
I'm site.
This is great.

512
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:15,640
I'm gonna make way more money
now because I have one of these

513
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:19,470
women who are completely out of my league.

514
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:22,260
Might actually do a little double
take when I walked down the street.

515
00:31:22,261 --> 00:31:23,370
Thank you so much.

516
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:27,060
I'm going to hold this thing under my
Chin like I'm telling a ghost story.

517
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:30,540
So the gold is reflected off my face.

518
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:36,290
Thank you everybody right
in the shit that I said.

519
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:39,920
Thank you for editing and thankfully
make me look good. I go fuck yourself.

520
00:31:39,921 --> 00:31:43,160
What's up to the band and you're out.
How fucking difficult is that?

521
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,100
I'm not saying you won't be nervous.

522
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:51,260
I don't fucking know a guy. I
can't believe it. I can't believe

523
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:56,010
you know like you will.
I had a fucking Chinese restaurant,

524
00:31:56,011 --> 00:32:00,270
a bunch of balloons came down from
the ceiling. Okay. I just had no idea.

525
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:02,730
Really.
You just walk around dressed like that.

526
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,160
You didn't notice the other
celebrities in the room?

527
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:07,510
Yeah.

528
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:10,150
Why do you have to pretend
you're not fucking site?

529
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:12,780
Yeah.

530
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:15,320
Anyways.
Um,

531
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:18,120
that's why I love when Cuba Gooding them,

532
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:23,150
won the Oscar and he started running
around like some fucking soccer mom that

533
00:32:24,751 --> 00:32:28,800
just want to know when a new or whatever
the fuck they drive was minivans or the

534
00:32:28,801 --> 00:32:30,840
publisher's clearing house
just showed up at his house.

535
00:32:30,841 --> 00:32:32,040
That's what the fuck you should do.

536
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,313
Right.

537
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:38,630
Map gives a fuck. Anyways. You,
you watch how I handle it at the,

538
00:32:38,631 --> 00:32:40,040
at the awards.

539
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:49,400
Did they, I think they have those
have those when it's time to change.

540
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,770
Um,
they actually have podcasting awards.

541
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:56,690
They should have you accept
him like fucking a over Skype.

542
00:32:58,430 --> 00:33:01,790
You know, you shouldn't be in
a, in the flesh. Should you?

543
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:07,340
Shouldn't we just be voices? Um,
all right, let's plow ahead here.

544
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:08,890
Okay.

545
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:12,780
Golden Globes. What did I want
to talk about here? Oh yeah.

546
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:14,190
I started doing yoga this year.

547
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:18,490
I'm thinking of a nice long pause here
as I wait for every guy who's listening

548
00:33:18,491 --> 00:33:20,380
to this to say a couple
of homophobic things.

549
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,333
MMM.

550
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:26,950
And I bought these great stretchy pants
that I wear and a half shirt, you know,

551
00:33:26,951 --> 00:33:28,990
cause you really want to be like,
don't judge me,

552
00:33:28,991 --> 00:33:32,710
but you really just want to like,
you don't want to feel like

553
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:34,823
mmm.

554
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:38,530
You don't have like loose clothing on,
you know,

555
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:43,330
you want to feel like you're being held.
Sorry,

556
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:47,290
I'm just trying to put a disgusting image
in your head of me with yoga pants and

557
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:50,230
a half shirt. Yeah. Think
about that. You know

558
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,820
my pasty white belly
muffin top hanging over.

559
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:02,290
All right. So of course I can't just
do a little bit of Yoga and get my,

560
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:03,190
you know,

561
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:07,090
stretch out my fucking spine after
all these hours I spent on airplanes.

562
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,970
My fucking,
you know,

563
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:15,130
all in nothing stupid
attitude in life is I go from,

564
00:34:15,131 --> 00:34:17,770
I'm going to start doing yoga again this
year cause I haven't done it like three

565
00:34:17,771 --> 00:34:18,604
fucking years.

566
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:20,303
MMM.

567
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:23,810
I immediately just go from,
I'm going to start doing yoga too.

568
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:26,630
I'm going to do 150
hours of yoga this year,

569
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:29,630
which translates to three hours a year,

570
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:33,150
which translates to me also going what
about years a week from them on the road

571
00:34:33,151 --> 00:34:34,130
and I one of a chance to,

572
00:34:34,131 --> 00:34:36,590
I need to build up extra time
so I can stay ahead of it.

573
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:41,510
You know like one of those Scifi movies
where you need that energy life force on

574
00:34:41,511 --> 00:34:43,220
your fucking bracelet.
Right?

575
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:47,780
I'm trying to get extra extra guys like
you'd, you're playing like a video game.

576
00:34:47,781 --> 00:34:49,670
So of course I go too far and I fucking,

577
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:52,730
I think I slightly hyper
extended my God damn knee.

578
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:58,730
What an asshole. I do this all the
time. If I'm gonna start playing drums,

579
00:34:58,731 --> 00:35:01,970
I played drums too much in a part
in my fucking shoulder on my hand.

580
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:05,960
I don't know.
I don't want my fucking problem is,

581
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:09,230
I think that's why I succeeded as a
comedian because there's no way to like

582
00:35:09,231 --> 00:35:13,070
physically hurt yourself as a standup
comic. You just standing there talking,

583
00:35:13,071 --> 00:35:13,820
right?

584
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:16,790
I guess you could ask something out so
much that you accidentally throw yourself

585
00:35:16,791 --> 00:35:19,760
off the stage, but you could still
come up and do it the next show, right?

586
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:26,030
I Dunno. Anyways, so yeah,

587
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:29,870
I'm too old to lift.
I'll lift a little bit,

588
00:35:29,871 --> 00:35:33,710
but what happens is you just still eating
light shit. Then you just get that.

589
00:35:33,711 --> 00:35:38,190
I'm still lifting middle aged
body. We were, we have a shirt on.

590
00:35:38,191 --> 00:35:40,710
You can kind of see that the
shoulders in this pex there,

591
00:35:40,711 --> 00:35:43,650
but like you belly still sticking out.
All right.

592
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:47,070
You know those guys and then they
always have some sort of wallet chain.

593
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:54,120
I don't want to be that guy. I really
don't want to be that guy. So anyways,

594
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:57,480
we'll see.
We'll see what happens.

595
00:35:59,110 --> 00:35:59,530
Yeah.

596
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:01,240
Oh, why do I always
fucking do that? You know,

597
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:05,380
some fucking day one I'm going to do yoga
and with within three days I'm trying

598
00:36:05,381 --> 00:36:07,150
to do like a fucking full split

599
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:13,130
and then I get hurt and then I'm just,
you know what happened?

600
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:16,330
I smoked a cigar or less than I
got to stop with this fucking shit.

601
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:18,490
You know what?
At my age.

602
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:23,850
What's really scary is I lose a drinking
buddy every week at my age at 45 they

603
00:36:24,791 --> 00:36:28,780
just dropping like flies. The
wife says, I have to cut down.

604
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:33,440
I got a fatty liver. I got a kid.
I can't fucking do it anymore.

605
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:34,820
Okay.

606
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:38,090
All right. All right. I'm gay and that's
why I was drinking all these years.

607
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,800
All of those fucking things.

608
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:41,523
You know,

609
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:47,170
this is like nobody left.
Two of my buddies,

610
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:51,880
I lost two guys this week
telling me I got to stop.

611
00:36:51,881 --> 00:36:54,490
There's something wrong with my
stomach and I got a fatty liver

612
00:36:56,620 --> 00:37:00,370
and all I'm thinking is this, how
come I'm not feeling anything? Well,

613
00:37:00,371 --> 00:37:03,190
probably because I never got
my liver checked out. You
don't feel anything right?

614
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,690
He just walked down the street one day.

615
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:06,340
Okay

616
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:10,840
with your fucking a wallflower knows man,

617
00:37:10,841 --> 00:37:13,560
my little chicken eat right and then all
of a sudden you just do a face plant.

618
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:16,060
It's over.
Is that how you die of cirrhosis?

619
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:22,640
Cyrus is cirrhosis. Scorsese.
I don't fucking know. Um,

620
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:24,330
okay.

621
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:28,830
Yeah, I got to lay off. I'm
done with fucking cigars.
I'm done with those things,

622
00:37:28,831 --> 00:37:31,460
man. Those things are, and it's
like sucking on a bus tailpipe.

623
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:34,530
It just [inaudible] inhale a great,

624
00:37:34,531 --> 00:37:39,090
so I just get fucking mouth and
throat cancer. What am I an asshole?

625
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:42,730
I got to stop this shit.

626
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:47,080
It's the hardest thing about being an
adult is you have to be your own fucking

627
00:37:47,081 --> 00:37:47,914
parent.

628
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:49,050
Yeah.

629
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:50,160
You know,
when you were a kid,

630
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,430
you know your parents were there to
stop you from eating a whole sleeve of

631
00:37:53,431 --> 00:37:55,140
cookies. You, you will.
The second you move up,

632
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:57,670
you can do whatever the fuck you want.
You can literally be doing heroin, Azure,

633
00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:01,350
written fucking cookies. And
there's nobody there to say, stop.

634
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:03,970
Okay,

635
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:08,010
fucking annoying.
I gotta lay off of it.

636
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,400
I can't do it though. I can. I just
can't seem to get, you know what it is?

637
00:38:11,401 --> 00:38:13,440
It's all these social things.
Football game's coming up,

638
00:38:13,441 --> 00:38:17,520
going to a hockey game that
starts tomorrow, starts
tomorrow, and then last night,

639
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:21,620
you know, Joey Rose's got me a
great fucking bottle of this stuff.

640
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:27,840
Fucking, I don't Japanese
Scotch. And I'm like, well,

641
00:38:27,841 --> 00:38:30,330
I got to try it.
And of course it was absolutely delicious.

642
00:38:30,331 --> 00:38:32,280
Now I've got to have a
fucking cigar with it.

643
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:36,850
I'm sitting out on my porch
with my red sox robot.

644
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:40,560
My bathrobe is also my smoking jacket.
Um,

645
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:44,050
cause I'm an environmentalist and
I'm sitting out there smoking.

646
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:51,200
There's nothing dumber than smoking
a really good cigar when you're cold.

647
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:53,181
It's another thing too.

648
00:38:53,181 --> 00:38:56,090
This is a bad time of year to smoke a
cigar cause you can't smoke anywhere

649
00:38:56,091 --> 00:38:56,481
inside.

650
00:38:56,481 --> 00:39:00,380
They smell like shit unless you're in a
cigar bar and then you're in there with

651
00:39:00,381 --> 00:39:04,160
like 50 other guys in
this, in, in, you know,

652
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,290
it just feels like you're in a walk in
closet with a car on after a while your

653
00:39:10,291 --> 00:39:11,880
eyes are burning.
I can't even do it.

654
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:15,060
You know what it reminds me of is back
in the day when people could smoke in

655
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:17,820
comedy clubs and um,

656
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,100
it was unreal. By the
time you got to, it's,

657
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:25,620
you've got to do three shows
or even two shows back then.

658
00:39:25,621 --> 00:39:28,710
Cause everybody had seemed
smoked back then they would,

659
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:33,620
there'd be like a cloud of smoke,
you know,

660
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:33,920
by.

661
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,750
But at the beginning of the second show
because it was still left over from the

662
00:39:36,751 --> 00:39:37,584
first show.

663
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:43,260
And I just remember like my eyes would
be burning when I got off stage and the

664
00:39:43,261 --> 00:39:47,130
second show I'd have to go to the bathroom
and like flush him out with water and

665
00:39:47,131 --> 00:39:50,980
then I go home
and I actually learned,

666
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:53,330
uh,

667
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:58,330
to take a shower the night before you
went to bed because I always remember the

668
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,780
next morning I would wake up and I take
a shower in the water came over my head.

669
00:40:02,781 --> 00:40:06,950
I would just smell the smoke like
someone was smoking next to me.

670
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:10,040
So I imagine even that,
how bad smoking is,

671
00:40:10,041 --> 00:40:14,570
I can even imagine that being around a
bunch of people who were smoking and then

672
00:40:14,571 --> 00:40:18,680
laying in bed with this smoke in your
clothes and in your hair is somehow

673
00:40:18,681 --> 00:40:23,400
affecting your health. It's just
bad. I am giving away my cigars. I'm,

674
00:40:23,401 --> 00:40:26,720
I'm fucking, I can't say I'm
done, done with them, but I'm,

675
00:40:26,721 --> 00:40:27,770
I'm pretty much done with them.

676
00:40:27,771 --> 00:40:30,860
What I'm going to do is when I go to
other countries, I'll smoke a Cuban cigar.

677
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:33,950
That's what I'll do. And
then I'm not bringing a bunch
back because then he'd go,

678
00:40:33,951 --> 00:40:37,310
oh fuck, I got to smoke these,
these are Cubans. I don't
want them to go bad. Right?

679
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:40,460
And then you don't have a humor door cause
you don't want to get sucked into the

680
00:40:40,461 --> 00:40:43,670
habit. And then what happens is
you fucking cigars are going bad.

681
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:46,920
It's a nightmare.
Um,

682
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:53,090
I'm going to get a bunch of texts
first world problem. No, it hasn't.

683
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:57,650
Cuban cigars are made in a third
world country, so go fuck yourself.

684
00:40:58,610 --> 00:41:00,470
Isn't that,
is that considered a third world country?

685
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:05,420
What is exactly a third world country?
A country that were oppressing?

686
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:07,370
Is that what makes them Third World?

687
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:08,780
Okay.

688
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:12,660
It isn't just South America,
isn't it? Oh Christ.

689
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:15,570
Now I gotta look it up and there's a
bunch of people laughing at me right now.

690
00:41:15,571 --> 00:41:19,020
But if I actually asked you to give
me a fucking intelligent definition,

691
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:23,320
you couldn't.
Third World countries.

692
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:24,980
Yeah.

693
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,390
Wait,
third world definition.

694
00:41:26,391 --> 00:41:31,391
Let's go with that first dude
to do two to two to third world.

695
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:38,050
Okay? According to Wikipedia, term,

696
00:41:38,051 --> 00:41:43,051
third world arose during the Cold War
to define countries that remained non

697
00:41:43,351 --> 00:41:46,150
aligned with either NATO,

698
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:48,880
with the United States or western Europe,

699
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:53,290
western European nations and their allies
representing the first world or the

700
00:41:53,291 --> 00:41:57,220
communist bloc. And that would
be what? The Soviet Union,

701
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:59,830
the People's Republic of China. Oh, Cuba.

702
00:41:59,831 --> 00:42:02,920
So Cuba is not third world cause they
aligned themselves with the Soviet Union

703
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,700
and their allies representing
the Second World War.

704
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:09,050
Yeah.

705
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:12,830
So I'm guessing that we came up with it
because we're the first, first world.

706
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:14,510
We're number one.

707
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:20,180
All the commies are ranked number
two and then a distant third.

708
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:25,760
You know the key. Oh, so based Mexico,

709
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:27,980
according to this chart,

710
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:32,980
fall of Central America all
the way down to South America.

711
00:42:32,981 --> 00:42:37,620
Except there's one in South America
that isn't.

712
00:42:37,621 --> 00:42:41,100
What the fuck is that? I don't know
what that is, is just north of Brazil.

713
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:46,460
Oh, does that Burns and Allen, what's the
name of that fucking country down there?

714
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:52,190
Cakes and biscuits. I don't
know. Fucking it up. Um,

715
00:42:54,350 --> 00:42:57,560
let's let you know and I think it's time
mercifully for the questions this week.

716
00:42:57,590 --> 00:43:00,200
What do you say everybody,
what do you say? You Ready?

717
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:04,100
You ready for the questions for this week?
I, God knows I am. Oh, really? Quickly.

718
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,750
I didn't even get a
chance to talk about it.

719
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:09,530
Do you guys do watch that 60 minutes
thing last night of that fucking jerk off?

720
00:43:09,531 --> 00:43:12,230
He's ratting out Alex Rodriguez,

721
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:16,100
the Henry Hill of that think.
All right.

722
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,640
I'm pulling up Paul Versey, the
dude I call it, I called it.

723
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:23,990
We're all going to be on
Roids by the end of our lives.

724
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:27,900
Okay.
And I'm going to tell you why.

725
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:31,050
Because the same reason why you
saw that sexy scare squirrels,

726
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:33,180
scarecrow walking into the fucking stage.

727
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:37,320
The same reason why they got all these
diet pills and all this fucking grow your

728
00:43:37,321 --> 00:43:40,230
hair back shit. Because no one
wants to be old and decrepit.

729
00:43:41,310 --> 00:43:41,590
Okay?

730
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:43,300
All right.
They're already given the shit out.

731
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:46,720
That's synergetics is fucking
HGH as far as I can tell.

732
00:43:47,770 --> 00:43:48,070
Okay.

733
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:50,500
Um,
which is basically I researched,

734
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:54,700
I said synergetics uh,
scandal.

735
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:58,970
That's what I searched. So of course
negative shit came up about them. Um,

736
00:43:59,050 --> 00:43:59,890
we're all going to be on it.

737
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,370
It's the same way w marijuana
is gradually becoming legal.

738
00:44:03,371 --> 00:44:08,200
That's what's going to happen with,
with, with steroids. Guaran fucking tee.

739
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:14,170
You know what's the coolest part of the
story was they said a rod texted this

740
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:18,710
Guy Tony, whatever the fuck his name
was, and Joe [inaudible]. He said, hey,

741
00:44:18,711 --> 00:44:22,710
I got a big day tomorrow. What do
you got? So we gave him the stuff.

742
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:25,720
The next day you would
have like two doubles and a
single or something like that

743
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,730
and the 60 minute guy goes,
Ooh,

744
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:33,210
what did you think after you sent him
your products and saw the results?

745
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:38,670
And he was going like,
he basically said

746
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:42,660
that, yeah, we, we got the formula down.

747
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:46,660
You held the formula down and
he goes, yeah. It was like,

748
00:44:46,661 --> 00:44:48,100
it was like shooting fish in a barrel.

749
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:52,690
So these guys are so
advanced in this illegal shit

750
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:57,980
that I'm telling you, they're going to
get it to the point where it just like we,

751
00:44:57,981 --> 00:45:00,310
where you can smoke it through like
a breathalyzer. We're all it is,

752
00:45:00,311 --> 00:45:04,450
is just basically the mist of THC.

753
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:06,490
Whatever the fuck that
stuff is that gets you high,

754
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,440
they're going to get that with what?
Steroids.

755
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:10,230
Okay.

756
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:10,621
All right.

757
00:45:10,621 --> 00:45:14,400
And you're going to be 80
years old walking around
feeling like you can put your

758
00:45:14,401 --> 00:45:16,500
fucking fist through the Goddamn wall.

759
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:17,840
Okay.

760
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:21,860
It's going to be great.
All right. And all of this,

761
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:26,120
this witch hunt on these a rod guys and
all these guys went to jail and all that

762
00:45:26,121 --> 00:45:28,070
type of shit that people are going
to look back and be like, well,

763
00:45:28,071 --> 00:45:31,850
what was the problem?
That's, that's my prediction.

764
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:33,520
Yeah.

765
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:37,960
Provided an asteroid doesn't hit
his first. Um, oh, by the way,

766
00:45:37,961 --> 00:45:40,680
I retweeted something that
somebody sent me about, uh,

767
00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:46,870
the Denver International Airport.
You know,

768
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:51,760
that there's basically a, that they
started to build it and then they said,

769
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:53,380
well, the structure is
wrong. And then they,

770
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,140
rather than destroying what they built,
they buried it.

771
00:45:56,590 --> 00:45:58,360
And then they built the
airport on top of it.

772
00:45:58,361 --> 00:46:01,450
So all the conspiracy
theorists just saying this is
a bunker for all the fucking

773
00:46:01,451 --> 00:46:04,840
people who are going to just survive a
nuclear holocaust or an economic meltdown.

774
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:10,090
And there are a bunch of weird
paintings on the, on the walls.

775
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,480
But if you really look at them
objectively, it kind of looks more,

776
00:46:13,481 --> 00:46:16,360
it's more about world peace,
oppression.

777
00:46:16,361 --> 00:46:20,470
And then the children of the next
generation coming along and oppressing the

778
00:46:20,471 --> 00:46:24,070
oppressors are stomping them out. And
then there's no war, no more weapons.

779
00:46:24,071 --> 00:46:28,810
You can look at it in a sunshiny way
or you can look at it in a creepy way.

780
00:46:28,811 --> 00:46:33,440
And I got to admit a lot of the, the
at work is a pretty creepy. I was,

781
00:46:33,441 --> 00:46:37,680
I'll send you guys a link to
that shit. But it's a pretty
interesting, uh, I don't,

782
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:41,320
I love conspiracy theory because I know,
you know,

783
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:43,930
I know how much I lie.

784
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:52,120
So why would they be so I love the
speculation. All right, here we go. Let's,

785
00:46:52,121 --> 00:46:56,890
let me shut the fucking get on with the,
uh, the questions for the week. All right.

786
00:46:56,891 --> 00:47:01,750
This one says ponies dot, dot,
dot. I'm a retard t. Why builtin?

787
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:07,120
Yeah, I'm a colts fan. Um, I guess that's
a reference to some guy who plays on the,

788
00:47:07,121 --> 00:47:11,350
uh, on the fucking cults. I don't know.
I don't know anybody's name anymore.

789
00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:14,230
I don't know who shot. I
don't really do that. He goes,

790
00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:16,630
I'm listening to the eight 26,

791
00:47:16,631 --> 00:47:21,460
13 podcasts where you talk about the
difference between a pony and a horse. Oh,

792
00:47:21,461 --> 00:47:22,960
it was making fun of the fact that I,
I,

793
00:47:22,990 --> 00:47:25,570
for until I was like in my early twenties,

794
00:47:25,571 --> 00:47:28,480
I didn't realize that a pony is
a pony in a horse is a horse.

795
00:47:28,481 --> 00:47:31,930
I thought a pony was a small horse and
the people down the street had a pony.

796
00:47:31,930 --> 00:47:35,350
My whole childhood tied to the back of
their fucking house. It's kind of cruel.

797
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:39,460
But, uh, I remember driving by and
finally when I was like 19, 20 years old,

798
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,890
my mother was driving and I was just like,

799
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:44,510
what does that pony going
to turn into a horse? And,

800
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:49,510
and if I could just go back and listen
to the October 26 podcast the last year,

801
00:47:49,511 --> 00:47:50,440
I explain it way better.

802
00:47:50,441 --> 00:47:54,670
The fucking look my mother gave me
before she started laughing at me. Um,

803
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:59,590
I still see it on her face every time when
I come home for Thanksgiving. Anyways,

804
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:00,640
I'm 23 years old.

805
00:48:00,641 --> 00:48:04,690
He said 23 year old American
English was my first language.

806
00:48:04,691 --> 00:48:08,110
I have my bachelor's degree.
I am going to law school in August.

807
00:48:08,111 --> 00:48:10,810
I scored higher on the
law school admission test,

808
00:48:10,811 --> 00:48:15,520
the 97 [inaudible] 97%
of potential lawyers.

809
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:20,170
And I just had to look on Wikipedia to
find out that ponies are indeed not young

810
00:48:20,171 --> 00:48:24,700
horses. I am ashamed of
myself. Go Fuck Yourself.

811
00:48:24,730 --> 00:48:27,080
At least I can read out loud. Hey, yeah,

812
00:48:27,090 --> 00:48:29,710
the chalk you look at least
you can read out loud, dude,

813
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:31,780
you did all that other stuff.
I can't do that.

814
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:35,710
You've got to take me out because you're
all so fucking stupid. Anyways, he goes,

815
00:48:35,711 --> 00:48:39,730
thanks for the free labs. Your
Colorado Springs show was amazing. Uh,

816
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:44,650
go Andrew Luck. Well, he's going
to the golf course there, buddy.

817
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:47,470
Um, yeah, for all you people out there,

818
00:48:47,471 --> 00:48:51,640
pony is a pony and a horse is a horse.

819
00:48:52,450 --> 00:48:57,370
I guess I was a small horses. A
cult. Is that what you'd call it?

820
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:01,840
You know what's amazing is that I don't
know what it is and I never take the

821
00:49:01,841 --> 00:49:05,650
time to look it up. So I always sound
dumb in this conversation. Okay.

822
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:10,000
Advice on men. Hey,
bumbling. Billy Bul. Uh,

823
00:49:10,001 --> 00:49:14,720
I'll keep the questions short to rescue
you from the English language, but up, up,

824
00:49:14,721 --> 00:49:18,340
up, up, when I get it, I
suck at reading out loud.

825
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:23,860
He goes, I'm a 20. Oh, she says,
oh my God, this is from a Olay.

826
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:28,940
Uh, I finally get a female
to write in and I trashed,

827
00:49:28,941 --> 00:49:32,960
you're right out of the gate.
I'm sorry sweetheart. She says,

828
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:38,420
I'm a 24 year old girl and I'd like
to know your best piece of advice of

829
00:49:39,201 --> 00:49:43,910
understanding the human male species.
Many thanks. But at the same time,

830
00:49:43,911 --> 00:49:47,300
go fuck yourself while I'm sorry.
You gotta be a little more specific.

831
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:53,090
Um, I'll give you a,
basically, generally speaking,

832
00:49:53,150 --> 00:49:57,460
um, oh, Jesus Christ.

833
00:49:57,470 --> 00:50:00,260
What do you want to know? I
would basically, you know,

834
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:04,630
you want to learn how to
communicate with them better. Um,

835
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:08,290
yeah, so you're doing the right
thing. You're asking another part.

836
00:50:08,291 --> 00:50:09,610
This is actually a very smart question.

837
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:15,380
Rather than sitting around with your
female friends just going, I know, right?

838
00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:19,960
What if,
what if that God,

839
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:21,980
yeah.

840
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:24,920
You sit there to fucking wine bar whining.

841
00:50:26,810 --> 00:50:31,490
This what you do.
You go cross enemy lines and yes,

842
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:36,070
you know, a trader like me to
read from the playbook. All right,

843
00:50:36,071 --> 00:50:40,720
how guys communicate.
I can't say that.

844
00:50:40,721 --> 00:50:45,220
We just say what we're thinking because
we have liars and passive aggressive

845
00:50:45,221 --> 00:50:49,210
people and a meandering little man boys.

846
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:53,560
But generally speaking, uh, the
thing that confuses us the most,

847
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:56,800
I did a bit, I can't remember
if I did it on a special, but

848
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:58,640
yeah.

849
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:03,530
One time I was driving
with Nia and I said,

850
00:51:03,531 --> 00:51:06,410
hey, I want to get a chocolate
shake. We're going by this diner,

851
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:09,410
and she freaks out. She's like, oh my
God, they make the best chocolate shakes.

852
00:51:09,411 --> 00:51:12,390
And I go, I know, right? She
goes, yeah. She just goes,
oh my God, that, that, that,

853
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:16,610
that they're so big.
She just kept saying this so big.

854
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:21,720
After a while I'm thinking
like, yeah, like fuck,

855
00:51:21,721 --> 00:51:23,310
how the fuck am I going
to drink this whole thing?

856
00:51:23,970 --> 00:51:25,350
And then immediately just clicked on me.

857
00:51:25,351 --> 00:51:29,490
Like it's like they're not big
this standard size. Wait a minute,

858
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:33,450
she wants half of my shake,
but she doesn't want to seem selfish,

859
00:51:33,870 --> 00:51:37,060
but she doesn't want all the
calories of the full shake Sarah.

860
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:40,920
But she doesn't want to look like
she's taken away 50% of my good time.

861
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:45,440
So rather than telling me that she's
trying to mind fuck mean to thinking

862
00:51:45,441 --> 00:51:48,830
something that I drank a zillion
times with ease is now too big.

863
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:54,380
You know what I mean?
So that's how you guys communicate.

864
00:51:56,090 --> 00:51:56,650
Okay.

865
00:51:56,650 --> 00:52:00,400
I don't know how we communicate because
I can't just sit there and make it seem

866
00:52:00,401 --> 00:52:02,970
like guys were heroes and that
where they would be like, listen,

867
00:52:02,971 --> 00:52:06,760
I'm trying to lose weight, so,
uh, can I have half your shake?

868
00:52:07,970 --> 00:52:08,803
MMM.

869
00:52:10,010 --> 00:52:12,440
The only thing I can tell you
is you're 24 years old. Uh, it,

870
00:52:12,441 --> 00:52:15,320
you shouldn't understand them.
You shouldn't understand guys,

871
00:52:15,321 --> 00:52:19,160
but it's hard for me to,
I don't know what you're asking.

872
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:24,320
Please write back. Please write back
advice on men park to just do that again.

873
00:52:24,321 --> 00:52:28,310
Just fucking write back asked me something
more specific and I can help you out.

874
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:33,311
But it's great that a 24 year actually
smart enough to ask guys to explain.

875
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:39,230
Um, ah, let's see. Best piece of
advice. I use a great piece of advice.

876
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:42,200
Learn how to cook.
All right?

877
00:52:42,201 --> 00:52:46,020
It's stereotypical is that fucking sounds,
I don't mean it in the,

878
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:48,200
as this in a sexist fucking way.

879
00:52:49,450 --> 00:52:52,090
All right.
I don't,

880
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:58,220
don't be a slob and learn how to cook
would put you ahead of 80% of fucking

881
00:52:59,071 --> 00:53:01,350
women out there because for some reason,

882
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:06,800
somewhere along Edith Wharton over that
chicken showed the flag making a guy his

883
00:53:07,231 --> 00:53:12,231
sandwich became this absolutely
degrading fucking thing to do.

884
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:18,210
Yet guys still have to hold the doors and,
and fucking buy drinks.

885
00:53:18,211 --> 00:53:20,340
Like why we don't find that sexist,

886
00:53:20,341 --> 00:53:22,440
reverse sexist or whatever
the fuck you call it.

887
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:26,940
I remember one time I was downstairs,
don't know what the fuck I was doing.

888
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:29,310
I was doing some pain in the ass job.

889
00:53:29,311 --> 00:53:33,320
I was cleaning out something
in the garage and without,

890
00:53:34,270 --> 00:53:34,710
yeah,

891
00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:36,450
me asking or anything.

892
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:40,410
Nia came downstairs with
this unbelievable sandwich.

893
00:53:40,411 --> 00:53:43,560
She had made pickles toothpick in it.

894
00:53:43,561 --> 00:53:45,480
The whole fucking nine yards.

895
00:53:46,550 --> 00:53:47,040
Yeah.

896
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:50,310
And she brought like a something
to drink downstairs too.

897
00:53:52,330 --> 00:53:53,980
And I stopped working. I sat down, ate.

898
00:53:54,010 --> 00:53:57,940
It was one of the greatest
moments of our relationship.

899
00:53:58,830 --> 00:54:01,810
All right, so that's some advice I
would give you is guys have a very,

900
00:54:01,811 --> 00:54:04,060
we're very simple and by simple,

901
00:54:04,061 --> 00:54:06,790
I don't mean stupid before you
get on your fucking high horse,

902
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:08,560
okay?

903
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:12,140
It's like an old school engine. You open
the hood and everything's right there.

904
00:54:15,950 --> 00:54:20,060
Real wheel drive. It's not turned to
the side jammed into the compartment.

905
00:54:20,210 --> 00:54:22,540
None of that bullshit.
It's just fucking basic.

906
00:54:24,050 --> 00:54:26,930
You just do that every
once in a fucking while.

907
00:54:27,710 --> 00:54:31,790
Guys will think I have a keeper and
all you're doing is making a fucking

908
00:54:31,791 --> 00:54:36,140
sandwich. And that doesn't mean that
you shouldn't have the right to vote.

909
00:54:36,170 --> 00:54:38,660
It's fucking unreal. Cook it. And
then you don't even cook and all,

910
00:54:38,661 --> 00:54:40,490
you know when he's just
slapping shit together,

911
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:44,720
you build in a little fucking food house.
How difficult is that?

912
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:46,180
Okay,

913
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:49,450
that's what I don't understand. Like I
guess I kind of understand it, but like

914
00:54:51,610 --> 00:54:55,010
cooking a meal for somebody is one of
the greatest things you could ever do for

915
00:54:55,011 --> 00:54:59,900
them. All right, I'll leave it at that.
So I would say something simple like that.

916
00:55:03,090 --> 00:55:07,800
This is how simple guys are.
If you actually, every once
in a while just said, hey,

917
00:55:07,801 --> 00:55:08,760
do you want to bear?

918
00:55:08,850 --> 00:55:12,720
And you actually got up and went to the
fridge and got a beer and brought it

919
00:55:12,721 --> 00:55:16,860
over, put it in a fucking
frosted mug. I mean,

920
00:55:16,861 --> 00:55:17,760
personally speaking,

921
00:55:17,790 --> 00:55:22,650
I'm ready to go paint the house
cause that little move there,

922
00:55:22,830 --> 00:55:27,000
I feel like a fucking king.
That's all it takes.

923
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:29,460
That's all it takes.
Very simple.

924
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:31,390
Okay.

925
00:55:31,390 --> 00:55:35,120
You know, let them head out
with his friends once a week.

926
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:40,370
If they come over and they watched the
game and you're not into the game, leave.

927
00:55:41,470 --> 00:55:41,720
Okay,

928
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:44,690
go in the other room or
be a good shit and hang,

929
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:51,300
but don't ruin as good fucking
time. Jesus, I'm on a roll here now

930
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:53,533
is another one.

931
00:55:55,070 --> 00:55:59,060
Uh, try to limit the amount of horrific
shit you're going to drag him to.

932
00:55:59,450 --> 00:56:01,910
Now he's,
he's obligated to goes to some of it,

933
00:56:01,911 --> 00:56:04,940
but he has to have just set
it up and just say, listen,

934
00:56:05,930 --> 00:56:10,100
there's a bunch of shit that you do
that I'm not going to begin to write.

935
00:56:10,101 --> 00:56:13,460
Like tailgating on a golf course
peeing in a Porta potty before,

936
00:56:13,461 --> 00:56:15,770
before a football game that
you don't give a shit about.

937
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:20,060
I don't want to be there for that. So
I get to tap out of that. All right.

938
00:56:20,330 --> 00:56:25,260
And then the guy he gets to
tap out of like, I dunno,

939
00:56:25,330 --> 00:56:28,990
like what have I tapped out on one time
a Nia wanted to take me to somebody's

940
00:56:28,991 --> 00:56:31,420
birthday party. They were
having some fucking, you know,

941
00:56:31,450 --> 00:56:35,230
we're all gonna dress like it's the gold
rush or the fucking prohibition era.

942
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:36,880
It's like,
I don't want to fucking do that.

943
00:56:38,050 --> 00:56:40,150
She gave me shit and I was just
saying I don't want to do it.

944
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:41,900
And she let me out of it
and we laughed about it.

945
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:46,540
I actually went there without a costume.
I mean I made a deal. We made it,

946
00:56:46,541 --> 00:56:51,470
we made a, we made a deal. I think I told
this story, I'm fucking punch drunk. Yeah.

947
00:56:51,471 --> 00:56:52,990
I never know what the
fuck I'm talking about.

948
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:55,300
I showed up and I didn't wear a costume,

949
00:56:55,301 --> 00:56:58,570
which was hilarious cause every other guy
was fucking dress like Charlie Chaplin.

950
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:02,860
And I show up in street clothes and
they're looking at me like I'm a magician.

951
00:57:03,850 --> 00:57:05,380
And then I left early cause that's right.

952
00:57:05,381 --> 00:57:07,720
Cause I would have watched the Celtics
were playing the Lakers in the finals

953
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:08,670
that year when we beat him.

954
00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:13,020
And I would have missed it if nia
wasn't so fucking cool. So that's,

955
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:15,730
that's what I would do.
And if you actually do shit like that,

956
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:19,053
you know,

957
00:57:20,810 --> 00:57:25,810
you put yourself on this solid
ground with the guy that you're with,

958
00:57:26,091 --> 00:57:26,924
we're now,

959
00:57:28,790 --> 00:57:32,210
there's no reason for him to be an
asshole to you or be mean to you because

960
00:57:32,211 --> 00:57:34,590
you've been so nice to him.
It really kind of works that way.

961
00:57:34,591 --> 00:57:35,720
It kind of feeds off each other.

962
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:39,710
That's the best I can do
without a specific question.
All right, so there you go.

963
00:57:40,130 --> 00:57:42,530
And you know, fuck everybody.
Who's going to say that?

964
00:57:42,531 --> 00:57:45,020
You know what I just said was
sexist. You know, go fuck yourself.

965
00:57:45,021 --> 00:57:47,390
I don't think it's,
you know,

966
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:50,220
you're on a date with your woman.

967
00:57:50,221 --> 00:57:54,120
You go and you open the car door for you
still do that shit. If I can do that,

968
00:57:54,121 --> 00:57:56,610
he can go get me a fucking
beer. Christ. It's a twist off.

969
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:01,500
What are you gonna hurt your wrist?
Yeah.

970
00:58:01,501 --> 00:58:04,740
You know something that that would be
my advice. Stop acting like a kicker.

971
00:58:08,630 --> 00:58:10,350
You know what?
We're just fucking annoys me.

972
00:58:10,590 --> 00:58:13,660
That every time a kicker makes a
tackle, he gets hurt. I just fucking,

973
00:58:13,770 --> 00:58:17,790
I just don't understand
that Jesus fucking Christ.

974
00:58:17,791 --> 00:58:21,360
Put some cream on it and get back out
there and fucking throw your feet around.

975
00:58:22,090 --> 00:58:26,820
All right. College
Room. Uh, Billy Vanilli.

976
00:58:27,330 --> 00:58:32,160
I liked that one as a new one. Uh,
can't wait to see you in Hamilton,

977
00:58:32,161 --> 00:58:36,970
Ontario. I'm a 21 year old college
student who, oh, by the way, I'm,

978
00:58:36,990 --> 00:58:38,550
I'm hopefully going to have the,
uh,

979
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:42,270
the links to those dates
in the next week or so.

980
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,190
Everybody asks you about all the,
my,

981
00:58:44,210 --> 00:58:48,840
my big Canadian tour in much anyways,
this person says,

982
00:58:48,841 --> 00:58:50,790
can't wait to see you in Hamilton,
Ontario.

983
00:58:50,791 --> 00:58:55,470
I'm a 21 year old college student who
has been having to deal with rumors.

984
00:58:56,850 --> 00:59:00,630
Um, I was a resident on
dawn a couple months back,

985
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:05,340
which means I was responsible for
watching over first year students in their

986
00:59:05,341 --> 00:59:07,230
dorms during Halloween.

987
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:10,860
I did hook up with one of
the first years at a party.

988
00:59:10,861 --> 00:59:13,320
I was at word somehow spread,

989
00:59:13,410 --> 00:59:18,410
but through classic broken telephone
that I got a drunk and banged her in the

990
00:59:19,231 --> 00:59:22,310
elevator of her dorm,
uh,

991
00:59:24,230 --> 00:59:28,970
consistently when I am at any,
I think you meant to say consequently,

992
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:32,630
what am at any social gathering party?

993
00:59:32,631 --> 00:59:35,030
Kegger when I tell a girl my name,

994
00:59:35,031 --> 00:59:38,570
they immediately walk away as
if I'm some monster. Oh No.

995
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:42,200
I'm thinking of transferring school
as a fair share of the campus.

996
00:59:42,201 --> 00:59:44,390
Thinks I'm that creepy guy around girls.

997
00:59:44,690 --> 00:59:48,710
Any advice on addressing this room are
with girls to stop them from running for

998
00:59:48,711 --> 00:59:52,380
the hills would be greatly appreciated.
Um,

999
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:59,580
I don't know. Dude. Did you
do it if you didn't do it?

1000
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:05,650
I don't know. If you didn't
do it, I would talk to the,

1001
01:00:05,830 --> 01:00:07,930
to the woman that you hooked
up with. Can you say, listen,

1002
01:00:07,931 --> 01:00:12,070
can you please tell people that I didn't
get your drunk, that that didn't happen?

1003
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:17,940
Um, I don't, I don't know.
Well, I mean I don't,

1004
01:00:17,941 --> 01:00:20,670
I don't know if people are mature
enough once it gets out like that.

1005
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:24,150
Maybe she's embarrassed that
she hooked up with an older guy.

1006
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:28,230
I have no fucking idea.
MMM.

1007
01:00:29,580 --> 01:00:31,690
I Dunno.
I Dunno.

1008
01:00:31,770 --> 01:00:34,600
I don't like those creepy sex ones
because now I'm going to have to do this.

1009
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:36,670
I have to assume that you are innocent.

1010
01:00:38,210 --> 01:00:38,700
Yeah.

1011
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:40,410
Who would get a somewhat look,
I gotta tell you this.

1012
01:00:40,411 --> 01:00:43,530
Who would get somebody drunk and then
fuck them in a public place like that.

1013
01:00:43,531 --> 01:00:44,810
If you're doing something under handled,

1014
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:47,690
like that story doesn't even make
sense unless you wanted to get caught.

1015
01:00:49,510 --> 01:00:50,200
Okay.

1016
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:51,070
Ah,
whatever.

1017
01:00:52,270 --> 01:00:52,810
Okay.

1018
01:00:52,810 --> 01:00:54,230
I don't, I, you know, I
don't know how to get you,

1019
01:00:54,310 --> 01:00:57,100
it's once you get accused
of sexually weird shit,

1020
01:00:57,101 --> 01:01:01,930
you kind of do have to leave I guess.
But then they win.

1021
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:04,650
Yeah.

1022
01:01:04,650 --> 01:01:07,830
I don't know. Dude. That sucks. I really
hope that, you know, if you are innocent,

1023
01:01:07,890 --> 01:01:10,610
I really hope that uh,
you can somehow get out of that.

1024
01:01:10,611 --> 01:01:13,140
Cause that's that fucking thing
where I always felt like, you know,

1025
01:01:13,141 --> 01:01:15,300
somebody gets accused of
some sort of sex crime.

1026
01:01:15,301 --> 01:01:18,210
Like I don't think that they should
just put their name in the fucking paper

1027
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:20,700
until they're there.
They're convicted.

1028
01:01:21,750 --> 01:01:22,340
Yeah.

1029
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:24,470
It's even, and everybody in your
world is gonna know about it.

1030
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:26,670
Yeah.

1031
01:01:26,670 --> 01:01:31,170
And, uh, if you didn't do it once,
you're just accused of it. You get done,

1032
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:35,640
you're done. It's fucking over. I don't,
I don't mean not in back of the day.

1033
01:01:35,641 --> 01:01:39,850
At least you could, you could go
a couple of states over, you know,

1034
01:01:39,851 --> 01:01:43,600
change your name to fucking Tj or some
shit and fucking start a new life.

1035
01:01:43,601 --> 01:01:45,580
You can't do it.
Now I have the social media,

1036
01:01:45,581 --> 01:01:49,180
the Internet and everything
just follows you around. Um,

1037
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:51,030
okay.

1038
01:01:51,030 --> 01:01:53,370
You know what? I was doing it,
I would stop going to parties.

1039
01:01:54,390 --> 01:01:56,430
I would get sober and I would just say,
you know,

1040
01:01:57,850 --> 01:01:58,683
yeah.

1041
01:01:58,710 --> 01:02:02,730
Just and I, I would, I don't
know, stone sober, meet a
nice girl and just say, yeah,

1042
01:02:02,731 --> 01:02:03,061
I mean,

1043
01:02:03,061 --> 01:02:06,310
I hooked up with this girl
and then somebody started
this fucking rumor and yeah,

1044
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:07,510
okay,

1045
01:02:07,510 --> 01:02:11,510
I'm done with it. I don't want to do
this shit anymore. I don't got to,

1046
01:02:11,511 --> 01:02:13,900
I don't know how to, I honestly, I don't
know how to get out of that. Jesus,

1047
01:02:13,901 --> 01:02:15,460
he's a fucking hard questions this week.

1048
01:02:17,190 --> 01:02:17,830
Okay.

1049
01:02:17,830 --> 01:02:21,120
I don't, fuck, I don't, I
just, if you transfer, you're
admitting that you're wrong.

1050
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:23,860
Okay.

1051
01:02:23,860 --> 01:02:26,620
Well where the fuck are your friends
who can back you up going out of that's

1052
01:02:26,621 --> 01:02:29,260
bullshit.
You got nothing.

1053
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:34,680
You just a loner. Yeah.
Jesus. I don't know. Alright.

1054
01:02:35,140 --> 01:02:38,380
Motorcycle through Thailand.
Jesus Christ.

1055
01:02:39,250 --> 01:02:42,490
If you wrote a motorcycle to Thailand,
you the toughest fucking guy I know.

1056
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:47,380
Unless you're from there.
Uh, dear Billy Budd Baxter.

1057
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:49,133
Yeah.

1058
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:53,260
I'm glad to hear your 2014
it starting off strong.

1059
01:02:53,590 --> 01:02:57,400
I remember you talking a few weeks back
about being able to drive all to be able

1060
01:02:57,401 --> 01:02:58,540
to drive all things.

1061
01:02:58,810 --> 01:03:02,530
I've had that same philosophy for a few
years now and I've been working towards

1062
01:03:02,531 --> 01:03:03,820
learning how to do just that.

1063
01:03:03,821 --> 01:03:08,170
I'm 25 hours into getting my pilot's
license and in November I took a basic

1064
01:03:08,171 --> 01:03:10,120
motorcycle driving course over a weekend.

1065
01:03:10,390 --> 01:03:12,190
I think you have taken something similar.
Yeah.

1066
01:03:12,191 --> 01:03:16,120
I got a motorcycle license a couple of
weeks after the course with no additional

1067
01:03:16,121 --> 01:03:19,810
motorcycle experience and never having
driven outside of a parking lot.

1068
01:03:19,811 --> 01:03:23,410
I flew to Thailand,
Jesus Christ there.

1069
01:03:23,411 --> 01:03:27,790
I went to the northern mountains and
rented a two 50 cc dual purpose dirt bike

1070
01:03:28,060 --> 01:03:31,660
and drove for nine days
around the Mae Hong Son loop.

1071
01:03:32,050 --> 01:03:36,040
The fuck is that though.
It can easily be done in five or six days.

1072
01:03:37,060 --> 01:03:38,560
Google it if you feel like it.

1073
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:41,560
It was easily the best
experience of my entire life.

1074
01:03:41,561 --> 01:03:44,860
I was able to get out of the the shit,
show tourists,

1075
01:03:44,861 --> 01:03:49,750
clap trap areas and see what the fuck
was going on in the day to day lives of a

1076
01:03:49,751 --> 01:03:53,770
bunch of ties. The food was incredible.
The views were out of this world.

1077
01:03:54,010 --> 01:03:56,650
The people are the most
friendly in the world. See,

1078
01:03:56,690 --> 01:03:58,840
I have all these stereotypes like
I wouldn't want to go up there,

1079
01:03:58,841 --> 01:04:02,410
I think going to get kidnapped or some
shit and I was able to gain some real

1080
01:04:02,411 --> 01:04:04,990
chops when it comes to riding a bike.

1081
01:04:04,991 --> 01:04:09,460
Plus I got to stop in a couple of small
tourist based towns and met a beautiful

1082
01:04:09,461 --> 01:04:13,570
Scandinavian girl.
Oh and it didn't hurt that 50 baht.

1083
01:04:13,810 --> 01:04:16,260
I don't know how to say it.
A dollar 50 American,

1084
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:19,690
we'll get you all the foods
you can eat and 400 baht.

1085
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:24,100
We'll get you a beautiful bamboo hut in
the middle of the Goddamn rain forest

1086
01:04:24,101 --> 01:04:28,870
for the night. I doubt anyone will give
a shit about your standup in Thailand.

1087
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:30,460
It's not you,
it's them.

1088
01:04:31,570 --> 01:04:34,810
But you should definitely make a trip out
there and drive around and on a rented

1089
01:04:34,811 --> 01:04:38,440
motorcycle. I got tons
of more information. If
you're actually interested,

1090
01:04:38,650 --> 01:04:42,970
thanks for the free labs. Come to
Durham, North Carolina as soon. Uh,

1091
01:04:42,971 --> 01:04:46,900
and go fuck yourself. Um, dude,

1092
01:04:46,901 --> 01:04:49,780
I would love to do that.
I'm just afraid to go.

1093
01:04:49,810 --> 01:04:52,870
There's certain places where you
go, I don't, you get put on a list.

1094
01:04:54,930 --> 01:04:58,710
Isn't Thailand the one we're fucking
pervert Goto to bang a little boys.

1095
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:00,450
Okay.

1096
01:05:00,450 --> 01:05:02,120
No,
we got enough Thai food over here.

1097
01:05:02,121 --> 01:05:05,960
They just assume they don't assume you're
going over there to ride a bike on the

1098
01:05:05,961 --> 01:05:08,870
fucking Ho Chi Minh loop or whatever
the fuck he just did over there.

1099
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:11,870
They think you going over there for
that. But that sounds awesome. That is,

1100
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:16,100
that is a bucket list goal of mine.
I do.

1101
01:05:16,101 --> 01:05:19,600
I want to be in scenic place in
another country on a motorcycle.

1102
01:05:21,180 --> 01:05:21,620
Okay.

1103
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:23,600
That, I mean, why wouldn't
you want to fucking do that?

1104
01:05:24,860 --> 01:05:27,320
Ride around and pretend like you're
tough and you know how to fight.

1105
01:05:27,370 --> 01:05:28,400
That's just what I want to do.

1106
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:36,830
Um, congratulations. Well, I
never even heard of that for the,

1107
01:05:36,831 --> 01:05:38,540
for those few listeners at home,

1108
01:05:38,541 --> 01:05:43,220
if you're at your desk right now and you
don't want to fucking do work, do work,

1109
01:05:43,221 --> 01:05:46,280
you don't want to be working. Uh, let
me, let me spell that out for you.

1110
01:05:46,281 --> 01:05:49,640
A flew to Thailand,
the Mae Hong Son loop,

1111
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:53,540
Mae Hong as in Hong Kong,

1112
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:57,230
h o n g n s o n.
Loop.

1113
01:05:58,840 --> 01:05:59,010
Okay.

1114
01:05:59,010 --> 01:05:59,431
By the way,

1115
01:05:59,431 --> 01:06:03,720
what's up with fucking Dr Evil in
North Korea feed and his uncle to dogs.

1116
01:06:04,410 --> 01:06:05,340
Is that true?

1117
01:06:06,130 --> 01:06:06,580
Yeah,

1118
01:06:06,580 --> 01:06:10,450
I kind of have to believe that because
it's not like they have to sway public

1119
01:06:10,451 --> 01:06:12,940
opinion liberal or
Conservative about that guy.

1120
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:14,780
Okay.

1121
01:06:14,780 --> 01:06:19,760
At fat jerk off. The fuck is wrong
with you if you're listening to this,

1122
01:06:19,761 --> 01:06:23,450
cause I know your dad was a big movie
fan and maybe you want to rebel against

1123
01:06:23,451 --> 01:06:26,690
your dad and listen to the podcast.
If you lit listening to this,

1124
01:06:28,210 --> 01:06:33,050
uh, dude, you're headed
towards an ugly death.

1125
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:36,950
You're not going to survive doing shit
like that. That's not the way to do it.

1126
01:06:36,980 --> 01:06:39,560
I don't know.
Did Your Dad own the godfather trilogy?

1127
01:06:39,561 --> 01:06:42,800
And you're trying to act like everybody
in your world is fucking Mo Green.

1128
01:06:42,860 --> 01:06:45,130
Maybe you have to do that. You
should have just shot the guy, dude,

1129
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:50,600
if you do stuff like that, like the
level of fear that that put in me,

1130
01:06:50,601 --> 01:06:53,630
and I'm not even in your country.
I'm already thinking.

1131
01:06:53,690 --> 01:06:57,530
I think my first thought after I got over
the wave of fear of that was I have to

1132
01:06:57,531 --> 01:07:01,520
kill this guy. If I lived in the country,
that's what I would have two bullets,

1133
01:07:01,521 --> 01:07:05,210
one for him, and then I'd shoot myself
just in case I do. You know what?

1134
01:07:05,211 --> 01:07:06,470
I'd shoot the dude.

1135
01:07:07,730 --> 01:07:08,100
Okay.

1136
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:11,120
And then I would wait half a second.
And if I didn't hear applause,

1137
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:12,420
I would then shoot myself

1138
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:18,900
because I always felt if you took out a
guy who's just ruling with that level of

1139
01:07:19,530 --> 01:07:20,670
psychosis,

1140
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:21,880
okay.

1141
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:24,400
Um,
that if you took them out,

1142
01:07:25,570 --> 01:07:27,520
is everybody sitting there
looking down at the floors?

1143
01:07:27,550 --> 01:07:31,180
He's saying the next crazy thing he
wanted to do that if you actually took 'em

1144
01:07:31,181 --> 01:07:34,750
out that on some level people
boot would be like, uh,

1145
01:07:34,810 --> 01:07:38,500
the second you did it would be like, ah,
God, thank God you did it. Jesus Christ.

1146
01:07:38,620 --> 01:07:43,480
I thought I was the only one. Um,
all right. I don't fucking know.

1147
01:07:43,481 --> 01:07:44,314

Okay. Drunk girlfriend issue.

1200
01:10:52,911 --> 01:10:57,470
This is the last one on the, on the
podcast. Hey Billy Bob Burton. Um,

1201
01:10:57,530 --> 01:10:58,880
I'm a big fan of yours,

1202
01:10:59,030 --> 01:11:03,440
fellow Bostonian suburb guy as
well and I love the podcast.

1203
01:11:03,530 --> 01:11:07,610
I have some relationship issues that I'd
like your input on if you would be so

1204
01:11:07,611 --> 01:11:08,630
kind.
You fuck

1205
01:11:12,700 --> 01:11:16,980
all. All right. I've been dating my
girlfriend for over four years. I am 26,

1206
01:11:16,981 --> 01:11:20,610
she's 25.
We moved in together in September,

1207
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:22,530
2013 because I thought
things were going well.

1208
01:11:22,740 --> 01:11:27,360
Well we have some issues and I'm not
sure what to do besides the usual fights

1209
01:11:27,361 --> 01:11:32,130
over things where I think logically and
present my side of the argument well

1210
01:11:32,131 --> 01:11:34,350
with facts that are
relative to the subject.

1211
01:11:34,351 --> 01:11:39,120
And she rambles about how I'm a
mama's boy and have a small Dick. Um,

1212
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:42,960
well yeah, I guess in other
words you're probably right.

1213
01:11:42,961 --> 01:11:46,230
So she's just capitulated in
and I was just insulting you.

1214
01:11:47,010 --> 01:11:48,720
Granted this is your version of it.
Anyways,

1215
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:50,880
he said my biggest issue is her drinking.

1216
01:11:51,210 --> 01:11:54,450
More specifically how she
acts when she's drunk.

1217
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:59,580
When we are drinking in public set
sitting,

1218
01:11:59,581 --> 01:12:02,010
that's setting sitting with
the large group of people,

1219
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:04,650
she drinks too much and always blacks out.

1220
01:12:04,950 --> 01:12:07,830
This is typically not a normal thing.

1221
01:12:07,831 --> 01:12:11,130
It only happens once every few months,

1222
01:12:11,131 --> 01:12:15,900
but over the holiday season it happens
every weekend while at company Christmas

1223
01:12:15,901 --> 01:12:20,250
parties, hers and mind friend's
houses and while on a pub crawl,

1224
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:23,010
I have two big issues with
her blacking out like that.

1225
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:28,280
One is that it's usually she only
drinks excessively when other people,

1226
01:12:28,860 --> 01:12:32,790
mainly her bitchy best friend insists
that my girlfriend should drink a lot.

1227
01:12:33,090 --> 01:12:36,510
Even though my girlfriend has a
very low tolerance for alcohol.

1228
01:12:36,930 --> 01:12:39,810
It's to the point that her best
friend will say things to her like,

1229
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:41,190
if you don't take this shot,

1230
01:12:41,191 --> 01:12:45,390
I hate you slash you're
not my friend Jesus Christ,

1231
01:12:45,510 --> 01:12:46,860
and she's being serious.

1232
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:52,350
I spoken with my girl repeatedly about
how I feel that that's not a good idea or

1233
01:12:52,351 --> 01:12:55,560
right to allow a friend to do that to
her and my girlfriend replies that she's

1234
01:12:55,561 --> 01:12:59,010
not going to say no to her best
friend no matter what Jesus Christ.

1235
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:03,690
This is like a textbook
codependent relationship here. Um,

1236
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:08,040
my second issue is that when she
blacks out, once I get her in the cat,

1237
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:10,680
the car or cab to take her home,

1238
01:13:10,980 --> 01:13:15,720
she gets really quiet and starts saying
she hates our relationship. She hates me,

1239
01:13:15,721 --> 01:13:17,190
she hates living with me.

1240
01:13:17,370 --> 01:13:22,370
She wishes we would break up among other
similar things once she sleeps it off

1241
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:24,660
and wakes up, hung, hung over.

1242
01:13:24,660 --> 01:13:28,110
She has no recollection of what
she said to me the night prior.

1243
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:33,420
And she says that drunk
words, they're drunk words and
they mean nothing. Ah, God,

1244
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:35,220
I do not think that way.

1245
01:13:35,340 --> 01:13:38,700
They legitimately hurts my feeling and
has feelings and has happened so often

1246
01:13:38,701 --> 01:13:41,520
recently that I've been
weighing my options about
whether it's time to end this

1247
01:13:41,521 --> 01:13:43,770
relationship and move on.
I'm not sure.

1248
01:13:43,771 --> 01:13:45,630
I'm just being a pushy
and need to get over it,

1249
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:50,400
or if I have legitimate gripe here, dude,
you totally have a legitimate gripe.

1250
01:13:50,490 --> 01:13:52,980
He says, I care about my girlfriend
a lot. And until recently,

1251
01:13:52,981 --> 01:13:56,920
I was beginning to think about proposing
marriage to her at some point. Dude,

1252
01:13:56,921 --> 01:14:00,810
you cannot on any fucking level proposed
to this girl with this shit on the

1253
01:14:00,811 --> 01:14:02,430
table right now.
He said,

1254
01:14:02,431 --> 01:14:05,730
I had planted in my head that if we were
going to live together for two years,

1255
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:10,050
then we had the right stuff for marriage.
Uh, with all this drinking stuff though,

1256
01:14:10,051 --> 01:14:13,060
I'm not sure where to go.
If you have any tips or advice,

1257
01:14:13,061 --> 01:14:14,950
I'd greatly appreciate it.
Go Fuck Yourself.

1258
01:14:14,951 --> 01:14:18,460
Can't wait to see a new special in 2014
hope you perform at Boston. All right?

1259
01:14:18,790 --> 01:14:21,610
Yeah, Dude. Um, first things first,

1260
01:14:21,611 --> 01:14:25,600
do not on any level proposed
marriage to this woman at all,

1261
01:14:25,690 --> 01:14:27,610
on any fucking level.
Um,

1262
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:32,260
what you have to do is you got
to put your foot down. All right?

1263
01:14:32,290 --> 01:14:35,830
You have to say both
things that you brought up,

1264
01:14:36,550 --> 01:14:39,390
provided you're being honest
with me. Uh, you are 100% in the,

1265
01:14:39,490 --> 01:14:42,490
and you have to just say, look, um,

1266
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:47,640
you can't drink like that anymore and
you can't have a relationship with your

1267
01:14:47,891 --> 01:14:52,510
friend like that anymore. Um, actually
you can because you are a free individual.

1268
01:14:52,511 --> 01:14:55,900
But if you're going to be,
then I want out of this relationship,

1269
01:14:56,050 --> 01:14:59,710
I'm not going to be with somebody who
drinks like that and more specifically

1270
01:14:59,711 --> 01:15:02,410
drinks like that because her
friend is making a drink like that.

1271
01:15:02,620 --> 01:15:07,560
And second of all, you know, I don't, I,

1272
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:11,390
I don't, you know, there's an expression
out there that, what does it say? Uh,

1273
01:15:11,780 --> 01:15:14,050
a drunk man's words are
a sober man's thoughts.

1274
01:15:17,710 --> 01:15:22,240
I Dunno. I would, oh shit. This
is Bart. Nick, hold on one sec.

1275
01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:26,320
Hang on. Hang on Joey beat.
Just wrap it up the podcast.

1276
01:15:26,330 --> 01:15:30,890
They'll be outside and two
minutes. Okay. All right. See you.

1277
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:37,120
Um, yeah, so I would basically, uh,

1278
01:15:39,810 --> 01:15:43,590
okay, so let's just
compartmentalize this thing. Okay.

1279
01:15:43,620 --> 01:15:47,340
If that first issue, just the drinking
thing, I would just lay down the gauntlet.

1280
01:15:47,341 --> 01:15:47,911
You if you,

1281
01:15:47,911 --> 01:15:51,660
if you want to be with me and you know
I'm not going to be in a relationship

1282
01:15:51,690 --> 01:15:53,520
with that going on,
that's unacceptable.

1283
01:15:53,700 --> 01:15:56,790
I respect the fact if you still want to
do it, but if you still want to do it,

1284
01:15:56,791 --> 01:15:58,200
then you're moving out around,

1285
01:15:58,201 --> 01:16:01,320
moving out and we're not going to be a
couple anymore because I'm not tolerating

1286
01:16:01,321 --> 01:16:01,740
that.

1287
01:16:01,740 --> 01:16:04,800
And you're well within your rights to
do that and it's a great thing to say at

1288
01:16:04,801 --> 01:16:08,640
26 years of old to get some sort of self
esteem within a relationship and have

1289
01:16:08,641 --> 01:16:11,940
some ground rules with yourself.
This is your half of the circle.

1290
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:16,650
What do I want and what am I willing
to put up with? Where is my line?

1291
01:16:16,830 --> 01:16:19,680
You found your line and you tell
her that that's where it is.

1292
01:16:20,130 --> 01:16:22,170
You don't have to be a jerk. You
don't have to get angry. Just say,

1293
01:16:22,171 --> 01:16:25,650
this is my line and I totally respect
if you want to live on the other side of

1294
01:16:25,651 --> 01:16:28,630
the line, I'm just not going to
live with you doing that. Um,

1295
01:16:28,740 --> 01:16:30,270
this other shit where she gets,

1296
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:34,110
she says she hates to relationship
and wishes that you broke up. Um,

1297
01:16:35,810 --> 01:16:39,080
if it happened one time, whatever.
She does that every fucking time.

1298
01:16:39,260 --> 01:16:42,250
I think those are our honest words
and I honestly would consider, see,

1299
01:16:42,290 --> 01:16:46,510
consider getting the fuck
out of that relationship. Um,

1300
01:16:46,990 --> 01:16:49,540
I think you, you guys have both been
in relationships for a long time.

1301
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:54,100
You got into it when you
were really young. Maybe she
still wants to see, explore,

1302
01:16:54,101 --> 01:16:58,180
see what the fucks out there. I
have no idea what that is. A major,

1303
01:16:58,181 --> 01:17:01,210
major fucking red flag.
Um,

1304
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:03,190
and uh,

1305
01:17:03,220 --> 01:17:08,050
I don't buy it and I also don't buy that
she's 100% drinking like that because

1306
01:17:08,051 --> 01:17:12,230
her friend is making her it. Uh, I
think she wants to drink life. She's,

1307
01:17:12,231 --> 01:17:14,360
maybe she's drinking like that cause
she's not happy in a relationship.

1308
01:17:14,361 --> 01:17:17,900
I don't know. There's a bunch of major
red flags and you 100% the right.

1309
01:17:17,990 --> 01:17:20,780
You're not being a pussy,
you're being fucking mature and you're,

1310
01:17:20,781 --> 01:17:22,460
you're saying what you want.
Fuck this dude.

1311
01:17:22,461 --> 01:17:27,461
You don't want some drunk with some drunk
fucking friend who then gets hammered

1312
01:17:28,011 --> 01:17:29,540
and says they don't want to be with you.

1313
01:17:30,350 --> 01:17:32,240
When you dream at Lazette your dream girl,

1314
01:17:32,241 --> 01:17:35,000
when you sit there and fantasy
kicked this bitch to the curb,

1315
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:38,000
I've added with her.
I'm not even in the fucking relationship.

1316
01:17:38,001 --> 01:17:41,090
You could do better. All right?
I'm not saying she's not the one,

1317
01:17:41,091 --> 01:17:44,230
but she needs to grow the fuck up.
Don't say it like that, but that,

1318
01:17:44,231 --> 01:17:47,210
that's what I believe. And that's, that's
my thoughts and I'm sticking with it.

1319
01:17:47,540 --> 01:17:51,740
All right. My buddies, outside of
being a cunt, I gotta get off here. Uh,

1320
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:56,060
have a great week. Go
fuck yourselves. And, um,

1321
01:17:57,230 --> 01:18:00,170
that's it. I'll talk to you next week. I'm
looking forward to some great football.

1322
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:00,770
All right.
See you.
