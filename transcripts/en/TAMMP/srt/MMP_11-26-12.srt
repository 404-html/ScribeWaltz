1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:06,180
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's
the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:10,890
uh, November 26, 2012. How are you doing?

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,970
Um, I hope you are fine. Okay.

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,220
I hope you are fine.

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,240
I hope during this holiday season that
you and yours and any pets you have from

6
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:29,541
mammals all the way down to gold fishes
are just doing great and thinking about

7
00:00:31,861 --> 00:00:36,270
prostate cancer. Um,
all right. I'm actually,

8
00:00:36,271 --> 00:00:37,620
I'm psyched to be back here in la.

9
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:41,010
I kind of have to keep my voice down
because the lovely Nia is still sleeping

10
00:00:41,011 --> 00:00:44,610
upstairs. Um, I am basically,

11
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:47,760
I'm holding two microphones right now
because I've learned how to shut off the

12
00:00:47,761 --> 00:00:50,860
external microphone on this thing and I
didn't have time to go back to guitars

13
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:53,340
and,
uh,

14
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:57,810
figure out how to just use one mic on
this and have it come into both my fucking

15
00:00:57,811 --> 00:01:00,720
ears, you know, I don't know how to do it,

16
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,650
so I got to go down and talk to
one of those fucking guys. Sorry.

17
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:09,310
All right. I'm not good at this shit. So
I'm sitting here holding two microphones,

18
00:01:09,311 --> 00:01:12,100
like kind of like John Bonham.
You know,

19
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,830
if I could compare myself to him
when he played the, the, the,

20
00:01:14,831 --> 00:01:19,390
the track up four sticks, two sticks in
each in, right? I got two microphones.

21
00:01:19,391 --> 00:01:23,740
He's got four sticks go a little
bottom this week. All right. Uh,

22
00:01:23,741 --> 00:01:27,640
I've got a ton of shit to talk about
this week. A lot of sports stuff,

23
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:32,950
by the way. Um, just to get, you know,

24
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:36,070
just for, for all the people that
fucking hate when I talk sports,

25
00:01:36,071 --> 00:01:38,920
this might be one you just
want to shut off. Okay.

26
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,460
We just fucking walk away and be like, oh,
why does he talk about middle earth? Um,

27
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,520
somebody informed me, by the
way, that Lord of the Rings, uh,

28
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:49,090
that middle earth thing,
it's not in the middle of the earth.

29
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:51,760
It's not like between our world
and the center of the earth.

30
00:01:51,761 --> 00:01:54,670
Like I thought it was, they're
like, oh, hey shithead.

31
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,280
It's actually another fucking
plant. Well, what does it mean?

32
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,420
You know that that writers sucks so bad.

33
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:03,330
He couldn't come up with
another name for a planet.

34
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:07,270
They did that with fucking Superman's
parents, didn't they? Then he,

35
00:02:07,271 --> 00:02:12,030
then he come from like the fucking
the planet of Zog or Zuora.

36
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,210
It was always big and Scifi. Like if
there was a planet or a guy's name,

37
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,590
it always had to started with a z cause
that just sounded like so fucking alien

38
00:02:20,591 --> 00:02:24,700
cause nobody ever named a kid. Like
there was a couple of Xanax, you know,

39
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,910
what else is there other than Zach Zelda.

40
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,540
That's it for me. Zippy, you know.

41
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:42,120
Um, anyway, so let's, let's get into
the, uh, let's get into the sports here.

42
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:44,220
The soft fucking weird to
be holding two microphones.

43
00:02:44,221 --> 00:02:45,690
I feel like one of those divas singers,

44
00:02:45,691 --> 00:02:48,450
you ever see that back in the day when
they would have to be singing into one

45
00:02:48,451 --> 00:02:52,980
microphone, then they'd have
another microphone taped
to the other one, you know?

46
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:59,860
Yeah, no, you did, you know, you did. You
had no, you did. What was that song? Yeah.

47
00:02:59,861 --> 00:03:02,050
Not Jeeva three.

48
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:07,220
Bahbahbah remember that you used
to say live in Atlanta live?

49
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:12,860
No, sorry, I'm, that's
what I'm thinking of.

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,700
Axel rose with his
fucking white bike shorts.

51
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:20,570
You could actually wear white
fucking bike shorts, you know,

52
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,000
not under your pants.
Just that's what you could,

53
00:03:23,001 --> 00:03:27,560
where he could have warned that with a
hat on backwards with the one size fits

54
00:03:27,561 --> 00:03:32,510
all strap, making that red mark on his
forehead and know and just done a concert.

55
00:03:32,511 --> 00:03:33,920
No one,
one had a fucking problem with it,

56
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,580
which I guess makes sense because
Friday market we're used to kind of walk

57
00:03:37,581 --> 00:03:38,840
around like an adult diaper.

58
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:43,310
Did he do like shows like barefoot and
like tidy whities and he had like that

59
00:03:43,311 --> 00:03:45,950
microphone like stand
that was sort cut off.

60
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,980
She was sort of like a majorette
and like singing a song.

61
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:54,700
Did that happen or did I just dream
that? Um, anyways, let's get to the, um,

62
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,380
let's get to the sports.
This week I think I,

63
00:03:58,381 --> 00:04:02,750
I watch the most football Arik
possibly anybody in the United States.

64
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:03,680
It's on thanksgiving.

65
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,310
I went back to my hometown because
I was going back from my, uh,

66
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,100
my 25 year high school reunion.

67
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:15,110
G O g g h 25 fucking years.
Can you believe that?

68
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:20,630
I graduated high school 25 years ago
and I stayed back in the first grade.

69
00:04:20,631 --> 00:04:25,160
So when I graduated I was 19 to do
the fucking math. I'm 44 years old.

70
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:30,200
I'm fucking, I they, they even
spotted me a year and I've still,

71
00:04:30,201 --> 00:04:33,620
I'm still at my 25 year
high school fucking reunion.

72
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:38,210
And um, I got to admit I was
pretty nervous going in that thick,

73
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:41,660
you know what I mean?
I haven't seen a lot of those.

74
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,910
The kids that I went to school with,
a lot of them,

75
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:48,940
literally since the day we got our
diplomas and then that was fucking it.

76
00:04:49,551 --> 00:04:53,150
So you know, you know the
deal, you want to walk in,

77
00:04:53,151 --> 00:04:54,800
you want to see everybody looking good,

78
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:59,270
you want to see everybody happy and
everybody live in a life that they want to

79
00:04:59,271 --> 00:05:02,930
be living. That was my biggest fear.
I didn't want to walk in there.

80
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:07,160
I didn't want to be reminded
of how fucking old I was
and I didn't want to see a

81
00:05:07,161 --> 00:05:10,800
bunch of beaten down.
I like the 20 years.

82
00:05:10,801 --> 00:05:15,650
And she walked out on me know that I
didn't want to see that, you know? And uh,

83
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:19,360
got it. Tell you, uh, um, my
fucking great held up great.

84
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,620
You know, everybody was looking good
man. Everybody looked down right?

85
00:05:23,621 --> 00:05:28,090
Everybody looked like they were happy,
Eh, uh, it was a great fucking time.

86
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:32,220
So, uh, so there's one for your underrated
going to your high school reunion.

87
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:36,320
There's a lot of people have like,
uh, like hilarious react like,

88
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,190
like it's visceral.
Is that the right word?

89
00:05:39,191 --> 00:05:43,330
Like if you mentioned that you go into
your reunion, you know what I mean?

90
00:05:43,331 --> 00:05:43,811
People just,

91
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:47,140
you go on your high school reunion and
they just go off on this rant, dude,

92
00:05:47,141 --> 00:05:47,420
I don't know.

93
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:52,420
Give a fuck if I never see another fucking
porch and I fucking hated everybody

94
00:05:52,521 --> 00:05:53,960
at fucking, what the fuck? Fuck.

95
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:58,340
You know what I mean? And it's
just like, right. What happened?

96
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:02,810
Who stuffed you in a locker? You
know, who broke up with you? What?

97
00:06:02,811 --> 00:06:06,830
What did you wish you did but you never
did? You know what I mean? You know,

98
00:06:06,831 --> 00:06:07,920
first he was like that for,

99
00:06:07,921 --> 00:06:11,510
as he was trying to fucking go on and
on and on and on and on about, dude,

100
00:06:11,511 --> 00:06:14,720
I have no desire. I don't want to
fucking go. Like I was getting trashed.

101
00:06:14,721 --> 00:06:17,780
I was at the, I was at
the stand, you know,

102
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:23,210
that little fucking a euro trash comedy
club that just opened up over there on

103
00:06:23,211 --> 00:06:28,010
the east side on,
what is it on a third and 20th street,

104
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,720
you know, with that little Shishi food
and a can a little stage downstairs,

105
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,950
you know.
Um,

106
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,960
I was there and one of the guys fucking
one of the owners of the club fucking

107
00:06:38,961 --> 00:06:41,690
hilarious. I told him I was going to my
high school union. I was excited because,

108
00:06:41,691 --> 00:06:43,340
you know, I hadn't, I
hadn't seen these, you know,

109
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:47,210
I liked the kids I went to school with,
you know, I was excited to go and he goes,

110
00:06:47,211 --> 00:06:50,870
you go to your high school reunion
and he starts laughing. He goes,

111
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,610
what do you need?
Closure.

112
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,100
That was probably the best
thing that anybody said.

113
00:06:58,101 --> 00:07:01,910
I thought that that was fucking
hilarious. But, uh, yeah,

114
00:07:01,911 --> 00:07:06,400
but I just kind of found like everybody
was just saying that, uh, they had no,

115
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,820
a lot of people going, I have no desire.
I don't know what happened. I was like,

116
00:07:10,821 --> 00:07:12,290
those are the kids
who've got like bullied,

117
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:17,630
you know,
I dunno just fucking

118
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:21,970
what's his photos versus he ended up safe
versus he just tried to say he had no

119
00:07:21,971 --> 00:07:26,940
desire to go to high school. He goes,
the go go to his high school reunion.

120
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:30,160
He goes, I hated high school. And
then I asked him, I said, all right,

121
00:07:30,161 --> 00:07:34,390
well who fucking a beat you with your
own gym towel? What happened? He goes,

122
00:07:34,391 --> 00:07:36,910
not do it. They never happen.
Never happen. You got just didn't,

123
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:40,300
I didn't like getting up in the
morning to have to go to it, you know,

124
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,380
like seven in the morning.

125
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:45,730
Quite possibly the dumbest reason
ever to not go to a high school. You,

126
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:48,310
it's like the fucking high school reunion
is going to be at night. You asshole.

127
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,930
You don't have to go
back to your home room.

128
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:55,270
Paul Versey and then I talked to him a
little bit more than I dragged it up some

129
00:07:55,271 --> 00:07:57,130
chick fucking, I don't know
what, I don't know what happened.

130
00:07:58,690 --> 00:07:59,340
Yeah,

131
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:02,790
dude, you couldn't fucking
pay me to fucking shut up.

132
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:06,540
Shut the fuck up though. The
people, I think you know something.

133
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,010
I bet Versie when he goes back,

134
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,050
he's going to fucking,

135
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:14,150
he's either gonna rent a flashy car or
he's just going to get himself in way

136
00:08:14,151 --> 00:08:16,910
over his head on a car.
He actually owns,

137
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:18,933
you know,

138
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:23,170
why am I talking about this shit?
Anyway, so I went there and uh,

139
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,960
and just had a great fucking time.

140
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:30,220
Didn't drink because I didn't want to
be the fucking drunk guy, you know,

141
00:08:30,221 --> 00:08:30,851
and God knows,

142
00:08:30,851 --> 00:08:35,320
I really felt that my tolerance was
going to be way beyond most of my

143
00:08:35,321 --> 00:08:37,750
classmates,
considering most of them are normal,

144
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:40,480
got married and had kids and
even if they want a booze,

145
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,500
they kinda got to wait til a,
you know, the coast is clear.

146
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:47,890
Whereas I can kind of still drink,
like I'm still in fucking,

147
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:52,330
not even like I'm in college, like,
like it's like it's spring break.

148
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,060
I can fucking drink like that whenever
I want it to. Which is not a good,

149
00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:01,100
it's not a good thing for all belly
fat face here. So, um, I decided,

150
00:09:01,101 --> 00:09:01,381
you know what,

151
00:09:01,381 --> 00:09:04,760
I'll just start off with the cranberry
juice and a fucking lime and I'll endorse

152
00:09:04,761 --> 00:09:09,470
somebody doing the, the fucking departed
joke. What do you get your period? Um,

153
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,150
and then I switched to water as an
I had a coke and that was just like,

154
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:16,960
you know what? I'm not going to
fucking drink. And uh, I had a, uh,

155
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:21,240
I had a great time. What the fuck was, I
just, I was leading towards something. Oh,

156
00:09:21,241 --> 00:09:23,190
you know what? Everybody did and I
thought everything would be taken up.

157
00:09:23,191 --> 00:09:26,190
Pictures of their kids.
I didn't see one picture of anybody's kid.

158
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,210
Everybody was just talking about shit.
All the dumb shit we used to do.

159
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,560
And uh,
and had a great time.

160
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,840
Just have really had a great time.

161
00:09:36,841 --> 00:09:40,470
You know what a great story that I had
never heard. There was a buddy of mine,

162
00:09:40,471 --> 00:09:43,650
he's the fucking gamble,
like big time,

163
00:09:43,651 --> 00:09:46,670
used to bet on like baseball and he
had like his own landscaping company

164
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,880
whenever, like the baseball team
would win whatever team won a money,

165
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:54,630
he would then try and cut somebody's
backyard front yard in the same design as

166
00:09:54,631 --> 00:09:57,900
the outfield of that team. And
it never looked like it. It just,

167
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:59,880
it looked like some sort
of fucked up design,

168
00:09:59,881 --> 00:10:02,610
but he didn't know what he was doing
and he was high probably when he did it.

169
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,310
So somebody told me a
story about that kid.

170
00:10:05,311 --> 00:10:08,040
He had bet the fucking Houston
Rockets way back in the day.

171
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,610
And a Houston had lost like two games
in a row. So we thought it was a gift.

172
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:16,440
You fucking buries the team. And they
ended up, uh, they just shit in a bed,

173
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:17,760
nobody's playing or whatever.

174
00:10:17,761 --> 00:10:22,761
And he got so mad he picked up the
phone and he called long distance and he

175
00:10:23,221 --> 00:10:25,410
said, uh, yeah,

176
00:10:25,411 --> 00:10:28,350
and Houston last name Olijahwaun

177
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:37,120
and he wasn't doing it to make
the other person left. He,

178
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,950
he literally thought
that he was going to get,

179
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,570
I don't know if he was high or whatever,

180
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,540
he was trying to get this
guy's number to fucking bitch.

181
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:47,590
I'm out for losing and whatever,
50 bucks or 100 bucks in the game.

182
00:10:47,591 --> 00:10:50,500
So it was basically just shit
like that. And, uh, all right,

183
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:53,200
now you guys getting sick of this. Okay.
Whatever. I had a great fucking time.

184
00:10:53,201 --> 00:10:55,870
So if anybody who was at the high
school reunion is listening to me,

185
00:10:56,140 --> 00:11:00,340
it was great seeing you and I'm glad
everything seems to be going great and

186
00:11:00,341 --> 00:11:04,060
everybody's life. So anyway, so let's
get on with the sports here. Um,

187
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:09,040
here's one for you. First of all,
oh, I forgot to mention. Yeah,

188
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:10,600
I watched all these football.

189
00:11:10,601 --> 00:11:14,680
I went to my Mike high
school rivalry game.

190
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:20,700
I went to that, we were two and seven.
The other team was like fucking a,

191
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,550
what are the eight and one and uh,
we actually beat them in overtime.

192
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:28,480
It was an away game, you
know, sent the other team,

193
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:33,510
fucking fans home with their heads
hanging on Turkey day made me feel fucking

194
00:11:33,821 --> 00:11:38,140
great. And then I watched, uh, I watched
the first game was that the lions,

195
00:11:38,141 --> 00:11:40,900
Texas.
Then I watch the next game,

196
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:43,750
cowboys and then I watched the Patriots.
Uh,

197
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,830
I gave him was fucking unbelievable.
And don't worry Jeff Fans,

198
00:11:47,831 --> 00:11:49,480
I'm not going to fight. I
get it. If you've noticed,

199
00:11:49,481 --> 00:11:52,940
I really haven't trashed you guys to share
despite the fact I really could have.

200
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:53,883
I just haven't.

201
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:57,910
The only reason why I ever really fucking
trashed you guys was because Rex Ryan

202
00:11:57,911 --> 00:11:59,170
talked all that shit.
You know,

203
00:11:59,171 --> 00:12:03,370
he hasn't talked shit in two years
and I laid off you. Okay. So, um,

204
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:07,900
anyways, you know that guy
always make fun of the fireman.

205
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:12,490
I always say it gets on his boyfriend
shoulders like you some hot chick at a Bon

206
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:14,350
Jovi concert,
a fireman,

207
00:12:14,351 --> 00:12:17,980
ed fucking retired if you
haven't heard about this.

208
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:19,480
Okay.

209
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,060
He couldn't fucking take it anymore.
Why?

210
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:26,880
Because the Patriots beat the
team so bad. No, cause he,

211
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:31,330
he has to enter another
fucking jets rebuilding. No,

212
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:37,470
cause he got sick of the Conti fucking
jet fans getting in his fucking grill

213
00:12:37,961 --> 00:12:39,790
cause he's wearing a Sanchez Jersey.

214
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,980
The same fucking people who
are going calling Mark Sanchez,

215
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:48,670
Sanchez, Sanchez. A few
fucking years later,

216
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,830
they jump off the fucking bandwagon.

217
00:12:50,831 --> 00:12:55,831
Now they get into the face of this old
fucking retired a fireman on Thanksgiving

218
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,390
getting in his face and
he finally just decided,

219
00:13:01,391 --> 00:13:06,130
what the fuck am I doing the fuck
am I doing? Fuck these people.

220
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:10,450
And you know what I say? I
say, good for you firemen. Ed,

221
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,180
don't take no shit off nobody.

222
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:22,450
Here's the article. New York
jets, super fan firemen, ed,

223
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,480
who for decades has fueled home crowds
with his famous j e t s cheer has decided

224
00:13:28,331 --> 00:13:32,890
to r e t I r e retire.
Um,

225
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:34,960
I don't name names,
I won't say his last name.

226
00:13:34,961 --> 00:13:39,360
Who created a stir Thanksgiving night
when he left metlife stadium at halftime

227
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:43,030
of the jets. 49 to 19 loss. Yeah.
Along with half the fucking crowd.

228
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,980
And then he deleted his Twitter account.

229
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:48,370
He announced on Sunday night that
he will no longer attend home games.

230
00:13:48,371 --> 00:13:51,400
Is Firemen Ed good for you?
Good for you.

231
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:53,740
Okay.

232
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:56,650
You gotta go down there and dress up
like a fucking clown to get these people

233
00:13:56,651 --> 00:13:57,130
going.

234
00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:00,340
Only to have these people getting your
grill in the fucking bathroom screaming

235
00:14:00,341 --> 00:14:03,100
at you.
Shame on you jets fans.

236
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:07,470
And I know what you jet fans are going
to say. It was a select few people. No,

237
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:12,100
it wasn't. It was, it was probably
almost all of you. And you know why?

238
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:16,690
Because you're horrific human beings
and that's why God only let you win one.

239
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:18,641
Um,
anyways,

240
00:14:18,641 --> 00:14:22,060
he says the stadium has become divided
because of the quarterback controversy.

241
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:27,330
He claims the fact that I chose to wear
a Mark Sanchez Jersey this year and that

242
00:14:27,371 --> 00:14:30,640
fans think I'm on the payroll,
which is an outright lie,

243
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:35,170
have made these confrontations more
frequent, whether it's in the stands,

244
00:14:35,171 --> 00:14:36,640
the bathroom or the parking lot.

245
00:14:36,641 --> 00:14:40,150
These confrontations are
happening on a consistent basis.

246
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:46,630
Wow. So he just said fuck
it. And then Rex Ryan, Oh,

247
00:14:46,631 --> 00:14:51,230
uh, I, I actually hung around and watched
his press conference where he just kept

248
00:14:51,231 --> 00:14:53,420
saying the same. You, oh,
we're going to throw it all.

249
00:14:53,421 --> 00:14:55,400
We're going to come out next week.
I'm going to play hard.

250
00:14:55,401 --> 00:14:58,700
I mean that's all we know
how to do. You know, it just,

251
00:14:58,701 --> 00:15:00,710
you know that that same fucking shit.

252
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:02,853
You know

253
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:07,510
the same guy that one year
when they lifted the salary
cap and the jets went out

254
00:15:07,511 --> 00:15:09,730
and fucking one bought everybody,
he's like, well, kicked off

255
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,720
shit out of any fucking to move league.

256
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:17,370
It's just great watching him
eat a big slice of humble pie.

257
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:20,610
And the final question of
the press conferences, rex,

258
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:25,710
do you think you'll still be here
next year? And he just goes, yes I do.

259
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:29,130
Yes I do.
Any more questions?

260
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:33,250
And there was nothing and he had to
walk off on that one and I thoroughly

261
00:15:33,251 --> 00:15:37,660
enjoyed it, thoroughly fucking
enjoyed it. So there you go.

262
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:40,930
But this guy says he's going to
keep going to the, to the games.

263
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:45,490
He's just not going to the
game. You know, as firemen, ed,

264
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:50,520
the guys wearing the Sanchez
Jersey according to him as
like he's being loyal to

265
00:15:51,401 --> 00:15:53,540
this guy really is a fan. You
know something to people go, dude,

266
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:58,480
the guy used to be a fucking dolphins
fan, you know? All right, that works.

267
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:00,360
If he jumped on the bandwagon,

268
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:05,110
it became a patriots fan when the
Patriots got good or if he jumped on the

269
00:16:05,111 --> 00:16:07,750
bandwagon, you know, uh,

270
00:16:07,751 --> 00:16:11,120
with the giants or the Steelers or
any other team that was good dude.

271
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:15,460
He went from the dolphins to the
jets. Okay. No end. He did it in 75.

272
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:20,400
That was a major step backwards. All
right. According to what I've read. Okay.

273
00:16:20,401 --> 00:16:23,440
And 75, the fuck had dolphins. They, it,

274
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:26,910
they'd want to two Superbowls back to
back. Superbowls had a perfect season,

275
00:16:26,911 --> 00:16:29,520
went to three Superbowls in a row.
All in the early seventies.

276
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:31,690
They still had Bob Greasy,
I think Larry,

277
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:34,980
his uncle was already in the WFL and
maybe came back with the giants at that

278
00:16:34,981 --> 00:16:37,140
point. Fucking rain man. Here,

279
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,740
this is all from my football cards that
I looked at a zillion times when I was a

280
00:16:40,741 --> 00:16:44,160
kid rather than studying in high school.
And um,

281
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:45,820
okay,

282
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:50,130
who the fuck did, did they even
have Richard Todd at that point?

283
00:16:50,131 --> 00:16:55,110
Joe Nemeth was gone. Yeah, I
think they just got Richard Todd.

284
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:56,363
That was it.
Yeah.

285
00:16:56,450 --> 00:17:00,650
So this guy, this guy paid his fucking
dues. He went to a zillion games.

286
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:03,860
He's the only guy still the
balls to where? Sanchez Jersey.

287
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:08,720
This guy was actually a fan and he
got trashed by other fucking France.

288
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,240
I find that really fucking interesting.

289
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:13,303
MMM.

290
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,900
Yeah. Had it really actually taps into
this. This question, I got this this week.

291
00:17:17,901 --> 00:17:22,070
Somebody said, Bill, do you give a
shit? He said, hey bill, love you work,

292
00:17:22,071 --> 00:17:26,900
but you give a shit about your fans
doesn't look like it and sad to see.

293
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:33,310
I don't even, what the fuck? What does
that mean? Doesn't look like it does.

294
00:17:33,311 --> 00:17:35,290
Is My website subpar?

295
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:41,330
I know the audio was bad last week,
Bill. Well, you know you get, sorry.

296
00:17:41,331 --> 00:17:44,810
You're going to have to elaborate a
little bit more. What happened? Did you,

297
00:17:44,811 --> 00:17:47,930
how did Jay, you keep sending
emails and I haven't read one yet.

298
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,490
Did you have a cold last week

299
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:53,490
and asked me to send you a fucking card
and I did what? What does that mean?

300
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:59,700
Do I give a shit about my fence?
First of all?

301
00:17:59,701 --> 00:18:04,290
I don't know. All right.
This is what I feel like.

302
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:08,370
I feel you have a fucking responsibility
to give somebody a God damn show.

303
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,560
That's what you have.
Go out there,

304
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:13,920
give somebody their fucking
bodies worth all right.

305
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,410
And I like to think I do that.
So where the fuck is that and what more?

306
00:18:19,411 --> 00:18:23,400
What more do I got to do for you?
Where the t shirt or your company,

307
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,493
you know,

308
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,580
you think that's sad? You know,
I think just fucking shad.

309
00:18:31,581 --> 00:18:34,760
I think that fucking emails said,
what are you doing?

310
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:40,470
You know what? What the, I don't even
know where the fuck that comes from.

311
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,310
Do I give a shit about
if it has? No, I don't.

312
00:18:44,311 --> 00:18:49,170
I want to go back to standing in a a
fucking function room in a hotel room in

313
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:51,680
front of 80 people who didn't even
know there was going to be comedy.

314
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:56,350
Give me a fucking break. Okay. I don't, I
don't know what your, your level of, uh,

315
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:59,460
I have to give shit. Let me ask
you, let me ask you a question, sir.

316
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:04,440
Do you give a shit about the p the,
the, the people that you're fans of?

317
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:06,853
You know,

318
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:12,100
cause I, I gotta be honest with
you. I don't, I thought I did,

319
00:19:12,101 --> 00:19:16,060
but I fucking love ACDC.

320
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,890
Absolutely fucking love them.

321
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:21,220
And I had another bad example cause
they've never really fell off.

322
00:19:21,221 --> 00:19:22,630
They've always sold a bunch of albums.

323
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:27,370
I loved a lot of bands in the
80s loved them. All right.

324
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:32,740
But when they fell off in the fucking
nineties I didn't keep going to their

325
00:19:32,741 --> 00:19:36,520
shows. I didn't send them
cards going, hey man,

326
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:39,670
hang in there.
I didn't,

327
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:44,740
I totally fucking slipped
and made fun of them.

328
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:46,930
I make fun of hair metal.
To this day,

329
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:50,650
I guess they make fun of myself to saying
I can't believe some of the fucking

330
00:19:50,651 --> 00:19:53,050
shows I went to.
But you know what I mean?

331
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:56,420
It's those people who are still fucking
going to those shows what their hairs

332
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,540
teased up,
acid washed jeans,

333
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:02,720
this fireman Ed sitting there was still
wearing the Sanchez, Sanchez gene,

334
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:07,120
a fucking jersey.
I guess that that is a true fanatic.

335
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:10,060
But the rest of us I think are a,
you know,

336
00:20:10,061 --> 00:20:14,710
we're fucking hot and cold isn't the
real relationship most fans have with the

337
00:20:14,711 --> 00:20:18,100
musician and actor,
a fucking whatever.

338
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,333
MMM.

339
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:25,690
An athlete don't, aren't you really kind
of just a fan? As long as they're good,

340
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,753
you know,

341
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:32,830
they sold a lot of Sanchez jerseys.
Okay.

342
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:36,820
And everybody loved him until
he didn't start playing well,

343
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,680
and now everybody fucking hates him.

344
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:40,963
You know,

345
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:47,740
I think that's, that's more,
that's the reality, you know,

346
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:51,220
so you don't sound, well, I don't know.
I don't know where that's coming from,

347
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,810
so I can't really judge you. But, uh,

348
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:57,230
I do give a shit about the
people who come to my shows, uh,

349
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:02,280
unless they have some sense of
entitlement where they feel like,

350
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:04,390
you know,

351
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:09,390
I bought a ticket to your show and
despite the fact that you then did a show,

352
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:14,590
so I already got my money's worth,
that I definitely deserve more shit.

353
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:18,310
You know,
they don't consider the bonus round,

354
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:23,170
you know, taking pictures and
signing whatever the fuck they want.

355
00:21:23,171 --> 00:21:27,100
They don't consider that like, oh,
hey, this guy's actually this guy.

356
00:21:27,101 --> 00:21:30,070
Technically it doesn't even have to
fucking be out here. And He came out here.

357
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:33,670
Most people appreciate that. Oh glad
you came out, you know. Ah Yeah, no,

358
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,720
thank you for coming out. Right. That
fucking little tit for tat thing.

359
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:40,950
Those people who fucking sit there and
they come up hammered and nudge it and

360
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,250
they have like a,
you know,

361
00:21:42,251 --> 00:21:45,790
sign 500 fucking things and I want to
have a 20 minute conversation with you

362
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:48,670
despite the fact there's another
40 people waiting behind you.

363
00:21:48,671 --> 00:21:51,820
Who else would have jobs and shit to
do? And when I say I'll come, sorry,

364
00:21:51,821 --> 00:21:55,210
this other people. And then you flip out
and say that I'm some Prima Donna cont.

365
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:59,540
Yeah. I don't give a shit
about them. I hope I answered
your question, sir. You're,

366
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:00,311

So,
um,

430
00:25:57,370 --> 00:26:01,520
all right. He's a big as another fucking
thing. I got a bone I have to pick.

431
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:04,100
And you know some, I really came
down hard on the jets. I have fans.

432
00:26:04,101 --> 00:26:05,480
I know a lot of your fans didn't leave.

433
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:08,120
You guys are the real fucking fans
and towards the end of that game,

434
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:12,080
if you looked around, if you really
want to see the real fans, yeah,

435
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:14,870
if you were still fucking there
and not wearing a patriots jersey.

436
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:19,280
I always hate people who fucking leave
early when your team's taken an ass

437
00:26:19,281 --> 00:26:20,210
kicking from the other team,

438
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:24,470
cause the end of the other team's fans
get to like air quote takeover your, your,

439
00:26:24,471 --> 00:26:29,060
your stadium. She never
let that happen. Okay.

440
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:33,110
You should have them walking out with
their heads down nervous that they're

441
00:26:33,111 --> 00:26:37,780
going to get beat down by 60,000 fucking
fans. That's what, that's what I feel. Um,

442
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:42,740
all right. Okay. As always. Okay.
We fucked with the east coast.

443
00:26:42,741 --> 00:26:45,900
Now how about the west coast? Did you
guys see a Koby Bryant the other night?

444
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:49,530
I forget who the fuck they were playing.
They lost another game.

445
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,920
Things aren't going well out there.
So there's 10 seconds left in the game.

446
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:54,623
You know,

447
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,900
there's no way the Lakers can come
back to down like by eight or nine or

448
00:26:57,901 --> 00:26:59,700
something like that.
So the other team has the ball,

449
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:02,880
they get an inbound it there at half
court and they're just standing there

450
00:27:02,881 --> 00:27:07,230
dribbling it out. Right? And
you just stand there, you wait.

451
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:11,550
Then the horn blows and then
everybody just goes and shake hands.

452
00:27:11,551 --> 00:27:14,310
And you're going to the
locker room. Well Colby, yeah,

453
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,410
we'd score 30 points that night.
Never dental.

454
00:27:16,411 --> 00:27:20,310
He thought he was God's gift to fucking
everything. He just walks off the court,

455
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:22,200
left his teammates there.

456
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,713
Right?

457
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:28,720
One of the most diva fucking
things I've ever seen in my life,

458
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:33,550
just fucking walks off court with
the whole, Hey, I scored 30 points.

459
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:38,410
I don't know what's wrong with the rest
of you. Totally setting himself apart.

460
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:40,720
Just an absolute fucking cancer.

461
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,293
Right?

462
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,870
So I'm watching ESPN go nay. Let's
see what they're going to do. Is He,

463
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,450
they finally gonna fucking
criticize this guy, Steven,

464
00:27:49,451 --> 00:27:51,940
a Smith who I love,

465
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:56,140
who will rip somebody a new
asshole whenever it is deserved.

466
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:59,650
He goes on and he goes and
they'd go, Steven A. Smith,

467
00:27:59,651 --> 00:28:01,390
what do you think about that?
How he just walked off?

468
00:28:01,391 --> 00:28:03,820
You see Dwight Howard looking at him like,
are you serious?

469
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,460
What do you think about that? And
Steven A. Smith was just like,

470
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:10,480
well Kobe Bryant has a
very high basketball Iq,

471
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,700
which I don't even know
what that fucking means.

472
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,240
He has a very high basketball
Iq. So what does that mean? He,

473
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:16,870
but he can't use a fork.

474
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:18,983
You know

475
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:22,670
when the guy has been the best
guy in the league for like what,

476
00:28:22,671 --> 00:28:25,430
10 12 fucking years.
But whatever.

477
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:30,470
He has a very high basketball Iq and this
is just evident evidence of the level

478
00:28:30,471 --> 00:28:33,560
of frustration the man is feeling about
the current state of the situation.

479
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,420
I mean,
Paul was Saul,

480
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:38,240
he could not hit a shot and he starts
ripping all the other fucking Lakers.

481
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:41,020
Just,

482
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:44,380
that's the type of Shit I can't fucking
stand just sitting there kissing the ass

483
00:28:44,381 --> 00:28:48,780
of a fucking star. Colby Bryant
is a fucking cancer. The guys,

484
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,940
he ran shack out of town, you know,
they want three fucking titles.

485
00:28:51,941 --> 00:28:55,170
And he still wasn't happy.
He called Rocco.

486
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:58,990
Remember that shack gone.
Goes to Miami one a title.

487
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,910
There's another one the Lakers could
have got that year. You know not,

488
00:29:01,911 --> 00:29:04,630
I don't want to win.
I'd rather have it all be me.

489
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:10,550
It's all about me, right?
He should've been benched,

490
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,790
benched for the first quarter.
The next game,

491
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,900
and this is the same guy that they
talk about in the same breath,

492
00:29:17,901 --> 00:29:20,810
is Michael Jordan, the Magic
Johnson's, the Larry Bird's.

493
00:29:20,811 --> 00:29:23,030
Let me tell you something. Those
guys never would have done that shit.

494
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:26,840
Fucking ridiculous. Fucking
ridiculous. That guy.

495
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:29,820
Can you imagine that? Nag, Nag.

496
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:34,290
Now you got to go walk in the locker
room after Colby just left, left you out.

497
00:29:34,291 --> 00:29:37,800
They're like, yeah, you guys
all suck. Go fuck yourselves.

498
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:40,680
And then you've got to walk into
the locker room and you what?

499
00:29:40,681 --> 00:29:42,130
You can't say anything to him.

500
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:45,323
Okay?

501
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:47,560
You know what they should have?
They should have fucking gone in there.

502
00:29:47,561 --> 00:29:51,460
And all of them just hung him by his
fucking shorts. Give him a big Wedgie.

503
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:59,920
How high would that Hook have to be?
I mean, what is he fucking six eight.

504
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:04,690
I mean what? Gimme a fucking,
you just walk out and it Steven.

505
00:30:04,691 --> 00:30:06,280
A Smith doesn't say anything about it.

506
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:11,410
He just starts talking about how smart
he is at the game of basketball and how

507
00:30:11,411 --> 00:30:14,470
he's really frustrated like the
other Lakers aren't frustrated.

508
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,170
Let me ask you this, like
a fence. How many fucking,

509
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:20,990
this is a great thing about lake
affairs to these fucking morons.

510
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:25,410
The very next game will
be chanting MVP at the,

511
00:30:25,411 --> 00:30:29,480
a guy who's run coaches out of town,
ran shack out of town.

512
00:30:29,481 --> 00:30:32,810
Fuck the team out of another
fucking championship. Most likely

513
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,370
it's check in his prime.
That's another thing too.

514
00:30:36,371 --> 00:30:39,850
This fucking guy has had
the Lakers organization.

515
00:30:39,851 --> 00:30:44,580
He hasn't by the short hairs
hasn't by the fucking balls.

516
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:47,100
He does whatever he wants to do.
It's embarrassing.

517
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:50,370
Then Tony should have sat him.

518
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,520
He should have walked right in
the locker room just like Colby.

519
00:30:53,521 --> 00:30:57,470
What the fuck was that?
You know this is a team.

520
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:01,550
You're not playing the first
quarter. Tomorrow night.
Hey, I don't want to hear it.

521
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:06,260
Shut your face, but once in your fucking
life. Black to say it in Italian too.

522
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,970
You know what,
he'd be a better player because of it.

523
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:15,760
They should have a team meeting
and address his continuous,

524
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:20,230
you know, and you know, he get all
emotional, you know when he does,

525
00:31:20,231 --> 00:31:24,650
when he puckers up his lips,
you know, like we did one a,

526
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:29,280
when they got beat by the Pistons or he
got beaten up in the conference finals

527
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:34,800
or that skank out and fucking nod.
Denver said the sheer they said about him,

528
00:31:34,801 --> 00:31:37,490
he had that, he did that thing
with his lips. That's what
he would do. Yeah. Colby,

529
00:31:37,491 --> 00:31:41,160
you kind of a cunt and he'd
start making that face.

530
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:44,310
Okay,

531
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:48,640
look, the guy's a beast. He wants to
win. I totally respect that. You know,

532
00:31:48,641 --> 00:31:51,540
you don't do that to your fucking
teammates and, and Steven A. Smith.

533
00:31:51,541 --> 00:31:56,400
You know what shame on you. You
have a very high broadcaster, Iq.

534
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:00,060
You know what the fuck he did and you
know why you didn't hold his feet to the

535
00:32:00,061 --> 00:32:02,390
fire. Then he'd go at fucking power. Saul,

536
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,360
you go up to the guy who looks
like a giant Kenny Loggins come on.

537
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:12,500
I Dunno. I don't like that.
I'm like that star as kicks it.

538
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:14,420
Cause you know what happens
is if you shit on him,

539
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:18,020
then you can't get the interviews
anymore. You know what I mean? Well,

540
00:32:18,021 --> 00:32:21,200
maybe he played some sort of pickup game
at your son's eight year old birthday

541
00:32:21,201 --> 00:32:23,960
party and you don't want to jeopardize
that for the nine year old birthday.

542
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:26,960
Just something going on there where I
was just, I couldn't fucking believe it.

543
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:31,460
The fucking guy walks off the
court with 10 seconds left.

544
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:36,650
Fuck all you guys. This wasn't my fault.
It's your fault. What else could it mean?

545
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,010
You guys take the fucking loss?
You

546
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:42,500
take this embarrassing gloss.
I'm above this

547
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:47,340
and Steven Aca, he has a very
high basketball. Oh my God.

548
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:52,800
Disgusting. Um, that was,
it was borderline offensive.

549
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:57,960
I never get offended. Um, all
right, here we go. Pillow Bill.

550
00:32:57,961 --> 00:33:01,950
My name is Stephanie Mallow.
Molossia.

551
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:07,740
Okay. Why did I just read your fucking
name? Well, you know what you said it, uh,

552
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:10,470
my, my fiance, my fiance and I are fans.

553
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:13,920
We saw him in New York and new haven.

554
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:17,850
I'm looking to find more information
regarding booking bill for my wedding,

555
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:20,283
uh,

556
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:24,080
in 2014.
All right.

557
00:33:24,081 --> 00:33:26,000
Now this email was sent to me because
they thought that I would think,

558
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:30,990
but this Gig was funny and was beneath
me. But a 2014 is a long ways off. So,

559
00:33:30,991 --> 00:33:31,824
uh,

560
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,210
who knows what could happen.

561
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:40,050
Okay.

562
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:44,760
No, ma'am. You know, something, there's no
way I would ever work a wedding because,

563
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:49,710
uh, just out of respect
for your grandmother and
everybody else who's got to be

564
00:33:49,711 --> 00:33:53,550
there and, uh, you know what I mean? But
I'm, I'm, I'm definitely not above it.

565
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:58,470
Long time ago, I got it. I
got to trash and from, uh,
the late great Patrice O'Neal,

566
00:33:58,471 --> 00:34:03,180
Kevin Hart, Rich Vos, Jim Norton,
murderer's row, Keith Robinson,

567
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:08,470
everybody trashed me because,
uh,

568
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:13,140
I was, I was basically debating whether
or not I was going to do this gig. It was,

569
00:34:13,141 --> 00:34:16,710
the Gig was basically, I think I've told
this before, but just for new listeners,

570
00:34:16,711 --> 00:34:18,720
I'll, I'll go through it real quick. Uh,

571
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:23,630
the Yankees were playing the Atlanta
Braves in the fucking world series.

572
00:34:23,631 --> 00:34:27,420
I'd never been to a world
series game. And, uh,

573
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:31,050
so they called up the comedy cellar
and they wanted to Comedians,

574
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:35,630
um, they wanted to, comedians to do, to

575
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:36,850
do this fucking Gig,

576
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:40,330
which was basically they'd rented two
buses and they were going to drive up to

577
00:34:40,331 --> 00:34:44,050
the stadium and they wanted a
comedian to do stand up on the bus.

578
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,390
And a, they offered it to me and Jim
Norton and me and Jim sat there going,

579
00:34:49,391 --> 00:34:51,340
are you going to do it? I'm like, I
dunno. I know you're going to do it.

580
00:34:51,341 --> 00:34:54,700
I don't know it's going to be raffled
both wanting to go to the game. So on,

581
00:34:54,701 --> 00:34:55,570
but announced to me,

582
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:59,380
he told us that he wasn't going to
fucking do it and I was still hemming and

583
00:34:59,381 --> 00:35:01,780
hawing about it and I made
fun of his shirt and he said,

584
00:35:01,781 --> 00:35:06,610
whatever busboy and the whole
fucking table stopped and
everybody was like, what?

585
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:07,991
And he goes,

586
00:35:07,991 --> 00:35:12,400
Bill Burns doing a fucking Gig on
a bus to get a world series ticket.

587
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:15,490
And there just wasn't enough time
for me. Try to explain. Well,

588
00:35:15,491 --> 00:35:18,280
I'm just contemplating it. They
offered it to him too. It was over.

589
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:23,560
And I took a fucking, like about a 50
minute pounding, 50 minutes straight,

590
00:35:23,561 --> 00:35:28,150
like a headlining set of
just getting trashed. And um,

591
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:32,230
so anyway, so they sent this fucking,
and you know what? I actually,

592
00:35:32,231 --> 00:35:34,030
I didn't end up doing the Gig,
but still I don't,

593
00:35:34,031 --> 00:35:35,360
I don't think the Gig was that bad.

594
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:38,070
A gig that would have been
such easy fucking Gig.

595
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:42,900
You just get on the bus and
you just trashed the Yankees
and when you run out of

596
00:35:42,901 --> 00:35:45,630
Shit, you make fun of somebody on,
hey look and look at the tits on her.

597
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:49,440
That's all you'd have to dope.
You make fun of yourself.

598
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:52,050
This has got to be the girl.
You know,

599
00:35:52,051 --> 00:35:54,240
a lot of you are probably
thinking this is a horrible,

600
00:35:54,241 --> 00:35:56,130
this is one of the greatest gains.
Just make fun of that.

601
00:35:56,131 --> 00:36:00,410
This is actually a good gig in your
career. You could be drinking with them,

602
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:04,070
having a chance,
fucked a Yag fuck the Gado.

603
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:06,780
Just get them genuinely yell at other
people on the site. You can just,

604
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:09,300
anything to distract you.

605
00:36:09,301 --> 00:36:13,830
Just filibuster for fucking 20 minute
ride up there and you go to world series

606
00:36:13,831 --> 00:36:17,590
game for free. I stand
by it. I stand by it.

607
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:21,660
I still don't think it was a bad gig,
although the person who did the Gig,

608
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:25,890
but he was less experienced than me
who actually maybe I'll have him on the

609
00:36:25,891 --> 00:36:29,280
podcast someday.
He actually has his own TV show right now.

610
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,250
See that and I don't,

611
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:38,470
so there was magic on that bus. He
actually did it and I finally, I told him,

612
00:36:38,471 --> 00:36:42,220
I took the pounding and uh,
you know,

613
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:46,480
took it like a champ.
Just sat there and took it fucking killed.

614
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:50,860
Killed me for 50 fucking minutes and
I never gave up his name. I was like,

615
00:36:50,861 --> 00:36:52,900
that guy in casino getting is.
I popped out.

616
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:56,680
I didn't even bring it up that I actually,
I could have just said,

617
00:36:56,681 --> 00:36:59,080
I'm not doing the Gig.
I gave it to somebody else.

618
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:04,690
Well maybe I hadn't given it to him
at that point had I, I can't remember.

619
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,730
I just remember the end. I was still
gonna do it until it finally it died down.

620
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:14,950
And Patrice just said to me, Bill, he
goes, I will stand in front of that bus.

621
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:20,710
You can't do that Gig. All right. You want
to go to the world series, buy a ticket.

622
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:22,600
And I was just like,
wow,

623
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:26,970
I guess I should have some sort of
fucking self esteem smash cut to four

624
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,820
fucking eight years later,
10 whatever.

625
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:33,200
How many years it isn't being
offered a wedding gig. Um,
yeah, I'm going to say no,

626
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:38,210
I'm just, because even
even if, uh, you know,

627
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:41,720
I needed to fill the calendar, it's just
like, it's your wedding day. You want it,

628
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:45,260
you want it to be nice. You
don't want somebody going,
I mean, you just saw my act.

629
00:37:45,261 --> 00:37:46,280
You saw what I talked about.

630
00:37:46,281 --> 00:37:50,840
I'm talking about the fucking apocalypse
and people eating puppies. I mean, you,

631
00:37:50,841 --> 00:37:52,970
you really want me to,
I don't have like a wedding set.

632
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:54,150
If that's what you're asking me,

633
00:37:57,470 --> 00:38:02,210
I really wouldn't know. Uh, I
really wouldn't know what to do. So,

634
00:38:02,211 --> 00:38:04,730
uh, but I'm, I'm great. I'm glad
that you had a good time. Uh,

635
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,790
that new haven Gig was the shit. And
that's something I definitely want to do.

636
00:38:07,791 --> 00:38:10,340
Again, like I said, I want to come
back for the Harvard Yale game,

637
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:13,610
go to a home game there and I just
want to listen in to some of the

638
00:38:13,611 --> 00:38:18,200
conversations and who knows. I'll
probably be sitting next to a, one of the,

639
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:23,090
a future president or maybe someone who's
in the future will be the guy who has

640
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:28,070
the on Hai like cloaked road
before he stabs at Virgin.

641
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,780
It's some sort of Bilderberg
cookout. Um, alright, apocalypse.

642
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:37,460
Hello billion. I am dedicated podcast
listener. I'm a big fan of, I do.

643
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:42,130
I've noticed your recent
musings on preparing for the
apocalypse, buying guns. He,

644
00:38:42,131 --> 00:38:43,090
I haven't done any of it.

645
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:46,660
I just think about doing it and the Nia
just looks at me and just shakes her

646
00:38:46,661 --> 00:38:49,120
head like you're out of your
fucking mind. Uh, buying guns,

647
00:38:49,121 --> 00:38:52,930
learning how to hunt and survive when
the inevitable human population bubble

648
00:38:52,931 --> 00:38:56,050
bursts and we run out of food and water.
Uh,

649
00:38:56,051 --> 00:38:58,270
well I don't think that's
going to happen anytime soon.

650
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:03,220
It eventually will happen and it may very
well happen within my lifetime. Okay.

651
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:04,380
Okay.

652
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:07,720
Well I guess you plan on living a long
time then sir. Um, cause you're like,

653
00:39:07,721 --> 00:39:09,390
I don't think is going to
happen to it at anytime soon,

654
00:39:09,391 --> 00:39:12,330
but probably in my lifetime.
When you think that, you know,

655
00:39:12,331 --> 00:39:16,650
when the overall history of how long
man has walked the planet and woman,

656
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:20,760
that that's kind of soon we've been
around how long we've been around.

657
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:22,860
Okay.

658
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:26,860
A hundred thousand years. I don't
fucking know. We'll leave it at,

659
00:39:26,861 --> 00:39:28,000
we have been around that long.
Have we?

660
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:31,390
Jesus was walking the
earth 2000 years ago.

661
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:32,880
Okay.

662
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,950
He didn't have an iPad or the fuck he did.

663
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:38,130
They went to kill him.
Did they,

664
00:39:38,131 --> 00:39:40,710
did they use a lethal
injection or electric chair?

665
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:43,920
They tied them to a fucking stake

666
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:48,780
if you believe in that stuff, you
know, I'm not trying to offend anybody.

667
00:39:48,781 --> 00:39:50,160
Some people don't
believe it even happened,

668
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,620
so people only believe
that the guy even existed.

669
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:57,180
Some people think it was just all made up.
I'm not trying to offend anybody,

670
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,313
you know?

671
00:39:58,980 --> 00:39:59,813
Yeah.

672
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:04,750
Anyways, like you, I grew up in a big
city with the, with middleclass parents,

673
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:09,010
relatively sheltered and didn't learn
a lot of the basic survival skills as a

674
00:40:09,011 --> 00:40:13,420
kid, as an adult with children.
I think it's vital capitals,

675
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:17,980
vital that they learn basic fundamental
skills of survival, building a fire,

676
00:40:17,981 --> 00:40:20,320
making shelter, hunting, et cetera.

677
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:24,400
I picked up hunting as an adult
and I have to say it has changed my

678
00:40:24,401 --> 00:40:28,660
understanding of the nature of the natural
world man's role as a Predator on the

679
00:40:28,661 --> 00:40:33,370
planet. How we evolve, where
we fit in, et cetera. Um,

680
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:35,440
I cannot underscore the appreciation.

681
00:40:35,441 --> 00:40:38,600
You will have a who actually get
out there and harvest your own food.

682
00:40:38,601 --> 00:40:40,930
Do you have to use the word harvest
when you killing a living thing?

683
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:43,420
That's really creepy to me.
Just say,

684
00:40:43,421 --> 00:40:47,900
fucking blow the brains
out of a fucking elk. Um,

685
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:52,510
prepare it and then feed yourself and
your loved ones. It's an experience.

686
00:40:52,511 --> 00:40:56,620
Someone who sees the world as you
do, we'll surely appreciate. Yeah,

687
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:58,300
I think that's awesome.
But what am I going to do?

688
00:40:58,301 --> 00:41:01,540
Am I gonna I'm gonna go shoot a fucking
deer and then tie it to the front of my

689
00:41:01,541 --> 00:41:05,050
Prius and drive back down to la.
Do you understand what will happen to me?

690
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,180
I'll fucking liberal it is out here.

691
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:08,990
Yeah.

692
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:12,560
I'll get fucking stabbed to death with
horse shoes on Hollywood boulevard.

693
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:19,430
Um,
if you want to get really back to basics,

694
00:41:19,431 --> 00:41:21,200
you should learn to hunt without a gun.

695
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:26,100
I actually think that's cool.
Hunting without a gun is great.

696
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:30,660
You said bullets make life easy. I,
I keep the bullets for a, for people.

697
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:34,940
Um, you said bullets make life easy,
but when the shit really hits the fan,

698
00:41:34,941 --> 00:41:37,910
you're going to need to save those bullets
in all likelihood of protect yourself

699
00:41:37,911 --> 00:41:39,800
from, yeah, it's from other
people actually already read that.

700
00:41:39,801 --> 00:41:43,130
So maybe his idea was already in
my head. Uh, don't kid yourself.

701
00:41:43,131 --> 00:41:46,550
The most dangerous animal on the planet
is a hungry human who wants what you

702
00:41:46,551 --> 00:41:50,810
have. Forget about lions, bears, et
Cetera. They don't compare. Yeah,

703
00:41:50,811 --> 00:41:53,750
that's God damn right.
I don't live next to a lion,

704
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:57,670
but I lived next to a
bunch of human beings. Um,

705
00:41:57,770 --> 00:42:01,460
learn to hunt with a bow and arrow.
The arrows are recoverable and reusable.

706
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:03,080
If you want to get really fancy,

707
00:42:03,081 --> 00:42:07,670
you have someone take you out to hunt
with dogs or birds of prey or both?

708
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:12,530
Dude, I got to say, birds of prey freaked
me out. They really freaked me out.

709
00:42:12,531 --> 00:42:17,150
They just a, they don't look,
they're not domesticated.

710
00:42:17,151 --> 00:42:19,340
I don't like how you to
put like that fucking uh,

711
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,690
special needs helmet over their
fucking heads or else they'll,

712
00:42:23,691 --> 00:42:26,840
I don't know what they'll do now.
Like those talents.

713
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:30,170
It's like they got a butterfly
knife attached to both foot.

714
00:42:30,171 --> 00:42:33,380
They like Freddy Krueger and just one day,
I don't know what's going to happen.

715
00:42:33,381 --> 00:42:37,640
You know, they confuse my face with some
sort of red chested Robin or something.

716
00:42:37,641 --> 00:42:41,060
I don't know. Clot my eyes. Um,

717
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:46,070
and they always look angry.
Like Apple's always looked pissed off,

718
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:51,780
you know, it's got that Dan did offline
right above his nose, his beak. I mean,

719
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:56,280
by the way, just in case you think
I'm a fringe Wacko, a Wackadoo.

720
00:42:56,780 --> 00:43:01,260
I am a board certified physician and my
wife went to both medical school and law

721
00:43:01,261 --> 00:43:04,710
school. Well, that really did
improve anything, sir. You
just said that by the way,

722
00:43:04,711 --> 00:43:08,970
if you think, and if you think I'm crazy.
Uh, I also flew the space shuttle, sir.

723
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:13,710
Um, well tell me how do I do,
where do I learn how to hunt?

724
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:16,010
Okay.

725
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:18,500
I want to, you know what I want
to kill? I want to kill a varmint.

726
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:21,260
I could kill a varmint.
Um,

727
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:28,440
could I though? I'd have to be
really hungry. I know. I could do it.

728
00:43:28,441 --> 00:43:30,690
Anybody could do it.
You just have to be hungry enough.

729
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:32,790
Okay.

730
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:35,880
Unless she knew about berries,
you know.

731
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:41,640
Oh, wouldn't it be the worst you
fucking out in the wilderness, right?

732
00:43:41,641 --> 00:43:43,320
And you don't know how
to survive our hunt,

733
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:46,830
but you're with somebody out there
who knows how to survive and is like a

734
00:43:46,831 --> 00:43:51,480
fucking Vegan and you're just sitting
there eating nuts and berries and shit.

735
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:54,000
Right.
Stick in your face in a beehive,

736
00:43:54,001 --> 00:43:57,150
trying to look up some honey getting stung
in the face like a goddamn brown bear

737
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:59,220
instead of just killing a rabbit.

738
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:00,840
Okay?

739
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:03,300
And you guys got to deal with this guy.
You know what happened? Eventually,

740
00:44:03,301 --> 00:44:04,800
eventually you just,
you just,

741
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:09,660
you pick up a branch per tenant was like
a walking stick and you just the club

742
00:44:09,661 --> 00:44:14,070
over the head just in a
moment of frustration and
then have that panic of being

743
00:44:14,071 --> 00:44:16,080
alone in the wilderness,
not knowing how to get out.

744
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:17,800
Yeah.

745
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,700
Did I just pitch a short film?
Um,

746
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:25,210
you know,

747
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:28,210
I smoked a cigar last night and I got
like third of the way through it and I was

748
00:44:28,211 --> 00:44:30,820
like, I'm done with this fucking
habit. Now I got a stupid fucking,

749
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:35,500
what do you call those things? Human
door. Anybody want to fucking humidor?

750
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,353
You just want one.

751
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:39,210
You want to just take this fucking
disgusting habit out of my life.

752
00:44:39,211 --> 00:44:41,340
I don't want to do it anymore.
You know,

753
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:44,070
it's fucking horrific to
horrific fucking habit.

754
00:44:44,071 --> 00:44:47,520
You know how I know it is because
there's not a bad smell to a dog.

755
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:52,500
Dog will walk up to another up dogs fresh
pile of shit and stick his nose right

756
00:44:52,501 --> 00:44:56,340
in it and can have it there. It
doesn't gag or anything. All right.

757
00:44:56,370 --> 00:44:58,890
If I'm sitting there with my cigar
and won't come anywhere near me.

758
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:04,800
Now what does that tell you? Said
gars smell worse than poodle. Shit.

759
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:09,610
Okay. All right. The truth behind
pink a bill, you should check out the,

760
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:12,660
the outer documentary
titled Pink Ribbons Ink.

761
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:16,680
It discusses the culture and popularity
of breast cancer awareness month while

762
00:45:16,681 --> 00:45:20,250
exposing some of the hypocrisy
involved in case you don't watch it.

763
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:21,720
Let me give you a couple of highlights.

764
00:45:21,721 --> 00:45:25,620
You can talk about the film
without actually having seen
it. Well, thank you sir.

765
00:45:25,621 --> 00:45:28,770
You got right down to the core of
who I am. Give me the cliff notes.

766
00:45:28,771 --> 00:45:32,490
What do we got here?
Why do we got here? Um,

767
00:45:32,491 --> 00:45:35,820
the woman that invented the pink
rhythm as a method to raise awareness

768
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:41,520
quickly. One of the most annoying
phrases out there raising awareness.

769
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:44,560
Could it be any more fucking vague,

770
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:51,240
vague. Cheevan I am aware it's breast
cancer awareness month. I got it.

771
00:45:51,241 --> 00:45:53,250
Everyone's in the NFL is wearing pink.

772
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:57,570
I am aware job done now nobody can fuck
with all the money that you took in.

773
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:59,670
Is that the loophole?
That's what I'm trying to guess.

774
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:02,160
Then you go out and you and you,
you buy a,

775
00:46:02,161 --> 00:46:06,030
a pink Bentley but they can't
get you cause it's pink, right.

776
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:09,540
I'm raising awareness.
Okay.

777
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:12,720
And I spent this amount of money
on this car to show how theory,

778
00:46:12,721 --> 00:46:16,890
if the problem is, um, raise
awareness with breast cancer at a,

779
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:21,720
was approached by self, sorry,
the woman that invented the, uh,

780
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:24,780
the, the, the shit was, uh,
approached by the magazine,

781
00:46:24,781 --> 00:46:29,781
self magazine aimed at
the ladies and s the SD.

782
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:35,580
Estee Lauder, Estee Lauder,
Esther. How do you say that?

783
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:37,350
Estee.
Estee Lauder.

784
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,290
That's one of those things I've heard
people say it's lean times. So it just,

785
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:43,940
I don't know, in the early nineties, uh,

786
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:47,430
to partner with these corporations
knowing that these greedy costs were only

787
00:46:47,431 --> 00:46:50,250
interested in the pink room as a
way to increase their bottom line.

788
00:46:50,251 --> 00:46:53,160
The creator of the original
pink ribbon refuse to correct,

789
00:46:53,161 --> 00:46:57,630
collaborate and told self and
Estee Lauder, Estee Lauder, uh,

790
00:46:57,631 --> 00:46:58,920
to go fuck themselves.

791
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:03,210
So these corporate fucks created a pink
ribbon that was technically a different

792
00:47:03,211 --> 00:47:06,240
color and the pink saturation began.

793
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:10,470
Another interesting point the
film makes is that companies like,

794
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:14,160
why did you have to pick Estee Lauder?
I just set it right. Estee Lauder.

795
00:47:14,161 --> 00:47:17,430
There it is. Promote breast
cancer awareness by turning pink.

796
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:22,820
The labels of products that contain
carcinogens isn't that fucking hilarious.

797
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,970
Uh, of the money that buying
all this pink shit raises,

798
00:47:26,971 --> 00:47:31,971
apparently only 15% of it is used for
researching prevention of breast cancer.

799
00:47:32,531 --> 00:47:36,400
Most of the research goes to figuring
out which cancer drugs work best for

800
00:47:36,401 --> 00:47:38,710
treating the disease once it occurs.
Yeah.

801
00:47:38,711 --> 00:47:42,640
And nothing preventative because
the money is not in the cure.

802
00:47:42,850 --> 00:47:45,460
It's in the treatment.
Anyway,

803
00:47:45,461 --> 00:47:49,030
check out the movie pink Ribbon Inc
it's available on Netflix instant.

804
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:51,610
Thanks for the podcast and all the
free funny. Well you're welcome

805
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:55,190
sir. Um, yeah, yeah. I mean,

806
00:47:55,191 --> 00:47:58,170
I'm at that read that
book that I'm reading. Uh,

807
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:01,220
I may take it for whatever you want. I
mean, obviously I'm not a nutritionist,

808
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:02,180
but the,
uh,

809
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:07,040
that eat to live book where it talks about
vegetables and that type of thing and

810
00:48:07,041 --> 00:48:11,580
uh, and fruits and all the,
uh, antioxidants and how it,

811
00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:15,140
I know it helps regenerate some damaged
cells from all the shit that you do.

812
00:48:15,290 --> 00:48:17,060
Yeah.
I really believe it just once a day,

813
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:20,900
if you just have a giant fucking salad
and eat a couple pieces of fruit,

814
00:48:20,901 --> 00:48:24,020
you can offset all that other stuff
because I got to tell you there's no way

815
00:48:25,310 --> 00:48:29,390
I'm ever going to a 100%, uh, just never
have a steak again. You know what I mean?

816
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:34,310
Sorry. It's just some steer out there
that's going to have to fucking die.

817
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:36,290
By the way.
Why do they have that in the commercial?

818
00:48:36,291 --> 00:48:38,450
Why do they have a cow saying,
eat more chicken?

819
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:41,140
They don't feed your cows.

820
00:48:41,141 --> 00:48:46,141
It steers and a steer is basically a bowl
with its ball's locked off as far as I

821
00:48:46,391 --> 00:48:46,751
can tell.

822
00:48:46,751 --> 00:48:51,480
That's what I was told back in the day
when I would do college gigs and a,

823
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:55,840
I would see both randomly see a ball and
I would see a bunch of cows and then I

824
00:48:55,841 --> 00:48:59,950
would see stare and I'd be like, all
right, a bulls, a male, a cow's a female,

825
00:48:59,951 --> 00:49:01,030
what the fuck is a steer?

826
00:49:01,031 --> 00:49:03,250
And they've said it was a bowl
with the balls lopped off.

827
00:49:03,790 --> 00:49:07,850
So I'm one of the like Unix. They don't
hit puberty. I don't fucking know.

828
00:49:07,851 --> 00:49:12,310
But anyways. Um, next
question here on the podcast,

829
00:49:12,370 --> 00:49:16,150
a Gyno gain. Oh, hey bill,

830
00:49:16,350 --> 00:49:20,830
what's your opinion on this?
My wife recently had a Gyno
appointment. I hate that.

831
00:49:20,831 --> 00:49:25,480
Just gynecologist gain or makes it
sound like it's all goopy and gross.

832
00:49:26,150 --> 00:49:28,960
It's disgusting.
But that's what I think.

833
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:34,720
A gynecological appointment
as a thoughtful husband,

834
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:38,890
I remembered. So later in the day
I casually asked my wife, hey,

835
00:49:38,891 --> 00:49:42,520
how'd the appointment go? She said, the
doctor said, everything looks great.

836
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:45,940
I was incredulous.
I don't know what that means,

837
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:50,860
but I think it means you're
upset. He said, I said, what?
What did he say? She said,

838
00:49:50,861 --> 00:49:55,720
he said, everything looks great.
I said, no, no, no, no, no,
no. Wait, wait, wait. Really?

839
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:59,530
Really? What? What? What were his,
his, his exact words? She said,

840
00:49:59,531 --> 00:50:04,510
those were his exact words. Everything
looks great. Then he writes,

841
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:07,390
motherfucker, are you kidding me, Bill?

842
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:11,470
Does that comment seemed completely
unprofessional. You, I mean,

843
00:50:11,471 --> 00:50:14,140
he's a freaking doctor.
He should have said something like,

844
00:50:14,230 --> 00:50:18,520
everything looks in order or everything
looks healthy. These God damn doctors.

845
00:50:18,521 --> 00:50:22,150
Remember that doctor man. See any
from Melrose place. He was a real sob.

846
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:23,440
They're all like that.

847
00:50:23,530 --> 00:50:28,360
Especially these creepy guy knows
what kind of becomes a Gyno.

848
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:33,170
Stop saying that word,
sir. The fuck is this?

849
00:50:34,790 --> 00:50:35,271
What the fuck?

850
00:50:35,271 --> 00:50:38,030
Just popped up on my goddamn computer
in the middle of a critical moment.

851
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:41,140
Get the fuck Outta here.
Um, anyways, get back to,

852
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:45,110
plus my wife is very attractive and now
he's telling her that her pussy looks

853
00:50:45,111 --> 00:50:49,790
great.
The guy says,

854
00:50:49,791 --> 00:50:53,570
Hey, I know a pussy looks great.
That's part of why I married her.

855
00:50:54,170 --> 00:50:56,090
We're really fucking frost me though,

856
00:50:56,150 --> 00:51:00,440
is that I had to pay this guy 50
a $50 copay for his observation.

857
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:04,910
It's like he's laughing at me anyway.
What do you think about all that?

858
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:08,950
And I wouldn't mind knee
is a opinion as well. Uh,

859
00:51:08,990 --> 00:51:10,430
should I get involved here?

860
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:11,860
Yeah.

861
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:15,340
Thanks. Don't mention my name.
All right. All right. Um,

862
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:17,860
okay.

863
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:18,850
You know what you,

864
00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:24,030
what you should do is just do what you
just did to me because what you say it is

865
00:51:24,071 --> 00:51:24,904
funny.

866
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:29,800
Did you just say it to your wife in a
funny way and just be, and just be like,

867
00:51:29,801 --> 00:51:31,960
what? Who, what does this guy look like?

868
00:51:31,961 --> 00:51:34,270
Does he look like this doctor
[inaudible] from Melrose place?

869
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:38,890
I don't know what he looks like, but
that guy sounds like a fucking sleazebag,

870
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:40,583
you know?

871
00:51:41,430 --> 00:51:42,060
Yeah.

872
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:45,780
Why does he get to just look at
you? You know, I had to buy a ring.

873
00:51:45,781 --> 00:51:48,510
I had a wine and dine United
to do all this type of stuff.

874
00:51:48,511 --> 00:51:51,780
I actually love you and I only
see it a couple of times a month.

875
00:51:51,810 --> 00:51:54,450
You'll get on there
for not just something,

876
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:58,170
there's gotta be something funny though,
because there is something actually, uh,

877
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:00,840
um, I don't know, women
might not agree with this,

878
00:52:00,841 --> 00:52:04,600
but there's something caring about this,
you know,

879
00:52:05,470 --> 00:52:07,860
I see how much, you know,
you're into your wife,

880
00:52:07,870 --> 00:52:11,850
you don't like some other guy just looking
at it without saying something. Ah,

881
00:52:11,950 --> 00:52:16,450
you know, ah, shit, my
fucking phone. Who is this?

882
00:52:16,451 --> 00:52:20,740
Who is this and what do you want them
in the middle of talking about Gyno? Um,

883
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,070
yeah, I think, you know, if
your wife's a hot shit, she'll,

884
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:27,730
she'll get a kick out of it. Like that's
the kind of thing that would make a,

885
00:52:28,950 --> 00:52:29,360
yeah,

886
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:33,500
that would make me laugh if I ever
said something like that. Oh yeah.

887
00:52:33,530 --> 00:52:37,220
How long was he checking you out?
Did he have you lay on your belly?

888
00:52:39,970 --> 00:52:40,800
Okay.

889
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:44,640
Yeah, I gotta check the other side
of the, uh, the, uh, your vagina,

890
00:52:44,641 --> 00:52:48,990
just a on your belt is lay on your belly
and sort of, uh, just point your, your,

891
00:52:48,991 --> 00:52:52,170
your buttocks. They've used like those,
those words, so it didn't sound perverted,

892
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:57,440
you know, at the ceiling. Um,
oh, speaking of perverted,

893
00:52:58,630 --> 00:53:00,140
I can't even get into this.

894
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:02,000
Yeah.

895
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Let's just say early on the podcast I
mentioned that I went to something and saw

896
00:53:07,761 --> 00:53:11,090
some people that hadn't
seen in a long time and uh,

897
00:53:12,410 --> 00:53:14,400
let's just say,
uh,

898
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:18,710
some older creep from the faculty
showed up for whatever fucking reason.

899
00:53:20,790 --> 00:53:21,623
You know,

900
00:53:23,370 --> 00:53:25,440
there's always one.
There's one,

901
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:31,210
um, creepy. Okay.
Overrated, underrated, um,

902
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:36,570
underrated. Ah, going to your
high school reunion, Eh, uh,

903
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:40,030
overrated. Getting fucking blitzed
at your high school. If you,

904
00:53:40,070 --> 00:53:42,080
I think if you'd like, you have
your five year, your 10 year,

905
00:53:42,081 --> 00:53:44,650
you can go in there and get a little bit.
Fuck, you definitely get drunk at your,

906
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:49,440
your five year, 25 year. You know, you
get a nice little buzz going plus a,

907
00:53:49,441 --> 00:53:51,870
you know, I don't know if you'd like
the kids you went to school with.

908
00:53:51,871 --> 00:53:54,240
You want to be able to remember what
the fuck he said. You know, anyways,

909
00:53:54,241 --> 00:53:57,180
underrated.
Having a tight ass for a boss.

910
00:53:57,630 --> 00:54:00,780
As much as everyone wishes that
their boss wasn't such an asshole.

911
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:04,170
It's about 20 times worse to have
a cool boss that cuts corner,

912
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:07,890
cuts corners and doesn't do their part.
Yeah.

913
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:12,120
Then the company goes under and then you
looking for work. Um, overrated. Bill.

914
00:54:12,121 --> 00:54:14,340
Whenever you see a list of
the greatest movies ever made,

915
00:54:14,341 --> 00:54:17,250
you will always see gone with
the wind on that list. Right?

916
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:20,850
My family and I decided to watch it
for the first time on Thanksgiving.

917
00:54:20,851 --> 00:54:22,380
It was fucking horrible.

918
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:26,610
It's basically a three hour movie
about a self centered content

919
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:29,731
throughout the movie.

920
00:54:29,731 --> 00:54:34,470
You watched this bitch gold dig her way
through without any remorse for anyone

921
00:54:34,471 --> 00:54:39,150
else besides the protagonist
being unlikely unlikable.

922
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:43,710
The plot is fucking stupid. It really
has no point. When the movie ended,

923
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:46,920
I yelled, that's it. That's
the big fucking ending.

924
00:54:47,490 --> 00:54:49,980
Avoid at all costs.
None of us liked it.

925
00:54:51,170 --> 00:54:52,040
Uh,

926
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:57,690
I got it. I have to watch it now. Is
that the one we ends? Frankly, my dear,

927
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:02,550
I don't give a damn. That was basically
the 1940s version of saying, yeah,

928
00:55:02,551 --> 00:55:04,200
why don't you go fuck
yourself? You cunt. All right.

929
00:55:04,201 --> 00:55:05,320
You've got to be old and you too.

930
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,960
You're going to fall. And then
where are you going to be? Huh?

931
00:55:08,690 --> 00:55:11,730
Do you hear teased up on all those goddamn
noodles sitting here on the fucking

932
00:55:11,731 --> 00:55:16,560
plantation? What are you gonna do
then? Not even the non hired help.

933
00:55:16,561 --> 00:55:20,320
I'll listen to you. So go fuck yourself
right there as soon to be flabby. Tits.

934
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:25,450
Okay? If you're not coming with
love, all you got to, you looks okay.

935
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:29,590
There's no botox at this point in,
in, in, in history. You're finished.

936
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:30,893
All right?

937
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:34,930
So why don't you get over here and suck
this Dick while you still can and then

938
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:38,860
[inaudible] and they roll the
fucking credits. All right,
Neil. Log preview here.

939
00:55:38,890 --> 00:55:43,690
Everybody. Um, this was sent to me.
Hey, build, love the podcast back.

940
00:55:43,691 --> 00:55:46,750
Cataloguing it like crazy. Thank
you. Here's my fucking problem.

941
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:49,990
I got a roommate who was wonderful.
We're buddies.

942
00:55:51,190 --> 00:55:54,040
We watched stupid shit. You know
what? Fuck this. I gotta make this.

943
00:55:54,041 --> 00:55:57,490
I gotta make this larger. This
print is too small. Here we go.

944
00:55:57,491 --> 00:56:01,960
I've actually learned how to do this.
Select everything. Uh, go up here.

945
00:56:01,961 --> 00:56:03,280
Go from 12.

946
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:05,690
Okay,

947
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:09,790
let's make it fucking 18 like a
grandmother. There we go. All right.

948
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,420
I got a roommate who's wonderful.
We're buddies.

949
00:56:13,510 --> 00:56:17,460
We watch stupid shit and left
together about it. All right. Uh,

950
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:22,150
he's got this girlfriend who's a drain
on everything that is fun in the world.

951
00:56:22,390 --> 00:56:26,110
I'm not talking the regular guy, girl
argument crap. I mean, everything.

952
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:26,980
Quick example,

953
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:32,350
we were watching that BBC planet Earth
series and we just joking at the most

954
00:56:32,351 --> 00:56:34,450
beautiful shit in the world,
literally,

955
00:56:34,451 --> 00:56:38,500
and all she could do is bitch
about how ugly the birds were.

956
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:42,850
Complained about David Attenborough's
voice or get mad at some animal just

957
00:56:42,851 --> 00:56:47,050
because it's killing another animal
to fucking survive. After we finished,

958
00:56:47,051 --> 00:56:51,850
she said she would love to be on the
crew of a nature documentary shoot.

959
00:56:52,510 --> 00:56:56,440
She's got no soul. The guy loves her.
They'd been together for over a year,

960
00:56:56,680 --> 00:57:01,480
but it's so clear he can't stand to
be around her. They only ever argue,

961
00:57:03,030 --> 00:57:03,640
okay.

962
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:07,270
Oh, they only argue and not in that great
way that you and Nia did in one of the

963
00:57:07,271 --> 00:57:11,470
podcasts where you all laughed
with each other. It's unbearable.

964
00:57:11,471 --> 00:57:14,980
And she's at my apartment five days a
week. Yeah, dude, you know something.

965
00:57:15,010 --> 00:57:15,491
I get it.

966
00:57:15,491 --> 00:57:18,280
You're in a relationship but either
move in with this bitch or let's have a

967
00:57:18,281 --> 00:57:22,240
fucking two days here,
two days there. You know,

968
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:25,240
you got eight home games a year,
you got eight away games in the NFL.

969
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:28,660
Let's try to set it up the same
fucking way. So this is like baseball.

970
00:57:28,810 --> 00:57:33,640
At some point you got to have a fucking
road trip. Okay. There's sport. Um,

971
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:34,061
anyways,

972
00:57:34,061 --> 00:57:38,890
most nights I eventually either drink
or smoke or just so I'm not in the same

973
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:43,600
world as her and I like
smoking. Who am I kidding? Uh,

974
00:57:43,601 --> 00:57:46,180
I want to talk to him about it,
but he's a really private guy.

975
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:48,920
We've never talked about his
relationship stuff. He stands to tea,

976
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:50,470
tends to steer away from it.

977
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:53,650
It's becoming pretty obvious
that I can't stand this girl,

978
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:57,310
nor can any of our friends. I'm afraid
that she's going to drive us apart.

979
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,470
Then feast on his soul. She, she,

980
00:57:59,471 --> 00:58:02,470
she can try and find some kind
of personality for herself.

981
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:04,960
How do you think I should
approach this with this guy?

982
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:09,670
I got a right to complain to him about
this girl, right. Got To do a tender,

983
00:58:09,671 --> 00:58:13,030
Leah something. Um, all
right. This is the deal.

984
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:16,390
I almost started singing
when a man loves a woman,

985
00:58:16,391 --> 00:58:17,470
but I'm not going to do that to you.

986
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:18,960
Okay.

987
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:23,350
But it's true. Okay.
When a man loves a woman,

988
00:58:24,490 --> 00:58:25,870
no other way to get into this point.

989
00:58:26,950 --> 00:58:30,240
I can't believe I was able to say
that without singing it. Uh, even,

990
00:58:30,241 --> 00:58:34,480
even I as much as bad as I sing, no,
I can't even, you want me to do it?

991
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:35,983
All right.

992
00:58:36,390 --> 00:58:37,223
Wow.

993
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:40,210
Um,

994
00:58:40,210 --> 00:58:45,210
there's no fucking way you can approach,

995
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:51,090
um, the country things that
annoy you about them. Well,

996
00:58:51,091 --> 00:58:56,091
you have to do is just walk into another
room and just like literally just grab

997
00:58:56,581 --> 00:58:59,430
a pillow off of the couch.
You know,

998
00:58:59,431 --> 00:59:01,980
after she says something and you just
walk in the other room, you just go,

999
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:03,153
yeah.

1000
00:59:04,390 --> 00:59:07,740
And then you just come back in and he go,
oh, so what are you major in? All right.

1001
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:09,610
You just do that.

1002
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:15,220
But you do have a right as a roommate
to have some sort of parameters,

1003
00:59:15,910 --> 00:59:20,810
all right? The problem is, is you've
let it get out of control. All right?

1004
00:59:22,590 --> 00:59:26,970
So here's the deal. Either this dude's
going to marry this girl or he isn't,

1005
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:32,850
okay. He's going to marry this girl. Your
guys, your friendship is fucking over.

1006
00:59:32,851 --> 00:59:35,760
You're not going to hang out with him
cause he's, he's with this colossal cunt.

1007
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:38,430
You're gonna meet somebody else.
Then eventually you're gonna get married.

1008
00:59:38,431 --> 00:59:41,310
You can have kids, you barely gonna
have time to see this person anyways,

1009
00:59:41,730 --> 00:59:45,990
even if you liked his wife, okay.
But the fact that she's a cunt,

1010
00:59:45,991 --> 00:59:50,280
she's just going to fade out anyways,
okay? So there's nothing to worry about.

1011
00:59:50,281 --> 00:59:54,450
They're losing this friendship.
If he's going to marry this girl,

1012
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:57,900
it's fucking overdue. Okay.
It's a done deal. All right?

1013
00:59:58,520 --> 00:59:59,353
MMM.

1014
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,160
And if he's eventually going
to break up with their,

1015
01:00:02,170 --> 01:00:03,490
whatever you're going to say to him now,

1016
01:00:03,491 --> 01:00:06,340
he's eventually going to come around and
he's going to be saying all this shit

1017
01:00:06,341 --> 01:00:08,290
that you're going to say to
him or want to say to him.

1018
01:00:08,291 --> 01:00:11,620
So you don't need to say it.
You just get you all.

1019
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:15,310
What you really have to deal with right
now is just trying to cut down the

1020
01:00:15,311 --> 01:00:17,860
amount of time that,
that fucking, that, that,

1021
01:00:17,861 --> 01:00:22,600
that hell content comes into
your apartment five days a week.

1022
01:00:22,601 --> 01:00:26,470
Dude, I don't care if you even
like to just say, listen. Um,

1023
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:31,600
I respect you and your relationship.
You know, I'm really happy for you.

1024
01:00:31,601 --> 01:00:34,270
You seem really happy,
but you know,

1025
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:39,820
it's just a gel. This is fucking hard.
She's coming over here five days a week.

1026
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:42,190
Ken,
is there any way you can,

1027
01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:46,680
you can kind of cut that in half
a couple of nights over her place.

1028
01:00:46,681 --> 01:00:47,720
Because I like to come out here,

1029
01:00:47,730 --> 01:00:51,120
like to smoke a fucking bomb and
I like to watch the fucking TV.

1030
01:00:51,270 --> 01:00:54,900
What are they do? You could
do though what you do? Ah,

1031
01:00:56,070 --> 01:00:57,180
yeah, but she's, I,

1032
01:00:57,290 --> 01:01:02,290
I like to do it in a country atmosphere
that has no fucking way to do this.

1033
01:01:03,850 --> 01:01:04,683
MMM.

1034
01:01:05,810 --> 01:01:08,120
You know what, you just basically
going to have to ask yourself,

1035
01:01:08,121 --> 01:01:12,920
what's more important to you,
your friendship with this guy or you're,

1036
01:01:12,921 --> 01:01:13,754
you're fucking,

1037
01:01:16,170 --> 01:01:17,003
you know,

1038
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:21,440
your ability to fucking have a beer and
smoke a joint without this bitch fucking

1039
01:01:21,441 --> 01:01:26,240
ruined and you, you, you know, five nights
a week. Okay, I would suggest this. Okay.

1040
01:01:26,241 --> 01:01:28,460
If you still want to be friends with this
guy, he didn't want to rock the boat,

1041
01:01:28,461 --> 01:01:32,330
then I would look for another place to
live if you could, which is fucking sucks.

1042
01:01:32,331 --> 01:01:34,820
You got to pay to move. But I'm telling
you, you're going to be psyched.

1043
01:01:36,570 --> 01:01:40,740
How old are you? Do maybe it's time you
should fucking live alone, you know,

1044
01:01:40,741 --> 01:01:41,880
cause you might jump out of this,

1045
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:45,780
out of the fireman and out of the fire
into the what and out of the frying pan

1046
01:01:45,781 --> 01:01:49,230
into the fire though.
This is fucking rough.

1047
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:51,860
Okay.

1048
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:53,410
I don't know how to just
say it. So listen, dude,

1049
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:56,840
I don't know how to say this to you
because I feel like however I say it,

1050
01:01:56,841 --> 01:02:00,140
you're going to feel like I'm
attacking you and that you know,

1051
01:02:00,410 --> 01:02:02,900
you're going to say something to your
girlfriend and she's gonna think that I

1052
01:02:02,901 --> 01:02:06,950
don't like her, which I
don't. Um, just say, listen,

1053
01:02:06,951 --> 01:02:10,960
she's coming over here five days a
week. She's not paying rent. You know,

1054
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,220
I like hanging out watching
TV and I'm coming over here.

1055
01:02:13,221 --> 01:02:14,570
She's taken up half the couch.

1056
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:18,950
I just need just can we cut it down to
four days a week, three days a week?

1057
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:20,100
I don't mind her coming over

1058
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:23,220
here. Just not five out of
the seven days. All right.

1059
01:02:24,170 --> 01:02:26,060
I want to come out here and my underwear,
rub my balls,

1060
01:02:26,061 --> 01:02:29,480
drink a fucking beer and watch the game.
I don't want to come out here, you know,

1061
01:02:29,870 --> 01:02:33,500
dress like a, I'm a on fathers
knows best. You know, you know,

1062
01:02:33,530 --> 01:02:36,290
back in the day that fathers would walk
around the house and a God damn suit,

1063
01:02:36,291 --> 01:02:37,124
right?

1064
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:45,860
You know what, dude? Sometimes
you just got to burn a friendship.

1065
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:48,980
There's all different ways you
can do that. You could just,

1066
01:02:48,981 --> 01:02:50,920
you could just be honest and
just say, listen to it. If

1067
01:02:52,580 --> 01:02:54,440
this fucking girl comes
over here one more time.

1068
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:59,240
So do you like mommy to cut it
down to like three days a week now?

1069
01:02:59,241 --> 01:03:00,074
How about zero?

1070
01:03:00,950 --> 01:03:03,050
How would you break up with her and
realize you can get somebody better?

1071
01:03:03,051 --> 01:03:04,520
How about that?
You know,

1072
01:03:05,140 --> 01:03:09,370
I dunno. So that, that is definitely a
rough one. I gave you a number of options.

1073
01:03:11,030 --> 01:03:11,863
Um,

1074
01:03:12,740 --> 01:03:17,600
I would in no way say how
you feel about that girl,

1075
01:03:17,601 --> 01:03:21,470
the of buddy. You can't do
that. Um, I mean, he can't,

1076
01:03:21,471 --> 01:03:23,930
but there's just going to be
ramifications to that. But uh,

1077
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:28,400
I would definitely try to get that, you
know, try to get that number knocked down.

1078
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:29,571
All right.

1079
01:03:29,571 --> 01:03:32,540
Did I just say the same thing for
fucking 20 minutes over and over again?

1080
01:03:32,570 --> 01:03:35,120
All right. There's an hour.
There's an hour for you. All right.

1081
01:03:35,121 --> 01:03:36,920
That's the Monday morning
podcast for this week.

1082
01:03:37,060 --> 01:03:41,370
I'm going to be at the
Brayer Comedy Club in, uh,

1083
01:03:42,050 --> 01:03:43,550
in Bray California.

1084
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:46,610
Let me get to my fucking website that
evidently that guy's got me feeling bad

1085
01:03:46,611 --> 01:03:49,670
about you.
Give a shit about your food.

1086
01:03:49,940 --> 01:03:54,500
I hope you do because if you don't,
it's really sad.

1087
01:03:55,730 --> 01:04:00,680
Oh, Jesus shows, here we go. I'm
going to be at the Brayer Improv. Uh,

1088
01:04:00,681 --> 01:04:04,700
November 30th,
December 1st and December 2nd.

1089
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:09,050
All right. Friday, Saturday,
Sunday of this week.

1090
01:04:09,230 --> 01:04:12,320
This is my last headlining
Gig of the year.

1091
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:17,480
If your dream was to see
me at some point in 2012,

1092
01:04:17,481 --> 01:04:20,750
this is your last chance.
Um,

1093
01:04:20,870 --> 01:04:23,720
I guarantee you're going to see a great
show because I'm loving my act right now.

1094
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:25,250
And um,

1095
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:28,550
I took last weekend off and I'm chomping
at the bit to get on stage and I got a

1096
01:04:28,551 --> 01:04:32,440
bunch of new fucked up shit that
I want to talk about and uh,

1097
01:04:32,450 --> 01:04:35,090
watch something the other night that I
got really inspired by actually watch the

1098
01:04:35,091 --> 01:04:38,750
documentary of the making
of Michael Jackson's bad.

1099
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:43,220
And it just made me feel like I,
I don't work nearly, you know,

1100
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:44,240
I don't work hard enough.

1101
01:04:44,290 --> 01:04:48,290
It was really fucking inspiring and
also kill me as I got off at that subway

1102
01:04:48,291 --> 01:04:51,120
stop with a,
with a shot the old day,

1103
01:04:51,121 --> 01:04:54,350
the whole dance thing
for bad and it's weird.

1104
01:04:54,351 --> 01:04:56,630
It's like you come down the stairs and
there's a middle level and then you go

1105
01:04:56,631 --> 01:05:01,631
downstairs again and the amount of
times I've ran through there trying to

1106
01:05:02,091 --> 01:05:04,040
fucking catch a train and
didn't even look around.

1107
01:05:05,550 --> 01:05:07,980
I wonder if I looked around at what a
noticed it I think would have to be like

1108
01:05:07,981 --> 01:05:10,620
nobody in there. If it was a bunch of
people I don't think I would've noticed.

1109
01:05:10,621 --> 01:05:14,070
But if I was there late at night and I
was looking around making sure I wasn't

1110
01:05:14,071 --> 01:05:14,904
going to get jumped,

1111
01:05:16,090 --> 01:05:17,980
you know,
I wonder if I would have

1112
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:20,050
noticed.
I probably wouldn't have,

1113
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:24,580
I probably wouldn't even notice if I
was fucking coming down with my iPod

1114
01:05:24,581 --> 01:05:25,930
listening to the song bad.

1115
01:05:26,190 --> 01:05:30,190
Ill Do, do, do, do, do, do, do,

1116
01:05:30,191 --> 01:05:32,440
do bill bill, Bill, Bill, Bill.

1117
01:05:32,580 --> 01:05:35,790
I would've walked right by
la. Um, anyways. All right,

1118
01:05:35,791 --> 01:05:38,850
that's the podcast for this week.
Thank you everybody for listening.

1119
01:05:38,851 --> 01:05:42,780
I hope you had a great thanksgiving.
Um, and that is it. Ed.

1120
01:05:42,860 --> 01:05:46,950
Um, thanks to the person who organized
the High School Union. Like I said,

1121
01:05:46,951 --> 01:05:48,540
I don't name names here.
Uh,

1122
01:05:48,630 --> 01:05:51,990
I had a great time and I think I'm
going to go to the next one. All righty.

1123
01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:55,460
That's it. Go fuck yourselves. I'll
talk to you next week. Oh, gee. Sheesh.
