1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,550
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:05,551 --> 00:00:08,140
Just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast.

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,080
Just checking in on

4
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:20,420
what's going on. Let me do that.
Like I'm falling off a cliff.

5
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:28,510
I woke up this morning by Dubai,
Dubai,

6
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:32,240
the dumbest song in my head and I can't
get it out and now I'm going to sing it

7
00:00:32,241 --> 00:00:35,210
to you so it will be stuck in your head.

8
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:39,680
It's a very vengeful thing for me to
do. It's something that, you know,

9
00:00:39,681 --> 00:00:42,260
pieces of shit guys.
Do you know if I'm going down,

10
00:00:42,261 --> 00:00:45,020
I'm taking you down with me and all
those kinds of pieces of shits. You know,

11
00:00:45,021 --> 00:00:49,280
they do that. Uh, the ladies, the
ladies like to dabble in that. Well,

12
00:00:49,281 --> 00:00:53,570
fuck you. This isn't a relationship. At
least I'm getting some of your t shirts,

13
00:00:53,571 --> 00:00:56,190
right? They're going to get
something from it. Well,

14
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,460
if this song's going
to be stuck in my head,

15
00:00:58,461 --> 00:01:01,490
I'm sorry to say that it's going to
be stuck in yours head too. All right,

16
00:01:01,491 --> 00:01:05,540
and I have given you a good, I've been
talking about this for a good 18 seconds.

17
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:06,590
That's plenty of time.

18
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,490
Even if you're driving in the car to
hit pause and you're choosing not to,

19
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:13,370
why do you do this to yourself?

20
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:18,170
Why don't you just choose the road
that's going to bring you true happiness?

21
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:23,180
Is that because you grew up and you watch
people being abused and you felt like

22
00:01:23,181 --> 00:01:27,350
you didn't have a choice in life that
this is the way it was? You know what,

23
00:01:27,351 --> 00:01:30,190
that last 10 seconds is probably going to
be worse than the song, but here it is.

24
00:01:30,191 --> 00:01:31,024
Right?

25
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:34,953
Okay.

26
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:41,943
Yeah,

27
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,380
and it's something,

28
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:48,490
I don't know who sings that song.

29
00:01:48,491 --> 00:01:52,720
I don't think I've ever gotten past
those first two lines of that song.

30
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:58,050
It's always comes on session presents
love songs from the 70s yeah.

31
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,193
This one

32
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,900
dude,
it make my brown eyes blue.

33
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:08,730
Right? And you say and go look
at this fucking horse shit.

34
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:11,550
And he start thinking about your childhood
and next thing you know you're on the

35
00:02:11,551 --> 00:02:15,870
phone with the operator. Can I
get the deluxe edition? Yeah.

36
00:02:15,871 --> 00:02:20,520
I still have a CD player in my
car. Well, because I'm frugal.

37
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,320
It's not because I'm failing and I
resent you saying that. Of course.

38
00:02:25,321 --> 00:02:30,030
I still want the CDS.
I'm speaking of my old car,

39
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:35,790
my car. I've had it since, uh,
October of 2007. It's a 2008.

40
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,770
Oh, it was a brand new. [inaudible]
had fucking stars in its eyes, right.

41
00:02:40,771 --> 00:02:44,700
Just stepped off the bus here in Hollywood
with a piece of Straw between his

42
00:02:44,701 --> 00:02:45,001
teeth,

43
00:02:45,001 --> 00:02:49,740
like axl rose and the guns and roses
video while welcome to welcome to the

44
00:02:49,741 --> 00:02:54,570
jungle. Um, and now look
at it. Oh, this thing,

45
00:02:54,571 --> 00:02:57,810
it looks like somebody attacked it
with the fucking can opener. Right.

46
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,550
It did as until as of the other day.

47
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:06,270
My uh, my wife was out of town. She was
in New York City for the Great Patrice.

48
00:03:06,271 --> 00:03:07,600
So benefit,

49
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,530
I want to thank everybody who came out
and I want to thank everyone who did the

50
00:03:11,531 --> 00:03:15,670
show. I unfortunately was not able
to get a fucking flight in, in time,

51
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:20,850
if you can believe that I actually
missed the benefit is fucking brutal.

52
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:25,420
I had a flight out, uh,
Saturday morning, Saturday,

53
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,710
and I believe that one I was on American
Airlines and they just gave me a call

54
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:34,450
and they were like, like a, you know,
when a one 800 number and I went hello.

55
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,310
And they were like, hello. Well it says,

56
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:41,340
oh by American Airlines and flora you
there's like two or was three as by Ganzel

57
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:45,820
you'll then relocated. No,
you might want to grab a pad.

58
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,690
You'll dow bed rebooked it's like rubber.
What?

59
00:03:49,691 --> 00:03:54,691
Seven five zero out of lax on Tuesday,

60
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:59,070
January 26 at 1:50 PM uh,

61
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:03,640
the benefit was on the 26th I was
supposed to be flying out on the 23rd.

62
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,930
They pushed it three fucking days and
I was going to leave for 15 east coast

63
00:04:07,931 --> 00:04:11,770
time when the show starts at seven. So
I'm like, well, that's not gonna work.

64
00:04:11,771 --> 00:04:14,500
So I call my travel agent,
you know?

65
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:17,080
And so she got me a flight on JetBlue,

66
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,930
7:45 AM on

67
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:26,050
Sunday, the 24th. So I'm like, no worries.
All right, so I miss a day, no big deal.

68
00:04:26,051 --> 00:04:28,750
Blah, blah, blah, blah.
Right. And then I get a call,

69
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,240
I get a call like the night before,
I'm all packed up,

70
00:04:31,241 --> 00:04:33,280
got my shit right next to the door,
and there's like,

71
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,840
there's other Connie from jet blue eel
bite, whatever, bad at a piece of paper.

72
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:41,320
Right? And then they fucking pumped
me to fucking Tuesday. So I said,

73
00:04:41,321 --> 00:04:45,550
fuck these guys. I call my travel
agent again. Now I'm on virgin.

74
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,143
All right.

75
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:51,760
I don't know why they call
it Virgin Airlines and then
it looks so Jesse in that

76
00:04:51,761 --> 00:04:55,330
fucking thing. It's like at the
w hotel was a plane, you know,

77
00:04:55,331 --> 00:05:00,331
with the fucking aquarium lighting that
just says no one wants to see a good

78
00:05:00,941 --> 00:05:04,240
look at their face in a mirror after
they do what they do in here. Right.

79
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:08,500
So they booked me on that fucking
thing and they're like, well,

80
00:05:08,501 --> 00:05:12,310
the time we can get you out is right when
the New England patriots game starts.

81
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:16,960
And I'm like, oh, that guy, he
got TV, I fucking put me on it.

82
00:05:16,961 --> 00:05:19,120
Right.
And then that one got canceled.

83
00:05:19,121 --> 00:05:24,121
So at that point I did deduced
if I'm using the word properly,

84
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,930
that, uh, that the fucking every,

85
00:05:28,931 --> 00:05:33,400
every poor bastard from Saturday
and Sunday, now that those flights,

86
00:05:33,401 --> 00:05:38,170
it all been canceled. We're now eating up
all the Monday and Tuesday once. So, um,

87
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,480
I had my travel agent go after another
flight and then meanwhile I called my

88
00:05:43,481 --> 00:05:46,570
manager,
who knows all these big guys and I said,

89
00:05:46,571 --> 00:05:50,200
can you get me a replacement in case I,
I'm not going to be able to get it.

90
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,620
Long story short,
I wasn't able to get in in time.

91
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,300
We got a replacement and a,

92
00:05:55,301 --> 00:06:00,301
I wish I could have been there because
a rich vos who crushed it as a host once

93
00:06:00,321 --> 00:06:04,460
again this year. And he said, uh,
blah, blah, blah, blah. Unfortunately,

94
00:06:04,461 --> 00:06:07,370
Bill Burke can't be here. And
everyone's like, oh, what the fuck?

95
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:12,530
Where is the red country? Right. And he
said, uh, that's the bad news. He said,

96
00:06:12,531 --> 00:06:16,610
the good news is Louis C K and Louis
CK walked down and they would fucking

97
00:06:16,611 --> 00:06:20,210
absolutely mental. And uh, you know,

98
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:25,220
I was replaced one balding redhead
with another balding redhead with more

99
00:06:25,221 --> 00:06:30,140
credits. So nobody misses me. Um,

100
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,160
and I guess he fucking murdered it and
then the all had to do is 15 and he,

101
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:38,140
cause he's such a great
guy, did like 25, um,

102
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,840
and just fucking destroyed and
everybody had a great time. And, uh,

103
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:45,590
somebody sent me a picture of, um,

104
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:49,910
of everybody in the end coming out. Al
Del Benny flew in all the way from Sydney,

105
00:06:49,911 --> 00:06:50,451
Australia.

106
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:53,000
That's another reason why I didn't want
to reschedule cause this guy flew in

107
00:06:53,001 --> 00:06:57,540
from the other side of the
fucking world. And um, Oh,

108
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,840
who else was there? Rachel fine find sign.
Greer Barnes who absolutely murdered,

109
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,920
you know, one of the greatest,
who ever did it? Greer Barnes. Um,

110
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,900
Jim Norton. I don't have it in
front of me. I wasn't there too,

111
00:07:11,901 --> 00:07:16,250
so I know I'm going to end up
forgetting somebody. But uh, anyways,

112
00:07:16,251 --> 00:07:21,110
everybody Godfrey did it.
Everybody fucking killed. And
uh, they had a great time.

113
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:21,681
So anyway,

114
00:07:21,681 --> 00:07:25,730
so I was out here and I was supposed
to be in New York from Saturday until

115
00:07:25,731 --> 00:07:29,600
Wednesday, so nobody knew
that I was out here, you know,

116
00:07:29,601 --> 00:07:33,920
so I was just like, well fuck it.
I'm not telling anybody I'm here.

117
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:38,950
And I just started handling a bunch
of shit that I've been putting off for

118
00:07:39,651 --> 00:07:43,130
months, if not years. Um,

119
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:49,020
I did everything from, uh,
get my last will together, my,

120
00:07:49,021 --> 00:07:50,610
you know,
when I die or whatever.

121
00:07:50,611 --> 00:07:54,230
It makes sure that everything goes
to the people it needs to go to.

122
00:07:54,231 --> 00:07:59,060
So there's no fighting
hopefully, uh, which is actually,

123
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:03,380
it's really morbid, but it's also
fucking kind of cool. It's like, yeah,

124
00:08:03,381 --> 00:08:08,210
fucking you take this and you take that
in a, I'm out of here. Good luck to you.

125
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:13,230
I had a great time and a great ass.
Um,

126
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,080
I rolled change that we hadn't jars.

127
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:23,740
I handled that and I dropped my fucking
Prius off and I had all the fucking

128
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:28,010
dense repaired. You should say.
It looks brand fucking new.

129
00:08:28,011 --> 00:08:30,440
There's a couple of little ones
that they just, they left in there,

130
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:34,880
they'd buffed the whole thing up. I
didn't get new believers because you know,

131
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:36,070
you have new bumpers out here.

132
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:40,730
They last for about three days before
somebody just bumps into him. So, uh,

133
00:08:40,731 --> 00:08:43,190
I just had a buff those things
up and it looks fucking great.

134
00:08:43,191 --> 00:08:44,390
And I'll tell you right now,

135
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:50,650
having a paid off Prius with
80,000 something miles on it in La,

136
00:08:50,661 --> 00:08:53,510
La is the greatest fucking car
you could ever drive. It's just,

137
00:08:53,511 --> 00:08:57,380
it's the shit and it takes the too,
it's like Ben Roethlisberger.

138
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,230
It just fucking shakes him
off and he'd get, keeps going.

139
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,050
And no matter how bad the gas prices get,

140
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,780
I've never paid more
than 40 bucks a gallon.

141
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:09,550
I don't give a fuck if
somebody runs into it. Um,

142
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:14,120
I could park it wherever I want. Nobody's
going to take it. It's fucking perfect.

143
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:18,710
Right. I bought my wife a nice
car. It's nice. I can't stand it.

144
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:23,090
I can't, you know, I feel like when
I'm driving that thing. Do you make,

145
00:09:23,091 --> 00:09:27,080
do you guys ever see that
fucking hilarious Howard
Stern's movie, private parts?

146
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:31,400
Do you remember when he would show him
himself when he first became a DJ in lake?

147
00:09:31,401 --> 00:09:33,680
When he went to put the
needle on the record and he,

148
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,620
he scratched and he fucked the
whole thing up. Remember that noise?

149
00:09:36,621 --> 00:09:37,454
Who's making it was going to

150
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:39,930
woo.
That's

151
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,700
what I feel like when I drive that car.

152
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,540
Like I'll be going to the grocery
store and I'll just be thinking like,

153
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:49,490
God damn and I need to go in there, buy
some fucking hamburger. But you know,

154
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,440
if I don't see a bunch of wide open
spaces, I want parking in there.

155
00:09:52,441 --> 00:09:56,100
Cause I know somebody's going to come
in and just park right next to it and

156
00:09:56,101 --> 00:09:59,400
fucking oh fun that door right into
the side of it and it's gonna make me

157
00:09:59,401 --> 00:10:04,170
fucking sick. You know, it's like
when you go to a movie, right?

158
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:07,950
Like right now's a great time to go see
star wars. Maybe in another fucking weak,

159
00:10:07,951 --> 00:10:11,400
right? Nobody's going to be there.
You go see a matinee, right.

160
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:16,380
And it's during the work week. You're
a comedian, you got a Gig that night.

161
00:10:16,381 --> 00:10:17,760
You say, fuck it, I'm going to go.

162
00:10:17,761 --> 00:10:22,350
I'm going to go see a matinee showing
of star wars fucking six weeks after it

163
00:10:22,351 --> 00:10:26,520
came out, right? You go in there,
there's nobody fucking there.

164
00:10:26,521 --> 00:10:28,440
You get your feet up,
you having a great time.

165
00:10:28,441 --> 00:10:33,441
It is fucking inevitable that someone's
going to walk in during the fucking

166
00:10:33,781 --> 00:10:34,350
trailers.

167
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:38,130
They going to sit down and right behind
you and they're going to talk or munch

168
00:10:38,131 --> 00:10:39,840
popcorn fucking loudly,

169
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:43,230
or they're going to be fucking dressed
like Chewbacca and is getting, getting,

170
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,310
getting hair in their mouth.

171
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,210
The other thing we'll be doing that the
entire fucking time, it's an at the same,

172
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:52,260
the same way that is inevitable.
If you park in a, in a, in
a parking lot, some con,

173
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:55,470
even if there's a bunch of fucking spaces
is going to pull in right next to you

174
00:10:55,471 --> 00:10:57,870
and they can open the fucking
door right into it, you know,

175
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,070
and that's just regular people
forget about out of shape.

176
00:11:02,071 --> 00:11:07,071
People who they got to like put stress
on the hinges of their doors to just make

177
00:11:07,651 --> 00:11:12,540
it wide enough, you know? You know,
that's when you know you're fat.

178
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:15,810
When you get like one of those Formula
One fucking steering wheels that just

179
00:11:15,811 --> 00:11:17,520
pops out so you can get you to gut out.

180
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,630
He keep lying to yourself,
I'll tell you.

181
00:11:22,631 --> 00:11:26,910
And they don't make these for Broncos as
big as they used to. Yeah, they do. Yeah,

182
00:11:26,911 --> 00:11:31,620
they do. They most
certainly fucking do. Um,

183
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:35,760
so anyway, speaking of cars too, and I
saw there's somebody up the street, man.

184
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:39,290
It's got to kill a fucking car.
It's one of those Volkswagen. Uh,

185
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:44,940
it's not the bug. It's not the Karmann
Ghias it's the fucking station wagon.

186
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,630
And they put some white walls on
it and some fucking fog lights.

187
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:53,960
They got the luggage rack
on it. It's fucking cool as
shit. I love station wagon.

188
00:11:53,961 --> 00:11:57,770
I love a station wagon. Um, sorry,

189
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:01,040
I got a little fucking,
uh, who's that guy?

190
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:05,330
It's as big as a whale and
it's about to set sail.

191
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:07,323
Okay.

192
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,740
Hang on. Sorry. Sorry. I'm
singing all these fucking songs.

193
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:18,040
It's a little old place where you
could get together and do what,

194
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,740
what kind of depravity
goes on in the love shack.

195
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:23,810
Okay.

196
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,310
Did that song even makes sense.

197
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,130
They just went out to a shack
and they fucked, I mean,

198
00:12:29,131 --> 00:12:33,950
maybe I'm taking it too literally. Uh,
what was I looking up? Oh yeah, the, uh,

199
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,550
the Volkswagen station wagon.

200
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,510
The Volkswagen will dissolve
Volkswagen station wagon,

201
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:45,530
a classic VW station wagon on,

202
00:12:46,201 --> 00:12:49,560
let's see what this things called.
There it is.

203
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,053
Okay.

204
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:55,320
The fuck is it called? So I got
all the, uh, the pictures of it.

205
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:00,210
That's such a fucking cool car,
man. I love the front end on it.

206
00:13:00,211 --> 00:13:03,830
And the guy also had it in a stick shift,
which I think is a,

207
00:13:03,831 --> 00:13:08,340
a picture below a rear view of the
Volkswagen Beetle from 61 to 70, 67.

208
00:13:08,341 --> 00:13:12,910
That's not what I wanted. One of
these days. One of these days,

209
00:13:12,911 --> 00:13:14,170
I'm just going to look shit up.

210
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:15,290
Yeah.

211
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:17,000
You know,
before it starts.

212
00:13:17,001 --> 00:13:21,800
And I'll have a nice news podcasts.
I'm imitating my,

213
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,020
my science teacher from uh,

214
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,210
yeah,

215
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:30,020
from high school. When he was talking
about some sort of biology thing. He said,

216
00:13:30,021 --> 00:13:33,200
there's this rough and smooth, I
forget what it was. And he was like,

217
00:13:33,201 --> 00:13:35,420
there's aura and snooze.

218
00:13:35,421 --> 00:13:37,910
It used to make a joke out of it and
everybody would laugh and you'd never get

219
00:13:37,911 --> 00:13:39,690
it wrong on the test,
you know?

220
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,830
Do you know why there's not more funny
teachers is because they all become

221
00:13:42,831 --> 00:13:44,330
comedians cause it just like,
all right,

222
00:13:44,331 --> 00:13:48,590
I'm basically doing stand up here and uh,

223
00:13:48,591 --> 00:13:49,850
I'm not making any money,

224
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:53,870
so fuck these kids and their future

225
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:59,430
Volkswagen type three square back.
That's all it's called. Come on.

226
00:13:59,431 --> 00:14:03,950
They had to give it a better name than
that. Oh, this is some fucking gearhead.

227
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,880
Thank God damn fucking bastards.

228
00:14:05,881 --> 00:14:08,130
Can you just tell me the
name of the fucking car?

229
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:13,360
Where
did formation,

230
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:14,680
okay.

231
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,170
You think I could look it up

232
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:22,610
by the mid sixties it was clear
that Volkswagen's iconoclastic,

233
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:26,720
thinks small campaign on behalf of
the lowly beetle had succeeded in

234
00:14:26,721 --> 00:14:28,520
transforming the third hike.

235
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:30,410
Okay.

236
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:32,330
Wait a minute. Wait, what
is this about Hitler?

237
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:35,970
I'm trying to read about the
fucking Karmann Ghias typed to,

238
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:38,540
maybe it is a Karmann Ghia. I, you
know what the fuck I'm talking about.

239
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:40,250
You know what? I'll just put
a picture of. How about that?

240
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:44,480
How I put a picture of that. Hey, did
anybody see bill check a football life?

241
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:50,740
It was a two pipe and I gotta
admit I was bored shitless.

242
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:52,450
Okay.

243
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:52,751
I,

244
00:14:52,751 --> 00:14:57,751
I've never been more bored watching a
football life even when it was him and Tom

245
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:01,060
Brady's sitting in the office. I
was, it was fucking eggheads shit,

246
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:06,490
but it was just all monotone. Just
going. Yeah. Yeah. Lions have a,

247
00:15:06,491 --> 00:15:09,120
uh, a good defense. So, uh, you know,

248
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:13,150
I'm to put together a game plan
and then Tom Brady be like smiling,

249
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:15,580
but just going like, yeah. I
thought maybe we could have the, uh,

250
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:18,640
the running back come out
of the backfield. He could
explain some things, uh,

251
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:23,460
the underneath of there a secondary,
oh yeah, Tom, I'm going to,

252
00:15:23,461 --> 00:15:27,990
I'll look into that. Okay.
Ville and that'd be like a
scene. It was like fucking,

253
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,010
yeah.

254
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:31,710
Even when he got emotional, when he
went to giant stadium, I was just like,

255
00:15:31,711 --> 00:15:35,250
this is a, you know, he didn't
get in volt motion. I'm like,

256
00:15:35,251 --> 00:15:37,540
if you want to see the emotional why
you got to see the Dick for me or one.

257
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:41,010
But I was, I, I can't even watch
it. I feel like a bad patriots fan.

258
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,430
I can not get fucking through it.
Um,

259
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,260
maybe I will eventually.

260
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:49,350
So actually that was another
thing I did when I was here.

261
00:15:49,351 --> 00:15:50,700
I was just binge watching shit.

262
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:54,510
I watched the whole first
season of top boy on Netflix.

263
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:58,830
It's only four episodes
a fucking good show.

264
00:15:58,831 --> 00:16:01,980
Matt and I just started
the second one last night.

265
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,380
And uh,

266
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:09,550
I watched this documentary
on na's who I never got,

267
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,690
I never got it. When illmatic came
out, I was like, I don't like this.

268
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:17,260
I don't get it right. And now I went
back and listened to it. I was like, oh,

269
00:16:17,261 --> 00:16:21,910
wait a minute. This is fucking
unbelievable. You got to admit,

270
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:24,070
okay, when you're younger, there's a lot,

271
00:16:24,071 --> 00:16:26,830
sometimes there's albums that come out or,

272
00:16:26,831 --> 00:16:29,690
or artists that come by and you just
don't see him cause you're like, Eh,

273
00:16:29,691 --> 00:16:32,320
you know, he's an older
guy. Like, like David Bowie.

274
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:37,540
I never went to see that guy live. And
now doing the classic, now that he's dead,

275
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:42,460
let me take another listen to his
fucking music. And I, you know,

276
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,240
I had that fucking album,
like everybody has that album.

277
00:16:46,241 --> 00:16:50,980
I had the Ziggy stardust one and a,
that's still an amazing fucking album.

278
00:16:50,981 --> 00:16:53,230
Obviously that's been played to death,
but that was killer.

279
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:57,790
But I downloaded diamond dogs and it's
fucking on. It's unreal. And I was like,

280
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,470
I many times could I have seen this guy,

281
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,770
I could have seen him on
the let's dance toilet dance

282
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,850
shows that dad's little blue.

283
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:12,710
Um, I could have seen him on any
of those and I never did. You know,

284
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:17,090
Bob Newhart's playing out Friday night,
I'm not going to get a chance to see him.

285
00:17:17,091 --> 00:17:21,920
His fucking show is sold out. It's like
way the fuck out in the desert. And,

286
00:17:21,921 --> 00:17:25,280
uh, I got something nine
30 the next morning, so I
can't go fucking see the guy.

287
00:17:25,281 --> 00:17:30,170
And, uh, so I'm trying to make a bucket
list of guys. I gotta go fucking see.

288
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,390
I hope they don't, none
of, nobody plays his farm.

289
00:17:32,391 --> 00:17:35,270
Cause I'm going to see them because
not only I respect him as an artist,

290
00:17:35,271 --> 00:17:39,140
but I also saw, I'm afraid they're
going to die, you know? Uh,

291
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:41,660
I don't want to jinx anybody,
but you know they are.

292
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:46,040
Or even you just want to see him
before they quit touring. Right?

293
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,030
Everyone. Fuck Tony Bennett. Stevie wonder

294
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:54,650
to Bob Newhart to Morton Downey jr right.

295
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:59,420
I'm joking. I already saw him and he's
dead. All right, let's plow ahead.

296
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:03,950
I think I got to do a read
for the week here. Um,

297
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:07,080
why don't I do the read and I'll be
singing the melody to when I need love

298
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:08,063
done.

299
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,460
Lots of play

300
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:19,980
playoff speeds.
Now that the polls,

301
00:18:19,981 --> 00:18:22,840
seasons,
leaf,

302
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:27,220
I can't do the whole thing that to the
pros kickoffs a year the right way with a

303
00:18:27,221 --> 00:18:28,990
fresh blade shave.

304
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:34,020
That's why me and millions of others
have joined the dollar shave club.com

price of those greedy
mega razor corporations.

312
00:18:56,570 --> 00:19:00,260

can afford the luxury of shaving with a

313
00:19:00,261 --> 00:19:03,740
fresh blade anytime and save
hundreds this year. And uh,

314
00:19:03,741 --> 00:19:05,420
when you combine the fresh
blade, any, once you do,

315
00:19:05,421 --> 00:19:08,720
if you really want to feel like a rich
guy is get one of those barbershop chairs

316
00:19:08,721 --> 00:19:12,020

of your drunk friends shave your face

317
00:19:12,021 --> 00:19:14,270

up. You'll get ingrown hairs.

unimaginably smooth. Uh, I'm telling you,

00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:58,080
dollar shave club.com/
[inaudible] all right, legal zoom.

331
00:19:58,860 --> 00:19:59,290
Okay.

332
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:02,830
All right before another year pass is
take the time to get your life organized

333
00:20:02,831 --> 00:20:07,120
with legal zone. This is what I've
been doing. Do you have a family?

334
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,800
Do you have any assets or property?
If any of those answers are yes,

335
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:15,370
you should have an estate plan.
Fuck you man. I already did this.

336
00:20:15,371 --> 00:20:19,090
This is for other people. Uh, don't
worry if that sounds complicated.

337
00:20:19,091 --> 00:20:21,910
Legal Zoom can help. Yes, they
can. Legal Zoom is a state plan.

338
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:26,170
Bundles eliminates the
guesswork. Yes, they do. This is,

339
00:20:26,171 --> 00:20:27,910
this is a personal testimony.

340
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:31,120
You don't have to figure out on your
own whether a will or living trucks.

341
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,700
Trust works better. Best for you. Instead,

342
00:20:33,701 --> 00:20:36,820
you work with an independent
attorney available in most states,

343
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:40,300
the walk you through your options and
recommend an estate plan that offers the

344
00:20:40,301 --> 00:20:42,910
best solution to fit your needs.
You know, it's funny, you know,

345
00:20:42,911 --> 00:20:45,730
if it's not available in your state,
they don't think your states cool.

346
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:48,220
There's not enough fucking
for them to make money on.

347
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,190
Like if you're out there
and wow. I'm like, wow,

348
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:53,970
I think I'm doing a Gig
that coming up in Cheyenne.

349
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:56,740
I got a gig coming up in Denver.
All right.

350
00:20:56,741 --> 00:21:00,340
They'll walk you through your options
and recommend an estate plan that offers

351
00:21:00,341 --> 00:21:03,790
the best solution to fit your needs.
Since legal zoom is not a law firm,

352
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,640
you can count on the F
on efficiency and value.

353
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,010
Everything is your
schedule and your terms.

354
00:21:09,011 --> 00:21:13,630
Plus you'll know what your estate
plan bundles costs up front instead of

355
00:21:13,631 --> 00:21:14,980
worrying about hourly rates.

356
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:20,130
That's how legal zoom has
become the leader in helping
small business owners and

357
00:21:20,771 --> 00:21:24,730
families with great with their legal what?
With their legal needs.

358
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,670
You get legal help and
walk away feeling great.

359
00:21:27,671 --> 00:21:30,430
There's the great that I was
looking at a fucking line below.

00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:47,230
All right, there we go. And
that's the end of the reads. Uh,

364
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:51,220
what did I just want to talk
about? Something in there
reminded me of something.

365
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,970
Oh yeah, the fucking, I'm going to be
going to Denver when I go to Denver.

366
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,560
They're either going to be super bowl
champions or they're going to be depressed

367
00:21:59,561 --> 00:22:00,221
that they lost,

368
00:22:00,221 --> 00:22:03,010
but they're probably still going to
give me shit that they beat my patriots.

369
00:22:03,011 --> 00:22:07,390
But I've got to tell you this man,
this is pretty cool.

370
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,100
Do you know Denver is the only team,

371
00:22:09,101 --> 00:22:11,230
the New England patriots
have a losing record too.

372
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,530
And I know a lot of you guys log ah,
fuck or Denver.

373
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,640
And I'm actually thinking like,

374
00:22:15,641 --> 00:22:19,210
I can't believe that's true because I
watched the Patriots before Tom Brady.

375
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:20,710
All right.

376
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:24,040
And I think there was very few people
that we had a winning record against and

377
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:25,720
the fact that,
uh,

378
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:30,400
who's kidding who bill Bella check came
in with drew Bledsoe and that really

379
00:22:30,401 --> 00:22:33,520
started turning shit around. And, um,

380
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:35,600
just the way that they've won over the,

381
00:22:35,601 --> 00:22:40,601
since like 2000 or 2001 I
really like the last 20 years,

382
00:22:40,631 --> 00:22:45,520
the way they've won,
they were, let's see, 20,

383
00:22:45,521 --> 00:22:48,680
35,
they were 35 years or 30,

384
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:54,900
33 years in or 32 years in when drew
Bledsoe took over and drew Bledsoe took

385
00:22:55,421 --> 00:23:00,100
over 24 years ago. So, you know,

386
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:01,143
that's what it took.

387
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:06,570
It took two and a half decades to undo
fucking three decades of fucking up.

388
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:11,590
And, um, I think that's
amazing. Now you're probably
going, well, why, why the fuck?

389
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:15,070
What are the Broncos doing?
You always got to play in that altitude.

390
00:23:15,071 --> 00:23:16,360
It was always snowing.

391
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:21,390
And then they had Craig Morton and
the orange crushed defense in the 70s.

392
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:27,430
And, uh, I think before that they had
that Floyd little great running back,

393
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:31,540
rainy granite shack, um, haven Moses,

394
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,510
Rick UPC church there.
They always had some fucking guys.

395
00:23:34,511 --> 00:23:38,470
And then they got John Elway in
[inaudible] 83 and that fucked after Craig

396
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:39,400
Morton. They went, you know,

397
00:23:39,401 --> 00:23:44,140
a few years and then 83 Elway came
in and that fucked us from 83 to 98.

398
00:23:44,141 --> 00:23:45,830
So even when we had drew Bledsoe

399
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:50,300
for the first fucking Ah, six,
seven years, it was against, uh,

400
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:54,920
John Elway who's like top three all
time, I think, you know what I mean? Um,

401
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:59,660
I'd actually put him ahead
of, uh, Peyton Manning, um,

402
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,560
personally, personally speaking. Uh,

403
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:05,690
so I'm actually excited that there's
32 fucking teams were one of them.

404
00:24:05,691 --> 00:24:09,440
So of the 31 other teams, 30 of them,
we had a winning record against.

405
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:14,180
Can anybody else make that claim? I
don't think they can. All right, sorry.

406
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:18,750
So anybody watched 60 minutes
this past week? They did a,

407
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:25,870
they did this feature feature on mountain
lions and our California is the only

408
00:24:27,111 --> 00:24:32,111
state that has mountain
lions just walking around.

409
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:36,410
I, I'm going to fuck
this up in a, in a park,

410
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:41,520
I guess maybe the size of like
Griffith Park or Runyon Canyon or,

411
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:44,980
or whatever those ones are out in,
uh,

412
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:50,660
out in the valley. I guess they have
these fucking things. And, um, so anyways,

413
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:55,160
I was watching it because a few of the
places that was where I hike with my dog

414
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:57,400
and this thing has intermittently this,

415
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,070
this group of fucking mountain
lions has been around there.

416
00:25:01,071 --> 00:25:04,880
But fortunately they try
to avoid you I guess, um,

417
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:08,840
at least during the day if then I fucking
hungry. But they showed this fucking,

418
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:12,860
uh, these people, this
mountain lion, right. Okay.

419
00:25:12,861 --> 00:25:14,000
They were having some work done.

420
00:25:14,001 --> 00:25:18,110
So they had somebody going underneath
the house into the crawlspace of their

421
00:25:18,111 --> 00:25:20,060
house and they will write
up against this park.

422
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:24,050
And the guy went down there
and he immediately came
back up and he was fucking

423
00:25:24,051 --> 00:25:28,750
like white as a ghost and they
were like a dawn day ace, you know,

424
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,040
fucking white people trying to
speak Spanish, right? Oh eight. Um,

425
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,880
is it French? I don't know. Um,

426
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:41,340
and the guy comes out of the fucking hole
and was like, yeah, man, I fucking, uh,

427
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:45,760
is a mount line down there. I just
came faced and then I get outta here.

428
00:25:45,761 --> 00:25:49,570
He is shy, I guess that, and

429
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:53,990
they will, he's like, yeah, it's
fucking down there. And, and so anyways,

430
00:25:53,991 --> 00:25:57,970
they interview this fucking La couple and
they had the quintessential fucking la

431
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:02,900
couple, you know what I mean? He looks
like the leading man of a B movie,

432
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:07,670
right? She's got like bleach blonde
hair. She's wearing fuck me pumps.

433
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:11,150
She's on 60 minutes where it fucked
me pumps. It's fucking hilarious.

434
00:26:11,151 --> 00:26:15,020
Walking around, done up
to the nines. And um,

435
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:20,270
I actually, uh, it was pretty cool. I was
trying to figure out where the house was.

436
00:26:20,271 --> 00:26:24,260
I Google mapped it and I
think I was able to find it,

437
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:29,740
but I'm a fuck this state is so
fucking insane with the droughts,

438
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:35,210
the fires, the rattlesnakes,
the coyotes, the mountain lions,

439
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:40,160
you know, and everybody's in this place is
so phony and so plastic. Well, you know,

440
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:44,910
it can get, uh, that can all go
pretty damn quick with the wildlife.

441
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:50,620
It's sort of like a fucking
Australia light, like super light.

442
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:53,650
You know what I mean?
As I was throwing that out there,

443
00:26:53,651 --> 00:26:54,940
I just heard everybody down there.

444
00:26:54,941 --> 00:26:58,420
I'll flow gimme a fucking brain of
flipping out about how dangerous their

445
00:26:58,421 --> 00:27:02,250
fucking, yeah. You know,
how dangerous Australia is.

446
00:27:02,251 --> 00:27:06,390
Let me tell you something right now.
There's no fucking snakes. It's Sydney,

447
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:07,530
Australia.
All right?

448
00:27:07,531 --> 00:27:09,810
There's all that shit's in the
middle of their fucking country.

449
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:12,840
Every week there's some at the zoo,
right?

450
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,860
Every once in a while you'll see somebody,
you know,

451
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:22,090
goes to pick up a snake thinking
it's a garden snake. He goes,

452
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,960
fuck it.
Bit that goes jogging in it,

453
00:27:24,961 --> 00:27:28,620
racist through his veins and he fucking
dies. Yes, that does happen. But you know,

454
00:27:28,621 --> 00:27:31,800
people don't, you know what? Let's, let's
actually, let's look up some stats here.

455
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:33,600
Let's go to the stats here.

456
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,060
Cause I don't think you're going to
hear enough stats between now and the

457
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:38,110
Superbowl,

462
00:27:55,301 --> 00:27:59,170
So ESPN is not gonna cover it.

Um, I'm not a, I don't even think

473
00:28:37,241 --> 00:28:41,170
but they always have an answer.
All right. Snakebite del East,

475
00:28:42,251 --> 00:28:47,251
It's responsible for about 60% of deaths
caused by snakebite and Australia.

476
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:51,870
All right, here's the

480
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:04,550
Species is unconfirmed.
You know why?

481
00:29:04,551 --> 00:29:09,230
Because the snake left didn't
hang out like Yo, I did that shit.

495
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:10,180
Okay.

496
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:10,871
You want to do the story?

497
00:30:10,871 --> 00:30:14,380
Dave was sitting around the fire at his
family's camp when he was bitten by a

498
00:30:14,381 --> 00:30:18,760
rattlesnake. Jesus Christ in the balls
right in front of his whole family.

499
00:30:18,761 --> 00:30:23,350
He was taken to the hospital and from
there air lifted to the Pittsburgh area

500
00:30:23,351 --> 00:30:25,120
hospital.
While en route,

501
00:30:25,121 --> 00:30:29,520
the helicoptered Davis
suffered a cardiac arrest. Dot.

502
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:32,830
Jesus.
Grant Thompson 18 male.

503
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:34,730
Yeah,

504
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:39,620
a Cobra.
Who the fuck has a cobra?

505
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:40,880
Okay.

506
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,110
He got hit by a car boy.

507
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:46,550
Thompson was found unresponsible
in his car in North Austin.

508
00:30:46,551 --> 00:30:51,380
Lowe's in North Austin at a Lowe's store
parking lot. How the fuck do you get by?

509
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,620
Uh, uh, monocled Cobra. Oh,

510
00:30:54,621 --> 00:30:56,510

511
00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:00,990
With little I grass because it's like it
was evil like it's a James Bond villain.

512
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:02,600
Okay.

513
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,260
All right.
It's a cobra species,

514
00:31:04,261 --> 00:31:09,240
which is widespread across the
south and Southeast Asia. Oh, Jesus.

515
00:31:09,241 --> 00:31:10,650
Somebody fucking ordered one.

516
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:18,650
Uh,
Monaco Colebra that he was known to own,

517
00:31:18,651 --> 00:31:22,640
was missing and was
later found dead nearby.

518
00:31:22,641 --> 00:31:24,920
Haven't been run over by a car.

519
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:28,203
Okay,

520

521
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:32,520
we got to get to the bottom
of this fucking story.

522
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:36,300
So this fucking kid
ordered a Goddamn Cobra.

523
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,513
Wait a minute.

524
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:45,460
Do one of these people going to
fucking low? Let me, let me, let's,

525
00:31:45,461 --> 00:31:48,430
let's not get crazy here. Let's, let's
find out what happened to this kid.

526
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:51,400
Jesus Christ.
Greg Thompson,

527
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,460
grant t h o m

528
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:58,340
Thompson Cobra.

529
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:03,760
All right. Greg Thompson committed
suicide by allowing a Cobra.

530
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:10,470
This is the most, this can't
be true. Suicide by snakebite.

531
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,630
Question mark is this click bay.

532
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:14,123
Okay.

533
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:18,810
I was going to say this kid looks just
like Lance Bass and it was actually click

534
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:23,811
bait on the side says Lance Bass shows
us the most expensive item from his

535
00:32:23,901 --> 00:32:24,980
wedding registry.

536
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:26,720
Okay.

537
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,330
Isn't that a little disrespectful
to have next to this kid. All right,

538
00:32:29,331 --> 00:32:34,200
so the kids sitting here, what?
The parrot from one of his,

539
00:32:34,201 --> 00:32:36,320
uh,
when the was Beretta parrots.

540
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:38,410
Okay.

541
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:40,230
Police Texas teens

542
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:43,620
death after he leaves a
cryptic message on Facebook,

543
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:49,370
the DEX death of a Texas teen who was
killed after being bitten by a Cobra last

544
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:51,930
Tuesday is being
investigated as a suicide.

545
00:32:51,931 --> 00:32:56,910
Austin police confirm to people.
Is this people magazine? Yeah.

546
00:32:56,911 --> 00:33:00,480
They're in deer into what people
are doing. Grant Thompson was found

547
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:05,860
unresponsible inside his car and a Lowe's
parking lot last week with puncture

548
00:33:05,861 --> 00:33:09,790
wounds to his wrist and
his snake cage beside him.

549
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:16,420
Kwtx reports he was discovered surrounded
by a large, by a number of animals,

550
00:33:16,421 --> 00:33:20,530
including a non venomous snake,
six tarantulas in a frog.

551
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:25,540
But as pet cobra was missing,
this was in his fucking car.

552
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:30,610
Thompson was rushed to a blah,
blah, blah, or he later died. Yeah,

553
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:35,380
I don't think in Austin they're going to
have shit for a cobra unless they got a

554
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,490
zoo nearby.
Right.

555
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:40,900
It was located above about police believe
that Thompson committed suicide by

556
00:33:40,901 --> 00:33:45,610
allowing the venomous snake to bite him.
Surely before he was found Tuesday,

557
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:49,720
the team posted a cryptic message to
his Facebook page. Writing, I'm sorry.

558
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:55,240
Thompson's family owns a
pet shot in temple, Texas.

559
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,490
He'd worked for the
store most of his life.

560
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:00,520
He could handle tarantulas
like they were kittens.

561
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:04,570
He loved animals and love spreading
awareness about animals in the community.

562
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:09,370
Knob Saatchi was performed Thursday,
but authorities are waiting for the toxin.

563
00:34:09,371 --> 00:34:14,050
What the fuck Jesus do.
That is hardcore.

564
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:16,060
Okay.

565
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,030
Do you, have you heard those things? That

566
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:23,010
there is nothing like the
hiss of a fucking reptile
and that fucking rep Chilean

567
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:25,190
look like. What other look are
they going to have in that face?

568
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:27,530
How is Lance Bass reverse aging?

569
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:34,500
Jesus Christ
fucking teeth.

570
00:34:34,501 --> 00:34:36,090
Or like does he even eat anything?

571
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,140
Okay.

572
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:41,610
His teeth are like brand new, like
out of the box. Um, all right,

573
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:46,290
I think it's time to wrap this
up. Wrap it up. I'll take it.

574
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,193
Um,

575
00:34:49,930 --> 00:34:50,600
okay.

576
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,430
Wait a minute.
What the fuck am I here?

577
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:59,420
Where's the rest of this shit? Ah,
Jesus Christ. Bill, what are you doing?

578
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:05,580
All right. That's not it.
Is this it? That's not it.

579
00:35:05,581 --> 00:35:07,230
That's the shit about my wealth.

580
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,610
I don't know what this is and I don't know
where my memory, just everything went.

581
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:16,530
I give up. Oh, fuck it. Anyway,
so that's the end of the podcast.

582
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:21,360
Jesus Christ, Mike and Dialysis
to anybody knew that kid. Holy,

583
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:26,200
you know what are the odds for, there's
no way he was covered for that. Huh?

584
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,660
And you're fucking insurance.

585
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:32,010
Accidental death accidentally getting
bit by a Cobra and the wrist and the

586
00:35:32,011 --> 00:35:35,130
parking lot of a Lowe's in Austin,
Texas.

587
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:39,310
All right. Anyways, that's a podcast.

588
00:35:39,311 --> 00:35:42,730
I hope you guys have a great weekend
and a stay away from the snakes.

589
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,200
So you know what Australia.
All right. That was deliberate.

590
00:35:47,201 --> 00:35:49,630
So we can't count that one. So we, we, uh,

591
00:35:49,631 --> 00:35:51,460
we had three times as
many deaths as you did.

592
00:35:51,461 --> 00:35:56,050
So why don't you tone down how fucking
nuts you status or your country,

593
00:35:56,710 --> 00:36:00,940
whatever it is, right island, you know,

594
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:04,960
it's not that fucking dangerous.
You know what it is?

595
00:36:04,961 --> 00:36:09,490
We buy into it because of the fucking,
uh, the shrimp on the Barbie guy,

596
00:36:09,491 --> 00:36:12,750
Paul Hogan and then the crocodile hunter.
You know,

597
00:36:12,751 --> 00:36:15,820
and when you really think about it,
how did the crocodile hunter die?

598
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:21,040
Was it one of those snakes that he was
constantly fucking with? Was it any other,

599
00:36:21,041 --> 00:36:25,000
the land animals that he was
constantly fucking with? It was not,

600
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:29,680
he fucked with the sting ray. And he
forgot that those things always are armed.

601
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:32,800
They always have a shank.
He got stuck right,

602
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:37,570
like a fucking prisoner.
Um, as enough time gone by,

603
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,070
then she can actually address
the foolishness of that death.

604
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:47,800
Like, let me fucking go. Just jump
on the back of a sting ray. You know,

605
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,060
and I'm not talking about the corvette
people I'm talking about the actual

606
00:36:52,061 --> 00:36:56,830
fucking fish were boasting. Ray,

607
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:02,300
you gotta watch that little stab.
You in the heart.

608
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:08,140
You swim to the surface and pulleys loud.

609
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:15,130
I'm sorry. Anyways, this is the
podcast for this Thursday afternoon.

610
00:37:15,131 --> 00:37:18,130
Have a wonderful weekend. You cuts, uh,

611
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:21,310
my condolences to that kid in the Lowe's
parking lot into the crocodile hunter.

612
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:25,000
Even a Paul Hogan. You know,
I don't know what he's up to.

613
00:37:25,001 --> 00:37:29,320
I hope he's got a new hat though,
you know. Nice new fresh hat. Um,

614
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:30,490
and with that,

615
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:33,010
here's a little bit of music from
Andrew [inaudible] and a little bit of

616
00:37:33,011 --> 00:37:34,120
throwback podcasts

617
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,310
from a,
from a year ago.

618
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:04,190
I'm not crazy.

619
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:13,190
I know Brown with assessment and Brett,

620
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:14,803
what'd Y'all bread?

621
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,660
And that was,
uh,

622
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:39,990
and that is, it built a bit of
a dilemma here for you. I'm an

623
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:44,460
18 year old male who's about to graduate
from high school. Congratulations.

624
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,050
Um, over the past few years I've been
told I'm a really good dancer. Uh,

625
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:53,940
not ballet or artsy stuff,
but just good dance floor dancing.

626
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:59,520
Oh my God. I'm going to take over the
dance floor. Hey Angie, watch me. Yeah.

627
00:38:59,521 --> 00:39:02,760
John Travolta. This is great.
Do you go out to the, uh,

628
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:05,880
Staten Island Bridge and do headstands
with your, with your buddy Bobby?

629
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,420
You know,
if he didn't have an Afro,

630
00:39:09,421 --> 00:39:12,780
he never would have fell off that
bridge if you had it high and tight.

631
00:39:12,781 --> 00:39:17,120
Like all these Armenians out here, all,
every Armenian looks like they know, uh,

632
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:20,430
they, they know. Um, m m m a moose,

633
00:39:20,431 --> 00:39:25,140
last time you saw an Armenian dude in
his twenties or thirties and he did not

634
00:39:25,141 --> 00:39:28,110
look like he could put you in an arm bar
within two seconds if you want it to,

635
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:30,750
if I would,

636
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:35,750
if I was a Dana white and I was running
the UFC at one point at this point,

637
00:39:36,991 --> 00:39:41,610
what they're up to like what?
Like UFC 2006,

638
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:46,050
you know, they like run it, they've run
out of adjectives this time. It's really,

639
00:39:46,051 --> 00:39:49,140
really personal. Right. Not Saying
I'm not a fan, I'm a huge fucking fan.

640
00:39:49,141 --> 00:39:52,720
I'm just saying, you
know, the way they, they,

641
00:39:52,721 --> 00:39:56,210
they have those things like every other
week there's only so many, like, you know,

642
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:59,950
redemption. Yeah. I mean,
you've running out of words. Um,

643
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:04,670
I'm such a fucking idiot. This is what
I would do if I was dating a white.

644
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:07,620
At some point I would have, you
know, you know what I would,

645
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:08,640
this is what I would branch off.

646
00:40:08,641 --> 00:40:12,060
And when they had those
tough man competitions and
they would have just people

647
00:40:12,061 --> 00:40:13,560
coming in,
throwing haymakers,

648
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:16,620
which is some of the best boxing ever
is when you watch people who just aren't

649
00:40:16,621 --> 00:40:19,080
trained whatsoever and they just start,
you know,

650
00:40:19,081 --> 00:40:21,180
cause somebody is going to connect.
Right.

651
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:25,530
I think that they should have one week
they should have the Armenians versus the

652
00:40:25,531 --> 00:40:29,370
Russians. Tough man competition.
Because I really think that that needs,

653
00:40:29,371 --> 00:40:34,020
it needs to be decided who is
the tougher of the two, uh,

654
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:37,740
cause up more now when it
comes to white people. That's,

655
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:40,830
that's who I got my money
on. All right. That, those,

656
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:45,690
those are the crips and the bloods of
white people is the army and the Russians,

657
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:50,490
all of them, they just have that vibe.
Does something you just like. Yeah,

658
00:40:50,491 --> 00:40:54,570
I'm not fucking with that guy. Just
really, I'm really not doing it anyways.

659
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:57,780
Uh, not a ballet or artsy stuff. Uh,

660
00:40:57,850 --> 00:41:02,200
but just ballroom dance in a
fucking dead soon over here. Uh,

661
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:06,690
I kind of think of think dancing is
gay from an outside point of view.

662
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:12,240
Um, I, I, it isn't, it really isn't.

663
00:41:12,241 --> 00:41:13,800
That's just how white people look at it.

664
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:17,580
It's considered gay cause it involves
like letting yourself go and actually

665
00:41:17,581 --> 00:41:22,530
admitting that you have emotions as a
man, as a white male. Yeah, it's, yeah,

666
00:41:22,531 --> 00:41:25,260
it is. It's considered gay. Um,

667
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:31,430
as his crying as is showing any sort of
emotion as is not dying for no good God

668
00:41:32,671 --> 00:41:37,230
damn. Before you're 56, um
Oh, not dying. I should say.

669
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:40,950
If you live to be 60, I believe amongst
white men, that's also considered gay.

670
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:43,800
Cause that means at some point you
cried something out of your chest and he

671
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:47,280
didn't have a heart attack.
Um, anyways, he says,

672
00:41:47,281 --> 00:41:50,190
I think dancing is gay from
an outside point of view,

673
00:41:50,191 --> 00:41:54,660
but I'll be the first one to admit that
I'm actually a pretty good dancer if I

674
00:41:54,661 --> 00:41:57,720
didn't think so, I wouldn't be out
there doing it. Yeah. But Dude,

675
00:41:57,721 --> 00:42:02,700
you gotta be getting some, I'll, I'll
fucking women love a guy who can dance.

676
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:06,660
Dude, if you can dance and you're wearing
like a silk scarf, it's fucking over.

677
00:42:06,661 --> 00:42:09,660
It's going to be rain in policy.
As far as my outside view,

678
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:14,130
my freckled view from over in the bar
trying to stand out from underneath those

679
00:42:14,131 --> 00:42:16,610
hot lights so I don't get burned.
Uh,

680
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:20,640
do you know red heads where the
closest thing to vampires, you know,

681
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:25,860
we have,
we have none of the powers of vampires,

682
00:42:25,861 --> 00:42:27,740
but the sun affects us the same.

683
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:36,000
A friend of mine who was a female dead
keeps telling me I could make money doing

684
00:42:36,001 --> 00:42:40,620
it on commercials or music videos.
Parentheses close on.

685
00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:43,200
Or You could go to fucking Broadway.

686
00:42:43,201 --> 00:42:48,150
It'd be like one of the five straight
men who dances on Broadway and just tag

687
00:42:48,151 --> 00:42:52,470
every fucking lonely chick out
there who's all stretched out.

688
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:56,790
Just make sure you keep those shoes on.
Dancers' feet are always fucked up. Uh,

689
00:42:56,820 --> 00:43:00,120
here's where it gets complicated.
I plan on becoming a policeman.

690
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:01,770
Okay?

691
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:04,230
Oh Dude, this is, this is a no
brainer. You need to dance it.

692
00:43:04,231 --> 00:43:08,160
Bachelorette parties dressed
as a cop. All you need, dude,

693
00:43:08,161 --> 00:43:12,480
is that a fig uniform on a boombox and
you're on your way to making money. Dude,

694
00:43:12,481 --> 00:43:16,620
you should fucking do that in a second.
And then you write a book about it.

695
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:21,900
I was a gyrate and cop for Bachelorette
parties and you write a tell all book

696
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:25,800
about how many fucking broads who bought
ready got married? You get married,

697
00:43:25,801 --> 00:43:28,560
sucked your Dick. You really
need help on this one. I mean,

698
00:43:28,561 --> 00:43:29,520
I'm going to read the rest of it,

699
00:43:29,521 --> 00:43:31,980
but I think I've already
come with a solution anyways.

700
00:43:31,981 --> 00:43:34,560
How is anyone supposed to take
me seriously on the force?

701
00:43:34,561 --> 00:43:38,820
If there's a video going with me,
pop and locking next, a little Wayne.

702
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:42,030
At the same time, I'll, dude, you
should fucking pull people over.

703
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:43,700
Okay.

704
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:45,320
You should pull people
over and fucking moon.

705
00:43:45,321 --> 00:43:47,420
Walk up to their car
and just freak them out.

706
00:43:48,110 --> 00:43:50,500
Even if they were reaching for a gun,
they'd be laughing too hard and they,

707
00:43:50,501 --> 00:43:53,270
they wouldn't shoot you. Then you
can rest them and then you move up.

708
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:57,980
Next thing you know, you're a
commissioner. Alright. Nothing anyways,

709
00:43:57,981 --> 00:44:00,980
at the same time, I'm getting laid a
lot because of it. Of course you are.

710
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:06,260
I'm a seven on a scale of 10. I like
this guy. He's honest and um, uh,

711
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:08,540
and like having a jump shot.

712
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:13,010
It's put me up to an eight
five I'm banging tense.

713
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:15,470
I've always wanted to be
a cop at the parks here.

714
00:44:15,471 --> 00:44:19,250
Seen better if I was able to make
money doing it in the dancing thing,

715
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:24,640
I wouldn't just be getting hammers
for letting gross moms off on speeding

716
00:44:24,711 --> 00:44:29,390
tickets. I could be bagging J
lo. She's into dancers. Right?

717
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:34,570
Thanks. Yeah, Dude. Apps
a Fuckin lutely dude.

718
00:44:34,571 --> 00:44:37,660
You're basically saying,
what should I do here?

719
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:44,160
Should I bang j Lo's beat down at the
club and make all this fucking money or

720
00:44:44,831 --> 00:44:48,670
should I take a job where I'm going
to get shot at and not be appreciated?

721
00:44:50,350 --> 00:44:53,290
You know, I'll tell you every cop
out there with dance if they could,

722
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:56,430
as opposed to being a cop, I don't care
if they had like seven generations in.

723
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:02,620
Dude, this is what I think of as
far as like dancing. I think if I,

724
00:45:02,621 --> 00:45:06,340
if I
like compare it to being a comedian,

725
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:11,410
oh the open mics would be getting a
piece of cardboard and being on a subway

726
00:45:11,411 --> 00:45:13,120
platform,
making money that way.

727
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:18,750
And then when you move up to hosting a
show that would be addressed as a cop and

728
00:45:18,941 --> 00:45:22,600
you're fucking dance at Bachelorette
parties. That's what you do on the side.

729
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:27,520
That's like you fucking day
job that bullshit. And then
during the day, I, yeah,

730
00:45:27,521 --> 00:45:29,050
I would try out for those.
Fuck I don't,

731
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:33,460
do they make music videos
anymore or fucking uh,

732
00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:38,320
I dunno. I, I believe it or not, I don't
know how to climb the ladder as a dancer.

733
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:40,510
But dude,

734
00:45:40,511 --> 00:45:44,650
apps a Fuckin lutely if you
can make money doing that shit.

735
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:50,510
And then what the great thing is, is once
you get to a certain level to, to, uh,

736
00:45:50,810 --> 00:45:54,260
make more money, you know, once
you got some credibility, you can,

737
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:58,700
you always have the, the fall back
where you can teach a class they get,

738
00:45:58,701 --> 00:45:59,331
you can be like,

739
00:45:59,331 --> 00:46:03,350
I danced for nine years and Chitty
Chitty Bang Bang and fucking banged every

740
00:46:03,351 --> 00:46:05,850
fucking brought on there.
And then if you'd like to not have,

741
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:08,570
fuck the women in your cast
while still not losing your job,

742
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:12,500
come on down to Frankie's fucking
day in studio, whatever. Just,

743
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:17,750
you'll figure it out as you go in
there and um, yeah, absolutely.

744
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:21,980
Absolute fucking Luli I would
definitely do it. You want to do what?

745
00:46:21,981 --> 00:46:26,600
He would've taken the
time, um, to write in.

746
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:29,850
So your big fears should be whatever.
But everybody's big fear.

747
00:46:29,851 --> 00:46:33,410
It's like what if I fucking go after this
dream and I'm 30 and I'm sleeping on a

748
00:46:33,411 --> 00:46:36,380
Fuckin futon and it hasn't happened yet.
Well I've got to tell you something sir.

749
00:46:36,381 --> 00:46:38,840
I'd been there.
I was there at fucking 34.

750
00:46:38,841 --> 00:46:42,440
I was still sleeping on a futon and a
fucking studio apartment that they called

751
00:46:42,441 --> 00:46:46,010
a one bedroom cause they slammed a fucking
wall in there and put a door on it.

752
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:49,640
And then one day I was trying to bang
the girl upstairs who had the fucking

753
00:46:49,641 --> 00:46:51,710
apartment right above me and

754
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:54,890
it was the exact same unit
and hers was a studio,

755
00:46:54,891 --> 00:46:57,350
but she had been there longer so
they never slammed a wall in there.

756
00:46:57,650 --> 00:47:00,770
And I realized, hey wait a minute,
I'm getting fucked. You know,

757
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:03,260
I should go down there and try to
get some money taken off of this.

758
00:47:03,261 --> 00:47:06,890
I should go down to the,
uh, they're fucking me over
rental board. But I didn't,

759
00:47:07,550 --> 00:47:12,080
I said fucking just keep writing
jokes, right? So whatever,

760
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,790
oh, you got to do, you just got
to commit to this shit and uh,

761
00:47:16,791 --> 00:47:17,870
and then realize that,
you know,

762
00:47:17,871 --> 00:47:21,410
sleeping on food tone when you're
30 is not the worst thing. It isn't.

763
00:47:21,470 --> 00:47:24,380
You don't see them. You know, it's
worse than sleeping on futons if 30,

764
00:47:24,410 --> 00:47:28,130
sleeping in a king bed next to a fuck
a woman you're not really in love with,

765
00:47:28,131 --> 00:47:30,460
but for some reason and uh,

766
00:47:30,461 --> 00:47:33,670
you've got a couple of kids and you've
got a job that you fucking hate, okay?

767
00:47:33,671 --> 00:47:37,830
You'll be laying there fantasizing about
fucking sleeping on a, on a, on a, uh,

768
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:40,570
on a futon there.

769
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:45,250
There's no risk when you go after a dream,
it's all fucking reward.

770
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,530
It's all going to lead to something good.
It always does.

771
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:52,860
There's a tremendous amount of
risk to playing it safe and uh,

772
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:58,090
that leads to unbelievable
levels of the retina,

773
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:01,120
which is something else I've also
experienced, cause I'm an old one.

774
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:19,000
Ah,
shit shy.

775
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,410
This is entitled the freight to

776
00:48:43,570 --> 00:48:46,770
break up with girlfriend gonna read slow.

777
00:48:46,771 --> 00:48:50,930
So this takes up as much time
as possible. Hey Bill. Um,

778
00:48:51,150 --> 00:48:52,620
I'd like to get your advice on something.

779
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:55,890
I've been dating my girlfriend for
almost a year now and I've been thinking

780
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:00,610
about breaking up with her. Well, it's
time to break up with their sir. Alright.

781
00:49:01,310 --> 00:49:02,730
In Dayton and for a year,
you know,

782
00:49:02,790 --> 00:49:06,110
you have to still even thinking
about breaking it. It's time. Okay.

783
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:11,850
He says we get along fine and we rarely
argue. I was just thinking of a great,

784
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:16,620
a great way to break up with someone
they should invent like a breakup suit,

785
00:49:17,010 --> 00:49:17,843
right?

786
00:49:17,910 --> 00:49:20,850
Just something where you just can not
get injured and you just put the thing on

787
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:23,970
with the fucking helmet.
You don't wear the helmet,

788
00:49:23,971 --> 00:49:27,300
you just put the ones the zip up on and
which totally protects everything. Right?

789
00:49:27,810 --> 00:49:31,840
And then you get in the passenger
seat and you let her drive. Oh,

790
00:49:31,910 --> 00:49:34,370
why are you gonna let me drive?
Why did you just drive tonight?

791
00:49:34,410 --> 00:49:39,300
But you always liked to drive
honey, you just drive. Okay,

792
00:49:39,301 --> 00:49:43,110
why are you wearing that suit? It's all
gonna make sense in about five miles,

793
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:45,300
right?
You get out on the fucking highway.

794
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:50,280
He just started talking to her and out
of no way, he just put the helmet on,

795
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:54,900
you know, when she says, what are
you doing? And just say, listen,

796
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,530
I don't want to go out with you anymore.
And then she goes, what? And you go, hey,

797
00:49:58,531 --> 00:50:01,380
watch this. He just opened the door
and you roll out of the fucking car.

798
00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:05,400
That's it. You're out. You know,

799
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:07,590
type up a fake police report.

800
00:50:07,591 --> 00:50:09,630
You told me you died and
then she feels bad for you.

801
00:50:09,631 --> 00:50:13,230
You don't have to deal with any
sort of repercussions. Um, anyways,

802
00:50:13,231 --> 00:50:15,270
he says we get along
fine and we rarely argue,

803
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:18,990
but I'm starting to realize I don't really
want to be with her for the long haul.

804
00:50:19,370 --> 00:50:21,630
And we started dating,
oh, this fucking thing.

805
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:26,760
These iPad suck by the way. All
right. You know what an Ipad is?

806
00:50:26,761 --> 00:50:31,280
It's it's fucking laptop for pussies.
What's a matter? You laptop is too heavy.

807
00:50:31,281 --> 00:50:34,880
You fucking douchebag this thing doesn't
have a keyboard. It's got nothing.

808
00:50:34,970 --> 00:50:37,760
You think that they don't know how to
make this thing into a fucking laptop

809
00:50:37,761 --> 00:50:39,140
already?
Of course they do.

810
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:44,030
This is this Steve jobs way of doing
things rather than just giving you the

811
00:50:44,031 --> 00:50:46,700
whole fucking thing. He's going to
give you tea an inch increments,

812
00:50:46,701 --> 00:50:50,130
like a God damn drug dealer.
You know I,

813
00:50:50,131 --> 00:50:53,690
that's why I haven't bought one of
these yet. This is knee is by the way,

814
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:58,670
bar of this fucking thing and I am
not enjoying it. As you can tell us,

815
00:50:58,671 --> 00:51:01,370
I'm throwing a temper tan from here.
You know what?

816
00:51:01,371 --> 00:51:04,490
I'm going to buy a fucking IPAD.
I'm going to buy it when it is a laptop,

817
00:51:04,491 --> 00:51:07,340
when it is a little light laptop.
Until then I'm not,

818
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:11,090
I'm not having this fucking this. This is
like a, this is like when you, you know,

819
00:51:11,091 --> 00:51:11,810
you go, I, you know,

820
00:51:11,810 --> 00:51:15,170
I really want to get the new Camaro
and then you get the one with the v six

821
00:51:15,171 --> 00:51:17,900
engine rather than getting the
full out one with the stick shift,

822
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:23,420
which is a laptop, right.
He's too heavy, you know,

823
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:28,670
fucking deuce. Do Shoulders
at the gym next time you do
that. Okay. Maybe do that.

824
00:51:28,671 --> 00:51:32,000
Maybe to do some stuff to
build up your risks. Oh God,

825
00:51:32,001 --> 00:51:35,450
they'll can you get through the question?
All right. I, well, um, he says, uh,

826
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:37,640
when we first started dating,
I loved hanging out with her,

827
00:51:37,641 --> 00:51:41,480
but I'm just not into anymore. Does
that make me an asshole? No, it doesn't.

828
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:44,030
Why would your own true feelings
make you an Asshole, sir?

829
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:49,460
How awful were your parents? Um, he
says, I'm 23 years old with the somewhat,

830
00:51:49,461 --> 00:51:51,710
why am I, you know, something to
really being a cunt this week,

831
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:55,370
guys asking for my advice. Let's, let's
try to bring the younger down. Bill,

832
00:51:55,970 --> 00:51:58,580
you're frustrated.
It's fucking hot in here.

833
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:01,400
You can't open the window
because you say cunt too much.

834
00:52:01,401 --> 00:52:03,740
This building's a co op and
they'll kick you up. Okay.

835
00:52:03,741 --> 00:52:06,740
That's what's going on here. It has
nothing to do with this person. Okay.

836
00:52:08,330 --> 00:52:11,420
Why don't you just try to be a nice
guy so I should've done off the mic.

837
00:52:11,421 --> 00:52:13,430
Like I'm scolding myself.
Just try to be a nice guy.

838
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:17,540
Let's not take out your bad
day on everyone else. Okay?
You're embarrassing me.

839
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:19,550
All right.
I'm 23 years old,

840
00:52:19,551 --> 00:52:23,450
but somewhat of a decent job and really
just want to go back to being single for

841
00:52:23,451 --> 00:52:27,800
a while. Exactly. Dude,
you're 23 years old. Dude,

842
00:52:27,801 --> 00:52:29,600
you're fucking movie star at that age.

843
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:34,250
I don't care what you're
doing for a living. Should
definitely be single. I said,

844
00:52:34,251 --> 00:52:35,610
the problem is she's got a lot less,

845
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:38,330
she's got a lot of stress in her
life right now. Not your problem.

846
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:42,890
She's finishing nursing school and
trying to find a job. All right,

847
00:52:42,891 --> 00:52:46,610
well tell her to put on the outfit
Banger one more time and hey, watch this.

848
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:53,150
You bail out of the car.
That's mean. Um, anyways.

849
00:52:53,151 --> 00:52:58,040
He says, oh, and she has a history
of depression over the past year.

850
00:52:58,041 --> 00:53:01,280
I feel like she's becoming
emotionally dependent on me.

851
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:03,740
Like I'm keeping her going or something.
Well,

852
00:53:03,741 --> 00:53:07,520
Jesus Christ and what do you want to
get rid of her? You don't want this,

853
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:09,773
you know,

854
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:13,020
you want something that someone
that's going to be fun to be around.

855
00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:17,570
You don't want her, you know,
it's sunny out and she's like,

856
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:21,180
it's raining out that fucking
head under the pillow.

857
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:23,250
Okay,

858
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:23,761
well these days,

859
00:53:23,761 --> 00:53:25,870
you know he stayed with that long
enough one these days you just going to,

860
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:29,690
it's going to smother it
with that pillow is anyways.

861
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:34,700
So how do I go about breaking up with
her while causing the least amount of

862
00:53:34,831 --> 00:53:37,820
damage?
Uh,

863
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:41,280
he said also she always leaves some
of her shit and my apartment. Yes.

864
00:53:41,281 --> 00:53:45,810
Cause she's, she wants to
fucking, she's clinging onto you.

865
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:48,540
It says close blanket.
Other random shit.

866
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:53,050
I tried to get her to take a shit home
with her, but how do I avoid after, uh,

867
00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:56,790
the after break up coming over
to get my stuff. I hate that.

868
00:53:58,470 --> 00:54:00,510
Anyway. Go Fuck Yourself. All right,

869
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:02,273
look,

870
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:07,430
there's no way. There's no easy way
to break up with somebody. All right.

871
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:10,910
There's just easier ways.
Uh,

872
00:54:11,510 --> 00:54:12,770
the sooner the better.

873
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:15,233
MMM.

874
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:20,510
Oh Diane, I'll do it. This is like, this
is like dismantling a bomb. So you know,

875
00:54:20,511 --> 00:54:24,710
what you would like to do is
say, Hey, can you come by today?

876
00:54:24,711 --> 00:54:27,710
I want to talk to you about something.
Right. And she always share.

877
00:54:27,711 --> 00:54:30,650
I'll be right over and then
immediately just take out a box,

878
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:35,530
put all of her shit in it, tape it up
and then she rings the bell. Bing Bong.

879
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:37,790
You opened the door, he got, yeah,
don't want to date you anymore.

880
00:54:37,791 --> 00:54:39,590
And he just handed the
box and close the door.

881
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:43,610
Right to this money to
be made in this man.

882
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:48,620
Does anybody have a professional breakup
service at such a pussy thing to do?

883
00:54:48,621 --> 00:54:52,820
But that would be phenomenal.
You know it, you feel,

884
00:54:52,821 --> 00:54:54,680
you make a person feel
like they got fired.

885
00:54:55,370 --> 00:54:59,240
You're like when a corporation fires
you and just to security people show up,

886
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:03,920
you know, confiscate your computer and
then escort you out of the building.

887
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,930
When that be great do,
that's what you should do.

888
00:55:05,931 --> 00:55:08,510
Just hire to your friends to
dress up like security guards.

889
00:55:08,511 --> 00:55:10,760
Tell her you want to break up,
you know,

890
00:55:10,761 --> 00:55:14,090
and then they have all their shit
in the box. Then they escort,

891
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:17,030
escort or right out of your apartment
building. Like she got fired.

892
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:21,620
They come off as professional
rather than like personal. Um,

893
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:25,990
how do you go about breaking up with
it? You know what I would do? Uh,

894
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:30,650
I wouldn't put all his shit in the box
because that's going to come off cold,

895
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:36,110
you know, and you don't want to hurt her
failings like that. So I would just, uh,

896
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:41,720
uh, fuck it. I don't know. I don't know
how to do it. Why did I drink last night?

897
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:44,060
And then I got up and did opie and
Anthony, what the fuck is wrong with me?

898
00:55:44,061 --> 00:55:47,570
I knew I had a podcast to
do. He embarrassing. Um,

899
00:55:49,310 --> 00:55:50,020
okay.

900
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:53,620
I don't fucking know. Have a
come over and just say, listen,

901
00:55:55,130 --> 00:55:59,530
I'm not happy. Oh, that's a great
one. That's a classic. You know,

902
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:02,170
like if you were a singer songwriter
the second he said that the whole crowd

903
00:56:02,171 --> 00:56:04,540
would start applauding,
recognizing the big hit,

904
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:06,993
you know,

905
00:56:08,650 --> 00:56:13,600
of all the girls I do before, you know,
they all start fucking clapping. You know,

906
00:56:13,601 --> 00:56:18,070
if they just came out, you just had
classic breakup monologues, listen, um,

907
00:56:18,550 --> 00:56:21,160
I'm just not happy.
Everyone just at smattering of applause.

908
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:24,780
You wait for it to die down.
Let the orchestra come around again.

909
00:56:24,930 --> 00:56:29,320
She jumped back in on
the one, um, matched.

910
00:56:29,321 --> 00:56:32,860
Tell you're not happy. I'm
not happy anymore. And Dude,
let me tell you something.

911
00:56:32,861 --> 00:56:36,250
Her being depressed is not your
fucking problem. All right?

912
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:41,170
Her being depressed is the fucking
problem. How can you do this to me?

913
00:56:41,950 --> 00:56:43,840
What do you mean? How can I do this
too? You don't want to be words.

914
00:56:43,841 --> 00:56:46,390
If I fucking stayed with you and I didn't
love you, I don't love you anymore.

915
00:56:47,050 --> 00:56:49,570
I don't love you.
Depressed whore.

916
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:51,220
Okay.

917
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:56,050
I just called you a whore as a
generic term. You know, I don't, I'm,

918
00:56:56,051 --> 00:56:59,860
I'm not happy. I want to, okay. I just
feel like want to be single right now.

919
00:56:59,861 --> 00:57:02,550
I just don't feel like I'm going
to be with you in long haul. Uh,

920
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:06,220
would just be wasting each other's time.
My time is important and so is yours.

921
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:09,880
All right? I don't want to go
anymore, but I'll tell you what.

922
00:57:09,881 --> 00:57:14,680
If you go to stamps.com, they'll give
you $55 free stamps to the scale.

923
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:19,690
That's what you do. Just tag every mean
thing you say with all the advertising.

924
00:57:21,090 --> 00:57:25,290
You know, if you go to amazon.com
so bill burrs website, you know,

925
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:29,540
click on the Little Amazon banner,
whatever you buy, you know,

926
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:31,960
portion of that money
goes back to bill burn.

927
00:57:31,961 --> 00:57:34,590
Then the percentage of that goes
to the wounded warriors project.

928
00:57:34,591 --> 00:57:37,230
So I know I'm breaking up with
you right now, but you could,

929
00:57:37,290 --> 00:57:39,000
we could also support the troops,

930
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:41,093
right,

931
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:44,630
sir? Look, there's no
fucking easy way to do this.

932
00:57:44,631 --> 00:57:47,630
And you're going to be sitting there.
How many more holidays?

933
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:52,100
How many more birthdays? How many more
Christmases, which is a holiday? Sorry,

934
00:57:52,130 --> 00:57:54,710
he always need three examples. Do you
want to go through with this person?

935
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:58,490
How many more times do you want to go
out and rent bikes? Go to a picnic,

936
00:57:58,580 --> 00:58:03,140
sit there on a sunny day. Is she sitting
there with that cloud over fucking head?

937
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:05,033
You know,

938
00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:09,190
don't you know,
don't do that to yourself.

939
00:58:10,310 --> 00:58:13,870
He might have fucking people who have
just wonderful human beings and they just

940
00:58:13,871 --> 00:58:17,440
end up with assholes. I
swear to God, assholes.

941
00:58:17,450 --> 00:58:21,190
They look for wonderful
human beings because other
assholes are not going to put

942
00:58:21,191 --> 00:58:25,440
up with them, you know? So you need to be
an ass hole here and you know the, the,

943
00:58:25,441 --> 00:58:28,450
the how society looks as an, as an
asshole. Like you're being selfish,

944
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:30,610
not being selfish, all
right? Choose yourself,

945
00:58:30,611 --> 00:58:33,550
choose your own fucking life
dumper and get on with your life.

946
00:58:35,310 --> 00:58:36,143
You don't,

947
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:37,530
this is what you do.

948
00:58:37,530 --> 00:58:41,250
You get yourself by six of fucking
Pale Ale or whatever beer you like.

949
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:45,300
You stick a couple of glasses
in the fucking freezer.

950
00:58:46,910 --> 00:58:47,743
All right?

951
00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:51,920
Like anticipation of this championship
that you know you're gonna win. You know,

952
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:55,850
like they did in the red sox dugout when
they had the champagne on ice in game

953
00:58:55,851 --> 00:59:00,380
six in 1986 before they had
to quickly wheel it out, okay?

954
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:02,610
Except you're not going to let
this one go through your legs.

955
00:59:02,611 --> 00:59:06,320
Are you kicking this one right in the
cunt and you taking home the fucking

956
00:59:06,321 --> 00:59:09,200
championship and when it's over all
you got to be just thinking about those

957
00:59:09,201 --> 00:59:11,990
frosty fucking bruise in the fridge.
Just think about that.

958
00:59:12,410 --> 00:59:15,590
Just look at the clock when she walks in.
All right.

959
00:59:16,130 --> 00:59:20,150
Let's say she comes in at 10 past two.
Just say to yourself,

960
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:23,800
worst scenario by three fucking 30,

961
00:59:25,150 --> 00:59:28,810
I'm going to be sitting down in
this fucking couch. All right,

962
00:59:29,710 --> 00:59:31,810
with my goddamn phone off,

963
00:59:32,350 --> 00:59:36,790
drinking a couple of five or six
of these things and then that's it.

964
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:38,933
All right.

965
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:44,380
And then don't fucking
have a post breakup sex.

966
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:47,710
Don't do that. Cause then she'll
think that you're back together again.

967
00:59:47,711 --> 00:59:52,560
Fuck all of that. All right. In
your mind, just think gotta come by.

968
00:59:52,590 --> 00:59:57,280
Yeah, my staff. Okay. When
do you want to come by?

969
00:59:57,580 --> 01:00:00,160
This is coming off really cold.

970
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:04,390
She's got to do all of that and just
try to keep dragging you back into the

971
01:00:04,391 --> 01:00:06,970
fucking thing.
Um,

972
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:13,630
I dunno if this is a punk thing to do,
but after you break up with her,

973
01:00:13,631 --> 01:00:16,960
just don't answer the phone when she calls
and then she'll find, just say, listen,

974
01:00:16,961 --> 01:00:21,130
I got a, I got to come by. Get
my stuff. Can you text her back?

975
01:00:21,131 --> 01:00:24,670
I fucking just be a man. What is
she going to do? Body Slam you.

976
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:28,600
She's just going to make you feel bad.
All right?

977
01:00:29,270 --> 01:00:30,360
Ooh

978
01:00:31,890 --> 01:00:34,720
is a good little blue you would do.

979
01:00:37,130 --> 01:00:41,080
No, it's cause you're a mopey.
You're sucking the life out of me.

980
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:44,260
You know when,
when you get that sad look on your face,

981
01:00:44,261 --> 01:00:47,560
you look like a muppet there.
I said it all right.

982
01:00:47,590 --> 01:00:49,030
There's your shit over
there in the corner.

983
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:51,910
I got a couple of cool ones in the fridge,
so why don't you do me a favor.

984
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:54,250
All right, get over there. Bend
Down, lift with your knees,

985
01:00:54,490 --> 01:00:57,670
get your shit and get the fuck
out of here. When he say that,

986
01:00:57,671 --> 01:01:02,560
touch your prince charming is
out there somewhere. You know,

987
01:01:03,150 --> 01:01:06,880
and it ain't here. I'm not
riding that horse anymore. Okay?

988
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:10,240
I just shot it in the back
of the head. It's over. Okay,

989
01:01:10,241 --> 01:01:12,700
so why don't you trudge on out of here?
They're fucking Cinderella.

990
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:17,140
Go look at a mirror. I go climb up in
a tower and fucking drop your hair out.

991
01:01:17,141 --> 01:01:20,590
Whatever the fuck he supposed
to do. Kiss a frog. All right,

992
01:01:20,591 --> 01:01:24,110
I got drinking to do [inaudible] beat it.

993
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:29,850
Something like that. Like I said, all
that bullshit. I said 10 past two,

994
01:01:29,851 --> 01:01:32,680
it's over by three 30. By
three 30, you're boozing.

995
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:34,753
All right.

996
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:40,770
I don't know.
Now they're fucking brutal breaking up

997
01:01:42,370 --> 01:01:43,280
often this at this fight.

998
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:44,793
But other than that

999
01:01:59,380 --> 01:02:04,380
[inaudible] [inaudible]

1000
01:02:36,090 --> 01:02:36,923
I

1001
01:02:41,430 --> 01:02:42,263
dunno,

1002
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:45,190
I've been all over the map politically,
but it's why like, you know,

1003
01:02:45,290 --> 01:02:49,790
certain ways of looking at shit,
like when people talk about guns,

1004
01:02:49,791 --> 01:02:50,790
like let's just make them won't,

1005
01:02:50,791 --> 01:02:55,130
let's just make them illegal and
that nobody will have, um, you know,

1006
01:02:55,210 --> 01:02:58,030
like that's sort of like
thought process is you're,

1007
01:02:58,070 --> 01:03:03,070
you're acting as though the world is a
utopia and that there's not morons and

1008
01:03:03,741 --> 01:03:08,210
that there's not, uh, people who say,
I don't give a fuck what the rules are.

1009
01:03:08,211 --> 01:03:13,211
You're totally not even
taking into consideration
sociopath's which is why that

1010
01:03:13,521 --> 01:03:15,530
new fucking thing that Obama signed,

1011
01:03:15,531 --> 01:03:20,210
that whole defense package where now they
can just arrest people without a trial.

1012
01:03:20,211 --> 01:03:22,690
Jay put you in jail forever with,

1013
01:03:22,850 --> 01:03:26,450
without a trial because they just think
you're a fucking terrorist. Geeky kid.

1014
01:03:26,780 --> 01:03:30,740
Give people that level of power.
I'm a fucking moron.

1015
01:03:30,741 --> 01:03:33,110
And I know you can't do that.
Historically,

1016
01:03:33,260 --> 01:03:36,080
no one has ever handled
that level of power. Well,

1017
01:03:36,410 --> 01:03:39,160
anybody here want to go live in China?
Oh,

1018
01:03:39,170 --> 01:03:42,740
we out there practicing and nunchucks
wearing your wooden slippers and all of a

1019
01:03:42,741 --> 01:03:45,620
sudden a van pulls up and you
disappear and that's it forever.

1020
01:03:46,010 --> 01:03:47,360
You want to live there?
Of course you don't.

1021
01:03:47,570 --> 01:03:50,060
You want to live here where they can't
fucking do it. Well, they can do it now.

1022
01:03:51,050 --> 01:03:54,830
You know? They just put in a fucking
order for a bunch of black fans.

1023
01:03:55,070 --> 01:03:59,120
That's what I heard. Gordon Dot. Holy
shit.com that's what's going down.

1024
01:03:59,540 --> 01:04:04,540
I don't understand why stuff at that
level that affects citizens to that level.

1025
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:08,330
Why we don't get to vote on it.

1026
01:04:09,770 --> 01:04:13,040
Do you think it's because
we'd say, Hey, you know what?

1027
01:04:13,041 --> 01:04:17,600
Fuck that you want to stand like
that is just a jump off point.

1028
01:04:17,601 --> 01:04:19,490
Do you think like that's just
how it's going to smell as well.

1029
01:04:19,510 --> 01:04:22,060
You're not a terrorist dinner.
You ain't got to fuck bro.

1030
01:04:22,220 --> 01:04:24,260
You think it's just
going to stop with that.

1031
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:26,840
That's not how you take away freedom.

1032
01:04:26,841 --> 01:04:30,110
You don't just fucking do it all in
one fail swoop. It's incremental.

1033
01:04:30,710 --> 01:04:33,290
It's just like when you're dating some
fucking woman and you're not paying

1034
01:04:33,291 --> 01:04:36,590
attention and she just gradually, every
day it takes another foot of real estate.

1035
01:04:36,830 --> 01:04:38,620
Next thing you know you're
in goal line day going,

1036
01:04:38,630 --> 01:04:43,320
how the fuck did I end up in
this situation? He started
at the 50 little push,

1037
01:04:43,321 --> 01:04:45,300
a little poll, right? Everything
was fine. [inaudible] casino,

1038
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:46,250
you're up against the Golan.

1039
01:04:46,580 --> 01:04:50,130
You think that they're just going to keep
it with the terrorist thing, you know?

1040
01:04:50,290 --> 01:04:54,140
You know they'll wait for a whole nother
generation of babies to be born and

1041
01:04:54,141 --> 01:04:57,500
they always grew up with government having
that level of power and then they add

1042
01:04:57,501 --> 01:05:00,620
something else to it. Then they
had something else. Then that's it.

1043
01:05:01,970 --> 01:05:03,770
You can't have,
okay,

1044
01:05:03,950 --> 01:05:08,840
if tiger woods can't handle the
level of free pussy on a golf tour,

1045
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:14,320
how the fuck is our government going
to handle a new defense package?

1046
01:05:15,861 --> 01:05:18,030
Which basically gave them a mute button.

1047
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:19,740
Okay.

1048
01:05:19,740 --> 01:05:24,050
When you love the Ha, how would you
handle that if you had that power, do you,

1049
01:05:24,090 --> 01:05:27,090
how long before you just
started abusing that?

1050
01:05:27,091 --> 01:05:31,770
If you could just hit mute on anybody
who ever disagreed with you and it just,

1051
01:05:31,830 --> 01:05:33,630
and you could have them whisked away.

1052
01:05:38,130 --> 01:05:41,250
I mean that is just sociopath's wet dream.

1053
01:05:42,270 --> 01:05:44,790
That's what that is.
That is a fucking mute button,

1054
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:50,520
Mr Style and don't you think that's it?
He hit mute. You're done. You're gone.

1055
01:05:50,730 --> 01:05:54,150
See Ya. I think, I think it's,

1056
01:05:54,170 --> 01:05:57,540
it's fucking insane and I'm,

1057
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:02,880
the only thing that I get out of it is
that I feel like I was proven correct

1058
01:06:03,930 --> 01:06:05,790
that I don't think it
matters at that level.

1059
01:06:05,791 --> 01:06:10,320
Whether you vote Democrat or Republican
Obama, the first black president ever,

1060
01:06:10,321 --> 01:06:15,321
you would think this would be the most
liberal a politician in the history of

1061
01:06:16,201 --> 01:06:17,034
this country.

1062
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:18,400
Okay.

1063
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:21,610
Because of his background, you would
think that he signed off on that shit.

1064
01:06:22,550 --> 01:06:23,050
Okay.

1065
01:06:23,050 --> 01:06:27,240
All right. I'm telling you, I don't know
what happens when you become president,

1066
01:06:27,241 --> 01:06:32,241
but I think they let you peek just
enough behind the curtain and there was a

1067
01:06:32,311 --> 01:06:35,550
fucking agenda that we are
moving towards because it does.

1068
01:06:35,580 --> 01:06:38,160
I don't think it fucking matters.
I really don't,

1069
01:06:38,490 --> 01:06:43,490
which is why I always
vote for the Ralph Nader,

1070
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:48,610
the fucking Ron Paul, all those guys that
all those fucking idiots go, oh, do Kush.

1071
01:06:48,620 --> 01:06:53,580
You did that. You've ruined
the election. Really? Did I?

1072
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:56,020
Yeah.

1073
01:06:56,020 --> 01:06:58,720
I feel like those guys wouldn't
have signed shit like that.

1074
01:06:58,750 --> 01:07:02,170
I feel like their track record shows
that they would not sign shit like that.

1075
01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:06,550
I, I dunno. I have no,

1076
01:07:06,551 --> 01:07:09,130
I imagine I'm going to get a ton of
fucking emails I'm going with somebody was

1077
01:07:09,131 --> 01:07:13,630
yelling at me one time saying that
because I voted for Ralph Nader in 2000.

1078
01:07:13,631 --> 01:07:15,250
That's why George W.
Bush won.

1079
01:07:16,660 --> 01:07:19,510
And they was just going on and on and
on about it. And I was like, dude,

1080
01:07:19,511 --> 01:07:24,370
I live in New York. Al
Gore won my state. Okay.

1081
01:07:25,050 --> 01:07:28,960
Do you understand that? So
your whole fucking theory
right now is out the window.

1082
01:07:29,140 --> 01:07:33,420
I voted for Ralph Nader in New
York and Al Gore still one mistake.

1083
01:07:33,460 --> 01:07:37,840
So go fuck yourself. What
I'm trying to do, uh,

1084
01:07:38,340 --> 01:07:40,690
Mister fucking red and blue tie here,

1085
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:44,830
I'm trying to fucking encourage
more people like that to vote.

1086
01:07:44,831 --> 01:07:48,310
So mission accomplished. That's what I'm
trying to fuck and have to vote to run,

1087
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:50,583
you know

1088
01:07:52,290 --> 01:07:57,210
uncorruptible how far can you get if
you're uncorruptible I would say that you

1089
01:07:57,211 --> 01:08:02,000
can get to the, uh, what,

1090
01:08:02,001 --> 01:08:05,520
whatever level politics is when you
decide whether or not they should put a

1091
01:08:05,521 --> 01:08:10,510
gazebo in the center of town.
I think beat, once you get
beyond that, you got it.

1092
01:08:10,511 --> 01:08:11,820
You got to be a little dirty.
Right.

1093
01:08:13,350 --> 01:08:15,880
I love talking about this shit
cause it just stirs people up,

1094
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:18,280
you know?
Oh you know,

1095
01:08:18,281 --> 01:08:22,300
maybe you should all read a little more
before the next time you fucking own.

1096
01:08:23,710 --> 01:08:27,970
Really. What are you reading? What
are you reading? What they give you?

1097
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:29,530
Is that what you're reading?
Fuck head.

1098
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:32,680
Why you acting like you have clearance
to the bottom floors of the fucking

1099
01:08:32,681 --> 01:08:35,770
Pentagon, you're guessing?
Just like I am. All right,

1100
01:08:35,950 --> 01:08:39,100
Mr informed I read the pamphlet.

1101
01:08:40,030 --> 01:08:43,720
I don't buy a fucking word of it.
You know,

1102
01:08:45,190 --> 01:08:49,570
you can use coca cola to take rust
off of metal. You can use it for that.

1103
01:08:49,630 --> 01:08:50,463
You know,

1104
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:55,840
you understand that yet they're
still able to sell it to us.

1105
01:08:55,841 --> 01:08:56,770
Like it's refreshing.

1106
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:02,840
I Dunno what that point meant either

1107
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:00,740
[inaudible] [inaudible]

1108
01:10:12,860 --> 01:10:14,420
no,
Jackie Ladies and gentlemen.
