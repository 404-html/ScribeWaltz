1
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:05,610
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's
the Monday morning podcasts for Monday,

2
00:00:05,611 --> 00:00:10,140
February 17th, 2014. How's it going?

3
00:00:10,141 --> 00:00:13,560
How are you?
Are you enjoying this podcast so far?

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,350
I'll tell you if you're
listening to it on Monday,

5
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:22,040
Monday the 17th, I am
actually a man the fuck. And

6
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,760
that's why the podcast is out.
Um,

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,510
as you guys like to think
early or on time, I should say,

8
00:00:30,511 --> 00:00:34,260
it's early in my world.
All right. It's early.

9
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,480
Um, yeah, I'm on my way back to, uh,

10
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,170
back to the east coast to do a wonderful
run of shows starting Tuesday night

11
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,580
with the second annual Patrice.
So comedy benefit,

12
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,060
all money after the expenses.
Of course,

13
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,800
we do have to rent the place out after
we paid back for renting out the fucking

14
00:00:55,801 --> 00:01:00,290
bar. Yeah. All monies goes to
basically all the people that, uh,

15
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:04,770
were in Patricia's life that
he was supporting, you know,
his mom, his wife, and on,

16
00:01:04,771 --> 00:01:09,600
you know, stepdaughter and all that
stuff. So it's a wonderful thing. Um,

17
00:01:09,601 --> 00:01:12,180
if you didn't get tickets, uh, we're
going to do it again next year.

18
00:01:12,181 --> 00:01:14,240
We're going to do it every year. And
I know a lot of people like, well,

19
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:16,950
why does she have a fucking
donation button online?

20
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:20,250
Because I'm learning about
this shit. I'm learning. Okay.

21
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,870
Eventually every year it'll get bigger.
Maybe we can do two shows one year.

22
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,190
I don't know. Okay. I'm
new to the benefit thing.

23
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,600
I hope I don't have to do.

24
00:01:30,601 --> 00:01:33,720
And another benefit for anybody
else that I know in love. All right,

25
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,150
so there you go. That's
the, those are your,

26
00:01:36,151 --> 00:01:38,610
those are the answers to your questions.

27
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,750
And I know that a bunch of people are
gonna try to be helpful and it show me how

28
00:01:42,751 --> 00:01:45,870
to set something up through a,
you know,

29
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,480
I'm trying to raise money for my buddies,
you know,

30
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:52,740
loved ones.com or whatever.
I'm not going to be able to figure it out.

31
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,690
All right.
I am.

32
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:00,380
I am anti technology unless it is trying
to save people's lives or the lives of

33
00:02:04,141 --> 00:02:08,730
animals, nature. I don't mind that stuff.
But as far as all these fucking apps,

34
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,370
you can stick them on a ball,

35
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:16,170
turned them up sideways and shove
straight up Y'all candy. And no, sorry.

36
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,500
Had a rush of wrestling.
Fucking flashback. Dude.

37
00:02:19,501 --> 00:02:23,490
I just was trying to check in for
my flight. That's all I was doing.

38
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:28,770
Just an old freckled fuck on the computer.
All I want to do is check in.

39
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:32,070
All I want to do is Roma Zoom.
Zoom.

40
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,690
I didn't want to do is find
what airline I'm flying.

41
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,940
It's all, when does it leave?
Oh yes. That when it leaves.

42
00:02:41,941 --> 00:02:46,620
While I'll be sure to be there before it
takes off. All right, so what do I get?

43
00:02:46,621 --> 00:02:51,621
I get some fucking email from these
goddamn cunts and I can't access by

44
00:02:53,011 --> 00:02:56,490
itinerary unless I sign up for their APP.

45
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:01,210
Tripcase,
these mother fuckers just emailed me back.

46
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:03,680
Okay.

47
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,120
You're almost there. Verify your
email with TripCase. Go Fuck Yourself.

48
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:09,700
Yeah,

49
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,110
dude,
so I can basically,

50
00:03:11,111 --> 00:03:16,111
I can't view when my plane takes off or
lance because now I have to download of

51
00:03:18,581 --> 00:03:22,600
fucking app to say,
you know,

52
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:27,690
Eastern Airlines leaves your flight
leaves at fucking 11 in the morning and

53
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:33,751
arrives at 7:00 PM why do I
need an application for that?

54
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:39,270
Can somebody from this new world of fat
children where you don't go outside and

55
00:03:41,501 --> 00:03:45,940
you play your video games and you sext
one another in the fucking six grade.

56
00:03:45,941 --> 00:03:49,030
Can one of you now not, not at all.
Let's get out of that fucking world.

57
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,650
Could somebody of age

58
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:58,170
fucking tell me why in God's
name I would need this app.

59
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:03,100
I don't like the fucking word APP.
Download our APP.

60
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:08,510
Do you have our APP? I
literally, I have to just,

61
00:04:08,511 --> 00:04:10,490
just to find out when my
fucking plane takes off.

62
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,160
I had to fucking download this thing.
They wanted my,

63
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:17,750
they wanted me to sign in
with my email and my password.

64
00:04:17,751 --> 00:04:22,010
So now the console over there have
the fucking password to my email.

65
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:27,100
Like I, I'm, I don't, I don't understand
that. What do I need a password?

66
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:31,550
How do I know everybody at TripCase
is, is, is on the fucking level.

67
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,100
You don't,

68
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:38,030
if you're not trying to figure out how
to grow a kidney and a dish like a k and

69
00:04:38,031 --> 00:04:42,950
you're not out there trying to fucking
prolong the life of a Walrus, you know,

70
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:47,670
I guess I'm guilty of it too.
What do I do?

71
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:50,190
What do I do to hurt the environment?
What just what do I do?

72
00:04:50,191 --> 00:04:51,570
I take 40,000 flights a year.

73
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:00,360
I'm back to using Pam instead
of putting in the skillets,

74
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:06,060
you know, goes my wife wore me down.
Does Day why you just don't use Pam?

75
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:09,800
Okay,

76
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,880
fuck that bitch. You fucking
up the ozone layer. You know,

77
00:05:13,881 --> 00:05:17,870
I try to be like that. That does it.
That doesn't work. That doesn't work.

78
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:22,070
When you live with somebody, you know,
at some point you just gotta be like,

79
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,090
alright,
you know,

80
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:28,220
I'm sure there'll be plenty of ozone
left for my life as we sit here in the

81
00:05:28,221 --> 00:05:31,430
middle of this heat wave.
Um,

82
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,003
anyways.

83
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:35,330
Okay.

84
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:40,330
So I had to just bug somebody who's in
the middle of our weekend to tell her,

85
00:05:41,481 --> 00:05:44,060
can you just copy and
paste what airline I'm on,

86
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:47,830
where I'm going and when can you do that
so and I don't have to go to TripCase

87
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,390
and download their fucking app?

88
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:51,880
Yeah.

89
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,520
Jesus [inaudible] is it really the
fault of the people at TripCase? Hey,

90
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,840
God bless him.
You know what?

91
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,180
They could've gone and fucking
work for somebody else, but no,

92
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,900
they all sat together and they sold
their skateboards and they and they,

93
00:06:02,901 --> 00:06:05,780
and they made this company. God dammit,
they're trying to make their money.

94
00:06:05,781 --> 00:06:08,990
What else are they supposed to do? We
don't make anything else in this country.

95
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:14,030
All right? We basically, we plant
and grow weed and we create apps.

96
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:17,450
That's what we do in this country and in
the middle of it we eat a lot of bugles.

97
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:21,830
Okay. This is from what? The people
outside of America. All right.

98
00:06:21,831 --> 00:06:23,960
If you haven't been here.
And other than that,

99
00:06:23,961 --> 00:06:27,830
we make great music and great movies
that you guys all then go and rip off you

100
00:06:27,831 --> 00:06:30,650
bunch of fucking hacks.
Jesus Christ.

101
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:36,040
Has there been any fucking
original programming that
didn't come out of America?

102
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:40,340
I mean, it's absolutely
ridiculous. I mean,

103
00:06:40,341 --> 00:06:45,341
the failed attempt of Ricky Gervais' and
those guys who did the original office,

104
00:06:45,441 --> 00:06:49,880
like they did know that we had
the followup in development.

105
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,390
Come on England,
you're better than that.

106
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,430
You fucking better than that.

107
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,750
You went from an empire to that ripping
off our shows that we haven't put out

108
00:06:59,751 --> 00:07:02,900
yet. But you know we're putting them
out. Fuck you with your cup of tea.

109
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,800
Who's this? Oh, he hit that
new stupid fucking ring.

110
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:14,050
Right? Like I'm on an
island, but I'm not. Oh,

111
00:07:14,051 --> 00:07:16,000
shut up.
How do you get it to stop?

112
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:20,710
I had to download the new fucking
whatever cause my phone stopped working.

113
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:25,710
The latest. Well, it's like the fucking
iPhone. We're fine. It's unbelievable.

114
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:27,000
I stand on a fucking mountain.

115
00:07:27,001 --> 00:07:30,030
I can talk to somebody that
hadn't froze to death yet.

116
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:33,510
Why do I need it to be better?
Why does it have to be made?

117
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,400
I don't want to, I don't want to
update anything else anymore. Okay.

118
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,120
I'm done updating. I'm done with apps.
I'm done with all of this fucking shit.

119
00:07:44,121 --> 00:07:44,721
Like I said,

120
00:07:44,721 --> 00:07:49,721
unless it literally is affecting my
ability to live a healthy fucking life.

121
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:58,140
I don't give a fuck about your APP.
You brushed your teeth.

122
00:07:58,141 --> 00:07:59,700
Have you downloaded our APP?

123
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,690
It'll really show you how to get
in between your teeth. Really,

124
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:08,640
the fucking dentist can't tell me that.
You know what,

125
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:12,780
what, what, what are you supposed to do?
All the factories left back in the day.

126
00:08:12,781 --> 00:08:16,620
You'd be in some auto auto worker place,
making a fucking fan.

127
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:23,250
Jesus. Boop, boop, boop, boop,
boop. Oh, hello, Mr [inaudible],

128
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,960
welcome to your cell phone. All
right, let's just shut this off.

129
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:32,900
You know what I like about it?
And it's actually weirdly upbeat,

130
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:35,210
which I think goes along with my fucking,
you know,

131
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:39,630
balances out my country behavior.
Um,

132
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:42,290
speaking of the dentist,

133
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:48,660
I went to the dentist this week Boto
Dodo do it and I sat in the chair,

134
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:51,330
but the blue boop, boop,
boop mother fucker. Gabe.

135
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:57,270
Um, I laid down in the chair, whatever,

136
00:08:57,271 --> 00:09:01,080
shut the fuck a chair and I got
what's known as a deep cleaning,

137
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:06,180
you know, like six months ago or
whenever July was. What's that?

138
00:09:06,181 --> 00:09:09,540
Eight come on egg heads.
How do you look at the calendar?

139
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,380
I'm sure it's in some beautiful
mind way. [inaudible] 72 days. Like,

140
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:20,040
um, actually it wouldn't be, that's
over a year. Three or 64 days in a year.

141
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:24,300
Really. All right. Anyways. Um,

142
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:25,830
okay.

143
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:29,150
Yeah. So I was supposed to get this,
I don't know. I got my teeth cleaned,

144
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,590
I don't know about a year ago this time.

145
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,270
And then I went back to the
dentist over the fucking

146
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:39,270
don't, when are you putting
your fucking boat in the water?

147
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:44,180
Come over there with a pack
of fucking cause light toad.

148
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:49,620
Scrape it off the fucking bod I coast.
Um,

149
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,720
and I guess I'm on my last
trip to fucking the dentist.

150
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,330
Okay.

151
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,290
To fucking the dentist.
Um,

152
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:04,240
I agreed to get this deep cleaning,

153
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:10,090
Ron Jeremy Stars in deep clean it. I, um,

154
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:13,960
I agreed to have this fucking
thing done and uh, you know,

155
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:18,100
I don't listen to people.
All right. I don't, I look,

156
00:10:18,101 --> 00:10:22,810
I'm sort of looking at you and I'm
nodding. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sounds good.

157
00:10:22,811 --> 00:10:25,480
Sounds good. Just stop talking.
Leave me. I want to get out of here.

158
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,560
So I come back in July and rather
than the lady who cleans my teeth,

159
00:10:33,611 --> 00:10:36,910
there's some dude sitting there with
this smock on and he goes, all right,

160
00:10:36,911 --> 00:10:40,780
do you want us to numb you up a,
we've got a numb you up is what he said.

161
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:43,330
And I went, Whoa, whoa. What
are we? I thought it was just,
he had to get a cleaning.

162
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,950
We get pulling teeth out. He goes, no.

163
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:50,380
You said last time that you wanted
to come in for a deep cleaning.

164
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:53,770
Right. And I was just like, all right,
well look, how long is this going to take?

165
00:10:53,771 --> 00:10:56,980
You said like 90 minutes. I'm like,
I don't have time for that shit.

166
00:10:56,981 --> 00:10:59,530
I thought this was going to be like 45.
I said, I didn't say shit, but I said,

167
00:10:59,531 --> 00:11:02,980
listen, I, you know, I
have other stuff to do.

168
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:06,340
I have drums to play.
I might go play hockey,

169
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:10,240
I might go fly a kite because
I am a 45 year old child.

170
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:15,490
I have things that I have to
get to. So they go out, right.

171
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,790
Whoa, cool man. We know we're
not trying to hassle you man.

172
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:24,030
Just reschedule. And I said,
you got it, you got it,

173
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:26,770
doctor smoky smoke and I'll see you later.

174
00:11:26,771 --> 00:11:31,771
That tootsie lady and I walked out and
I've been trying to get back to do it and

175
00:11:34,691 --> 00:11:37,120
I just, you know, I traveled all
over the place. I got married.

176
00:11:37,121 --> 00:11:39,310
All this fucking shit happens.
So now,

177
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:43,360
now I finally go in for the thing.

178
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,650
I go when I say, all right,
let's do this. So I go, okay,

179
00:11:47,651 --> 00:11:51,340
so you've got to know me up. And
he said, well, it's option. I go,

180
00:11:51,341 --> 00:11:54,910
what do you mean it's optional? Well,
some people know they get numbed up,

181
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:56,501
other people don't.

182
00:11:56,501 --> 00:11:59,620
I'm taking basically a drill he thing and
I'm going in between your teeth and it

183
00:11:59,621 --> 00:12:03,970
can kind of irritate your gums and blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah. And I said, well,

184
00:12:03,971 --> 00:12:08,860
do I need to get numbed up? And he said,
well, personally I don't do it. So I say,

185
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:13,720
I will fuck it. Let's, let's see how it
feels. Let's see how it feels. Right.

186
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:17,680
So I gotta tell you this,
unless you have like, you know,

187
00:12:17,681 --> 00:12:19,880
your teeth are sensitive to cold.

188
00:12:19,881 --> 00:12:23,010
Do you have like a little bit
of a nerve involvement? Um,

189
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:26,680
I'll give you a pass on that, but people
get numbed up for that. You know what?

190
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:30,550
I'm going to try and to talk shit here,
but cheer a bunch of pussies.

191
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,630
Was it irritating?
Yes.

192
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:38,470
Was it something I would
like to be feeling every day,

193
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,480
every moment of the waking day now,

194
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:46,010
but was a screaming bloody murder and
not at all. It was fine, you know,

195
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:49,570
it was great when I walked out.
I didn't, my face wasn't Numb,

196
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:52,023
you know?

197
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:58,510
I like that bill Cosby bit. I would
cry. Ain't getting habit. Can Be, Hey,

198
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:02,800
I saw bill Cosby this week. I saw him,
he was walking right down the street.

199
00:13:02,801 --> 00:13:07,420
Now I saw him a out in that,
the Pasadena Civic Center play House,

200
00:13:07,421 --> 00:13:10,090
whatever they called it.
And uh, it was unbelievable.

201
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:15,400
The lovely Nia took me there for
Valentine's Day. Took me out. Um,

202
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:16,781
first of all,

203
00:13:16,781 --> 00:13:21,781
that's the first time I've been out on
Valentine's Day in years because knee is

204
00:13:22,241 --> 00:13:25,690
cool as shit. And I just
said, listen to stupid.

205
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,360
It's just stupid to go out on this night.
You guys know the steel.

206
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:33,070
Maybe there's somebody knew
somebody from OCI. Uh, not, oh,

207
00:13:33,071 --> 00:13:37,180
she come thinking about who scored
all the goals there. What the fuck?

208
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,430
Ah,
Christ they can't Sochi

209
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:44,180
somebody in Sochi. Right? Hey,

210
00:13:44,181 --> 00:13:48,350
how about a fucking round of
applause for Bob Costas? You know,

211
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:50,660
toughen it out.
Jesus Christ,

212
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:56,570
putting the glasses on every day that,
that, that infection got worse in his eye.

213
00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:00,050
Then it jumped to his other ride.
They just kept pulling the camera back,

214
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:04,640
started up with a, they had like a fucking
three quarter shot by the end of it.

215
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,150
He was like on the other side of the
studio, they will pull back so far.

216
00:14:08,151 --> 00:14:11,450
And finally just said, I was
literally by the last night I saw him,

217
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:16,160
I was just like, dude, he should just go
home. Just fucking get it. Say Fuck it.

218
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:19,520
You know, I've, I what, you're not
going to call me for the next Olympics.

219
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:23,240
Matt Lauer is going to come in here and
kill it so hard that you're not going to

220
00:14:23,241 --> 00:14:27,980
hire Bob fucking costus.
I've been around since the Aba.

221
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:33,320
Go Fuck Yourself. I'll see you guys in
two years. And then he finally left.

222
00:14:33,321 --> 00:14:36,650
I think he left good for him, good
for him, but he toughed it out, man.

223
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,220
He toughed it out. So anyways, um,

224
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:45,110
so I'm on my way to a over to Pasadena,

225
00:14:45,111 --> 00:14:48,860
which is where a doctor Cosby show.

226
00:14:48,861 --> 00:14:52,730
My respect to you was
performing and a dude,

227
00:14:52,731 --> 00:14:54,580
I got a suit and tie on everything.
It's,

228
00:14:54,581 --> 00:14:58,160
it's obvious because it's Valentine's
Day, three reasons, Valentine's Day,

229
00:14:58,161 --> 00:15:01,550
I'm seeing, you know, out of respect
for Nia. And then also, you know,

230
00:15:01,551 --> 00:15:06,260
I'm seeing Cosby. And then lastly, I buy
these fucking suits and I never wear,

231
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:10,880
I wear them once, put a gun to my head
and I do five minutes on a talk show.

232
00:15:10,881 --> 00:15:13,830
Hope I don't fall off the stage,
you know,

233
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:17,030
which is the only way anybody's going to
see you're set on a fucking talk show.

234
00:15:17,031 --> 00:15:20,480
Now if you do stand up,
if you kill nobody sees it.

235
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:23,720
If you fall off the stage,
you get dick falls out of your pants,

236
00:15:23,721 --> 00:15:26,390
it's going to get 100 million
hits. So anyways, I have all these,

237
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:31,380
these suits from my
numerous TV appearances. Um,

238
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:38,460
and uh, I'm like, I got to
wear these motherfuckers.

239
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,300
So I was driving over there and uh,

240
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:46,490
I could not believe the
traffic and I can't believe,

241
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:52,220
oh, I don't believe, I don't believe the
couples put themselves through that shit.

242
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:56,840
Why would you do that? Don't
do that to yourselves. Okay.

243
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:59,630
There's a couple of fire and I know
you got what you guys are saying.

244
00:15:59,631 --> 00:16:01,760
You only bill, you fucking say
this every week, but fuck you.

245
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:06,290
I saw the traffic out there.
Obviously nobody's listening to me.

246
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,513
What you guys can,

247
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:10,910
I'll tell it this way because you
guys already know this shit can,

248
00:16:10,911 --> 00:16:12,290
can you tell other people?

249
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:13,830
Okay,

250
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:17,640
I would, you know if I can
accomplish anything in my life.

251
00:16:17,641 --> 00:16:21,570
If I could just sabotage
that fucking holiday,

252
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:26,720
this guy to be like,
I was just going to say the anti holidays,

253
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:30,380
Valentine's Day, then that becomes
a fucking crowded mess. Okay.

254
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:35,410
There's a number of gatherings that you
do not have to participate in and you

255
00:16:35,811 --> 00:16:40,811
can immediately without making a dollar
more an hour increase the quality of

256
00:16:42,441 --> 00:16:46,250
your life. All right? You don't
need to go to super bowl parties.

257
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,150
I already told you how to get
through that. Now Valentine's Day,

258
00:16:50,151 --> 00:16:52,730
you don't have to fucking go out
already told you how to do that.

259
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:57,710
Saint Patrick's Day.
Stupid fucking stupid.

260
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:02,940
Go out on the 16th going out on
the 16th I know you think of,

261
00:17:02,941 --> 00:17:03,900
what about the 18th well,

262
00:17:03,901 --> 00:17:07,440
everybody's yakked in the bar and no
matter how much chlorhexidine the use,

263
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,780
you still smelling that stomach acid.
Okay,

264
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:14,550
sorry ladies who are listening to this.
You go out on the 16th all right.

265
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,940
Unless the 16th is a Friday
night cause then they,

266
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,190
everybody's going to be
drinking all weekend. Whatever
you do. If that's the case,

267
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:24,420
go out on the Wednesday. As
you know, I was fucking dumb.

268
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,810
They don't even have Saint
Patrick's day in Ireland.

269
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,780
They don't even know who the guy is.
They don't even wear green in Ireland.

270
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:39,180
You think everybody's over
there with an Irish sweater on,

271
00:17:39,181 --> 00:17:42,300
cutting into some soap after they jumped
off a horse to let you know how to wash

272
00:17:42,301 --> 00:17:44,370
your fucking taint.
They're not.

273
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:49,830
They're going to work over there dressed
like coach on cheers and they're going

274
00:17:49,831 --> 00:17:52,410
into their fucking cubicles.
All right.

275
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,830
And they put in their hands and their
keyboards and between their knees they got

276
00:17:55,831 --> 00:17:59,730
themselves a flask. All right. And that's
how you celebrate Saint Patrick's Day.

277
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:04,440
Um, anyway, so I'm on my fucking soapbox
this week. Let me, uh, let me, uh,

278
00:18:04,441 --> 00:18:08,460
I'll read a little bit of
advertising media and uh,

279
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:12,690
and then, then I'll, and I'll keep,
I'll tell you the bill Cosby story. Oh,

280
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:16,350
by the way,
no more a nature's box on this podcast.

281
00:18:16,351 --> 00:18:18,510
Evidently there are a bunch of babies.

282
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,780
They took the little snacks and
they were of course, their babies.

283
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,070
They give out snacks.

284
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:29,690
So I will not be saying the name of
their company anymore from here on out.

285
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,880
They will just be known by their new
nickname, the tree twats. Alright.

286
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:36,800
Literation has nature.

female element. I like it. Um,

[inaudible] B u double r.
All right,

348
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:26,500
well let's talk about the cause.
All right.

349
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:31,930
First thing I get into a, I pull up to
the [inaudible], right? And uh, you know,

350
00:22:31,931 --> 00:22:35,050
it's Valentine's Day. There's a bunch of
fucking animals out there. And I'm like,

351
00:22:35,051 --> 00:22:38,740
I don't want to try to find the parking
garage. I don't know where it is.

352
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:44,080
And then they, I see valet and I
like, oh, valet, fuck it. Fuck it.

353
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:46,750
I'm going to valet a Prius isn't,
you know,

354
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:50,380
a 2008 Prius with a bird shit stain,

355
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:54,580
the likes of which I haven't seen since
owning the car, right on the windshield.

356
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:57,760
I'm pulling up and I'm valet in it. And
right as I pulled up, I started thinking,

357
00:22:57,761 --> 00:23:01,780
well, this is like a 3000 seater.
What if half the crowd does this?

358
00:23:01,781 --> 00:23:06,190
How long am I going to be waiting? And I
was just like, oh fuck it. My feet hurt.

359
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:11,320
I'm valet. So I valet, I
walk into the theater and uh,

360
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:16,360
you know, tickets work. I asked for
an no duels, they don't have any,

361
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:20,560
so I get a fucking water and I
get some wine for my wife, right?

362
00:23:20,561 --> 00:23:22,510
So we go into the theater,
beautiful theatre,

363
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:26,210
lovely theater made in the 1930s.
Right?

364
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:28,360
And we go in there and uh,

365
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,240
first thing I do is look at the stage
and it's the coolest thing ever.

366
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:35,590
It's like there's this little
apartment up there, full bill Cosby.

367
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:40,930
He has like a little four by four rug.
Oriental rug.

368
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:45,500
All right. No offense
to the Orient. And uh,

369
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:50,560
he has a chair and then next duty has a
little like nightstand little table with

370
00:23:50,601 --> 00:23:51,434
this little,

371
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:55,940
I don't know what little cooler
that has all his drinks in it.

372
00:23:56,420 --> 00:24:01,130
And then he has his little headset thing.
It's the coolest thing ever. And I'm,

373
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:02,961
so we're sitting there,

374
00:24:02,961 --> 00:24:07,610
it's supposed to start at eight
o'clock and right at eight on the nose,

375
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:12,950
no opening act, no intro.
He just walks out on stage.

376
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:14,870
I was actually looking down,

377
00:24:14,871 --> 00:24:19,280
I don't know what the hell I was doing
and the only reason I knew he was had

378
00:24:19,281 --> 00:24:21,830
walked out on stage is because
the crowd started cheering.

379
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,370
And of course everybody stood
up and all that type of stuff.

380
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:27,250
And he went over and he put on his little,
uh,

381
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:32,450
his little headset thing that's like
seethrough like John Bonham's vista light

382
00:24:32,451 --> 00:24:34,700
kit. And a, so you don't even notice it.

383
00:24:34,701 --> 00:24:38,240
He puts that thing on and then it's like
he's sitting right next to you and the

384
00:24:38,241 --> 00:24:39,670
guy and literally is,

385
00:24:39,671 --> 00:24:43,580
sits down and kills for
two and a half hours,

386
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:49,280
two and a half hour. He's
76 years old, 77 this year.

387
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,840
Two and a half hours,

388
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:55,280
absolutely destroys his first like bit,

389
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:57,020
took a half hour

390
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:02,450
just talking about Valentine's Day and
how you got all the pressure to get,

391
00:25:02,451 --> 00:25:04,250
you know, uh, you know, the, the,

392
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:09,770
the woman's something and all you get
is a card starts with that premise and

393
00:25:09,771 --> 00:25:12,710
then just goes,
I don't know where he went.

394
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:17,060
30 minutes later he
brings it back to that,

395
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,610
to a thunderous applause break.

396
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:25,030
And I looked over at my wife and I
go, that's his first joke, half hour.

397
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:29,750
So he did two and a half hours. So I
guess that's like what he did. Five jokes.

398
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:32,230
Okay.

399
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:36,550
It was, uh, it was amazing.
And, uh, what I, I don't know,

400
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:40,780
I never seen him live like, just do a
full set and get to sit in the crowd.

401
00:25:40,781 --> 00:25:43,810
And it was um,
an unbelievable honor.

402
00:25:43,811 --> 00:25:47,500
It was the best Valentine's gift
day gift I've ever gotten and she's,

403
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:52,300
she always gives me something nice
and, but that was the best. And um,

404
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,430
it's definitely a bucket list thing.

405
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:59,850
And just to be able to sit there in the
crowd and watch and do his thing is I've

406
00:26:02,201 --> 00:26:05,650
tried to do what he's done for 22
years to have that perspective,

407
00:26:05,651 --> 00:26:10,600
to have the perspective as a, as
a, as a fan and an audience member.

408
00:26:10,601 --> 00:26:15,550
Like it was working on like five different
levels. It was, it was awesome. And uh,

409
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:17,980
then I walked out and I ran
into like three other comics.

410
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:22,420
They know that I knew and were all
geeking out. He's two and a half hours.

411
00:26:22,421 --> 00:26:23,470
Can you fucking believe that I've done,

412
00:26:23,471 --> 00:26:26,050
I've done two and a half hours
my life guys, 76. It was awesome.

413
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:30,790
And then I walked out there and there
must have been 900 people waiting for

414
00:26:30,791 --> 00:26:31,840
their valid cars.

415
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:40,760
So I just stood there by the
theater with a couple other comics

416
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:45,930
and we just around just giving each
other shit and talking about the business

417
00:26:45,931 --> 00:26:48,720
and all that. And then just kept going
back to how amazing bill Cosby was.

418
00:26:48,721 --> 00:26:52,080
So if you get a chance, it's
really cool. He's also, you know,

419
00:26:52,081 --> 00:26:55,050
he just put out that special, so he's,
he's working on some new material.

420
00:26:55,051 --> 00:26:59,940
So I got to see that. I got to see bill
Cosby workshopping material and you know,

421
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:01,251
you know,

422
00:27:01,251 --> 00:27:06,251
and you see which ones that are already
monster bits and then you see the other

423
00:27:06,451 --> 00:27:10,330
ones that are on their way. It was, I
got the hiccups now. It was, it was,

424
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:13,800
it was amazing. So, um, you know,

425
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:18,870
definitely if there's very few masters
out there that you can go watch them live,

426
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:23,130
creating live, I highly
recommend going out and, and uh,

427
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:27,480
and seeing a bill Cosby manor was awesome.
It was awesome.

428
00:27:27,481 --> 00:27:31,800
And I got to wear a suit, you
know, so it was a fucking two for,

429
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:37,290
um, all right. Oh, this is something
I have to mention. Hey everybody,

430
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:41,450
do you like buying shit off my website?
Well, I got some new stuff. Um,

431
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:42,960
I did a uh,

432
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:48,270
a tour at the end of last year
right before my European tour. Um,

433
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:53,520
oh I did that. Run a dates where I
played the beacon in New York City.

434
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:57,480
I played constitution hall in DC and
then I played tower theater three

435
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:01,260
absolutely legendary venues. I still
can't believe I got to perform there.

436
00:28:01,261 --> 00:28:04,770
So as always thank you to
everybody who came out. Um,

437
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:10,020
I have a limited amount of posters
leftover from that tour and they will be

438
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:14,460
going on sale I believe. Like on Wednesday
of this week, there's like 300 left.

439
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:18,030
Um,
it's first come first serve.

440
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:21,510
The posters are 20 inches
tall and 16 inches wide.

441
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:26,780
They will arrive in a shipping tube and
reading on this stuff and you know what

442
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:28,071
I am and,

443
00:28:28,071 --> 00:28:32,400
and in the effort to get these things
out of my house and to give you guys more

444
00:28:32,401 --> 00:28:35,040
incentive,
I autographed each one of them.

445
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:39,480
I sat at my kitchen table
and painstakingly autographed

446
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:46,350
300 posters.
It must've taken me at least 17 minutes.

447
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:51,660
My wrist is still sore. I live a very
difficult life as an artist, whatever.

448
00:28:51,661 --> 00:28:54,850
I have posters, autographed posters. If
you want them, they make a great gift,

449
00:28:54,851 --> 00:28:58,770
that 20 bucks plus shipping, it's
going to be autographed. You know?

450
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,440
And if you go to give it to
somebody and they don't like it,

451
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:04,410
you got the empty tube to smash
over their head when you're done.

452
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:07,050
And then you pick up the poster
and you get it framed yourself,

453
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:09,210
not because you like me,

454
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:13,410
just because it will always remind you
of hitting that person over the head.

455
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,390
You know you, you know
what's great about the, the,

456
00:29:16,391 --> 00:29:19,290
the poster tube is you get the release,

457
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:24,291
like you fucking smashed
a bat over somebody's head
without having to get rid of

458
00:29:24,601 --> 00:29:28,050
a body afterwards cause it's
just cardboard. You know,

459
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:33,840
if I ran a prison, I would allow
everybody to have a poster tube.

460
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,540
It'd be like enough with the
shanks people. All right.

461
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:39,060
Just hit each other with cardboard.
If you break it, don't worry.

462
00:29:39,061 --> 00:29:42,970
We'll make some more down the office.
All everybody relax.

463
00:29:42,971 --> 00:29:47,920
We'll get you some pot cookies,
you know, get you some porno.

464
00:29:47,921 --> 00:29:49,960
Everybody can rub one out
at the beginning of the day.

465
00:29:49,961 --> 00:29:54,340
That way nobody gets raped in
the showers. Okay. This, this is,

466
00:29:54,341 --> 00:29:58,090
this is a new kind of prison.
All right?

467
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:03,330
She's everybody just fucking
relax. All right. Lucky you might,

468
00:30:03,331 --> 00:30:04,450
you're not getting out.

469
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:08,500
So I don't know why you want to sit here
fighting with each other and we all get

470
00:30:08,501 --> 00:30:13,370
together and we will write some
songs now. Eh, well, you know, it's,

471
00:30:13,371 --> 00:30:18,070
it's, it's, it's a it up. It's what we'll
work on it. Enjoy your, enjoy your tubes.

472
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:23,980
They took it too far with the Sif. I did.
Um, anyways. All right, let's, let's get,

473
00:30:23,981 --> 00:30:28,480
let's get on with the, uh, the podcast
here. So, um, I've been watching,

474
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:31,720
I've been missing all the Olympic hockey
because it's coming on at four 30 in

475
00:30:31,721 --> 00:30:33,670
the morning and because
I haven't been drinking,

476
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:38,500
I've been falling asleep like
the middle aged man that I have.

477
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,410
Like I'm falling asleep every
night, like nine 30, 10 o'clock.

478
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:46,920
And I wake up at like six in the morning
where I could at least watch the third

479
00:30:47,711 --> 00:30:50,470
period I guess,
or the end of the third period.

480
00:30:50,471 --> 00:30:54,970
But it never dawns on me cause
they just woke up, you know,

481
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,980
this is what I have to do
before I get out of bed. Um,

482
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:04,300
and if you feed a fucked up, um,
you know, I fucked up my foot too.

483
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:07,270
I got that planner, Fisher writers
and my bass drum for trying to get,

484
00:31:07,271 --> 00:31:09,670
trying to play good times,
bad times. My technique.

485
00:31:09,671 --> 00:31:12,340
I had poor technique
and I don't know how to,

486
00:31:12,341 --> 00:31:13,930
does anybody know how to Rehab that?

487
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:18,670
Cause every time I run or do anything
that exerts pushing off with that foot,

488
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:21,670
it comes right back. But I'm
able to kind of, you know,

489
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:24,850
roll a tennis ball letter
and my foot and I'm fine.

490
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:28,600
But like when I get up in the morning,
if I don't want to have problems,

491
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:33,700
this is what I do. All right. I wake up,

492
00:31:33,701 --> 00:31:37,630
I look at the ceiling. All right. I
look over my wife and I'm like, good.

493
00:31:37,631 --> 00:31:42,520
She didn't leave me. All right, the
dog hears me stirring in immediately.

494
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,900
I hear her, I hear her stretching
because she makes, she makes this noise.

495
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:51,720
She goes, then she stretches
again. And then I hear her,

496
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:56,500
her dog licenses shaking as she fucking
shakes her head for whatever God damn

497
00:31:56,501 --> 00:31:58,540
reason.
Um,

498
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:03,850
and all of that happens is I'm looking
at the ceiling and before I take step

499
00:32:03,851 --> 00:32:05,650
number one,
if you have a fucked up your,

500
00:32:05,651 --> 00:32:09,780
your whatever that is there
underneath your foot, that tendon,

501
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:12,340
if you ever fucked it up,
what really fucks you over?

502
00:32:12,341 --> 00:32:15,340
It's that first step in the morning.
All right.

503
00:32:15,341 --> 00:32:18,370
I learned this from another
comedian who was a world champion.

504
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,600
And this is basically what you
do before you get out of it.

505
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:22,443
This is what I have to do.

506
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:26,410
And I've never played organized
sports and this is just, and I,

507
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:30,380
and I stretch and I still, you get
to a certain fucking age. Like I,

508
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:35,020
I literally throw out my back sleeping.
I wake up like what did I do?

509
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:39,160
Was a lifting shit. What sleepwalking? Um,

510
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:44,690
I basically,
I point my toes at my knees.

511
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,630
He tried to do that paint
point toes towards your knees.

512
00:32:47,631 --> 00:32:52,100
I'm doing it right now and you'll
hold it there for a good 10 22nd cow,

513
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,820
right? One Mississippi, two Mississippi,

514
00:32:55,821 --> 00:32:58,190
but you say it in your head so you
don't wake up your significant other.

515
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:03,670
Then you point your toes down at the
the end of the bed for another 10 20

516
00:33:04,761 --> 00:33:08,110
seconds. He'd do that right
now. You stretched the bottom,

517
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:08,871
you fought and you stretch.

518
00:33:08,871 --> 00:33:12,920
It tends on the top of your foot and
then clockwise or counterclockwise.

519
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,920
I know a lot of young people like
Jesus Christ. What the fuck? Well,

520
00:33:15,921 --> 00:33:19,490
I got news for you. This day is
coming in your life. All right?

521
00:33:19,491 --> 00:33:22,070
It's called your late thirties
early forties all right.

522
00:33:22,071 --> 00:33:24,830
Then what you do is then you have your
bring your feet to normal position,

523
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:28,460
standard side by side,
like those fucking jerk offs at guard.

524
00:33:28,461 --> 00:33:29,690
That thing over there in London,

525
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:33,050
and then you either go clockwise or
counterclockwise. You just make big,

526
00:33:33,051 --> 00:33:37,640
slow circles and then you go
the other way a couple of times.

527
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:42,410
Then I get out of bed and I gingerly walk,

528
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,580
no pun intended.

529
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:48,730
I know I'm a red head and I eye twinkle
toe my way over to the bathroom and I

530
00:33:48,891 --> 00:33:50,910
just make noise on that.
Jesus Christ.

531
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:54,490
I curse and stuff as I'm
walking over there. Okay.

532
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:59,820
Yeah, and then that's it. Then that's
it and then I have to go through the,

533
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:02,040
the beginning I got a stretch.

534
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:07,470
This is just so I can walk my dog down
the fucking street and not be in traction.

535
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:09,720
I'll just pathetic.

536
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:14,080
It really makes me sad
that I used to wake up.

537
00:34:14,081 --> 00:34:15,870
I remember as a little
kid you just woke up,

538
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:20,560
you woke up and one of the
other siblings or was like, Hey,

539
00:34:20,561 --> 00:34:22,540
you want to go outside and
fucking believe it. Yeah,

540
00:34:22,541 --> 00:34:25,330
you just jumped out of bed
and just ran down the stairs.

541
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:31,030
Waffles. That fucking scenario. You
just shoved the shit you need to.

542
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:35,740
You just ran out the fucking door.
You never stretched ever.

543
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:40,300
You never throw out your back. You're
jumping over shit, fucking play,

544
00:34:40,301 --> 00:34:43,000
fight and get in a real fight.
You are fine.

545
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:46,120
You are brand new right
off the assembly line.

546
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:51,040
Brand fucking new. Then after
a while, I don't give a shit.

547
00:34:51,041 --> 00:34:53,470
No matter how much
fucking juices you drink,

548
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:56,380
I don't know what happens to the
attendance. They just fucking,

549
00:34:56,381 --> 00:35:00,940
they shrink up after awhile. Um, all
right. I don't mean to depress you guys.

550
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:05,050
Um, you know, my latest obsession
is when it comes to cars,

551
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:08,330
like learning, learning about
cars and that type of shit is a,

552
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:10,690
I am absolutely fascinated
with differentials.

553
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:15,040
I didn't know there was oil in there
all these years. The owner cars.

554
00:35:15,041 --> 00:35:18,730
I didn't know that the oil was in
there and they each got to change it.

555
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:21,370
When should you change it?
Every 30 to 50,000 miles.

556
00:35:21,371 --> 00:35:23,140
I'm dying to fucking change it.

557
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:25,450
I'm dying to take that
fucking thing off the back.

558
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:29,200
I've watched enough youtube
videos to know how to do it.

559
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:32,810
I'm changing the oil.
It's easy. You just gotta.

560
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,650
You just gotta get one of those Torque
wrenches and know what you're supposed to

561
00:35:35,651 --> 00:35:39,300
fucking put the screws back. Two pounds
per square, whatever the fuck it is.

562
00:35:39,301 --> 00:35:42,000
Or is that air? I Dunno. Fuck
you. I can figure it out.

563
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:46,350
But you know what sucks on my truck,
the 68 f 100,

564
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:47,653
um,

565
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:53,360
that backing plate that usually
faces the back of the car on mine.

566
00:35:53,521 --> 00:35:57,210
It's on, it faces the engine.
It's on the other side.

567
00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:01,410
So the drive shaft is there.
What? That other fucking
thing. And then there's that.

568
00:36:01,411 --> 00:36:05,610
So I would have to take off
all of that and drain it out.

569
00:36:05,611 --> 00:36:09,450
And I know what you guys would think
and bill for the love of fucking God.

570
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:15,570
Don't do that to yourself as much as
you probably get a funny bit out of it.

571
00:36:15,571 --> 00:36:19,230
Please do not do, I didn't know the
other people who just love people,

572
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,950
the fried and shorts or have you the
fuck you say it. They'll be like, yeah,

573
00:36:22,951 --> 00:36:24,690
we'll give that a whirl.
See how that happens?

574
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:29,010
That's a fucking scary thing
to do because that's not,

575
00:36:29,011 --> 00:36:33,540
that's not a an injury you can walk
away from. In other words you don't,

576
00:36:33,541 --> 00:36:38,541
it's weird at that point is if is if I
did all that and I couldn't get that shit

577
00:36:38,941 --> 00:36:39,511
back together,

578
00:36:39,511 --> 00:36:43,710
I could still start my truck up and I
could go through all the gears and all of

579
00:36:43,711 --> 00:36:44,544
that shit. Well, grant,

580
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:46,860
I've against the transmission
fluid would be Lincoln leaking out.

581
00:36:46,861 --> 00:36:51,240
If I took off to fucking, what if I
took off the, uh, what's that called?

582
00:36:51,241 --> 00:36:54,390
The drive shaft. If I took that
fucking thing, I'm going to do it.

583
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:57,990
Fuck you up. Tried it. I just,

584
00:36:57,991 --> 00:37:00,960
I'm just fascinated with the fact that
I don't think it's ever been changed in

585
00:37:00,961 --> 00:37:04,020
that there's air in there from,

586
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:09,330
it was put together in March according to
the, the, uh, the number inside the door.

587
00:37:09,331 --> 00:37:13,530
It was put together in Ontario.
Believe it or not,

588
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:16,590
Ford had an Ontario plant or
something like that. And uh,

589
00:37:16,591 --> 00:37:21,591
in March of 1968 and somebody close that
fucker up and that air has been trapped

590
00:37:21,841 --> 00:37:23,730
in there.
And I think it's high time I released it.

591
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:26,580
I guess it's an ungodly fucking smell.

592
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:31,590
But I posted this video before,
um,

593
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:35,850
for people like me who don't know shit
about cars and are just starting to learn,

594
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:37,050
um,

595
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:42,050
it's a very intimidating part of the car
and to actually see the genius of how

596
00:37:42,241 --> 00:37:43,140
it fucking works,

597
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,230
I'm going to post that video again
because I absolutely love it and I'll

598
00:37:46,231 --> 00:37:51,090
actually show this guy from a
bleeping jeep, um, youtube, uh,

599
00:37:51,091 --> 00:37:53,940
or is it bleeping
jeep.com he gets in there,

600
00:37:53,941 --> 00:37:56,540
he changes the oil and he does some
other shit in there. And then, then,

601
00:37:56,670 --> 00:38:00,060
then on youtube there'll be a bunch
of other fucking youtube videos.

602
00:38:00,061 --> 00:38:05,040
We can actually look at all the fucking
gears in there despite it gives the

603
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:08,310
pinion gears all that shit.
You know,

604
00:38:08,311 --> 00:38:10,670
I watched this guy take an
axle off and all that type of,

605
00:38:10,671 --> 00:38:14,150
with the little fucking c clamp,
whatever the fuck it is. I,

606
00:38:14,151 --> 00:38:18,990
it was fascinating shit.
The balls to go in that deep.

607
00:38:18,991 --> 00:38:23,040
That's what I, I just have to
respect it. And speaking of respect,

608
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:26,050
even though I missed all the Games, I
watched the highlights. I just saw the,

609
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:30,000
the third period in the shootout
of the, uh, USA Russia game.

610
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:33,730
How about that fucking Tj. Oh, oh,

611
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:35,980
she, she, Tj,

612
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,550
TJ. Oh, she

613
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:41,860
was just basically that
are fucking shootout guy.

614
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:46,230
We just kept sending him and he
delivered every time. Jonathan quick. I,

615
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,530
you know what I loved about him
scoring that over is how it went.

616
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:50,230
The second he scored the,
uh,

617
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:53,680
the shootout goal that
had us beat the Russians,

618
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:56,980
he immediately turned around and he
pointed at Johnathan quick, you know,

619
00:38:57,130 --> 00:39:00,520
something somebody else could have done
when they tip the pass to a linebacker

620
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:03,640
about a month ago. You know, you
can do that every once in a while.

621
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:08,200
It's nice to see somebody do
that. Um, and Phil Kessel fill,

622
00:39:08,201 --> 00:39:11,530
Castle's been crushing it, the former
Brooklyn and now Toronto Maple Leaf,

623
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:13,900
who I will be seeing.

624
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:18,290
I will be going to a maple leaf
game and I also be going to a,

625
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:22,240
a Canadians Bruins game
when I'm up there and I can,

626
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:23,500
I can't fucking believe it.

627
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:28,000
I'm going to see two original six home
games and one against another original

628
00:39:28,001 --> 00:39:31,930
six and the best fucking rivalry as
far as I'm concerned, over the years,

629
00:39:31,931 --> 00:39:33,120
you've got to say that,
you know,

630
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:36,940
not discounting any of the year
great Detroit rivalries and so on,

631
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:38,880
that shit out west.
Um,

632
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,670
or even the islanders and
rangers or flyers and penguins.

633
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:46,630
He's just a fucking great
leak. Um, anyways, so that,

634
00:39:46,631 --> 00:39:47,950
that tour is coming up quick.

635
00:39:47,951 --> 00:39:51,940
I have a week's worth of dates back
here for like four days and then I'm in

636
00:39:51,941 --> 00:39:56,350
Canada,
man and I have not drank for 20 days.

637
00:39:56,351 --> 00:40:00,370
By the time you hear this,
21 days and I got to tell you something.

638
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:05,400
I am fucking miserable. I'm not
miserable. But I, I miss him,

639
00:40:05,401 --> 00:40:10,300
man. I really fucking miss it. I'm
not gonna lie. I don't need it.

640
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:13,900
I don't need it. I mean, what,
what do you really need? You know,

641
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:19,480
did I need to, to buy another pair of
socks? I have other socks, you know,

642
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:24,780
I miss,
I should've never broken up with it.

643
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,510
I'll live with this regret for the
rest of my life. No, I'm basically,

644
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,710
me and Versie are not drinking
until we get to Canada.

645
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:36,850
Once we get to Canada. It's hilarious
right now. I was talking to him, I said,

646
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:39,840
listen, Paul, all right,
both haven't drank in awhile.

647
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:43,910
I've been going easy on the stoves and um,

648
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:45,880
you know,

649
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:50,880
it would be a shame if in those 20 days
we gave back everything that we gained.

650
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:54,940
And he's like, Oh yeah, dude. Yeah, yeah,
no, I, and I, and I say, yes. Listen,

651
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:57,400
I'm not saying I'm not going to drink.

652
00:40:57,910 --> 00:41:01,120
I'm not saying I'm not going to smoke
a couple of Cubans, but let's just,

653
00:41:01,121 --> 00:41:06,040
you know, let's try to, to
manage, you know, let's try it.

654
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,770
Maybe the first two days we don't drink
and then we go to the fucking maple

655
00:41:08,771 --> 00:41:12,400
leaf's game. We'll have a couple of
beers and, and Paulson, the IAA. Yeah.

656
00:41:12,401 --> 00:41:15,520
And then we just start laughing
because we know what's going to happen.

657
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:20,030
We know what is going to happen.
All right.

658
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:23,710
It's going to be a fucking shit show.

659
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:28,800
So all I'm trying to do is drop as much
fucking weight as I possibly can and get

660
00:41:31,181 --> 00:41:36,181
into such great shape because I know
what the fuck I'm going to do itself.

661
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:41,230
It's fucking over. I'm going to do
what every one of you guys would do.

662
00:41:41,231 --> 00:41:45,350
So I'll fucking judge me.
I can't wait. I can't wait.

663
00:41:45,351 --> 00:41:49,460
I wake up every day, you know, I dunno.

664
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,870
Yeah. I feel good, but I
don't, I, I don't know.

665
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:57,860
What am I supposed to do? I have
a porch. How am I not spell?

666
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:02,600
How do you not drink when you have a
porch? It's just a, I got a rocking chair,

667
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:08,570
you know, it was easy to not
drink when I didn't have a pool.

668
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:09,860
I don't know what it
is about the portrait.

669
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:14,720
Just get out there and all of a sudden
I wa I want to fucking, I want a drink.

670
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:23,490
Um, all right. Let me do a little
more advertising. When I come back,

671
00:42:23,491 --> 00:42:26,280
I'm going to talk about my add and I
want to thank everybody who's been trying

672
00:42:26,281 --> 00:42:29,670
to help me with it. Now that I've finally
agreed with my wife that I have it.

673
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:32,760
All right.

um, wait, you're a business owner,

it makes it hard to look

Promo Code Bill. You know
it's funny with those reads,

717
00:45:13,171 --> 00:45:15,150
I was actually thinking through
the first couple. I was like,

718
00:45:15,151 --> 00:45:18,630
I'm doing a great job. And then all
of a sudden that voice in my head,

719
00:45:18,631 --> 00:45:23,460
whenever you're doing fuck it up, and of
course you start fucking it up, TJ. Oh,

720
00:45:23,461 --> 00:45:26,220
she doesn't think that shit.
Phil Kessel doesn't think that shit.

721
00:45:26,221 --> 00:45:29,580
That's why he puts the biscuit
and a basket. All right.

722
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:33,630
So I mentioned I'm add last week that
I've finally given him that I fucking have

723
00:45:33,631 --> 00:45:38,520
it brutally. And um, so people sent me
all these links and as far as I can tell,

724
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:44,340
other than trying harder to focus,
you got to take some drugs, man.

725
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:48,120
Um, and I looked at the list of
drugs, none of which I would ever,

726
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:52,410
ever in a million years entertain
putting myself on, you know,

727
00:45:52,411 --> 00:45:55,680
destroy your brain, beat up your
liver, but oh well you focus,

728
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:59,100
be sitting there totally listening to
every word is like a drool coming out of

729
00:45:59,101 --> 00:46:01,350
my mouth.
I'm one of the things,

730
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:04,620
Ritalin was one of the things
that they suggest to take.

731
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:06,180
Like who's still suggest Ritalin?

732
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:08,180
Okay.

733
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:11,540
I've seen, I've even, I
have seen the stories okay.

734
00:46:11,541 --> 00:46:16,130
With all the sports and bullshit
that I watch. Uh Oh. Speaking of aid,

735
00:46:16,131 --> 00:46:20,180
DD and speaking of shows that I love,
is anybody watching? True detective,

736
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:21,920
please tell me you're watching.

737
00:46:21,921 --> 00:46:24,950
True detective and if you've
seen all four episodes,

738
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:27,680
I'm not going to spoil
anything for anybody. Okay.

739
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:29,870
I just have to wait for that person.
Take that their,

740
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:31,430
their hands away from the ears.

741
00:46:31,431 --> 00:46:35,000
I'm not going to ruin anything
that's dangerous to drive like that.

742
00:46:35,001 --> 00:46:38,090
Stop staring with your knees.
Um,

743
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:41,570
I've seen all four episodes and uh,

744
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:46,030
this past week's episode,
certain people were,

745
00:46:46,031 --> 00:46:50,470
were going on and on about the way it was
shot and I think that they actually in,

746
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:51,320
which was amazing,

747
00:46:51,321 --> 00:46:56,321
but that gem of a conversation
in the bar this week,

748
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:01,260
I absolutely fucking loved it.
I thought I'm,

749
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:06,350
it's very rare that I see a scene with
both characters are arguing and I feel

750
00:47:07,701 --> 00:47:11,870
like they're both 100% right.
They're both 100% right in that seat.

751
00:47:13,070 --> 00:47:17,590
And uh, it's just, Oh my God,
fucking Matthew Mcconaughey,

752
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:22,190
Jesus Christ crushing it.

753
00:47:22,910 --> 00:47:27,290
Everybody is Reggie. And even
that get that prisoner guy,

754
00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:31,450
Reggie, Reggie to do. Did this shit.

755
00:47:31,451 --> 00:47:36,070
Mother fuckers do. I fucking love
that guy. That's my new show.

756
00:47:36,071 --> 00:47:39,440
Everybody considering gas monkey,
they're there.

757
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:41,770
I know they were between seasons.

758
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:46,210
Do you know how depressed I am when I
get through all of the fast and loud?

759
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:50,110
I watch all of them like three times and
then I just have like my favorite ones

760
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:54,880
where they just have certain cars.
Um, what are some of my favorite ones?

761
00:47:54,881 --> 00:47:56,650
I'll tell you I liked the uh,

762
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:01,060
so my favorite cars did
they done was when they um,

763
00:48:02,290 --> 00:48:02,840
yeah,

764
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:04,040
which one was the,

765
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:09,130
I would say the 55 for that
they made for a mark Cuban

766
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,390
that that morning I just absolutely
fine what they did to that car.

767
00:48:15,391 --> 00:48:19,780
Paint it all white. I absolutely
in the, in the interior,

768
00:48:19,850 --> 00:48:22,550
that fucking car and the way it sounds.
Then they did another one.

769
00:48:23,330 --> 00:48:27,790
They did this 1950 rocket 88 where
they do this thing where you know,

770
00:48:27,791 --> 00:48:28,670
it start no Ross,

771
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:32,360
but it's not like debilitating Russ
and they just put a clear coat over it.

772
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:36,980
So you've got this bad ass mean looking
car that you can lean up against an

773
00:48:36,981 --> 00:48:37,551
underneath it.

774
00:48:37,551 --> 00:48:42,470
Everything's fucking brand new and it
sounds like a fucking based as they go

775
00:48:42,471 --> 00:48:44,300
down the road and they
got the white wall tires.

776
00:48:44,301 --> 00:48:47,630
That was another one that I loved.
Um,

777
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:49,170
okay,

778
00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:51,540
what else? I even liked that
crazy station wagon with the,

779
00:48:51,570 --> 00:48:53,070
that opened like a clam shell.

780
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:55,210
Yeah.

781
00:48:55,210 --> 00:48:58,780
There's just been so many. I don't know
my face. And then I'll of course though,

782
00:48:58,781 --> 00:49:00,430
I've already talked about this,
the wine one,

783
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:03,640
Richard tried to sell the car back to the
people for 30 grand and they knew what

784
00:49:03,641 --> 00:49:06,040
the fuck he's brother comes in.

785
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:09,580
His brother wanted 30 grand and he
busted him down to 18 grand and then his

786
00:49:09,581 --> 00:49:11,770
other brother comes back and goes,
he shouldn't have sold the car.

787
00:49:11,771 --> 00:49:15,220
What do you want for it? And Richard was
like, yeah, I was thinking like 30 grand.

788
00:49:15,610 --> 00:49:18,100
And the other guy's like, hey fuck
head. I know what you paid for us.

789
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:21,730
And then Richard just laughed and
then they settled for like 20 grand.

790
00:49:21,731 --> 00:49:23,380
He still made like 1500 bucks.

791
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:31,030
I fucking love that show. I wish
they'd do more motorcycles. Um,

792
00:49:31,450 --> 00:49:33,640
anyways,
plowing ahead.

793
00:49:33,641 --> 00:49:38,110
So my new show now that
breaking bad's over, um,

794
00:49:38,230 --> 00:49:40,540
is that show true detective?
Uh,

795
00:49:40,570 --> 00:49:44,230
get in early so you don't feel
overwhelmed like I am with house of cards.

796
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:48,220
I know I have to start watching that.
Just so many great shows. Shameless.

797
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:50,350
I haven't watched one episode of that.

798
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:54,760
I got a bunch of Shit I have to get
caught up on. But um, true detective,

799
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:59,220
I dunno if it can get better than that
right now man. It's fucking awesome seat.

800
00:49:59,221 --> 00:50:01,200
But add helps me look at this.

801
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:04,180
It helps me on the podcast because I just
think of something I just go off like

802
00:50:04,181 --> 00:50:05,350
basically what I just did there,

803
00:50:05,351 --> 00:50:09,790
I was going to start talking about my
add and all of a sudden I'm talking about

804
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:14,040
a 55 Ford, right? And then I
bring it back around. It just,

805
00:50:14,530 --> 00:50:16,000
it helps on this thing.

806
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:21,300
Have an add is great when you have a
podcast because you never run out of shit

807
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:24,340
to say because everything just
fucking reminds you of something else.

808
00:50:24,341 --> 00:50:29,300
You just keep going. But it my day
to day trying to get shit done.

809
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:31,633
MMM.

810
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:34,080
And also trying to
listen to somebody else.

811
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:38,670
Like everything that they say reminds me,

812
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:45,130
I just reminds me of shit other stuff
and I just start thinking of that and I

813
00:50:45,131 --> 00:50:48,540
dunno,
I even have add,

814
00:50:48,541 --> 00:50:51,590
I'm just unbelievably self absorbed.

815
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,780
It's probably a little of both that go
fuck yourselves. What do you want from me?

816
00:50:58,390 --> 00:50:59,223
Um,

817
00:50:59,560 --> 00:50:59,900
okay.

818
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:02,240
So anyways, yeah. Oh, don't
forget to get your posters.

819
00:51:02,241 --> 00:51:04,400
I did mention that I'm
scrolling down here and uh,

826
00:51:26,691 --> 00:51:30,290
The the, the reeds for
this week, man. The Dude,

827
00:51:30,291 --> 00:51:31,760
you called it bill,

828
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:36,110
you called it last June on your
parents on Conan O'brien. You told,

829
00:51:36,410 --> 00:51:41,410
you told Conan that Paula Dean would be
back on television because she's $100

830
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,313
million whale.

831
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:47,500
I read today she received a $75 million
investment from a guy who won't sky

832
00:51:48,231 --> 00:51:52,400
mall. She's already in talks with
a mate with major television,

833
00:51:52,401 --> 00:51:56,870
neck television networks for a new
show. Greg, Call Bill Love U podcast.

834
00:51:56,871 --> 00:52:00,020
Keep being you. Yeah, Dude. I mean
that wasn't, I mean that was obvious.

835
00:52:00,021 --> 00:52:04,550
I just predicted that everything that has
happened before we continue happening,

836
00:52:05,350 --> 00:52:08,060
uh, she's back. She's back.

837
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,450
I actually don't have a
problem with Paula Dean.

838
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:15,110
I think it's refreshing that she actually
said, yeah, I've used the n word.

839
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:17,990
You know what I mean?
She was honest.

840
00:52:19,090 --> 00:52:19,520
Yeah.

841
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,520
That's really what she was guilty
up. She, she really could have just,

842
00:52:22,521 --> 00:52:22,881
you know what?

843
00:52:22,881 --> 00:52:25,820
I should really shut the fuck up because
I can't even remember what she did.

844
00:52:26,850 --> 00:52:27,270
Okay.

845
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:31,740
Did it start with she had a slave
themed wedding. Oh, that's right.

846
00:52:33,530 --> 00:52:36,920
It's just what the fuck you don't.
She's like,

847
00:52:37,310 --> 00:52:39,980
is anybody watching
the haunted house show?

848
00:52:40,070 --> 00:52:44,360
American horror story me
is watching that this year.

849
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:47,360
And the theme was slavery and I fucking,
I,

850
00:52:47,361 --> 00:52:51,890
I can't sit there and watch that with
Nia because I'm afraid she's going to cut

851
00:52:51,891 --> 00:52:55,520
me by the end of the God damn show.
And you know, was I'm like going,

852
00:52:55,521 --> 00:52:56,720
I wasn't alive then.

853
00:52:57,260 --> 00:52:58,093
MMM.

854
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:04,330
That's what she's like. The uh, Paula
Deen is like, uh, what's her face?

855
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:05,500
The woman from misery.

856
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:11,780
She's like the real life version
of that in that she's not like, uh,

857
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:15,630
some dead living thing. She's actually
alive and she can make cookies.

858
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:20,790
But other than that, I think her
politics are the same. Um, all right.

859
00:53:20,791 --> 00:53:24,660
Female athlete of the year is a horse.

860
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:27,420
What?
Hey Bill,

861
00:53:27,421 --> 00:53:31,860
hearing the story last week about the
Seattle newspaper snubbing the women's

862
00:53:31,861 --> 00:53:35,880
championship reminds me of this
story from a few years back.

863
00:53:35,881 --> 00:53:40,881
The Daily Telegraph naming the Australian
sportswoman of the year and it was a

864
00:53:41,491 --> 00:53:45,330
horse. He's got the link right
here. I'll put this up for you guys.

865
00:53:45,331 --> 00:53:50,040
2012 the year of the London Olympics
were plenty of our female athletes,

866
00:53:50,041 --> 00:53:53,190
one gold and gave great
performances by our athletes.

867
00:53:53,191 --> 00:53:54,390
He means the Australian ones,

868
00:53:55,270 --> 00:53:58,950
they completely blew it off and they
gave it to a horse here. Here's the link.

869
00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:04,310
Also ever thought of adding Tasmania to
your itinerary when touring Australia.

870
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:09,300
It's the small island state below
the mainland. If you don't know.

871
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:14,220
Got that welcoming.
We don't get much down here,

872
00:54:14,221 --> 00:54:18,480
so let's make it a good one. Kind of
feel. Uh, last time you were in US steel,

873
00:54:18,481 --> 00:54:21,930
you mentioned how it's sucked driving
so far to get to different places.

874
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:27,000
None of that here can cross the state
and about five hours and take in whatever

875
00:54:27,001 --> 00:54:30,390
you want in between.
Yeah, if you fly, right.

876
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:34,410
Uh Oh, that's me. Oh, in
Tasmania. I got it. Okay.

877
00:54:34,770 --> 00:54:38,340
Got Some Nice old theaters and
the best beers in the country.

878
00:54:38,341 --> 00:54:43,320
Not only will you have a blast,
I'll save $600 flying over to see you.

879
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:45,660
A win and a win through.
Fuck that. I'll go there.

880
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:48,570
They got some old ass theater,

881
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:51,990
Jesus Christ telling
me that's not haunted.

882
00:54:52,830 --> 00:54:55,710
How many indigenous people is
that fucking built on top of?

883
00:54:56,580 --> 00:54:59,670
Is it made out of Didgeridoo is um,
sorry,

884
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:01,560
sorry for the Hacky
fucking Australian humor.

885
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:05,680
I haven't been there enough to give you
anything original. I'll be there. Um,

886
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:07,980
although I was upset that, that, that uh,

887
00:55:08,010 --> 00:55:13,010
Bruce Springsteen played Perth and his
band played highway to hell as a tribute

888
00:55:13,501 --> 00:55:17,520
to bond Scott because that's where
bond was from and he's buried there.

889
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:22,710
And as cool as that was, as much as I
loved it as an ACDC fan, I was like, fuck,

890
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:24,470
I thought I was going to be the,

891
00:55:24,471 --> 00:55:28,110
the American that goes over there and
let you know that I realized that Bond

892
00:55:28,110 --> 00:55:28,943
Scott is from there.

893
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:33,120
I thought I'd get a little star on my
forehead and Bruce Springsteen went over

894
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:36,600
there and took it fright from me.
All right.

895
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:41,550
I'm done with my temper tantrum.
Dethroning the bankers, dear bill,

896
00:55:42,050 --> 00:55:43,230
um,
I know how much you hate,

897
00:55:43,231 --> 00:55:47,130
but the banker cunts and was wondering
if you ever considered getting into

898
00:55:47,131 --> 00:55:47,964
bitcoin.

899
00:55:48,690 --> 00:55:53,310
The decentralized nature of the currency
creates no need for central banks

900
00:55:53,311 --> 00:55:57,150
controlling everything.
I'd suggest creating a bitcoin wallet.

901
00:55:57,430 --> 00:56:02,250
And playing around with the small amount
of Bitcoin to learn how the system

902
00:56:02,251 --> 00:56:05,250
works. It's the most exciting
thing in technology and finance.

903
00:56:05,251 --> 00:56:08,550
Since the invention of the Internet.
Love the podcast.

904
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:12,090
Thanks and go fuck yourself.
Uh,

905
00:56:12,091 --> 00:56:14,910
and he's nice enough to
take to leave the Wikipedia

906
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:20,460
definition either that are Andrew
feminists. Let me know what this is.

907
00:56:20,690 --> 00:56:24,310
Bitcoin is a peer to peer payment
system and digital currency

908
00:56:24,310 --> 00:56:29,310
introduced as open source software in
2009 by pseudo Nima develop pseudonymous

909
00:56:33,790 --> 00:56:36,730
developer Satoshi Nakamoto.

910
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:38,070
Okay.

911
00:56:38,070 --> 00:56:38,903
Nakamoto.

912
00:56:39,390 --> 00:56:43,320
Do Japanese people got the best
fucking names that Toshi Naca Balta.

913
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:49,580
It's a fucking killer name. Bill
burr that Toshi Naca. Malta,

914
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:52,830
a motel knock on multiple,

915
00:56:53,370 --> 00:56:56,610
said Doshi Nakamoto.

916
00:56:56,990 --> 00:57:01,970
What would you say that if he
scored a goal, I can't do it.

917
00:57:01,971 --> 00:57:05,150
All right. Let me just continue
here. Add. It's a wonderful thing.

918
00:57:05,690 --> 00:57:07,100
It's crypto currency,

919
00:57:07,101 --> 00:57:11,540
so called because it uses
crypto crypto cryptography,

920
00:57:12,110 --> 00:57:16,880
no Jesus, to control the
creation and transfer of
money. Conventionally, Bitcoin,

921
00:57:16,881 --> 00:57:21,881
capitalize a refers to the
technology and network,

922
00:57:21,981 --> 00:57:25,130
whereas lowercase bitcoins
refers to the currency itself.

923
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:27,560
MMM.

924
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:29,610
Yeah. Well, the,

925
00:57:29,611 --> 00:57:33,310
the big problem with this is
it's created by human beings.

926
00:57:33,730 --> 00:57:35,860
I don't think that bankers
a necessarily evil.

927
00:57:35,861 --> 00:57:38,770
I just think that they have or
more evil than I am. They just,

928
00:57:38,771 --> 00:57:43,771
they're in a position to absolutely
devastate everyone walking the planet.

929
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:48,400
International bankers have that ability.
But I, I really think that the more,

930
00:57:50,290 --> 00:57:51,123
MMM,

931
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:56,980
I dunno, the more I read up on it and
stuff, it's just a bunch of greedy counts.

932
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:00,100
And like somebody saying right now,

933
00:58:00,101 --> 00:58:04,480
the big conspiracy is that they're going
to try to bankrupt all currencies to

934
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:09,481
eliminate all wealth on the planet and
then come back with the new currency and

935
00:58:10,091 --> 00:58:13,000
well, I know that they're not going
to eliminate their own wealth,

936
00:58:14,050 --> 00:58:19,050
so they're going to make everybody on
the planet broke except for them and

937
00:58:19,811 --> 00:58:24,560
they're going to survive. Now.
Maybe they can do it, but I don't,

938
00:58:24,590 --> 00:58:25,940
how do you pull that off?

939
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:31,250
That seems like that would
have a very finite, um,

940
00:58:32,090 --> 00:58:35,360
life before people were just like,
all right,

941
00:58:36,530 --> 00:58:37,610
I don't know about you guys,

942
00:58:37,611 --> 00:58:40,670
but there's like nine people left in
the world that can afford a three piece

943
00:58:40,671 --> 00:58:44,570
suit. And it's not any one of
us 7 billion. What do you say?

944
00:58:44,571 --> 00:58:47,240
We go over there and beat them with
their pocket watches. You know,

945
00:58:47,241 --> 00:58:48,560
it's eventually when that happened,

946
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:51,400
I dunno.
Um,

947
00:58:52,890 --> 00:58:56,880
yeah, I, I would just like to go back to
just open bartering, just trading shit.

948
00:58:56,940 --> 00:59:01,050
Hey, I'll give you this shirt
for that sandwich. I got
plenty of shirts. Fuck you.

949
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:05,400
Don't want hungry again, but look at my
waistline. I look awesome. All right. Um,

950
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:09,280
I'll read up on it, sir. I'll look
up on it. Uh, I look up on it. Oh,

951
00:59:09,290 --> 00:59:11,400
I'll read up on it and I'll look it up.
How about that?

952
00:59:11,401 --> 00:59:13,740
I'll do both of those things. I'll
look it up and then I'll read up on it.

953
00:59:13,770 --> 00:59:17,190
A lot of up going on there. All
right. Donation, currency. Hey bill,

954
00:59:17,191 --> 00:59:20,640
longtime listener loved the show,
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

955
00:59:20,641 --> 00:59:24,110
Let's get right to the point.
Um, the person wrote Blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

956
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:25,550
Before you think I'm being arrogant,

957
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:29,150
let's get right to the point you should
think about adding an another way of

958
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:32,810
donating on your website,
bitcoins. Why is that?

959
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:37,960
You have fans in places so fucking strange
that you don't even know where it is

960
00:59:38,841 --> 00:59:40,790
on the goddamn glove.
Go Fuck Yourself.

961
00:59:40,791 --> 00:59:43,610
I know where most places are in the
globe and I know their capitals,

962
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:47,640
at least I used to. It's in my head
somewhere. They use different currency,

963
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:48,890
which might be a problem.

964
00:59:48,891 --> 00:59:53,840
Bitcoin is providing an easy way to
dismiss a commercial and easy way to

965
00:59:53,841 --> 00:59:58,040
transfer wealth. Use it and welcome
to the 21st century. By the way,

966
00:59:58,041 --> 01:00:02,780
I'm from Poland. It's really cold in here.
It's a second language. All right? Um,

967
01:00:05,270 --> 01:00:07,880
I, I would think that if
whoever starts bitcoin,

968
01:00:07,881 --> 01:00:10,250
if they don't get murdered
in the next calendar year,

969
01:00:10,251 --> 01:00:15,230
then it's just started by the bankers.
Um, or they're just going to buy it up.

970
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:19,490
They'll sell out. Right? I don't know.

971
01:00:19,610 --> 01:00:23,760
I'm not going to fucking start
using a new currency. All right?

972
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:26,470
I saw what happened with the euro.
I'm going to go with bitcoin.

973
01:00:26,510 --> 01:00:31,190
That started by some fucking
hippie Japanese guy, or even worse,

974
01:00:31,191 --> 01:00:35,420
a businessman,
Japanese guy that Jesus Christ.

975
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:40,040
You can't tell me. They're
not still upset by the, uh,

976
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:45,410
the two piece we gave them back in
the forties. Um, adopt or birth.

977
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:50,600
Dear Billy,
read Billy red white beard bur

978
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:56,990
thanks for the laughs and look forward
to seeing you soon in Calgary, Calgary,

979
01:00:57,020 --> 01:01:00,200
KL,
Gorag whole category.

980
01:01:00,650 --> 01:01:02,390
I'll gladly take you out with,

981
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:07,600
with a couple of buddies for some ice
hockey and a couple of nonalcoholic Bros

982
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:11,870
unless you're back on the
wagon. Yeah, let's get shit
faced and play hockey. Dude.

983
01:01:11,871 --> 01:01:13,070
I'll bring in my skates.

984
01:01:13,550 --> 01:01:17,330
You provide a right handed
stick and his ski Parka.

985
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:20,390
I'll play some pond PandaDoc.
Um,

986
01:01:20,391 --> 01:01:24,440
in which case we'll enjoy
some Granville island.

987
01:01:25,460 --> 01:01:29,510
Oh, is that some Bruce? I know. What the
fuck. Yeah, I guess I'm off off the wagon.

988
01:01:29,511 --> 01:01:31,910
Granville island. See,
see what I'm saying?

989
01:01:31,911 --> 01:01:34,230
You see how much weight I'm
going to gain up there? No,

990
01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:38,870
but then if I played pond hockey, he'll
skate it off. Ah, genius. Anyways,

991
01:01:38,871 --> 01:01:42,920
my wife and I are toying with the idea
of either adopting a kid are doing it the

992
01:01:42,921 --> 01:01:46,430
old fashioned way and making a
baby ourselves. She's only 27,

993
01:01:46,431 --> 01:01:49,670
so it's not like she's
incapable of making babies.

994
01:01:49,671 --> 01:01:52,340
But she preferred to adopt
a Korean kid because a,

995
01:01:52,490 --> 01:01:54,350
those orphan kids need home be,

996
01:01:54,351 --> 01:01:58,430
she'd like to skip the crying baby phase
and see that Korean kid will make me

997
01:01:58,431 --> 01:02:03,260
filthy rich one day. Jesus
Christ doing what? Um,

998
01:02:03,290 --> 01:02:05,960
personally I think all
what if it's a female,

999
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:11,020
get it into golf projected they're
destroying female golf right now ladies,

1000
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:15,500
they hitting off the lady teas there.
Personally,

1001
01:02:15,501 --> 01:02:17,690
I think all her reasons are legit,

1002
01:02:17,691 --> 01:02:21,300
but I'm seriously freaked that if
we give birth to a second baby,

1003
01:02:21,301 --> 01:02:25,380
a love that second baby more than my
Korean kid that happened to a friend of

1004
01:02:25,381 --> 01:02:29,280
mine who adopted and then had another
kid and was ashamed of himself that he

1005
01:02:29,281 --> 01:02:32,460
honestly felt more love for the second
one even though he still loved the

1006
01:02:32,461 --> 01:02:35,290
adopted kid. What would you do
here if you were me? Adopter,

1007
01:02:35,310 --> 01:02:38,190
make one yourself a two and
I can't make that decision.

1008
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:43,500
And I think it's natural that you feel
more of a connection to your own kid. But,

1009
01:02:43,501 --> 01:02:47,250
um, I don't think that would affect the
decisions you'd make unless she had some

1010
01:02:47,251 --> 01:02:48,930
Sophie's choice that you had to make.

1011
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:53,550
I think have your buddies
just being really honest. Um,

1012
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:55,141
I dunno.

1013
01:02:55,141 --> 01:02:58,020
I don't think it's a good reason to adopt
a kid gives you think it's gonna make

1014
01:02:58,021 --> 01:03:02,700
you money. Most orphan kids do
need homes. I agree with a B.

1015
01:03:02,730 --> 01:03:05,400
She'd like to skip the crying baby phase.
You know what?

1016
01:03:05,401 --> 01:03:08,340
Both of you guys are a couple of psychos.
You're trying to make money.

1017
01:03:08,341 --> 01:03:09,810
She does it.
I don't think you want a kid

1018
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:15,770
skip this crying baby phase.
That doesn't sound like a mom.

1019
01:03:17,890 --> 01:03:20,550
What about when it can talk
and that's the whiny phase.

1020
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:21,980
Like,
I don't know why

1021
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:24,190
vegetables.
Well fuck

1022
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:29,140
yeah, you're not mine anyways. You
want to go back to the orphanage? Yeah,

1023
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:33,100
possibly to fix your baby teeth.
Right? That's what she's going to do.

1024
01:03:33,490 --> 01:03:35,870
I think both of you guys
should have a kid when you,

1025
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:39,220
you want to have a kid
for the right reason.

1026
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:43,690
Maybe you just trying to be funny. I don't
know what, I don't know. Jesus Christ.

1027
01:03:44,190 --> 01:03:44,610
All right.

1028
01:03:44,610 --> 01:03:49,610
A D d a d d coming to a theater near you.

1029
01:03:50,530 --> 01:03:53,140
Hey Bill, you're a
funny guy. You amuse me,

1030
01:03:53,950 --> 01:03:58,750
but before you go all Peshy,
I thought I'd run something past you.

1031
01:03:59,620 --> 01:04:00,550
Um,

1032
01:04:02,260 --> 01:04:05,310
does that mean Joe Peshy or you does
that Italian for fish on the north?

1033
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:09,070
That is your recent self diagnosis of add.

1034
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:11,450
It wasn't self-diagnosis.
It was from my,

1035
01:04:11,650 --> 01:04:14,740
my wife I think could be PTSD.

1036
01:04:14,741 --> 01:04:19,330
He said not showing me any sort of
credentials. I'm not an expert. Okay,

1037
01:04:19,331 --> 01:04:20,380
so now I can't sue them,

1038
01:04:20,710 --> 01:04:24,700
but I have a self diagnosis
of myself with this condition.

1039
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:27,070
Isn't the internet wonderful?

1040
01:04:27,850 --> 01:04:30,970
I had an injury to the left side
of the brain when I was young,

1041
01:04:30,971 --> 01:04:35,380
which led to the right brain compensating
and in turn this led to above average

1042
01:04:35,381 --> 01:04:36,430
creative skills.

1043
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:40,600
Hopefully you're just a naturally funny
fucker by suggest reading about this

1044
01:04:40,601 --> 01:04:45,370
condition if you've been looking into that
stuff. Well, I got run over by a jeep.

1045
01:04:45,790 --> 01:04:49,120
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Hey

1046
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:54,870
wait. You had an injury to the left side
of your brain. That's where I got hit.

1047
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:58,980
I was riding on my bicycle.
I was trying to beat my brother home.

1048
01:04:58,981 --> 01:05:01,770
I cross the street without
looking and I got hit by a jeep.

1049
01:05:01,771 --> 01:05:05,280
I was upside down and I got
hit right on the temple.

1050
01:05:06,510 --> 01:05:08,910
So I told you guys about this before,
when you,

1051
01:05:08,911 --> 01:05:12,010
when you bite down on
your Moelis by putting,

1052
01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:14,240
put your hand right in the side of your,

1053
01:05:14,420 --> 01:05:17,100
of your temple as if you're pointing like,
ah,

1054
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:21,910
that's a smart suggestion there
Brian. Yeah, that part of your scope.

1055
01:05:21,911 --> 01:05:24,640
Put it right there and then
bite down on your molars.

1056
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:28,690
You feel that thing that goes in and out.
That's right where I got hit.

1057
01:05:29,020 --> 01:05:30,310
And it happened on a Wednesday.

1058
01:05:30,311 --> 01:05:33,820
I remember that because the doctor said
I didn't have to go to school for the

1059
01:05:33,821 --> 01:05:37,960
rest of the week and I got a
four day weekend, Thursday,
Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

1060
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:41,470
And My fucking jaw hurts them.
It hurts to open the hurt to chew.

1061
01:05:41,620 --> 01:05:46,120
So eight with a little spoon. And I had
raisin bran. I remember all of that.

1062
01:05:47,290 --> 01:05:52,240
Um, I dunno if that's why
I'm, I became what I became.

1063
01:05:52,330 --> 01:05:57,250
I wonder if that's true. I have no idea.
I made people laugh before that. I was,

1064
01:05:57,280 --> 01:06:01,060
I was fucking killing it in
kindergarten. Um, that's interesting.

1065
01:06:01,061 --> 01:06:03,670
I will look that up, sir. PTSD. All right.

1066
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:06,640

podcast for this week, everybody.
