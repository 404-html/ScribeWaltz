1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:02,131
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02,131 --> 00:00:04,950
Is Bill Burns time for the Monday
morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:10,180
July 11th, 2016 what's going on now? Why?

4
00:00:10,181 --> 00:00:11,014
Yeah,

5
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:15,570
I'm recording this 6:01 PM on Sunday.

6
00:00:15,571 --> 00:00:16,410
July 10th.

7
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,700
Still fucking light as hell out even
though it's getting Jackie by the day.

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,600
Um, I'm in a great mood. Uh,

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,530
I think my Sciatica is Phi Psi.

10
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:33,120
I think it finally went away. Um, like 90,

11
00:00:33,121 --> 00:00:35,220
95% of it went away.
Uh,

12
00:00:35,221 --> 00:00:38,580
that Mizzou said I was seeing who
was fucking amazing winter again.

13
00:00:38,581 --> 00:00:41,610
She beat the shit out of me.
Um,

14
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:45,540
and show me this stretch from my
leg. Brie. I just lay on the floor.

15
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:50,040
I put my leg up against the door jam and
it's been working fucking wonders for

16
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:53,970
me. Um, and I really feel like I'm
going to see her again next week.

17
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,450
I just keep doing that stretch.
Do all these other stretches.

18
00:00:57,451 --> 00:00:59,220
She was telling me all of
this shit. I, you know,

19
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:03,690
I need to strengthen my obliques cause
it's putting stress on my lower back,

20
00:01:03,691 --> 00:01:06,090
the whole fucking thing.
My back feels amazing.

21
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,050
And what's so great is my back
has been fucked up for 30 years.

22
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:15,480
You know, I did a podcast this
week, not trying to drop any names,

23
00:01:15,481 --> 00:01:18,900
but stone cold Steve Austin,
the stone cold.

24
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:23,250
And that's the bottom line.
Cause stone cold said. So I
did his podcast. He's like,

25
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,790
well we talked for like
two and a half hours. Um,

26
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:31,850
he's going to turn it into I think
a part one and a part two. And um,

27
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:36,360
I was talking to him on that podcast,
how the first time I threw out my back,

28
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,240
the two times, three times in my
childhood, I throw out my back.

29
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:43,050
Two of the times where's was
doing wrestling moves, right?

30
00:01:43,051 --> 00:01:46,500
One was the figure four leg lock,
which I've told you before,

31
00:01:46,501 --> 00:01:50,520
that's the first time I threw up
my lower back. Right. And then, uh,

32
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:54,870
try to imitate a Gary Valentine. His
kid was trying to show me how to do it.

33
00:01:54,871 --> 00:01:56,750
He did it and everybody went
nuts and he wouldn't fuck it,

34
00:01:56,751 --> 00:01:59,760
let me out of it because all the fourth
graders started flipping out like it was

35
00:01:59,761 --> 00:02:02,040
the WWF.
Right.

36
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:05,490
And then when I was like in seventh or
eighth grade or maybe the beginning of

37
00:02:05,491 --> 00:02:10,350
high school, I, uh, I tried to pick
my little brother up over my head,

38
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,860
like Tony Atlas, his finish
and move. And I swear to God,

39
00:02:13,861 --> 00:02:16,920
like three quarters of the way up
my spine, it felt like it folded.

40
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,720
And I just had it kind of dropped.

41
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:22,050
My brother dropped them
down on the fucking ground.

42
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:26,850
Fortunately there was wall to wall carpet
in cause it was leftover from the 70s

43
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,830
there. Um, but anyways, uh,

44
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:33,151
yeah,

45
00:02:33,151 --> 00:02:36,510
so my back has been fucked and then I
was playing just pickup football and I

46
00:02:36,511 --> 00:02:39,960
fucked up my lower back.
And for the last 30 years,

47
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,730
if I ever fell asleep laying
on my stomach, like a,

48
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:47,940
I woke up in unbelievable pain and had
to literally like just slide down the

49
00:02:47,941 --> 00:02:48,780
side of the bed,

50
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:52,380
get on my back and just start doing
stretches for a half an hour to get it

51
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:55,500
undone. And uh, that has gone away.

52
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,070
And the cyanic things going away. And I
guess I had no fucking idea. I thought,

53
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,440
you know, like I stretch,
you know what I mean?

54
00:03:02,441 --> 00:03:05,320
I get a massage and wants to be couple
of years. I thought I was all right.

55
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:08,920
But I guess all the way down the rights,
I probably shouldn't do this.

56
00:03:08,921 --> 00:03:10,180
If I lose my health insurance,

57
00:03:10,181 --> 00:03:12,850
they'll just have to just splice
together all my podcasts to get all my

58
00:03:12,851 --> 00:03:14,950
preexisting conditions.
Um,

59
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,310
that muscle that runs down your entire
right side of that whole thing was

60
00:03:18,311 --> 00:03:22,360
spasming.
And then like half of it on the left side,

61
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,720
the muscles in my fucking
left thigh and left calf dude,

62
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:33,270
she fucking slammed her elbow into the
back of my fucking leg and was bringing

63
00:03:34,661 --> 00:03:38,440
it up. It literally felt like my
leg was going to fucking explode.

64
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,140
Um, but, uh, but it's, it's actually,
it's been way better in like today.

65
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:48,940
I just, I dunno, it just kinda felt so
everything kind of like freed up and, uh,

66
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,570
I'm just gonna keep going to these people
and I'm going to try to get my back is,

67
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:56,920
I had no idea how fucked up it was. I'm
site and all these people going to do it.

68
00:03:56,921 --> 00:04:00,490
You know, you gotta go get an
just go to a doctor, you know,

69
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:05,170
these chiropractors that there's these
[inaudible] or that just go to a doctor,

70
00:04:05,171 --> 00:04:09,850
get a cortisone shot and fucking get an
operation. And I was like, fuck that.

71
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:15,220
The last place she ever want to get an
operation on as your fucking back. Um,

72
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:19,960
as far as I've seen, like you remember
when they were operating on Bobby,

73
00:04:19,961 --> 00:04:23,440
yours knees and they just was scooping
shit out. Next thing you know,

74
00:04:23,441 --> 00:04:28,180
he was like bone to bone at like
27 years old. Um, I feel like,

75
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:30,880
you know, as far as they've come
with knee surgery, back surgery,

76
00:04:30,881 --> 00:04:34,720
they're still in those Bobby your
years and I just don't want to risk it.

77
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,830
I would never do that.

78
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:40,860
So I'm happy that I was able to do it
in a noninvasive way and it's literally

79
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:47,680
affected my mood and like a positive way.
So I'm so psyched about that. But, um,

80
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:51,290
as I mentioned before,
um,

81
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:55,990
Stone Cold Steve Austin's podcast, he's
got a podcast, and I could not believe,

82
00:04:55,991 --> 00:04:57,590
I don't want to ruin anything
that we talked to her,

83
00:04:57,591 --> 00:05:02,140
but I could not believe
the similarities of, uh,

84
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,340
wrestling to stand up as far
as listening to the crowd.

85
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:07,540
You know,

86
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:12,540
not getting them all the
way to high before you're
going to get off and building

87
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:16,870
up your time. Like that's a big
thing when you're, you're like a,

88
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,690
a comedian starting out,

89
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:22,180
like you're doing 10 minutes sets and
then one night somebody tells you to do 15

90
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:25,360
and x extra five minutes.
Doesn't sound like a lot,

91
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:30,630
but that's like you coming up
with another 50% more of your act.

92
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:35,290
You know, there's a math workout.
All right? In that, I mean,

93
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:38,170
the five minutes is a lot of fucking time.
And he was the same thing he would do.

94
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,090
He would wrestle for like
eight fucking minutes.

95
00:05:40,091 --> 00:05:43,330
And then one day he moves up and they
go, all right, give us 20 minutes.

96
00:05:43,331 --> 00:05:46,180
He's thinking, what the fuck am I going
to? Am I going to do this for 20 minutes?

97
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:51,370
Um, but of course, you know, we don't
get the shit kicked out of us, but, um,

98
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:55,810
I will definitely a retweet when
that thing is going to be on.

99
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:59,900
I had a great time with him and he in the,
in the best way possible.

100
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:02,780
He is exactly like when you see him,

101
00:06:02,781 --> 00:06:06,020
he's just completely no
bullshit and all that. And uh,

102
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:09,950
he wants to learn how to fly a helicopter.
So we talked about that.

103
00:06:09,951 --> 00:06:12,470
We just went on and on and on
and fucking on it. We just,

104
00:06:12,471 --> 00:06:16,330
it was just fucking awesome.
A great guy and uh,

105
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:19,790
definitely was beyond cool that
I got to meet that guy. So I'll,

106
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:24,410
I'll definitely tweet that when
that shit is coming out. So anyways,

107
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:29,930
let's get on with my, uh, my
sports weekend here. I, um,

108
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,650
I had a crazy weekend.
I Saturday night say,

109
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:38,000
uh, I went, um,

110
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:42,790
by watch the UFC first of all and um,

111
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,520
you know, I'm not going to blame
the UFC for that one. You know,

112
00:06:46,521 --> 00:06:50,930
they kept hyping UFC 200 and that was
supposed to be fucking unbelievable and

113
00:06:50,931 --> 00:06:53,840
all their great susposed to come back.
And then what happened? You know,

114
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,420
God and my grandmother,

115
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:58,940
they had that big issue where he fucking
loses and then he doesn't want to do

116
00:06:58,941 --> 00:07:02,750
some sort of Promo. I don't pay attention
to the soap opera, the shit, right?

117
00:07:02,751 --> 00:07:06,290
Ronda Rousey's still not fighting and you
know that they felt that those two are

118
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:08,900
going to be on that card. So
they're above, both are on the car.

119
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:13,580
And then some guy named Joe something
or rather tested positive for some shit.

120
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:14,751
So you know,

121
00:07:14,751 --> 00:07:19,640
there was scrambling for
bodies and I'm fucking is,

122
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,120
oh my God. Am I going to say his name
is an Anderson Silva? Is that his name?

123
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:27,620
How can you fucking watch somebody so
many fucking times? It just, I just know,

124
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:31,430
I never know the names. I just
fucking sit down and I'm like, oh,

125
00:07:31,431 --> 00:07:33,290
that's the guy who
crawls in like a spider.

126
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:36,290
He's going to kick the
fuck out of this guy. Um,

127
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,153
he, uh, you know,

128
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,830
he was supposed to be sitting in the
crowd and neck three and three days later

129
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,270
he's in the octagon. It was like
the whole Vinnie test of Verde Shit.

130
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:49,270
We're back in the day, you know,
Vinny tested where he's like,

131
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,960
he was sitting on his couch watching
the game or he's like in the backyard,

132
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:54,101
you know,

133
00:07:54,101 --> 00:07:58,390
putting together a fucking horseshoe
pit or some stuff and all of a sudden he

134
00:07:58,391 --> 00:08:01,240
sees under send a plane for
the jets. Yeah. Anderson Silva,

135
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,500
he had to come in and um,

136
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:04,780
yeah,

137
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:07,930
fight Daniel Cormier,
Cormier and I, you know,

138
00:08:07,931 --> 00:08:11,920
as much as a fucking douchey UFC
fans were born, um, you know,

139
00:08:11,921 --> 00:08:14,640
cause they wanted to stand up against him.
Anderson Silva,

140
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:19,600
it's like what the greatest of all time
and had nothing to fucking lose in this

141
00:08:19,601 --> 00:08:24,460
guy earned this title shot that got
taken away from him or whatever the fuck

142
00:08:24,461 --> 00:08:26,980
this big fucking payday.
And if he loses to this guy,

143
00:08:26,981 --> 00:08:29,920
then all of a sudden Anderson's coming
back and he's the next contender in this

144
00:08:29,921 --> 00:08:33,550
guy's ass. The fuck out. Right.
So he did what he had to do.

145
00:08:33,551 --> 00:08:35,980
We just kept taking on the ground.
He stayed on top of them.

146
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:40,330
You could hear him and his after he won
going, hey listen, I did what I had to do.

147
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:43,420
You know, you could tell he felt
bad. He wanted to put on a show,

148
00:08:43,421 --> 00:08:46,420
but the guy fucking prepared for months
and months for this other fucking guy

149
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:51,690
saw the fight of the night
for me obviously I think
in everybody else was the,

150
00:08:51,941 --> 00:08:56,100
uh, was the um, mission to Tate. Uh,

151
00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:00,330
Amanda Nunez. I'm saying all these
fucking names, right? And uh,

152
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:03,960
Jesus Christ. I mean that, I mean, that's
of course what everybody wants to see.

153
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,480
It's like when people watch racing,
you know,

154
00:09:06,481 --> 00:09:08,430
as much as they want to see wheel
the wheel, they want to see.

155
00:09:08,431 --> 00:09:12,150
So see somebody go careening into the
fucking wall. We want to see a car,

156
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:15,300
you know, hit a wall at 200 miles an hour.
That's what the fuck they want to see.

157
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,840
And fight fans want to see somebody
get knocked the fuck out. Right.

158
00:09:18,841 --> 00:09:20,130
I'll get the shit kicked out of him.

159
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,700
So I feel like the one thing
that other than the first fight,

160
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:28,730
whether it was at six foot seven guy,
lot of dad bods for UFC,

161
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:30,960
you know,
200,

162
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,750
did I say 50 earlier on a fuckup talking
about a lot of dad bods that was like

163
00:09:36,751 --> 00:09:41,520
the dad bod fight card.
Um, granted all of them,

164
00:09:41,521 --> 00:09:45,030
I obviously could kick the fuck out
of a hundred normal people at a time,

165
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:49,380
but that first fight there
was like dead six foot six,

166
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:52,500
six foot seven dude,
which is hilarious to me.

167
00:09:52,501 --> 00:09:55,830
You're six foot seven and you gotta
learn mixed martial arts. It's like,

168
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:59,490
it's not enough. You can step on the
average person like a fucking man.

169
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:00,590
You're now going to add,

170
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:05,460
add this whole other level of
fucking craziness, you know?

171
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:09,870
Um, that first guy, Jesus
Christ, that first guy,

172
00:10:09,871 --> 00:10:11,280
whatever the fuck his name is,

173
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:15,360
that guy looked like he was in the Bourne
identity and he was like the head bad

174
00:10:15,361 --> 00:10:19,470
guy that you had to beat.
He just came fucking walking
in. He gave that tall dude,

175
00:10:19,471 --> 00:10:22,800
the old right there, Fred,
and he was fucking done. Um,

176
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:26,990
and the only two guys who were in shape
with those, those, I don't fucking,

177
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:30,290
I mean I don't know anybody's fucking
name. I have no fucking idea. You know,

178
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,900
this is my deal. I ordered it. I tech any
was anybody else go to tech store. Right.

179
00:10:33,901 --> 00:10:37,920
And you accidentally ordered
it in Spanish. Like the way
the text thing came out,

180
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:42,830
it says order UFC and then it says,
uh,

181
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,850
no sports event.

182
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,210
And then right after
event was the number one,

183
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,240
and then after done the next
line it said UFC 200 number two,

184
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:57,240
and then the next line said
Espaniol or something like that.

185
00:10:57,241 --> 00:10:58,110
So you didn't read that,

186
00:10:58,111 --> 00:11:01,590
you just saw events and
then you immediately went
to the second line and you

187
00:11:01,591 --> 00:11:06,540
supposed to press one for English
two was for UFC 200 in espanol.

188
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,520
And I fucked the whole thing
up. So I hadn't, you know,

189
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:11,070
I had to talk to the fucking
lady to get it, you know,

190
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,290
the whole fucking thing taken off.

191
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:18,291
But I'll let a lot of dad bods a lot of
fucking dad bods until you got to the

192
00:11:18,841 --> 00:11:19,680
women they came in,

193
00:11:19,681 --> 00:11:22,620
they were like w and other than that
featherweight fight that I can't fucking

194
00:11:22,621 --> 00:11:24,270
remember.
Um,

195
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:29,340
but I just hate when fucking when it goes
to the ground, everybody fucking boots.

196
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,710
You know what I mean?
It's like this kid,

197
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:34,470
you have a little respect for
the person who's on their back,

198
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:38,310
taken forearms to their fucking head.
You Boeing,

199
00:11:38,311 --> 00:11:42,310
because they're not standing up.
I Dunno.

200
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:45,160
People start chanting,
stand them up,

201
00:11:45,161 --> 00:11:48,090
stand them or whatever the
fuck they was saying. Um,

202
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,593
I dunno.

203
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:55,840
To me it's a lot scarier to have somebody
on top of you and you can't fucking

204
00:11:56,751 --> 00:12:00,500
move and they're just raining down on
you and they're putting a glove over your

205
00:12:00,501 --> 00:12:02,690
fucking nose and mouth
and you can't breathe.

206
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:07,340
Like I'd be on the guy fucking kitten.

207
00:12:07,341 --> 00:12:11,330
All claustrophobic.
I would tap out so fucking fast.

208
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:13,221
Do you remember that?

209
00:12:13,221 --> 00:12:16,910
We remember that UFC fight with that guy
just backed up the whole fucking time.

210
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:19,940
The whole fight. He just fucking
backed up. That would be me.

211
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:24,380
And then you'd get me on the ground.
I'd be like, Woo Ellie, just tap out.

212
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:29,390
I would have to, I, I would say I have
to leave the country after the fight,

213
00:12:29,391 --> 00:12:34,370
but UFC is worldwide. I would have to
like move to mainland China, you know,

214
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,170
not Hong Kong to try to somehow,

215
00:12:36,171 --> 00:12:39,050
and even then somebody gets
some sort of bootleg shit,

216
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:42,620
whoever is the son of that dude who sat
and stood in front of the tank, you know,

217
00:12:42,621 --> 00:12:46,940
he'd have the fucking balls to get the
UFC feed and then he fights, you know,

218
00:12:46,941 --> 00:12:51,941
walking around with my fucking okay God
damn Whitehead just walking around in

219
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:56,070
fucking China. They spot me in a
second. Hey, you're that fucking guy.

220
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,170
And had screaming bitch from
UFC fucking whatever. Right.

221
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,810
So I don't know.

222
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,380
I think those fucking people that go
to the UFC got you got a lot of fucking

223
00:13:07,381 --> 00:13:11,940
balls bu in a professional fighter.
Every time I watched the UFC it,

224
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,220
I always,
I always had some point,

225
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:18,210
probably about 15 times during the night
have to say these are like some of the

226
00:13:18,211 --> 00:13:22,130
toughest people on the fucking planet.
Just like the,

227
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:25,810
I can't imagine the mental place you
have to go to when you're walking down

228
00:13:25,811 --> 00:13:29,700
there. No one you're going
to fight somebody, especially
as the fucking underdog,

229
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:30,953
right?

230
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,730
That it's just been training for three
months with like some of the best people

231
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:38,240
in the world. And their skill is
how to beat the fuck out of you.

232
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,870
Like they broke down your
style and they're just going
to figure out how to beat

233
00:13:41,871 --> 00:13:43,550
the fuck out of you.
It's like nauseated.

234
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,540
How do you even get your raisin brand
down there that morning? I mean,

235
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:50,780
these people, they're on a
whole other level. So, um,

236
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:54,410
congratulations to amend Amanda Nunez,

237
00:13:54,411 --> 00:13:59,060
the first female Brazilian
UFC champion and, uh,

238
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:03,330
you know, I, I was loving me just
to take, you know, always class act.

239
00:14:03,331 --> 00:14:06,920
He's fucking gorgeous. You know, it was
hard watching her get busted up like that,

240
00:14:06,921 --> 00:14:10,950
that fucking, that upper cut
that was perfectly timed. Ugh,

241
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,260
Jesus Christ. Um, but anyways,

242
00:14:15,261 --> 00:14:17,720
so I did that and then a buddy
of mine texted me and he said,

243
00:14:17,721 --> 00:14:19,580
why don't you come down
to the fucking troubadour?

244
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,110
There's some band playing down there.

245
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:25,130
And I hope I get the name of this band
right. Cause I went down and saw a band,

246
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:31,070
I think they were called Earth
lists. Yeah. Earth lists.

247
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:35,780
Okay. And I'm still processing
what the fuck I saw.

248
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:40,340
I went down there, I watched like three
seconds of a youtube clip and I'm like,

249
00:14:40,341 --> 00:14:41,960
I gotta get out of the fucking house.
Right.

250
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:46,760
So I went down and that my
buddy started drinking waters.

251
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:50,870
It was really good that night. Right. And
this band comes out, power trio, right?

252
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:56,240
To guy in a strat, there's a fucking
bass player and a drummer and that's it.

253
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:59,810
And the guitar was starts playing
immediately. You're like, wow,

254
00:14:59,811 --> 00:15:01,070
this guy can fucking play.

255
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:05,840
And then the drum start coming in and
then the base and then they just went into

256
00:15:05,841 --> 00:15:07,490
this epic fucking like,

257
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:12,050
just imagine if you were
playing an arena show, right?

258
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,820
And you just,
you're in,

259
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:17,450
you're bringing home the
greatest arena rock show ever.

260
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,180
Like where your energy would be in
the final minute before you said,

261
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,690
right. Bragen row. Right.

262
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:32,050
They basically started there and
stayed there for a half a fucking hour.

263
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:39,640
We're as far as I could tell once there
was like four or five songs that we're

264
00:15:39,641 --> 00:15:43,900
all one giant song dude. It
was, it was fucking exhausting.

265
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:48,250
Just watching it and I
remember about 12 minutes in

266
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,090
when they were ended.

267
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,320
One part of it that you don't like
the cliched endings to things.

268
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:58,800
They would like add 15 minutes
each at see it was fucking unreal.

269
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:02,940
I just looked at the guy I was with and
we just started laughing like this is

270
00:16:02,941 --> 00:16:07,260
fucking nuts. 20 minutes in I got
to go up to the bar and get a drink.

271
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:09,690
The fucking band is poor and sweat.

272
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:13,960
They look like they're in a fucking sauna
and they're still going and the guy on

273
00:16:13,961 --> 00:16:17,970
the guitar is fucking shred and
out of nowhere you're like, wait,

274
00:16:17,971 --> 00:16:20,760
what the fuck song is that? What does
that feel like? A couple of bars,

275
00:16:20,761 --> 00:16:23,250
they played that fucking
part of dazed and confused,

276
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:26,790
Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo
Doo Doo Doo Doo and the fucking guitar

277
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:29,400
player, the drama that we're all doing
and then he like, hey, that's daisy,

278
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,410
daisy and fuse.
It goes right by it.

279
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,440
Then they were into something else and
then finally after a fucking half hour it

280
00:16:37,231 --> 00:16:40,350
ends right.
It's fucking,

281
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:43,470
it's and people are like,

282
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:48,270
people are exhausted from
just watching it and uh,

283
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:51,450
I couldn't hear what he said cause I had
my own earplugs in because I'm an old

284
00:16:51,451 --> 00:16:52,284
man.

285
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:57,480
I eat psychedelic something
was the name of the song,

286
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,730
psychedelic infinity,
psychedelic fucking a scrabble.

287
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,620
I have no fucking idea what he said.

288
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,630
And then they went into another song
that was like five minutes long and then

289
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:12,360
they closed with communication breakdown,
I guess it was like three,

290
00:17:12,361 --> 00:17:16,710
four bands and they just played it like
a quick like hour 45 minutes set and it

291
00:17:16,711 --> 00:17:21,260
was over and it was a,
I like,

292
00:17:21,261 --> 00:17:24,890
it took me till like halfway through
today to like process what the fuck I saw.

293
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,560
I don't know how you would ever
put together something like that,

294
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:31,910
the complexity of the whole thing.
But it was definitely worth it.

295
00:17:31,911 --> 00:17:34,280
And I heard all of their shows
are different every time,

296
00:17:34,281 --> 00:17:37,880
but I was completely blown away by him.
The band is called Earth lists.

297
00:17:37,881 --> 00:17:42,290
If you get a chance to see them.
Um, I guess, uh, here is Wikipedia.

298
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:46,070
They're on a San Diego,
California, Isaiah Mitchell.

299
00:17:46,071 --> 00:17:50,380
Is there a,
is there a guitarist?

300
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:55,750
I hope I sailed the names correctly.
God knows, I always fuck it up. Uh,

301
00:17:55,810 --> 00:18:00,760
Mike [inaudible], e g, I n t o n
was the bass player and then Mario,

302
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:02,650
Mario,
I'm never going to try with the last name.

303
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,600
Rubella Kaba who I guess is also
some fucking psycho skateboarder,

304
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:14,140
uh, meet up the band and they were,
they were absolutely fucking amazing.

305
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:15,563
MMM.

306
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:19,180
If you get a chance,
he had definitely, uh,

307
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:22,120
definitely check them out formally
a professional skateboarder.

308
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:27,760
So, you know what I instantly love about
that guy. He's never had a real job.

309
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:31,450
And I mean that with all respect.
When I first started doing comedy,

310
00:18:31,451 --> 00:18:35,710
I used to work with the guy who used
to have his first job. Was he a,

311
00:18:35,711 --> 00:18:39,550
he was a professional roller skater.
He was about 10,

312
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:44,200
15 years older than me. So
like he was like 18, early
seventies Assam Shit. Right.

313
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:45,970
And that's when like,
you know,

314
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,300
the rollerskating and that type of
shit was at its height and there was

315
00:18:49,301 --> 00:18:53,830
magazines about it and I didn't believe
him until he told me how he fucked up

316
00:18:53,831 --> 00:18:57,310
his elbow, what the maneuver, and he
knew the name and all of that shit.

317
00:18:57,311 --> 00:18:59,140
And then he played drums in a band.

318
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:00,730
Yeah.

319
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:04,300
And then he became a standup comic and
I was thinking like, dude, yeah, you,

320
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:07,320
he's like, yeah man. He goes, I never
had a real fucking job. I that I,

321
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:11,470
that stuck with me.
I think about that every once in a while,

322
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:14,140
just like you want in life.

323
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:17,800
Like I don't care if you never made
any fucking like real money doing that.

324
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:22,270
As long as you, you can pay your
rent and you can eat, you know,

325
00:19:22,271 --> 00:19:25,240
you're not fucking homeless. If those
were the three jobs you had in life,

326
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,171
I swear to God,

327
00:19:26,171 --> 00:19:29,770
if there's an afterlife and God's looking
at your resumes and like, all right,

328
00:19:29,771 --> 00:19:34,090
professional roller, skater,
professional drummer,

329
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:39,550
professional comedians, nothing
else. Lee was fucking guy. All right,

330
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:44,410
it's gone up, buddy. I'm looking forward
to popping in this VHS tape of your life.

331
00:19:44,411 --> 00:19:47,820
See what's going on
here. Right. Um, anyway,

332
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:50,050
so let's do a little bit of
advertising here for the week.

333
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:50,993
MMM.

334
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,940
All right. Let's see if some reeds
here. A Indo Chino Indochino.

335
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:01,920
I. N. D. O. C. H. I. N. O. I have
no idea to say that. Indochino for,

336
00:20:01,921 --> 00:20:05,580
that's what I'm saying.
It talk about how a manmade,

337
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:11,070
how about a made to measure suit field
fits and feels compared to a generic off

338
00:20:11,071 --> 00:20:14,790
the rack suit.
You want me to talk about that?

339
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:19,791
Why don't you fucking write something
for me to say Indochino is reinventing

340
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:23,550
men's fashion. Well, I would
imagine if it's off the rack,

341
00:20:23,551 --> 00:20:27,330
you got to be the exact same
fucking size. Is that suit? If not,

342
00:20:27,331 --> 00:20:29,910
it's going to be tugging a polling
or everybody's going to be laughing,

343
00:20:29,911 --> 00:20:33,690
looking at your ankles as opposed
to a suit that fits. I mean, yeah,

344
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:38,460
I would think that people would know
the difference, you know, I mean,

345
00:20:38,461 --> 00:20:39,720
off the rack you got,
you gotta be,

346
00:20:39,721 --> 00:20:43,470
you gotta be the same build as a mannequin
and nobody has that bill passed the

347
00:20:43,471 --> 00:20:46,790
been like 18 years old. Unless you're
a fucking underwear models. All right?

348
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:49,570
Cause you out and get a
couple of cheeseburgers there
and then it's fucking over.

349
00:20:49,571 --> 00:20:53,290
Your whole torso starts sinking down
to your bull big. All right. Indochina,

350
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:58,291

right? But think about all of that hassle,

441
00:26:08,201 --> 00:26:12,790

453

Ah, righty. Um,

454
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:54,210
all right.
You know what I missed today?

455
00:26:54,211 --> 00:26:58,560
I thought I fucking tape that I missed
a fucking British Grand Prix. But uh,

456
00:26:58,561 --> 00:27:02,730
I ended up watching most
of it on a youtube. Some
French dude put it up or like

457
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:04,640
lady,
um,

458
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:05,610
yeah,

459
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:09,300
and I watched most of it and uh,
congratulations to a Louie,

460
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:13,580
the uh, Lewis Hamilton and
fucking, what's his face?

461
00:27:13,581 --> 00:27:18,080
The Tom Cruise of Formula One.
Nico Rosberg get panelized again.

462
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,800
Fucking penalize them again. They
fucked, they don't like the guy.

463
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,950
Evidently he got too much
information from his pit crew.

464
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:27,260
Some was going on with
his fucking gearbox.

465
00:27:27,261 --> 00:27:30,110
See every couldn't go from six to seven.
He had to go to six to eight.

466
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:33,890
He was saying that, you
know, it caused a dangerous
assumption. Shit. Yeah. He's guy.

467
00:27:33,891 --> 00:27:37,190
Every fucking, every race, every race,
there's some sort of fucking deal.

468
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:38,690
And he's getting penalized.

469
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,960
He came in second but they
bumped up down to fucking third,

470
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:46,400
which is huge because now we only leads
Lewis Hamilton by fucking three. Yeah.

471
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:50,260
Points. I, I'm, I'm actually
taping it tomorrow I'm going
to watch the whole race,

472
00:27:50,261 --> 00:27:52,030
but it was kind of fun
to watch it and French.

473
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:53,543
MMM.

474
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,860
Picking out words.
I Dunno.

475
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:00,900
I got to get like a tutor assumption
maybe then I'll actually start to get a

476
00:28:00,901 --> 00:28:01,920
little better with that ship.

477
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:02,803
But um,

478
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,090
so now let me tell you, I think I
got the standings here somewhere.

479
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:10,650
Where the fuck is it? I got lyrics to Mac
Davis, baby baby, don't get hooked on me.

480
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,920
I started this podcast a couple of times.
I can't remember if I sang that yet.

481
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:15,780
Baby Baby.

482
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:20,800
But don't kid hooked on me cause
I'll just use you and sits you free.

483
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:26,440
I'm all right.
Nico Rosberg has 168 points.

484
00:28:26,441 --> 00:28:30,550
Lewis Hamilton has one 67.
They fucked him out of three points today.

485
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:35,380
You know, he would have been up to
one 71. Okay. Guys. I don't know.

486
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:38,110
He's just constantly getting into,
he's just constantly, I don't know,

487
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:39,760
putting himself in a situation,

488
00:28:39,761 --> 00:28:44,020
I don't know how many fucking
times can one man have problems.

489
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,570
This is the third race of this year,
right?

490
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:49,930
Slammed into fucking his
teammate at the Spanish.

491
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:54,100
You slammed into his teammate at
the fucking Austrian one, right?

492
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:57,520
I think this is, then he got
penalized. Two different, fuck,

493
00:28:57,521 --> 00:29:01,180
this guy's having a hell of a fucking
year. I didn't see the press conference,

494
00:29:01,181 --> 00:29:03,340
but he had the had
fucking tears in his eyes.

495
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:08,110
It was looking like the kill even
Cavaliers fucking coach there. Um,

496
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:11,050
anyway,
so I've been getting my back

497
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,930
taken care of and uh,

498
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,640
the fucking gym out in the garage
has been a Goddamn game changer.

499
00:29:16,641 --> 00:29:19,550
We finally got an elliptical out there,
so that's it.

500
00:29:19,551 --> 00:29:21,200
If I can just stop eating like a lunatic,

501
00:29:21,201 --> 00:29:24,050
I think I can be under one 80 by
the end of this writing season.

502
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:26,860
Speaking of which, we're a recording, uh,

503
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:30,770
we're doing the table read for episode
nine tomorrow. The record on Wednesday,

504
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,640
it's fucking great.

505
00:29:31,641 --> 00:29:35,060
And then we're on 10 and then the
writer's room as far as going there,

506
00:29:35,061 --> 00:29:37,580
every single day is done. But, uh,

507
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,910
we're now looking at the animatics
and I got to tell you guys,

508
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,120
episode one,

509
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,720
episode one,

510
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:49,140
there's a scene in there that we have
been trying to get right for like weeks.

511
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:54,490
So we've all seen it like fucking 20 times
each and they finally animated if the

512
00:29:54,491 --> 00:29:56,650
way we want it to. We finally, we
were able to basically see you.

513
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:59,890
It's all about conveying
your idea to them, you know,

514
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:02,740
and they finally understood what we were
trying to say and we watched it and we

515
00:30:02,741 --> 00:30:06,310
fucking died. I cannot wait
for you guys to see this shit.

516
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:10,120
And uh, oh man. If we get a laugh
like that each fucking show,

517
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:12,220
that's what we got to go for.

518
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:14,830
If we can fucking make you
laugh the way it made us laugh,

519
00:30:14,831 --> 00:30:18,580
where a bunch of jaded assholes so we
can get you laughing like that. Um,

520
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:22,210
I think we can, uh, I dunno.

521
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,890
I think we can keep making some more
of these very excited about it. And uh,

522
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,620
very excited to get out of
the fucking writer's room.

523
00:30:29,621 --> 00:30:33,520
Now I back's feeling great and uh,
I've been hitting the fucking gym,

524
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,630
had um,

525
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:39,970
told you guys want a bottle
that fucking wheat. You know,

526
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:42,100
I put up to 25 once in my life.

527
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:45,430
I weighed about 165 pounds when I
did it and I put it up one time.

528
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:50,240
I always wanted to do it. I was always
just too fucking little to do it. Uh,

529
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:54,430
just my frame. I was never like a
Starkey fucking guy. Like naturally.

530
00:30:54,431 --> 00:30:57,130
I mean anybody eats fucking
pizza and drinks beer,

531
00:30:57,131 --> 00:31:00,490
you're going to look for little husky.
But I'm just saying like naturally, um,

532
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:05,530
I was just more of a middle weight and
I did at one time for the fucking gym

533
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:07,750
rats.
You know that if you put up to 25 you get,

534
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:11,830
you got the two 45 plates on both sides.
So that was like a big fucking deal.

535
00:31:11,831 --> 00:31:16,720
Right? So, uh, today I'm
inching my way back, right?

536
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:20,680
I put up one 75 twice.
I could have done it three times.

537
00:31:20,681 --> 00:31:22,960
If I had somebody there sparked me, they
could have helped me on the fourth one,

538
00:31:22,961 --> 00:31:25,360
which would have been huge
because that's how you build up.

539
00:31:25,361 --> 00:31:29,500
But I've been going really
sick slowly up from, you know,

540
00:31:29,501 --> 00:31:33,220
one 35 just going like 10 pounds at
a time rather than back in the day.

541
00:31:33,221 --> 00:31:38,170
I'd go up 20, it's just been too much.
And what I do is I wait, you know,

542
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:43,590
like gone from one 35 to one 45 and then
up to one 55 and I just make sure I can

543
00:31:44,441 --> 00:31:47,560
do before I tried one 75 I make
sure 20 pounds below it, I can,

544
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:49,540
I can do it like seven,
eight times.

545
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:53,860
And they did one 65 four
times in one 75 two times.

546
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:57,970
So I felt pretty good about that,
which means I could,

547
00:31:57,971 --> 00:32:00,100
I could probably bench my
way at this point. I could,

548
00:32:00,101 --> 00:32:04,840
I could put up one 85 just makes me feel
good. But, uh, and I got the atomic holds.

549
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:07,420
I can now fucking do a
little Ninja Warrior Shit.

550
00:32:07,421 --> 00:32:09,340
I can go from one side of
my garage to the other.

551
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:13,510
It's a bad deal for 48 fucking years old.
Pegboards coming along.

552
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:16,130
I can do like too thick to,
uh,

553
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:21,270
take it out like twice on both sides
before I then fall down to the fucking

554
00:32:21,461 --> 00:32:26,350
ground. But I'm, I'm telling you, if I
wasn't so busy doing this fucking show,

555
00:32:26,351 --> 00:32:27,760
I could actually get in great shape.

556
00:32:27,761 --> 00:32:32,761
I cannot recommend those
atomic holds enough.

557
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:36,550
They are fucking incredible.
And they have all these different kinds.

558
00:32:36,551 --> 00:32:40,940
And just to the grip strength that you
get, the core strength that you get,

559
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:44,900
it's fucking amazing. It's,
this is the free advertising.

560
00:32:44,901 --> 00:32:49,810
Atomic holds a t, O, m I k. Um,

561
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:51,980
and they have a website and they
get all these different things.

562
00:32:51,981 --> 00:32:56,260
If you watch that Ninja Warrior Shit,
American Ninja Warrior, which is on, um,

563
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:01,100
it's on Mondays and Nia has always gone.

564
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:03,740
They should do a celebrity,
one of those fucking things.

565
00:33:03,741 --> 00:33:06,080
You should go try to go on and do
one of those and it's just like,

566
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:09,200
you know that there's
no fucking way I could,

567
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:13,190
I would fuck up that first jump at thing.
But you know something,

568
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:15,650
no matter how great,
let's say I was fucking 30 years younger,

569
00:33:15,651 --> 00:33:20,090
right in the prime of my life,
18 if I fucking trade,

570
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:24,230
no matter how much I trained.
Okay.

571
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,570
Which I don't think I ever had enough.

572
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:30,210
I just don't have the gift to get
into that kind of shape. But the,

573
00:33:30,211 --> 00:33:31,760
let's just say I could at 18,

574
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:37,160
there's no fucking way ever I could
ever make it up that last wall to me,

575
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,500
that's the most,
you know,

576
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:43,820
out of all the crazy shit that
they come up with, you know,

577
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:44,810
is hard as it is.

578
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:49,310
Most of it is just being able to
fucking hang on that shit there.

579
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:52,040
Forget about it.
I would fuck it.

580
00:33:52,041 --> 00:33:56,570
I would do about three steps up and
we'll do the most embarrassing faceplant

581
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:58,250
like I would do a face plant,

582
00:33:58,251 --> 00:34:02,060
but like it would be like I was running
into a wall. I do like one, two,

583
00:34:02,061 --> 00:34:05,930
three steps and I would slip and I would
slam my fucking button nose right into

584
00:34:05,931 --> 00:34:07,850
the fucking wall.
And then that would be the end of me.

585
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:10,820
And it would become a meme.
It would become all of this shit.

586
00:34:10,821 --> 00:34:14,630
I would never fucking live
it down. But, um, but I,

587
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:20,120
the inspiration for my gym was all the
shit that I did in the 80s, you know,

588
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:23,540
when it was all about just doing
your upper body and fuck your legs,

589
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:27,860
walk around the chicken legs,
it was that shit.

590
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:33,500
Little bit of Yoga. And then,
uh, American Ninja Warrior,

591
00:34:33,501 --> 00:34:37,160
just looking at all that shit and just
going on youtube and watching people who

592
00:34:37,161 --> 00:34:41,060
are training for it and these crazy
fucking things that they build in their

593
00:34:41,061 --> 00:34:45,260
backyards. Um, you know,

594
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:46,910
just the strength that they have.
I mean,

595
00:34:46,911 --> 00:34:50,810
I'll never have to be actually do B if
I ever do a muscle up. First of all,

596
00:34:50,811 --> 00:34:54,860
my head's going to go through the
fucking ceiling. Uh, but I, I just,

597
00:34:54,861 --> 00:34:57,830
I just don't have it my age. I
just, you just, there's just,

598
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:01,610
you get to a certain point, you
know, nature's just like, yeah,

599
00:35:01,611 --> 00:35:04,520
we're beginning the dying process.
Okay.

600
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:07,880
At this point you should have had a
couple of kids and they should be handling

601
00:35:07,881 --> 00:35:10,250
the hunting for the tribe and a,

602
00:35:10,251 --> 00:35:14,360
you need to just sit around a fire telling
stories about what you used to do. So,

603
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,730
um,
I am excited though that I am,

604
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:21,780
I'm able to do a once 75 two
this is like such an 80 shit.

605
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,440
Only old people get this stuff because
I'm basically 10 pounds away from being

606
00:35:27,441 --> 00:35:32,090
able to have the 40 fives and then the
20 fives that was all like a big deal.

607
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:36,170
Like you know when people would be doing
pyramids ten eight, six, four, two, right.

608
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,130
It was always like the
fucking guys would come in.

609
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:43,350
They put the 45 played on for 10
then they put the 25 add that right.

610
00:35:43,351 --> 00:35:45,240
One 85 they do eight reps of that.

611
00:35:45,241 --> 00:35:50,241
Then the 35 two oh five and then
the 25 to 25 and then they do,

612
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:54,570
and then everybody would fucking pretend
they weren't looking when anybody went

613
00:35:54,571 --> 00:35:59,571
above two 25 if they threw one
like 25 pound plates again,

614
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:03,960
10 of five pound plates. Nobody gave
a fuck. But if you do the 20 fives on,

615
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:08,940
now you're up to 75 right?
If anybody put the three plates on,

616
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:12,540
that's right when the bar starts to bend,
right?

617
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:17,190
I remember is at the gym one time and I
saw this guy curl to 25 it was fucking

618
00:36:17,191 --> 00:36:21,720
unbelievable. This guy was the
most dense human being I ever saw.

619
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:23,190
And he would like bring it up and just go,

620
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:26,320
ha
ha.

621
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:31,410
It's just like,
what the fuck?

622
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,360
And I wanted to laugh.

623
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,180
I know I've told you guys all those
stories that we tell that guy,

624
00:36:37,181 --> 00:36:41,620
when I used to go to New York sports
club and when I was living on the upper

625
00:36:41,621 --> 00:36:46,270
east side, New York, uh,
near Spanish Harlem, I just
take the fucking train down.

626
00:36:46,271 --> 00:36:50,430
There was one in the 70s I used
to work out there. And, uh,

627
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:55,330
this guy came in one day and he had
to speak in a fucking bay, but bay,

628
00:36:55,331 --> 00:36:58,960
but don't get hooked on me.
He had the fucking Mac Davis haircut.

629
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:04,320
He had a fucking Bandanna on not
doing some fucking a I heart.

630
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:08,890
I heart Huckabees that Royal Tena Bonds,
hipster horse shit. He wasn't doing that.

631
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:13,480
He was like, he was one of these guys
that just dress like how you dressed.

632
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:17,710
Like he stopped looking at fashion
at like fucking 18. He came in,

633
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:23,500
he had fucking like the glasses slash
shades all in one with a headband,

634
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:28,450
the curly fucking hair, like a tank
top. He had Larry Bird shorts on,

635
00:37:28,451 --> 00:37:31,780
his socks pulled up. He looked like
Ken Patera. That's what he looked like.

636
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:37,060
And he would fucking work out dude.
And he would, when he would do a rep,

637
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,073
he'd go,

638
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:41,933
yeah,

639
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,060
yeah.

640
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:47,570
So you'd be in the gym and you just hear
this guy over in the corner and he was

641
00:37:47,571 --> 00:37:49,310
a fucking monster.
He didn't want to laugh.

642
00:37:49,311 --> 00:37:50,640
We just hear this guy
in the corner unquote.

643
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:54,550
Yeah,
yeah.

644
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:57,800
He would bring it down and go, and
then when you push it up with, yeah.

645
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:01,370
And then when he get to the last set,
when he was pushing himself, he'd go,

646
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:07,060
right.
I remember one time

647
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:11,520
he was sitting there, it was me and
some other dude and all I've tried,

648
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,780
I don't even know the other guy,

649
00:38:12,781 --> 00:38:16,410
but I can feel him laughing and all
I'm trying to do is not look at him.

650
00:38:16,411 --> 00:38:19,360
And finally when he did that, she, ah,

651
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:23,670
I fucking looked over at the other guy
and he was curling any, it's, you know,

652
00:38:23,671 --> 00:38:25,040
he brought the curling bar down.

653
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:29,490
He was just holding it and he had his
eyes close with his back to the Ken Patera

654
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:33,720
Guy, so he couldn't see him and he was
just silently like crying, laughing.

655
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:37,690
And I'm you dude, I, I don't, I
think I was doing cardio Asub Shit,

656
00:38:37,691 --> 00:38:42,691
I almost fell off the fucking treadmill
lunatic right out of Boogie nights.

657
00:38:42,941 --> 00:38:47,740
So, um, anyways, I sh, I mean, you know,

658
00:38:47,741 --> 00:38:49,480
at some point I'm going to
post a picture of the gym.

659
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:52,600
I don't like giving up pictures of my
house, but it is just a fucking garage.

660
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,073
MMM.

661
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:59,280
So anyways, I, I, I'm, I'm totally
off the fucking rails here. Where,

662
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,940
what else did I want to talk about?
We talked about the Grand Prix.

663
00:39:01,941 --> 00:39:06,020
We talked Steven Adler, we
talk Amanda Nunez, stone cold.

664
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:11,780
Uh, it too. We're only a month away
from preseason football. Always.

665
00:39:11,781 --> 00:39:13,170
Another thing I saw this weekend.

666
00:39:13,171 --> 00:39:15,350
Do you guys ever watched
that live at Darrel's house?

667
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:19,910
Darrel Hall of Daryl Hall and Oates.
He had Joe Walsh on.

668
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:23,000
What a fucking, every time I
see that guy play, it's like,

669
00:39:23,001 --> 00:39:27,530
why do I always forget what
an unbelievable fucking
guitarist and singer that

670
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:31,670
guy is. He came in and
absolutely just fucking ripped.

671
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:35,840
If you get a chance to watch that
one, I think they're up online. Um,

672
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:40,900
so I'm like VH one and then like this
headbangers ball think came on and a Nia

673
00:39:41,691 --> 00:39:42,890
somehow got into it.

674
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,330
She is promised me at some
point she's going to sing. Um,

675
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:52,820
oh, what the fuck is that?
Saw that Queens rake song.

676
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:55,340
I don't believe in love.
She's been singing that,

677
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:00,450
that in teenage Frankenstein,
she just got into it. She,

678
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:03,380
she loved it and thought it was
silly all at the same fucking time.

679
00:40:03,381 --> 00:40:05,510
So maybe on Thursday she's
a little tired today,

680
00:40:05,511 --> 00:40:08,840
so I'll have her come on and sing some
of that shit for you. But at this point,

681
00:40:08,841 --> 00:40:10,430
let's get to some of the questions here.

682
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:12,163
MMM.

683
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,260
I guess, well maybe before I
do that, just I have to say,

684
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,150
I do have to see something with all the,

685
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:23,200
just the shit that went on in the
over the past fucking week, you know,

686
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:29,290
with those two guys getting killed and
then the five cops get murdered. It just,

687
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,330
I actually believe it or not,

688
00:40:31,331 --> 00:40:35,980
I think something positive is going to
come out of this. I'm really hoping,

689
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:40,240
I just feel like,
I think everybody at this point,

690
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:44,830
no matter what side you're on, if
there's one to one side, two sides of it,

691
00:40:44,831 --> 00:40:47,410
whatever the fuck three sides,
whatever the fuck it is at this point,

692
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:51,070
I think everybody can kind of agree
that whatever the fuck it is we're doing

693
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:55,660
isn't working. And I'm, I'm really, I
don't know. I don't know what it is,

694
00:40:56,890 --> 00:41:01,630
is horrific is all of
that stuff was to watch.

695
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:06,280
I feel like at this point
that you know,

696
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:11,340
everything on both sides was undeniable,

697
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,520
that it was wrong and it
shouldn't have happened.

698
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,950
And I think I just,
I dunno,

699
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:21,750
I was fucking devastating as it was.
I just feel like,

700
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:24,120
I just feel like that was a bottoming out.

701
00:41:24,121 --> 00:41:29,100
I'm really hoping anyways and that it's
going to turn around. I'm hoping, uh,

702
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:31,410
cause I dunno man,
that's this

703
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:35,610
as just one of the fucking
worst, all of that shit.

704
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:39,330
The worst shit I've ever seen in my life.
Somebody just go on for that license.

705
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:44,930
He just, I just kept replaying that, just
wishing the guy said, listen, my license,

706
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:47,970
can you want to reach for it?
Can I get out of the car with my hands up?

707
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:52,500
And you just reach in and get it.
Just sold. That doesn't have to have,

708
00:41:52,501 --> 00:41:56,730
is a fucking kid in the car. It's just
the whole thing was brutal, you know?

709
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:58,460
And then the cops,
Dallas is just down there.

710
00:41:58,461 --> 00:42:00,600
They're just trying to handle the crowd,
make sure nobody gets hurt.

711
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:04,290
And then just, you know, all of them, you
know, I didn't, it was so fucking brutal.

712
00:42:04,291 --> 00:42:08,600
I didn't even look into the backgrounds
of them, but you know, you know,

713
00:42:08,601 --> 00:42:09,411
people were married,

714
00:42:09,411 --> 00:42:12,440
had kids and the dad isn't coming home
and she said the whole fucking thing is

715
00:42:12,441 --> 00:42:14,720
horrible and because it is so horrible,
I,

716
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:18,290
I'm really holding out that something
positive is going to come out of that

717
00:42:18,291 --> 00:42:19,124
cause.
Uh,

718
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:20,840
okay.

719
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:21,673
I Dunno.

720
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:25,280
Cause what else can you think if you
can't get something positive out of that,

721
00:42:25,281 --> 00:42:28,790
that's just too fucking devastating
to even think about. All right,

722
00:42:28,791 --> 00:42:31,070
so let's get to the,
uh,

723
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:36,360
the questions here for this week.
All right, sweet. Hi Mr. Byrd.

724
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:41,280
I don't know if it's the correct way to
address someone you don't know in the U

725
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,100
S. Dot. It's fine. It's fine.
I like the call me Mr. Byrd.

726
00:42:44,101 --> 00:42:48,060
I'm old enough to be a minister here, uh,
in Sweden. I would just call you bill,

727
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:51,030
by the way. I don't want to
Piss you off anyway. I was,

728
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:54,150
I was wondering if you're
coming to Sweden again.

729
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:58,770
I quote discovered you on Youtube a year
ago and I watched you every night while

730
00:42:58,771 --> 00:43:02,130
I put my son to sleep.
Oh, that's great. He said,

731
00:43:02,131 --> 00:43:06,600
and I love laying in bed holding
my mouth so I won't wake my son up.

732
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:08,040
I would love to see you live.

733
00:43:08,041 --> 00:43:12,090
Greetings from Sweden a PSRF
if my spelling mistakes,

734
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:14,130
spelling sucks. Sorry
Dude. You're fucking,

735
00:43:14,131 --> 00:43:16,650
your English is great compared to my shit,

736
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,080
unless you just looked
it all up and typed it.

737
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:23,730
I'm definitely coming back.
I just got to figure out when,

738
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:27,810
uh, my life has changed a little bit
now that I'm doing this show. But, uh,

739
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,120
I think what I'm going to do,

740
00:43:30,121 --> 00:43:33,390
I have this European run that I'm going
to do and then I think I'm going to do

741
00:43:33,391 --> 00:43:38,350
another one possibly march,
April of next year. Uh,

742
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:41,580
but I'm also taping a special, I got to
make sure when I go over there though,

743
00:43:41,581 --> 00:43:44,070
I'm, I'm, I'm bringing
the fucking, you know,

744
00:43:44,071 --> 00:43:45,960
I don't want come over
there with some halfass act.

745
00:43:45,961 --> 00:43:48,810
I'm not flying over the other side of
the world to give you guys a okay show,

746
00:43:48,811 --> 00:43:52,350
but I'm definitely going to come back.
I'd like to go back there and um,

747
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:57,940
well ideally I could go over there right
before my special comes out and knock

748
00:43:57,941 --> 00:44:00,820
that out deck deck. That is
ideally, that's what I could do.

749
00:44:00,821 --> 00:44:03,940
But I'm definitely gonna come back and
maybe do a little bit of eastern Europe.

750
00:44:03,941 --> 00:44:07,960
Some of the countries that I
haven't been to. Uh, we shall see,

751
00:44:07,961 --> 00:44:10,660
but I'm definitely going to come back
like I've done the Sweden, Norway,

752
00:44:10,661 --> 00:44:15,370
Finland run two times already.
And uh,

753
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:18,490
I think I've been to Sweden three times,
so because one time,

754
00:44:18,491 --> 00:44:22,220
but I think I just did sweet.
Then the next time was Sweden. Uh,

755
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:27,390
no way in Finland, but I'll definitely
going to get back. But thank you so much.

756
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:29,440
That's a really fucking,
that's a thrill.

757
00:44:29,441 --> 00:44:32,010
That's someone that far away is
watching stuff. Laughing at my

758
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:36,810
stuff. Thank you very much.
Okay, here we go. Uh, Bill,

759
00:44:36,811 --> 00:44:41,430
I fucked up and could use a
hand. All right. Let's see.

760
00:44:41,431 --> 00:44:46,110
Why did you fuck up? Hey, you
all biscuit big and bitch.

761
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:50,550
Uh, I fucked this one up and could
use some of your broadcasted advice.

762
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:55,940
I'm 26 year old guy living and working
in the great white North Toronto to be

763
00:44:56,131 --> 00:44:59,880
exact and I love your podcast and
all that shit. Thank you. Anyways,

764
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:03,690
few months ago I started seeing this
really sweet girl. She's pretty,

765
00:45:03,691 --> 00:45:08,550
she's thoughtful and she's as low
maintenance as a 1991 Honda civic.

766
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:12,240
Okay. It sounds like the
beginning of a horror movie,

767
00:45:12,241 --> 00:45:14,460
everything's like fucking perfect.
Right? And he literally says,

768
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:17,640
perfect explanation point.
She deserves to be treated right.

769
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:18,740
Okay.

770
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:23,740
About a month ago I was eating at a
restaurant with a buddy when this smoking

771
00:45:23,841 --> 00:45:28,340
hot redhead comes up to me
out of the blue and says, hey,

772
00:45:28,341 --> 00:45:31,730
you're cute. Take my number.
Let's go out sometime.

773
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:36,140
I should have said no.
I have a girlfriend right then and there,

774
00:45:36,141 --> 00:45:40,370
but the excitement of having a babe throw
herself at me was too much for me to

775
00:45:40,371 --> 00:45:45,260
pass up apps. A fucking Lulea
was, that's like a fucking movie.

776
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:50,190
We're not wired to pass that moment up.
I'm not saying you go and do it,

777
00:45:50,191 --> 00:45:51,470
but Jesus,
uh,

778
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:56,430
he said I didn't have the damn strength
to keep it in my pants. Later that night,

779
00:45:56,431 --> 00:45:59,340
after a few wobbly pops,

780
00:45:59,341 --> 00:46:03,990
I texted her looking to meet up.
We did and we did the deed.

781
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:08,130
I felt like a piece of shit. Ah, yes.

782
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:12,750
We've all been there as men. We've all
been there and a lot of ladies too,

783
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:17,970
which never gets any press because it's
considered sexist to suggest that, um,

784
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,030
here's where it's getting
interesting and slightly complicated.

785
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:22,740
Not even 48 hours later,

786
00:46:22,741 --> 00:46:26,670
I'm hanging out with my girlfriend when
she gets a call from one of her friends

787
00:46:26,671 --> 00:46:30,840
saying, I have some bad
news to tell you. Oh boy.

788
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:34,650
I overheard the conversation coming
from my girlfriend's phone and knowing

789
00:46:34,651 --> 00:46:36,420
exactly what the bad news was.

790
00:46:36,421 --> 00:46:40,410
I snatched the phone from
her and proceeded to spill
my guts and told her the

791
00:46:40,411 --> 00:46:42,480
whole story. Well, there you
go. At least you're Amanda.

792
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:47,760
Evidently the friend dead
called was roommates with
the red head and the redhead

793
00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:52,710
through social media and hunted me down
and showed my picture to her roommates

794
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:56,540
too. You can't, you can't get away
with anything anymore. Look at this.

795
00:46:56,580 --> 00:47:01,200
The friend goes on to tell the redhead
that I have a girlfriend. Oh Dude,

796
00:47:01,201 --> 00:47:03,480
this is what this is like.
You're going to end up with nothing here.

797
00:47:03,481 --> 00:47:05,610
My girlfriend obviously was super upset,

798
00:47:05,611 --> 00:47:10,410
but being the sweetheart she is and after
many many's, I'm so sorry. It's from me.

799
00:47:10,411 --> 00:47:13,530
She agreed to let me make,
try to make it up to her.

800
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:15,613
MMM.

801
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:19,690
Kind of cheaters do this shit.
I didn't even last 48 hours.

802
00:47:19,691 --> 00:47:24,640
Cut to two weeks later myself in three
of my buddies since kindergarten or on a

803
00:47:24,641 --> 00:47:26,800
mountaineering expedition in Peru.

804
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:28,530
Okay.

805
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:30,310
Do what do you Jason Bourne,

806
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:31,061
what's going on here?

807
00:47:31,061 --> 00:47:34,810
Hot chicks throwing themselves at you
and now you're in fucking Peru. Uh,

808
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:39,010
a trip we planned since February and I
get this panic stricken email from my

809
00:47:39,011 --> 00:47:44,011
girlfriend saying she parentheses the
redhead had broken into my apartment and

810
00:47:44,951 --> 00:47:49,000
trash the place.
See attached photos.

811
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:51,190
Okay.

812
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:55,270
Do what the fuck women are fucking crazy.

813
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:59,820
Let's just say, let's just say this. Okay.

814
00:48:01,530 --> 00:48:03,090
Like how was she hurt?

815
00:48:03,870 --> 00:48:07,470
She came walking up to you
through her fucking clam at you.

816
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:09,740
You fucking took it.
Who?

817
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:13,570
You're not in a relationship
with her like voices.

818
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:15,150
Lily crackers had a really shit,

819
00:48:15,151 --> 00:48:18,210
you don't have to fucking relationship
with her dude. You need a cross. The cute,

820
00:48:18,211 --> 00:48:22,960
this fucking woman. This has to stop
this whole fucking thing that would,

821
00:48:22,961 --> 00:48:25,840
women get upset.
They can destroy property.

822
00:48:27,990 --> 00:48:32,490
Let a guy go out and fucking trash some
woman's car after she fucks around on

823
00:48:32,491 --> 00:48:36,090
him. He'll end up in jail and
have to pay for the fucking car.

824
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,410
Everything was smashed.
My TV, one of my guitar,

825
00:48:39,411 --> 00:48:41,610
she cut up my bedsheets and the dubé.

826
00:48:41,970 --> 00:48:45,990
She even went so far as to throw all my
towels in the bathtub and ran the water.

827
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:49,820
How do I know it was the red head?
The dumb bitch left a note next to TV.

828
00:48:49,830 --> 00:48:53,910
St cheaters never win or some bullshit
like that. Give me a fucking break.

829
00:48:53,911 --> 00:48:58,440
She even bragged about the whole
ordeal to her affirmation roommate.

830
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:01,170
Classic Guy.
He just writes sheesh.

831
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:03,780
My borough friend called my girlfriend
called the cops and a problem.

832
00:49:03,781 --> 00:49:07,050
I returned from Peru. I set up a
restraining order against the redhead.

833
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:10,510
You should fucking chart.
You should, you should sewer.

834
00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:12,241
Here's the problem.

835
00:49:12,241 --> 00:49:15,390
All this drama has led to my girlfriend
reconsidering her willingness to give me

836
00:49:15,391 --> 00:49:18,180
a second chance. Dude, his surreal thing.

837
00:49:18,181 --> 00:49:21,680
Anytime some fucking smoking hot girl
just comes up and throws it at you.

838
00:49:21,681 --> 00:49:22,860
You know,
it's a headcase.

839
00:49:24,310 --> 00:49:25,143
Uh,

840
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,660
go with a fake name. Um, I,

841
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:34,100
I feel real bad about the whole situation
and want to make it work between us,

842
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:36,200
but there's this little
voice in my head says,

843
00:49:36,230 --> 00:49:39,890
let her break up with you and start fresh.
I'm pretty confused.

844
00:49:39,891 --> 00:49:43,460
I was going to say that. Just
start over again, dude. You're 26.

845
00:49:44,090 --> 00:49:48,680
What are you going to, you know, you got a
dick. This is going to happen. All right?

846
00:49:48,681 --> 00:49:50,360
So he goes,
I fucked up initially,

847
00:49:50,390 --> 00:49:54,650
but forgiveness then got fucked with in
the forgiveness was retracted. Anyways,

848
00:49:54,651 --> 00:49:55,490
I hope your site,

849
00:49:55,550 --> 00:49:58,910
your sage advice is half as good
as those fucking pies you make.

850
00:49:58,911 --> 00:50:02,390
Thanks a lot and go fuck yourself.
Yeah, Dude. You know what you gotta do?

851
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:05,990
You gotta walk and you got to
have this crazy redheaded a bitch.

852
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:07,100
Pay For your shit.

853
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:09,913
All right.

854
00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:15,220
Jesus Christ. She takes no responsibility
in that. Just walking around,

855
00:50:15,221 --> 00:50:17,050
throwing a fucking pussy and everybody,
I mean,

856
00:50:17,051 --> 00:50:18,520
what the fuck he thinks going to happen,

857
00:50:21,530 --> 00:50:22,363
you know,

858
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:25,740
is a guy you could walk around throwing
your Dick at fucking people for,

859
00:50:25,830 --> 00:50:27,030
for years and not get,

860
00:50:29,410 --> 00:50:32,410
this is why there's the double
standard. You know, if a guy does it,

861
00:50:32,411 --> 00:50:37,000
he's a stud because he has to convince
people just the way we're set,

862
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:40,990
it was just, it's the
way we're set up. Okay.

863
00:50:40,991 --> 00:50:43,180
Women are no better than guys.
It's what it is,

864
00:50:43,181 --> 00:50:47,920
is the way they're set up anatomically
is they're letting someone enter their

865
00:50:47,921 --> 00:50:52,420
body. That is a major decision.
Sticking your Dick in something. It's,

866
00:50:52,510 --> 00:50:57,480
you know, it's funny. It's like, you know,

867
00:50:57,490 --> 00:50:59,350
it's like putting Sera back
in the cabinet. I mean,

868
00:50:59,351 --> 00:51:02,110
you don't even fucking think
about, um, I probably, you know,

869
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:05,440
that was probably ignorance
in there. I, yeah, I would
just say like, you know what?

870
00:51:05,441 --> 00:51:06,730
You're right.
I fucked up.

871
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:12,950
That's a really big pet peeve of mine
that fucking women get to do shit like

872
00:51:12,951 --> 00:51:15,590
that. They teach us, get to
walk around, destroy your Shit,

873
00:51:16,730 --> 00:51:18,540
just fucked up your TV and all that dude.

874
00:51:18,541 --> 00:51:22,760
Then you just in your whole thing is just
like sheesh. Like we're like, we like,

875
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:28,420
we're just conditioned to be like,
all right, well that's what they do.

876
00:51:28,421 --> 00:51:33,370
They ruin your stuff, dude. You are 100%
the wrong. You shouldn't have done it.

877
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,950
It definitely did a piece of shit thing,
you know?

878
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:40,150
But that doesn't give somebody the
right to go to break into your fucking

879
00:51:40,151 --> 00:51:43,240
apartment that's breaking and
entering and destroying property.

880
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:44,710
She should be in jail.

881
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:47,143
MMM.

882
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:52,260
This is what you do. I would break up
with her and uh, I would, I would, yeah,

883
00:51:52,261 --> 00:51:55,750
I would try to take legal action against
the red head and at some point I'd s

884
00:51:56,070 --> 00:51:58,770
you know, you want to send her a
note, but don't do it. Just say, yeah.

885
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,590
Breaking and entering, you know,
fucking felons never wind either.

886
00:52:01,591 --> 00:52:02,580
Whatever the fuck that is.

887
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:04,673
MMM.

888
00:52:05,670 --> 00:52:09,960
Yeah, Dude. Whatever you
know it happened. And uh,

889
00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:13,290
you know, you know what I would do
with your 26. Stay single for a while.

890
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,950
Stay single for a while, go
to the gym, get back in shape,

891
00:52:16,951 --> 00:52:18,270
figured out what the fuck you want to do.

892
00:52:18,271 --> 00:52:21,990
Do you want to fuck a bunch of women or
do you want to meet the one? You know,

893
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:27,270
I, but I, I think at this point,
dude, you got enough fucking drama.

894
00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:33,020
I can't believe she gets to do that.
Like first of all,

895
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:37,130
she got laid the redhead, she
got fucking late. You know,

896
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:40,890
she had a great fucking time and she
gets to bust up somebody's place,

897
00:52:40,891 --> 00:52:44,450
like a fucking rock star and then walk
out of there and feel like she's a

898
00:52:44,451 --> 00:52:45,500
fucking hero.

899
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:51,130
This is why I don't give a shit that
they make less an hour than I do.

900
00:52:51,370 --> 00:52:53,800
Because when you add up all
the fucking parks, I mean,

901
00:52:53,801 --> 00:52:57,250
it's a pretty good goddamn
deal. Being a woman, you know,

902
00:52:57,251 --> 00:52:59,590
you get all your emotions
out all the fucking time.

903
00:52:59,591 --> 00:53:03,250
You get to break up people's Shit
and you get to live longer than men.

904
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,080
I don't know what the fucking problem is.

905
00:53:05,530 --> 00:53:09,660
You're going to complain about
an extra 79 cents. Alright. Um,

906
00:53:09,730 --> 00:53:14,140
ex wife wants me to adopt ex's son.
Hey there.

907
00:53:14,141 --> 00:53:18,910
Bill Burlington coat factory. I usually
laugh at some of the poor schmucks.

908
00:53:18,911 --> 00:53:23,620
Who right into your, into you asking
the advice today. I'm that schmuck.

909
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:27,840
I won't go into every little about this
and hope she can give me some advice.

910
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:32,160
A few years ago I married
my soon to be ex wife. Dude,

911
00:53:32,161 --> 00:53:36,210
I was so fucking thinking about that
woman ruining your apartment and how they

912
00:53:36,211 --> 00:53:39,420
can just get away with that. Let me,
let me, I wasn't even paying attention.

913
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:44,250
I mean it's again, I am today. I'm the
smock. Okay. I won't go to every detail.

914
00:53:44,310 --> 00:53:44,640
All right.

915
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:49,020
A few years ago I married my soon to be
ex wife along with the marriage came or

916
00:53:49,021 --> 00:53:49,950
two year old son.

917
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:54,600
His biological father is a deadbeat who
didn't hold down a job and avoids child

918
00:53:54,601 --> 00:53:59,100
support. He has never had any
contact with the sun. Wow. All right.

919
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:03,870
So I did the most manly thing that one
can do besides going to community college.

920
00:54:04,290 --> 00:54:07,260
I put on my big boy pants and
I took her son in is my own.

921
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:10,920
He Calls me Dad and whatnot.
We bonded.

922
00:54:10,921 --> 00:54:14,670
I really care for the kid the first few
years of marriage, my wife for great,

923
00:54:14,671 --> 00:54:17,970
which ended up leading us to
having our very own daughter.

924
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,650
And then my wife turned into a
whore. Oh God. What happened? Uh,

925
00:54:22,651 --> 00:54:26,730
so we're going through the divorce
and I still pick both kids up,

926
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:29,580
even though I'm legally
responsible for one.

927
00:54:29,610 --> 00:54:33,150
I carry her and her son on
my insurance to this day.

928
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:34,980
Maybe against my better judgment,

929
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:39,000
but I'd like to give her some time to get
our shit together until I drop her off,

930
00:54:40,790 --> 00:54:45,020
drop her off of it. Complete dropper out
of it. I think been sick completely. Well,

931
00:54:45,021 --> 00:54:47,930
the finalization of the
divorce papers is in August.

932
00:54:47,931 --> 00:54:52,340
The soon to be ex mother in law keeps
insisting that I legally adopt her

933
00:54:52,341 --> 00:54:55,250
grandson. No, don't do
that. Now here's the thing.

934
00:54:55,490 --> 00:54:58,990
I send a very gracious amount
in support payments biweekly.

935
00:55:00,090 --> 00:55:00,923
MMM.

936
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:05,690
We choose to not go through the court
system because my ex sees that I'm a good

937
00:55:05,691 --> 00:55:09,320
father and still take responsibility
of her son. Keep it like that.

938
00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:14,660
I flat out said, no, I'm not
legally adopting him yet.

939
00:55:14,661 --> 00:55:19,010
Your fucking mother in law does not want
you to legally adopt him because she

940
00:55:19,011 --> 00:55:21,290
thinks you're a good father.
Okay.

941
00:55:21,291 --> 00:55:25,250
She's looking at you like an ATM
machine like a lot of women do with men,

942
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:26,450
which once again,

943
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:30,800
you can't fucking say that despite
the 10 million fucking examples of it,

944
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:34,160
it's considered sexist.
All right? One wrong move.

945
00:55:34,550 --> 00:55:39,350
And now the court system has me by
the balls for support for two legal,

946
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:44,420
uh, children. What, what happened?
Yeah. Yes. It flat out. Yeah.

947
00:55:44,421 --> 00:55:46,430
He said and flat out. No,
because one wrong move.

948
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:49,100
And now the court system has me legally
by the balls for the sport of two

949
00:55:49,101 --> 00:55:52,070
children. Yeah. There's no
fucking reason for you to do that.

950
00:55:52,071 --> 00:55:55,600
They don't hold anything over you.
They have no negotiating, nothing. Uh,

951
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:58,490
the mother in law is in sit unless they
try to keep your daughter from you.

952
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:01,790
The mother-in-law's insisting
that if I don't legally adopt him,

953
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:04,130
I'm a scumbag who doesn't
deserve to see him.

954
00:56:04,370 --> 00:56:07,700
And he was gone so far in so many
words to say, I won't be seeing him.

955
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:11,150
She's even getting my ex on
board with this. Like I said,

956
00:56:11,151 --> 00:56:12,410
I really care for the kid.

957
00:56:12,650 --> 00:56:16,610
He's a good kid who will never had a
father figure until I came into his life

958
00:56:16,611 --> 00:56:20,440
six years ago. What's my play here?
Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. Uh,

959
00:56:20,450 --> 00:56:23,150
what you're seeing with
these two fucking lunatics,

960
00:56:24,430 --> 00:56:28,690
um,
generation fucking psychos here,

961
00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:33,490
uh, is the tip of the fucking
iceberg with these people. Okay?

962
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:35,290
They don't give a shit about you.

963
00:56:35,410 --> 00:56:39,970
They're looking at you like an ATM machine
and they're already fucking with you.

964
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:40,451
They don't,

965
00:56:40,451 --> 00:56:45,220
they don't have that kid's
best interest in mind.

966
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:49,690
They think they do. They don't. They
using him as a fucking negotiating tool.

967
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:52,960
All right. I'm surprised
they haven't said, well,

968
00:56:52,961 --> 00:56:56,230
we'll fucking go for full custody with
your daughter and try to fuck with it.

969
00:56:56,231 --> 00:57:01,060
That'll probably be there next fucking
move. And it's the thing with them,

970
00:57:02,050 --> 00:57:06,070
okay with them.
It's the more you're in their lives,

971
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:07,420
the worst it's going to get.

972
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:12,370
Do not legally bound yourself to them
whatsoever. And this is what I would do.

973
00:57:12,490 --> 00:57:16,330
Do not get emotional at all. Do
not get into a fuck you. Fuck you.

974
00:57:16,331 --> 00:57:19,900
Fight with the mother in law. Do
not get into a fuck you. Fuck you.

975
00:57:19,901 --> 00:57:23,830
Fight with your soon to be ex wife.

976
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:28,210
You have leverage in that your ex wife,

977
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:32,590
as much as she's, you know, going to
divorce you here still cares about you.

978
00:57:32,591 --> 00:57:34,810
You guys still had a child together

979
00:57:36,270 --> 00:57:37,103
and

980
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:41,390
you just have to just talk to
her logically and just say,

981
00:57:41,450 --> 00:57:44,330
I'm not comfortable doing that.
Um,

982
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:49,420
but I'm going to continue to make payments
and support and all that and help you

983
00:57:49,581 --> 00:57:54,470
out with your son and obviously
our daughter. All right. Um,

984
00:57:56,170 --> 00:57:59,680
and this pressure that you're,
your mother-in-law is putting on,

985
00:57:59,681 --> 00:58:03,130
this is only going to make
both of our lives miserable.

986
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:07,810
So what you do is you, you, you
divide and conquer there. Just say,

987
00:58:07,811 --> 00:58:12,700
I have no problem with you
and the way that we get along.

988
00:58:12,790 --> 00:58:14,770
I don't think your in
mother-in-law understands.

989
00:58:14,771 --> 00:58:18,220
And that's why she's applying this
pressure. But that pressure is,

990
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:20,950
it's going to be bad for us and
it's going to be bad for our kids.

991
00:58:21,010 --> 00:58:24,010
Let's just continue going on like this.
I love you son,

992
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:28,690
and you know I'm going to continue to
support him. That's as far as it goes.

993
00:58:29,070 --> 00:58:32,650
All right. And I totally
comfortable with supporting them.

994
00:58:33,070 --> 00:58:36,550
I'm giving you my word, but I'm not,
you know, I'm not doing the legal thing.

995
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:40,930
I'm not doing it. And you
just, that's it. That's it.

996
00:58:40,931 --> 00:58:43,360
And if they want to keep coming at you,
I'm telling you right now,

997
00:58:43,570 --> 00:58:46,420
if you do think that, if, when
you legally adopt that kid,

998
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:50,590
do you honestly fucking think that that's
going to be the end of the demands?

999
00:58:50,770 --> 00:58:54,430
What the fuck is the mother-in-law
involved in this shit for anyways?

1000
00:58:55,570 --> 00:59:00,400
Right there. That's a nightmare.
That's a fucking nightmare situation.

1001
00:59:00,401 --> 00:59:03,880
And so many married women
have that fucking debt,

1002
00:59:03,910 --> 00:59:08,500
ridiculously close relationship with
their mom. You know what I mean?

1003
00:59:08,501 --> 00:59:12,100
And it it to the point that it hurts
the fucking relationship and God forbid

1004
00:59:12,370 --> 00:59:16,330
it's as if a guy you keep bringing your
mom to the fucking relationship with

1005
00:59:16,331 --> 00:59:20,650
your wife. That's dead. That's a
fucking rap. It's a fucking rap.

1006
00:59:20,651 --> 00:59:22,010
But once again,
guys

1007
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:23,870
put up with that shit.
We put up with that shit.

1008
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:26,840
We put up with them coming in
and busting up our shit. Dude,

1009
00:59:26,841 --> 00:59:31,610
you hold all of the fucking cards
here. That's it. They don't have,

1010
00:59:31,611 --> 00:59:33,410
they don't have, they
don't have a dime. They,

1011
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:36,380
they're not even in the fucking game.
You hold all the fucking cards.

1012
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:39,680
Do not do this.
You don't have to do this.

1013
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:44,060
Just stay calm and keep reassuring your,

1014
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:49,080
your soon to be ex wife that you know
you're doing what's best for the kids and

1015
00:59:50,301 --> 00:59:53,660
what's best for you and what's best
for the both of you guys and just keep

1016
00:59:53,661 --> 00:59:54,440
saying,
ah,

1017
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:57,860
this pressure that's your mother in
law is putting on us is unnecessarily

1018
00:59:58,070 --> 01:00:01,850
unnecessary. It's, it's,
it's just we're good.

1019
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:06,590
Okay. I'm still like, if I
was going to be vindictive,

1020
01:00:06,591 --> 01:00:10,460
it would've happened by now. I'm still
picking both of them up. All right.

1021
01:00:10,850 --> 01:00:13,700
There's no way I'm going to let anything
happen to your son and there's no way

1022
01:00:13,701 --> 01:00:17,420
I'm letting anything happened to
our daughter. That's it. That's it.

1023
01:00:17,450 --> 01:00:21,710
So tell your fucking
mother to shut the fuck.

1024
01:00:21,711 --> 01:00:26,210
I can't do that part. Don't do that part.
All right, Harry girlfriend. No, Jesus.

1025
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:29,630
Here we go. Harry
girlfriend. Dear red herring

1026
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:35,690
on a 25 year old guy of moderately
good looks in mid level intelligence.

1027
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:39,290
Uh, this is both the, if that
means you're actually a smart guy,

1028
01:00:39,350 --> 01:00:43,070
people walk around thinking
this smarter fucking dopes. Uh,

1029
01:00:44,270 --> 01:00:47,420
this is both helped and hurt my game.
I've had girlfriend,

1030
01:00:47,421 --> 01:00:49,220
nobody who's like mildly intelligent,

1031
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:53,720
like thinks that that takes like a
level of intelligence to understand that

1032
01:00:53,721 --> 01:00:56,870
there's a lot of people way
smarter than you. You know,

1033
01:00:56,990 --> 01:01:00,500
people would just get like that fucking
medium brain. Like they walk around,

1034
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:05,430
they think that the shit, you know
what I mean? They walk around,

1035
01:01:05,450 --> 01:01:10,280
they make bold fucking statements
and people list too, right?

1036
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:14,420
Like Donald Trump, that guy's,
he's got a mid level brain.

1037
01:01:15,710 --> 01:01:17,960
He's too stupid to realize
what a fucking dope he is.

1038
01:01:17,961 --> 01:01:19,560
And then people just listen to him.
He's still,

1039
01:01:19,561 --> 01:01:22,280
you become the Pied Piper of fucking
morons. And next thing you know,

1040
01:01:22,281 --> 01:01:27,020
you're there. Uh Oh God,
what a fucking decision.

1041
01:01:27,110 --> 01:01:31,730
That fucking idiot or that Goddam
lunatic. Anyways, here we go. Ah,

1042
01:01:31,731 --> 01:01:35,420
this is how, um, mid level intelligent,
I've had girlfriends in the past,

1043
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:38,810
but most were just objects of
lust instead of true connections.

1044
01:01:38,811 --> 01:01:42,260
I met a new girl through a dating
APP. Not Proud of that. Why?

1045
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:46,490
I wish that thing existed back in the day.
It's like the fucking draft.

1046
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:50,720
All of a sudden you're fucking Bill
Bella checking your Dick there. Uh,

1047
01:01:52,190 --> 01:01:55,520
and things are great. She's
beautiful, smart, and actually
gets my sense of humor.

1048
01:01:55,550 --> 01:01:57,020
That's why dating apps are great.

1049
01:01:57,050 --> 01:02:00,410
You can cut through a lot of bullshit
as far as I've heard or meet a serial

1050
01:02:00,411 --> 01:02:04,160
killer. After a while of casual dating,
we started to become more serious.

1051
01:02:04,190 --> 01:02:08,120
She is a Brazilian descent and
has some body here. Nothing crazy.

1052
01:02:08,121 --> 01:02:11,540
Just arms and lower back type shit.
Here's my question.

1053
01:02:11,541 --> 01:02:16,541
Is there a subtle way I can tell her to
lose the for or should I just stop being

1054
01:02:17,301 --> 01:02:21,900
a cunt and be happy? Thanks.
And Go fuck yourself. Um,

1055
01:02:23,930 --> 01:02:25,160
all right.
How do you do this?

1056
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:29,690
Best case scenario is
you're a little furry too.

1057
01:02:30,650 --> 01:02:33,440
And then would you do is say,
Hey, I'm going to go fucking

1058
01:02:35,390 --> 01:02:39,230
get some of the fucking let her
know hair taken off my back.

1059
01:02:39,231 --> 01:02:42,980
You want to do a two for one? That's
not gonna work. Don't say that.

1060
01:02:43,970 --> 01:02:48,870
Um,
oh Jesus Christ.

1061
01:02:49,530 --> 01:02:54,420
She has someone on her lower
back and where else? Oh,

1062
01:02:54,421 --> 01:02:56,280
on her arm.
So she just her arms.

1063
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:58,193
Uh,

1064
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:03,460
you know what I'm going to fucking to act
like on. Who wants to be a millionaire?

1065
01:03:03,461 --> 01:03:05,980
I'm going to fucking phone up.
Not even phone a friend.

1066
01:03:06,910 --> 01:03:09,340
I'm going to fucking Google this.

1067
01:03:10,060 --> 01:03:12,550
How to tell your girlfriend

1068
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:19,770
she is too hairy.

1069
01:03:22,230 --> 01:03:26,280
How to get out of a hairy situation.
Five ways to get a girl

1070
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:32,820
to shave downtown. Oh Gosh. Can
I say the worst? I, you know,

1071
01:03:32,821 --> 01:03:36,600
I actually thought you know what
that was on the Bro. bible.com.

1072
01:03:37,350 --> 01:03:38,370
Hey Bro,

1073
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:42,510
how'd he tell a girl she
has a bit of facial hair?

1074
01:03:42,570 --> 01:03:46,080
My girlfriend has a lot of hair on
her ass. How do I approach this? Okay,

1075
01:03:46,081 --> 01:03:47,670
here we go.
This is on reddit.

1076
01:03:49,410 --> 01:03:50,430
Uh,

1077
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:55,820
you don't read.
It's not going to have the fucking answer.

1078
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:58,790
I'm going to go with this one.
The student room.

1079
01:03:58,910 --> 01:04:03,170
How do I tell my girlfriend she's too
Harry l this is another fucking shit, Ron.

1080
01:04:03,171 --> 01:04:06,080
I'm dating a girl. Okay.
We know what the deal is.

1081
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:11,420
How dare you dislike something that comes
naturally. Oh God. These fucking broads.

1082
01:04:11,660 --> 01:04:12,890
I swear to God.

1083
01:04:13,820 --> 01:04:18,820
Hashtag yes all women stop and posing
your fucking patriarchal standards on this

1084
01:04:20,181 --> 01:04:23,090
poor girl. If you have nothing good
to say, don't say anything at all.

1085
01:04:23,091 --> 01:04:25,400
It's her body. Uh, gimme a fuck.

1086
01:04:25,401 --> 01:04:28,220
And it what women do the second getting
a fucking relationship with them.

1087
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:32,690
They're constantly trying to change you.
If you don't like it,

1088
01:04:32,691 --> 01:04:36,230
don't be with her. Don't make her feel
insecure. If Jesus is all a Harry chicks,

1089
01:04:36,231 --> 01:04:39,590
a chime in in, how would you like if
she told you to shave your sweaty,

1090
01:04:39,591 --> 01:04:43,220
hairy balls?
I would say absolutely sweetheart.

1091
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:48,680
Why would I want to have hairy sweaty
balls in your face if it's turned you off?

1092
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:53,300
The game plan here is to get in the mood.
By all means. What do you want me to do?

1093
01:04:54,470 --> 01:04:59,060
A, you could maybe remove your own Man
Lady Garden that would create natural

1094
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:02,570
opportunity to discuss your lady friends,
luxury and growth.

1095
01:05:03,050 --> 01:05:04,520
That was kind of my suggestion.

1096
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:06,020
Okay.

1097
01:05:06,020 --> 01:05:06,600
Uh,

1098
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:09,450
just tell her seriously,

1099
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:12,930
why do you let people create
stupid threats? Ah, Jesus.

1100
01:05:15,790 --> 01:05:19,480
Uh, yeah, I don't, I don't,
yeah, this is a hard one.

1101
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:25,010
Yeah, that's a really fucking difficult
one. Cause you're talking about something,

1102
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:27,440
it's just weird thing that they can help,

1103
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:32,540
but they can also fix very
easily. Although, yeah,
it's Kinda hurts too. Right?

1104
01:05:33,230 --> 01:05:34,760
According to the 40 year old virgin.

1105
01:05:36,470 --> 01:05:37,303
MMM.

1106
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:43,760
Why don't you learn how to do it?
Did she sleep on her stomach? Right.

1107
01:05:44,990 --> 01:05:48,100
And then just when she's asleep, he just
put it on her and then you just go home

1108
01:05:49,610 --> 01:05:54,470
and then you as she sits up to scream,
you just fake asleep.

1109
01:05:57,860 --> 01:06:02,090
He goes, what the fuck was that man?
I Dunno. I think you had a bad dream.

1110
01:06:02,091 --> 01:06:06,350
And she's like, my back's killing me.
Oh, well you sleeping on your front.

1111
01:06:06,351 --> 01:06:08,990
Maybe you were putting pressure on your
spine then, you know, I don't know.

1112
01:06:10,310 --> 01:06:13,100
And then when she wakes up the
next fucking morning, you know,

1113
01:06:13,101 --> 01:06:17,270
she goes back to sleep. She wakes up the
next morning. Maybe she doesn't notice,

1114
01:06:17,271 --> 01:06:18,680
but then he got to do it every time.
Yeah.

1115
01:06:18,681 --> 01:06:21,830
I just gotta I guess you could just
got to tell like, come on ladies, you,

1116
01:06:21,831 --> 01:06:22,880
there's gotta be

1117
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:26,153
mmm.

1118
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:32,250
It's gotta be something that we do. Right.
They, you know what it is about women,

1119
01:06:32,251 --> 01:06:35,640
they can sit down, they could sit
down and just tell you. And as a guy,

1120
01:06:35,641 --> 01:06:39,660
he just have to take it. You just have to
fucking tell you this. It's constantly,

1121
01:06:39,661 --> 01:06:41,910
I think that does that why we
died before them. It's just,

1122
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:46,920
it's just a one way fucking street.
Ah, dude. I don't know how to, I don't,

1123
01:06:46,921 --> 01:06:51,480
I don't know what to tell you, man.
That's a tough one. Listen, I love you.

1124
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:56,400
I'm crazy about, yeah, I think
you're really attractive. Um,

1125
01:06:56,970 --> 01:07:00,850
I was just, it will, there's one thing,
you don't have bad breath. Yeah, yeah.

1126
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:03,070
You're gorgeous and all
that. It's, it's just,

1127
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:08,160
it is any way you could just take down
a little bit of the lower back for,

1128
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:11,760
I mean, you know, it's fun.
She's Brazilian, you know,

1129
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:14,790
they came up with the Brazilian wax.
It's like,

1130
01:07:14,791 --> 01:07:17,430
can you do the Brazilian
wax to your fucking back?

1131
01:07:21,150 --> 01:07:24,150
Why don't you get her to get her,
get her a tramp stamp. Right.

1132
01:07:24,151 --> 01:07:27,630
So we'll have to shave it anyways and
then you'll be like, ah, you know,

1133
01:07:27,631 --> 01:07:30,420
you gotta keep it shaved this so
people can always see it to that to

1134
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:34,760
get her an anchor tattoo on both forearms,
like,

1135
01:07:35,310 --> 01:07:37,380
or drag couple of dragons like bond Scott,

1136
01:07:37,410 --> 01:07:39,930
I don't know what to tell you to do that.
And I'll tell you, that's a rough one,

1137
01:07:39,931 --> 01:07:44,580
you know? Um, I'll try to remember that
one for Thursday when Nissan. All right.

1138
01:07:44,581 --> 01:07:48,870
Hey Bill, is there any type of Gig
you wouldn't do? Would you pref? Yeah,

1139
01:07:48,871 --> 01:07:49,704
of course there was.

1140
01:07:49,740 --> 01:07:53,970
Would you perform for the queen of
England and all our stiff cohorts?

1141
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:58,560
Now, how about a room full of
priests, a priest at the Vatican?

1142
01:07:58,590 --> 01:08:00,990
Absolutely not.
Not all this shit I've said about them.

1143
01:08:00,991 --> 01:08:03,990
And then I'm in their country.
That's a sovereign state Vatican City.

1144
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:05,280
Bonus question.

1145
01:08:05,281 --> 01:08:10,110
What is the exact dollar amount it
would take you to do a cruise ship?

1146
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:14,940
Well, I already, I did one a long time
ago. No, I, there's no dollar amount.

1147
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:16,180
I,
uh,

1148
01:08:16,180 --> 01:08:17,570
I don't have a lot of,
uh,

1149
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:19,093
okay.

1150
01:08:19,510 --> 01:08:23,260
And that really into stuff. I'm
into no debt. So I've kept my,

1151
01:08:23,380 --> 01:08:28,380
I've lived within my means and I have
enough t shirts and shit and I can eat.

1152
01:08:28,510 --> 01:08:31,950
And uh, you know, so no, I,

1153
01:08:31,970 --> 01:08:36,790
I can make enough money on land.
I don't need to do that.

1154
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:41,760
Um, there is no amount.
There really isn't. Uh,

1155
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:47,460
as of today, July 11th, 2016, what?
The 10th one I'm doing it. Who knows?

1156
01:08:47,461 --> 01:08:52,110
In the future, I dunno when
I'm like 60, I imagine.

1157
01:08:52,111 --> 01:08:54,860
Then you could talk me on a boat
if you gave me, like bill will get,

1158
01:08:54,870 --> 01:08:59,000
you could do one more fucking Gig. We're
going to give you a fucking, you know,

1159
01:08:59,310 --> 01:09:03,900
something's zillion dollars to do this
gig and then you got to walk away from

1160
01:09:03,901 --> 01:09:07,050
stand up. I might be so fucking
tired at that point that I do it,

1161
01:09:07,051 --> 01:09:09,420
but as of right now, 48 years old, a,

1162
01:09:09,421 --> 01:09:12,300
there's no dollar amount that can
get me on a fucking cruise ship.

1163
01:09:12,900 --> 01:09:13,733
MMM.

1164
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:15,521
You know,

1165
01:09:15,521 --> 01:09:19,990
what could a a benefit if there was
some sort of benefit or some shit and it

1166
01:09:19,991 --> 01:09:23,770
actually seemed legit. I'm a sucker for
a fucking benefit, but like, you know,

1167
01:09:24,950 --> 01:09:27,880
I don't care.
I don't need to go on a fucking boat.

1168
01:09:27,881 --> 01:09:31,870
I don't want to go on a boat and just
be on this fucking thing with the crowd

1169
01:09:32,740 --> 01:09:37,120
the entire time. And uh, you know,
if you're happy and you know it,

1170
01:09:37,121 --> 01:09:39,190
clap your hands. I bet on
it. They fucking brutal.

1171
01:09:39,250 --> 01:09:42,760
I worked with guy doing that
and there was a juggler and a,

1172
01:09:42,761 --> 01:09:44,290
you couldn't fucking say anything.

1173
01:09:44,890 --> 01:09:47,530
You just had to sit there and act like
the cruise was the greatest fucking thing

1174
01:09:47,531 --> 01:09:48,460
you ever had been a part of.

1175
01:09:48,461 --> 01:09:52,150
It just went against everything
about being a comedian, you know,

1176
01:09:52,151 --> 01:09:56,260
we're contrarians. Um, all right,
so that's the podcast. Uh, people,

1177
01:09:56,261 --> 01:09:57,300
if you want to write in and in,

1178
01:09:57,310 --> 01:09:59,950
anybody have a hairy girlfriend out there
and you had to say something or, or,

1179
01:09:59,990 --> 01:10:04,060
or even better women have you
there had to be something.

1180
01:10:05,590 --> 01:10:09,220
Yeah, Guy, maybe he had a giant fucking
something on the side of his fucking,

1181
01:10:09,221 --> 01:10:12,190
I don't know what his head or some shit,
you know?

1182
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:13,900
Okay.

1183
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:16,630
It was wardee moly or some shit.

1184
01:10:16,660 --> 01:10:20,200
You had to say something had halitosis.

1185
01:10:23,070 --> 01:10:23,903
I Dunno.

1186
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:28,610
I think if a woman had a smelly vagina,
I think it'd be easier to tell her that.

1187
01:10:28,611 --> 01:10:29,840
Then she had a hairy back.

1188
01:10:31,370 --> 01:10:32,203
Uh,

1189
01:10:34,350 --> 01:10:36,420
how do you, how do you do, how
did you just listen? You know,

1190
01:10:36,421 --> 01:10:39,060
I think you're beautiful. You know,
I think you're gorgeous and you know,

1191
01:10:39,061 --> 01:10:42,810
you turn me on and everything, but
I, I just, you know what's so funny?

1192
01:10:42,811 --> 01:10:47,390
It's just how guys, you know, just
our shit is not validated. You know,

1193
01:10:47,391 --> 01:10:51,540
like if a woman didn't,
you know, was turned off by
something God for fucking bit.

1194
01:10:51,541 --> 01:10:54,840
I mean, if you still climbed on top
of her with your hairy back, I mean,

1195
01:10:54,841 --> 01:10:58,860
I think you'd be charged with some
sort of like, you know, I dunno,

1196
01:10:59,010 --> 01:11:04,010
pubic raper bad pube break or some shit
cops would show up and putting in some

1197
01:11:04,801 --> 01:11:06,870
sort of choke hold and drag
it out of the fucking house.

1198
01:11:06,871 --> 01:11:10,500
And God knows if you ever
see anybody again. Um,

1199
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:14,190
yeah. You know what, you
me, I got to think about

1200
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:17,580
that one. Um, all right, well, that's
a podcast. The Monday morning podcasts.

1201
01:11:17,970 --> 01:11:20,580
Go fuck yourselves.
Enjoy your next couple of days.

1202
01:11:20,581 --> 01:11:24,210
I'll check in on you on Thursday and
maybe I'll have Nia helped me answer that

1203
01:11:24,211 --> 01:11:27,390
question. All right. Uh,
let's it go. Fuck yourself.
