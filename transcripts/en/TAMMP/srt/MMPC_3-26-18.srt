1
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:02,081
Hey,

the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:05,501 --> 00:00:09,580
March 25th,

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:14,560
2018 what's going on? How are you? Oh,

5
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:15,970

6
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:17,410
Yeah.

7
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:20,940
Everything's gonna be
fine. Okay. Shake it off.

8
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24,890
What'd you think?
Bad stuff was only going to happen.

9
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:28,580
Other people every once in a while comes
to your neighborhood. Shake it off.

10
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:33,970
Put a smile on your mother fucker.
Um,

11
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:40,400
anyways, uh oh. Did I
wake up mad this morning?

12
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:41,480
What a surprise.

13
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:46,780
What are unique emotion from the freckled
country you've come to know and love?

14
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:48,830
Yeah.

15
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:51,890
Um, by the way, you know,

16
00:00:51,891 --> 00:00:55,040
and now that I went through all of that
bullshit to get on fucking Instagram,

17
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:58,390
the fact that you have to follow
9,000 fucking people or you,

18
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:02,540
you get to say you're just staring
at the same photo every fucking day.

19
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:04,820
And it's just really like a,
it's like a maze.

20
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:06,330
Okay.

21
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,990
You know, you're on Twitter,
you just fucking on Twitter now.

22
00:01:09,991 --> 00:01:13,980
You still have to follow people, I
guess. Now I got to fucking go on.

23
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,530
I got to fucking follow
all these fucking gay,

24
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:18,620
get on the edge of my wife's telling me,
get on here.

25
00:01:18,621 --> 00:01:22,170
We just follow all your friends
and some speaking things.

26
00:01:22,171 --> 00:01:26,470
You're interested so I can just
be another mouth breathing dope.

27
00:01:26,471 --> 00:01:31,080
Staring at my fucking phone. I already,
I already stare at it too much.

28
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:33,900
Um,
you know,

29
00:01:33,901 --> 00:01:36,750
I thought I was going to get on Instagram
and all it's going to see his ass and

30
00:01:36,751 --> 00:01:40,110
titties and I just not seeing it.
Right.

31
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:44,490
It's probably cause I only follow Dean
del Ray and Joe Rogan. So what I see is,

32
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:46,440
uh,
what did I see?

33
00:01:46,441 --> 00:01:50,850
I saw Joe Rogan walking around holding
a chicken with another 40 chickens

34
00:01:50,851 --> 00:01:55,110
following him. All right? All
these years I've known Joe Rogan.

35
00:01:55,111 --> 00:01:57,540
I had no idea that he owned chickens.

36
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:58,880
Okay.

37
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,350
You know, this is causing me to
reevaluate our entire friendship. I mean,

38
00:02:03,351 --> 00:02:06,080
I don't know why he would
keep that from me. Does he?

39
00:02:06,081 --> 00:02:08,210
Does he think he can't trust
me with that information?

40
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:12,110
That these are the kinds of things
I'm going to ask him the next time.

41
00:02:12,111 --> 00:02:13,280
I think I've had them on here.

42
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,590
Yeah.

43
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:20,000
I don't fucking know. Anyways. And,
and, and Dean del Ray's in New York,

44
00:02:20,001 --> 00:02:23,080
that's what I know.
That's all I know.

45
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:31,090
No horse, no inspirational
workout videos. You know,

46
00:02:31,091 --> 00:02:34,510
where some guys trying to
inspire you to work out,

47
00:02:34,511 --> 00:02:36,820
but he's really just wanting
to take his shirt off.

48
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:43,500
You know what's funny about those fucking
Instagram people is beyond the fact

49
00:02:43,751 --> 00:02:47,770
that they're doing that show,
the inspirational celebrity would,

50
00:02:47,771 --> 00:02:49,270
they're just every day,
you know,

51
00:02:49,271 --> 00:02:52,780
acting like they have life all figured
out and now they're going to patch these

52
00:02:52,781 --> 00:02:57,190
gems on to you. Hey, next
time you're thinking outward,

53
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:02,220
look inward to find the real so your
truth can be even fucking sent to the

54
00:03:02,921 --> 00:03:05,230
stratosphere and shut the fuck up.

55
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,940
Yeah.
And the other one I love,

56
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:16,180
I love the celebrity fucking standing
outside his private jet with this serious

57
00:03:16,491 --> 00:03:20,940
look on his face. How about
a smile? You fucking cunt

58
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,310
standing there, yo. This is how we do.

59
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:27,900
Yeah.

60
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,590
This is my Louis Vuitton luggage.
What a fucking moron.

61
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:36,650
Gotta asshole buys $5,000 fucking pieces
of luggage so some asshole can throw it

62
00:03:38,191 --> 00:03:42,130
in the bottom of a fucking United
flight. You know? I don't know.

63
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:45,570
You'd have to fly private for the rest
of your life and watch your luggage just

64
00:03:45,571 --> 00:03:47,820
go easy,
easy,

65
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:54,210
or you could just get a fucking bag
that's designed to get the shit kicked out

66
00:03:54,211 --> 00:03:56,610
of it. You can keep all your
fucking jewels inside of it.

67
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:58,820
Okay.

68
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,260
Oh my God.
If I see one more,

69
00:04:00,261 --> 00:04:04,640
can't do the photo shoot with all
their cars and then there's the fucking

70
00:04:04,641 --> 00:04:08,860
private jet in the background. What?
What does, what is that? You know?

71
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,450
Just to fuck fucking just put it under.

72
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:15,260
I'm rubbing it in your face
that I have more money than you.

73
00:04:15,261 --> 00:04:19,670
Don't fucking do that thing where I'm
trying to inspire you to get to my level.

74
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:22,443
Okay.

75
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:26,140
Do you realize everything that
has to be involved? They're like,

76
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:28,510
you have to fucking call
up the fucking airport.

77
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:31,510
Some poor bastard has to do that.
You have your cars.

78
00:04:31,511 --> 00:04:33,100
It's not enough that you have your cars.

79
00:04:33,101 --> 00:04:34,870
It's not enough that
you're flying private.

80
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:39,550
It's not enough that your luggage costs
more than what a lot of people make to

81
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:43,450
fucking teach kids in public schools.
You have to have all of that. I mean,

82
00:04:43,451 --> 00:04:47,230
how many fucking drivers do you need
to get all your fucking cars out there?

83
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,030
Did you got to figure out what
fucking outfit you're gonna wear?

84
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:58,630
I don't know. Anyways, plowing ahead,

85
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:02,800
but that is the kind of shit that I want
to see are actually kind of have this

86
00:05:02,801 --> 00:05:04,900
thing going on with,
with friends of mine.

87
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,740
Well we just send each other
all of those like photos.

88
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:09,530
Yeah.

89
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:12,380
You know that poor kid who died
there, the, the humble Brag Guy,

90
00:05:12,381 --> 00:05:15,000
he would've had a fucking
field day on Instagram. Okay.

91
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:21,160
Jesus Christ. I mean, that's
why I kind of went on there.

92
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,440
I just didn't realize it was going to
be that much work to try and find all of

93
00:05:24,441 --> 00:05:28,010
those fucking photos because people would
just send me them all the time and I

94
00:05:28,011 --> 00:05:31,430
was like, Jesus Christ, I really
missing out not being on Instagram.

95
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,480
And then you get on there.
And I,

96
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:37,640
I've followed Dean del Ray and Joe Rogan
and my beautiful wife, and that's it.

97
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:42,400
And Rogan and deed, Delray, or normal
grounded human being. So it's just

98
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,920
tell me who to follow.
Okay.

99
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:53,190
I do enough fucking promotional
as other ones. I just want to see,

100
00:05:53,191 --> 00:05:55,470
I want to see that.
That's the Shit I want to see.

101
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,290
I want to see people that
are pretending to inspire me,

102
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:00,970
but they're really just fucking,
you know,

103
00:06:00,971 --> 00:06:04,960
they want to show me how much money they
have or how great is shaped they're in.

104
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:10,570
Um, I mean, why can't everybody
be down to Earth like me?

105
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:14,920
I'm sorry, I'm just a self involved.
I'm just not as motivated in the gym.

106
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:19,840
Plus you, it's fun. Even if I got
shredded, I mean, if I took my shirt off,

107
00:06:19,841 --> 00:06:23,560
all people would say is like, dude,
fucking white. You are. Oh my God.

108
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:27,130
I'd be, what about my
boulevard, my Apac, abs?

109
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,780
Nobody cares. Um, all right,

110
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,660
so let's get to my week here.

111
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,670
I went and I saw ministry live
for the first time. I saw them,

112
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,800
uh, down at the, uh,

113
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:45,490
the fuck is it going at the
house of Blues in Anaheim.

114
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,700
And I was meeting some friends
down there and they're like, oh,

115
00:06:48,701 --> 00:06:53,650
we're at the fuck and we're at the Ramada
and my guy, so I fuck, we're at the bar.

116
00:06:53,651 --> 00:06:57,040
So I walk into the Ramada, go to
the fucking bar there. They, uh,

117
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,480
there's nobody there.

118
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,290
It turns out I'm at the Ron Romano who
knew there was more than one role model,

119
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:04,840
whatever the fuck it was, wherever
the hell that was gone. So anyways,

120
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:08,470
we ended up going over to the, uh, to
the show. It was just, it was awesome.

121
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:13,990
Live music was and
always will be the shit.

122
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:17,230
And I got to see them, uh,
basically played the entire album.

123
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,370
There are new album

125
00:07:26,111 --> 00:07:29,440
just fucking crushing it. Fucking
crushing it, man. You know,

126
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:33,700

front men still has the passion.

127
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:35,320
Okay.

128
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,290
Silky. You know, got the fucking crowd
going. You're looking around, you know,

129
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:42,560
a lot of people like my age by that,
like the fucking fourth song,

130
00:07:42,561 --> 00:07:47,420
there was a mosh pit.
I stayed clear of it.

131
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,800
I definitely stay clear of it,
but they got a bunch of, uh,

132
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:54,830
I think they're on like a 25 city
tour right now. And they write,

133
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:58,220
they did a Anaheim and then Oxnard,
I don't know where they're off to now.

134
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,320
When you promote a couple
of their dates here,

135
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:03,830
considering such a fucking awesome show.
Here we go.

136
00:08:03,831 --> 00:08:05,420
Am I man,

137
00:08:05,421 --> 00:08:09,620
this story toward dates?

138
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:12,430
He at that data that,
that,

139
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,740
come on, man. Why is my
Internet so fucking slow?

140
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:20,390
Yeah.

141
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:24,550
It'd be funny if they actually had it
run at the same speed as your intellect.

142
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,250
Okay.

143
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,750
And you couldn't get mad
anymore. It's like, well,

144
00:08:28,751 --> 00:08:31,690
it's because I'm a fucking
asshole. I'm dumb. All right.

145
00:08:31,691 --> 00:08:35,560
They're going to be in Sacramento
at the ace of spades. Portland,

146
00:08:35,561 --> 00:08:38,560
the Roseland theater. Oh, that's
a beauty. That's on Wednesday.

147
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:42,490
Thursday they're gonna be in
Vancouver at the vogue theater.

148
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:47,440
Saturday. They're going to
be an Edmonton. All right.

149
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:53,320
And then when they go into end to April,
they get a B in uh,

150
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:57,480
Montana, Nebraska, Chicago, Illinois.

151
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:03,090
A couple of nights there.
Cincinnati, grand rapids,

152
00:09:03,091 --> 00:09:06,810
Michigan, Indianapolis, Toronto,

153
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:12,540
Moria when they're playing great
places. BOSTON, April 17th,

154
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:18,750
um, couple of nights there. Portland,
Maine, Jesus, they'd go on everywhere.

155
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:21,240
He got to catch him and
the dude runs through

156
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:27,220
the fuck is it runs through the end of
April as far as what they have here. Um,

157
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:30,240
all right,
back to the podcast here.

158
00:09:30,241 --> 00:09:34,800
So old freckles forgot that it was formula
one season and unfortunately somebody

159
00:09:34,801 --> 00:09:38,010
on Twitter said, hey, are you excited
for this weekend? I was like, Oh shit.

160
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:41,790
That's right.
And because it's now not on NBC sports,

161
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:46,500
the ESPN cons took it over and God
knows they'll fuck it up somehow.

162
00:09:46,501 --> 00:09:48,180
That's what I thought they were
going to do. I've got to admit,

163
00:09:48,181 --> 00:09:52,080
I watched what I got out of the race.
I thought they did a good job,

164
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:56,400
although I don't understand why we'll
Buxton isn't there now they have like this

165
00:09:56,401 --> 00:09:57,810
comedy team or some shit.

166
00:09:57,811 --> 00:10:01,260
They got two people down there who
then throw it over to another guy.

167
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,750
You think ESPN would try to save money

168
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:07,740
and not fucking hire
three people for the job.

169
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:11,850
That one guy was doing outstandingly
since I've been watching, but a,

170
00:10:11,851 --> 00:10:14,520
I don't run the shit. So
anyways, I fucking go on in my,

171
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:19,530
my cable box and I go to record the
race and I don't know what happened.

172
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,220
All I recorded was the pregame,

173
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:26,730
which ended up getting me like
the first 10 laps of the race.

174
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:31,260
So I missed the fucking race. Uh, but
then I went on and I read all about it.

175
00:10:31,261 --> 00:10:35,220
First thing that I noticed was the new,
the uh, Jesus Christ. I'm stuttering here,

176
00:10:35,221 --> 00:10:39,360
the new design of the uh,
the cop pain. I'm like,

177
00:10:39,361 --> 00:10:42,750
what the fuck is that thing that's
like in the driver's line of sight.

178
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:47,520
And they got this new halo thing
that they got going on. Um,

179
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:51,120
I guess for a years since like 2010 or 11,
they've been trying to figure out,

180
00:10:51,121 --> 00:10:55,110
you know, cause it's the open
cockpit, people smashing into walls,

181
00:10:55,111 --> 00:10:58,110
tires and bolts go fly in. These
guys are driving, you know,

182
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:02,130
upwards of 100 fucking 80 miles an hour.
If you get hit with a screw, you know,

183
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:05,610
could go right through your helmet,
India fucking head. I don't know.

184
00:11:05,611 --> 00:11:09,390
They've been trying to figure out
how to protect them, you know,

185
00:11:09,391 --> 00:11:11,780
and then all everybody in the
crowd's like, well, hey man,

186
00:11:11,781 --> 00:11:14,880
don't put in like make it look like
a fighter jet man. We were like,

187
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,350
it's just always been open cockpit.
So everybody in the crowd,

188
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,140
you know, they want to
see, it's like, listen,

189
00:11:22,141 --> 00:11:25,530
if we're going to sit here along this
fucking fence and at any point a washer

190
00:11:25,531 --> 00:11:27,030
can come flying off the car,

191
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,870
go through my eye socket and into
the back of my brain. I mean,

192
00:11:30,871 --> 00:11:34,470
at least you could do is with your
fucking Alamut drive around in an open

193
00:11:34,471 --> 00:11:36,720
cockpit.
So they decided

194
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:42,990
to come up with this new design.
Uh, the halo cockpit picked design,

195
00:11:42,991 --> 00:11:46,140
which is supposed to, uh, it looks
like a giant piece of plastic to me.

196
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:49,800
It's probably made out of carbon fiber.
Um,

197
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:54,980
but evidently that will stop a tire
for smashing you in the fucking head.

198
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:01,310
And killing you. Nobody wants that,
right? I don't think so. So anyways,

199
00:12:01,311 --> 00:12:04,160
I saw at the beginning of
the race and as always,

200
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:08,250
Lewis Hamilton got the pole position,
it help

201
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:10,880
and uh,

202
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:15,710
the race starts and he gets
to the first corner first.

203
00:12:15,711 --> 00:12:19,370
So obviously he's going to win the
fucking race. That's how it works.

204
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:23,180
And even one of the announcers
stupidly said, well, you know,

205
00:12:23,181 --> 00:12:27,290
it history has shown that whoever wins
the first race of the year usually goes

206
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:29,190
on to win the championship.
That,

207
00:12:29,191 --> 00:12:33,320
I don't know if that was a comment on
how much lack of fucking passing there is

208
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:38,740
or the fact that basically Mercedes and
Ferrari have such superior engines that

209
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:45,420
you don't, nobody else can
compete with them. You know?

210
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:46,980
I mean,
I know other teams,

211
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:51,720
like the American team
Haas has Ferrari engines,

212
00:12:51,721 --> 00:12:56,100
but that's like their shit one.
Like they get the z 28 engine,

213
00:12:56,101 --> 00:12:59,680
we get the fucking rally sport,
um,

214
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,790
just for white trash people from the 70s.
Um,

215
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:08,700
so anyways, uh, I guess what happened?

216
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,460
Sebastian Vettel one,
the uh,

217
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:16,520
on the Australian Grand Prix for Ferrari
who went back to the Ferrari red or I

218
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:20,280
guess less white in their car.
The car is definitely look different,

219
00:13:20,281 --> 00:13:21,690
look like at different color red.
And I was like,

220
00:13:21,691 --> 00:13:26,400
there's no way that there's like a
specific read the Ferrari has to be,

221
00:13:26,401 --> 00:13:30,070
but it turns out they just had less
white in the car this year. Uh,

222
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:33,090
they went on to win it because,
um,

223
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:37,490
the Mercedes team I guess fucked up where,
uh,

224
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,210
Lewis Hamilton went into Pitt.

225
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,620
They thought they had enough space
between the fucking second place in first

226
00:13:43,621 --> 00:13:46,860
place. He was going to get out of
the pit first or something like that.

227
00:13:46,861 --> 00:13:49,770
I don't know what, oh no, he was out
on the track. I just saw the highlight.

228
00:13:49,771 --> 00:13:52,980
I don't fucking know. And they screwed
up, but you know, it's fucked up.

229
00:13:52,981 --> 00:13:54,540
They blamed their software.

230
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,700
So it's just like,
is there any sort of like,

231
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,050
I dunno,
racing going on.

232
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:08,730
So they've got some computers looking
where the fucking Sebastian Vettel's car

233
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:11,790
is in the pit and wow. How fast
they have to be going. What tar?

234
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,860
The off the computer figures,
all of that out.

235
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:18,570
You got an APP and every now lily the APP,
shit the bed.

236
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,970
And uh, that'll got out
first. And you know, Hamilton,

237
00:14:23,971 --> 00:14:28,230
he's always fucking sell cause it was, it
was a nickel. Who's, are you all right?

238
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:31,130
I love Hamilton, but he
gets so fucking, he, oh,

239
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:35,990
he just starts bleeding and
whenever he fucking lose, um,

240
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,740
I remember last year something happened
and qualifying and then he just sat in

241
00:14:40,741 --> 00:14:43,900
his car for like fucking
mean when,

242
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:46,410
when you were a kid and he got
mad at your parents or whatever,

243
00:14:46,411 --> 00:14:48,660
and they got out of the car, went in the
house, you're trying to make a point.

244
00:14:48,661 --> 00:14:53,090
You just sat in the car in the driveway.
They didn't give a shit to like, great.

245
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:58,130
How's, he'll be quiet without your
fucking complainant acid in here. Um,

246
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,870
so he ended up winning Ferrari
one. Sebastian Vettel came
in first, uh, a sulking.

247
00:15:02,871 --> 00:15:07,460
Lewis Hamilton came in second, Kimi
Reagan, and he didn't drive anybody off.

248
00:15:07,461 --> 00:15:12,200
The track came in third. And, uh,
Ricky Ricardo, Daniel Ricardo came in,

249
00:15:12,201 --> 00:15:13,034
uh,

250
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:18,190
the hometown favorite came in in
fourth place and what's his face fell.

251
00:15:18,191 --> 00:15:20,940
Terry Bolt. Haas, I guess he crashed,

252
00:15:20,941 --> 00:15:24,630
you're in qualifying and then was
given us five spot penalty for uh,

253
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,000
cause he changed a gearbox.

254
00:15:26,001 --> 00:15:28,790
He started in 15th and then
ended up finishing eighth.

255
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:33,791
But I think the real big story was how
well the USA team with the sh the sh the

256
00:15:34,821 --> 00:15:39,200
fucking Ferrari engine, that Ferrari
throughout in their back dumpster,

257
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:43,020
um, was fucking killing it
in the beginning. We will,

258
00:15:43,021 --> 00:15:45,050
I can fourth and sixth place at one point,

259
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:49,370
a part of the only part of the race that
I saw. And then, uh, I got all excited,

260
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,430
you know,
to look up to see where we finished.

261
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:56,030
We finished 19th and 20th with two,
not one,

262
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,340
but did not finish,

263
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,050
I guess.
Evidently

264
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:07,710
we know how to take the tire off,
but we don't know how to put it back on.

265
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:09,980
Okay.

266
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:14,530
Twice in the same race.
One of the hottest cars went in.

267
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:15,950
Okay.

268
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:20,780
To get their tire change their way.
They put the fuck guitars back on.

269
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:22,850
Three out of four were on but one wasn't.

270
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:28,840
They did that the first time and then the
fucking mechanic was screwed it up was

271
00:16:28,841 --> 00:16:30,850
hilarious.
They cut to the cut to the uh,

272
00:16:30,851 --> 00:16:33,850
the pit team and he just
walked out of the camera shop.

273
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:37,630
I think he went into the bathroom and
close the door and probably throw up that

274
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:41,200
he cost his team one of the cars,
you know, and then the fucking,

275
00:16:41,201 --> 00:16:44,130
then they turned around and
they did it again. But uh,

276
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:48,370
they're keeping their chin up
there saying, you know what?
Well Ah, you know, if uh,

277
00:16:48,371 --> 00:16:52,960
you know, just stick. What
would have happened if we
actually put the bolts back?

278
00:16:52,961 --> 00:16:53,794
God,

279
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:00,940
I'll tell you if Rorem Mercedes better
look out because we're going to be

280
00:17:00,941 --> 00:17:04,750
practicing how to take a tire on
and off when we get that down.

281
00:17:04,751 --> 00:17:09,751
I'm telling you things are going to be
real shook up and the a fourth to six

282
00:17:10,031 --> 00:17:14,100
positions this year. Yeah. Boy,

283
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:18,430
you know what it is. We're Americans.
We don't give a shit. Okay cause this,

284
00:17:18,431 --> 00:17:21,240
this whole fucking Duh left
turns and right turns the eye.

285
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,630
We have land over here,

286
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,850
fucking assholes in Europe and
everywhere else around the world.

287
00:17:27,851 --> 00:17:31,480
You're all fucking over populated,
driving around,

288
00:17:31,481 --> 00:17:35,830
fucking gone an old cow
paths. Um, that's all I got.

289
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:39,160
What else can I do? What do you
do when you completely screw up?

290
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,790
You know what you do?
You make fun of the rest of the world.

291
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:44,230
Okay.

292
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,270
It's exactly what you do.
All right,

293
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:50,780
let's get into some happier American
news to Bruins. Once again, were down.

294
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:54,500
They were down two to nothing
to the Goddamn Dallas Stars.

295
00:17:54,501 --> 00:17:59,501
So down in fucking Dallas now they
used to be the Minnesota north stars.

296
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:01,423
Okay.

297
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,960
And it was an eclectic group of incredibly
normal looking people in the crowd.

298
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:14,990
Okay. And, and the Minnesota
people. Nice people.

299
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:18,440
The kind of people you say hello to,
or if you Philly fans,

300
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,650
you throw full beers at.
Right.

301
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,460
Then they moved down to fucking Dallas.
Okay.

302
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,550
The fake teddy capital of the world.

303
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:31,400
Okay.

304
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,233
All right.
You know,

305
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,290
you know silicone valley out there where
they do all the fucking computer shit.

306
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:37,581
You know,

307
00:18:37,581 --> 00:18:41,090
an Apple's big fucking all look at our
round building with the forest in the

308
00:18:41,091 --> 00:18:43,500
middle of it.
Um,

309
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:48,140
that's where all the computer shit
happens down in Hollywood's where all the

310
00:18:48,141 --> 00:18:51,410
movies get made out in
Arizona is where they,

311
00:18:51,411 --> 00:18:56,330
they don't want to celebrate Martin Luther
King Day New Mexico's where they shop

312
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:01,100
breaking bad. And then you get
out to Dallas, Texas. Okay.

313
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:05,870
And you basically you have Dealey
plaza and you have fake titties that is

314
00:19:05,871 --> 00:19:06,710
fucking Dallas.

315
00:19:06,711 --> 00:19:11,711
And then you have a bunch of shiny four
door pickup trucks that has never seen a

316
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:14,630
day of blue collar work driving
around out there. I don't know why.

317
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:19,810
I don't know why you think and
they get them Cadillac. Um,

318
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:24,470
everybody's acting like they
got a ranch. Um, anyways,

319
00:19:24,471 --> 00:19:25,010
we went down,

320
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:29,570
then we played them and we were down two
to nothing and we score three goals and

321
00:19:29,571 --> 00:19:31,800
the third fucking period it was just,

322
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:36,050
and of course I missed the game
cause I got the kid now I was at,

323
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,840
I was at a birthday party,
a great birthday party.

324
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,870
We're now to a fucking farm and
all of that. Had an awesome time,

325
00:19:41,871 --> 00:19:44,420
but I didn't get to see the
game and I saw Tim shallows,

326
00:19:44,421 --> 00:19:48,350
fucking filthy shorthand
for nice feed from Brad.

327
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:53,351
My Sean Pasta had the game winner and
it seems even though you know Theresa

328
00:19:54,721 --> 00:19:57,830
version runs out with a broken foot,
I don't know if shower is back.

329
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:03,320
Last game I saw he fell the way I used
to fall when I was public at like a

330
00:20:03,321 --> 00:20:05,840
public skating rink.
You know what I mean?

331
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:10,250
Will you try to stop and then you catch
an edge and all of a sudden you go like

332
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:15,190
headfirst, do a face plant before
the board's mercifully stopped.

333
00:20:15,191 --> 00:20:19,070
You've usually knocked down like a five
year old trying to learn how to figure

334
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:23,120
skate. Uh, I'm trying to say we have a lot
of injuries but we're still winning. Ah,

335
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:24,320
the Celtics on the other hand,

336
00:20:24,321 --> 00:20:27,350
Kyrie Irving is going to
be out three to six weeks.

337
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:31,370
Sports illustrates website is
telling me I don't need to panic.

338
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:35,120
Toronto's going to get the number one
seed and we're probably going to play some

339
00:20:35,121 --> 00:20:38,600
shit bomb fucking team and he'll be back
by the end of it. I don't fucking know.

340
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,620
Uh, I think Toronto's looking
pretty strong. It's going
to be obviously Toronto.

341
00:20:42,621 --> 00:20:43,700
Cleveland.
When you think,

342
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:49,270
when you think and can Lebron put his
fucking team on his back once again. Okay.

343
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:53,770
And get to the finals again while the
entire basketball world shits on him and

344
00:20:53,771 --> 00:20:57,340
says how much he's an asshole and how
much I've never seen a guy achieve more

345
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:01,990
and get more shit. I just don't get it.
What more does he have to do our right,

346
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:04,990
he took his talents to south beach.
All right.

347
00:21:04,991 --> 00:21:08,830
He won two championships on a pile on
team, but then he went back to Cleveland,

348
00:21:08,831 --> 00:21:10,480
put the fucking team on his back

349
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:16,490
and beat the Golden State Warriors.
Right.

350
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,770
Right there.
It should have been over.

351
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,000
It was over for Steve Young when he
beat the fucking San Diego chargers.

352
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,793
Okay.

353
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:32,310
Whew. Whew. Whew. Was it chuck Humphreys?

354
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,230
Huge Humphreys.
Chuck Humphreys.

355
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:37,403
I don't remember

356
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,070
Pete.
That fucking team,

357
00:21:40,071 --> 00:21:44,540
one of the most boring super bowls there
ever was 49 is went out and they had

358
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:46,070
fucking white pants on and shit.

359
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:47,893
MMM.

360
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,200
And then the monkey's been off his back
and nobody ever fucking questioned him

361
00:21:52,201 --> 00:21:54,750
again.
Ever questioned him again.

362
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:59,040
Even after fucking spygate when he said
the Patriot should give up their three

363
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:01,080
fucking super bowl titles.

364
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:05,730
You know the fucking guys on TV,
he's in a hall of fame player.

365
00:22:05,731 --> 00:22:09,510
He didn't realize that that was a brand
new rule and the patriots work guilty,

366
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,000
but it was only illegal for one gay.

367
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:18,030
Nobody gave him shit yet. They
still give Lebron Shit. Why is that?

368
00:22:18,031 --> 00:22:19,590
Why do you think that is?

369
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:26,840
Is it because Steve Young
is a fucking moron? Um,

370
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,540
I have no idea. Anyways, so I
went to this birthday party,

371
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,220
a two year old's birthday party, some
friends of ours and there was this, uh,

372
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:36,560
went out to the speaking ranches.

373
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:41,610
We went out to this farm way
the fuck out towards Oxnard.

374
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:43,610
Came to Rio.

375
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,433
MMM.

376
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:50,470
It was awesome. It's part, you know,
part of Los Angeles. I very rarely go to,

377
00:22:50,471 --> 00:22:53,650
I fly over it, but I never
fucking actually went out there.

378
00:22:53,651 --> 00:22:57,820
It was absolutely beautiful out there,
past this fee me valley.

379
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:00,400
And they had all like
these animals and stuff.

380
00:23:00,401 --> 00:23:05,401
They're big animal farm and I realized
that I am a big fan of Al packers.

381
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,073
You know,

382
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:13,270
there was this brown one just with these
giant fucking brown eyes just looking

383
00:23:13,271 --> 00:23:18,100
at you. A little weird little wema
admittedly a little weird, you know,

384
00:23:18,101 --> 00:23:22,510
they kind of look like Lama's still
like better looking llamas, you know?

385
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:28,240
Um, potbelly pig, which I
never realized when people say,

386
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:31,120
I got, you know, you got a pot belly.
What an insult that is. I mean,

387
00:23:31,121 --> 00:23:35,150
these things were fat fucks.
That belly was,

388
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,940
was like on the ground.

389
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:38,923
MMM.

390
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,900
They just like, they just, they fucking
pigs. I mean, pigs really, our pigs,

391
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,120
they always talk about how smart
they are and that type of stuff.

392
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:53,070
I think the level that they eat and the
fact that they roll around in their own

393
00:23:53,071 --> 00:23:55,680
shit, it's just really hard
to see the intelligence.

394
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,220
You know what I mean?

395
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:03,220
I mean, I think a lot of fat
people get treated the same way.

396
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:08,130
Do you think if Albert
Einstein was a fat fuck, like

397
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,410
okay.

398
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:13,110
I Dunno. Rolling around in his own
shit. I mean, I don't think we,

399
00:24:13,111 --> 00:24:16,050
when World War Two, what do you
guys think? You care to comment?

400
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:20,110
Would you like to write into
the podcast about that one? Um,

401
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:22,140
I'm just filibustering here.

402
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:25,440
I got to get this shit done cause I got
all kinds of stuff to do today and I'm

403
00:24:25,441 --> 00:24:29,430
waiting for my advertising and my
questions to come in and got, dammit. Oh,

404
00:24:29,431 --> 00:24:34,170
the reeds is sent. Oh Shit.
Everything's fucking here. Ready to go.

405
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:39,660
I love it. All right, let's download
these. God Damn. Thanks. Um,

406
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:44,130
so anyways, we were at where?
Out there and uh, at that,

407
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:49,140
at the birthday party,
you got so fucked up about me.

408
00:24:49,141 --> 00:24:52,290
Loved to fuck all the birthday parties
stuff. I, first thing I did was alpacas.

409
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,790
I looked at those things and I'm like,
wow,

410
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:57,570
those things look like a food source
because they said they were from South

411
00:24:57,571 --> 00:24:57,990
America.

412
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:02,990
So all of that picturing
his boa constrictors and
God knows what kill on those

413
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:07,380
things, you know, or that
like the Komodo Dragon,

414
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:12,280
this time he sat this stock in this
giant bull looking thing and did,

415
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:15,690
did,
did those Komodo dragons,

416
00:25:15,691 --> 00:25:20,430
they have such fucking shit breath in
their mouth is so full of bacteria that if

417
00:25:20,431 --> 00:25:22,410
they all they to do,
it was just nick and owl.

418
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,750
An animal just did 10 times its size.

419
00:25:24,751 --> 00:25:29,460
It just need a bite it and then they just
followed around for three days is that

420
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:32,250
bacteria just slowly
fucking kills the thing.

421
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:37,830
I just wished the bull knew that the
second one was bit by that fucking dragon

422
00:25:37,831 --> 00:25:41,060
that it was over because then you just do,
you just turn around and blow.

423
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,510
You're not going to fucking eat me.

424
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,593
Yeah,

425
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:44,271
right.

426
00:25:44,271 --> 00:25:47,690
Just go over and kill the fucking thing
because the problem with those God damn

427
00:25:47,691 --> 00:25:51,850
reptiles and my issue with reptiles is
they don't have the Dan Chimpanzees,

428
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:54,350
they don't have the decency to kill
you before they start eat. Yeah,

429
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:55,930
yeah.

430
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:59,260
They don't know. Yeah. They don't
like that thing. Once you collapse,

431
00:25:59,261 --> 00:26:03,100
it just walks up. It has no
feeling whatsoever, you know,

432
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:09,030
which is why chimpanzees and human beings
are the worst chimpanzees and human

433
00:26:10,421 --> 00:26:10,750
beings.

434
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:15,100
The only people I've ever seen get off
on the suffering of something else.

435
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:18,270
Like it actually excites them.
I told you that.

436
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,650
I think I saw that thing one time
when they did for the longest time,

437
00:26:20,651 --> 00:26:24,730
they didn't think chimpanzees, monkeys,
eight other monkeys, they disapproved it.

438
00:26:24,731 --> 00:26:25,990
They found out it wasn't true.

439
00:26:25,991 --> 00:26:30,730
And I saw these fucking chimpanzees
catch this fucking smaller monkey.

440
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:32,070
All right.
And the,

441
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:36,370
he just stood on the thing's fucking back
and with his fingers was digging flesh

442
00:26:36,371 --> 00:26:38,620
out of its back as the
other monkeys screaming.

443
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:41,610
And the chip was getting off
on a sec, dude. Like, you know,

444
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,770
how fresh does it have to be?
Just snap.

445
00:26:43,771 --> 00:26:48,270
It's a little fucking neck and get
on with it. Um, and ever since then,

446
00:26:48,271 --> 00:26:52,950
I fucking hate chimpanzees.
I hate him.

447
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:58,080
I hate him as much as I
love, uh, uh, gorillas.

448
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:02,160
But having said that, I don't want to see
chimpanzees ever hurt though. You know,

449
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:03,120
I, I, you know,

450
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:08,580
although I wanted that bold to fucking
destroy that Komodo dragon has it just

451
00:27:08,581 --> 00:27:10,580
kept falling around,
you know,

452
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:14,340
like some damn bank or watching a
fucking farmer working himself to death,

453
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:17,910
waiting to take over the land to sell
to some other, fuck. All right, Bill,

454
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:22,940
let's not get that dramatic.
Okay. It's the wild. Get Mad
at God. You created it. Um,

455
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:26,160
it, well, I don't know if
it's a fucking lady or not

456
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:33,140
how fucked up, but human beings is,
is big pieces of shit that we are,

457
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:37,070
that uh,
we actually think God looks like us

458
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:45,440
and actually argue about
what it's races or it's sex.

459
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,600
It's the stupidest shit ever.

460
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:49,063
MMM.

461
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:53,340
Okay. Let me, uh, let me for the,

462
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:57,450
I have like 90 fucking window windows
open and I'm getting rid of all of these,

463
00:27:57,451 --> 00:28:00,840
except from my Brian Kest yoga videos.

464
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:06,780
I'm back into it. I'm taking my
power yogas watching these things.

465
00:28:06,781 --> 00:28:10,380
You know what's funny is I end case
anybody from his class, here's this,

466
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:14,550
I own all of his shit on VHS.
I just don't have a fucking VCR anymore.

467
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,440
So I have purchased the things,
but I just can't play him son.

468
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:22,770
I have to watch him on Youtube.
Um, all right. Where am I?

469
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:27,150
Where am I going here? I fucking,
is it ever on the right email?

470
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:33,060
Come on. You son of a bitch.
Why? Why, why, why, why? Why
are you doing this to me?

471
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:36,510
Loading as slow as humanly possible.
Do I have to hit pause?

472
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:39,693
All right,

473
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:45,280
my account. Sign out. Start over again.

474
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:48,813
There we go.

475
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:54,240
Come on. Open Up. Do you can do
it. All right. I'm hitting pause.

476
00:28:54,241 --> 00:28:59,160
This is pathetic. I'll wait.
It's coming up. Loading,

477
00:28:59,161 --> 00:29:01,470
loading, loading. People.

478
00:29:01,471 --> 00:29:05,550
Just try busy yourselves as I wait
for this fucking thing to open up. No,

479
00:29:05,551 --> 00:29:06,750
I don't want the APP.

480
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:09,733
Okay.

481
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:10,980
Oh my God.

482
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:11,850
Okay.

483
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:15,920
All right. Live reads. Here we are. Look
who's here? Everybody at Sarab friends.

00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,730
Yeah.
Okay.

486
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:26,880
Yeah. Talk about how important it
is to have the right employees.

487
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:28,980
I'll tell you right now.
You know,

488
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:33,150
the only thing worse to have a right
employees is the wrong employees.

489
00:29:33,151 --> 00:29:37,140
Like what are you doing? I Dunno.
I guess I'm the wrong guy. Hey,

490
00:29:37,141 --> 00:29:39,330
get the fuck out of here.
Wouldn't it be great?

491
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:43,190
Was this service that would help you
to stop picking the wrong employee?

492
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:47,480
You know what I mean? Do you hire some
person who comes in ready to work,

493
00:29:47,481 --> 00:29:49,730
you know, not showing up
with fuck me, pumps and tits,

494
00:29:49,731 --> 00:29:53,660
hanging out thinking that that's all
they got to do is just look good, right?

495
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:57,980
All ZipRecruiter knew

invites them to apply to your

499

but I'll tell you nothing gets
my freckled motor running.

518
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:25,770
Like seeing a man in a well tailored suit.
The confidence,

519
00:31:25,771 --> 00:31:28,020
the way the jacket blows in the breeze.

the fuck I was looking for. God dammit.

543
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:58,590
Hey, speaking of that, am I in
a Tulsa, Oklahoma this weekend?

544
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:02,640
Speaking of southern accents?
Margaret, I'll be down.

545
00:33:02,641 --> 00:33:06,990
There are no over there in Tulsa,
Oklahoma. The Braden theater.

546
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:11,100
Yes, I am March 30th Oh my
God. I love it. What's today?

547
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:16,110
Today's the 26 let's see here.
That's Thursday.

548
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:19,940
No, Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday. So this,

549
00:33:19,941 --> 00:33:24,600
say I'm going to be, um,
at the Brady theater,

550
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:29,730
Tulsa, Oklahoma. And then on March 31st
I'm going to be down in San Antonio,

551
00:33:29,731 --> 00:33:30,600
Texas,
right?

552
00:33:30,601 --> 00:33:35,601
They're stars at night are big and
bright deep in the heart of Texas.

553
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:40,020
What do they have their,
what do they call that thing?

554
00:33:40,021 --> 00:33:43,920
That little fucking river
that the river walk.

555
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:47,070
It's actually really relaxing,
you know,

556
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:51,490
and then you don't really ever
have to get off and buy anything.

557
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:55,530
You just fucking sitting there floating
around on a God damn boat. Okay.

558
00:33:56,130 --> 00:34:00,360
That's gonna be one of those weird
flights where like it should only take me

559
00:34:00,361 --> 00:34:02,310
like an hour to go from fucking Tulsa,

560
00:34:02,311 --> 00:34:05,640
Oklahoma or 90 minutes to San Antonio.

561
00:34:05,641 --> 00:34:07,770
But it's going to take the whole fucking
day cause they don't have to like

562
00:34:07,771 --> 00:34:12,380
connect through like Denver or some shit.
Um,

563
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,771
speaking of what she,

564
00:34:13,771 --> 00:34:17,940
I got some shows coming up in Pittsburgh
April 6th and for whatever fucking

565
00:34:17,941 --> 00:34:22,470
reason, the only direct flight I could
get out of La is a southwest flight.

566
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,830
I don't understand Philly and
Pittsburgh back in the day.

567
00:34:28,831 --> 00:34:33,780
The only direct flight from
La to Philly was on u s air.

568
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,460
I don't mind. I don't mind southwest
Linda till they start telling the jokes,

569
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:44,100
you know, and just fucking, it's so God
damn obnoxious because nobody heckles him.

570
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:48,480
That's what's missing on a
southwest flight. Boeing,

571
00:34:48,481 --> 00:34:51,510
the jokes,
you have such a captive audience.

572
00:34:51,511 --> 00:34:55,110
Everybody's afraid we're going to crash.
You know,

573
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:59,520
for some reason you think the steward or
the store it is actually is flying the

574
00:34:59,521 --> 00:35:02,130
plane so you don't want to give him shit.
Right.

575
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:07,820
Oh God. That's what I
wish I, you know, Patrice,

576
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:11,400
I could just fucking see him and that
if he ever saw what those fucking people

577
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:12,234
per character,

578
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,213
okay.

579
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,433
He would have heckled.

580
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:18,630
Okay.

581
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:20,700
Hey, he definitely would
have fucking happened. Um,

582
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:27,310
I just sit there stewing and anger and
not even mad at the fucking steward or

583
00:35:27,311 --> 00:35:30,460
stewardess is, which I
still call them, by the way.

584
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:35,410
I don't understand how the fuck that ever
became offensive. You know what I mean?

585
00:35:35,411 --> 00:35:37,090
Or they feel like steward had

586
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,173
mmm.

587
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,480
Like, I don't know, come up to it.

588
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:49,760
Why is, I mean, look this up, why is

589
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:54,740
Stuart is offensive?

590
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,900
I might be wrong.
Here's why.

591
00:35:57,901 --> 00:36:01,950
Flight attendants don't like
being called stewardesses.

592
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:09,370
All right. Flight attendants. Oh man,
they got an old fucking school one.

593
00:36:09,371 --> 00:36:11,560
Look how hot they used to be.

594
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:17,440
I swear to God, they must have
fucking drop the pay dramatically.

595
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:22,600
I Dunno what they used to be.
Fucking gorgeous. Unbelievable.

596
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:28,360
All right. Flight, but the food was way
worse. There's always a tradeoff, right?

597
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,033
Um,

598
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:34,840
flight attendants have a job that holds
a lot of prestige in the eyes of most

599
00:36:34,841 --> 00:36:37,140
travelers.
Y and w what?

600
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:42,160
There's a giant vague bullshit statement.

601
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,100
I think that used to be when the,
when they were beautiful women,

602
00:36:45,101 --> 00:36:46,930
it seemed glamorous.
The whole thing.

603
00:36:46,931 --> 00:36:50,590
The pilot seemed like a
fucking borderline James Bond.

604
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:54,040
There's all these sexy women
fucking walking around like wow,

605
00:36:54,041 --> 00:36:57,400
they get to go to all of these places
before everybody flew her all the time.

606
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,713
MMM.

607
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,260
People you actually used to dress up when
they went on planes wearing suits and

608
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:08,850
women get all dolled up and shit.
You know,

609
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:11,100
this is before they treated you
like a fucking animal though.

610
00:37:11,101 --> 00:37:12,930
Then they started treating
everybody like animals.

611
00:37:12,931 --> 00:37:17,190
Now people walk in and on that, getting
the borderline pajamas. Anyways,

612
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:21,300
they get called a lot of different things
while doing their jobs. Waitress, ma'am?

613
00:37:21,301 --> 00:37:21,661
Hey,

614
00:37:21,661 --> 00:37:26,340
you miss air hostess and Trolley Dolly.

615
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:31,200
Okay. You know what? I have well over a
million fucking a frequent flier miles.

616
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:35,880
I've never heard anybody say
waitress. No one's ever said, hey,

617
00:37:35,881 --> 00:37:40,260
you air hostess.
Hey Trolley Dolly,

618
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:44,820
get I get a fucking drag. C'Mon. I'm
sure everybody has a story, but come on.

619
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,500
I think pretty much everybody's been
respectful as certainly after nine 11,

620
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:54,100
because then all the stewards and
stewardesses, all they have to say is, uh,

621
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:58,620
why are you being hostile? Do
you not want to fly today? Uh,

622
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:04,080
anyway, some flight attendants
have a job then Obama. Okay. Uh,

623
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:06,660
but one moniker that is
pretty much gone out.

624
00:38:06,661 --> 00:38:10,650
The emergency exit door is stewardess.
And here's why I love it.

625
00:38:10,651 --> 00:38:15,090
This person just made up all of this
other shit waitress, ma'am. Hey you

626
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:21,490
trolley Dolly just made up all of that
shit so they could get to this stewardess

627
00:38:22,131 --> 00:38:22,964
part.
All right.

628
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:28,120
I think it's safe to say that a strip
tease ad for an airline like this one from

629
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:32,390
Braniff international airways
below would not fly today. Yeah.

630
00:38:32,391 --> 00:38:36,850
A lot of things from back then wouldn't
fly today. Uh, at least not in America.

631
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:42,250
Oh, look at that. Um, but this type of ad,

632
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:45,880
which most would now consider
objectifying towards women.

633
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:47,790
Okay.

634
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:49,980
Was the only way to go in

635
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:56,040
the sex cells day. Okay. Sorry. I was
thinking about clicking on the video.

636
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:56,771
I was doing the math,

637
00:38:56,771 --> 00:38:59,890
whether I could do that and not get in
trouble because I'm advertising on this,

638
00:38:59,891 --> 00:39:02,220
sorry. Let me go back to
trying to read this. Uh,

639
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:06,640
was the only way to go in the sex cells
day of the early jet age. Oh yeah.

640
00:39:06,641 --> 00:39:09,190
Because they don't use sex
to sell anything anymore.

641
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:14,390
A brand Braniff was hugely
popular in its heyday. Uh,

642
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:18,550
their flight attendants war psychedelic
trends from some are fashions top

643
00:39:18,551 --> 00:39:20,680
designers such as

644
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:26,730
Emilio Pucci. Oh, he fell off on a murder.

645
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:30,620
That fucking Guy Pacific southwest
airlines was another airline average.

646
00:39:30,621 --> 00:39:34,360
I'm going to watch this fucking video.
Let's see what's going on here. Uh,

647
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:39,520
Pacific salesforce airlines was another
airline press start to play with color

648
00:39:39,651 --> 00:39:41,000
course advertising.

649
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:45,560
And it's a bunch of sexy women winking
at me and all this using sex to sell.

650
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:47,400
Okay.

651
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,810
In 2018.

652
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:50,250
Yeah.

653
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:54,140
What is going on here?
It's just another ad.

654
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:57,680
This is an ad for Disneyland. Oh,
you know what? Go Fuck Yourself.

655
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:03,640
Fuck this video.
Is this just clickbait?

656
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:06,400
Is that what I've done here?
Um,

657
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:08,703
yeah.

658
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,430
Was it another and can I
tell you something right now?

659
00:40:10,431 --> 00:40:13,520
I guarantee you all these fucking
hotties that were on this airline,

660
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,340
they weren't the ones that bitched.

661
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:17,810
It was ugly women that couldn't
get the fucking job. I can,

662
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:21,830
I'm so sick of like this certain jobs,
you should just be good. Lucky. Okay.

663
00:40:21,831 --> 00:40:26,450
And as a fucking, uh, unsightly human
being, I feel like I can say this shit,

664
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:27,373
right?

665
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:28,920
Yeah.

666
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:33,190
Yeah. Like you walk into a restaurant,
you want to see somebody good looking,

667
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:34,420
okay.

668
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:38,090
You know, hotel, gym,

669
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:40,880
all of that Shit,
this fucking thing.

670
00:40:40,881 --> 00:40:45,200
Now that you don't have to be good
looking and you can be like a, you know,

671
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:50,090
overweight and all of that stuff is,
that's really not helping out fat people.

672
00:40:50,091 --> 00:40:52,190
I can tell you that yes,
they're getting a job,

673
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:57,340
but there's still eating their way to a
fucking early grave who doesn't want to

674
00:40:57,351 --> 00:41:01,550
live. It's sort of what you're doing
is as much as you're giving them a job,

675
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:06,290
you're also in this roundabout way in
kind of doing this assisted suicide,

676
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:10,280
you kind of a part of it,
right? In a food sense.

677
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:15,410
I don't know what I'm talking about,
but I'm going to continue speaking. Um,

678
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:19,430
Pacific southwest airlines was another
airline that advertise the attractiveness

679
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:24,350
of its flight attendance. They introduced
the miniskirt 1965 in our book,

680
00:41:24,351 --> 00:41:28,940
long legs and short nights
form a PSA flight attendant,

681
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:33,890
Maryland trips said they used to
be a distinction between flight and

682
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:34,581
stewardesses.

683
00:41:34,581 --> 00:41:39,470
Flight attendants were there for safety
while stewardesses were there to be eye

684
00:41:39,471 --> 00:41:43,910
candy. Flirt and serve
drinks. Yeah, that's your job.

685
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:49,220
The pilot passes out.
Do you know how to fly to fucking plane?

686
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:54,120
Well then start waking at
people. This sweetheart, um,

687
00:41:55,190 --> 00:42:00,190
she noted stewardesses were not allowed
to do pa announcements because nobody

688
00:42:00,321 --> 00:42:05,030
could understand, okay, this is getting
a little weird, therefore, let's face it.

689
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:08,660
They were deep. They were along for the
ride. Now they weren't. They were like,

690
00:42:08,661 --> 00:42:11,030
they were serving drinks.
Maryland,

691
00:42:11,031 --> 00:42:15,770
trich Schwartz contacted me to let me
know that I had misunderstood a quote and

692
00:42:15,771 --> 00:42:18,920
there was not a distinction between
stewardesses in flight attendants.

693
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:23,330
They merely changed the job titles
once more men joined the industry.

694
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:28,830
Yeah. These were called stewards when
she referred to stewardesses as they,

695
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:30,480
because she was one herself.

696
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:33,350
I misinterpreted that to mean that
there were actually two different jobs.

697
00:42:33,351 --> 00:42:36,030
So this guy really doesn't know what the
fuck he's talking about. Oh, this woman,

698
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,313
okay,

699
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:41,560
what am I reading here? I don't even
know many modern and dare I say,

700
00:42:41,561 --> 00:42:46,240
older flight attendants now considered
stewardess a derogatory term toward their

701
00:42:46,241 --> 00:42:50,860
profession and even their personal
virtue because they take their job more

702
00:42:50,861 --> 00:42:53,290
seriously.
That being there is simply too

703
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:54,510
okay

704
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:58,750
to serve as eye candy. All right. Uh,

705
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,810
I'm done with this fucking article.
All right.

706
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:05,120
I learned absolutely nothing other than
the astounding lack of fucking research.

707
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:09,050
I mean,
I thought only I did that on my podcast,

708
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:13,430
this fucking person and like he literally
his article rather than going back and

709
00:43:13,431 --> 00:43:16,700
correcting it, he's fucking
correct. And himself,

710
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:19,700
like he writes the article out
and I realized I fucked up.

711
00:43:19,701 --> 00:43:21,020
But he's just continuing on.

712
00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:30,470
Yeah. I mean at the, at the end of
the fucking day, like this is just,

713
00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:33,490
I think what really fucking happened,

714
00:43:33,491 --> 00:43:36,980
it was flying back then was glamorous.

715
00:43:38,330 --> 00:43:43,160
Okay. It was way more glamorous. She got
treated way more. It was considered an,

716
00:43:43,161 --> 00:43:45,710
an an an an an amazing luxury.

717
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:47,110
Okay.

718
00:43:47,110 --> 00:43:51,940
To be able to fly now everybody, everybody
fucking flies. They Jamey in the back,

719
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,970
you know,
you have to pay for food.

720
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,110
Okay.

721
00:43:57,110 --> 00:44:00,080
I mean, back then it was like
coffee tea or me was, was,

722
00:44:00,081 --> 00:44:02,870
that was basically the,
uh,

723
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:04,180
okay.

724
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:07,900
The vibe back debt, you know what
I mean? And they're acting like,

725
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:10,060
okay,

726
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:13,120
I dunno. I Dunno what they're active,
they're, they're acting like a, the

727
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,490
that, that there weren't some fucking
women that that was an appealing job to

728
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:22,340
not everybody has a dream.

729
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:26,610
Okay.

730
00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:28,140
That's, you know, something that's,

731
00:44:28,141 --> 00:44:32,580
maybe that's what's going on right now
was fucking all of the medias is that

732
00:44:32,581 --> 00:44:36,810
everybody's acting like they're fucking
Joe Montana. You know what I mean?

733
00:44:36,811 --> 00:44:38,180
That they're like an Oscar winner.

734
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:42,240
It's just most of us would
just put background. That's it.

735
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:45,860
Where that guy in the fucking
middle seat staring at the cell,

736
00:44:45,861 --> 00:44:47,670
a woman serving them peanuts,

737
00:44:47,671 --> 00:44:50,850
that is way out of their league that
you'd never have the balls to talk to.

738
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:55,980
Not now. Everybody's a
winner. According to Oprah.

739
00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:59,400
You could do whatever you want.
It's going to be great.

740
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:03,000
All your dreams are gonna come true.
Nobody's going to try to steal your ideas.

741
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:04,970
There's plenty of room for everybody.

742
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,000
Top of the mountain.

743
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,820
I, that's just not the
case. I hate to say that.

744
00:45:11,821 --> 00:45:14,670
If just go out and look at a mountain,
just look at the shape of this.

745
00:45:14,671 --> 00:45:18,090
Plenty of room down the
bottom. There is a, you know,

746
00:45:18,091 --> 00:45:20,610
there's less but still a
lot of room in the middle.

747
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:24,870
But as you keep going higher and
higher, you know, I don't know.

748
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:28,470
I don't even know what I'm talking about.
I still don't understand why.

749
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:29,670
So basically,

750
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:31,770
yeah.

751
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:35,290
Flight attendants wanted to distill,

752
00:45:35,310 --> 00:45:37,260
still doing the same fucking job.

753
00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:43,840
I Dunno. Maybe now they, they actually
know CPR or some shit like that,

754
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:47,140
that took a couple of Mas classes.

755
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:48,870
Yeah.

756
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:51,590
Um, but you know, what are they,
what are they going to tell him?

757
00:45:51,610 --> 00:45:52,850
You know what I mean? I mean, if, if,

758
00:45:52,851 --> 00:45:55,140
if like some terrorists
go to take over the plane,

759
00:45:55,141 --> 00:45:57,870
do they also have like Chinese stars
that they're allowed to bring onto the

760
00:45:57,871 --> 00:45:58,704
fucking plane?

761
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:00,080
Okay.

762
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:04,030
Um, plead people, I don't want
to be called a comedian anymore.

763
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:08,980
I think that's offensive because people
just feel like I'm going to have a

764
00:46:08,981 --> 00:46:13,360
lampshade on my head.
I would now like to be called a,

765
00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:16,360
uh,
a humor doctor,

766
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:21,360
doctor humor something, or
I'll come up with it. I don't,

767
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:26,350
I don't want to, um, I think it's very
sexist. It's be called the comedian.

768
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:29,093
MMM.

769
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:35,060
I don't know why. And you know, other
languages have male and female things.

770
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:37,150
So I think that's the thing.
I'm in my business to comedian,

771
00:46:37,151 --> 00:46:41,570
they want to be called a comedian. We
have a community and coming to the stage,

772
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,880
look, why do you have to
just make a distinction?

773
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:50,290
I don't know why. I don't know. I
don't know. I don't know. I'm just,

774
00:46:50,291 --> 00:46:52,670
can we get a gender neutral microphone?
It was out there.

775
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:53,710
That's probably gonna be the next thing.

776
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:59,280
Maybe that microphones are shaped
too much. Like dicks. They get

777
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:03,480
above like a hermaphrodite style one.

778
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:08,020
You can have like a dick coming
out of vagina. Uh, you know,

779
00:47:08,021 --> 00:47:10,330
something maybe like
those old school Elvis.

780
00:47:10,331 --> 00:47:14,080
Once you get to have that and just bad,
like,

781
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:17,500
I don't know what you speak into.
Looks like a clip. I don't know.

782
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:21,820
Is this technically even
like still a podcast?

783
00:47:21,850 --> 00:47:25,630
Let me just get to the questions this
week that went nowhere, by the way.

784
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:28,760
And I know a lot of it was ignorant and,
uh,

785
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:33,210
I think I stand by it. Um, all
right, let's get to the, uh,

786
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:37,390
let's get to the questions here.
Jesus fucking Christ.

787
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:39,540
Yeah.

788
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:40,500
Become a pilot.

789
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:41,600
Okay.

790
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:46,230
You know, do that then become a pilot.

791
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:50,640
Run an airline. You want respect
to them. Okay. You fucking do that.

792
00:47:50,641 --> 00:47:51,480
These P he's bullies.

793
00:47:51,481 --> 00:47:54,990
People on special teams all of a sudden
want to be treated like quarterbacks. I,

794
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:57,900
it's just, you're not
a quarterback. Sorry.

795
00:47:59,970 --> 00:48:02,190
Um,
oh shit.

796
00:48:02,191 --> 00:48:07,191
The all things comedy festival is
coming back again this year and uh,

797
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:12,720
it's going to be a Comerica theater
in Phoenix, Arizona and October 26,

798
00:48:12,721 --> 00:48:16,660
Jesus Christ. Get your tickets
early at ticket master. Uh,

799
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:18,060
the Presale is Wednesday,

800
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:22,440
March 28th at 10:00 AM

801
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:26,830
March 30th at 10:00 AM local
time. Both for both of those. Uh,

802
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:32,600
and I will be posting the link on my
Twitter and my Instagram and my Facebook.

803
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:37,710
Just an internet. Dushoney alright,
Mr. Rogers movie. Oh, I love it.

804
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:42,750
It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood.
A Beautiful Day in the neighborhood.

805
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:46,610
Would you be mine? Could you
be mine? I have always wanted,

806
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:49,590
I can't believe I remember this.
Have our neighbor just like you.

807
00:48:49,770 --> 00:48:53,220
I've always wanted to live in
their neighborhood with you.

808
00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:57,270
So let's make the most
of this beautiful day.

809
00:48:58,890 --> 00:49:02,790
Don't call them stewardesses
and don't say, hey,

810
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:08,190
columns, flight attendants make it
seem like they have a master's degree.

811
00:49:09,090 --> 00:49:11,670
Would you like some fucking peanuts?

812
00:49:11,671 --> 00:49:16,620
You will respect me and my slacks.
Hello,

813
00:49:16,621 --> 00:49:19,860
Mr Neighbors. Uh, Mr. Rogers
movie. Hey there, bill,

814
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,510
I'm writing to you here from Minneapolis
and very much looking forward to your

815
00:49:24,511 --> 00:49:28,500
upcoming show here. You know,
back when I was a kid, you know,

816
00:49:28,501 --> 00:49:31,380
getting treated like shit
motivated you to get a better job,

817
00:49:32,370 --> 00:49:33,450
not demand that your,

818
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:37,680
you fucking be treated with respect at
the low level that you had attained in

819
00:49:37,681 --> 00:49:40,110
the job world.
Anyway,

820
00:49:40,111 --> 00:49:44,100
I was wondering if you heard about
the movie being made about Mr. Rogers

821
00:49:44,101 --> 00:49:47,700
starring Tom Hanks is Fred Rogers.
Coincidentally,

822
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:52,230
a movie trailer was also just released
for a new documentary about Fred Rogers

823
00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:55,020
that just premiered at
Sundance and it looks awesome.

824
00:49:55,290 --> 00:49:59,700
I grew up watching Mr. Rogers as a kid
and it's really refreshing to look back

825
00:49:59,701 --> 00:50:03,750
at some of the clips that show what
a great one of a kind person he was.

826
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:07,110
Did you grow up watching Mr.
RogersRogers' neighborhood? Yes, I did.

827
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:11,040
Mister McFeely speedy delivery.
And if so,

828
00:50:11,070 --> 00:50:14,370
what were your thoughts about
them making a movie about him?

829
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:19,550
Maybe you have a different perspective
now that you have a kid because it seems

830
00:50:19,951 --> 00:50:23,970
like there's so much awful shit that kids
are exposed to on TV and the Internet.

831
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:26,040
And Mr. Rogers was a rare TV show,

832
00:50:26,041 --> 00:50:30,130
which actually helps kids to become
better human beings. Last but not least,

833
00:50:30,131 --> 00:50:34,090
would you consider auditioning
for this shows? Longtime guests?

834
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:35,530
Mister McFeely?

835
00:50:35,531 --> 00:50:39,820
I think you'd look hilarious and that
mailman hat and when with the spectacles

836
00:50:39,821 --> 00:50:43,920
and the mustache, thanks for being a
great neighbor and go fuck yourself. Ah,

837
00:50:43,921 --> 00:50:48,160
I absolutely would play mister McFeely.
Um,

838
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:54,070
I loved, I loved Mr. Rogers when I was
a kid. I like sesame street better.

839
00:50:54,790 --> 00:50:55,623
Um,

840
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:59,920
and there was something about him that
did make me a little uncomfortable when I

841
00:50:59,921 --> 00:51:01,840
was a kid. I will admit
that. No, you know what?

842
00:51:01,841 --> 00:51:05,800
I didn't like lady Elaine and King Friday.

843
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:10,800
I liked the trolley when
it went into the uh,

844
00:51:10,930 --> 00:51:13,840
the make believe land or whatever.
But um,

845
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:18,260
I dunno, Lady Lane and, and King Friday,

846
00:51:18,261 --> 00:51:20,120
they just used to make
me sick to my stomach.

847
00:51:21,310 --> 00:51:21,710
Yeah.

848
00:51:21,710 --> 00:51:25,730
They just weren't as funny and they didn't
have the personality of like Ernie or

849
00:51:25,731 --> 00:51:29,720
Grover Harry the cookie monster.
I mean,

850
00:51:29,721 --> 00:51:34,721
there was just those who liked the guys
guys have puppets over there on sesame

851
00:51:34,911 --> 00:51:38,240
street. I just thought it Mr.
RogersRogers' neighborhood was,

852
00:51:38,241 --> 00:51:41,980
it was just a little stiff. But um, I've,

853
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,420
I imagined that I learned
a bunch of great lessons.

854
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,010
I was too young to understand like,
oh,

855
00:51:46,011 --> 00:51:48,680
this guy's trying to teach me how
to be a better person. You know,

856
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:51,470
it was just a kid watching the shit go.

857
00:51:51,471 --> 00:51:54,410
Wouldn't that be cool if we had a trolley
in our house and then he could get on

858
00:51:54,411 --> 00:51:59,411
it and it go to a magical neighborhood
and avoid king Friday and Lady Elaine,

859
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:04,220
she was fucking weird looking
to right I to look this up here,

860
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:10,690
lady Elaine Lady Lady.

861
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:17,590
How do you spell a lane? Oh yeah. Yeah.

862
00:52:17,591 --> 00:52:20,420
She was ugly. Is there, what
does my God lay off the Booze

863
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:24,420
Lady Lane Fairchild.
I never knew.

864
00:52:24,421 --> 00:52:26,860
The last name is a neighborhood
and mischief maker.

865
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:29,950
And having learned from
the wizard of loophole,

866
00:52:29,951 --> 00:52:34,810
which often uses or boomerang tumor
Marangu summa rang. Oh my God,

867
00:52:34,811 --> 00:52:35,621
I forgot about that.

868
00:52:35,621 --> 00:52:39,280
To do things such as rearranged the
neighborhood or turn it upside down.

869
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:43,060
She's credited with the discovery
of planet purple, purple,

870
00:52:43,061 --> 00:52:45,400
which she found while flying
in or something or other.

871
00:52:47,770 --> 00:52:52,180
Well, you know, that would never happen.
Now that would be considered sexist. Oh,

872
00:52:52,181 --> 00:52:56,680
why? Why does the woman have
to be the bad person? Well,

873
00:52:56,681 --> 00:53:01,330
she's in a position of power. Isn't
that enough? No. Ah, what are you doing?

874
00:53:01,331 --> 00:53:06,030
Come on. Um, alright. Do I,

875
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:10,780
I, I think Tom Hanks is going to do
a great job because he always does.

876
00:53:11,530 --> 00:53:11,771
You know,

877
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:14,320
you look how we just said that like he's
an up and coming actor rather than the

878
00:53:14,321 --> 00:53:17,620
two times back to back.
Best actor.

879
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:22,630
Um, do I call him an actress
now? Is that progressive?

880
00:53:23,850 --> 00:53:27,330
Should I not identify by his gender? I
don't fucking know. I don't know. I don't,

881
00:53:27,331 --> 00:53:30,820
I don't know what, what
to do right now. Uh,

882
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:33,770
I think it'd be interesting if they
actually get into his, his whole life,

883
00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:39,150
you know? But if it's just Tom Hanks
doing an episode of Mr. Rogers and then,

884
00:53:40,770 --> 00:53:44,520
I dunno. I Dunno what the, I don't
fucking know. I watch sports.

885
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:48,300
Why would you ask me about movies? All
right. Linkedin business APP. Dear Billy,

886
00:53:48,301 --> 00:53:49,134
balloon head.

887
00:53:52,830 --> 00:53:56,610
My girlfriend and I had been together,
his girlfriend, one or two words.

888
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:01,380
There was two, one word. My girlfriend
and I have been together for a year.

889
00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:04,410
For the past two months.
She's been out of work.

890
00:54:06,050 --> 00:54:09,830
So two months. It has been using
this business app to get work online.

891
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:15,030
It has never bothered me as of revenue.

892
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:17,730
I think you said recently

893
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:23,200
as of Raven reverently me,

894
00:54:23,201 --> 00:54:26,050
she has been getting
notifications from the APP.

895
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:29,950
I don't know what any of that means.
I didn't think anything of it,

896
00:54:29,951 --> 00:54:34,080
but I noticed that she had gotten a
message in the middle of the night. Oh,

897
00:54:34,090 --> 00:54:38,050
as of recently.
This is a voice text.

898
00:54:38,490 --> 00:54:41,500
Reverently reverently me as of recently,

899
00:54:41,501 --> 00:54:45,760
she has been getting notifications from
the APP. I didn't think anything of it.

900
00:54:47,630 --> 00:54:51,590
Um, but I've noticed that
she has gotten messages,

901
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:53,390
gotten a message in the
middle of the night.

902
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:57,500
I asked her about it and she always tells
me that it's strictly professional and

903
00:54:57,501 --> 00:55:00,860
that is just business
men seeking to employ.

904
00:55:01,070 --> 00:55:04,370
Do you think that APP is just
a cover up for meeting men?

905
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:07,040
She would meet on apps like Tinder.

906
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:13,730
Um, I don't know dude, but it doesn't
sound like you fucking trust your, uh,

907
00:55:13,731 --> 00:55:17,780
your girlfriend, which is definitely
an issue. So what you have done,

908
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:22,010
you have to figure out as if you don't
trust her because she got saying she

909
00:55:22,011 --> 00:55:23,660
shady or is it some,

910
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:27,530
some of your own shit that you brought
because of a previous relationship or

911
00:55:27,531 --> 00:55:29,090
possibly something that happened?

912
00:55:29,091 --> 00:55:31,940
She was a child when you
were watching Mr. Rogers

913
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:38,540
calling women's stewardesses.
Um,

914
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:40,210
okay.

915
00:55:40,210 --> 00:55:44,230
I Dunno. It's possible women are
really good at fucking around,

916
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:48,730
which is why they don't get caught
as much as guys do. Guys, you know,

917
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:52,690
guys are the worst. You know,
we just fucking, we get caught.

918
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:59,980
Um, anyways he wants, I dunno, I
dunno what to tell you to do there.

919
00:56:01,230 --> 00:56:01,700
Okay,

920
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:05,330
so now you got to start snooping and
then if you get caught in you're wrong,

921
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:08,090
then what?
Where does that leave you

922
00:56:11,470 --> 00:56:15,820
just tell her it's making you feel
insecure and you would just, can you just,

923
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:17,320
you know,
and it's your issue.

924
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:22,600
Can you just see one of the texts next
time it happens and then just say,

925
00:56:22,601 --> 00:56:24,570
sorry,
I dunno,

926
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:27,900
I just love these sub black and I was
worried that somebody else was still a

927
00:56:27,901 --> 00:56:32,460
year. Passions. Talk your way out of it
that way. Does that work? I don't know.

928
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:36,620
This is not professional advice.
He wants to get married. I don't,

929
00:56:37,290 --> 00:56:41,490
I hate built your fountain of Cynical
Humor and knowledge that I've admired for

930
00:56:41,491 --> 00:56:44,850
years. Yo, you are a
fountain of Jesus Christ.

931
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:48,720
So I wanted to ask some advice. Hey,
this is not professional advice.

932
00:56:48,721 --> 00:56:52,470
My boyfriend proposed two
years ago after I said yes.

933
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:56,670
He said he wanted to keep it a secret
since he hadn't met my parents yet,

934
00:56:57,090 --> 00:56:58,830
except via Skype calls.

935
00:56:59,070 --> 00:57:04,020
They live across the country by parents
kept canceling their plans to visit last

936
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:04,020
minute.

937
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:08,100
So he planned to visit them for this
past Christmas where he would publicly

938
00:57:08,101 --> 00:57:11,970
propose Jesus.
Chris is the longest proposal ever.

939
00:57:12,450 --> 00:57:15,600
I kept this a secret for two years.
We only had two fights,

940
00:57:15,601 --> 00:57:17,730
but each time he broke off the engagement,

941
00:57:17,731 --> 00:57:21,720
only do apologize and make up the
next day. One month prior to the trip,

942
00:57:21,721 --> 00:57:26,280
he says he wants to postpone proposing
due to finances since we will be moving

943
00:57:26,281 --> 00:57:30,930
to another state after I
graduate. I understand. Uh,

944
00:57:30,931 --> 00:57:35,430
why spend five grand on a wedding when
we'll soon need that to get a house while

945
00:57:35,431 --> 00:57:36,810
the next day he admitted.

946
00:57:36,811 --> 00:57:41,811
The other reason is because I had gained
weight after getting on birth control

947
00:57:42,001 --> 00:57:44,460
and anxiety met. Yeah, you fuck this guy?

948
00:57:45,810 --> 00:57:46,270
Okay,

949
00:57:46,270 --> 00:57:50,710
I'm getting a Master's in
physics and have a part time job.

950
00:57:50,711 --> 00:57:54,710
So sorry if I couldn't hit the gym
enough. Uh, well that's no excuse.

951
00:57:54,711 --> 00:57:57,700
She should also fucking eat well. And
I'm not saying that about him and your,

952
00:57:57,770 --> 00:58:01,250
your relationship would do
it for yourself because uh,

953
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:06,380
you really do not want the health issues
that fucking start earliest in your

954
00:58:08,351 --> 00:58:11,370
late thirties and your forties.
Um,

955
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:12,710
okay.

956
00:58:12,710 --> 00:58:13,190
You know,

957
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:16,790
I've lost friends to heart attack set
look like they're in the same shape as me,

958
00:58:16,791 --> 00:58:21,230
but I dunno, you got to get checked
up. Um, just cause you're busy.

959
00:58:21,231 --> 00:58:21,951
This is what you do.

960
00:58:21,951 --> 00:58:24,530
You're fucking cook all your food
on the weekend and that you get,

961
00:58:24,531 --> 00:58:29,480
you got to make that up fucking priority
cause it's going to be stressful enough.

962
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:34,250
But anyways, ice, I still maintain
it this point. Fuck this guy.

963
00:58:34,610 --> 00:58:37,730
Anyways, that Christmas was so
depressing, but who could I talk to?

964
00:58:38,030 --> 00:58:42,080
The engagement was a secret.
I told him being engaged was a joke.

965
00:58:42,110 --> 00:58:45,620
I don't want to be on this
rollercoaster anymore or ever again.

966
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:49,370
Now he started because he says
marriage is, it is important to him.

967
00:58:50,090 --> 00:58:54,770
He does want to marry me. Just not
yet hot. No thanks. I'm good. He said,

968
00:58:54,771 --> 00:58:57,230
well we'll just revisit this later.

969
00:58:57,231 --> 00:59:01,130
Your thoughts from one cynical ginger
to another thanks to the left. Yeah.

970
00:59:01,131 --> 00:59:06,060
Fuck this guy. Fuck this guy. This,

971
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:07,190
this is what,
this is what,

972
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:09,440
yeah,

973
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:10,850
this guy's an asshole.

974
00:59:12,910 --> 00:59:16,600
I want to postpone the engagement because
you gain weight. That's what the fuck.

975
00:59:16,610 --> 00:59:20,920
You going to hitch your wagon
to? Fuck this guy. Fuck that guy.

976
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:26,260
Um, and you seem really strong
and [inaudible], you know,

977
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:27,940
you're getting his
master's degree in physics.

978
00:59:28,230 --> 00:59:30,850
You can be out there designing roller
coasters or whatever the fuck you're going

979
00:59:30,851 --> 00:59:33,970
to be doing. You don't
need this guy. By the way,

980
00:59:33,971 --> 00:59:36,660
I watched this thing that I have recorded.
You know my wife's, we thank you.

981
00:59:36,670 --> 00:59:41,530
We need stuff on the Dvr, right?
Whatever the fuck you call it nowadays.

982
00:59:41,590 --> 00:59:44,500
So we had to go back and erase
a bunch of shit that I taped.

983
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:47,140
I kept all my Superbowl highlights.

984
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:51,700
I kept 'em the Patriots for
Seattle and Patriots first.

985
00:59:51,701 --> 00:59:55,750
Atlanta had no problem erasing
patriots versus eagles. Um,

986
00:59:56,680 --> 01:00:01,540
and I don't know where those patriots,
verse giants Games went. Geez. Um,

987
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:07,200
Ethel Merman. All right. You want to talk
about a fucking hilarious human being?

988
01:00:08,390 --> 01:00:12,850
Uh, I got to find this
fucking thing. Ethel Merman.

989
01:00:12,851 --> 01:00:14,830
She was all right.

990
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:19,630
We were watching this fucking
thing on the JFK inauguration,

991
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:24,970
which was supposed to be broadcast by NBC.
And,

992
01:00:24,971 --> 01:00:28,240
uh, there was a horrific snow storm.
They were in this weird venue.

993
01:00:29,350 --> 01:00:33,010
It was like Frank Sinatra,
Nat King Cole, Ethel Merman,

994
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:37,600
uh, uh, Milton Berle.

995
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:44,310
Who else? Gene Kelly. Harry Belafonte,

996
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:46,320
Ella Fitzgerald.
I mean,

997
01:00:46,321 --> 01:00:51,321
it was crazy lineup and I'm
Jimmy Duranti and all this shit.

998
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:53,370
This was like a,
it was a big deal.

999
01:00:53,580 --> 01:00:58,580
This is the first time
like marrying Hollywood and
politics now where that's led

1000
01:00:59,821 --> 01:01:01,620
us is probably a bad thing.
But

1001
01:01:02,610 --> 01:01:03,443
MMM.

1002
01:01:05,590 --> 01:01:07,730
It was just on a, watching all
these performances and everything.

1003
01:01:07,731 --> 01:01:12,731
So watch an Ethel Merman
and she's literally wearing
just like this winter coat

1004
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:18,750
during the performance because she went
there for rehearsals and she got stuck

1005
01:01:18,970 --> 01:01:23,970
in the snow and couldn't get back to a
hotel and she was a Republican and still

1006
01:01:24,370 --> 01:01:29,350
sang to the president rather than
all these fucking Douche is today.

1007
01:01:29,351 --> 01:01:32,290
It'd be like, Oh, good look
good is the shit right.

1008
01:01:32,291 --> 01:01:34,420
And then she put politics
aside and she did it.

1009
01:01:34,630 --> 01:01:39,280
And as she was singing near
just goes like, she said
something like that. There's,

1010
01:01:39,340 --> 01:01:42,250
there's a fucking there right there,
there is a tough broad.

1011
01:01:42,310 --> 01:01:45,760
And I just started laughing. I
said, what do you mean? She goes,

1012
01:01:45,761 --> 01:01:48,580
you could just see it. She's,
she's been through it all,

1013
01:01:49,270 --> 01:01:52,990
bunch of asshole guys and she survived.
She's seen it all and blah blah.

1014
01:01:52,991 --> 01:01:55,450
So I look her up and of course
[inaudible] was 100% right.

1015
01:01:55,780 --> 01:01:57,730
She'd been married like four times

1016
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:04,440
and she was married one time for like
three months to earn as Borgnine and they

1017
01:02:05,021 --> 01:02:07,690
got divorced.
All they did was argue and she,

1018
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:10,330
one of the things she
said was extreme cruelty.

1019
01:02:11,350 --> 01:02:15,170
So there's a quote,
I wish I could find the fucking thing.

1020
01:02:16,470 --> 01:02:20,290
Um, let me, I got to find, cause
I, cause she it so perfectly.

1021
01:02:21,790 --> 01:02:24,700
You want to talk about somebody hilarious
that you've loved to hang out with?

1022
01:02:26,020 --> 01:02:27,130
Uh,

1023
01:02:29,390 --> 01:02:30,200
okay.

1024
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:35,040
Earnest. I just put in
Ethel Merman. Earnest cunt.

1025
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:36,630
Okay.

1026
01:02:36,630 --> 01:02:39,030
Ernest Borgnine. Ethel
Merman. There we go.

1027
01:02:40,350 --> 01:02:44,460
The classic Ethel Merman Story.
All right,

1028
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:47,800
I'll of course this is going to be some
dude's turning it into an entire fucking

1029
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:49,910
okay.

1030
01:02:49,910 --> 01:02:51,530
Tire fucking blog.

1031
01:02:52,630 --> 01:02:53,100
Okay.

1032
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:54,690
God damn ass holes.

1033
01:02:58,100 --> 01:03:01,250
Okay. Yeah. So she was
in her brief marriage.

1034
01:03:01,310 --> 01:03:03,470
Mirman was on some fucking um,

1035
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:05,193
yeah,

1036
01:03:05,950 --> 01:03:08,620
she was on some fucking
movie set and she came home,

1037
01:03:08,621 --> 01:03:12,280
she was all excited because the director
had complimented her saying her if she

1038
01:03:12,281 --> 01:03:14,350
had the voice of like a 25 year old,

1039
01:03:14,860 --> 01:03:19,030
you know the face and she was
like, she was like 60, all right,

1040
01:03:19,810 --> 01:03:23,980
35 year old face and a 35 year old figure.

1041
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:29,560
And she said, and then Ernest
Borgnine said, oh yeah, it goes,

1042
01:03:30,430 --> 01:03:35,170
did he bring up your old
content? And she goes, no,

1043
01:03:35,890 --> 01:03:39,310
he didn't mention you once.
Stuff like that. I Dunno,

1044
01:03:40,660 --> 01:03:43,120
they fight. This isn't,
this isn't written as well.

1045
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:49,360
And what about your 65 year old cut and
she said, nobody mentioned you at all.

1046
01:03:49,390 --> 01:03:52,090
I've seen this thing written like
five different ways. She also did it.

1047
01:03:52,091 --> 01:03:57,091
She did a guest star on some set comp
and they had a curse jar and she was in

1048
01:03:57,311 --> 01:03:59,830
the middle of whatever sketch they
would do it. And then she just stopped.

1049
01:03:59,831 --> 01:04:01,690
She goes,
what the hell is this going?

1050
01:04:02,140 --> 01:04:05,560
And then the star of the show
was just like a Bethel, you know,

1051
01:04:05,561 --> 01:04:09,110
my rule that'll cost you a dollar.
And She just goes out. Howdy.

1052
01:04:09,970 --> 01:04:12,460
What would it cost me to
tell you to go fuck yourself?

1053
01:04:14,490 --> 01:04:17,870
So
Ethel Merman.

1054
01:04:18,740 --> 01:04:23,410
Ethel Merman is a new, um, a
new, I'm a big fan of hers. Um,

1055
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:25,910
unfortunately she passed
away a long time ago,

1056
01:04:25,911 --> 01:04:29,420
so you can't go out and have a drink with
her, but just seemed fucking hilarious.

1057
01:04:29,421 --> 01:04:29,631
All right,

1058
01:04:29,631 --> 01:04:33,860
let me read the last goddamn question here
so I can move on with my fucking life.

1059
01:04:34,770 --> 01:04:35,603
MMM.

1060
01:04:36,550 --> 01:04:40,540
Why do I keep doing this? I keep going
away from my fucking, the questions here.

1061
01:04:40,570 --> 01:04:44,170
This is like unprecedented the amount
of times I fucked this up and you guys

1062
01:04:44,171 --> 01:04:47,830
have to listen to me, uh, on precedent
for this podcast, I should say.

1063
01:04:49,030 --> 01:04:51,700
All right, content. Here's
the last one. The last one.

1064
01:04:53,130 --> 01:04:53,600
Okay.

1065
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:58,310
He is a jealous boyfriend. I love that the
women are finally right now. All right.

1066
01:04:58,311 --> 01:05:00,920
Hello Bill Burr. I really
love your podcast. Thank you.

1067
01:05:00,921 --> 01:05:04,280
When I was wondering what your thoughts
on a situation I am going through.

1068
01:05:04,580 --> 01:05:06,710
This is my first serious relationship.

1069
01:05:06,711 --> 01:05:11,690
My boyfriend and I just moved in
about four months ago. I have, oh,

1070
01:05:11,691 --> 01:05:16,691
I have always fucking known that he's
bent over protective and jealous.

1071
01:05:18,090 --> 01:05:21,780
However, I did started to progress
more and more. Oh, get out,

1072
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:27,030
get out. I trust him that he's
not cheating on me. Of course,

1073
01:05:27,060 --> 01:05:28,170
like many other women,

1074
01:05:28,171 --> 01:05:32,250
I can be self conscious and think that
maybe he could stray or do better,

1075
01:05:32,251 --> 01:05:36,240
but I've never once accused him of
cheating on me. Not once, however,

1076
01:05:36,750 --> 01:05:38,520
he has caused me

1077
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:43,080
what he has caused me of cheating on.

1078
01:05:43,110 --> 01:05:45,630
He's accused do,

1079
01:05:45,631 --> 01:05:48,690
these are all voice texts he has
caused me of cheating on him.

1080
01:05:48,691 --> 01:05:50,700
He's accused me of cheating
on him multiple times.

1081
01:05:50,910 --> 01:05:54,480
The worst case of when
it should have been up,

1082
01:05:54,481 --> 01:05:59,010
which he made accusations,
uh, was fairly recently.

1083
01:05:59,820 --> 01:06:02,400
I just got a full,
a new full time job.

1084
01:06:02,430 --> 01:06:05,010
I was only working part
time minimum wage job,

1085
01:06:05,310 --> 01:06:08,990
which I'm very excited about
that this full time job. Um,

1086
01:06:09,030 --> 01:06:13,710
so that he's not the only one working.
I feel like I can contribute now.

1087
01:06:13,740 --> 01:06:17,700
However, he started accusing me of
cheating on him with someone at work,

1088
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:19,290
even though there is no evidence,

1089
01:06:19,470 --> 01:06:23,100
he even started accusing me of
cheating on him with his own cousin.

1090
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:28,410
He's the one that helped me get the job
is act, use of Tint to dump this guy.

1091
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:32,250
His accusations are not just him speaking,
but yelling,

1092
01:06:32,251 --> 01:06:36,870
hitting walls and scaring me to the point
like he might get violent. Ah, right.

1093
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:37,830
Here's what should do.

1094
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:39,270
Okay.

1095
01:06:39,270 --> 01:06:43,530
Okay. Put a deposit down on
another fucking apartment.

1096
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:48,300
Okay. One day when he goes to
work, you take a fucking sick day,

1097
01:06:49,060 --> 01:06:53,430
all right? You get a friend, you
clear all your shit out of there,

1098
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:55,190
okay?

1099
01:06:55,190 --> 01:07:00,180
Yeah. Fuck this guy.
Fuck this guy. All right?

1100
01:07:00,470 --> 01:07:02,210
You don't want to be
anywhere near this guy.

1101
01:07:02,211 --> 01:07:05,180
You don't want to be around this guy when
you break up with him, he seems like a,

1102
01:07:05,390 --> 01:07:07,060
I don't like any of this.
Uh,

1103
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:10,700
he doesn't even want me to wear shorts
and we live in this area that gets hot.

1104
01:07:11,090 --> 01:07:14,090
I am not the type of person to show a
lot of skins. However, when it's hot,

1105
01:07:14,091 --> 01:07:16,310
I would like to wear shorts.
He Isi. What's going on here?

1106
01:07:17,730 --> 01:07:21,220
This guy's taking over your whole life.
I'm just wondering if this,

1107
01:07:21,250 --> 01:07:22,083
if his thoughts

1108
01:07:23,910 --> 01:07:27,690
that me wearing shorts is disrespectful
to him to the point he is just the f.

1109
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:29,033
Wait a minute.

1110
01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:32,500
I'm just wondering if his thoughts
that me wearing shorts is different.

1111
01:07:32,501 --> 01:07:37,501
It's disrespectful to him to the point
he is justified breaking up with me over

1112
01:07:37,711 --> 01:07:38,544
this.

1113
01:07:39,410 --> 01:07:40,000
Okay.

1114
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,990
I am not sure where to draw the line.
Oh,

1115
01:07:41,991 --> 01:07:45,310
you should have drawn the line of
while ago are now, let me ask you this.

1116
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:48,640
If any girlfriend you had was telling
you this story, you would be like,

1117
01:07:48,641 --> 01:07:52,450
get the fuck out. Right. I really
believe that. I love and care about him.

1118
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:55,120
That's the problem. However, when he does.

1119
01:07:56,140 --> 01:07:56,730
Okay,

1120
01:07:56,730 --> 01:08:00,210
when love, when does love turn
into more of an obsession? Also,

1121
01:08:00,211 --> 01:08:03,420
what is considered an abusive or
unhealthy relationship? I would say this.

1122
01:08:03,870 --> 01:08:05,370
I would really like to know your thoughts.

1123
01:08:05,371 --> 01:08:08,070
You are straight up and I believe
you'll be able to give some good advice,

1124
01:08:08,071 --> 01:08:12,840
especially since you will not have real
bias since you don't know us. Thank you.

1125
01:08:12,870 --> 01:08:16,040
Yeah, you should get the fire as far as
your version. What's going on? You should

1126
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:17,000
get the fuck out of here.

1127
01:08:17,990 --> 01:08:22,790
Just the fact that he's choosing
you are cheating on him. Um,

1128
01:08:22,850 --> 01:08:25,640
and what's your, what's his
cousin, which is fucking weird.

1129
01:08:26,690 --> 01:08:29,300
And then yelling and hitting the
walls. I mean, you're already out.

1130
01:08:29,330 --> 01:08:32,330
You're already gone. You
should be gone. And now, uh,

1131
01:08:32,990 --> 01:08:37,910
the fact that he's telling you what
you can and can't wear. Fuck this guy.

1132
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:42,420
So the problem is as you
moved in with the guy,

1133
01:08:42,421 --> 01:08:43,830
so if you break up with the guy,

1134
01:08:43,890 --> 01:08:46,560
what are you going to go into another
room and then you've got to worry about

1135
01:08:46,561 --> 01:08:51,330
this guy, you know,
doing God knows what. Um,

1136
01:08:51,570 --> 01:08:55,410
do you have any male friends? Do you
have a brother? Somebody, you know,

1137
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:58,410
they can help protect you when
you get your shit out of there.

1138
01:08:58,830 --> 01:09:00,600
I would get another fucking, I mean, I,

1139
01:09:00,601 --> 01:09:03,990
this is the type of situation
I wouldn't fuck you pride.

1140
01:09:03,991 --> 01:09:08,110
I would move back in with my parents if
I had to and drive longer to work the

1141
01:09:08,111 --> 01:09:10,280
fuck out of that.
Um,

1142
01:09:13,510 --> 01:09:17,890
and uh, I'd be it sees he's
breakup ever as far as the reasons.

1143
01:09:19,300 --> 01:09:20,010
Uh,
I dunno,

1144
01:09:20,010 --> 01:09:24,460
cause you don't trust me because you think
I'm fucking your cousin to the point,

1145
01:09:24,461 --> 01:09:28,500
your raw acting like Jeff Goldbloom and
the fly and start punching the goddamn

1146
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:31,390
door jams out. Oh. And by the way,

1147
01:09:31,391 --> 01:09:35,980
it's 90 degrees out and I can't wear
shorts because you and your fragile ego

1148
01:09:35,981 --> 01:09:36,940
can't fucking handle it.

1149
01:09:36,941 --> 01:09:41,230
And I wouldn't say it this way because
this guy sounds like a lunatic. Um,

1150
01:09:44,130 --> 01:09:46,950
I dunno what, what could
you say that would just make
this guy go away? Just say,

1151
01:09:46,980 --> 01:09:47,551
ah,
you know,

1152
01:09:47,551 --> 01:09:52,551
I just decided that I want to get really
fat and wear shorts and I didn't want

1153
01:09:53,291 --> 01:09:55,060
to put you through that.
I don't know what to tell you,

1154
01:09:55,061 --> 01:09:59,370
but I would get out of this. And when
somebody is violent like this, uh,

1155
01:09:59,380 --> 01:10:03,650
I would be concerned about
your own safety. So like I
said, I would take a, uh,

1156
01:10:06,310 --> 01:10:07,143
okay.

1157
01:10:07,170 --> 01:10:10,320
This is what you do. All right. I
figured you, you sound like a young,

1158
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:12,090
so you probably don't have that much shit.

1159
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:13,820
Okay.

1160
01:10:13,820 --> 01:10:16,640
So, uh, I would just,

1161
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:19,490
whatever your friend is that's
going to help you move out.

1162
01:10:19,730 --> 01:10:24,440
You put the boxes together over her
house. All right? And then bump,

1163
01:10:24,450 --> 01:10:28,990
bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump.
You fucking go in there. All right.

1164
01:10:28,991 --> 01:10:32,890
You just act like you go into work
and then you don't fucking go to work.

1165
01:10:34,810 --> 01:10:38,650
Okay. And, and uh, I would even
tell you boss, just say, listen,

1166
01:10:38,710 --> 01:10:43,270
I am living with a guy I have to break
up with and I'm afraid he's going to get

1167
01:10:43,271 --> 01:10:47,200
violent. So he's at work today. Uh,

1168
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:49,700
I'm going to act like I'm going to work
and I'm going to clear my shit out of

1169
01:10:49,701 --> 01:10:51,890
that. And I think you should be
fine. And then you guys fucking,

1170
01:10:51,891 --> 01:10:53,480
and he'd probably be like, you
want some fucking help? You know,

1171
01:10:54,420 --> 01:10:56,110
cause he's a good dude and then ball.
So He's maybe,

1172
01:10:56,250 --> 01:10:58,560
maybe he's trying to fuck you.
Wait a minute.

1173
01:10:59,310 --> 01:11:01,470
Maybe a boyfriend's actually make
it a good point. No, I'm kidding.

1174
01:11:01,980 --> 01:11:06,980
Go in there and I would just clear
all your fucking shit out and uh,

1175
01:11:07,181 --> 01:11:11,190
I would fucking yeah.
And I would go live somewhere else.

1176
01:11:13,890 --> 01:11:14,740
Uh,

1177
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:17,970
then I would have one last conversation
with this guy and I would change my cell

1178
01:11:17,971 --> 01:11:22,320
phone number. That's it. Eh,

1179
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:25,310
uh, I dunno. Depending on
where the fuck you live,

1180
01:11:26,180 --> 01:11:31,130
maybe you can just, he won't be able to
find your butter. Yeah. This is just,

1181
01:11:31,131 --> 01:11:32,660
this is good.
This is the beginning.

1182
01:11:32,810 --> 01:11:36,800
This has the beginnings of someone
that's going to stalk you and possibly do

1183
01:11:36,801 --> 01:11:40,980
something fucking horrible.
Fuck this guy. All right.

1184
01:11:42,810 --> 01:11:45,870
I wish my wife was here to hear this God
damn email. She's always talking about,

1185
01:11:45,871 --> 01:11:49,680
you know, how fucking difficult
a person I am. You know,

1186
01:11:51,110 --> 01:11:53,900
I'm going to fucking print this email
out and put it on her side of the bed,

1187
01:11:53,901 --> 01:11:54,734
on the pillow.

1188
01:11:58,040 --> 01:12:01,700
I shouldn't be making jokes like this.
Yeah, I would get the fuck out of it. Uh,

1189
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:04,810
and that's it. And I will, uh,

1190
01:12:04,980 --> 01:12:08,670
go find love with somebody that's
excited that she got a new job,

1191
01:12:08,671 --> 01:12:11,590
but you're going to be
participating and that a,

1192
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:15,180
and let you wear shorts when it's
hot out. There you go. Everybody,

1193
01:12:15,181 --> 01:12:19,750
that's the podcast for this week.
Go fuck yourselves and I'll check it

1194
01:12:21,530 --> 01:12:23,810
on, uh, on Thursday.

1195
01:12:23,811 --> 01:12:28,280
Could we congratulations to the Ferrari
team for winning. The next one is,

1196
01:12:28,281 --> 01:12:30,230
I believe in Bahrain
or something like that,

1197
01:12:30,231 --> 01:12:32,720
and then they go to fucking
Singapore. All right, I'll see you.
