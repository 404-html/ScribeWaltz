1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:00,893
Okay.

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:05,310
Hey, what's going on? Is Bill Burn?
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

3
00:00:05,311 --> 00:00:07,980
Just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast and

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:15,360
just checking in on you.
I'm just checking in on you.

5
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:20,380
Duda Duda I only got one more
fucking day before I fucking go home.

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,760
One more day in the film. I still
got three more after this, but uh,

7
00:00:25,761 --> 00:00:28,670
I get to go home and see
my little daughter is here.

8
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,070
Very excited about that.
Um, and by the way,

9
00:00:32,071 --> 00:00:34,890
I asked the director if it's okay if I
tell you what movie this cause I never

10
00:00:34,891 --> 00:00:39,480
know, you know, fuel leak out
information. He said it was cool.

11
00:00:39,481 --> 00:00:44,481
So the movie's called front runner front
run out and it stars Hugh Jackman and

12
00:00:47,161 --> 00:00:51,930
uh, directed by Jason Reitman.
Okay, there you go. So,

13
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,460
oh, freckles has a little part
in there. Don't blink your eyes.

14
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:01,230
Your mind miss me. But uh, that
is what I am working on out here.

15
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,830
And um, every time I go down
to set, I'm telling you,

16
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:09,120
they show me something that they shot
and it looks really, really fucking cool.

17
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,580
So I'm very excited to be in
a, in this movie here. But,

18
00:01:14,581 --> 00:01:17,780
uh, yeah, so I got one day one, uh,

19
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:22,020
like I got one scene today site and
I'm the first one out of the gate.

20
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,810
That's about as good as it gets.
You know what I mean?

21
00:01:24,811 --> 00:01:27,030
Sometimes you the first
scene and the last scene,

22
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,680
but you get to see everybody else act and
everything like that. And that's cool,

23
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:35,610
right? The only thing that's bad about
being there the entire fucking day is for

24
00:01:35,611 --> 00:01:39,600
whatever reason, um, when
you're on a movie set,

25
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,120
you just eat like a fucking,
I don't even know why.

26
00:01:42,121 --> 00:01:44,240
You don't even know why you're eating.
You just sitting there going,

27
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,450
why am I eating right now?

28
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,000
Just standing around and all of a sudden
they bring around some fucking, uh,

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,060
oh Halloween's coming up here.
Some fucking Halloween cookies.

30
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:00,270
They start eating like you're in the
fifth grade, literally eating it,

31
00:02:00,271 --> 00:02:03,870
looking at another adult who's also eating
it. And you both say at the same time,

32
00:02:03,871 --> 00:02:06,300
what the fuck are we doing?
Um,

33
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:10,440
I've actually been pretty good on this
shoot and the food's been awesome. So, uh,

34
00:02:10,441 --> 00:02:15,441
and I did lay off the Halloween cookies
and I'm doing my fucking catio today.

35
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,960
Being a professional.
God dammit.

36
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:23,010
You guys all know what a freckled
booze bag bag I am. Right?

37
00:02:23,011 --> 00:02:27,690
You all know how I can't lay off the
booze. Um, I've been doing it man,

38
00:02:27,691 --> 00:02:30,650
70 fucking days. So a, I don't know,

39
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:36,480
think on day 73 already be 20% of a year
already have that in. I might go a year,

40
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,560
I might go a year. I might fucking
bows tonight. I don't know.

41
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:44,310
Who knows? It's exciting.
It's an exciting time.

42
00:02:44,311 --> 00:02:47,460
Do you think that world series game
last night was fucking riveting?

43
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:53,060
That that was, that was a joke compared
to watching me try to walk by a bar.

44
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:58,490
Um, I was on set last night,
so I didn't get to, I saw,

45
00:02:58,570 --> 00:02:59,980
uh,
it was three

46
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,990
to one and then,
uh,

47
00:03:01,991 --> 00:03:05,050
we were shooting the final thing and I
checked the score and I saw it was three

48
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:09,820
to three. I was like, Holy Shit.
The Astros came back and um,

49
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,540
we ended up wrapping and uh,

50
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:19,210
it was like five to three
Houston. So I, you know,

51
00:03:19,211 --> 00:03:22,270
we go down there, we get out of our
fucking clothes and all that shit.

52
00:03:22,271 --> 00:03:27,190
We had get back into the regular clothes,
they head back to the hotel,

53
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:30,550
everything's shut down here.
And me and another actor went into the,

54
00:03:30,551 --> 00:03:34,410
this bar that we saw that was open and uh,

55
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,100
try and get something to eat.
I think it was like after 12,

56
00:03:38,101 --> 00:03:42,240
at that point it was going to slip pickets
around the area that we're staying at.

57
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:46,170
And uh, we walked into the bar and saw
that it was five to five. I was like,

58
00:03:46,171 --> 00:03:50,010
you gotta be fucking kidding me.
Well, maybe it was seven to five.

59
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,250
Seven to five.
Yeah.

60
00:03:53,251 --> 00:03:58,251
The last I saw it was five to three Astros
and the time it took me to get offset

61
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:04,230
jumped in the van and head back, it became
seven to five Astros. And I was like,

62
00:04:04,231 --> 00:04:05,310
what the fuck happened?

63
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:10,470
I'm missing one of the greatest
world series games probably ever.

64
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:16,200
And um, so we go in there and we
asked the guy behind the bar, right.

65
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:21,120
You know, and the guy's like, he's
like, sorry, fellows. The fucking,

66
00:04:21,121 --> 00:04:23,880
I can't even explain how
high this guy's voice was.

67
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:28,230
I Dunno if he was in the middle of
transitioning or whatever. I have no idea.

68
00:04:28,231 --> 00:04:29,064
But it was like,

69
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:34,290
it was like Michael Jackson
level high inexplicably,

70
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,710
and the guy had stubble on his face.
I don't get it right.

71
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:43,410
Um, do you look like a giant?
Like marionette puppet is going,

72
00:04:43,411 --> 00:04:46,810
sorry fellows, if you brought
a guy in here, you gotta go.

73
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:52,530
So fortunately this guy with the
high pitch voice told us where to go.

74
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:57,150
We ended up going all the way down the
street and I'm like four or five blocks

75
00:04:57,151 --> 00:05:00,300
down and it was really cold for Atlanta.

76
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:02,910
I thought even I'm sitting with a little
fucking sweatshirt and we went down and

77
00:05:02,911 --> 00:05:07,320
found this bar that was still open and
we get in there, it's seven to five.

78
00:05:07,321 --> 00:05:10,600
And as we walk in the, the,
the Dodgers hit a home run,

79
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,740
I think to make it seven to six.

80
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:15,450
Okay.

81
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,360
They didn't only down by a run.
It's like, you gotta be kidding.

82
00:05:17,361 --> 00:05:20,360
This is unbelievable.
And um,

83
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:22,790
unfortunately the game ended day.

84
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:25,490
I was sitting there because I wanted the
Astros to tie it up cause I want more,

85
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,290
more baseball. I want to see a, I want
to see a seven game series here. But uh,

86
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:33,950
I wanted the Dodgers to tie it up
cause I was hoping like, you know,

87
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,840
I wasn't going to bed.
I was fucking wired.

88
00:05:35,841 --> 00:05:37,730
I was hoping to get like
15 innings of baseball,

89
00:05:37,731 --> 00:05:41,300
but congratulations to the Astros.
You know,

90
00:05:41,301 --> 00:05:42,800
and things are getting a
little chippy out there.

91
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:45,860
I guess they're imitating some guy in the
Dodgers. The guy with the Blue Mohawk,

92
00:05:45,861 --> 00:05:47,090
I don't know anybody's fucking name.

93
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,900
I guess he flips the bat and sticks his
tongue out so they're like, oh yeah,

94
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:54,290
we're going to flip the bat.
We're going to stick our tongues out.

95
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:57,560
These are adult male, 70 buddy. Um,

96
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:03,770
stupidest shit ever. But it's
been a, a incredible series.

97
00:06:03,771 --> 00:06:07,100
So I'm hoping game three,
I'll actually be, uh,

98
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:11,570
I'll be home and I can sit down and
watch it. Now watch game three will suck.

99
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:15,890
You know what I mean? The pitcher's
duel, not even a good one.

100
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:21,320
They leave stranded base
runners. Um, and that's it.

101
00:06:21,321 --> 00:06:24,050
That's all the fuck I got.
I don't, I don't know what
to tell you. I'm just been,

102
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:24,913
um,

103
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:25,980
yeah,

104
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:29,250
working like a maniac.
So I'm in the first scene tonight today,

105
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,970
which is great because,
um, I'm actually going,

106
00:06:33,971 --> 00:06:38,240
I can do a little promotion here.
Um, there's a 30 for 30 coming out,

107
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,030
an arguably one of the greatest,

108
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:46,010
if not the greatest entertainer of all
time and wrestler of all time ric flair,

109
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,990
the ric flair.
30.

110
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:52,110
The 30 is coming out and they're
having a premiere tonight and uh,

111
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,790
I'm going to go to it and I think
ric flair is going to be there.

112
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,050
So I'm going to go a little Jim Norton
Herr and try to get my picture cause I've

113
00:07:00,051 --> 00:07:03,540
had a Twitter photo up on my,
uh,

114
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:09,200
my Twitter account since then. That was
taken in June of 2014. I still remember,

115
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,230
I got to meet him,
talk to him.

116
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:17,150
He was the coolest fucking dude
ever was telling stories and uh,

117
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:20,870
just an awesome guy. So I'm hoping that
tonight I can update my photo. Cool.

118
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:24,350
That'd be haven't updated it in three
years because it was a ric flair photo.

119
00:07:24,351 --> 00:07:28,220
Hopefully I can update it again with
another one. Um, and if I don't,

120
00:07:28,221 --> 00:07:30,440
who gives a shit? I get to
watch the ric flair. 30 for 30,

121
00:07:30,441 --> 00:07:34,010
which everybody should watch.
I don't care what's going on in your life.

122
00:07:34,011 --> 00:07:37,850
I don't care if your wife's
going like tying together.

123
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:40,550
We go to the pumpkin patch.

124
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:45,130
[inaudible] you got to say lady,
this is one.

125
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:48,110
I'm not doing the Tivo. Want this
one. I'm going to watch live.

126
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:50,960
Fucking what do I lie?
All right.

127
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,130
You got to see this one live.
And um,

128
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:00,490
how do you, how do you wrap up
ric flair story in 30 minutes?

129
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:05,510
Is that what it means? Right.
30 stories, 30 minutes long.

130
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:11,270
They've already done way more than 30, so
they should, you know, I already saw Dan,

131
00:08:11,271 --> 00:08:15,170
the Dan Marino football life and that
was 30 minutes like with commercials or

132
00:08:15,171 --> 00:08:19,100
something like that was her day. You
should have been at least 90 minutes. Um,

133
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,930
how much the game has changed.

134
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:22,450
Okay.

135
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:26,680
And how much the game had the change and
how would it had his big dad to become

136
00:08:26,681 --> 00:08:31,660
borderline illegal to cover a receiver
past, you know, your first little,

137
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:34,900
you know, two yard chuck or
whatever you're allowed to do.

138
00:08:34,901 --> 00:08:37,480
Now all of that had to happen.

139
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:43,480
NFL had to try to go global and
try to get all these fucking,

140
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:47,410
you know, halfass fans by,
by running up the scores.

141
00:08:47,411 --> 00:08:52,411
All of that had to fucking happen for
Dan Marino's records that stood for 30

142
00:08:53,021 --> 00:08:54,880
years to start the fall.
That's all I'm saying.

143
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:59,880
You that should have been 90 minutes.
No, I guess she can't do that.

144
00:08:59,881 --> 00:09:01,920
Cause then all the other
legendary players who'd be like,

145
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:06,950
well how come [inaudible] he six,

146
00:09:07,111 --> 00:09:11,970
he's talking about flips to bat and
then they'd get on fucking upset.

147
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:16,350
I did things too, you know. So anyways,

148
00:09:16,351 --> 00:09:21,190
I'm looking forward to that
and um, I dunno, and that's it.

149
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:25,570
Other than that, I'm going out of
my mind, uh, being stone sober,

150
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:29,980
remembering every fucking
waking moment of the day. Uh,

151
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:33,970
every day that I'm sober,
I'm reminded why I drank.

152
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,180
You know,
I got to go to an AA meeting.

153
00:09:40,181 --> 00:09:43,210
I got to hear people talk
positively about being sober.

154
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,660
Cause I gotta be honest with you,
I don't fucking get it.

155
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:49,510
And when I fucking lay off the booze,

156
00:09:49,511 --> 00:09:53,110
all it does is make me want to try drugs.
You know,

157
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:59,080
I never smoked weed. I don't
smoke. I'm not into it. I
just don't, I'm not into it.

158
00:09:59,081 --> 00:10:02,110
But then if I don't drink everyone,
then a couple times a month I'm just like,

159
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:04,720
I got to fucking do something
to break up the monotony.

160
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:10,170
I have such a respect for the straight
edge people. I don't know how they do it.

161
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:16,040
Guy Tried to tell me what being sober,
he goes, you know, you don't understand.

162
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:20,210
Is that like, you know, alcohol kills.

163
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,400
I see endorphins.

164
00:10:22,401 --> 00:10:26,090
I don't know what it is that actually
makes you feel good about your life.

165
00:10:26,091 --> 00:10:29,480
He goes, I don't drink. I'm actually,
I don't need it. I don't need a bill.

166
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:33,840
I'm like high on life, you know? And
I was just looking at him. I was,

167
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,950
I couldn't help but think
you're full of shit.

168
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:44,000
No you're not. You know, when you're
high on life, when you're a kid,

169
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:48,890
you know, and you never throw out your
back and your shoulders not fucked up.

170
00:10:48,891 --> 00:10:51,560
You don't have a sciatic nerve issue.
Your feet don't hurt.

171
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,720
He just get out of bed.
You're brand new.

172
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:57,140
You're jumping around the fucking
house doing cartwheels and shit,

173
00:10:57,141 --> 00:10:59,510
running around. Hey, let's
go in the living room.

174
00:10:59,511 --> 00:11:02,810
You just get up and you'll run to the
other room. Then you high on life.

175
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,590
You don't have any credit
card debt, right? You know,

176
00:11:06,591 --> 00:11:10,940
got a lady in your life going to wish
they didn't have a date night, right?

177
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:13,820
None of that bullshit.
Then you can be high on life.

178
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:19,610
Then you don't what happens? Uh, you
know what happens? You become an adult,

179
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:24,590
all right? And all the sudden
you start understanding why,

180
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:29,270
why it is that technically,
you know what I mean?

181
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:33,710
If you live in down on the equator,
you're actually standing sideways,

182
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:38,990
okay? And why you don't go
flying off the fucking planet.

183
00:11:38,991 --> 00:11:42,380
You start to understand it.
It's the weight,

184
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,880
the weight of the universe being on this
thing that's fucking spinning, right?

185
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:51,800
And all this fucking debt you're fucking
accumulate and it's all Cohen down on

186
00:11:51,801 --> 00:11:56,500
you. And the holidays are up right
around the holidays. Fun Anymore, Huh?

187
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:00,700
Did you get into the Christmas spirit
the way you got to start going around and

188
00:12:00,701 --> 00:12:03,640
fucking seeing everybody and
getting on a fucking plane,

189
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:06,520
watching some Douche bag
after they just said,

190
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,610
only one thing per person
in the overhead compartment.

191
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,920
Stick three fucking bags up there.

192
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:15,003
You know what I mean?

193
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:19,540
And that's when the stewardess comes
by and she just cause can I get you

194
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:22,750
something? Could you like something
to drink? It's like, yeah lady.

195
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:24,880
You know those little
bottles of booze you have?

196
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:27,610
How many do you think you
could carry in both your arms?

197
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,560
Why don't you stuff a few in your fucking
breezier over the year and bring them

198
00:12:32,561 --> 00:12:35,680
over here so I can get through
this God damn flight. Right.

199
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,700
Um, or maybe, you know,

200
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,640
maybe you would still
enjoy that time of year.

201
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:48,670
It's that time of year when you could say,
look at that.

202
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,830
I was just singing a Christmas song when
I was still in the fucking was a head

203
00:12:51,831 --> 00:12:55,150
fall as a beer commercial
head for the mountains.

204
00:12:55,450 --> 00:13:00,400
That taste is smooth then it's Busch beer,
Busch beer.

205
00:13:00,401 --> 00:13:04,630
I live how they have the balls to do a
commercial now as if their beer tastes

206
00:13:04,631 --> 00:13:07,210
good.
Everybody knows that Busch beer is for,

207
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:10,600
that's what that's like when you're hung
over and you want to get back in the

208
00:13:10,601 --> 00:13:13,940
game. You know that's that.
You know, could be big.

209
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:19,150
They fucking slit your fucking eyelids
cause you were all swollen up from the

210
00:13:19,151 --> 00:13:21,180
boost the night before and
that's what that beers,

211
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:26,350
let's put Busch beer and all those
fucking beers, cores, light, Busch,

212
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:28,023
Busch light,

213
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:33,060
all of those fucking beers are when
you drank so hard the night before,

214
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:34,480
you know,

215
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,020
and you just don't have it in you not to
drink the next day and you need to get

216
00:13:38,021 --> 00:13:42,070
back in the game. It's the cortisone
shot of alcohol. That's what it is.

217
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:49,030
It's fucking stupid fucking commercials
with the guy standing next to a goddamn

218
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,490
river.
What does that all about?

219
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:55,720
To let me know how watered down that
fucking can pisses that I'm going to be

220
00:13:55,721 --> 00:13:59,600
drinking. But God bless you because
it still gets me fucked up. Um,

221
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:03,820
anyways. I don't know. Do I need
therapy? I don't know what it is.

222
00:14:03,821 --> 00:14:07,830
I think I just need to
get home. Um, so anyways,

223
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:12,940
um, yeah, I just been going on in my
mind here, unless I'm down on the set,

224
00:14:12,941 --> 00:14:16,390
if I'm just fucking hanging out and it
keeps saying I keep threatening to myself,

225
00:14:16,391 --> 00:14:18,370
then I'm going to go down under
the college football hall of fame,

226
00:14:18,371 --> 00:14:21,870
but I don't think I'm going to make it
again today because I gotta get out of

227
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,200
the fucking elliptical,

228
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,900
burn off all the food I ate
yesterday. I didn't do bad. I,

229
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:31,000
I eat the fish yesterday
and I got to tell you,

230
00:14:31,001 --> 00:14:35,080
the catering on this movie has been out
fucking standing. It's been delicious.

231
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,690
You know,
I dunno what,

232
00:14:37,691 --> 00:14:41,050
what catering has gone to another
level since I started doing my, uh,

233
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,950
my three lines per movie acting career.
You know,

234
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:49,030
why don't they have awards for that?
For people like me on movies,

235
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:51,680
you know,
they,

236
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,860
they have best supporting actor.
Right?

237
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:57,470
But you mean you still got to be
like a major part of the movie.

238
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:02,450
What about people like me?
Where's my award? Not even
my award. Just an award show.

239
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:06,740
They should do that. Just have it on
youtube. And they just have, right.

240
00:15:06,741 --> 00:15:11,270
You have a house nobody's heard of and a
bunch of actors you can't fucking name.

241
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:15,310
You know, and then you
let people vote, you know,

242
00:15:15,311 --> 00:15:20,311
best two lines in a movie
for 2017 and I dunno,

243
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:24,050
whatever award you, you win. It's like
made out of chocolate or something.

244
00:15:24,051 --> 00:15:26,500
He eat it or something. I don't know
what it is. Maybe it's a little,

245
00:15:26,501 --> 00:15:30,450
it's a shot of, it's
a flask. I don't know.

246
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:33,330
I don't pretend to understand
these fucking things. Anyways,

247
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:37,360
guess what I'm doing next week? Everybody,
other than seeing my beautiful family,

248
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,320
spending every fucking second with them,
um,

249
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:45,790
is I am going to be playing the surf
ball when ballroom, I'm sorry, in Iowa.

250
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:50,800
And this is where, uh, you
know, uh, uh, buddy Holly,

251
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:54,580
the big bopper and Richie
Valens all did their last show.

252
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:57,730
It's a little fucking more, but
you know, but I want to go there.

253
00:15:57,731 --> 00:15:59,230
I want to see it right.

254
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:04,900
And I'm flying right into the same airport
that they took off from and crashed.

255
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:08,840
And everybody is dude, what
the fuck? And it's like they,

256
00:16:08,841 --> 00:16:13,210
they had ice on their wings.
That's what happened.

257
00:16:13,211 --> 00:16:16,330
That's why they crashed there to enter
an experienced pilot and they had ice on

258
00:16:16,331 --> 00:16:19,390
the wings and they didn't have the,
they didn't have the technology back then,

259
00:16:19,391 --> 00:16:20,290
the spray,
the chemicals.

260
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:24,520
So I'm going to go out on a limb and
say that I'm going to be all right. Um,

261
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:25,811
so anyways,

262
00:16:25,811 --> 00:16:30,220
I'm going to be doing that
on a Thursday of next week.

263
00:16:30,221 --> 00:16:34,690
And then Friday, Saturday, I mean one of
my favorite God damn cities in the world,

264
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,510
Milwaukee, Wisconsin. All right.

265
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:40,900
And a Dean del Ray's going
to be doing the Thursday one.

266
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:46,670
And then I got forsee and nick
in Milwaukee,

267
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,160
Versie,
Bart,

268
00:16:49,161 --> 00:16:53,330
nick and myself and one of
my favorite cities ever.

269
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:58,310
And, uh, I have to somehow try to
maintain being sober. I'm going to do it,

270
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:01,790
I'm going to do it, but I don't know
how much fucking longer I can go.

271
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:05,270
I get 70 days in.
All right.

272
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,150
You know what it is,
is I know when I have that next drink,

273
00:17:09,151 --> 00:17:12,830
then I'm just going to be on again
for another two fucking years.

274
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:14,061
That's what I'm hoping.

275
00:17:14,061 --> 00:17:17,900
What I can do is I'm going just what
I'm going to do when I come back,

276
00:17:17,901 --> 00:17:20,750
when I returned after this injury,
right.

277
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:25,160
When I make my return to
the big leagues of Boosie,

278
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:30,790
I would like to fuck and I would like to
boos the way I smoked cigars now cause

279
00:17:31,401 --> 00:17:32,780
I got that under control.

280
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:38,060
Like I smoke a cigar like
once every fucking three
weeks or something like that.

281
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:42,260
That's how, right, right. 12 to
15 a year. I'm so full of Shit.

282
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:45,530
I've smoked more than that this year, but
whatever, I at least I make an attempt.

283
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:51,150
Okay. The third base coach with with
the cigars is holding people up.

284
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,231
All right.

285
00:17:52,231 --> 00:17:56,610
But that fucking lunatic with the booze
is just waving me around every time.

286
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,610
Um, I dunno, I gotta be honest with you,

287
00:18:02,611 --> 00:18:06,480
having a kids a great way to fucking
not drink. You know what I mean?

288
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:09,900
You can't just sit there getting drunk
when you have a kid in the house.

289
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:15,050
And plus even if you do like a moron the
next more and your kid's going to wake

290
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:18,780
up at like seven in the morning and
they don't give a fuck about a hangover.

291
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:24,390
Um, so I guess it's just one,

292
00:18:24,391 --> 00:18:25,224
I'm on the road.

293
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,840
I don't know what it is or maybe
I just like booze and do you know,

294
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:32,160
it's all of that shit. I really
enjoy it. I miss it. You know,

295
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:37,620
I think I'm going to sober dial
my fucking my booze itself.

296
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,290
Um, anyway, so I'm going to be doing that.

297
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:44,190
And then I go up to Green Bay and uh,

298
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:49,250
and then that Monday night bump up bubbles
though to go to green bay as a Monday

299
00:18:49,651 --> 00:18:54,170
night football game that I was going
to go to with fuzzy and Bart. Nick. Um,

300
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,130
you know, I can't even say, unfortunately,

301
00:18:56,370 --> 00:19:00,870
I got to get back to do my last
three days on the movie and um,

302
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,300
so I can't make that one.
But Jesus Christ,

303
00:19:03,301 --> 00:19:05,700
if you're not going to go to Lambeau
field, it's a pretty good excuse, right?

304
00:19:05,701 --> 00:19:08,400
Because you're going to be in a great
fucking movie starring Hugh Jackman called

305
00:19:08,401 --> 00:19:12,000
front runner. There'll be coming out
in 2018 please tell all your friends,

306
00:19:12,001 --> 00:19:15,180
please go to the movie
theaters and go see it. Um,

307
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,630
who knows if the schedule changes,
maybe I'll get to go.

308
00:19:18,631 --> 00:19:21,960
But I think for ASEAN part, nick is
still going to go. Um, and that's it.

309
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:22,561
Other than that,

310
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:24,930
I don't think I have anything left
to tell you other than my shoulders

311
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:27,540
completely fucked up again.
Uh,

312
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,920
I turned the corner with
my rotator cuff and um,

313
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,600
that I went too far.
I don't know if it was cause I did dip,

314
00:19:34,601 --> 00:19:39,601
so I tried to do a pull up with
one of those fucking assist bands,

315
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,630
things, you know, I tried to do,

316
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,590
I just pushed it too far and then
I got to start all over again.

317
00:19:46,591 --> 00:19:50,910
It's fucking frustrating, but how are they
going to do what? You can't do it. Hey,

318
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,190
you know,
it's fucking annoying.

319
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,690
So two years sag nerve last year and
I got my fucking shoulder, you know,

320
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:02,280
but fortunately I had been eating like
a lady, some staying in shape here.

321
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:06,120
Alright Indochina, everybody. Ah, we're
doing the reeds here and don't cheat.

322
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:09,330
Oh fuck you. Fuck the
reads. You know something?

323
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,980
I was reading this
thing about this couple,

324
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:15,510
that mountain climbs and they were
trying to climb one of the more difficult

325
00:20:15,511 --> 00:20:18,060
ones where you're literally
walking in the jet stream.

326
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,810
It was wind was blowing so bad
they couldn't sleep at night.

327
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:28,100
So of course one of these fucking morons
gets lifted up in the air by the wind,

328
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,490
slammed down between two rocks.

329
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:36,990
Her foot gets stuck in between the rocks
and then the wind is blowing so hard,

330
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:39,930
it twists her body around and
she breaks her fucking leg.

331
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:45,260
Now the other two fucking jerk offs who
were also completely safe before they

332
00:20:46,531 --> 00:20:48,010
decided out of out

333
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:52,300
of the bucket on a nowhere
to put their lives at risk,

334
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,553
right?

335
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:59,020
With absolutely no respect for anybody
else in the world who gets tortured,

336
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:02,900
who lives in these horrible fucking war
torn conditions. You know what I mean?

337
00:21:02,901 --> 00:21:05,740
And all they want to do is just
be able to come home and be safe.

338
00:21:05,741 --> 00:21:07,720
These two fucking free morons

339
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:11,840
decide that they're going to go up.

340
00:21:11,841 --> 00:21:15,350
They were deliberately put their lives
at risks and now the other two assholes

341
00:21:15,351 --> 00:21:20,240
have to carry this lady down with their
spiral fracture taking turns while

342
00:21:20,241 --> 00:21:21,740
walking into the jet stream.

343
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:25,370
And I don't know what I'm supposed to be
doing during this when I'm reading this,

344
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,300
my supposed to be thinking, wow, what
incredible human beings. I don't,

345
00:21:29,301 --> 00:21:33,740
I just think what a couple of fucking
morons because then some poor bastard has

346
00:21:33,741 --> 00:21:38,540
to fly a helicopter up there and try
and meet them and risk his fucking life.

347
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:44,720
I just, I dunno, I don't know how
people in the coast guard do it.

348
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:48,050
I don't know how these people in like
helicopters around the fucking world,

349
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:52,730
their job. What is your job, sir?

350
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:57,680
What is your job man? We on what is
my job? Oh, I rescue fucking morons.

351
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:02,130
Okay.

352
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:07,110
You have, I mean the fire department has
that too. To a certain extent. You know,

353
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:09,300
somebody sitting there
smoking a cigarette,

354
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:14,220
eating a pop tart and bed nod off and he
lights his fucking bed on fire, right?

355
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,670
Then they got to go in there and go
get the guys he's hiding in the closet,

356
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,760
you know with the frosted still around
his lips. It's starting to melt.

357
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,380
They have to go in there.
They got to go get the guy.

358
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,950
I don't know. Do you want to talk
about fucking hero? How does,

359
00:22:29,951 --> 00:22:30,784
how do they do that?

360
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:37,560
You'd have to go risk your
life to save a fucking moron.

361
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,860
Is there making the call? Yeah. Hey, what?
Hey My, my wife broke her leg. I got,

362
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,480
Oh yeah. Where are you?
Where's your house? Oh Nah,

363
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:53,300
we climbed up a mountain.
The fuck did you do that for it?

364
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:59,100
Oh God, I would love to take those calls.
What the fuck did you do that for? Great.

365
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:01,260
Great. So now that, let me guess.

366
00:23:01,261 --> 00:23:04,560
Now you want us to go up there
and go get a fucking moron.

367
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:12,110
You know, we should leave
you up there, right? You, you
know, you deserve that. Right?

368
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:18,100
Do you understand the person flying
up there and the helicopter, isn't it?

369
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:19,460
It's expecting it.

370
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,680
It's becoming a father and another month
and he might not make it because you

371
00:23:23,681 --> 00:23:28,681
fucking idiots left a perfectly good
hotel room and decided to climb up there.

372
00:23:28,721 --> 00:23:32,920
So what? You could talk loudly about it
in a bar with your frostbitten cheeks.

373
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,830
You dumb cunts.
Tell you what?

374
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:40,000
Walking of a thousand feet down the
fucking mountain, I'll check the forecast.

375
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:41,470
Maybe I'll pick you up in a week.

376
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:48,620
I guess you got to be cut out for
that job. I don't know. All right.

377
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,600
And don't cheat.

378
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,030
Okay.

379
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:54,160
All right. Talk about how every man
looks better in a suit. You know,

380
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,130
every day I'm checking out
guys walking by, you know,

381
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,093
you know,

382
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:03,310
I like a nice George Michael Stubble.
I'm not going to lie to you, right?

383
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:06,050
But I gotta be honest with you.
You know,

384
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:10,210
nothing makes me want to give my number
to another man, like a man in a suit.

385
00:24:10,211 --> 00:24:12,690
Jesus Christ or they look good.
Um,

386
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:17,820
Indo Chino is making it easy to get a
perfectly tailored suit and an incredible,

387
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:21,090
I was just picturing a guy in his
suit doing that. Stupid Michael, uh,

388
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:24,640
whatever his fucking name is. Is it
Michael got ahead, fade the faith,

389
00:24:24,641 --> 00:24:29,370
the faith when they're polled on his too.
I like to wear his shown.

390
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:34,390
Anyone like fucking Joe
Pesci in Goodfellas. Endo.

391
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,170
I was making it easy to get a perfectly
tailored suit and an incredible price.

392
00:24:38,171 --> 00:24:43,171
You can choose from hundreds of top
quality fabrics and personalize your suit

393
00:24:43,301 --> 00:24:46,240
just the way you want it.
Who the fuck knows about fabrics?

394
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:47,450
Yeah.

395
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:51,580
Well then I got to learn about
that. I know. I don't want wool.

396
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,930
I know. I don't want it to
be so shiny that when I walk,

397
00:24:56,931 --> 00:25:00,890
you can hear me coming as I
come down the fucking I'll,

398
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,750
um, anyways, whether it's for work,
a wedding or other special occasions,

399
00:25:05,751 --> 00:25:10,751
Indochino has suited up hundreds of
thousands of men and are now the largest

400
00:25:11,421 --> 00:25:16,310
made to measure men's
wear brand in the world.

401
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:21,740
Here's how it works.
We get a bunch of silk worms.

402
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:22,800
Okay.

403
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,360
All right.
And we booed him right in the ass.

404
00:25:24,361 --> 00:25:26,340
And then I'll come to the fucking silk,
right?

405
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:30,070
Isn't like silk from like
this spittle of a God. Damn.

406
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,160
You got to admit

407
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,940
intelligence. A human being. So, you
know, I'm not saying I'm one of them,

408
00:25:35,941 --> 00:25:37,140
but how the fuck do you see?

409
00:25:37,141 --> 00:25:42,000
See some God damn little worm minding
its own God damn business making a little

410
00:25:42,001 --> 00:25:45,000
spider web, whatever the fuck it is
they do. And you like, you know what?

411
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:47,730
I bet I could take that stuff
and make a shirt out of it.

412
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,690
Um,
visit a shoe.

413
00:25:56,430 --> 00:26:01,430
Visit our showroom or
shop online@indochino.com
do these fucking brutal

414
00:26:03,711 --> 00:26:07,100
silkworms realize that
they're working in a factory.

415
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:13,270
They give them a little cute lunch pails.
Did they get two weeks vacation a year?

416
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:16,330
That's what I'm asking you. I'm sure
somebody is doing a documentary on it.

417
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,650
Pick your fabric.

418
00:26:17,651 --> 00:26:22,651
Choose your customizations from lapels
to pleats to jacket linings in more

419
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,320
pleats.
What do we know Molly Ringwald movies

420
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:32,400
of those pleaded fucking pants, that
dead guy from uh, the two guys in,

421
00:26:32,401 --> 00:26:35,690
in fucking Charlie Sheen in a pizza place.

422
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:40,900

478
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,870
I get all these great photos and
I don't even know where they go.

479
00:30:10,871 --> 00:30:14,080
They just go into a fucking
hard drive somewhere. Um,

480
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:17,020
like I was just thinking if I get a

replaced that photo that
I have on Twitter, I don't
know where the original is.

ocean right now. You know what?

485
00:30:32,681 --> 00:30:36,250
Ours is probably in Thailand. Some

00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:39,490
And he's going, who the fuck is this

someone finally decided to do something

491
00:30:54,911 --> 00:30:59,911
about it and no legged alcoholic who
lost both his legs to the disease.

492
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:05,560
Uh, next please mention all the
talking points both below. Well,

00:33:06,171 --> 00:33:09,110
I don't know what I'm saying
in this makes no sense.

524
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:13,970
The vice president's name is Mike parents.
Me undies makes undies.

525

Your Butt will be proud to wear.

It's time to make your ass proud again
with a pair of me undies and check this

528
00:33:23,961 --> 00:33:27,350
out. I'm not the only one who loves
me undies. You know I love me undies.

529
00:33:27,351 --> 00:33:30,650
It's not even their underwear. I
just like singing, you know? Um,

530
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:32,900
you know I could barely carry a tune.

531
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:38,620
Listened to what my longtime listeners
in me undies enthusiast George has to say

532
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:43,130
a note from George and bill,
burr listener and be undies fan.

533
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,300
This is how much you guys,

534
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:47,510
so how much you guys have
done a solid with me on this.

535
00:33:47,511 --> 00:33:48,710
You guys actually write them,

536
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:52,820
telling them how much you liked my songs
to the point they're now sending me

537
00:33:52,821 --> 00:33:56,840
your fucking tweets or
Instagram's whatever the fuck
you sent it to him and now

538
00:33:56,841 --> 00:33:59,510
this is part of the copy I guess.
Anyways,

539
00:33:59,511 --> 00:34:03,710
this is from George and who allegedly
exists and wrote this and this is not from

540
00:34:03,711 --> 00:34:04,970
some advertising company.

541
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:10,100
I decided to try me undies because I
love Bill Burns me on these jingles.

542
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:14,390
I smile every time he sings it.
A man wrote that.

543
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,220
Now,
if this was a lady,

544
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:20,390
I believe that a lady would be emotionally
open enough to say that I smile every

545
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:24,290
time he sings it. I think
this has been edited. Um,

546
00:34:24,291 --> 00:34:27,620
although it's so easy to
skip ads in a podcast,

547
00:34:27,621 --> 00:34:32,510
I always capital's listened to bill's
reads and I'm so glad me undies has stuck

548
00:34:32,511 --> 00:34:32,870
with them.

549
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:36,470
It's probably been two years since I
first bought a pair of me undies and now I

550
00:34:36,471 --> 00:34:40,430
have a monthly subscription
because they are that comfortable.

551
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:43,730
Doesn't this Raul read is
phony before me undies.

552
00:34:43,731 --> 00:34:48,320
I used to buy the three pack of underwear
at the retail stores until I realized

553
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:52,550
that I wanted to treat my junk to
something more comfortable and that starts

554
00:34:52,551 --> 00:34:55,820
with a great pair of undies,
cradling my family jewels.

555
00:34:55,821 --> 00:34:59,090
This is so fucking written
by their advertising teams.

556
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,980
I know you guys are right in a men.

557
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:03,350
I know you're writing these
guys telling you like,

558
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:06,170
I mean that there's no fucking
way you write it that eloquently.

559
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:09,260

calling bullshit. But anyways,

564
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,760
I got to work in my little workout.
I'm going to go put,

565
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:35,420
put on my pink legwarmers you know,
and do a couple of,

566
00:35:35,421 --> 00:35:36,350
but blasters

567
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:43,590
all I do now is I just get on
the elliptical. That's all I do.

568
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:47,160
And I put on my fucking, uh, you guys
want to hear about what? My Cardio,

569
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:52,590
this is my cardio. I like to listen
to mindless music when I'm on,

570
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,960
you know,
I finally have given into gym music.

571
00:35:54,961 --> 00:35:58,950
Like I used to walk around the gym and
I'd be like, oh, why are they playing?

572
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:03,780
Pour some sugar on me? It's like, you know
what it, cause it's actually, you know,

573
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:04,800
I go through different periods.

574
00:36:04,801 --> 00:36:08,820
Sometimes I even want to listen
to a fucking absolutely genius,

575
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:14,910
um, album or something like that.
Or I just don't even want to think.

576
00:36:14,911 --> 00:36:17,970
And lately I don't want to fucking
think and I know what it is,

577
00:36:17,971 --> 00:36:19,140
is because I'm missing my family.

578
00:36:19,141 --> 00:36:21,870
That's what it is that I mentioned
that 5,000 fucking times.

579
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:27,000
So right now I just want to go into
like, you know, it's like, why, you know,

580
00:36:27,001 --> 00:36:30,720
I like washing dishes. It's fucking
mindless. You know what I mean?

581
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:34,780
The gray bar by the water in the tank,
what the top and I fucking scrub

582
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:38,350
until it's clean and it's just gives you
something to do, something to focus on.

583
00:36:38,351 --> 00:36:41,170
Like why can't I get
that fucking brand flake?

584
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:44,470
It looks like now it's been
sandblasted under this bowl here.

585
00:36:44,471 --> 00:36:48,380
Why can't I get that off? You know,
you get a little anger out. Um,

586
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:52,780
here, here is my, um, my mindless music.

587
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:58,180
I listened to feel it's steel feel.
It's still from Portugal, the man

588
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:06,040
[inaudible] [inaudible] bag up
and my common add a left field,

589
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:08,890
he kind of got, got, got, got Goo Goo

590
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:12,600
that gets me,
it gets me through the first five minutes.

591
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:17,130
And then I listened to mark
Ronson, uptown funk. Ugh,

592
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:22,470
this is the same song, the same
song they write every summer, right?

593
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:28,470
Boop, boop. Do we do, oh, I listen to
that shit, right. Slightly embarrassed.

594
00:37:28,471 --> 00:37:33,420
But I listened to it and then I listened
to the honey drippers rocking at

595
00:37:33,421 --> 00:37:36,570
midnight.
And uh,

596
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:40,320
then I just have a bunch of Tom Petty,
and this isn't mindless music,

597
00:37:40,321 --> 00:37:43,650
but I'm Kinda stop and listen to that.
I kind of switch off.

598
00:37:43,651 --> 00:37:47,520
Then I've listened to three mindless
songs in a row and I love Tom Petty,

599
00:37:47,521 --> 00:37:51,460
but he just died. So it makes
me sad. So I just saw primus.

600
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:54,990
So after those three mindless songs,
I then go into,

601
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:57,630
I go into awesome music
music that I really like.

602
00:37:57,631 --> 00:38:01,470
I'll listen to prime mis or Mars Volta,
my new favorite band.

603
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,450
Fucking dope found out about him fucking
15 years after they were together.

604
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:10,710
So stupid. Um, so anyways, and that's
when I have to go do so everybody,

605
00:38:10,711 --> 00:38:14,100
you guys want to share with me your
little cardio fucking lists. I need you.

606
00:38:14,101 --> 00:38:14,491
I need,

607
00:38:14,491 --> 00:38:19,491
I need another three fucking songs as
mindless as those first three that I just

608
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:25,080
sent to you. They're
silly. They're happy in.

609
00:38:25,081 --> 00:38:27,000
Next thing you know, I looked
down and all I had, you know,

610
00:38:27,001 --> 00:38:28,890
I only do like a half hour,
you know what I mean?

611
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:34,470
I only do a half hour because these needs
have to last me a lifetime. All right,

612
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:36,330
I'm done. This bullshit. Um,

613
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,980
there's gonna be a little music here and
you're probably not going to know what

614
00:38:38,981 --> 00:38:43,000
the music is and I'm not going to
know what it is either because Andrew

615
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,360
Feminists, uh, you know, he goes deep,
he goes deep into the music world.

616
00:38:46,361 --> 00:38:47,710
So if you have any questions,

617
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:53,010
just ask what song it is on our
Twitter app at the m m podcast.

618
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:58,540
All right. And ask Andrew and they very
polite, respectful way, what the song is.

619
00:38:58,541 --> 00:39:02,860
I'm sure he'll get back to you. All
right. And uh, then we'll play after that.

620
00:39:02,861 --> 00:39:07,440
There'll be another half hour of this
podcast, a classic half hour, uh, of,

621
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:10,990
of classic clips from my Thursday
afternoon, just before Friday,

622
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:15,130
Monday morning podcast that, um, I
dunno, maybe from earlier this year,

623
00:39:15,131 --> 00:39:16,960
maybe from three years ago.
I have no idea.

624
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:20,500
You might even listen to me talking about
how much fun I had boobs in the night

625
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:25,470
before, you know, uh, that's
it. All right. Have a great
weekend. Your cuts and uh,

626
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,380
I'll talk to you on Monday.

627
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:48,423
Yeah.

628
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:05,700
Anyways,
I get them into the biggest,

629
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:10,320
dumbest fucking fight last
night with my girl, right?

630
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:14,640
We had this great day, you
know, everything's going great.

631
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:20,070
So I stay in, I take a night
off from comedy and I said,
hey, why don't we watch,

632
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,920
why don't we watch a movie?
You know what I mean?

633
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:27,210
Cap Off this wonderful fucking
day. Everything's going
great. What could go wrong?

634
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:30,450
This is like the beginning of a horror
movie where they just show like the

635
00:40:30,451 --> 00:40:33,990
perfect family and everything's great
and people are wearing like white linen,

636
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:35,580
you know,

637
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:38,820
and then all of a sudden they just start
showing the camera and the bushes like

638
00:40:38,821 --> 00:40:43,440
a POV of like Mike Myers. This
is basically what happened.
So 60 minutes comes on,

639
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:46,980
right? Who doesn't want to watch that
show and pretend they're smart? You know,

640
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:52,170
I like it some more Morley
safer comes on and you know,

641
00:40:52,171 --> 00:40:55,260
we smells like an old person. Some old
people don't smell like old people,

642
00:40:55,261 --> 00:40:57,930
but he looks like he smells
like an old person, you know,

643
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:03,990
smells of cigars, ash trays,
you know, couple of wars,

644
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:06,240
maybe a date rape.
Um,

645
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:12,990
so he's interviewing Meryl Streep,
all right.

646
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:14,520
The Great Meryl Streep,

647
00:41:14,521 --> 00:41:18,330
and they're going through all our of
oral frigging life and all the movies and

648
00:41:18,331 --> 00:41:22,290
all the different characters that she's
played. Oh, first of all, they start,

649
00:41:22,291 --> 00:41:27,180
they start the report off with
Morley safer just sitting there,

650
00:41:27,181 --> 00:41:31,830
right. Smelling a fucking Ben
Gay in whiskey. Right. And, uh,

651
00:41:31,831 --> 00:41:33,290
he says, how, you know

652
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:38,690
how over in England, you
know, they, you know, I dunno,

653
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,850
they make their,
their actors,

654
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:44,030
they award them by calling
them lords and they night them.

655
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:45,890
But over here at America,

656
00:41:45,891 --> 00:41:49,010
all we do is just give him the
shiny statue and it's just like,

657
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:52,880
starts off right off the bat for
some reason just shitting on America.

658
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:58,780
I don't know why like an
Oscar is somehow beneath sir,

659
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:05,300
uh, Anthony Michael Hall. I mean,
or, or Lord what it Lord of what,

660
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:10,820
what a what lease.
You can fucking hold our statue,

661
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:13,160
your lord of what kingdom.

662
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:18,290
That phony horse shit that you have
with Prince Charles and the popper or

663
00:42:18,291 --> 00:42:21,200
whatever the fuck is going on over there.
You know,

664
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:26,600
look up the Rothschild's night you over
there, then that fucking means something.

665
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:30,260
Then you can come become part of their
yacht convoy as they go around the world

666
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:34,880
figuring out how to take over another
currency, right? Then you're in with them.

667
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:38,510
Okay. But if you're, if you're fucking,
you know, Lord of this and your,

668
00:42:38,511 --> 00:42:41,600
your wing man is the Duke of Elton John.

669
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:43,550
I mean it's a whole thing
is fucking stupid, right?

670
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,530
So right off the bat
it's already bugging me.

671
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:48,740
But I know Nia hates when I talk
to the TV, right. So I, you know,

672
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:54,200
I keep my big fucking Yap shut and they
start talking about Meryl Streep up the

673
00:42:54,201 --> 00:42:55,400
buck on to the whole thing.

674
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:59,720
And then I'm the old guy
there smelling of a, you know,

675
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:04,340
prescription meds goes, uh,
you know, whenever they talk
about the roles you play,

676
00:43:04,341 --> 00:43:08,030
they always say, you know,
you play independent minded
women, very strong women.

677
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:11,570
And Merrill goes, I know
that's, yeah, that's what they
say. You know, when a guy,

678
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:15,770
they never say to a guy, oh, you're
playing a strong willed character,

679
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:19,790
Yadda Yadda Yadda. I let that go.
Whatever, no Biggie, I'll take dead.

680
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:24,410
It's probably true. The fuck do
I know I'm not a woman. Right.

681
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:29,510
But then they show her after she played
Margaret Thatcher and she's given a

682
00:43:29,511 --> 00:43:33,950
speech to a bunch of women's young girls
and she's trying to inspire them and

683
00:43:33,951 --> 00:43:34,250
she,

684
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:38,630
she takes a quote from Margaret Thatcher
and it was something along the lines of

685
00:43:38,631 --> 00:43:40,670
if you want a bunch of
people to talk around,

686
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:44,570
talk is staying around and talking
about doing something. You know,

687
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:48,170
something, a goal, you got to talk to men,

688
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:50,900
but if you want it to actually get done,

689
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:55,730
you got to get a woman and then all the
chicks go, Woo, like flipping out. Right?

690
00:43:55,731 --> 00:43:59,540
So I laughed and I'm like,
Yay. Reverse sexism, right.

691
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:05,150
Just seeing, you know, my,
my whole fucking theory,

692
00:44:05,151 --> 00:44:06,890
how everybody is just a piece of shit.

693
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:10,430
You just don't have the power to act
out what the fuck you want to do because

694
00:44:10,431 --> 00:44:14,000
that, that right there, if
you flip that around as a guy,

695
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:17,670
if you're running for president,
it's fucking over. He can't be like,

696
00:44:17,671 --> 00:44:19,190
let me tell you.
I'll tell you what,

697
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:23,750
after I get you jobs and after
I fixed this economy, okay.

698
00:44:23,751 --> 00:44:26,180
And I'm the man to do it
because I'll tell you right now,

699
00:44:27,770 --> 00:44:31,350
if you're looking for someone to stand
around and talk about doing something,

700
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,510
you get a woman.
You want to get it done.

701
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:37,080
You gotta get a man here on my nuts
right here on the podium, volt from me,

702
00:44:37,081 --> 00:44:39,630
November 4th go fuck
yourself. Right? You did that.

703
00:44:39,631 --> 00:44:43,950
Your presidential campaigns over.
She does it. It's fucking adorable.

704
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:47,850
And it's just as fucking ignorant.
You know what I mean?

705
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:52,050
What a fuck do you get off saying
that we stand around and do nothing.

706
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:56,070
Meryl Streep. Huh? Or quoting Margaret
and you knew to Margaret Thatcher.

707
00:44:58,060 --> 00:44:58,860
Okay,

708
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:02,220
let me tell you, you bitches something.
Alright, we faked a fucking lunar landing.

709
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:08,040
Okay? You think that's just talking.
Anybody can land on the fucking moon.

710
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:08,880
That's easy.

711
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:13,650
But to pretend you did it all right and
get everybody to shut the fuck up about

712
00:45:13,651 --> 00:45:16,990
it. That, that, that, that right there,
that takes skill. So what happens?

713
00:45:16,991 --> 00:45:20,940
So I make that little comment and um, did
I just go with that? That, that, that,

714
00:45:20,941 --> 00:45:23,300
that, that's the only
fucking porky pig. So,

715
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:26,280
so I make that comment and like,
you know,

716
00:45:26,281 --> 00:45:29,100
I've been with Nia long enough that I
can tell by the side of her face when

717
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:30,630
she's just thinking about like,

718
00:45:30,631 --> 00:45:33,630
what if I just grabbed everything I
really cared about and walked out of this

719
00:45:33,631 --> 00:45:37,980
house right now.
She got like that fucking mad at me,

720
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:39,803
you know?

721
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:41,160
Yeah.

722
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:44,740
And I'm like, she's just like,
right after the story was over,

723
00:45:44,741 --> 00:45:48,210
she just shut the fucking thing off.
And uh,

724
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:53,400
I don't happen excel. I'm walking to
seven 11 to get some ice cream. I haven't,

725
00:45:53,401 --> 00:45:58,380
I have not. I mean, what happened
was all going great. You know,

726
00:45:58,381 --> 00:45:59,400
am I the asshole there?

727
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:04,890
What am I am I suppose to just fucking
sit there with my mouth hanging open with

728
00:46:04,891 --> 00:46:07,950
drool coming out when I watch TV,
if somebody says something Douchey,

729
00:46:07,951 --> 00:46:12,530
I'm not supposed to say it.
Yeah. Whatever, whatever.

730
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:15,750
So I just finally just said, you know
what? Fuck this. I take the dog out.

731
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:20,460
I go around the block. What do I do?
I'm calling my guy friends. Right.

732
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:24,960
They're all backing me up. I'm not saying
who I called, I don't name names. Right.

733
00:46:26,070 --> 00:46:29,190
And they're all laughing their ass
off and they are 100% agree with me,

734
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:30,780
which is all I'm looking
for at this point.

735
00:46:30,781 --> 00:46:32,370
I just want people to say that I'm right.

736
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:36,120
I don't want to learn anything from this
experience. Just tell me I was right.

737
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:40,110
So it can be an ignorant ass again.
I don't know.

738
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:42,360
Why don't you guys weigh in on that?
Am I a Dick for saying that?

739
00:46:42,361 --> 00:46:46,800
Should I just let that one go? You
know? Uh, you know what she said?

740
00:46:46,801 --> 00:46:49,350
That fucking drove me up the
wall. She goes, why are you

741
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:51,650
okay?

742
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:52,970
She didn't say intimidated.

743
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:55,050
Okay.

744
00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:56,280
She used one of those words.

745
00:46:58,010 --> 00:46:58,500
Okay.

746
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:03,150
Why are you threatened by what she said?
It's like I'm not threatened.

747
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:07,380
I, yeah, Jesus Christ. Then
I take the bait. You don't,

748
00:47:07,381 --> 00:47:10,980
it just sends me right over there
like threatened about what? Oh my God.

749
00:47:10,981 --> 00:47:15,090
This person that I don't know who has
never called me, nor will ever call me,

750
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:18,420
who has no effect on my life.
How do you get threatened by that?

751
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:21,540
I'm just calling it for the bullshit
that it is, cause you know what?

752
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,400
This is what fucking drives me nuts.

753
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:28,410
I can't stand when somebody tells me
that they're shit sandwich tastes worse

754
00:47:28,411 --> 00:47:32,560
than my shit. Okay? Go Fuck Yourself.

755
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:37,210
At what point am I supposed to have
empathy as I'm sitting here eating a shit

756
00:47:37,211 --> 00:47:41,080
sandwich and you're telling me how
much worse yours, yours is. You know,

757
00:47:41,081 --> 00:47:44,950
at the end of the fucking day, you know
what I mean? Sure. Mine might be on,

758
00:47:45,310 --> 00:47:46,810
you know,
a better slice of bread,

759
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,230
which I guess would make it
taste a little bit better,

760
00:47:50,231 --> 00:47:53,290
but at the end of the fucking day,
right the end of the fucking day.

761
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:58,300
All right, I'm going to end up
in a FEMA camp with you. Okay?

762
00:47:58,301 --> 00:48:02,980
You think when the next fucking a psycho
comes along, I'm going to make the cut.

763
00:48:02,981 --> 00:48:07,840
What the fuck the wife, but what do
I bring to the world? Huh? Exactly.

764
00:48:07,970 --> 00:48:12,610
I'll be standing right next to you. So
go fuck yourself. You just fucking woman.

765
00:48:12,611 --> 00:48:16,360
Every time she sneezes, they
give her another God damn
award. She still pitching,

766
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:18,870
still fucking bitching.
You know?

767
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:21,820
I remember when I did this
Oscar nominated part out,

768
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:25,210
go fuck yourself with your wigs.
The whole thing. Just, you know,

769
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:28,690
that's what fucking pisses me
off when I watched this shit.

770
00:48:28,691 --> 00:48:32,560
If you really want to know my
perspective is from where I come from,

771
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:35,590
I can't bitch about shit cause
everybody's like, oh go fuck yourself.

772
00:48:35,591 --> 00:48:38,470
You hit the lottery. Right. But I got
to sit here and listen to you bitch.

773
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:43,450
Even if you're fucking killing it,
even if you're killing it, you know,

774
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:47,890
Yale School of drama and
he's still doing the bull.

775
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:52,510
Go Fuck yourself with your
God damn yachts. Alright,

776
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:55,360
there you go. That felt good.
It was probably ignorant.

777
00:48:56,780 --> 00:49:01,780
[inaudible]

778
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,890
dental assistant billion.
I recently,

779
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:28,210
I recently watched a talk show appearance.

780
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:31,990
You posted on your Twitter you
mentioned. Yeah, I did the, uh,

781
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:32,950
the Willie Hunter show.

782
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:34,893
MMM.

783
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,740
And I think that that's what I posted
when that fucking Twat that I'd like to

784
00:49:38,741 --> 00:49:43,610
choke to death with a garden hose
sent me that tweet. Um, yeah,

785
00:49:43,611 --> 00:49:44,920
it was on the Willie Hunter show.
And he said,

786
00:49:44,921 --> 00:49:49,570
you mentioned you were a dental
assistant, um, for your father.

787
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:52,330
Did you ever consider becoming a dentist?
Did you ever,

788
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:57,130
did your father ever have ambitions for
you to become anything in particular?

789
00:49:58,330 --> 00:50:02,710
Um, no. My Dad, my parents
were great. Like they,

790
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:06,220
they wanted you to base,
they didn't force anything on you.

791
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:08,440
It was like whatever you wanted to do.

792
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:10,513
MMM.

793
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:14,790
They supported it 100%.

794
00:50:14,791 --> 00:50:19,350
And I remember being working with my
dad in the dental office when I told him

795
00:50:19,351 --> 00:50:22,950
that I was going to become a comedian.
We were in like the break room.

796
00:50:23,010 --> 00:50:25,560
And I remember I was sitting
there like going like,

797
00:50:26,430 --> 00:50:31,400
how is this guy going to take
this when he has such a classic,

798
00:50:32,430 --> 00:50:32,760
okay,

799
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,410
like stable job here.

800
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:35,930
Okay.

801
00:50:35,930 --> 00:50:38,270
You know that I'm going to tell
him that I'm going to fucking

802
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:42,860
basically make a living,

803
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:48,850
try to make a living doing exactly what
he's been yelling at me for for the last

804
00:50:49,401 --> 00:50:50,870
fucking 20 years of my life,

805
00:50:50,871 --> 00:50:55,871
which was fucking off and acting like an
idiot and screwing around all the shit

806
00:50:56,121 --> 00:50:58,720
that you know when he
would give me Christ,

807
00:50:59,870 --> 00:51:03,080
you're in a town cloud,
what do you would be giving me shit,

808
00:51:04,410 --> 00:51:08,340
which I totally deserve because if you
ever saw the grades I got in school,

809
00:51:08,341 --> 00:51:12,990
I mean they, they, they are. They
are horrific. Fucking horrific.

810
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:18,270
The high water mark for me was
like a c minus or a c like I was.

811
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:20,063
It was brutal.

812
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:21,370
Yeah.

813
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:21,641
I went to,

814
00:51:21,641 --> 00:51:24,670
I had to go to summer school every
fucking year of high school except my

815
00:51:24,671 --> 00:51:29,560
sophomore year because my math teacher
hooked me up in my senior year.

816
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:32,470
I should have gone. I just didn't give
a fuck. I was like, what's the point?

817
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:36,250
You know what I mean? That's like, you
got the ball with 10 seconds left and you,

818
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:40,750
what are you going to do?
You just fucking, you know,
you're down by 30. Yeah.

819
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:43,750
Just throw up a half court shot. Did it go
in? Who gives a fuck? It doesn't matter.

820
00:51:43,751 --> 00:51:45,340
You know?
Um,

821
00:51:46,830 --> 00:51:47,340
yeah,

822
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:50,130
so no, I mean for half a second. You
know what, you know what I did like,

823
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:51,990
I liked the,
uh,

824
00:51:52,290 --> 00:51:56,220
I liked the pouring up
models when I was in a,

825
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:59,610
when I was in the dental office, that
was my favorite thing. I was in the back,

826
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:00,630
I was isolated,

827
00:52:00,631 --> 00:52:04,380
I wasn't around anybody and it tapped
into that little kid thing of playing in

828
00:52:04,381 --> 00:52:08,610
mud
and he used to pull it up

829
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:13,390
models and they had this vibrating thing
and you had to tap on it to make sure

830
00:52:13,391 --> 00:52:14,800
you got all the bubbles out.

831
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:19,840
And I prided myself on not being able,
you know,

832
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:24,100
of having it without no having no bubbles.
If you got bubbles,

833
00:52:24,101 --> 00:52:26,590
if there was bubbles on the
bottom, basically, you know,

834
00:52:26,591 --> 00:52:29,130
when they stick that pink shit in
your mouth and they got to take a, uh,

835
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:30,520
an impression of your teeth,

836
00:52:31,270 --> 00:52:34,120
then somebody's got to take that out
of your mouth going into the back room.

837
00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:35,081
And then you got it.

838
00:52:35,081 --> 00:52:39,400
You got to mix this powder with water
up in those little green rubber balls.

839
00:52:39,401 --> 00:52:40,930
Jesus,
this is all coming back to me.

840
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:45,550
And then you poured it into the
fucking impression you took.

841
00:52:45,551 --> 00:52:46,290
And then there was this,

842
00:52:46,290 --> 00:52:51,190
this thing that sounded exactly like
your cell phone vibrating on a table and

843
00:52:51,191 --> 00:52:54,790
you just, you just tapped it on that
to get all the air bubbles out of it.

844
00:52:55,720 --> 00:53:00,720
And if you didn't do it enough after one
of the things set and you took it out,

845
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:04,150
um,
if the bubbles were at the bottom,

846
00:53:04,151 --> 00:53:06,140
that's where the teeth were
the most crucial thing,

847
00:53:06,170 --> 00:53:10,750
the exact fucking thing that trying
to get a gauge on so they can,

848
00:53:10,751 --> 00:53:14,920
you know, whatever the hell
they were trying to do, make
a bridge or something. Um,

849
00:53:15,550 --> 00:53:17,020
the whole thing would be fucked.

850
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:22,740
And then you couldn't go and just rapport
the model into that same mold because

851
00:53:23,141 --> 00:53:26,490
somehow like it had shrunk up a little
bit and it wouldn't be accurate.

852
00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:28,950
And my dad used to flip out.

853
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:32,080
He would, he would take them
off and he'd be like, Christ,

854
00:53:32,081 --> 00:53:35,370
there's air bubbles and this,

855
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:41,260
you know, and it was beyond your boss
yelling at you. It was also my dad.

856
00:53:41,261 --> 00:53:43,570
So I already had,
you know,

857
00:53:43,571 --> 00:53:47,380
I was going through my fucking
teenage and early twenties.

858
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,740
When you're rebelling
the most against you.

859
00:53:49,741 --> 00:53:52,470
If I already had the live with the guy
and then I was working with the most

860
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:57,290
fucking hilarious and he
used to give me shit like,

861
00:53:57,291 --> 00:53:58,630
you know,
like I was his kid.

862
00:53:59,590 --> 00:53:59,860
Okay.

863
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:02,170
But we, we really have, we
actually talked about it,

864
00:54:02,171 --> 00:54:07,171
how we had to tone that shit down because
it didn't come off as professional in

865
00:54:07,181 --> 00:54:09,160
front of patients, so whatever. But um,

866
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:12,910
but that was a part I thought if I ever
got into dentistry that I would, I would,

867
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:14,350
I would work in the lab.

868
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:19,380
I liked that part of it, like, um,
and not just pouring up the models,

869
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:23,760
like the actual, I don't know, there
was a precision to it that I liked.

870
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,340
I didn't like to fight.
I didn't like the, uh,

871
00:54:26,341 --> 00:54:29,850
the front line shit going in the mouth
with all that crap and look at people's

872
00:54:29,851 --> 00:54:33,030
fucking horrific teeth,
just horrible fucking teeth.

873
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:35,370
All my jokes were about that shit.
When I first started.

874
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:38,310
I told you guys that story,
right?

875
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:42,120
I used to work totally clean
when I first started stand up.

876
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:46,320
Um, and not because I want
it to be this comedy purist.

877
00:54:46,321 --> 00:54:49,740
I just was afraid of offending
somebody in the crowd, getting heckled,

878
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:51,360
not having a comeback,

879
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:55,140
losing my place in my act and
then bombing horrifically.

880
00:54:56,230 --> 00:54:56,620
Okay.

881
00:54:56,620 --> 00:55:01,280
And, and just having my career
and total fear catastrophizing,

882
00:55:01,281 --> 00:55:04,550
like way of looking at it and um,

883
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:08,720
yeah. Oh, Jesus Christ.

884
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:10,850
Okay.

885
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:12,190
That really just fucking
brought me back to,

886
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:14,090
I was standing on stage at stick stitches.

887
00:55:14,091 --> 00:55:17,720
Fucking somebody heckled me
was that the vault and Boston,

888
00:55:17,721 --> 00:55:21,530
somebody had called me and I completely
lost my fucking train of thought and I

889
00:55:21,531 --> 00:55:25,420
had nothing and I didn't. And it took
me like basically three seconds to, to,

890
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:29,750
to re to remember what the fuck
I was talking about. And um,

891
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:32,600
it was the longest three
seconds in my life.

892
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:34,820
And I didn't know enough to
just say to the crowd like,

893
00:55:34,821 --> 00:55:37,600
what the fuck was I talking about? Because
they'll tell you, they'll remember it.

894
00:55:37,610 --> 00:55:39,610
They're not nervous,
they're listening. They,

895
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:44,180
they're not having like this outer
body experience. Um, but anyways,

896
00:55:44,270 --> 00:55:47,510
I remember people would come into the
dental office in their teeth would just be

897
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:48,373
just,

898
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:54,100
just what an absolute fucking mess.
And they can tell you right now,

899
00:55:54,130 --> 00:55:56,980
I hate coming to the dentist. And
it's like, yeah, dude, I can smell it.

900
00:55:57,010 --> 00:55:59,290
You don't have to smile. I can tell
you don't like coming to dentist.

901
00:55:59,291 --> 00:56:00,760
You only like fucking brushing your teeth.

902
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:02,010
Okay,

903
00:56:02,010 --> 00:56:04,620
well just one guy said this, one of the
first jokes I did. Oh, that's right.

904
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:09,600
So I will work totally fucking clean. And
then my last, at my end, just, you know,

905
00:56:09,601 --> 00:56:12,060
when I've looked like a young Ron Howard,

906
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:17,120
I looked like Richie Cunningham and I
was totally clean and I was clever and I

907
00:56:17,251 --> 00:56:21,780
had these perfect talk show monologue
jokes and everyone was gone. Like,

908
00:56:21,781 --> 00:56:24,070
oh dude, you're going to do
the tonight and this is going

909
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:28,060
to be perfect for and blah,
blah blah, blah, blah. And
then the last joke in my act,

910
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:34,290
I quoted this patient who kept having
to get fillings and root canals and he,

911
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:36,810
and he said, doc, you know, I don't
understand what's going on. I mean,

912
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:41,630
I brushed my teeth almost
every day and then my,

913
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:43,740
my snappy comeback to that,

914
00:56:43,741 --> 00:56:47,220
that I thought of that later became the
last joke of my act. I said, really deal.

915
00:56:47,221 --> 00:56:49,620
Wipe your ass almost every
time you take a shit.

916
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:53,280
And that's what I would close
with after working totally clean.

917
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,620
I would say that disgusting lie.

918
00:56:55,621 --> 00:56:58,980
Do you wipe your ass almost
every time you take a shit?

919
00:56:58,981 --> 00:57:03,981
Having everybody in the
crowd after looking at this
fucking Norman Rockwell come

920
00:57:05,251 --> 00:57:09,870
to life,
fucking character wholesome is hell,

921
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:10,853
right.

922
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:11,720
Yeah.

923
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:13,020
And I really was back then.

924
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:14,270
Okay.

925
00:57:14,270 --> 00:57:18,620
As opposed to the piece of shit that I
am now after 20 years on the road that I

926
00:57:18,621 --> 00:57:20,570
became,
um,

927
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:22,280
okay.

928
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:26,300
And I literally, they had to conjure
up pictures of somebody skipping,

929
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:30,380
wiping their ass. And just that whole,
and they would just literally recoil.

930
00:57:31,370 --> 00:57:32,900
Then I would just be like,
you know,

931
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:37,420
thanks a lot. Good night
everybody. You were great. And um,

932
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:39,140
okay.

933
00:57:39,140 --> 00:57:43,700
I had another horrible one that I did
where I actually brought a prop on stage

934
00:57:43,701 --> 00:57:44,410
and if you'd like to,

935
00:57:44,410 --> 00:57:49,410
to see that I tell the story on the
Willie Hunter show and a willys and up and

936
00:57:50,391 --> 00:57:54,680
coming comic at the comedy store.
If he's the guy who threw the Hula Hoop,

937
00:57:55,070 --> 00:57:58,580
took the hula hoop from that girl in,
fucking threw it into the street.

938
00:57:59,570 --> 00:58:02,360
I tell that story too. If you want
to see that shit, check out his show.

939
00:58:34,170 --> 00:58:36,850
Hey, what's going on? It's built.
And this is the Monday morning

940
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:41,340
cast for Monday, October 26th, 2009.

941
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:45,780
Holy Shit. Halloween's coming up. I
haven't even bought a pumpkin yet.

942
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:49,170
What the fuck is that all about?
Um,

943
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:56,030
how come there's not pumpkin's the whole
time of the year? All those things.

944
00:58:56,031 --> 00:59:01,010
Seasonal, you know, like tomatoes.
Evidently tomatoes are seasonal.

945
00:59:01,070 --> 00:59:04,640
We just don't realize that, which is why
they taste like shit 90% of the year,

946
00:59:05,330 --> 00:59:07,160
or according to Jimmy Dore,

947
00:59:07,550 --> 00:59:10,550
they pick them before they're even
ripe and they just paint them red.

948
00:59:11,810 --> 00:59:14,480
Um, is that true? I mean,

949
00:59:14,481 --> 00:59:17,450
how long would that take to sit there
with that little fucking Crayola?

950
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:22,690
It wouldn't, they taste like
wax wants deal with Pumpkins.

951
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:28,580
You can get Pumpkin Pie, the
whole euro, but you never see, um,

952
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:31,400
I've gone out of my fucking mind.
People, my voice is killing me.

953
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:35,900
I have something to do here
and fucking 40 minutes.

954
00:59:35,901 --> 00:59:39,860
So this is gonna be a quick podcast and
this time actually mean it because it's

955
00:59:39,861 --> 00:59:43,330
going to cost me money if I don't get
off the phone here in 40 minutes. Uh,

956
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:48,370
uh, where to start. Why
don't we just start with what
the hell is bugging me? Um,

957
00:59:48,650 --> 00:59:53,420
I almost got into a fistfight yesterday
and uh,

958
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:57,470
I realize that I'm at the awful age of,

959
00:59:58,780 --> 00:59:59,140
okay.

960
00:59:59,140 --> 01:00:01,390
It's basically anytime there's
going to be a fist fight,

961
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:04,600
I have these two options.
A,

962
01:00:05,350 --> 01:00:09,700
I lose and get the shit kicked
out of me, which really, you know,

963
01:00:09,701 --> 01:00:14,170
there's no end to that shit kicked out
of you. Could be, I got a black eye,

964
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:19,510
I lost the Tufa, you know, or it
could be I'm in a coma and you know,

965
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:22,150
the left side of my body doesn't
work anymore. You know what I mean?

966
01:00:22,151 --> 01:00:24,460
You never know cause you never know
who you're fucking with. Right.

967
01:00:24,610 --> 01:00:29,610
So that's option a and option B is I win
and then I get the shit suit out of me.

968
01:00:33,250 --> 01:00:36,910
Okay, I see. I'm so fucking
still pissed about this.

969
01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:40,480
I have to give you the abbreviated
version of this because it's,

970
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:44,350
it's been eating me up inside.
Um,

971
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:46,870
I was waiting for my girlfriend
to come out of this diner.

972
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:50,110
It's one of these places. There's only
one way in and one way out. All right,

973
01:00:50,290 --> 01:00:52,990
so there's a parking lot,
parking spot way down,

974
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:55,450
which is actually closer
to the fucking diner.

975
01:00:55,451 --> 01:00:58,450
And this Douche bag is sitting there
cause he sees my reverse lights on.

976
01:00:58,630 --> 01:01:00,880
So I'm waving at him to
tell him to go by me.

977
01:01:01,450 --> 01:01:03,490
So I can just back out of the fucking lot.

978
01:01:03,491 --> 01:01:05,730
And he's just sitting there sitting
there. He wouldn't do it. It's a fight,

979
01:01:05,731 --> 01:01:09,310
you know, I pull out real fast. It's like
a gravel parking lot, slam on the brakes,

980
01:01:09,311 --> 01:01:13,270
slide backwards and then fly forward.
Slam on the brakes. So he pulls in,

981
01:01:13,271 --> 01:01:16,630
obviously knows a piss and I back up and
I put the window down. I'm like, dude,

982
01:01:16,631 --> 01:01:19,840
there's a fucking spot right up there.
And then he immediately goes, oh,

983
01:01:19,841 --> 01:01:23,800
you're so tough with your hybrid. And
he really caught me off guard, man.

984
01:01:23,801 --> 01:01:25,810
He got me with a great money.
Went with the hybrid.

985
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:27,650
My Dick is bigger than yours because,
um,

986
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:31,780
he's driving a fucking lime green
four door sedan that he looked like he

987
01:01:31,781 --> 01:01:36,140
borrowed from his fucking ant, right? Oh,
this guy, he's just this, this fucking,

988
01:01:36,141 --> 01:01:37,060
you know what this guy looked like?

989
01:01:37,210 --> 01:01:40,510
Remember those coming of age movies in
the 80s where there was the good looking

990
01:01:40,511 --> 01:01:45,130
chick, ah, that the nerd wanted and
she was dating this impossible asshole.

991
01:01:45,250 --> 01:01:50,250
Like that blonde hair Douche from a back
to school who gets all intimidated in

992
01:01:50,321 --> 01:01:54,250
the end and fakes a leg injury after
fucking a 90 year old Rodney Dangerfield

993
01:01:54,251 --> 01:01:58,750
does a triple, triple Lindy. That's
what this kid looked like. All right,

994
01:01:58,751 --> 01:02:01,890
and he's gone fuck and blah blah
blah. And I'm like, Hey, yeah,

995
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:06,290
we'd get fucking tight shirt and your big
nose. Go Fuck Yourself. And he's like a,

996
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:09,100
and then he goes out, go back
to jersey, you piece of shit.

997
01:02:09,101 --> 01:02:12,250
That's what he said to me. Right?
And I wanted to go like, dude,

998
01:02:12,251 --> 01:02:15,430
I'm not from New Jersey, but my girl
jumped in and said something fucking,

999
01:02:16,270 --> 01:02:18,700
you know that a civilian would
say rather than a comedian.

1000
01:02:18,701 --> 01:02:21,060
So I actually started losing
the argument a little bit.

1001
01:02:21,061 --> 01:02:23,460
So then he turns around and then I
was just like, where are you going?

1002
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:24,840
Where you going? You know, like,

1003
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:29,300
like I was actually going to fight
them because I was so fucking mad. I

1004
01:02:30,370 --> 01:02:30,660
okay.

1005
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:33,210
But I, and the back of my head, the whole
fucking time, I'm thinking like, two,

1006
01:02:33,211 --> 01:02:35,760
what are you going to do? What? What do
you, what are you going to do to this guy?

1007
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:37,980
When was the last time you had a fight?

1008
01:02:38,010 --> 01:02:41,850
You're fucking 41 you're a year older than
Brett Farve. What are you going to do?

1009
01:02:41,930 --> 01:02:45,510
It's, it's not even on level ground.
It's in a gravel fucking parking lot.

1010
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:50,180
You know what I mean? I knew
I could have, I swear to God,

1011
01:02:50,181 --> 01:02:54,760
I know I could have fucking
killed this guy, but I will.

1012
01:02:54,790 --> 01:02:57,640
I can't do it. I'm going to die. I
already, you know what would've happened?

1013
01:02:57,641 --> 01:03:00,040
I would've fucking started fighting him.
Even if I started winning,

1014
01:03:00,041 --> 01:03:02,230
his girlfriend would
have jumped on my back.

1015
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:07,120
And then if you do any sort of get off
my back with a woman, I'm going to jail.

1016
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:13,660
You know? I just, it was
this fucking stalemate.

1017
01:03:13,661 --> 01:03:15,250
There was nothing I could fucking do.

1018
01:03:15,430 --> 01:03:19,090
And then I'm driving home and all I'm
thinking about is how much I want to

1019
01:03:19,091 --> 01:03:21,190
fucking kill this guy.
And it got to the point,

1020
01:03:21,191 --> 01:03:26,020
I literally dropped my girl off and I
drove back to the diner and his fucking

1021
01:03:26,021 --> 01:03:30,010
car was still there.
And I'm circling the diner in a hybrid

1022
01:03:33,290 --> 01:03:37,400
waiting for this guy to come out thinking
about what I'm going to do to him.

1023
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:41,540
And then also reminding myself that I
have not had a fight in about 20 fucking

1024
01:03:41,541 --> 01:03:43,790
years.
Okay.

1025
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:48,880
And then also reminded myself legally
the ramifications for leaving and then

1026
01:03:49,191 --> 01:03:50,120
fucking coming back.

1027
01:03:50,121 --> 01:03:54,080
I am in no danger whatsoever and I am
going to get the living shit sued out of

1028
01:03:54,081 --> 01:03:54,914
me.

1029
01:03:56,150 --> 01:04:00,530
So fortunately a friend of mine happened
to call up and I started telling her

1030
01:04:00,531 --> 01:04:04,820
the story and she was laughing her ass
off and she told the story of south.

1031
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:06,680
Some girl didn't hold the door,
you know,

1032
01:04:06,681 --> 01:04:08,370
it's one of those really
heavy doors and sort of,

1033
01:04:08,371 --> 01:04:11,480
and it's sort of slam back in her face.
And she said, thank you, you know,

1034
01:04:11,481 --> 01:04:14,330
sarcastically tour. And then
the girl goes, uh, what?

1035
01:04:14,331 --> 01:04:16,370
I don't have to hold the door for you.
Go Fuck Yourself.

1036
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:20,330
And how she just wanted a
sticker timberland through
the back of this fucking

1037
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:25,270
chicks back. I guess. Look
at me, I'm so fucking mad.

1038
01:04:25,271 --> 01:04:28,510
I can't even say simple anatomy.
So,

1039
01:04:29,810 --> 01:04:30,540
yeah,

1040
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:34,200
I just, I dunno, I was able to
just kind of talk myself out of it.

1041
01:04:34,201 --> 01:04:36,390
And the real thing was I didn't
want to go back and fight the guy.

1042
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:40,860
I really didn't, you know what I mean?
I really didn't. I did, but I didn't.

1043
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,880
There was just no, when it wasn't going
to do, you know, I got meetings this week,

1044
01:04:45,030 --> 01:04:47,250
I'm going to show up with a loose
tooth and a fucking, you know,

1045
01:04:47,340 --> 01:04:49,290
nobody bleeds like a redhead,
you know what I mean?

1046
01:04:50,190 --> 01:04:52,800
I'm going to look like fucking
ric flair walking in there.

1047
01:04:56,790 --> 01:05:00,010
There was nothing I could do.
I had to sit there and,

1048
01:05:00,310 --> 01:05:04,320
and I think I actually lost the back
and forth verbal thing, you know,

1049
01:05:04,350 --> 01:05:07,470
I'm so fucking shot from being on
the road. I just got off a flight.

1050
01:05:08,430 --> 01:05:12,040
I wanted to go straight home. My girl's
like, I'm hungry. Let's get some aid,

1051
01:05:12,090 --> 01:05:12,361
you know?

1052
01:05:12,361 --> 01:05:17,361
And I made a mental note to be extra
nice to my girl just because I've been

1053
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:20,340
an asshole lately,
you know,

1054
01:05:20,430 --> 01:05:23,190
which is probably why I got
into the argument to begin with.

1055
01:05:23,770 --> 01:05:28,520
But it's, it was, it, I literally there,

1056
01:05:28,540 --> 01:05:32,590
there's a,
there's a fucking reservoir or a lake,

1057
01:05:32,591 --> 01:05:36,250
whatever the fuck you call it, near
where I live. This is how mad I was

1058
01:05:37,810 --> 01:05:42,810
after my friend talked me out of not
doing what I didn't even want to do to

1059
01:05:43,211 --> 01:05:47,500
begin with. Right. Not to mention
the already had another guy with him,

1060
01:05:47,501 --> 01:05:51,400
I would've lost. I would've
fucking lost. Right. So, um,

1061
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:55,630
I had to go drive to the lake,

1062
01:05:56,020 --> 01:06:01,020
park my car and walk around the lake
in the first 90% of the walk around it.

1063
01:06:01,841 --> 01:06:06,280
I was fantasizing about all the different
ways that I was going to murder this

1064
01:06:06,281 --> 01:06:07,114
guy.

1065
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:12,490
I had one where I was body slamming
him onto his own fucking car,

1066
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:14,380
screaming some shit about hybrids.

1067
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:21,970
I completely like, I haven't been
that mad in so fucking long. And uh,

1068
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:26,320
it wasn't until the last 10%, you
know, I was kinda going like, you know,

1069
01:06:26,321 --> 01:06:31,090
you really took this walk to try
to forget about this shit. So what,

1070
01:06:31,110 --> 01:06:33,580
what is wrong with you?
You need to calm down.

1071
01:06:34,060 --> 01:06:39,060
So I started a fucking calm down and
then I saw my car again and reminded me I

1072
01:06:40,151 --> 01:06:43,480
was driving a hybrid in a fucking piss
me off again, be to just be one thing.

1073
01:06:43,481 --> 01:06:45,190
If the guy was driving a corvette,
you should have seen this car.

1074
01:06:45,191 --> 01:06:47,710
It wasn't lime green was actually
kind of a nice screen. Okay.

1075
01:06:47,711 --> 01:06:51,790
If I can actually extend an olive
branch to this fucking cunt.

1076
01:06:52,420 --> 01:06:55,600
But I mean it was, it was a
four door sedan. You know,

1077
01:06:55,660 --> 01:06:57,350
there was no excuse at his age.
You know,

1078
01:06:57,360 --> 01:07:00,070
he's like in his twenties there was no
fucking excuse for him to be driving that

1079
01:07:00,071 --> 01:07:03,160
car or certainly talking shit.
Right.

1080
01:07:04,870 --> 01:07:09,370
Also, I love that whole go back to Jersey
you piece of shit and like how he's the

1081
01:07:09,371 --> 01:07:14,230
typical La Guy, you know, judging you,
you know you are what you drive out here.

1082
01:07:14,231 --> 01:07:17,490
Cause I'm in a hybrid, therefore I don't
know how to fight and what you hit.

1083
01:07:17,730 --> 01:07:18,580
You know my car,

1084
01:07:18,610 --> 01:07:23,530
my car runs a hundred person I'd
guess fucking bring Bruce Lee on.

1085
01:07:23,531 --> 01:07:27,340
You know, he, what does he
got? A Rick Shah, you know, so.

1086
01:07:28,650 --> 01:07:31,200
So the last 10% I
started talk myself down.

1087
01:07:31,201 --> 01:07:35,400
It just so happened there was
an open house out here and a,

1088
01:07:35,401 --> 01:07:40,230
there happens to be a zillion houses
available out here because the state is

1089
01:07:40,231 --> 01:07:43,740
bankrupt and we live in a city without
a water supply and they still want $1

1090
01:07:43,740 --> 01:07:47,250
million for a house that is about the
size of a decent one bedroom apartment.

1091
01:07:48,330 --> 01:07:52,470
So a [inaudible] is a lot of open houses.
So I actually said,

1092
01:07:53,460 --> 01:07:57,240
I actually went into the open house and
looked at it and was thinking the entire

1093
01:07:57,241 --> 01:08:02,241
time that if I had gotten out of
the car and thrown the first punch,

1094
01:08:03,150 --> 01:08:04,410
even if I won the fight,

1095
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:07,440
whatever downpayment I would have
had to actually get a fucking house,

1096
01:08:07,441 --> 01:08:11,520
which is something I'd like to do at some
point in my life that would have been

1097
01:08:11,521 --> 01:08:16,040
out the fucking window
and as much a calm me down

1098
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:20,990
today, it's still hasn't made
me feel any better. And, uh,

1099
01:08:21,020 --> 01:08:21,853
this,
this,

1100
01:08:21,860 --> 01:08:26,860
this should be like some
sort of gentleman's agreement
of I'm not going to sue

1101
01:08:27,441 --> 01:08:30,560
you and my friends aren't going to jump
in or maybe even go down to the gym.

1102
01:08:30,561 --> 01:08:34,550
You just put the gloves on so
you can just get it out of here.

1103
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:38,830
Because I got to admit it's
still fucking in me. And uh,

1104
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:41,670
I've been here,

1105
01:08:42,470 --> 01:08:44,750
this is how much of a cunt it's
made me and I'm trying to get,

1106
01:08:44,751 --> 01:08:48,410
I'm trying to get rid of this, this,
this little ball of hate that is in me.

1107
01:08:48,830 --> 01:08:53,600
When I was, I looked at the
one house, right? And I, and
I felt better and I'm like,

1108
01:08:53,601 --> 01:08:57,780
I still need to look at another
house because you know, I'm on a,

1109
01:08:57,810 --> 01:09:00,610
I'm still in a bad mood and

1110
01:09:02,750 --> 01:09:04,940
I was driving up the street and
as I'm driving up the street,

1111
01:09:04,941 --> 01:09:07,880
this white lady is like waving her hands,
like telling me to stop.

1112
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:10,850
She's got no uniform,
no uniform on or nothing.

1113
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:13,300
So I kind of, you know, I'm,

1114
01:09:13,301 --> 01:09:16,770
I'm deliberately driving pastor a little
bit before I slowed down cause I'm a

1115
01:09:16,771 --> 01:09:19,220
fucking control freak and I don't
like people telling me what to do.

1116
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:24,590
So she comes up to my window and I
go, what? And she's like, I'm a tree.

1117
01:09:24,591 --> 01:09:27,140
Fell on the road around the corner.
I just didn't want you to hit it.

1118
01:09:27,141 --> 01:09:31,490
And I was just like, oh my God, I am
the biggest asshole ever. I really am.

1119
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,260
He know if I'm really going
to be honest with myself.

1120
01:09:33,261 --> 01:09:36,710
The whole fucking reason I had that
fight with that guy is because I'm in a

1121
01:09:36,711 --> 01:09:41,690
grumpy mood because the less seven out of
last eight weeks I've been on the road.

1122
01:09:42,310 --> 01:09:46,130
All right there. All right. I
admit my fucking part of it.

1123
01:09:47,410 --> 01:09:49,970
Uh, do it that you could have seen
where that guy was just standing there.

1124
01:09:51,890 --> 01:09:56,480
Then fucking shark fin of a noses Hibbs
coming out from those awful sunglasses

1125
01:09:57,500 --> 01:10:00,260
that's going to harm me for
another couple of days. But, um,

1126
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:05,300
thank God I am a little bit older
and I actually know how my brain,

1127
01:10:05,330 --> 01:10:08,180
I'm telling you that's what I've been
older is, is knowing how your brain works.

1128
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:10,400
Okay?
Because the moment is gone.

1129
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:13,340
So now long gonna do is just walk
around hate in this fucking guy.

1130
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:15,470
So what I have to do is every
time I think, and I just,

1131
01:10:15,471 --> 01:10:18,470
I just fucking think of something else.
Um,

1132
01:10:18,620 --> 01:10:21,290
and I've been able to do it in my
apartment, but when I get in my car,

1133
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:23,300
it's like a Vietnam fucking flashback.

1134
01:10:23,301 --> 01:10:27,740
So I'm just going to give myself
a week to get over it. And, uh,

1135
01:10:28,730 --> 01:10:32,030
and that's it. All right, so there's a
story for you that took a nice 12 minutes.

1136
01:10:32,031 --> 01:10:36,200
My fucking voice is killing me.
You know,

1137
01:10:36,201 --> 01:10:40,700
I actually bought a book on how to
fucking use your voice properly on stage.

1138
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:45,330
I should really read it. I do drink
that throat coat, fucking, uh,

1139
01:10:45,350 --> 01:10:49,010
tea with honey now.
That's how old I am.

1140
01:10:50,430 --> 01:10:50,980
Um,

1141
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:53,900
what I really should be doing is giving
my voice arrest and shutting the fuck up

1142
01:10:53,901 --> 01:10:57,650
rather than yelling about some dude who
doesn't even matter in my fucking life.

1143
01:10:59,740 --> 01:11:04,490
Ah. All right, let's
get on with the podcast.

1144
01:11:04,491 --> 01:11:07,220
So this is the Monday morning podcast.
Everybody, if you're new to this,

1145
01:11:07,221 --> 01:11:10,880
you're probably in some sort of a,
I dunno what you would,

1146
01:11:10,881 --> 01:11:15,000
what mindset you would be and it's all
fucking ceiling fans drying out my throat.

1147
01:11:15,001 --> 01:11:16,820
That's what's going on.
Um,

1148
01:11:18,260 --> 01:11:18,990
okay.

1149
01:11:18,990 --> 01:11:21,300
Isn't it something really
intimidating about a ceiling fan?

1150
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:24,570
Do you ever not think that it's just
going to come flying off the fucking

1151
01:11:24,571 --> 01:11:29,340
ceiling and decapitate you
it's unreal how it just stays there.

1152
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:31,310
Yeah.

1153
01:11:31,310 --> 01:11:35,240
Our pumpkin seasonal, I didn't even get
back to that. I got to get, I, you know,

1154
01:11:35,390 --> 01:11:37,460
you know what happened last year
is I carved up a couple of them,

1155
01:11:37,461 --> 01:11:40,970
but I carved them up too early and uh,

1156
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:43,040
they started to dry out.

1157
01:11:43,690 --> 01:11:43,990
Okay.

1158
01:11:43,990 --> 01:11:45,850
And the thing that I,
I had carved in there,

1159
01:11:45,851 --> 01:11:49,480
this scary looking face and I had carved
like a whole silhouette and the in the

1160
01:11:49,481 --> 01:11:52,930
background, you know what I mean? It's
like a carved out, like a big circle,

1161
01:11:53,590 --> 01:11:54,430
three cores the away.

1162
01:11:54,431 --> 01:11:57,370
And then on the bottom I carved the
head into the bottom part of the circle.

1163
01:11:57,520 --> 01:12:00,130
So then the candle was behind it,
fucking lift this thing up.

1164
01:12:00,131 --> 01:12:05,050
It looked like it was awesome. But
the weight of the, uh, the face,

1165
01:12:05,890 --> 01:12:08,290
considering it wasn't connected
to any other part of the Pumpkin,

1166
01:12:08,291 --> 01:12:12,610
it started to fall into the
hole. Is it dehydrated? And uh,

1167
01:12:12,780 --> 01:12:15,340
it really wasn't scary come Halloween.
It was just kind of sad.

1168
01:12:15,430 --> 01:12:19,210
It looked like a defeated demon. Like
he, he's looking up in the air like, God,

1169
01:12:19,211 --> 01:12:22,930
what do I have to do to scare people?
Um,

1170
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:25,793
yeah.

1171
01:12:25,810 --> 01:12:30,100
Yeah. So anyways, I just came back
from the DC Improv, everybody and uh,

1172
01:12:30,101 --> 01:12:33,580
I want to thank everybody in Washington
DC and the surrounding area of Baltimore,

1173
01:12:33,581 --> 01:12:36,180
Richmond, Richmond, Virginia, Georgetown,

1174
01:12:36,190 --> 01:12:37,960
wherever the hell you
came from West Virginia.

1175
01:12:37,961 --> 01:12:39,700
I just want to thank all
you guys for coming out.

1176
01:12:40,090 --> 01:12:44,950
That was the greatest turnout I have
ever had to any stand up a weekend I've

1177
01:12:44,951 --> 01:12:47,230
ever had.
I actually had to add a show people.

1178
01:12:47,380 --> 01:12:51,430
I did a second show on a
Thursday night and it's sold out.

1179
01:12:52,510 --> 01:12:55,360
I did six sold out shows and uh,

1180
01:12:55,390 --> 01:12:59,560
three days and um,
had the time of my life.

1181
01:13:00,670 --> 01:13:01,140
Okay.

1182
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:05,910
Ate at this restaurant. Posh, got
hooked up there by chef Chris.

1183
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:09,450
He's fucking dude. Brought us out
all his food. Want to thank him.

1184
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:14,340
Oh, it was a great time, dude. You
know what else I did? I actually,

1185
01:13:14,341 --> 01:13:16,590
we got a football,
it's a long fucking story.

1186
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:18,780
This is the Peter Pan
Lifestyle I'm living at,

1187
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:23,040
which really gives me no excuse to get
mad at some guy in a green four door

1188
01:13:23,041 --> 01:13:25,830
sedan in the parking lot
of a goddamn diner. Right.

1189
01:13:27,150 --> 01:13:31,500
I played football on a Friday afternoon
around two in the afternoon. Like,

1190
01:13:31,501 --> 01:13:36,210
I was still in like the fifth grade,
you know, that she's fifth grade,

1191
01:13:36,211 --> 01:13:39,060
be more around four and I'd be blowing
off my homework or whatever, you know,

1192
01:13:40,370 --> 01:13:44,960
and uh, ended up spraying in my
finger cause uh, Paul Versey,

1193
01:13:45,230 --> 01:13:47,900
the comedian who opened up for me,
it was, we were so fucking hilarious.

1194
01:13:47,901 --> 01:13:50,420
Like typical, you know, he's
still a younger guy, but you know,

1195
01:13:50,421 --> 01:13:55,250
I'm 41 so I'm stretching and
doing all this shit and uh,

1196
01:13:56,180 --> 01:13:58,700
we're sitting there lying to ourselves.
We though we could still play.

1197
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:02,540
That was a great pass to do. You hit me
right in stride, get me right in stride.

1198
01:14:03,170 --> 01:14:05,900
He's getting all excited that he's
hitting a 41 year old in stride.

1199
01:14:06,050 --> 01:14:07,970
Like the defensive back couldn't catch up

1200
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:16,540
in fucking run the thing back for
six the other way. But uh, Nah man,

1201
01:14:16,541 --> 01:14:17,374
I was psyched.

1202
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:22,300
I was really impressed with how fast I
can still run and I'm gonna tell you why.

1203
01:14:22,301 --> 01:14:27,301
It's because I've kept myself in shape
and I stretch on a regular basis for all

1204
01:14:27,611 --> 01:14:29,410
you guys out there.
As you're getting older,

1205
01:14:29,530 --> 01:14:31,120
you have a look at
older guys and you like,

1206
01:14:31,121 --> 01:14:35,380
you just look at him and you get to an
age at some point where you can't fucking

1207
01:14:35,381 --> 01:14:38,950
run anymore and it blows
your mind when you're young,

1208
01:14:38,951 --> 01:14:40,500
like why can't you run anymore?

1209
01:14:40,510 --> 01:14:44,620
You just send them that brain
signal to your legs to run.

1210
01:14:45,130 --> 01:14:49,960
And as the problem is, because it hurts.
I mean, look this, this part of it is,

1211
01:14:49,961 --> 01:14:52,660
yeah, you walked on your legs,
your feet and you use your body,

1212
01:14:53,070 --> 01:14:55,870
the wear and tear of 40 years.
But I swear to God,

1213
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:59,560
it seems like 80% of it is not stretching.
If you don't stretch,

1214
01:14:59,561 --> 01:15:04,270
you get atrophy and your muscles shrivel
up. And that's when you literally,

1215
01:15:04,271 --> 01:15:07,240
somebody throws you a ball and it's a
little out of your reach and you go to

1216
01:15:07,241 --> 01:15:11,080
reach for it and all of a sudden you
fucking your kidneys up by where your

1217
01:15:11,081 --> 01:15:15,760
fucking shoulder blade is. The
kidney attached attendance. I know,

1218
01:15:15,761 --> 01:15:17,080
fucking knows.
You know what I'm trying to say?

1219
01:15:17,290 --> 01:15:22,120
I went from muscles and tendons
to Oregon's, um, I'm telling you,

1220
01:15:22,780 --> 01:15:23,740
uh,

1221
01:15:25,690 --> 01:15:29,050
I have this power yoga tape that
I've been doing forever and forever.

1222
01:15:29,051 --> 01:15:32,560
My friends had been teased and we do
that gay, what are you doing yoga for?

1223
01:15:32,561 --> 01:15:35,620
Where you trying to suck
your own Dick, Eh, right.

1224
01:15:36,550 --> 01:15:41,440
All those fucks continued to eat and they
didn't stretch. And I was never fast.

1225
01:15:41,441 --> 01:15:45,070
I could always catch,
I always had great hand eye coordination.

1226
01:15:45,071 --> 01:15:47,440
I can fucking catch anything.
I don't give a shit what it is.

1227
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:52,570
My thing is that there's just going to
be somebody in front of me because I was

1228
01:15:52,571 --> 01:15:56,290
never fast. So this is hilarious.
I was never fast. Okay.

1229
01:15:56,710 --> 01:15:58,150
But I kept myself in shape.

1230
01:15:58,151 --> 01:16:01,480
And about seven or eight years ago
when I was in my early thirties,

1231
01:16:01,481 --> 01:16:05,500
I was playing pickup football and we
had been playing for about 20 minutes.

1232
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:10,180
And for the first time in
my life, somebody on the
opposing team actually said,

1233
01:16:10,210 --> 01:16:12,850
they said, hey, watch
out for bird. He's fast.

1234
01:16:13,300 --> 01:16:17,470
And I almost burst out laughing because
I was thinking of what a statement,

1235
01:16:17,471 --> 01:16:21,790
what that was to the horrific shape that
they were in because I was slow when I

1236
01:16:21,791 --> 01:16:22,840
should have been fast.

1237
01:16:23,230 --> 01:16:27,640
I ran like a 30 year old
when I was 17 so when I'm 33,

1238
01:16:27,641 --> 01:16:31,420
I got to be running like
I'm 45. Um, you know.

1239
01:16:32,620 --> 01:16:35,590
So anyways, we had a great
time and uh, I got to tell,

1240
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:37,900
you know what I realized when I
was throwing that football around,

1241
01:16:38,860 --> 01:16:41,620
and this is one of the sad things
about being an adult and getting

1242
01:16:41,621 --> 01:16:46,480
responsibility and not being able to have
a fight because you could get sued is

1243
01:16:46,510 --> 01:16:49,330
there's a lot of other fun things
that you just stopped doing,

1244
01:16:49,630 --> 01:16:51,010
like throwing a football.

1245
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:54,880
Do you know how much I love football and
how much I loved it when I was a kid?

1246
01:16:54,881 --> 01:16:57,130
And you know how long it's
been such I threw a football,

1247
01:16:57,220 --> 01:16:58,270
I can't remember the last,

1248
01:16:58,271 --> 01:17:02,530
I think the last time I threw a football
was that day I was talking about what

1249
01:17:02,531 --> 01:17:05,680
they said get berries fast,
which was like 33. Like,

1250
01:17:05,681 --> 01:17:10,190
I honestly in the last eight years cannot
remember ever a football do you know

1251
01:17:10,191 --> 01:17:11,630
fucking tragic that is.

1252
01:17:14,050 --> 01:17:17,110
We were out there running post
patterns is fucking, you know,

1253
01:17:17,140 --> 01:17:17,951
cutting across the mill.

1254
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:20,350
I was having the time of my
life until I sprained my finger.

1255
01:17:20,351 --> 01:17:21,370
But even then it was all right.

1256
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:24,620
Just say it looks like when a
Elton John's fingers, everything,

1257
01:17:24,670 --> 01:17:27,730
an Elton John Concert and he plays with
those little fat little sausage fingers

1258
01:17:27,731 --> 01:17:29,370
he has and he always talks about it.

1259
01:17:29,371 --> 01:17:32,050
He doesn't have piano playing fingers
cause he can't really reach that far.

1260
01:17:32,051 --> 01:17:35,320
But he's still the shit cause he's
so gifted. That's what I have.

1261
01:17:35,321 --> 01:17:39,610
I have one Elton John Index
finger or Mario Batali.

1262
01:17:40,780 --> 01:17:44,860
Anybody watched the food network and you
watch him when he did after he does the

1263
01:17:44,861 --> 01:17:49,510
well method making the pasta, which is
something I really want to fucking try.

1264
01:17:50,150 --> 01:17:52,240
I always want to try and
make my own homemade pasta.

1265
01:17:52,510 --> 01:17:53,950
I really got into cooking for a minute.

1266
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:57,460
I used to watch that show multiple Mario
everyday because he seemed like the

1267
01:17:57,461 --> 01:18:00,880
real deal, you know, not only
did he understand that dish,

1268
01:18:01,180 --> 01:18:04,510
he had been to the country where it
it, you know, he'd been to Italy.

1269
01:18:05,740 --> 01:18:06,260
Okay.

1270
01:18:06,260 --> 01:18:09,260
Hung around with Italians and they taught
them how to fucking make this stuff

1271
01:18:09,410 --> 01:18:12,920
after they gave them a ton of shit
for not knowing what he was doing.

1272
01:18:12,921 --> 01:18:15,140
He could explain the part
of Italy that it came from.

1273
01:18:15,141 --> 01:18:18,680
It's just a tremendous show. And I liked
that. He does it in his own kitchen.

1274
01:18:18,681 --> 01:18:23,150
He just has like a couple of
friends over, you know? And uh,

1275
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:24,261
I don't know,

1276
01:18:24,261 --> 01:18:27,860
I just looked at it and like a comedy
kind of way where he just seemed like a

1277
01:18:27,861 --> 01:18:31,310
comedian who's really a comedian.
Like they don't need props.

1278
01:18:31,311 --> 01:18:34,970
They don't need a catch phrase. He's just
standing there doing his shit. Right.

1279
01:18:35,450 --> 01:18:39,320
As opposed to other shows where you got,
you know, like, uh, I was going to say,

1280
01:18:39,321 --> 01:18:44,240
Emilio Estevez what the fuck's that
guys? Emeril Lagasse, you know,

1281
01:18:44,330 --> 01:18:46,340
there's so much,
just so much I got into the food network.

1282
01:18:46,670 --> 01:18:51,110
I could actually tell how much happier
Emeril Lagasse was when he was doing

1283
01:18:51,290 --> 01:18:55,730
essence of Emeril as opposed to being
in front of the crowd. You know,

1284
01:18:56,060 --> 01:18:59,900
who doesn't like working in front
of a, uh, uh, a live audience,

1285
01:18:59,901 --> 01:19:03,530
but you could see the sadness in his
face when the crowd just sits there and

1286
01:19:03,531 --> 01:19:05,360
then he has to do all that extra shit.

1287
01:19:06,050 --> 01:19:07,730
All of a sudden he got to
turn it into like, you know,

1288
01:19:09,020 --> 01:19:12,000
I've got some butter and everybody's like,
Eh,

1289
01:19:12,210 --> 01:19:14,180
start screaming where I essence Amarillo.

1290
01:19:14,181 --> 01:19:17,780
You can just sit down and cook the dish
and not have to sit there throwing flour

1291
01:19:17,781 --> 01:19:21,260
over his shoulder and sugar
into the eyes of his drummer.

1292
01:19:21,261 --> 01:19:25,490
He's got a fucking drummer on a
goddamn cooking show. Um, so anyways,

1293
01:19:25,491 --> 01:19:27,260
that's what I'm saying. Like,
look, if you love football,

1294
01:19:27,261 --> 01:19:29,480
you haven't played in a while.
Stretch out and throw the ball around.

1295
01:19:29,481 --> 01:19:33,200
I'm telling you, you got to do it. Do
it before you fucking t plays on Sunday.

1296
01:19:33,740 --> 01:19:37,520
That's one of those silent silent
competitions I have with, with other guys.

1297
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:37,851
You know,

1298
01:19:37,851 --> 01:19:41,450
you're going to a sports bar and you
just look at the horror that is a sports

1299
01:19:41,451 --> 01:19:45,230
bar to complete audit shape,
fat fucks,

1300
01:19:46,250 --> 01:19:50,600
the bloated alcohol and wings face that
you see every time you turn around.

1301
01:19:50,630 --> 01:19:53,930
You know, I always go, I'm going to
have to empty. I go to a sports bar.

1302
01:19:53,931 --> 01:19:57,830
Like I always try to work out before
I go there, you know, burn off,

1303
01:19:57,831 --> 01:19:58,880
whatever the fuck I'm gonna eat in there.

1304
01:19:58,881 --> 01:20:00,800
Cause I don't want to look at like
those people that are in there.

1305
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:03,590
So that's what I'm saying. There's a
fun way. If you hate the fucking gym,

1306
01:20:03,591 --> 01:20:07,860
go get a God damn football dude.
I felt like I was in the fifth grade.

1307
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:11,670
Like when I was done, I was looking for
my book bag. You know, it was ridiculous.

1308
01:20:12,510 --> 01:20:14,880
Of course, two hours later, I
did not feel like a fifth grader.

1309
01:20:15,150 --> 01:20:18,690
I felt like I was 48 but it
was fun nonetheless. All right,

1310
01:20:18,691 --> 01:20:23,220
so let's get on with the podcast
questions and, and, and whatnot. Hey,

1311
01:20:23,221 --> 01:20:26,730
here's a great thing. If any,
anybody else has like a, um,

1312
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:32,070
had a confrontation. Like, what?
I had and for whatever reason,

1313
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:34,460
you didn't have the fight.
And you know,

1314
01:20:34,470 --> 01:20:36,960
it was funny when I was
saying I was so mad and I say,

1315
01:20:36,990 --> 01:20:39,880
I was telling Nia I have to go back there.
When I was dropping her up,

1316
01:20:39,930 --> 01:20:44,070
dropping her off, she goes, just
go back and slash his tires,

1317
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:51,540
which really took me back to the whole
revenge thing of how damaging somebody's

1318
01:20:51,541 --> 01:20:54,720
car. I literally said that too.
I got, that's the bitch move.

1319
01:20:55,890 --> 01:20:58,230
I could slash chuck Norris is tires.

1320
01:20:58,231 --> 01:21:01,880
If he wasn't standing
there and ruin his day, no,

1321
01:21:01,890 --> 01:21:06,210
go back and fight the
guy or just fucking or,

1322
01:21:06,390 --> 01:21:07,223
or don't

1323
01:21:08,910 --> 01:21:13,710
go back and rip his antenna off like a
fucking pussy fight or don't fight. Oh,

1324
01:21:13,711 --> 01:21:16,200
take a walk around a lake
and calm yourself down.

1325
01:21:16,290 --> 01:21:20,160
It admit to yourself that you're 41 years
old and you probably had a fucking 50

1326
01:21:20,161 --> 01:21:22,960
50 chance of losing the
thing to begin with. Ah.

1327
01:21:23,050 --> 01:21:25,950
And it would have been on the ground with
that gravel embedded in the side of my

1328
01:21:25,951 --> 01:21:29,880
face. You know, just taking
a boat shoe to the head.

1329
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:36,270
He didn't have him on boat
shoes. He wasn't that bad.
All right. Okay. Here we go.

1330
01:21:36,271 --> 01:21:39,340
Here's a podcast. All right? Last week
I was telling you guys about how I have,

1331
01:21:39,990 --> 01:21:43,420
I discovered the magic
word when complaining, um,

1332
01:21:43,890 --> 01:21:47,970
to corporations that the
word is a unacceptable.

1333
01:21:48,690 --> 01:21:49,230
All right?

1334
01:21:49,230 --> 01:21:52,770
And just in case you guys feel that
I don't know what I'm talking about,

1335
01:21:52,771 --> 01:21:57,430
which is exactly what you should
feel because I am a moron. Um,

1336
01:21:58,590 --> 01:22:02,980
I got this great email from somebody.
Who the fuck is it? God dammit.

1337
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:06,930
I thought I had it. You
know what? I am the worst.

1338
01:22:07,050 --> 01:22:11,160
Why do you guys listen to this
fucking podcast? No, no, no. I know.

1339
01:22:11,180 --> 01:22:14,400
I put ahead of right fucking here in
front of me. All right, it's back on.

1340
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:18,060
It's back on track. I actually
got, I actually got a,

1341
01:22:18,061 --> 01:22:21,900
an email from somebody who answers the
phones for one of those big corporations.

1342
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:22,360
All right?

1343
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:25,560
If you want to learn how to do what I
explained it last in last week's podcast,

1344
01:22:25,561 --> 01:22:29,870
at least my story of how I went
about, um, getting my money back. So,

1345
01:22:30,790 --> 01:22:32,890
so this guy sends me, it's
really nice letter. He says, uh,

1346
01:22:33,510 --> 01:22:37,060
just want to say your podcasts a fucking
hilarious. Keep them coming. I'm,

1347
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:42,000
you should do a show in Omaha
sometime. Uh, that's a rough one, dude.

1348
01:22:42,001 --> 01:22:45,990
Omaha's or rough one. I will
at some point. All right.

1349
01:22:45,991 --> 01:22:47,700
I just have to get psyched up for that.

1350
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:50,220
The 28 planes I'm going to
have to take to get there.

1351
01:22:50,580 --> 01:22:52,560
That's one of those like fucking states.

1352
01:22:52,561 --> 01:22:57,420
You have to fly past it to
fly into a hub city, you know,

1353
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:01,770
to finally get there. You know, I'm
flying to Omaha via fucking Tampa.

1354
01:23:02,370 --> 01:23:06,040
What? All right. Um, here we bill. Um,

1355
01:23:06,041 --> 01:23:09,880
also I wanted to say when dealing
with corporations using the word,

1356
01:23:10,390 --> 01:23:12,460
the unacceptable line does work.

1357
01:23:13,420 --> 01:23:16,810
I am a support agent for a well
known financial comic company.

1358
01:23:17,170 --> 01:23:21,280
If someone is continually a pain in the
ass about something and are persistent

1359
01:23:21,281 --> 01:23:26,050
about it, eventually they will
get their way. You guys hear that?

1360
01:23:26,051 --> 01:23:29,110
I know it's morning. For some of you, you
stirring your coffee. Did you hear that?

1361
01:23:29,230 --> 01:23:33,220
If someone is continually a pain in the
ass about something and are persistent

1362
01:23:33,221 --> 01:23:35,320
about it,
eventually they will get their way.

1363
01:23:35,740 --> 01:23:38,230
Usually as a customer
service representative,

1364
01:23:38,410 --> 01:23:42,250
we are encouraged to try and steer
the conversation away from the,

1365
01:23:42,490 --> 01:23:46,540
from things like credits and
try to offer other suggestions.

1366
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:49,810
And that's the part where you get mad
because you're not getting what you want,

1367
01:23:49,811 --> 01:23:52,520
but that's what you have to keep. You
cool. All right. So anyways, he says, uh,

1368
01:23:52,810 --> 01:23:57,730
basically we try to bullshit them a
little and try and put them at ease.

1369
01:23:58,450 --> 01:24:02,530
Yeah. Lie to them. Okay. But if
a customer is still not happy,

1370
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:06,400
we will give a credit or whatever
you want. As long as it's reasonable,

1371
01:24:06,550 --> 01:24:10,780
that's fair. Um, just to get
you off the phone. However,

1372
01:24:10,781 --> 01:24:14,860
if you start using profanity,
um, while on the phone call,

1373
01:24:14,861 --> 01:24:18,870
chances are we will try and find ways not
to help you or disconnect the call all

1374
01:24:18,871 --> 01:24:21,250
together.
Regardless of rules and procedures.

1375
01:24:21,251 --> 01:24:25,240
Representatives do have the ability
to make judgment calls. Basically,

1376
01:24:25,241 --> 01:24:27,400
if you call the customer
service rep a Cunt,

1377
01:24:27,730 --> 01:24:31,810
I will guarantee you they will not help
you stick to using the unacceptable line.

1378
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:36,700
Don't give up and you eventually will
get what you want. See that people,

1379
01:24:37,780 --> 01:24:38,613
there you go.

1380
01:24:39,430 --> 01:24:44,110
Now you have the information you need
from a professional rather than some moron

1381
01:24:44,380 --> 01:24:48,970
comedian who almost got in a fight
outside of a pancake house. Um,

1382
01:24:50,950 --> 01:24:55,450
I actually want another one this week.
All right? I ordered the NHL Package,

1383
01:24:55,451 --> 01:24:58,760
the center ice package and
ask them, hey, you know,

1384
01:24:58,770 --> 01:25:02,800
so I says to the guy who I just sound
like I was doing fucking a Vaudeville.

1385
01:25:03,190 --> 01:25:05,470
So I asked the guy, I says, hey buddy,

1386
01:25:07,210 --> 01:25:11,730
what's with the chicken
soup? Um, I asked, I asked,

1387
01:25:11,860 --> 01:25:16,030
I asked the lady when I ordered it,
does it come with the NHL Channel?

1388
01:25:17,170 --> 01:25:20,830
And she says, hold on, let me check.
And she says, why? Yes, yes it does.

1389
01:25:20,831 --> 01:25:23,320
And I said the, and then you know
what? You got yourself a deal.

1390
01:25:23,950 --> 01:25:28,150
I will take the center ice package with
the NHL channel. So she says, okay,

1391
01:25:28,530 --> 01:25:32,500
all right. So they boot the fucking thing
up. And the next day, Lo and behold,

1392
01:25:33,220 --> 01:25:37,810
I don't have the NHL channel. So I call
up and what did they say to me? They say,

1393
01:25:37,811 --> 01:25:41,950
hey, hello sir, what can I do for you?
And I tell him I deal. And they said, oh,

1394
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:44,050
we actually shot in her notes.
She left.

1395
01:25:44,051 --> 01:25:48,970
She said that you hung up before the call
was over. And I was like, no, I didn't.

1396
01:25:49,240 --> 01:25:50,440
I immediately got pissed too.

1397
01:25:50,441 --> 01:25:52,630
I kind of fucked this phone call
up a little bit in the beginning.

1398
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:55,250
I went the [inaudible] route,
but I didn't say it, but then I,

1399
01:25:55,251 --> 01:25:59,080
I got it back on track. I was like,
no, I didn't. And he goes like, well,

1400
01:25:59,081 --> 01:26:03,920
according to her notes you did. And I
was like, well, according to my memory,

1401
01:26:04,610 --> 01:26:08,480
uh, I was on the phone call and you
weren't okay. So now what? I'm like,

1402
01:26:08,481 --> 01:26:11,210
so now what?
She gets to just say something happened.

1403
01:26:11,420 --> 01:26:16,410
She writes it down to cover her
ass, you know, and you know,

1404
01:26:16,411 --> 01:26:17,550
so that's when I kinda got mad.

1405
01:26:17,551 --> 01:26:19,710
But then I was able to bring
it back and just say, look,

1406
01:26:21,570 --> 01:26:24,720
the conversation ended with her going,
thank you very much.

1407
01:26:24,721 --> 01:26:26,730
Is there anything else I can
help you with? What do you think?

1408
01:26:26,731 --> 01:26:29,890
I was halfway through ordering it and
she was going, hang on a second sir.

1409
01:26:29,891 --> 01:26:33,960
Hang on. I was like, too late. Get
by. I didn't do that. All right.

1410
01:26:35,220 --> 01:26:39,000
And the guy's like, well, I have to
charge you $5 a month for this channel.

1411
01:26:39,001 --> 01:26:42,330
This is, this is like the zero tolerance
I have. I am arguing $5 a month,

1412
01:26:42,331 --> 01:26:45,600
which is going to be 30 bucks over
the course of the six month season.

1413
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:49,890
And I'm like, no, I'm not paying that.
Okay. And the guy goes, why? I can't.

1414
01:26:49,980 --> 01:26:52,290
I can't give it to you. I don't
know what to do. I go, all right,

1415
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:56,400
well then cancel the center ice package.
And the guy goes, I can't do that. I go,

1416
01:26:56,401 --> 01:26:57,810
what do you mean he can't do that?
And he goes,

1417
01:26:57,811 --> 01:27:00,530
you can't cancel it once you order it.
I go,

1418
01:27:00,531 --> 01:27:03,480
see you mean to tell me
that I ordered something?

1419
01:27:04,650 --> 01:27:07,140
It's in what you told me it was,
it isn't,

1420
01:27:07,141 --> 01:27:10,320
and now I can't cancel it and
you can't rectify the situation.

1421
01:27:10,890 --> 01:27:14,910
Is that any way to buy a business, run
a business? And the guy's like, whoa.

1422
01:27:14,911 --> 01:27:17,220
And I go, that's unacceptable.
I want to talk to somebody else.

1423
01:27:17,910 --> 01:27:20,160
So I get this next guy on the phone.
At this point,

1424
01:27:20,161 --> 01:27:23,700
I finally calmed down and I was able to
use that line, sir, I understand you.

1425
01:27:23,730 --> 01:27:26,310
You know you don't make the rules.
I know this wasn't your call,

1426
01:27:26,430 --> 01:27:29,760
but this was the scenario. Okay,
but blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1427
01:27:29,790 --> 01:27:32,550
If he can't give me the channel for free,
like I told it was,

1428
01:27:32,640 --> 01:27:36,210
you know that it came with the package,
I would like to cancel center rice.

1429
01:27:36,211 --> 01:27:39,810
The guy goes, well, I can't do either
one of those, but this is what I can do.

1430
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:45,390
Your DVR costs you 10 bucks a month.
How about I give you three free months,

1431
01:27:45,391 --> 01:27:50,040
a DVR that'll be 30 bucks discount
and the whole thing will be a wash.

1432
01:27:50,041 --> 01:27:53,370
And I was like, you know what?
You got yourself a deal. Bam.

1433
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:55,860
Two one I'll turn it

1434
01:27:56,070 --> 01:28:00,900
this franchise around a perennial losing
franchise and just like the fucking

1435
01:28:00,901 --> 01:28:05,460
saints, I am now a factor.
I am now a fucking factor.

1436
01:28:06,090 --> 01:28:06,660
So,

1437
01:28:06,660 --> 01:28:11,660
and the last two weeks I got 25 buck
dollars back and I got $30 back.

1438
01:28:12,121 --> 01:28:13,710
I am plus 55.

1439
01:28:14,160 --> 01:28:19,160
I'm like a degenerate that the mush and
a a Bronx tale and I'm finally winning.

1440
01:28:20,220 --> 01:28:24,920
Oh I'm plus I saved myself 55 bucks.
Do you know how many tubes?

1441
01:28:24,921 --> 01:28:28,980
Sops you can buy with 55 bucks.
It's a lot of fucking socks.

1442
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,280
How great do you feet feel when
you got a new pair of socks?

1443
01:28:32,281 --> 01:28:36,270
You know I never whistled.
The only time I ever whistle.

1444
01:28:36,271 --> 01:28:39,060
If you ever see me whistle and you know
I got a brand new pair of fucking dress

1445
01:28:39,061 --> 01:28:43,560
socks, a tube socks on your feet
take tingle in that right Clia. Ah,

1446
01:28:43,620 --> 01:28:44,453
they tingle.

1447
01:28:46,700 --> 01:28:47,920
I was hoping she was
going to make the noise.

1448
01:28:47,921 --> 01:28:49,990
Let me see if I can get her moan this
week. You guys haven't heard in a while.

1449
01:28:51,690 --> 01:28:52,523
Yeah,

1450
01:28:54,090 --> 01:28:58,470
she too busy sniffing on
microphone. Um, anyways. All right,

1451
01:28:58,471 --> 01:29:01,500
so let's get on with the fucking questions
here because I've got to start this

1452
01:29:01,501 --> 01:29:04,830
up. I'm almost done here. Um, say,
you know what? I feel great right now.

1453
01:29:04,831 --> 01:29:07,920
I feel great. I told that fucking
story about the guy at the diner.

1454
01:29:07,921 --> 01:29:10,050
I got to laugh at it.
I got to laugh at myself.

1455
01:29:10,051 --> 01:29:12,810
I got to be honest that chances are he
probably would have lost the fucking

1456
01:29:12,811 --> 01:29:16,950
fight. You know? That's why
stand up as a great thing.

1457
01:29:18,040 --> 01:29:19,020
It's a great fucking thing.

1458
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:23,250
You get to make a complete ass out
of yourself filling a Douche and,

1459
01:29:23,251 --> 01:29:28,080
and laugh about it. Then you feel better.
All right, so he needs advice. All right.

1460
01:29:28,081 --> 01:29:28,980
Hey, Bill. Uh,

1461
01:29:28,981 --> 01:29:31,770
I got a couple of questions and comments
or stories about Bubba and went out

1462
01:29:31,771 --> 01:29:34,290
with this girl last year before
I went to the prom with her.

1463
01:29:34,650 --> 01:29:35,880
It wasn't really a date,

1464
01:29:35,881 --> 01:29:38,700
but it was just a chance to go
out with her and get to know,

1465
01:29:39,270 --> 01:29:40,920
to get to know her before we went to prom.

1466
01:29:41,070 --> 01:29:43,110
We ended up having a great
time that evening and it,

1467
01:29:43,650 --> 01:29:47,910
and at the prom I proceeded to Facebook
her about a week later and asked her if

1468
01:29:47,911 --> 01:29:50,210
she wanted to go out again.
She basically shared,

1469
01:29:50,220 --> 01:29:54,840
said she would like to go out again, but
not in a romantic way. Bombbomb, BombBomb.

1470
01:29:56,670 --> 01:29:59,550
All right, so now you took that
emotional kick in the chest.

1471
01:30:00,510 --> 01:30:03,690
After hearing this I backed off and
didn't pursue her for a month or so.

1472
01:30:03,900 --> 01:30:07,020
In this time she got a
boyfriend, booboo, Badu,

1473
01:30:08,310 --> 01:30:13,080
which honestly pissed me the fuck
off as well. It should have. Uh,

1474
01:30:13,140 --> 01:30:15,870
I had to talk to her.
Um,

1475
01:30:16,410 --> 01:30:19,860
I had talked to her for about a week
before she went out with this guy and when

1476
01:30:19,861 --> 01:30:21,360
they finally were officially dating,

1477
01:30:21,361 --> 01:30:25,470
I told her I didn't want to cause
trouble and then I didn't want to bother.

1478
01:30:25,620 --> 01:30:27,570
She replied by saying that she,

1479
01:30:27,910 --> 01:30:31,470
she said she didn't want to go out again
with me is because she was confused

1480
01:30:31,471 --> 01:30:36,420
about how I felt and seen when we
first went up before prom that I wasn't

1481
01:30:36,421 --> 01:30:40,740
interested. Isn't that funny? After she
said, let's just go out and be friends.

1482
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:44,310
Right. Didn't she? Did I already
forget the first part of this?

1483
01:30:44,550 --> 01:30:47,340
We saw each other maybe two or
three times again through birthdays,

1484
01:30:47,341 --> 01:30:51,180
graduation parties until I went off to
college and she went back to high school.

1485
01:30:51,480 --> 01:30:54,960
I am now a freshman in college and have
and have made no friends on account of

1486
01:30:54,961 --> 01:30:58,440
my horrific people skills. I feel
like I should go after college girls,

1487
01:30:58,441 --> 01:31:01,980
but I can't stop thinking about the high
school girl and feel like she is light

1488
01:31:01,981 --> 01:31:04,440
years ahead of these big
tented shallow college girls.

1489
01:31:04,620 --> 01:31:07,620
I also feel like she's the first girl
that I ever felt comfortable hanging out

1490
01:31:07,621 --> 01:31:08,010
with,

1491
01:31:08,010 --> 01:31:12,570
although she seems like she would be a
hard girl too to wool as she is really

1492
01:31:12,571 --> 01:31:15,810
intelligent and I am still am
unsure if she likes me at all.

1493
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:19,650
I was wondering what you think and if you
have any tips on how to really impress

1494
01:31:19,651 --> 01:31:23,610
girls besides the cliche, confidence
are expensive. Shit. All right dude.

1495
01:31:23,611 --> 01:31:27,370
You said something back here that
really just rang a bell wasting.

1496
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:31,620
We used two or three. Two. I am.
Okay. This sentence right here, dude.

1497
01:31:31,621 --> 01:31:34,740
I am now a freshman in college and
I've made no friends on account of my

1498
01:31:34,741 --> 01:31:39,510
horrific people skills. All
right, dude, that's right there.

1499
01:31:39,511 --> 01:31:42,720
That's the money right there. That's
what you need to work on. All right.

1500
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:45,780
Through this girl's still in fucking
high school. You're off at college.

1501
01:31:46,020 --> 01:31:50,040
You know what I mean? You were college.
You are college. You're living at college.

1502
01:31:50,220 --> 01:31:55,110
That is the ultimate fucking
nightclub for the next four years.

1503
01:31:55,620 --> 01:32:00,400
It's the greatest nightclub of all
fucking time is living at college.

1504
01:32:00,700 --> 01:32:03,970
Your, there's just women everywhere.
They're on every fucking floor.

1505
01:32:04,090 --> 01:32:06,340
They're in every goddamn class.
You don't even have to, you know,

1506
01:32:06,341 --> 01:32:09,400
you don't have to walk into a nightclub
like, hey baby, what's you sign?

1507
01:32:09,580 --> 01:32:13,870
Did somebody steal the lights out of
this guy and put him in your eyes?

1508
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:17,980
Right? You don't have to come up with
stupid shit like that. You have a,

1509
01:32:17,981 --> 01:32:22,480
you know what? I always find it's easy
to pick up women when you're both,

1510
01:32:22,810 --> 01:32:25,870
there's a reason that both of
you were there like at the gym.

1511
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:30,670
You're both there to work out. You're on
a train. You're both going home, you know,

1512
01:32:30,671 --> 01:32:33,970
they don't have their guard up as much
as when they go into the fucking Texas

1513
01:32:33,971 --> 01:32:37,780
chainsaw massacre. Fucking
meat locker. That is a Goddamn

1514
01:32:39,450 --> 01:32:42,740
nightclub. All right, so this is
what you need to do. All right.

1515
01:32:42,940 --> 01:32:47,680
I think right now you're saying like
you just said that all basically all

1516
01:32:47,681 --> 01:32:48,491
college girls,

1517
01:32:48,491 --> 01:32:53,491
a big titted and shallow and I think a
lot of it has to do with kind of your,

1518
01:32:53,501 --> 01:32:56,470
your um,
your,

1519
01:32:56,471 --> 01:32:59,260
your hopeless failing right now that
you don't know how to talk to people and

1520
01:32:59,261 --> 01:33:01,930
you don't know how to get things going.
Okay? That's part of being a freshman.

1521
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:05,350
It's supposed to seem like a,
a bigger universe than you can handle,

1522
01:33:05,530 --> 01:33:09,250
but what you need to do is you need to
work on your horrific people skills,

1523
01:33:09,550 --> 01:33:13,510
all right? And it is a skill
that you can work on, all right?

1524
01:33:13,540 --> 01:33:14,770
Just like catching a football.

1525
01:33:14,890 --> 01:33:17,260
I'm never going to be able to
catch a football like Jerry Rice,

1526
01:33:17,261 --> 01:33:20,500
but if I fucking do it enough times,
I can catch the fucking thing, right?

1527
01:33:21,910 --> 01:33:24,580
Maybe imitate somebody is end zone dance,
but you're going to get in the game.

1528
01:33:24,581 --> 01:33:29,581
So what you need to do is understand that
you kind of putting that girl up on a

1529
01:33:29,621 --> 01:33:33,810
pedestal, you don't really know
her. And I think that that the,

1530
01:33:33,870 --> 01:33:37,060
the comfort of kind of already
having your foot in the door,

1531
01:33:37,061 --> 01:33:38,470
I bet you were a lot more comfortable.

1532
01:33:38,471 --> 01:33:40,590
I bet you were real comfortable with
the fact that you're just kind of being

1533
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:42,310
friends and the pressure was,
was,

1534
01:33:42,640 --> 01:33:46,740
was kind of taken off the whole prom
and that type of thing. You're, you're,

1535
01:33:46,930 --> 01:33:50,410
you know, you're shy, so you take
like baby steps, you know what I mean?

1536
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:54,100
Instead of taking the big step and trying
to grab her titty on the first date.

1537
01:33:54,460 --> 01:33:55,810
I'm joking,
but you know what I mean?

1538
01:33:56,320 --> 01:33:58,000
So this is what I would
do if I was use seriously.

1539
01:33:58,001 --> 01:33:59,970
I'm kind of fucking around here,
but I know this is like a,

1540
01:33:59,971 --> 01:34:02,800
a serious subject for you.
So this is all seriousness.

1541
01:34:02,801 --> 01:34:06,950
Just what you gotta do is just you gotta.

1542
01:34:06,970 --> 01:34:11,110
You gotta force yourself out of
your shell, you know, I mean,

1543
01:34:11,111 --> 01:34:14,860
if you say hello to a girl,
she's not going to punch
you in the face or whatever.

1544
01:34:15,100 --> 01:34:18,220
Just really write down on a
piece of paper, what's, what the,

1545
01:34:19,390 --> 01:34:22,570
the humiliation or whatever, the fear you
have, what you think's going to happen.

1546
01:34:22,571 --> 01:34:24,880
I'm telling you, a lot of times when
you do that and you actually read it,

1547
01:34:25,090 --> 01:34:27,970
you realize how ridiculous it is.
And

1548
01:34:29,470 --> 01:34:30,303
I'm telling you,

1549
01:34:30,850 --> 01:34:33,340
they're never going to be better
looking then when they're in college.

1550
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:37,870
All of you guys, you're at [inaudible],
you fucking, you're right off.

1551
01:34:37,871 --> 01:34:42,370
You have right off the assembly line in
Detroit. Dude, fuck that college girl.

1552
01:34:42,371 --> 01:34:44,680
I mean, whatever, God bless,
I'm sure she's a nice person,

1553
01:34:44,920 --> 01:34:49,810
but you got to get in the game and you
got to start a crush and ass as they say

1554
01:34:49,811 --> 01:34:53,650
in fucking old school. That's what you
should be doing there. And, uh, you know,

1555
01:34:53,680 --> 01:34:55,330
go out with as many girls as you can,

1556
01:34:55,331 --> 01:34:59,870
see what you like and be coming up with
the list as far as what's the kind of

1557
01:34:59,871 --> 01:35:03,320
girl you eventually want to stay with.
And in the meantime,

1558
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:07,130
you bang a couple of big titted shallow
girls. You always wear a condom.

1559
01:35:07,880 --> 01:35:12,410
Unacceptable not to wear one dude.
It ain't fucking worth it. And uh,

1560
01:35:13,880 --> 01:35:15,440
you know,
then you got your stories,

1561
01:35:16,100 --> 01:35:19,340
then you got your fucking stories
and when you get married, you know,

1562
01:35:19,940 --> 01:35:23,240
and he'd go down to the Dunkin donuts
and you want to bang the girl behind the

1563
01:35:23,241 --> 01:35:27,920
counter, you know, the temptation won't
be as great because you're fucked.

1564
01:35:27,921 --> 01:35:32,420
All those big tented whores at college.
All right, so psych yourself up.

1565
01:35:32,530 --> 01:35:35,390
Do it even tell even like, you know, if
you got some friends there at school,

1566
01:35:35,630 --> 01:35:38,930
just be open about it. Go. God Damn
it, I got it. I got no game with girls.

1567
01:35:38,990 --> 01:35:43,010
Just say it. Get it out there. I got no
game with girls. Come on, help me out.

1568
01:35:43,970 --> 01:35:47,570
You know, be a wing man. Do
something. I got to get fucking laid.

1569
01:35:47,720 --> 01:35:51,590
Just get it out there and I'll tell you
as much as cock block and assholes as

1570
01:35:51,591 --> 01:35:54,580
guys can be when someone's open
and honest about like that. Yeah.

1571
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:56,090
If I have some guy ever said that to me,

1572
01:35:56,091 --> 01:35:59,690
there's no fucking way I wouldn't try
to help him out. So you'll be all right.

1573
01:36:00,620 --> 01:36:02,300
Plus it's your first
semester, so you're, you're,

1574
01:36:02,301 --> 01:36:05,090
you're making everything bigger than
it is. All right. So there you go.

1575
01:36:05,091 --> 01:36:08,990
Let you miss him. Get Out of
your shelf and forget about
that girl. Okay. And then,

1576
01:36:09,020 --> 01:36:10,580
you know what, after this, you know,

1577
01:36:10,581 --> 01:36:13,430
your first two semesters you're going to
come home with a little bit of swagger.

1578
01:36:13,610 --> 01:36:15,830
You might be able to bang
that broad. They're back, uh,

1579
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:19,010
when she's done with their little
fucking pottery class, you never know.

1580
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:21,200
Might come all full circle.
All right,

1581
01:36:21,201 --> 01:36:24,290
I only got time for a couple
more questions then I got
to get going here. Um,

1582
01:36:26,320 --> 01:36:28,550
Oh, before we get going,
why don't I just do this?

1583
01:36:28,580 --> 01:36:30,260
I'll save the questions until next week.

1584
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:33,080
Or maybe I'll read a couple of
quick ones just to let you know.

1585
01:36:33,081 --> 01:36:36,830
These are my upcoming gigs for November.
Um,

1586
01:36:37,250 --> 01:36:40,400
November 6th, sixth, the thought
thought, thought, thought.

1587
01:36:40,401 --> 01:36:42,890
2009 I'm going to be a
town hall in New York City.

1588
01:36:43,160 --> 01:36:47,990
People tickets are going fast.
All right, and if you act now,

1589
01:36:47,991 --> 01:36:50,750
I will throw in a bill. Burke
can opener. No, seriously.

1590
01:36:52,130 --> 01:36:53,630
It's 1300 seat theater.

1591
01:36:53,631 --> 01:36:58,631
And last I heard we'd already
sold a thousand and that
was a couple of weeks ago

1592
01:36:59,900 --> 01:37:04,310
and I just had a flashback
to that Chappelle show.

1593
01:37:04,311 --> 01:37:07,070
Shit sketch. Ah, and
word. That was weeks ago.

1594
01:37:07,130 --> 01:37:10,700
Remember that you slapped me in the
face and he said that was weeks ago.

1595
01:37:10,910 --> 01:37:14,240
It's one of the greatest
lines of all time. Um,

1596
01:37:16,380 --> 01:37:16,701
all right,

1597
01:37:16,701 --> 01:37:20,660
I'm going to be at the town hall in New
York City and the next day I don't have

1598
01:37:20,661 --> 01:37:25,040
it on my website. November 7th, 2009 I'm
going to be at Boston at a Gyno, Serena,

1599
01:37:25,070 --> 01:37:29,240
wherever the bu terriers play during the
Denis leary comics come home the 15th

1600
01:37:29,241 --> 01:37:31,010
anniversary.
It's going to be great.

1601
01:37:31,011 --> 01:37:34,670
Going to get to see a bunch
of friends of mine. Um,

1602
01:37:35,720 --> 01:37:40,580
what else do I got? The improv in
Tempe, Arizona. The 19th 20th and 21st.

1603
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:44,900
And then what else? That's
it. That's all for November.

1604
01:37:44,901 --> 01:37:47,810
Then I'm in Cleveland and in Seattle.
And then I do my special.

1605
01:37:47,811 --> 01:37:51,260
So please come out. Please continue
to support me. I really appreciate it.

1606
01:37:51,740 --> 01:37:55,200
And I didn't have time to
talk about Rick flair video.

1607
01:37:55,210 --> 01:37:59,790
Somebody brought up the ric flair chop
and I had not watched Rick flare in years

1608
01:38:00,390 --> 01:38:02,400
and two,
if you really want to laugh,

1609
01:38:02,970 --> 01:38:07,950
please go on youtube and just
watch ric flair. Hypen is matches.

1610
01:38:07,951 --> 01:38:12,750
It's one he said to that, he said there's
one of him holding up these loafers.

1611
01:38:12,751 --> 01:38:16,590
Did I talk about this last week? I
can't remember. Look up ric flair.

1612
01:38:16,620 --> 01:38:17,820
Golden Spoon.

1613
01:38:18,480 --> 01:38:21,810
There's another one where he tells this
guy that this fucking dude that his

1614
01:38:21,811 --> 01:38:26,610
shoes are worth more than his house.
Um, and then there's a great interview,

1615
01:38:27,240 --> 01:38:29,490
you know, where he talks
about the movie, the wrestler,

1616
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:32,820
and he just seems like the
greatest guy ever. Like, you know,

1617
01:38:32,821 --> 01:38:35,700
his wrestling career is over. He's
not bitter. He's really thankful.

1618
01:38:35,701 --> 01:38:38,490
It's just like, I, once again,

1619
01:38:38,491 --> 01:38:43,491
I became an even bigger ric flair fan
watching and it's r I c f a flair ric,

1620
01:38:45,541 --> 01:38:50,280
the ric flair flop ric flair chops,
ric flair flips.

1621
01:38:50,460 --> 01:38:54,480
He's got some of the greatest fucking
videos out there and you just realize what

1622
01:38:54,481 --> 01:38:58,500
a true legend.
What a fucking show man.

1623
01:38:58,501 --> 01:39:02,760
What a what a just a fucking unbelievable
entertainer athlete and everything

1624
01:39:02,761 --> 01:39:06,760
that this guy was in the fucking things
that he put his body through. Man.

1625
01:39:06,770 --> 01:39:10,110
I would, I would love at some point
that guys ever doing a signing anywhere.

1626
01:39:10,111 --> 01:39:14,370
I'm fucking all over it,
you know? Um, that's it.

1627
01:39:14,430 --> 01:39:17,460
And that's it for this week.
I hope you guys enjoyed the podcast.

1628
01:39:17,461 --> 01:39:20,220
Sorry it was a little bit short.
I'll get to the questions next week.

1629
01:39:20,550 --> 01:39:25,230
Hope all you guys have a good week.
Um,

1630
01:39:26,460 --> 01:39:27,960
oh man,
there was another great question.

1631
01:39:27,961 --> 01:39:31,710
This guy was asking why is tranny
porn on heterosexual websites?

1632
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:36,270
Fuck, I wanted to answer that one too.
I got to get to that one next week.

1633
01:39:36,300 --> 01:39:37,920
All right there.
I'm leaving you on a cliffhanger.

1634
01:39:37,921 --> 01:39:39,840
I'll talk to you guys next week.
Uh,

1635
01:39:40,810 --> 01:39:41,950
that's it.
Don't take any shit.

1636
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:13,430
That's where she
died.
