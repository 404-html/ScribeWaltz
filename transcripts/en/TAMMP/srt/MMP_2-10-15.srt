1
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:02,800
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02,801 --> 00:00:06,160
It's bill burr and as some Monday
morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:06,161 --> 00:00:10,180
February 10th, 2015. How's it going? How,

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:15,190
um,
I'm back in the USA.

5
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:21,270
I just landed at JFK a couple of hours
ago and I've been trying to get this

6
00:00:21,281 --> 00:00:22,200
fucking thing done in my,

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,100
my Olympus ls 10 that I bought like six,

8
00:00:27,101 --> 00:00:29,230
seven fucking years ago.
It finally died.

9
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,540
I think it finally died after
a trip around the world.

10
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:35,320
The old girl couldn't take it,
you know, she went quietly,

11
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:40,720
quietly in the night. Um, anyway,
so I'm psyched to be back.

12
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:44,410
I had a great time and just a
whirlwind tour around the world.

13
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,010
I don't even know where the fuck I am
right now and I don't even know what time

14
00:00:48,011 --> 00:00:49,720
it is. Um, yeah, I do.

15
00:00:49,721 --> 00:00:54,310
It's 5:53 PM east coast
time according to my, um,

16
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,370
my little fucking little, little
iPad thing here. Uh, Ah Shit,

17
00:01:00,371 --> 00:01:02,980
I don't know what to tell you guys.
What the fuck do you want from me?

18
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,870
You know all you can see out there who,

19
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:09,670
who gave me shit because the
podcast is so late this week.

20
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:10,690
All right?

21
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:15,690
You didn't have the fucking decency Digi
to go onto my website and maybe have a

22
00:01:15,971 --> 00:01:19,390
little bit of empathy. You'd
be like, Oh, oh, that's why.

23
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:24,160
That's why it's late. He's
flying back from Mumbai, India.

24
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,230
Okay.

25
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:30,640
It's fucking three hours to do by another
fucking 13 hours on the Goddamn plane

26
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:31,730
at some dose.

27
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:36,520
Miss Their connection when we were in
Dubai in their plane was on their planes.

28
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:37,840
That bag was on the plane,

29
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,620
so they don't let the
cont on the plane yet.

30
00:01:41,621 --> 00:01:45,640
They spend 15 minutes trying to find 20
minutes trying to find the fucking bag

31
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:48,250
and they take it off the plane. It's
like, at that point, why don't you,

32
00:01:48,251 --> 00:01:52,900
let's just let the asshole on the plane
so we can all get outta here. Right.

33
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,200
I mean, that's what I was doing. Well,
you know when I used to run an airline,

34
00:01:56,201 --> 00:01:57,034
that's how I did it.

35
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:02,490
So I don't know what's going on with
United Arab Emirates and Mercedes,

36
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,300
whatever the fuck the airline
is that I flew. Uh, anyways,

37
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:09,520
first of all,
before I get going,

38
00:02:09,521 --> 00:02:13,210
thank you to everybody came out
to my shows in India, China,

39
00:02:13,211 --> 00:02:15,940
Singapore or whatever the
fuck I was this week. Uh,

40
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:20,970
it was my first trip to
fuck in Asia and I had a, a,

41
00:02:20,971 --> 00:02:25,690
a great time. I did not
get caned in Singapore. Um,

42
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:30,780
I didn't have any secret police in China
and no religious crazy people got me

43
00:02:32,741 --> 00:02:37,090
when I was in India, you
know, so I, I survived it.

44
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,510
Singapore was great. China was great. I
don't fucking know what to tell you all.

45
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,460
Let's just talk about India.
All right? First and foremost,

46
00:02:45,461 --> 00:02:48,880
the second you get to India, this is
what you're going to see. Mumbai, India,

47
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:54,090
you are going to see the greatest drivers
in Jay Walker's you've ever seen in

48
00:02:54,521 --> 00:02:55,420
your fucking life.

49
00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:00,150
I've never seen just complete fucking
chaos when it comes driving. Like,

50
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:05,970
like I saw in India and even like the
old people were good at Jay walking and

51
00:03:05,971 --> 00:03:08,640
what killed me.
They never changed their gait,

52
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,710
I guess gay does that running whatever,

53
00:03:10,711 --> 00:03:14,700
whatever fucking speed they were walking
when they stepped down and traffic,

54
00:03:14,701 --> 00:03:18,630
they just stepped out and just kept
walking at the same pace to traffic.

55
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:22,980
Never sped up, never slowed down.
Nobody got hit. It was unreal.

56
00:03:22,981 --> 00:03:27,090
I've never been in the back of a cab
so many times going, ah, well watch it,

57
00:03:27,091 --> 00:03:30,420
watch it, watch it. And just nobody
slows down. Nobody speeds up.

58
00:03:30,421 --> 00:03:32,850
Everybody just keeps doing what
they're doing. It's like, it was like,

59
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:37,470
it's like watching Chevy chase and
Caddyshack when he's a fucking Putin

60
00:03:37,471 --> 00:03:41,340
barefoot. No, no, no, no, no,
no. Saturday Dah, Dah, Dah.
That's how they fucking do it.

61
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:46,830
I'm definitely the most insane,
craziest,

62
00:03:46,831 --> 00:03:49,520
coolest country I've ever
been to was definitely, uh,

63
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,870
at least that city man that was,
um,

64
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:55,720
it was something else that people
were really cool. Uh, you know,

65
00:03:55,721 --> 00:03:59,650
at first you freak out, you
know, when you show up. And uh,

66
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,080
we landed there at like midnight.

67
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:02,180
Okay.

68
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:05,070
And, um, you know,

69
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,010
we showed up to the hotel and there's
a guy with like a machine gun in

70
00:04:08,011 --> 00:04:12,740
somebody's checking for bombs
underneath the fucking car, you know,

71
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,160
which creeped me out at first.

72
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:18,350
And there was like a metal detector
going into the fucking hotel within.

73
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,190
I was just like, ah, now that I'm in here,

74
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,350
I got a guy with a machine
guns standing up front.

75
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:24,600
This is way better than a red roof inn.

76
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,690
So I guess it's just a big,
I guess maybe back in 2008,

77
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:32,700
they had a terrorist attack.

78
00:04:32,701 --> 00:04:35,220
So ever since then and the hotel
was and get attacked or whatever.

79
00:04:35,221 --> 00:04:37,830
So now they just have a guard. They
were all the time. But other than that,

80
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:41,340
I didn't see anybody with a gun.
It's a really safe city.

81
00:04:41,341 --> 00:04:44,700
The food was fucking tremendous.
And uh,

82
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:49,200
I did the show the last show of the,
um,

83
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,460
okay.

84
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:56,190
Of the, uh, of the tour. Sorry guys. It's
going to be a lot of fucking mental, uh,

85
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:59,920
brain farts here this week. I'm just
trying to take in everything that I saw.

86
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,593
Um,

87
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:05,230
it was awesome and I got
to hang out afterwards and
went out and got dinner with

88
00:05:05,231 --> 00:05:10,231
me and like 20 Indian comics and just
sat there talking comedy for a good half

89
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:15,880
hour, 45 minutes before I had to
go to, uh, the airport, which was,

90
00:05:15,881 --> 00:05:19,720
uh, one of the highlights of my
career to be honest with you,

91
00:05:19,721 --> 00:05:22,300
have to be able to talk to people on the
other side of the world that do what I

92
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:26,400
do. You know, and um, you know, this,

93
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,450
these guys want to send
you a link to this,

94
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,900
although maybe I shouldn't because
I know that trying to lay low,

95
00:05:31,901 --> 00:05:35,220
but for those who listened to
the podcast I did over there,

96
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:39,670
those same guys got in trouble because
they just did a fucking roast. Right.

97
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:46,000
And according to them, it was way tamer
than anything in the, in the u s but uh,

98
00:05:46,001 --> 00:05:49,120
they haven't had, I guess a lot of
roasts that might've been the first one.

99
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,010
And they did it,
they roast it.

100
00:05:51,011 --> 00:05:55,390
A couple of Bollywood guys and
everything was fine. Everybody laughed,

101
00:05:55,391 --> 00:05:59,390
everybody had a good time.
And then for whatever reason,

102
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:03,680
either they posted it online or somebody
else did and the second went online,

103
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:07,310
you know, you know what happens?
The second something goes online,

104
00:06:07,311 --> 00:06:10,430
everybody starts going, oh my
God, what about the children?

105
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,240
What about the fucking religious
thing that I believe in?

106
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,830
What will this comedy due to that?
You know what I mean? Like they will,

107
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:23,600
it's just fucking roast. Everybody's
laughing, having a good time, so whatever.

108
00:06:23,601 --> 00:06:26,990
So they,
everybody freaked out and um,

109
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,790
you've got like 8 million hits and uh,

110
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:35,390
they're like sort of in trouble but
not in trouble, but they're in trouble.

111
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:38,970
Like they could spend
eight years in courts with,

112
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,150
I dunno what lawsuits or whatever.

113
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:45,110
I was reading some of the comments and
someone was just going like, you know,

114
00:06:45,111 --> 00:06:49,240
what does this say? What is this going to
do to society and Blah, blah, blah, blah,

115
00:06:49,241 --> 00:06:52,430
blah. And it's like, have you fucking
looked out your window over there?

116
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,000
Jesus Christ,
they got like in New Delhi,

117
00:06:56,001 --> 00:06:59,110
they have like a major problem with rape.

118
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,430
Is a roast going to make that any worse?
You know what I mean?

119
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:05,900
Jesus crabbing.
I mean,

120
00:07:05,901 --> 00:07:08,480
I'm not even going to fucking say some
of the shit that I saw over there.

121
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:13,040
I saw a stray cow,
a stray cow.

122
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:17,000
It's just as fucking,
it's awesome. I don't see,

123
00:07:17,001 --> 00:07:19,670
I don't want to say a half of this shit
cause I don't want to scare people from

124
00:07:19,671 --> 00:07:22,730
going over there because it's one of the
coolest fucking places I ever went to.

125
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:28,460
Um, but yeah, you'll see like a
stray cow eating garbage next to her.

126
00:07:28,461 --> 00:07:31,580
Like a Mercedes Benz driving
by. Okay. So you got,

127
00:07:31,581 --> 00:07:35,420
you got the entire fucking colors
of the rainbow there. It was.

128
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:38,750
It was awesome man. And the
uh, the food was insane.

129
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,630
Can't say enough about that.
And um,

130
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:43,140
okay.

131
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:45,420
Other than that,
what else did I get a chance to see?

132
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:46,680
I didn't get a chance
to see her. They, oh,

133
00:07:46,681 --> 00:07:50,610
this was the scary thing was I went into
the country and because we we fuck with,

134
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:55,260
with the Indian people when
they come to the u s I guess,

135
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:59,610
cause we're trying to make sure that they
don't illegally immigrate, immigrate,

136
00:07:59,611 --> 00:08:03,900
whatever to our fucking country immigrant.
Right.

137
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:08,490
And immigrate. Yeah. Immigrant. That's
how it is. Emigrate, you leave, immigrate,

138
00:08:08,491 --> 00:08:13,260
you come in, there you go, Bill. Now
you worked out yourself then. Yeah. Um,

139
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:17,770
anyways, so we fuck with them.
So this is tit for tat thing.

140
00:08:17,771 --> 00:08:21,690
So then they fuck with us, specifically
Americans from the west coast.

141
00:08:21,691 --> 00:08:24,240
So they don't fuck with anybody
from the east coast I guess.

142
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:25,800
Okay.

143
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,610
Um, as far as like you come to the country
and then once you get to the country,

144
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:30,021
you,

145
00:08:30,021 --> 00:08:34,410
you need another piece of paper stamped
by the government so you could fucking

146
00:08:34,411 --> 00:08:37,380
leave, you know, or it's
some Bronx tale shit.

147
00:08:37,381 --> 00:08:40,080
Like now you can't leave until you
get this fucking thing and then it's,

148
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:41,470
yeah.

149
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,210
You know,
just some big pain in the ass thing.

150
00:08:43,211 --> 00:08:46,440
That took like two and a half
hours for me to get. But, um,

151
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,920
I guess they've had problems
with artists on the west coast,

152
00:08:50,921 --> 00:08:55,070
but not in the east coast,
which means to me that maybe somebody,

153
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,610
a governor or a senator of
a state on the west coast,

154
00:08:58,611 --> 00:09:01,160
like maybe Schwartzenegger said something.
I have no idea what,

155
00:09:01,161 --> 00:09:04,760
but somebody said something, somebody
pissed off, somebody snuck. So you know,

156
00:09:04,761 --> 00:09:09,070
old freckles has got to get up in the
fucking morning and I go down to a,

157
00:09:09,071 --> 00:09:12,440
I didn't know what the hell it was,
but I had this,

158
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:18,170
this big like envelope
as shit with my passport,

159
00:09:18,171 --> 00:09:22,670
my working visa, the fucking contract
for the show, all of that stuff.

160
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:28,010
I go inside the building and the,
the promoters not allowed to go with me.

161
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,200
So now I'm in there.

162
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:34,640
I mean this was like one of the biggest
like touristy things that I got to do,

163
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,000
like really experienced,

164
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,570
be in an Indian and I fucking go up to
the third floor and this big long line of

165
00:09:41,571 --> 00:09:45,380
people all from different countries
trying to get this piece of paper so they

166
00:09:45,381 --> 00:09:48,830
can fucking leave and a,
the line move quickly.

167
00:09:48,831 --> 00:09:52,010
But then they just got you into another
room and it was like being at the

168
00:09:52,011 --> 00:09:54,260
fucking DMV and you know how that goes.

169
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:56,750
You're going to show up
with a stack of papers,

170
00:09:56,751 --> 00:09:59,060
like the God damn phone book
and when you get up there,

171
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:03,290
you just see the look on their face. You
like, Oh fuck you. What else do I need?

172
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:06,560
And there's always something else.
So whatever.

173
00:10:06,561 --> 00:10:11,250
I kind of charmed the lady I was talking
to like, uh, I couldn't understand her,

174
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,840
she couldn't really understand me and
I finally was able to convey it to her

175
00:10:14,841 --> 00:10:19,460
that I was a comedian and she
kind of gave me this look like,

176
00:10:19,461 --> 00:10:21,980
really? You think you're funny?
And I forget what the fuck I said,

177
00:10:21,981 --> 00:10:23,450
but I was able to make a smile,

178
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:28,640
which was good because eventually I needed
the promoter to come up there to help

179
00:10:28,641 --> 00:10:31,070
me get over the last leg of it.

180
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:35,630
But what's funny about Indian people is
they got this thing they do when you ask

181
00:10:35,631 --> 00:10:39,890
them a question, they don't
shake their head no or not. Yes,

182
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,650
they do like this bobblehead thing.

183
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:49,060
And I was sitting there like this white
dude in Hong Kong told me that they're

184
00:10:49,531 --> 00:10:51,630
going to do that.
And it actually means yes,

185
00:10:51,631 --> 00:10:54,630
you're going to think that they're being
assholes, but it actually means yes.

186
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:58,790
So this lady kept doing it. I kept
going. Does that mean yes. I mean, yes.

187
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:02,700
Long story short, one of the comics told
me later on that it doesn't mean yes,

188
00:11:02,701 --> 00:11:07,430
it doesn't mean no. It means that
there, how did he put it there? Uh,

189
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,000
okay.

190
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,660
Politely accepting your existence
or something like that. Yeah,

191
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,200
what it was.
But um,

192
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:17,660
yeah,

193
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:20,990
everybody that I asked a
question too there, I was like,

194
00:11:20,991 --> 00:11:22,490
so if I give him all this stuff,

195
00:11:22,491 --> 00:11:26,060
like I'm going to be able to get
to piece of paper, I'll be fine.

196
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:30,110
And then they do like that bobble
head like a, you know, maybe you will,

197
00:11:30,111 --> 00:11:31,010
maybe you won't,
you know,

198
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:35,090
maybe you'll be on that plane back
to the u s maybe a you'll be in that.

199
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,620
You'd be in the garbage next to the cow
tomorrow. I don't know. I don't know how.

200
00:11:39,621 --> 00:11:41,040
I don't,
I don't know what to tell you.

201
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:42,860
So I'm just going to do this
fucking thing with my head.

202
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:48,260
So I got a big kick out of that.
And here's the thing too.

203
00:11:48,261 --> 00:11:49,640
Like I've really been
working on my temper.

204
00:11:49,641 --> 00:11:53,250
I stayed up there for two hours and 45
minutes. I never lost my temper once.

205
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:56,730
At one point, I sat down, I looked
over at the lady and I was just like,

206
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,260
I looked down at the floor,
it's like,

207
00:11:58,261 --> 00:12:00,510
how fucking long as it's going
to fucking this the worst.

208
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:02,250
I got sort of whispered debt,

209
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:06,330
but then I just looked around the room
and I saw this family of four from the

210
00:12:06,331 --> 00:12:08,520
Philippines and they would in front
of me and I'm like, all right,

211
00:12:08,521 --> 00:12:11,910
they're still here. The guy
was behind me, he's still here,

212
00:12:11,911 --> 00:12:15,570
so everybody's waiting the same amount
of time, you know, for the love of God,

213
00:12:15,571 --> 00:12:20,220
Bill fucking relax. Um, so whatever.

214
00:12:20,221 --> 00:12:23,930
But uh, I just um, got, okay,

215
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,410
I saw so much shit over there so
quickly went down to this. Um,

216
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:33,320
they haven't like the street fair
thing and they had all this, you know,

217
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:34,320
brought my wife down there.

218
00:12:34,321 --> 00:12:38,730
They had all this amazing clothing and
all that type of shit and artwork and all

219
00:12:38,731 --> 00:12:41,250
that type of stuff. I, it's just one of
those things. You just walk around like,

220
00:12:41,251 --> 00:12:44,510
I'm, I'm in fucking India right
now. I couldn't believe it. And, uh,

221
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:48,360
then what's funny is you go out to go
do the show and you feel like you're in

222
00:12:48,361 --> 00:12:53,310
the United States. It's the exact same
thing. People laugh at the same shit.

223
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,330
It's just that when Singapore,
Hong Kong and India,

224
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,860
they had like these, you know,
don't talk about the government,

225
00:13:01,861 --> 00:13:04,320
don't talk about religion,
don't talk about race.

226
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,210
And then you go to the show and the comic
in front of you is talking about all

227
00:13:09,211 --> 00:13:12,900
of that shit and basically how it works
for you to really get in trouble with

228
00:13:12,901 --> 00:13:16,290
that. You would have to be
basically living in the country,

229
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:19,440
build up a reputation for
doing it all the time.

230
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:23,210
And then eventually one of
those governments will be
like, all right, let's see,

231
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,160
let's send somebody down there. And
then they'd go down, they'd watch you.

232
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:30,000
And in all you'd get is like a fine,

233
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:34,650
either they'd find the promoter or the
venue or possibly the performer. I Dunno.

234
00:13:34,651 --> 00:13:39,360
It's not really like, you know, harshly,

235
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:42,020
um,
and forced,

236
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:47,920
which is actually was a pleasant
surprise with the way everybody's taking

237
00:13:47,921 --> 00:13:49,920
everything.
So God damn seriously lately,

238
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:53,640
like every fucking thing that
you say now is just like,

239
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,550
okay,

240
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:59,870
I mean it's fucking ridiculous and I
really think comics have to hold the

241
00:13:59,871 --> 00:14:03,750
fucking line here and
not apologize or else,

242
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:05,781
I mean,

243
00:14:05,781 --> 00:14:08,990
I don't know where it goes from there
unless you want comedians just up there

244
00:14:08,991 --> 00:14:11,390
talking about widgets.
Um,

245
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:16,130
and what kills me about the so called
outrageous is such a small percentage of

246
00:14:16,131 --> 00:14:18,680
the population.
First of all,

247
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:23,240
you realize how many people could
just give a fuck about standup comedy.

248
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:27,770
Like if you walked down to the amount
of people that the small percentage of

249
00:14:27,771 --> 00:14:31,220
people who've actually been
to a live show, you know,

250
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:35,360
it doesn't even fucking appeal to like
80% of the population as far as I know.

251
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:38,900
You know what I mean?
They're doing other things.

252
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:43,580
There may be into music or they just
watch sports, but like, you know,

253
00:14:43,581 --> 00:14:48,350
it's fucked up. Like, I love standup
comedy before I became a comedian.

254
00:14:48,351 --> 00:14:53,351
I only went to one show ever and I was
almost 24 by the time I started so I

255
00:14:54,841 --> 00:14:59,640
could legally could have gone to
stand up shows for like six years,

256
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:04,590
18 plus. And then once I was 21 I
could go to anything and I never went.

257
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:10,800
I only went one time and I
wanted to do it for a living. So

258
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:17,150
I dunno.
All right.

259
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,730
And of course this stupid
thing just crapped out on me.

260
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:22,580
I'm really having a rough go here
with the technology on the strip.

261
00:15:22,581 --> 00:15:26,720
I apologize to everybody. Uh,
anyways, what was I saying? Um,

262
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:30,710
I guess I was just talking about how few
people actually even give a shit enough

263
00:15:30,711 --> 00:15:35,030
to even go to a standup show.
Um, so if a comic says something,

264
00:15:35,031 --> 00:15:38,140
it's really not affecting that much of
the population that really they could

265
00:15:38,141 --> 00:15:42,320
have fuck lives their life by what a
fucking comedian says and a God damn joke.

266
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:48,100
It's so ridiculous. It's
just gotta be a, I dunno,

267
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,930
I'm really hoping this is just a fad

268
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,290
to be taking comedian seriously.

269
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:58,960
Anyways, that's the end of the whole,
um, the whole world w world tour thing.

270
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:02,770
Um, it was really insane. I went
to five countries in three weeks.

271
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:07,690
I did a 11 shows in nine different cities,
five different countries.

272
00:16:07,691 --> 00:16:10,510
I don't know how many
different time zones and uh,

273
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:14,260
so first time I ever was in Asia and um,

274
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:19,330
I had just, it was, it's just a part of
the world. I never, I always wanted to go,

275
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:23,770
you know, and I just never, you know,

276
00:16:23,771 --> 00:16:26,770
he's just don't think you're ever going
to get to do something like that. So, uh,

277
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,170
thanks to everybody
listening to this podcast,

278
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:33,460
watch us my specials and all that type
of shit and actually learned something.

279
00:16:33,461 --> 00:16:37,980
People downloading my specials illegally
isn't always a bad thing. I mean,

280
00:16:37,981 --> 00:16:41,590
it kills me monetarily,
but had they not done that overseas,

281
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:46,150
then they wouldn't have
seen me. So, uh, I dunno.

282
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,370
I'm starting to rethink some of that shit.

283
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:53,400
Although I do stand hard is far as
I got a hard line on the fucking,

284
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,450
I stand hard yet with my dick standing up.

285
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:59,020
I got a hard line when it comes to fucking
tape and be in a club when I'm trying

286
00:16:59,021 --> 00:17:02,910
out new shit. Um, that's,

287
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:07,810
that's fucking brutal cause then I go
to town and my new shit is already old

288
00:17:07,811 --> 00:17:10,180
shit and it's just,
you can't write fast enough,

289
00:17:10,181 --> 00:17:13,600
so can all you fucking teeny boppers uh,

290
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,220
just take that into consideration.

291
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:21,030
I know it's all about you and your
fucking Facebook pages now and Oh my God,

292
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:25,390
look at me with my selfie and all of that
shit. It's, this was fucking hilarious.

293
00:17:25,391 --> 00:17:29,380
Now is this like the crowd wants
to be famous back in the day.

294
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:32,350
The crowd was cool when they would
just sat there. All right, monkey boy.

295
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,140
He wanted to be famous. Let's see
if you're good enough to be famous.

296
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:38,290
Now it's like half of them aren't
even paying attention to you.

297
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:42,820
They're literally like really bill.
Is that half of them or is it like three,

298
00:17:42,821 --> 00:17:44,200
four people is show?
All right.

299
00:17:44,201 --> 00:17:49,201
Three or four people is show are like
already on their Twitter accounts or

300
00:17:49,251 --> 00:17:52,560
Facebook or whatever the fuck they use.
Um,

301
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,340
talking about themselves,

302
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,740
trying to put myself in their position,

303
00:18:00,741 --> 00:18:04,400
but I just can't picture myself any show
I ever went to when I was a kid. Right.

304
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:10,820
You know, if I paid to go see it,
I would watch it, wouldn't you?

305
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:15,590
He got all fucking day to do your duck
face into the phone, don't ya? All right,

306
00:18:15,591 --> 00:18:19,850
let's do a little, a little bit of
advertising here. A Sherry's berries.

307
00:18:19,851 --> 00:18:23,420
Everybody time is running out.
That is the theme.

308
00:18:23,421 --> 00:18:25,640
Everybody that was written
in all capital letters,

309
00:18:25,641 --> 00:18:30,641
I guess I was supposed to scream that
time is running out Valentine's date this

310
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:35,510
weekend. Don't give yourself a headache
shopping for a gift. Yeah. Why would you?

311
00:18:35,511 --> 00:18:38,930
It's a completely bullshit holiday.
This is why I love Sherry's berries.

312
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:41,540
Just get her some chocolate
covered strawberries.

313
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:45,680
If somebody else picked and then dipped
in chocolate and then your frisbee him

314
00:18:45,681 --> 00:18:49,790
across the table, it go, there you go.
Touch. What do you do you think? Huh?

315
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:55,100
Love you too. Anyways, keep calm
and Barry on with Sherry's berries.

316
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:59,120
Uh,
forget the long lines and crazy shoppers.

317
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,590
I love how they're acting
like it's Christmas.

318
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:05,860
Sherry's berries will deliver
this decadent treat directly
to her door with love

319
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:11,360

and more time with you, sweetheart.

Click on the microphone.

345
00:20:43,601 --> 00:20:46,660
I've said this 20 fucking times.
They're not going to buy now.

346
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,770
They're never going to buy. All
right, here we go. The next one.

347
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:55,500
It's the classic beyond Ds. Me
undies. No more sweaty balls.

348
00:20:55,540 --> 00:21:00,090
Boop, boop, boop. Beyond
these, beyond these, you could
wear him down at the mall.

349
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:04,530
Walk up to that whore at the orange.
Julius. Why did I pick Julius?

350
00:21:04,531 --> 00:21:05,610
Not the rise with debt.

351
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:10,350
Oh no more sweat on your fucking balls
running down your fucking crack. Oh yeah.

352
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:14,820
Even when you do a headstand, but
booboo, you could have dry balls.

353
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:20,310
We really beat it. Drive. Sorry.

354
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:24,570
Um, 90%. That's the percentage of your
lifetime that you spend in your underwear.

355
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:28,600
Unless you Tarzan, right?
And you've free ball it.

356
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:33,660
Can you believe fucking Tom Petty was so
petty that he sued Sam Smith over that

357
00:21:33,661 --> 00:21:37,380
shit or at complete musical genius.

358
00:21:37,381 --> 00:21:41,240
I love both of those fucking songs. I
would never thought to speed up, uh,

359
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,600
Sammy Smith Song there.

360
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:43,970
Okay.

361
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:48,200
It's gotta be weird for Sam Smith
getting sued by that fossil.

362
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:52,370
I don't want to happen to Tom
Petty. He was never, never the Ba,

363
00:21:52,371 --> 00:21:56,180
the a good looking guy, but Jesus
Christ, that guy looks like a, you look.

364
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:58,930
So he works in a fucking mind
shaft in the 18 hundreds.

365
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,550
Ever since he became a traveling wilbury
he kind of lost that 20th century.

366
00:22:03,551 --> 00:22:07,140
Look about him, didn't he? Um, uh,

367
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:08,830
what was that song they used to say?

368
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:13,180
Dad An ad and I can't
fucking remember anyways.

369
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:16,600
90% of the time he likes you spending
in your underwear. All right.

370
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:19,840
Sitting there yelling at a TV,
hoping someone's going to get elected,

371
00:22:19,841 --> 00:22:20,920
that's going to change your life.

372
00:22:20,921 --> 00:22:25,921
Not realizing that you have that all
the power lies within you and underwear.

373
00:22:25,961 --> 00:22:27,640
It gets old fast.
Everybody,

374
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:30,280
you know that feeling of
putting on old saggy underwear,

375
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:31,813
Huh?

376
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:35,890
You need to know the feeling of putting
on great fitting underwear that is two

377
00:22:35,891 --> 00:22:39,910
times softer than cotton. That's
right. They got cotton on the run here.

378
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:44,440
You need to know about me undies.com
beyond these is the most comfortable

379
00:22:44,441 --> 00:22:49,360
underwear you will ever wear. And it's
insane how good they make your balls.

380
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:53,350
Fields, I wouldn't say. And they
make you feel they fit perfectly.

381
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:57,040
They don't ride up on your balls and they
literally pull moisture away from your

382
00:22:57,041 --> 00:23:00,460
skin grows. Uh, so that you stay cool.

383
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:06,550
Does that doesn't make any
sense. All right. You perspire
to keep your body cool.

384
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:10,420
Pulling moisture away would
actually retain heat, wouldn't it?

385
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,870
I have mine on right now and I'm floating.
No I don't.

386
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:18,190
I do wear a couple of pairs other
than the fucking euro trash colors.

387
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:22,380
They are very comfortable and they
do hug my balls very nicely. Uh,

388
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:25,990
they have cool styles for both men and
ladies. Old Ladies get them to everybody.

389
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:29,440
[inaudible] no more sweaty clams.
Oh yeah.

390
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:32,110
Does it matter if you're at the beach?
But booboo,

391
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:36,150
pull it away from your Goddamn Twat.
Ah,

392
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,190
only be wet because you're turned on

393
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,260
so disgusting.
Check out the photos for yourself.

Then when she gets mad,
you just say, listen,

404
00:24:20,531 --> 00:24:24,430
I'm just trying to keep the clamp dry.
I don't understand how else.

All right, legal zoom, everybody.
What's your top New Year's resolution?

407
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,890
To be honest with you,
I don't think it's any of my business,

408
00:24:38,891 --> 00:24:42,830
but if you're like me, it's getting
your life organized. Actually it isn't.

409
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:47,740
It's keeping my temper in
check and reading out loud
a little better. You know,

410
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:51,190
little improvements every year to become
a better me. But where do you begin?

411
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:52,640
A great place.
This

412
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:58,720
is protecting your family and a great
way to take control of your family's

413
00:24:58,721 --> 00:25:01,300
future is making a will or a living trust.

414
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:04,700
It's also a great way to give them a
motivation to fucking kill you. Uh,

415
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,640
that's where legal zoom can help.

your family is legally taken care of.

417

taking control of your financial affairs.

418
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:19,570

432
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:10,720
Where do we go? Here? Let me go back
to the fucking, the questions here.

433
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:16,230
Uh, God, I, there's gotta be a better
way to do this fucking cock podcasts.

434

Something a little more professional.
Well, how far into this are we?

435
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:25,240
1511. What's that? 26 minutes. Okay, let's
continue talking. Oh, by the way. Yeah,

436
00:26:25,241 --> 00:26:26,410
I bet you're all one.
And hey bill,

437
00:26:26,411 --> 00:26:30,070
did you finally have a chance to
watch the super bowl? You know

438
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:35,780
that big football game that's played
every year that your home team one? Yes,

439
00:26:35,781 --> 00:26:39,590
I did. Not only did I watch it
once. Not only did I watch it twice,

440
00:26:39,591 --> 00:26:43,930
I watched it three fucking times. Sorry,
I kind of plug in that she had you.

441
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,230
Um,
I watched it three times and uh,

442
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,800
it's just a hell of a fucking game.
Um,

443
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:57,180
and I actually think Edelman should have
got a co Mvp because not only did he

444
00:26:57,191 --> 00:26:58,120
have a big game,

445
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:02,410
he knocked his defensive
back out of the fucking game,

446
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:08,210
you know, broke the guy's guy. Damn rests
on a wonderful fucking tackle and a,

447
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:12,100
we exploited whoever the fuck they put
in for the guy that broke his risks that

448
00:27:12,101 --> 00:27:15,160
I don't know his name either because I
was traveling around the fucking world

449
00:27:15,161 --> 00:27:18,670
and I don't collect football cards anymore
because they fucked up the whole way

450
00:27:18,671 --> 00:27:20,080
you did it.
You know,

451
00:27:20,081 --> 00:27:23,140
back in the day you could just go
out and buy a post stack of them and

452
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:25,480
eventually you'd get all of them,
you know,

453
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:29,560
now they try to make them deliberately
rare and they have like pieces of game

454
00:27:29,561 --> 00:27:31,510
worn jerseys.
It's just not what it used to be.

455
00:27:31,511 --> 00:27:36,490
I just wish tops would put out a set
of 390 like they used to back in the

456
00:27:36,491 --> 00:27:40,090
fucking day and someone like
me could ride his bicycle down.

457
00:27:40,091 --> 00:27:43,840
Old freckled face bill. You know, any
you're awful gum that was in there,

458
00:27:43,841 --> 00:27:46,180
that fucked up one football
card in every pack.

459
00:27:46,181 --> 00:27:49,090
Why can't I go back to doing that?
So I'd know back then,

460
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,380
I swear to God I could have announced the
fucking game. I knew everybody's name.

461
00:27:53,381 --> 00:27:56,830
I knew the offensive linemen, defensive
linemen, I knew fucking everybody.

462
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:01,300
Now the only way to do that is you got
to play fantasy football with a bunch of

463
00:28:01,301 --> 00:28:02,680
fucking jerk offs.

464
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:08,290
You got to go to somebodies living room
and have a fucking draft as you sit

465
00:28:08,291 --> 00:28:12,160
there with adults acting like, just
see, oh is of a fucking league.

466
00:28:12,161 --> 00:28:16,420
That doesn't even exist. It's one of the
saddest, most pathetic fucking thanks.

467
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:21,560
Anyway, so let's talk about the game.
Um, even though it's way over. Uh,

468
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:22,840
okay.

469
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,270
Um, obviously the excitement wasn't
there cause I already knew the,

470
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,410
I knew the end result,

471
00:28:26,411 --> 00:28:30,820
but I was anticipating how I
would feel throughout the game.

472
00:28:30,821 --> 00:28:35,620
I would say that when Brady threw
the pic, uh, in the beginning,

473
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,920
um,
I guess with the broken wrist,

474
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:43,880
I guess that that would have made me
feel like they kind of offset. But, uh,

475
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,750
I always get nervous when someone says a
turnover and I'm thinking, like I said,

476
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,670
it's going to be the first in many
definitely when we were down by 10,

477
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,290
I definitely would have been like,
it's over.

478
00:28:51,291 --> 00:28:55,130
We're not coming back from this shit.
And uh,

479
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:59,610
you know, that ridiculous catch. I
would've completely freaked out. But um,

480
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,730
I'll tell you, everybody's given
Pete Carroll Shit. You know,

481
00:29:02,731 --> 00:29:06,180
they had a great stat that I saw.
I'm usually not a big stack guy,

482
00:29:06,181 --> 00:29:09,990
but that play that Pete Carroll called
that was run a little over a hundred

483
00:29:09,991 --> 00:29:11,460
times during the regular season.

484
00:29:11,461 --> 00:29:16,461
It resulted in like 65 touchdowns
or low sixties touchdowns,

485
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:22,730
like 40 incomplete completions and like
no interceptions or something like that.

486
00:29:24,191 --> 00:29:28,800
It was like 64. No, like 65,

487
00:29:28,801 --> 00:29:30,690
66, something like that.
Touchdown. Right. And

488
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:32,620
45 was a little over a hundred times.
They tried it,

489
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:35,260
but there was never an
interception until that place.

490
00:29:35,261 --> 00:29:39,580
So it's just one of those fucking
things. And God, if anybody knows,

491
00:29:39,581 --> 00:29:41,080
it's just one of those fucking things.

492
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:44,420
It's a patriots fan with
like the helmet catch,

493
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:49,760
you know that fucking ridiculous pass at
Eli through after Brady to Welker shit

494
00:29:49,761 --> 00:29:53,880
the bed. Um, but you know,
it was fucking hilarious.

495
00:29:53,881 --> 00:29:57,270
Was seeing Tom Brady space after that
ridiculous catch that that guy in the

496
00:29:57,271 --> 00:30:01,320
Seahawks mate, he's just, he just
had this look on his face like,

497
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:05,550
like really like how many times
do I have to win the Superbowl?

498
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:06,920
Okay.

499
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,420
Before I,
I actually,

500
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:11,750
and the defense will just fucking
get a goddamn three and out.

501
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:15,440
It led me ice to fucking game.
How many fucking times?

502
00:30:15,441 --> 00:30:19,250
So I got to drive down the fucking
field for the, go ahead. Touchdown.

503
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:25,110
I did it in both fucking giants games
and you guys are out there letting people

504
00:30:25,111 --> 00:30:30,030
catch it between that taint in their
fucking ankle for the love of fucking God.

505
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,780
You know that whoever that Patriot
was that jumped up and over,

506
00:30:33,781 --> 00:30:35,370
that's the result of those fucking don't,

507
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:38,970
don't hit a defenseless
receiver cause back in the day,

508
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:42,960
even though Malcolm Butler
tip that ball up debt,

509
00:30:42,961 --> 00:30:44,910
other that's safety coming over the top,

510
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:48,690
he would have gone right into that
guy's jaw. Even a hurdle in like, oh,

511
00:30:48,691 --> 00:30:52,680
don't step on the receiver and wouldn't
knock the ball out. So thank God.

512
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:57,540
And uh, I loved seeing a drunk, um,

513
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:02,780
Robert Kraft and I loved that he demanded
an apology and that fucking gym or say

514
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,320
what a bunch of Horse Shit.

515
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:06,960
Did you guys see that thing
ESPN did where they had the, uh,

516
00:31:06,961 --> 00:31:11,160
the science guy actually investigated
the advantages or disadvantages of a

517
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:13,200
deflated ball and they
actually found out that it was,

518
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:16,330
it was actually a disadvantage.
Um,

519
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:18,070
yeah,

520
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:21,490
but there's an article that came out
that I retweeted that grant it was from,

521
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:26,640
it was from like CBS Sports Boston
that really debunked a lot of the shit.

522
00:31:27,221 --> 00:31:31,370
Of course you guys won't
believe it, but, um, you know,

523
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:34,520
I dunno what I hope that they
pursue that they should pursue that.

524
00:31:34,521 --> 00:31:37,640
The way the colts complained
throughout the years.

525
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:42,110
Just keep complaining right
through the fucking draft.

526
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:47,570
All I know is the fucking bill Belicheck
sat on the rules committee and change

527
00:31:47,571 --> 00:31:50,540
rules to make the game
easier for his offense.

528
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:54,740
I mean he would have to go on in
front of the Senate defending himself.

529
00:31:54,741 --> 00:31:59,540
Jim Mercy does it. Nobody gives
a fuck. Um, so that's my message.

530
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:04,010
Fuck Jim, our sec. What are you
going to cry about this year, Jimmy?

531
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:07,640
Um, anyways, what else?

532
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:10,060
I'm trying to look at
my list of Shit here.

533
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:14,110
Anything else that I wanted to talk about?
Uh,

534
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:18,970
Oh and I lost my list. Well, I
guess that, well, there goes that,

535
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:23,860
um, anyways, I'm in Not New York City for
the, uh, the Patrice O'Neal events, um,

536
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:28,810
benefit I should say. Uh, the third
annual time is flying by and uh,

537
00:32:28,811 --> 00:32:33,370
this is such a wonderful event. So most
positive thing I do every year. And, um,

538
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:38,380
we've got a hell of a lineup this year
as always. A, we got some new faces,

539
00:32:38,381 --> 00:32:41,070
we've got some new, uh,
this is the first year.

540
00:32:41,071 --> 00:32:45,180
We actually fact we've got a couple
guys on that were, uh, you know,

541
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:48,540
I think got to see Patrice
before they were even comics,

542
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:50,970
I'm guessing by their age.
Michael Che in Hannibal Burress.

543
00:32:50,971 --> 00:32:53,010
So that's pretty cool to
have that sort of element.

544
00:32:53,011 --> 00:32:56,850
Like watching people who were influenced
by Patrice has comedy before they

545
00:32:56,851 --> 00:33:01,110
started, or at least very
early on in their career,
they were able to see him. Um,

546
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,420
so I'm really looking forward to that.
And once again,

547
00:33:03,421 --> 00:33:06,370
it's just such a great benefit and a,

548
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:09,000
all you guys who've gone out throughout
the years in a bought tickets,

549
00:33:09,001 --> 00:33:13,530
it's really, you know, had such a positive

550
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:17,030
effect on,
uh,

551
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:20,370
the people that Patrice
loved because you know,

552
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:25,150
unlike a lot of fucking charities where
there's an infrastructure and there's

553
00:33:25,151 --> 00:33:28,270
people getting paid, nobody
gets paid. Like I said,

554
00:33:28,271 --> 00:33:31,900
the only money we have to spend is the
money that to rent out the venue and then

555
00:33:31,901 --> 00:33:36,310
the rest of it goes to his level. And
so it's really just like direct, like,

556
00:33:36,311 --> 00:33:39,640
you know, when you want to help
wounded warriors and veterans,

557
00:33:39,641 --> 00:33:41,200
like you just wish you could just be like,

558
00:33:41,201 --> 00:33:45,760
give me the name of the person and where
they live and can I just fucking write

559
00:33:45,761 --> 00:33:49,730
a check to this person directly?
Um,

560
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:53,410
then of course then they would just
put it in the bank and then it would be

561
00:33:53,411 --> 00:33:57,300
considered income and then they get taxed
on it. Right. Is that what it is? Uh,

562
00:33:57,350 --> 00:34:00,420
these fucking cuts. I don't
know how to do it. Uh,

563
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,860
but I think the way we're doing it
is about the best way you can do it.

564
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:05,380
By the way, did you see all
that shit on fucking no more

565
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:09,940
that they don't really do anything
other than just raise awareness.

566
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,550
It's the biggest fuck any,
I'm telling you right now.

567
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:16,360
I am done with any charity that says
they're there to raise awareness.

568
00:34:16,361 --> 00:34:20,680
Fuck no more. Fuck that. Uh, pink
shit in October. All of them.

569
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:24,020
It's a bunch of it.
They're the modern day slim,

570
00:34:24,021 --> 00:34:27,940
slam snake oil salesman.
They're all getting rich off of,

571
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:32,500
of of people dying of
diseases or get beaten up,

572
00:34:32,501 --> 00:34:34,120
spousal abuse,
all of that.

573
00:34:34,121 --> 00:34:39,121
They literally going out buying fancy
cars and nice houses because regular

574
00:34:39,191 --> 00:34:44,110
people feel like they're doing
something. I don't know. I don't know.

575
00:34:44,111 --> 00:34:45,850
Of course.
And I haven't investigated any of it.

576
00:34:45,851 --> 00:34:47,800
I think they're all full of Shit and uh,

577
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,610
I'm done with it now I'm done.
But I'm done with,

578
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:55,160
I think I'm pretty much done but
just about every one of other than a,

579
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:56,950
okay.

580
00:34:56,950 --> 00:34:58,630
What's that one that Danny Thomas started.

581
00:34:59,310 --> 00:34:59,710
Okay.

582
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:02,560
That one has just straight
up like a five star rating.

583
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:06,430
Is it Saint Jude's hospital?
That one.

584
00:35:06,431 --> 00:35:08,650
And then the thing I talked
about a few weeks ago,

585
00:35:08,651 --> 00:35:10,780
which I still haven't done
cause I've been overseas, we,

586
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:14,590
she'd see if you're a match for
the, uh, bone marrow transplant,

587
00:35:14,591 --> 00:35:16,150
we thinking literally
saved somebodies life.

588
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:20,470
Like those types of charities that are
transparent. There's just a handful of,

589
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:24,370
if you know. But isn't that, isn't
that the truth with everything?

590
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:27,520
I mean there's a lot of
people that play music,

591
00:35:27,521 --> 00:35:32,200
but how they are really good
charities are no different. Everybody.

592
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:34,240
All right, let's get on with, um,

593
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:35,950
okay.

594
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:37,960
How is this a bad thing?
Is it bad

595
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:44,890
to think someone's a bad mother
because they still wear leather pants?

596
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:46,780
It's probably a bad thing,
right?

597
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:50,380
I'm here in New York and I was sitting
down eating at yet another bad slice of

598
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:52,870
pizza in New York City.
You know,

599
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,380
New York City is just like Chicago
where it's known for its pizza.

600
00:35:56,381 --> 00:36:01,381
So there's so many fucking places that
are living off that reputation that like,

601
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:01,931
you know,

602
00:36:01,931 --> 00:36:04,960
you have to talk to somebody that lives
in Chicago and they'll tell you where to

603
00:36:04,961 --> 00:36:05,590
go.

604
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:10,590
And pretty much still there's like five
fucking places maybe in each city that

605
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:12,730
people will recommend it and
everything else is bullshit.

606
00:36:12,731 --> 00:36:16,300
So this place across the street of course
is bullshit. And I'm sitting there,

607
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:21,160
I meet my slice of pizza and they
got some sort of a Latino judge,

608
00:36:21,161 --> 00:36:24,820
Judy thing going on. And, uh,

609
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,880
which is just at a total different level
where on this show the defendants can

610
00:36:32,051 --> 00:36:34,030
actually put their hands on each other,

611
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:39,170
I guess once once a, uh, the
prosecution, once it, the family,

612
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:40,830
whatever I want to have
the fucking legal term.

613
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:44,370
It's the person bitching and the person
getting bitched at. They can actually,

614
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,380
like when this guy,

615
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:51,060
he actually ran up to this
woman and ripped her shirt
open and pulled out, like,

616
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:56,360
I don't know if he was bitching
that her bra was stuffed and uh,

617
00:36:56,970 --> 00:37:00,510
that's what he was suing her over
some sort of false advertising.

618
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:03,060
I have no idea the sound was down.
And even if it was up,

619
00:37:03,061 --> 00:37:07,230
it was in a different language and I was
the only one watching it other than the

620
00:37:07,231 --> 00:37:09,690
guy making pizza.
So when he ripped her shirt open,

621
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:14,190
I screamed out what this pizza place?

622
00:37:14,191 --> 00:37:16,530
And everyone's looking at me like,
what am I talking about?

623
00:37:16,531 --> 00:37:20,460
By the time they looked up,
they'd cut away. So I dunno.

624
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:21,760
Maybe they thought I was some sort of red,

625
00:37:21,761 --> 00:37:24,690
had a Latino guy and I could read
lips or some shit. I don't know. What,

626
00:37:24,691 --> 00:37:27,810
but anyway, so this woman walks in,
his lady walks in with the two kids.

627
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:31,290
She's got a leather pants and high
heels shoes and just right there.

628
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:34,010
I just immediately judge was like,
she's,

629
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:37,650
she's too fucking self
involved to be a good mom.

630
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:41,640
Then I was like though you too. Oh,
because of what? Her pants and her shoes.

631
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:43,360
Yeah.

632
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:46,240
Am I wrong for saying that ladies?
I would love to hear from you.

633
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:51,640
And is there the male equivalent to that?
Wouldn't that be like the guy,

634
00:37:51,641 --> 00:37:52,540
if you saw a guy,

635
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:57,370
he's a dad of two when he comes in and
he's got his hair highlighted in his

636
00:37:57,371 --> 00:38:00,490
fucking eyebrows shaped up,
you know,

637
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:04,990
looking like he's trying to do the a book,
a role for the Ricky Martin Story.

638
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:08,980
You know, maybe wearing
some Cologne, you know,

639
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,080
aren't the both of them
still kind of horn it up?

640
00:38:11,081 --> 00:38:13,420
Like are you still trying to find a mate?
Like what's going on here?

641
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,290
Probably everything.
I said, you know what,

642
00:38:17,291 --> 00:38:19,780
somebody's probably gonna take an extra
for that and then put it on there and

643
00:38:19,781 --> 00:38:22,650
then it'll be a little sexless rats,
although blood,

644
00:38:22,651 --> 00:38:27,640
they bullying ass fucking
morons. Um, anyways.

645
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:33,810
Yeah. There you go. I'm just
being honest, like I feel like a,

646
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:36,880
if I see a woman with kids,
she's wearing leather pants. Uh,

647
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:42,250
I'm going to say that, uh, I dunno,

648
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:44,980
somebody might fall in a swimming pool
and it's going to take you a minute to

649
00:38:44,981 --> 00:38:45,814
get there.

650
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:50,403
Okay.

651
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:55,860
Ah, Shit. Anyways, Hong Kong, h o n k,

652
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:00,420
Honk Kong, by the way, people who live
in Hong Kong are known as honkies.

653
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:03,360
How funny is that? Well, I
think it's funny. Hang on.

654
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:07,383
MMM,

655
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:11,720
yeah. Right. Hong Kong, Hong
Kong. Oh, by the way, India,

656
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:13,410
there's so many fucking people.
They're like you.

657
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:16,040
It takes you a minute to be able
to breathe that fucking air.

658
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:21,410
I definitely felt like I've done a
couple of times live in, in Los Angeles.

659
00:39:21,411 --> 00:39:25,630
I've gone on a hike, you know,
in my leather pants, you know,

660
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,380
but I don't have any children,
so it's okay.

661
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:33,160
My leather hiking shorts and if
I am jogging a little bit and,

662
00:39:34,281 --> 00:39:38,570
um, you know, breathing hard or
whatever, I felt a burning in my chest

663
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:42,920
on a, like really smoggy days. But, uh,

664
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:45,980
I was not jogging when I was in
India and there was definitely this,

665
00:39:45,981 --> 00:39:50,760
this like, you know, it takes a
second fee about it to get you so, oh,

666
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:52,850
it's going to be this level,
you know?

667
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,193
MMM.

668
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:59,060
Having said all of that and as much as
a pain in the ass as it was to get the

669
00:39:59,061 --> 00:40:01,520
fucking slip and all that,
I can't wait to go back.

670
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:03,203
Uh,

671
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:07,100
alright. Hong Kong bill, you
probably already talked about this,

672
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:11,900
but can you speak about the pollution
and the constant tickle in your throat

673
00:40:11,901 --> 00:40:15,170
caused by the air over there
if you haven't already? Oh,

674
00:40:15,171 --> 00:40:17,680
that's what somebody experienced that
in Hong Kong. I didn't feel that.

675
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:20,870
I felt that in India. I felt there
was that tickle in your throat?

676
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,633
MMM,

677
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:27,120
there was definitely,
it was definitely hazy,

678
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,250
but la gets hazy.

679
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:30,213
MMM.

680
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,410
But, uh, I would think
a lot of that was, yeah.

681
00:40:34,411 --> 00:40:36,000
There's just a zillion people over there.

682
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:37,603
MMM.

683
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:42,030
Yeah, I dunno. I don't want to start
saying a bunch of negative shit.

684
00:40:42,031 --> 00:40:45,030
It's already enough negative shit
about a lot of places over there.

685
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:48,780
They're fucking amazing cities to go
to. I highly recommend it. But yeah,

686
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:53,810
there's definitely a zillion people and
you see the effects on the environment,

687
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:58,410
which is why it's funny when people deny
global warming and that we're having

688
00:40:58,411 --> 00:41:01,740
any sort of an effect on the
environment or any of that type of shit.

689
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:04,810
And the little for years that was

690
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:10,530
the fucking earth is heated up and
cooled down. Jesus fucking Christ.

691
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,170
Um,
I am not a scientist,

692
00:41:13,171 --> 00:41:18,171
but they seem to be very alarmed at the
rate that it is heating up this time and

693
00:41:18,691 --> 00:41:23,670
this time of year, people always
point at snow storms and go ese.

694
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,460
It's snowing in February.
Uh,

695
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:31,110
this one scientist guy was saying that
both the summers and the winters are

696
00:41:31,111 --> 00:41:34,580
going to have, are going to
be really erratic. And uh,

697
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,400
all I can say about it is I hope that the,
the,

698
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:40,730
the people who say it
isn't true are right.

699
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:45,560
Because if we're having effect on it and
we're not fucking with the population

700
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:50,390
other than to keep adding
to it, uh Oh my God.

701
00:41:50,391 --> 00:41:54,230
I almost said the worst joke ever.
Forecast calls for a shitstorm. Oh,

702
00:41:54,231 --> 00:41:57,020
I'm such a Gemini,
sorry.

703
00:41:57,410 --> 00:42:02,410
Sorry to anybody who ever remotely even
liked or enjoyed comedy because I just

704
00:42:03,681 --> 00:42:05,780
ruined it, a part of it.
You know what I mean?

705
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:10,730
What I just did to comedy with that awful
joke was like during a war when a city

706
00:42:10,731 --> 00:42:14,060
gets bombed and uh,
you know,

707
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:18,470
a really old historic
building gets blown up.

708
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:22,100
That's what I just did really built.
I think he just told a bad joke.

709
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:26,330
I think comedy will be fine. You fucking
jerk off. All right. Foreign music. Billy,

710
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:29,660
have you developed a love for any
music you've heard while traveling?

711
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:33,690
Um,
I traveled so much,

712
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:38,000
I didn't have a chance to take
in to too much of anything. Um,

713
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:42,090
I will tell you that, uh, when I was in

714
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:47,100
Singapore,
I think it was in Singapore,

715
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:52,620
I walked into that hotel that has
the infinity pool at the top at your,

716
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:55,650
you're not allowed to go into,
I discovered unless you were a guests,

717
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:59,280
I just wanted to walk out and go
see it. And they were like, ah, no,

718
00:42:59,281 --> 00:43:01,800
I'm sorry I can't do that. And
then the lady was like, well,

719
00:43:01,801 --> 00:43:06,510
he's doing a show here in
town. And they're like, yeah,
well have fun at the show.

720
00:43:06,511 --> 00:43:08,510
You still can't look at the pool.
Um,

721
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:13,440
when I was in the lobby of that hotel,
there was a,

722
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,050
it was these women playing.

723
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:17,913
MMM.

724
00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:22,170
I don't know if these instruments from
Asia basically, as far as I can tell you,

725
00:43:22,171 --> 00:43:24,690
you know that one that has to strings,
but you hit it with little hammers.

726
00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:29,250
They haven't. And every karate
movies that I've ever watched, um,

727
00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:30,540
not during a fight scene.

728
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:35,580
It's usually when the person comes
to the hero comes to town and,

729
00:43:35,581 --> 00:43:36,270
uh,

730
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:39,780
the hot girl in the village
that the Douche bag that
the heroes is going to have

731
00:43:39,781 --> 00:43:43,260
to fight. Notice, notice this is
the hair off when it comes to town.

732
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:48,000
And then that guy immediately hates the
hero and then they have to fight over

733
00:43:48,001 --> 00:43:51,750
her vagina basically. Um, you know,

734
00:43:51,751 --> 00:43:54,210
that instrument that's played in
the background. I liked that one.

735
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:59,190
And I liked the music. I like the moods
that that creates. Uh, by the way,

736
00:43:59,191 --> 00:44:02,340
I'll tell you right now, Chinese
girls, a fucking hot man. Good Lord.

737
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,730
Beautiful fucking stunning.
Um,

738
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:08,550
same thing with the women is Singapore.

739
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:14,130
They all got some cutie pies. You
know, every God damn country I went to,

740
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:17,670
every country has cutie pies.
I'll tell you that.

741
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,250
Say That right now and
have as far as music,

742
00:44:20,251 --> 00:44:24,780
I didn't fuck listen anything other
than I heard that shit in the lobby. Um,

743
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:29,570
that was a, you know, it's funny with the
hotel we were staying at and, and, and uh,

744
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:32,220
Hong Kong, they, uh,

745
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:36,540
they had all these beautiful
fucking women working there.

746
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:40,980
All these Chinese women, right? And
they all had names like Susan and Ethel,

747
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:42,563
meg.

748
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:48,240
And then you'd walk out and go to a store
across the street and everybody would

749
00:44:48,241 --> 00:44:53,070
have like Chinese names. And it's just
like Jesus Christ. What are you doing it?

750
00:44:53,071 --> 00:44:54,660
I know your name is Helen.

751
00:44:57,010 --> 00:44:57,500
Okay.

752
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:59,930
Fuck, I forgot to do that joke
when I was in, you know what?

753
00:44:59,931 --> 00:45:04,360
I wanted to open with an India. I was
just so fucking tired. I forgot I was,

754
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:07,490
I wanted to open with like,
you know what? You know what?

755
00:45:07,491 --> 00:45:11,810
I was nice to be here in India and I
know I've already probably talked to most

756
00:45:11,811 --> 00:45:15,880
of you on the phone.
And by the way, we all,

757
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:19,910
everybody in America knows your name
is Scott. You don't need to do that.

758
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:24,340
Is there anything else I can help
you with? What is your name? Scott.

759
00:45:27,870 --> 00:45:28,240
Okay.

760
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,340
No it isn't.
My name is Dakota.

761
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,920
That's going to be funny when the
updated to those fucking awful

762
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:34,270
celebrity names.

763
00:45:35,770 --> 00:45:40,120
People name their kids now the
fuck do they name him? Your name?

764
00:45:40,121 --> 00:45:43,660
Your kid like carburetor or
some dumb shit like that? Uh,

765
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:46,570
you help my wife give
birth the fuck out of here.

766
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,950
Um, well she heard that joke I did a few
minutes ago. She'd have a miscarriage. Uh,

767
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:56,920
you helped me with my wife.
Give birth. Dear Billy boy,

768
00:45:57,970 --> 00:46:02,260
I am writing to you from my lovely wife's
hospital room and she gave birth to

769
00:46:02,261 --> 00:46:06,910
our beautiful and thankfully not
redheaded little lady. Oh fuck you.

770
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:12,190
Uh, my wife was a complete
ship going through 29,

771
00:46:12,310 --> 00:46:15,820
long hours of labor.
Holy Shit.

772
00:46:16,070 --> 00:46:19,570
The what did they get bitch longer than
we can if they're fucking bill to take

773
00:46:19,571 --> 00:46:20,770
29 hours of labor,

774
00:46:20,771 --> 00:46:23,080
you think you're going to beat them in
a fight about whether you can watch the

775
00:46:23,081 --> 00:46:27,100
game or not. Fucking it's over
before it starts. One round loss.

776
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:32,110
Um, and now I have a huge respect for
mothers everywhere after seeing what an

777
00:46:32,111 --> 00:46:36,430
intense process that is firsthand.
Anyways, that's hilarious.

778
00:46:36,431 --> 00:46:39,250
It took 29 hours of labor.
At what point did your,

779
00:46:39,251 --> 00:46:43,500
your opinion start to change our 17.
Do you know? I ain't got to say Seo.

780
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:48,670
These mothers, they got
something. Um, that's funny.

781
00:46:48,671 --> 00:46:51,160
Then I'm judging that lady
wearing the fucking leather pants.

782
00:46:51,161 --> 00:46:53,080
She probably went through
29 hours to write,

783
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:57,130
at least between the two kids and the
fact that she can still fit into leather

784
00:46:57,131 --> 00:47:01,330
pants, you know, I dunno.
Maybe that's my insecurity,

785
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:05,050
but I think she's still
trolling for cock. Uh, anyways,

786
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:11,870
let's take that out of context.
Let's just shove that somewhere.

787
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,590
Put that on the news.
Anyways,

788
00:47:13,591 --> 00:47:17,250
my reason for writing is
while she was in labor,

789
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:22,260
I tried to play some music to help
distract her from the, from the uh,

790
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:26,340
contractions. After about three songs
and a few contractions, she said to me,

791
00:47:26,341 --> 00:47:29,990
and I quote, this music isn't
helping. I need something

792
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:33,560
else. Put on bill burrs,
podcasts, bullshit.

793
00:47:36,330 --> 00:47:38,460
Jesus Christ was,
that's probably why she pushed it out.

794
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:42,060
She wanted US fucking stop
hearing my dumb voice.

795
00:47:42,061 --> 00:47:46,380
Obviously I obliged a woman giving birth
to my child and we sat there listening

796
00:47:46,381 --> 00:47:49,290
to old freckles distractive
from the pains of labor.

797
00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:53,610
I am sure that nurses were a bit confused
when they heard a litany of shits,

798
00:47:53,611 --> 00:47:57,990
fucks and cons coming from the phone.
But we didn't care because it was helping.

799
00:47:58,350 --> 00:48:01,800
Thanks for all you do and for helping
distract my wife for awhile from her

800
00:48:01,801 --> 00:48:06,360
uterus trying to push a little little
wrecking ball through the birth canal.

801
00:48:06,361 --> 00:48:08,160
Thanks. And Go fuck
yourself. Well there you go.

802
00:48:08,161 --> 00:48:13,161
See that like podcasts can be
used for things that are good.

803
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:17,670
Right? Isn't that lovely? All right,

804
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:22,710
go on to the next one. A
coworker, dear William,

805
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:26,130
there's a woman,
or as I like to say,

806
00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:30,120
fuck and lady at my,

807
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:33,330
at my workplace who I am in love with a,

808
00:48:33,331 --> 00:48:37,720
there was a project and I was handpicked.
Oh fuck. I just forgot. You know, this is,

809
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:37,980
you know,

810
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:42,980
something that I love about traveling
is the random shit that you see.

811
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:45,780
Somebody bought me a cigar.

812
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:47,740
Yeah.

813
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:50,440
Um, when I was in New Zealand,
thank you, by the way.

814
00:48:50,441 --> 00:48:54,170
And they had a cutter and matches
and all that shit. Not Everybody.

815
00:48:54,171 --> 00:48:56,740
You heard that? And I said,
thank you. Please don't do that.

816
00:48:57,310 --> 00:49:01,790
Nobody else do that because I'm really
trying to cut down my habit. Um,

817
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:06,940
but I appreciate the gesture. So
anyways, he gets me that. And by the way,

818
00:49:06,941 --> 00:49:08,590
if you're gonna pick out a fucking cigar,

819
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:12,640
you got to pinch the ENT where you put
your mouth and it's supposed to be spongy,

820
00:49:12,641 --> 00:49:14,330
supposed to go in,
and they want to come,

821
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:17,530
supposed to immediately come back and
then it's going to have a nice draw.

822
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:22,390
The rest of the cigar, it doesn't
fucking matter. All right. And, uh,

823
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:25,720
cause if it's hard where
you put your mouth, um,

824
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:30,960
it's like you ever have like a straw
and a milkshake that's too thick and you

825
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:34,150
can't even fucking enjoy it. Uh,
that's what ends up happening.

826
00:49:34,690 --> 00:49:35,530
But having said that,

827
00:49:35,531 --> 00:49:38,590
that's another reason why I don't want
to fucking cigar from someone in the

828
00:49:38,591 --> 00:49:40,750
crowd because if you actually pinching it,

829
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:44,590
I don't know where your fingers are bent
and is, it just gets gross. So anyways,

830
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:49,270
but I'm smoking the cigar anyways and uh,
I'm in Auckland,

831
00:49:49,271 --> 00:49:50,170
New Zealand,
right?

832
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:51,560
Yeah.

833
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:52,500
Had a great show,

834
00:49:53,730 --> 00:49:57,750
played this unbelievable theater and they
had this Oregon there that it was one

835
00:49:57,751 --> 00:50:02,550
of the top five or six organs
in the world. Um, and you know,

836
00:50:02,551 --> 00:50:04,470
you see an Oregon with those giant pipes,

837
00:50:04,471 --> 00:50:07,740
you just think they're playing and
that's the pipes that you seeing is,

838
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:11,940
is you know, with, and be all that
music's coming from. It isn't,

839
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:16,800
it's actually those pipes are uh,
just for shelf for the most part.

840
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,950
And you go in the back. We, she
took, this lady took me in the back,

841
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:25,100
there was three floors of inner workings
to this Oregon and are telling you

842
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:31,190
like giant rooms of things that you know,

843
00:50:31,191 --> 00:50:35,870
opened and contracted like
a goddamn accordion and then
all these different size

844
00:50:35,871 --> 00:50:39,890
pipes all the way down to these little
things you could smoke crack out of that

845
00:50:39,891 --> 00:50:42,870
all were part of that sound and I guess
these old guys would come in. Yeah.

846
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:47,600
Every, uh, like monks
to retune it, you know,

847
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:50,540
I don't even know if it needs to
be tuned that many times, but uh,

848
00:50:50,570 --> 00:50:53,510
I guess they love the fucking
Oregon so much. They used to joke,

849
00:50:53,511 --> 00:50:56,560
it was like their train
set. But um, anyway,

850
00:50:56,561 --> 00:51:00,260
so it's just as far as like random shit
that you see some smoking this cigar

851
00:51:01,870 --> 00:51:05,320
and it's like one in the morning,
I mean fucking New Zealand,

852
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:09,880
other side of the world all the way down
there. Fucking Antartica it feels like.

853
00:51:09,970 --> 00:51:12,910
And all of a sudden somebody walks by,
I swear to God,

854
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:16,180
it's like a Mitchell and
ness art monk Jersey,

855
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:20,890
a Washington Redskins Jersey. I'm looking
at is that a fucking Redskins Jersey?

856
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:25,090
I mean Auckland, New Zealand and then
look at the back and it's, it's art monk.

857
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:28,240
Not only is it a choice,
a fucking great joke.

858
00:51:28,241 --> 00:51:32,680
Who the fuck has an art monk Jersey? Great
Choice. What are the health? Has that,

859
00:51:32,681 --> 00:51:33,610
that's one of my,
uh,

860
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:38,260
I hated him when he played because I
was a big time cowboys fan back then

861
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:40,370
before,
uh,

862
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:44,560
ill Jimmy's face facelift
came in there and uh,

863
00:51:44,650 --> 00:51:47,110
Jerry Jerry facelifts came in.

864
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:48,550
Okay.

865
00:51:48,550 --> 00:51:50,470
Jerry Jones and Jimmy Johnson.
I was,

866
00:51:50,471 --> 00:51:54,630
I've never been able to keep those
two straight. Uh, so anyways, I liked,

867
00:51:54,631 --> 00:51:55,810
that's the type of shit I like.

868
00:51:56,290 --> 00:51:59,480
It's just the randomness of that
I saw and there's a bunch of,

869
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:04,570
of bootleg Yankee Shit because wearing
like a Yankees hat or anything New York

870
00:52:06,221 --> 00:52:10,360
is just like, you know, it's like the
fucking chicken. Where's the parish shirt?

871
00:52:10,361 --> 00:52:13,180
That's never been there for a
little Eiffel tower someday day.

872
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:15,430
But they're not like Yankee fans.
Actually,

873
00:52:15,431 --> 00:52:16,990
I heard a funny story of some mets fan,

874
00:52:16,991 --> 00:52:20,570
I guess fucking living overseas and
couldn't stand that because none of them

875
00:52:20,590 --> 00:52:23,470
because he wanted to like shit on the
Yankees as a mets fan. Like, I don't know,

876
00:52:23,830 --> 00:52:25,600
it doesn't really have a leg to stand on.
But uh,

877
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:29,980
he find out that they were just
wearing them to wear them. And uh, oh,

878
00:52:29,981 --> 00:52:33,700
the other thing too is when you go into
a country that doesn't really speak

879
00:52:33,701 --> 00:52:37,060
English, I've told you this shit
and I saw this in France where like,

880
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:43,120
like the shit that they have an English
never makes any sense or it doesn't,

881
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:45,400
you know, it doesn't mean
what they thought it meant.

882
00:52:46,150 --> 00:52:49,270
Like when I was in Hong Kong,
I was reading their tee shirts,

883
00:52:49,271 --> 00:52:52,320
the way they read our tattoos,
you know,

884
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:55,930
we get the Chinese characters where you
think like this means like brotherhood.

885
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:59,560
This means serenity and it really
just means like a, you know,

886
00:52:59,561 --> 00:53:02,590
take a left on fuckhead street or
whatever the hell it means. Um,

887
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:05,080
somebody had a,

888
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:06,660
yeah.

889
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:08,870
Oh Christ. I knew I should have
written down. I can't remember.

890
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:11,100
Okay.

891
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:13,050
Somebody actually had a football jersey,

892
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:18,080
but the numbers 69 on it and where
the name when it's said all night,

893
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:23,760
all night 69.
There you go.

894
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:30,080
This guys wants to get some and give some
all at the same time. Good for him. Uh,

895
00:53:30,110 --> 00:53:35,090
anyways, coworker dare bill.
There's a lady at my workplace
who I am in love with.

896
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:39,770
There was a project and I was handpicked
to help out in her department.

897
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:44,060
Not sure why, but there were plenty of
other people who could have done it. Well,

898
00:53:44,061 --> 00:53:47,570
maybe it was fate, maybe it was
cupid, maybe it was, I dunno what,

899
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:52,370
something bringing it together. Anyways,
this person says, because of this,

900
00:53:52,371 --> 00:53:56,450
we have worked together on numerous
occasions when I'm doing something on the

901
00:53:56,451 --> 00:53:58,970
computer and she's sitting
beside me helping out,

902
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:04,130
I can't help but notice she's
looking directly at me. Jesus, Buddy.

903
00:54:04,131 --> 00:54:05,870
How many more fucking
signs do you need here?

904
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:09,860
Sometimes she will be one
aisle over bent over a desk.

905
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:11,730
Okay.

906
00:54:11,730 --> 00:54:16,230
Talking to someone and adjusting her
tight jeans where she knows I can see it.

907
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:20,930
Okay, this took a left turn. I ain't seen
relationship here, buddy. I'm seeing,

908
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:21,933
uh,

909
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:26,850
seeing a fun time for about six weeks
and then I'm seeing you losing your job.

910
00:54:26,910 --> 00:54:28,890
That's what I'm saying now. All
right, let's keep reading here.

911
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:33,050
We work in a large building and she has
all the way on the other side, so weak.

912
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:37,770
So we correspond by text messaging.
All that's always good. Good move,

913
00:54:38,490 --> 00:54:43,410
good move. Get it in writing, write
something lewd to her. Uh, believe me,

914
00:54:43,411 --> 00:54:45,780
she'll keep every one of
these and when it goes south,

915
00:54:45,781 --> 00:54:49,820
she'll fucking show it to your boss
who probably also wants to banger. Um,

916
00:54:49,830 --> 00:54:51,780
we work in a large building way my way.

917
00:54:52,590 --> 00:54:57,030
Oftentimes when I text her
about work or have questions,

918
00:54:57,031 --> 00:55:01,410
she doesn't respond.
I'm guessing if she was into me,

919
00:55:01,411 --> 00:55:04,620
she would reply back immediately,
but touch, sometimes I get nothing.

920
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:08,430
Or is she playing hard to get?
I really want to make a move,

921
00:55:08,431 --> 00:55:11,400
but there is a fear of hostile
work environment or worse,

922
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:15,540
I get fired for sexual harassment if she
doesn't have the same feelings towards

923
00:55:15,541 --> 00:55:20,490
me, it's killing me not knowing what to
do because all I do is think about our

924
00:55:20,491 --> 00:55:25,130
thanks and go fuck yourself. Ps, I'm
married and have kids and so does she. Oh,

925
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:29,630
fuck you. And that was a big waste
of time. Ah, Jesus Christ. All right,

926
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:32,050
I think that's a podcast for this
week, right? That's not, that's that.

927
00:55:32,051 --> 00:55:35,140
That was a pretty decent effort. Once
you say decent effort all the way around,

928
00:55:35,390 --> 00:55:37,720
uh, that's the podcast.
I want to thank everybody

929
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:44,720
who came out to my shows as
I toured the south of Asia.

930
00:55:45,130 --> 00:55:48,860
I still can't believe I got to do that.
It was fucked up.

931
00:55:48,861 --> 00:55:51,770
I was in two countries that had one
of the wonders of the world and I saw

932
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:52,550
neither one of them.

933
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:55,670
I didn't go to the Great Wall
and I didn't go to the Taj Mahal.

934
00:55:56,570 --> 00:55:57,890
Uh,

935
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:00,013
so

936
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:04,290
yeah. What are you going to
fucking do it? I tried. You know,

937
00:56:04,410 --> 00:56:07,380
I did my think. Um, anyway,

938
00:56:07,381 --> 00:56:12,381
so I am in New York City right now and
I'm doing the Patrice Patrice O'Neal

939
00:56:12,541 --> 00:56:17,460
benefit tomorrow night. And uh, I
dunno, I'm on different time zone.

940
00:56:17,461 --> 00:56:19,800
I might go out to the clubs
tonight. Who knows? Who knows?

941
00:56:20,130 --> 00:56:22,170
That's the Monday morning podcast.
Go fuck yourselves.

942
00:56:22,171 --> 00:56:26,430
Thanks to listening and I will talk to
each and every one of you next week.

943
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:30,210
All right. Thank you for your patience.
I know it's coming out later. See Ya.
