1
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:02,010
Okay.

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:03,120
Hey,
what's going on?

3
00:00:03,121 --> 00:00:06,330
It's built burr and it's the
Monday morning podcast from Monday,

4
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:11,250
August 13th, 2012. How the hell are you?

5
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,730
How's it going? August
13th. Can you believe it?

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,220
Only three more weeks of this summer.
Right?

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,240
But thanks to global warming,

8
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:26,040
you can still get a Tan right through
the second week of October. You know,

9
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:30,990
enjoy it. Folks. This is the golden
age of global warming. You know,

10
00:00:30,991 --> 00:00:35,880
this is before polar bear swims up
to your fucking apartment, you know?

11
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:37,860
Okay.

12
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,850
All those fires in the middle
of the country, who cares?

13
00:00:41,851 --> 00:00:45,180
Those are flyover states, right?
That's just our food supply.

14
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:51,270
Um, I've always thought it was funny
the way people make fun of those states,

15
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:53,730
you know,
because they don't have what?

16
00:00:53,731 --> 00:00:58,320
A water slide and a giant
fucking skyscraper. All of
a sudden they don't count.

17
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,500
Yeah. All they're doing
is fucking, you know,

18
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,060
providing nourishment for
everyone in the state. I'm sorry,

19
00:01:06,061 --> 00:01:07,050
everyone in the nation,

20
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:12,940
all they're doing is growing enough
food to feed the world, but we don't.

21
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:16,090
Right.
And I think that's a good thing.

22
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:18,610
I think a good thing that
we don't feed the world.

23
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:19,990
Okay?

24
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:23,410
There's too many fucking people, and
that's why the polar ice caps are melting.

25
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:28,120
It has nothing to do with v eight engines.
Okay? There's too many goddamn people.

26
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:33,750
So when I'm going to do eventually in
25 years when I get famous enough is I'm

27
00:01:35,171 --> 00:01:40,171
going to put together my own collection
of musicians and we're going to do,

28
00:01:41,471 --> 00:01:43,840
we aren't the world.
All right?

29
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,633
Yeah,

30
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,120
we are the world.

31
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,780
You're not a responsibility.

32
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:59,970
I'm sorry you don't have an apple tree,
so go fuck yourself.

33
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:05,870
There's too many people taking shits every
day and it's fucking up the world for

34
00:02:08,451 --> 00:02:12,840
me and you all right?
We got more shit.

35
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,530
That's how it worked out. All
right. You get the idea. You know,

36
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:22,670
I wonder who that would actually return
that fucking phone call no fucking

37
00:02:23,431 --> 00:02:27,480
maniac from was in that movie heat. I bet
he would. The guy was doing porns now.

38
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:32,160
Oh God. I mean that guy. Just once,

39
00:02:32,161 --> 00:02:36,990
I want to have an orgasm like that and
be fucking gone. Oh, Jesus. Like he was

40
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:43,020
like, somebody kicked you
in the nuts. Um, anyways,

41
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:44,310
you wouldn't believe this right now.

42
00:02:44,311 --> 00:02:49,230
The way this is going in where I'm
saying don't save the world. Okay,

43
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:54,040
let them go. That's how I would
run for office. Excuse me. Um,

44
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,890
non senator prayer.

45
00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:00,950
I was wondering what you thought
about the problem in Croatia.

46
00:03:01,331 --> 00:03:06,070
Rwanda damned. Uh, yeah. I don't
really know. I don't give a shit.

47
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:10,210
I mean, I think it's
terrible, but uh, you know,

48
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:14,350
you know, the more people
die, the more fresh air for
us. That's how we look at it.

49
00:03:14,351 --> 00:03:18,130
You know, as long as it isn't anybody,
uh, with, with our flag on their shoulder,

50
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:22,420
I think that that would be okay.
That's appalling.

51
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,810
That's a realistic outlook lady.
Okay.

52
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:29,050
You want to be on the ship
that's sailing towards surviving.

53
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,450
I suggest you change your attitude.
Next question.

54
00:03:31,451 --> 00:03:33,370
You over there with the striped tie?
No.

55
00:03:33,371 --> 00:03:37,360
The other guy with the striped tie
and the receding hair. Yes. Yo,

56
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:43,780
I'm not answering that. Go Fuck Yourself.
It's a figure of speech. Jesus Christ.

57
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,470
Um,
I actually have a giant announcement.

58
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:52,390
Giant. A big for me. Okay.

59
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:54,570
Yeah,

60
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:59,340
I have a big announcement for
me. All right. I'm pregnant. Um,

61
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:04,170
I just found out and I'm really
excited for myself. No, I, I um,

62
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:09,390
I had been telling you guys
that I recorded a standup
special and the wonderful

63
00:04:09,391 --> 00:04:14,391
district of Columbia back in March and
ever since then you guys have been asking

64
00:04:15,091 --> 00:04:18,570
me, hey pill, when is that
special coming out? Well,

65
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:23,100
on this week's podcast I will be
announcing when my special comes out,

66
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,110
but not right now for some stupid reason.
I'm going to wait until the end.

67
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:33,260
Just like one of those dumb
shows on TV, you know, we're,

68
00:04:33,261 --> 00:04:35,190
all you need is one piece
of fucking information.

69
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:39,900
They just try to drag it out so they can
get in eight minutes of advertising and

70
00:04:39,901 --> 00:04:43,650
so we can have a yacht right now.
I'm fucking with you.

71
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,330
I'm going to do it right out of the gate.

72
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:49,080
That's how I do it cause
I'm not playing the gay man.

73
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,120
Um, okay. My new special isn't titled You.

74
00:04:54,121 --> 00:04:59,121
People are all the same and it will
premiere exclusively on Netflix.

75
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,890
It's the only place you're going to be
able to see it is Netflix. Why do you ask?

76
00:05:04,891 --> 00:05:08,640
Because I love those guys.
They show my entire special,

77
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,680
it's unedited itch.

78
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:15,710
It captures the exact level of ignorance
that I wanted to put out there.

79
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:20,400
I love those guys. So it's going to be
premiering exclusively on next flicks. Um,

80
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,570
this Thursday,

81
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:26,850
August 16th at 6:00 AM Pacific Time.

82
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:32,180
So for all you grumpy people out there,
that's 9:00 AM Pacific time. All right.

83
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:37,080
It will be available to all Netflix
members in the United States, Canada,

84
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:40,890
Ireland and the United Kingdom.

85
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,430
Well,
isn't Ireland part of the UK?

86
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:46,870
Okay.

87
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:50,140
Hey Nia, isn't Ireland part of the UK
or at least Northern Ireland is right.

88
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:54,070
I just lost everyone in fucking
it didn't and he is making a face.

89
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,660
We went over there,
we learned this,

90
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,710
we went on the double decker bus tour
and they told us what the lady and the

91
00:06:00,711 --> 00:06:05,711
king owned right number
that the United Kingdom,

92
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:09,680
as far as my understanding
is, is England, Wales,

93
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,720
Scotland and a in Northern Ireland.
I don't know.

94
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,760
That's what it is.
It's Northern Ireland.

95
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:21,440
My apologies to everybody keeping it real
and southern Ireland as opposed to all

96
00:06:21,441 --> 00:06:25,160
those sellouts in Northern Ireland who
are just fine with that bigger douche

97
00:06:25,161 --> 00:06:27,650
telling you what to do.
Is that what you're telling me?

98
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,490
How many beer glasses am I going
to get thrown at my fucking head?

99
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:34,520
If I ever go back,
if I go up to Belfast anyways,

100
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,290
I'm just fucking with you guys over
there. All right, hang on a second.

101
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:40,124
What'd you say

102
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,210
Eastern and,
and I'm talking about the United States.

103
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:48,813
Okay.

104
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,950
Oh 9:00 AM eastern. Oh, did
I say for Pacific twice?
I'm sorry. Well, either way.

105
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:56,740
I was just talking about the United
States with those times. You know, why?

106
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,630
Cause we are the world.

107
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:05,080
So I'm really excited that it's also
going to be in Canada, Ireland and the UK.

108
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:10,000
Um, because uh, I go to those places
and when I go to those places,

109
00:07:10,001 --> 00:07:13,820
only three people show up. So, uh,
maybe this will be able to, uh,

110
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:17,610
as the dollar collapses,
I'll be able to, uh,

111
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:22,060
go to places where there's other currency
and I'll get to start this journey all

112
00:07:22,061 --> 00:07:25,990
over again. Nia. Remember when you
met me and I was still on a futon.

113
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:30,850
That's actually true. It is true. Okay,

114
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:33,370
so my new special you
people are all the same.

115
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,970
It's going to premier exclusively on
Netflix this Thursday, August 16th,

116
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:41,910
6:00 AM Pacific,
9:00 AM eastern and a,

117
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:45,040
what's the difference?
What's the difference between here and uh,

118
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,930
was it five hours to England?
Uh, you guys figure it out,

119
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,380
your fucking metric system.

120
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:52,843
You know,

121
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,590
what is somebody, somebody actually
summed up soccer for me. Finally.

122
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,930
How the hell did he describe it?
Oh,

123
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,140
was saying why Americans don't
like soccer. This guy said to me,

124
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:12,510
he goes, we already have this game
over here. We call it hockey. You know,

125
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:17,220
except it's way faster.
This hitting you guys fighting.

126
00:08:17,221 --> 00:08:18,054
It's phenomenal.

127
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:21,600
And it's funny that he said that because
whenever I watch soccer, the, the,

128
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:26,601
the stuff that appeals to me is that it
is like hockey with the off sites and

129
00:08:27,061 --> 00:08:28,380
that type of shit.
But I don't get it.

130
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:32,310
Why the defenseman just gets to stop
and then all of a sudden I'm off sites,

131
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,153
you know,

132
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:39,290
keep running. You do. You know
what I'm trying to do? Like that's,

133
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,630
that's your defense. You don't even have
to knock me on my ass. She just stopped.

134
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:47,490
It's just a terrible game.
You know we have arms.

135
00:08:47,491 --> 00:08:49,920
People use them.

136
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:54,960
What would you watch a sport if all you
used was your arms and you didn't use

137
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:59,670
legs and everyone was just standing
there and maybe sitting on the ground or

138
00:08:59,671 --> 00:09:03,360
maybe just one of those craftmatic beds,
like just throwing balls to one another.

139
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:07,260
Oh my God. Did I just described
murder ball? No, I didn't.

140
00:09:07,261 --> 00:09:12,030
They roll around in their chairs. All
right. This is the money promoting podcast

141
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:18,870
for August 13th I got one more day on
my project here. I'm doing here, man.

142
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:23,220
I, I let the cat out of the bag, Nia,
and I told them that I was going to be a,

143
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,850
I'm working on the pilot for the
reboot of that kid shows zoom.

144
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:31,260
Remember that show?
Do you remember that show used to go.

145
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:35,023
Okay.

146
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,990
Did you try that song again? Zoom.
Muslims. Come on. Zoom, zoom,

147
00:09:39,991 --> 00:09:43,990
zoom, zoom. We're gonna
Zuma. Zuma is Omasum. That's,

148
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:48,150
that's what was the song in the
70s. Come on, give it a try.

149
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,870
We're going to show you just why
we're going to teach you to fly high.

150
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:56,580
It was a drug reference. That whole
thing was take drugs. Come on,

151
00:09:56,581 --> 00:10:00,690
give it a try. We're,
can I show you just why?

152
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:07,010
Why I don't want to do LSD.
Come on. Give it a try. I Dunno,

153
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,930
but come on, we're going to show
you why. Just take the shit.

154
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:14,640
We're gonna teach you to fly high and
everybody had the same stripe shirts on.

155
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:19,880
We're doing a reboot of
that without the drugs. Um,

156
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,140
all right.
So anyways,

157
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:26,520
I'm staying here in the north end of
Boston and I got to tell you something.

158
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:30,660
The Italian nose, make the best
fucking food out there. Bar none.

159
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,820
Go fuck yourselves.
I don't want to hear it.

160
00:10:32,821 --> 00:10:36,760
If you're into Thai food or
you like Scottish fucking, uh,

161
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:40,050
what a Scottish people eat
Nini? What the fuck? What is it?

162
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,890
Haggis yeah, what was it
that's, that's like what?

163
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:48,960
That's like Shetland sheepdog balls with
the, some bangers in the mash there.

164
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:53,220
Um, by the way, when I talk
about, uh, Great Britain,

165
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:58,320
I should state that like a Scotland is
less than thrilled to be part of it.

166
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,640
That was the vibe I got.

167
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:01,640
Yeah.

168
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,510
When I was over there.

169
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:06,620
This is really just my ignorant travel
channel show this time, isn't it? Um,

170
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,040
so anyways, we didn't stay in
here in the north end and a,

171
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:12,530
all that mainly doing is eating
Italian food. I'm having a great time,

172
00:11:12,531 --> 00:11:16,190
but as of last night I was finally fucking
sick of it when I had some Gnocchi,

173
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,740
which is basically potatoes with
wallpaper paste in a little bit of a,

174
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:27,350
was it pesto that they put on there? You
know, I ended up something fucking Irish,

175
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:32,300
but um, I never used to come over
to the north end. You leave in Nia.

176
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:38,060
Okay, bye bye. It's like I said to that
old lady in the wheelchair by, by, by,

177
00:11:38,061 --> 00:11:41,600
by um,
what a sport.

178
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,740
I actually woke her up and kicked her
out of the hotel room so I could do this,

179
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:50,610
you know. Hey, if you want to come
back later, I have another microphone.

180
00:11:50,611 --> 00:11:52,890
If you want to do the final
fucking 10 minutes, I know.

181
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:55,150
Are Dying to know what's
going on in your life.

182
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:56,873
Yeah.

183
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,940
I thought you going to
slam the door on me.

184
00:11:58,941 --> 00:12:03,410
That would have a great
a nod to Jim Norton. Um,

185
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:06,740
anyway, so we've been
hanging out here. Uh,

186
00:12:06,741 --> 00:12:09,720
I got fucking octopus
coming out my fucking e's.

187
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:11,630
Yeah,

188
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:15,770
no, I've eaten way too much Italian food.
I'll even know why I love it. I'm done.

189
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,340
Okay.
I've had fucking total lady.

190
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:25,400
I've had fettuccine Ed fucking
Spaghetti weedy. I've had everything.

191
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:29,970
I had a red [inaudible].
Um, that went right.

192
00:12:29,971 --> 00:12:30,840
Fucking threw me.

193
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:32,650
Okay.

194
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:37,650
I wish it would be great if there was a
website that had a picture of a bunch of

195
00:12:37,961 --> 00:12:40,900
people's different faces when they
ate something that, that, that,

196
00:12:40,901 --> 00:12:44,320
that moment when they realize it's going
right through them and they realize

197
00:12:44,321 --> 00:12:45,550
that they're in a public place,

198
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:51,060
it's going to get ugly and they're doing
the math on how far away the nearest

199
00:12:53,771 --> 00:12:58,360
private toilet that they know is versus
how bad that feeling is in your gut.

200
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:03,730
Uh, let's just say wrapped it up pretty
damn quick with the person I was with.

201
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:08,800
Um,
anyways,

202
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:12,070
and then he had some
big festival down here,

203
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:14,880
some sort of religious thing
where they had a picture of him,

204
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,010
they had like Mary and
everyone was putting dollars
on or I don't know what the

205
00:13:18,011 --> 00:13:21,640
hell that one is. I felt like I
was in some sort of Scorsese movie.

206
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:27,250
Um, and then they were playing this
Frank Sinatra music, which is just a,

207
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:28,750
it's just the best music ever.

208
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:33,310
It just makes you feel like you're
a fucking millionaire. You know,

209
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,140
they started playing this summer when,
you know,

210
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:40,170
the summer when it came blowing
in from a cross does see.

211
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:42,123
Right.

212
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:46,470
And of course it sounded amazing and if
for some stupid fucking reason they just

213
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:50,170
write as I'm hearing the
beginning of that song, you know,

214
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:55,200
that fucking little keyboard starts
playing and then the little fucking hits

215
00:13:55,241 --> 00:13:59,020
with the horns and you're already swaying
as you're walking down the street and

216
00:13:59,021 --> 00:14:01,180
I'm walking towards it,
right? Just mesmerized.

217
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:06,520
And all of a sudden this fucking
attitude voice starts singing with it.

218
00:14:06,521 --> 00:14:11,521
And I realized that doing Sinatra like
Karaoke and it was some little girl going

219
00:14:11,561 --> 00:14:16,561
up there and she was so fucking
flat and off I couldn't get.

220
00:14:17,051 --> 00:14:17,884
And I like,

221
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:23,510
it was like frank singing like this summer
when Kay blow it in and she's on top

222
00:14:23,761 --> 00:14:24,594
of that.

223
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:25,670
Okay.

224
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:28,520
Worth their fucking eight
year old high pitched voice.

225
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:32,870
I can't even do it.
My voice is shot.

226
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:37,550
And I was like immediately turned in the
other direction and I was trying to get

227
00:14:37,551 --> 00:14:40,940
out away from it. But the way the north
end is set up with all the streets,

228
00:14:40,941 --> 00:14:42,980
diagonal and all the
buildings close together,

229
00:14:42,981 --> 00:14:46,130
it was just echoing down all the streets
and I couldn't fucking get away with it.

230
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,740
So addie go up fucking causeway street.

231
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:50,230
Okay.

232
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:50,470
Right.

233
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:55,040
Press the that goes over the fucking
Chiles town that you saw in the movie,

234
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:59,870
the town. And I walked up two,
uh, I walked up to the garden,

235
00:14:59,871 --> 00:15:04,871
Boston Garden and I looked at
the Bobby or statue and uh,

236
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:07,880
I got to admit from the side,
it looks like Bobby your,

237
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:10,490
but when you look at the face,
it looks like that bit.

238
00:15:10,491 --> 00:15:15,410
I used to do where remember the old man
face bit for my last special Dulia we'll

239
00:15:15,411 --> 00:15:16,940
do you,
that's what it looked like.

240
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,340
I don't know what it is
about those fucking statues.

241
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:22,820
They can get everything to look
like the guy except for the face.

242
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:28,280
You know the Magic Johnson
Statute doesn't look like him.

243
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:32,660
The Bobby, your statute doesn't look like
him. The Michael Jordan statute. Just,

244
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:37,430
it doesn't look like him. Even with
the tongue sticking out. It's a,

245
00:15:37,431 --> 00:15:41,510
I don't know what it is. They, they can't
make the face. They can't get the face.

246
00:15:41,511 --> 00:15:45,160
Right. Really bill is, is, is this, is
this the level of fucking, you know,

247
00:15:45,161 --> 00:15:49,030
Shit that you think is interesting to
us out. Go fuck yourselves. All right,

248
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:52,660
let's do a little bit of a,
let's get to a dilemma here.

249
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,110
Now, wait, wait. I got some other
stuff to talk about first. Um,

250
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:03,270
before I forget the, I took her,
we actually took a water taxi.

251
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,400
Um, you know, I wanted to surprise Nia.

252
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:12,520
We're going on the water taxi and
women are so fucking intuitive.

253
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:15,630
One of the hardest things to
ever do is to surprise a woman.

254
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:20,850
The second you start thinking,
God, I hope she doesn't notice.

255
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,050
I got, I hope she doesn't
fucking ask me x, Y, and Z.

256
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,330
It's like they sense it.
They were like fucking dogs.

257
00:16:27,331 --> 00:16:30,200
They just pick it up and they'd be like,
what's wrong with what's going on?

258
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:33,950
Nothing. Why are you yelling at
me? What's going on? Freaking.

259
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:37,400
I was going to fucking surprise you.
What? This fucking boat ride. Well,

260
00:16:37,401 --> 00:16:42,150
you don't have to. Yeah, they run real.

261
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:47,910
Like I don't understand why
every interrogator on the
first 48 isn't a fucking

262
00:16:47,911 --> 00:16:52,060
woman. Their ability that,

263
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:57,280
that's one of those things that
nature gave him because nature new,

264
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,990
right nature knew that
fuck and Eddie nature.

265
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,150
He knew that,
um,

266
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:10,230
that guys could just beat the shit out
of women and there were no laws in place.

267
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,170
You know, back in the day can just,
whatever you want it to do. You know,

268
00:17:14,171 --> 00:17:18,600
if she gave you a rough time, you just
balled up your big fucking caveman fist,

269
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:22,860
Harry knuckles and all and you fucking
cracked her right in the fucking nose

270
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,480
and it bled all over her woolly
mammoth to piece that she was wearing.

271
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:32,070
And that was the end of the
discussion. So, you know,

272
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,230
they had to adapt.

273
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:39,930
So fucking mother nature gave
him this fucking, I swear to God,

274
00:17:39,931 --> 00:17:41,610
I can't get away with shit.

275
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:46,980
It isn't possible to
surprise Nia. I just, it's,

276
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:49,100
I can't fuck it. It, it drives me nuts.

277
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,910
I don't understand why there's not more
women in, in the world series of poker.

278
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,790
All right bill. We get it. They
can pick up what you're doing.

279
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,040
That's what I'm saying.
So I was sitting there trying,

280
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:01,890
I fucking finally just stopped and I said,

281
00:18:01,891 --> 00:18:06,240
will you stop fucking up the surprise.
And then she just laughed.

282
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:12,480
You know, probably cause it made
her feel more secure. Right.

283
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:16,380
Well good. That's good to know that I
can tell when he's fucking acting weird.

284
00:18:16,381 --> 00:18:20,100
So if he ever did try to be deceitful,
I would be able to pick up on it.

285
00:18:20,101 --> 00:18:23,900
You know what I mean? Fucking
maniacs. So when he was,

286
00:18:23,901 --> 00:18:25,650
so I take her on this water taxi,
right?

287
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:29,100
I bring her over to sue
one of these little fancy
fucking food food stores where

288
00:18:29,101 --> 00:18:32,520
they, you know, they go walking
in where they had the lady Gaga,

289
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,830
where in the fuck in, uh, who's,

290
00:18:34,831 --> 00:18:38,670
who's another one of the horse that they
all think is just amazing fashion sense.

291
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:42,830
Did you see the meat dress? Oh
my God. Not the meat dressed.

292
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:46,920
They obviously don't like that, but
they'd like that fucking veil in the face.

293
00:18:46,921 --> 00:18:50,400
Shit, don't they? Don't they all,

294
00:18:50,401 --> 00:18:53,430
isn't it fair to just lump them all
into one category and then just say

295
00:18:53,431 --> 00:18:57,510
something ignorant? I think it is. I
think that's totally fair. So anyways,

296
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:01,560
we're riding over on the water taxi and
it's a fucking tremendous, you know,

297
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,880
the guy drive and it's an ex
fucking fishing boat captain.

298
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:10,950
So He's loving life. You
know, he's got this great job.

299
00:19:10,951 --> 00:19:13,740
He doesn't have any crew
that he has to deal with.

300
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,260
He doesn't have to go out of the harbor,
you know,

301
00:19:16,261 --> 00:19:19,380
he just gets to cruise around on this
little boat. So he's in a great mood.

302
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:24,450
You know, he's making Nia laugh and he's
breaking my balls way had taken her,

303
00:19:24,451 --> 00:19:27,960
I'll make sure he gets you
something expensive, blah,
blah, blah and all that shit.

304
00:19:27,961 --> 00:19:31,080
We having a great fucking time. So
as we're going over there, right,

305
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:36,840
all I'm doing is, uh, and by the way, if
I ever had a boat, that's all it would do.

306
00:19:36,841 --> 00:19:39,750
I would just go around the harbor.
There's no way I would ever go out to sea.

307
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:42,390
I am unbelief.
I'm terrified.

308
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:45,780
Did you see that fucking video of that
guy just sitting in the ocean and that

309
00:19:45,781 --> 00:19:49,680
hammerhead shark just circling around
them? They, before they fished him out.

310
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,350
You know what I don't get,

311
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:57,550
I don't get why I can't just
be in the ocean treading water.

312
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:02,830
Like why that just immediately make
sharks go, oh, what the fuck is that?

313
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:06,100
I'm not bleeding.
I'm swimming just like a fish.

314
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,110
Why are you so God damn
fucking interested in me?

315
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,320
Why are you fucking 20
miles away? Gone? Oh,

316
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,000
I sense a pair of Alabaster
fucking legs in the water.

317
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:22,150
I think I'm gonna go over here and take
a bite out of them, see how they taste,

318
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,800
and then spin back around again.
And if I liked the way taste,

319
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,660
I'm going to come back and kill it.
I just don't understand that.

320
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:33,490
I could see if you were dead,
you know?

321
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:36,910
And then you know, they're like
the garbage disposals of the ocean.

322
00:20:36,911 --> 00:20:39,610
They come by and they fucking eat you.
But if I'm totally fine,

323
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:44,620
what is their fucking problem?
It's plenty of fish in the sea,

324
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:48,250
right? Why you got to come at me?
What am I doing? I'm treading water.

325
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,940
I know I don't belong here. I, it's just,

326
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:58,400
they're fucking annoying. Another
thing and another thing, oh shit.

327
00:20:58,401 --> 00:21:03,080
I'm on a fucking Roman. A little fucking
rant here. Um, which I'm not, by the way,

328
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,750
I hate everything is
defined as a fucking rant.

329
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:06,830
Okay.

330
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:09,870
You know, he had, he,
everything's a fucking rent.

331
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,930
Everything's awkward
or it's a fucking rant.

332
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:16,080
It isn't a rant is to me is absolutely,

333
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:19,910
you've completely lost your shit.
You're screaming.

334
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:24,080
There's fucking Goddamn foam
at the corner of your mouth.

335
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:25,400
That's a fucking rant.

336
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:26,770
Yeah.

337
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:31,630
Going on some little clever little
fucking 45 second run is not a rant.

338
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:35,110
All right. Yo, dumb cunts on the Internet.

339
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:40,790
Can we clear that up and can we also clear
up that the comic does not heckle the

340
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:43,850
crowd? I know I've brought
this up, but it's becoming,

341
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:49,190
people keep saying that I loved when
you heckled the crowd. No, I'm on stage.

342
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:50,390
Okay.

343
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:53,090
When you're giving the performance,
you can't heckle the crowd.

344
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:54,310
Okay?

345
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:57,850
Heckled. A heckler is someone
who disrupts a performance.

346
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,750
If you're the guy on stage,
am I disrupting the crowds performance?

347
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:05,980
You're not given one.
Sorry.

348
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:09,270
Um,
yeah.

349
00:22:09,271 --> 00:22:12,330
It's fucking shark week on
the discovery channel and a,

350
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,720
I don't know if anybody who works at
Discovery Channel listens to this podcast.

351
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:19,830
All right? But you guys are so
fucking irresponsible over there.

352
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:24,450
Okay? You do all this bullshit
when you talk about sharks,

353
00:22:24,451 --> 00:22:28,940
about how fucking horribly
they're misunderstood, you know?

354
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:30,030
Okay.

355
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:33,120
And the beauty of,
of the species and all this type of stuff.

356
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:37,840
But you always sell it with that
jaws vibe, you know what I mean?

357
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:42,640
It's like, it's literally,
it's like fish fucking racism.

358
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:44,690
Okay.

359
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:49,690
Like the way that they show sharks on
the discovery channel is the way they

360
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:52,580
showed black people in the
news when I was growing up,

361
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:59,490
they did everything but
play the jaws music, um,

362
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:03,530
back in the day and this still
doing it to sharks. All right?

363
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:08,180
And I want to know where all the African
Americans, when it comes to this shit,

364
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:09,831
you know,
why don't,

365
00:23:09,831 --> 00:23:13,460
why don't you have fucking reach out and
have a little bit of fucking empathy?

366
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:16,470
You can't see, you can't
see the parallel, uh, the,

367
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:20,060
the fucking cross pollinization
whenever the fuck he call it.

368
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:21,920
I don't what I'm saying.

369
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:25,400
All I'm saying is I fucking hate the
way they do that where they sit there

370
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:31,230
and they, they, uh, they make it,

371
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:34,020
they make the shark out to be like,

372
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:35,700
yeah,

373
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,980
it's beyond instinct what it's doing.

374
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,980
Like it's sitting there
rubbing its fins together,

375
00:23:40,981 --> 00:23:45,470
thinking about fucking sinners
there stuff to do. Okay,

376
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:46,323
it's hungry.

377
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:51,400
Just get something to eat. You're a
dumb fuck. You're in the ocean, right?

378
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:55,890
I still don't get why.
If I'm just fucking treading water,

379
00:23:55,891 --> 00:23:59,990
why do you have to come over and take
a bite out of my leg? Leave me low.

380
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:03,450
I fucking hate it. And I gotta
tell you something. When I was,

381
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:05,160
I was sitting there waiting
for that water taxi,

382
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:08,950
just looking into that
fucking black water, you know,

383
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:12,420
you can't see,
you can't even see below the surface.

384
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:15,530
I said to Nicole,

385
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:18,710
you couldn't pay me $1 million to
jump in that fucking water right now.

386
00:24:18,711 --> 00:24:21,890
Right there. And immediately jumped,
jump right back out. I wouldn't do it.

387
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,840
And she goes, you know,
you're an asshole. She goes,

388
00:24:23,841 --> 00:24:27,380
I'm going to go to fucking jump in it
just to show you how ridiculous should be.

389
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,990
She goes, there's no shark in there.
And I was like, you know what?

390
00:24:29,991 --> 00:24:31,010
Or maybe there is,

391
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,410
did you see that fucking those people
fishing off their back porch that caught

392
00:24:37,411 --> 00:24:39,900
that fish and all of a sudden
a shark came out of nowhere.

393
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:45,890
The F I, I just, I fucking hate the ocean.

394
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,930
So anyways,
so what,

395
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:52,580
we're on this fucking boat and we're
going by all these God damn ma,

396
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:54,920
all these giant fucking yachts,

397
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:58,430
like $50 million boats
parked out in the harbor.

398
00:24:58,431 --> 00:25:01,040
And I just really
realized like that whole,

399
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,950
like the level of wealth
that is out there,

400
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:10,050
a $50 million boat, a boat, a hobby,

401
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:13,830
something you just got sitting in the
fucking Harvard that maybe you're going to

402
00:25:13,831 --> 00:25:18,210
take out once or twice in a month was
$50 million. Give me a fucking break.

403
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,393
I mean,

404
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,830
if I had,
if I had a $50 million boat,

405
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:27,200
there's no fucking way I
wouldn't be selling drugs.

406
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,440
I would just do it because
it would be so God damn easy.

407
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:37,440
I would just get a brick of fucking
cocaine and I would just fucking put it on

408
00:25:37,441 --> 00:25:42,441
my boat and I would just drive up the
Goddamn coast and I drop it off to

409
00:25:42,751 --> 00:25:43,111
somebody.

410
00:25:43,111 --> 00:25:48,050
I get some money and then I would make
a payment on the boat and now wait and I

411
00:25:48,051 --> 00:25:52,410
got to clean the money that Jesus
say, I get caught. All right,

412
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,270
strike that.
I will be the guy driving.

413
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:57,330
I wouldn't drive the boat because I'm
afraid of the ocean. You know what?

414
00:25:57,331 --> 00:26:01,260
Fuck yachts. Okay, let's get a little
fucking advertising here for the week.

uh, your direction. There you go. All
right. That was painless wasn't it?

447
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:04,020
Um, you don't actually have
to get a will done and I have,

448
00:28:04,021 --> 00:28:09,021
I have been putting that off because
I'm superstitious when it comes to that.

449
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:11,440
I feel like if I start to write a will,

450
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:16,090
that means I'm saying to the universe
like, all right, tapping out,

451
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:20,320
I've had enough. But, um, I'm actually,

452
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,940
I got inspired to do it.

453
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,250
Okay.

454
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:26,530
Uh,
this past week a,

455
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:30,250
a one of my relatives passed
away unfortunately, and um,

456
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,740
he had to go to the funeral,

457
00:28:31,741 --> 00:28:36,630
but this person had it all worked
out right down to their outro song

458
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:42,580
and I underrated picking
the music for your funeral.

459
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:46,780
As Morbid as that is, you got to
realize we're all going to go someday.

460
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:51,910
And uh, this funeral
was, was fucking awesome.

461
00:28:51,911 --> 00:28:52,744
It was,

462
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:57,930
it was a celebration of a life and
there was way more laughing than crying.

463
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:01,870
And I think a lot of that
had to do with the music.

464
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:07,260
Fucking outro, music, wheeling
out of the Church, uh,

465
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:11,190
when the saints go marching in was this
person's favorite song. And it was,

466
00:29:11,191 --> 00:29:14,790
it was, it was the shit. And I really
got inspired. I was sitting there going,

467
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,810
what the hell would I, what?
What's, it seems like, you know,

468
00:29:18,811 --> 00:29:21,510
old people's like that
their music is appropriate.

469
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,930
It's such great music that it's
appropriate for any situation.

470
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:28,740
And I'm really trying to think like,
of the music that I listened to,

471
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:35,450
you know, all that heavy metal and
fuck and Zeppelin and ac DC. I mean,

472
00:29:35,451 --> 00:29:38,210
I can't have any ACDC
plane as I'm wheeled out.

473
00:29:38,211 --> 00:29:42,100
Half of that's about the devil and going
to hell. I don't to put that out there.

474
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:46,330
You didn't have those three things from
ghost come up or you remember that shit

475
00:29:46,331 --> 00:29:50,140
and drag me down. Um, but I,

476
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:54,400
I'm telling you underrated. So I want
to know from you guys. All right,

477
00:29:54,401 --> 00:29:58,450
when you kick the bucket, tell me about
how you're going to do your funeral.

478
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,610
How would you like it to be done?

479
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:02,900
And,
uh,

480
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:07,210
yeah. Outro music and all that type
of shit. What are you gonna do?

481
00:30:07,211 --> 00:30:10,060
Are you going to be going in the box?
You're going to get cremated.

482
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,040
This is fucked up,
huh?

483
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:15,200
You got to make these decisions
and if you need to make a well,

484
00:30:15,201 --> 00:30:19,570
go to legal zoom.com Bam. There you
go. In and out right there. All right.

485
00:30:19,571 --> 00:30:22,950
What else happened this week
in the world of sports? Uh,

486
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:25,750
Dwight Howard went to the
Lakers and absolute shocker,

487
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:30,910
absolute shocker that yet another guy
who couldn't win a championship somewhere

488
00:30:30,911 --> 00:30:35,590
else is now going to go pile on
with the Lakers. It's ridiculous.

489
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:36,191
It's,

490
00:30:36,191 --> 00:30:41,191
they have literally become the New York
Yankees of the NBA every fucking year

491
00:30:42,101 --> 00:30:47,020
they do this and I want Koby Bryant
to start getting some shit for this.

492
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:51,490
If you're going to give fucking
Lebron James Shit for pilot,

493
00:30:51,491 --> 00:30:56,380
for leaving Cleveland and pile on
piling on in Miami than God dammit.

494
00:30:56,410 --> 00:31:01,150
Coby has had people fucking coming to
him for his entire Goddamn career 15

495
00:31:01,151 --> 00:31:05,830
fucking years in a row and they got the
nerve to sit there and compare this guy

496
00:31:05,831 --> 00:31:08,410
to Jordan.
Look at the fucking teams.

497
00:31:08,411 --> 00:31:12,280
This guy he's been on and go back and
look at those Chicago Bulls teams and I

498
00:31:12,281 --> 00:31:16,540
want to, I want you to start telling
me Dennis Rodman is the only fucking

499
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:22,480
like free agent that I can really
remember that they signed. All right,

500
00:31:22,481 --> 00:31:26,140
and he was,
it was one fucking guy.

501
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:31,440
Coby gets two, three guys every
year. Oh, it's ridiculous.

502
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:36,600
It's absolutely ridiculous.
I'm telling you as a crabby old man,

503
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:41,790
these are not your father's championships.
These are not championship teams.

504
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:42,600
These,

505
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:47,310
there's no difference between these
championship teams and that rich kid whose

506
00:31:47,311 --> 00:31:52,080
first car is like a fucking Goddamn
Maserati because his dad is rich.

507
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:54,390
All right.
You know,

508
00:31:54,391 --> 00:31:59,391
it's so fucked up about these teams
and I include the 2008 Celtics in this.

509
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:02,190
That was a, that was a bought
and paid for championship.

510
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,760
I know they put the work in. I know all
of that, but it's not the fucking same.

511
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:10,560
This is the funny thing about these pile
on teams is I remember as a kid when

512
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:14,640
you'd be out outside at recess and
they'd say, we'd start picking teams.

513
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:19,860
If they got too lopsided, kids
would be, oh wait a minute,

514
00:32:19,861 --> 00:32:20,880
that's not fair.
They would,

515
00:32:20,881 --> 00:32:24,990
people flip out and they'd break up the
teams and you balance it out where I was

516
00:32:24,991 --> 00:32:28,740
from there, it was called mk teams. I
don't even know where that came from.

517
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:33,780
The TCIS schmuck teams, these teams
are smug, which meant it was bullshit.

518
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:37,410
You had Shaq and Kobe and
all these fucking guys are
one team was going to be a

519
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,980
goddamn bloodbath. All right. And even
it's like second and third graders,

520
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:46,990
we understood how fucking pointless it
was to then go out and play the game.

521
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:51,530
If you had all the most talented
people on one fucking team, right?

522
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,910
So we broke it up and we would,

523
00:32:52,911 --> 00:32:57,080
we would have it evened out and we'd
have a great game during fucking recess.

524
00:32:57,081 --> 00:32:58,760
Now,
if we can understand that,

525
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:04,420
why can't full grown adults understand
that in these leaks and professional

526
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:09,290
leagues, why can't they understand that?
All right? But if that's the way it is,

527
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:12,800
I accept it.
I accept these pile on championships,

528
00:33:12,801 --> 00:33:15,890
but I want them to be called that.
All right.

529
00:33:15,891 --> 00:33:18,860
The same way they had the dead
ball and then the live ball era,

530
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:23,390
these fucking Laker championships, Celtics
championships, Miami championships,

531
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:26,840
these are not the same
as the ones in the 80s,

532
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:31,070
right through the fucking Chicago Bulls.
I would even say the Spurs,

533
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:37,040
you know the David Robinson,
uh, Tim Duncan ones like,

534
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,180
I don't want to hear it.

535
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:44,380
Don't fucking be talking about don't
bring up Larry and magic and all these

536
00:33:44,961 --> 00:33:48,440
other guys with the guys at today.
It's different. Okay. Because

537
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:53,640
just imagine back in the day of bird
magic just piled on and got on the same

538
00:33:53,641 --> 00:33:56,040
fucking team.
Like why is that enjoyable?

539
00:33:58,090 --> 00:34:02,440
I gotta be honest with you. That first
Dream Team, I didn't even watch it.

540
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:08,450
I didn't want to watch fucking Larry Bird,
magic Johnson,

541
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:13,070
a key Malaysia one,
Charles Barkley go play Rwanda.

542
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,950
You know what I mean? What am I
going to do next? What and then what?

543
00:34:16,951 --> 00:34:20,310
Watch me go play a game of wiffle
ball with some fucking second graders.

544
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:24,210
Like I don't understand what,
where, what is the thrill in that?

545
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:28,860
And if you're in one of those cities and
you're getting all these guys and you

546
00:34:28,861 --> 00:34:32,180
fucking sites and you don't give a shit,
um,

547
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:35,230
that's cause you don't understand.
You don't eat,

548
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:39,380
you don't even understand sports you and
you're the same kind of person that I

549
00:34:39,381 --> 00:34:42,290
bet I bet cannot be swayed in an argument.

550
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,290
Even if somebody makes
a good fucking point.

551
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:48,140
Cause all you want to do is be right.
You just want to win like that.

552
00:34:48,141 --> 00:34:51,260
Fox News kind of,
uh,

553
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:55,040
like debating style where it's all good.

554
00:34:55,041 --> 00:34:56,990
If you agree with me and
if you don't agree with me,

555
00:34:56,991 --> 00:34:59,690
I'm just going to yell at you and cut
out your mic and that's going to be the

556
00:34:59,691 --> 00:35:03,290
fucking debate. Um, it sucks. Okay.

557
00:35:03,291 --> 00:35:05,180
So now I'm down to two sports,

558
00:35:05,181 --> 00:35:09,050
no football and hockey
because you can't do that.

559
00:35:09,051 --> 00:35:11,660
And either one of those sports
because they have a hard cap.

560
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:16,280
I know people say in baseball they have
a hard cap yet will they have a loophole

561
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:20,150
that you can drive a $200 million
team through call the luxury tax.

562
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:21,920
You can just basically pay it off

563
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:26,720
and you can go out and buy everybody
on the fucking planet. So I dunno.

564
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:28,910
Yeah,

565
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:31,700
I dunno. I got to find some
different sports to take place of,

566
00:35:31,701 --> 00:35:36,190
of Hoop and fucking baseball cause I'm
done with both of those sports until they,

567
00:35:36,191 --> 00:35:41,150
they, they just fucking, you know, help.
I don't know. It's just fucking stupid.

568
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:44,600
You know what it is about those teams?
Why I don't respect them?

569
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:48,710
Because it takes more money than brains.

570
00:35:48,711 --> 00:35:50,600
Cells to put those fucking teams together.

571
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:53,480
Back in the day you need a brain cells.
You had to like break down.

572
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:58,460
People get to see stuff before other
people saw it. Now you just go, hey,

573
00:35:58,461 --> 00:36:01,520
we need a center. Who's the best guy
available? What's he being offered?

574
00:36:01,521 --> 00:36:04,670
Offer him 10 million more. Next
problem. I could fucking do that.

575
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:08,930
Bite a bottomless pit of cash.
That's fucking, it's depressing.

576
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:11,340
It's depressing.
So,

577
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:12,720
okay.

578
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:17,190
I Dunno, but I still don't
think the Lakers have the
coach. I know God damn well.

579
00:36:17,191 --> 00:36:19,050
Colby Bryant doesn't fucking respect them.

580
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:22,320
You know when you're doing great in the
game and the coach goes to high five you

581
00:36:22,321 --> 00:36:23,640
and you completely ignore him.

582
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,730
I would say that that's a complete
lack of respect. What do you think?

583
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:31,320
Am I crazy to think that?
Am I crazy?

584
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:37,200
Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo
Doo. All right, he voice everybody.

585
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:41,070
Here we go is another way to start up.
If you're going to start up your business,

586
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,320
I'm slowly getting advertising here.

587
00:36:43,321 --> 00:36:46,440
That subtly is going to get you
out of your cubicle. All right.

588
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:49,620
He voice your mobile phone at work.
Uh,

589
00:36:49,621 --> 00:36:53,460
one of the great he voice features
is call recording. It's easy to use.

590
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:58,670
All you have to do is press star two
to start a stop recordings during any

591
00:36:59,761 --> 00:37:03,810
incoming or outgoing call. Um,
basically what he voice is,

592
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:08,910
is you have these, what do they call
them? Viral, viral, uh, phone numbers.

593
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,790
You could basically with your cell
phone get, you know, like three,

594
00:37:13,791 --> 00:37:16,850
four other phone numbers and it just
will ring to your own damn phone.

595
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,280
No one has to know what
your real phone number is.

596
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:23,120
It's a great way to be at
work and actually have a
private business going on so

597
00:37:23,121 --> 00:37:24,080
you can just,
you know,

598
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:27,290
rather than having to save up your
trinkets that you cubicle job.

599
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:28,530
Okay,

600
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:31,110
you don't want to have to start from
square one to start your new business.

601
00:37:31,111 --> 00:37:31,770
You can be,

602
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:36,770
you can actually be sitting in your
cubicle taking business calls for your own

603
00:37:37,111 --> 00:37:40,590
business without those bosses
known about it. It's phenomenal.

604
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:45,960
Um, anyways, the file
is then saved as an MP,

605
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:46,651
uh,

606
00:37:46,651 --> 00:37:50,490
on a wave file and you can store it on
your computer to refer back to later at a

607
00:37:50,491 --> 00:37:55,320
later date if need be. Um, all
right. Call recording from eve.

608
00:37:55,321 --> 00:37:58,350
Voice is perfect for doctors,
lawyers, real estate agents,

609
00:37:58,351 --> 00:38:01,170
hiring managers or any
professional discussing contracts.

610
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:03,840
If it's even great,

611
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:08,850
if you just don't have a pen handy or
you're in the car driving and can't write

612
00:38:08,851 --> 00:38:09,570
something down.

613
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:14,280
Other eve voice features include call
forwarding music on hold voicemail to text

614
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:19,260
toll free numbers and 1-800-NUMBERS
for free. Six months trial.

615
00:38:19,261 --> 00:38:20,250
Go to ww.

616
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:21,730
Okay.

617
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:26,730
Dot e voice.com/bill burr or go to the
banner on my podcast page at [inaudible]

618
00:38:27,281 --> 00:38:30,550
dot com. Um, yeah, it's phenomenal.

619
00:38:30,551 --> 00:38:33,790
If you can make you have conference
calls with up to 90 people,

620
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:34,841
it's just a great,

621
00:38:34,841 --> 00:38:39,400
and they actually have like professional
voice actors that will, uh, you know,

622
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:43,690
give you some little, a fancy
outgoing message, you know,

623
00:38:43,691 --> 00:38:48,280
so it actually sounds like you have an
office when you don't. It's phenomenal.

624
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:53,250
He voice everybody. Go check it out.
All right, back to the podcast. Um,

625
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:54,810
okay.

626
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:57,460
All right. What do we got here? Let's
get it. Let's get on with dilemmas here.

627
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,730
The lemme ish. Okay. Hey Bill,

628
00:39:00,731 --> 00:39:04,630
would you rather have as many gold
medals as Michael Phelps or as many super

629
00:39:04,631 --> 00:39:09,280
bowl rings? Is Joe Montana? Uh,
or do I get to be Joe Montana?

630
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:15,000
Seeing that and that's that,
that little odd dilemma.

631
00:39:15,001 --> 00:39:16,290
I don't know if I'm Joe Montana,

632
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:18,690
if I'm going to have as
many rings as Joe Montana,

633
00:39:18,691 --> 00:39:22,740
I want to be Joe Montana or Jerry Rice.
I want to be somebody that they remember.

634
00:39:22,741 --> 00:39:25,350
I don't want to be the
fucking left tackle, you know,

635
00:39:25,351 --> 00:39:28,530
per protecting the blindside or whatever
the fuck's going on there. Right.

636
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,430
I don't wanna be that guy.

637
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:35,540
I want to be suddenly that
somebody remembers Ronnie
Lott or be Michael Phelps.

638
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:39,400
MMM.

639
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,920
That's a good one because you know what
sucks about being Michael Phelps is like,

640
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:47,950
he's kind of done at 24.
You know,

641
00:39:47,951 --> 00:39:50,830
he's gonna come back at 28
and not quite be as fast.

642
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:54,340
Those sports where you just
finished at 24 like tennis.

643
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:57,640
Um,
I dunno

644
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:03,900
Michael Phelps,
but football's such a man's sport,

645
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:08,570
but you can't walk when you're 40.
Although I saw Joe Montana in a,

646
00:40:08,571 --> 00:40:13,420
in a, in a restaurant and
you still look great. Uh,

647
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:18,250
fuck debt. I'd rather win super bowls.
I'd rather win super bowls. There you go.

648
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,080
All right,
dear is billion.

649
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:24,990
I am friends with a lot of people
who have a lot of delusional hobbies

650
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,880
throughout the last couple of years. I've
had to attend their shitty band shows,

651
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:34,560
the shows for this shitty bands to make
that a little more clearer or go to

652
00:40:34,561 --> 00:40:35,520
their place.

653
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:41,120
I've even been asked to donate money for
the cost of making a CD and solicited

654
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:46,140
to donate to a buddy short
film so he can make it. Well,

655
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:48,480
it sounds like you have a lot
of motivated friends here.

656
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:54,740
What do you [inaudible] are you
the Heda? Maybe he's right. Let's,

657
00:40:54,741 --> 00:40:58,430
let's read the rest of this before
I judge them. I repeat a short film.

658
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:00,590
Well,

659
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:05,420
I made a short film with the Teen Idols
Sensation Joe to Rosa and Robert Kelly

660
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:10,480
who's on a new fucking TV show called
the Bronx crew or something like that on

661
00:41:11,931 --> 00:41:15,470
Fx. Like no joke. He's like the lead.

662
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:20,050
Um,
and a god Damn TV show Bob,

663
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:25,190
Huh? Yeah. Great. It is to see that form.

664
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:28,700
I've watched that man
for 20 years on stand up.

665
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:33,820
They would stand up doing plays and all
that type of shit and he hung in there

666
00:41:33,951 --> 00:41:37,070
and he kept swinging and he put his
fucking head down a bang. Look at that.

667
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:42,770
It's fucking phenomenal. Anyways, all
all of this wouldn't be so bad. Yeah.

668
00:41:42,771 --> 00:41:45,140
We made a short film of gotten
to the Tribeca film festival.

669
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,060
You know Joe to Rosa is now on his
way to having a little burgeoning,

670
00:41:50,061 --> 00:41:53,790
like a directing career. All
right. Don't knock a short film,

671
00:41:53,791 --> 00:41:56,370
so are you have no idea where
this could go. Anyways, he goes,

672
00:41:56,371 --> 00:42:01,371
all of this wouldn't be so bad if all
of their stupid hobby hobbies didn't

673
00:42:01,501 --> 00:42:06,501
always end up costing me at least 40
bucks from donations to cover charges at

674
00:42:07,021 --> 00:42:08,670
the Gig they're playing,

675
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:13,680
etc. The most recent one is a friend's
Improv class showcase where I get to

676
00:42:14,581 --> 00:42:19,020
watch a bunch of amateurs put on a show
with a two drink minimum and ticket

677
00:42:19,021 --> 00:42:23,490
costs. Exactly what I want
to do with my free time. Now,

678
00:42:23,491 --> 00:42:24,450
my question is,

679
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:30,290
can I just start a blanket policy of
not going to any more of these and not

680
00:42:30,841 --> 00:42:33,450
donating without coming
off like a complete Dick.

681
00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:37,080
I want to make the Improv
show my last event.

682
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:42,750
Then never support the hobbies of my
untalented friends that constantly pissed

683
00:42:42,751 --> 00:42:44,670
my money away.
To put it bluntly,

684
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:49,530
my friends events aren't exactly the
same as you going to support Dane Cook in

685
00:42:49,531 --> 00:42:53,180
the producers. He probably had
the decency to comp your ticket.

686
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:54,770
Yeah.

687
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:57,540
And any help is greatly appreciated.
We'll do it.

688
00:42:57,550 --> 00:43:01,670
But you have to understand is that Dane
didn't start off doing starring in the

689
00:43:01,671 --> 00:43:03,680
producers at the Hollywood bowl.

690
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:08,890
We did open mikes and shitty restaurants
and we had to learn how to do stand up.

691
00:43:09,351 --> 00:43:14,060
Look, if you're always having to go to
these things, I understand that, but um,

692
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:17,373
you know,

693
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:23,080
you know something, I wouldn't want you
to come to my show if I was starting out.

694
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:26,290
You just seem really like
annoyed by the whole thing.

695
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:30,010
You're going to have a negative vibe
and I just would feel like I would be on

696
00:43:30,011 --> 00:43:32,050
stage as I'm trying to
learn how to do standup.

697
00:43:32,051 --> 00:43:35,260
And I would look out at you and you would
have like your eyebrows up like, Gee,

698
00:43:35,261 --> 00:43:37,780
you know,
like think he'd done yet.

699
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:42,880
Rarely you thought that was funny. You
know, you wouldn't even be smiling.

700
00:43:42,881 --> 00:43:47,260
You just be staring at me like, was that
the last one? Can I go now? Can I leave?

701
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:51,070
Um, so it sounds to me like
you need a hobby. All right?

702
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:56,530
You need more of a social life and a
then you wouldn't have time to go to all

703
00:43:56,531 --> 00:43:57,364
your friends.

704
00:43:59,350 --> 00:44:00,183
MMM.

705
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:04,730
I Dunno. Plays and all this. I find it
weird that you don't do any of this shit.

706
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:09,060
You know that you have people
making short films, you know,

707
00:44:09,061 --> 00:44:13,050
people in bands and you know,
people in Improv classes.

708
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:17,940
You kind of spanning the
performance, uh, rainbow there yet.

709
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:20,730
Do you perform?
Do you want to perform?

710
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:25,020
Why aren't you a performer?
If you hang out with all these performers,

711
00:44:25,590 --> 00:44:27,480
I don't understand what's
going on with you, sir.

712
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:32,400
Did you go to some high school for the
gifted and the time you realize that you

713
00:44:32,401 --> 00:44:34,680
weren't gifted,
it was too late and you just stayed there.

714
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:38,610
So now you're going to school with all
these future Fiona apples and all that

715
00:44:38,611 --> 00:44:39,181
type of shit,

716
00:44:39,181 --> 00:44:43,530
and you're going to watch them play an
acoustic set at the corner of some subway

717
00:44:43,531 --> 00:44:46,590
franchise and you've had it. I don't know
what it is served, but you know what?

718
00:44:46,591 --> 00:44:50,490
Be Your own God. Damn
man. Just say, listen,

719
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:54,890
I don't fucking want to go to
any a shit anymore. All right?

720
00:44:54,891 --> 00:44:58,340
I don't have the money or the time.
I would rather see the completed,

721
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:01,670
call me when you make it
and give me a free ticket.

722
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,970
And then you can be the guy when
they do the, uh, the early days,

723
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:08,240
you'll be that guy.
You know,

724
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:11,930
you'll be one of those documentaries
where nobody from the band.

725
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:16,850
That's always like a major red flag
when they're doing a documentary on a

726
00:45:16,851 --> 00:45:21,410
person,
like an actor or a band or an athlete,

727
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:24,050
and that person,
the person,

728
00:45:24,051 --> 00:45:28,190
the subject isn't in the documentary
and neither are any of the person's

729
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:32,890
immediate friends. And then they always
go to a guy like this guy, like, Yay,

730
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:34,880
I used to fuck in a,

731
00:45:34,881 --> 00:45:38,790
he's to see him go on in front of
fucking two people up, put the,

732
00:45:39,230 --> 00:45:43,320
you'll end up being that guy, you
know. Well, this is the thing, surf.

733
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:46,640
Any of those people make it,
you better not be that Douche who said,

734
00:45:46,641 --> 00:45:50,540
I always believed in you because you
don't believe in these people on any

735
00:45:50,541 --> 00:45:53,090
fucking level. So, uh,

736
00:45:54,730 --> 00:45:59,140
I would start, I would just fucking
make sure you had other plants.

737
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:01,800
That's the easiest way to,

738
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:04,520
if you want to be nice and not hurt
their feelings or you could just fucking

739
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:09,090
come right out with it and just be like,
listen, I've seen you improv before.

740
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:11,790
Um,
I'm going to wait six months in late.

741
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:16,200
Maybe you'll get much better at it and
it'll be entertaining for me. Okay,

742
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:19,400
I'm going to go to a bar
and go hit on a girl.

743
00:46:19,430 --> 00:46:22,790
That's how I want to Improv because I
don't know what I'm going to say either.

744
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,590
Okay. I'll throw it a subject. Me fucking
that girl over there. Go Fuck Yourself.

745
00:46:27,591 --> 00:46:31,700
I'm out about that. All
right, next one bill.

746
00:46:31,701 --> 00:46:32,720
Should I have kids?

747
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:35,900
How the fuck he supposed to know
if you should have kids or not?

748
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:40,610
Neither my wife nor I have strong feelings
either way and we are getting to that

749
00:46:40,611 --> 00:46:45,080
age where it stops making sense. So we
need to make a decision and live with it.

750
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:50,680
Um, yeah. If you're not
feeling it, don't do it.

751
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:56,050
This plenty of fucking kids is plenty
kids to go out and adopt. You know?

752
00:46:56,051 --> 00:46:59,890
If you realize later that, oh,
maybe I wanted a kid. Well what age?

753
00:46:59,891 --> 00:47:02,260
What am I kid Ben? If I had
one, probably about eight. Yeah,

754
00:47:02,261 --> 00:47:03,370
let me get an eight year old.

755
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:07,990
Let me get it out and let me get to
eight year olds in a fucking seven and

756
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:12,520
throwing the 11 here we go. Then you
have a fucking big Brady bunch family.

757
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:16,910
There's plenty of kids out there
that need to be adopted and uh,

758
00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:19,600
there's too many fucking people on the
planet and we're running out of natural

759
00:47:19,601 --> 00:47:21,280
resources. And, uh,

760
00:47:21,850 --> 00:47:26,850
my belief is that the population problem
is going to be handled like a fucking

761
00:47:28,151 --> 00:47:30,180
term paper.
You know,

762
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:33,670
the same way we handled y two
k at the last fucking second.

763
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:36,250
And when you do shit at
the last fucking second,

764
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:40,390
it's going to be a rash
fucking quick decisions,

765
00:47:40,391 --> 00:47:45,070
which means there's going to be some
sort of final solution going on.

766
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:48,400
I really believe that we are
rapidly headed towards that.

767
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:53,010
You know, if they don't, I mean,

768
00:47:53,011 --> 00:47:56,550
we have 7 billion people on the planet
and there's no politician going, hey,

769
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:58,333
you know,

770
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:02,390
why don't you just fucking
not have kids for a minute?

771
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:06,140
Or if you're not really feeling it or
we'll give you some money not to have kids

772
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:07,640
is fucking insane.

773
00:48:09,850 --> 00:48:10,683
I Dunno.

774
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:14,670
We'll run it on a chicken
and fucking soup. Uh,

775
00:48:15,290 --> 00:48:17,950
that didn't even make sense.
Alright, cheating. Hey Bill.

776
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:19,560
Okay.

777
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:22,950
Um, word on the street is,
you're the male version of Oprah,

778
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:28,410
so hear me out. You know what? That's
actually insulting to Oprah. All right.

779
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:29,850
Um,

780
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:34,320
I've got this lady I'm fooling around
with now and then she has a boyfriend but

781
00:48:34,321 --> 00:48:38,970
doesn't seem to mind hooking up
with me when I asked her to. Yeah.

782
00:48:38,971 --> 00:48:42,200
That chick's of fucking
nightmare, dude. I am.

783
00:48:42,201 --> 00:48:44,990
Before we even go [inaudible] you're not
going to have a relationship with her.

784
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:46,730
Yeah.

785
00:48:46,730 --> 00:48:47,910
If she cheats on so much,

786
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:52,250
she'll end up cheating on you and every
time you fuck her or you're risking one

787
00:48:52,251 --> 00:48:55,670
of these times at boyfriend's going to
find out and he might show up with a tire

788
00:48:55,671 --> 00:49:00,110
iron and a, you know,
remodel your face. Anyways,

789
00:49:00,111 --> 00:49:00,920
when we met,

790
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:05,630
she never wants to go further than second
base saying that would be cheating.

791
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:07,340
Um,

792
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:12,320
last night I went to her house
to pick her up for a party. Dude,

793
00:49:12,321 --> 00:49:15,290
there's not another woman out there
that you could pick up for a party.

794
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:18,720
What are you doing, dude? Do
you want to be that guide?

795
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:21,430
You want to be the guy who fucking plays
with the tits is some fucking broad

796
00:49:21,431 --> 00:49:22,264
that has a boyfriend

797
00:49:23,590 --> 00:49:24,423
come on.

798
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:25,940
Ah,

799
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:30,940
there's nothing makes a guy
weaker than a fucking easy pussy.

800
00:49:31,850 --> 00:49:34,040
Easy Pussy.
His brought down more goddamn men,

801
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:38,720
the layup piece of ass.
Um,

802
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:43,490
because we're lazy anyways, before we
made it. And when I say we're lazy,

803
00:49:43,491 --> 00:49:45,500
I mean human beings in general.
All right ladies,

804
00:49:45,501 --> 00:49:49,590
before you fucking pat yourself on the
back and make your tits Schick. Um,

805
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:55,660
uh, last night I went to her house
to pick her up for a party. Uh,

806
00:49:55,670 --> 00:50:00,650
before we made it in the, in the
car, I had her up against my car.

807
00:50:01,070 --> 00:50:04,820
We were making out like war.
World War Two ended.

808
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:10,120
I then suggested suggestively
opened the door to the back seat,

809
00:50:10,370 --> 00:50:11,570
but instead of entering,

810
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:16,610
she asked me if I loved her or
if I just wanted sex. Yeah. Dude,

811
00:50:16,611 --> 00:50:21,350
this girl is crazy. I neither confirmed
nor denied either of those questions.

812
00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:25,970
Yeah, that's stupid. That's a
great lie. That's great. All right.

813
00:50:26,210 --> 00:50:30,690
This is just straight across the,
this is a linear story begins with deceit,

814
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:33,830
goes into the seat and it's
going to end with it. Um,

815
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:35,480
I just went back to kissing her.

816
00:50:36,370 --> 00:50:36,750
Okay.

817
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:40,080
After she got drunk at the party.
Oh Jesus.

818
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:43,410
That and you're sitting there
like a fucking wolf waiting
for it to get hammered.

819
00:50:43,870 --> 00:50:44,160
Uh,

820
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:48,510
we talked again and she said she was
willing to dump her boyfriend and have sex

821
00:50:50,910 --> 00:50:53,280
with me if I just told her that I love her

822
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:56,460
and want to be with her.

823
00:50:57,210 --> 00:50:57,560
Yeah.

824
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:00,190
I actually don't,
but I really want to bang this chick.

825
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:04,810
I was thinking about just saying I love
her and then dumping her after we banked.

826
00:51:05,050 --> 00:51:09,550
But I guess that would be kind of a dick
move. Yeah, it would be, but I got it.

827
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:12,310
We got it. Everybody's got to take
responsibility for their actions.

828
00:51:12,550 --> 00:51:16,630
This fucking woman is setting herself
up for this shit. My Morris comp,

829
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:20,470
my moral compass has no needle
needle bill. Help me out.

830
00:51:21,490 --> 00:51:22,930
Greetings from Belgium.

831
00:51:24,190 --> 00:51:24,680
Okay.

832
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:25,131
Uh,

833
00:51:25,131 --> 00:51:28,640
I hope you were able to read that fluently
as you always still look at this guy

834
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:32,400
fucking sarcastic in a second language.
Um,

835
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:37,050
yeah. Listen, uh, you know,

836
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:41,580
do you really want to be this guy that's,
if you believe in Karma,

837
00:51:41,581 --> 00:51:44,400
that's a really bad thing to do.
All right.

838
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:50,310
You're being lazy. Okay? This
girl's obviously damaged.

839
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:54,210
There's something wrong with her.
And um,

840
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,450
if you do what you're thinking of doing,
just so you can bang her,

841
00:51:57,451 --> 00:52:00,360
you're really going to devastate her.
And Is it worth devastating?

842
00:52:00,361 --> 00:52:05,361
Another human being just to get just
the f two FEC it Banger is one for you.

843
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:07,800
This is classic.
All right?

844
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:13,410
This is not my advice.
This is standard advice,

845
00:52:13,470 --> 00:52:15,960
okay?
Here's the deal.

846
00:52:15,990 --> 00:52:19,530
Why don't you rub one out to her
and afterwards immediately think,

847
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:23,790
do I really think about what you're doing
and the way you're going to be getting

848
00:52:23,791 --> 00:52:27,780
this girl and ask yourself if you
really want to do it all right,

849
00:52:28,890 --> 00:52:29,240
okay.

850
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:32,380
And then act accordingly. And
if you still want to do it, um,

851
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:34,610
please don't ever get
a job in a corporation

852
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:40,930
because you will move up that ladder in
20 seconds. Oh my God, he's a sociopath.

853
00:52:40,931 --> 00:52:44,920
He has no feelings. He doesn't care about
people. Let's give them a corner office.

854
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:50,780
MMM, okay. X Porn Star or something.

855
00:52:50,781 --> 00:52:52,510
X Porn is all it says.
Dear Bill,

856
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:57,540
I'm a 22 year old lady seeking some
valuable male insight and perspective.

857
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:01,820
I've been dating my boyfriend for
over a year now and everything's been

858
00:53:01,821 --> 00:53:03,700
incredible. Well, congratulations.

859
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:08,080
I have no feeling that this is going
to go in a different direction.

860
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:14,440
Anyways, we felt like soulmates
and didn't like to be a part.

861
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:18,700
However, all of a sudden it became very
distant towards me. I tried to ignore it,

862
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:22,660
justifying it with some personal issue
he was dealing with. Little did I know.

863
00:53:22,661 --> 00:53:26,860
Those personal issues also
involved me and his ex, o g.

864
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:31,290
G feeling a horribly familiar sense,

865
00:53:32,950 --> 00:53:37,170
feeling a horribly familiar sense.
Infidelity,

866
00:53:37,171 --> 00:53:40,050
Deja Vu.
I think you skipped a word in there.

867
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:43,680
I did something awful I could
kick myself in the face for,

868
00:53:43,681 --> 00:53:45,300
I looked through his laptop.

869
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:49,350
I know it's a really disbelief
despicably Dick thing to do,

870
00:53:50,250 --> 00:53:53,610
but I needed some strand of truth.
Even if it would break my heart.

871
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:55,710
I got to tell you something.

872
00:53:57,770 --> 00:54:02,030
If he was being a good guy
and you did that, you know,

873
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:03,890
that's a piece of shit thing to do

874
00:54:05,150 --> 00:54:07,310
and the fact that he was giving you the,

875
00:54:07,311 --> 00:54:11,750
I'm cheating on you vibe and you still
felt like a piece of shit by going

876
00:54:11,751 --> 00:54:15,080
through his emails. The, you're a good
person, you're being too hard on yourself.

877
00:54:15,890 --> 00:54:20,870
Um, what he's supposed to
be, you know that person,

878
00:54:20,871 --> 00:54:22,760
a good fellows whose content to be a jerk.

879
00:54:23,630 --> 00:54:26,720
What am I supposed to say that
my boyfriend cheats on me. See,

880
00:54:26,721 --> 00:54:28,220
I switched it up for you.
Anyways,

881
00:54:28,430 --> 00:54:32,480
I read an email he wrote to
his ex girlfriend expressing
his lament about being

882
00:54:32,481 --> 00:54:37,070
with the wrong person. Well, there
you go. It's over game set and match.

883
00:54:38,330 --> 00:54:43,330
It went up and went on about how amazing
she was and how any other girl me would

884
00:54:43,431 --> 00:54:45,500
only ever be second best.

885
00:54:46,370 --> 00:54:50,870
This prompted me to look
through his photos and I
found some recently opened but

886
00:54:51,110 --> 00:54:53,390
only nude pictures of her.

887
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:56,560
This hit me really hard
because unlike regular porn,

888
00:54:56,561 --> 00:55:01,190
nude pictures of xs holds something
sentimental value I don't appreciate or

889
00:55:01,191 --> 00:55:05,420
think it's appropriate. Well that's
about as lightly as you can put it.

890
00:55:06,650 --> 00:55:08,540
Um,
yeah,

891
00:55:08,541 --> 00:55:11,540
you should definitely not appreciate
that he actually knows that woman and

892
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:14,030
banged her.
Uh,

893
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,720
putting myself in this conundrum.

894
00:55:17,990 --> 00:55:21,920
I couldn't bring this sensitive topic up
without admitting I invaded his private

895
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:25,880
invading his privacy.
Although my hunch was right.

896
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:28,640
I know I was wrong and looking
through his personal shit,

897
00:55:28,830 --> 00:55:32,240
but is it wrong of him to still
masturbate to naked pictures of his ex?

898
00:55:32,241 --> 00:55:35,270
Even after he reassured
me he had deleted them?

899
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:40,730
How would I go about talking to him about
this? Or is this situation better left?

900
00:55:40,731 --> 00:55:44,960
Undiscussed now that we are
on better or closer terms,

901
00:55:44,961 --> 00:55:49,910
I appreciate any piece of advice
or opinion greatly. So, uh,

902
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:52,700
go fuck yourself. Question Mark. Uh,

903
00:55:56,050 --> 00:55:56,883
I,
you know,

904
00:55:58,930 --> 00:56:02,350
I wa I can't even fucking answer this.

905
00:56:02,351 --> 00:56:06,520
What he gave you the vibe. Like he
was fucking around on you and he is,

906
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:12,960
he is fucking around on you. And that
whole thing about that. Your, your,

907
00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:17,070
your second best.
Go Fuck Yourself.

908
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:21,780
Fucked that. Break up with
the guy. All right. You know,

909
00:56:21,781 --> 00:56:26,080
what's your biggest problem is,
sweetheart, is you are a sweetheart.

910
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:31,180
And this guy is at the
very least a confused,

911
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:37,870
uh, fight. He's a fucking dirt bag. He's
not being honest with you, okay? Now,

912
00:56:37,871 --> 00:56:42,040
this is the thing about if
you're a sweetheart and life,

913
00:56:42,070 --> 00:56:45,160
male or female,
uh,

914
00:56:45,190 --> 00:56:47,170
pieces of Shit gravitate towards you.

915
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:51,820
They need a sweetheart in their life to
put up with their piece of shit behavior.

916
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:54,100
So what you have to learn to do that.

917
00:56:54,101 --> 00:56:58,690
If you are a sweetheart via big
hearted person, you have to be guarded,

918
00:56:59,710 --> 00:57:00,460
all right?

919
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:04,510
And you have to make somebody's earned
the fact that you're a sweetheart,

920
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:05,950
you just don't give it away.

921
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:07,290
Yeah.

922
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:10,700
All right? Cause when you just given
it away and you fucking Nice Day,

923
00:57:10,701 --> 00:57:14,270
how are you? I just met you. Will you
help me move? Okay? That's a nice,

924
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:16,040
you gonna get,
you're gonna get taken advantage of.

925
00:57:16,730 --> 00:57:21,500
So this guy has taken advantage of you.
Fuck this guy. Break up with them, okay?

926
00:57:22,570 --> 00:57:22,950
Okay.

927
00:57:22,950 --> 00:57:25,650
If he wasn't such a fucking
shifty piece of shit,

928
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,470
you wouldn't have to
done that piece of shit.

929
00:57:27,471 --> 00:57:32,100
Then he basically gave you grounds for
a warrant to go search through his shit.

930
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:35,970
All right. And you were right. Okay.
Although you didn't get a warrant,

931
00:57:35,971 --> 00:57:39,360
you kind of did it like the rogue cop who
now is the throw his badge on the desk

932
00:57:39,361 --> 00:57:43,080
yet still go out and solve the fucking
crime, like all those 80 cop buddy movies.

933
00:57:43,081 --> 00:57:47,580
But you are right. You
deserve better. Fuck this guy.

934
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:48,633
All right.

935
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:49,750
Yeah,

936
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:54,520
you should break up with them even
though it's going to hurt. Um, all right.

937
00:57:54,521 --> 00:57:57,580
So you know what? I think that that's
going to be the podcast for this week.

938
00:57:57,581 --> 00:58:02,080
A little under an hour. I know that's
shorter than what you're used to, but, um,

939
00:58:03,130 --> 00:58:06,190
I gotta I gotta upload this and sent
it to my guy to give to you guys that

940
00:58:06,191 --> 00:58:09,640
you're now listening to.
And by the way, I was on,

941
00:58:09,670 --> 00:58:12,940
did you guys check out breaking bad?
I was on breaking bad last week.

942
00:58:13,770 --> 00:58:18,310
I'll last night and everything. I
didn't get a chance to watch it. Um,

943
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:23,800
but uh, it's always weird watching
yourself anyways, but I love that show.

944
00:58:23,801 --> 00:58:28,120
So I have to, uh, I'm
actually two episodes behind,

945
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:33,190
but, uh, I peeked at my Twitter and I got
nothing but positive things. Thank God.

946
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:35,740
Thank God. So I appreciate everybody's
saying that cause you know,

947
00:58:36,130 --> 00:58:38,590
this is acting stuff is new to me.
All right?

948
00:58:38,591 --> 00:58:42,220
So all the compliments you gave me really
makes up for the fact that you break

949
00:58:42,221 --> 00:58:44,140
my balls about my podcast every week.

950
00:58:44,141 --> 00:58:47,530
So thank you to anybody
who wrote something nice on
Twitter that really made me

951
00:58:47,531 --> 00:58:49,750
feel good and uh,

952
00:58:49,751 --> 00:58:52,750
and go fuck yourself to all the people
who are now going to write mean shit

953
00:58:52,751 --> 00:58:55,910
because it's funny, which it is,
but I don't care. Are the, the,

954
00:58:55,911 --> 00:58:59,350
the honest reviews already came in. So
have at it, have a good time trashing me.

955
00:58:59,351 --> 00:59:03,580
I don't give a fuck. Um, that's the
podcast for this week, by the way.

956

I have a show Wednesday
night, uh, down in Nantucket.

958

There's still tickets left.

959
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:18,960
It's going to be a great show
where I basically perform to a,

960
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:23,480
like fishermen in the fucking Illuminati.

961
00:59:23,481 --> 00:59:27,740
He's going to be a really
interesting mix of people and uh,

962

I'm really excited to go down there.

coast of Massachusetts.

an end? Uh, what do I got?

966
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:46,700
