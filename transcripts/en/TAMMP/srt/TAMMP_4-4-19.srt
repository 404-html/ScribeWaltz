1
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:05,580
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burr and
it's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:05,581 --> 00:00:08,290
Just before Friday. Monday
morning podcast. Yeah.

3
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,670
Oh,

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,910
just checking in on you. I'm checking
in to see. Oh, how's your week going?

5
00:00:17,911 --> 00:00:18,744
You're almost there.

6
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:21,080
Okay.

7
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:25,770
Fucking Thursday, man. You're on the east
coast. It's almost lunchtime. All right.

8
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:28,340
By the time this comes out, it'd be
lunchtime. What are you going to get?

9
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:33,050
You're going to go out and get something
heavy or are you going to start the

10
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:35,810
weekend? Right? Go out
and get something healthy.

11
00:00:35,811 --> 00:00:38,690
Bring the stomach down a little bit. You
feel a little more comfortable, right?

12
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,720
A little more confident and you go out to
the clubs that he buttoned down, shirt.

13
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:45,730
You Belize, not pressing
against it, right? While you're,
yeah, I used to do a bit.

14
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:46,190
My aqua,

15
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:49,280
your buttons are doing like the iron
cross hanging on to both sides of your

16
00:00:49,281 --> 00:00:53,900
shirt. Like, Hey, yeah,
you don't need that.

17
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,460
Okay.

18
00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:00,020
Make life a little easy. Why is this
fucking thing only on one goddamn channel?

19
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:04,190
Oh, I'll figure it out. That's
it. You're not sitting up.

20
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:05,900
The elevator only goes
to the fourth floor.

21
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,590
It's where I am right now with my anger.
No more going to the penthouse. Okay.

22
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:13,220
I've downsized my anger life.

23
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:18,170
I've moved down to a floor that I feel
is just a little more affordable and

24
00:01:18,171 --> 00:01:22,220
everybody can relax the round me,
you know what it is,

25
00:01:22,221 --> 00:01:23,660
is I don't have any time.

26
00:01:23,661 --> 00:01:28,190
I think that that's something I feel like
that triggers me. Bailey, no. Tam Bailey,

27
00:01:28,191 --> 00:01:31,620
no time Nicole and Billy.
No time because you've got no time.

28
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:33,960
Yeah.

29
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,810
You know, my wife knows I don't
have any time. Don't shut a, yeah.

30
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,160
You know I don't have any time,
but what does she do

31
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:47,500
the fuck was it? Was it yelling?
Just set off one of my kids' toys.

32
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:51,220
I like that. It's like a sound
effects. What did I just, Yo,

33
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,300
I'll see if I can make that.
But you're now

34
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:57,340
okay.

35
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:01,990
She's got this one frigging toy.
It's fuck, it's fucking crazy.

36
00:02:01,991 --> 00:02:02,411
I like it.

37
00:02:02,411 --> 00:02:04,840
Cause there's all these different musical
instruments and it teaches the kids

38
00:02:04,841 --> 00:02:07,450
about it,
but I swear to God the guy's energy.

39
00:02:07,451 --> 00:02:09,460
It's like Willie aims and
Charles in charge. You know,

40
00:02:09,461 --> 00:02:11,950
he's like Charles the same thing.

41
00:02:11,951 --> 00:02:16,951
It's like pop and rock up and rock
up and Brooke dig for instruments.

42
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:23,650
It's a Trump. It's like, buddy, relax.

43
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,790
I don't want to hear you
played an instrument when
you're all fucking wound up

44
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:32,410
like that. Now that constipated fucking
sound coming out of your instrument,

45
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,580
miles Davis turning around,
giving you that look on the bandstand.

46
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:38,260
Yeah,

47
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,490
relax a little bit.

48
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:40,700
Okay.

49
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:45,100
Pop and Rock Bob and rock his scooter.

50
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:47,690
Liberal booboo. Is that a trumpet?
Right? You want to live in there?

51
00:02:47,691 --> 00:02:50,480
I'm not a musical guy.
The fuck you goddamn comedian.

52
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,120
Speaking of which I want to thank
Madison Square Garden for a,

53
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,870
an Rory Rose Garden for having
me on the garden dreams.

54
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:04,100
And um, this is really great. Um,

55
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:07,910
charity where they basically,
you know, underprivileged kids,

56
00:03:07,911 --> 00:03:09,110
kids who were sick and all that,

57
00:03:09,111 --> 00:03:11,660
they got a dream and they come out and
they make it. They make it come true.

58
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,170
It was really nice. He was funny. As
I was doing the, uh, the press there,

59
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:20,570
I was doing the press and I'm, Jeffrey
Gurian was in, I always fuck with him.

60
00:03:20,571 --> 00:03:25,280
I always have a great time with him.
But, uh, one of the ladies in lines like,

61
00:03:25,281 --> 00:03:27,700
do you know what this, you know what
this charity is about? You don't,

62
00:03:27,701 --> 00:03:29,600
and I just seen some kid,
you know,

63
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,370
in a wheelchair kid on a walker or
whatever, and it's just like, Oh God,

64
00:03:34,371 --> 00:03:37,490
do you know what this charity is? Forest?
I just was like, no, no, I don't. No,

65
00:03:37,491 --> 00:03:39,560
I don't.
So I'm going to come off like an asshole.

66
00:03:39,561 --> 00:03:41,990
But the reason why I said that was
because I really didn't feel like talking

67
00:03:41,991 --> 00:03:46,010
about it. You know, once you have
like a kid, it's just, it affects you.

68
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,310
Like you could have something to apply it
to where before it was like, oh my God,

69
00:03:49,311 --> 00:03:52,790
it felt bad for that. And I'm just
like, I felt the whole fucking thing.

70
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:57,260
The parents, the whole thing.
Tell us about the charity.

71
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:02,180
Can you cut through the emotion
of it? Ah, no, no. I won't be,

72
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,090
I don't know what it is.
It's Madison Square Garden.

73
00:04:05,091 --> 00:04:06,650
They asked me to come on here.
So why don't we say go on.

74
00:04:06,651 --> 00:04:11,651
And I do the show fucking
monster lineup of a,

75
00:04:12,111 --> 00:04:15,720
of comics. Everybody fucking
killed. Fortunately, um,

76
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,340
I went on during the middle.
Seinfeld had to close it out.

77
00:04:19,341 --> 00:04:24,020
John Stewart went on a second
to last and, uh, Michael Change,

78
00:04:24,021 --> 00:04:28,730
Jesus Christ, he came in fucking
murdered, came into from SNL,

79
00:04:28,731 --> 00:04:32,840
still at his jacket on, just
walked on stage. Fucking murders,

80
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,370
leaves a fucking joke assassin.

81
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,790
Uh, who else was on it? Um,

82
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,130
John Malaney.

83
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:44,270
Yeah.

84
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:48,380
Fucking murdering lies a
Schlesinger murdered Brian Regan.

85
00:04:48,381 --> 00:04:50,870
Brian was how big the
show Brian Regan opened.

86
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,060
That's how fucking amazing the
show us. Um, so I was happy.

87
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,630
[inaudible] I forgot somebody. I know.
I did. I know there was more than that.

88
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,200
Who else was on it? Come on, Bill.

89
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,060
Think I don't fucking know.

90
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,473
Okay.

91
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:11,200
Steve Surepost hosted the thing,
uh,

92
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,280
one of the crew guys at Madison Square
Garden. His name was, um, you know,

93
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:17,920
it was cool. And we were going through
the bowels of the place going over to the,

94
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,300
uh, the theater at Madison Square
Garden where Eddie Murphy recorded Ra.

95
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,690
I always think about that
when I was there. And, uh,

96
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:27,460
when I'm there and we were going through,

97
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:31,180
we had to go up the elevator and they
had all the Ottawa senators like hockey

98
00:05:31,181 --> 00:05:35,200
bags. They were loading them in cause
the rangers were playing, playing.

99
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:37,030
Then the next night and lo and behold,

100
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:42,160
the next night I'm back in La Cause I got
up at 4:00 AM to get back to my lovely

101
00:05:42,161 --> 00:05:45,100
wife and kid as you do as a dad.
It's

102
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,310
not about you anymore.
You've worked out the depth chart.

103
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,440
What do you think you're going to get
some sleep? Their dad don't think so.

104
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:56,020
Ain't no time.
No time.

105
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:00,790
MMM.
I got on the fucking plane,

106
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:04,990
flew back here and then I
ended up watching like a
period and a half of the game

107
00:06:04,991 --> 00:06:07,330
and lo and behold, they cut to the, uh,

108
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:11,260
they cut to some highlights from the
garden. Got In. It didn't show the show.

109
00:06:11,261 --> 00:06:15,400
Thank Christ. Um, that was a little
rusty. I'm not going to lie to you.

110
00:06:15,401 --> 00:06:19,720
I hadn't done much standup up by, I
have to, I did the, uh, did my special,

111
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,930
I was like, I'm going to take some
time for me. You know what I mean?

112
00:06:22,931 --> 00:06:27,520
Put my feet up and just thought of
just what it was, that fucking word,

113
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:30,400
those kinds of people use that regroup.

114
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:31,750
Okay.

115
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:36,520
Just allow myself to
just realign my synopsis.

116
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:37,810
Okay.

117
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:41,080
No, I just didn't feel like going out or
anything and I was, I was fucking, yeah.

118
00:06:41,081 --> 00:06:42,490
Wiped out.
And uh,

119
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:47,470
I felt like a fighter that didn't spar,
you know,

120
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:53,120
just be like, man, I'm the
champ. I got the belt right.
I just knocked out, you know,

121
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:56,570
my last set was my, uh, my standup
special. Fucking knock that out.

122
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:59,420
I'm going to fucking champ over
here and I got the old right there,

123
00:06:59,421 --> 00:07:02,390
Fred the second I walked out there. So I
meandered a little bit in the beginning.

124
00:07:02,391 --> 00:07:07,160
Then I got to go and, and uh, oh my
God, this fucking hilarious moment.

125
00:07:07,161 --> 00:07:08,680
My set where,
you know,

126
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:12,350
I was making fun of Michelle
Obama because how do you not,

127
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:13,290
yeah.

128
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:16,230
You know what I mean? The level that
she's been gassed up to. Oh yeah.

129
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,590
She's the president's wife.
All right. Let everybody relax.

130
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:23,520
Okay.

131
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,960
Um, that was basically my
angle. So, you know, you know,
you know, fucking, you know,

132
00:07:27,961 --> 00:07:29,880
all the women are going to
fucking lose their minds,

133
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:34,800
especially white women who also don't
have jobs. You know, they get, you know,

134
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:38,370
who are, you know, it was a lot of rich
people there. Right. So I was a, you know,

135
00:07:38,371 --> 00:07:41,220
I was pushing their buttons. Yeah.
I mean, in fairness, the audience,

136
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,960
I was being a cunt
and I was saying,

137
00:07:44,961 --> 00:07:46,430
you know how being a first lady,

138
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:50,210
it's not a job that extending standing
what all the excitements about,

139
00:07:50,211 --> 00:07:54,190
it's not a job. Right. And the
hey those guys. Yes, it is. It is.

140
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,040
So I keep setting off that toy.
Um,

141
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:06,170
so I say, I just thought, you know,
I can't see into the crowd. Right.

142
00:08:06,171 --> 00:08:09,080
So I just look into the
blackness of like the 10th row,

143
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:13,390
this voice that I just said. I'm like,
do you think it's the Jami? It's, yeah.

144
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:17,840
I'm like, all right, ma'am,
I'm going to do me a favor.

145
00:08:17,841 --> 00:08:22,100
You tell me how the fuck that's a job.
And the woman goes,

146
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:26,210
first of all, it third turned
out it was a dude. Right.

147
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:34,580
So then immediately you feel like
this fucking post me to tension.

148
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:38,960
He a gender neutral bathroom,
all his fucking energy.
And I just went like, well,

149
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:42,770
you know, guy tell you you got a high
pitched voice. You sound like a woman.

150
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:49,260
I, you know something. I was
really not enjoying this time.

151
00:08:49,261 --> 00:08:52,320
And now I've realized that this is
one of the greatest times ever to be a

152
00:08:52,321 --> 00:08:55,510
fucking comedian.
The amount of fun that you have,

153
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,060
and there was not,
you know,

154
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:02,710
you sound like a woman and you know
what the nowadays is just say, well,

155
00:09:02,711 --> 00:09:05,980
what is a woman's sound like?
You know what a woman's sounds like?

156
00:09:05,981 --> 00:09:10,060
You know what a guy sounds like,
you know the base fucking thing.

157
00:09:10,061 --> 00:09:11,530
I hate when people do that.

158
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,360
They'll remember during the Oj trial when
that guy said it sounded like a black

159
00:09:16,361 --> 00:09:18,520
guy. He never, he's like, what does
a black guy said? You know what?

160
00:09:18,521 --> 00:09:23,110
The fucking black, what is an Irish
guy sound like? What does a German guy,

161
00:09:23,111 --> 00:09:26,920
what does a French guy sound like?
There's accents.

162
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:32,050
Not saying everybody sounds like that.
You know what I mean?

163
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,160
But if you met a black guy going like,
oh,

164
00:09:36,161 --> 00:09:39,010
how are you a top of the morning
[inaudible] you'd be like,

165
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:40,330
this guy is fucking with me.

166
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:44,890
But because it's trial and somebody

167
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:50,770
you have to take into consideration
that this might be the anomaly.

168
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,730
Now I understand that. But to say
that somebody saying, you know,

169
00:09:54,731 --> 00:09:58,270
that sounded like an Asian dude,
that there's something like fucking,

170
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:01,960
I dunno clannish about that.
I guess there could be,

171
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,920
speaking of that where it tell you one
time I was in San Francisco, right?

172
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:11,320
Visiting the bath houses. Um, and uh,

173
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,670
I got into a cab.

174
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:14,050
Okay.

175
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:15,850
And this Asian dude was driving.

176
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:17,320
Okay.

177
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:21,580
And he had the, he sounded
like he was on fucking, he hot.

178
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:22,530
Okay.

179
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:25,710
So there is always that exception. I
swear to God, straight up Asian Dude.

180
00:10:25,711 --> 00:10:29,670
And he was just going like,
man, I'm obtain. There's
traffic out hairs. Ridiculous.

181
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:34,610
And I'm looking at the dude, man, it's
this guy fucking with me. Hi, I'm alone.

182
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:39,570
Y'All gone be out here in San Francisco.
Okay. And I was just like, dude,

183
00:10:39,571 --> 00:10:42,660
I got to ask where the fuck are you
from? And he laughed. He's like, man,

184
00:10:42,661 --> 00:10:43,860
I grew up in Tennessee.

185
00:10:43,861 --> 00:10:47,700
I know it's fucked up to hear me
talking like this bowl where I grew up,

186
00:10:47,701 --> 00:10:48,720
everybody dead.

187
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:53,230
Then he started telling me how he did
all this extra work and how he was an

188
00:10:53,231 --> 00:10:57,130
extra and cleaning clean Eastwood's uh,
one of those dirty Harry movies.

189
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,240
And I got his phone number and now bags
when I was back on Opie and Anthony,

190
00:11:01,241 --> 00:11:05,930
I was like, oh my God, we got to
get this guy on the show. MMM.

191
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:09,350
So there is an exception,
but I mean it's all but this also,

192
00:11:09,351 --> 00:11:11,450
that's not a reason to,
uh,

193
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:12,690
okay.

194
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:15,060
What are the kids call it
now you've been canceled,

195
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:24,330
um,
you sound Latino.

196
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,390
Just exactly.
What does that mean?

197
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:31,570
Did I tell you that time I was going
to Charlie Murphy's funeral and I, I,

198
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,710
I had packed hastily.
You know what I mean?

199
00:11:34,711 --> 00:11:36,600
Cause you never know when
someone's going to pass away.

200
00:11:36,601 --> 00:11:38,610
All of a sudden it's like,
shit, we gotta go. So I, I,

201
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,740
and I forgot to pack my underwears there.

202
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:45,810
So where I was staying in New York was,
uh,

203
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:49,830
head become the gay part
of town, right. And, uh,

204
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,230
because it didn't use to be gay,
used to be fucking shady,

205
00:11:52,231 --> 00:11:54,620
and then all the gay moved in,
and then, you know, what happens?

206
00:11:54,621 --> 00:11:57,410
All of a sudden this nice restaurants,
there's a nightlife,

207
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,970
there's fucking mood lighting.

208
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,510
It's, it's, it's awesome, right?

209
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:05,970
So right across the street from where
I was staying was this clothing store,

210
00:12:05,971 --> 00:12:08,610
and I'm not going to lie to you,
you know, in the fucking windows.

211
00:12:08,611 --> 00:12:10,290
They definitely had like the,

212
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:14,460
the mannequin with the leather underwear
in the hat. But I mean, I had to go,

213
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:17,010
but I saw they had other
fucking tee shirts in there.

214
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,850
So I went in there trying
to find some onto west.

215
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:23,610
I figured that was just like an aisle,
right? The dog collar, gimp aisle. Right.

216
00:12:23,611 --> 00:12:25,320
So I go into this fucking place.

217
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:26,740
Yeah.

218
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:29,590
And I'm trying to find underwear and
all that. God is like the fucking under,

219
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:34,660
like I finally find an underwear
cut that I can wear to a funeral.

220
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:41,050
All right? Rather than wearing the,
uh, Greg Louganis goes to Brazil,

221
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:43,960
fucking cut, right. So, okay,

222
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:47,970
I finally find the cut and then on,
on, I know I've told this story before,

223
00:12:47,971 --> 00:12:49,050
but there's always new listeners,

224
00:12:49,051 --> 00:12:53,180
right on the waistband it said nasty pig,

225
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,550
you know, in, in the funeral,
you know, the, the, the,

226
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,860
the service is like
fucking 90 minutes away.

227
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:01,170
It's out in Jersey and in
time is becoming an issue.

228
00:13:01,171 --> 00:13:04,920
So I walk up to the counter and there's
this dude standing there talking to the

229
00:13:04,921 --> 00:13:08,280
person behind the register and I kind
of interrupted. I was, excuse me,

230
00:13:08,281 --> 00:13:10,560
I don't mean to interrupt. I
go, do you have any like, uh,

231
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,780
like mainstream underwear?

232
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:18,260
That's what I said.
Do you have any mainstream underwear?

233
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:23,750
And the guy got offended.
He's like, define mainstream.

234
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:25,933
I just stayed in the

235
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:30,520
pocket. I was like, Oh, I dunno it, it
doesn't say nasty pig on, on, on the waist

236
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,870
band.
And then he had nothing.

237
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,680
He was trying to do that, like, you know,

238
00:13:36,681 --> 00:13:39,830
trying to make me out to
be like homophobic. Okay.

239
00:13:39,831 --> 00:13:44,480
Fucking come over to my wife off the road
with underwear that says nasty pig on

240
00:13:44,481 --> 00:13:48,890
it, honey. I swear to God,

241
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,460
I was going to a funeral and I,

242
00:13:52,461 --> 00:13:54,290
I need some underwear.

243
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:59,140
There was a glitch. They had his
blow. Right. Oh, set. I'm Gus Grissom,

244
00:13:59,141 --> 00:14:00,300
a fucking underwear.

245
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:05,240
Anyways,
um,

246
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:10,730
so that ended up being a lot of fun.
And I finished my set and I said,

247
00:14:10,731 --> 00:14:14,660
thank you God bless everybody. Including
you sir, with your high pitched voice.

248
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,850
I guess I was a bit of a cut, but
um, so last night, right. And I,

249
00:14:18,851 --> 00:14:22,230
and I really did not
like that feeling of um,

250
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:23,610
okay.

251
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:27,450
Being like rusty or whatever. So
I mean already look rusty. Hey,

252
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:31,350
I remember Rusty Jones.
Hello. Goodbye. Hello Russ.

253
00:14:31,351 --> 00:14:36,330
Did Jones good by rusty cars know,

254
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:42,160
just be able to make a living doing that.
Writing jingles. Eight second songs.

255
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,680
I'm a pamper. He's a pair of
shoes. A pep where a pair,

256
00:14:46,681 --> 00:14:50,220
but wouldn't you like to be a
pepper to be a pepper Drake?

257
00:14:50,221 --> 00:14:55,221
Dr Pepper Bam House in the
Hollywood hills whores by the pool.

258
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:58,050
Cocaine on the piano

259
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,590
stays are all gone. I said,
the second you make it,

260
00:15:03,591 --> 00:15:07,430
somebody takes it on the Internet
and then they do a mashup. Right.

261
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:11,720
With the fucking, I
dunno, the Coca Cola song,

262
00:15:11,721 --> 00:15:13,100
I don't know how to fucking works anymore.

263
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,453
Okay.

264
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:18,900
That was a job when I was growing up.
You'd have a,

265
00:15:18,901 --> 00:15:21,000
you'd have a party and that there
would be somebody at your house.

266
00:15:21,001 --> 00:15:24,420
One guy was a milkman and another
person wrote jingles for commercials.

267
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,590
I then there was always somebody in
actuaries to sizing everybody up,

268
00:15:28,591 --> 00:15:31,170
trying to figure out when
you're going to die. Oh,

269
00:15:31,171 --> 00:15:36,171
he's already a 22 pounds overweight
for as far as my visual estimate goes,

270
00:15:36,241 --> 00:15:40,950
and that is a second
helping of cream of spinach.

271
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,320
I can't be good for the arteries.

272
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:48,630
I'm going to want to say that guy's
going to tip out around 57 it was a

273
00:15:48,631 --> 00:15:52,350
dangerous age when I was growing up.
57 you know,

274
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,870
that's when you were in the red
zone of having a heart attack.

275
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:59,871
57 fucking 63 61 a lot
of guys dropped at 61

276
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,313
mmm.

277
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,960
Which didn't seem like a big
deal when I was like five, six

278
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,253
you know,

279
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:12,920
fucking guy was born in like the 19
early 19 hundreds he had a great run.

280
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:18,320
Right? Okay. I was alive when
Babe Ruth, this was in shape.

281
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:23,990
But when you all of a sudden you have 50
staring down the barrel of 51 in June.

282
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,790
Oh my God. Oh my God. I was a, I want,

283
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:33,320
so I go to the airport, right? Like pick
up 10 to five is what it actually was.

284
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:37,340
Right. And I get to the airport like
five 30 crews right out to fucking JFK.

285
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:42,830
All right. I got my, I got my ticket on my
cell phone. All right. I'm a modern man.

286
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,190
I'm not checking any bags.
I'm a little fucking Mr Technology.

287
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:50,150
So I'm precheck Tsa, right? I
fucking go through that shit.

288
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,830
And I got my ticket and I just fucking,
I go,

289
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,470
I just put my phone down
to the thing and I, and I,

290
00:16:55,471 --> 00:16:58,260
I set it down on the thing and
I, on my cell phone case, I got,

291
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,400
I got this cluster of pictures of
me and my lovely daughter, right?

292
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,400
So I set it down and you know,
there's a woman there, so you know,

293
00:17:04,401 --> 00:17:06,410
they can't resist the kid.
She sees it. She just goes,

294
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:07,773
oh,

295
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:11,260
I go, yeah, isn't she a
beauty? And she goes, yeah,

296
00:17:11,261 --> 00:17:12,940
she goes to set your granddaughter.

297
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:15,270
Ah,

298
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:22,000
Oh, did that hurt? And I laughed.
I said, no, it's my daughter.

299
00:17:22,001 --> 00:17:25,300
I go, I got a late start. Oh.

300
00:17:25,301 --> 00:17:28,120
And then I just limped
through fucking security.

301
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:31,150
I had such a fucking spring in my step.
I'm Mike,

302
00:17:31,151 --> 00:17:35,020
I haven't boozed kind of 130 days.
Right.

303
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:39,370
My skin's clearing up. Oh, I'm
drinking fucking smoothies.

304
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:46,180
I'm looking younger than den. My years in
sheesh. Oh my. She just said, she sent me,

305
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:49,750
she fucking s fucking strapped me in

306
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,840
right on top of the rocket.

307
00:17:52,841 --> 00:17:56,710
Just shot me right back to the reality
of my fucking age, man. Oh man,

308
00:17:56,711 --> 00:17:57,544
that that killed me.

309
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,010
Okay,

310
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:00,420
fucking kill me.
I'm not gonna lie to you.

311
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,780
I thought I'd tell this story and
then have a joke at the end of it,

312
00:18:03,781 --> 00:18:07,080
but all I have is just the raw emotion
of that, that really fucking hurt.

313
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:11,730
You know, see, see, you go
ladies there, there's a pressure.

314
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:15,960
There's this stigma when you're a bald,

315
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:20,840
redheaded male. Granted, but the
reality is is I am, I am old. I am.

316
00:18:20,841 --> 00:18:22,270
If I had a kid at 25,

317
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:26,140
my kid would be coming up on 26 and if
my kid had a kid about the same time I

318
00:18:26,141 --> 00:18:29,770
did, then fuck it. I would, I would be
old enough to be a grandfather. See,

319
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,450
so I'm not going to get mad at her.

320
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:36,400
I'm not going to write
tsa.com and be like,

321
00:18:36,401 --> 00:18:41,401
I was so triggered when somebody
stated a fact about my age.

322
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:49,110
You know what? I'm going to take it.
I'm going to do good luck with book. Um,

323
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:53,680
what did I want to talk about here?
Oh, I got so much. Not so much shit.

324
00:18:53,681 --> 00:18:58,240
I got a couple emails to these fucking
F1 snobs because I was talking about how

325
00:18:58,241 --> 00:19:01,550
ruining for Ferrari's, like rooting
for the, uh, the Kansas city chiefs,

326
00:19:01,551 --> 00:19:04,810
and it was painting them as an underdog.
Now, even though I clearly stated that,

327
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:07,210
I just started watching like
fucking three, four years ago,

328
00:19:07,211 --> 00:19:08,770
Ferrari has not been doing well.

329
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:10,150
Okay.

330
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:14,080
All right. Second place, eh? Yeah.
That's your, you're the first loser.

331
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:17,200
So what I said was accurate
and it shouldn't hear it.

332
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:22,620
Talking down to this father who looks
like a grandfather talking down to me,

333
00:19:23,081 --> 00:19:25,360
this person who has
difficulty reading out loud,

334
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:29,590
talking down to me the
hero of this podcast,

335
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,350
the greatest person on this
podcast right now is me.

336
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:35,250
Okay.

337
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,800
And it's not because I'm,
I'm the only voice.

338
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:42,060
It's because I'm the only one who votes.
Um,

339
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,920
yeah, giving me shit. Like I
didn't understand that Ferrari is,

340
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:51,090
I know what a Ferrari is. You fucking
morons. Everybody knows what a furry is.

341
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:54,900
I know their history. I actually
read a, I read this book called, uh,

342
00:19:54,901 --> 00:19:59,130
the limit about the first
F1 American f one champion.

343
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:02,880
One of the great fucking books I ever
read. I wish I didn't give it away.

344
00:20:02,881 --> 00:20:05,370
I always give away the books.
Um,

345
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:09,950
absolutely fucking love that book
and I understand. I understand. Okay.

346
00:20:09,951 --> 00:20:14,270
I know where it's at. All right. I'm just
saying the last couple of years, I mean,

347
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:17,810
ever since I've been watching
this sports since like 2015, 2016,

348
00:20:17,811 --> 00:20:20,750
whenever the fuck I started,
it's just been Mercedes.

349
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:22,270
Okay.

350
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:23,560
All right. I'm getting
sick of it. Or you know,

351
00:20:23,561 --> 00:20:25,210
the same way you guys
are sick of the Patriots.

352
00:20:25,211 --> 00:20:29,440
I would like to see Ferrari make a
run. Although since then I did see, uh,

353
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:33,590
that new guy, John, what's his face
there? The, the, the uh, the new drivers,

354
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:37,120
not Kimmy raking it in the new, the new
guy, a driving for Ferrari. He's like, ah,

355
00:20:37,121 --> 00:20:38,080
man, you know. Well,

356
00:20:38,081 --> 00:20:42,070
I guess we got lucky that the safety
car came out and he was really positive

357
00:20:42,071 --> 00:20:46,810
about it and that made me,
that gave me some hope.

358
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,930
It gave me some hope.
By the way,

359
00:20:49,931 --> 00:20:53,860
we're going to have a fucking benefit
for fucking Daniel Ricardo yet, you know,

360
00:20:53,861 --> 00:20:55,300
they're always doing standup benefits.

361
00:20:55,301 --> 00:20:58,150
I want to do a standup benefit to get
that guy a fucking team that can give them

362
00:20:58,151 --> 00:21:02,410
a car that's going to be able to finish
the fucking race, that poor bastard.

363
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:06,760
I swear to God,
if they take the smile away from that man,

364
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,440
you know, that's really going
to be a difficult fucking

365
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:17,000
thing to watch somebody so young,
so full of life,

366
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:22,040
you know, twinkle in his eye. How many
fucking times can you just be driving,

367
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:26,240
crushing it and all of a sudden
your car just shuts off, you know?

368
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:29,720
Or for some reason somebody puts
a mogul in the God damn grass.

369
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:34,040
You try not to get side swiped when you
go over just to Cantera under the grass

370
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:36,620
in the front of your car,
fucking explodes. I don't get it.

371
00:21:36,621 --> 00:21:40,100
The guy's fucking snake.
Bitch, snake, bitch. Snake bit.

372
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,800
Sorry. Oh, so I finally, I saw the, uh,

373
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,710
did I tell you guys, I saw the, uh,

374
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:53,190
I saw the moto GP from Argentina.
Um,

375
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,250
I got a lot of questions.
All right.

376
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,590
Is I take a sip of a green smoothie.

377
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:00,730
Okay.

378
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:04,000
A green smoothie, guys want a good
recipe for a smoothie. Green smoothie.

379
00:22:04,001 --> 00:22:08,170
Here it is,
a cup of Ice Cup of almond milk.

380
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:11,950
Sorry. Starting over
again. Quarter Cup of ice,

381
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:17,630
Cup of almond milk,
a banana,

382
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:23,220
a cup of spinach,
a cup of all that.

383
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:27,250
I mean on a cup of a, uh, a
tablespoon of all natural honey.

384
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:32,640
Two tablespoon of a instant oatmeal
and one tablespoon of almond butter.

385
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:38,230
Just try to get all natural everything.
And this is how I do it.

386
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:40,330
I put the ice,

387
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:46,230
the almond milk and the spinach in first
and then maybe like some of the honey

388
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:50,440
because what happens is,
you know, the way you do it,

389
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,260
like sometimes it can turn into
like a shake if this too much ice,

390
00:22:53,261 --> 00:22:56,500
but there's not enough ice in here.
Then I blend that. Then I put the paint,

391
00:22:56,501 --> 00:23:01,150
I put the banana in there
first and then I put in the uh,

392
00:23:01,151 --> 00:23:03,970
the peanut butter, knocked the oats
and then the peanut butter or whatever.

393
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:08,110
And that way it stays on top of the
banana and it doesn't sink all the way

394
00:23:08,111 --> 00:23:11,710
fucking down cause it's, it's really
the peanut butter and the honey.

395
00:23:11,711 --> 00:23:14,350
It's going to stick down to the bottom
and it won't be part of the fucking mix.

396
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:17,560
So however I just said that,

397
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:21,400
don't put the honey in where I said that
flipped the oats and the honey and mix

398
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:24,500
it up that way and you should be.
And I do like to two separate Mexicans.

399
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,280
Yeah,

400
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,970
there you go. Drink that
fucker. Drink your breakfast.

401
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:35,580
Be a champion. Be like a dad.
Looks like a grandfather.

402
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:38,220
Oh God. That fucking killed me. You know,

403
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:43,650
I swear to God just for men actually
gave a shit about men with red beard's.

404
00:23:43,651 --> 00:23:44,940
I would have gone out and bought some,

405
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:48,350
like if they was selling it on the
plane and I would've been quite quietly

406
00:23:48,351 --> 00:23:50,630
crying to myself as I
combed in into my chin.

407
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:57,110
All right,

408
00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:02,600
here's my question about the moto GP.
I don't get what the fuck is with mark.

409
00:24:02,601 --> 00:24:06,100
Mark has his fucking motorcycle where
it's just, they even called it, you know,

410
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:08,600
he might just take off and
this could be a boring race.

411
00:24:08,601 --> 00:24:09,860
And then the guy quickly correct himself,

412
00:24:09,861 --> 00:24:11,780
not saying that it's going to be boring.
The guy just fucking,

413
00:24:11,781 --> 00:24:14,030
he got a good start and
he got out front end.

414
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:19,280
He had like a fucking 15 second lead
by the middle of the race or something.

415
00:24:19,281 --> 00:24:20,180
Some crazy.

416
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:24,530
I don't understand why his
bike is so much faster.

417
00:24:24,531 --> 00:24:29,531
I thought that the Ducati's and the do
caddies were all unlike the same level,

418
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:33,240
but he just pulled away like,
you know,

419
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:38,930
he had the IROC Z and everybody else
had the rally sport or the Berlinetta,

420
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:42,960
you know, the Firebird versus
the Trans am I've, I've,

421
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:46,890
it's the exact opposite of [inaudible].
So then the whole fucking race,

422
00:24:46,891 --> 00:24:51,570
the exciting part of the race was
watching a du Fitsi also. And, um,

423
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:56,340
uh, Valentino Rossi battling
for second place and he would,

424
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:59,220
Mark Marquez was so far out into the front

425
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:04,280
that they just had them in a little square
on the upper right hand side of the,

426
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:05,081
of,
of the uh,

427
00:25:05,081 --> 00:25:09,220
my computer screen here while we just
watched everybody else battle and I don't

428
00:25:09,221 --> 00:25:11,320
understand what happened
to or Halo Renzo did.

429
00:25:11,321 --> 00:25:15,250
He pushed the wrong button cause
he's also drive riding a Honda.

430
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:16,990
Okay.

431
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:21,430
And then they were all bitching about the
visio zone is little aerodynamic thing

432
00:25:21,431 --> 00:25:26,050
that cooled off his back tire. They
thought that was a ridiculous advantage.

433
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:27,460
Okay.

434
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,350
And then the very next race,
all of a sudden this guy,

435
00:25:29,351 --> 00:25:32,200
you know mark mark has just
takes off and it's, it fits.

436
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:34,600
He also still has that thing.
Cool. And his back tire,

437
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:38,110
I guess what they should have done because
they were so busy fucking with each

438
00:25:38,111 --> 00:25:40,390
other trying to pass each other racing.

439
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:44,350
What they should have done is just
accepted that the visio so wasn't second.

440
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:46,480
They all got in behind each other

441
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:52,490
like the Peloton and is that I said in
bike racing and eventually they would cut

442
00:25:52,491 --> 00:25:55,610
through the wind and catch up with the
guy and then once they caught up with

443
00:25:55,611 --> 00:25:57,680
them, then it can be like, all
right, let's start racing again.

444
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,980
Is that legal to do that,
to actually become a team,

445
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:05,750
to catch the fucking guy who was already
eight seconds in front of you? I Dunno.

446
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:09,380
And then lastly, uh, cow
crutch. Lowe says name.

447
00:26:09,381 --> 00:26:13,960
He got fucked on that race.
He got fucked. All right.

448
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:17,050
He had an incredible fucking
start and to the naked eye,

449
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:22,000
he didn't start too soon. And the fact
that there's a God damn computer now,

450
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:27,430
like people's brains are not as good as
a fucking computer. Can't see that thing.

451
00:26:27,431 --> 00:26:30,400
So he doesn't know he's cheating. He just
started, he got a good fucking start.

452
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:34,870
Hey. Oh Man, they fuck that guy over.
They fucked him over. All right,

453
00:26:34,871 --> 00:26:37,000
so there you go. There's, there's
my little motorcycle talking.

454
00:26:37,001 --> 00:26:38,140
I'm going to read some advertising.

455
00:26:38,141 --> 00:26:42,520
And then I'm going to wrap this fucking
podcast up and I'm going to get on with

456
00:26:42,521 --> 00:26:46,050
my, my busy day here. All
right. Oh, here we go.

457
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:51,240
[inaudible] don't dupe me undies. Mandy's
Bailey is old in gray, dude. Dude, dude,

458
00:26:51,241 --> 00:26:54,930
dude, me undies, me undies.
That's what the lady say.

459
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,050
You have a beautiful
fucking grand daughter.

460
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,650
That's not my granddaughter.
I nothing rhymes with daughter.

461
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,700
I'm too fucking old to
make it sound fucking work.

462
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:10,710
Somebody get me a Gera Gella tool
and some soft fucking underwears.

463
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:15,060
Okay.
Buzzfeed said this about me undies.

464
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:17,790
They feel like actual
heaven against your skin.

465
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,900
We're going to assume heaven
is really soft in this context.

466
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:27,480
Well don't you pay bud buzzfeed or do
they just review shit? I don't ask men.

467
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:30,630
Well isn't that a nice magazine?

468
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:33,540
I'd like to be asked things
feel like I'm being heard.

469
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:36,870
Askmen said they feel like
silk drenched in hand.

470
00:27:36,871 --> 00:27:39,050
Lotion grubs.

471
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:41,950
Okay.

472
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:45,700
Silt trenching. Hand like I know
hand lotion makes your hands soft.

473
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:48,640
And I know silk is soft,
so if you combine both of those,

474
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:53,290
but you also jerk off with lotion and if
you to, if you put that on the fabric,

475
00:27:53,291 --> 00:27:57,100
now the fabric is wet and it's going to
be sticking to your balls. All right?

476
00:27:57,101 --> 00:27:58,420
This is why you don't ask men.
Thanks.

477
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:05,140
These Andries are so soft, they make Bob
Ross's voice. Sound like Gilbert Godfrey.

478
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:09,820
They are so soft that Kenny g thinks
about them to get inspired to write his

479
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:12,760
next song.
Kenny g taking a hit there.

480
00:28:12,761 --> 00:28:15,070
What did Kenny Dope me undies uses?

481
00:28:15,071 --> 00:28:20,071
The coveted micro modal modal fabric
that is a full three times softer than

482
00:28:20,171 --> 00:28:24,580
cotton. Take that big cotton.
Your big puffy. Oh yeah.

483
00:28:24,581 --> 00:28:27,490
And cotton's also white to you.
Fabric.

484
00:28:27,491 --> 00:28:32,410
Toxicity fabric. Patriotical
cunt. Speaking of Prince,

485
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:36,400
why not match your bottom half with your
better half and get a matching prince

486
00:28:36,401 --> 00:28:39,700
for you and your partner?
Uh, me undies is also,

00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:50,890

nasty pig too on the other one. Uh,

489
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:55,710

softest loungewear on this side of the

m U. N. D. I. E. S.

498
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,410
It's like the me too thing,
except it says undies.

499
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:32,780
Yeah.

500
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:37,340
Hashtag me undies. All right. Butcher
box everybody. Ah, here we go.

501
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:42,460
Butcher box delivers
healthy 100% grass fed,

502
00:29:42,461 --> 00:29:47,110
grass finished beef free range,
organic chicken and heritage breed pork.

503
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:51,130
Did you guys see a Naipaul
gutsy special yet? Uh,

504
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:54,850
the Tennessee kid. Fuck
guys. Absolutely brilliant.

505
00:29:54,851 --> 00:29:59,200
He has a great bit on free range
chickens versus the ones that they, uh,

506
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:03,680
that were not free to range. Uh, it's
on Netflix streaming. Now look at that.

507
00:30:03,681 --> 00:30:07,220
It's an ad within an ad. The incredible
quality of butcher box meets.

508
00:30:07,221 --> 00:30:12,050
Start with the commitment to raising
animals humanely and free of antibiotics

509
00:30:12,051 --> 00:30:15,680
and hormones. Cook with the peace of
mind knowing you are eating healthy,

510
00:30:15,681 --> 00:30:20,120
high quality meat. Each box comes with
at least eight to 11 pounds of meat,

511
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:25,250
which is enough for 24
individual size meals. If you're
a city slicker, but a few,

512
00:30:25,251 --> 00:30:27,140
some big fast boat province,

513
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:34,490
you can choose some five different boxes.
All beef ladies,

514
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:38,930
beef and chicken,
beef and pork mixed box for you.

515
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:43,610
Progressive People.
Custom box lets you choose your own cuts.

516
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,560
That's for the conservative.
You know,

517
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:50,480
that's for the people who want to keep
their meat separate once via will only

518
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:52,850
take ds.
They are the ideas that he meets.

519
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:57,820
My favorite cut of meat is the
heritage breeds pork. Oh Man.

520
00:30:57,821 --> 00:31:02,710
And I can have a fucking recipe. I
was at the airport there. Oh, grant,

521
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:07,080
grandfather burner here and
Grandpa [inaudible] and I was uh,

522
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,161
it was,

523
00:31:08,161 --> 00:31:11,130
it was basically showing how you can
make all these meals and just one pot.

524
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:11,850
You know what I mean?

525
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:14,430
You know those great fucking things that
comfort food that's going to make you

526
00:31:14,431 --> 00:31:16,930
fucking blow up.
I got a good one for pork chops.

527
00:31:16,931 --> 00:31:19,410
Then I'm going to try this
weekend. Oh, I can't wait.

528
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:23,820
I really am like a grandfather.
I'm excited about cooking
pork chops. All right.

529
00:31:23,821 --> 00:31:27,660
This month, butcher box is offering the
unlimited breakfast breakfast bundle.

530
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,790
What is this?
This includes two packages,

531
00:31:29,791 --> 00:31:34,290
a bacon and two pounds of
breakfast sausages all for free,

532
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:38,790
and your first box. Our Bacon is
the best bacon you've ever had.

533
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:43,590
It's whole 30 approved.
I don't even know what that means.

534
00:31:43,591 --> 00:31:48,420
What the 30 people running the bacon
world unsecured nitrate and sugar free.

535
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,360
This sausage is a healthy,

536
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:53,810
authentic version of a
classic style pork sausage.

537
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:55,460
My mouth is watering,

538
00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:00,520
like literally reading this simply
seasoned with salt and pepper and sage.

539
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:06,430
Oh my God. What a way to
start the day. I need that.

540
00:32:06,431 --> 00:32:10,260
I would start crying looking across
the table and life would be at work.

541
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:15,170
Matter of honey. It's just so
good right now. New members,

542
00:32:15,171 --> 00:32:17,870
we'll get two packages of bacon
and two pounds of breakfast.

543
00:32:17,871 --> 00:32:20,270
Sausage added to your first box for free.

544
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:23,180
Plus you'll get $20 off your first box.
Go.

545
00:32:23,181 --> 00:32:28,181
Now while supplies last as
this is a limited time offer,

546
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,370
these people know how to do it.
All right?

547
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:34,460
You want Americans to buy your beef.

548
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:38,900
You Dangle Free Bacon and sausage
in their fucking face and you set a

549
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,020
Jesus Christ the amount of fucking,
you know what's so?

550
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:47,360
You know the amount of fucking people
in overalls right now that are like half

551
00:32:47,361 --> 00:32:51,500
hard listening to this overalls.
I like the onesies for rednecks.

552
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:56,480
You know, that's when they know that they
grew up. I ain't got no sleeves on my,

553
00:32:56,481 --> 00:32:58,900
hey buddy,
you don't know who you fucking with.

554
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:01,950
Ain't got no sleeves or
or or or fade on my one Z.

555
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:08,150
I walk out sad, my one
z. That's how I'd do it.

556
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:14,760
Um, all right, that's the podcast.
Everybody please enjoy the, the,

557
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:16,590
the musical interlude.

558
00:33:16,591 --> 00:33:20,910
And then there's going to be a hit
another half hour bonus here of a Thursday

559
00:33:20,911 --> 00:33:24,360
afternoon just before Friday. Monday
morning podcast. A greatest hit.

560
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:29,380
I'm an episode from earlier. Oh,
I need to mention last night.

561
00:33:29,381 --> 00:33:31,240
So I went out and I did two sets.
That's right.

562
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:35,080
Cause I didn't like feeling rusty and I,
uh,

563
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:40,390
I got this whole new chunk and it
came last night and had a great set.

564
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:43,660
And then Brian Callen probably said some
of the nicest shit anybody said to me

565
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:47,770
as a comedian. I think he's
absolutely fucking brilliant. So, uh,

566
00:33:47,771 --> 00:33:50,290
I'm actually going to call him today
and thank him for the compliment.

567
00:33:50,291 --> 00:33:53,110
It put me on a stand up high,
you know,

568
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:58,000
which being the age that I
am, you know, I, you know,

569
00:33:58,001 --> 00:33:59,920
I got called the grandfather
and I and I haven't, yeah,

570
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,710
Aka our P card and I've still
never fucking used it. Okay.

571
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,450
And if you're young and you don't know
what it is, that's, that's awesome.

572
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,870
Enjoy the party your life where
you don't know what an AAR,

573
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:14,370
not qualified yet for one of those fucking
things. All right. That's the podcast.

574
00:34:14,371 --> 00:34:16,140
Enjoy the music.
Have a great weekend.

575
00:34:16,141 --> 00:34:19,410
Your comments and I
will see you on Monday,

576
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:25,410
Huh? Huh. Huh. Huh,

577
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:31,350
Huh, Huh, Huh, Huh. Huh.

578
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:35,960
Huh?
All

579
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:38,613
right.

580
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:43,913
Okay.

581
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:58,770
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burns
the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

582
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:02,040
April 4th,

583
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:07,040
2011 or 2011 as I saw it so
succinctly put this weekend by a,

584
00:35:10,171 --> 00:35:14,310
the great comedian Patton Oswald.
That's how he said it. He was on stage.

585
00:35:14,311 --> 00:35:18,840
I was doing a show with him, the Kevin
and been April foolish in a show. And uh,

586
00:35:18,841 --> 00:35:21,660
I noticed at some point at the
Gibson MP theater, by the way,

587
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:25,740
formerly known as the Universal
Lampi Theater for blues brother fans.

588
00:35:25,741 --> 00:35:27,960
You might recognize that
name, right? Remember that?

589
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,820
Good Evening Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the universal theater.

590
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:37,230
Here it is something, something going
on. 1985. So much in music here.

591
00:35:37,231 --> 00:35:40,170
Today's preprogrammed electronic disco.
That's where the fuck they did that.

592
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:44,220
They were opening for Steve Martin at
the height of Steve Martin's career when

593
00:35:44,221 --> 00:35:46,470
he had the white suit with a
bow and Arrow going through it.

594
00:35:46,471 --> 00:35:50,130
So that's the second year in a row.
I've got to do that wonderful program,

595
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:54,420
show performance, whatever
the fuck you call it. And, uh,

596
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,920
it was an awesome night of comedy,

597
00:35:55,921 --> 00:36:00,921
but there was something learned and all
the filth and funders that I saw that

598
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,060
night was pat and said 2011.

599
00:36:03,061 --> 00:36:04,710
So that's how I'm saying it
for the rest of the year,

600
00:36:04,711 --> 00:36:08,700
cause I can't say 2011 I
have to slow down. 2011,

601
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:12,570
2011 see it runs together.
2011,

602
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:16,440
all of a sudden everybody in the room
relaxes. Hey, we're with the friend.

603
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:20,760
We thought that that red headed guy
was, was, you know, who's left handed.

604
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:25,020
Some of the times was just
spawn of the devil. You know,

605
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,040
that's what they used to think about
redheads and people who wrote with their

606
00:36:29,041 --> 00:36:30,720
left hand.
So basically I would,

607
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:33,930
if it was still the 18 hundreds that would
be getting the shit slapped out of me

608
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:37,050
and one of those fucking schools,
you know,

609
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:39,420
that they used to have on
little house in the prairie.

610
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:42,810
We had grades two through eight.
We're all sitting in the same room.

611
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:48,260
Um, tell me there was an inappropriate
behavior going on there. You know,

612
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:52,100
you're a senior in high school, right? All
of a sudden the freshmen girls come in,

613
00:36:52,101 --> 00:36:53,230
there's always one pervert.

614
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:58,250
Your grade would descend on to someone
who was basically a fucking child at that

615
00:36:58,311 --> 00:36:58,551
point.

616
00:36:58,551 --> 00:37:03,551
You can't tell me back in the day in the
18 hundreds when people got married at

617
00:37:03,561 --> 00:37:05,450
14 so they could pull together,

618
00:37:05,451 --> 00:37:08,810
there's showing so they could go buy
a fucking plot of land in some oxygen.

619
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:14,300
Ah, you're telling me some eighth grade,
it wasn't rolling up on a fourth grader.

620
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:18,950
You know,
like some Catholic fucking Prius.

621
00:37:18,951 --> 00:37:22,130
I'm going to start that
God damn debate again. Um,

622
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:26,180
speaking of which, hey, you know what,

623
00:37:26,181 --> 00:37:29,180
for some reason the theme to Laverne
and Shirley is in my head today.

624
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:33,860
We're going to do it. I would think
of that's been in my head before,

625
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:38,950
every once in a while TV that I watched
way too much back in the day, uh,

626
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:41,540
pops into my head. But anyways,
getting back to the, uh,

627
00:37:41,541 --> 00:37:44,150
the Catholic Church thinks somebody
sent me a little bible thing,

628
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:49,600
said the dinosaurs are called behemoths
in the Bible and about outer space.

629
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,940
Alien ships,
a space ships abductions.

630
00:37:52,941 --> 00:37:57,920
His talks talked about in a Ezekiel one,

631
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:02,990
and these are from in
the King James Bible.

632
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:05,960
Now, after all these years
of trash in the Bible,

633
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:09,020
I'd have I ever mentioned to you guys that
I haven't even read the fucking thing.

634
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:12,530
Oh, I've tried. I've
tried to read the thing,

635
00:38:12,531 --> 00:38:16,850
but it's all he said it under
you with and then the fucking,

636
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:21,820
uh, Polynesians said to
the Persians, I mean, I,

637
00:38:21,821 --> 00:38:25,910
I can't, I can't get through it. It's
like trying to reach straight Shakespeare.

638
00:38:25,911 --> 00:38:30,580
But as far as I remember going
to church, they said, dad, uh,

639
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:33,740
you know, earth was created in
six days. On the seventh day,

640
00:38:33,741 --> 00:38:38,390
God rested and I created Adam
and eve and they were in a,

641
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:43,240
they were in Eden hanging out. Right?
Then all of a sudden, you know,

642
00:38:43,241 --> 00:38:47,290
he lays down some rules. He says,
Hey, listen, you guys are in paradise.

643
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:51,310
I just don't want you to go over there
and eat an apple off of that fucking tree.

644
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:56,290
You know? Is that so god damn
hard to not eat a piece of fruit?

645
00:38:56,620 --> 00:39:00,640
Who gives a shit? It's fruit.
No one wants to eat fruit.

646
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:05,200
The only people eat fruit or kids whose
parents are making a meet him. Okay.

647
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:09,850
Vegetarians and some 50 year old Wall
Street guy just suffered his third heart

648
00:39:09,851 --> 00:39:12,730
attack. Then maybe you'll have a
fucking apple so he doesn't die.

649
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:17,410
But other than that, how easy is it
not to eat an apple? Right? But Eve,

650
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:20,770
this stupid fucking whore that she is,
you know,

651
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,320
you're not going to tell me you can't.
I can't do something.

652
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:27,550
And because she's abroad and
you can't punch her in the face,

653
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:31,050
what does she have to
worry about? Ah, who,

654
00:39:31,051 --> 00:39:34,540
who the fuck is this God guide to
tell me I can't go and have an apple?

655
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,890
So what does she do?

656
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:41,020
She marches right over there with their
pubic hair blown in the fucking wind.

657
00:39:41,021 --> 00:39:43,900
Cause there's no shame at this
point because there's been no sin.

658
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:47,410
Everything's great.
You can walk around and go pet a cheetah.

659
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:49,360
It doesn't immediately or a leopard.

660
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,850
It doesn't immediately
grab you by the throat,

661
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:57,330
fucking snap your neck and then drag you
up in a tree so the lions can't get to

662
00:39:57,341 --> 00:40:00,970
it. Or somebody else may be
a fucking baboons, you know,

663
00:40:00,971 --> 00:40:05,410
with it's psycho goddamn teeth.
Do you know let's one of the,

664
00:40:05,411 --> 00:40:07,210
one of the fucking major,
uh,

665
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:11,890
adversaries for a leper as a fucking
baboons. I never knew that shit.

666
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:16,600
They got those giant teeth
who would announce, you know,

667
00:40:16,601 --> 00:40:20,420
very agile,
left to right sort of movement,

668
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:23,450
like a water bug, these
insane things. But Hey,

669
00:40:23,451 --> 00:40:27,710
let's get back to the Bible as far as I
remember it right. So they go z, you know,

670
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,650
walking up to the fucking apple tree,

671
00:40:30,651 --> 00:40:35,270
like some one of those fic Toria secret
horse walking down the first fucking

672
00:40:35,271 --> 00:40:38,570
runway.
Although she's not wearing heels,

673
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:41,510
she just walk in and she
never steps on a Brock.

674
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:46,870
Doesn't step on some glass from a
broken Miller lite bottle cause she's in

675
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:47,900
paradise.

676
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:53,850
She walks right over there and some
snakes starts yet. That's what happened.

677
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:56,870
Some snakes starts yapping in arrear,
right?

678
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:01,490
Like some Douche on Facebook who finds
your wife and her semi hot pictures

679
00:41:01,491 --> 00:41:06,380
starts emailing her, right? Wormed
his way into the relationship, right?

680
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:08,450
So this whore goes up
and what does she do?

681
00:41:08,451 --> 00:41:11,120
She reaches up and she
takes a bite of fruit.

682
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:16,220
She eats an apple as far as I've been
told, part of this nutritious breakfast,

683
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:21,080
part of a balanced diet sheets. A fucking
apple. Maybe she wanted to be regular,

684
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:22,213
right?

685
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:27,520
So she'd see apple and then
God goes, what the fuck, bitch,

686
00:41:27,521 --> 00:41:32,521
what the fuck did I t the one thing I
say not to do and you got to go do it.

687
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:36,800
Go Fuck Yourself. That's the end of
paradise. And next thing you know,

688
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:40,750
she's putting a leaf over a fucking clam.
All right?

689
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,040
Adam's over there.
He didn't do ship.

690
00:41:43,041 --> 00:41:46,130
And evidently he gets punished
too because it's religion,

691
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:49,820
you know the punishment
never has to make sense.

692
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:53,900
It just has to be really fucking scary.
So now they're both fucked.

693
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:56,960
Now all of a sudden the leopards want
to fucking take a bite out of their ass,

694
00:41:56,961 --> 00:41:59,600
so they got to get sharpened
sticks and all this type of shit.

695
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:03,230
Right now,
according to the Bible,

696
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:07,040
all of this that happened like fucking
a couple hundred thousand years ago,

697
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:11,930
and then one day some nerd who's not
getting pussy, he so fucking hard up.

698
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:15,110
He just starts digging in the ground.
You know,

699
00:42:15,111 --> 00:42:16,880
he's got all that sexual frustration.

700
00:42:16,881 --> 00:42:21,620
He just keeps digging in the ground and
one day finds these dinosaur bones that

701
00:42:21,621 --> 00:42:24,380
are way fucking older than
the Adam and Eve story.

702
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:27,440
So it kind of kills the
whole God damn thing.

703
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:31,070
Now that is far as I know
is the story in the Bible,

704
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:35,570
how the Bible goes down and that's why
people on the science side question the

705
00:42:35,571 --> 00:42:40,250
Bible. Like I said, I haven't read it.
All right, so people who've read it,

706
00:42:40,251 --> 00:42:42,900
can you give me the cheat notes or
are you Bible thumpers out there?

707
00:42:42,901 --> 00:42:47,900
We think the Bible is the best book
ever fucking written aside from the fact

708
00:42:47,901 --> 00:42:50,660
that when it was written, they still
thought the fucking world was flat.

709
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:52,250
They thought if you were gay,

710
00:42:52,251 --> 00:42:55,940
you get you go to hell and all that
other intolerant horse shit in there.

711
00:42:56,660 --> 00:43:00,500
But you know, I never read the fucking
thing. So you know, let me know.

712
00:43:00,501 --> 00:43:03,020
Cause this guy's trying to acclaim,
trying to claim,

713
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:07,100
trying to claim that they
address dinosaurs in the Bible,

714
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:08,510
calling them behemoths,

715
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:14,620
which is amazing considering we never
discovered the fucking boats until after

716
00:43:14,661 --> 00:43:17,120
the book was written. So
how does that work? Huh?

717
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:21,890
Was that when God was a burning Bush
and all the fish was coming out of the

718
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:25,880
basket and he just sorta muttered
something about behemoths and nobody

719
00:43:25,881 --> 00:43:28,640
understood it, but it was God. So
they just wrote it down anyways.

720
00:43:28,641 --> 00:43:32,510
Is that what you're going
to claim? Oh, Jesus.

721
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:36,700
Oh, GPA. Um,

722
00:43:37,970 --> 00:43:41,570
who can turn their world on with her tits.

723
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:47,060
Um, what did I want to talk about
this week? How about the Bruins,

724
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:49,790
Bruins making the fucking playoffs?

725
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:53,600
I'm predicting that the Bruins will once
again make it to the eastern conference

726
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:56,570
finals and then, uh, then
what's going to happen?

727
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:59,480
I'll tell you what's going to happen is
that they're not going to go any further.

728
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:03,740
I Dunno. I'm just going to say that
cause hopefully they'll prove me wrong.

729
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:05,630
Who knows?
We've got a great goalie.

730
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:09,110
You know what's scaring me is fucking
Carey price up in Montreal has been

731
00:44:09,111 --> 00:44:12,170
playing fantastic.
All right.

732
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:15,770
And for some reason when the Bruins have
a great goalie, it only gets us so far.

733
00:44:15,771 --> 00:44:19,280
But those sons of bitches
up there with Ken Dryden,

734
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:24,850
Patrick Ouab back and fucking 93 when
they went on that implausible run one like

735
00:44:26,841 --> 00:44:28,370
19 overtime games,

736
00:44:28,371 --> 00:44:32,130
one of the great runs at winning
the Stanley Cup of all fucking time.

737
00:44:33,350 --> 00:44:36,960
Um, who knows? I don't know. I
think the flyers will beat him.

738
00:44:36,961 --> 00:44:40,290
The flyers never seem to have
problem with the Canadians. Uh,

739
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:45,240
they don't give a fuck. Right? They
just get a punch you in the face.

740
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:49,480
Uh, anyways. Hey, listen to
this shit. You know something,

741
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:52,140
what happened to me twice
this week is people just,

742
00:44:52,141 --> 00:44:56,550
they don't hear what the fuck I'm saying.
This is the classic thing.

743
00:44:56,551 --> 00:44:57,940
When you're doing standup comedy,

744
00:44:57,941 --> 00:45:01,050
you stand on stage and you tell a
bunch of jokes and everybody laughs,

745
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,240
everybody's having just a great time.

746
00:45:03,241 --> 00:45:06,780
And then all of a sudden you come around
to his subject that touches a little

747
00:45:06,781 --> 00:45:09,930
close to somebody's life and all of a
sudden you're not telling jokes anymore.

748
00:45:09,931 --> 00:45:14,160
Now you're making statements. Well, Lo
and behold, once again, this happens.

749
00:45:14,161 --> 00:45:15,330
I don't know if you
guys are aware of this,

750
00:45:15,331 --> 00:45:19,770
but my let it go special is now up
on Netflix, the unedited version,

751
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:22,140
the version that I
wanted the world to see.

752
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:27,630
But that dream was crushed
because on comedy central,

753
00:45:27,631 --> 00:45:30,810
they have advertisers and that's how
they make their money, which I respect.

754
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,170
So then, you know, they
got to cut out some jokes.

755
00:45:34,171 --> 00:45:37,920
They got to start doing the Morse code
because they say fuck every other word

756
00:45:37,921 --> 00:45:42,540
and then Yada, Yada, Yada. But now
it's on Netflix. Now it's on Netflix.

757
00:45:42,541 --> 00:45:46,830
And you can watch that son of a bitch,
a completely unedited.

758
00:45:46,831 --> 00:45:51,310
So please tell your friends, please tell
your family, tell some your enemies. Um,

759
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:56,160
so anyways, so some, uh, some woman
evidently watch this. Watch my special,

760
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:58,350
my standup comedy special,

761
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:02,310
the one where I go on and act like an ass
and I'm telling jokes just to make you

762
00:46:02,311 --> 00:46:06,450
laugh,
just to fucking appease my ego.

763
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:08,850
That's all on doing.
So anyways,

764
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:13,070
this lady starts off and uh,

765
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:17,700
she says offended by your stay
at home mom bit. She starts off.

766
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:21,510
Hi.
Obviously I'm a stay at home mom.

767
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:23,160
Why is that obvious?

768
00:46:25,170 --> 00:46:28,620
Because you said you were offended
by my stay at home mom bit.

769
00:46:28,621 --> 00:46:32,490
Why couldn't you be just a
supporter of stay at home moms? Oh,

770
00:46:32,491 --> 00:46:36,330
I'm being a cunt right out of the gate.
Let's read this. She starts off high.

771
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:40,290
Obviously I'm a stay at home
mom and I love watching standup,

772
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:45,710
but I couldn't continue watching you
based on your bit about stay at home moms.

773
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:47,670
You know what I love about it?

774
00:46:47,671 --> 00:46:52,671
It's an hour long special and I think
I opened with that joke or it was

775
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:56,370
literally within the first five
minutes and she had to shut it off.

776
00:46:57,690 --> 00:47:02,190
She says, I'm really sorry you feel
that way about stay at home moms.

777
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:06,120
That's one of my pet peeves is when
someone's about ready to take the piss out

778
00:47:06,121 --> 00:47:10,650
of me. I hate when they
apologize. Okay. You're not sorry.

779
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:13,020
You're not sorry that I feel that way.

780
00:47:13,021 --> 00:47:17,490
You fucking hate me because I feel
that way. All right. Stop apologizing.

781
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:21,750
Oh God. My voice is cracking.
Stop apologizing. All right.

782
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:26,190
Um, anyway, she goes and the
uh, blah blah blah blah blah.

783
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:27,810
If it weren't for us,

784
00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:33,290
there would be no one to drill holes and
to do all the other important jobs that

785
00:47:33,641 --> 00:47:36,670
you mentioned. All right?
If it weren't for you,

786
00:47:36,671 --> 00:47:39,460
what are you just fucking
meditate and you'll make a person

787
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:43,150
you self centered fucking whore.

788
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:46,780
Can you believe she just took
credit for the creation of babies?

789
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:52,950
100% credit. What about the guy
who fucking sticks it in? Yeah.

790
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,630
Huh. Oh, I am getting close.

791
00:47:58,030 --> 00:48:02,110
What about that part of it?
There wasn't some hairy,

792
00:48:02,111 --> 00:48:03,220
sweaty man

793
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:10,950
pounding away at your fucking
womanhood to completion.

794
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:16,600
I might add a number of times during
the course of a month, two months,

795
00:48:16,601 --> 00:48:19,840
possibly three months if you got,
you know,

796
00:48:19,890 --> 00:48:23,600
if you've got some sort of issue down
there for some reason you're, you're,

797
00:48:24,010 --> 00:48:26,590
I dunno what the fuck. I never
tried to do it, but I know, yeah,

798
00:48:26,591 --> 00:48:29,140
we're having a difficult time.
We're trying to get pregnant,

799
00:48:29,141 --> 00:48:33,400
but we're having a difficult time.
It's not the fucking part.

800
00:48:33,401 --> 00:48:37,480
It's the impregnation part. She's
just totally taking away all of that,

801
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:41,560
that evidently she just sits there
and all of a sudden she's pregnant.

802
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:42,970
Kind of like dead chicken.

803
00:48:42,971 --> 00:48:47,971
The Bible hanging out with
that fucking hippie bum Joseph.

804
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:53,860
Right? He sitting over in the
corner with his vaporizer.

805
00:48:53,861 --> 00:48:58,060
Hey Man, I noticed she looks
like you putting on weight, man.

806
00:48:59,590 --> 00:49:03,340
You got to lay off the
Dorito. It's man. Right?

807
00:49:03,350 --> 00:49:06,760
And all of a sudden she's fucking
pregnant. So have a deli this broad.

808
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:11,560
She's taking full credit,
full credit for getting pregnant.

809
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:16,810
Completely ignoring the man's part of it.
He loved getting close.

810
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:23,950
That's, that's the noise I make
when I climb x. By the way,

811
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:30,160
I make it, I, I announced it, the
female in a really high pitched voice,

812
00:49:30,190 --> 00:49:32,500
sorta of whiny voice and getting close.

813
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:36,510
And then I put my mouth right
next to her ear and I go, oh,

814
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:41,820
that's how it goes down in my world.
Um,

815
00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:45,430
some of the most sophomore
humor humor I've ever done.

816
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:49,420
And right now there's a bunch of guys
laughing and there's a bunch of females

817
00:49:49,421 --> 00:49:52,120
with the nose all wrinkled up.
This, this is what you listen to.

818
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:55,750
This is what you think is funny. Yes,
bitch, this is what I think is funny.

819
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:59,920
Why don't you go back out in the
kitchen and finish, make a potato salad.

820
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:04,530
All right. The fourth
of July's coming up. Um,

821
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:07,180
I made no sense. Okay. Um,
and if it weren't for us,

822
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:10,810
there would be no one drilling holes
and do all the other important jobs that

823
00:50:10,811 --> 00:50:13,180
you mentioned.
I didn't say they weren't important.

824
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:18,940
I didn't say those jobs were important.
You didn't even listen to the bit.

825
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:20,750
Let me continue reading here.
I said,

826
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:25,850
Oprah said that being a mother is
the most difficult job in the planet.

827
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:29,130
If she said it's the most important
job, I would have gone with her.

828
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,840
But she said it was
the most difficult job.

829
00:50:31,450 --> 00:50:36,450
That's that right there was the
seat of the bit that I created.

830
00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:40,590
Okay.
Just like you creating the fucking kid.

831
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:43,260
But I don't feel like I
created the joke on my own.

832
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:46,200
It took Oprah to say to,
to,

833
00:50:46,201 --> 00:50:48,840
to plant the seed by saying,

834
00:50:49,350 --> 00:50:54,000
by saying that it was the most
difficult job on the planet.

835
00:50:54,270 --> 00:50:58,770
All right. That was her
climaxing into my joke. Pussy.

836
00:50:58,950 --> 00:51:01,650
Oh, that's disgusting. Anyways,

837
00:51:02,070 --> 00:51:06,090
so now I think everybody's
wrinkling their nose. So here we go.

838
00:51:06,450 --> 00:51:10,440
So she continues after not even
hearing what I'm saying and she said,

839
00:51:10,441 --> 00:51:14,190
and the reason you stay in your pajamas
all day, that was the line I said,

840
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:19,520
talking about women is because you
don't have one minute to change.

841
00:51:20,850 --> 00:51:25,850
Try taking a shower and putting on on
clothes and clothes on with children's

842
00:51:26,030 --> 00:51:30,900
screaming and crying at the
shower door. It's 24, seven.

843
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:34,900
It never stops. Uh, you
don't click a time card.

844
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:38,220
You never get off work. It's 24, seven.

845
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:41,070
You have absolutely no
idea until you're in it.

846
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:45,000
I made a lot of money in my career
before motherhood, Motherhood,

847
00:51:45,150 --> 00:51:49,350
I earned my MBA and other degrees.
I've lived and worked abroad.

848
00:51:49,590 --> 00:51:53,180
Motherhood is the hardest job
I've ever done. I've never said,

849
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:58,530
I've never said it's not the hardest
job that you've ever done. Okay?

850
00:52:00,070 --> 00:52:00,511
All right.

851
00:52:00,511 --> 00:52:04,080
But I'm willing to bet that you've never
done a job harder than working on a

852
00:52:04,081 --> 00:52:08,520
fucking oil rig in the middle
of the ocean. All right,

853
00:52:08,521 --> 00:52:09,354
sweetheart,

854
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:14,310
being a mom is not more difficult than
working on an oil rig in the middle of

855
00:52:14,311 --> 00:52:15,210
the fucking ocean.

856
00:52:15,330 --> 00:52:18,990
How about that guy out there worked
on one and it fucking blew up.

857
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:22,230
He's got second degree burns on his back.

858
00:52:22,530 --> 00:52:25,540
It they're going to turn into third degree
burns and then he's eventually going

859
00:52:25,541 --> 00:52:27,120
to explode into flames.

860
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:32,210
So his only option is to jump basically
the equivalent of a three story

861
00:52:32,221 --> 00:52:34,020
building.
He jumps off it,

862
00:52:35,290 --> 00:52:35,770
okay

863
00:52:35,770 --> 00:52:40,000
with his rob burned up back into
the salt water of the ocean.

864
00:52:41,690 --> 00:52:44,270
Also now covered in oil.

865
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:48,260
He's covered in oil with second
degree burns in salt water.

866
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:52,150
Okay?
He can barely fucking breathe.

867
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:56,410
The fucking ocean is catching on fire
because of the oil that's on the surface

868
00:52:56,411 --> 00:52:58,750
of the water.
He has to swim out of that,

869
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:05,150
get out into the ocean but not get too
far away cause he wants to get rescued.

870
00:53:05,330 --> 00:53:09,440
Now he's got to sit there treading water
hoping he doesn't get eaten alive by

871
00:53:09,441 --> 00:53:12,140
sharks or drown

872
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:15,900
or diet.
I Dunno what else.

873
00:53:15,990 --> 00:53:18,750
While he waits for the Coast
Guard to come and pick them up,

874
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:22,000
now you tell me all the mothers out there.

875
00:53:22,001 --> 00:53:25,060
I want you to explain to me a
day that was more difficult than,

876
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:29,100
and not only that all this woman is doing
is talking about the negative aspects

877
00:53:29,101 --> 00:53:31,830
of being a mother. She's not
talking about how rewarding it is.

878
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:35,550
You don't get unconditional
love from a fucking oil rig.

879
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:37,640
It's not going to be sitting
there at your deathbed,

880
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:42,650
holding your fucking hand telling you
that you know the oil rig is everything it

881
00:53:42,751 --> 00:53:46,500
is today because of you as a person.
Give me a fucking break.

882
00:53:47,690 --> 00:53:48,420
All right?

883
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:53,420
And also you made the choice to become
a mother by letting that guy get on top

884
00:53:54,721 --> 00:53:57,630
of you. Oh, getting close, right?

885
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:03,800
Typical fucking broad.
Do Your fucking idea.

886
00:54:03,830 --> 00:54:07,220
She goes anywhere she can tell you use
your joke is so offensive and so totally

887
00:54:07,221 --> 00:54:11,870
wrong. It's disgusting.
Another thing, this is precious
time to me in the evening.

888
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:14,300
Well,
I didn't fucking ask you to email me.

889
00:54:17,010 --> 00:54:21,540
Good Lord. What a fuck she,
this is a mother. Look at
her working with the guilt.

890
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:23,910
This is precious time to me.

891
00:54:23,911 --> 00:54:28,260
In the evening you are watching a stand
up special that was going to take a

892
00:54:28,261 --> 00:54:33,050
whole fucking hour.
You shut it off.

893
00:54:33,051 --> 00:54:34,400
Seven minutes into it.

894
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:38,090
That gives you a next of 53
minutes to write two paragraphs.

895
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:43,440
They're so full of shit.
So anyways,

896
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:48,000
she's trying to make me feel guilty like
I'm taking away from her fucking day.

897
00:54:48,170 --> 00:54:48,751
I know the thing.

898
00:54:48,751 --> 00:54:51,900
This is precious time to me in the
evening when I can be taking a shower,

899
00:54:52,050 --> 00:54:56,190
read or watch a show and
recharge for the next day.

900
00:54:56,370 --> 00:54:57,270
Wait a minute.

901
00:54:57,570 --> 00:55:01,740
You just told me that being
a mom was a 24 seven job,

902
00:55:02,850 --> 00:55:06,630
it never stops. It never ends.
Here you are chilling out,

903
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:08,600
wanted to take a shower,

904
00:55:08,610 --> 00:55:13,230
read or watch a show and
recharge for the next day.

905
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:18,790
Jesus Christ. She's goes, oh, maybe later
tonight when one of my children get up,

906
00:55:19,270 --> 00:55:20,950
I'm not on Facebook.

907
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:25,300
I don't waste any time on the computer
and I don't complain about things,

908
00:55:25,390 --> 00:55:29,560
but this was so offensive that I make
time for this email. I'll thank you.

909
00:55:29,590 --> 00:55:31,510
Thank you for taking time out of your day.

910
00:55:32,410 --> 00:55:37,120
You're unbelievably 24 seven day
and you just had to say something.

911
00:55:37,150 --> 00:55:40,930
Then this is, this is awesome sheet.
This is how she answered email. She says,

912
00:55:40,931 --> 00:55:45,490
very disappointed, Jamie. Oh,
actually I never named names. Okay,

913
00:55:45,491 --> 00:55:46,780
so this is what I love about this.

914
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:52,840
This woman is obviously going to be a
great mom, okay? She's dedicated to what?

915
00:55:52,841 --> 00:55:56,770
She's walked away from her Mba career and
all that type of shit so she can focus

916
00:55:56,771 --> 00:55:58,270
on a career.
Okay.

917
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:02,200
But what you could see here is the
resentment that's already building because

918
00:56:02,201 --> 00:56:06,250
she's already throwing
out guilt on to everybody.

919
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:10,990
That's what I love about mothers. All
right. No one told you to become a mother.

920
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:16,020
You made that fucking choice and now you
actually have like resentment for your

921
00:56:16,841 --> 00:56:20,230
fucking job and you just
starting to put it on your kids.

922
00:56:20,231 --> 00:56:23,440
I can tell you're already putting it on
your kids because you're trying to it on

923
00:56:23,441 --> 00:56:24,000
me.

924
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,570
He tried to make me feel guilty that
you took the time to send me a fucking

925
00:56:28,770 --> 00:56:29,080
email.

926
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:32,170
I didn't ask you to send me your fucking
email and then you end it with very

927
00:56:32,171 --> 00:56:34,780
disappointed like I'm
looking for your approval.

928
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:38,650
See you're already getting
your God complex cause your
fucking kids are looking

929
00:56:38,651 --> 00:56:43,270
at you like you know every God damn
answer on the planet, which you don't.

930
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:49,240
Jesus Christ. So there,
there, there you go.

931
00:56:50,350 --> 00:56:52,240
There you go. People,
there it is. In a nutshell.

932
00:56:52,241 --> 00:56:55,990
That's what it's like to be a stand up
comedian. You make one fucking joke.

933
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:58,720
Okay.
About an overstatement.

934
00:56:59,410 --> 00:57:02,800
That so much said that being a mother
is the most difficult job on the planet.

935
00:57:03,610 --> 00:57:06,160
So what does that, that makes me
think about all these other jobs,

936
00:57:06,161 --> 00:57:07,210
digging for coal,

937
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:11,470
yet out being president of the United
States and having to have a decide that

938
00:57:11,471 --> 00:57:13,900
we're going to go to war and
then you got to lay to bed,

939
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:18,430
go lay in bed knowing that a bunch of
people are now going to die. Babies,

940
00:57:18,431 --> 00:57:19,900
women,
you know,

941
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:24,750
18 to 21 year old fucking people who
signed up right out, out, out, out, out,

942
00:57:24,751 --> 00:57:28,490
out a God damn high school to be in
the army, marines, Navy. You got it.

943
00:57:28,491 --> 00:57:30,040
You got to make that.
You've got to lay in bed,

944
00:57:30,041 --> 00:57:32,890
try and get fucking eight hours sleep
with that shit weighing on your head.

945
00:57:34,270 --> 00:57:37,850
You know
that that was a joke.

946
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:39,710
It's not the most difficult
job in the planet.

947
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:42,710
If you said it's the most important, I
would have gone with that. All right.

948
00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:46,820
I said I was arguing that it
wasn't the most difficult. Okay.

949
00:57:46,821 --> 00:57:47,990
And this is what happens.
People.

950
00:57:47,991 --> 00:57:52,490
They don't hear what you're saying and
then they go off on another 10 tangent.

951
00:57:52,491 --> 00:57:57,470
Like this other fucking cunt.
This is a guy. All right.

952
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:02,000
This guy, what the fuck did he
talk? Where the hell is it? Ah,

953
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:05,660
Jesus. Bill. Oh Jesus. Look what you did.

954
00:58:05,661 --> 00:58:10,550
You just slowed the whole
fucking thing down. Um, oh,

955
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:13,490
I disagree.
He said bill loved the podcast,

956
00:58:13,491 --> 00:58:16,430
but I disagree with you on the
whole music downloading thing.

957
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:21,260
Most of my music that I've,
that I have is not bought for good reason.

958
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:24,650
First of all,
the last two CD's I bought brand new from.

959
00:58:24,650 --> 00:58:29,650
The store's skipped in multiple
CD players right out of the box.

960
00:58:30,050 --> 00:58:33,110
Secondly,
artists only get about five to 10%,

961
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:35,330
five to 10 cents per CD,

962
00:58:35,331 --> 00:58:39,590
which in the grand scheme
of things doesn't add up to
much compared to the money

963
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:43,340
they get from tee shirts and
gigs. Now, don't get me wrong,

964
00:58:43,550 --> 00:58:47,540
the people that just download thousands
of CD's worth of stuff and never go to

965
00:58:47,541 --> 00:58:49,960
shows there.
The douche bags,

966
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:54,170
I tried to go to at least
five shows a year. Wow.

967
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:57,320
And I go to Lollapalooza in
Chicago once every three years.

968
00:58:57,321 --> 00:59:00,620
So am I a loser to your
bill? No, you're not a loser.

969
00:59:01,730 --> 00:59:03,140
You're just stealing music.

970
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:09,020
You stealing fucking music and you're
trying to shine it all up like, hey man,

971
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:10,880
the artist's doesn't
make any fucking money.

972
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:14,930
You bought two cds from the store and
they skipped in multiple places. Dude,

973
00:59:15,290 --> 00:59:20,000
you can go to iTunes and you can
download music in a digital form and that

974
00:59:20,001 --> 00:59:21,560
doesn't skip.
All right?

975
00:59:21,561 --> 00:59:26,060
You're trying to justify the fact that
you still thousands and thousands of

976
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:28,520
dollars worth the fucking music.
And then you spent, you know,

977
00:59:28,610 --> 00:59:29,840
a couple hundred bucks

978
00:59:31,550 --> 00:59:36,110
on concert tickets and tee shirts
and shit. And then, and there you go.

979
00:59:37,510 --> 00:59:40,750
I didn't steal a hundred percent for you.
I completely disagree with you.

980
00:59:40,751 --> 00:59:43,090
I don't want to say, and you're a
loser. I'm saying you're a thief,

981
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:46,850
you're stealing and you know
you're stealing. All right.

982
00:59:47,930 --> 00:59:50,990
I'm not a musician, dude. I've
bought cds. I bought those things.

983
00:59:50,991 --> 00:59:54,200
I know they start to skip, but if I
buy my fucking upload them onto my,

984
00:59:54,530 --> 00:59:59,090
my computer, but I, I do all of my
shit through Itunes, but uh, I don't,

985
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,990
I don't steal music.
And what I did steal it,

986
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:05,360
I addressed the fact that
I was stealing music.

987
01:00:05,361 --> 01:00:09,590
I wasn't saying that I wasn't part of
the fucking problem back in the day when

988
01:00:09,591 --> 01:00:10,550
it first came out,

989
01:00:10,551 --> 01:00:15,380
my eyes fucking dropped out of my head
to free music and I went to limewire and

990
01:00:15,381 --> 01:00:17,480
I downloaded a couple of
hundred fucking socks.

991
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:21,050
But in the end when people presented
the argument, dude, just stealing,

992
01:00:21,930 --> 01:00:25,250
I couldn't get around it. I was like,
yeah, you're right. I am. So I stopped.

993
01:00:25,730 --> 01:00:28,610
So I'm not saying I'm better than you and
I'm not saying you're a fucking loser.

994
01:00:28,611 --> 01:00:30,740
What I'm saying is you
steal it fucking music,

995
01:00:30,950 --> 01:00:35,300
however you frame it and go and do a
couple of concerts doesn't make up for the

996
01:00:35,301 --> 01:00:39,050
fact that you stole the music.
You know,

997
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:42,300
it's like concert tickets costs money.

998
01:00:42,630 --> 01:00:45,780
It's like a concert ticket was
free and you made a donation.

999
01:00:46,290 --> 01:00:48,650
You still got something out of your money,
you got a t shirt,

1000
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:50,070
you got a fucking concert ticket.

1001
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:55,350
So you're acting like those monies make
up for the fact that you stole music.

1002
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:57,450
Like you didn't get anything out of the,
out of,

1003
01:00:57,510 --> 01:01:00,630
out of the concert ticket and
putting down money for a t shirt.

1004
01:01:00,631 --> 01:01:03,210
You got to fucking rock
show or hip hop show,

1005
01:01:03,211 --> 01:01:07,560
whatever the fuck you went to and you got
a t shirt that doesn't make up for the

1006
01:01:07,561 --> 01:01:12,030
fact that you stole the fucking music.
It doesn't. All right. So like I said,

1007
01:01:12,031 --> 01:01:15,210
I'm not saying you're a loser.
You're a fucking thief. Oh,

1008
01:01:15,211 --> 01:01:18,170
I'm on my God damn high horse here.
Um,

1009
01:01:18,990 --> 01:01:21,360
let's get to underrated
overrated here. People, uh,

1010
01:01:21,370 --> 01:01:26,220
a topic that I thought was dying that
I'm actually pleased to say is a,

1011
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:30,840
is making a comeback. Oh, before I do
that, I mentioned a few weeks ago that,

1012
01:01:30,870 --> 01:01:34,080
um,
the short film cheat that me,

1013
01:01:34,110 --> 01:01:39,110
Joe de Rosa and Robert Kelly wrote and
acted in and Joe de Rosa did a phenomenal

1014
01:01:40,141 --> 01:01:43,110
job directing this movie,
the short film.

1015
01:01:43,111 --> 01:01:45,390
We got it into the Tribeca film festival,

1016
01:01:45,690 --> 01:01:47,760
which is one of the biggest
film festivals out there.

1017
01:01:47,761 --> 01:01:51,390
It's right up there with Sundance
and all that type of stuff. Um,

1018
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:54,540

We're going to try to hang out as,

1022
01:02:05,370 --> 01:02:07,410

1023
01:02:07,411 --> 01:02:10,790
There's a couple of them that we're not
allowed to go to just because there's

1024
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:14,370
going to be industry there and they
want to review the film and you know,

1025
01:02:14,371 --> 01:02:16,740
we can't be breathing down their necks,
making them uncomfortable.

1026
01:02:16,740 --> 01:02:20,160
So here are the screening
times, uh, Saturday,

1027
01:02:20,161 --> 01:02:25,080
April 23rd at 7:00 PM
is the first screening.

1028
01:02:25,081 --> 01:02:28,530
Of course, I don't have where the
screening, I'm such a fucking idiot.

1029
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:30,180
I'll give you this information.

1030
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:35,300
I'll just tell you when or they are this
Saturday at 7:00 PM Wednesday at 5:30

1031
01:02:36,930 --> 01:02:41,070

That's April 27th and Saturday,

Sunday May 1st at 7:30 PM.

1033
01:02:47,370 --> 01:02:51,630
Um, I believe I'm calling in the
opiod Anthony show this week.

1034
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:54,870
I believe Thursday this week,
uh,

1035
01:02:54,930 --> 01:02:57,930
to Rosa and Bobby Kelly are going to be
on there and we're going to have all the

1036
01:02:57,931 --> 01:03:00,720
rest of the information. So
I'm, I what an idiot I am.

1037
01:03:01,470 --> 01:03:04,620
Why am I such a fucking moron? You know
it go to the [inaudible] podcast.com.

1038
01:03:04,621 --> 01:03:08,820
We'll it, we'll have the actual, that's
the official fan page, by the way.

1039
01:03:09,630 --> 01:03:11,970
And he gets all the shit right?
I'm such a fucking more,

1040
01:03:11,971 --> 01:03:15,300
I was so excited to tell you guys all
that type of shit. And what did I do?

1041
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:18,270
What did I do?
I fucked the whole thing up.

1042
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:20,673
All right.

1043
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:23,530
You feel that?
Do you hear that silence?

1044
01:03:23,590 --> 01:03:27,790
The podcast is just screeched to a
grinding halt and it's 100% my fault.

1045
01:03:27,810 --> 01:03:31,060
All right. Underrated. Overrated for
this week. All right. Underrated.

1046
01:03:31,061 --> 01:03:34,240
This guy says ice cream sandwiches.
Uh,

1047
01:03:34,241 --> 01:03:37,690
they are made from the cheapest ice
cream and the crappiest cookies,

1048
01:03:37,691 --> 01:03:41,860
but they are fucking delicious.
And I can eat like five. Um,

1049
01:03:41,890 --> 01:03:43,870
I actually had a debate
with Nia on this one.

1050
01:03:44,770 --> 01:03:45,603
MMM.

1051
01:03:46,550 --> 01:03:48,440
I thought he was literally talking
about ice cream sandwiches,

1052
01:03:48,441 --> 01:03:50,060
but she's saying because he said cookies.

1053
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:53,870
He means those ones that have like the
chocolate chip cookies. And with that,

1054
01:03:53,871 --> 01:03:57,740
just that generic ice cream in the
middle. It's basically, you know,

1055
01:03:57,741 --> 01:04:00,800
the filling that they put in hot dogs.
It's the ice cream version of that.

1056
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:05,420
And he said he can eat like five and uh,
I am right there with you.

1057
01:04:06,110 --> 01:04:08,630
I'm right there with you. I think I
could eat, I think I could eat six,

1058
01:04:08,631 --> 01:04:12,350
but I would get sick, but I could eat five
just like you and I would not be sick.

1059
01:04:12,590 --> 01:04:16,610
And my body at no point would be acting
like what I was doing was incorrect

1060
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:22,120
until about Oh 15 minutes later when
I suddenly would have to take a nap.

1061
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,370
Never eat really bad food and
you have to take a nap. Um,

1062
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:31,610
you get all sleepy or as black people
call it the Itis, you get the itis.

1063
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:35,450
I told you that story a long time
ago. Deny. I'll tell it to you again.

1064
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:40,680
The fuck I got an hour to kill here.
I know I got some new listeners, um,

1065
01:04:42,350 --> 01:04:46,490
back in the day when I was on the, uh,
the Chappelle show tour and it was me,

1066
01:04:47,210 --> 01:04:51,290
Charlie Murphy and uh,
Don l Rawlings who played ashy Larry.

1067
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:55,910
We went out in 2004,
mid 2004 and toward I s I taught,

1068
01:04:55,970 --> 01:05:00,770
I stayed on the tour till about a,
the end of February, 2005. And, uh,

1069
01:05:00,771 --> 01:05:03,230
these guys used to break
my balls about my shirts,

1070
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:05,030
all my clothes and all that type of shit.

1071
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:08,810
That actually turned into a bit when I
did my half hour special, that whole bit,

1072
01:05:08,811 --> 01:05:09,080
that Ma,

1073
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:12,680
this motherfucker only has five shirts
that came from hanging out with those

1074
01:05:12,681 --> 01:05:15,620
guys doing talent shows back in the day.

1075
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:19,580
Drew Frazier and all those
guys, Rob Stapleton, uh,

1076
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:22,810
well who are the room did I
used to do Capone's roams,

1077
01:05:22,811 --> 01:05:26,110
all those things when I used to jump
back and forth between the black rooms,

1078
01:05:26,111 --> 01:05:28,960
white rooms for mainstream rooms,
the uptown rooms as they used to call him.

1079
01:05:29,590 --> 01:05:33,490
But anyways, so these guys
used to, you know, thanks,

1080
01:05:33,491 --> 01:05:35,110
you just give me shit
and that type of stuff.

1081
01:05:35,111 --> 01:05:37,960
So we had gone out drinking
or I had gone out drinking,

1082
01:05:37,961 --> 01:05:41,890
I was brutally fucking hung over and I
just didn't want to listen to that shit.

1083
01:05:42,190 --> 01:05:47,190
And we were driving from Chicago up to
Vernon hills to do a the xannies up there

1084
01:05:48,401 --> 01:05:50,720
and it was a good hour, hour and
a half drive. I don't know what,

1085
01:05:50,721 --> 01:05:54,540
but it was gonna seem like five hours and
I could tell that they were just going

1086
01:05:54,541 --> 01:05:57,220
to be fucking on my shit
because I was really hung over.

1087
01:05:57,580 --> 01:06:01,480
So what I did was I asked the,
I don't know,

1088
01:06:01,510 --> 01:06:05,980
somehow I walked out to try and get some
fresh air and I saw that there was a

1089
01:06:05,981 --> 01:06:09,130
Popeye's chicken,
like fucking two blocks up.

1090
01:06:09,131 --> 01:06:12,880
So I ran up there and got like a fucking,
I don't know,

1091
01:06:13,420 --> 01:06:16,990
a 17 piece of that shit with
biscuits and all of that ship.

1092
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:22,360
We will leave and right around 11 and we
go and we get in the fucking limo to go

1093
01:06:22,361 --> 01:06:23,530
up there and I'd bring,
hey guys,

1094
01:06:23,531 --> 01:06:28,531
they got us some food and I ate one piece
and watched them devour like another

1095
01:06:28,541 --> 01:06:32,920
five, six pieces, a couple
of biscuits. Right? And they
were already giving me shit.

1096
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:37,210
And within fucking 15 minutes
they were fucking sound asleep.

1097
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:45,850
And I just sat there with a smile on
my face with some of that greasy food,

1098
01:06:45,851 --> 01:06:49,450
my stomach, but not enough to make me fall
asleep. Just enough to feel comforted,

1099
01:06:49,750 --> 01:06:53,140
comforted. Right. And I had my
sunglasses on and I cruised,

1100
01:06:53,141 --> 01:06:55,960
although we cruise all the way up there
and they slept the whole fucking way.

1101
01:06:56,200 --> 01:07:00,700
It's one of the brilliant moves
and my standup career. Um,

1102
01:07:00,701 --> 01:07:02,860
so anyways,
I'll speak and that shit,

1103
01:07:02,890 --> 01:07:05,080
I'm actually getting myself
into great shape here.

1104
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:08,470
You want to know how I've been
doing it? Well, I don't give a fuck.

1105
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:12,820
I'm going to tell you anyway.
I, uh, I mentioned a back
in the day, I got a juicer.

1106
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:18,010
And, uh, like most things, you
know, when you get something
new, you're all about it.

1107
01:07:18,490 --> 01:07:22,690
You're all about it for like, I don't
know what, right, a week, two weeks,

1108
01:07:22,691 --> 01:07:26,560
maybe a month.
And then one day you just blow it off.

1109
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:30,490
You just fucking blow it off.
And then it starts gathering dust.

1110
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:35,140
And then every once in a while you just
look at whatever you bought your Ipad,

1111
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:38,500
you fucking, I don't know what
you, whatever gadget you had,

1112
01:07:38,501 --> 01:07:41,440
and it's just over there collecting dust.
And he just had that feeling like, God,

1113
01:07:41,441 --> 01:07:44,140
I used to be so fucking into that thing.
You know,

1114
01:07:45,130 --> 01:07:48,730
it's kind of like a relationship.
You know, you meet some hot girl,

1115
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:49,780
you're telling your friends,
dude,

1116
01:07:49,781 --> 01:07:52,510
this one of the hottest fucking
cigs I've ever been with you,

1117
01:07:52,511 --> 01:07:54,700
she's got like the perfect tits.
You have to do that.

1118
01:07:54,940 --> 01:07:59,110
He starts describing a body to all
your fucking animal guy friends.

1119
01:07:59,410 --> 01:08:03,400
And then all of a sudden it turns
into her relationship, you know?

1120
01:08:03,490 --> 01:08:05,170
And now it's your girlfriend.
And now, you know,

1121
01:08:05,171 --> 01:08:09,700
I described the tits to my friends
or the fucking crazy thing,

1122
01:08:09,701 --> 01:08:14,640
she didn't bed, you know, and then
what happened? She's totally into it.

1123
01:08:14,650 --> 01:08:16,190
You're and your bag and you're banging.

1124
01:08:16,191 --> 01:08:19,610
And then just one day
you don't even notice,

1125
01:08:20,990 --> 01:08:23,600
you're just not into it anymore.
Yeah.

1126
01:08:23,610 --> 01:08:26,990
And then one day you're walking by and
you look down at it as your pussy just

1127
01:08:26,991 --> 01:08:27,801
gathering dust,

1128
01:08:27,801 --> 01:08:32,390
like you fucking laser disc player and
you're wondering what the fuck happened.

1129
01:08:33,830 --> 01:08:34,131
You know?

1130
01:08:34,131 --> 01:08:36,890
And that's the moment where you realize
if you're with the right person or not,

1131
01:08:36,891 --> 01:08:40,850
because if you decide that you're going
to work at the relationship and get the

1132
01:08:40,851 --> 01:08:42,830
sparks going again,
you're with the right person.

1133
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:48,650
But if you just looking at it like
a fucking old VCR, yeah, no, it's a,

1134
01:08:48,651 --> 01:08:52,010
it's time to move on. That's
what I think. So anyways,

1135
01:08:52,011 --> 01:08:54,650
let's get back to the juice or everybody.
So the juicer

1136
01:08:56,150 --> 01:09:00,140
evidently is a,
my fucking gadgets soul mate,

1137
01:09:00,141 --> 01:09:02,600
because I looked at it and I was
getting sad going, you know what?

1138
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:05,480
I got a fucking, uh, I got to
get this thing back in my life.

1139
01:09:05,481 --> 01:09:08,450
I've got to find where, where,
where did we lose the magic?

1140
01:09:09,350 --> 01:09:14,350
So I went to the health food store and
I went in there like a little fucking,

1141
01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:19,630
you know Vegan. I fucking go in there.

1142
01:09:19,631 --> 01:09:20,830
Right.
Oh you know what's funny,

1143
01:09:21,190 --> 01:09:23,710
this disc displace right around
the corner from where I live,

1144
01:09:24,430 --> 01:09:29,430
cells that coconut water that I absolutely
love that I drank on Joe Rogan's show

1145
01:09:31,030 --> 01:09:35,930
and that they told me they
got on amazon.com and I
ordered it on amazon.com and

1146
01:09:35,980 --> 01:09:39,150
you know me, I'm totally fucking,
I got the OCD like or whatever. I,

1147
01:09:39,190 --> 01:09:44,190
when I get into shit I get into shit and
it was like 20 something bucks to get

1148
01:09:44,351 --> 01:09:49,210
like, like 12 of these things.
So it was already expensive.

1149
01:09:49,570 --> 01:09:53,080
And then you know, if, if you know,
you just do five to six business days,

1150
01:09:53,081 --> 01:09:55,480
who gives a fuck? They charge you
like three bucks. But I was like, no,

1151
01:09:55,481 --> 01:09:56,800
I want that shit in two days.

1152
01:09:57,280 --> 01:10:02,280
So my shipping cost was as much as
the God damn price of the coconut oil.

1153
01:10:03,060 --> 01:10:05,770
I paid like 40 bucks for 12 of
them and then I go down the street.

1154
01:10:06,210 --> 01:10:09,670
What about when I reintroduced myself
to my juicer going, hey baby, let's,

1155
01:10:09,671 --> 01:10:14,410
you know what happened to us, man.
Let's watch a movie tonight, right?

1156
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:17,140
I go over to the fucking
a vegetable place.

1157
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:20,790
You know what that creepy little
analogy just reminded me of,

1158
01:10:20,791 --> 01:10:23,610
I guess there's some fucking show out
there where people are in love with

1159
01:10:23,611 --> 01:10:28,611
inanimate objects like they actually like
fuck a fence or a bridge or they want

1160
01:10:29,271 --> 01:10:32,910
to like marry the Eiffel Tower. Can
somebody please tell me what that show is?

1161
01:10:32,911 --> 01:10:37,170
I really want to watch that because
I saw that one that was fatal,

1162
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:42,500
fatal attractions where people have wild
animals that they try to turn to to try

1163
01:10:43,771 --> 01:10:45,210
to turn into a,

1164
01:10:48,030 --> 01:10:52,560
they tried to turn it the pets and those
people were just so fucking stupid of

1165
01:10:52,561 --> 01:10:53,760
me that I couldn't watch the show.

1166
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:55,920
But I ended up hearing that that
show was good cause they get,

1167
01:10:56,370 --> 01:11:00,270
they get into the psychology of
of why somebody gets into that.

1168
01:11:00,271 --> 01:11:04,260
All I saw when I saw that guy with the
buffalo walking around his house and

1169
01:11:04,261 --> 01:11:09,180
every time he walked by them that buffalo
would slam into the wall and he looked

1170
01:11:09,181 --> 01:11:14,181
like Wayne Gretzky getting fucking checked
by sort of fucking normal size hockey

1171
01:11:15,241 --> 01:11:16,800
player. And he'd just be like, oh,

1172
01:11:16,890 --> 01:11:20,330
is he would walk by now she just
play and she just playing this shit.

1173
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:23,600
It was so fucking stupid. I
couldn't watch it. So, um,

1174
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:26,160
if anybody can tell me what
the name of that show is,

1175
01:11:26,161 --> 01:11:31,070
where people are like in love
with like a door, you know, dude,

1176
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:35,970
how much alone time are you spending?
I mean, I haven't heard that in jail.

1177
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:40,230
Well he didn't. Solitary confinement.
Do you get love with the walls?

1178
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:44,550
I bet you do. At some
point. Some point you just,

1179
01:11:44,551 --> 01:11:47,490
you just from just lack of human contact,

1180
01:11:48,810 --> 01:11:52,890
you know that man brain kicks in
where you get visually stimulated,

1181
01:11:52,891 --> 01:11:56,700
you gotta get visually stimulated by
something and they would just be like,

1182
01:11:57,990 --> 01:12:02,040
I bet it's like at some point during
the day when the sun starts going down,

1183
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:07,620
right in the shadow of just hits
the wall a certain way and you just,

1184
01:12:07,621 --> 01:12:11,400
there you are. There you are.
You sweet little naughty,

1185
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:15,780
naughty piece of plaster.
Ah,

1186
01:12:15,810 --> 01:12:19,440
well you've been for the last 23 hours.
Shit, I don't want to hear it. You know,

1187
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:24,150
so fucking creepy.
Actually.

1188
01:12:24,151 --> 01:12:27,290
Somebody who's probably in jail or has
been a jail is going to be, oh Mary,

1189
01:12:27,291 --> 01:12:30,990
actually, when you're assault
Jerry confinement, there's
no sunlight. Ah, right.

1190
01:12:30,991 --> 01:12:34,710
Whatever. Whatever the fuck
it is. You fuck the floor,

1191
01:12:36,390 --> 01:12:38,610
you know, there you go. Is
that in any prison book?

1192
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:42,180
I think I hit my low point when I
was consistently fucking the floor.

1193
01:12:43,350 --> 01:12:46,230
Um, all right, let's
continue on here. So anyway,

1194
01:12:46,231 --> 01:12:48,810
so I got my juicer back in my life. That's
what the fuck I'm trying to tell you.

1195
01:12:48,811 --> 01:12:52,250
So I go to the Goddamn health
food store, right. And, uh,

1196
01:12:52,260 --> 01:12:53,910
you know great about going
to the health food stores,

1197
01:12:53,911 --> 01:12:57,720
even though the isles are really skinny,
much skinnier than one of the, uh,

1198
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:00,260
grocery stores. Those fucking, you know,

1199
01:13:00,270 --> 01:13:04,500
people who actually eat healthy or
are there just waif human beings.

1200
01:13:04,530 --> 01:13:08,130
They do yoga, a little wispy Lilach
Lily Nolan's dog's little snippets.

1201
01:13:08,490 --> 01:13:09,540
They just like them,
you know,

1202
01:13:09,541 --> 01:13:12,570
walking up and down the aisles with their
fucking tail between their legs trying

1203
01:13:12,571 --> 01:13:13,530
to pick out Zucchini.

1204
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:18,860
So I'm going in there right
suddenly feeling like I'm
on roids because I look so

1205
01:13:19,471 --> 01:13:22,590
much bigger app full of Shit. There was
a couple of decent size people in that,

1206
01:13:22,591 --> 01:13:25,440
but whatever. So I go in there,
I pick out all this fucking, uh,

1207
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:28,680
fruits and vegetables to juice. So
that's, I've been starting my day.

1208
01:13:28,681 --> 01:13:33,450
People start my day,
I fucking juice.

1209
01:13:34,110 --> 01:13:37,830
Then I go get my fucking pit bull.
We go for a walk,

1210
01:13:37,860 --> 01:13:40,500
we go for a hike for like an hour.

1211
01:13:40,501 --> 01:13:43,320
I come back and then I have
a bowl of oatmeal with some,

1212
01:13:43,410 --> 01:13:44,880
a handful of raisins thrown in there.

1213
01:13:44,881 --> 01:13:47,820
That's how I start my day and
it's been fucking great for me.

1214
01:13:48,390 --> 01:13:49,950
I'm not trying to preach to you people,

1215
01:13:50,070 --> 01:13:53,490
I'm not trying to be a fucking
breakfast Nazi here, but I,

1216
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:54,750
this is what I realized with me,

1217
01:13:54,751 --> 01:13:59,610
this is how I get out of whack is
if I start my day either with, um,

1218
01:14:01,260 --> 01:14:04,500
I can't even just say toast and eggs,
but if I, if I throw the Bacon in there,

1219
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:09,180
then it's really extra salty. Then I
got to throw a little jam on my toast,

1220
01:14:09,181 --> 01:14:12,180
you know, to try to level myself
off. Just like a fucking coke.

1221
01:14:12,181 --> 01:14:16,900
It drinking alcohol to bring me down a
little bit. You know, I got the salt,

1222
01:14:16,901 --> 01:14:18,130
the salt making me sleepy,

1223
01:14:18,131 --> 01:14:21,160
so I put the jelly on the toast
to bring me back up right there.

1224
01:14:21,161 --> 01:14:25,090
I'm out of fucking whack. Or if I have
French toast or anything you put Syrup on,

1225
01:14:25,091 --> 01:14:27,520
then my sugar goes through the roof.
Next thing you know,

1226
01:14:27,521 --> 01:14:31,540
I'm grabbing a handful of
fucking potato chips, you know,

1227
01:14:31,541 --> 01:14:34,630
like an hour later. And then like for
the rest of the day, my blood sugar,

1228
01:14:34,631 --> 01:14:38,140
I don't know what it is. It probably looks
like a, uh, what do you got? One of the,

1229
01:14:38,141 --> 01:14:42,700
one of those things with it,
the heart thing, Sonogram,

1230
01:14:42,701 --> 01:14:45,430
whatever the fuck you call it.
Not a telegraph.

1231
01:14:45,431 --> 01:14:47,710
What do you call that fucking
thing? You know when, when when you,

1232
01:14:47,711 --> 01:14:49,390
when you're laying there in the hospital

1233
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:52,860
and now they're looking at
your heart rate. That's what,

1234
01:14:52,861 --> 01:14:54,750
that's what it looks like.
Salt, sugar, salt, sugar.

1235
01:14:54,751 --> 01:14:57,540
That's what I do for the rest of the
fucking day. Then at the end of the day,

1236
01:14:57,541 --> 01:15:00,630
I take a big piece of cake and I shove
it right down my fucking pie hole and

1237
01:15:00,631 --> 01:15:01,464
that's my day.

1238
01:15:02,130 --> 01:15:07,130
And then gradually my white doughy stomach
starts to hang over my belt and then

1239
01:15:07,921 --> 01:15:12,060
I hate myself and then I start lashing
out at people in the crowd. So,

1240
01:15:12,730 --> 01:15:13,270
okay,

1241
01:15:13,270 --> 01:15:18,040
there you go. That's what's
been working for me. Um,

1242
01:15:18,041 --> 01:15:20,740
so why don't, why don't you guys give
a shot if you want to, if you don't,

1243
01:15:20,770 --> 01:15:24,550
I don't give a fuck. Oh by the
way, 170 days without booze.

1244
01:15:24,790 --> 01:15:26,740
And I actually fucked it up yesterday.

1245
01:15:27,460 --> 01:15:32,460
I was at a party or a barbecue yesterday
and I accidentally twice had two sips

1246
01:15:33,281 --> 01:15:34,114
of beer.

1247
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:35,310
Yeah,

1248
01:15:35,310 --> 01:15:37,530
okay.
So technically in my world,

1249
01:15:37,531 --> 01:15:41,160
my streak is still going because
it was an accident. But I, I've,

1250
01:15:41,490 --> 01:15:45,660
I've had booze within the last 24 hours
and this is, this is what I've noticed.

1251
01:15:45,661 --> 01:15:48,420
What is really fascinating
about the human brain,

1252
01:15:48,570 --> 01:15:51,030
and I didn't realize this
till I went to Stockholm,

1253
01:15:51,031 --> 01:15:53,580
Sweden when I did that Gig over there,
my,

1254
01:15:53,581 --> 01:15:56,910
but I told you that story and it went
over there and everybody, you know,

1255
01:15:56,911 --> 01:15:58,190
and I forgot that,
you know,

1256
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:03,200
I didn't speak a word of Swedish and
everyone's gone highs and tries and cars

1257
01:16:03,450 --> 01:16:05,610
and revising. And I was,
you know, the fucking,

1258
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:09,510
the comedian in front of me who was
speaking English backstage went out there

1259
01:16:09,511 --> 01:16:12,510
and did his whole act and
Swedish and was killing. Oh,

1260
01:16:12,511 --> 01:16:16,050
I just tried to read recharging our
Johari j Tajin and the crowds like,

1261
01:16:17,550 --> 01:16:20,070
and I'm freaking out going and they
even got to fucking understand me.

1262
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:25,400
This is what I learned when I was in
Sweden was I took for granted how much I

1263
01:16:26,251 --> 01:16:30,870
don't read when I'm in the
states because I you just like,

1264
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:34,110
I think when you look at a stop
sign you don't read stop, you just,

1265
01:16:34,140 --> 01:16:38,550
you just visually looking at it and I
didn't realize that shit until I went over

1266
01:16:38,551 --> 01:16:42,870
to Sweden and the amount of extra
thinking that I had to do where I would be

1267
01:16:42,871 --> 01:16:46,410
looking at like a car and just be like,
okay,

1268
01:16:46,411 --> 01:16:49,380
is that a taxi or is that a police car?
You know?

1269
01:16:49,381 --> 01:16:52,500
Or I'd have to look at a
storefront and just sort of try to,

1270
01:16:53,220 --> 01:16:54,630
because I can't read the word.

1271
01:16:55,230 --> 01:16:58,290
It's in Swedish and it's
like 97 fucking letters.

1272
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:03,090
I'd have to just really sit there
looking. Is that close? Is there,

1273
01:17:03,091 --> 01:17:07,590
is there food in there? Is that, what the
fuck is that? That's what happened to me

1274
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:10,033
at the party.

1275
01:17:10,370 --> 01:17:15,370
I open the refrigerator door and I saw
this green can and I immediately equated

1276
01:17:17,571 --> 01:17:20,810
it with soda and I,
and in my brain told me it was a sprite.

1277
01:17:21,860 --> 01:17:25,820
Turned out it was seven up and right
next to it was a red and white can.

1278
01:17:26,660 --> 01:17:30,710
So I think, I actually think it was
just red. So in my world that was coke.

1279
01:17:31,190 --> 01:17:33,440
So I reached for the coke,
opened it up,

1280
01:17:33,441 --> 01:17:38,441
took a sip of it thinking I was drinking
coca cola and it was a Mexican beer and

1281
01:17:39,111 --> 01:17:41,540
I drank and I didn't even record. I
don't know, it was a weird tasting beer.

1282
01:17:41,541 --> 01:17:43,760
I thought it was like ice tea and I
looked down at it and I'm reading it,

1283
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:46,251
you know,
and I actually,

1284
01:17:46,251 --> 01:17:50,270
I'm just looking for coke and I'm looking
all over the words and finally I see

1285
01:17:50,271 --> 01:17:53,510
beer. I'm like, is this, did I just
drink a beer? I was like, fuck,

1286
01:17:53,511 --> 01:17:56,600
there goes my God damn streak.
So of course knee is laughing at me.

1287
01:17:57,860 --> 01:18:01,580
So then I go over and grab what I thought
was a sprite was actually seven up.

1288
01:18:01,581 --> 01:18:04,700
I started drinking that and then
later on in the peanut at the party,

1289
01:18:04,701 --> 01:18:07,550
he grabbed the wrong thing. Once
again, I thought I was drinking coke

1290
01:18:09,050 --> 01:18:10,880
and I reached over and I grabbed it.
Nothing other thing.

1291
01:18:10,910 --> 01:18:14,360
Now the fucking Swig of beer, so I want
you guys to know is my streak over,

1292
01:18:16,150 --> 01:18:19,480
you know all you addicts out there? What
does that mean? If you, if you do that,

1293
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:20,830
if you're an AA,

1294
01:18:21,010 --> 01:18:25,210
do you have to turn in your chip and
start all over again and go up there and

1295
01:18:25,211 --> 01:18:28,030
cry at the podium because you
actually had a sip of beer?

1296
01:18:28,810 --> 01:18:31,570
Do I get any credit with the fact that I,
that I opened the beer,

1297
01:18:31,571 --> 01:18:35,380
took the sip of the beer and just
said, oh fuck, this is, you know,

1298
01:18:35,410 --> 01:18:37,330
I thought this was coke.
It's a beer and I just set it down.

1299
01:18:37,331 --> 01:18:41,260
I didn't have any more anybody.
Can you help me out here?

1300
01:18:41,261 --> 01:18:42,670
This is what I wish I took callers.

1301
01:18:42,910 --> 01:18:45,700
I'm glad I don't take college because
I think color is really slow down the

1302
01:18:45,701 --> 01:18:47,440
fucking show.
You know?

1303
01:18:48,550 --> 01:18:52,690
Half of them are fucking prank phone calls
and then half the people it just take

1304
01:18:52,691 --> 01:18:56,440
some too. God Damn Long. Plus
I like talking. All right.

1305
01:18:56,950 --> 01:19:00,670
You haven't noticed the fact that I rarely
have a guest on this show and I could

1306
01:19:00,671 --> 01:19:04,030
somehow keep it going for a fucking hour.
You know,

1307
01:19:05,710 --> 01:19:10,150
that's not an amazing ability. That's,
that is an incredible personality. Fluff.

1308
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:15,710
All right. Um, more, um,
underrated. Overrated. Uh,

1309
01:19:15,790 --> 01:19:18,280
unpaid internships.
Overrated.

1310
01:19:18,790 --> 01:19:22,660
I graduated from college less than a year
ago and had been looking for a job in

1311
01:19:22,661 --> 01:19:27,340
my area of studies for more than
a year with no success. Dude, I,

1312
01:19:27,370 --> 01:19:30,340
my heart goes out to these fucking kids
just getting out to out of college right

1313
01:19:30,341 --> 01:19:34,210
now and the worst of the worst economies
ever. It's just fucking ridiculous.

1314
01:19:34,211 --> 01:19:38,860
They already overcharged your for your
fucking education and these goddamn

1315
01:19:38,910 --> 01:19:43,540
bankers screwed the whole fucking economy
up. Anyways, plowing ahead. He says,

1316
01:19:43,541 --> 01:19:48,460
while looking for a job, I encountered
numerous agencies that offer internships,

1317
01:19:49,420 --> 01:19:54,370
but no, but none for PE it
seems. How is that legal,

1318
01:19:54,371 --> 01:19:56,200
by the way?
You don't pay him anything.

1319
01:19:56,710 --> 01:20:00,250
It seems like many places take advantages
of the bad economy and the desperate

1320
01:20:00,251 --> 01:20:05,200
job seekers to lure them into doing work
for free. Unfortunately, I'm one of them.

1321
01:20:05,380 --> 01:20:06,820
Dude.
What kind of a fucking,

1322
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:11,460
this is what I want to go undercover
into corporate America and I want to,

1323
01:20:11,610 --> 01:20:16,310
I want to see how that
goes down. How that, how,

1324
01:20:16,450 --> 01:20:21,080
like is it just like the mob boy
you like age, not focus personal,

1325
01:20:21,081 --> 01:20:23,300
it's business.
Oh,

1326
01:20:24,860 --> 01:20:25,693
you know,

1327
01:20:26,450 --> 01:20:30,020
well, if you're, if you check
out the market, what the
market will bear now is, uh,

1328
01:20:30,310 --> 01:20:34,890
it's advantageous if you're
the employer to a nut, uh,

1329
01:20:35,270 --> 01:20:40,270
to take advantage of the human
resources and offer them a,

1330
01:20:42,291 --> 01:20:45,440
a negative cashflow

1331
01:20:46,710 --> 01:20:49,980
contract, however they fucking deal. But
they never just come out and said, hey,

1332
01:20:49,981 --> 01:20:54,390
let's take advantage of the future
and pay them absolutely nothing.

1333
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:59,760
So we can, we can drive, we can put rims
on our, our, our flashy fucking cars.

1334
01:21:00,390 --> 01:21:02,040
Um, anyways, he says, uh,

1335
01:21:02,070 --> 01:21:06,510
what do these agencies offer
an exchange experience,

1336
01:21:06,511 --> 01:21:09,570
building your resume,
making connections with other employees,

1337
01:21:09,780 --> 01:21:14,160
promises of hiring after a short
period and other bullshit like that.

1338
01:21:14,610 --> 01:21:18,780
He says, fuck that in capital letters.
You mentioned in Joe Rogan's podcast,

1339
01:21:18,781 --> 01:21:23,781
how comedians should not
offer their material for free
in exchange for exposure.

1340
01:21:24,030 --> 01:21:25,440
And I completely agree.

1341
01:21:25,710 --> 01:21:30,710
These unpaid internships that are so
popular right now need to stop a more

1342
01:21:31,380 --> 01:21:35,160
efficient than some of my fulltime
coworkers at my internships,

1343
01:21:35,460 --> 01:21:39,460
which are not a surprise.
Oh wait,

1344
01:21:39,461 --> 01:21:43,600
which are not a surprise,
are part of a worker's Union.

1345
01:21:44,710 --> 01:21:47,650
And I work, uh, here comes
my bed reading skills.

1346
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:49,900
I got totally confused
with his parentheses.

1347
01:21:50,790 --> 01:21:51,623
MMM.

1348
01:21:52,110 --> 01:21:55,500
He says, and I worked there
only two days out of the week.

1349
01:21:57,570 --> 01:22:00,700
It wasn't funny. It would be sad. So
he's basically saying in those two days,

1350
01:22:00,701 --> 01:22:03,490
he does more work than the people who
are members of the union. You know,

1351
01:22:03,491 --> 01:22:08,491
that's something that unions have to
address here is I'm all about unions.

1352
01:22:08,561 --> 01:22:09,430
But you know,

1353
01:22:09,431 --> 01:22:13,780
just because you now have the power to
lean on a shovel doesn't mean you should.

1354
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:16,090
And that's what's really fucked over.
Unions.

1355
01:22:16,270 --> 01:22:20,710
Unions were a great idea and people died,
had their heads kicked in,

1356
01:22:20,860 --> 01:22:23,230
got shot at by our own fucking army.

1357
01:22:23,860 --> 01:22:27,790
When guys like Andrew Carnegie had the
connections to bring them in like he did

1358
01:22:27,791 --> 01:22:32,770
there and the fucking banks
of the Allegheny out there
in Pittsburgh or wherever

1359
01:22:32,771 --> 01:22:34,840
the fuck was that.
That's now a mall.

1360
01:22:36,030 --> 01:22:36,863
All right?

1361
01:22:37,910 --> 01:22:40,790
They needed those unions so
we could avoid sweatshop,

1362
01:22:40,820 --> 01:22:44,720
the sweatshop labor conditions
that existed in this country.

1363
01:22:44,721 --> 01:22:49,220
And then what happened aside from the map,
the mob taken over those things.

1364
01:22:49,221 --> 01:22:51,620
What happened is his guys used the unions,

1365
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:56,680
the power of unions as a way to get over
fucking paid and not to bust their ass

1366
01:22:57,021 --> 01:22:57,771
at work anymore.

1367
01:22:57,771 --> 01:23:01,430
So then they became the exact fucking
thing that they were rebelling against.

1368
01:23:01,431 --> 01:23:06,390
So I understand why corporations
move. They're fucking, um,

1369
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:07,970
yeah.

1370
01:23:07,970 --> 01:23:09,440
Companies out of this country.

1371
01:23:10,070 --> 01:23:12,910
I also understand why that there had
to be union said, you know, this,

1372
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:16,490
this is what it always comes down
to is people are people rich.

1373
01:23:16,491 --> 01:23:20,000
People aren't the only greedy fucking
assholes out there. It, you know,

1374
01:23:20,030 --> 01:23:21,320
middle class and poor people,

1375
01:23:21,321 --> 01:23:24,110
if you put them in a position
where they can be greedy.

1376
01:23:24,350 --> 01:23:29,060
The sad thing is most people will
take advantage of this situation.

1377
01:23:29,420 --> 01:23:33,290
This is not these, and these
are not unique theories.
This is the overall theory,

1378
01:23:33,770 --> 01:23:36,260
harsh theory that most
people learn when they get,

1379
01:23:36,290 --> 01:23:39,050
when they get out of their house
and they get into the real world.

1380
01:23:39,051 --> 01:23:42,680
You realize that most people are cons.
There's very few good people out there,

1381
01:23:42,730 --> 01:23:44,960
poor middle class or fucking rich,

1382
01:23:44,990 --> 01:23:48,080
this very few people that will
actually do the right thing. So, uh,

1383
01:23:48,081 --> 01:23:51,770
I 100% agree with that. It would
be, you know, speaking of unions,

1384
01:23:51,771 --> 01:23:55,940
it would be great if you could
somehow start one. You know,

1385
01:23:55,941 --> 01:23:58,880
that's what she needs to do is you need
to get everybody on the same page and

1386
01:23:58,881 --> 01:24:01,310
say, listen, we're not saying
you got to give us all of us,

1387
01:24:01,311 --> 01:24:05,930
but this fucking working
for free is ridiculous. Um,

1388
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:09,500
yeah, they're totally
taken advantage of you, um,

1389
01:24:09,620 --> 01:24:13,430
because of the market.
But I guess if it's a good market,

1390
01:24:14,390 --> 01:24:18,270
you guys can take advantage of
them. I Dunno, man. It's just so,

1391
01:24:18,290 --> 01:24:19,670
I don't know who the fuck knows,

1392
01:24:19,671 --> 01:24:22,370
but I definitely that there's just
something wrong with having kids work for

1393
01:24:22,371 --> 01:24:24,530
fucking free.
All right.

1394
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:27,500
And I will say to people
who were in unions,

1395
01:24:27,501 --> 01:24:30,560
which I am 100 supported in support of,

1396
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:34,940
you motherfuckers need to work
harder and you'll have a better,

1397
01:24:35,450 --> 01:24:40,170
um, you'll have a better public image.
Now I'm not saying everybody in unions,

1398
01:24:40,171 --> 01:24:42,210
don't you know they all
have them lean on shovels,

1399
01:24:42,211 --> 01:24:45,690
but you know why you got that
reputation. Okay, I'm Irish.

1400
01:24:45,810 --> 01:24:49,840
I know we got why we got the reputation
for being a bunch of drunk motherfuckers

1401
01:24:49,860 --> 01:24:52,020
because so many of us are,

1402
01:24:52,650 --> 01:24:57,650
or at least enough of us got so fucking
drunk that we completely wiped out any

1403
01:24:57,911 --> 01:25:02,410
sort of good Irishman out there. All
right, so there you go. Ah, another one.

1404
01:25:02,420 --> 01:25:03,940
Documentaries underrated.

1405
01:25:04,150 --> 01:25:06,970
In the last few months I've
become a big fan of documentaries,

1406
01:25:06,971 --> 01:25:11,830
especially about co are corrupted economy
are fucked up culture and our diet,

1407
01:25:11,890 --> 01:25:13,780
a dying planet and environment.

1408
01:25:14,050 --> 01:25:18,190
I have to say these films put a really
great picture as far as our civilization

1409
01:25:18,191 --> 01:25:20,320
goes. Yeah, I know. That's why
I kind of stopped watching them.

1410
01:25:21,070 --> 01:25:23,470
I just try to do the right
thing in my own life. If I,

1411
01:25:23,471 --> 01:25:27,260
if I watch too many of those, they
really depressed the shit out of me. MMM.

1412
01:25:28,140 --> 01:25:30,960
The president has already looked bad
and I did not see a way we can dig

1413
01:25:30,961 --> 01:25:32,670
ourselves out of this
hole that we've created.

1414
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:35,610
I just don't understand why people
dismiss these types of films.

1415
01:25:35,790 --> 01:25:39,240
Are they trying to avoid the painful
truth? Absolutely. I just said I was,

1416
01:25:39,480 --> 01:25:43,170
are they in denial? Absolutely. There
are ways and solutions to fix it,

1417
01:25:43,380 --> 01:25:46,770
but as long as we have, uh,
democrats versus Republicans,

1418
01:25:46,771 --> 01:25:49,590
white versus blacks
versus versus Hispanics,

1419
01:25:49,830 --> 01:25:53,700
coal and oil energy first,
uh,

1420
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:58,770
clean energy and most importantly
fucking paper money and stock markets,

1421
01:25:58,771 --> 01:26:00,790
nothing's going to change.
Yeah. This guy, this is,

1422
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:04,610
this is the exact conclusion that I came.
Um,

1423
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:08,360
although I don't agree that a lot of the
clean energy they say is clean energy.

1424
01:26:08,361 --> 01:26:11,660
Like as much as I drive a hybrid,
which is really a scam,

1425
01:26:11,661 --> 01:26:15,950
it's only an electric car when it's
going five miles an hour under.

1426
01:26:16,010 --> 01:26:18,350
Other than that,
it's just an underpowered gas car,

1427
01:26:18,351 --> 01:26:22,160
but it does burn clean and it
does get great gas mileage.

1428
01:26:22,700 --> 01:26:25,370
But you know, electric cars,
I mean those batteries,

1429
01:26:25,910 --> 01:26:30,260
eventually you have to dispose of those.
And those things. Recap. Basically,

1430
01:26:30,261 --> 01:26:33,470
human beings in general wreak
havoc on the environment.

1431
01:26:33,471 --> 01:26:38,471
So I think the solution is you have to
have some sort of population control and

1432
01:26:39,051 --> 01:26:42,920
they should do it sooner rather than
later because if they did it sooner,

1433
01:26:43,010 --> 01:26:48,010
we could avoid some sort of Stalin s
slash Hitler solution because that's what

1434
01:26:48,171 --> 01:26:50,570
the fuck they're going to do.
Um,

1435
01:26:50,630 --> 01:26:55,630
I think the problem with human beings is
we treat global problems the same way,

1436
01:26:56,390 --> 01:27:01,190
which a college kid treats doing a
term paper. We do it the night before.

1437
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:02,713
You know,

1438
01:27:02,850 --> 01:27:07,160
remember y two K we knew that shit was
coming and ended up not being a fucking

1439
01:27:07,161 --> 01:27:09,920
problem, but everybody panicked.
And the final two months,

1440
01:27:09,921 --> 01:27:13,010
they were talking about it for 10 years
that we were going to have this possibly

1441
01:27:13,011 --> 01:27:16,760
have this fucking problem. And we
waited until the last fucking second.

1442
01:27:16,761 --> 01:27:19,430
And I think that the population
problem is going to be the same thing.

1443
01:27:19,700 --> 01:27:22,460
The prop this too many fucking people.
This note,

1444
01:27:22,461 --> 01:27:25,760
there's nothing wrong
with chopping down trees.

1445
01:27:25,910 --> 01:27:27,860
There's nothing wrong with using coal.

1446
01:27:27,950 --> 01:27:29,930
There's nothing wrong
with driving a big car.

1447
01:27:29,931 --> 01:27:32,470
There's nothing wrong with any of that.
The problem is,

1448
01:27:32,471 --> 01:27:36,500
is that the 7 billion people on the
fucking planet, that that's a problem.

1449
01:27:37,380 --> 01:27:41,510
All right? We need to get that number
way the fuck down, whey the fuck down.

1450
01:27:41,511 --> 01:27:46,390
I would say under a billion under a
billion people, you need to do that.

1451
01:27:46,391 --> 01:27:50,480
So I think that you should just implement
laws, the amount of people that, uh,

1452
01:27:50,530 --> 01:27:53,860
kids that you can have. And
I also think that, you know,

1453
01:27:55,310 --> 01:27:58,580
you should offer people money if they,
to not have kids,

1454
01:27:59,540 --> 01:28:02,750
uh,
adopt kids recycle.

1455
01:28:03,410 --> 01:28:06,320
I think that they should do all of that
type of stuff while they tried to have

1456
01:28:06,321 --> 01:28:11,321
cleaner burning cars and that type of
shit and just gradually let people kind of

1457
01:28:11,991 --> 01:28:12,824
die off.

1458
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:15,113
You know,

1459
01:28:16,340 --> 01:28:19,230
I, I, that's, that's what I feel.
You know, cause if you don't do that,

1460
01:28:19,231 --> 01:28:23,610
then eventually, um, I think that
we're going to run out of food,

1461
01:28:23,611 --> 01:28:27,420
run out of clean water and you're
going to have the rich in their gated

1462
01:28:27,421 --> 01:28:31,620
communities and they're going to be
guarded by the black water people and that

1463
01:28:31,621 --> 01:28:34,830
is going to be shooting out the rest of
us in their fucking heads, in our heads.

1464
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:38,460
That's what I think's going to
happen personally, you know,

1465
01:28:39,060 --> 01:28:43,290
if mother nature doesn't get us first.
All right. That was uplifting. All right,

1466
01:28:43,291 --> 01:28:46,650
let's get to, uh, let's get to
advice for the week. Um, Bill,

1467
01:28:47,370 --> 01:28:52,080
year and a half ago, um, where the
hell am I? A year and a half ago,

1468
01:28:52,590 --> 01:28:56,700
me and this girl that I used to work
with were hanging out a lot and fooling

1469
01:28:56,701 --> 01:29:00,690
around all summer. Very nice. It
was pretty casual. There you go.

1470
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:05,760
That's how you set it up. It's pretty
casual. Wonderful. Now I think it just,

1471
01:29:05,761 --> 01:29:10,200
the artists trying to keep it there and
as I've told you before, what that is,

1472
01:29:10,201 --> 01:29:10,680
it's the,

1473
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:15,210
it's the time between you hooking up okay.

1474
01:29:16,620 --> 01:29:18,510
When you keep it a casual
and that type of shit.

1475
01:29:18,511 --> 01:29:21,540
If you want to hang out and have drinks,
that's fine.

1476
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:25,080
But when you get back to your place,
you do the deed and that's it.

1477
01:29:25,081 --> 01:29:27,180
She's got to go.
You can't hang out and watch a movie.

1478
01:29:27,181 --> 01:29:30,960
That's when they start getting feelings.
It's not fair to the female, you know,

1479
01:29:31,170 --> 01:29:33,750
that's what you gotta do.
Don't call him all the fucking time.

1480
01:29:33,751 --> 01:29:37,020
You gotta keep it fucking
casual. All right. Continuing,

1481
01:29:37,050 --> 01:29:40,320
which is kind of hard to do when you
work with them. Um, but anyways, he goes,

1482
01:29:40,321 --> 01:29:41,141
it was pretty casual,

1483
01:29:41,141 --> 01:29:44,760
but that was only because we both
knew I had to leave in August,

1484
01:29:44,761 --> 01:29:49,370
so we made a point to not get
too sir. Serious. Beautiful. Um,

1485
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:52,500
once the summer ended,
I had to go back to school in Miami.

1486
01:29:52,501 --> 01:29:55,770
So our situation kind of ended, but
we stayed in touch. Then recently,

1487
01:29:55,771 --> 01:29:57,180
this last spring break,

1488
01:29:57,330 --> 01:30:00,600
I went home for 10 days when I let
her know I was going to be in town.

1489
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:03,390
She said that, uh, that
we had to hang out,

1490
01:30:03,570 --> 01:30:07,170
but only his friends because she had
a boyfriend, which I was fine with.

1491
01:30:07,650 --> 01:30:12,090
All right, dude. Now I haven't read this
one yet, but I got to tell you right here,

1492
01:30:12,930 --> 01:30:17,440
uh, don't hang out with, they're
more than once. All right?

1493
01:30:17,530 --> 01:30:22,150
This is what you should do
in that situation. She's
got a boyfriend. It's over.

1494
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:27,100
All right. So if she wants to hang
out, hang out in a public place,

1495
01:30:27,220 --> 01:30:31,060
and at the end of the night you say
you gotta go, don't bring up sex.

1496
01:30:31,330 --> 01:30:35,890
Don't fucking do anything like what
you used to do. She's got a boyfriend.

1497
01:30:35,891 --> 01:30:39,300
He got to walk away from that situation.
Not to mention if you,

1498
01:30:39,370 --> 01:30:41,320
the two of you are just
hanging out in any moment.

1499
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:45,640
Her boyfriend could walk in and you could
get the old fucking clattering to the

1500
01:30:45,641 --> 01:30:49,150
side of the fucking head. Uh, anyways,

1501
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:55,290
so the first day I was there, she came
over to my house to hang out. Okay,

1502
01:30:55,291 --> 01:30:58,890
that's a, that's a red flag right there.
She's got a boyfriend. You come to town,

1503
01:30:58,891 --> 01:31:02,220
she immediately drops her boyfriend. It
comes to hang out with you. All right.

1504
01:31:02,250 --> 01:31:06,780
After a half hour of that
awkward catching up conversation,

1505
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:09,630
we went up to my room to watch a movie.

1506
01:31:10,410 --> 01:31:13,890
Oh Jeez.
Once the movie started,

1507
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:17,130
she made sure to drive home.
Uh,

1508
01:31:17,470 --> 01:31:21,930
the fact that I should make a move on
her because she's with someone else. Yes.

1509
01:31:21,931 --> 01:31:25,800
See right here, dude. She's playing
with your Dick. She slapping it around,

1510
01:31:25,801 --> 01:31:29,340
making it go up, and then
she's going, hey, hey, hey,
hey. We got to take it easy.

1511
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:32,880
And then it goes back down again. She's
fucking with you. She's fucking with you.

1512
01:31:32,881 --> 01:31:36,030
She's playing the up and down game from
the Opie and Anthony Show with your Dick.

1513
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:39,630
If you guys haven't seen that yet, I'm
telling you, look that up on Youtube,

1514
01:31:39,660 --> 01:31:41,190
the OPIOD,
Anthony up and down game.

1515
01:31:41,610 --> 01:31:45,750
It's one of the most genius bits of ever
seen. Fucking hilarious. Um, anyways,

1516
01:31:46,830 --> 01:31:51,330
I completely disregarded this. Oh, so she
tells you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let me get,

1517
01:31:51,331 --> 01:31:54,510
let me go back here.
I really have to drop my commentary here.

1518
01:31:54,511 --> 01:31:56,660
Why don't we just read the rest here.
Um,

1519
01:31:56,670 --> 01:31:59,240
so the movie starts and she drives home
the point that they shouldn't. Yeah,

1520
01:31:59,241 --> 01:32:02,470
he shouldn't make a move on her because
she's, she is with somebody else.

1521
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:07,060
So he says, I completely disregard this
and I put my arm around her anyways,

1522
01:32:07,450 --> 01:32:09,010
10 minutes into the movie,

1523
01:32:11,290 --> 01:32:15,010
you know what I respect that move. By
the way, 10 minutes into the movie,

1524
01:32:15,250 --> 01:32:20,050
we're in a full on cuddle and she's
doing that shit where she's running her

1525
01:32:20,051 --> 01:32:22,150
finger up and down my arm.

1526
01:32:22,870 --> 01:32:27,340
Then out of nowhere she flips around
and climbs on top of me with that.

1527
01:32:27,341 --> 01:32:31,210
Fuck me looking arise. Dude,
this is a great story. She even,

1528
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:35,560
she's even doing that preset, slightly
heavy breathing dude, I'm not,

1529
01:32:35,590 --> 01:32:38,710
I haven't read this. I'm telling you
she's going to pull the emergency chute.

1530
01:32:40,210 --> 01:32:44,260
This is the Richard Pryor bit where they
went to your dick is hard enough to cut

1531
01:32:44,261 --> 01:32:47,410
diamonds, I believe is how
Richard put it. Or Mr Pryor.

1532
01:32:47,470 --> 01:32:51,940
Let me have some fucking respect here.
Saying Richard, like I know the guy. Um,

1533
01:32:52,990 --> 01:32:57,990
she drops in to start kissing me but stops
an inch from my mouth and stays there

1534
01:32:59,261 --> 01:33:03,430
for a second or two. Then she climbs
off and goes back to cuddling.

1535
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:08,680
Uh, you know what dude, you're
young. You didn't know any better,

1536
01:33:08,681 --> 01:33:12,880
but if you are older, you,
you set yourself up for this.

1537
01:33:13,090 --> 01:33:16,150
After recollecting myself,
I started to say something,

1538
01:33:16,300 --> 01:33:20,470
but the second I started talking,
she flipped over and did it again.

1539
01:33:21,730 --> 01:33:23,470
But for a bit longer this time,

1540
01:33:23,500 --> 01:33:28,390
this time I asked her what the fuck
she was doing and she giggled. Cunt.

1541
01:33:29,590 --> 01:33:32,650
Yeah. Dude, right there,
man. This is the thing.

1542
01:33:32,830 --> 01:33:34,870
You got to take charge of the situation.

1543
01:33:35,230 --> 01:33:38,110
You got to tell you a dick to
stand down and be like, look,

1544
01:33:39,310 --> 01:33:41,460
either we're going to do this or
we're not going to do this. This is,

1545
01:33:41,560 --> 01:33:44,770
I actually think at that point you should
have just bounced around in there and

1546
01:33:44,771 --> 01:33:47,620
rubbed one out. That's the
power move right there, man.

1547
01:33:47,770 --> 01:33:51,250
That's the move that's going to make
you feel better than if even fucked her

1548
01:33:51,251 --> 01:33:54,280
because she's still going to get something
out of it. She got to get laid right.

1549
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:57,970
So fuck that. You should have kicked
her out right there and just been like,

1550
01:33:57,971 --> 01:34:00,790
you know what? This was a bad idea.
Shut this off. You have to go.

1551
01:34:00,850 --> 01:34:04,240
You shouldn't be doing this. You have
a boyfriend. See, you flip it around.

1552
01:34:04,241 --> 01:34:08,290
You put the guilt on her. She leaves
you fucking rub one out. Right?

1553
01:34:08,440 --> 01:34:11,680
Then you don't give a shit that you didn't
bang her and then you fucking go out

1554
01:34:11,681 --> 01:34:15,330
to the local watering hole. You know,
you've got to run into some chick.

1555
01:34:15,331 --> 01:34:18,400
He went to fucking high school with
your little older, a little more manly.

1556
01:34:18,401 --> 01:34:22,060
You get the scruff going and you
fucking tag her and fuck this girl.

1557
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:27,010
She is a con. She has a boyfriend. She
shouldn't be doing this shit. All right,

1558
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:31,900
let's continue. Um, where the
hell was I? Uh, this time though,

1559
01:34:31,901 --> 01:34:35,860
she stayed, she did it for about
four full 30 seconds. Okay. So,

1560
01:34:35,861 --> 01:34:39,430
so we went back to cuddling for the
next five minutes until she did it for a

1561
01:34:39,431 --> 01:34:41,650
third time.
This time though,

1562
01:34:41,770 --> 01:34:44,770
she stayed there for about
30 seconds and she wouldn't,

1563
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:48,190
and she would pull back
every time I actually

1564
01:34:50,170 --> 01:34:53,800
kissed her so that she
kept the inch between us.

1565
01:34:54,070 --> 01:34:56,950
Once she got off,
she started that giggling again,

1566
01:34:57,270 --> 01:35:01,830
which by then had gone from cute annoying
as hell and then slipped her shoes on

1567
01:35:02,010 --> 01:35:05,280
and said she had to go see,
don't,

1568
01:35:05,850 --> 01:35:08,520
if you took charge and one of those
you could have bounced her out.

1569
01:35:09,450 --> 01:35:12,780
We didn't hang out again after that.
And now I'm back in Miami.

1570
01:35:12,990 --> 01:35:16,140
I guess my question is what should I
have done? I guess I already answered it.

1571
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:19,260
And what the fuck was she doing?
Any answer would be great.

1572
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:22,740
Or even a rant about those annoying teas
and cons. Thanks. Well, you know what,

1573
01:35:22,741 --> 01:35:26,400
dude, I hadn't read this one. I
was a busy this week in my, uh,

1574
01:35:27,060 --> 01:35:28,680
the guy who helps me with my podcast,

1575
01:35:28,710 --> 01:35:30,600
we will remain nameless
because that's how I do it.

1576
01:35:30,601 --> 01:35:32,490
Sent me this thing and
I'm a little late today.

1577
01:35:32,491 --> 01:35:37,170
So what's the first time I read it? Um,
yeah, that's what she was doing. She just,

1578
01:35:37,171 --> 01:35:38,004
I don't know,

1579
01:35:38,330 --> 01:35:43,260
you'd almost have to ask a female to get
into the psychology of it, but I could,

1580
01:35:43,380 --> 01:35:48,060
I guess like I think
that, I don't know. Does,

1581
01:35:48,130 --> 01:35:51,720
does she want to just see that you
still want to fuck her and that, like,

1582
01:35:51,870 --> 01:35:55,590
I can tell you this right now that her
relationship with this other guy isn't

1583
01:35:55,591 --> 01:36:00,250
going to work and she has major
fucking not major. She's gay.

1584
01:36:00,270 --> 01:36:04,950
She's either really immature or eventually
she has major issues and she'll fuck

1585
01:36:04,951 --> 01:36:07,650
up every relationship
by doing shit like this.

1586
01:36:07,651 --> 01:36:12,570
And eventually she's going to be that
old hottie hanging out at the wine bar,

1587
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:15,840
you know, with the crow's feet
around our eyes, you know,

1588
01:36:16,290 --> 01:36:17,670
you know that Szyk she'll just send me,

1589
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:21,630
ended up being that girl and then we'll
look back in regret at all the good guys

1590
01:36:21,631 --> 01:36:25,730
that she fucking, Dick teased as she
was playing the fucking field. But um,

1591
01:36:25,950 --> 01:36:27,390
this is what you do in the future.

1592
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:30,270
The second a girl is
doing some shit like that.

1593
01:36:31,350 --> 01:36:34,860
The second she said,
listen, just so you know,

1594
01:36:35,670 --> 01:36:39,930
I have a boyfriend, we can't be doing
this. You should have said, you know what?

1595
01:36:39,931 --> 01:36:41,880
You're right.
Let's not watch a movie

1596
01:36:43,650 --> 01:36:48,390
and right then you kick her out
so you have some sort of power.

1597
01:36:48,890 --> 01:36:52,230
All right?
And if you want to fuck a girl like that,

1598
01:36:52,290 --> 01:36:54,000
you should have been the one saying no.

1599
01:36:54,030 --> 01:36:56,940
You should have been the one
pushing her off. All right?

1600
01:36:56,941 --> 01:37:01,920
Because it sounds like she
has that fucking thing where
you know she gets off on

1601
01:37:01,921 --> 01:37:04,860
the fact that you want our
but can't have her. All right?

1602
01:37:04,920 --> 01:37:08,130
So if you're acting like you don't want
her, that fucks with her head like,

1603
01:37:08,131 --> 01:37:10,440
wait a minute,
what am I losing my pussy power?

1604
01:37:11,220 --> 01:37:14,790
And you just literally back
your way into the fucking boat.

1605
01:37:15,090 --> 01:37:17,280
Then you clubber over their
head and then there you go.

1606
01:37:17,340 --> 01:37:20,970
You got your fish in the boat.
All right? That's how you do that.

1607
01:37:20,971 --> 01:37:23,420
But I got to tell you in the future,
do chicks like data?

1608
01:37:23,430 --> 01:37:25,140
Just a complete fucking waste of time.

1609
01:37:25,290 --> 01:37:29,370
You're already banged her so you're
already dotted all the i's crossed all the

1610
01:37:29,371 --> 01:37:33,600
t's. What the fuck are you still
doing your there because it's an easy,

1611
01:37:33,630 --> 01:37:36,240
you thought it was an easy
fucking lay when you got back,

1612
01:37:36,241 --> 01:37:37,440
which is understandable.
Okay.

1613
01:37:37,441 --> 01:37:40,170
But the problem is is you don't
have your Dick and check you.

1614
01:37:40,171 --> 01:37:44,160
Dick is running your fucking life. You
got to make the decisions. All right?

1615
01:37:44,190 --> 01:37:47,550
And when you fucking do that, you
start winning those a lot more. See,

1616
01:37:47,551 --> 01:37:49,590
women have their pussies in check.

1617
01:37:50,580 --> 01:37:53,400
That's why they always win those
battles 90% of the fucking time.

1618
01:37:53,401 --> 01:37:54,210
So there you go.

1619
01:37:54,210 --> 01:37:56,740
That's the little information that
I can help you with what I see.

1620
01:37:56,780 --> 01:37:58,110
But like I said,
don't ever,

1621
01:37:58,140 --> 01:38:03,060
don't ever be afraid to fucking ask a
female for advice on stuff like that.

1622
01:38:03,090 --> 01:38:04,770
Not only will they give you advice,

1623
01:38:04,771 --> 01:38:07,980
they actually enjoy doing it and
they'll have way better advice than I do

1624
01:38:07,981 --> 01:38:12,750
because uh, you know, cause they were
fucking woman. You know what I mean?

1625
01:38:13,130 --> 01:38:15,840
It's like you calling me, you're asking
a plumber about fucking carpentry.

1626
01:38:15,870 --> 01:38:19,920
Go to a carpenter. All right. That is the
podcast for this week. I hope you guys,

1627
01:38:19,921 --> 01:38:24,870
uh, hope you guys enjoyed it.
Seemed like a fairly smooth
one. Right? Um, let, let me,

1628
01:38:24,871 --> 01:38:28,470
can I whore out some dates here? People,
can you hang with me this long enough?

1629
01:38:29,010 --> 01:38:33,720
Huh? Well maybe you're going to hang with
me cause you're on final approach. Oh,

1630
01:38:33,721 --> 01:38:37,230
you know what? I can't stand. This
is what happened me the other day.

1631
01:38:37,231 --> 01:38:41,460
I went out to go buy a my fucking water
cooler that I want to have just in case

1632
01:38:41,461 --> 01:38:42,630
of tsunami hits out here.

1633
01:38:42,631 --> 01:38:45,720
Cause I live on a fault line and I
always want to have at least five to 10

1634
01:38:45,721 --> 01:38:48,180
gallons of water.
You know,

1635
01:38:48,570 --> 01:38:51,000
I'm already inland enough with
the tsunamis not going to hit.

1636
01:38:51,570 --> 01:38:55,860
If a tsunami hits me here, I'm telling
you, Utah's in trouble. All right,

1637
01:38:56,310 --> 01:39:00,870
so I go to Lowe's hardware,
I go there online,

1638
01:39:00,900 --> 01:39:05,460
I look up to see if they have the
one that I want and that, you know,

1639
01:39:05,640 --> 01:39:06,630
and Lowe's has it.

1640
01:39:07,560 --> 01:39:11,190
So rather than just saying
they only have it online,

1641
01:39:11,730 --> 01:39:13,470
I'm assuming it's at the fucking store.

1642
01:39:14,670 --> 01:39:16,740
So I jumped in my car and I
drive over there and they,

1643
01:39:16,741 --> 01:39:21,420
they don't fucking have it. They don't
fucking have it. And it's just, you know,

1644
01:39:22,350 --> 01:39:23,490
just fucking drove me nuts.

1645
01:39:23,491 --> 01:39:27,090
So then I stop off at sporting good
store to buy a pump because my football

1646
01:39:27,091 --> 01:39:28,080
doesn't have any air in it.

1647
01:39:28,081 --> 01:39:32,280
And this is what you do at 42 when you
don't have any fucking kids, you know,

1648
01:39:32,460 --> 01:39:35,850
you actually, you, you're still acting
like you fucking 14. So I dunno,

1649
01:39:36,420 --> 01:39:39,660
I just had that moment when I went into
the sporting goods store. You know,

1650
01:39:40,860 --> 01:39:42,720
I hate when they can't fucking help me.

1651
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:47,610
I'm asking a simple question and then
I start to flip out and then they just

1652
01:39:47,611 --> 01:39:52,390
call me sir a million
fucking times. You know, sir,

1653
01:39:52,391 --> 01:39:54,330
I'm sorry sir, but it
sure. Could you sure.

1654
01:39:54,331 --> 01:39:58,140
Could you please nudge sharing this
year please sir. Thank you sir.

1655
01:39:58,200 --> 01:40:02,760
That fucking shit. That's what
reminds me of, of flying on the plane.

1656
01:40:02,761 --> 01:40:05,250
If you do anything,
if you have your seat backs here,

1657
01:40:05,251 --> 01:40:08,350
could you please put your seat back
ups here. Thank you, sir. Sure.

1658
01:40:08,351 --> 01:40:11,280
In order to expedite this series
here. Could you please, sir,

1659
01:40:12,430 --> 01:40:14,230
I fucking hate that.
And I that,

1660
01:40:14,231 --> 01:40:18,280
that you know what I do then I
through gritted teeth, just say ma'am.

1661
01:40:18,281 --> 01:40:21,310
Back a hundred times. I'm sorry ma'am.
Yes ma'am. Thank you ma'am. Ma'Am,

1662
01:40:21,311 --> 01:40:24,910
could you stop Mami? Me
Man. You fucking cunt ma'am.

1663
01:40:25,930 --> 01:40:26,680
I'm sorry.

1664
01:40:26,680 --> 01:40:29,590
That's a little bit of fucking half an
ounce of rage I had to get out there.

1665
01:40:29,590 --> 01:40:32,590
Let me get back to hype and my dates
here. So anyways, this week, oh,

1666
01:40:32,591 --> 01:40:37,120
what a week I have, I'm going to be
at the record theater for two shows.

1667
01:40:37,121 --> 01:40:41,020
I believe the second show is already sold
out. So, uh, if you want to get tickets,

1668
01:40:41,021 --> 01:40:42,830
you better fucking hustle there.
Ah,

1669
01:40:42,970 --> 01:40:45,940
you fucking conscious the Goddamn
Internet work, not working in this room.

1670
01:40:47,320 --> 01:40:51,010
You know, I really need to
step my life up. I'm, I'm at
the record theater at this,

1671
01:40:51,011 --> 01:40:55,510
uh, this Friday, April 8th for two shows.

1672
01:40:56,080 --> 01:40:58,300
I believe they're like eight
and 10 are eight and 10 30.

1673
01:40:58,301 --> 01:41:01,380
I don't know what the fuck they are. Am
My God damn website won't come up. Um,

1674
01:41:01,420 --> 01:41:06,400
that's in, uh, Baltimore outside of
Baltimore, Maryland. And on Friday night,

1675
01:41:06,430 --> 01:41:10,360
I'm at the Tower Tower Theater
in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

1676
01:41:11,590 --> 01:41:16,360
Later on this month, uh, I got two more
shows. One is in Milwaukee, Wisconsin,

1677
01:41:16,361 --> 01:41:20,050
April 22nd at the Pabst theater.
Um,

1678
01:41:20,140 --> 01:41:22,120
unbelievable response by the way.

1679
01:41:22,121 --> 01:41:24,460
I want to thank everybody
beforehand in Milwaukee.

1680
01:41:24,490 --> 01:41:27,070
Maybe that's why I had the Laverne
and Shirley Song in my head.

1681
01:41:27,580 --> 01:41:30,070
Isn't that where that show was based at?
Um,

1682
01:41:30,110 --> 01:41:33,490
and they also worked at a beer factory.
It's all coming full circle.

1683
01:41:33,670 --> 01:41:36,910
And on the 23rd, I'll be at the, uh,

1684
01:41:36,911 --> 01:41:41,170
Royal Oak Theater in
Detroit, Michigan. Um,

1685
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:43,750
both of those dates are
selling unbelievably well.

1686
01:41:43,751 --> 01:41:47,050
Both of them are going to sell out,
so get your tickets as soon as you can.

1687
01:41:47,920 --> 01:41:51,550
And uh, I want to thank everybody
there for it. Like I've, I have not,

1688
01:41:51,610 --> 01:41:56,410

have not played Detroit since I did.

1689
01:41:56,470 --> 01:42:00,760

Chappelle show tour back in.

done like kickers and that type of stuff

1692
01:42:06,011 --> 01:42:09,040

I haven't been in Detroit so, um,

1693
01:42:10,190 --> 01:42:12,020

I have no idea.

1694
01:42:12,350 --> 01:42:15,050

is actually sold out.

Jay Miller,

1711
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:20,120
one of my favorite enforcers
of the Boston Bruins is in, uh,

1712
01:43:20,121 --> 01:43:22,010
is in the hospital
recovering from pneumonia.

1713
01:43:22,310 --> 01:43:25,950
Just want to send him a
get well soon wishes. Uh,

1714
01:43:25,951 --> 01:43:29,300
one of my favorites and a, we're
going to send a link, a youtube video.

1715
01:43:29,660 --> 01:43:32,720
We got some great youtube videos this
week. I almost forgot about those. Uh,

1716
01:43:32,750 --> 01:43:35,240
we're going to have one of Jay Miller
holding his own against the greatest of

1717
01:43:35,241 --> 01:43:38,450
all time for my money.
Bob Probert and a,

1718
01:43:38,451 --> 01:43:42,710
what are the youtube videos for this
week? Oh, we got some good ones.

1719
01:43:43,640 --> 01:43:47,350
I got one from that show. Cheaters. You
don't, let's show cheaters where they got,

1720
01:43:47,370 --> 01:43:50,990
you know, they basically, uh, somebody
thinks that somebody is cheating on him.

1721
01:43:51,140 --> 01:43:52,070
Then what do they do?
They get,

1722
01:43:52,071 --> 01:43:54,950
they hired this company and they start
spying on the boyfriend and girlfriend.

1723
01:43:54,951 --> 01:43:57,080
And when they confirmed that
they are in fact cheating,

1724
01:43:57,290 --> 01:43:59,960
they show up and confront them.

1725
01:43:59,961 --> 01:44:04,100
And this is one of the greatest ones I've
ever seen. They confront this kid at a,

1726
01:44:04,110 --> 01:44:07,730
at an ice rink after he just
played a hockey game. And you know,

1727
01:44:07,731 --> 01:44:11,090
usually the person who's cheating,
you know the dude is absolutely stunned.

1728
01:44:11,120 --> 01:44:13,640
This guy handles it absolutely perfectly.

1729
01:44:14,750 --> 01:44:18,260
He fucking breaks up with her. She
shows up. She's like, you know,

1730
01:44:18,261 --> 01:44:21,410
cause the chickies cheating with, is
that the ice rink? She says, yeah,

1731
01:44:21,411 --> 01:44:24,830
who the fuck is that? You know,
what the fuck are you doing here?

1732
01:44:25,400 --> 01:44:28,190
And he just goes, he just breaks
up with her right on the spot.

1733
01:44:28,191 --> 01:44:31,650
He's leaning on his stick, white
wipe, wiping the snow. I mean the,

1734
01:44:31,651 --> 01:44:33,740
the sweat off of his fucking nose.

1735
01:44:34,370 --> 01:44:37,700
He looks like a hockey player in
between periods going like, yeah,

1736
01:44:38,240 --> 01:44:41,060
we got to work on our for checking and
I hope we can get that goal back in the

1737
01:44:41,061 --> 01:44:44,450
second period he wasn't even sweating and
he just breaks up with her. She's like,

1738
01:44:44,451 --> 01:44:48,200
yeah, who the fuck is that?
What the fuck are you doing?
He just goes, he goes, yeah,

1739
01:44:48,201 --> 01:44:53,090
we're done.
What do you mean with done?

1740
01:44:53,091 --> 01:44:56,390
Just like dad. He goes, yeah,
it's over. She goes, that girl,

1741
01:44:56,540 --> 01:44:58,430
because the other girl was uglier.
She goes,

1742
01:44:58,460 --> 01:45:01,880
you're going to dump me for that girl.
And he goes, what can I say? She,

1743
01:45:02,120 --> 01:45:05,750
she does it right. I mean, he
didn't, he didn't give a fuck.

1744
01:45:05,990 --> 01:45:09,650
He was barely looking at her. He was
just sitting there leaning on his stick.

1745
01:45:10,070 --> 01:45:14,090
He wasn't nervous that there was cameras
there and he just fucking breaks up

1746
01:45:14,091 --> 01:45:16,820
with her and then his girlfriend
doesn't know what to do. She's so,

1747
01:45:16,821 --> 01:45:20,720
she ends up getting into a fistfight
with the chickies cheating on and he just

1748
01:45:20,721 --> 01:45:22,490
sort of walks away into the locker room.

1749
01:45:24,730 --> 01:45:28,160
It's fucking phenomenal.
Um, what else do we got?

1750
01:45:28,161 --> 01:45:32,780
We have some hippie chick trying to give
a presentation to a bunch of corporate

1751
01:45:32,781 --> 01:45:35,840
people. Uh, what the hell
are these youtube videos?

1752
01:45:36,620 --> 01:45:40,250
We got Paul Orndorff hyping the
Hulk Hulkamania workout thing.

1753
01:45:40,251 --> 01:45:43,640
That's one of my favorites.
