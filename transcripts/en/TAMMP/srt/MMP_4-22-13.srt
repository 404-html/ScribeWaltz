27
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:40,240

the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

28
00:01:40,241 --> 00:01:44,840
April 22nd, 2013 how? Why?

29
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:46,840
Okay,

30
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:51,640
I know. Well that's good. Um,

31
00:01:51,641 --> 00:01:55,930
what a week. It's amazing how much
the world can change in a week.

32
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:01,600
This weekend. Everything. Sadness, fear,

33
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:06,970
triumph and conspiracy theory.
When else do you need?

34
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,400
And by conspiracy theory,

35
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:14,440
I'm of course talking about
how the fucking Los Angeles
Lakers made it into the

36
00:02:14,441 --> 00:02:18,490
NBA playoffs.
Dude,

37
00:02:18,491 --> 00:02:23,460
the NBA is the most manipulated. I, I,

38
00:02:23,461 --> 00:02:28,260
it's just, it's almost like they're trying
to get caught. You know what I mean?

39
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:33,660
I'm going to sound like this fucking guy
who made this conspiracy theory about

40
00:02:33,661 --> 00:02:38,010
the bombings in Boston, but you
know, to steal his fucking line,

41
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,090
how much more proof do you need?
Oh,

42
00:02:42,091 --> 00:02:45,720
you got to look at is fucking,
who would you rather see in the playoffs?

43
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,030
Who's going to make it more fucking money?
Huh?

44
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:52,500
The fucking Utah Jazz or
the Los Angeles Lakers.

45
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:53,990
Okay.

46
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:57,140
Jesus Christ. I mean it was,
it was fucking ridiculous.

47
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,000
And now they're in the playoffs and they,

48
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,930
but people are gonna Watch
cause they hate them.

49
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:06,430
Just to watch them suck and watch them
get pounded it jazz. Just fucking,

50
00:03:06,431 --> 00:03:11,410
I don't know. I, it's, it's the worst.
It's the easiest fucking league to fix.

51
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,120
All right? Nobody has more power
than a fucking NBA official.

52
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:19,270
I could fix a game.
I don't even understand the game.

53
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,283
No.

54
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:26,880
All I gotta do is just fucking,
I've said this before,

55
00:03:26,881 --> 00:03:29,970
all you have to do as a fucking NBA Ref,
who's the best player?

56
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:31,830
Give them two quick ones

57
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,030
and then another, right? That
is, he's sitting at turnaround,

58
00:03:40,031 --> 00:03:43,480
looking over his shoulder with his
fucking eyebrows down. You know,

59
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:48,280
some guys worth 300 million fucking more
than I am and my stupid athlete's foot

60
00:03:48,281 --> 00:03:53,040
shirt. I just look at him like, yeah, keep
looking. I'll give you a tee the tee up.

61
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:57,490
All right, so now he's out of the fucking
game. He comes back into the game.

62
00:03:57,491 --> 00:03:58,271
The second quarter.

63
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:01,480
I give him another one that's straight
saying the third quarter buddy.

64
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:06,690
There's no other fucking sport.
You can't do that. An NFL football,

65
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:09,223
you know,

66
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:15,110
I can't call intentional grounding fucking
two times on Tom Brady and get them

67
00:04:15,111 --> 00:04:19,970
out of the game until the second quarter.
I can't call three strikes on it. Fuck.

68
00:04:19,971 --> 00:04:20,810
You know what I'm saying?

69
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:26,930
It is the most manipulate
Avi and obviously brutally,

70
00:04:26,931 --> 00:04:29,900
obviously manipulated game.
This is what kills me.

71
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:34,990
What fucking kills me about the mouth
breathing fucking morons that you walk

72
00:04:36,141 --> 00:04:40,910
into that you bump it to. She walked
into, I'm a fucking mouth. Three more on.

73
00:04:40,911 --> 00:04:45,770
I can't even express my views. Um,
I'm actually taking a class on that.

74
00:04:45,771 --> 00:04:49,940
How do you express your views or to call
other people done without sounding dumb

75
00:04:49,941 --> 00:04:54,170
yourself. Have you found yourself
on your podcast with no guests?

76
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,950
No.
Um,

77
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:57,790
yeah.

78
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,850
This is what kills me about these
fucking mouth breathing morons.

79
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:03,160
If you to start telling that the NBA
is fixed or it's fucking manipulated,

80
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:06,550
they roll their eyes at
you like you're a moron.

81
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,700
And what fucking kills me
is they had a mocked up ref.

82
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,270
They had a fucking mopped up ref.

83
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,140
Then they do that shit.
I was just what

84
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:23,850
was just one? Yeah, just
one bad seat in the NBA.

85
00:05:23,851 --> 00:05:27,930
It's boxing. It's basically boxing.
What? It's, it's just as fucking corrupt.

86
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:33,240
I loved that Shit. How it was just one
how there was a mobbed up ref and no,

87
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:37,590
none of the other referees
on the officiating crew
could figure it out that this

88
00:05:37,591 --> 00:05:41,850
guy was throwing games, a shaving
points to me. What are they doing?

89
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,590
They don't notice.

90
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,210
Give me a fucking break cause
all I'm saying. All right.

91
00:05:48,211 --> 00:05:51,270
And then another thing is I,
I,

92
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,500
there's no other fucking
sport with the star players.

93
00:05:55,501 --> 00:05:56,940
Get the level of preferential,

94
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:01,310
I didn't want to hear it from you
fucking NFL fence with how they protect

95
00:06:01,311 --> 00:06:04,040
quarterbacks. Okay. They do that
straight across the fucking,

96
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,500
they do that straight across the fucking
league because those guys are the

97
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:11,960
breadwinners and obviously a Peyton
manning a Brady is going to get one of the

98
00:06:11,961 --> 00:06:15,770
star plays. Always get more preferential
treatment. Okay. In all sports.

99
00:06:15,771 --> 00:06:17,780
I'll throw that out there,
but none,

100
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,790
none like the fucking NBA.
All right.

101
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:26,780
If you go near Coby Brian, you're getting
a fucking file. If it doesn't go in,

102
00:06:26,781 --> 00:06:28,460
he looks at the ref like it didn't go in.

103
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:34,130
Obviously I was filed and he gets
to fucking call. It's annoying.

104
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,060
Having said all that,
as much as I hate the Lakers,

105
00:06:38,061 --> 00:06:41,150
that was the fucking worst thing I've
seen is sports and a long time other than

106
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:45,320
that kid's leg fallen off for
Louisville was uh, uh, uh,

107
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:50,220
Colby, uh, snap, snap,
snapping his fucking Achilles.
But luckily they were in a,

108
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,800
in an age now where they,
the,

109
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:57,200
he's going to be back there the way
that they can operate on that. Like,

110
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,570
what am I trying to say?
The level of technology that they had,

111
00:06:59,571 --> 00:07:01,010
like back in the day,
you were fucked.

112
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:04,340
It was over by my buddy
Jason [inaudible] had,

113
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:08,000
who's got a great podcast himself,
um,

114
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,280
was saying Dominique Wilkins came,

115
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:14,210
took a year off after an
injury and actually came
back and became NBA player of

116
00:07:14,211 --> 00:07:18,470
the year. But he was never the same guy.
But, but it's different now. You know,

117
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:22,370
what's your course? They won't take into
consideration. So when he does come back,

118
00:07:22,371 --> 00:07:26,060
they going to be the most I
believable and probable, you know,

119
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:32,810
isn't it ridiculous? My, my level
of fucking, it's not even a Lakers,

120
00:07:32,811 --> 00:07:37,220
it's their fucking fence.
Their lack of knowledge on the game.

121
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:38,331
Well,

122
00:07:38,331 --> 00:07:42,750
they have one of the most selfish self
centered fucking players of all time and

123
00:07:42,751 --> 00:07:46,500
how the team actually plays as a tape
when he's not on the fucking court and

124
00:07:46,501 --> 00:07:50,430
they still chant MVP. When that fucking
cancer comes back out on the court,

125
00:07:50,431 --> 00:07:52,170
it just blows my fucking mind.
You know why?

126
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,540
Because everybody's in a fantasy
league and it's all about, well,

127
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:59,340
he had fucking 38 and Scholia
2,240 16 points better. All right,

128
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,990
let me take my tampon out here in la.
Let's get on with the podcast.

129
00:08:03,991 --> 00:08:06,600
You're listening to the Monday morning
podcast and it's not brought to you by

130
00:08:06,601 --> 00:08:09,290
anybody this week.
It's brought to you by me and my fuck.

131
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,430
Um, all right, so I started off with
something silly and over the top. Uh,

132
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:20,150
I don't, I don't like talking about
heaviest shit on this podcast,

133
00:08:20,151 --> 00:08:24,740
but obviously I've got to acknowledge
what happened at the Boston Marathon. Um,

134
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:29,290
you know, I'm not gonna say anything
that everybody else hasn't already said.

135
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,570
I just don't know how somebody can,
hi, how do you fucking do that?

136
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:37,310
Just walk up and you setting it down
and you're looking at people's legs and

137
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:42,020
kids and Shit and you just walking away
knowing that in whatever, seven minutes,

138
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,310
eight minutes, whatever
the fuck it is. I mean,

139
00:08:43,311 --> 00:08:45,680
just how do you do something like that?
You know,

140
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:51,560
fucking unbelievable.
It's got damn nerds, man.

141
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,640
I gotta tell you something.

142
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,450
Nerds are some of the most fucking
people on the planet. Okay?

143
00:08:57,451 --> 00:09:00,510
Those two were a couple of nerds,
nerds,

144
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,640
fucking MIT fucking nerds.

145
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:07,020
You send me in a Goddamn hobby store
to cannibalize some fucking toys.

146
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:09,240
You think I'm coming out with a bomb?
I'm not,

147
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:12,690
I'm coming up with the fucking ugliest
toy you've ever seen in your life.

148
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:18,000
I'll fucking tape together with duct tape.
I didn't know what,

149
00:09:18,001 --> 00:09:22,050
what is in a fucking hobby store?
What is in there?

150
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:26,850
What did they, what did they, some
glue. I don't know what they took. Um,

151
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,410
and is another thing that's
fucking annoys me. You know,

152
00:09:31,411 --> 00:09:32,550
and then everything's nerds.
They,

153
00:09:32,551 --> 00:09:35,220
they make all these fucking movies like
they're these great God damn people.

154
00:09:35,221 --> 00:09:36,054
They aren't,

155
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:42,020
they aren't all the weaponry that you
see across the fucking globe for as much

156
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:44,340
as some sociopath thinks of this shit.

157
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:48,690
It takes a nerd to make that
psycho thought of fucking reality.

158
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:52,970
Fucking God damn nerds.
You teach them,

159
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:57,890
you know the secrets of the world and
this is what they do with it. You know?

160
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,930
Or they come up with something and then
somebody else uses it for fucking evil.

161
00:10:02,931 --> 00:10:05,480
I don't know what the fucking thing is,
but here's my thing. Fucking cutting.

162
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:09,840
Get any terrorists listening
to this podcast. Are you,

163
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:12,560
I in a fucking cave right now.
You know,

164
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:16,920
jerking off to your fucking 72 virgins
or whatever the hell they're promising

165
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:21,800
you. All right? First of all,
they're not there. When you die,

166
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:25,970
you're going the ground.
Okay? That's where you go.

167
00:10:25,971 --> 00:10:30,890
And so what you want to do is you
want to try and stay alive. You know,

168
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:35,510
meet yourself. Acute
fucking lady, you know,

169
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,640
have a cookout,

170
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,190
okay?

171
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:43,630
Ride a bicycle. Fill the wind in
your fucking hair or in your beard.

172
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:47,500
You know,
what are you doing?

173
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:52,960
When is your district manager going
to go fucking do something instead of

174
00:10:52,961 --> 00:10:55,360
sending all you can sit over
here is another thing too.

175
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:59,680
How about you switch it up every once in
a while and you go to a gated community?

176
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:03,190
You know,
does it always have to be regular people?

177
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:08,940
Why don't you actually fucking go after
the country that are making your life

178
00:11:08,941 --> 00:11:12,090
miserable and you know
who I'm talking about.

179
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,690
I'm talking about the fucking bank,

180
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,850
you know, let me tell you
something about these banker cons.

181
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,760
They fucking own everything.

182
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,260
You understand me? They own
everything. And if they don't own it,

183
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:34,630
it's just temporary because somebody's
going to fucking die or need a kidney and

184
00:11:34,631 --> 00:11:37,390
then they're going to lose
whatever the fuck that they own.

185
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:38,840
Yeah.

186
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,290
You know,
every fucking house,

187
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,650
every fucking building,
every fucking piece of property,

188
00:11:45,651 --> 00:11:50,630
every fucking blade of grass,
these fucking banker conch own.

189
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:55,300
And they look at it that
way. That's our stuff. Okay.

190
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,300
And then you go on it, you, you air quote,

191
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:03,301
buy it from us and then we bend you over
that fence and fuck you in the ass for

192
00:12:03,371 --> 00:12:06,100
30 years.
By the time you come out the other side,

193
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:10,220
you're too fucking old to take care
of whatever you bought. All right.

194
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:14,920
Can I go up the stairs or
the wrong through walls and
then you sell it and then

195
00:12:14,921 --> 00:12:18,970
they get another 30 35 year old cut in
there and they fucking bend them over.

196
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,200
Fucking have add if the 30 goddamn years,
that's what they do.

197
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:25,740
Okay.

198
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,573
Yeah.

199
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:31,820
So I dunno what those people
were trying to fucking achieve.

200
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:36,800
All they did was just, you know,
make a bunch of regular people.

201
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:43,190
There's no way to hear whatever you have,
whatever your fucking causes.

202
00:12:43,191 --> 00:12:44,050
I don't give a fuck.

203
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,530
You could actually have agree with me
on everything that I think about the

204
00:12:48,531 --> 00:12:49,850
fucking world this second.

205
00:12:49,851 --> 00:12:53,270
You walk into a crowd and just
fucking do something like that. It's,

206
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,890
I don't know anyone we want to hear it.

207
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:57,823
MMM.

208
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:00,000
But you know, it was, it was, well,

209
00:13:00,001 --> 00:13:05,001
it was fucking amazing was how they
just shut the whole fucking city down.

210
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,420
I mean,
that's just unbelievable.

211
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:13,020
Nobody just stay inside and then you
just got the only person running up the

212
00:13:13,021 --> 00:13:15,720
street is the guy you're looking for
a couple of crackheads, you know,

213
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,410
crickets don't have radios
and plus they live outside it.

214
00:13:20,411 --> 00:13:23,970
What the fuck am I supposed
to go in my box? You know,

215
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,180
get your feet up on that park bench.
Your fucking feet come off the park bench.

216
00:13:30,181 --> 00:13:33,060
You were officially considered outside.
It gets to the shoot too.

217
00:13:33,061 --> 00:13:37,860
And your fucking neck deck kid.
How funny was the news coverage?

218
00:13:37,861 --> 00:13:39,810
Listened to all those
fucking Boston accents?

219
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,360
Yeah.

220
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,440
Yeah, we actually obtained yet there's
no suspects of Marcy Boulevard.

221
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:47,403
Um,

222
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:51,820
yeah,

223
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:56,200
I actually didn't watch most of it
once the bullshit was going. It's like,

224
00:13:56,201 --> 00:14:00,820
I'm not going to sit here for eight hours
in watch a goddamn standoff watching

225
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:05,850
these fucking news reporters grabbing
anything with a mouth to start talking to

226
00:14:05,981 --> 00:14:09,230
them, you know? Well, we got a, Ah,

227
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:12,500
we got a gentlemen hair or works,
uh,

228
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:17,580
he works at adamants bakery.
Uh, you, you said that, uh, you,

229
00:14:17,581 --> 00:14:19,750
you, you actually knew one of the, uh,

230
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:24,810
suspects or should we know about
both of them had brown hair and,

231
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:30,220
uh, my mother's got brown hair,
so there's like, you know,

232
00:14:30,221 --> 00:14:32,620
it's like eerie,
you know.

233
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:39,130
Then one time they actually got a guy
who were,

234
00:14:39,131 --> 00:14:43,640
were one of the suspects,
dropped off the car, you know,

235
00:14:43,641 --> 00:14:48,410
and he had all this fucking unbelievable
information and he's just spewing it

236
00:14:48,411 --> 00:14:50,190
out on television and I,

237
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,230
and they're also filming the cops
where they're at and their location.

238
00:14:54,231 --> 00:14:57,950
I just wanted something like
fucking 20 year vet to come up to,

239
00:14:57,951 --> 00:14:58,784
what are these reporters?

240
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:02,150
Stick a pistol right underneath
his fucking Chin and just be like,

241
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,890
who's fucking side of you are

242
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:11,750
this, shouldn't this show? And
what they're doing. I Dunno.

243
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:17,510
But anyways,
I was really amazed at how quickly

244
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,940
and efficiently that whole thing went
down and how quickly they got those guys.

245
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:24,863
Uh,

246
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,493
okay.

247
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,160
It W it was unreal.
Um,

248
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,880
and then I was happy that when I found
out I'm sitting there going, please,

249
00:15:32,881 --> 00:15:34,260
please don't be from North Korea.

250
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,570
Please don't be from the
middle of fucking east.

251
00:15:36,571 --> 00:15:41,571
Please don't be from one of those fucking
places because these fucking assholes

252
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:47,760
are gonna beat us because
if we keep bombing every
fucking and going to war with

253
00:15:47,761 --> 00:15:52,320
every country that they're from, I mean
we're going to go bankrupt. I mean,

254
00:15:52,321 --> 00:15:56,070
we just spent like fucking out of how
many billions of dollars did we just spend

255
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,230
to catch like 35 people?

256
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:01,320
I don't know why we just don't
send the drones over there.

257
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:04,710
What are they going to do?
Worst thing to do is they shoot,

258
00:16:04,711 --> 00:16:07,890
went down and gives a fuck. He just
make another one. Have a fucking nerd.

259
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,030
Make another one.

260
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:11,310
Okay.

261
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:15,770
You just fly around over
there, right? Damn. I know.
I'm over overly simplifying it,

262
00:16:15,771 --> 00:16:19,610
but, um, then I found out they were
from Chechnya and I Chet. Yeah.

263
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:22,210
How the fuck you say it and
how many people will like,

264
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:25,650
like me who said that if from
Chet, yes. You can't even say it,

265
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,200
let alone even know where it is.

266
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:30,880
I thought that was near like
Yugoslavia or like a, uh,

267
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:32,960
checklist Slovakia.

268
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,240
And today when I went to look
it up before the podcast,

269
00:16:38,241 --> 00:16:41,090
so I wouldn't even sound dumb or,
um,

270
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:46,610
I just wrote in Chetan yet, and
I spelled it so bad. Oh my God,

271
00:16:46,611 --> 00:16:51,040
I spelled it so bad that,
um, I don't, I have you say,

272
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,550
I still can't fucking say it right.

273
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,780
And I've heard them say it like
9 million times in the news.

274
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:01,250
Like that computer didn't even
know what I was, was typing in.

275
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,180
So I had to take my shot at spelling
[inaudible] and then I've wouldn't Russia

276
00:17:05,181 --> 00:17:09,110
after it. And then I was
like, oh, you made this. Um,

277
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:15,610
evidently it's just north of Georgia
and Armenia and as [inaudible],

278
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:22,760
um, it's basically to the right and
to the north of Turkey. You know,

279
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,073
I don't fucking know.

280
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:33,040
And you know what the worst thing about
the bombing other than the tragic loss

281
00:17:33,081 --> 00:17:36,200
of life, you know, and there's so many,

282
00:17:36,201 --> 00:17:41,201
so much other stuff like just I would
imagine people with hearing loss lost,

283
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:46,870
you know, vision or partial loss
of vision and just, I don't,

284
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,050
just a psychological, all of
that damage that was done, um,

285
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,680
right up there.
Not right up there,

286
00:17:52,681 --> 00:17:57,681
but a distant third to death and injury
in psychological put it forth is the

287
00:18:01,441 --> 00:18:05,760
fact that I really felt that I
was then in my own little way,

288
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:10,790
I was starting to turn the tide and I
was starting to turn red sox fans against

289
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:17,130
that fucking Neil diamond song.
But now,

290
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,700
now it's over because now
everybody's all patriotic.

291
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:25,440
You know about Boston,
they played the fucking song,

292
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,140
they played it at Yankee stadium.

293
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:32,760
I'm getting Deuce chills just talking
about it. And then Neil diamond himself,

294
00:18:32,761 --> 00:18:37,761
the devil himself comes to fucking Fenway
and everybody region out touching me,

295
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:46,750
touching the fucking joy in these people's
faces as they sing along with this

296
00:18:48,421 --> 00:18:50,790
man who wrote a song about
an eight year old girl.

297
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,520
I don't understand it, but
it's over now. I give up,

298
00:18:56,550 --> 00:19:01,410
I'm thrown in the fucking towel. It's,
it's over. Cause now it now it is.

299
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,273
It's,

300
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:08,210
it's now associated with the triumphant
feeling of getting the two counts that

301
00:19:09,751 --> 00:19:13,890
uh, you know, it started the whole fucking
art, whatever. Anyway, I'm fucking,

302
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,870
this is why I'm not a news correspondent.

303
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:21,600
I can't even explain it without saying
Kuntz who will responsible for the

304
00:19:21,601 --> 00:19:23,670
bombings of Boston. There we go.
That's what I'm trying to say.

305
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,990
And now it's associated
with that. So it, it's,

306
00:19:25,991 --> 00:19:30,560
it's fucking over fucking over. And, um,

307
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:32,903
anyways,

308
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:39,510
bright side of all of this is
that they got the two guys, um,

309
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,690
and the two guys who are trained in,

310
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,630
in a fucking country that's too fucking
big for us to attack at this point.

311
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:48,900
They've got too many, too much shit
themselves. So maybe we won't go.

312
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,920
We won't have to spend $1 billion,
you know,

313
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:58,890
have more loss of life on our side and
have like kill a million civilians over

314
00:19:58,891 --> 00:20:03,360
there trying to find
fucking 35 assholes. So, um,

315
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,110
so I guess that part of it is good then.

316
00:20:07,111 --> 00:20:11,430
I love that we got them and I think
it's fucking hilarious that people,

317
00:20:11,431 --> 00:20:15,060
if there's already conspiracy
theories that, that,

318
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:21,540
that these aren't the two guys and
it's the youtube video of the week.

319
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:25,590
You got to hear this fucking guy.
He basically,

320
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:30,591
he pieces to gather a bunch of video
and cell phone pictures and he finds

321
00:20:30,871 --> 00:20:34,950
another guy with a backpack and,
and then that's,

322
00:20:34,951 --> 00:20:38,570
it completely ignores,
you know,

323
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,110
they say innocent men don't run yet.

324
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:44,010
They also don't kidnap people and throw
grenades and shoot guns at fucking

325
00:20:44,011 --> 00:20:46,770
police. You know, that's not what you do.

326
00:20:46,771 --> 00:20:51,610
Like I being accused of something I
didn't do and then he just grab a grenade

327
00:20:51,611 --> 00:20:53,830
Outta your fucking back pocket,
you know?

328
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:58,480
But this guy is absolutely
convinced that from his computer,

329
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:04,390
he doesn't need to go down to the sea.
He doesn't need to interview anybody.

330
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:08,740
He doesn't need to be
anywhere near the evidence.

331
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:14,070
He just needs to be on his
computer looking at cell
phone pictures and video and

332
00:21:15,131 --> 00:21:18,880
so he finds another guy with a backpack
that he says matches the one that was

333
00:21:18,881 --> 00:21:23,530
exploded afterwards and then he goes,
there it is folks.

334
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:28,660
He goes, how much more proof do you
need? Then when he goes, he goes,

335
00:21:28,661 --> 00:21:32,650
smoked it folks. Game over.
Just talking shit like version.

336
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:36,160
I love the guy. When I have time
I'm going to go back to his channel.

337
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:39,700
I'm going to watch all of his fucking
videos because if he's going to end every

338
00:21:39,701 --> 00:21:44,500
half as half-baked fucking idea was
smoked it folks game over. I mean,

339
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,430
I don't know about you guys,

340
00:21:45,431 --> 00:21:49,480
but that's easily four hours of
entertainment in my world, you know?

341
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,840
Anyways, so here we go. Let's get,

minutes about your level of intellect

344
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,020
because no matter how
dumb you think you are,

345
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:07,870
there's no way you're going to
come off as it stupider than I am.

346
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,090
What are we up to?
Huh?

347
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,570
How many fucking minutes is it time to
do the one and only read this week? What?

348
00:22:13,571 --> 00:22:17,050
20 minutes in reaching out,

goes. Bump, bump, bump. You know.

353
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,490
Oh,
do the world a favor and kill yourself.

354
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:44,590
Kill that song. Um, wait a minute.

355
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:45,930
Okay.

384
00:24:31,911 --> 00:24:32,320

want free shit and they want no
advertising worked for me for nothing.

386
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,370
I'm all right.

387
00:24:40,371 --> 00:24:42,800
Before I get onto some of the other
shift that I want to talk about,

388
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:47,300
I'm going to read this first email that
I got from somebody and it's titled

389
00:24:47,301 --> 00:24:49,790
Anger, not hitting. It said, dear bill,

390
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:54,410
I watched two of your specials
recently on Netflix while you,

391
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:55,970
you are a very funny guy.

392
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:59,810
Now this is when you know some
criticism is coming your way.

393
00:24:59,811 --> 00:25:02,810
Anytime something now, you know? Yeah.
I'm not saying you're not a good guy.

394
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:07,580
While you are a very funny guy and
most of most of the stuff is great,

395
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,860
I really need to point out your bit
about violence against women has a major

396
00:25:12,861 --> 00:25:16,100
flaw though.
Thank you person who never did stand up.

397
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:20,000
Please by all means help me fix my jokes.
Uh,

398
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:21,350
there's no doubt.

399
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:26,300
There are plenty of reasons a man
could be angry with the woman,

400
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:28,310
so there is a reason for that,

401
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,390
but there really is no reason
and no excuse for hitting.

402
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:37,930
My ex nearly murdered me because I didn't
want him to be with him anymore and

403
00:25:38,061 --> 00:25:40,430
told him he needed to
move out of my house.

404
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:45,170
I paid for entirely mine alone.
I never laid a hand on him,

405
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:46,340
never even thought of it.

406
00:25:46,341 --> 00:25:50,540
I spent a week in intensive care so you
can see how I might think that you could

407
00:25:50,541 --> 00:25:54,830
amend that bit to say there are
reasons for anger not hitting.

408
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:59,900
All right. Now for those of you
who aren't standup Comedians,

409
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:05,050
this right here is a reoccurring email
that will go on throughout your entire

410
00:26:06,411 --> 00:26:09,890
fucking career and this is what I find.

411
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:14,540
First of all, at no point did I
say anybody should hit a woman.

412
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:21,480
I never said that. I said, when they
say there's no reasons to hit a woman,

413
00:26:21,481 --> 00:26:25,590
I presented the scenario. I just said,
look, there's plenty of reasons to do it.

414
00:26:25,591 --> 00:26:28,290
You just don't do it.
That was the joke.

415
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,050
Repeat the joke.

416
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:35,490
Capital j Dash O k joke.

417
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:39,750
And this is what I find about people
who get offended and she was cool or

418
00:26:39,751 --> 00:26:42,930
whatever. Obviously, you know, um,

419
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:44,790
this is what I find

420
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:50,800
about people who send me emails like this.
All right?

421
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,910
Obese people get offended
by jokes about obesity.

422
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:59,740
You know, women who've been fucking
beaten by some piece of shit.

423
00:26:59,741 --> 00:27:03,880
Guy Get offended about the
hidden women joke. All right,

424
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:06,120
fuck it.
I Dunno.

425
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:10,420
People flight pilots get offended by my
shit about talking shit about pilots.

426
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:14,890
But this is what I find. Pilots never
get offended by the obese material.

427
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,220
Obese people never get offended
by the hitting women thing.

428
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:21,730
The dog lovers who get
offended by the dog,

429
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,860
they got adopted dog rescue dog bit.

430
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:28,840
Never get offended by the starving
child jokes. See what I'm saying?

431
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,670
Well, I understand. If you don't, I'll
let me try to explain it a little bit.

432
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:38,150
I'm just saying this
fucking lay sat through

433
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:42,610
two of my specials. So the first
special, okay. She watches,

434
00:27:42,611 --> 00:27:45,370
I don't fucking talk about hitting women.
So that's an hour right there.

435
00:27:45,371 --> 00:27:48,370
She sat through laughter,
fucking tits off at a great time.

436
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:49,900
And then she sits through about 40,

437
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:52,930
45 minutes to the next one
and everything's fucking fine.

438
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,710
And everything's funny and everything's
just a joke is I'm just going through

439
00:27:56,711 --> 00:28:01,120
one topic after another that's offending
the fuck out of everybody who's in that

440
00:28:01,121 --> 00:28:01,954
group.

441
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:05,980
And then it comes around to some shit
that's in her neighborhood and then all of

442
00:28:05,981 --> 00:28:08,530
a sudden I have to start
making like a men's

443
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,330
okay

444
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:10,990
to bits.

445
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:14,260
I need to tweak it a little bit because
of her fucking personal experience.

446
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:17,530
I have to tweak it because
of her personal experience.

447
00:28:17,531 --> 00:28:20,440
And then all of a sudden what
I'm saying is not a joke anymore.

448
00:28:20,441 --> 00:28:24,310
It's more of a statement. And
I'm more, more like, you know,

449
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:25,601
I mean,

450
00:28:25,601 --> 00:28:29,350
earlier in this podcast I advocated
these terrorists go into a fucking gated

451
00:28:29,351 --> 00:28:33,970
community. Do you think I really want him
to do that? Yeah. No I don't. I don't.

452
00:28:33,971 --> 00:28:38,230
But uh, just maybe light some
firecrackers off underneath that limo.

453
00:28:38,231 --> 00:28:41,350
Just something,
some sort of small payback.

454
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:43,063
Okay.

455
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:49,410
How easy would it be for them to get
the fucking, those gated communities,

456
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,540
they're already driving town cars.

457
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:53,340
Yeah.

458
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:57,540
Dude, if I was a banker and
I was a piece of Shit Bagger,

459
00:28:57,541 --> 00:29:01,680
I would be so fucking paranoid that
someone was going to whack me for all the

460
00:29:01,681 --> 00:29:03,330
misery and suffering.

461
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:04,470
Okay.

462
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:08,160
That I fucking, you know,
that I've been caused.

463
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:09,480
Yeah.

464
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:13,710
The fact that I turned a fucking
pond into my own Jacuzzi, right.

465
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:18,740
I can park my yacht and my fucking
Jacuzzi and I just sit there,

466
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:22,720
you know, eating fucking crab
legs and caviar every fucking day,

467
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:25,660
standing on fucking dead babies heads.

468
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:31,070
There's no fucking way I would ever get
nick fucking town car. There's no way.

469
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,713
There's no way

470
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:42,460
I would have whoever my
Fredo of my litter of kids,

471
00:29:42,461 --> 00:29:45,880
whoever the Frito was. That was the
be the guy that I had driven the car.

472
00:29:45,881 --> 00:29:49,550
Although in the godfather he was looking
out for Marlin Brando and then I,

473
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,360
he got shot. Right. So, I
don't know. Fucking dumb.

474
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,740
Anyways. Oh, you know, I read some,

475
00:29:56,741 --> 00:30:01,741
actually some really interesting shit
about how Iceland beat the bankers when

476
00:30:02,591 --> 00:30:07,030
Iceland went bankrupt and in the, banker's
tried to pull this shit where, yeah,

477
00:30:07,031 --> 00:30:10,630
we were greedy cuts and now we're putting
the dead on you when your taxpayers,

478
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:15,760
they said, you know what? Fuck you.
This is an our debt. This is our mess.

479
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:16,623
It's yours.

480
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:21,250
And then all these fucking sellout costs
like fucking Amsterdam and Britain put

481
00:30:21,251 --> 00:30:26,251
all this pressure on fucking Iceland
because they pussied out with the bankers.

482
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:31,300
They've been on their knees sucking
that banker cock for fucking ever.

483
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:33,520
They tried to fucking
get them to come along.

484
00:30:33,521 --> 00:30:35,230
They've tried to pressure them and I,
you know,

485
00:30:35,231 --> 00:30:39,700
or else we'll turn you into the Cuba
of the north. And they said, fuck you,

486
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:43,600
we're not doing it. And you know what,
that's what this country should have done.

487
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:47,320
This country should have told
us bank or fucking cunts.

488
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:52,330
I just emphasized myself that
it isn't brought up more.

489
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:57,120
You know, it's the whole thing.
Like I had water damage to my house,

490
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:01,900
my insurance company sends a check
that's made out to me. Uh, Nia and,

491
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:05,010
and then my mortgage company
and I have to sweep up the sign,

492
00:31:05,011 --> 00:31:09,660
the check over to them. So they keep
the money. And you know why that is?

493
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:13,980
Because they fucked so many
people so fucking hard in the ass.

494
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:17,910
So many people are upside down in
houses because of the bullshit that they

495
00:31:17,911 --> 00:31:22,380
created by making people who aren't
qualified for loans qualified.

496
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,060
So instead of having five
people bid on a house,

497
00:31:25,061 --> 00:31:29,010
she got 10 people bidding on it and it
goes up like super bowl tickets, right?

498
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:32,760
And all of a sudden a house that's
really worth a buck 80 sells for two 70.

499
00:31:32,761 --> 00:31:35,550
So he got these concerts. Everybody's
fucking upside down on the house.

500
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:37,200
They're like, well fuck
it, I'm keeping this money.

501
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:40,950
And then when they foreclosed on it, they
fucking come in and they're like, fuck,

502
00:31:40,951 --> 00:31:45,480
they never fixed the roof. So now I
have to sign over. My God, their money.

503
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:49,290
It's my money. It's my insurance.
That's my insurance money.

504
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:53,760
I have to send it into them. You know
why? Because people, it's not my house.

505
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:57,930
It's their fucking house.
It's theirs. All right.

506
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:01,950
And if I ever paid this fucker off,
what, you know I'm Gunna, I drive off.

507
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:05,430
I dropped her six year old hybrid.
All right. I don't give a fuck.

508
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,170
I fucking,

509
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:10,740
I dress like Malcolm young cause I'm
getting these cuts on in my life and this

510
00:32:10,741 --> 00:32:11,341
is what's going to happen.

511
00:32:11,341 --> 00:32:14,670
I'm going to pay off this fucking
house and you think when I die I can,

512
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:19,050
I can just give it to somebody
else. It's my house. Right?

513
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:20,460
Okay.

514
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,800
If I can fucking give
away all my other shit,

515
00:32:22,801 --> 00:32:26,010
why can't I give the house the house is
going to have all taxes and all these

516
00:32:26,011 --> 00:32:27,620
penalties and all this bullshit,

517
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:29,400
whoever I fucking leave it to
is gonna make you know what?

518
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:32,820
It's just going to be easier to sell it
and then they sell it and whatever money

519
00:32:32,821 --> 00:32:34,680
they make,
they get the shit tax started them.

520
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:38,010
They get half a dick in their ass and
then somebody else buys this thing and

521
00:32:38,011 --> 00:32:41,240
then the, that the bank goes deep in
them for another fucking 30 years.

522
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:44,770
You don't want halfway
through that I realized,

523
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:48,580
am I sounding crazy or am I making sense?
I Dunno,

524
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,970
I talked to a banker and a titty bar.
He agreed with everything I said.

525
00:32:55,780 --> 00:33:00,070
All right, special thanks this week to
a everybody, I did a at the Tampa it,

526
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:01,730
who came out to the Tampa Improv,

527
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:06,500
who came out to Florida State University
in Tallahassee. I'd never been there.

528
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:11,690
And, uh, came out to Miami, the
Fillmore, Jackie Gleason theater, um,

529
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,840
had a great time in all cities.

530
00:33:14,841 --> 00:33:18,270
That was the end of the bus tour
when it was just me and Versie, uh,

531
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:20,900
Jason Law had,
and his dad had gone home at that point.

532
00:33:20,901 --> 00:33:25,160
So it was just us on the
bus. Um, I got gotta,

533
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:29,400
I have a fucking unbelievable
video of being on the bus and, uh,

534
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:35,030
this fucking RV is,
is just completely engulfed in flames.

535
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:38,510
So that'll be a video that I'll be sending
out to you guys this week if you want

536
00:33:38,511 --> 00:33:41,840
to check it out. Tallahassee,
Florida. He played Florida state.

537
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:46,610
We went over to their Ra, Bobby Bowden.
We went over to the, uh, the stadium.

538
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:50,560
Did I tell you that last week?
I can't remember.

539
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:51,820
Okay.

540
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:55,880
No, I wouldn't because that
would have been on a Tuesday.
Yeah. So we fucking, we,

541
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:59,690
it was one of these great stadiums where
it,

542
00:33:59,691 --> 00:34:03,860
they just leave it open and
then the students can go
in there and run the stairs

543
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:08,990
and just, you know, it's Kinda
how like it used to be stadiums,

544
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:13,490
even pro stadiums used to be like that. I
remember a long time ago, my family was,

545
00:34:13,491 --> 00:34:17,090
was a vacation down to
Florida and we, we, uh,

546
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:22,150
we're in Tampa and somehow we ended
up the original Tampa Bay Buccaneers

547
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:26,780
stadiums, like the John
McKay one. Right. And I just,

548
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,340
I wanted to see it,

549
00:34:28,341 --> 00:34:32,750
so I got out of the car with my mother
and we just walked right into the stadium

550
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:36,770
and I stood on the corner of one of the
end zones was just, it was wide open.

551
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:42,600
I mean, what do you, what are
you going to steal grass chairs?

552
00:34:42,601 --> 00:34:46,110
It's just a big fucking circle
with, with uh, with chairs.

553
00:34:46,111 --> 00:34:49,020
But now I guess because they got all
this other crap and there was the luxury

554
00:34:49,021 --> 00:34:53,010
box. People think you're gonna, I
dunno. Steel what a fucking recliner.

555
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:58,480
I Dunno, whatever. So Florida State
University, we went there. I mean for,

556
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:02,850
as he actually,
we ran up the stairs once one time and um,

557
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:06,930
it was one of the great workouts
I've ever had. Just doing it once.

558
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,200
And of course me I have fucking
OCD is like, oh, you know what,

559
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:12,950
I do one for three days in a row.
Then I do too when I,

560
00:35:12,951 --> 00:35:14,280
if I could work my way up like that,
but that,

561
00:35:14,281 --> 00:35:18,390
but that was just my brain just starts
fucking going. But, um, great crowds.

562
00:35:18,391 --> 00:35:23,391
They're great crowds and Tampa smoked
some amazing fucking cigars and Tampa.

563
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:27,830
And then we went down to
the Fillmore. Um, Miami,

564
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:31,830
south beach. It's south beach is
so fucking beautiful with the,

565
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:35,790
they have all these, like I'm a big fan
of art deco and they have all these, uh,

566
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:40,410
art deco style and the theater itself,
um,

567
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:44,970
was that art deco style crowd was amazing.
Um,

568
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:49,470
I'm not gonna lie to you dude. That tour
I just went through through the south.

569
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:54,310
I was on my fucking game. I had some
of the best shows I've ever had. And,

570
00:35:54,311 --> 00:35:59,100
um, I think it was because it took me so
long to sell tickets down in the south.

571
00:35:59,101 --> 00:35:59,934
Like,
um,

572
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:04,670
like the first place I sold
tickets obviously was east coast.

573
00:36:04,671 --> 00:36:05,504
It's where I'm from.

574
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,173
MMM.

575
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:08,630
You know,
I,

576
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:13,280
my HBO special came out and then I got
on the opiate Anthony show at the same

577
00:36:13,281 --> 00:36:15,860
time cause Norton was doing,
I'm lucky Louie.

578
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:20,270
So those two things kind of hit at
the same time. And once they hit,

579
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:25,220
I kind of was able to sell tickets
from Boston down to like DC,

580
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:28,970
which is a big O and a market.
And um,

581
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:34,560
then maybe to about Cleveland,
but I didn't have Pittsburgh though.

582
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,450
MMM.

583
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:39,650
And then I think I had like San Francisco,
that's what I had.

584
00:36:39,651 --> 00:36:44,570
And then gradually I got the middle of
the country and the last one to fall was

585
00:36:44,571 --> 00:36:45,111
the south.

586
00:36:45,111 --> 00:36:50,111
I just couldn't get in down there from
fucking Nashville all the way down.

587
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:56,450
Even a like Miami, Miami, and Miami's do
the Improv. It was like, yeah, you know,

588
00:36:56,451 --> 00:37:00,380
white comics don't sell well down here.
It's a really big Latino community. And,

589
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,560
and they weren't lying. And I
showed up, there was nobody there.

590
00:37:03,561 --> 00:37:08,561
So I think I was fucking excited and
felt like I had something to prove.

591
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:13,950
I don't know what, but it was kind of
like the first show went well and uh,

592
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:16,300
it was like you hit your first jump
shot, you know, and then it just,

593
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:19,490
it just was fucking
amazing, man. Just amazing.

594
00:37:19,491 --> 00:37:22,550
So I really want to thank everybody
who came out to all those shows. One,

595
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:26,360
one thing that did bump me out though was,
you know,

596
00:37:26,361 --> 00:37:29,840
I'm a huge Jackie Gleason
fan. I used to watch is, uh,

597
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,530
obviously watched all the
honeymoon winners episode
and then I used to watch is

598
00:37:33,531 --> 00:37:38,120
a, is a variety show, which I also loved.

599
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:42,110
You know, Joe the
bartender. Um, what was it?

600
00:37:42,111 --> 00:37:45,110
Crazy crazy. I can't
remember. It's been so long.

601
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:51,740
I forget it. This isn't, when I say
Lou Holtz sounds like, hey yo, hey,

602
00:37:51,741 --> 00:37:56,180
you meet the gunny. He that guy, he
sounds just like Lou Holtz. Shay,

603
00:37:56,181 --> 00:37:59,300
you praised freaking to you coach.
Um,

604
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:07,190
excuse me. Um, oh fuck me.

605
00:38:07,191 --> 00:38:11,330
God dammit.
I swear to fucking Christ.

606
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:14,270
Are you guys like me? Ah, fuck.

607
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:18,500
I spill a fucking glass of water.
Every god Damn Day

608
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,910
went right on my rolling stone,

609
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:27,370
which I have a subscription to fucking
Louis CK is on the cover. You know,

610
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:30,460
this is one I'm obviously going
to say knock it off fucking wet.

611
00:38:30,461 --> 00:38:33,790
Now you gotta go down to the new standard
by another one. But you know what,

612
00:38:33,791 --> 00:38:35,080
that'll be good for him
because they'll think,

613
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,090
well everybody's buying it
cause he's on the cover.

614
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:40,710
They won't realize it's a bunch of morons
spill of glasses of water on it. Uh,

615
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,100
by the way,
if you get a chance,

616
00:38:42,101 --> 00:38:47,101
fucking unreal article on Louie
Ck fucking killer article,

617
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:52,540
killer article. Um, so anyways,

618
00:38:52,541 --> 00:38:55,240
going back to, uh, the
Jackie Gleason theater.

619
00:38:55,241 --> 00:39:00,241
So I performed there and then
I leave and after I left,

620
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:05,140
somebody goes like, yeah, how amazing
is that theater? You know, I was insane.

621
00:39:05,141 --> 00:39:08,110
He's like, yeah, Jackie Gleason performed
there and blah blah. Like I know, I know.

622
00:39:08,111 --> 00:39:11,440
And they go, did you see his
dressing room? And I was like, what?

623
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:13,920
They go yap stairs.
They have his dressing room.

624
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:18,130
They'd kept it pretty much like the way
he had it after he was finally here.

625
00:39:18,131 --> 00:39:22,240
I mean, it's amazing. It's like walking
back in time. And I was like, it's like,

626
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:24,550
what the fuck?
Why didn't you tell me?

627
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:27,550
How do I know I'll ever
be back there again?

628
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,080
That was the only bad part.

629
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:37,170
But then it was quickly made up because
Versie at the end of the show is a,

630
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:42,970
he met this chef under New
Hampshire, uh, Tim, Andrew Yola,

631
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:48,190
and he had this, he was like, uh, I guess
he has three restaurants down there,

632
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:52,690
celebrity chef. Long story
short, he invites us out,

633
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:58,620
keeps the restaurant open, and we
basically, to use firsties expression,

634
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:03,070
we dined like gods. It was
insane. Now forgive me, Tim,

635
00:40:03,071 --> 00:40:06,750
because I don't fucking remember the
name of the restaurant. I and, and,

636
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:09,790
and so you don't think I'm being
disrespectful? I don't know.

637
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:14,440
Remember the names of any
restaurants. All right. Like I have,

638
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:18,190
I just have nicknames for all
the ones that we go to out here.

639
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:20,800
One of them's called pancake circus.

640
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,200
That's cause I walked into
the first time I saw it,

641
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:27,310
his giant like manholes size pancake with
a bunch of fucking whipped cream on it

642
00:40:27,311 --> 00:40:32,280
and all I could think of was like, that
looks like clown food. So I don't know.

643
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:35,620
I'm a moron, but I think it's
Timo. But this is the thing.

644
00:40:35,621 --> 00:40:39,070
The first thing we go there, the first
thing they bring out is crab legs.

645
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:43,150
I fucking hate crab legs. I've never
been into them. It's so much God.

646
00:40:43,151 --> 00:40:46,840
Their work to get a mouthful of fucking
meat and then it just tastes like the

647
00:40:46,841 --> 00:40:48,490
God damn ocean.
All right.

648
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:53,140
I have been converted
these fucking crab legs.

649
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:56,760
Not only with the best crab legs
I ever ate. They would some,

650
00:40:56,810 --> 00:40:59,800
it was some of the best
food I've ever had.

651
00:40:59,801 --> 00:41:03,400
Even the melted butter tasted better
than anybody else's melted butter.

652
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:06,220
I was sitting there,
I look like a fucking,

653
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:12,100
I look like a toddler eating birthday
cake, seven cake all over my face.

654
00:41:12,101 --> 00:41:14,860
It was just fucking crab legs and butter.

655
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:19,060
I musta ate like fucking
three or four of those legs.

656
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,010
Then he brought over pizzas.

657
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:25,000
Who does pizza well in fuck outside of
New York and the fucking east coast.

658
00:41:25,001 --> 00:41:29,620
This Guy Tim, Andrew Yola fucking
pizzas. Unbelievable. Unbelievable.

659
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:34,490
And then, uh, we had, uh, severe Jay.
Is that how you fucking Chetan yeah.

660
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,470
I don't know how to fucking say it.
Um,

661
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:42,410
on fucking believable food and the
restaurant. It's spelled t I m.

662
00:41:42,411 --> 00:41:42,591
O.

663
00:41:42,591 --> 00:41:45,980
I know I'm saying it wrong cause there's
a little fancy accent thing over the o

664
00:41:45,981 --> 00:41:50,210
team. I don't know how to say it, but
it's right on the beach. All right.

665
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:54,350
If you ever go down to south breach
and you bring your fucking lady,

666
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:58,840
then I can't say at t I
m m o with the fucking,

667
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:02,900
it's not the motley Crue two dots. It's
one of those little accent things. Um,

668
00:42:02,901 --> 00:42:07,700
so thank you to Tim. His
whole staff, everybody was,
was insane. And we came over,

669
00:42:07,701 --> 00:42:11,090
they was like, it was
like eight of us. Um,

670
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:15,450
and you know, I swear to God, he, they,
they would've still bring it bullpen,

671
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:18,860
bringing out food if we didn't,
if we didn't, if we didn't leave,

672
00:42:18,861 --> 00:42:20,650
it was one of the greatest I've ever been.
Uh,

673
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:27,080
treated on the road and uh,
you know, yeah. I don't know.

674
00:42:27,081 --> 00:42:30,080
It was, it was fucking insane. Um, so,

675
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:32,080
okay.

676
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:32,531
What else?

677
00:42:32,531 --> 00:42:36,340
What else am I going to talk about it
that I don't have any smooth transition

678
00:42:36,341 --> 00:42:39,430
from that to the next thing here.

679
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:44,750
I've been watching a bunch of shit on,
uh, on Netflix. I'm big on the, uh,

680
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:47,230
I like documentaries,
you know,

681
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:51,490
and I watched one and a half
last night before I fell asleep.

682
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,140
I watched this thing called the
queen of Versailles was she have to,

683
00:42:56,170 --> 00:43:00,400
you have to see, and it's basically
about this guy, 75 years old,

684
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,410
75 years old. He married Miss Florida,
1993. So he's fucking balling.

685
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:09,350
Has seven kids with her.
Right. And he's got this,

686
00:43:09,370 --> 00:43:14,000
he sells time shares,
you know, which you know,

687
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:18,650
is really a shady fucking
business, you know. Hey, you what?

688
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:23,630
I mean, I don't, I don't know. What
is it fucking time share? It's,

689
00:43:23,631 --> 00:43:26,190
it's, it's a, it's a fucking
overpriced hotel room, isn't it?

690
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:31,060
I mean,
I don't know.

691
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:34,070
What am I buying if I
spend all that money?

692
00:43:34,071 --> 00:43:36,650
I don't want to be laying in a bed
that somebody else has been fucking in.

693
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,960
I want a brand new bed. Okay. That's,

694
00:43:38,961 --> 00:43:40,760
that's deal number one
because other than that,

695
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,330
I can go lay in a bed that everybody
else fucked in all year long.

696
00:43:44,331 --> 00:43:48,350
It's called the hotel. Right. But
this guy hit, we had basically had,

697
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:51,630
was the biggest time share company,
um,

698
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:55,800
in the world according to him.
And uh,

699
00:43:56,120 --> 00:44:01,120
and he was in the middle of building the
biggest house in America and it had 10

700
00:44:01,641 --> 00:44:06,550
kitchens. This fucking nine people in
their family. They have one more kitchen.

701
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:09,520
Then they have people in their family.
All right.

702
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:13,090
You have to watch just to see them.
I mean,

703
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:15,550
it's not finished yet because in 2008,

704
00:44:15,551 --> 00:44:19,110
they got caught up on all
the bankers shit. And um,

705
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:24,250
but you just have to see when his wife
walks in with their friend and when they

706
00:44:24,251 --> 00:44:27,540
walk up these stairs, I'm telling
you, these fucking stairs are,

707
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:32,460
are wider than the stairs at
grand central in New York City.

708
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:38,990
They go upstairs and they'll
fucking friend of miss.

709
00:44:38,991 --> 00:44:42,050
Miss 1993 Florida goes is like,
you know,

710
00:44:42,051 --> 00:44:45,170
cause they haven't like put the walls
up. It's just the uh, the framing of it.

711
00:44:45,470 --> 00:44:49,970
She goes, oh my God. She goes, is
that your bedroom? And she goes, no,

712
00:44:49,971 --> 00:44:52,280
it's my closet.
It's fine.

713
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:55,970
But if you really want us,
okay,

714
00:44:56,210 --> 00:44:59,570
now a lot of people will watch the queen
of Versailles and go look at these two

715
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:02,380
selfish fucking people in all
the waste and all that apps.

716
00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:07,390
A fucking loofy lutely that's on the
fucking surface bond underneath all of it.

717
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:08,710
You,

718
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:13,710
you see a guy who doesn't want to declare
bankruptcy and put that money on the

719
00:45:13,761 --> 00:45:15,920
American people and wants
to fight his way out of it.

720
00:45:16,070 --> 00:45:20,060
And the bankers won't do it. Like he
had a building out in fucking Vegas.

721
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:25,180
He put 350 million of his own fucking
money in and now we can't make the

722
00:45:25,281 --> 00:45:29,210
payments. So he wants to
bankers to try and, you know,

723
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:32,930
give him some of the bailout money and
they kept all of it because this is the

724
00:45:32,931 --> 00:45:36,260
thing, if he fucking, if they
get him to default on that,

725
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:40,820
they get to keep his 350 million and
sell the fucking building all over again.

726
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:42,593
MMM.

727
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:45,750
You know, and obviously this
guy, he got over extended,

728
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:48,390
he made the mistake of not realizing,

729
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:50,653
you know,

730
00:45:52,070 --> 00:45:56,210
what bankers are and what it is that
they do. They're not your friends.

731
00:45:56,810 --> 00:45:59,480
They're not trying to help you
grow your fucking business.

732
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:03,260
They're trying to make every
fucking dime off you is they can.

733
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:07,010
And when it's over,
you're bus the joint out.

734
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:12,500
I just started thinking
about the, the fucking, uh,

735
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:14,600
good fellas when they
start burning it down,

736
00:46:14,601 --> 00:46:16,210
but rather than burning the place down,

737
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:20,880
they fucking did you that Ray Liotta
and fucking Joe Pesci a fucking tie in

738
00:46:20,881 --> 00:46:22,430
those little candle things to you.

739
00:46:24,330 --> 00:46:26,840
Trying to bang his fucking Jew brought
over here. You can't help me out.

740
00:46:27,290 --> 00:46:31,340
So well coming to, um, and then you
burn to the ground and that's it.

741
00:46:31,341 --> 00:46:34,190
But the building's still standing and
then they get some other group to go in

742
00:46:34,191 --> 00:46:37,130
there and then they fucked them
in the ass. I'm telling you.

743
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:39,130
Yeah,

744
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:40,990
we should all as civilians,

745
00:46:41,230 --> 00:46:44,590
you remember the ending of Scarface
when they were coming over the wall.

746
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:48,340
That's what we should be doing right now
in gated communities, going to bankers,

747
00:46:48,341 --> 00:46:50,410
fucking houses.
We should be dragging him,

748
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:55,330
dragging them out by the tassels
of their fucking wing tips. Um,

749
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:58,150
all right.
Anyways,

750
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:03,100
so I watched that phenomenal.
And it was sad.

751
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:06,820
It was also sad because you saw a guy
that was really into his business.

752
00:47:06,821 --> 00:47:08,320
But granted, I think also, you know,

753
00:47:08,350 --> 00:47:10,630
you have to find a through line
when you're filming something.

754
00:47:10,631 --> 00:47:13,910
Cause I think they initially
started the documentary, Eh,

755
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:17,110
I think it was an issue was going to be,
look how successful this guy is.

756
00:47:17,111 --> 00:47:19,780
And then that shit happened and
then it turned into something else.

757
00:47:19,781 --> 00:47:22,960
So I heard he sued the
makers of the documentary.

758
00:47:22,961 --> 00:47:27,850
But a phenomenal and the
music is, is incredible. Um,

759
00:47:27,910 --> 00:47:31,690
all right. And then I watched
another one about the serial killer,

760
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:36,310
Carl Pans, Ram, the spirit
of hatred and vengeance.

761
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:37,720
You got to fucking see this.

762
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:39,610
MMM.

763
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:40,443
He,

764
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:45,590
he writes this guard befriends him
and he writes a fucking book in jail.

765
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:51,800
And, uh, I forget how off I fuck it. I
Ha I had it in my head. How he said it.

766
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:53,180
They have the voiceover actor.
Good.

767
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:58,690
My name is Carl pay his rent and they've
killed over 22 people and committed

768
00:47:59,511 --> 00:48:03,710
over a thousand acts of sodomy.
How his book starts.

769
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:09,410
I got to buy the fucking book.
Um, let me, let me look this up.

770
00:48:09,411 --> 00:48:09,710
I'll read,

771
00:48:09,710 --> 00:48:12,950
I'll read you a little bit about this
guy and Wikipedia for some reason, like,

772
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:17,800
you know, a bunch of other people. Ted
Bundy, speaking of Florida state, Dude,

773
00:48:17,801 --> 00:48:21,890
you know what? Florida state where Ted
Bundy killed those three sorority girls.

774
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:22,760
Um,

775
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:26,780
they still use that house is a sorority
house that should fucking blew me away.

776
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:30,920
Fucking blew me away. Like
how, how, how in God's name.

777
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:36,430
Now I'm not into ghosts. I don't
believe in that shit. But, uh, I,

778
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:37,760
I do draw a line.

779
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:43,110
I don't think that I,

780
00:48:43,111 --> 00:48:48,111
I could sleep in that fucking house
knowing that all that shit like happened.

781
00:48:52,370 --> 00:48:55,850
All right, here we go. Let's
just re Carl Pants rim here. Um,

782
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:59,270
it wasn't American serial killer,
rapists, arsonists and burglar.

783
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:01,273
MMM.

784
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:05,980
Here we go. He's known for his confession.
So who was only friend? Prison Guard,

785
00:49:05,981 --> 00:49:10,870
Henry Lesser. Let's get
to this killing spree, uh,

786
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:13,010
put up a, the total, you know. Hmm.

787
00:49:16,510 --> 00:49:19,150
What the fuck is he basically,
he used to have,

788
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:24,180
he had a boat and he would get sailors
drunk and he would bring these guys back

789
00:49:24,311 --> 00:49:25,180
to the boat.

790
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:29,440
He'd fucking sodomized them and then
shoot him in the head and throw him

791
00:49:29,441 --> 00:49:33,550
overboard. One of those evil
fucking things. That was basically,

792
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:36,940
that happened when he was a kid. He got
fucking raped. And then he was like,

793
00:49:36,941 --> 00:49:40,600
all right, well, I'm fucking
rape. And everybody else. I mean,

794
00:49:40,601 --> 00:49:44,440
the guy was just fucking, yeah.
Let me look up some quotes.

795
00:49:44,441 --> 00:49:47,170
I don't want a creepy guys out. This
would be turned into a creepy podcast,

796
00:49:47,171 --> 00:49:48,460
but I just never heard of this guy.

797
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:50,593
MMM.

798
00:49:52,530 --> 00:49:54,550
Calm around.
Where the fuck is it?

799
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:02,120
All right. There's some website, the
11 most bad ass words ever uttered.

800
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:06,080
I hate when I do this. Do Guys want
to just start surfing the fucking net?

801
00:50:07,230 --> 00:50:08,063
All right.

802
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:15,110
Hurry up. You. Who's your bastard? I could
kill 10 men while you're fooling around.

803
00:50:17,310 --> 00:50:21,030
I Dunno. You know, it kind of
helps if you have the context. Oh,

804
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:22,620
I was that when they went to kill him.

805
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:26,580
Everyone hopes to leave a legacy to be
remembered after our passing did have up

806
00:50:26,581 --> 00:50:27,300
it up.
Put it there.

807
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:30,830
Some people try to pull off in mortality
with the lifetime of achievement and

808
00:50:30,831 --> 00:50:31,664
noble acts,

809
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:36,790
but why piss away all that energy when
you can simply spout one badass quote

810
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:40,400
before you take a dirt nap
and live on through eternity

811
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:45,660
known as a guy who needed a
second casket for his balls.

812
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:49,230
The last words of Carl
Pans Ram when they will.

813
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:53,190
He said, hurry up. You,
who's your bastard?

814
00:50:53,210 --> 00:50:57,710
I could kill 10 men while
you're fooling around. Um,

815
00:50:57,790 --> 00:51:00,730
who is your summary From Indiana?
Uh, but, uh, put up a Duh

816
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:07,530
Carl pans ramp did make an interesting
point about the mire of bureaucracy

817
00:51:07,531 --> 00:51:10,450
versus individual enterprise
if you guys are executing.

818
00:51:11,870 --> 00:51:12,620
Okay.

819
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:14,990
Elbit yeah. Basically thought
they were taking too long.

820
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:17,753
Okay.

821
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,860
Wow. This is great man. This
is all people's last words.

822
00:51:19,890 --> 00:51:24,270
Last words of chief sitting bull.
I'm not going do with me.

823
00:51:24,271 --> 00:51:25,710
What you like.
I'm not going.

824
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:26,980
Okay

825
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:29,890
then. Exclamation point. Come on.
Come on and take action. Let's go.

826
00:51:31,610 --> 00:51:35,390
I guess that was back. Uh, you want to
fucking do this? Let's do this. That was,

827
00:51:35,391 --> 00:51:38,330
that's how they said it
in the 18 hundreds. Um,

828
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:41,450
and he's also speaking a second language.
That's how much balls he had.

829
00:51:41,990 --> 00:51:43,880
He still sounded tough
in another language.

830
00:51:44,770 --> 00:51:45,603
MMM.

831
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:50,920
No. The guy before he got hanged,
the last words of George Angle,

832
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:56,020
union activist and founder of the
Socialist Labor Party be standard with the

833
00:51:56,021 --> 00:51:58,900
fucking rope around his neck.
He said, hooray for anarchy.

834
00:51:59,110 --> 00:52:01,120
This is the happiest moment of my life.

835
00:52:06,930 --> 00:52:09,380
All right,
I got to read them all now.

836
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:13,150
Just when you thought you
had a fucking pair, it,

837
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:15,740
we go Gil's Corey.

838
00:52:16,130 --> 00:52:20,720
Last words of a farmer accused of being
a witch, wellbeing crushed with stones.

839
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,490
He said more weight.

840
00:52:28,070 --> 00:52:32,360
Uh, James French convicted
word murderer, putting a death,

841
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:34,880
um,
in the electric chair.

842
00:52:37,390 --> 00:52:40,000
Oh, his name is James
French. He goes, hey fellas,

843
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:44,020
how about this for a headline for
tomorrow's paper? French fries.

844
00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:45,620
Okay.

845
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:48,510
Oops, sorry. I'm a joy in
this. I hope you are too.

846
00:52:49,690 --> 00:52:50,650
Uh,

847
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:56,270
last words of the hipster hero.
How do you say his name?

848
00:52:57,110 --> 00:53:00,980
Che Guevara and the one that
everybody has on the tee shirt.

849
00:53:00,981 --> 00:53:01,701
I don't know what he did.

850
00:53:01,701 --> 00:53:04,610
He was friends with fucking the beer
to bastard down there and then all of a

851
00:53:04,611 --> 00:53:08,690
sudden he went down. He was going to
play baseball. All those Cuban rebels,

852
00:53:08,691 --> 00:53:11,450
at some point they were going to play
baseball. They fucking love the game,

853
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:13,410
I believe. What's his face? Uh,

854
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:16,820
Castro pitched in the farm
league and the Colt 45.

855
00:53:18,530 --> 00:53:19,460
Uh,
all right.

856
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:21,330
Okay.

857
00:53:21,330 --> 00:53:24,000
This is what this was it Che Guevara.
His last words were,

858
00:53:24,001 --> 00:53:27,840
I know you're going to kill. Shoot,
you're only going to kill a man.

859
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:30,233
Jesus.

860
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:31,370
Okay.

861
00:53:31,370 --> 00:53:34,010
I hope that they don't have,
if I'm going out like that,

862
00:53:34,011 --> 00:53:36,830
they better not have my last words cause
I'm going to sound like the biggest

863
00:53:36,831 --> 00:53:37,664
pussy ever,

864
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:50,690
you know, just thinking of
it was what's his face? Uh,

865
00:53:50,691 --> 00:53:54,560
I can't remember anybody's fucking names.
I got to get this one right.

866
00:53:56,590 --> 00:53:59,320
I gotta get this name right
off. I can't, I can't do this

867
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:04,650
a fucking, uh, I, I'm a moron.

868
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:10,380
This goes to go back to the podcast. I
was thinking of the, who's the guy plays?

869
00:54:10,381 --> 00:54:15,150
Macgruber we'll uh, it's too many wills.
Will Ferrell will our net. It's not that.

870
00:54:15,151 --> 00:54:18,330
It's fucking,
I'm the worst.

871
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:20,160
How he would always do that thing.

872
00:54:20,161 --> 00:54:23,550
What do you would get into a jam and
just be like, I will suck your Dick.

873
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:30,210
I would have some awful fucking
quote like that. I would,

874
00:54:30,870 --> 00:54:35,820
I don't want to die. Don't kill me. Please
do not kill me. All right, here we go.

875
00:54:35,821 --> 00:54:40,530
Some fucking, um, I got to look. I'm
going to look up his fucking name.

876
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:44,400
Okay. Addicted to who was, hey,

877
00:54:44,401 --> 00:54:46,740
bill loved the podcast.
I could use a bit of advice.

878
00:54:46,741 --> 00:54:50,430
I'm a 30 year old man and have a bit
of a problem over the past few years,

879
00:54:50,431 --> 00:54:53,790
I've become addicted to horse,
not just typical bar sluts,

880
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:58,710
but full blown professionals.
So GJ um,

881
00:54:59,070 --> 00:55:02,940
it's gotten so bad that I researched the
girls that I see in the majority of my

882
00:55:02,941 --> 00:55:07,260
time consists of going through message
boards and underground communities filled

883
00:55:07,261 --> 00:55:12,261
with other pervs like myself
who review working girls.

884
00:55:13,150 --> 00:55:15,570
All right, dude, you're going
down a dark fucking hole.

885
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:17,100
I fortunately never went down.

886
00:55:18,910 --> 00:55:19,743
Uh,

887
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:26,280
I'm already in over my head here,
but you know, whatever you wrote it.

888
00:55:26,310 --> 00:55:30,480
So I'm going to fucking try and answer
it knowing full well that I am not a

889
00:55:30,481 --> 00:55:32,580
professional sir. Um, he says,

890
00:55:32,581 --> 00:55:37,581
my problem is that I have
become so addicted to this
lifestyle that I cannot see

891
00:55:38,791 --> 00:55:42,300
myself having a traditional relationship
with the woman. Yeah, absolutely.

892
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:48,120
Absolutely. You Open
Pandora's box. You know, dude,

893
00:55:48,121 --> 00:55:48,451
you're,
you're,

894
00:55:48,451 --> 00:55:52,080
you have a woman who will do whatever
you want and you don't have to be

895
00:55:52,081 --> 00:55:55,050
emotionally there for, you don't have
to wipe your feet off. You could just,

896
00:55:55,110 --> 00:55:58,980
you know, talk to wherever you want.
Give her some money and then she leaves.

897
00:55:59,910 --> 00:56:00,930
You don't even have to cuddle.

898
00:56:01,890 --> 00:56:05,490
You have zero emotional responsibility.

899
00:56:07,050 --> 00:56:07,883
You know,

900
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:11,640
that's like somebody rich who's been
fucking flying around in their own jet and

901
00:56:11,641 --> 00:56:14,280
then all of a sudden, you know,
this shit goes down like, and that,

902
00:56:14,281 --> 00:56:16,740
that queen of Versailles and all of a
sudden they have to get on a commercial

903
00:56:16,741 --> 00:56:20,760
flight and that kids are looking around.
God, why are all these people on a plane?

904
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:26,500
You're in the same place. Your Dick
is like a billionaire, you know,

905
00:56:26,501 --> 00:56:29,110
and if you get door fucking relationship,
but that this point,

906
00:56:29,111 --> 00:56:33,160
that's like the 2008 collapse,
you know?

907
00:56:33,870 --> 00:56:35,170
Does that make any sense?
All right.

908
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:38,050
After experiencing this
lifestyle for so long,

909
00:56:38,051 --> 00:56:42,490
I just cannot force myself to sit at a
bar trying to convince some chick who's

910
00:56:42,491 --> 00:56:46,300
best years are behind her to
give me a halfhearted. Bj,

911
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:49,690
um,
I consider myself a decent looking guy.

912
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:52,240
I think you consider yourself
a lot more than that, sir.

913
00:56:52,930 --> 00:56:56,260
I think you stand in front of the
mirror with your hands on your sides.

914
00:56:56,290 --> 00:57:00,850
Like Superman, not hands on your hips,
hands on your hips, that's a feminine.

915
00:57:00,970 --> 00:57:03,730
But if you stand there with
your two fists like that,

916
00:57:03,731 --> 00:57:08,020
then all of a sudden you look like you
should have a Cape flapping behind Ya. Um,

917
00:57:08,021 --> 00:57:11,830
I think you do that, you stand
there and you're naked, you know,

918
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:16,030
with like the same distance between your
feet that a state trooper has when it

919
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:18,040
comes up going dude,
how fast you were going,

920
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:22,020
and then you look to the
side with your Dick flap,

921
00:57:22,021 --> 00:57:25,900
but it in the wing because
of the oscillating fan. Yeah.
Then you'd every morning,

922
00:57:26,070 --> 00:57:28,210
God,
I am not sure.

923
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:33,750
Uh, that's how I think you feel about
yourself. That I would just guess.

924
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,140
Um,
anyways,

925
00:57:37,950 --> 00:57:40,740
I think I'm a decent looking guy and
I do get attention from the women,

926
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:44,880
but I often find that they are not
worth the effort because I get bored so

927
00:57:44,881 --> 00:57:48,810
quickly. Yeah. I know actually having to
converse rather than just being like, hey,

928
00:57:48,811 --> 00:57:51,690
how much for you to suck my Dick?
Oh yeah,

929
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:55,950
I'll give you a half that good. My work
with me meet. I'll meet you in the middle.

930
00:57:56,580 --> 00:58:01,440
I'll give you an extra five cause it's
cold out. All right, get in the car. Um,

931
00:58:01,470 --> 00:58:04,680
my problem is that I get bored with women
immediately after I sleep with them.

932
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:08,120
I do not fear diseases as I
always use condoms though.

933
00:58:08,130 --> 00:58:11,520
That's not 100% by the way.
I don't know why, but it is.

934
00:58:11,610 --> 00:58:14,430
I don't know how you can have a raincoat
on your Dick and still get herpes I

935
00:58:14,431 --> 00:58:17,430
think cause your balls are fucking
hanging out of the back of the chopper,

936
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:21,810
you know,
and safety.

937
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:24,090
I always use condoms and safety

938
00:58:26,490 --> 00:58:29,710
and safety wise,
I love when you guys like rewrite your,

939
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:35,010
your fucking emails and then you delete
half a sentence and then you fucking

940
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:38,040
don't notice and then you put it in here
and you make me look even dumber than I

941
00:58:38,041 --> 00:58:40,620
am anyway.
So I guess he uses condoms.

942
00:58:40,621 --> 00:58:44,940
He said it would be Doobie
just as dangerous sleeping
with a random bar slut who

943
00:58:44,941 --> 00:58:48,780
doesn't force their partners to
use condoms? Uh, no it wasn't sir.

944
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:51,750
No it wouldn't because it's
a numbers thing. Alright.

945
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:56,820
Some bar slut who doesn't
use condoms versus some woman
who fucks professionally.

946
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:57,571
Okay.

947
00:58:57,571 --> 00:59:00,450
That's like you throwing the football
around in the back yard saying you just

948
00:59:00,451 --> 00:59:03,120
like Tom Brady. Okay. Did,
it's not the same thing,

949
00:59:03,121 --> 00:59:06,930
but I know you're saying
that to make yourself feel
better, feel better. He said,

950
00:59:06,931 --> 00:59:11,070
I fear never being able to have a normal
relationship with a woman down the road.

951
00:59:11,310 --> 00:59:15,690
I feel like my internal wiring got crossed
somewhere and I need a wide variety

952
00:59:15,691 --> 00:59:19,200
of women to keep me sane.
I really want to fuck every woman I see.

953
00:59:19,201 --> 00:59:23,660
But unfortunately I can cannot a
golf club, so I got to pay for it

954
00:59:25,370 --> 00:59:28,760
anyway. Out of this love the podcast.
Yeah. I you need to go to therapy.

955
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:31,603
Um,

956
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:33,170
okay.

957
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:36,480
I gotta tell you though, once you,
once you, I dunno. Yeah. You, you need,

958
00:59:36,481 --> 00:59:39,800
you need to go seek professional
help, sir. I would, I would.

959
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,760
I would say that because,
uh,

960
00:59:43,670 --> 00:59:47,210
you've gone down a road for so long and
you keep coming around the track the

961
00:59:47,211 --> 00:59:52,180
same way you've worn this grooving and
it's very hard to get out of. And, uh,

962
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:54,480
you have to sit down and
want to do the work and you,

963
00:59:54,481 --> 00:59:59,481
you have to work with professional and
figure out if you have a sex addiction

964
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:04,130
addiction or whatever. One
of the doctor drew, you know,

965
01:00:04,131 --> 01:00:06,800
if they can't afford it, I would
call doctor drew. But even then,

966
01:00:06,830 --> 01:00:10,400
he's only going to talk to you for a
minute to have him guide you in the right

967
01:00:10,401 --> 01:00:13,460
direction though. Uh, because that guy is,

968
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:17,920
is he kind of keep gets right to it.
I've done a show a couple of times,

969
01:00:17,930 --> 01:00:21,770
he's fucking unreal. Um, so
that would be my suggestion.

970
01:00:22,490 --> 01:00:24,590
I would say at first and foremost,

971
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:28,850
stop fucking prostitutes because you
are going to catch something and every,

972
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:33,230
and not only that, every, every one that
you bang or have blow you or whatever,

973
01:00:33,231 --> 01:00:37,010
it's just another step further down
a direction you don't want to go.

974
01:00:38,690 --> 01:00:42,530
And then also, it's a terrible
thing to do, you know,

975
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:45,340
to solicit a prostitute.
You're basically, you know,

976
01:00:45,450 --> 01:00:48,980
something horrible happened to her
and then you take an advantage of it.

977
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:53,480
It's fucking horrific.
Um, so they, you go,

978
01:00:53,481 --> 01:00:55,640
I hope I helped you. I know I gave
you a lot of shit throughout that,

979
01:00:55,641 --> 01:00:58,250
but I hope it helps you out because
that is a serious problem. Okay.

980
01:00:58,470 --> 01:01:02,270
House Derris Billy boy,
keeping it short and sweet duty.

981
01:01:02,271 --> 01:01:06,590
Your undying hatred for reading out
loud. I actually don't mind it. I just,

982
01:01:06,650 --> 01:01:09,460
I hate sounding stupid.
Uh,

983
01:01:09,830 --> 01:01:14,600
my fiance and I are moving
into our first house on Friday.

984
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:18,640
Any last minute advice?
Yes.

985
01:01:20,270 --> 01:01:23,510
Um, well, it's too late. You
already bought a fucking house.

986
01:01:24,590 --> 01:01:29,360
My first thing would be drive
less of a car, wear less clothes,

987
01:01:30,230 --> 01:01:35,210
everything less and start
knocking out the principal.

988
01:01:35,780 --> 01:01:40,010
All right. You got to start
knocking that fucking thing down.

989
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:41,873
MMM.

990
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:45,480
And when they, then once you
knock it down to a certain point,

991
01:01:45,690 --> 01:01:48,510
then they're going to come at you and
be like, Hey, do you want to refinance?

992
01:01:48,511 --> 01:01:50,370
You want to refinance?
Look,

993
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:53,520
your mortgage payment will go
from 1500 down to 1200 dental.

994
01:01:53,521 --> 01:01:55,980
Save you 300 bucks a month.
That's all a fucking scam.

995
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:57,793
Okay.

996
01:01:58,930 --> 01:02:01,600
You really think there's somebody who
works at the bank and his job and he's

997
01:02:01,601 --> 01:02:05,560
sitting there going, how can this bank
make less money? Oh, I know what I mean.

998
01:02:05,561 --> 01:02:07,420
How long would that guy worked
there before we get fired?

999
01:02:07,421 --> 01:02:10,450
It's a scam because what happens is if
you like four or five years into your

1000
01:02:10,451 --> 01:02:11,140
mortgage,

1001
01:02:11,140 --> 01:02:15,850
they're going to refinance it and your
payment doesn't go down 300 bucks and

1002
01:02:15,851 --> 01:02:20,040
you're still five years in, it
starts back at zero. All right?

1003
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:23,580
Now you have that payment for 30 years
and you're starting all fucking over

1004
01:02:23,581 --> 01:02:26,430
again. So the 300 bucks that
you're saving each month,

1005
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:29,610
they make it more in the fucking interest
in the long run because they sent you

1006
01:02:29,611 --> 01:02:34,200
back to square one.
It's all a fucking scam of telling you,

1007
01:02:34,201 --> 01:02:38,140
go to the gate communities and
go over the fucking wall. Um,

1008
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:42,210
don't really do that. All right? I don't
want to be held responsible for that. Um,

1009
01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:48,590
these are all jokes. Wink, wink,
nudge, nudge. Um, all right.

1010
01:02:48,591 --> 01:02:50,420
Any other advice?
Yeah,

1011
01:02:51,740 --> 01:02:52,310
yeah.

1012
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:55,400
Don't let you fucking lady.
Let,

1013
01:02:55,401 --> 01:02:58,160
let your woman have the
fucking dining room.

1014
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:02,840
Let her have the fucking,
uh, living room. All right?

1015
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:06,770
But you, you have to stake
your fucking claim in there.

1016
01:03:07,510 --> 01:03:07,870
Okay?

1017
01:03:07,870 --> 01:03:11,350
Don't let her turn it into a fucking
doll house the same way she wouldn't want

1018
01:03:11,351 --> 01:03:13,900
to be living right in some fucking,
you know,

1019
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:17,800
House that looks like a sports bar,
you know,

1020
01:03:17,801 --> 01:03:22,390
and you got some fucking deer head
in a keg on tap and all that shit.

1021
01:03:22,391 --> 01:03:26,560
You know what I mean?
But just like I would say steak,

1022
01:03:26,561 --> 01:03:29,620
you're fucking claim in the
house and just say, listen,

1023
01:03:29,621 --> 01:03:33,580
I want this house to be a representative
represent presentation of both of us.

1024
01:03:34,070 --> 01:03:34,903
All right?

1025
01:03:35,610 --> 01:03:36,130
Okay.

1026
01:03:36,130 --> 01:03:38,560
And uh,
if it goes too far one way or the other,

1027
01:03:38,561 --> 01:03:41,890
I don't think the other person is
going to be happy and just say, listen,

1028
01:03:41,891 --> 01:03:44,140
I don't care what you do with this.
I don't care what you do with this room.

1029
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:49,320
Just pick yourself a rumor to cause this
sort of unwritten rule is that the guy

1030
01:03:49,781 --> 01:03:54,190
gets one room and it's the
darkest kv just fucking place.

1031
01:03:54,690 --> 01:03:58,810
It's the basement. It's the fucking
garage and a, it's bullshit.

1032
01:04:00,250 --> 01:04:04,390
It's bullshit. Okay. So
that's what I would say.

1033
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:06,790
Make sure that when people walk in,

1034
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,100
they can immediately see
that you live there too.

1035
01:04:10,060 --> 01:04:14,410
That's something with a set of balls
is actually in that fucking house.

1036
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:18,640
All right. And that's it. Good luck
with your marriage then. Your new house.

1037
01:04:18,641 --> 01:04:23,210
Congratulations. Pay Down the fucking
principal, sir. Get the shackles off Ya.

1038
01:04:23,830 --> 01:04:28,160
All right. Crazy ass
mom. Hey Bill. What's up?

1039
01:04:28,670 --> 01:04:31,580
My name is Hector. I'm from,
I'm a full time college student.

1040
01:04:31,581 --> 01:04:36,440
My life is fairly well. I get good
grades and shit. Big family. One,

1041
01:04:36,441 --> 01:04:40,160
a seven boy refinance with some new put.
Uh,

1042
01:04:41,980 --> 01:04:46,970
start it back to square one. Uh,
when was that? When I was little,

1043
01:04:47,180 --> 01:04:51,290
she was basically trying to steal me from
my father and taking all of his money

1044
01:04:51,291 --> 01:04:54,260
in the process. Hell
hath no fury, sir. Also,

1045
01:04:54,261 --> 01:04:58,220
she used to beat me like a red headed
stepchild. I find that offensive.

1046
01:04:59,160 --> 01:04:59,380
Okay.

1047
01:04:59,380 --> 01:05:01,690
All right. You want my
advice? Stone itself. Me?

1048
01:05:02,270 --> 01:05:02,580
Yeah.

1049
01:05:02,580 --> 01:05:03,480
All right,
Hector,

1050
01:05:07,580 --> 01:05:09,650
you don't what? I always
got childish. It made, uh,

1051
01:05:09,651 --> 01:05:13,130
made some joke about your change steering
wheel because you name is Hector.

1052
01:05:13,131 --> 01:05:16,040
But then I realized that that would
insult other Mexicans and I'm not like you

1053
01:05:16,041 --> 01:05:18,190
sir. I'm gonna, I'm gonna,
I'm take the high road here.

1054
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:22,610
It just say that I wish you would've
chosen your words a little more carefully.

1055
01:05:23,230 --> 01:05:25,230
All right. And, uh, tell me. Okay.

1056
01:05:25,250 --> 01:05:29,480
Bb like a redheaded stepchild
and tell him, tell me.

1057
01:05:29,481 --> 01:05:34,310
My Dad did not love me, so I
would stop asking for him. Wow.

1058
01:05:35,390 --> 01:05:37,430
Yeah. That's, um,

1059
01:05:37,790 --> 01:05:42,290
that's something that parents do during
divorce on both sides. They use the kids.

1060
01:05:42,291 --> 01:05:46,280
That's, I'm so glad that never happened
to me and I got fucked up in other ways.

1061
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:48,530
Uh,
this fucker left.

1062
01:05:48,531 --> 01:05:53,531
My father was so little money that he
had no money to pay the light bill and

1063
01:05:53,691 --> 01:05:54,350
other shit.

1064
01:05:54,350 --> 01:05:58,610
My Mom's stupid ass brother held a gun
up to my father's head and said he would

1065
01:05:58,611 --> 01:06:01,730
blow his head off because he
got my mom pregnant with me.

1066
01:06:02,090 --> 01:06:05,810
My Mother's dad was also,
um,

1067
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:10,550
an ultra can't. Yeah. So he was familiar
with, constantly went out and married it.

1068
01:06:11,450 --> 01:06:16,130
Hopefully he fucking corrected
the problem. Cheeses.

1069
01:06:16,131 --> 01:06:18,850
You giving me the whole
family tree here, sir. Um,

1070
01:06:18,860 --> 01:06:23,660
since then she had gotten remarried
and then divorced a fucking gun.

1071
01:06:23,670 --> 01:06:27,470
He says the problem is after all that
shit, I can't stand even look at my mom.

1072
01:06:27,620 --> 01:06:32,030
How do I tell her to basically fuck
off this fucking podcast is the fucking

1073
01:06:32,031 --> 01:06:34,940
shit. Don't stop you redheaded
maniac. All right. There.

1074
01:06:34,941 --> 01:06:38,450
He made it up with something
positive towards redheads.

1075
01:06:38,930 --> 01:06:41,600
Thanks for your important. No.
Yeah, go fuck yourself. Um,

1076
01:06:45,190 --> 01:06:47,080
no,
this is very touchy because you know,

1077
01:06:47,081 --> 01:06:50,440
as much as you consider your biological
mother, your mother, this is your mother.

1078
01:06:51,250 --> 01:06:55,480
So, um, I don't know how that works
because I've never been in this situation,

1079
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:58,000
so I wouldn't tell you.

1080
01:06:58,820 --> 01:06:59,280
Okay.

1081
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:00,960
Your first mother to fuck off.

1082
01:07:01,890 --> 01:07:02,340
Yeah.

1083
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:06,990
What I would do is I would have,
um,

1084
01:07:08,590 --> 01:07:09,423
yeah,

1085
01:07:09,550 --> 01:07:11,980
she is your mom. So I
would, I would have a,

1086
01:07:11,981 --> 01:07:14,200
just a very controlled
relationship with her.

1087
01:07:14,710 --> 01:07:16,810
Like I would meet her at restaurants,

1088
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:21,060
I'd meet her in public and
have lunch with, be okay.

1089
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:24,100
Got To get on with my week and that
way, you know, that way itself,

1090
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:26,650
when she dies some day, you don't
have this regret that, uh, you know,

1091
01:07:27,190 --> 01:07:30,670
I hated my own mother.
What does it mean? Um,

1092
01:07:31,890 --> 01:07:35,250
and then I would just do happy mom shit
with, with your non biological mother,

1093
01:07:36,390 --> 01:07:40,380
you know, just smile and wave, go
through the motions with there. But, um,

1094
01:07:41,540 --> 01:07:42,373
I dunno,

1095
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:47,570
I'd say I'd say maybe therapy call you
call your mom a cunt in therapy rather

1096
01:07:47,571 --> 01:07:50,000
than to her face. Cause it's, it's
not going to get you anywhere.

1097
01:07:50,450 --> 01:07:53,210
And as you get older and she gets older,
it's just,

1098
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:54,710
it's not going to be a good fucking thing.

1099
01:07:54,711 --> 01:07:58,730
But I totally have empathy for
the situation that you're in.

1100
01:07:58,790 --> 01:08:02,840
I would just treat my biological mother
as my real mother and I would have a

1101
01:08:02,841 --> 01:08:07,640
respectful relationship with
my, uh, my original mother.

1102
01:08:08,210 --> 01:08:11,840
And, uh, when she started talking crazy
and everything, just be like, listen,

1103
01:08:11,870 --> 01:08:13,970
you know, you said that
stuff to me when I was a kid.

1104
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:18,200
It caused a lot damage to me and,
um, I don't want to hear your trash,

1105
01:08:18,201 --> 01:08:21,500
my dad anymore. Uh, I respect
how you feel about him,

1106
01:08:21,501 --> 01:08:23,960
but I don't want to hear about it because
you have to understand that that's my

1107
01:08:23,961 --> 01:08:28,490
father. All right? And if
she has a problem with that,

1108
01:08:28,491 --> 01:08:29,650
you just go check please.

1109
01:08:30,710 --> 01:08:31,210
Yeah.

1110
01:08:31,210 --> 01:08:34,540
Now you go, she wants to make a scene
and throw some bread or route, then a,

1111
01:08:34,541 --> 01:08:37,620
then you got to be like, listen, you
know I can't, I can't hang out with you.

1112
01:08:37,670 --> 01:08:41,170
You're crazy. Trashing my dad. You're
throwing appetizers around the road.

1113
01:08:42,460 --> 01:08:43,293
Okay.

1114
01:08:43,750 --> 01:08:48,670
I will have dinner with you again when
you can show to me that you can act like

1115
01:08:48,671 --> 01:08:52,360
an adult.
Maybe you can just lay the ground rules.

1116
01:08:53,350 --> 01:08:54,370
This is how it's going to be.

1117
01:08:54,371 --> 01:08:57,430
We are meeting at restaurants and you
going to behave like an adult and you are

1118
01:08:57,431 --> 01:09:01,540
not going to trash my father.
Okay? We're going to sit here.

1119
01:09:01,541 --> 01:09:05,830
We're going to talk about the weather and
what's going on in our lives right now.

1120
01:09:05,831 --> 01:09:10,360
We're not talking about the past anymore.
That's, that's what I need from you.

1121
01:09:10,390 --> 01:09:12,970
If you can't give me that,
then I'm not going to the olive garden.

1122
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:13,933
Okay?

1123
01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:17,810
There you go. Sir. I hope that works
for you. All right, relationship advice?

1124
01:09:17,870 --> 01:09:22,580
I'm pregnant. Oh, okay. Hey,

1125
01:09:22,581 --> 01:09:26,960
Mister Bill. I'm a 21 year old pregnant
girl who lives in Shit town, Illinois.

1126
01:09:27,590 --> 01:09:31,130
I moved here a little over a year ago
to be with my boyfriend who I met on

1127
01:09:31,131 --> 01:09:32,240
match.com

Illinois.
There's a fucking one for everybody.

1130
01:09:43,731 --> 01:09:48,200
Do not go on match.com those stupid
commercials. They show everybody happy.

1131
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:52,640
Everybody playing Frisbee
women jumping into guys arms.

1132
01:09:52,650 --> 01:09:56,580
Zani you see some 20 year old girl got
knocked up by some cut and fucking Shit

1133
01:09:56,580 --> 01:10:00,740
Town Illinois? I don't think so.
Hey Sweetheart, you know what?

1134
01:10:00,741 --> 01:10:04,100
You're already a great person because
you'll let us know what happens@match.com.

1135
01:10:04,630 --> 01:10:08,300
Um, everything was great at first that
I realized how much I fucking hate this

1136
01:10:08,301 --> 01:10:12,800
place. This town is such a cunt
and that includes the people in it.

1137
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:16,040
I've been telling him that and I'm
unhappy for at least six months,

1138
01:10:16,041 --> 01:10:19,130
but he doesn't seem to care. Oh, see,
you don't really have a problem with him.

1139
01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:24,050
Yeah. Great. Now I have a slander
case with fucking match.com he said,

1140
01:10:24,051 --> 01:10:28,070
now I'm pregnant with his child and have
the opportunity to move to Arizona to

1141
01:10:28,071 --> 01:10:30,740
be with my parents.
I told them that I'm going to go,

1142
01:10:30,741 --> 01:10:35,060
but he said that he would absolutely,
absolutely would not follow me there.

1143
01:10:35,270 --> 01:10:39,380
He said he loves this place because it
has a lot of outdoor activities and he

1144
01:10:39,381 --> 01:10:42,110
loves his job.
This is not as hometown.

1145
01:10:42,140 --> 01:10:45,350
He makes $9 an hour
being a bicycle mechanic.

1146
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:49,790
I told them there are bike shops all
around the country and he can find another

1147
01:10:49,791 --> 01:10:54,080
fucking job, especially since he is
former military. He doesn't care.

1148
01:10:54,140 --> 01:10:56,240
He's a stubborn ass.
What the fuck do I do?

1149
01:10:56,510 --> 01:11:00,200
This place has turned me into a depressed
bitch and I hate myself for it and I

1150
01:11:00,201 --> 01:11:02,780
don't want to bring the baby
into that kind of whirl.

1151
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:07,280
Hopefully you can shed some wisdom on
this for me. I Dunno. This is a rough one.

1152
01:11:07,310 --> 01:11:11,350
So you're basically going to move to
where you want to live and then he's going

1153
01:11:11,351 --> 01:11:14,780
to become you. That's
what worried about, um,

1154
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:21,840
do you have some sort of job
opportunities in Arizona?

1155
01:11:23,140 --> 01:11:24,040
MMM.

1156
01:11:25,570 --> 01:11:28,840
Cause you know, along with having
bike shops all around the country,

1157
01:11:28,841 --> 01:11:30,190
they also have outdoors.

1158
01:11:31,060 --> 01:11:31,440
Yeah.

1159
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,480
You can go outdoors
anywhere in the country.

1160
01:11:33,570 --> 01:11:36,120
That's one of the greatest things
about the United States and Russia.

1161
01:11:36,121 --> 01:11:38,190
They can't go outdoors wherever they go.
You know,

1162
01:11:39,710 --> 01:11:42,500
you could send to Siberia and shit.
You are a fucking indoors.

1163
01:11:42,970 --> 01:11:43,803
All right?

1164
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:50,080
Getting fucking raped in the ass and
all you can feel is somebody mittens on

1165
01:11:50,081 --> 01:11:50,914
your hips.

1166
01:11:56,430 --> 01:11:57,220
Oh,

1167
01:11:57,220 --> 01:11:59,850
that's one of the fucking most
evil jokes I've ever made.

1168
01:12:00,740 --> 01:12:01,573
MMM.

1169
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:07,630
All right. What am I talking about? What
do you do? A sweetheart? I don't know.

1170
01:12:08,830 --> 01:12:09,510
Okay.

1171
01:12:09,510 --> 01:12:11,700
If the guy's fucking
that level of stubborn,

1172
01:12:14,900 --> 01:12:17,730
I, I honestly, you know
what I, you stumped me.

1173
01:12:18,810 --> 01:12:21,810
I know you're fucking punching
your fucking iPod right now.

1174
01:12:21,811 --> 01:12:23,820
What have you listened to the
song? What do you what? All right,

1175
01:12:23,821 --> 01:12:26,160
what would I do if I was a pregnant lady?

1176
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:28,880
MMM.

1177
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:33,760
Well, here's the question. How do you
feel about this guy? Do you love this guy?

1178
01:12:33,761 --> 01:12:35,080
He's just the guy you're going to marry.

1179
01:12:36,780 --> 01:12:37,613
MMM.

1180
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:42,500
If that's the deal,
then I don't know you.

1181
01:12:42,501 --> 01:12:46,150
You got to try and work something out
because you guys are together and you got

1182
01:12:46,151 --> 01:12:49,950
to do, you've got to try and
do what's best for the kid.

1183
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,700
But if this guy isn't the guy that I
don't know what to tell you that I read,

1184
01:12:53,710 --> 01:12:56,760
I think he's some great advice.

1185
01:12:56,761 --> 01:13:01,540
Don't get fucking pregnant by your
boyfriend at 21 I mean, I don't,

1186
01:13:01,541 --> 01:13:04,020
I don't want to tell you here you really,
you know what?

1187
01:13:04,021 --> 01:13:06,270
You really painted yourself into a corner.

1188
01:13:08,170 --> 01:13:10,120
I think what you have
to do is you have to,

1189
01:13:10,270 --> 01:13:12,460
you gotta man up and make a decision here.

1190
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:13,990
Okay?

1191
01:13:13,990 --> 01:13:17,080
You have to make a decision what's best
for your baby because now you're in this

1192
01:13:17,081 --> 01:13:21,190
situation.
I know a baby needs a mom and a dad,

1193
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:25,090
but if you guys don't really love each
other, whether you live in Arizona,

1194
01:13:25,091 --> 01:13:27,760
he live in Illinois,
it's eventually gonna fucking blow up.

1195
01:13:28,580 --> 01:13:29,010
Okay.

1196
01:13:29,010 --> 01:13:31,920
So I would just at this
point you're having a baby.

1197
01:13:31,921 --> 01:13:35,490
So your needs are out the window.
It's gotta be about the kid.

1198
01:13:35,491 --> 01:13:36,600
But you did mention in there,

1199
01:13:36,601 --> 01:13:39,720
so I guess took me a second
to try to figure this one out.

1200
01:13:39,721 --> 01:13:43,740
I guess if I was in your situation I
would do what was best for the baby.

1201
01:13:44,460 --> 01:13:44,960
Okay.

1202
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:48,290
So whatever that answer is, I
would go with that. All right.

1203
01:13:48,950 --> 01:13:53,180
But I don't think that that's
just a, uh, a one sided talk.

1204
01:13:53,181 --> 01:13:55,370
Like you really have to sit down with,
uh,

1205
01:13:56,510 --> 01:14:01,400
with your boyfriend there and try and
together figure out what's best for the

1206
01:14:01,401 --> 01:14:02,234
kid.

1207
01:14:02,490 --> 01:14:02,980
Okay.

1208
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:07,840
And then I would do that. Alrighty. I
hope that helped you out. All right,

1209
01:14:07,841 --> 01:14:11,710
this is a long podcast today. Um, is this
the last? This is the one. All right.

1210
01:14:11,711 --> 01:14:15,310
Hang in there everybody advice
for a big presentation. I bill,

1211
01:14:15,311 --> 01:14:19,060
I saw your special on Netflix and I
left my face off a few days later.

1212
01:14:19,061 --> 01:14:23,740
I started a new job at the sort of place
where my coworkers don't really speak

1213
01:14:23,741 --> 01:14:27,490
to each other during work hours.
You can hear the wiring,

1214
01:14:27,550 --> 01:14:30,880
the gear of the worrying of the fan
overhead and desk drawers being open and

1215
01:14:30,881 --> 01:14:34,060
shut Jesus Christ. So thank Christ
for your podcast. What a relief.

1216
01:14:34,061 --> 01:14:38,860
Thank you for making my day. All right.
I'm presenting at Ted at a Ted x event.

1217
01:14:39,370 --> 01:14:43,300
Is that like ted.com or all those eggheads
talk about robots and scuba diving in

1218
01:14:43,340 --> 01:14:45,730
like a wheelchair.
Um,

1219
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:50,170
and I'm wondering what sort of tips you
might have for speaking to large crowds.

1220
01:14:50,380 --> 01:14:55,180
Try to make them laugh off the top or
save it until I'm further into the speech

1221
01:14:55,181 --> 01:14:55,480
or,

1222
01:14:55,480 --> 01:15:00,400
or what you've poked fun about bringing
a joke full circle at the end of the

1223
01:15:00,401 --> 01:15:01,570
set.
Is that lame?

1224
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:06,900
I do this where whenever I write something
I can't read it once it's published

1225
01:15:07,991 --> 01:15:09,880
because it all sounds so cheesy to me.
Oh,

1226
01:15:09,881 --> 01:15:13,660
if you write it down because you're in
your head. Okay, I see what you mean.

1227
01:15:13,690 --> 01:15:16,360
He says like, I ended up hating
what I just put out there.

1228
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:20,200
I just want to cringe every time
I think about my speech, you know?

1229
01:15:20,201 --> 01:15:24,310
What do you think? Ah, I think you have
the classic mentality of the performer.

1230
01:15:24,790 --> 01:15:26,380
You want to be in front of everybody,

1231
01:15:26,830 --> 01:15:30,460
you have self hatred and you want
the crowd to clap and be like, no,

1232
01:15:30,461 --> 01:15:32,350
but seriously,
you're a good guy.

1233
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:34,793
MMM.

1234
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:37,520
I would say this.
Um,

1235
01:15:39,130 --> 01:15:41,620
just talk to them like you're
talking to your buddies in a bar.

1236
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:46,690
That's what I would do. I would just, if,
if you don't like what you wrote down,

1237
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:51,310
what I would do is I would have talking
points in front of me like I'm starting

1238
01:15:51,311 --> 01:15:54,970
with this point and then talk off the
top of your head. If you're good at this,

1239
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:58,690
by the way, all right. Now this is
one of your first times doing this.

1240
01:15:58,691 --> 01:15:59,680
You're going to be a little nervous.

1241
01:15:59,890 --> 01:16:03,970
It might be good to have
something a little more
prepared, but if you're good at,

1242
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:08,530
you know, talking in front of people, I
would just have bullet points. You know,

1243
01:16:09,220 --> 01:16:11,890
like I'm going to talk about
how I ended up in a wheelchair.

1244
01:16:12,130 --> 01:16:15,550
I'm going to talk about how I used to
love the ocean and then I'm going to talk

1245
01:16:15,551 --> 01:16:17,290
about having all of
that taken away from me.

1246
01:16:17,290 --> 01:16:19,780
And then I'm going to talk about the
apparatus and then I'm in the ocean.

1247
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:22,360
Then I'm going to show him the pictures
and then going to get all teared up.

1248
01:16:22,780 --> 01:16:26,230
And then I'm going to wheel myself
off while with one hand while waving.

1249
01:16:26,980 --> 01:16:30,790
But then I'll be in a circle and then
realize that I'm doing a circular waving

1250
01:16:30,791 --> 01:16:35,770
thing in my chair and then I'll just
sort of back up off the stage. You know,

1251
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:37,750
that's just one example.
But um,

1252
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:41,140
I think you know what the good thing
is your competition isn't that stiff.

1253
01:16:41,141 --> 01:16:45,970
There's going to be a bunch of monotone
jackasses. I'm just sitting there going,

1254
01:16:45,971 --> 01:16:46,500
Bruker,
Naren,

1255
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:51,040
Cary Sherburne duty for fuel
and Yorkton injury or injury.

1256
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:53,140
You're going to, you know, you're
gonna have to go on after that.

1257
01:16:53,141 --> 01:16:56,290
So it might not be that difficult.
So that's basically what I would do.

1258
01:16:56,710 --> 01:17:01,000
All right people, that's the podcasts this
week. Thank you for listening. Please.

1259
01:17:01,001 --> 01:17:01,421
All of you.

1260
01:17:01,421 --> 01:17:04,480
If you're going to buy something on
amazon.com if you'd like to donate to this

1261
01:17:04,481 --> 01:17:08,110
podcast and the wounded warriors project,
please for the love of God,

1262
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:09,590
go to [inaudible].

01:17:09,620 --> 01:17:12,980
click on the podcast page and
then click on the Amazon link.

1264
01:17:13,220 --> 01:17:17,210
It'll take you right to
Amazon. Not Nothing's going
to cost you any more money.

1265
01:17:17,270 --> 01:17:21,230
It's just Amazon kicks me a little bit
of money for sending traffic their way.

1266
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:24,710
And then I take 10% of that and I throw
it to the wounded warriors project.

1267
01:17:25,190 --> 01:17:29,300
And I'm also, if you'd like to download

01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:36,680

1270
01:17:36,681 --> 01:17:39,590

um,

1271
01:17:40,370 --> 01:17:44,060
in both of those are available on
the merchant page. Um, that is it.

1272
01:17:44,090 --> 01:17:47,300
Go fuck yourselves. Have a
wonderful week and I'll, uh,

1273
01:17:47,301 --> 01:17:49,760
I'll talk to you next
Monday. Okay. Buhbye.
