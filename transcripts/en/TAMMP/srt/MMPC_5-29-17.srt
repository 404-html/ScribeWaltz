22
00:01:35,701 --> 00:01:40,290
great men of this country fought so you

23
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:44,820

towards a fucking massive coronary.

24
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,650

27
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:06,820
the classic old fuckin middle aged man
injury that fuckin blown out Achilles you

28
00:02:10,491 --> 00:02:11,324

29
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,900
Oh did you say you wanted pickles you

30
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:19,930

31
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:21,850
the face right.

32
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:27,320
You'd be surprised I bet if I could
somehow get some sort of lives.

33
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:32,480
You know phones in here I bet my phone
lines would be lighting up right now with

34
00:02:32,481 --> 00:02:36,770
paramedics fire department people
people that drive ambulances

35
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:41,330
is the driver of the ambulance do you
actually have to know how to help people

36
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,680
are you just like the guy the getaway
driver you know all you need to do is not

37
00:02:45,681 --> 00:02:49,130
to turn on the siren you
won't be able to block it out.

38
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:53,900
You think ambulance drivers hear that
siren at night it's a late night quiet

39
00:02:53,901 --> 00:02:56,900
bedroom you know trying to put fucking
music on cause they don't they're just

40
00:02:56,901 --> 00:02:57,734
laying there all year

41
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,780
slowly going insane

42
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:10,420
I don't know I'm in a great fuckin
mood you know my lovely little Lay is

43
00:03:12,531 --> 00:03:16,410
starting to sleep through the night I'm
starting to get some sleep again dude

44
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:20,720
she's hilarious she just does this thing
now she's trying out a voice she just

45
00:03:20,721 --> 00:03:25,721
goes guy like it loud as shit laying in
the bed in the morning between me and

46
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:32,570
this just that. It's like fucking
a little mini Jerry Lewis.

47
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:35,240
The entire time it's

48
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,260
so I just put my hand over my mouth I
just I just make it go away I think and

49
00:03:41,261 --> 00:03:45,170
then she kind of like looks around like
What the fuck was that and that stops

50
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,610
for about four seconds before she starts
again and then she gets used to the

51
00:03:48,611 --> 00:03:50,980
noise and then that's it.

52
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:57,190
She started to crawl she's fucking moving
backwards it's funny like that I guess

53
00:03:57,191 --> 00:03:59,390
they move backwards first so it's
like the thing that they want.

54
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:04,230
It just keeps getting further and further
away like that Alfred Hitchcock shot.

55
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:11,130
But anyways I had family from back east
out here this weekend which means plenty

56
00:04:12,551 --> 00:04:14,590
of booze plenty of fucking crazy food.

57
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:19,620
So I've been doing the elliptical every
day doing what I can but you know this

58
00:04:21,101 --> 00:04:25,930
is like at this point everybody is gonna
come out here has come out here they've

59
00:04:25,931 --> 00:04:30,610

60
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:35,980

64
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:47,500
And you just peel off in the back you

65
00:04:47,501 --> 00:04:50,470

66
00:04:50,471 --> 00:04:51,580
boozing in the corner.

67
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:59,840
Happy holidays. Now it's
been great. She's awesome.

68
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,860
She's so awesome I'm not getting
any fucking material out of it

69
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,690
everyone was telling me oh my god you're
having a kid I can't wait for you to

70
00:05:09,691 --> 00:05:10,540
become a dad.

71
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,320
Oh my God I want to see how
your act changes. It hasn't.

72
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,630
I'm still paranoid I'm still filthy
and my daughter is awesome. So.

73
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,280
You know that's not funny.

74
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:27,390
I know it's like being a
dad. It's great. Phenomenal.

75
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:30,810
I think most my material is just
about other fucking lunatic parents.

76
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,230
I'm telling you what I'm going to start
saying to people when they go Oh she's

77
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,540
the Oh yeah that's a great H I'll wait
wait til 3 days from now then all well

78
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:42,840
you've done she's gonna love she'll
and start stabbing you in the night.

79
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,810
I mean you don't start
saying those parents.

80
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,460
I'm just gonna be like you know

81
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:52,200
you sound like a horrible father and
I think you married the wrong person.

82
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,280
Have a nice day.

83
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:02,790
How you could look at this experience
in a negative way is fucking look if

84
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:03,660
you're broke.

85
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:08,310
If you're a kid if you're a fucking high
school student right and you know you

86
00:06:08,311 --> 00:06:13,311
started banging your goddamn English
teacher and yet you didn't know enough to

87
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:18,831
pull out as much as they told you in
sex education how much you know how a

88
00:06:19,941 --> 00:06:23,960
baby's made you couldn't fucking believe
you a bang and your English teacher and

89
00:06:23,961 --> 00:06:27,730
the next thing you know you're going to
be a fart Yeah. Then then it's brutal.

90
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,410
You know if you're married to this fucking
old broad is always correct in your

91
00:06:30,411 --> 00:06:33,400
fucking sentences.
You know.

92
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,780
You're calling around for dressing like
a whore and she's fucking giving you

93
00:06:37,781 --> 00:06:42,160
shit for for a dangling participle
whatever the fuck I never knew what that

94
00:06:42,161 --> 00:06:42,790
meant.

95
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:43,930
The past participle

96
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:48,650
Bell was a past participle
this sentence I don't know.

97
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,600
Just send me to summer school just gimme
gimme in that fuckin distilled version

98
00:06:53,601 --> 00:06:55,100
of this class that is nothing.

99
00:06:55,250 --> 00:07:00,230
That dream team of class clowns that
is summer school drug addicts and

100
00:07:00,231 --> 00:07:03,290
musicians. It was just fucking
tremendous summer school.

101
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:07,490
Underrated I tell you.
I went. I did it twice.

102
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:10,670
I should have done it all four years of
high school but I blew off the last year

103
00:07:10,671 --> 00:07:11,900
because what was the fucking point.

104
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,520
My sophomore year my teacher
hooked me up gave me the D minus

105
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,090
D minus and geometry

106
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:27,420
I fucking had a great time. I had a
great time I tend to take one class.

107
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,800
You don't get me out
of bed in the morning.

108
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:35,460
In summer school was combined like three
towns where I lived and it was a it was

109
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:36,840
all the class clowns.

110
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:42,060
Just like I said creative people everybody
had a D and the level of shit that

111
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:44,730
they gave to the teacher I was
like why I got to up my game.

112
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,890
These people are on a whole nother level.

113
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,440
So when you go to jail you
become like a better criminal.

114
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:54,660
I became a better class clown just sit
there like well these guys are fucking

115
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,860
these guys I have no intention of going
to college Emily still lying to myself I

116
00:08:00,861 --> 00:08:04,970
think I could you know
I think I could go in the later rounds

117
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,930
if you were a fucking draft pick.

118
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,890
Be honest with yourself you were a high
school student What round are you going

119
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:16,920
and do you know and if you really think
about it that's why Bill Belichick he

120
00:08:17,481 --> 00:08:20,300
doesn't like the first round draft picks
because the first round draft picks

121
00:08:20,301 --> 00:08:24,270
they like book smart right there the
fucking nerds you know you give him some

122
00:08:24,271 --> 00:08:28,740
information they'll memorize it and spit
it right back at you right there's no

123
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:29,574
passion

124
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:35,630
they they they they don't walk into a
room and light it up is a bad analogy

125
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:38,600
because first round draft
picks do I guess do they

126
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:43,760
I don't know about college basketball
now with everybody one and done

127
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:48,970
you bring this fucking kid to a locker
room full of men and put the team on his

128
00:08:48,971 --> 00:08:51,490
back bony fucking legs

129
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:58,010
Well Bill what are they supposed to do
a lot of them you know it's like their

130
00:08:58,011 --> 00:09:02,990
mothers you know they they need a new
kidney and the shack they live in is

131
00:09:02,991 --> 00:09:03,590
falling the bucket.

132
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:05,810
Fair enough.
Fair enough.

133
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,790
But selfishly as a fan you know you miss
the days when somebody had four years

134
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:13,910
with fucking Coach K or
Dean Smith rest his soul.

135
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:18,430
Bobby Knight flip it I mean the chant
stopped looking down fucking there.

136
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:25,130
David I've told them before they it much
I fucking love that Bobby Knight speech

137
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,770
where he says you know I'm
not going to you're not going.

138
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:30,080
I'm not gonna walk around with a 40 to 20.

139
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,570
I don't know what it is about that guy.

140
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,690
Listen to that speech and
it makes me want to go fuck.

141
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,680
I don't know if I'll go to the
gym after listening to that guy.

142
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:47,240
Something happened you know when
that guy got ran out of town.

143
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:50,180
That was that was it. You
know. Then all of a sudden like

144
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:56,220
guys stared into just literally being
pussies like fuck and wearing shirts with

145
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:57,420
cats on him and stuff.

146
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:00,163
You know.

147
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:04,870
My wife was showing me that look there's
a men's onesie that's out there now

148
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:07,420
that guy's aware and I was like
You've gotta be fucking kidding.

149
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:10,960
Like when is it going to stop. When is
it going to steer back to testosterone.

150
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,900
When is the guys guy
going to make a comeback.

151
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:16,490
I mean everything makes a comeback right.

152
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:21,620
Classic rock disco hair metals
make it a little bit of a comeback.

153
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:25,200
I don't fucking know.
I just don't get it.

154
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:30,270
And in some ways show me what they were
like Sean Connery wore one in one of the

155
00:10:30,621 --> 00:10:33,970
James Bond movies and it's like all right.

156
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:36,770
But he wasn't wearing it like
he thought it looked good.

157
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,350
He wasn't wearing it because
it was fucking stupid.

158
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:46,470
You know that's what
I can't fucking stand.

159
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,820
Everything's like Mark and
something else it's like all right.

160
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,200
So what do you believe in.

161
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:56,580
What are you gonna fuck him sign your name
to and these fucking millennial cunts.

162
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,300
Oh I can't say all of them.
That's not fair to a whole generation.

163
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:05,330
But so the ones that at least have taken
pictures of OK which granted most of

164
00:11:05,801 --> 00:11:10,801
these pictures are being taken care taken
by older people from my generation who

165
00:11:10,811 --> 00:11:13,220
are jealous of younger people.
That's what a lot of it is.

166
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:17,170
I bet I bet I'm overreacting
when I really think about it.

167
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,200
I don't really see a lot of
people with cats. On their shirts.

168
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:24,440
Although when they do people take pictures
of them then they post them on social

169
00:11:24,441 --> 00:11:28,490
media and then old fucks like me start
going Oh look these fucking millennials

170
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:32,380
they're fucking.
It's a scratch all of it.

171
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:36,410
I mean really Bill.
Have you seen anybody with a onesie.

172
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:39,920
Some we just showed you a picture and
then you literally started freaking out

173
00:11:39,921 --> 00:11:43,400
like you watch CNN or
Fox News for two hours.

174
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,390
That's always a great thing to do watch
those for a couple two three hours and

175
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:51,920
they get you all panicked what you want
to do is you want to switch between the

176
00:11:51,921 --> 00:11:52,670
two of them right.

177
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,610
And then you balance out the lies
and you keep yourself level headed.

178
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,520
You know fake news tell fake news.

179
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,920
So anyways I want to be like
that I want to be that guy okay.

180
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:07,400
God bless you millennials. I'm sure this
there's plenty of guys guys on the way.

181
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:10,340
You're out there fucking crush an ass.
God bless you.

182
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:15,430
Join your youth Joy your fucking youth
before it's Memorial Day and suddenly

183
00:12:16,381 --> 00:12:20,040
you're that guy with the dad bod standing
in front of the grill filling that

184
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:25,041
tightness in your Achilles you know you've
got to reach for that last burger in

185
00:12:25,341 --> 00:12:26,890
the back of the fuckin grill.

186
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,150
You just start feeling that
tightness in your ankle you like.

187
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,530
If it's going to happen please
don't let it happen now.

188
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,480
Not in front of my family back east.

189
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:42,870
Nobody has guessed the movie by
the way that I am referring to.

190
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,150
We had problems with the family back east.

191
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:52,660
This I was gonna say I'd give you a
hint but this isn't really hard in my

192
00:12:52,661 --> 00:12:56,200
opinion that movie.
It's a car movie

193
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:58,840
for me.

194
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,970
I just feel like that
movie is a car movie.

195
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,180
Other people thought there was
some philosophical question

196
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:09,810
you know who's to fly
who's the windshield.

197
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,920
All I remember from that
movie was I loved the car.

198
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,450
Because I love a fuckin sleek

199
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:24,370
I remember the car that was a sleeper
and then I just remembered that there was

200
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:25,300
this one guy.

201
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:31,290
Was having problems with the family
back east and that explained his entire

202
00:13:31,361 --> 00:13:36,150
fucking backstory
that's it now.

203
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,510
If you guys can't guess it now I
don't know what the fuck. I don't.

204
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:42,020
I don't know what to tell you.
All right they had a fuckin pizza.

205
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:50,760
Yeah. Can I get a guy get a sausage
in a rubella. We got an old rule.

206
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:55,440
You know me Rubio. Yeah. We had family
we planned up the family back east.

207
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:56,450
It will give us a Ruger

208
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:03,700
anyway. So what you guys do this weekend
other sit around. You know what I did.

209
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:08,720
I watched somebody tweeted me on the
old Twitter and told me are you watching

210
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:13,620
the time trials for Monaco. And here's
the thing. I know I'm new to F1.

211
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:18,060
She goes No I can barely
remember the fucking names.

212
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,220
So I'm like I'm I'm gonna like it.

213
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,980
I had no idea like how
they qualify for a race.

214
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:32,080
I just thought you know you get like five
laps around the track whoever has the

215
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:35,510
best time gets the pole position and
then they just work their way back.

216
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,490
But that that that is not how it works.

217
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:41,920
It's like a whole other day of racing
because I was one like Why the fuck did

218
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:45,350
people show up to watch
these these qualifying

219
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:50,670
Remy. Just watch some guy
by himself out there. Yeah.

220
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:56,100
Yeah he is gonna be in
eighth place tomorrow.

221
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,470
That's not how it works.

222
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:03,060
It is the race before the race and it's
like there's three race so there's three

223
00:15:03,061 --> 00:15:06,180
levels of the qualifying. There's
like first of all this practice laps.

224
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:11,370
Get used to the track and if you don't
do the practice laps you're not allowed

225
00:15:11,371 --> 00:15:14,070
to race so obviously it's probably some
safety thing like Dude you're not just

226
00:15:14,071 --> 00:15:16,650
gonna fucking go out there and
start driving 20 miles an hour.

227
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,130
It's this next one a
right or a left turn share

228
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:24,630
qualifying OK.

229
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:28,680
So there's just like three rounds of it.
So qualifying the first round one.

230
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:33,770
It's like March Madness but with
cars it lasts for 18 minutes.

231
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,040
Everybody gets on the fucking track.

232
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:40,900
I'm sure they don't turn up they let six
out and another six I how fast they do

233
00:15:40,901 --> 00:15:45,901
it I miss that part of it OK but it
lasts for 18 minutes at the end of which

234
00:15:46,401 --> 00:15:51,020
time. Can you tell I'm reading this the
sixth slowest drivers are eliminated from

235
00:15:51,021 --> 00:15:56,021
qualifying and 16 advance
to q t the qualifying 2 so
those six are gonna be that

236
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:02,820
then I thought oh my be out of the fuckin
race is this like golf or you missed

237
00:16:02,821 --> 00:16:03,654
the cut.

238
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,830
And I found out later No they
just start way in the back.

239
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,550
OK so

240
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:17,900
so there's 22 fucking drivers I guess
so let's see so six of them are fucking

241
00:16:17,901 --> 00:16:22,901
eliminated but I think usually 20 drivers
to to not have to go home I have no

242
00:16:23,121 --> 00:16:25,970
idea if anybody knows the information
to that I don't know if anybody if you

243
00:16:25,971 --> 00:16:29,840
don't move to the next round of qualifying
if anybody actually doesn't get to

244
00:16:29,841 --> 00:16:34,700
race because I thought there was 20 cars
in the race and according to this mass

245
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,160
there's twenty two or whatever so six
or eliminated in the first one then the

246
00:16:38,161 --> 00:16:43,161
next sixteen you know after a short
break the times are reset and the sixteen

247
00:16:43,311 --> 00:16:47,700
remaining cars run in a 15 minute session.
So now we're down to 15.

248
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:52,310
And at the end of which the slowest
six cars are eliminated from qualifying

249
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:56,840
leaving tend to progress
to qualifying three.

250
00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:01,870
Now the top ten spots after the race those
that that's when you're in the points

251
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:08,790
from first all the way to 10th it's like
some like twenty five points for first

252
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:13,840
18 for second then it's like
15 then 12 10 8 6 4 2 1.

253
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,930
Are the points

254
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:20,590
you're in the you're in the fucking
lightning round at that point.

255
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:28,390
And then whoever you are obviously
has the best run after that gets the.

256
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,360
Qualifying three after a further break.

257
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:35,470
Times are reset in the final 12 minutes
session is held to decide pole position

258
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:38,110
and the standing order of
the top 10 grid places.

259
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,930
That's when you're in
the points all right.

260
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,320
That's when you're going home with least
with the fucking year supply of rice a

261
00:17:44,321 --> 00:17:46,720
roni. If you're in the top 10. So

262
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,700
I watched it because somebody on Twitter
is like Dude you gotta watch this.

263
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,660
This might be better than the race.
So Lewis Hamilton.

264
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,070
From the Isle of Man.

265
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:01,380
It's an island with men nothing but men.

266
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:07,330
All walking around like right
where the Falcon lays the birds.

267
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,480
Whatever the fuck they
call them over the flags.

268
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:16,773
Anyways.

269
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:20,830
He's out there he's got Mercedes he's
got one of the fastest fuckin cars out

270
00:18:20,831 --> 00:18:24,430
there but for whatever fucking reason
he's not getting enough downward force or

271
00:18:24,431 --> 00:18:27,220
something on the front of his car
in the front end is sliding all over

272
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,840
everywhere so he barely gets
out of qualifying when he
gets into qualifying too.

273
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:38,400
And it's there's a 50 minute session
and he's outside of qualifying to get to

274
00:18:39,101 --> 00:18:40,000
the next level.

275
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:44,140
His time is too slow so he's
got time to do one more run.

276
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:49,030
OK now he's in second
place overall for the

277
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:53,660
for the to become champ to stand.

278
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:57,890
To stay on pace to be whatever the fuck
and best drive with you. I'm sorry guys.

279
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,820
I'm new to this fucking thing

280
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:04,190
and his fucking front and starts sliding
all over the place and then some cunt

281
00:19:04,191 --> 00:19:05,240
hits the wall.

282
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:09,580
So then the yellow flag comes out and
I guess that doesn't matter if some

283
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:11,950
asshole drives into the fucking wall.

284
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:15,480
You're qualifying time has
done this fucking idiot

285
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,660
he's a professional driver.

286
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:21,850
He hits the wall and he hit the wall.
I get it.

287
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:25,890
You know they said they actually
put some special staring at.

288
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:28,950
They make custom steering just for that
fuckin track in Monaco because they're

289
00:19:28,951 --> 00:19:31,380
just driving through the streets and
they have such a hairpin turn that they

290
00:19:31,381 --> 00:19:33,960
actually have to turn the wheel
harder than they do at any other race.

291
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:39,390
You know why when they just leave that in
when you want to have that option.

292
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:43,020
Case she had to drive all the way around
something at some point in the other

293
00:19:43,021 --> 00:19:44,160
races.
Evidently not.

294
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:50,280
So anyways long story short this fucking
guy I think from Force India with the

295
00:19:50,281 --> 00:19:54,870
future car just basically you know he
pulls the Greg babe Brady you know gotta

296
00:19:54,871 --> 00:19:57,870
beat Marsha getting a call closer than
a quarter of an inch he fuckin slams

297
00:19:57,871 --> 00:19:59,850
right into the wall and then that's it.

298
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,930
And Lewis Hamilton was so fucking dejected
he couldn't even get out of his car.

299
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:10,190
You know and long story short the
fucking Ferrari's a fucked is my god damn

300
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:13,644
computer.

301
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,730
Keep doing this to me

302
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,690
trying to get the screen to
come up can you stay up dog.

303
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,850
I sit there fingering the
fuckin thing the whole time.

304
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:28,420
Yeah so long story short the Ferrari's
won the first and second position.

305
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:34,460
And I think that Brutus guy the
finished dude started in third and Lewis

306
00:20:35,581 --> 00:20:40,581
Hamilton was all the way back in 14th
so he's out of the points and you're

307
00:20:41,671 --> 00:20:45,360
driving through the fucking streets
of Monaco a sovereign state.

308
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:48,740
In other words they're in France but
they're not part of France like you have

309
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:52,710
fuck off.
We're doing our own thing here and

310
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:58,970
I guess it's really hard to pass there.
But despite that the fuckin race starts.

311
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:00,630
Immediately.

312
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:04,140
He went from 14th to 12th and I'm
watching the race and I'm like This

313
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:06,640
motherfucker.
He's probably going to finish fourth.

314
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,740
He's somehow gonna figure some
he's gonna fuck up in the Pit Stop.

315
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,100
Something's gonna happen so I'm watching
the whole time I'm watching the race

316
00:21:14,101 --> 00:21:18,120
and I'm watching and he's 12 and he's
11th then he's 10th and the fucking

317
00:21:18,121 --> 00:21:21,120
announcers are blowing it off because
they're too busy looking at that what the

318
00:21:21,121 --> 00:21:22,410
Ferrari's are gonna do.

319
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:26,880
What the Red Bull teams doing what the
fuck are boo tasks he's gonna be doing in

320
00:21:26,881 --> 00:21:30,760
the Mercedes and meanwhile he's Lewis
Hamilton just moving at this is the

321
00:21:30,761 --> 00:21:33,780
longest ever talked about race and it's
got to feel people like dude I don't

322
00:21:33,781 --> 00:21:36,510
give a fuck you driving
around in a circle.

323
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:43,670
No they're not then I try and run there's
left and right turns all right there's

324
00:21:43,881 --> 00:21:44,714
a chicane.

325
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:51,020
Dude you least gotta watch Monaco you
shouldn't watch Monaco with the fucking

326
00:21:51,021 --> 00:21:54,800
Illuminati people fucking back their
yachts up although I went online and I

327
00:21:54,801 --> 00:21:58,820
found like you can actually there's a
lot of them were just like packages like

328
00:21:58,821 --> 00:22:01,760
those aren't just rich people with their
yards backed up there's just a lot of

329
00:22:01,761 --> 00:22:05,840
like booze cruises and you can sit
there on a fucking yard getting hammered

330
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:11,190
acting like you didn't just light up
your fucking credit card whatever Stacey

331
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:14,650
will deal with it when we
get back we get baggage.

332
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:20,560
So long story short on a track that you
could not fuckin pass on somehow Lewis

333
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:26,050
passed seven fucking people
finished seventh so let's
see that's 1 2 he got like

334
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:31,150
6 points or something like that and
the Ferrari's came in first and second.

335
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:37,470
All right Sebastian Vettel ended up
winning after a great fuckin pit stop and

336
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:41,660
what's his face.
Kimi Raikkonen is at his fucking name.

337
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,360
Raking in or whatever finish
dude Sebastian's the crowd.

338
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:50,080
The German dude he fucking comes out of
the pit before he hit Kimi going like

339
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:51,363
What the fuck.

340
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:56,540
He said to like make somebody cut me
off in traffic but he's driving like 170

341
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:57,483
miles an hour.

342
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:03,130
What's his face. Daniel always a
bridesmaid never a fucking winner.

343
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:07,060
Ricardo came in fucking third the guy's
always on the podium never comes in

344
00:23:07,061 --> 00:23:10,330
first he's gotta be pissed
like guys what the fuck

345
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,160
can you do somebody the car here so I
can get past these Ferraris and Mercedes

346
00:23:15,161 --> 00:23:16,810
and I want oil and I got a deal here.

347
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:22,900
So long story short Ferrari is a team has
one hundred ninety six points Mercedes

348
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:26,740
has one hundred seventy nine and the
Americans the Yanks just to let you know

349
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:29,800
we're pulling up the rear.
We got our first points of the season

350
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:36,100
what do we got we got Romain like the
lettuce grass Gene he got nine points and

351
00:23:36,101 --> 00:23:41,101
then Kevin Magnussen like the condoms got
five so we got 14 points so just those

352
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:46,000
Ferrari's Mercedes better mind their
fuckin p's and q's because the Yanks are

353
00:23:46,001 --> 00:23:49,070
coming. All right thank you for fuckin
sitting through all of that shit.

354
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:56,050
Let's talk about Tiger Woods.
Jesus fucking Christ

355
00:23:57,790 --> 00:24:00,180
can you believe he got arrested
for drinking and driving.

356
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:03,550
It only happens to nine zillion
people every fucking day.

357
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:08,200
I'm so sick of people talking about
Tiger Woods like the way they disrespect

358
00:24:08,201 --> 00:24:09,034
this guy.

359
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:14,440
You know I love Stephen A Smith but I
started watching him talking and he was

360
00:24:14,441 --> 00:24:19,441
saying that you know that you know this
guy's just his fall from basically his

361
00:24:20,271 --> 00:24:21,560
fall from grace.

362
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:23,993
And

363
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:29,690
now his whole you know he
became a billionaire and
his whole fucking thing was

364
00:24:29,691 --> 00:24:32,640
based on the fact that he
presented himself as a family man.

365
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,610
And I'm thinking like when.

366
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:37,460
When the fuck did he ever
present himself as a family man.

367
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:44,690
Did he get to where the fuck he was
because he was the best golfer anybody had

368
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:45,524
ever seen

369
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:51,950
because he was making like PGA fucking
links look like like he was playing

370
00:24:51,951 --> 00:24:52,970
miniature golf.

371
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:58,440
I never pay attention to
that fucking Blondie was Why
don't you do a fucking name

372
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:01,500
that area.

373
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,150
So he bangs a bunch of Hooters whores and
then I'm spot then I'm supposed to sit

374
00:25:05,151 --> 00:25:08,300
on the couch go on.
He lied to me Tiger.

375
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:14,810
I thought after you golf you fucking
went down to Applebee's with your family

376
00:25:14,811 --> 00:25:18,560
and fucking your family back east and
you shared a fucking bloomin onion.

377
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:24,460
I have to be honest with you I never
once thought about what the fuck that guy

378
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:29,650
did when he got off the golf course and
when I found out what he was doing off

379
00:25:29,931 --> 00:25:34,700
the golf course I was like Yeah
I mean that kind of makes sense

380
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:41,060
I am to say it's the amount of fuckin
men okay when Stephen A Smith walks out.

381
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:47,730
Of his studio you know he doesn't have
a line of whores just waiting to fucking

382
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:51,670
blow him just so they can
say I blew Stephen A Smith.

383
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,800
Tiger Woods had to deal with that.

384
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:58,480
And like most men he
folded under the pressure.

385
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:02,710
And the fucking reason why.

386
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:08,410
He's not doing well right now it's not
because of his fucking wife who by the

387
00:26:08,411 --> 00:26:13,411
way took a bunch of his money bought a
house fuck and knocked it down and then

388
00:26:13,751 --> 00:26:16,840
rebuilt another one.
What about her.

389
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:17,940
I thought she was

390
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:22,873
right.

391
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:26,200
What about her.
What about all Blondie right there.

392
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:29,920
I still a bit about this do you think
she would even give Tiger Woods a second

393
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:34,921
fucking glance if he wasn't making all
that money if he wasn't the greatest at

394
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,220
what he did.

395
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:41,200
Would all blond blue eyed even give that
guy a fuckin second I don't think she

396
00:26:41,201 --> 00:26:42,034
would have.

397
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,113
All right.

398
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:49,640
Even when you're a bum like me when you
fucking walked in the singles bar back

399
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:53,670
in the 90s what did women
always say what do you do.

400
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,440
They're not making small talk.

401
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:01,870
Okay women all fucking judge okay.

402
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,960
Their status. And then they get a
number in their head. All right.

403
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:12,830
And then they find out the jobs
okay that earn this and earn that.

404
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:15,550
And then they figure it like
who they can fuck. Okay.

405
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:20,800
And then it becomes a thing of like OK
you're underneath what I want for the

406
00:27:21,321 --> 00:27:22,154
lifestyle.

407
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:26,470
That I'm looking for in the future but
you're a good looking enough guy that

408
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:30,050
I'll fuckin bang it tonight.
Maybe I'll have a little fling with you.

409
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:31,760
But that's going the
end of the fucking day.

410
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:36,320
You know when you slid that piece of
paper across the table and you made your

411
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:41,321
offer say my dick and balls bring
home this each year they're like Yeah.

412
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,030
Keep it moving keep it moving.

413
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:47,560
That's that's ten grand less than I want.
And you got that one snagged too.

414
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:52,430
Fuck off. Move on. Who's next. Gad put
your junk on the table what's your number.

415
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,670
And he has it any is a thing.
I don't fault women for that.

416
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:06,470
Who wants to live like a bum. If you're
good and if you're good looking enough.

417
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:11,030
OK. And you can land somebody
that's making a ton of fuckin money.

418
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:16,910
You can learn to love that right.
I don't know.

419
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:21,170
So anyways now he gets busted for drinking
and driving. This is the bottom line.

420
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,280
This fucking guy's fall from grace.
OK.

421
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:28,900
All right I'll give you the first fucking
couple of years after his divorce.

422
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:31,900
Like maybe that got in his fucking head
but at the end I mean you can't get

423
00:28:31,901 --> 00:28:33,300
divorced ten fucking years ago.

424
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:40,480
What happened was was his marriage and
his body broke down at the same fucking

425
00:28:40,481 --> 00:28:43,540
time. But I just had major back
surgeries knees of fucked up.

426
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:48,960
And they always said they said back
when everybody thought he was the family

427
00:28:48,961 --> 00:28:53,961
band back east that the way that the level
of talk and the pressure that was put

428
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:57,810
on his back. They predicted his body
was gonna break down and it did.

429
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,120
And then when it does you know now
they're going to blame you know

430
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:05,620
it's the classic ladies just
taking credit. That's all it is.

431
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,280
They always take it behind
every great man is a good woman.

432
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:12,820
You know they're okay.
All right is it I don't.

433
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:17,200
I mean what's your definition of great
I mean

434
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:21,550
but every great man is a great woman.

435
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:23,630
It's like the guy was already
a fucking champion when he met.

436
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:27,300
So if you're talking about
his mother I'll give you that.

437
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:30,060
But this whole fucking thing or now.
I mean Jesus I can tell you his mug shot.

438
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,013
That's a classic one.

439
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:34,650
I'd like to have a couple
of pops of Tiger back

440
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:37,380
alley.

441
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:41,160
Yeah.
He needs this is what he needs to do.

442
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:44,730
He needs to hit the fuckin
treadmill all right.

443
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:49,380
And he's got to shave his fucking
head already. You gotta let that go.

444
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:54,170
Oh God. He comes to Monday morning
it comes to him. Photoshop.

445
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:57,370
Can you please photoshop
my fucking head underneath.

446
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,330
Tiger Woods is mug an air.

447
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:08,100
God you know it's funny is he
looks like he's fuckin wasted.

448
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:10,540
But you know what he's saying
he's looking into the camera.

449
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:13,260
Gone well I know a billion
people are going to see this.

450
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:16,160
What the fuck are they
going to say about this one.

451
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:21,590
I don't I can't even
begin to tell you guys.

452
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:24,930
I. I can't. Are you kidding.

453
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,810
Begins I guess how bad I want to
see this guy win a major again.

454
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,360
Look at this. Editors Pick the secret
history of Tiger Woods. Now how.

455
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:37,840
How much do you think they
actually talk to Tiger Woods

456
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:43,660
so the death of his father set a battle
raging inside the world's greatest

457
00:30:43,661 --> 00:30:44,494
golfer.

458
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:48,970
Dish dish.
How the fuck do you know why.

459
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,140
Because you talked to his gardener said
the closest you could get to him an egg

460
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:54,010
and write 400 pages of bullshit.

461
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:58,870
Listen do me a favor don't listen
any of this stuff okay. He's a man.

462
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:03,190
He makes mistakes. He's in the public
eye. I hope his back gets better.

463
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:03,610
You know what.

464
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:07,580
I hope he goes out like fucking who's
that guy used to fucking to sit there.

465
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:12,800
The big deal that put the blonde
hair and he's fucking sit there.

466
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:15,350
I think you played Oliver on the
Brady Bunch way back in the day.

467
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:17,110
Then when he grew up he became this drunk.

468
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,470
He was this alcoholic fuckin he
he hit the ball a fuckin mile.

469
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:24,730
God damn it it's gonna kill
me I gotta look this up here

470
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:29,610
alcoholic golfer.

471
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:33,083
Driver

472
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:39,530
long and so I search and
John Daly there we go.

473
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,200
Bam. Nailed it. John.

474
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:50,650
You know I hope it comes
back like a combination. Like

475
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:56,230
I don't know a Terminator and John Daly.
That's what I want.

476
00:31:56,950 --> 00:32:00,990
I want a fuckin drunk cyborg going out
there and I hope he fuckin passes Jack

477
00:32:00,991 --> 00:32:01,824
Nicholas.

478
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:06,880
And just you know I don't understand
people that look at people in the public

479
00:32:06,881 --> 00:32:09,230
eye to the point that
they they disappoint them.

480
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:15,490
You know get a fucking life
Jesus Christ.

481
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:16,890
What was a fuckin movie.

482
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:21,520
Captain Kirk when he did he did the
sketch talking to the Trekkies on SNL.

483
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:22,660
Get a fucking life.

484
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,540
You know guys.
I don't know.

485
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:30,890
I don't if you notice the last couple of
weeks I've been a little and I've been

486
00:32:30,891 --> 00:32:35,891
a little down you know and I know the
podcast hasn't been as good as it has been

487
00:32:36,171 --> 00:32:37,490
in the past and it's just because

488
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:41,690
you know I feel like
Tiger Woods let me down.

489
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:46,410
You know all those times I've never
met him or even remotely spoken to him.

490
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:53,300
You know I just really thought we had
something there and for him to turn around

491
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:57,450
and go back on his word that he never
gave me because I've never spoken with

492
00:32:57,451 --> 00:32:59,390
them that just I was devastated and.

493
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,420
I'm not going to be able
to come into work today.

494
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,290
Man I hope that guy wins
another fucking Major.

495
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:12,020
I can't even tell you I
can't I can't even fucking.

496
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:14,840
I just didn't tell you didn't they.
I think I just did tell you

497
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:19,760
last week I was talking
about helicopters and

498
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:25,530
you know I know some pilots listen to
this fucking thing you know mass pumping

499
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:29,550
all that shit you have to deal with
low g pushover with a fuckin semi

500
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:33,450
articulated rotor system does anybody
know about these fucking these these new

501
00:33:33,451 --> 00:33:36,930
European helicopters that are starting
to be available over here and he has a

502
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:40,620
fully articulated rotor system set up
to deal with any of that shit and a fuel

503
00:33:40,621 --> 00:33:43,000
injected so there's no do
I need to pull carb heat.

504
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:44,190
Am I going to fucking die here.

505
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:51,020
I don't know to say gee you
I MBA l gamble Aubrey G to.

506
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:55,550
And I wrote next to it what's the deal.

507
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,970
I talked to two of my instructors one
of them said hey that's pretty cool that

508
00:34:00,971 --> 00:34:01,420
they do that.

509
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:04,570
The other one said Well it's kind of
like remember when the first iPhone came

510
00:34:04,571 --> 00:34:07,360
out because they're brand new.
Then they had to work all the bugs out.

511
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:11,920
He said they learned about
aircraft through people crashing.

512
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,020
That's right. Fuck those things. Then

513
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,270
anyways you know.
You know I was thinking.

514
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:22,330
I think one of these days when I would
do it I'm just gonna buy a used Apache

515
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:27,800
you know or whatever the fuck they have
those black hawks is some shit I'm just

516
00:34:27,801 --> 00:34:30,770
gonna learn how to fly that and then
I'm just going to join those Blackwater

517
00:34:30,771 --> 00:34:34,420
dudes. That's my apocalypse
thing. You know what I mean.

518
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:36,300
I'm not gonna learn how to kill people.

519
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:38,040
I think like that I'll
just be the shuttle guy.

520
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:42,450
I'll take you back from the frontlines
back to base base camp and I'll just sit

521
00:34:42,451 --> 00:34:44,490
there eat my soup.
That's my game plan.

522
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:48,210
All right let's read some of the fucking
advertising here for this week which of

523
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:52,290
course I didn't even did even look
this shit up yet. No I didn't.

524
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:56,970
I apologize for this. You know I just
it's just Tiger Woods let me down.

525
00:34:57,030 --> 00:35:01,980
You know I thought he was a family member
and I mean I haven't been this fucking

526
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:07,260
I haven't been this fucking distraught.

527
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:13,920
Since Michael Jordan's acceptance speech
at the Hall of Fame when I found out

528
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:20,950
who he really was I mean I was devastated
and I just remember all those times I

529
00:35:20,951 --> 00:35:23,200
had not hung out with Michael
Jordan or ever talked to him.

530
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:25,090
I just feel like he really just

531
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,500
you know I just thought
he was better than that.

532
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:33,090
I love that when he gave that speech
and everyone's like wait a minute this

533
00:35:33,091 --> 00:35:37,170
guy's like fucking got ice water in his
veins and he's he's got a mean streak in

534
00:35:37,171 --> 00:35:37,410
him.

535
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:39,330
It's like yeah yeah

536
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,890

had never picked a gym class.

00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:45,600
They were like Oh this is why I sucked.

538
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:50,550
It wasn't just that I was uncoordinated

539
00:35:50,551 --> 00:35:51,384
instinct.

540
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:56,380

You got a bunch of colorful underwear

564
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:40,310
You get did a little algorithm well more

more underwear than straight guys do

568
00:37:51,771 --> 00:37:55,380
you know because women are so fucking
forgiving. Right but guys it's so visual.

569
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:59,850
So maybe gay guys are like I just feel a
pressure that I always have to have new

570
00:37:59,851 --> 00:38:04,851
underwear on because I just feel so I
just feel like for me when somebody sees

571
00:38:05,821 --> 00:38:06,654

from MVP sports that read from way

632
00:41:59,211 --> 00:42:02,480
back in the day when they didn't want
to hire somebody professional they just

633
00:42:02,481 --> 00:42:05,540
hired some fucking hot chick that the
owner was probably bang and like Tiger

634
00:42:05,541 --> 00:42:08,330
Woods but he hasn't won a golf
tournament so nobody knows right.

635
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:14,260
Anyway you no longer have to schlep to
the store buy a cheap disposable fucking

636
00:42:14,541 --> 00:42:15,374
razor.

That gives you a choice. OK. Buy educate.

638
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:23,560
What you no longer have to schlep to the
store to buy a cheap disposable razor

639
00:42:23,561 --> 00:42:28,030
that gave you a cheap shave or spend a
fortune on razors with gimmickry shaving

giving you a smooth shave.

644
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:51,600
For a more precise shave helps prevent
ingrown hairs and fights razor bumps make

645
00:42:52,151 --> 00:42:54,820
the smarter choice by
joining Dollar Shave Club.

646
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:58,810

Club at a custom Doctor Carville's easy

647
00:42:58,811 --> 00:43:00,580

convince me to take the thing.

652
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:20,120
It's another thing I gotta put up on
the wall. Someday explain to people.

653
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:25,770
Oh I have mild dyslexia and I thought Dr.
Carver's Shea butter said Dr. Carver's

654
00:43:26,091 --> 00:43:27,830
easy shaped butter and
I used to scream it.

00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:18,900
LET'S READ THESE FUCKING let's read
these fucking questions here. All right.

668
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,510
Europe Hi.

669
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:26,280
That's it. I like it short and sweet.
Been a huge fan of Bill for many years.

670
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:29,590
Are there any plans for a touring
Europe specifically the Netherlands.

671
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:31,750
Would love to see him perform live.

672
00:44:32,530 --> 00:44:36,460
Well I was there last year man if you
were a fan for many years you should have

673
00:44:36,461 --> 00:44:40,990
checked my Web site. I think I'm
going to go to Europe next year.

674
00:44:42,310 --> 00:44:43,990
And I'll probably build it around

675
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:49,010
a couple of F1 races possibly I don't
know what I'm going to go over there but

676
00:44:49,011 --> 00:44:50,540
I'm definitely due to do a run

677
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:56,010
I've got a bunch of new shit but you know
I have to make sure it's at a certain

678
00:44:56,011 --> 00:44:59,220
level before I go over there because
Europe loves to just have critics show up

679
00:44:59,221 --> 00:45:03,900
at shows without you know the artists
saying hey can you review this show you

680
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:08,880
know and they review it anyway and they
take out their fucking goddamn steak

681
00:45:08,881 --> 00:45:10,740
knives and they cover
up every fucking time.

682
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,410
So I always make sure I'm on my game here.

683
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:17,790
All right girl who stabbed boyfriend
isn't walking free. OK here we go.

684
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:22,200
This is the new this is new part of the
podcast everybody fucking correct and

685
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:24,280
old Bill you know.

686
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:30,700
That's why I made sure to fucking look
up all my my F1 shit you know cause you

687
00:45:30,921 --> 00:45:35,921
goddamn cunt girl who stabbed boyfriend
I have a prediction about the Red Sox

688
00:45:36,441 --> 00:45:39,380
too by the way which I will get to
later on hopefully if I remember.

689
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:44,390
All right that's a teaser and I might
let you down I might disappoint you like

690
00:45:44,391 --> 00:45:48,680
Michael Jordan like fucking Tiger Woods
you know all that entertainment that

691
00:45:48,681 --> 00:45:51,850
they gave you when they watch when you
get to watch them doing things that have

692
00:45:51,851 --> 00:45:52,850
never been done before.

693
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,960
All right girl who stabbed
boyfriend isn't walking free.

694
00:45:57,050 --> 00:46:01,040
Okay so this story was about
some lady at Oxford two fucking.

695
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:04,280
I don't know what the hell she did she
stabbed her boyfriend in the leg with a

696
00:46:04,281 --> 00:46:06,560
bread knife and blah blah blah blah blah.

697
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:11,490
And I think I was like Well
I know you have. You know

698
00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:16,830
you have all this fucking you know
potential and all this type of shit.

699
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,420
So this person.

700
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:23,060
This person is writing back saying
she is going through what's.

701
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:27,210
I realize you like to make the excuse
that we shouldn't expect you to do any

702
00:46:27,211 --> 00:46:30,840
actual research on stories you
talk about and that's fine.

703
00:46:31,350 --> 00:46:33,250
Well then you should leave it at that sir.

704
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:38,970
But in this particular story you ranted
on Thursday's part. I didn't rant.

705
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:42,440
I'm joking around.
You're fucking overreacting cunts.

706
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:45,270
Do you guys understand what a rant is.

707
00:46:46,190 --> 00:46:50,040
Read to me is short for ranting and raving
so you've got a borderline have froth

708
00:46:50,041 --> 00:46:51,450
coming out of your fucking mouth.

709
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:55,620
Joking around about a subject for five
minutes is not a fucking rant is stupid

710
00:46:55,621 --> 00:46:56,454
fuck.

711
00:46:57,870 --> 00:46:58,840
God damn it.

712
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:01,880
All right.
So even like right there.

713
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:06,390
To me that's just I just fucking
fucking wigged out for a second there.

714
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,200
But a ray rant.
Ok.

715
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:14,790
On Thursday you didn't even you didn't
even need to do research to see how wrong

716
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:15,660
you were again.

717
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:17,580
I'm not wrong.
I'm being funny.

718
00:47:17,770 --> 00:47:22,620
Fuck that Oxford girl isn't getting
off free because she's white.

719
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:23,753
Oh my God.

720
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:29,660
As the lovely Nia proposed and not
because she's a woman as the freckled BA

721
00:47:29,661 --> 00:47:33,060
literate bird suggested she
isn't getting off at all in fact.

722
00:47:33,890 --> 00:47:37,320
It's said right in the article you reading
that she was going to be sentenced in

723
00:47:37,321 --> 00:47:40,290
September and has been
giving a restraining order.

724
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:45,700
Yeah I saw that and I also
read the fucking judges quote.

725
00:47:46,850 --> 00:47:50,870
I looked it up and I read along with your
pockets. Sentencing was only postpone.

726
00:47:51,290 --> 00:47:53,510
She isn't getting out of jail time yet.

727
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:57,020
Yeah but don't you find it fucked up
what you can address the fact that the

728
00:47:57,021 --> 00:48:00,740
judge said You're so talented I don't
wanna derail your fucking what you could

729
00:48:00,741 --> 00:48:01,970
possibly achieve.

730
00:48:02,870 --> 00:48:04,700
You don't think that's
weird for him to say that

731
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:11,520
you don't think race and
gender affects your sentencing.

732
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:15,080
You don't think that you don't think
that any day that there's all this racism

733
00:48:15,081 --> 00:48:18,710
there's all this sexism and all that
but in the court of law there isn't.

734
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:24,370
There isn't status there isn't you're
at Oxford versus you're just somebody on

735
00:48:24,371 --> 00:48:26,500
the street you stab somebody
with a fucking knife.

736
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:28,690
You don't think that any of
that comes into play sir.

737
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:34,840
So anyways he says if you ask me which
it didn't I think this is a good thing.

738
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:39,100
If she is as bright as the people at the
schools say she is she can definitely

739
00:48:39,101 --> 00:48:40,630
do a lot of good in her career.

740
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:45,460
In sentencing her for a
one off would ruin that.

741
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:47,270
So you're agreeing with this guy.

742
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:52,220
Oh my God this is fucking hilarious.
You're sitting there saying that I'm not.

743
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:56,090
That's basically what it is.
It's not that I was misinformed.

744
00:48:57,430 --> 00:48:58,263
OK.

745
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:00,680
It's that you agreed with the judge.

746
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:05,330
He said that being said she needs to
be held responsible. So what is it.

747
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:11,140
Seeing as if it was only a butter knife
I think mandatory anger management

748
00:49:11,961 --> 00:49:16,530
classes is an order at the very least.
Thanks and go fuck yourself.

749
00:49:16,550 --> 00:49:20,330
Come back to Madison. You were great
last time. Go fuck yourself again sir.

750
00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:22,910
She stabs somebody with a knife.

751
00:49:26,910 --> 00:49:27,960
Let me let that sink in.

752
00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:32,990
She stabs someone with a fucking knife
but because she goes to Oxford and she

753
00:49:34,761 --> 00:49:39,520
could be a doctor
you're out of your fucking mind.

754
00:49:39,650 --> 00:49:44,650
You're just like the judge you're like
oh look at her she's a girl she's doing

755
00:49:45,051 --> 00:49:49,100
so well in school she looks like me.

756
00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:52,640
It was just a bread knife.
You're doing what they're doing.

757
00:49:55,670 --> 00:49:57,110
In a perfect world sir.

758
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:01,610
Stabbing somebody with a knife and the
punishment is stabbing someone with a

759
00:50:01,611 --> 00:50:04,070
knife. In the punishment.
And that's fucking it.

760
00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:08,030
Go watch said fucking trap car thing or
whatever the fuck they call it with a

761
00:50:08,031 --> 00:50:09,800
pocket down in the
fucking poor neighborhood.

762
00:50:09,830 --> 00:50:12,080
They rest one black eye
after fucking another

763
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:16,670
I mean that's they're not
trying to help anybody.

764
00:50:16,730 --> 00:50:18,920
You don't think anybody
down there has potential.

765
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:23,840
You just gonna say it's gonna
fucking do that to them.

766
00:50:25,770 --> 00:50:28,410
Why do they just do why they don't
why don't they do than a fucking white

767
00:50:28,411 --> 00:50:29,244
neighborhood.

768
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:35,580
Mike I don't know. I don't I just
don't see the world the way you do sir.

769
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:37,650
And you see it the way that judge does.

770
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:42,740
And I also think that you are like what
you're taking into consideration which

771
00:50:43,981 --> 00:50:46,920
is is the fact that she's at
Oxford and she could be a doctor.

772
00:50:46,950 --> 00:50:51,950
You're completely and you're
now downplaying that she
stabbed someone and yes

773
00:50:52,021 --> 00:50:52,854
you are sir.

774
00:50:53,010 --> 00:50:57,300
Yes you are because you said she should
take anger management classes at the

775
00:50:57,301 --> 00:50:58,260
very least

776
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:05,280
like you might call me fucking overly
liberal but if you stab someone you should

777
00:51:05,281 --> 00:51:06,170
go to jail.

778
00:51:06,870 --> 00:51:09,990
Regardless of what your potential is
Do you realize that this woman if she

779
00:51:09,991 --> 00:51:14,370
becomes a surgeon will have a knife in
her hand every fucking day of her goddamn

780
00:51:14,371 --> 00:51:16,980
career just about and it won't
be a fucking butter knife.

781
00:51:19,290 --> 00:51:22,830
Jesus fucking Christ and when she goes
to cut somebody open and then finds out

782
00:51:22,831 --> 00:51:25,750
that they have state insurance rather
than private What the fuck is she going to

783
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:26,573
do then

784
00:51:28,290 --> 00:51:31,470
just because you go to Oxford doesn't
mean you couldn't be a fucking lunatic.

785
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:33,983
You don't know me.

786
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:39,610
And people in those schools commit
murders and they do commit crimes but they

787
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:43,560
don't go to jail the way poorer
people with more of a tan do.

788
00:51:43,830 --> 00:51:44,970
I don't know if you've noticed that.

789
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:48,600
So for us to bring up the fact that
she was a woman and that she was white.

790
00:51:49,590 --> 00:51:51,690
Was not we were not uninformed.

791
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:54,960
We're actually more than I actually you
know I'm going to pat myself on the back

792
00:51:54,990 --> 00:51:56,640
I'm more fucking enlightened than you are.

793
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:01,320
OK. Because I'm not saying
that because of who she is.

794
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:02,570
She should get punished more.

795
00:52:02,610 --> 00:52:04,020
She should get the punishment

796
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:07,920
I think once you stab somebody.

797
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:11,580
What the fuck you doing in the rest of
your life is out the goddamn window.

798
00:52:13,410 --> 00:52:17,160
And I know you guys don't say what they
do that they do that all the time they

799
00:52:17,161 --> 00:52:21,760
fucking take into consideration if people
have children and blah blah blah blah.

800
00:52:21,990 --> 00:52:26,250
Yeah I know they do but the
consideration is a lot smaller.

801
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:30,840
By the level of tan you have and whether
you have a dick hanging between your

802
00:52:30,841 --> 00:52:32,820
legs or not.
And that's the fucking truth.

803
00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:38,180
Go into a bar.
A woman can slap a guy in the face.

804
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:40,910
Dump a drink over his fucking head.
She's not getting kicked out.

805
00:52:42,850 --> 00:52:47,410
She's not if she's if she's hot
she's a fucking wildebeest Yeah.

806
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:49,030
Throw her out in the fucking dumpster.

807
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:52,340
Come on people this isn't this
isn't new information. All right.

808
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:56,770
Stop acting like Good Lord. All right.
Why airlines lost their privilege.

809
00:52:58,390 --> 00:52:59,223
Hey Bill.

810
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:00,873
Big fan.

811
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:04,660
Love your podcast you recently ask why
airlines are not as prestigious as it was

812
00:53:04,661 --> 00:53:06,070
in the 70s as a pilot.

813
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:11,100
I have an answer for you I love
when the pilots write in Sky Pilot

814
00:53:13,850 --> 00:53:18,140
why is it still great in 1978.
Hah.

815
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:23,260
I'm Jim McCone Jimmy Carter signed
the airline deck deregulation act.

816
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:29,180
Leave it to a peanut farmer from Georgia
to ruin the fucking prestige of airline

817
00:53:29,181 --> 00:53:30,014
train travel.

818
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:35,200
Prior to this law the government allowed
equal usage of federal airways among

819
00:53:36,290 --> 00:53:38,470
all the airlines. All
right. You're he lost me.

820
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:43,160
Maybe this law the government allowed
equal usage of federal airways among all

821
00:53:43,161 --> 00:53:48,161
airlines so the only way for airlines
to compete effectively was with good

822
00:53:48,801 --> 00:53:52,210
customer service.
OK.

823
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:57,350
After the law went into effect airlines
were able to bid for exclusive usage of

824
00:53:57,351 --> 00:54:02,351
certain airways airways are basically
the streets in the sky so different

825
00:54:04,670 --> 00:54:09,420
OK. Oh I see so then and everybody
had their territory so is like.

826
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:14,940
That's right. There was Eastern
Airlines. They just flew there. OK.

827
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:19,020
All right. American and United flew
cross country. So it's like wrestling.

828
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:22,780
Back in the day where everybody had
their territories and then rather than

829
00:54:22,781 --> 00:54:27,330
having one guy
dominate the whole thing like Vince.

830
00:54:27,910 --> 00:54:30,830
It became a bidding war.
OK.

831
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:34,900
After the law went into effect airlines
were able to bid exclusive usage of

832
00:54:34,901 --> 00:54:39,901
certain airways so airways essentially
gain monopolies on most of their routes

833
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:45,410
with customers having little or no say
in which airline to take the airlines

834
00:54:45,411 --> 00:54:47,150
were able to get us by the balls.

835
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:52,180
So now airlines business strategy has
shifted from good customer service to

836
00:54:52,701 --> 00:54:56,840
monopolizing their airways and packing
as many people as possible into their

837
00:54:56,841 --> 00:54:59,600
plane planes.
Hope this helps.

838
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:00,940
It started too.

839
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:06,260
What should I look up I should look up
the Airline Deregulation Act now that all

840
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:11,261
of a sudden in the era of fake news I'm
being suddenly being held accountable

841
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:13,290
for what the fuck I say.

842
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:15,950
I can't believe this.
You guys are so disappointing me.

843
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:20,810
Can somebody please write in and mock
these fucking assholes all right.

844
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:23,380
Not saying that the pilot here.
All right.

845
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:28,480
Airline Deregulation Act airline
D Regulation Act Jimmy Carter.

846
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:38,960
And effects. Let's see what
we got here. Oh my God.

847
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:41,250
All right.
Whiskey.

848
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:44,030
The law that changed the airline industry.

849
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:47,000
That's the one that looks like OK
this is the one I will read up on.

850
00:55:48,450 --> 00:55:51,020
Are you guys going to try to make me
informed and then I'll deny you know what

851
00:55:51,021 --> 00:55:55,870
happens when you know arms
become uniformed he become
an arrogant ass you know

852
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,410
you start smoking a pipe you fuckin
eyebrows are always trying to touch each

853
00:56:00,411 --> 00:56:04,630
other as you wrinkle up you for her. No
one wants to be around that all right.

854
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:09,580
A law that changed the airline
industry beyond recognition. 1978

855
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:18,290
okay before deregulation airlines
competed on service alone as fares were

856
00:56:18,441 --> 00:56:21,480
regulated by the government.
I didn't know that.

857
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:25,880
I mean granted I was fuckin 10 years
old 1970. Many remember this era.

858
00:56:25,910 --> 00:56:29,750
Finally is the golden age of aviation.
When stewardesses.

859
00:56:30,790 --> 00:56:35,230
As flight attendants
were then known carved

860
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:42,800
I can Chateaubriand on rolling
silver carts and airlines put P.A.

861
00:56:43,101 --> 00:56:48,101
lounges in upper decks of their Boeing
747 as passengers dressed up to board

862
00:56:48,741 --> 00:56:53,660
flights and flying was glamorous and
exciting and mainly for the rich.

863
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:59,120
That's why the Liberals deregulation
resulted in the rise of a new kind of

864
00:56:59,121 --> 00:56:59,954
airline.

865
00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:04,990
The low cost carrier El Sisi at the time
of deregulation Southwest Airlines was

866
00:57:05,931 --> 00:57:10,931
a small regional airline prevented
by CAIB rules and what that is.

867
00:57:11,330 --> 00:57:16,330
From flying outside of
Texas today Southwest is the
largest domestic US carrier

868
00:57:17,091 --> 00:57:21,980
in terms of passenger traffic something
no one could have foreseen in 1978.

869
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:22,440
Yeah.

870
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:24,790
That's back when stewardesses
were fucking hot.

871
00:57:26,390 --> 00:57:31,080
So now it's a bunch of animals they pack
us all in and then it's just like yeah

872
00:57:31,190 --> 00:57:35,660
the heart is like oh fuck this I'm going
to go sell jello shots at a goddamn one

873
00:57:35,661 --> 00:57:39,860
of those deejay shows where baby baby.
Wow wow wow wow wow.

874
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:44,810
Right. Southwest is a success
story but deregulation allowed.

875
00:57:44,870 --> 00:57:46,600
Yeah I hate flying Southwest.

876
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:50,750
I fucking hate it you know why I hate
how the stewardesses sit there making

877
00:57:50,751 --> 00:57:54,080
jokes and fucking around it's like
dude my life is in your hands here.

878
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:58,170
You're not making me more relaxed doing
your fucking Dean Martin impression.

879
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:04,690
But deregulation allowed airlines to
innovate new business models people people

880
00:58:04,691 --> 00:58:05,370
express.

881
00:58:05,370 --> 00:58:09,730
I remember that number ValuJet that one
went down people express may have come

882
00:58:09,731 --> 00:58:10,564
and gone.

883
00:58:11,390 --> 00:58:16,390
May someday be revived but in others
like it shook up the white glove world of

884
00:58:17,591 --> 00:58:19,570
the US airline industry and

885
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:23,660
democracies travel hub I said that right.

886
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:29,140
We may peer through our rose colored
glasses and yearn for the days of Chateau

887
00:58:29,451 --> 00:58:34,451
bring all in piano lounges but ultimate
companies like Southwest and newer ones

888
00:58:35,241 --> 00:58:38,750
like Spirit are allowed more
people to fly more often.

889
00:58:39,290 --> 00:58:41,000
Yeah.
And now look at the result.

890
00:58:41,330 --> 00:58:45,570
You got people with no shoes on
walking into the bathroom. Oh my God.

891
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:47,520
It all came full circle.

892
00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:51,260
Holy shit do I like being informed.

893
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:56,920
Deregulation left the international
carriers like Pan Am in Braniff and to a

894
00:58:57,051 --> 00:59:02,051
lesser extent TWC TransWorld Airlines
without robust domestic feeder networks.

895
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:08,520
What that means and it allowed domestic
carriers like Delta Airlines to apply

896
00:59:08,521 --> 00:59:09,780
for international routes.

897
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:14,310
Pan Am and Braniff scrambled to create
domestic networks but ultimately were

898
00:59:14,311 --> 00:59:15,250
unsuccessful.

899
00:59:16,170 --> 00:59:20,370
Although it took until 2004 TWC to
be absorbed into American Airlines

900
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:26,310
some argue that massive consolidation
of the US airline industry in the last

901
00:59:26,311 --> 00:59:31,311
decade which has resulted in three large
carriers for when Southwest is included

902
00:59:32,070 --> 00:59:35,070
is deregulations final act.

903
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:39,540
The network carriers that survive Delta
United and American learned to be tough

904
00:59:39,541 --> 00:59:43,710
competitors and combined existing
domestic networks with the international

905
00:59:43,711 --> 00:59:48,120
networks acquired in large part by
carriers like Pan Am. That didn't make it.

906
00:59:49,050 --> 00:59:49,883
Get the fuck out.

907
00:59:49,950 --> 00:59:54,950
So now they have to drag
people off flights barefooted
lunatics and then you got

908
00:59:55,801 --> 01:00:00,110
people fucking you know you ever see those
people that just fly around the world

909
01:00:00,111 --> 01:00:03,650
all the time trying to get Miles and shit
just created all these bottom feeders.

910
01:00:05,270 --> 01:00:09,910
Wow do you think a VIP airline
would would make it I wonder

911
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:16,210
you know in this era of Donald Trump if
they just they if they didn't even try

912
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:18,980
to be nice just be.

913
01:00:19,150 --> 01:00:21,790
I wish I wish I could do a Trump
impression should be a lot of animals

914
01:00:23,290 --> 01:00:24,580
flying barefoot of here.

915
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:28,380
And then you know all the liberals have
no idea why you saying it barefooted

916
01:00:28,390 --> 01:00:32,340
people shouldn't be allowed to
let it be your feet a bare feet.

917
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:35,913
Too Can you.

918
01:00:35,980 --> 01:00:40,980
What if what if they had a fuck that
you couldn't do it nowadays if you had a

919
01:00:41,801 --> 01:00:44,830
fucking top line airline.

920
01:00:45,150 --> 01:00:50,020
Okay all first class seats
all hot stewardesses.

921
01:00:50,770 --> 01:00:55,770
You know first of all all the fucking
you know all the fucking feminists would

922
01:00:56,171 --> 01:01:01,171
be up in arms would all be up in arms
saying that they your objective flying

923
01:01:01,211 --> 01:01:03,490
these women blah blah blah blah blah.

924
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:07,420
And at the end of the I don't know I agree
with some of that feminist shit but a

925
01:01:07,421 --> 01:01:10,930
lot of times I just feel like it's
women who aren't good looking.

926
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:15,220
Hating on good looking women and just
being mad that could look and women don't

927
01:01:15,221 --> 01:01:16,180
have to work as hard.

928
01:01:17,260 --> 01:01:18,093
You know

929
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:23,920
it's like that whole thing that you're
going to somehow get people to give.

930
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:28,660
Not as good looking women not as good
looking man not as strong men like a

931
01:01:28,661 --> 01:01:32,950
chance it's not how it works you got to
like you gotta look at it like sports

932
01:01:33,010 --> 01:01:37,690
and realize that you're not the Jordan
you're not Sidney Crosby all right.

933
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:42,720
You're on the fourth line OK so what you
have to be is you have to be a fucking

934
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:46,490
you've got to be a gamer.
You know.

935
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:50,360
This is coming from a bald
redheaded male so go fuck yourself.

936
01:01:50,390 --> 01:01:51,780
If you think I'm being elitist here.

937
01:01:51,830 --> 01:01:54,920
OK you got to be scrappy you've
got to go in the corners.

938
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:59,450
All right you've got to drop the gloves
every so healthy you gotta do that.

939
01:02:00,570 --> 01:02:00,950
OK.

940
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:04,670
You're not going to get the calls you're
going to have to work 10 times fucking

941
01:02:04,671 --> 01:02:09,320
harder than other people to get you know
half as much over the expression goes

942
01:02:09,321 --> 01:02:10,790
but it's gotta make you stronger.

943
01:02:11,490 --> 01:02:14,930
You know what's great is your
fall from grace from your youth.

944
01:02:15,010 --> 01:02:18,330
6 As you slide into a
four is not that bad.

945
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:22,960
But at the end of everybody's life
everybody looks like a 4 or 2 OK.

946
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:27,600
But you have a nice soft landing you do
a little bit of a belly flop you get the

947
01:02:27,601 --> 01:02:29,760
wind knocked out here between 20 and 60.

948
01:02:30,150 --> 01:02:34,420
All right these fucking tense I mean
they've fallen off the top of a goddamn

949
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:37,860
building. OK then a lot of
them they don't survive it.

950
01:02:38,970 --> 01:02:42,270
They don't if you look at their botox
faces they look like they landed face

951
01:02:42,271 --> 01:02:44,040
first the fucking lips are all swollen.

952
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:49,230
I mean Jesus Christ look at these fucking
near watches this show and these women

953
01:02:49,231 --> 01:02:54,231
will not stop taking fat from the back
of their arms and injected him in their

954
01:02:54,961 --> 01:02:59,580
ass and they've got these stupid looking
fucking asses now and their legs look

955
01:02:59,581 --> 01:03:03,810
like my legs with this weird
like they look like ostriches.

956
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:09,720
I don't know why they did that

957
01:03:11,490 --> 01:03:16,490
I just I just don't fucking understand
why they get what point it's like they're

958
01:03:16,531 --> 01:03:19,500
literally like Michael Jackson where
Michael Jackson couldn't see what he's

959
01:03:19,501 --> 01:03:23,790
doing to his face these women cannot
see what they're doing to their asses I

960
01:03:23,791 --> 01:03:24,624
don't understand it.

961
01:03:24,630 --> 01:03:27,540
So anyways you know it was
actually fascinating and I
make fun of the fact that

962
01:03:27,710 --> 01:03:31,950
I'm not a well read guy because it gives
me license to be lazy and that's what I

963
01:03:31,951 --> 01:03:32,910
like to do best.

964
01:03:33,750 --> 01:03:37,350
OK but if you fucking assholes are going
to keep reading I did I did enjoy that

965
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:41,970
I do enjoy I like drums
shit I like aviation I like
that type of shit all right.

966
01:03:42,030 --> 01:03:46,520
So if you're going to fucking really
start hold my feet to the fire here.

967
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:48,750
Could you please try to keep it.

968
01:03:51,650 --> 01:03:54,630
Well I guess I have the
power right I have the power.

969
01:03:55,390 --> 01:03:57,480
Where I can actually decide.

970
01:04:00,690 --> 01:04:03,180
What the fuck it is that I want to
read or what I don't want to read.

971
01:04:04,830 --> 01:04:07,380
Speaking of which for some reason I
woke up this morning thinking about Roy

972
01:04:07,381 --> 01:04:12,090
Haynes and the fact that he's still
alive and still doing gigs and all the

973
01:04:12,091 --> 01:04:13,360
fucking people he's played with.

974
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:15,730
Like I saw a bunch of great jazz
drummers before they passed.

975
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:20,100
I saw Max Roach I saw Tony Williams.
I saw Louis Belson.

976
01:04:21,110 --> 01:04:22,110
And I saw Roy Haynes.

977
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:25,860
I saw Roy Haynes like 20 something years
ago and he's in his 70s is now 92 and I

978
01:04:25,861 --> 01:04:28,140
looked it up like this
guy's still on the road.

979
01:04:28,170 --> 01:04:33,100
He's got a road gig
coming up in September.

980
01:04:33,150 --> 01:04:36,480
Like the Blue Note in New York City
he's from Roxbury Massachusetts.

981
01:04:38,370 --> 01:04:42,060
Fellow Boston guy I'm a suburb guy.
He's actually in Boston but

982
01:04:44,890 --> 01:04:47,320
I don't think that's pretty fucking
cool the guy's still gigging out there.

983
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:53,680
Manitoba guy he played with Charlie
Parker Miles Davis Sarah Vaughan Chloe all

984
01:04:54,951 --> 01:04:57,180
the way up right up through
like young people today.

985
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:00,720
The guy's been playing drums
professionally for 70 goddamn years.

986
01:05:01,620 --> 01:05:04,360
So I don't know if you're into drums
you've got to go see that guy. All right.

987
01:05:04,410 --> 01:05:05,243
Let me go.

988
01:05:05,590 --> 01:05:10,060
We read some more of the
All right.

989
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:14,720
Let me read these last two cultural
appropriation. Dear Billy rationale.

990
01:05:15,110 --> 01:05:18,440
Things are getting crazy these
days because of technology
it's definitely a lot

991
01:05:18,441 --> 01:05:20,990
easier to be critical
of what everyone does.

992
01:05:21,290 --> 01:05:25,370
I'm sure you've experienced this before
where people try and misrepresent what

993
01:05:25,371 --> 01:05:29,600
you say for whatever self-serving
reason they may have.

994
01:05:29,660 --> 01:05:32,300
Yes of course that would
be the Huffington Post.

995
01:05:33,110 --> 01:05:37,940
One of the things going on today that
really bugs me is the accusation of

996
01:05:37,941 --> 01:05:39,500
cultural appropriation.

997
01:05:40,190 --> 01:05:45,190
I hate picking extreme sides to any
arguments so I will say I do think that

998
01:05:45,921 --> 01:05:48,170
there are cases of cultural disrespect.

999
01:05:48,590 --> 01:05:53,090
Let's say someone wears a religious or
cultural garb and is overly disrespectful

1000
01:05:53,091 --> 01:05:58,091
for the purpose of trolling that could
be that could be cultural appropriation.

1001
01:05:58,970 --> 01:05:59,930
You put that in quotes.

1002
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:04,760
So do you not think it is but almost
everything anyone does is derived from

1003
01:06:04,761 --> 01:06:06,500
another culture in some respect.

1004
01:06:07,610 --> 01:06:12,230
There is a YouTube video where a young
black college girl berates a hippie for

1005
01:06:12,231 --> 01:06:17,000
his cornrows and it seems a bit silly
because the kid is just doing what every

1006
01:06:17,001 --> 01:06:21,080
other walkies who listen to fish do.
I don't know what a wookie is.

1007
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:26,190
There's somebody into Chewbacca now.
Fuck now I got to look this up.

1008
01:06:26,210 --> 01:06:27,320
What the fuck is a wookie

1009
01:06:30,020 --> 01:06:35,010
a white something wookie meaning slang.

1010
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:42,080
A wookie urban dictionary a wookie a
wookie is a hairy yet modernised human

1011
01:06:45,481 --> 01:06:50,481
being that commonly is seen in the
western in the western most regions of

1012
01:06:50,761 --> 01:06:55,500
Washington a gentle creature by nature
but tends to get a little erratic when it

1013
01:06:55,501 --> 01:07:00,360
overindulge itself with its favorite
foods its diet consists mainly of a blend

1014
01:07:00,361 --> 01:07:04,080
of barley and hops.
If you see these creatures

1015
01:07:05,820 --> 01:07:10,820
be cautious as to whether you should
provide him with these items they will

1016
01:07:11,531 --> 01:07:16,531
commonly respond to the name of Richard
Pulliam but be very wary of these

1017
01:07:17,321 --> 01:07:18,520
creatures.
I have no idea.

1018
01:07:19,030 --> 01:07:23,170
They're usually um remember a certain
brand of cookie that is very chewy.

1019
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:29,320
A wookie is a lifeless idiot whose whole
existence consists of falling around

1020
01:07:29,321 --> 01:07:30,040
jam bands.

1021
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:35,040
Here we go and not showering or shaving
when they're not panhandling or trying

1022
01:07:35,471 --> 01:07:36,430
to rip people off.

1023
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:41,440
They're selling veggie burritos a grilled
cheese to fund their useless existence.

1024
01:07:41,740 --> 01:07:44,410
They stand for nothing and
care about nobody else.

1025
01:07:44,650 --> 01:07:48,850
Not to be confused with a hippie AP As
someone who lives a certain lifestyle due

1026
01:07:48,851 --> 01:07:53,851
to their belief 50s often shower and have
jobs used in a sentence shows yo those

1027
01:07:55,301 --> 01:07:58,540
walkies over there are
trying to sell beat rolls.

1028
01:08:00,550 --> 01:08:03,530
That's from fucking 2003. So I guess
they've been around for a while.

1029
01:08:03,660 --> 01:08:06,430
OK
all right let me get back to that.

1030
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:09,070
OK so now you know what a wookie is
and what a wookie is and I know about

1031
01:08:09,071 --> 01:08:12,670
airline deregulation and now I'm going
to be insufferable the next fuckin social

1032
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:15,440
event is I try to work both of
those into the conversation.

1033
01:08:18,650 --> 01:08:23,010
Where the fuck is it
I was an anthropology major.

1034
01:08:23,310 --> 01:08:26,910
Which doesn't make me an expert but it
definitely informs my opinion of this.

1035
01:08:27,210 --> 01:08:31,350
I went to culinary school after college
and learned even more about cultures

1036
01:08:31,351 --> 01:08:32,190
through their food.

1037
01:08:32,730 --> 01:08:35,670
I came up upon this article and
wanted to get your take upon it.

1038
01:08:36,090 --> 01:08:40,740
Take a couple girls in Portland Oregon
started a food truck selling Mexican food.

1039
01:08:41,010 --> 01:08:45,540
They traveled around and learned recipes
the way every chef I've ever known has

1040
01:08:45,970 --> 01:08:50,010
done. They were accused of cultural
appropriation because they're not Mexican.

1041
01:08:50,370 --> 01:08:54,900
I'm not going to go on a tirade of mother
fucker mother fucks but my adrenaline

1042
01:08:54,901 --> 01:08:56,880
really starts going
when I think about this.

1043
01:08:56,940 --> 01:09:00,990
I haven't heard you speak about cultural
appropriation yet and wanted to get

1044
01:09:00,991 --> 01:09:04,500
your take. Here's a link.
Oh the Huffington Post.

1045
01:09:04,770 --> 01:09:08,010
What a fucking surprise.
Thanks for your podcast.

1046
01:09:08,730 --> 01:09:10,140
You're a great dad and husband.

1047
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:14,790
How do you know that you have no idea.
I hate the fucking Huffington Post.

1048
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:19,550
They're always trying
to stir up some shit.

1049
01:09:19,610 --> 01:09:23,420
You know I hate all these organizations
that try to act like they're their news

1050
01:09:23,450 --> 01:09:26,890
organization and you read two articles
and you know who everybody on the website

1051
01:09:26,930 --> 01:09:31,630
voted for essentially. It's like back in
the day like it was supposed to be. No

1052
01:09:33,260 --> 01:09:36,050
fewer journalists you were supposed
to just sort of present what the fuck

1053
01:09:36,051 --> 01:09:39,290
happened not making up.
If you say this.

1054
01:09:39,620 --> 01:09:41,600
That's probably because you're doing that.

1055
01:09:42,590 --> 01:09:45,540
That's like that whole fucking web site
and I shouldn't just single them out.

1056
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:49,820
There's a bunch of them out there and
but they're held in like this esteem.

1057
01:09:49,850 --> 01:09:54,770
I just don't understand it
anyways. Cultural appropriation is

1058
01:09:58,220 --> 01:09:59,540
I don't fucking know.

1059
01:10:00,940 --> 01:10:04,540
You know look if you if you have an
appreciation for Mexican food you still

1060
01:10:04,550 --> 01:10:07,070
learn how to cook it and then you sell it.

1061
01:10:07,550 --> 01:10:11,630
I think at that point if
you become successful that's
when people get annoyed by

1062
01:10:11,631 --> 01:10:15,380
it.
And college kids are really extreme.

1063
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:20,900
In their thoughts as I do you know you're
fucking breaking free of your parents.

1064
01:10:20,930 --> 01:10:24,140
You know when you got some anger issues
probably towards your parents so you're

1065
01:10:24,141 --> 01:10:29,141
very you're very open to
radical fucking sort of ideas.

1066
01:10:31,130 --> 01:10:33,830
You know going all the way over here
all the way over there it's a very

1067
01:10:33,831 --> 01:10:38,831
dangerous time in your life because
you make very extreme judgements snap

1068
01:10:40,611 --> 01:10:42,620
judgment calls with your young brain

1069
01:10:44,270 --> 01:10:49,270
as I did and that can cause you
to do stupid shit like join cults.

1070
01:10:51,770 --> 01:10:56,770
Blow yourself up at a fucking concert
you know for some stupid fucking cause.

1071
01:10:59,030 --> 01:11:04,030
All the way to like I don't know what
fucking without a condom you know you just

1072
01:11:05,740 --> 01:11:07,020
it's pretty fucking wild thing.

1073
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:09,230
This is why I don't talk
about shit like this.

1074
01:11:09,260 --> 01:11:12,300
I don't know what a cultural
appropriation is. I don't know what it is.

1075
01:11:12,380 --> 01:11:15,860
I know is that my culture is the matrix.

1076
01:11:16,310 --> 01:11:20,480
So everybody's allowed you know I don't
get upset when people get on airplanes

1077
01:11:20,870 --> 01:11:22,870
B.A.
that's some white shit you know.

1078
01:11:29,540 --> 01:11:33,470
I would say that if they're two white
girls being white and they're making great

1079
01:11:33,471 --> 01:11:36,770
fucking Mexican food good for them
but if they're sitting there wearing a

1080
01:11:36,771 --> 01:11:40,640
fucking sombrero and talking like
speeding Gonzalez when they do it. Yeah.

1081
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:45,700
Then I would get upset but you know
there's plenty of Asian infused this and

1082
01:11:45,951 --> 01:11:48,470
French and fuse that and

1083
01:11:50,410 --> 01:11:54,220
cultures to me and all of that shit to me.
It's like.

1084
01:11:54,850 --> 01:11:56,030
It's like the MMI

1085
01:11:57,660 --> 01:12:01,500
how is how was like How good were the
martial arts when it was you would just

1086
01:12:01,501 --> 01:12:02,334
want discipline.

1087
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:08,360
You know everyone I I I am a Kito I am
fucking taekwondo I do karate I fucking

1088
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:11,040
box or whatever.

1089
01:12:11,580 --> 01:12:14,790
And then a guy Bruce Lee comes around
he's like I'll take a little dance I'll

1090
01:12:14,791 --> 01:12:18,630
take a little of that wasn't
he doing that you know.

1091
01:12:18,780 --> 01:12:21,780
And then he was teaching it to fucking
the round eyed guys over here and

1092
01:12:21,781 --> 01:12:23,970
everybody over in Asia is
like hey that's our shit.

1093
01:12:24,020 --> 01:12:27,630
Don't be showing it to their shit and
now look at it now look how great the

1094
01:12:27,631 --> 01:12:28,540
fuckin fighters are.

1095
01:12:30,050 --> 01:12:30,650
You know what I mean.

1096
01:12:30,650 --> 01:12:34,610
I would love to see Bruce Lee today if
he beat him back then if he got into the

1097
01:12:34,611 --> 01:12:36,780
fuckin ring you know what I mean.

1098
01:12:37,610 --> 01:12:42,350
Did he ever have to deal with a double
legged takedown what would happen to him.

1099
01:12:42,410 --> 01:12:45,740
Does he have a ground and pound
defense ground and pound didn't exist.

1100
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:47,990
Could that man fight on his back.

1101
01:12:48,620 --> 01:12:53,620
That's how much it's progressed so I feel
everything should get all fuckin mixed

1102
01:12:54,381 --> 01:12:57,350
up and then shit spins
out of that easy just like

1103
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:01,950
I think it's just when you start to act
like you're the thing that you're doing.

1104
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:05,940
You know what I mean like
people do.

1105
01:13:05,970 --> 01:13:10,970
But the thing is is if you start
getting into like like whatever Japanese

1106
01:13:11,041 --> 01:13:11,874
cuisine

1107
01:13:13,460 --> 01:13:17,270
OK or you get into anime or whatever
I'm watching this anime show like I just

1108
01:13:17,271 --> 01:13:18,590
watch it and I appreciate it.

1109
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:22,760
I don't start walking around with the
rising sun fucking T-shirt and I get some

1110
01:13:22,761 --> 01:13:27,761
swords criss crossed on my walls you
know starts sitting on the floor and a

1111
01:13:28,821 --> 01:13:30,920
pillow with a little short table.
You know what I mean.

1112
01:13:32,420 --> 01:13:34,330
I mean where I don't know
I don't know where you are.

1113
01:13:34,540 --> 01:13:36,020
I think it's all how you do it.

1114
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:42,920
I mean I walk into an Asian person's
house and they've got a bunch of shit from

1115
01:13:42,921 --> 01:13:43,400
Ikea.

1116
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:46,910
I don't go like you know you're
appropriating my culture.

1117
01:13:47,210 --> 01:13:48,980
What's what that L shaped couch

1118
01:13:50,530 --> 01:13:55,030
but they're also not a pressing
me and I'm not pressing anybody.

1119
01:13:55,060 --> 01:13:58,090
But overall the fuck and you
know a longtime concept to top.

1120
01:13:58,150 --> 01:14:01,780
Ah so that's what it really
comes down to it really.

1121
01:14:01,810 --> 01:14:06,530
I think it really comes down to why
people get held to that standard of of

1122
01:14:06,550 --> 01:14:11,550
cultural appropriation because you know
we can the damage we can do and we can

1123
01:14:12,971 --> 01:14:16,960
be really ignorant with it and then
other times people are just being country

1124
01:14:17,140 --> 01:14:20,170
like I'm not going to read this fucking
article but if it's just a couple of

1125
01:14:20,171 --> 01:14:24,310
white chicks make Mexican food they're
crushing it you know and they're dressed

1126
01:14:24,311 --> 01:14:27,190
like White Chicks going like
Oh my God who wants a burrito.

1127
01:14:27,670 --> 01:14:30,740
I don't think there's a problem with
that if they're killing it right.

1128
01:14:30,850 --> 01:14:34,510
It's a fucking food truck fill
your pie hole up and shadow.

1129
01:14:35,260 --> 01:14:39,670
All right girlfriend
Hey man what's up.

1130
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:43,750
I just we had a few questions.
Sorry for the lack of punctuation.

1131
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:46,390
We'll use parentheses when he said that.

1132
01:14:46,690 --> 01:14:50,990
I flew this girl out all the way to Japan.
You know something.

1133
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:52,780
Fuck you I'm not reading this shit.

1134
01:14:54,570 --> 01:14:56,940
You this you want you
rewrite this fucking thing.

1135
01:14:58,730 --> 01:15:02,330
You rewrite this fucking thing okay.
And then I'll read it. Go fuck yourself.

1136
01:15:02,810 --> 01:15:06,260
Sorry for the lack of punctuation. Yes
I am not fucking pregnant. There you go.

1137
01:15:06,290 --> 01:15:08,660
I draw the line at lack of punctuation.

1138
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:11,600
I hate when people fucking go.

1139
01:15:12,020 --> 01:15:15,740
Sorry if you're sorry you would've taken
the time to to put some shit in there.

1140
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:19,550
You didn't. You're not sorry
you're fucking lazy so fuck off.

1141
01:15:19,580 --> 01:15:22,040
Now I'm going to be lazy right back
to you and I read your goddamn shit.

1142
01:15:22,070 --> 01:15:27,070
However if you want to fix it put some
punctuation in and I will read it.

1143
01:15:27,620 --> 01:15:30,530
God damn it I will read it all right.
The Red Sox

1144
01:15:32,170 --> 01:15:36,140
were in second place and the evil
empire Yankees are in first place.

1145
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:38,980
Those evil mother fuckers with
all their homegrown talent.

1146
01:15:39,220 --> 01:15:44,220
And here we are the young upstarts with
a 250 million dollar team just doing

1147
01:15:44,231 --> 01:15:46,720
anything we can to try
to keep up with them.

1148
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:52,370
I want to know I want to fucking know
because I already lost a bunch of weight.

1149
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:54,010
I know we end up getting
fucking hurt again.

1150
01:15:54,370 --> 01:15:56,110
I want to know when Pablo's coming back.

1151
01:15:56,560 --> 01:16:00,010
I don't know why I just feel like he's
going to have a great second half of the

1152
01:16:00,011 --> 01:16:00,844
season.

1153
01:16:01,180 --> 01:16:04,600
Pablo Sandoval and he's going
to earn his goddamn money.

1154
01:16:05,530 --> 01:16:08,560
I think the Red Sox are good they're
gonna catch fire here right before the

1155
01:16:08,561 --> 01:16:12,340
All-Star break and it's gonna be
Yankees Red Sox Yankees Red Sox.

1156
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:15,790
It's gonna be great again it's gonna be
fucking hilarious because now we're the

1157
01:16:15,791 --> 01:16:17,470
fucking evil empire that could

1158
01:16:19,540 --> 01:16:24,080
spend it to win a fucking million dollars.
That's my prediction.

1159
01:16:25,270 --> 01:16:26,460
It's gonna go down to them.

1160
01:16:27,970 --> 01:16:28,803
And

1161
01:16:30,010 --> 01:16:35,010
ESPN will blow the Yankees because they
have homegrown talent and they will

1162
01:16:35,891 --> 01:16:39,640
fucking trash the Red Sox for spending
all this fucking money like they never

1163
01:16:39,641 --> 01:16:43,330
trashed the Yankees when they did it back
in the day because that's how it works

1164
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:48,160
because when the Yankees win the World
Series ESPN goes in all is right in the

1165
01:16:48,161 --> 01:16:51,640
baseball universe. It's just like Oh
so you guys are all Yankee fans there.

1166
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:53,320
Why does it make it right.

1167
01:16:57,070 --> 01:17:00,430
I never understood that that they play
favorites like that but I guess that's

1168
01:17:00,431 --> 01:17:03,910
what they do. So you know
what. Fuck them fuck you too.

1169
01:17:04,630 --> 01:17:07,420
Have a great couple of days I'll
check in on you on Thursday.

1170
01:17:07,450 --> 01:17:09,370
Be careful around those
grills you have fatties.
