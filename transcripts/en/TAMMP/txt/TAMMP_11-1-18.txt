Just pull it a little away from your mom. Yeah, maybe like right here. HAP split the difference. Yeah. Little muck closer. How about this? Hey guys, will you keep adjusting the level that you're time? That's fine. Anyways. Oh boy. So then I change. I change her into the outfit that you said and you come walking in like nothing happened.

No, until you're a fucking jerk. It's something, I mean it is, it is. There's a reason human beings are able to yell because God knew that some of them that he made were church. So anyways, then I walk, I'm the king of Mulder now. I, Oh yeah, I'll put the outfit on and when you get a bucket danger area and I go downstairs and I'm making a smoothie. All right. And the, and the thing is not supposed to turn on the, the food processors not supposed to turn on unless you have the whole thing closed and it turned out anyways and stuff is going all over the place and then you come over, you low think it's weakened.

Speaker 1:          00:09:39       It's like all over my shirt. So I give you the look you deserved. I thought it was like leaking from the top and him think he realized that it was coming. No, not from the top. From the bottom. So I didn't, I don't know. I didn't realize that most of that look was because of your, your thing upstairs in the face. Right. So then we're downstairs and I was just like, hey, you know, not for nothing. Yeah. I didn't appreciate you could've said thank you and you like, why do I have to say thank you bill? I told you two times to your face. That's what you said. And I was just like, yeah. And then that's when, that's when I snapped. I still was saying effin in Gd not using the actual words. Right, right, right. I was just like, you're not. Yeah. You're not going to talk to me like that.

Speaker 1:          00:10:25       I'm not gonna be a sweetheart and then be talked to like a jerk because then I become a jerk off. I become a typical Staten island jerk off. I can't believe we're still quoting that show. So many. I loved it. I loved it for people. Never saw that we watch some reality show and there was this woman from Staten Island shoe life. I'm a Staten island girl. Okay. Like the MTV show. True Life. I'm a blank. This is true life. I'm a status. She went into New York and the city into the city. She went to a club, she was dancing with a guy. She had a long island ice tea. It's just dancing with this guy and as he's dancing with her, he's like sorta grabbing is her girlfriend too? Yeah. And she's like, are you like, you like grabbing all my girlfriend? Like why you dance with me? And the guy's like, what were the Dayton? And then they just cut to her outside of the club and she do cause that. Was she a typical Staten Island jerk? Oh No. I thought he says, well, we're not married or something like that. What do we married? Something like that. Something to that effect. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:11:33       anyways, he was going for the threesome and he had just met her. Got To respect up. There's no loyalty in the club. Oh Shit. I think that's got to be, I think that's got to be on a tee shirt. But you got to say, you gotta Say da in Duck Club. No, can't say the, if you say the, then you think maybe it's a white club. Like what are they talking about? The White House. I know, but like the Senate, so over Donald, when people write de whatever on tee shirts, it's just like Courtney has the finger on the pulse of social media. Smith Barney. Oh, it is? What are the top three emojis? Uh, the top of the emojis or the face, the one where the eyes are closed and the mouth is kind of like, ah. I'm like, oh my God, I can't believe this is happening phase. These are my top three. I love that one. I also love the finger on the Chin one one and then I also liked the one eyebrow raised. Those are my faves. You want to hear mine and the crying laughing. Of course you want to hit my what are you and what the thumbs up that covers everything.

Speaker 1:          00:12:48       Yes, I, yes, I heard you like point. Yeah, that sounds good. I feel you. One of the biggest fucking assholes I've ever met. She started like, you know that thumbs up, speaking of which? Yes, I got a text message. It's a way do you forgive me for yeah. And I'll tell you then I'll, and I'll tell you why you do apologize. It was, it was over the top. And I'll tell you why because I'm done. I'm done being the angry guy. I don't give a shit anymore. I'm not too much in. My life has gone by. I'm on, I'm on like fucking the 13th hole here. What am I doing right? 50 years old. That's a golf reference, but I don't know what that 13 towards the end there's only 18 holes. Oh, so you only have five more holes lives? Well. I'm 50 okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:33       You live to 80 that's a great run. Although I am drinking. No, we're going to live longer than that. Remember I, I'm calling it right now. You are going to be like the Don Rickles of your generation and we're going to like live in Las Vegas. You and I were going to live in Las Vegas for like however long they want to book you for like, Oh we want to give them a year, a year residency at this place. We're going to live in Vegas. We're going to live in one of those like obnoxious like Penthouse, five rooms suites in Vegas. It sounds horrible. Why is it so horrible? You're going to go downstairs and be like, hey, just be pulled out and the jokes old people tell I'm going to be like shopping at Caesar's and having lunch at the same place every day. They're going to know it's going to be great getting me.

Speaker 1:          00:14:18       It's going to be so much fun. You're going to shop at Caesar's? Yup. Yup. Cause they have all the stores. You've got to like there's just one store and Caesar's. It's like all the stores that you know, every time we go to Vegas, we're there for about 36 hours. You're like, I gotta get the Fuck Outta here. That's true. But I feel like as you're going to live on the Strip in Las Vegas and this, this is how you're going to go out and your golden years. Wow. I mean, I'm 10 years younger than you, so I'm not going anywhere for a while, but God, God willing. I'll come. What? I'm just saying that would just be fun. Like if you're 80 and I'm 70 yeah. Why? Why don't we just like live in Vegas? Why not? Yeah. I'm not going out like that. New and no one is saying you're going out, but like the cheese, there's a very high live in fucking Vegas.

Speaker 1:          00:15:04       Did he do Vegas? Yeah, he did Vegas. Then he get the fuck out of there. He'd get another gig. You think you're going to be on the road like that when you're 80 years old? Yeah. First of all, I ever retire at some point and just do like a nice local gig. Yeah. It doesn't have to be in Las Vegas. I'm a fucking redhead. Me, I'm not going to be with global warming by the time I'm 80 can be 140 degrees out in the winter. You'd are you doing stand up out in the desert like no, you're inside all those old people that live in Vegas. They stay inside the whole time and Erica and one heat wave like five of them die. Yeah. Cause I can't make it over to their fucking air conditioner. I know. But those are probably the ones who aren't doing so well financially.

Speaker 1:          00:15:43       So they can't afford, they say that they don't matter and that like, you know, chances are they're in places that are caused by wear a silly grin. The moment you come into view. There's a lot of older people who live in Las Vegas, Bill. So I'm just saying you're going to be in a significant air, going to be an air conditioning and you'll be fine. I'm not going to be there. I have a plan. Okay. And it's your plan. As you probably know, this plan is, well it doesn't involve fucking living in a shopping. It's like God living in Las Vegas and some of noxious fucking penthouse. Yeah. Looking at hall. Look at them all down. How'd he get away from the window? Yes. Skin cancer. Oh your ass. That point we'll be sleeping in different suites. Jesus Christ.

Speaker 1:          00:16:43       What was the tech you were about to talk about? Oh, getting back comes up. I favorite emojis. Oh the thumbs up. All right, so this is thing going on on the Internet right now. Cause all Yankee fans are pissed at not only him, but a lot of Yankee fans are pissed at Boston, at the Boston Red Sox fans that are talking shit. Right. All right. There's different kinds of sports fans. This is sports fan that goes, hey man, great series you sons of bitches, you beat us, whatever and you'll leave it at that. Then there's the middle guys who just won't be friends with anybody who's a fan of another team. And then there's the worst of the worst, which are just the shit talk and assholes who talk fucking shit all the time. And then when their team loses, if you can find them, cause they go into hiding to give him the shit back that they deserve, they then act as though they don't understand where this is coming from and have the audacity to be like, oh, class act, class, act.

Speaker 1:          00:17:39       Right. So, um, I don't engage in any of that. Right. Like there's some hilarious stuff on the Internet right now with um, you know, shit talking red sox fans had shit-talking Yankee fans. One of them is like the one of few Yankee fans had the audacity to say the Red Sox bought the, the uh, world series. Oh, they're mad, Huh? Well it's just like, well where did we learn how to do that? You assholes. They this, this spending 20 million a year for like 20 years and this is the first like couple last couple of years they'd go with their farm system, which is brilliant and they're going to get another one and they're going to get another one soon is what I think. As much as I don't want that to happen as a red sox fan, I'm also a fan of baseball. I love what they're doing. So it's just like all you guys, all they're doing is stockpiling their cash and they're going to go out and they're going to spend a ton of fucking money and they're going to come out with it.

Speaker 1:          00:18:30       Whatever the hell you need to spend now to 228 million. Is that what it is that what we spent? Um, and then also go on real class. He real class, he talking shit. Baba Baba buy. If the Yankees won, we wouldn't have said shit about red sox fans. It's like the fuck you wouldn't the fuck you wouldn't, I remember when you want them and what you said I was there. I don't know what you guys are talking about. You guys through bear in the face of one of our relievers this year. It's stop acting like you're not face to face. So anyways, this was the day after, I'm not going to say who this person is, but he's a very emotional person and I love him. And I've done his podcast and he's done my podcast and he's one of the funniest people I know. I love this guy, but he's out of his fucking mind.

Speaker 1:          00:19:18       He sends me a text at 12:34 PM he writes, you know Pedro Martinez Sucks. Big Fat Elephant Cox still, he's still suck and elephant dicks. So I write back, thanks so-and-so. Exclamation point. God bless, exclamation point, right? And he just keeps going. He goes, he doesn't care. He doesn't clean them either. He just sucks. Elephant Cock only person still rocking a Jheri curl. So then I write back the number 11 and he's still in the middle of his rent. He goes, I'm a bad guy now cause he's, cause he's still sucks cock. And then he takes the bait and he goes 11 what? And I go championships, five super bowls, four world series, one NBA title one Stanley Cup, 1417 years. You'll tell your grandchildren about it and then he just writes back. You've changed man.

Speaker 1:          00:20:13       And then he continues. Whatever, man, you didn't bring back that animal Schilling and his fake bloody socks. And I just never responded. So I don't under, I don't, I'm, I'm done near you. Don't understand it. Like I'm going to have relapses. Like when you bait me two times in the face, right? That might send me back, but I am done with this shit. You just rolled your eyes. You know what it is near, you know, you know, in your heart of hearts, if I fucking beat this thing, you got nothing on me. I work hard and make a great living. I mean,

Speaker 5:          00:33:04       be there for Madison Square Garden. I know it's going to be amazing because the form was literally the best show I've ever seen. You do. And I've known you for years isn't I'd like to count. Yep. Um, now it's like the best show I've ever seen. You do and I've seen you do like amazing shows. But that forum one was like, even when I talk to people about it now, they'll just say it just from the moment we walked in the door like that, it's just the whole energy was electric and I think the crowd was really excited. You had a great crowd that night. Like it was just, yeah, the crowd was, it was really, really, yeah. It was just great energy. And like Joe and dean were bulges on their a game. Like it was just

Speaker 1:          00:33:43       it, well Joe and dean walked out there like they were doing a spot at the store, which is like how you have to be, right? Yeah, no, they just went out there and they were just like, Hey, what's up? And just, yeah, when I was like, all right, well let or intimidated by the venue, I guess. If they're not nervous, why should I be? No, I'm very, uh, yeah, no, it's a humbling experience in go out day, just like, I don't know if I ever get to do this again. So I'm playing.

Speaker 5:          00:34:08       Yes. That's a, that's like your new thing now is that you play the drums and, and do then jam and then either they like, I feel like you shake all the nerves out of you by doing it.

Speaker 1:          00:34:19       Yeah. You just go, why don't you just make a ton of noise? Yeah. I did that at the garden and Boston. I'm going to do what an MSG again and a that the form too. Yup. Oh, I played for like almost three hours. My shoulder was killing me. That's so great that they let you do that though. Yeah. Well at first I thought that they would think that, yeah. Why? What does this asshole doing that, but then it's like this bands in there all the time. 200 and up. Yeah. And I think that they get a kick out of the fact that, uh, that we're acting like we won a radio contest rather than coming in. They're like, oh, another arena. Right? Yeah. We come and they're like, [inaudible] can't believe I'm here. I mean, that's all we do. I saw Queens of the stone age here that just, I just freak out the whole time. I'm there.

Speaker 5:          00:35:05       Wait, are we not going to talk about the party yesterday?

Speaker 1:          00:35:09       Oh, how much you crushed that frigging party? We had a, the second annual kid, Halloween baby Halloween, maybe Halloween, maybe Halloween party. You know how nightclubs are 21 and over. This is, this was two years and under and under that one.

Speaker 5:          00:35:26       It was adorable. First of all, but now it was, it was really good.

Speaker 1:          00:35:30       The one little kid dressed like a hedgehog. Oh my God. The two little kids dress like hedgehogs. There was two hedgehogs at the party. I know. I thought that it was gonna be friction. Um, snoopy, the, the one family, one family came dressed as Charlie Brown and Lucy. That was the parents. And then snoopy was the baby. Oh my God. It's so cute. There. We had the tires, the tires. I love the tires that parents showed up and just their, their bathrobes and pajamas and they kid. Oh, someone who's pajamas. Uh, it was a very clever idea. It was you went out and got us all skeleton costume. Oh my God, wait, can we talk about your skeleton cuts? My skeleton slash gimp outfit that you got me. It was a giant one. Z with feet and hands. I didn't realize that there was like gloves and feeding. It wasn't clubs. It was all sewed into it. There was no option, there was no option. Then we found out later on that night that there was actually like the ski mass thing that you were supposed to put over your head. Like are you serious? It was. It was definitely freaky. Yes. And then you had the most craziest joke ever.

Speaker 1:          00:36:39       Yeah. Last night I go, Jesus Christ, they go, there was a fucking ski mask thing with that and then you laugh, you said put that on and fuck me. And I was even a even that made me uncomfortable. And I know you were fucking joking obviously, but I was like Jesus Christ Nia.

Speaker 5:          00:36:59       Cause it literally looked like it again. Put it over your head. And it was, I guess

Speaker 1:          00:37:06       skeleton. The only thing that was missing was the zipper mouth. So offline. So scary. Yeah. That was a one and done or put that on. Fuck me. Unbelievable. Oh my God.

Speaker 5:          00:37:21       Horrible. But no, that was um, that was a fun time. Thank you so much for your help with that. All right, great. Okay. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37:46       Yeah, you were supposed to be working right now. He's supposed to be this training people and you're sitting there looking more like a, they took vacations together.

Speaker 5:          00:37:58       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:37:58       All right. No, but the uh, the caterers were amazing. All the food was amazing and thank you Twitter for your ear playlist suggestions. I think people on Twitter, but I want to thank you guys again. You crushed it. So a lot of good ideas. You had all this great music and then all of a sudden it would just go into like thriller Michael Jackson and everybody get all psyched at that. And then it'd be something that would be like baby Shaq, Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee baby should, I was trying to do that. Does that song go once that's in your head, you're done.

Speaker 5:          00:38:26       It's done. It's done. And I had three different versions of, are you seeing areas?

You didn't even hit, you didn't even know what the song was until I played it. So how do you know how it goes? How's it go then? I don't remember, but it doesn't go like that. Yeah. Well there's, there's a few different versions. There's a slower one that goes baby

Speaker 6:          00:38:59       shock Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo do doo baby sharp dude, dude, dude, that's the one baby shower. Maybe Shark Dude. Dude, dude,

And then I heard BB and then there's an RMB version one that I play at the party as well I think is firing on all cylinder. Oh they're a spicy Margarita. Has two of those bad boys. All kinds of delicious food. We had like the toys and the games out for the kids. Yeah, it was a good time. It was a good time. Yeah. And now it's over. No, it's so far right now I have to go return all those tables and chairs. How cute with the little kid chairs. Oh, and they actually sat in them and they were coloring and putting stickers on construction paper. It was so cute.

Speaker 1:          00:40:03       I like the little kids at that age. Like they just like there'll be two little kids just looking at each other and another kid just runs up super fast. And then just stops and then he'd just stare at each other and then they all just run to go to something.

Speaker 5:          00:40:16       You know, our, um, our neighbor texted me and she was asking how the party was, she has older kids and she was like, you probably had a much more controlled situation cause her kids are older and she's like, when they get older, once it's like foreign ops, she's like, every party is completely insane because it's, their energy is all over the place anyway. And then they have candy and she was like, please enjoy like the kind of controlled atmosphere that you have with this age group. But I was like, no, I know. That's why I wanted to keep it to one under cause they're just insane. Right? Like don't you think?

Speaker 1:          00:40:52       Uh, no, I wasn't aware of any of this storm front. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:40:55       Well apparently, well, whatever I'm going to comment on.

Speaker 7:          00:41:41       Dionne.

Speaker 1:          00:42:26       I never one of those ones do it. If I could go back in time. I've worked in so many kitchens. I've never seen so many jail bird. I've never seen him get over and fucking wash some. I've never, we're going to get you. I've never seen so many fat men do so much cooking. It's like, Dude, oh, this doesn't make any fucking say no. I've told you this story. I got a classic one, our manager, right? The manager where I worked. Uh, I was a busboy, so I used to have to mop up around the oyster bar and they had like the black and white towels like the old improv's used to have. Right. So I'm mopping that up and I'll always be a fucking mess. Yeah. And then I would have to mop up and clean the men's room and the women's room and a women's room always look like, you know, like the Yankees just won the world series. It was just like toilet paper and ticker tape all over the whatever. It was just, it was a fucking mess in that guys who was just a pissed all over the place. So I go in there to clean the bathroom and my manager is in there. He's got the water on full blast and he's brushing his teeth while puking. Swear to God he's prejudice, maybe go like,

Speaker 8:          00:43:26       oh wow.

Speaker 1:          00:43:28       And he had the water and keep going and then he just kept brushing his teeth and I was sitting there, I didn't know what to do.

Speaker 8:          00:43:32       Aw. They just

Speaker 1:          00:43:34       kept brushing his fucking teeth and then he just saw it and then he played it off going like, ah, you know, it goes brushing the teeth sometimes it makes me gag and I'm thinking about though, fucking jam the toothbrush down your throat, your fucking whore. And it wasn't till I was only 19 right. So what does it until years later that I was like, oh, he was fucking hung over. He just was fucking puke it up alcohol and he was probably standing there puking. Then I came in and then he was just trying to act like he was brushing his teeth. Like I wasn't going to notice that he was fucking puking, but I was standing there and go over the brush. Gee, that guy was stuck. I was so funny. I remember he'd go for it, believe it or not, he ends up getting fired.

Speaker 1:          00:44:16       Right? He gives to, yeah, he gets fired and then he gets a job managing another restaurant as they all do. Yeah. You walked out onto the floor and an eight ball fell out of your pocket, you're fired. And then like they won't even go across town. They'd be across the fucking, like the, the, the Strip mall. So this guy ends up getting another job, making way more money and I swear to God, he showed up like a week later with his new job, he had bought a brand new car and he came over to peacock, like we gave a fuck and he pulled up with some white Subaru sports cars. I can't even know what the fuck he had. And he just kicked can, he just was sitting there at the fucking bar with this cat, ate the canary smile on his face. I said, hey man, how you doing? I said, hey, is that your karate? He's like, yeah, I want to drive it. And he slid the keys across the barge. Jesus Christ. Yeah. I swear to God. It was like I was in road house. The Dude restaurant workers are like dirty cops. They just get shuffled off. Oh, you dirty fucking precinct. Oh yeah. No, you're there once you're in your end, dude. It doesn't matter.

There was no explanation. Actually there wasn't an explanation, but it's too fucking boring to get into. Um, I use the wrong punctuation. Some sort of quotes when I put the money more. No, I used an Asterick, you know, little Barry bonds, little Sammy Sosa, little Mark McGuire, little Roger Maris action when I went to go post it and then they just, they just took me off, you know, and like some mean little seventh grade girl, they just refuse to talk to me. We were BFFs and it was fucking over and there was no reason, complete overreaction. So for the last fucking 35 days is so we were like, dude, what the fuck are, you know, I thought we were friends.

I'm also a freaking out cause I have a ton of shit that I have to do today. So to be honest with you guys, after this wonderful Intro, I'm just here to tell you I really don't have time for you fuckers this week. What are you think about that?

Speaker 9:          00:49:03       Um, all right, what are we going to talk about this week? Let's, let's, let's open the page. Is Open the page Nia closing the door cause I'm being too loud.

Speaker 9:          00:50:01       Still Putting Grecian formula and his beard. God bless them. Um, not Jesus. Why did I sing that stupid fucking song? I forgot what the hell was going to talk about. Let's go back. Let's try to go back into the memory bank. I was in Saint Louis this week and uh, I did a benefit for the children, John Carney carnies kids. I did that a Friday night, Saturday night. I did the funny bone two shows that the funny bone. I want to thank everybody who showed up at a wonderful time out there. And um, if you guys want to go back in time and reach back into a little bit of Americana that you feel was lost during the last 20 years of horrific moves, you know, I got an idea. Let's come up with Nafta. Let's stand all the manufacturing out of this fucking country. And then someday when we want a fact we got to compete with sweatshop labor.

Speaker 9:          00:50:55       Does that sound like good idea? I think that's a good fucking idea. I have an idea. Let's have a war. Fuck. Let's have two wars at the same fucking tab. How are we going to pay for it? Borrow money from China. That sounds good to Mei. Why am I blaming it on southerners? I Dunno why. I Dunno. Why? Because the last two guys were from Arkansas and then the other guy was from Texas. You know La. You realize before Obama, the last two presidents should have been on the food network or one of those barbecue offs. You know I'm trying to compete. Who has the best fucking sauce? Mine's vinegar based and his, his is more molasses. Okay. That's that sweet stuff. You put that sweet stuff phone cause you don't know how to cook a good piece mate. You're not a good, you know how to cook.

Speaker 9:          00:51:44       Good Pace. Me. You don't need go desk fleets up equally. Little bit of vinegar. Ireland. I come from the foot hills North Carolina we use, we use vinegar. Sorry. He started using that, then that sweet stuff he talks about Kansas City. Um, anyway, so if you want to, if you want to reach back into America a little bit and just a, if you want to, if you have children and you want them to see what this country used to be like back in the day when you could eat cheeseburgers and French fries and a fucking drink it God damn chocolate malt and somehow not end up being a fat fuck because there wasn't all these God damn preservatives in it. Right? Isn't that what it makes you fat? How can I make people used to eat like no one knew shit about nutrition in the 1950s yet everybody kind of seemed like they weren't in shape.

Speaker 9:          00:52:33       You know, granted they were fucking openly racist and uh, grabbing their secretaries ass every five seconds, but they were in much better shape. If you want to go back into time, go to Saint Louis because St Louis is one of the few places I have been to and the last eight years that you can still smoke in comedy clubs and you could smoke in bars and people just light up. And I, and I was amazed by it, you know, even though I kind of remembered that you hadn't been there in five years, but, uh, there's just certain states they just, they just, um, they don't give a shit. Like when they see the surgeon general come on TV, they just like, I don't recognize that uniform. He ain't no fucking Americans. So, uh, they completely ignored. So if you want to go back in time with your child, you know, if you're tired of reminiscing with your adolescent son or daughter about how I used to be able to go in a bar and have a drink and a smoke, why not live it?

Speaker 9:          00:53:30       Why not go to Saint Louis? I think that they should add that to their tourist attractions right up there with the, uh, with the arch, the gateway to the west, so to speak. I actually hung around for an extra day yesterday and I went to the, uh, the Saint Louis Rams game first. The, uh, the, uh, the Carolina Panthers and is boring as part of the game was, it was kind of exciting to watch a team that you could tell was going to be fucking good. And about a year or two, the ramps, remember you heard it first, November 1st, 2010, right here at Sam Bradford I think is the real fucking deal. Guys. Cool as a cucumber. He's driving the damn team down the field, even though his top three receivers are all out for the season. He was throwing it to white guys all day long. That's how many injuries they have on that team.

Speaker 9:          00:54:28       They're all the way down to the white receivers people. And I know what you're going to say. What about Wes? Welcome. All right, Wes Welker, that white dude who played for Denver, there's not a lot, you know, but slowly but surely, I don't know if you've noticed the white guy is, is, is making a little bit of inroads back into, into some, uh, what do they call those positions? Performance or a speed positions. You know, there's a couple of white running backs. Did you ever think you're going to see that again? I mean, I couldn't believe it. I'm in Saint Louis. People are smoking within structures and there's a white quarterback thrown to a white wide receiver. It was unbelievable. It was, I was waiting for Larry Zonker to come walking out on the field with that little fucking, you know, the two bars across his face. And then that one, the, the, the, the, the horseshoe he had on top.

Speaker 9:          00:55:22       That's why I don't fucking respect the God damn. 72 dolphins. They had two white running backs. Okay. And you go, oh, we went undefeated. Did Ya? Who'd you play in the third week? Some group of people from the fucking why MCA? You fucking pricks. What'd you have? 14 you've 40. I need to do is win 14 fucking games. 14 game season. You cheap bastards. Oh God. That fucking loss to the giant still hurts. But you know what feels good watching the Goddamn jets lose nine to nothing. I love it. I love it. And here are the Patriots are right in a rebuilding fucking year. We've got a bunch of God damn kids play in defense. We Trade Randy Moss, all these asshole Jeff fans a fucking go. Oh with the Patriots. Fucking quit with a nervous. They could be the judge. The today picked up Dave. That's what a great coach bill Belicheck is. All right, you fucking assholes. How do you like that? Six and one with a bunch of children playing defense. Six and one best record in the NFL. I don't know how the fuck we did it.

Speaker 9:          00:56:30       I got it. I got to admit I'm not gonna. I'm not going to believe that we're actually going to do something. And unless we, we beat the Steelers and, uh, we play the Steelers in the jets and a, even if we go one on one, if we're competitive, then I'm, I'm going to get excited. But, uh, you know, I dunno with our defense at this point is halfway to be in good, I feel, but I'm, I'm telling you don't sleep on the fucking rams. I should have bet those sons of bitches I show I had no idea what was going on down there in Saint Louis. And they got that maniac. Uh, the fuck is his name, number 55. That kid from Ohio State, God damn it, what the hell was his name? Something itis. Dad's like a professional wrestler. He went in and he got a sack and he did the fucking Hulk Hogan, you know, putting his cup in his ear and then he did the flex and then I was great.

Speaker 9:          00:57:27       It was fucking great. I Dunno what the jets lost. I'm so fucking excited. Cause all those assholes and you know, it's funny, I didn't get one goddamn fucking email from any of those goddamn jet fans who've been giving me shit all these weeks. You know, fucking idiots. They're not idiots. You know what they are? They're hopeful. Sons of bitches, they have a one in 40 years. They get excited about little things like drafting fucking Mark Sanchez, Sanchez. You know what's going to be the end of the jet season if one of your unbelievably awesome offensive lineman goes down with an injury that fucking goddamn mediocre overrated jackass. Overrated. This week, mark fucking Sanchez, that gay managing jackass. Good Lord fucking sit behind the Goddamn Berlin Wall. You could have fucking rex Grossman in there and he could throw for 180 yards. No picks. You're not impressing me. Speaking to that man, I had the fucking reds.

Speaker 9:          00:58:31       I got my ass handed to me yesterday. Thank God I picked the dolphins, the dolphins getting one and Cincinnati and a, I love the dolphins. I loved them. They got that fucking defense and the Bengals have been sputtering all fucking year. So I said, fuck it. I'll take death. So I won that one. Then I had the Redskins, Donovan McNabb going into play the lines, but typical me, I don't read up on sports. I didn't know that their quarterback was coming back for the lines. I don't even know what his fucking name is. Stafford, something like that. I had no fucking idea. And then when, when the whole game's on the line, including my fucking money, you take Donovan McNabb out and you put in Rex Grossman, the guide, the cult secretly fucking paid off the bears to be quarterback. So Peyton manning could finally get his fucking ring after they went into the Goddamn rule book and change the rules so Peyton could fucking actually beat the patriots in the fucking playoffs, playoffs and whatever.

Speaker 9:          00:59:30       And I'm just talking shit. I actually took the colts tonight. As much as I hate it, I'm going to have to fucking root for the colts because I could go up to games on Paul Versey who almost went all in for last week. Missed. I know sports. Paul Versey, are you listening? He went one in three yesterday and I uh, I've got one or two, but I have, I have the colts tonight. Loving them, loving them to avenge their loss to the Houston Texans. I don't even know what the fucking spread is cause I don't give a shit. I really don't give a shit. I just like pissing people off. Let's get, let's get home with the podcast. Um, it is November 1st everybody. And um, did you guys all have a nice Halloween? Did you have a nice Halloween? Do, did Brett Farve die yesterday? Did you guys see that shit? Jesus Christ, he looked like somebody kicked him in the balls from behind.

Speaker 9:          01:00:26       The way he was laying there with his fucking knees up to his dealer. He was going to get an enema. It's like, what are you doing to do dude? You own every fucking record out there. Good and bad. What are you going for? The mediocre ones now I don't understand this guy. It's just, just, just walk away. I don't like how he's patting himself on the back too. You know, I got hit in a, that's a hit that, you know, I don't think a lot of people would've got up from, but you know, I had on some wrangler underwear and I just said, fuck it. He is a tough son of a bitch. But you know, I don't know what he's trying this, his wife hate him at this point. Um, yeah, keep playing. I don't give a shit show and you dick to everybody.

Speaker 9:          01:01:09       Fuck you. Um, oh, here's something that I actually, I never even addressed. All right. Brett said that, that annoyed me and Colby Bryan a couple months ago when Lebron was doing his big decision thing, when he finally decided to go to Miami, Coby made this statement, I forget if I brought this up. They ask Coby if he would have done the same thing and he goes, no, I wouldn't. I would've stayed. And a, I thought that was kind of Kentucky. It's like, well that's easy for you to say when you fucking play for the Lakers and they bring all the free agents to you. You know, there's been no reason for you to fucking leave your whole fucking career. They've been bringing you guys, you were playing in Cleveland. You would have left Colby. You almost left because you didn't like Shaq either. He goes through, I go, I'm sick of when it championships.

Speaker 9:          01:02:06       Um, it's all fucking career. They brought you Shaq, Dennis Rodman, Phil Jackson, Karl Malone, Gary Payton, Robert Henri, [inaudible], Saul, fucking that dude who choked the people that I had off. I don't watch fucking basketball. Who's that guy there? A Jesus Christ. So he, he's still a bit of bottom. I say his name. Every God damn night teams. Jermaine O'Neal slid across the floor, punch that guy in the face. Ah, whatever the fuck his name is. Latrelle fucking third cousin. They've brought you a list. Fucking free agencies. Your entire Goddamn Korea. I thought that was a real country move for someone who, who is allegedly Lebron's friend. But how funny is it watching, uh, Lebron's people sitting there trying to do damage control with these stupid ass fucking commercials? Trying to get people to a, I don't know what changed their opinion about him. I mean, I could really give a shit. It's just like, just fucking go play basketball.

Speaker 9:          01:03:06       I don't give a fuck. What would I do that? Well, what would I, what would I do? I would, I would not even be able to make it on my eighth grade basketball team if I remember correctly. So I, I don't know what I would do. Lebron. I haven't had to make decisions like anywhere near that level. I don't care. I don't care about you. And yet, talcum powder and your little fucking ritual. I could give a shit. Just fucking go out and entertain me. I don't need you to try to Redo your fucking image, you know? I don't know. So what, you can make $100 billion. Don't you have enough? Isn't it enough? You get free sneakers? I don't even know what I'm talking about people. I'm just fucking thinking about all the shit I have to do for the rest of the day. That's what I'm doing in this podcast right now.

Speaker 9:          01:03:53       I'm cleaning the dirt out of my keyboard and, uh, speaking in what, you know, what I'm dying to do, I'm dying to fucking replace some of the tile in my bathroom. You know, this is the latest thing I'm obsessed with. I'm obsessed with learning how to fix shit around the house because I'm going to buy a house and I'll be fucked if I'm going to pay some fucking mouth breathe in jackass with Dickies hanging off his goddamn ass to come in there and overcharged me for parts cause he wants to have a fucking kegger that weekend, you know? So if you want to learn how to do shit right, I eat this. You do it. You do it in the apartment that you're living in. See, like my dog clawed up some of the, uh, some of the trim around the door and a man, it's a fucking joke.

Speaker 9:          01:04:47       I'm looking at it going, this is this, this can't be this fucking difficult. I'd go down to home depot, they got precut shit down there, so all I gotta do is get the shit that's the same fucking size. I trim it off the bottom, make sure it fits. Slap it on there. Right. Who cares if I fuck up? It's not my place. It's all a little bit of pain over. Nobody's going to notice. My landlord doesn't listen to this podcast, does he? No. Seriously. I want to. I want to learn how to fucking do that. Some of that shit already know how to take a toilet out. Can take the whole fucking thing apart. I know how to take a fucking sink out now. I don't know how to do that shit. I just watched a couple youtube videos, but it gave me confidence. I'm confident with the sink that you, you fucking set down into the counter.

Speaker 9:          01:05:38       That one that you got to go underneath with. I don't know how that's when you're dealing with gravity. I like the one that sits down in it. You can just unhook everything and then figure out how to hook it back up later. You know you go to turn on the hot water and all of a sudden the garbage disposal goes on in the fucking kitchen. I want to learn how to do that shit, but, uh, I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. All right, let's, let's, let's, let's get to some youtube videos of the week people, shall we, um, first one and these are all going to be, uh, on the, uh, the man podcast.com, the official website of the Monday morning podcast that is back on iTunes as you heard earlier with my horrible singing. Um, all right. Here, they all are in, these aren't, these aren't even youtube videos.

Speaker 9:          01:06:22       These are videos that I got everywhere, but youtube because a, everybody's on Youtube, so I'm trying to go a little bit outside the box with some of the shit that people send me. Um, this is one. Um, ah, shit, I didn't know what the fuck to call it. Just go to the [inaudible] podcast.com and check this one out. Um, a buddy of mine stand up, comedian, uh, Rob Cantrell, fucking hilarious. Really original guy. Um, comedian and I think, um, I think it was the first season of last comic standing he was on, that's the first time I saw him. And I was like, I like this dude because he doesn't seem like he's trying to win the competition as much as he's trying to give these people some quality stand up. And then you had the other guy fucking going around with the Goddamn Ginsu Sorge fucking spinning it around.

Speaker 9:          01:07:10       So of course America votes for him. Right? That's how they do it. Gimme some shiny shit. That's what I'm voting for. Um, he did a thing about why pot should be legalized in this country. He made a great fucking video that's supposed to, uh, it's supposed to be like the beginning of that movie patent. Um, check that one out. Uh, there's another one, a dude with Nub, k Kaos another guy. It's a guy with a, yeah, he has only one arm and then he has part of another arm and he fucking, he's in a, I don't know what to do and Muay Thai and he movie knocks the other guy's fucking ass down out of the camp canvas. Um, next one is a touch my body karaoke fail, uh, with some English subtitles, even though the guy's singing in English. And the last one actually comes from the dude who runs the EMM podcast, who if you want to really, if you want some advice on gambling, this is the guy he's on a fucking hot streak, a crazy racist in coffee shop.

Speaker 9:          01:08:17       Starts yelling at Mexican dude. So there you go. There's your videos that you can watch while you're at work or working out or whatever. Um, I got a lot of emails last week from me imitating those dudes on the corner, so called white man. That shit. Remember that last week? Um, somebody said a then pression of the street preacher with the bad pa was spot on and fucking hilarious. There's a guy shouting in Spanish into a blown out PA on the weekends in my neighborhood, there's two churches. Uh, there's two churches on every block. And even the immigrants, immigrants, resonance, even the immigrant residents, these, this all misspelled here. Immigrant residents grimace and give him dirty looks. How do you say, quit shouting and fix your levels in Spanish?

Speaker 9:          01:09:12       That is a reoccurring thing that I have found straight across the board. When people go out, I don't give a fuck black, white, Latino, Asian. I don't give a shit. They never have the levels correct in their PA. I think there's so passionate about their politics that they never really, uh, I don't know. And it's such a grass roots actually, when you think about it, do you really think Obama knows how to use a mixer? How old is he? Yeah, he probably doesn't. He's like fucking, I don't even know how old the guys I have not paid attention to politics in.

Speaker 9:          01:09:51       I don't even know when. I have no fucking idea when I just, I want, whenever I stopped talking about conspiracy theory theory cause I just got so depressed about all of the shit, um, you know, started reading up on banking. Like here's a, here's something interesting here. I, this is one way I kind of see both sides of this. This guy sent me this letter. He said about bill, listen to this shit. So my wife and I are looking at buying a house. Uh, like you, I am not the biggest fan of banks. So instead of putting all my money in a savings account, I had been saving some cash on the side and keeping it in my dresser. And there's a smart place to put it. Why don't you stick it in the mattress? There's another, a place you know, through, if you ever had that money stolen by somebody breaking into your house, that burglars should have been dressed up in the black and white stripe shirt with the, uh, uh, lone ranger.

Speaker 9:          01:10:44       I'm a fucking a bank robber. A mask. Maybe. Maybe you just saying you put it in your dresser, your actually put it somewhere else. You know, you gotta Cook. You gotta be a little more creative than that. Uh, anyways, he says, well, when my wife talked to the bank about getting alone, they asked us our incomes, how much money we saved and how we would be paying our down payment. My wife sold in about our savings and everything was fine. She then told them that I had cash saved up on the side. They immediately stopped her and said that the cash could not be used unless there was an explanation for how I got it and a paper trail to back it up. The banks look at your financial history bank statements and your spending habits to determine if you really could save however much cash you actually have.

Speaker 9:          01:11:30       A, since some of my money is cash, I've won from poker games and old stuff. I sold on craigslist, craigslist. I have no paper trail for it. The only way that I can now use it for our house is to get my parents to lie and write a note explaining to the bank that they gave me the money as a gift and I'm not sure if that will work because I don't know if they will check my parents bank risk records to confirm that the whole policy is bullshit. I understand that the bank's fucked up and had to foreclose on a lot of people and they want to make sure that I'm not paying for a house with drug money, but come on. This essentially means that if I'm walking down the street and find $20,000 in cash in an alley, take it and try to use it as a down payment.

Speaker 9:          01:12:10       The banks won't let me because there's no record of how I got it. This whole ordeal really pisses me off and I'm pretty sure it goes back to what you're trying to say about how the government is trying to phase out cash money. Uh, no, that doesn't, that's, that's one of those double standard things that they do where you have to produce all this paper trail stuff to show that you're not a piece of shit. But they, on the other hand, the Federal Reserve I'm talking about, um, they've never been audited and we gave them $1 trillion bail out money and it just disappeared in the thin air. They can't say who got it or where it went and they're not being audited. But you, on the other hand, you know, you sell an old skateboard and your original fucking playstation, you win some money down the street and a poker, you know, a poker tournament, none of that Shit.

Speaker 9:          01:13:01       You know, you're supposed to pay taxes on all of that shit. And if you found 20 grand coming down the street, what you're supposed to do, you're supposed to report it, bring it down to the police station. Okay. And hope that those fucking guys don't dip into it. And I guess after a certain amount of days, uh, it legally becomes yours, but then you have to pay taxes on it and all that bit, all that shit. And all after the fees you probably left with anywhere from eight to 10 grand. That's how your legally supposed to do it. And what's annoying to me is that you and I are up. We're, we're held to those legal fucking standards, but banks are not. Banks are supposed to be watching our money, keeping it safe. And they, for basically, I don't know how many goddamn years we're loaning it out to fucking homeless people given six figure loans to them.

Speaker 9:          01:13:52       And Lo and behold, when these fucking people defaulted on their God damn loans and the whole thing went into the shitter, the government fucking bails them out. They're like, we're too big to fail. They fucking bail him out. They keep the bail out money and now they added all these countries surcharges to your, your account in my account. So yeah, that's, I dunno, this is what you, this is what you do with your case. If you have cash on the side, uh, use it for shit that you can actually pay for in cash, I guess army or save it in case your bank ever goes, uh, goes belly up and there's a run on your bank. You won't be sitting there with your pockets turned inside out going, can I at least have some yogurt? But yeah, it is practically, um, the more you read about banking, you'll, you'll start to understand why corporations and and in, in or super rich, like you know, the entrepreneurs, why these guys have offshore accounts and all that type of shit. Because these guys basically, I think read up on banking, which you would have, do you read up on the tax laws and you see how the whole game is played. You see who gets pink penalized and who doesn't and you start thinking Jesus is fucking ridiculous. So let me get this straight. When I get to this level of wealth, all of a sudden, um, rules don't apply to me.

Speaker 9:          01:15:16       Okay, well let me work my ass off to get to that level. Oh wait, I can't cause they keep taxing the shit out of me. Oh, I get it. I got to do some, there will be bloodshed. I mean, I'm really overly simple simplifying the whole fucking thing, but that's basically how it goes down. I mean, that bank is not going to take that risk on you. You know, I got some cash on the side that's actually good banking. You can't have somebody just come in and be like a, hey listen, I got to be really stereotypical. Now I'm going to be Italian. I already shit on fucking southerners. Why not do a, an Italian stereotype? A, I got, I got, I got good credit and I got, did I get this 50 grand in this side? Where did I get it? A why don't you let me worry about that.

Speaker 9:          01:15:57       All right. You know, I, I, you know, somebody else actually sent me something, uh, about banks here. Hang on one second. Let me read this and annoying more people actually majored in economics or economics. However the fuck you say it. Uh, here we go. Here we go. Let me read up on this shit here. You guys getting bored with this shit? Well, I don't give a fuck. All right. I do give a fuck, but I didn't care. I wouldn't be asking, but I'm going to continue. Hey, bill, I've been thinking some about something you said about taxes on your podcast. It was about you trying to build, build up a pile of cash and how the government governments hitting you up for tax money at every opportunity. Yeah, that's my thing. I'm trying not to put money in the stock market. I'm just trying to stick it in the bank or whatever, and they just tax the living shit out of me.

Speaker 9:          01:16:50       But if I stick it on the crap table, right, which the fucking stock market is, if I throw it in there, then they have no problem with it, then all of a sudden they give me a tax break. Hey, get over here and play the fucking game. Oh. Um, so anyways, uh, that's anyway, let me get back to this. Uh, they hit you up for tax money for every opportunity, but that there are rich fucks out there who've already got there. So they don't want to get, they don't want anyone to get rich after them. There really is something to that. Yeah, they got it. They got it. They have to keep you did, they can't have people making fucking money and actually being able to keep it because if, if they do, then nobody would work. We would just fucking kick back and relax and maybe you have a chance to enjoy ourselves.

Speaker 9:          01:17:43       Maybe sit by his stream in the Lotus position or whatever the fuck it is you want to do. They want you to run on the wheel until you're fucking drooling. And then they want whoever you created to then take care of you in a nursing home. And then if you can't, they just want you to die. Um, I, uh, somebody, okay, I tweet, I twigged I didn't know what that means. I twigged onto this about a year ago when I was having a discussion with a friend about progressive income tax, he seemed to think that it takes from the rich to give to the poor. And the progressive income tax is anticapitalists. It's not though, because I don't know what the fuck any of this means here. Because earned income tax are always higher than rates on dividends and capital gains income. Let me, I get there, I can read that much slower because earned income tax rates are higher than rates on dividends and capital gains income.

Speaker 9:          01:18:37       Okay? So basically money that you already have that's being invested, the tax rate is lower than someone who is out there earning the nonworking heir or heiress who survives on dividends and capital gains from a family fortune like a Paris Hilton. Uh, their income tax is on a much lower percentage than a working person with an equivalent income. So basically if you're sitting around in your ass, you're some fucking luck. Lucky rich kid. The money that you're, that you basically inherited, that you are earning off of the sh the, there will be blood great grandfather that you had. The tax rate will be lesser for the Paris Hilton Kid than someone like me if I could earn, if I was earning that same amount of money. Does that make sense? Make sense to me? Um, I hope I explained that in a way you understand it. All right. The system punishes, uh, work and reward rewards, ownership with tax rates that provide incentives for one kind of economic activity over another.

Speaker 9:          01:19:36       I base this on my experience with my Canadian. This guy broke up with my book, Canadian system and before I emailed you, I had to use Wikipedia, confirm to confirm that the u s system works pretty much the same way. And right there this entire email gets thrown out the window. Wikipedia, sir, what are you fucking me? Maybe it does make sense on the podcast. Let's go with this Wikipedia information. The worst part of it is that by implication work is less valuable than capital. The woman making $8 an hour at Walmart is paying the same percentage of income tax as the Walmart airs pay on their divid dividends. A medical doctor however, pays more than twice as much and the doctor is patching up the sick and wounded. The incentives in the systems are all wrong. So you're basically saying the borderline, uh, poverty person and the rich people are paying the same amount of taxes in the guys in the middle may or getting the shit tax out of them. Yes, exactly. Exactly.

Speaker 9:          01:20:44       That is my fucking life. God Damn. And I have to hit pause here, people. I, I gotta I gotta blow my nose. Hang on a second. All right, I'm back. Sorry about that. You don't what happened to me? I was eating a bowl of wheat checks too fast and uh, I didn't chew up the wheat checks enough, so they went down, it was like swallowing, chewing tobacco and it got soda. Like there was just like a bunch of like, you know, it was in the back of my throat. So I was like, I did that. And it's, some of it went up into my nose, so it was actually rechecks one, I'm having a rough Monday. Univer starting your weed off. You weed out your week off with some week checks in your nose. We checks a healthy part of the checks family. I would tell you guys, I'm a big fan of the uh, check cereals. I like, we checks, I like corn checks. I don't like rice checks. You know what I mean? It's like a fucking bad movie. It's just weak. They're just, it's just a week cereal, you know? I don't like those cereals that are like, oh my God, milk. That's what, that's what rice checks does. It just fucking shit. It's a quitting cereal. You know, corn checks has some fight in them. Quick checks. I like the jets. We checks. I like the Patriots. We checks our course the strongest.

Speaker 9:          01:22:11       Eh, you green motherfuckers, you lost this week. How do you like dead nine to nothing. I love the overpaid for your fucking tickets and you're brand new. Fucking sublet an apartment with the that the giants own. You know what? They roll out a little bit of jet signage. Do you really think that you won't 50% of that? Do you really think that you sons of bitches, what was it like to go to that boring ass fucking game kick three nothing. J e t s what the fuck? Now the couple of fucking hours of boring football kick six nothing. J e t is what the fuck? I might kick nine nothing. Go home. Did the fireman cry this week? Oh, I love it. Overrated talking shit before the season even starts like you just won three super bowls in a row.

Speaker 9:          01:23:09       Underrated having your stomach stapled. Rex Ryan is getting better looking every fucking week. Son of a bitch kind of has a jaw line now, doesn't he? Um, all right. Just to be fair, um, I've got to make fun of Celtics fans. Uh, overrated. Channing overrated. When you're up by 11 with eight minutes left against the Miami Heat. Did you guys watch that game? Then all of a sudden they all stay started roaring back and all the felt Celtics fans just shut the fuck up. And then once the game was, was decided with 12 seconds left, they started chanting overrated again. That was a real fucking bitchy mood. That was real bitchy. I didn't, I did. I was embarrassed to be associated with that franchise. All right, who's the moron? Who's two? Started that chant. Um, all right. That was, if that was, it was just a quick little riff of underrated, overrated, underrated.

Speaker 9:          01:24:10       Having your own fucking jet airplane with a big bed in the back, in a giant seatbelt. You know, beautiful woman to sit on your Dick in a fucking ivy to put you to sleep. You just wake up in New York. That's all I want. That's all I want. You know, that's all I want out of this business. I don't need, I don't need much. I got to fly to New York people. I'm going to New York on a Tuesday night, take the red eye back to that motherfucker and I'm doing a benefit for the troops playing the beacon theater with a, believe it or not, this is, this is the lineup on this show and it's going to be been to three different bases in Iraq in three different bases in Afghanistan. Jon Stewart is hosting. Tony Bennett is a, I'm assuming he's singing. I don't think he's doing stand up.

Speaker 9:          01:25:01       Uh, Jerry Seinfeld, Bruce Springsteen, Joe, Mikael, myself, and I think a couple of other people. All I'm doing is eight minutes, but uh, I can't wait man. It's going to be a, well, I don't want, I don't want to do the flight, but it's going to be fucking awesome. That's Wednesday. I'm flying out. That's why I'm telling you I got all this shit to do today because I got to, uh, you know, I just landed here last night. I got to do the fucking podcast. I have an audition today. I'm pitching a fucking show today. I got to pay my fucking bills. It's the first of the month I got to do all that fucking horse shit and then I got to jump right back on a plane tomorrow. You know, it's one of those fucking weeks speaking to that dude, I flew out to Saint Louis last week and there was some woman who was clearing her throat like twice a minute from like I would guess about Utah to Jess into Kansas. Eh?

Speaker 9:          01:26:09       Hmm. Hmm. Okay. She had this exact same way of doing it. I swear to God. I have never prayed for my own plane to crash before, but that was one of those moments I didn't want it to crash. You know what? I was just fantasizing that like there was a crack in the fuselage [inaudible] that woman just got sucked out. So as I was fantasizing about, this is how fucking crazy I took it. I actually reached down and I tightened my seat belt and I mentally went over how to put that fucking mask on my face before I help the infant or child next to me.

Speaker 9:          01:26:50       Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I saw it, you know, it was really disgusting. No Way. She was clearing his throat. She was talking really loud on her cell phone. Just everything about her was annoying. And whenever I see a person like that, the first thing I do is I look for a wedding ring, you know? And when I don't see one, I th I think, thank God when I do see, see when I actually feel bad for the man or woman that is married to that, you know? Yeah. How could it just like, and actually I came up with like a philosophical question. You know that those dolts Sechi commercials, the most interesting man in the world. What do you think would happen? His, he has his one for the, uh, the pot smokers out there. All right. What do you think would happen if the most interesting man in the world met the most annoying woman on the planet?

Speaker 9:          01:27:41       Yeah. All right. I want you to know, I want you to tell me what you think would happen because I couldn't come up with an answer to that question. You know, he is the most interesting man in the world. Well, I would like you to meet this cunt. Who was sitting diagonally fucking behind me. Oh, speaking of that underrated fucking movie macgruber Jenny Buddy rented that. I don't know if you'd be happy if you paid to go see it at a theater, but fucking, you know, unless you have a silly sense of humor like me, cause I would enjoy that if I saw it in the theater. Look at me even when I try to compliment something I say in a dick way. I think this is a funny fucking movie, uh, with a couple of really insane monologues in it. And uh, not to ruin anything. Spoiler alert, spoiler alert. I had to bring this up. The last name of the bad guy in the movie is cunt.

Speaker 4:          01:28:36       Okay. Okay. Okay.

Speaker 9:          01:28:39       And I'm assuming it's spelt with a K K u n t, Z or something. But it's, you know, we got them, we have to get cunt. I Dunno, it's sophomore. It's fucking hilarious. It's one of those movies you want to watch with the female in the room cause she's just be killing. This is stupid. You know, you think this is funny. Oh right God, that's grouse. Which will just make it so much more funnier. Macgruber two thumbs up from me baby. All right. This podcast is all over the place. Let's move on to the next one. Uh, the advice section. Why you would ask me for advice. I don't know. Okay, here we go. I started listening to your podcasts about three months ago and I really like it. Thank you. I was inspired by a couple of your albums on iTunes. Thank you. Now if you ever hear me bitching about people fucking download shit, I'm not talking about you or being cheap cuts.

Speaker 9:          01:29:27       It's not you. A bump up the bulb. I love your comedy my whole life. And recently I sacked up and one on stage for a five minute spot for an open night open mic night at a local comedy club here in Portland, Portland. I was really impressed by the people that showed up. Many of them were talentless Dick Holes, but at least they have the guts to get on stage and for that they deserve some credit. Well thank you sir. Thank you for fucking extending that olive branch to them. Um, so I got up there in front of a whopping 15 people, uh, one of which who was my girlfriend and talk some shit. It was, I was pretty nervous, but my voice was steady and I was energetic, but most importantly I got people laughing. There you go. It's all you've got to do. It might not seem like much, but I, I had a high like no other.

Speaker 9:          01:30:20       I might stick with it. Basically I write down a few prompts. Now this isn't me people. I swear to God, I know I suck at reading, but just the way that some of this shit is written, I'm going to read this. Basically the way this guy wrote it are actually exactly the way he wrote it. I might stick with it. Basically I write down a few prompts out for stories and quips and go to town. I feel like open mic nights might be the only way to get some chops. Doing my bits for friends or two into a mirror doesn't have the same effect as a bunch of strangers. I'm gearing up to put some hard work into my act. I would like any tips on how you get you got your chops and how you practice your racked. All right. Couple things. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          01:31:03       You can't run it by your friends and do it in the mirror. Um, he could maybe say it a few times in a way, the club just so you can kind of get the flow of it. Uh, but yeah, the only way to do it is to do open mikes. So, uh, you know, I would do that, just do that. And I would also drop the attitude that people who are starting out are talentless Dickholtz than not. They're fucking, you know, if you saw me when I started out, you would have thought that this guy sucks because I did suck because I was brand new at it. So you don't want to do that. And for all, you know, the, those air quote talentless Dick Holes will someday be in a position in this fucking business where they could actually hook you up with something. So I can not stress how important it is to have good relationships with fellow comedians and everybody in this fucking business that you can.

Speaker 9:          01:31:54       I'm not saying that you take it to the point that you will. Acts actually allows somebody to walk all over you and treat you like shit. I'm not saying that, but don't walk around judging people bad. A fucking thing cut out on me again. God Damn it. I'm sorry. I've been, I'm putting together a new hour of comedy and I have a bunch of standup sets on my fucking recorder that I never ended up listening to. Something else, sir, that you might want to do if you're doing standup is to record yourself and listen to yourself so you can become better as a community. But the key is you got to listen to them. Anybody can record them and then just leave them on their fucking tape player or they're fucking digital recorder, whatever the hell you call this God damn thing. Um, yeah, that's what I would tell you that man, seriously, like you will be absolutely fucking amazed with, with the people that you think are going to do something and don't, and the people who you like and that person that and I don't think they're going to do shit and all of a sudden they're directing a movie.

Speaker 9:          01:32:51       They're the head writer on something. They create a show, uh, who knows what, you don't know what anybody's going to do. So, uh, yeah. You know, so I wouldn't walk around. I mean, I'm sure you're just writing that maybe to make me laugh or something, but I'm just putting that out there. All right. Because I've seen people act like con and then get treated accordingly by these people that they thought were a beneath them or whatever. It's, it's just the worst fucking thing that you can do in any, any in life in general. Treating someone else like a like shit or whatever. I don't know. I don't understand why people, it really makes your life a lot more difficult. And, uh, some day when you die, you know, like there's going to be the only people, only people at your funeral is going to be a, you know, the, the fucking to the guy who drives the truck and the guy who digs the hole or the hearse I should say.

Speaker 9:          01:33:56       Um, yeah. So that's, that's the advice I would give you. Keep doing the open mikes. Um, it keep writing stuff, tape record yourself and uh, you know, and then, and then be a good guy, be a good guy, but then, you know, be a good guy within reason. I mean, like I said, don't, don't hit, don't take shit from people. And then also try to try to be hanging with the people who seem the most motivated, most positive, that type of shit because you'll get caught up in it and a Yada, Yada, fucking Yada. That's basically it. So we're coming to the close here or the podcast and other kind of short one this week just because, uh, I do have so much shit to do here. Um, congratulations to the rangers in the giants for your first world series. A giants are up three games to one.

Speaker 9:          01:34:43       And I was getting nervous for giant fans. I actually, uh, I don't mind ranger or the giants. I have no problem with either one of them, but I was getting nervous for the giant fans when they were up two games to none. And then the rangers came back and won one game and I was like, yeah, God. And a lot of ways the giants are kind of like how the red sox were, except they're in the national league. You know how the Red Sox were back in the day where it was, not only do they not win, they have to rip your fucking hard out too. And uh, I don't know at the risk of pissing off ranger fans, I think the giant fans there, I think they've had, I think they've had about enough, I think it's time for the sports gods to let 'em up off the mat, give him a God damn world series and range of fans. Who you kidding? Who are you honestly fucking kitten. You know, you're all cowboy fans. You know, if the cowboys record was flipped right now and Tony Romo was living up to the potential, you know, you know, you wouldn't be selling out those world series games. Okay. Now I'm a fuck. You know, I like to range your sense fucking uh, who was that? Who was that fucking okay. Who is that guy buddy something or buddy bell that come here? Jackass who played third base. Um, he's not a jackass. It just sounds funny.

Speaker 9:          01:36:06       I'm trying to think of guys who played for the Rangers when I was growing up. The fuck was it? Somebody wrote something funny on the Internet about how 10 years ago when the Rangers signed a rod do a $200 million contract, he vowed to one day lead them to the world series and when he struck out looking on the New York Yankees, he finally delivered on that promise. Oh, Bill, he is such a cunt. I know. I am. Yeah, I am a client. Um, I actually watched the Patriots game and this, uh, this sports bar in Saint Louis and there was his fucking old guy in there who was basically, he had like, like nine sports buttons on his shirt. He had this little glow stick with them and he's one of those guys when he yelled, but it still wasn't loud.

Speaker 11:         01:37:01       It just kept going. Whoa. The Patriot. So when the Cheetahs, but we always went whoa.

Speaker 9:          01:37:07       And everybody was ignoring them. Anything the Patriots did was awesome. Like this guy's fucking shanks, this punt, right, right off the side of his foot for the patriot. The, as the ball is dropping to his foot, the guys go on.

Speaker 11:         01:37:20       Oh, what a kick.

Speaker 9:          01:37:22       Well, he's, he's pissing off everybody in the sports bar, but he's too fucking old to punch in the face. But this is what killed me about this guy was the people around me go, he fucking comes here every week. He's unbelievably annoying. And the worst thing is, is he has, he's fans of like six different football teams. Like, he's a fan of the Patriots, the bills and the dolphins. They're all in the same fucking division. And he's a fan of the Kansas City, uh, chiefs. So the bills played the chiefs, so no matter what, he cannot lose any. Just sits there the whole game. Whoa. What a throw. Oh, what an interception. Like he just wants to win the entire fucking time. Long story short, I had to take a picture with the guy because he started off cute. You know what a cute old man.

Speaker 9:          01:38:11       And then at one point, um, if I was, if I was drinking, I would have engaged with this dude it during the second quarter and been like, hey, how the fuck can you be fans of every fucking team? You old cunt. I would've done that. But fortunately I'm not drinking. So it took me until the fourth quarter where I started to give him shit. But then in the back of my head I was like, really, Bill, are you really going to get into it with this old guy? Um, but by the end of it, he was just kind of hilarious. So I actually took a picture with the guy and I'm going to have that uploaded onto the podcast.com. And, uh, what else do I got? I got a hyper few gigs here before I, before I sign off on this part of this podcast was an absolute clusterfuck.

Speaker 9:          01:38:49       I apologize. I had high hopes for it, but uh, you know, like a lot of things in life, it just doesn't work out. Um, all right, what do we got here? All right. I'm going to be at the funny bone in Columbus. This is really one of these podcasts that I would've stopped and restarted 10 minutes into it, but I just don't have the fucking time are right, Bill. We've heard your excuses. You have to mop your kitchen floor. Nobody gives a fuck. All right. I want to be at the, uh, the funny bone in Columbus, Ohio. Friday, Saturday, Sunday, November 12th, 13th and 14th. And I'm going to try to go to that Ohio state, Penn state game. That's my big, uh, I don't want to be bored shitless at the mall in Columbus move. Then I'm going to be making, uh, the following week I will be in Washington DC at the listener auditorium and that's on a Friday, November 19th.

Speaker 9:          01:39:39       On November 20th, I'll be at comics at Foxwoods in Connecticut. I get a lot of emails from people from Connecticut being like, Dude, when he come to fucking Connecticut, I'm going to be there. It's a beautiful new room. Uh, everybody's been raving about it. All the comedians who have performed there. So come on down, check out my new hour. And then finally, this is the one I need your help on. Look into your hearts. I am playing the Moore Theater in Seattle, Washington. All right, for those of you unfamiliar with the Moore Theater, it is a legendary theater in, uh, Seattle, Washington. Um, I guess what a rock fans, grunge fans. Remember that Pearl Jam Video? I think it was even flow. We've earned PLO when a Eddie vetter is, is climbing out into the crowd and fucking jumping off the balcony and stepping on people's heads and shit at, that's where they filmed that.

Speaker 9:          01:40:36       And I have to sell a lot of fucking tickets. I'm a third of the way there. So if you, and some of you are drunk buddies want to come down for the love of God, please come down to the show because a, I've got a ton of tickets to sell and clear channel. I don't know what they've done to radio but they've, they've taken off, you know, my guy up there was Marty Riemer, which I heard he has a podcast now if you live in Seattle, fuck those radio stations that took them off. Listen to his podcast because hopefully I'm going to be doing that to hype my show. Uh, I'm kind of running out of ways to hype shows now with what they're doing to radio. For those of you out of the loop, I think clear channel basically wants to have for Djs for the entire country and uh, you walk into these radio stations now, they don't even have a receptionist.

Speaker 9:          01:41:23       They have an automated system for you to figure out how to uh, get to where you're going out on. It's yet another thing, and I'm sure you people who are all for these kinds of technologies like I love when people like try to support those automated checkout lines. Like they always say the same thing, you know, and you're standing there looking at this poor bastard behind the fucking Reggie. You mean that person with the fucking job? You really want to see him be a poor bastard. What would you rather be? A poor bastard behind a fucking a cash register or a poor bastard you fucking homeless and don't have a God damn job. I hate when people do like dumb shit like that just to try to enhance their fucking point. If you fucking believe in that technology, support the technology, don't start, start saying what the person behind the fucking registers thinking.

Speaker 9:          01:42:09       Even though I'm doing the same goddamn thing. But I think I can go out on a limb and say that most people would rather have a fucking job than be homeless. All right? Lots of yelling this week, Bill, as opposed to what? Every other quiet week. Um, and then the final two gigs of this year before I take my month off and I begin my martial arts classes, joking. Um, I'm going to be at COBB's comedy club in San Francisco. Uh, December 2nd, third, fourth, and fifth, and I'm going to be at the Improv in Bray, California, the 16th, 17th, 18th, and 19th of December. Uh, come on down. This new hour is starting to take shape. Actually had some guy come up to me, uh, this weekend in St Louis and was like, that was absolutely hilarious. I didn't think it was as funny as let it go, but I liked it. It's like, thank you sir.

Speaker 9:          01:43:03       Well, it's not done yet, you know. Thank you for starting to compliment me and then giving me a little dig. Hey, you look great. You're not as fat as you used to be. Um, all right. And this guy, hey, he really had a pudgy face. He really did. He had one of those. He was a white dude, but he was like so fat. He was starting to look Asian. You know what I mean? When he gets so fat, your ice like that, uh, that precious girl, you know, you know when the fat just starts building up on your cheeks, all of a sudden, you know, that's how you start to look, whether that be in an incredible way to sell some fat burning products. Are you so fat that you're starting to look Asian in your eyes, even though you're not? Well, listen, that is offensive.

Speaker 9:          01:43:52       Well, line up behind the Italians in the southern us, that's what this podcast was this week. I'm trying to get fired from my own podcast. I'm trying to, I want a lot of complaints and have people say that I need to apologize, um, to different groups of people so that I could be fired from my podcast because I think I need a fucking vacation from the shit. I really do. No, I don't actually love doing this shit. I just got too much shit to do this week. So that's it. That's the end of this fucking podcast. I'm uploading it. I apologize for my singing. I apologize for the scatter brained, uh, podcast that this was, but I think, I think, I like to think that there was some moments. It was a good rental. Anyways, that's it.

I want to stay with, with Verizon because as far as where I travel, I'm going to get the droid.
