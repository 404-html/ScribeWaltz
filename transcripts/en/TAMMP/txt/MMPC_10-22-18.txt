Speaker 1:          00:00:58       Miss, she honestly looks like she's like fucking 30. I'm going to get some Cindy's therom. My hair is going to come back. It's going to be all way B. I'm going to get a fucking contract. Was Chanel my stupid phone keeps saying update apple ID settings. It's not as stupid phone. I apologize. Excuse me. I misspoke. It's not a stupid phone. It's a smart phone. Oh it's so fucking smart. Every two seconds, you know, to diva up to update apple ID settings. Some account services will not be available until you sign in again. So I keep signing in and there's some sort of fucking code is supposed to send me and I think I deleted it cause I just saw some bullshit from Verizon. You know like do you want to, do you want to pay your bill online?

Speaker 2:          00:01:49       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:01:50       You know what she optioned up to fucking submit your DNA if you'd like with your fingerprint so we can pass that on to some fucking Russian mobster.

Speaker 2:          00:02:01       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:01       Who is then going to buy a penthouse in it and in fucking New York City for nine zillion dollars and nobody's going to give a shit.

Speaker 2:          00:02:09       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:10       I want to, I want to know why. Why? All right. If I go to sit here supporting the tropes, being American and all of that shit, why these rich cons in this fucking country can then turn around and sell real estate to people that live in countries that we have problems with.

Speaker 2:          00:02:34       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:35       I don't want to get all 80 stand up here, but what's the deal? Day to day would fucking, I swear to God, if one of these jungle gym fucking training, Isis guys could somehow scraped together fucking nine zillion dollars to buy a fucking townhouse in Manhattan, they'd sell it to them.

Speaker 2:          00:02:52       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:53       No to have a fucking problem. No one. Well, maybe would have a problem then and we have fucking goal rate will go away real quick. All right. You tell him I go to New York City, which I was just there. I had a wonderful time. I saw this fucking dude from Russia. He bought three townhouses on the upper east, upper west side. Fucking things go for like 2030 30 million of whack. The fucking guy buys three side by side is gutting all of them to tournament to the biggest fucking apartment in Manhattan.

Speaker 2:          00:03:30       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:31       Here's the kicker. He, he bought it for his ex wife. My first thought was what killed Jesus Christ set out. I shut her up.

Speaker 2:          00:03:40       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:03:40       Then are they get them at least through fucking, you know, Halloween and Thanksgiving before the holiday season really fucking kicks in. You spend all your, do you know, you know what's funny about that? Fucking broad. She probably still wants something for Christmas too. I'm trying to help you. I can't fucking do a Russian accent, but I can't imagine what the fucking, you know good. And God damn well if he doesn't go out and get us some big shiny stupid fucking, I mean, how much of a fucking headache? Well, she, this is ex wife. He went out and bought her that.

Speaker 2:          00:04:20       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:04:21       I mean if I was just account, I'd be like, he's still fucking banging or, I mean, what's going on here? What do we don't get ghetto. Get a one. Boris, what do you define a fucking tree?

Speaker 2:          00:04:34       Um, yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:04:38       and I guess he doesn't get audited because he saw him, I don't know. It's a whole fucking thing is weird. And then you'll see like, you know, it'd be like some giant Goddamn building and they'll be like the top fucking nine floors for a cool $170 million. Did we say cool was sold to some fucking person on mainland China.

Speaker 2:          00:05:00       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:05:00       All these people. Okay. Janie's right. You know what they're doing right? That they're putting like dip, doing something with the toys. I forget what it was. Somebody told me this one night in a bar, uh, the guy was whispering, he had one eyebrow, but he really seemed to make sense. They're doing some of the toys. Russia is fucking with the elections, right? Isn't that what I'm supposed to know? We're supposed to say you're supposed to repeat now that I'm in Hollywood. I don't know. I don't even know what the fuck I'm talking about. All I know is it's very early in the morning and I'm getting my podcast done here before my, uh, my little cutie pie wakes up and I was supposed to do it last night, but, um, we ended up going out, went out to breakfast, you know, I hadn't seen it forever. Right. And I was away from the family for nine days. So we went out to breakfast

Speaker 2:          00:05:50       and, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:05:52       when she came home for a nap and then afterwards we went to this pumpkin patch and it just fucking me out, you know? I mean, I could've come on and done a podcast, but I wouldn't have been as funny.

Speaker 2:          00:06:02       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:06:02       You know, I wouldn't have been able to give you all that vital information you need to know about the country of Russia and China. I mean, all of that stuff was dead on. You can go fact jacket@bill.com. I've got all the facts to fucking to back it up, right? Um, I'm only kidding. Um, if you're from Russia and you're from China and you'd like to take your dirty blood money and spread it around here, then by all means, by all means. Let's have after, after all this suspicion about the last election, let's have somebody from Russia by three fucking townhouses, right in the God damn.

Speaker 2:          00:06:39       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:06:39       Fucking Manhattan. Why don't, why don't we do that? Why don't we have a fucking commercial late at night? Okay. That has a fucking knife, sharp and a thing that's so God damn sharp. Evidently you can sharpen a credit card with it and cut a fucking pineapple and half. Why don't we fucking do that and ignore our goddamn recent history and just have that out on the market. And then this on a red flag, have something out there that can take a fucking butter knife and have it go through for a frozen fucking steak. The commercial that literally showing the thing, I almost feel like fucking irresponsible putting this information out on sharpening a credit card. Okay. Then it looks slices of, I dunno what it was, went through a fucking shoe. I love the thing that's just like, we took this cerated fucking knife and we fucking went across concrete and then we stuck it in this fucking thing and now you can cut your postman's fucking shoe off with his foot still in it. Once again, I don't want to do 80 stand up here, but how sharp is the fucking type data? I was watching that commercial last night with the lovely Nia and we were just laughing our asses off.

Speaker 2:          00:08:03       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:08:04       going, I, I wouldn't want that in my house. I wouldn't, I wouldn't be, I wouldn't feel safe with me fucking happen. A knife that I cut the fucking tip of my finger off. God knows what some other lunatic, okay. No civilian needs a knife that fucking sharp, even though it's fucking a Dyson concert and one of those cooking shows, you know, I just wondered if that fucking guy from hell's kitchen ever realized how sharp the fucking knives are of the people that he's screaming and yelling at. You know. And I worked in enough fucking restaurants being one when I was growing up to realize that people who work in the kitchen for the most part are not the most stable fucking people,

Speaker 1:          00:08:46       fucking lunatics. I used to work in this fucking restaurant. One of the guys was on work release, meaning at night he went back to jail. He voices it dices you can rob a bank with it. Um, anyways, I'm so fucking happy to, uh, I'm an old man now. People, I can't, I can't go on the road for that long, you know? And now that I've took the time to build a personal laugh and have something to come home to, you know what I mean? I miss all the varmints run around. I'm a property taken out in slingshot killing something before breakfast. You know, it's one of my favorite things to do. Go out in nature, breathe it in. Feel the peace and Fuckin kill some skin. It look around making sure no other predators coming around won't steal my Keel. I'm in one time. I sell this beautiful family of squirrels right outside Mama. Breck get my breakfast and milk. Some are carved out without a permit and a load bearing wall with eight nobody to know that, right? And I saw sue family squirrels and the mother was handed a little baby a score, a little fucking nut. And right before it handed it to her, I blew that thing's fucking brains out.

Speaker 1:          00:10:13       Made me feel like an American mean. A little fucker was coming down and you know, I have a little bird feeder and they would know enough that feeds for the birds. All right? And I don't want to hear nothing about no god. Damn Squirrel. Ain't no fucking ain't fucking smart enough to realize that bird food is bird food and, and squirrel fruit is squirrel food. And just reminded me, you know, we're not sell that bird. I'm not in me to ask this. And I was like, what is this little beady and motherfucker doing in, in the bird feed? And I killed it in front of it's baby squirrel to send a message to the other squirrels. Sorry. Um, anyways. Did Anybody Watch any, uh, what do, what do, what do I want to talk about first? You want to talk Formula One racing Ui while you wait, why won't you want to talk fucking f? F1 You know what considering, and it's always a weird call right now. I just talked about killing varmints in your fucking backyard, which is very American, very patriotic. Borderline a holiday, right? But I also talked about a Russian and Chinese people buying fucking, you know, top level fucking, uh, real estate. Jesus. Bill. Can he get it out once they bought in America? All right, let, let's go. F One f one oh Lewis Hamilton, Louis the finger pointer Hamilton,

Speaker 1:          00:11:39       one of the great drivers of all time, but oh, does that guy liked to fucking point fingers when he doesn't win a race? Oh my God. He always goes, you know, I don't know what happened. You know, I don't really understand what the strategy was there. I'll have to find out about that. But you know, racing is tough.

Speaker 3:          00:11:55       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:55       He always does that. Maybe that's why he's great.

Speaker 1:          00:12:03       It was a really, really, really fucking exciting race. Lewis Hamilton had the poll. All right, the fucking race starts. Kimi Raikkonen said, you know what? I know I have more than a race since 2015 I think today's a good fucking day to try to win one. And he comes to, I don't even know what you know, cause I didn't see any of the qualifying. I fast forward through all the, the grid lineups and shit. I thought it was battle at first and when I saw fucking Vettel spinout Yo, I love about Vettel federal and Kimmy raking. I listen to a lot of guys who drive emotionally. Yeah. Sebastian Vettel was driving the way I drive in fucking rush hour traffic ends up spinning out, fucking up his car and he just, you know, he doesn't wave and go, I'm sorry. Just slams on the gas. Like he's fucking, Burt Reynolds spins the car around and keeps driving. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:12:50       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:51       Okay. The guy managed to get all the way back up to the front of the field to the point that Lewis Hamilton needed to come. And second, if he was going to win yet another championship and you know, its Lewis Hamilton just because, you know, it's not like, I don't fucking respect the guy, but I, you know, I'm new to this sport. One of my, I'm gonna just gonna become a Lewis Hamilton fan. Um, I'm just going to start watching college football. And who's your favorite team on Alabama? I'm a fucking doing that. I'm going to refill it. You, um, yeah you gotta go. Contrarion so anyways, uh, he had a chance everybody, I think he fucking, yeah, he pitted early, like really early, like on lap 12 of 56. I'm taking, what the fuck is he doing? There's no matter what he does, those tires are gonna wear out. So now he's in first place. He's driving like a lunatic because he's trying to get, guess, get enough fucking space. Um, between him and everybody else, specifically Sebastian Vettel because if we basically, I don't know, I don't know how many fucking points he needed. I'm new to the sport, but he basically could have won the championship that day.

Speaker 3:          00:14:02       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:03       So he's driving like a lunatic wild trying to conserve as tires, which never fucking works. Right. That's like staying in a relationship because you know, you've got great sex, but there's no love there. Eventually. Yeah, you got to fucking, you got to pull off. Just be like, why, what are we doing here? So it was fucking tars end up, you know, start blistering like my shoulders in the sun. They're like my ginger freckled shoulders in the sun. So any poles in. And then the big thing is like fucking Kenny get out of the pitch before battle comes around so he can be in front of them and he's got botox in front of them. Valtteri Botox. Right. And you know Valtteri he's going to fucking do whatever Louis wants him to do because evidently he's the fucking gimp on the Mercedes team. I mean, that guy's given away literally a victory this year to keep fucking Louis happy. And Lewis is still walking around going, yeah, you know, I don't know what happened. They, what do you mean? You know what happened? What happened there is everybody's catering to your fucking needs. Sorry. You're gonna have to wait another week before you win the fucking championship.

Speaker 3:          00:15:06       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:15:06       Jesus fucking Christ.

Speaker 3:          00:15:09       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:15:10       Somebody get this guy some sparkly fucking Kleenex over here. Right. So anyways, he gets out of the pit before Vatal does. It's so fucking exciting. My wife's going like, wow, this is really interesting. It's amazing. I can't get her to get into football. Probably cause again hit each other anymore. Right. But I think I might've got her into motor sports. I said, come on. Yeah, I go, this is fucking international.

Speaker 3:          00:15:33       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:15:33       And we went with this. They have a race in Monaco. People pull up in yachts. Okay. Did, does human trafficking going on in the bay is the cars are going by. And of course this gets your excited cause all she's seen, you know what she likes, she liked with Lewis Hamilton, got out of the car. She goes, wow, he's really into jewelry. You know, I had her, I had her right there. It's going to cost me a bunch of fucking money. So anyways, uh, Max, Max Verstappen whenever Lewis and starts working his way up to the fucking field. By the way, Daniel Card has fucking nightmare of a season continues. He's driving around, he's having a great fucking time. All of a sudden his car quits like a fucking Prius in the left lane. Remember that rumor? The thing just fucking dies and he pulls over and now he's just getting you to see mom, we were driving for fucking Renaud. Yes, next year. Can anybody explain to me why that guy isn't going to be driving for a

Speaker 3:          00:16:31       okay

Speaker 1:          00:16:31       for Ferrari next year? Cause they were trying to suggest that maybe Kimi Raikkonen it's not going to be, I can't fucking believe how much I might know about this sport. I love it anyways, so they get down to the final five laps. Lewis Hamilton needs to pass Max Verstappen the does that 11 enough, you know, gap between him as far as like, uh, you know, I think at that would've, that'll come and forth maybe, but with the points he would have enough points to win and you got to give it to veteran Ferrari. They're fighting to the very end. They're like, fuck these fucking assholes. We're Ferrari. All right. That's what everybody fucking wants. They want a god Damn Ferrari. And maybe if you're a little bit younger, you want a Lamborghini. Okay. But really, if you really look throughout history, elegant styling power, all of that, you got to give it to Ferrari. You just have to, every kid had a fucking post magnum Pi. Did he drive a Mercedes? No, we did not. He drove a Ferrari.

Speaker 3:          00:17:43       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:44       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:17:45       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:46       People out there who got the first hair plugs. Did they buy a Mercedes? No, they did not. They bought a Ferrari. I don't want, I'm talking about here. Um, anyways, all I know is when you go to those meek and fucking, you watch those Mika car auctions, it's not even like for like actually Mercedes, uh, vintage Mercedes and Ferraris there. Then I even at that thing there, right. That thing that Jay Leno goes to on that golf course up by fucking, uh, where the hell, I mean that, that's like debts. Like people know every nut and bolt on the fucking car or they have enough money to buy their ex wife fucking three God damn townhouses stuck together in Manhattan. Ex Wife, right? Pebble beach. I mean those cars are so fucking nice, so goddamn expensive. They drive them onto the golf course at pebble beach. You know, like you go into the fucking Rosebowl. Um, so they, they, anyways, for, I had a huge day. I feel, you know, Kimmy raking in one, his first, first, uh, since 2015, Sebastian Vettel showing the heart of a fucking line, you know, you're going to have to fucking kill me if you want to win this championship. And uh,

Speaker 1:          00:19:06       I don't know, I'd probably add the best thing was watching Louis Hamilton trying to pass past max for staffing and Max for stamps and holding them off. Right. For some reason, by the way, ESPN get out of the fucking car when that's going on. You know, I, I, what the fuck am I looking at here? I'm in the garden or playing a video game.

Speaker 1:          00:19:29       How can I tell how close they are if I'm fucking sitting in the God damn car and I can't look in the side view mirrors, they did it on the replay too. Anyways, but I also love that Lewis Hamilton, like how we had to make sure that like, I gotta make sure this guy does his fucking spin me out, you know, hitting my car, then I'll be fucked. So it was this weird thing where he had to be like super aggressive but also cautious. It was really exciting. I know a lot of you guys fast forward to any of that, but I'm so fucking sold on that sport. Um, I love it. And I missed the fucking, I don't know if there was a moto GP thing about, what is it? Mark? Mark has his fucking, he's running away with the thing. Um, but it's still some of the best racing. And next, next April, I got to carve out some time. I want to go to that Moto GP race in Austin. But anyways, let's plow ahead here everybody. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:20:19       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20:19       So next thing I wanted to talk about, oh, well we'll talk about football here. So yesterday, the only game I really watched, um, was the, uh, the Patriots versus the bears because, uh, I only got so much time in my day now and um, you know, I had to make up for that time. I was away and my, my wife didn't tell me when I was on the road was saying to my daughter when she's at that age, she was actually missing me. Like walking around, it's going that, that I wasn't there, fucking broke my heart. So, um, anyways, I dunno. So I gotta I gotta Work Smarter is what I've learnt. So I was just like, all right, this is football Sunday, I'm finally home. So what I did was I went out to breakfast to my lovely wife, my beautiful child, and I just tape the Patriots game. And when, um, my daughter took a nap, I I fucking watched the bears patriots game, you know, it took me like maybe like an hour and 15 minutes to watch it because I had the whole thing recorded up until like the final five minutes. And uh,

Speaker 1:          00:21:30       here's what I would do if I was the offensive coordinator of the fucking bears. All right. That mixture bisky I don't know if I said his name right. All right. Very mobile quarterback and all of that. But at this point in his career, anything beyond 17 yards as far as if it's like a pass, he sees not accurate at all. They haven't said that. I remember Tom Brady is this. Secondly, the second year after he won the super bowl is deep ball was not good. Okay? I'm not saying it was Mitch Dubiski bad. I'm just saying you can get better at it. The guy can fucking throw it. 60 yards. As we saw in the last play of the game, he's just got to make sure that there's somebody underneath it with the same Jersey says. So I didn't understand why didn't they just dinking dumped their way down the field, had that Cohen kid or whatever coming out of the backfield.

Speaker 1:          00:22:14       He was killing us all day, but they kept trying to throw like a 20 yard fucking pass and like I gotta be honest with you. I mean really it wasn't even close. Should a dentin dunk their way down the field and occasionally just send somebody deep, Have Mitch air the fucking thing out just to keep everybody honest. All right. And then you can utilize his eyes running an ability because we grew really couldn't stop the guy. I'll tell you what was annoying, but I really hate is when a quarterback acts like they're going out of bounds and everybody pulls up and then the guy gets another 20 yards. I think on the next fucking play you ought to be able to like the guy up. Alright? It's a country fucking move and everybody's slow eyes like he's Barry Sanders. Yeah, no it isn't. It isn't. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:23:00       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:01       But um, one thing I will say if haven't sat here and watched the ridiculous level of celebrating that goes on in baseball now and in football, especially in baseball, like, dude, I don't fucking get it. These guys had doubles and they're doing synchronized celebrating with the people in the dugout and back in the day, you never did that shit. If you fucking did that, your buddy who's bad. Next we'll be looking at you like, are you out of your fucking mind? And then he'd take one of the head, the pitcher just through it, the next pattern and it was just acceptable. Now you've got these guys, they're going up there. They got the face guard, they got the elbow pad, they got the Shin Guard, they're hanging all over the fucking plate. I would just love to hear what like Nolan Ryan would say about about that, and then there's celebrate and they hit a single and they're doing little fucking jazz hands. People that dug out at that point at each other. They're fucking thumping that chest. You need think they just won the game. That's what kills me. Like who's that guy on on the fucking patriots? I don't know anybody's name anymore. I got a kid, right? The fucking guy catches the football on a kickoff.

Speaker 1:          00:24:15       I Dunno what it was. They're like scores like 10 to three Isam, shit like that. Seven to three, I can't remember. He runs up to about the 15 yard line, gets fucking drilled, coughs it up, and that other bears fit player, by the way, just fucking Johnny on the spot just catches the ball and he gives them like he coughs it up, bears get the ball and like the 15 yard line going and fucking score. All right. Absolutely, totally fucked up as the kick returner and then either the next character, a couple of kicks later, same guy catches the ball, he runs down the field, goes all the way for a touchdown, slows down and like the eight yard line to high five another fucking Patriot before he goes over. The goal line is slow as humanly fucking possible. He's sitting there high five and like he's up in that game. It's like, dude, that just made you even, you need to run another one back and run into the fucking end zone. I don't know if they turned, they drive me. He's got world class speed. Yeah, we'll tell him to fucking stand on his head. Maybe some of that world class speed will trickle down into his fucking brainstem.

Speaker 1:          00:25:33       That's like when fucking a tripit ski was running all over the fucking field and then we finally to sack him and one of the Patriots does the shush thing to the crowd, like he's been doing it all day. That reminds me way back in the day, Jerome Bettis was the king of that. Granted he's a fucking hall of Famer, so I'm probably wrong on this, but I would watch that guy and he would live like 30 yards on 20 carries. And then in like the fucking beginning of the fourth quarter, he'd finally ripped one off for 30 yards and then he'd get up and start fucking stopping around. Like you've been doing it all day. I guess it's, it's just a, I think it's like a generation gap type of thing. I've always liked the guys. They'd score a touchdown, they give the ball back to the referee. You know, I just feel like everybody now is aware that, um, if you make a good play, it's going to end up on Instagram. So you gotta you gotta throw a little more fucking mustard on it and then maybe everybody will forget about the, the rest of the fucking game.

Speaker 1:          00:26:38       I have no idea. Anyways, plowing ahead here. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:32:51       Did I already lose it over here? Oh, there it is. There it is. There it is. Um, so anyway, so I got to tell you. So I took, we took our daughter to a pumpkin patch yesterday, which, you know, that's, that's a big mom, dad moment for you. First Time you take your kid to a pumpkin patch, right? So my wife's going, she goes, uh, when do you want to take it? You want to take her? Sorry. Before her nap or after I go a pumpkin patch seems more like a fall, you know, afternoon type of things does. She goes, all right, we'll do it after. So anyways, we had gone to breakfast in the morning and then we, uh, we went to a would, she takes her naps and now we're going to go. So we ended up going to this really nice part of town out here in la. I don't want to out this fucking thing. All right?

Speaker 1:          00:33:49       They say it's a pumpkin patch. Okay, now I know I live in a fucking city, but at the very least, you know, just try to fuck and recreate some of sort of patch. We show up to the God damn thing. It's in the parking lot of a fucking cvs. They've got a corner of it. There's a god damn tent in there. And when I tell you they had four thousand four thousand fucking people underneath that tent and this fucking giant woman who she was like this size of chief in one flew over the cuckoo's nest screaming at everybody that they had to keep this area clear. It's clear a what? There's 4,000 of us in here. They got fucking goats and dig got up. They had a petting zoo

Speaker 1:          00:34:34       in this, like swear to God, this little section, they threw some, hey, I got to give it to them. They threw some hay down over the fucking blacktop to him. And I'm sitting there like, alright, you know when life gives you lemons lag going to the fucking pumpkin patch of a fucking cvs who gives a shit. But my wife is sitting there going like, like, you know, this is why women are awesome because they do the holidays right. You know, they're just sitting there like, you know, this isn't the fucking, this is not a pumpkin patch, but I will tell you this, they had some of the best pumpkin's I've ever fucking seen the Pumpkin's, we're fucking ridiculous. They were the kind of Pumpkin that if there was a cookbook about shit, you can make out a pumpkin. These were the pump because they would make the cover.

Speaker 1:          00:35:14       These were the sports illustrated swimsuit models of fucking pumpkin. So it wasn't all bad. All right. And that like six foot five woman yelling and everybody was fucking hilarious cause she was getting frustrated but still trying to be nice, you know? And she's into this fucking tent of God. Damn head is almost touching the top of the tent. There was so much and I didn't have any fucking money. And somehow in there they had a little ATM machine and I'm sticking my fucking credit, my ATM card, and they're going like, there's no way this isn't getting double swiped.

Speaker 1:          00:35:49       There's no way some Russian baron isn't gonna try to fucking buys. I Dunno. Oh fuck it. Pen and pencil set for his ex wife with whatever the fuck I have on my God damn accountant account. So anyways, she pulls the ripcord, she goes, no, no, no, no, we're going to go to this other one. So I'm like right, no problem. Cause this is the new me. I don't fight this shit. All right, I've just decided I'm going to be a better fucking husband and I'm just going to argue less. And when you really make the decision that you're going to be a better husband, they're the only real option is you just going to agree with your wife. Um, that's really it to and in a lot of women applaud that where if it went the other way, like ladies, if you want to be a happy wife, just agree with your husband. It would be considered like really sexist and uh, they'd be a kept woman. Does Stepford fucking wife or whatever the hell he could Bridgeport, it's some fucking town in Connecticut. Wife, right? Hartford wife. Um, anyway, Stanford, Stanford wife. Is that what it is? I have no idea. Um, yeah, you just, you just fucking agree with them. Alright. And that's, it makes it, it makes it better because that whole happy wife happy life. I mean

Speaker 1:          00:37:14       it's really like, it's a joke I do on my act. I go, it sounds cute cause it rhymes, but it's a threat because it's literally, if your wife isn't happy, nobody's going to be happy. And that includes you. You kid the fucking, yeah. If y'all got a Goldfish, it's gonna Start Rolling over on its side. Like it's starting to die until she gets into a better mood again. So it's just like, okay, let's just fucking,

Speaker 1:          00:37:40       let's just keep it happy. That's so, all right. So we drive over to this other one and the old me would have been like, yeah, it's a fucking pop. Could get good fucking [inaudible] a fucking no one wants to let game the, I would have been the old me. So I don't, I just do what my wife says and I get back in the car. Right. Fucking drive over the other side of town does next pumpkin patch. So we pull into the next pumpkin patch. There's no place to park. It's fucking crazy. It's actually in a field. This fucking rides. There's a petting zoo. There's actually room for it. Right? I'm not a big petting zoo fan by the way. All right. All I'm thinking is fucking what does it hoof and mouth disease often fucking a goat horn, dizzy, whatever the fuck it's called. Right. Um, and not to mention, they bring the Goddamn kids in there and they're sitting there like walking up. They got no respect. The parents for these fucking goats, they've had their horn sought off. So now they're standing there, right?

Speaker 1:          00:38:45       Like, like, uh, like Luke Skywalker without his lightsaber. Now he's just some guy in a bar, you know, I'm a Jetta. Oh yeah. Let me see some jet. I shit. Well, you know, I'd love to, but uh, you know, my light saber, the battery, I got to recharge it. Just hang out for a second. I'll fucking, I'll have a sword fight with somebody. You'd be impressed. Right? So we go in there and this just people that just like their pet goats, like their dogs and you see the goats, the goats there, they're fucking annoyed. One of the guys goes up and he's just stroking the beard of this one goat where I'm just like, you know, I'm not in the social circles that goats here, but that's gotta be some high level fucking disrespect. You know, would you go into the fucking octagon at the UFC and start tugging on the fucking man bundle, one of those fucking black belt human weapon lunatics?

Speaker 1:          00:39:39       You wouldn't, this is what they were doing. So my wife keeps telling me to let my kid pet the fucking things. And I'm like, so I've just was holding onto her and I went perpendicular to the goat. You know, if it's an alligator you want to come straight on because they got to turn their head to the side to fucking bite you. She goes straight up and just fucking, you know, pet it on the snap. I mean, if we're really going to do white people shit, which is walk up to shit and act like it's a fucking dog when it isn't, that's basically what we do in nature, right? So my, see my wife getting frustrated, like I'm being a helicopter parent. I'm not a helicopter parent lifestyle, but I don't say that. I'm like, all right, you know why you fucking do it? So she's, she's bringing the kid in like all the moms and they got the fucking goats eaten this hae to try to keep them happy and ignore the fact that people are stroking that Goddamn beards, right? So all of these mothers are approaching from the rear of the animal and all I'm thinking is one of these kids is going to take a, a, a single or a double fucking leg kick from one of these fucking, uh, for one of these goats. So I'm sitting there trying to eat, just fucking go from the side. So fortunately nothing happened. And um, then all these people like, hey, you want to go hit the food truck? It's like your kid just fucking pet goat.

Speaker 1:          00:41:08       You're trying to get goat pinkeye what do you, what do you, what the fuck are you doing? And they had chickens in their chickens by the way, he could tell that this, these chickens were just for the petting zoo because they were regular size. Cause I was sitting there going like, wow, look how look how small it's it's chest as you know, as opposed to those fucking roided up once. You know what I mean? The pumping iron ones that are at the grocery store. Um, anyways, long story short, we fucking, before we get into that, we pulled into this, there's pumpkin patch and there's no place to park. And my wife's goes, which they have a valet and I'm like at a pumpkin patch. Like how, what happened to you that you want to valet park at a pumpkin patch? So we drive up this hill way up this Goddamn hill and there's all these signs in the side of the road that just say a no parking $50 ticket. My wife's going like, it says $50 a ticket. And I'm like, well it's the price of doing business and what the fuck do you want from me? And then I'm looking at it and it's written on construction paper with the magic marker. And I'm like, I really don't think that's coming from the city. Right? There's all these other people parked here. Nobody has a ticket.

Speaker 2:          00:42:25       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:42:25       So we just park. So me, me and Nia just start laughing about this no parking sign about how it's written on construction paper with magic marker and we're going down the hill. And uh,

Speaker 1:          00:42:41       we ended up running into somebody that knew us, that got us in there was a super long line. And then we saw that there was actually valet parking. It was like, ah, they want, they want you to do the valet parking that came from the valet people and the regular parking so they could get your money. See you wouldn't park for free. And we ended up parking up. So we went in there, we had the best fucking time. Uh, people asked and they treated you like a king. Can't thank, I'm not going to, you know, say the name of the fucking place. So what? I always feel weird out in that shit, but thank you so much for the way. The petting zoo was awesome. I was just an overprotective parent. Evidently we got some awesome fucking Pumpkin's. I was pulling my daughter around in the wagon and she's at the age now where she wants to walk, but once she got in the wagon, she sat in the back corner and was just chillin, was leaning on one elbow and she had her other arm fucking draped around like she was fucking driving a low rider.

Speaker 6:          00:43:33       She absolutely loved it. And uh, I got to tell you when the great dad moments of my life was pulling a wagon with my kid in it, with pumpkins all around it. And I'm just thinking like, you know, maybe that happy wife happy life thing isn't a threat. Maybe they just know when it comes to this shit. The way I understand. Um, I don't know. Some Guy Shit.

Speaker 2:          00:43:55       Okay,

Speaker 6:          00:43:56       so that's going to be my new thing. All right. You know, if you want to buy 47 fucking pumpkin's for the kid Halloween party, we're going to have, because it's going to be great for their experience. Then you know what? We're going to get 47 fucking pumpkin's. I've done all right. I'm not going to pull a Lewis Hamilton here and be like a, you know, I don't know what happened back there. I mean, uh, I think we only need one pumpkin for some reason we got 47, but uh, you know, I mean, but it's tough picking out pumpkins a tough, I'm not going to do that. She knows what the fuck's best

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       and we'll just, we'll just leave it at that. We just leave us to that. I've done, I remember long time ago going to a cookout and talking to another husband. He just, I said, so what'd you say? What'd you say to her? Huh? What'd you say to him? You know, some bullshit. Right. And he was just going, ah, man. He goes, you know, Bill, he goes, I don't have any more fight in me. And I was like, first puzzle. But the, the amazing thing was, was I heard the piece in his voice and, and, and him and his wife seem happy. So it was just like, all right,

Speaker 2:          00:45:08       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:45:09       Maybe the problem here is me, maybe because if the house was run the way I was running it, it would look like a bachelor pad and that's not what kids need. All right. So I'm going to shut the fuck up and make some pumpkin bread this week and whatever my wife wants to do, I'm just going to fucking do it. Hug Her, tell her I love her and I'm going to try that. I'm going to try that, that road rather than fighting every fucking goddamn thing and being a that fucking guy in one of those hacky Hollywood movies about cops being that I'm getting too old for this shit, being that guy ain't, I ain't not fucking doing it anyways. Um, all right. Oh. And then another great moment yesterday was a, when we left the first pumpkin patch, you know, my daughter was enjoying walking around so she was crying cause now she's back in the fucking astronauts seat and tried everything.

Speaker 1:          00:46:07       I gave her my keys, I gave him my hat, all of that shit. And then uh, that wouldn't work. So I just started singing to her and then Nia started singing along with me and then our daughter's slowly stopped crying and then was trying to sing along. We were doing the, uh, you know, where his point or where his point, or here I am, here I am. And my daughter always sings along to a, the run away. Like she knows that part. So we get through all the fingers, get through, where's, where is Mama, where's Papa? You know, where's my daughter? And then we run out, she's done crying. And then we just sang old McDonald had a farm all the way to the next pumpkin patch, which was literally like a half hour away. And what was funny was we ran out of farm animals and I was doing like penguins and giraffes because my wife was, Neil was doing the, the, the sounds of the animals and who the fuck knows what a, what a giraffe sounds like.

Speaker 1:          00:47:12       So she would be looking at me like, you can really, you're going to throw that in my lap. Like the guy on second base celebrating the other guys at bat being like, Hey, fuck it, tone it down everybody. But to take a 95 mile an hour fast ball to my fucking Chin, God over here. Um, and you know what, it was a great guy, Dan Day. We didn't have any fights, so I think I discovered something, um, all these years of being with my lovely wife, evidently I was the problem. Um, and with that, let's do, um, let's read some of the, uh, the fucking, the read the emails here for the week this week. Um, all right, bill, great email. Slowly, uh, a Billy but munch. Oh my apologies to Kate Upton. I wasn't really trashing or I just thought it was funny was I feel like that's the last person I thought.

Speaker 1:          00:48:06       Well who would have chimed in? I did say that. I thought it was cool that she was a baseball fan. So I just listened to you Thursday podcast. Your ears should have been on fire. I yelled like a wild man. Keep reading you dumb ass. Keep reading while you were looking up Kate Upton's bio, if you only had read a little more, you would have discovered Kate Upton is married to Justin Verlander. Look at Justin Verlander crushing it on the field and off. He's a sad or aunties a close up. Um, she's married to him and is currently carrying their first child. Hey, congratulations to them that Justin, I learned something. Happy wife, happy life. All right, so when she got you, got you got major league ballplayer money and she's got her money too. So when she wants 98 Pumpkin's, which I also believe it's the speedy of fastball.

Speaker 1:          00:49:01       Just, you know, just grab a second, third fucking wagon. Just do it. I'm telling you, you'll love the best day ever anyways is currently carrying their first child. So yeah, she's, she really likes the Astros baseball. Come on Billy bookworm. Don't make me yell like that. It's hard on my heart. And so always go fuck yourself. All right. I'm an idiot. Um, I thought it was cool that you, I just thought she was a baseball fan anyway. I'm always the worst. All right. Michelin Stars. Oh my God. Am I going to get trashed for everything I said last week? Bill, I was listening to you Thursday afternoon podcast and hurts you bring up the Michelin Stars for food. And I had the same reaction some years back when I first heard about it. For those you who didn't listen, like I taught Michelin Stars was, was separate from Michelin tires like the way a mackintosh stereo, like the best turntable.

Speaker 1:          00:49:52       One of the best out there, arguably, um, is different from Macintosh computers and it's spelled differently, but evidently it was the same people. And I'm like, why am I listening to the people who make radial tires? So I don't fucking hydroplane tell me where I should go. Get some, uh, beef balling off. Um, so anyways, he said I had the same reaction or she said back when I first heard about it, uh, like wait, it's the same guys that do the tires. So I had to find out why a tire company became the standard for fine dining. Um, turns out the founders who are French, so I automatically love him. Started the tire company in 1900 when there were only about 3000 cars in the entire country. So to help drivers develop road trips, which would mean increase car sales and also increased tire sales.

Speaker 1:          00:50:47       They started a guide that included maps, how to change a tire, where to get gas and places to eat and sleep. Eventually they branched into fine dining in the 1920s or so, this has got to be the most informative and interesting. A email I've gotten as far as like correcting me. The Kate Upton one, one might have been the most hilarious considering all you asked or friends knew why she was chime in it anyways. A one star means it's a very good restaurant in it's category two stars is excellent cooking worth a detour. Three stars is exceptional cuisine worth a special journey. And I even think like that is um, like all of those are uh, the way they're described are being extremely humble because if he get any star as far as, I mean, I don't too much about it, but like if you get three stars, you one of the best restaurants in the world.

Speaker 1:          00:51:51       Um, so if you get one year, a third of the best restaurant in the world, I mean, I'm going to fucking eat there anyways. Most restaurants don't even get the one stars. So one stars pretty damn solid. There you go. Always. Sorry. Anyways, there is actually a one star restaurant right down the street from the comedy cellar, a on Macdougal called Minetta tavern. I've eaten there. You've probably walked by this place thousands of times. If you haven't been there, it's definitely worth the stop in, uh, think it opened in the 1930s. Not Stuff. You're pretentious. Really old school place order the Black Label Burger. I promised the Burger and fries are going to be excellent. I'm doing that next time I'm in New York, which I'm going to be when I play Madison Square Garden on November 7th. Um, anyways, that's the Michelin Story. Checkout Moneta if you haven't before. Hey, you know what?

Speaker 1:          00:52:47       These are two really great informative emails. I love it. Thank you very much. A Hey, let me, let me finish the last two reads of the advertising here real quick. You guys want to hear me read out loud? Do you want to hear it be entertaining again and then I'll go back to saying dumb shit about stuff and then you guys can correct me on the next podcast. A dollar shave club to dude, the fucking red sox are in the world series playing the fucking Los Angeles Dodgers. You know, usually they go to the world series.

All right, let's see this. Hey there, Billy bronco. Hey, how about those new Broncos that are coming back? Huh? Those looks sweet. Um, I worked in a garage during summers of high school and college. Not only do you see, uh, what cars

Speaker 6:          00:57:43       aren't shit under the hood. When I worked in car, I literally went to the fantasy of buying one of those Broncos and the fantasy included my wife saying, absolutely, Bill, get one. You know what? I actually tried to talk her into letting me buy one of those old GMC RVs from the 1970s into the 80s, and I wanted it in that palm desert green and I was going to have to do to build my truck, make this fucking thing. I was actually considering have a d all electric and then hiring a driver. Whenever I had a fucking road Gig, I just had that thing driving around. I'd fly to where it was and do a run a gigs. Um, and we would just be in there and we'd have a fucking humor door. And a fridge for some ice cold beer and I put on fucking 9 million pounds and my wife was just like, no, you're not doing that. And I was just like, okay. And it's got, because I swear to God, if she didn't, I would have the shit that I would have. You know what I mean? I would, I would argue that I would have one of the weirdest fucking car collections ever. Cause I would, I would own one of those.

Speaker 4:          00:58:52       Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:58:53       Um, I like station wagons. I'd have one of those fucking Mercedes Benz AMG fucking station wagons.

Speaker 4:          00:59:02       MMM.

Speaker 6:          00:59:04       You know what? You know what one of these days I'll actually, I'll give you like my top 10 fucking cars cause I really got to sit down and think about it. I like those fucking those, those GM member per lookup, GM, General Motors Pereda progress.

Speaker 4:          00:59:18       Okay.

Speaker 6:          00:59:19       And look at those, those, whatever. What the fuck that thing called?

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:59:23       just look that up. Whatever that vehicle was called, it was like a fucking living room and a boss all at the same time. It had a spiral staircase that you walked up the parade, a progress, check that thing out.

Speaker 4:          00:59:36       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:59:38       Anyways, plowing ahead here. Let me, let me finish reading this thing here.

Speaker 4:          00:59:42       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:59:43       Not only do you see what I would have stretch limos from the 1950s I have a 1955, uh, Chrysler imperial stretch limo or maybe one of those ones that like John Lennon and Elvis had and world leaders had that was made by Mercedes, the 1960s that really boxy looking one.

Speaker 4:          01:00:02       MMM

Speaker 1:          01:00:03       yeah. All Weird Shit. I wouldn't have a Shelby Mustang and a fucking Hemi this and a Hemi that fuck all that. That's all baby boomers. Shit. I have no interest in any of that stuff. I like that fucking weird shit. I like those Nash. I liked that fucking BMW that had like three wheels in the, in the full front of the car would open up. He had to move out the steering wheel. I don't all shit like that. Now there's gotta be somebody out there with a car collection like that that you can tell me where I can go look at all those cars. Cause I, I love all of that Shit, man.

Speaker 4:          01:00:34       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:00:34       All right. Uh, my advice for the, uh, anyways, oh, the kid, the kid who wanted to buy the car. All right, let's start over. I worked in a garage during summers of high school in College. Not only do you see what cars aren't shit under the hood, but also cars that look lame real fast. Um, my advice for that kid is to get something with low mileage from the 90s jeeps, lightweight pickups, and anything you can find parts for and anything where you open the hood and the parts are identifiable. Don't get a dodge neon or a shitbox. Find something that looks new inside, inside and out. Get the oil changed every 3000 miles and have it as long as you want it. There you go. I used to do that. I, that's one of the big things. Um,

Speaker 4:          01:01:23       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:01:23       Changing points when I was a kid was I learned how to, uh, change the oil in the car, which is really simple, but it's huge. I would do it every 2,500 miles. I remember being in back east, it'd be freezing fucking cold out and he had to do that thing where it, you know, I tried it the first time when the engine was ice cold and the oil was coming out like syrup. So you'd have to start the car up, let it run a little bit. We'd heat it up, but not too much where all of a sudden then it'd be fucking hot. But even then that wasn't bad. You just go inside for like fucking a half hour. And um,

Speaker 4:          01:01:56       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:01:57       I, and I had a little place down by the, uh, the firehouse that used to take the recycled oil and I come down there and I'd dump the shit in there. It was fucking beautiful. Um, I learned how to change the fuel filter air filters, one of the easiest things, fuel filter, uh, got a grease gun, the loop job, all that. So you didn't get all the squeaks and all that shit. Just basic maintenance like, and then I would bring it in. Um, I never learned how to adjust a carburetor. I always got nervous with that shit and I would just,

Speaker 2:          01:02:26       mmm.

Speaker 1:          01:02:28       I do all of that. Although, however, one time I got in patient taking a fuel filter off and I snapped it off of the fucking fuel line, so then I had to get it towed over there and I told the guy over there what I did and he said I didn't communicate it right and I had the fuel filter sitting on the bench seat and he went out there to start it up and gas when all over the fucking engine and we had a fucking engine fire. That's what he said. We had a fire. I was like, no dude, you had a fucking fire. And then he fucking yelled at me and shit and like, like I was going to sue them. He goes, oh, they're not going to start fucking doing a bunch of work on a God damn car with a hundred something thousand fucking miles on it and just yelling at me. I remember looking at the guy like,

Speaker 2:          01:03:06       okay,

Speaker 1:          01:03:06       dude, I've, and bringing you a gift is my fucking car will be here forever. This is how you're going to treat me. I'm not trying to be a fucking asshole, but I did not say that to them.

Speaker 2:          01:03:14       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:03:15       So I remember my dad told me, he goes, you go down there and you make sure you pay. So there's a record that your car was there and not, and sure enough, I went down and the guy said, no charge. I said, no, I'll pay for it. And he gave me a look because he knew that I knew what the fuck he was doing. And that's the last time I brought my car over there, had it fixed somewhere else. And Long Story Short, at one point I had an engine fire and it fucking burned down to the ground. But that was years later. That was my first vehicle to 83 Ford Ranger. Um, anyways, to be honest, the insecurity never came.

Speaker 2:          01:03:48       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:03:49       Uh, wait a sec. Oh, it's a different, different fucking email. Oh, okay. So that's, that's that guy suggested he was too skinny, too tall. Here's the thing about the insecurity. Um, Bill, I am what you would call a goofy looking bitch. Five 11, like 135 pounds and super awkward. I have a pretty face, so I'm told, but I've always felt weird about my body. Are you fucking kidding me? If you got into fashion, they tell you to lose 20 pounds. Five 11, one 35. You sound lean and mean to me. Be Honest. The insecurity never came from me, but from other people by earliest memory of yeah. And that's probably their insecurity cause you're probably taller than a lot of guys. Um, my earliest memory of being made to feel weird about my body, I'm assuming this is a woman.

Speaker 2:          01:04:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:04:38       Oh, they signed it. Olive oil. All right. Uh, my earliest memory of being made to feel weird about my body was when I was eight and a teacher said,

Speaker 2:          01:04:47       yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:04:48       I'm too skinny and look weird. Yeah, that's old school shit. Uh, people used to do that. I shot up in heights since then and I've always, always been mocked for either the height, weight or both. As a consequence, I've developed somewhat of a complex about it. I've been suicidal about it before, honestly. Oh Jesus Christ. Don't take it to that level. You've got the supermodel body. Um,

Speaker 2:          01:05:15       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:05:15       But then I'll watch some video about a burn victim

Speaker 6:          01:05:18       and then feel like a real sack of shit. All right, so you got some perspective. I'm a girl by the way. Forgot to mention that. And when I was in high school

Speaker 1:          01:05:26       school, I got bullied by this short guy. He said I was turning into a man once and I honestly cried my eyes out. Oh God. Because you know what it is? He's a little fucking run.

Speaker 6:          01:05:40       And that's, that's the thing. If, if anything, anybody in high school listening to that, like one of the best things you can learn in life is that so much, so many things that other people say. It really has nothing to do with you, even if they're saying it about you and has to do with the other person and how their parents suck or they feel bad about their own life. So, you know, like if you want people to not say mean Shit to you, uh, walk around happy, have a happy look on yourself, on your face. Like, you know, go out and enjoy yourself and you won't believe the fucking negative attention that you'll get.

Speaker 1:          01:06:14       MMM.

Speaker 6:          01:06:16       And one of the great joys in life is the day you realize that, that it has nothing to do with you. And you learn to just filter all of that stuff up. Um, you have five, 11, one 35. I mean, I'm telling you like,

Speaker 1:          01:06:29       yeah,

Speaker 6:          01:06:30       there's, there's a lot of women that are going to fucking hate you because of your height and your build because it's going to be hard for them to keep weight off. He got a tremendous advantage. Everything that all the clothes you're going to put on, there's a reason why models are so tall and all that because they look absolutely stunning in the clothes. And then they sell it to all of all the short fucking people out there and then, and then they never look right. Um, anyways, she said, uh, my question to you is, hi, do I get to a point in life where you don't give a shit? When anyone says I get that, I'm thin. But honestly, it's just the weight my body likes. I'm not unhealthy at all. I have no health issues and my doctor isn't word. Yeah. And, and the, the, the older you get,

Speaker 1:          01:07:13       you're going to, you're going to look great and all the, that little run two made funny you. There's nowhere for it to go except for his fucking man tits. Um, what should I do next time someone says something to me, uh, I'm 22 and people at work feel comfortable enough to say shit like, did you have eating issues as a kid? Jesus Christ. Even a complete stranger who is asking for my help, no less took it upon herself to tell me I look anorexic. Um, yeah, no, that's, that's all other people's issue. I feel like people think they can get away with shit like this because I'm not fat. You think I should just tell people to fuck off? Only thing is, if I do, that'll be, I'll be in an argument pretty much one to two times per week. Thanks a bunch and I love, I love you and Nia wish you and the Munchkin the best.

Speaker 1:          01:08:07       Go fuck yourself a olive oil. All right. You've got a great sense of humor. Just seeing your olive oil, there's a bunch of shit you can do. All right. Um, I dunno, I, one of the things I used to do when I used to go out after shows and when somebody said like mean stuff to me, I would just go, uh, you got something between your teeth and they never did. Right. But it would just make himself self conscious. They'd immediately shut their mouth and put that tongue up over their teeth and then just fucking walk away. Um, you can do that and just say, I appreciate that and just, you know, offer them a piece of Gump, you know, make it seem like they have bad breath. There's little things like that to turn it back around on them. Um,

Speaker 3:          01:09:01       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:09:01       I don't, I don't, you know, you know what really, what is really going to be, cause then, you know, I'm also suggesting that you kind of be mean to them. What you're going to have to do is just, you know, learned to like how you look. That's it. And just really know that, um, that's all about, and I know you're at work, but you know, if a guy said something to you, I mean it's easy to be like, just be like, you know, I recently heard that a lot of things that people say mean about you has nothing to do with you. It has to do with them. That's too long. Just to be like, sir, are you saying that to me? Cause you're actually concerned or is it because your dick is the size of a fucking peanut? I don't know what the fuck you can go with Dick size. That's always good. All right. This is some old school yard bully shit. Yeah, just go with the obvious. They're going with the obvious on you. Oh, you can talk about my weight and I can talk about that giant fucking potato you call a fucking nose in the middle of your face.

Speaker 3:          01:09:58       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:09:59       You know, you know it's going to keep growing your ears, your nose just keep growing. You're going to look like Jimmy Duranti by the time you're 35. You don't know who the fuck he is. We'll look them up. You can't now. Um, yeah, but, uh, I dunno.

Speaker 3:          01:10:11       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:10:12       I, I mean, I'm going to give you stand up lines. You can't save him at work. If some woman said you'd said you are, you anorexic and just say, no, I just know how to push myself away from the table. Your pudgy con, you know, there's that, you can do that. But I think it's really more important. It just accepting the fact that here's the thing, your metabolism will slow down. As you get older, you'll fill out a little bit more. And you know,

Speaker 6:          01:10:35       I mean, when I was 22, I was a fucking rail myself. And I look at the beautiful ball that Donna said, hi, I'm now at 50. Um,

Speaker 3:          01:10:45       okay.

Speaker 6:          01:10:46       I Dunno. Look at me. I started losing my hair. I didn't go out and fucking, you know, try to start moving shit around up there. I just said, fuck it. I shaved my head. I just am who I am. And, you know, people call me a bald cut now and it makes me laugh. I actually take it as a term of endearment. Uh, I like how I look and I know I, I, I'm, I'm not, you know, I'm not a good looking guy, but I fucking, I, I like it. I liked that. I look like a fucking freak. It's, and I actually enjoy aging. I bought this fucking old man's sweater the other day and my wife goes, why you can't put that on you look like you're fucking an old man. I go, I am an old man. Let me be an old man at where my old man's sweater put around the house and fucking a sitting on the back porch smoking a scar, thinking a glory days.

Speaker 6:          01:11:34       You're 22 years old, you got your whole life ahead of you. You're going to run into somebody who's going to realize how fucking beautiful you are. And I got to admit something, the fact that everybody gives a shit about the way you look, you're going to have a great sense of humor and you're gonna laugh a lot in life. And that's gonna keep you young. Said, God bless you and you five 11 body, hundred 35 pounds and everybody else can go fuck themselves. And with that, that's the podcast and the rest of you can go fuck yourselves and I'll check in on Thursday.
