Speaker 1:          00:03:10       Um, I've had such a bad experience, like all my life, all my laugh ever there was a bid. I've been waiting for the, I couldn't wait to have a fucking house. The kids came by to go trick or treating. I mean I moved out and um, the first time I lived like in the up the attic of, of a fucking old house that they turned into an apartment. It was fucking hilarious. And you had to like walk down the center of the apartments so your head head wouldn't hit either side of the fucking roof. And uh, I told you guys this right now, he didn't have a bed. I slept in a sleeping bag and I would sleep right by the window because I didn't, we didn't have any AC. And then one night there was like some torrential downpour. I was sitting there dream and I was on a boat or something, some about water and I woke up just soaking wet.

Speaker 1:          00:04:00       Um, and then he always funny ended up catching a cold and like the next day it was like July was like 89 degrees out of something. And I had a cold, like it was fucking November. Um, Oh God, that fucking sucked. Um, then I moved back in with my parents, get my shit together, fucking finally graduated fucking college. And then when I moved out I ended up going to New York City and people don't go trick or treating in New York City. They have places where they go where all the fucking candy is and they make sure there's no fucking Weirdos there. Um, and then when I finally moved out to La, I don't know, people still didn't come to my first apartment was when I got my house, you know, five years ago there was just like, all right, now they're going to be coming. And I was fucking loaded for bear and I, you, I did the bid on, I had the full size candy bars. Jesus Christ. Cleal you're driving me nuts. Get over there and lay down. You keep, there's no way to be mad at a dog for longer than four. Frustrated more than three seconds. They'll can you please lay down. Hey Buddy, laid out,

Speaker 3:          00:05:08       down. Go on,

Speaker 1:          00:05:14       lay down. There you go. And the follow through. Thank you. Um, I already can tell she's not going to sit there cause she's laying down, but she has her ears up and she's just staring at me. You know what it is. I had to get up early to do this fucking podcast cause I've got a bunch of shit that I need to do. So anyways, people finally started coming to the fucking house and uh, that's what I found. You know, soon as the sun goes down the first, I know we always talk about this, but you gotta admit it's true the first like hour and a half. It's the cutest fucking kids you've ever seen. The parents are great, you know, it's just like a great, it's just, I dunno, it's fucking awesome. The kids are adorable. And then somewhere around, I don't know, two weeks, seven and eight, it starts switching over and there's just nothing, but it's like after like a quarter to nine, I mean, just everybody see it's going to be a bunch of fucking, oh man, you know something about rent in this fucking house and it's got this crazy driveway.

Speaker 1:          00:06:13       I don't even think anybody's going to come up here, but next year I promise you guys I have to fucking,

Speaker 1:          00:06:19       I want to open a door and be like, ah Nah. You guys, you're too old. You're too old. Look at, Hey, go buy some candy. Get the fuck Outta here. But then you got to worry. They're going to fuck up your house. Even if they don't do it that night, they're going to do it another night. Just be like, come on man, you guys are too old. Maybe it'll just lie and be like, oh, sorry. I might've candy. How tall are you? Five Watt. Yeah, I'm out of candy. What do you got? Yeah, there's four. You're not for 11. Fuck out of here. You're five foot one bated. Um Oh y'all are. You know what you do is, is what's the worst kind of fucking candy? Oh, it's just a shitty old lady kind of candy. That's what you do, you know with the, the fucking fruit in the middle of it.

Speaker 1:          00:07:06       Like real fruit. Oh my God. I don't know about you guys. I don't know what grandmothers are like nowadays, but when I was a kid, man, my grandma, my grandparents had the worst fucking candy, at least one of them did. And then like the fuck, I had a paper route and then there was like a bunch of old biddies and shit that, you know, a couple that never got married and shit or that fucking, they're dead. They're fucking husband died and they'd always have like this little candy. I have a piece of candy. Right. And I know he got a bite into, Ugh, God, I didn't know what the fuck it was. It was just, it was just horrible. Just there, just, you know, he was like, did they put your perfume in the middle of this shit? I'm sorry. It was, it was too.

Speaker 1:          00:07:47       I'm just saying it was disgusting. All right. So anyways, um, I'm actually going to a Halloween party tonight. I was going to make some pumpkin bread for the house straight. I was like, ah, or the party in and neo's going like I was, I got mad. I got so much shit to do when I go and I gotta make that Pumpkin bread. And then she just goes like, well, why don't you just like not do that? Well just, you know, we'll go get a bottle of champagne. She always does that. She always goes, you make you life so fucking hard. It's like, it's Pumpkin bread. It's not that. It's just like, it's fucking, it's going to take me like, you know, 10 minutes to put it together and then throw it in the fucking oven for an hour. It's just a pain in the ass to do it. She, why don't we just do this? I could afford to fucking just being another asshole shown up with a bottle of wine as opposed to showing up with Pumpkin bread.

Speaker 4:          00:08:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:37       The fuck is, you know, I don't know. I don't know. Sometimes. Sometimes, I don't know. Sometimes we don't fucking, we just don't see that out of like, I want to make my own steam dumpling. She goes, I just buy them at trader Joe's. You know? Those are, those are the times, you know what I mean? Those are the times we just want to kind of smile and nod, just slowly back towards the front door, get in the car and just never come back again. Yeah. Then other words, you'd lie to yourself that that's what you're going to do for the next 20 minutes. As you drive around, you know, talking to yourself, it fucking red lights and you look over, there's some beautiful woman half year raise. Go and look at that crazy bald old guy and you just sit there and you got to be like, wow, I'm the, I'm the crazy bald old guy.

Speaker 1:          00:09:23       No, it's good. I'm worn me out here. And then you'd give, you go back home and then that's it. That's how it works. But every once in awhile, not actually once in a while, more people than not can commit to that day. They can back their way out the front door and they can go through with, it may take it all the way to the divorce, you know, they go up, they get themselves a to pay, you know, they painted orange, they get a red tie, they run for office, they start people up at truck stops. Um, this election is so fucked up that, uh,

Speaker 4:          00:10:03       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:10:04       that's kind of really quieted down. I have for the last fucking debate, if that's what the fuck you want to call it. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:10:10       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:11       My big thing this year is I want to know, um,

Speaker 1:          00:10:16       I just fucking lose lose. It's fucking lose lose at the, at the thing. And you know, something, as much as I've been sitting here fucking saying, you know, Trump's a fucking racist and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. It's just like, well, you know, the Clintons are from Arkansas, so, you know, I don't think they're too fucking enlightened down there either. You know, if Wayne off, I know I'm just fucking being stereotypical here, but give me a break. Oh, Bill and fucking I, Hillary, they grew up in Arkansas in like the fifties. You might want to go back and look at some of those fucking racist, you know, the racist people screaming at black people. Kids go into school for the first time. You might want to try to pick her head out or something like that. Give me a fucking break. You from Arkansas. I love that shit.

Speaker 1:          00:11:02       Wear it just because you're a democrat. That just means that you know that you'd not homophobic, you're not racist. Or I have a byway wear blue. I just don't fucking or that public. And then that automatically means that you're, you know, you want a berry babies in the backyard and you know, unless they're fucking blue eyed white babies, you know what I mean? Like that whole fucking deer in that, the corporations and all that, they're all fucking cunts. And you know, I know that cause I'm a condo and I'm somewhere in the middle. I like to think I definitely lean more fucking left. But, uh, I'm also contrarian and now I live out here in Hollywood and I just can't fucking deal with these people out here and that it's, it's driving me. I don't think it's driving me to the right. It's, it's driving me to say things on the right just to fuck with these people. Like I love trashing out here. It's one of my favorite fucking things to do.

Speaker 3:          00:11:56       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:57       You know, I, last night I was fucking around on stage and I was talking about that and talking about how, you know, well, Hillary's from fucking Arkansas, everybody and they all kind of laughed. I go, you know, those, those fucking fly over states that you guys all shit on out here, you know?

Speaker 3:          00:12:10       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:12:11       And uh, you know, of course it gets fucking whatever. You know what the big thing isn't it on this ballot is wherever the fuck you live. More important than what of that orange headed fucking racist comment or that devil woman with her fucking issues. Right. She lived in Arkansas in the 1950s. Jesus Christ, write me a fucking break. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:12:35       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:36       Be a or her, you know what the biggest fucking thing is, sorry, I'm losing my train of thought here is those is all the props, the state propositions, you know, and this is what pisses me off. So I go to this website to try to figure out California 17 ballot measure propositions explained.

Speaker 2:          00:12:52       All right? And uh,

Speaker 1:          00:12:55       all they do is they, they sort of explained the thing, but what they don't have, what I cannot find is all the bullshit that is attached to each one of these propositions. Like this shit is so fucked up and I do not understand why.

Speaker 3:          00:13:11       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:13:12       this is never addressed. Why? And all these propositions like no means yes, yes means no. And then there's a little bit of maybe in there and then if you vote for the fucking Shit, there's some other measure saying that, you know, yeah, it's okay to a fucking stick, a baby in a snowbank for fucking, you know, 13 hours until it freezes to death or whatever our fucking long would would take. You know, I just can't, I can't find anything that says all the shit that's attached to it. Why can't the fucking ballot just be fucking the proposition? Just be written clearly. So regular people understand it. Yes. Means yes. No means no. And there's nothing else attached to it, you know, like they'll say, all right. Ah, there we go. Proposition 51 allows the sales of 9 billion in bonds,

Speaker 2:          00:14:03       mmm.

Speaker 1:          00:14:05       To pay for, for newK , kindergarten to 12th grade and community college facilities. The basics, roughly 6 million students at 10 k two you don't have the fucking, his proposition 51 wants to address the needs by allowing the sale of 9 billion in general obligation bonds to pay for buildings in modernizing k 12 and community college. It's the first school bond measure on the state ballot since 2006 it's unusual because it's sponsored by the building industry.

Speaker 1:          00:14:37       Okay. Right there. The fact that it's sponsored by the building industry means they're going to charge us up the fucking ass. And in the end, even though they get 9 billion, they're going to come in with the fucking tab of about 15 billion and then they'll be like, well, we already started against me going to physically move from talking shit and told Bluto. Typically the legislator would be the path for getting this kind of proposition on the ballot, but it hasn't been able to do so in recent years. Yeah. The fact that the building industry wants to do it, you already know this is crooked is shit. What you're voting on about 7 billion in nearly ADC like this shit. 7 billion would be allocated to the K to 12 thing and in the another 2 billion would feed it for the community college. I got to read all of this shit. Supporters include developers, builders, school board officials and business groups and I want to get any of those people. All right.

Speaker 3:          00:15:31       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:15:31       Supporters say, all right. Supporters say many of our schools need repairs and upgrades to make them safe for our children. That's very vague. Proposition 51 we'll will improve education overall and help expand space communicology so more students can attend. Opponents say prop 54 would add to the state debt, which is already more than 400 billion. How the fuck is California? 400 billion in debt.

Speaker 3:          00:15:55       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:15:55       Bond measures should be passed locally. Giving communities control of how the money is spent. Yeah. Jesus. I mean, did you feel any closer? All right, so there's one comment. Close the border. Eliminate anchor babies, citizenship and re institute.

Speaker 3:          00:16:17       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:16:18       and re-institute of all provisions of prop proposition one 87 the notes talk about building more schools. Sorry, I used to always vote yes. And these now Sacramento has changed my vote. I always vote no on school bonds. Quid pro quo baby. What is quid pro quo me? Where the fuck is it? Quid pro quo meaning I love that everybody else is dumb as me. A favor or advantage granted or expected in return for something.

Speaker 1:          00:16:51       Ah, that doesn't get me any closer to understanding it. Quid pro quo. Jesus fucking Christ. What it, what am I on law and order here? Quid pro quo means and escape and exchange of goods, goods or services where one transfer is contingent upon the other English speakers. Often is this tit for tat? Yeah. Jesus fucking Christ. English speakers often use the term to me a favor for a favor. Phrases with similar means would include give and take tit for tat and you scratch my back. I'll scratch yours. Quid pro quo. Agha sets the fucking snooty way of saying that shit. Let's go back to close the borders here so I can try to figure out what is fucking point is. Oh, I get it. Close the fucking borders and then I'll fucking, then I'll, I'll give money to this side. I see what the guy saying.

Speaker 1:          00:17:40       I don't know if it's right or not. Alright, fuck politics. All right. You know what I try. I fucking tried. All freckles has flipped out about technology and I figured out how to watch the NHL on my phone because so many in the room knew how to do it and they walked me through it and at one point I started to get upset because they go, it's not going on. He goes, what do you mean it's not going? And that's supposed to go on down. And I go and then I started getting mad about why would it go? Why, why, why, why would it get on? It's me if I'm fucking on edge. Just brought it down and bring it down. Bring it down. You know what I mean? Like you ever see somebody like revving up the engine ready to do a burnout. Then I brought it all the way down, you know, before the tire stopped moving and I realized that was not the tires I was actually burning up the clutch.

Speaker 1:          00:18:26       It's one of the most disgusting things you'll ever see is somebody trying to do a fucking burnout. And I don't know what happens. I still don't quite understand. I've never done one. I just never wanted to beat the shit out of my car. I basically get it with a stick shift. I don't know how you do it with an automatic, I've watched fucking the videos, but it's basically you get your premiums up, you let the clutch out, and then you stomp on the fucking break. See, your tires are already fucking going. But somehow if you fucked that up, you let the clutch out. And you've revving the engine and Jan, Jan, Jan, Jan, your tires aren't fucking moving and you burn out your clutch and it's, I don't know what that smells like, but the smoke is evil looking. Um, all right, let's move on here. Oh, did anybody watched the Patriots game yesterday? Clear. Get over there and lay down every always and about you. Go on, go lay down, go lay down.

Speaker 1:          00:19:22       I can't even fucking begin to tell you how much I enjoyed that. The fact that the fucking patriots beat the pills yesterday. I didn't say this because I take off beforehand because I take a nod. I get what bill Bellacheck does in his press conferences where he's like, I'm not going to say anything negative about anybody. I'm not going to give you any advantages because you fucking fat. Cats in the media are going to take this and give bulletin board material for the other team. I got to tell you, watching the fucking buffalo bills and we played them, we had a third string quarterback with a broken fucking hand or whatever the fuck was wrong with them. How they got in his face before the game with such a Bush League fucking move to the point like I've always liked buffalo. I might be done with that franchise. Like I used to give a shit. Ah, you know, they lost four in a row. Now I'm just like, you know what? Fuck them.

Speaker 1:          00:20:17       You know, it's like you're that insecure that you're not going to win the fucking game. That you got to try to pull some shit like that. And I was just like that. Then I was just thinking, you're like, you know what? Two great things happen. We lost. So now we don't have to deal with the pressure of the fucking undefeated season. All of the extra media hype that comes. If New England's going undefeated, if you fucking Indianapolis with old fucking, what the fuck's his name there, Peyton Manning, you can be all the way to 13 and owe nobody say nothing man. They right down the street, them cows.

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       Right? So he took that away. And then also I'm like the Patriots are going to beat the shit out of this fucking team the next time because of that bullshit. Cause I know in house they must have talked about it and they go, he get 41 fucking points. Whatever the fuck we scored against. You haven't said all that. I'd like to say a lot of positive things like tie Rod Taylor is like impossible to fucking tackle. I know the bills had a bunch of fucking injuries and I'd make those excuses, but they don't give a fuck those fucking animals. They don't give a shit. They would talk at all kinds of trash with third string quarterback. Like they were coming out on the field getting ready to lose another fucking Superbowl. I love that. You fucking ringless I love that you four three. Hey Buffalo. We're on our way to the playoffs. See you next year. Fuckos

Speaker 5:          00:21:34       wow, I enjoyed

Speaker 1:          00:21:36       that. I really fucking enjoyed that. You know fucking Rex Ryan told them to do it too. Oh God. I've been waiting to go off on this. You fucking get out there and you fucking fucking fucking fucking cause we the best fucking fucking in the fucking EFC. Fucking east. Yeah. Go have another fucking hero. You're tub of shit. If you want to talk about cheating, you know we let a little air out of the ball. He got fucking that dead stomach. Gastric surgery. He's not fees a fat fuck. He cheated letting air out of the ball. He had a fucking choke out three quarters of his stomach so you could actually see his dick every once in a while. Ah, sorry. Sorry.

Speaker 1:          00:22:20       Anyways, um, yeah, I and, and I gotta tell you something else to fucking watching this world series. I've gone back and forth, back and forth and back and forth about who the fuck I'm rooting for. I mean, how do you do it? One team's waiting fucking 70 not quite 70 years, right? 68 years. Say what it is yet. I'm 68 years. The other team has even been the fucker world series is 71 years. And I know you guys think of a pill. You're a fucking red sox fan. How can we not for the cubs. I was totally for the cubs until I saw the 30 for 30 on on fucking apartment and when I watched it, all of their, hey, let's play too. You know, hey, you know where the lovable fucking losers. We always show up. We just root for him. All of that went out the window the way that they fucking what the what they did to their kid.

Speaker 1:          00:23:12       I just looked at that shit going like, that's exactly what would have happened if someone in Boston did that. New York, Philly, Cleveland, these cubs fans for all their fucking, you know, Mr. Smith goes to watch Washington fucking a apple pie and Chevrolet way that they did. They're just like us. They're fucking animals. I'm not saying there is bad as bills. Fans are that fucking franchise. Those costs. The time I was wearing a patriots hat, it was the bills, jets. I was rooting for the bills. I'm taking a piss in the bathroom and pushed me from behind while I was taking the piss. What kind of a fucking coward? Maybe there's a reason in the last four and a fucking row, you know, I used to think it was because a madly, he was just too nice to win a fucking Superbowl and he went up against Jimmy Johnson.

Speaker 1:          00:24:02       Let's get him some hookers in a corvette. Right. Um, and fucking whatever that other guy's name is Jerry Jones with his real housewife fucking looking face. Good Lord. The guy always looks like, you know, he, she got like first degree burns on his face or maybe like slightly like into the second degrees, but he was like, all right, he refused medical treatment and he just puts some savvy on his face. Um, I know I'm going hard this week. I don't know why. I have no idea why. I'll tell you why. You know, why? Cause last night I wanted to fucking come home and do my God damn podcast, but my wife, you know, wanting to watch a scary movie. So I said, okay, let's watch it. So we started watching that, but they'll cut, took, took whatever the fucking that thing is. And I got about like, I got about 40 minutes into their movie and it's like, I mean, I don't want to watch the rest of this.

Speaker 1:          00:24:55       All right. I hate watching scary movies because I, I buy in, I fucking buy in and I'm just like, I don't want to watch this thing terrorizing this woman in their kid for the next fucking 90 God damn minutes. Cause I know neither one of them is going to die. And I'll eventually, they're going to figure out how to put, put Doka took back into the fucking thing and then they're going to do something with the book that lets me know that there's going to be another one. Cause they're always, you know, fucking horror movies can never just fucking end. You know what I mean? Every one of them, they got to get greedy like Friday the 13th part fucking 97, you know what I mean? Nightmare on elm street. You know, they did like 20 of those hell raiser, 15 evil dead parts six.

Speaker 1:          00:25:41       They just want to keep fucking going. And, uh, I dunno, I just, I just don't like fucking sitting there being, having anxiety, you know? And with each scene, you think gradually going to ramp it up the first time. Oh, it's just a little bit of knocking and then there's a shadow and then, you know, I was just like, this syncs going to, I got a bad feeling this thing's going to kill the dog and I don't want to fucking see that. All right. They already foreshadowed in the book that that's what's, what's going to happen. You know, they kind of showed you basically with the pop up book, fuck off. If you think I'm ruining this, this, it's this. It's like paint by numbers. I every fucking one of them I get an upset because I just hate, so I was like, I don't want to watch the rest of this.

Speaker 1:          00:26:21       So she ends up shutting it off and then she's like fucking pissed. She's like fucking pissed at me. And it's just like, I like Westworld. My wife doesn't give a fuck about Westworld. I'm still on episode two cause I mean, I didn't want to fucking watch it. She's like, Nah, I want to watch the real housewives of fucking saint or whatever the fuck it is. So anyways, let me get back to the cubs thing. So right out of the gate, not only is the country, it seems for the, for the Chicago cubs, it's kind of having this vibe of this foregone conclusion that they're kind of going to win this thing. So I have family or I had family back in the day out in Ohio, my grandmother worked for the Cleveland Press, you know, and um, way back in the day I had family, you know, I just had family about their right.

Speaker 1:          00:27:14       And so growing up I kind of was, you know, I was always a red sox fan, but, uh, you know, I Kinda, you know, through my relatives also kind of rooted for the Indians, you know what I mean? Like, I didn't, I didn't mind the Indians, even though they were in our division way back in the day, um, that and the Tigers, you know what I mean? Just cause of, of relatives, cousins and all that shit. So I was just like, you know, I kinda like the fucking Indians any now that Steve Bartman Shit, like the level that they took that too. That's exactly what would have happened in Philly and all this shit if it, if it happened out in la, that poor kid he got killed.

Speaker 3:          00:27:52       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:27:52       You know what I mean? Or San Diego or Sacramento or Fresno or one of these fucking lunatic fucking cities out here where they take sports Oakland way too seriously. San Francisco, you know? Um, so it made me just kind of fucking sort of pull back. And then also it's like I, you know what, I'm kind of over these fucking cities that have two professional teams in one sport. It's like Chicago won a world series, they won it in 2005 and that whole fucking thing where it's like, well that was just, there was for the south side of the city, so, so what, you need another one for the north side? Fuck the white sox and the cubs at this shit. If she, one of them wins, just fucking jump on a subway or walk three blocks downtown or uptown and join the fucking parade already. Same thing with the Yankees and the mets, the Lakers and the clippers in everything in fucking New York giants, jets, Yankees meds, fucking rangers, islanders, Nixon Nets. Just fuck off with that shit already. It's a New York team. If they win by you championship hat and go down there and just be happy that especially in New York, that you're so fucking filthy, stinking fucking rich that you can have eight teams or everybody else is doing, doing back flips, that they just have one in every sport. You know? I know. Isn't it amazing that New York has all those fucking teams and they don't win that much?

Speaker 1:          00:29:28       You think that Jesus Christ, you got eight, eight at bats every fucking year.

Speaker 1:          00:29:34       The fucking Yankees, I swear to God, I like the sugar daddy of New York City. You know what I mean? The giants are the son and everybody else is getting read written out of the will. That's basically how it works with the sports in New York. Do you know what New York should get three teams in every fucking city. Maybe they could fucking do something other than the Yankees and the giants. I have totally fucking respect for them. But Jesus Christ the fucking next should combine with the nets, you know, make like a fucking dream team. And those two shits shows, same thing with the Rangers in the islanders. You know, I dunno the jets and the mets, I don't know what they should do. They should both retire and they should start playing badminton. Um, oh chase spelled. Um, so anyways, so I'm really fucking sitting there and I'm unloving, seen Terry Francona killing it and it gets all the way up to three games to one.

Speaker 3:          00:30:26       All right.

Speaker 1:          00:30:28       And I dunno, something happened. Okay. My Cleveland friends, Comedians, one of them in particular just starts, he's just talking all this shit in Blahblahblahblahblah and he starts to got, we won the basketball, now we're going to win the baseball. Then you know, you watch, we're going on a fucking run, your Yada with no fucking respect that he's talking to a fan from Boston. You know what I mean? It's just like, oh, you're going to win two in one fucking year. Yeah, we did that. We did that a couple of times and then we went every fucking, we did all of this other shit. I'm not fucking throwing that in your face. I'm always the guy going like Anna. Now they'll say they don't know the team stuff. I never believe we're going to do it until we do it and then we do. Then I'm fucking psyched. And you'd go back to my podcast. I wasn't even a country beach Seattle. So these guys are acting like such fucking cunts. You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:31:23       Oh, we got Luke Brian. We're going to fucking do it again this year. All the Brown. Oh, you mean the guy that you guys all burned his Jersey and you're all done with first. He called that one. Oh, Paul Versey called that one. Paul Versey fucking when he was in Miami and he's Cleveland fans were saying, fuck that guy. Blahblahblahblah first. He said to him, you guys are all going to be sucking his dick when he comes back to town. And they were like, no way. That's never gonna happen while it's happening. That whole city's on their fucking nice. So anyways, so at some point after they went up three games to one, I went back to the cubs. The reality is, is I don't give a shit who wins this fucking thing because it's going to be great for one city. It's going to be devastating for the other city. Um, obviously. But so here's the deal. This is what's at stake with this world series. If the cubs win, the Indians become the cubs. They become the ones that have gone the fucking longest. All right? So they can't fucking lose. All right? If Cleveland wins, all right? Not only the cubs, still the cubs, as far as my quick research research showed me the next people in line for second place would be the cult 40 fives slash Houston Astros that started in 1962

Speaker 1:          00:32:51       in 1962 the Chicago cubs, we're already 54 years into their drought.

Speaker 2:          00:33:01       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:33:01       Okay. 1962 is 54 years from where the fuck we are right now. Right. So the Astros' are 54 years into their drought where the cubs were in 1962 and the cubs are now twice that at one oh eight. I don't know what the fuck that means. Does that mean that you should go play the lottery right now? 54 62 one zero eight. I have no idea what that fucking means. It's just, you know, one of those, one of those number things. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:33:35       I gotta tell you, uh, it's almost fitting that if the cubs are gonna win it, that they would torture their fucking fans to this level and it's fitting that if the Indians were going to lose it, they would go up three to one to lift their fucking teams hopes. This is why I think the cubs are gonna win. If Terry Francona wasn't in the dug out the master, by the way, he, he needs, that guy needs a, a nickname like the assassin. He needs like a boxer nickname, like lights out James Tony, you know, for the execution or Bernard Hopkins that he needs a name like that. It's just said he doesn't look like that. But that's exactly what that guy is. All right. But what I'm saying is because of what these teams have done to their fans, it would be fitting that the fucking cubs wouldn't just go in and win the fucking thing. So their fans could just relax and finally enjoy. Oh series. They would have to go down three to one before they'd come back. And then Cleveland couldn't just lose the series. They'd have to go up three games to one.

Speaker 2:          00:34:45       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:34:46       So this is what's crazy about three gear up, three games to one, and you're like, holy fuck, you're starting to take the wire off the champagne bottle at that point. Right? But then all of a sudden you fucking lose game five and just instantly, it's like, holy fuck, if we lose the next one, it's all tied up. So now the pressure is on the Indians. I'll tell you, the cubs are going in there. They're playing loose. They got nothing to lose other than fucking 108 year drought.

Speaker 2:          00:35:13       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:35:14       I don't know who's on the mound. I don't know what. But, um, I'm going to say the obvious cubs gotta go. They gotta stick, got a score early and make the fucking Indians tighten up. That's what the fuck they got to do. Or a, that's what's going to happen in game six. Either the cubs are going to score early. Indians fucking tighten up.

Speaker 3:          00:35:39       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:35:39       And then lose a game and then we get a game seven. Or if the Indians go up early, it's going to be a bloodbath. It's going to be a shit show. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:35:49       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:35:50       I'm hoping the first thing happens because I want to see, I want to see a game seven against a team that hasn't won an hundred and eight years in a team that hasn't won it. Fucking, uh, what is it? 68 fucking years? 68. So adorable to a red sox fan. That's fucking hilarious. I am, I don't give a fuck. That's like this. Whether we were there in like the 70s, right? What was 68 for us? I was at the met, let's see, 1918 to 1978. That's 60 years, right? Uh, yeah. 86. I was 1986. So you're just didn't bill Buckner go fuck yourselves. You know, you just did. Bacter as far as where I'm coming from, you got to go another fucking, uh, another 18 years to 2004. So I guess I won't root for the Indians. Nah, I can't. I fucking, I don't know. My relatives got me into the Indians. I don't know what to dope.

Speaker 1:          00:36:49       I don't know who to root for here. You know, I'm rooting for farm room for game seven route for game seven and then they're going to go up against each other and one team is finally going to win that critical game seven and get the monkey off their back. And then another one is just going to add another giant cinder block right on the fucking heart. So they've fans, it's kind of, Oh God, this one has trained right. Written all over it. All right. Let me read a little bit of fucking average advertising art. Jesus. The appeal. You didn't fucking copy and paste them. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:37:18       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:37:18       I hope by the way you guys are watching the series because it's, it's been unbelievable. What a fucking great series. It's bad. Um, oh Christ, what am I doing?

Um, it's about his specialist on Netflix, so definitely check it out if you get a chance. And uh, all right, let's get back to, um, let's get back to the, uh, the podcast here.

Speaker 1:          00:44:02       Oh, F one action in f one action. I totally missed the fucking race, but I read up on it. Lewis Hamilton wins again. For those of you sort of keeping score, now that I've been keeping score, um, you get 25 points. If you win 18th or second 15th. The third then is 12, 10, eight, six, four, two, one, right? That's the top, bottom, top, fucking 10 works. Um, Cleo, you could not be more adorable right now and what it is she wants fod. I got up a little bit to do this podcast. So now she's come over, she sat down next to me, her ears are down and she's rested her head on my arm and she's just staring at me like, I don't know what's going on. All right, today I've got another 20 minutes. Just fucking relax. No, no, no, no. Not coming up on the couch. Go on. Go lay down. Go lay down. Go lay down. Up. Get out of here please.

Speaker 3:          00:44:59       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:45:00       Jesus Christ. What the fuck again? It get out of here. Cleo. Get off of the couch. Way down. Oh, now she's needy. All right. Anyways, so Rosberg had a fucking league and the last two fucking racist. Hamilton is one boat. So he's shaved 14 fucking points off of the lead. All fucking Nico had to do is fucking win one more race. I felt if he could have won it yesterday, he could have wrap this thing up. I'm kind of glad that he didn't cause I want to see the person fucking wrap it up. Um, so the next race I believe is in Brazil, which is not until November 13th. And I apologize to a f one fans because I know I got into this shit and then I've just dropped the ball and like the last four or five ones, but I, I'm fucking living in this God damn house.

Speaker 1:          00:45:52       I fucked up. I forgot that, that it was this week and that I actually figured out through apple TV or some shit that I patiently worked my way through and actually figured out that I could actually get, uh, was an NBC sports. Is that the name of the channel? And I could have watched the game. She could watch the race. So I got to go home today, my house around the fucking corner tape that fucking thing. By the way, the kitchen is just come to a grinding fucking halt. I don't know why, but there's still telling us that they gonna Finish on fucking time. So whatever, whatever, I'm sure they will fucking sure they will. All right, let's get out of this. Let's, let's do some, uh, can I talk about now? Did you guys watch Clemson, Florida? Fucking amazing game. I also watched the, uh, my Clemson, Florida, Florida state.

Speaker 1:          00:46:42       Then I also watched a Florida fucking Georgia and, you know, I was thinking when I first saw it, I was just like, man, I got to go to that game. I got to go to that game of Jacksonville. The biggest outdoor cocktail party in the world is they say, and I'm like, I bet the fans are cool with each other. They're fucking, you know, cause it's a neutral site, you know, everybody's just psyched to be away from their house. Sorry, I'm fucking you on or near, um, Georgia scores first they cut to the Georgia fans in the stands. And I clearly see this guy turned around not facing the field and just giving the finger to the Florida fans above them. And I'm just like, wow. All right. It's at that level. Okay, it's a dead fucking level. I die. You know, I really had no interest in going to that game.

Speaker 1:          00:47:23       I'd want, I want to go to the swamp. And I've been to what Georgia home game between the hedges and I've been to a Jacksonville verse Bangles Games. So I felt like I'd been to that stadium. But after seeing it was like fuck when it looks like fun and I always have a great time at Jacksonville. Everybody shits on Jacksonville. It's a good fucking time. If you take the stick out of your ass, um, you can go to a gun range, shoot guns with the without the fucking silence around. All right, clear. The only thing I'm going to do is just sit here and pet you as I do the rest of this. All right. All right, Westwood Dear Bill. Uh, glad you love Westworld. For some reason he wrote Westwood and the beginning. Glad you love Westworld. Uh, I look forward to hearing your thoughts and the rest of the season season.

Speaker 1:          00:48:07       Um, if you like that and you're looking for a great movie to watch, checkout the 13th floor. It came out in the late nineties and deals with similar themes. Are you into reading fan theories? A common one now that is a non spoiler is that Ed Harris's character and the nice guy who's new to the park or the same person and other claims that it's actually all on Mars. Oh, for Westworld. Yeah. Well I got to get caught up before people ruined shit. I'll definitely check out the 13th floor and I think I'm going to watch an episode up. So three of Westworld because I think they're up to five at this point. I'm going to watch that today and I'm going to get caught up. And uh, you know, cause my wife fucking cheated on me with TV. You know what I mean? When you guys have your shows, right? We watched that show below deck with a yacht scan on their right. And uh, it's just, it's a reality show that we can both watch because they're always in the fucking Mediterranean. They got a fucking yacht. It's the Shit we always think, ah, we should do that. It'd be fucking awesome. And then you look up the prices and it's like the price of a house to rent one of those fucking things.

Speaker 1:          00:49:17       You gotta be like Beyonce and Jay z, like both of you can sell out the Rosebowl on any given fucking night. You know, you gotta be to that level of wealth to fucking justify. Do you realize that two of them almost worth $1 billion. So for then the blow 250 grand on a fucking yacht is like, let's say you're worth $100 million. If you're with $100 million, 250 grand is like 0.25% of your money, right? Cause a million is like 1%, right? So I don't know how to work that out. It's like 25% of 1% whatever the fuck that is of your money. And there were 10 times set so that that's like you and I go, hey, you want a yacht for a week and you take a penny out of your pocket and you break it into four fucking pieces and just hand it to them. Hey, you go, there you go.

Speaker 1:          00:50:07       Yeah, we'd like, uh, all the amenities. Um, anyways, I will definitely be, uh, be checking that out. Ed Harris is like, as always, as always one of the greatest actors of all fucking time. Um, I'll watch anything that that guy's, and I swear to God, the only thing I never saw his when he was the one where, Oh God, fuck, I'm the only one I never saw was the one when he played the painter and that got nominated or he got nominated for an Oscar. So I still haven't seen that once. I got to check that out. All right. Old Toys a dear Billy potato head. I love that. That's a good one. Cause that kind of shits on my Irish heritage and then also makes fun of the shape of my head. Um, if, if, if you ever have kids, will you try and expose them to toys that you enjoyed as a child?

Speaker 1:          00:51:04       You strike me as a matchbox car kid. I don't force the toys of my childhood, all my kids, but I've put a couple army men in their general area to give them a chance to play like I did. I am a huge, um, uh, Greer of that proponent of that opponent, of that proponent. Oh, that's what proponent means you're pro, right. I never knew what that meant. I just kind of figured that out. Oh, Ponant proponent. Oh, pumpkin bread pro pumpkin bread. I get it. Um, yeah, absolutely. I absolutely, I absolutely will do that. Um, my big thing is playing catch and uh, you know, I'm going to buy a fucking, I'm going to buy a, uh, a lefty glove for myself is what I'm going to do because I can throw a little bit with my left hand and rather than just sitting there firing it into my kid, I, I'd fucking a, I'm just gonna, I'm gonna go with the left hand.

Speaker 1:          00:52:06       We were doing that yesterday. We had a football, right. He's placed in where we're renting here has his fucking great pool. So it was halftime of the Florida game. We're out there smoking cigars and shit. And we finished that up. We've got the game turned up loud. So the game became, there was four guys, right? So he had two on one side of the pool too, on the other side of the pool. So you had to throw with your opposite hand, first person that sent it into the pool or if he had a catchable ball and it fell into the pool was uh, I dunno, whatever the fuck it was. It was, was that thing, that word you can't fucking say anymore because everybody gets offended and it's not a racial slur, but it is, you know, you know, you know the word, nobody said it, but we all knew we had, you know, without saying, you know, we're older guys, like that's what it means.

Speaker 1:          00:52:53       Um, so anyways, uh, yeah, I would definitely do that. I was, I was not a matchbox car kid. I W I was Corgi cars. We used to call them core g cause we didn't know it was pronounced Corgi until we got older. And I'm so old that I remember when they had rubber wheels on them and I had the giant oil truck. I was big, I had all the race cars, I had the Johnny players special, I had the Jackie Steward Elf car and my mother doesn't throw out shit. So I still have all of them. Um, I had one of those, you know, that kind of racing where the car just looks like a giant doorstop. Uh, it wasn't Formula One. It wasn't, it's not an Indy car racing. It's not open wheel. It, you know what the car looks like, a water slide. Like you could, you could slide from the fin all the way down to the front. I don't know what kind. I had a white and red, one of those, uh, Lincoln logs, Lego Lego blocks. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:53:49       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:53:50       You know, stuff like that. I think it's big to not have to keep your kids. Okay. You know,

Speaker 1:          00:53:57       I don't know the guy to get them outside and you got to, you got to keep them in their own. Like I don't, I, I have such a hatred of, of computers and iPads and all of that shit. Um, and kids just love them. I mean, they go up to it like, you know, liquid television type of shit. You know, back in the day, the MTV, I remember that graphic. I used to just make me want to sit down and watch it. Um, I dunno, Mr Potato head. I don't know about that. Definitely like board games. I think it'd be fun playing cards. I think it's cool to expose your kids to that, you know, so they have like that old school shit. Like it wasn't always the greatest. Like when like for me, if I met, uh, some woman, I took her out on a date and she had, she had some old school stuff about her, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:54:48       That, that stuff that was sort of passed down. I think that's really like a cool thing. And I think, uh, like some shit, like playing cards, playing catch, like going outside, it's just like, you know, riding bicycles, just like all that shit is going away. And um, I'm not one of these old people that I look at young kids and injury. Like, you know, what are they doing today? They're fucking nuts. And these kids today, they don't get it. And it's just like, um, I totally get why they're doing it because I had to tap out grand theft auto three in like 2003 or 2004 Id. I unplugged my playstation and stick it in the back of the closet. I literally just one day, it was like the fifth day in a row, I was just playing all day long and I could not stop. I had already beat the game, I got the cheats, I did all of that shit. And then I was just going on rampages every night just shooting up to city. And um, I just, you know, I kinda just lost everything else in my life that wasn't writing jokes and all that shit. So that was like 13 years ago. So I can't imagine how amazing the Games are. And um,

Speaker 1:          00:56:09       like the virtual reality goggles and all of that shit, I can't even fucking imagine like how you get your kid to go in the backyard and just have a game of catch back. To me, that's the greatest fucking thing ever. I think it's a great to communicate with your kid, you know what I mean? Cause it's like you don't, that's another activity going on, so they're not really paying attention. You can praise him when they're doing well, you know, build up their confidence. And then you just slide into how's it going at school, you know, and then you just read them third. It's going great. All right, so it's going good to be here. Same kind of looked down and I, you know, it's all right. Oh, it's a matter of what's going on and they can kind of open up to you. I think it's like a great way to, uh, I think it's really important early on to be able to do that. To have your kid be able to come to you if they have a fucking problem is a, a is a huge thing. But, um,

Speaker 1:          00:57:01       how you sit there with a glove and a ball and uh, how that competes with putting on fucking reality glasses and you feel like you're going to fucking base jump off of a building or whatever the fuck they do. I don't know what the fuck they do with those six. Um, yeah, that's a, uh, that's, that's a difficult, that's a difficult one. I love Lincoln logs. I lie. He didn't like Lego blocks. She stepped on him and your bare feet, they fucking hurt. Not the Lincoln logs. Didn't, but like that plastic shit. I wasn't into that as much as, uh, the Lincoln logs are cool. We used to fucking build those things. We build houses and then we would, you know what their Corgi Corgi car, Corgi cars, wherever the fuck are they called, drive him around. We'd have traffic jams and all of that type of shit. We had names for everybody that drove the cars. I remember I had all the fucking race cars and in all my, uh, it's weird. They drove like a formula one car to work and then they drove the trucks. I had trucks and racing cars.

Speaker 1:          00:58:03       Then my other brother, who's a total fucking gearhead, he actually liked like the real looking cars, like a Volkswagen bug, like a station wagon. Like he wanted to look like the cars that you could actually fucking drive. Um, I know my mother didn't throw all of those out. Jesus Christ is fucking nuts. They're all up in the attic somewhere. All right. Election Bill. The election is right around the corner. A couple of weeks ago. You, you'll eulogize the great barrier reef. Any last words for this election? Uh, not the country as a whole because I don't think it will fall apart by an imagined. This has exposed the side of our country that we've been able to keep under wraps for awhile, which is that no one ever pays attention to anything unless it's an easy talking point.

Speaker 2:          00:58:49       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:58:50       Not everything is more fucked up than we know or would like to admit. What's the worst thing that will happen if either candidate wins?

Speaker 2:          00:58:58       Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:58:59       well, if Trump wins, the worst thing is we're going to have to listen to all these European countries talk about how dumb Americans are, especially people in England. And I just want to say to them like, you know what, what if you threw out the person every 48 years? And I would love to see what the fuck you end up with. You know what I mean? Some years it's just not a good draft. If fucking, uh, whatever the fuck his is. Tony Blair, that guy's been in there since Bush. Not even saying that guy's good, but you just get somebody in there and they just stay there until they die. Doesn't he have like Margaret Thatcher's job? Oh, the original Hillary Clinton. Hillary Clinton can't even see her fucking name. Wow. What's the worst that will happen? Um, I dunno if Trump wasn't such a fucking jerk off if he wasn't such a jerk off.

Speaker 1:          00:59:46       It's really what the country needs. You need somebody who isn't a part of the fucking system. You don't, but you just can't have a guy like that in there. And then Hillary is just going to be more of the fucking same. It's just going to keep driving this country towards ruined. Do none of them talked about the population problem? None of them talked about the nationwide heroin epidemic. None of them talked about genetically altered food. None of them talked about fucking global warming. Maybe they touched on it for a second. They haven't said Shit. They're not going to do anything. None of. I'm going to try to stop the banks, put them in fucking line that building another real estate bubble. I'll tell you, it's fucking hilarious out here is they are building up la like I've never fucking seen. They bought up the house of Blues right across the street from the fucking, um, from the fucking uh, uh, comedy store.

Speaker 1:          01:00:35       They play like $28 million for the thing. They're going to put these, these high rise fucking million dollar multimillion dollar fucking condos in there. It's like, who the fuck's going to afford to buy those things? All right, and this is the thing, after 2008, after we saw what happened, they fucking gave the house. None of the bankers went to jail. They gave him the houses back so they could do it all over again. They're building another fucking bubble and I'm already calling it right now by fucking 20, 21, 20, 22 or some shit, there is going to be a bunch of empty fucking condo. Fucking high rises going along the sunset stripped and they have, they've knocked down the rainbow room, the Roxy, the wicks whiskey house of Blues, maybe the comedy store. They're going to wipe out all of these fucking things. There's going to be nobody in those buildings.

Speaker 1:          01:01:23       And even if they are in those buildings, they going to have no fucking place to go cause they knocked down all the cool places to hang out on sunset strip. It's so fucking stupid. You know, I was getting gas the other day and another place on the sunset strip and this guy said, I said, hey, you own the gas station. He goes, I wish I did this property just sold for 14 million bucks. And you know, they're knocking down the two buildings next to it and they're going to put up a fucking, you know, 170 unit fucking, I dunno, I just don't know where all these people are going to becoming. That can afford to pay. I just don't know where they're going to come from. Um, and from what I heard, you know, at least the ones on Lassie, Annika that was like oil money, you know, like Saudi Arabia and money came in and they don't give a fuck. I mean, they get money forever. Um, I dunno. Uh, what's the worst thing that will happen if either candidate comes in is that they're not going to stop what's already going on. And I gotta be honest with you, I don't even think like, you know, all the Bernie Sanders and all those types of people, you would literally need an army of those people and then they would need bulletproof vests to fucking, that's how powerful corporations are. And that's how off the fucking rails we are.

Speaker 2:          01:02:37       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:02:39       I Dunno. Which is why I'm trying to focus on the propositions and I wish if anybody can find a fucking website out there that not only lets me know what I'm voting for but lets me know what is attached to it. Like cause who doesn't want to improve the schools, you know?

Speaker 2:          01:02:54       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:02:56       But you know, whenever they have stuff like that, like, hey, let's clean up the drinking water, then they attach all this other evil shit underneath it.

Speaker 2:          01:03:03       Um, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          01:03:07       I Dunno. It's, it's all very overwhelming. So it's so fucking overwhelming that you're asking extend up comedian, what's going to happen or maybe you just did cause you want to hear me make a fucking ass of myself. Um, all right, here we go. Cool guy. Terrible in bed.

Speaker 2:          01:03:23       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:03:23       Oh Jesus. All right. Uh, dear Billy Bush bear. Uh, I'm a 20 year old female college student. Um, I go to holy cross.

Speaker 1:          01:03:37       Oh, in, oh, he said is I go to holy cross. Oh, okay. I go to holy cross in Worcester. Um, I had a boyfriend for the first three years of college and now I'm single. I hooked up with a guy that I didn't know was kind of an asshole. He sort of popular in seem friendly. One drunken night. I did the worst thing I could do. Fed his ego. Um, had I known he was a moron in a pompous Douche bag, I would not have done this. I'll save you the reasons why he's a Douchebag, but just picture lame eighties preppy bully who thinks he's God's gift. Again, I didn't know this because I never paid attention to them. Well after we hooked up, he told some people that I told them he was the best fuck I ever had a this found its way back to me and bill.

Speaker 1:          01:04:26       I was shocked. Why? Because he was the worst fuck I ever had. A, he had no idea what he was doing. He was, for lack of better words, not present. No rhythm and average at best. I wasn't mad at this because it was my choice to hook up with him, but now he's putting words in my mouth. I really just want to tell someone how bad he was and wait for it to get back around to him. What does my move here, Bill and or Nia? Well, wait a minute. Did you say he was all right?

Speaker 2:          01:04:59       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:05:00       One drunk at night. I did. The worst thing I could do feed is stupid ego.

Speaker 2:          01:05:06       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:05:07       Does that mean that you slept with them? I can't tell if you buy feed his ego. Ew. Ew. He was so bad. You felt like you had to say something nice. Now there's no fucking way. You said there's no way. You said he was the best. Fuck.

Speaker 3:          01:05:25       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:05:26       Um, I think you're saying, yeah. Yeah. I think you're saying that you, you fed his ego by hooking up with them. Had I known he was a moron in a pompous tooth. Okay, so he's walking around saying that you said, and you're also saying it's putting words in your mouth. So I'm assuming that you never said that, so fed his ego means that you fucking hooked up with them. That's what I'm guessing. I don't fucking know. Christ, they speak speaking riddles. Um, I wasn't mad at this because I'm,

Speaker 3:          01:05:56       yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:05:58       well, oh, this is a tough one. I would, I would call him up. Then when he picked up, I be like, why are you walking around saying that? I said you were the best fuck I ever had. I never said that.

Speaker 3:          01:06:15       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:06:16       Okay. I never said that. Okay. And hear what he says and you know something that might be a thing. This is the thing, this fucking, a lot of these guys like this, a tremendously insecure, maybe he knows, he doesn't know what the fuck he's doing. So he's walking around saying that so he can feel better about himself because he feels that awful about himself and he feels so fucking awful about himself that not only does he got to go that big, that the, the fucking way he feels about himself is such a big thing that it doesn't mean that he doesn't even think that that's going to get back to you or he doesn't even consider your fucking feelings. So you can either be the biggest person and know that this person is, I'm tremendously insecure and walks around and probably doesn't like themselves, which is a fucking horrible feeling to have and just take peace with that.

Speaker 3:          01:07:13       Or

Speaker 1:          01:07:16       you can call a guy out, which I kind of like, okay,

Speaker 3:          01:07:22       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:07:24       And I, and I, you know, and at that point you got to listen. Uh, if you were the best fuck I ever had, I would've said that to you and just leave it at that because you haven't sold them that he's completely fucking inept. You know what I mean? But you're also kind of putting the guy in check. Um, then, then you have your final option, which is you can go around saying that he wasn't the best fuck I ever had. He's fucking terrible it better than anyone. What happens is everybody just gets to sit back and enjoy watching you guys fucking do this shit. I understand why you'd want to do it.

Speaker 3:          01:08:01       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:08:03       I Dunno. I don't do the revenge thing. I kind of go to the person's that's doing whatever they're doing that's fucking annoying me. And I just kind of chopped the head off there and, uh, and then if somebody comes up to me and says what they said, I would say a, I would just say to him personally, yeah, that isn't true. I never said that. I Dunno. I Dunno what the fuck to do. I, I'm sorry that this happened to you. Um, and at 20 years of age, it's probably hard to understand a lot of the shit that I'm saying that of what that guy feels about himself. But, um, you know, you can't have somebody walking around saying shit like that about you. So I would, first thing I would do, I was confront the guy, call him up. I'd be like, why are you saying that? I never said that.

Speaker 4:          01:08:51       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:08:52       You know? And uh, if you continue to say that and if he kind of goes around, just believe, if you keep taking you to say that you're leaving me in a position here, that I have to tell them the truth. Okay. You're not the best fuck I ever had. All right. I Dunno. It's just, I don't know that sets, you know, guys, if you listen to this thing and you're a young person, that's such a fucking asshole thing to do. All right? That's totally coming from your own God damn insecurity. All right. And uh, as an older, wiser fucking man, you know, I wished that somebody older told me that when you hook up with somebody, you keep your fucking mouth shut. Um, you know what I mean? You're quiet about it. You know, it happened. Who gives a fuck? Who knows? You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          01:09:41       It's an insecure fucking move. And, uh, just, just sit there and then she did this and then did dead. She fucked it. Did this like, that's a really fucking asshole thing to do. Dumb in women. If you'll hook up with the guy and he's fucking terrible or he's got a little Dick and all that type of shit. Right. Uh, if he's not out there talking shit for you to walk around, fucking doing that too. That's another fucking asshole move. It's an asshole move either way. And in this case, the guy see asshole. So, um, I dunno, you know something, if you can hang on until Thursday, I'll run it by Nia version again and I'll run it by her. It's just that she's still sleeping here, so. MMM.
