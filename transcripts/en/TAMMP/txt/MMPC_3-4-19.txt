Yeah, I know I'm really late. I'm really late. But yesterday was the first taping my next special, uh, at Royal Albert Hall and tonight is the next one. So yesterday I had a bunch of stuff I had to do, uh, for like the intro of the special in all of that type of stuff. So it went great last night, had an awesome time and I never take the special world. I always just did like two shows one night done. I've never done like a show and then waited a whole day and then do another show. So, uh, I'm just looking tonight like I could not have been more thrilled with how it went last night. Um, did not have any of this stupid torture that happens afterwards where you're just like, Oh God, I, why did I do this?

Speaker 1:          00:58          And I that I didn't say that. Is anybody going to like me after this? I didn't do any of that shit. I was just like, all right, I miss something here, Miss, who gives a fuck, right? Yeah, it's fine. I don't give a shit. It's all gonna be good. So, um, tonight I'm just going to go out and have a good time and I'm as excited as I was to record this special eye. After last night, I kind of felt a little bit of sadness of like, I'm really gonna miss these jokes. I've never had that feeling before. Um, but I know the next ones that come in or whatever, but it's kind of hitting me here is I'm doing this like, wow, this is kind of the end of the run for these jokes, you know, and then I just move on like bill Bixby right at the end of the hulk. Just walk away from the act. Um, and the smartest thing I did was I already did a Gig at, um, Royal Albert Hall. Uh, ah, for fuck's sake.

Quite evidently Truman Capote's he was, uh, he needs, but again, two minutes. We thought he was just think about someone they just put for all the fucking jokes. I literally saw somebody get interviewed the other day and they were talking about the office, the American version. And they asked, could you make that today and the Oh no, no, we, we can never do that. We, cause most of those jokes wouldn't work today. That was 10 fucking years ago.

Speaker 1:          05:44          It's like if you were born in 1907 and somebody interviewed you 40 years ago, you, you would not want that interview to be made fucking public. You wouldn't, um, anyways, what fucking world that we live in that the, the office now considered too edgy for television. Oh, James is, you could never do, it wasn't the most absurd fucking shows you have to sign your life.

Speaker 1:          06:20          You know, it's fucking hilarious. Someday you're going to sound like you're fucking grandparents. Someday you're going to be in your fucking seventies. And something you said in your forties is going to sound fucking ridiculous.

Speaker 2:          06:31          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          06:32          Like nobody's like, it's nobody's allowed to like I don't, I don't know.

If I for anybody gave a fuck about you, you know, named cunt and went back into your fucking life, they can't find somebody to say that you said something that did something. It's called being a human being. Jesus fucking Christ. I told you that shit when I was in Scotland, that woman lifts dead broke dead fucking article. It was talking about commemorative statues and she's like, nothing makes my heart sink. Like when I hear there's, they're going to put up a commemorative statue. It's like nothing.

Speaker 2:          07:13          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          07:13          you fucking a genocide child pornography. Nothing quite makes you fucking heart drop like the making of a commemorative statutes. Oh Jesus. Um,

Speaker 2:          07:30          okay.

Speaker 1:          07:30          Anyways. Can you believe Christopher Columbus was actually a fucking asshole?

Speaker 2:          07:39          Okay.

Speaker 1:          07:39          New evidence shows. It's just like, where was that new evidence? What was it just sitting on somebody's desk for fucking 400 years?

Speaker 2:          07:46          MMM.

Speaker 1:          07:49          He's a fat. All these fucking people compared to what? Somebody in 2019 yeah. I would like to think that people learn how to treat other people better each year. So what we're supposed to be doing, you know what I mean? If you go back and watch an episode of solid gold, there's a lot of people dancing today that, uh, on that day that would get laughed out of the fucking club. And that was the peak at dancing back then. But it progressed and now all those moves that were unbelievable and now kind of basic,

Speaker 2:          08:23          okay,

Speaker 1:          08:23          that's what happened. So just Kinda, you know, can you believe the guy that won the Indy 519 55 wouldn't even rip qualified for the race in 2019? I don't think this guy's a champion.

Speaker 2:          08:40          Okay.

Speaker 1:          08:42          I think they need to rethink that championship. I, Ben, we withdraw. We going 140 miles an hour. I mean, the fucking pace guarded, it goes faster than that.

Speaker 2:          08:55          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          08:56          MMM.

Speaker 2:          08:59          I Dunno.

Speaker 1:          09:02          So it's just eye to eye. That's all right. If it, does that do anything, does it really do anything to say, hey, this guy who's, who's been dead for 40 years is, is actually this now? Okay,

Speaker 2:          09:15          okay.

Speaker 1:          09:16          So what am I supposed to do now? Go back and look at this person's sports career or their fucking movie career and look at them differently somehow and then sit there and look at myself like I'm this great fucking person just because I had the luxury of being born when I was born and then be so fucking full of myself. Then I'm not looking at this guy being like, well wait a minute. Someday I'm going to be dead 40 years. And then people go back and see the things that I said and am I going to like, I'm going to survive that. Um, all right, bill, I think you made your point.

Speaker 2:          09:49          All right.

Speaker 1:          09:53          You know, a lot of people think Abe Lincoln said, good guy. Apparently new evidence shows he went to a fucking Sadie Hawkins dance and a, he evidently he was fucking quite rude to his date that night. Four score it Hashtag four score and seven beers ago. Drink much. A boy, I dunno. Um, anyways,

Speaker 2:          10:21          okay.

But I, I hate the fucking document, my jokes tonight, so I want to thank everybody that she came out in Manchester, Glasgow, and a Birmingham. I had a great time and, uh, found out that I was not dehydrated. I actually had a little bit of a stomach virus. I can't believe it.

Speaker 1:          10:57          Oh my God. I, I just don't know if I'm, I'm just, I have to be going to the wrong places, but what they do to what cheeseburger over here, it's just like, as an American, it's offensive. I feel like it's, it's a one of our signature dishes.

Speaker 2:          11:12          Okay.

Speaker 1:          11:31          But I keep ordering them in hopes it's almost going to get it right. Um,

Speaker 2:          11:37          okay.

Speaker 1:          11:38          But anyways, he had turned out, I have a a, I had like a stomach virus now. I think I'm, I'm past it. Um, so I can give my all to my dick and shit jokes tonight. Uh, rest in peace. Luke Perry, uh, Jesus Christ. 52 fucking years old with kids.

Speaker 2:          11:59          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          12:00          that's a scary one man. And then the guy weighed like 130 pounds and I felt okay.

Speaker 2:          12:05          Okay.

Speaker 1:          12:06          And um, so now I'm on the Internet and I'm trying to fucking, you know, early signs

Speaker 1:          12:12          of a stroke and how you can screen for it and yeah, you can do this to screen forward, but don't do it too many times because the scan isn't good for Ya. And it's just like, so they had the, uh, all these lists here, like the top causes. This is for all old men like me. All right, you ready? Go. Top causes for stroke. All right, here we go. Come on hotel. Right is a hypertension high blood pressure. I was site when the doctor came and took my blood pressure, said I have the blood pressure, but 25 year old, he goes, do you work out a lot? And I said, I do work out a lot. High cholesterol. I don't have that, uh, diabetes. I don't have that central obesity. That means having a belly. I don't have that smoking. I do that. So that's the one I got to get out because I'm not living for myself anymore. I live in for the Kiddos. So, and I've come to this, this, this realization

Speaker 2:          13:16          of a,

Speaker 1:          13:19          of my, and I finally figured it out. I figured out what kind of drinking drink or I am, why it's gone off the rails. While all of a sudden it became this guy that needed to take breaks. And um, yeah, the big thing that I, how I fucked up was I brought it into the house. All right. And if I could give anybody any young man, young woman out there, fucking a yell and fucking transferring a humanoid, whatever the fuck you supposed to say. One of those tr words.

Speaker 2:          13:53          All right.

Speaker 1:          13:55          Yeah. Listen to this little clip and 40 years. Okay. We'll see if they take it down my fucking monument at the innovators of podcasting and the filthy wink at the podcast museum. Right. See if they don't want to take down my fucking golden statue with the fucking orange leaflet over my balls. Um,

Speaker 2:          14:15          okay.

Speaker 1:          14:15          You don't want to bring your vices home with you. Okay. You want to have to go out and get them. All right. So, uh, the where I fucked up his, I, I ended up having a booze collection at home and because I was buying some higher end stuff, you start to think, oh well I'll make a collector. I'm a connoisseur. No, dude, you're a fucking booze hound. So, um, I'm just gradually just given bottles away. I got some Pappy van Winkle, I'm not giving that away, you know, but I have some, a couple nicer bottles of things that cost me whatever, 80 a hundred bucks or but like to be, um, I saw my kids see my drinking. Okay. Obviously my kid can listen to the podcast, know what I was, but like I, so I don't want to be doing that. I don't want to be smoking cigars in front of her. I don't be drinking fucking booze, none of that shit. She asked me about it. I'll tell her what I did, I'll be honest with them and then tell how eh, how fucking stupid it was, how much time I wasted and all that type of shit. You know, I did have a good time, you know, whatever. But anyways, I just added some think it's a good look. You'd be sitting at home fucking uh,

Speaker 2:          15:25          yeah,

Speaker 1:          15:26          boots. And not that I've ever done that in front of the right way to, she goes to sleep. But there's been nights where I'm just like, wow dude, I am like you. Like, you know, rolling the dice here. Cause God forbid I'm down here legally fucking hammered. And what if my wife had some sort of medical issue? Now I'm drunk, I got to get my kid and my wife's, now I have, what do I do here? I got to fucking call an Uber. And all of this shit because I'm too drunk to drive. Or you might just call the fucking ambulance. I'm going to be standing there fucking hammered as somebody chest. Not a good luck. That's not stress. That's something a dad does, but not the dad that I want to be. So I'm getting the shit out of my house. Uh, I've decided I'm taking the year off and then next year I'll see what I want to do, but if there's anything that I want to do, I'm going to have to go out and go get it. Um, and that goes for the cigars too. Um,

Speaker 2:          16:20          okay.

Speaker 1:          16:20          I'm, I'm going to drastically cut that down and um, I don't know. But then I remember hearing this quote that said, beware of the man with no vice or something like that. Uh,

Speaker 2:          16:33          okay

Speaker 1:          16:35          man. With no vice.

Speaker 2:          16:38          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          16:38          Saying let's see what it is. What is this thing? Show me a man. Here we go. Show me a man without vice. Uh, where is it? Show me a man without vice and I'll show you one without virtue. No, that doesn't, that just sound like some dumb shit. A drunk would say at a bar.

Speaker 2:          17:04          Okay.

Speaker 1:          17:04          Uh, well he does in Jay's fucking doing something. Um,

Speaker 2:          17:09          okay,

Speaker 1:          17:09          so the man, let's see something here. Vices, vice quotes. I actually, I don't understand that. It's like, so if you live like a vizsla life, then you have no virtue. What is a virtue? What is the actual definition? So on virtuous behavior is showing high moral standards. So if you, if you don't have any low moral standards, you won't have any high moral standards. So if, if you're not fucking blowing a couple of rails, that means you're not going to help a fucking old lady across the street. Can't you be the guy who's not doing blow, not boozing,

Speaker 2:          17:53          eating,

Speaker 1:          17:55          you know, in a healthy way and being a family man and, and also be a good person. I don't understand that.

Speaker 2:          18:03          You know,

Speaker 1:          18:05          is it because if you meet somebody that's strong enough, is this just insecurity by bucking people that have vices? Um, cause I gotta be honest with a, via [inaudible]. If I can get rid of, if I don't bows and I didn't smoke cigars, I think that's it. That mass, what I do, I drink and smoke.

Speaker 2:          18:23          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          18:23          So now I'm not drinking. Since I've been over here, I've had one cigar.

Speaker 2:          18:30          Okay.

Speaker 1:          18:30          You know, I barely smoke. If I get rid of that,

Speaker 2:          18:35          you know,

Speaker 1:          18:37          then what? Jesus Christ. Well then the bill, you have the most boring fucking podcast in the history of podcasting, I guess.

Speaker 2:          18:43          MMM.

Speaker 1:          18:46          I Dunno. I, I got it. I'll figure it out though. But I, I don't want to be this guy just like, you know, I never have a drink or I never have a cigar. I just gotta get it out of my fucking house. All right. I feel like invited a vampire and you know, like I'm in the lost boys except with booze and cigars. Um, sort of, I'll do that. Then I'll just sit there and judge my wife every time she has a rosy, nice, nice example that you're setting.

Speaker 2:          19:13          Um, I gotta be honest with you, London, I'm loving it. You know,

Speaker 1:          19:19          I was never really a London guy was more Paris gay. I don't know what happened. Now I'm starting to like London a little better. You know, despite the fucking food, Jesus Christ,

Speaker 1:          19:32          Jesus Christ at the detail, the amount of places that they conquered with all these spices in know, I always heard that they brought them back. I could, God knows they're not fucking used them. I tend to be, I don't know where to go. You know, they've got too many fucking celebrities out here. All the spice girls does spice girls. Right? Where do they eat these? No Way. They put up with this food. There's no way. I know last time I came here, I went to this Indian restaurant that was fucking unbelievable. And I also went to the ivy the other night and I had the best shepherds five overhead. Um, so it hasn't been all bad, but I'll just tell him, oof. Everything else I've gone to marriage. It's like comedy club, Green Room Bad. Um, all right. But we get it. You don't like the fucking food? I, I'm sorry. So what's going on in the world of America? I miss the good old USA. Let's see what, when I want to go to search you s a news. Let's see what happens. President Donald Trump's serves fast food to another title team. Yeah. This is how broke we are after fucking these wars. Why does he keep doing that? Does he do this to anybody else? Let's see. President Donald Trump, the service food to another title team, North Dakota State now the championship football team.

Speaker 2:          20:54          Okay.

Speaker 1:          20:55          Oh, you know what? This is North Dakota state and there's a lot of white guys on there. He's still giving them fast food.

Speaker 2:          21:02          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          21:03          I'd love to eat McDonald's in the White House. It's kind of fucking cool. Trump welcomed the football championships, subdivision champions, the North Dakota State Bison. You get him some bison burgers there to the White House on Monday and according to a pool report, he served them a lunchtime spread, a big Mac chick filet sandwiches and French fries among other fast food items. Trumps served a similar meal to the Clemson Tigers while they visited the White House in January. According to the pool report, Trump told the biases that he couldn't serve them a meal prepared by the chef. But I know you people, several players laughed.

Speaker 2:          21:38          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          21:38          Oh, that he could have served them a meal prepared by the chef. But I know you people, several players laughed according to the pool report. A Trump said in January that he personally paid for Clemson's White House faced to face now because it's visit came in the middle of a partial government shutdown.

Uh, he's, the current president is born and raised in New York borough of Queens. He got an economics degree from the Wharton School. That's a good one. Yeah, I know. That's a good ones. I've never really heard of it, which means it's a high end. One was not on my radar to be applied to. He was appointed president of his family's real estate business in 1971. Look at that. He was only 25 years old and he took on that level of responsibility. Everybody else gets to go out to a fucking bar and drank, you know,

Speaker 2:          32:41          okay.

Speaker 1:          32:42          Sing some Karaoke. And he had to take over the family's real estate business. See everybody thinks these rich kids have it easy. You know,

Speaker 1:          32:51          you poor kids have no idea how lucky you are to be 25 and none of the pressures of a real estate company to take over the company built or renovated skyscraper skyscrapers, the hotels, casinos and golf courses. Trump later stated, various sites start at various side ventures including licensing his name for real estate and consumer products. Yeah, that's the genius. That's why when everybody's like giving the finger to a Trump hotel, it's like it's not really his hotel. Um, early life education. The conflicts of interest. I mean this, this is all here, dude. This is all what usually you have on a rich guys Wikipedia page. All right, let's get to the questions cause I got fucking special to tape here tonight. Um,

Speaker 2:          33:35          okay.

Speaker 1:          33:35          All right. What's the first question? Soccer playoffs. All right, so I mentioned, I was saying how weird it is that they don't have a play off play off in the premier league and how huge that would be. So evidently this person's going to set me straight as to why they don't do it. Bill, they don't have, they don't have soccer.

Speaker 2:          33:52          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          33:53          In playoffs they don't play offs and soccer's with the person metric, but they happened to have various cup competitions that add a different dynamic to the mix. When you think about, think about it, it's extremely stupid to have playoffs in the first place. Why would the most consistent and best team to top a table in any sport over the duration of a season not get recognized as the best team? Well, easily. Well that's easy. While in our world, you know, you have people just the way shit lines up who's in your division, you end up playing a tougher schedule than somebody else.

Speaker 2:          34:30          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          34:30          You know, and it also depends like when you play somebody, if their best player was hurt and then the other team comes to play him and that guy's player is back. You know what I mean? All of a sudden, you know, it's so just like you play a whole season and somebody one point behind you.

Speaker 2:          34:47          Okay.

Speaker 1:          34:47          You're the champion in there that I don't know. I like playoffs. And then also playoffs ads like this pressure.

Speaker 2:          34:56          Okay.

Speaker 1:          34:56          Where's the team that's supposed to, when all of a sudden feels this pressure and then they could choke and you have great stories.

Speaker 2:          35:03          Okay.

Speaker 1:          35:03          There's plenty of reasons to have playoffs. Um, so I don't think it's stupid. This extremely stupid. Well then why do you have the World Cup? Isn't that stupid? Isn't that a giant fucking planetary fucking playoff? Why isn't everybody just fucking stay home? Um, anyways, I don't understand this. Well, that's a cup competition. That's a different thing. So you're, you're, you're in the playoffs. As long as it's a cup, it's extremely stupid.

Speaker 2:          35:32          Okay.

Speaker 1:          35:33          I don't think it has. Anyway. Hockey is the only sport.

Speaker 2:          35:36          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          35:36          Uh, where I

Speaker 2:          35:38          understand respect the league structure because the Stanley Cup is arguably the most difficult tropey to win. All right? You're all over the map here, sir. You can maybe get away with half ass thing in the regular season to clinch playoffs, but you have a long way to go to hoist the cup. Uh, they actually have a playoff format. And in the English championship, which is the League right below the Premier League, uh, first and second in the table, automatically advanced to the premier league while third to six have a two leg matchup to get an a final for that third promotion spot. Oh, that's cool. So that's where you play off, sir. It's very exciting because there are millions of millions of dollars on the line with that final game playoff. All right, so now you like playoffs. Also offside is when the attacking player is passed the final defender at the point the ball is played. If you didn't have this in place, players would just cherry pick, get uh, all game. And the beautiful game would be a shit show. Rat Fest. Uh, come back to Niagara. Canada, take care. Um, I get that shit that you can't just hang. But my thing is is if somebody is going to run past you, yeah,

Speaker 1:          36:54          they're not just cherry pick and hanging down the other end of the field. If somebody is going to run fast to you and they're faster, you can just slow down and make them off sides. That's fucking stupid. That guys fast and then you, we beat you. That's my problem. I'm not saying that, you know.

Speaker 2:          37:10          Okay.

Speaker 1:          37:10          You know, look in hockey they have an off sides line. You've got to clear the fucking zone when the puck comes out. But like if somebody blows past you with the park, they don't have to fucking wait to you get into the zone.

Speaker 2:          37:23          Okay.

Speaker 1:          37:24          You know what I mean? Sorry. I know it sounds like I'm drinking. I'm just drinking a giant bottle of water, glass bottle. Um, fancy man as Jim Norton likes to say. Um, all right, well I get that sir. I don't think, I actually think that you actually enjoy playoffs. Um, but you also enjoy the premiere league. So now you have to say that it's extremely stupid. And of course, because you're from Canada, you get it in the hockey. You understand those playoffs. All right, sending food back. All right, this is what I wanted to hear from people, how you go about it. And he says, I'm a 28 year old male living amongst you and all the other narcissistic transplant concept decided they were too good for their hometowns and needed to move to this coastal Eden that we call Los Angeles and attempt to achieve a dream of creating career. Doing what I love. Parentheses creating slash playing music. Uh, well, sorry. If you wanted to play music for a living, you know, you probably would eventually moved to Los Angeles to get more in the mix or Nashville, don't you move where the industry is? Um, at any rate,

Speaker 1:          38:36          mmm.

Speaker 1:          38:38          I guess he's, he's to be joking that, that Los Angeles is an Eden. It's not an Eden. You had to steal water to try and turn it into a fucking Eden. It's a shit show that shouldn't be there. But it is. And what we've done with it is, is amazing. I mean, am I saying we now with Los Angeles, I've had been there that long. Um, at any rate being a musician, I worked a number of side gigs including waiting tables. I've waited tables at cheap joints as well as fine dining establishment. It's like award winning chef dudes. Oh, I think this guy was being sarcastic about uh,

Speaker 2:          39:10          yeah,

Speaker 1:          39:11          la.

Speaker 2:          39:12          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          39:12          Um, anyways, at any rate, uh, I think I can set you straight on sending food back basically. And maybe obviously the cheaper the restaurant, the riskier it is to send your food back. Great Point. Uh, when I work fine dining, you're primarily in a restaurant with a kitchen is actually open to the public. So sending food back is handled in front of the clientele and that's would never be subjected to being fucked with another great point. Uh, that being said, as you go down in price, typically not always, your kitchen is getting a little, little bit more hidden. You're employees are probably making less and on top of that, they're probably always, again, not always because I realize some cheaper restaurants are amazing quality, et Cetera, not as passionate about what they're doing. In that case, your food will possibly get fucked with. Okay, here's another person.

Speaker 2:          40:04          Okay.

Speaker 1:          40:05          Uh, hey Billy, sugar, tits. Um,

Speaker 2:          40:09          okay.

Speaker 1:          40:09          Never worry about sending food back with social media today. Any decent restaurant would rather you tell them then tell the world that that a meal was poor. If a dick.

Speaker 2:          40:22          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          40:23          If a Dick Ed works in the kitchen. What if a dick, he d like the name Ed of a Dick. Ed Works in the kitchen for Dick head. Oh, this person was texting and I guess there's some sort of weird, you get the capital thing in a space button. If at Dick had works in the kitchen, who's going to spit in your food? You can guarantee the kitchen's a Shithole anyways.

Speaker 2:          40:49          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          40:49          See you at Royal Albert Hall on Monday. Wait a minute.

Speaker 2:          40:53          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          40:53          never worry about sending food back. And then you end it with, if a Dick had works in the kitchen, is gonna spit in your food? You can guarantee the kitchen's a Shithole anyways. Meaning it doesn't make a difference cause what's already in the food. I don't know about that. All right. It's not making me feel better. All right. Formula e a Billy burnout. Uh, you mentioned on a recent podcast that the sports low between football and the start of Formula One, uh, March madness, NBA players, et Cetera, has you as you down, have you tried to watch formula e to fill the gap? I'm watching for the first time machine year and it's been great. I got the hiccups now. This is the all electric racing series. It's real easy to get up to date since the races or time to have a maximum length of 45 minutes plus one lap.

Speaker 1:          41:48          Um, the first four races this season are all up on youtube and there they are carried live on Spock's Fox sports two in the U s there is no team or set of teams that dominate like in Formula One and there's been passing Galore in every race. All right. I like this including a photo finish and the last race. So it's not about getting to the first corner and blocking for the rest of the race. There are no pit stops, but the team still have to strategize to conserve energy. So they don't run out of power. Sure. The cars don't go as fast, but the competition makes more, uh, more than makes up for it. In my opinion. Bonus is in the last two races of the seas. Seasons will be held back to back days in New York City in July. Oh Shit. I might be in New York in July chairs and go fuck yourself.

Speaker 1:          42:36          Well eventually I feel like those cars will be faster than the Formula One cars because I'm just looking at how regular cars are in the street. You know what I mean? Like they can make like what a Tesla is shaped like the fact that zero to 60 can beat a fucking Lamborghini. Um, I would think that if you applied that same shit to like a race car and absolutely no weight other than the battery, all it comes down to is it, is it, the battery is going to be later than the fucking engine. Um, and then you don't have all that bullshit under the car where air can get caught because you can just have that smooth fucking thing like they do underneath the Tesla. I Dunno. I would think that the cars are going to get faster. Right?

Speaker 1:          43:26          I don't know. I do think it's funny that people that aren't a gas combustion engines will think it's funny that they can only run them for 45 minutes and ignore the fact that the gas combustion engines also, I have to pull over and get gas. You know, it's also not a limitless energy source. What you got to have is you got to have solar power against somebody with a giant fucking solar panel duct taped to their fucking head, all right, and a giant magnifying glass above it. The driver dies every race, but there's no pit stops and can still go 500 miles. That's how I would do it. All right, baby name. He just get people on death row to drive, so then also they won't give a fuck. You know, if if this space and not to go into the corner, it'll be really fucking excited.

Speaker 1:          44:11          He had death row inmates with a fucking satellite, not a satellite of fucking what he'd done a strobe, I just said it. Solar panel on their head with a giant magnifying glass. All right? Right before they get in the car there, eat their lead, their last meal, whatever it is, you know, a little bit of hog and dose, the turn up and some fucking chicken, whatever the fuck it is they want, you know, and you'd get them in there and that's it. It's like, all right, and here's the thing, if you win, whoever wins doesn't get killed. Wait, no, because you'd already died. Oh, they got it. Yet somehow like if you, if you win, it's like the dirty dozen. If you win, like they let you back out on the street, Kellen, back on the street, the fucking murderers. I, no, it's gotta be something you can do. I don't know what, again, I does the heat. I don't have it all worked out. All right, baby named negotiation strategy bell, my wife and our and, and I are having our first baby. Congratulations. So baby girl. Oh, you hit the lottery and we couldn't be happier. Happier. The only issue is picking her name and negotiations are deadlocked. Here's the negotiation positions. All right. I'm going to tell you this before I go any further,

Speaker 2:          45:28          okay.

Speaker 1:          45:29          All right. Never tell your daughter about this,

Speaker 2:          45:32          okay.

Speaker 1:          45:32          All right. Whatever her name is, that's her name. If you lose all your wife loses on the debate, do not fucking bring that up to your kid. Whatever their name is. The name. All right. All right. My wife's tastes. The names could be best described as somewhere between Hollywood diva and in 1960s, flower child. Oh my God. Thank names like apple and moon beam. Uh, Layla like the Eric Clapton Song is their best idea to date, but it wouldn't be my first choice. No, that song's too popular. Um, I dunno. Waitlists not bad. I don't know. Okay. I would like to get my grandmother's name.

Speaker 2:          46:17          Okay.

Speaker 1:          46:18          For me. Co and old Japanese name somewhere. That's got to be a middle name dude.

Speaker 2:          46:25          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          46:26          anywhere. My daughter's name, she died before I was born and it would really mean a lot to me and my side of the family to get that even as a middle of the eye. That's a middle name too. My wife doesn't like the name fool me Co

Speaker 1:          46:41          uh, specifically she doesn't like the way it sounds and thinks it sounds too close to the word Fumar which you as a scholar of French, no. Is the verb to smoke as into smoke. Uh Oh. Uh, in French. No, I knew a rocket was something like that. Um, I am basically willing to concede the first name to get full Mikko as a middle name. Well that's cool because if the kids like half Japanese, I don't know if you guys are full Japanese. That's cool. So you get the little bit of that in there and the name. A lot of people do that. Um, anyways, he said, but I haven't gotten much headway in negotiation. Again, I am willing to concede that the first name be something kind of weird to get my grandmother's name, which is admittedly unusual but highly meaningful at as the middle name. I have two questions. Sorry. First of all, if your wife is going to go all hippy trippy dippy and then you know, you can't be like fucking,

Speaker 2:          47:48          yeah,

Speaker 1:          47:48          like wheat grass shots for me. Coach Johnson. Do you can't have that? I would think. Oh man, this is tough because I have to question how did you, when the lovely new Nia go about picking your daughter's name, what is my path to getting my wife to agree to Fomoco for me call as my daughter's middle name.

Speaker 2:          48:12          MMM.

Speaker 1:          48:17          I think, I think you guys need to stop thinking about ourselves and think about your daughter.

Speaker 2:          48:25          Okay.

Speaker 1:          48:26          Okay. As she's going to have to be this name.

Speaker 2:          48:29          Okay.

Speaker 1:          48:29          Somebody is going to have to say this name and she's going to have to be like, yes. Present. Okay. So

Speaker 2:          48:37          yeah,

Speaker 1:          48:38          I would just say to my wife like, listen, all right.

Speaker 2:          48:41          Okay.

Speaker 1:          48:42          I'm willing to concede for me all. Alright. But where she's not going to have some hippy, trippy fucking

Speaker 2:          48:51          fucking

Speaker 1:          48:53          white celebrity kid fucking name. Can't have that.

Speaker 2:          48:57          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          48:58          You're not naming this kid after an emotion or a fucking fruit or vegetable.

Speaker 2:          49:04          Okay.

Speaker 1:          49:05          It's just a fucking assets. Just a fucking asshole thing to do to your kid.

Speaker 2:          49:10          Okay.

Speaker 1:          49:11          It's so fucking self involved and it's so just like, oh, look at me, look how creative I am. It's just like, don't, don't you remember going to school, don't you remember those, those first brutal years, if there was anything even remotely different about you, you were going to get the shit kicked out of you. It's going to happen anyways. Why help the other kids out?

Speaker 2:          49:31          Why

Speaker 1:          49:33          the kids going to hate the fucking name?

Speaker 2:          49:36          Okay.

Speaker 1:          49:37          Um, anyways, so I would be thinking about the kid. I wouldn't be thinking about my own family and all of that type of shit. Just get the kid a fucking cool name. That sounds good, but the last name and just let your kid be who they want to fucking be. All right. And don't force your fucking agenda on them from day one with some fucked up God damn name. That's my 2 cents. All right?

Speaker 2:          50:02          Okay.

Speaker 1:          50:03          Um, all right. Lady asked me to not Burp at the gym.

Speaker 2:          50:07          Okay.

Speaker 1:          50:08          Okay. Uh, hey Bilbo saggy baggy jeans. Uh, I was at the gym the other day.

Speaker 2:          50:17          Okay.

Speaker 1:          50:17          Uh, in my building trying to get back in shape for this summer as I've been at Booz bag getting through this fucking winter. Anyways, I was on the elliptical, a nice brisk pace. Um,

Speaker 2:          50:30          okay.

Speaker 1:          50:30          Hundred and 85 Rpm is Jesus Christ and was listening to your podcasts actually. And there was one other woman on a treadmill, three treadmills away, uh, walking at a slight incline.

Speaker 2:          50:43          Okay.

Speaker 1:          50:43          And I'm guessing a speed of 2.3 and reading a novel. Oh yeah. That's not working out. Uh, my family has acid reflux. So sometimes at the gym when I'm really pushing it, I would

Speaker 2:          50:57          okay.

Speaker 1:          50:57          Inherently, lightly burp every few minutes. At about 25 minutes into my session, I hear something coming from my head phones and this late fifties, wish lady is waving at,

Speaker 2:          51:11          okay.

Speaker 1:          51:11          Me Out of my periphery. I looked over at her and move my earpiece away to hear and she said nicely, could you please not burp anymore? It's distracting me. Well Dude, if you fucking belching while running 185, I mean, it sounds like you're flying. Just run a Bra. Uh, I mean, what are you doing? You're in public. Um, anyway, Bill, the amount of rage I was filled with for such an insane requests was unfathomable. Well. How loud were you burping? You had your headphones on? She put up with it for 20 fucking minutes. He said, I thought about going to apologize to her, asking her name and giving her a fake name from myself and then telling the leasing off, see office, what a [inaudible] this lady was. What is with you young people just wanting to tell on each other. Did you want to make a video of it and then fucking uploaded? I just thought you guys are all just trying to get each other in trouble and kicked out of things. The fucking rat generation. Uh, I refrain, finish my workout and continued on with my day. My question for you is one, am I just,

Speaker 1:          52:24          uh, being completely, uh, am I just in just being completely flabbergasted by a lady walking on a treadmill, reading a book, telling me not to Burp when I have.

Speaker 2:          52:38          Okay.

Speaker 1:          52:38          Gerd, g. E. R. D. N. Two, what, what have you done in that situation to do? First of all, you know, how the fuck does she know that you have acid fucking reflux and stop acting like you have leukemia?

Speaker 1:          52:56          You know what I mean? This is this right here. This is what's wrong with, with with what social media did to the individual. You're in a public gym, you're belching. No one wants to listen to your fucking bourbon and you're a boozy fat fuck because of the winter. I respect the fact you're trying to lose the weight. You know? Maybe if you ate better, you wouldn't have these. This will fuck wants to sit and listen to you burp and it gives a fuck. She's over there walk and a half a mile, an hour with the book. That's her loss. She's not really working, but she waited for fucking 20 minutes. Feed a belt should out of your system and you didn't. It's fucking gross. No.

Speaker 2:          53:32          Okay.

Speaker 1:          53:33          No. I would take, I need a pack of fucking Rolaids and go for a walk around the block, but I mean you, you can't be like belching in public and then try and turn around and make yourself the victim because you got acid reflux. You know what if she was really gassy and was just farting the entire time?

Speaker 2:          53:54          Okay,

Speaker 1:          53:54          yeah. She says, okay, I am irritable bowel syndrome. Well, fucking, you know, go drink some of that pink shit and fucking go for a walk.

Speaker 2:          54:04          Okay.

Speaker 1:          54:04          They'll come in here and close the Goddamn door. Yeah. You're fucking gassy horror. I don't know. I don't want to tell you I, I'd say, yeah, you're in the wrong there, sir.

Speaker 2:          54:17          Okay.

Speaker 1:          54:17          Yeah. Um, no one wants to go to the gym. Listen to burping going 90 miles an hour and a fucking elliptical.

Speaker 2:          54:25          Okay.

Speaker 1:          54:26          And I don't, I don't care about your acid reflux and how it affects you as a person. Um, I think you need to take that into consideration.

Speaker 2:          54:35          You know,

Speaker 1:          54:37          why don't you just go get one of those TRX bands and just work out in the house? We can easily go for a walk.

Speaker 2:          54:43          Okay.

Speaker 1:          54:43          You know, it's better for the environment, all the energy, then an elliptical users. Let's go walk up the hill. He can fucking Burp to your heart's content. Then you're not bugging her. And she could sit there and fucking slowly walk to her grave while she reads the next Harry Potter fucking novel. Right. Does that work? Just didn't work for everybody. I hope it does. Um, all right. I am going to have to pull up a little bit short here.

Speaker 2:          55:07          MMM.

Speaker 1:          55:09          I apologize. I just have to, I gotta tape this fucking thing tonight and then I'll be back in the states. Might be a little jet lag. I know these last couple of ones, I've been a little fucking scatterbrain and jetlag that just been working a little too hard, but you know, after tonight I'm on the other side of it and, uh, hopefully I'll go back to, I'm not being as scatterbrained, just the normal level of scatter brain ish shit that I say.
