Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's the Monday morning podcast for Monday, June 2nd, 2014 oh my God. Is it really Jill? Yes. Yes. Uh, Tricia fucking June comes after me every goddamn year. That's right. The summertime is coming. You know, you, you, you just showed us started. You're going on your fucking bikini diet back in February, but you didn't, you got all wrapped up in your life. Didn't yell well, it's not your fault Tricia. What I pick Trish. I don't know why. You know what? Cause I'm sick of saying Karen and Cathy, I've got to fucking make fun of some other God damn names and I'll have the audacity to do it. Even with a name like bill, a nice generic fucking name. No imagination. You know,

Speaker 2:          00:00:50       actually I actually liked my name. I don't know what happened. Somewhere along the lines about in the 90s you know what I mean? Everybody started to have all these fucking, those names. George Carlin made fun of, right? George Callen, you know, Dakota and all those things, all those names that had to sound like a fucking canyon right now. All those people are coming of age and all of a sudden I saw my first, I don't know, I was watching some sport and they fucking over to a fucking Dakota assumpted and I'm like, am I that fucking old that somebody named Dakota is old enough to play a professional sport? I'm sorry. Anyways, I'm in a weird mood today. I uh, this podcast is actually late this week. I'll give you two cause it's not even Monday morning. You probably think of why bill, you're a fucking comedian. You're a bum. You don't even have a real job. How come you can't get your ass out of bed early enough to even record it on your Monday morning? Well, I'll tell you why.

Speaker 1:          00:01:45       Last night I uh, took the lovely Nia out to the Hollywood bowl and we saw Bruno fuck in March with the, for Ralph or feral and I have fucking says they Farell, the guy who walked by watching his set evidently wrote 40% of all hits in the last 15 years. I was just standing there as he went in from song to song, go like Jesus Christ, this guy, Yo, he wrote this song too. It's just him. I thought that other guy sang it and then my wife would be like, no, he produced it for him and it went all these grammys. He's kind of awesome.

Speaker 2:          00:02:23       I know he kind of was, he was out there with his big smokey, the bear hat. This one was red. Probably a special one because he's playing the Hollywood bowl. That was a great thing about the show last night and you could tell that both him and a Bruno Mars, we're really excited to be playing the, uh, the Hollywood bowl was great. They were just phenomenal fucking performers. And uh, you know, the only thing the whole night I would say was for rouse a backup dancers. They would dress like they was still at rehearsal. That's the only thing I didn't like, you know, I'm sure I

Speaker 1:          00:03:00       obviously they did it on purpose, but you ever watch one of those movies like fame or, uh, I dunno. Bill and Ted's big adventure. One of those fucking movies from back in the aids, the debt eighties. The fuck did I say aids? the 80s, the age 80. He VH one. Who got it? Who didn't? And who is surprised about the results? Um, the 80s. Um, what the fuck? You know, there was a bunch of those, those movies, Michael Douglas, all of those movies when they would be in rehearsal, right. And there'd be all these fucking smoking hot women dressed like they were going to paint their bedroom. That's how, uh, for Elza backup dancers were dressed last night. And um, other than that, I thought it was great. He sang all these fucking songs. I don't know. He sang that one with the guys who dress up like the robots, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:03:57       Yeah. Well I'm up all night to get lucky. I'm up all night to get sub debt. I'm up all night doing blow. Yeah, he's about boop, boop, boop. All right. And everybody's going nuts. And as a desk, go ball was a great fucking time. Great fucking time. And I take through the whole God damn concent. So we're sitting there and now I'm one of those people, I never see a nightmare can spot famous people all the fucking time. I never do. So we're sitting there, we got, we got great seats and uh, she hits me on the arm. She goes, oh my God, there's Henry Winkler and I look over and there he is, the fonts. Henry Winkler having a great time dance into Farell and then in between the break she fucking elbows me again is like, oh there's Tom Hanks, swear to God and there he is standing in the aisles. People are coming up to him and he's grabbing their phones and doing a selfie forum. He looked like he was running for office. He stood there for like a half a fucking hour. Like you know, my wife was go look at that. He's like the greatest. So he's looking, he's the greatest guy ever. It's like gag gift. Guess that's how you have a 30 year career. You have a 30 year career by doing exactly the opposite of what I do.

Speaker 1:          00:05:14       I can tell you this, after watching that man stand there for a half an hour as gracious is, is you could possibly be with anyone and everyone who walked up to him. Um, I can honestly tell you without a doubt that Tom Hanks does not have one drop of cont in him. He's just a fucking great guy. I already liked him and then I watched that and I'm like, Jesus Christ, you know, I need to work on myself. Guy. He's putting on a goddamn good shit clinic here at the Hollywood ball. So, uh, so now I'm like, Jesus Christ, these all these fucking people here. Neal's like, oh, there's Natalie call. There's this fog. Can I Eddie Rabinowitz? I didn't even know half the fucking, she's pointing out. So

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       I start looking around and I go, I look at that guy over there with the Jackson Brown hair cut. He turned around with Jackson Brown. He was not standing in the aisles. But does that make them a bad person? Maybe that's the Cantinas Tom Hanks because he does that now you're expecting every other famous person doing. Then when they, when they don't do it,

Speaker 3:          00:06:20       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:06:21       I bet all those famous people are just sitting there looking at Tom Hanks, staring daggers at him. Like, why won't he just sit the fuck down? He doesn't like doing that either. They're all fucking, um, and he's been out there for a half a fucking hour, you know, and then all of a sudden they all seem approachable.

Speaker 3:          00:06:38       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:06:39       I liked the handlers. There was a couple of handlers when they were down there to basically be a security person. Eat. What you have to do is you have to master the hand an inch away from the small of somebody back. You just sort of leave it there. You know, I don't know when, if they got like a fucking inner ear piece that dense says when they actually make contact with the lower back of the famous person to guide them through. But the thing is, is when you're, you're in the ready position as a security person, you have your hand in the small, like an inch away, right? Like you're warming your hand on a fucking fire, except it's some famous person's lower back. This guy stood there the whole fucking time and every once in a while he just sort of shift the person.

Speaker 3:          00:07:25       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:07:26       It's incredible. I Dunno how it was fucking arm didn't get tired. Just holding it like that. You don't have it. He has to do stretches. So anyways, so for outcomes out, it's like broad daylight. He's got to perform. Then I thought he did. You know, I don't know, just as a comedian performing outside in broad day light, to me that just says, oh my God, I'm going to bomb. And uh, um, I better get the check before I go out on stage. That's what I see. But he was, he was phenomenal. Um, and then, then Bruno Mars came out and it was a, I don't know, dude, I called it, Nia told me that she was like, you called it, you saw this kid like whatever, three, four fucking years ago you saw him on something and you will, I did. I was like, this guy, he's old school.

Speaker 2:          00:08:10       He's this song and dance man here. This is throwback. This dude can do anything. He's going to have a long career. The only thing stopping him is him. And he didn't stop himself from there. He was, and he put on a fucking unbelievable show. His band was awesome. His drummer was fucking sick. He introduced him and his as his brother, I dunno, I dunno if he, if he meant that in a cool way or we literally came from the same parents. I have no idea. Uh, but that guy was killer and then his band was fucking amazing. And uh, what I liked about it was that they were like, they were silly. They were having a good time and they were killing it. And there was moments during the show where they were fucking around trying to make each other laugh and shit. And, uh, I dunno man. It was just, it was an amazing show. And I also, you know, with each concert am getting older and older and I really should have, you know, like when you see a, uh, a performer on stage,

Speaker 3:          00:09:05       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:09:06       You know, and they just fucking old now and everybody says like, Oh man, he should just stop. She should just quit, hang it up. You know, put a couple of shirts on. If you're going to go out there, Jesus Christ, at least at a fucking treadmill or whatever they say, you know, we should just stop. You know? I think that that goes with audience members too, because I got to tell you last night, I can't even tell you how many times I had to sit down because just literally standing up for too long, my lower back starts killing me. And I remember sitting down at one point as Bruno Mars is on the stage and he's fucking sitting there going, ah,

Speaker 3:          00:09:41       yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:09:41       you know, hey, the fucking left side, the right side now down the center. And I'm just saying, if this guy sees me sitting down, right,

Speaker 3:          00:09:48       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:09:48       You know, I don't want somebody on stage see me sitting down thinking I'm sitting down, you know, because I'm not appreciating what they're doing. I almost wish I had like a neon sign that said, it's not your fault. It's me. I'm fucking old. And I was literally sitting there laughing as I'm drinking a water.

Speaker 3:          00:10:08       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:10:09       You know, like I, I was actually exercising rather than just trying to stand up for longer than 12 minutes that I sat down and I really thought about it. I was like, is it, am I too old to go to a concert? I, I, I think I need to retire.

Speaker 3:          00:10:22       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:10:23       You know, cause I'm getting to those scary years when you're older and you go to a concert and you just feel the need to put on a, I'm going to a rock show tee shirt. You know what those older white guys do? And they'll put on one of those fucking Justin Timberlake hats and you're wearing a tee shirt, which, you know, unless you kept you self and shape, we should never be out of the house with a fucking tee shirt on, you know, with your fucking man boobs. You know, look, I'm like be cups just sitting there and then you have some sort of bedazzled mint on your tee shirt to let people know that you still can rock. You know, you show up with those fucking genes that just say, I saw fucking Molly Hatchett back in [inaudible] 82 or whatever the fucking guys name is, right. Don't want to be that guy. And I'm, I'm not gonna lie to you. I saw a lot of that last night, which is just a testament to both of those guys, how talented they are because it really was everything from little kids, um, little kids to me and like 14, 15 all the way up to like, I don't know how old is Henry Winkler? Like 70. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:11:34       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:11:34       But anyways, and it was funny, it was a guy sitting in front of us, this old dude who was well into his sixties, I think, and he was part of that last of that generation. You know, those older guys from that generation that just always walk around with that navy captain's hat on. You know, some of them was because they were in the navy. The rest of them, I don't know why they wear it, but they just, maybe they have a boat. They just walk around with that fucking navy hat on. Um, he was of that age and what was killing me is I'm sitting there going, you know what? I'm closer in age to the fucking navy hat guy. Then, uh, you know, the fucking twentysomethings here, whatever. Anyways, it was a fucking great show. And so that's why the podcast was like, so he probably thinking like, wait a minute, bell, let's show. Probably started at seven o'clock. Meaning you probably left your house around six game seven Chicago, La Kings. That was at five o'clock. What'd you watch the first period and leave? No, I taped the game.

Speaker 3:          00:12:37       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:12:37       listen to this shit. This is how great it is to be a hockey fan out in la. I taped game seven of the western cons conference finals involving the Los Angeles kings and the Black Hawks of Chicago. I go to the Hollywood bowl. There's like, what? I don't know how many people is that place hold? 10 15,000. I'll fucking know. And I didn't have to worry about anybody.

Speaker 3:          00:12:59       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:13:00       Shouting out, going age two to one, two to one, five minutes in, rolling in it for me all. I did it with, all I need to do is shut up my phone so no one would send me a text. And, uh, I went to the concert, I came home, I watched the first period and if by that point I was like one in the morning and I was fucking tired as shit. So I went to bed and then I woke up this morning, but we'll do a little dude. And uh, I just watched the rest of it this morning and like an asshole. I didn't add time to it. I don't know why. Always had time. This is the one time I did and I just hit record and I left. So I didn't have the overtime. It looks like he scored about six. Alec Martinez scored

Speaker 2:          00:13:45       six minutes into the overtime. Uh, my condolences to all Blackhawk fans. Congratulations to all kings fans. And not to use the Cliche, but I'm going to go, I'm going to use it. There really are no losers in a Shitty, like of course, series a series like this. Of course there is, um, you know, because when you lose it sucks. But I gotta tell you, man, like if the NHL ever decided to put all seven games of that series on a DVD, I would be one of the first people to buy it because it was a, it was that good top shelf level hockey and all you fucking cunt to watch hockey. You know, you watch the gold medal game.

Speaker 3:          00:14:25       Okay?

Speaker 2:          00:14:25       You know, once every four years, you watch one fucking game. Just imagined seven of those, that level of intensity except even more cause it's actually for a real trophy. Okay. Then not play it for a fucking necklace. You know, with some bgs Medallian hanging off of it that play in for the fucking Stanley Cup. That's what they all want to win. They would never say it. You can't say that in public. What would you rather deal when the gold medal game for your country? Or would you rather win the fucking challenge that they're going to put your name on? It's a no brainer. F My country. I'm going to Nashville and I'm going to try to win the cup. Right. Least that's what I would think. Um, gives a fuck about winning a gold medal. Yeah. Unless you're like you're cross country ski with that rifle. I mean there's no way to go pro in that so that, that Chicago, you got to do it. But if you're actually professional athlete, right? You got a Maserati sitting in your fucking garage. You know, you've got some hottie jumping on your fucking Dick every night. Do you really? EMEA got fucking gold necklace. I go by what? You can't buy a Stanley Cup. Oh, show. You can make one out of cardboard and tin foil and stand in the crowd wearing in a jersey look like some giant fucking make a wish kid right now. That's not what these people play for.

Speaker 2:          00:15:56       This fucking series was amazing. If you get a chance, I don't know if nhl.com is gonna is gonna. I mean, I don't know. They have the highlights, but they usually, I dunno how you do it. I remember back in the days when I used, when I used to live in Boston, what was cool over the summertime was Nesson and that's a network over the summertime. They used to have these, these things called, uh, uh, some are cooler and over the summer they would play like the best Bruins games throughout the year. So the Bruins would always win the game. It'd be some dramatic victory and there'd be like a bench clearing umbrella and a big fight or something like that. It was great. The summer coolest. So I don't know if they're going to show it, but whatever. Um, I got to tell you this and somewhere along the lines, you know, I was rooting for the kings even though I still love Chicago. I rooted for the Kings cause they were the underdogs. And uh, but then I was also going man, Chicago Rangers to original six. I mean when's the last time they met each other in the playoffs? I mean the finals, I'm trying never in my lifetime as far as I know, seventies were a little weird.

Speaker 2:          00:17:01       We'll see. The Rangers got to the finals in [inaudible] 79 and they played the Canadians

Speaker 2:          00:17:07       and I don't think they got in the rest of the time. 76 was the fucking flyers lost. The Canadians savvy. Seven or 78, one of those was the Bruins. Too many men on the ice game. When Gila floor the fucking flower, um, scored on the weakest fucking wrist shot you ever saw. We nobody knew to go down in the butterfly. So to fuck we had was standing up in neck and he did like a little fucking flail that at with this fucking pad. Um, anyways, let me just continue one. Oh, by the way, remember long time ago I gave a lot of today's hockey players Shit because most of them hadn't even scored 50 goals. And then I listened to Dan practice. Uh, I recorded it because he had Wayne Gretzky on the great one. And uh, I actually listen it in Gretzky said that he would have a PR, he would have problems scoring 50 goals, how good and how big the players are now and how great the defenses are. So I will shut the fuck up about that immediately. Um, but anyways, yeah. So I started rooting for the Kings. You know, I've just liked that team for a number of years. I just like how they play and everything. And I just watched a bunch of games and I somehow became a fan and I was sitting out there this morning watching the rest of the game and somebody on the king's took a shot.

Speaker 2:          00:18:23       And I like when like, oh, like I freaked out cause he just missed it. Then they scored a goal and I flipped out and then Nia just looked at me.

Speaker 3:          00:18:31       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:18:31       And she just went, shame on you.

Speaker 2:          00:18:34       But did you abandon the Boston Bruins and just put me in this defensive on McKnight and abandon Moses out. You know, I'm a fan of hockey, I'm rooting for the king. She goes, how can you as a fan of Annie Boston team route for a fucking La team? It's like, I know, you're right. You're right. I don't know how it happened. You know, I actually was a fan of the, the Los Angeles Dodgers in the late seventies before the Lakers Celtics thing heated up in the 80s and that was just because they hated the Yankees. We can have a beat them. And there was the Bucky Dent Games. So in 77 and 78, the Dodgers played the fucking Yankee, so I'm not rooting for the Yankees. So I would really root for the Dodgers and I became a Dodgers fan. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:19:18       I love Tommy Lasorda right through when they beat the Yankees in 81, Fernando valance Swayla when they beat the A's, Kurt Gibson hobbling around, fucking pumping his fist, all of that shit. I was a Dodgers fan. And then, uh, then I moved out here and I went to a Dodgers game, you know, when I saw how cunty they're fucking fans are, they don't show up late. They got a knife to your throat. I mean, I'm exaggerating but not really, kind of has like a little sort of biker rally vibe. Um, yeah, I told you it's just, I'm a kings. Fans are more mellow though, but it's just not, it's, I don't know what it is about from fucking San Francisco on down out here on the west coast. These people take it way too seriously. If you have the Jersey of another team, I mean, it's bad enough when you do that in other parts of the country.

Speaker 2:          00:20:08       But this is the last fucking place I would come wearing the Jersey of an of the opposite team. There's no fucking way. No fucking way. I like where my nose is on my face. I like my teeth. I like my, my brain and swollen, you know, I like not having little, a extra breathing holes throughout my chest. And he called me crazy, call me a pussy. I mean, that's just, just, just how I am. You haven't one time from some fucking celebrity, you know, one of those, those Tufts celebrities, you know, they get movies and they played enough tough guys that they start to think that they know how to fight and save the world was talking about wearing um, another team's Jersey to a Laker game. They like, aren't you worried about blah blah, blah. And he's like worried about what? Like he says, bad ass.

Speaker 2:          00:20:54       It's like, fuck you. What the court side seats, you know, walking in and out of the celebrity entrance at the fuck a town car go where that and the upper deck. All right. Let's see if you live long enough to do the sequel to a I am cunt face part too, right? All right. Whoa. Jesus. Bill, you're in a mood. I am. I'm a little tired and then I ate bad already today. Oh my God, eight so bad. Do you know last week I got to mention this before I, before I do in the advertising was fucking hilarious. I didn't even realize I said it. I was talking about something. I said, I've got him. Such a Gemini I have never taken out of that might've been the most shit I ever took for anything that I said on the podcast. I must've got like, I don't know, like 30 or 40 I retweeted a couple. They, whoever wrote those, you guys had me dying laughing. Just, you know, like when you, you say something and you don't even realize how fucking a feminine it is until somebody brings it up and then it's just so bad and the jokes are so good. You can't do anything but laugh. I was like sitting by myself and the first one came in and this, I think that was the one who retweeted somebody wrote,

Speaker 2:          00:22:14       you know, I really had you, I don't know, something about the level of respect they had for me, you know, was that a high level? And then it all went out the window the second I said I'm such a Gemini. And then I got like, and I was just like, Oh fuck did I say that? And I kind of started laughing. Sarber tweeted that one and then I kind of scrolled down and there was like 10 other ones and each one was just more and more brutal. Um, so whatever. That's a shout out to ever fucking wrote those things because you guys gave me a great left this week. So, so why, why, why, why, why not just continue setting myself up to get trashed here. Um, you know what I did this morning, you know why the podcast is late? Because this morning I was making homemade cupcakes. I swear to God, frosting and all that shit. That was frost and cupcakes when I was watching the end of a game, seven Nhl game, the toughest man sport, arguably out there, I was frost and cupcakes.

Speaker 2:          00:23:26       You know what? I stand by it. I don't give a fuck how much shit you guys give me on Twitter because I know you got it because it's fun. But uh, you know, what do you want for me? It's my wife's birthday today. One of our favorite things in the world is a, she likes cupcakes with chocolate frosting, but out here they usually have the chocolate frosting with the chocolate cake. She likes the yellow cake with chocolate frosting, myself included. All right, insert interracial. Couple joke there. Um, so, and how I was, I'm sick of driving around trying to find them at fucking, and you know, every God damn bakery out here. I said, fuck it. I'll make some went out and bought a couple of trays. You know what? Let me tell you something about people make cupcakes. Okay. Fuck them. It's not that hard. It's not that hard. Actually took out my kitchen aid is the second time I used it one time. I used it for fucking Ah, look at all this product placement, nhl.com. Kitchenaid. I, she's got to start getting paid for this shit. Um, so I fucking, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:24:30       I took that thing out for the first time a couple months ago and I made some homemade pasta and a, this is the first time I used it when I was actually bacon. It's the shit. It's like having an assistant that you don't have to fucking pay ever things over in the corner just doing the shit. You don't want to do. Stern it up as you're doing some other bullshit. And I gotta tell you something dead delicious. And everybody who wanted the wants to give me shit. I'm going to tell you right now, if I shut one down your pie hole, you, you'd have to say, God dammit. Bill. It's a good cupcake. I got to give it up to you. I don't respect you anymore as a man. That's a good God damn, uh, cupcakes. So, Hey, get into the Stanley Cup finals here, the Stanley Cup finals. Uh, I picked Chicago to winning it all wrong.

Speaker 2:          00:25:17       I crushed the first round. You know when the number one was playing the eighth seed, I called those all day after the fucking second round. I mean into the second round after the first round is what I'm trying to say. I have, I've just been horrible. Um, so if I pick your team, you, you should be nervous. So right now, range of fans and kings fan supposed to be saying, if you believe in that Mojo fucking Voodoo shit should be telling me to shut up. Well, you know what, I'm not gonna. Um, I thought the Canadians were going to beat the ranges and I thought the, uh, I thought Chicago was going to beat the kinks. Obviously neither of that happened, but I'll tell you who picked it perfectly was Joe Barton. Nick, Joe Barton. Nick said Kings in seven gangs the kings one in seven games add Joe Barton. Nick. All right, getting off. You want to, you're going to give a little tippy a cap. Go to add Joe Barton. Nick on the Twitter, on the Twitter APP thing, whatever the fuck you call it. And I have a listen to a Joe Barton. Nick has his own podcast. It's all hockey talk. It's called puck off. Um, and uh, have a listen to whatever the guy, the guy really knows his shit and he's as big as fucking Cam Neely. So there you go. Um, anyway, so who am I picking in the finals? I think, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:26:36       I actually love both teams. How fucked up is that? I love in New York and an La team. I don't love the fans, but I loved the team and uh, just watching both of them throughout the, the last series, I don't know how you can hate either one of them, but I got to go with the experience and I got to take the fucking La Kinks, you know, two great goaltenders you know what? And I say bet the over and all of these games, cause everyone's gonna think Johnathan quick and fucking, uh, whatever the fuck his name is suit wherein Lundquist said Henri Henrik, whatever the fuck you call a, they think that there's going to be low score and I don't think it's going to be,

Speaker 2:          00:27:16       I think they get to run into them. I think doesn't make a lot of goalie masks falling off, you know, and there's going to be some upset, padded, bearded gentlemen on both sides of the ice going, what the fuck? You know? Um, I just think it's going to be a great series and uh, good luck to both of you. I'm watching every second of it. So this is your last series. If you're gonna ever going to watch hockey. Well, I make you want you to get an October, but you know, whatever. Come on man. Jump on the fucking bandwagon. Have a good time. All right. Um, okay, what else? Oh, let me do some advertising.

Oh, I almost forgot to thank everybody who came out to the Improv in Arlington, Texas this week. I had a great time performing few guys getting ready to do my standup special June 20th at the Tabernacle Theater in Atlanta.

Speaker 2:          00:31:45       Tickets are on sale right now. Um, both shows looking like they're going to sell out. So I want to thank everybody that, uh, spent your hard earned cash to watch me go dance around and tell my jokes on the 20th. I'm really looking forward to it. And, um, I had a great time in Dallas, as always, big fan of Texas and um, and most of you who listen to my podcast know that I am a huge fan of, uh, the discovery channel show fast and loud, the gas monkey garage guys. So, um, I'm like, I gotta go over there, I gotta go check this place out. And, um, I went over to their garage, they got a gift shop over there with all these tee shirts and stuff. And um, you know, fortunately enough, the, uh, the owner Richard was nice enough, he was out of town. He had a few people over there take me around. And, um, I just, I just had a great time. I saw the cars. It was ridiculous. I came walking in the back total fucking fanboy, right. Actually nervous as I'm walking in there, I'm such a fan of the fucking show, right. And, uh, I come walking in the back and then there's like all these guys that I've seen on the show and, um, long story, fucking short, long story short, I, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:33:04       I got to, you know, I got to see all these cars, some of the cars that they're working on, upcoming episodes, I'm not going to ruin anything that's coming up, but they're working on some of the coolest cars that they've had since the beginning of the episode. And, um, and then as I'm walking out in the parking lot and there's a, that army green f 100 that he has Frankenstein or whatever they call it, a lot of you guys who are fans of the show, watch them, you know, Redo that truck. And, um, I guess since they did it, he put an even faster engine in it. Long story short, the guy over there, Jason, was giving me the tour, who was really nice to me the whole weekend. Um, he goes, hey, you want Casey to give you a ride in that truck? And I'm like, man, I don't want to bug the guy.

Speaker 2:          00:33:49       Of course I do, but I don't want to bug the guy. I don't to be some fucking jerk off. I already met the guy. He didn't know who the fuck I was. Right. So it's not like I could be like, Hey, I'll give you one of my fucking stupid standup DVDs if you get, I had nothing. I was just another jackass walking in there. So he was cool as hell. He goes, yeah, I'll give you a ride. So we start driving around the block in the truck. He's talking to me about the truck and all that type of shit. And we get on this straight away. Right. Thank God they didn't film the state. They wanted to film it, but they didn't have any batteries in their camera. They will stick one on the, uh, the windshield. It was the fastest fucking thing I've ever been in. He just lets out the clutch and it just,

Speaker 3:          00:34:30       wow.

Speaker 2:          00:34:32       We start flying down the street. I can literally feel the back end just ever so subtly going left to right because there's no weight in the back. And, um, I felt like it was in a drag racer and I was trying so hard to not freak out and not be a pussy, but I'm not gonna lie to you had to put my, I put my foot up on a fucking dashboard cause there was no seatbelts and I'm feeling this thing skating in the back. So we just go down the street.

Speaker 3:          00:34:57       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:34:58       I fucking faces contouring and then he slows down

Speaker 2:          00:35:04       and I just go, Jesus fucking Christ. What are you trying to give me a heart attack? And he just, you know, it deadpan humor just sort of laughs and he goes, uh, yeah, that was second gear, second gear. We're going like 70 miles an hour down this little ass fucking road cars parked on both sides. Um, it took, it literally took me about four hours to come down from probably the three seconds that we would drive in that fast. But uh, I got to do that. How cool is that and how cool are the people at gas monkey that they actually took time out of their day to let me do that? I'm a huge of the show. I went over to their bar, they got their own restaurant over there. It's like the number two live place to play music now in Texas already or in Dallas.

Speaker 2:          00:35:46       They just passed house of Blues, the fucking crushing it over there. So, um, I dunno if you get a chance. I I man, I asked all kinds of Geeky fan questions too. I'm trying to remember some that won't ruin any episodes. They get like 400 emails a day cause I asked them like, how do you guys find, how do you find all these fucking cars? I know Richard, Zoe, Sam, I'm going to go on the interweb and blah blah blah. They get 400 emails a day of people with these cars that they want to sell. Either they don't want to handle them or the person who owned them passed away. And, um, man, you should see I got to shut up cause I don't want to ruin any of, so thank you to Richard Rawlings for hooking me up over there. Casey for giving me the ride and uh, Jason and his lovely wife Linda giving me the tour and everything.

Speaker 2:          00:36:36       I just had a great, great time and I can't wait for the next season. So, uh, if you don't watch it fast and loud on discovery, look at that. That was like a fucking 20 minute commercial for him. Um, all right, let's, let's move on to the, uh, to the questions this week. Ever so slight. Where are we at 36 minutes in. Okay. Uh, solar panels. Last week I talked about, I was thinking about maybe getting solar panels off my house, off my house on my house and uh, I dunno if I want to go off the grid, but whatever the city of Bacon in the sun in his fucking house, I might as well get something out of it. Right. All right, so here we go. Hi Bill. First off, huge fan of your comedy podcasts. Thank you. I saw you perform a Brian Regan oh with Brian Regan cubs comedy.

Speaker 2:          00:37:20       While that was a, that was a bucket list night for me to be able to perform it. That guy show was absolutely hilarious. Well thank you and thank you for Brian Regan to um, anyway, regarding your question about solar, there is no solar power that is completely off the grid. You use all the energy that you can provide through solar and the rest that can't be provided by the sun like at night or if it gets shady on your roof. The utility provides, this is called interconnection. Uh, you save a ton of money and you use clean energy in the process. I worked for a solar company, I promise this isn't a bullshit sales pitch and I managed the construction timeline so I've learned a lot about this stuff. Here's the link to my company I worked for. We install a lot in la and in Boston as well too.

Speaker 2:          00:38:05       I think we're in like 12 different states. Anyways, thanks you for the awesome podcasts and you know something about this Psoas Shit. This, every person you talk to says something different. I watch people on Youtube make up a solar thing. Um, what a solar thing. Put up their solar panels, broke down how they worked and uh, and how you could get off the grid, but it was really, really, really fucking involved. Sky's digging a God damn trench. I can't even know what the fuck was going on, but I'm just like, all right, I don't have room for a trench. All right. My little piece of property here so I don't, you know, I got room for a whole, does that work? I can't even know what he was doing. They dug this translation stuff like a fucking top in there.

Speaker 3:          00:38:50       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:38:51       I don't even know what the heck. I can't even tell you what, what's going on. But um, I will definitely, I'll definitely look into it. Um, hopefully I'll have more luck with you guys and the fucking concept. Put the roof on this house.

Speaker 3:          00:39:06       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:39:07       Fucking assholes. I told you what they did right. They put the roof on the house and then like the drain pipes, because it's an old house, old stupid design with a drain off was it goes down into a pipe that actually goes into like, uh, I don't, I have like, uh, my attic is actually ever see, seen John Malcovich or being, being John Malcovich. Remember they had that floor, we had to walk around, bent over. Like that's basically how much space there is between, um, the ceiling on my top floor and then the roof. I don't even know what the purpose of it is. All it is is just try it just traps air that gets heated up and causes my house to be hot. But anyways, that's what it is. So the drain off of the water on the roof goes into a pipe that goes in, into the fucking crawl space and then back out the front of the house and down the side. So you take water from the roof, you bring it into the house, it's inside a pipe. But nevertheless, you're bringing into the fucking house and God forbid that pipe bursts or you have some fucking moron who disconnects it when he's putting the new roof on and forgets to hook it back up

Speaker 2:          00:40:21       and then tries to blame it. Not yet. He blamed it on mobile, you know, the fuck it all the blah blah blah. And I'm just sitting there going, all right, this is at least a year in court. You know what? Why don't you just get the fuck Outta here? I'll just put in a goddamn claim. You can't. That's what I did cause I didn't want to go to court. So, um, anyways, I'm hoping you, you're better than those guys. I mean, how couldn't you be? All right. Here's my favorite one of this week. A solar roadways debunked. Um, I got a note from my guy here, Andrew says, a ton of people forwarded the same link as the one in the email below. I watched this, so you don't have to, it's 30 minutes long. Basically he bitches about costs maintenance and the efficiency is efficiency of the perks.

Speaker 2:          00:41:03       Advertising original video, like heating, repairing the road. Yeah, I actually watched the first 10 minutes of it. Um, I'll save my opinion until I read this. Uh, Yo Billy, the sunburn kid. I know you were pretty pumped up about solar roads to be honest. So was I, but someone's smart sat down and crunched some numbers and brought up points is why as to why solar roads are economically in tech, technically not feasible. It's about 30 minutes long. So if you got some time to kill in any airport, check it out. Well, you know, sir, I watched the first

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       10 minutes of it. Uh, he didn't debunk them. He just brought up a bunch of questions. He's just like a road has to be durable and I would have some questions about, I mean, they showed a tractor run over the tiles, but it was a small tractor and they only did it once. Um, I, I would like to see how these, you know, these things hold up when it's wet out and you need water to run off. And he just brought up a bunch of fucking questions. You know, he didn't debunk them. He did basically, basically what he did. It's like 50% what you have to do. You can't have somebody just come in and, hey, these are brand new roads. Can I make them? Oh, okay. You think they're good, you think they're going to work okay. I mean obviously you can't do that, but it's 50% that, which is smart.

Speaker 1:          00:42:23       You got to ask the right questions. And then the other side is anytime he tried to do something new, there's always people saying it's not going to work. You know, and this guy in his half hour, I'm sure he brings, he brought up a number of things that would be a problem. It doesn't mean they can't work. Okay. So I don't, I wouldn't say they were debunked. I would just say somebody asked a bunch of fucking questions and rather than just one, what he does is he just throws it out there. It's like, why don't you contact the people at the solar road who tried to make the solar roads and actually get some answers and get some fucking, uh, or maybe order some tiles and tried to do some experiments yourself rather than wasting people's time with the half hour of questions and speculation. That's basically what it was. So I wouldn't say that it was debunked. Um, but you know, you throw up three pointers for half an hour, some of them are going to go in even if you suck. So I'm sure a couple of his concerns were true, but uh, you know, I mean, look at electric cars

Speaker 1:          00:43:21       since way back in the day, people who are, they show up, they're fucking up. Like people actually question the power of electric electricity. It powers the entire fucking city can light up a whole fucking city. And I get a Prius and my own mother, my own mother is going, can it go up a hill now mom? I just got to get out and start walking. It's great for my weight. And look at that. They sell, they're underpowered and their this and their that. First of all, the Prius is not an electric car. It's not even a fucking 50% electric car. It's like an 8% electric car.

Speaker 1:          00:44:02       That's what it is from like zero. I've told you this Gus, for years from zero to seven miles an hour, that car runs an electric power and then switches over to gas for the rest of the time. And if you drive with a lead foot, you're going to get maybe 25 miles a gallon. But if you listen, if you listen to the engine, okay. And you don't stomp on the gas and drive like a fucking maniac and slam on the brakes, you can get, you know, I don't, I wouldn't say 40 miles a gallon. Yeah, you can get like 35, but it's great. Perfect

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       car. If you live in, in the city. I absolutely love the fucking thing. So anyways, so you had that, I bought that thing in October of 2007 and now look at these, these Tesla cars. I actually wrote in one of those, uh, the end of last year before I wrote in Casey's fucking truck, Jesus Christ, which probably gets two feet to the gallon, especially the way he was driving it.

Speaker 4:          00:44:55       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:44:57       Those Tesla cars are fucking amazing. And you can drive from last I checked from San Diego, all you have to Vancouver.

Speaker 4:          00:45:05       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:45:06       You know, they have recharge stations from San Diego. All we have to Vancouver. And I think recently someone just drove one across the country. So it's not like that guy in the speculation video. Um, I'm, I got to look that one up or you should look it up or whatever. But um, I'm actually, uh, I'm leaning towards that fucking thing. Thinks bad ass. You walk up to, when you turn it on, like the door handles are flush against the car and you walk up and things pop out. I'm sure why the cars do that. But I never seen it, you know, it was cool to me. The only thing I didn't like about the car is it, it has like a supersized fucking iPad right in the dashboard. Um, and that just seemed like that would be really distracting for somebody like me. I need like a shade just to sort of pull that thing down. But um, I'm actually thinking of maybe getting one. How's that kind of like the idea that they just sorta one price. Like you don't go in there and there's none of that haggling. Um, so you don't feel like a pussy when you walk out. Cause I don't give a shit how many fucking videos you watch. You still get your ass handed to you. Um, but either way. Let's bring in the birthday girl. Hi Neha.

Speaker 2:          00:46:09       Come on in. Got to bring in the birthday girl over here.

Speaker 4:          00:46:14       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:46:17       Just trying to find something that she can relate to. NBA. Oh, Bill. Not asking you to rat for 20 minutes. Oh, there we go. The lovely knee. Everybody happy birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you will be birthday dear Ni. Uh, happy birthday to you. Yeah, sorry. That was beautiful. It was in its own sad way. Um, how'd you like your cupcake? I loved that. There you go. You made me a cookie. My favorite kind of cupcake too, which is very sweet to put it with candle, candle Roman candle in it saying yeah, happy birthday. It was very nice thing. And you didn't wash shit in my face. I did it. All right, well happy birthday a whole bunch more that you made. So you know. Well that's the thing. All my recipes, p's and q's suite on. Well the thing is is all my recipes come from my mother. So they all serve like 10 people so well a cupcake recipes

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       are going to be for like they made more than 30 yeah, I stopped after I went to rounds through what did I make, what does it, was it, was it six and a tray or eight and the tray, there's like 18 to 20 of them out there. Well nobody makes one cupcake. So yeah, any kind of recipe is going to be, why didn't you just make, make like six six is perfect. They never think about like they don't, they never think about the lonely people when they make a cookbook. Well, the thing is you could put the batter in for six and cook the six and then freeze the rest of your battery and just have it for the next time you want to make cupcakes. So it's not like it's a complete waste, but all right. Who's going to give you the exact measurements for like one or two cupcakes? That's, that's silly. Well, you know what? I think that'd be a great idea for a cookbook. What cupcakes for one? The loaner. The loaner cookbook or just single? Yeah, like when you're fucking single sitting there trying to do the math. You know Zay serves eight. It's just like, I'm fucking 22 I'm trying to make spaghetti over here.

Speaker 1:          00:48:36       Why don't they just make what? That's why you have left. But the thing is, that's why it's good to have leftovers. You free is a shit and you have it for later. Well it's not, it's not bad now because you can go on the Internet. Like today, I'm sitting there looking at that fucking cane sugar and they're asking me in the bag, it says two pounds of cane sugar and they wanted a certain amount of ounces and I'm sitting there and all they have is like a quarter cup. So I go, I was like, how many cups are in a pound? And they're like, well, cups is more of a like a uh, size. Now the size, what is the word? Like a, like a did. They couldn't figure like it's not a weight cup is not a weight. It's more like a fucking handful kind of looking at it like that.

Speaker 1:          00:49:17       So what I actually did was I took out one of your little sports fucking things that you drink out of that has ounces on the sides. So the protein shakes then yes, that works. Yeah. Well that's why the, the thing was a disaster once I got out. It's like a bakery exploded in there. Yeah. Lauer everywhere. Yep. Mix thislike kicked on the countertops and on the floor and it's ride little white puddles. That's right. You're like a little kid. Whenever you make something, you make that biggest fucking mess I have ever seen. The kitchen is a disaster. That's why I like it. You've got like stains all over your apron. You know, you're sweating a little bit. You're Harry. You're like what? Stepping around and your socks in the kitchen sliding around in flower. You're all like stressed out. You're all red in the face.

Speaker 1:          00:50:05       I wasn't stressed out. You weren't sets at this time, but other times you've made stuff. It's been fun. That's when I have learned to stay away. Here's the kitchen. No, no. Here's the thing. That was, that was the younger me who flipped out all, no, I flip out a year ago. Quit going for the joke. Come on, I'm getting better. Um, yeah, and also back in the dead. Didn't have a neighbor. You've got to have an apron. Yay. Bernie fans or don't mess. He just laid it out on the front of them and you just keep marching forward. Leave the casualties, bind. It's fucking phenomenal. Um, it was delicious though. I really appreciate it. And your gifts were amazing. Of course they were killed it. That's birthday. And of course I did. And you know what? You know I killed it because you always figure out what I'm going to get you is.

Speaker 1:          00:50:49       I just played like I was a moron. I really hate that though. And can I just say I really, you drove me crazy with that yesterday. You were driving me nuts. You were actually mad at me. That was the oldest trying not to be, but you were really pushing my buttons. You were trying to make me mad. See that's the thing you're toying with me though. Huh? You know exactly what I'm talking about. I emailed you something like a month ago to say, Hey, if you're wondering what to get me for my birthday cause I know you're busy. I know you're on the road and all this other stuff. Look at you and help you out. I'm telling you what I want also, you know it's like I'm not like a little kid. You know what I mean? I got to tell you exactly what I wanted.

Speaker 1:          00:51:28       Like give you, leads you in the right direction. What a little kids say what? Say what they don't want. Why mean you know, there's a little kid as a breadth of you're like, hey, I have a toy, get out of here, beat it. But when you're older set, what happens? Like specific things that you know, maybe you'd like to guess. He let people know. My parents asked me all the time, what do you want for your birthday? What do you want for your birthday? Because nobody has time to sit around and like figure out what you want. So you know now what I did this year. But that's what you did because you took what I wanted and then you kind of riffed on it and you've got a bunch of stuff to surround. No, it was, it was wonderful. But my point is you made me cry like, Hey, you still took credit.

Speaker 1:          00:52:04       You took what I said and then your riffed on it and I didn't actually will listen to you this year and four months ago and I figured out what the fuck you wanted and then you did your usual thing because you are an organizing. You like you, you're an organized person literally to the point that you're organizing. My shopping for what I get you now, one of the great things about giving somebody a gift, it's the surprise where they're like, they like me out to brunch and you're like, all right, I gotta get you home cause I gotta go shopping for your birthday. Like the, how's that supposed to make me feel? I'm sitting there like, uh, okay. This is why. This is why I did that. Because you emailed me something. I knew you wanted this shit. Okay. Now if I just went out and got it for you, I mean, why don't you just fucking, even when the, when the mailman comes, he hands it to me and then I throw it at you.

Speaker 1:          00:52:50       When you're sitting there, it takes no fucking imagination whatsoever, right? So I knew you wanted it. I knew I was going to get it for you, but I'm like, how the fuck is it still a surprise that she gets it? So what I did was I acted like I wasn't an, I already knew the other things that I were going to, I was going to get. I knew where the hell they were. I waited to the last second to get it. She thought I was like a an unthoughtful jackass and it worked in his life. Fucking sharp. Why would you buy? Why would you make yourself seem like you know a last minute jackass like that? Like why would it just to torture me and I'm telling you what torturing me because you cannot just give me the gift and be like, here you go, honey.

Speaker 1:          00:53:27       You have to have some other little thing where you throw me off my game. You give me all in a tizzy and then it's like, oh wait, he actually did the perfect thing. Why? Why do you play those songs? That's exactly what type of things that you accuse women of doing and you do it to me all the time. This is why, because when I don't do that, you get exactly what I'm going to get you and it's fucking annoying. Fucking and I wrapped something. You already know what's in it. You make me feel like an idiot. Why do you feel like it? Just cause I guess what it is. Guess your peak. You look that time when I came, when I went Christmas shopping. Oh my God, yes we are. Yes we are told you not. See what you brought up is when you know you're going to bring up a good point with your woman and she immediately starts trying to talk over you.

Speaker 1:          00:54:13       I do the same thing. Yes, he too. So I'm pulling up in the car. You knew I was going Christmas shopping for you. I'm getting out of the car. I opened the hatch back to our sweet, innocent little hybrid. Right. I take the bag out that has the name of the fucking store and I glanced and I glance over at the house and you're standing there like a specter looking out the window. My fucking heart. My heart like jolted. When I looked up, you know you had a creepy look on your face. You were doing something sneaky. No you weren't. And then you didn't see me. Can I show you? Can I show you what you were doing? All right, fine. This is, this is what you were doing. I looked when I, I'm looking at the house and I look up and you would like this.

Speaker 1:          00:54:57       Nobody can see me. So what you're sitting there looking like some weird like stalkers. That's what you were doing. No, I did it. Yes. As you were doing, you're a spoiled Brat and you, you, you wanted to see what was in the spoiled Brat. Alright, you're spoiled. He's spoiled me. Oh God. Blaming the victim once again. Now here's the deal. No, that's why I did it. I like to try to surprise you. If I'm going to spend all my fucking money on, on some goddamn thing here, I want you to, I, I want, I want to throw how much money it costs for you to get in my face. You didn't have to say how much it costs just by saying, if I'm going to say, am I really gonna lose this? I'm not going to lose this one. It's my birthday. It's like, oh yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:55:41       Oh my God. All right, let's go. Let's because yeah, because it's like a sport for you to figure out what the fuck I got you. It's annoying. I never tried it for you to always throw me off my game. You know it's a sports for me teaching you how to use a microphone. Just talk into it. Oh, okay. There you go. You couldn't hear me before. Well, I hear you and then you're over here. No, you only go over here when you're mentoring somebody else. That's what you do. Or when you go lady. There you go. That's all it is. That's the mic technique. There you go. All right, we're going to talk NBA here. Nini, the NBA, the NBA National Basketball Association. A professional league. Now with basketball, I know what it's like. Soccer.

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       You use your hands but not your feet. You can't kick the ball. It's reversed. Soccer. I'm swearing when I'm going to possibly know about the MBA. But anyway, let's, let's go ahead and read it. Well, I mean I have to read the questions here. Okay, there's, there's no penalty and just tapping out on what NBA bill not asking you to ran for 20 minutes on this. Cause I know not everyone cares about basketball, but seriously, the NBA, the NBA is so rigged. How can announcers and former players not be up in arms? Lebron got three files in the first quarter. I Hate Lebron, but Christ's let's have a fair game. I think the trick is to watch shitty teams and hope shitty teams make it to the playoffs. So there's no incentive to Suede the momentum if the raptors played the jazz and the championships. There's no superstars, uh, help or to help or to penalize it.

Speaker 2:          00:57:16       Yeah, I mean I think it's, look at any sport, the top players definitely get preferential treatment. I mean there's the Tom Brady rule is, there's all kinds of shit that goes on, but I just, you know, that's one of those ones where look, I mean they make more money if it goes more games. I, I, I just feel like I've already said what I said. Okay. I'm not going to keep reiterating it either you believe it or you don't. I know for years, I said it was fixed and then they found a mobbed up ref, you know, who was actually fixing games and fuck the Sacramento Kings out of a series against the Lakers and the Lakers went on to win a championship. They literally affected who the fuck won the championship that year or this guy did. And then everybody, when I was vindicated and I was right just when lag.

Speaker 2:          00:58:02       Ah, it was just one guy. It's just one guy. I think it's in their best interest to have the stars of the big teams in the finals and for it to go more than four games. Okay. And I think, you know, those reps get paid by the game, those fuck in arenas, you know, more games, more concession, more tickets, more commercial, more money. So, and I think that, uh, that plays a fucking roll consciously or subconsciously. I'm not saying that they sit down, I just think that it's fucking, I just, I, my thing I'm done saying it's fixed. I'll just say that the reps have way too much power and they have to stop dictating the tempo of the game. I would like the players, you know, I would rather have that. All right. There we go. But either way don't blow in Lebron's ear even though that was funny as fucking hell.

Speaker 2:          00:58:52       Did you see that? This guy on a, on the fucking Pacers, I forget his name and not a big hoop guy. He blew in the bronze. Yeah, there was sitting there. I think they were both sitting there. You know when you get your hands on your knees, I don't know if they're waiting for the jump ball or something and he was sort of not quite perpendicular to the side of Lebron's face, but he just sorta went right into his ear. And what was funny was it took Lebron for like half a second. Then he sort of smile and shook his head like

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       so it didn't have the desired effect or he was hoping he was going to get like when will Smith slap that guy who kissed him? I think he was trying and then get him off his game. Lebron James. Well, I mean he's like a, he's like a fucking x man out there. The guys that Goddamn Superhero, although I got to tell you, I get so turned off by the NBA. I don't understand what all this screaming and yelling is after of you make a basket. What do you mean screaming you like they're excited. Like they're like, no, like they're mad at somebody. You can't see the yelling. Just looking at the crowd yelling. Lebron James took the ball when coast to coast like I've seen my entire life. He's not the first guy to go coast to coast. He dunks the ball and when he's done he first walks and he starts glaring at the crowd and then he's going all the way up to sideline.

Speaker 1:          01:00:12       No, I mean what he's saying is he just like all hyped and like, yeah. Yeah. I like would they always hyped, which you always hyped. You give, you gave a high five. He's sitting there screaming and yelling, thumping his fucking chest. They're out there acting like that. It's like, dude, you put a ball through a hoop. I know you will. You're the one of the greatest to ever fucking did it, but you, you're not Jordan. I never saw Jordan do that. He doesn't have to be Jordan. He's limping on. I'm just saying why I don't like it. I'm not saying he can't do it through Kevin Garnett. I swear to God it's like he has Tourette's. He does any of these walking up to the line like talking to himself and every other word is fuck. You can clearly see that the guy say and fuck and I don't understand why.

Speaker 1:          01:00:58       It's just, it's, it's bizarre. Every other word out of your mouth as fuck, you know, but I'm not on fucking T. Oh, I guess I am on TV. Yes you are on TV and oh no, no, no, no, no. That's, I'll tell you why this is different. That would be like if I told a joke and then it killed and as the crowds laughing and applauding, I was standing up there, go to the show. It's stupid. I just do your job and shut the fuck up. It's stupid. That's the difference. All right. That's, and that's why my, my thing is I can't like, like your, your applauding yourself. You're more if I can't even get to the level of amazement that they are about themselves. That's what turns me off about the fucking game. You ever read catcher in the Rye, Nia? Oh my God.

Speaker 1:          01:01:50       Fucking catcher in the Rye analogy, you always make. I'll tell you why, because the catcher in the rye, that's that dead fucking thing when he sees that great piano player, but the guy knows he's great and he's making that face, that Ge Smith thing and it's just like, yeah, dude, you're up your own ass right now. You don't need me and I'm not going to sit there and watch your fucking Jerky self off after you just did something that a bunch of other people have already fucking done. It drives me. It drives me fucking nuts and all I know is that little kids see it now and then they're going to be doing that. Even go on a little kid's games and they've got to fucking take like a diaper shot. Then he'd go, yeah, high pitch voice coach on the fucking thing and I'm going to say they're going to want, I'm going to want to throw a hotdog.

Speaker 1:          01:02:28       Them really are an old fogy now with your complaining about how these young kids go out there and they're thumping their chest and they're just go out there and do your job. Yeah, I mean I look, there's definitely an element of that. I'll even take 60% of that, but 40% of it as I'm writing. What are you doing? I never, Magic Johnson never did that shit. Jordan didn't do it, but they talk shit to each other occasionally. You know, there'd be a second you didn't turn around glare at the crowd like, like, like you just fucking diff painted somebody on planet Krypton and then fucking go down the side, scraped up, screaming and yelling. That's where the camera's though with this crazy. Maybe it's, maybe it's for the cameras and maybe it's, you know, you know when the crazy homeless guy gets on the subway and just starts yelling and then you just look down at the floor, go and please don't pick me.

Speaker 1:          01:03:18       Please don't pick me. Don't look at them. Those are the rules. They are they doing it for the clips when they do like the commercials where they play the music and stuff and they show all the clips in the game and they show the guy's like, yeah, like looking out at the crowd. Maybe it's for that. Of course playing up to the fucking camera. They all hang out with each other on the same fucking yacht and go, hey, let's all jump on the same team and then we'll become a dynasty. And then you know, then the, the announcers who make money announcing the NBA so they're never going to criticize it and then they just say the saved, I'll tell you what are you getting a breath of Magic Johnson aura or Michael Jordan because they are accomplishing the same thing on paper, but they're not doing what those guys did.

Speaker 1:          01:03:58       And when those guys did it, you did it through the draft and maybe a blockbuster trait. Okay. There was way more cerebral back then. How you had to put it together, team, you had to lean way more on your fucking scouts. He didn't have a bunch of players all jump on the same team and then you jump on this team. Okay. He jumps on this fucking team and becomes like this three headed fucking monster just stopping on all these other goddamn tea. I mean, well why don't I just watch it go fucking go play a bunch of kids, a high school team. I mean I know it's not that bad, but it did that. That's what's killing it for me. Okay. Yeah. You know it was funny. You're not even a sports fan or whatever and I said why she called me in for this one we've been wanting, I call you and you said you, I'm on the podcast. Yeah, cause I know I am wanting to talk about other things. Not the NBA.

Speaker 1:          01:04:49       All right. Office bitch. Oh is that it? Is that a good one? I, it sounds like something that you would want me to just because it has bitch in it. Like, oh, that's good. A ladies a billion in here. Okay. What is it saying? Well, this is how long you were unbelievable. I just did the NBA. That's a guy topic. You didn't like that one. So now I'm giving you a lady talking to add this one. I want to hear this one. I'm with you. I'm like, yeah, you didn't sound like you were you selling, get back pedaling. Okay. All right. This guy writes Billy Parmesan and then writes Palmer. John like, I don't know how to read. Yeah. Why? What do I say? Tommy John as John [inaudible] permission, the lead farmers. John, I'm Italian and very much so at that I speak Italian and I'm first generation Italian.

Speaker 1:          01:05:34       Ciao. This guy, Italian prego. Prego. Vino Vino. I work with the girl who claims she's Italian, but she really isn't at all Hashtag Middle Easter. Um, I mean, how does he, oh, I mean, her grandmother may have fucked a Sicilian. Oh. Or She's all of garden Italian, you know, less than one 16th. Italians are not fucking around about who's Italian. It's not, it's high. And then if you're Cecelia, that's like a different thing. Yeah. You guys don't play with that. They don't fuck around the same way gas monkey does not fuck around when they build a car. I told them that story right in Casey's truck. Jesus Christ. Um, anyways, in the office, she's constantly, uh, calling me and a few other Italians, guineas and Gumbos. She says it like she's one of us and most times in a manner that really forces it into the conversation. Like, hey, Gainey's don't grease up my stapler.

Speaker 1:          01:06:29       Now I'm not completely insulted, but the catch is she's black. A year ago she complained to the human resources that a coworker who had listened to rap music on his headphones at lunch would mouth lyrics that weren't meant for him, I. E. The n word. There really is no proof that even mouth the words because he sat facing the wall and all she knew was that he was listening to Jay z's new album at the time and assumed he mouths all the words, none of which were audible by the way. Um, how do you know this if you weren't there? Um, so one day last week she was calling us dumb guineas and asked if my friend Leonardo yes, that is his name. If he could ring out his hair over her. Oh my God. Cause the place she ordered from didn't give her enough dressing. The Garner Salad. Wow. Wow. That is a funny joke though.

Speaker 1:          01:07:20       If you're, if you're cool with somebody, that's fucking hilarious. Uh, the funny thing because those are the rules hardly offensive if you're not, if you're not. Yeah. Cause that's one of the things if your friends, if someone was, you know, some Italian guy was breaking my balls would being a pasty freckled cunt. And then I came up with that ring your hair out over the salad. I mean that's, that's fucking, I might have him for the week. You'd have to come back with the, I don't know what the funny thing about the situations that Leo doesn't have greasy hair at all. Oh yeah. I mean it's a huge stretch of a joke and a stereotype. It's hacky and not even insulting. The insulting part is that she thinks nothing of it. I know what you're going to say. This is one of those things. You just got to let go. But I didn't, I stood up and said, listen, you're not Italian if you're Italian than I'm black because I'm Sicilian and we've all heard the true romance speech. That was the end of it. Did I handle that right? Cause I sure as hell wasn't going to let myself become, I'm an HR whore. Uh, thanks for listening. Um, I think

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       you did the right thing because I know you don't want, why don't you go first name? What do you, what do you think?

Speaker 5:          01:08:21       No, I actually think he did the right thing to, cause the girl says she's Italian, but you say she's black, but like dis meaning like she looks black, like she looks like me or like she's actually has said I am black and Italian because maybe she's biracial or whatever. So I mean the whole thing about she's not really Italian, Duh Duh. That's why I was laughing at how Italians are very, you know, protective about who can say they're Italian and who was not. So she might be biracial. Right. But the thing about it is, you know, in this country they have that whole like, what is it, the one, eighth, whatever, drop paper bag test, all that kind of shit where it's like if you've got a drop of black blood in you, you're black. That's the way it's considered in this country. That's the way it was set up in America.

Speaker 5:          01:09:08       So maybe that's why you're feeling like you're not even Italian, you're black. So that all aside. Yeah, for her, I'm making a joke saying like dumb guineas and Goombas and stuff. Like if you're offended by it, you should definitely tell her. I'm offended by that. I know you said that you were Italian, but I just, I find that kind of speech, you know, offensive, so please don't say it around me. I don't like that. And I think that is better. I had to think it is better to confront the person then running off to HR. You know the whole thing with the guy mouthing the lyrics, the Jay z's album, and he was facing the wall like, listen. Yeah, unless you were there. I mean he probably had a conversation with this guy. That's why he's coming at like that. She said I was melting the n word and she couldn't even see me. I used to too. I mean, but is a, here's the thing. Here's the thing. This is the only sheet. This is the deal. She sounded a little nuts, right?

Speaker 2:          01:09:56       And this thing, all those jokes are funny. If it's done the right way and she's not doing it the right way. And if she look, I think if she came to this guy and said, hey, I'm whatever, one, eighth, Italian or whatever, and talked about Italians in a respectful way, um, that this guy would embrace her, that she would, that she, her Italian blood, and then they would have this bond where he'd be like, oh that's the Italian in you see I knew blah blah. If you come at them that way, if you start going, hey, if you day go fuck good,

Speaker 5:          01:10:27       right, right. Quick Grecian up the floors, all the whole thing about, give me some of your hair cause I don't have enough. I got to tell you, layer it the fuck off money. I can't, I can't read that without laughing. Yeah, it's fine. It's fine. But now it's, it's, it's wrong. I'm going to say that especially if she's going to turn around and be upset that someone's listening to rap music in their headphones and Malbec word that don't, boards that aren't four years. Yeah. JC, we'll take JC, we'll take your white money. You'll take your white money. Those lyrics are not for, you know this, I will,

Speaker 2:          01:10:57       you and all your friends can finance my next big purchase. But these lyrics are not for you. What is the rule on that? Can a white guy in his car can sing log?

Speaker 3:          01:11:08       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:11:09       right to the rap music. I'm not going to tell you what are alone when I'm not there.

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       I can't. What do, what is, what would you say as an African American is the protocol if you're singing along? I mean, it's just a song, you know, sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy. Are you allowed to say the end of the front end, but then what? Rap Song? So somebody has already singing a song. Okay. You're on a bus, right? It's a terrible day for your knee. You're on a bus. Oh, Jesus. What are you going? What happened? Um, as long as I'm not in the back, I'm all right. Um, so somebody's got their little fucking iPod on right? Or phone thing, whatever. Right. And they're singing to the songs, right? And the first song they sing it is that, you know, sunshine on my show and you laugh and like wow, this guy is singing out loud, he's singing off key. You kind of laughing to yourself, but he's got his iPod on shuffle. Okay. And then the next one is that Wu Tang Song,

Speaker 5:          01:12:09       right? And he's singing along to old dirty bastard, tried to run game on a WHO's buck wild and he starts singing along with that. I think you should do it just the way you did it. Do it the way I feel like the silent listen when I went to go see Jay z would you get mad? No, but at this, this is a good example of that. Once it goes, see Jay Z and Kanye the watch the throne at the staple center, you know the whole stadium arena full of people, all black, white, whoever, and everybody was singing along to all the songs and it wasn't in the context of it. It was like, yeah, cause it's not like the white people are going to be like, Ooh, I can't. It's like we're all singing along. It's all enjoying the music is not a big deal.

Speaker 5:          01:12:51       So if there's a big crowd of people singing the n word, like is it different than the white person who's like trying to show you how down they are and they're like all in your, what do you call it again? Appropriating the, what do you call it? Oh, cultural appropriation. Yeah. Yeah. If you're like a white person that was like, yeah, I'm down for my niggas. You know how we need to do with it and I'm going to look at you like you're fucking crazy. I want to do that tomorrow because you know it, it's, it's, it's ridiculous for you to do that. But it used to shock me in New York when I would hear these kids that were seemingly, now I'm like the guy that wrote in, not black but like Latina, like, you know, Dominican or Puerto Rico, Puerto Rican, and they call themselves Niggas all the time. And I wasn't aware of that when I first moved to New York. So I was like, what? And then I just realized he had made, they do that too. I remember that it was okay for them.

Speaker 1:          01:13:43       I remember when I was at in and out Burger [inaudible] sitting outside the one on a sunset boulevard and I was sitting there and there was this dude, I think he was Mexican, which once again he's probably Middle Eastern. They get, they get, they get mistook for everything. Mexicans, no Middle Eastern people. Oh yes. It once they, once they get out of the stereotypical, God dammit, it's 110 degrees out here. I'm going to wear this robe thing when they just start, well, when they know I'm talking to Middle Eastern people. Okay. Once they, once when they were Americanized fucking clothes, they can go, oh yeah, cause they're, then they're just brown. I knew, I knew a guy for years. I thought he was Italian and it onstage, he was pretending to be Italian. Right. And it turned out he was Lebanese. I had no idea. No idea. You had the fucking, you know what?

Speaker 1:          01:14:39       Isn't there another famous comedian who kind of had an Italian persona and it turns out he's actually Jewish. She, I don't know. Nia Is there are fucking set me up here. All right, let's go to a, here we go. A dear Billy goat. I was listening to old some old podcasts and a, you are sharing your feelings on movies you'd recently seen. What was the last movie theater experience you enjoyed? I mean, the movie itself, not all the necking net that goes on in the back row. You old bloodhound. Oh, he's using those old words. Just this is just him acting like I'm fucking old. Um, all right. The movie in the theater all, I probably would, I would have saw it with you. I'm not a big wolf was the last one we saw in the theater. Oh my God. Which I hated. Hated.

Speaker 1:          01:15:27       Hated. Hated, hated. I got to tell you this, it was worth seeing Leonardo's the actress that played his wife, Jeez, Margot Robbie. She's gorgeous. She's Australian. Did you know that? Uh, no. I just, you know, oh, she was like, you know, what was great about her was she was totally naked and she's still within that. It didn't look dirty. She was just, she was a goddess. Gorgeous. Okay. I mean, yeah, when I look at her. But did you like the movie? That's what he wants to know. Was your, your the last time you were in a movie and really enjoy the movie itself was uh, I don't, I can't remember what was done in the movie theater before that because I feel like we very rarely go to the movie theater. I what did, we must have saw something since then. Move walls from the walls of Wall Street.

Speaker 1:          01:16:17       I have to see again why? Because it can suck another, my thesis, it wasn't that bad. It was definitely law. It was too long and it was like repetitive. It's like I get it. These guys are drug taking assholes. How many more scenes of this do we need? And it's like, I appreciate the chemistry between Leonardo Dicaprio and Jonah Hill, but it's like, all right, already he just, you know, Scorsese just let the camera run and run and run and run. And I will say that some of those sales meetings, dammit, we're so long. I started to feel like I worked at the company. I thought that they were, they were kind of, uh, in real time, they were really trying to hammer home the fact that these were just these underhanded, dirty kind of excessive eighties guys. And it's like, we got it. The opening shot was them tossing in the one we live in this world now.

Speaker 1:          01:17:06       We get who they are. You know what I do want to see? I want to see the, I don't know how to say it then I say, yeah, let's go. So I kept saying male, Male, a fuss. I just kept seeing Malan. Maleficence that's not a word, right? It's the name of the character. It's the name of the evil queen in Snow White. That's her name. Is it Latin for something? I have no idea. Alright, dear Billy goat. I was listening some old to some old podcasts and you are a shift. Read that. Oh, you fucking crazy. I didn't even, I didn't even realize that. Ps, I love the x men. He says, and uh, please remind listeners. Oh,

Speaker 3:          01:17:42       oh,

Speaker 1:          01:17:44       oh, okay. Hey, this is just my, please remind a family listeners that which family member would you fuck dilemmas are hacky and won't make it to the podcast? Yeah. Why would you even ask a question like that? Because some people want to have sex with a fucking family member and they want to feel like they're not alone in this world. They do. I don't know. All right. Oh, they're just doing it's, I hate those weird leg. Would you rather fuck your mother or fuck your dog? Like what I talked to even put out a doubt. Well, depends on the fence on what kind of dog it is and how much fight does it have in it? A dilemma. Would you rather give up blow jobs for the rest of your life or cheese? Cheesy. Cheesy. Of course you'd give up. She's absolutely, I give up cheese at fucking less dairy, less stomach aches.

Speaker 1:          01:18:37       I wouldn't get bound up. Less bloating. Wait, do I get more blow jobs to doll the cheese I don't eat. Does that go into the more blow jobs he goes, this includes the fake cheese like cheese whiz or Mac and cheese. Dude. I fucking hate that. She's, that's, that's why I can, I can never get on board with the Philly cheese steak that have the whiz on it. If that stuff, that was the perfect name for two whiz as an pis. Like if cheese took a piss, that's what it is. She's Wiz. She's Biz. Yeah, it's fucking gross. I wonder if that's why they call it that, but maybe it's who do you know what it is? It's probably some process shit. Something is scrape it off the top of the bottom of something. Yeah. You know, for years we will throw on this out.

Speaker 1:          01:19:18       Then we added a little something to it and all kinds of preservatives and salt and stuff so it can stay in that little aerosol can for that longer than you live on the food chain. It's below the hot dog. Cheez whiz. I mean cheese was, I mean that's like that's there with fluffer nutter that's in there with like, I mean cheese fluffer nutter mellow spread. Like it's like yummy toxic waste. It's just horrific. Like that's the kind of shit you eat and your body is just like, what the fuck is this? Yeah. Where do we put this? And it just like that. It's trans rat shit. Like it just sticks it wherever. It can put it twice to spread it out through your body. Yeah. I'm not into Jesus. You'll, you'll never see it in the house. It's not something that I'm into so you don't have to worry about that.

Speaker 1:          01:20:05       Okay, good friend. Did you talk Kim and Kanye is wedding. Alrighty. What I thought maybe you were talking about Kim and Kanye is wedding. I don't know because I want to talk about that. They already bought topical stuff first. They already have a fucking kid, you know stupid. What do you mean? What's stupid about it? You already had a kid. What do you what? So now what? We're getting married so I can be like, oh my God. Hey, I'll soon before all you already have one. It's dumb. It's dumb. You talking about, I'm saying, are you saying that people who leave the kids shouldn't get married if they're not married? No. They should get married. If they want to but they shouldn't make a big fucking deal out of it. Oh, but this is Kim and Kanye were thought that was such a waste of a castle there.

Speaker 1:          01:20:49       Now let's, they had there. They did. They do it at first sight. They had their dinner like they're, they're like rehearsal dinner or whatever ever Psi. And then they got married in this old castle in Florence and I have to say, I don't know, I'm looking at the pictures, which is hilarious because they're supposed to be so private and we're not selling our pictures everywhere. People magazine is like practically a guest at the whole funnel. This cell until one and then all your books. Yeah. Yeah. Which I'm what do you think they're going to have to divorce that parliament in London, but I'm looking at the pictures. I got it. I don't know. I think they look, they look really happy. It sounds so cheesy, but it's true. I'm like, I was good. I was very skeptical of it, but I have to say they look super happy and I thought I was going to be all I rolly and all the pictures and the time smile anymore facet he that's the thing is smiling and all those pictures they, I mean of course it's also for the second car accident when he got the that that the thing going there.

Speaker 1:          01:21:54       Yeah. He always has like a, the the bitch, the bitch base, his resting phase is bitch face. Like when he doesn't move it, he's just kinda sitting there. He looks angry like that. He just has that. You kind of have it all when he has, you kind of had that resting phase where you look pissed off. I definitely have that, but my job doesn't look like it's made out of like the same jar of like the tin man. You're like that. Those rural robots, the initial ones you make with, they just sort of, he yeah, but they had is jargon all broken so it's going to be a little weird. Oh that's right. And then he wrote a song about you, one of the studio and made a video about how awesome he was that he was in the studio with survives. That he had a wife that he had a jaw wired shut. Yeah. Oh man, you gotta film this. God, I can't believe how awesome I am. That's when I literally started feeling old is just the absolute fucking just, I mean, I don't know if it, cause everybody started doing yoga or whatever. Just the self blowing, blowing, blowing, blowing. That's just goes on like where it's just like [inaudible] people are amazed with how fucking amazing they are. The second they get to that fucking level, I just, I can't watch it. It's just, it's gross. You gotta be your, your,

Speaker 5:          01:23:06       your own cheerleader though. You know what I mean? You gotta be your own hype man. Doesn't mean you gotta be an arrogant ass. That's very true. Yeah. Look, you fucking negative shit. I'm getting nowhere. I can't do this. Then you got, fuck this. I've got to do something positive. I've got to go to the gym. Come on, Bill. You can do this, but blah, blah, blah, blah. That doesn't mean I've got to have a look on my face. Like I just conquered a country by myself and start yelling at people. This is really, I just feel like this is kind of ironic coming from a man whose job it is to stand on stage and make people laugh, which is what I do. But it's also a part of it is like giving your own opinions about stuff and sort of like, you know, this is how I feel.

Speaker 5:          01:23:44       And of course it's for labs. But I mean, I'm not saying what you and Kanye do or they die one stages. I'm a moron who doesn't read, who has add, right? If you really listened to it, that's all I'm saying for an hour. No one ever thinks that about you though. No, they just seem angry Leprechaun. But the thing is, you know what you're talking about how he's hyping himself up and he says he's so awesome. Like, apparently at their wedding he gave this speech and he said like, Kim is like a work of art and the Kardashians are like this amazing brand and they're like the future. He just gave this whole like he is so into them and her and her family and that whole amazing brand. That's a compliment. That's a compliment now. Yeah. Yeah, he did. And it was saying that right up there with coachees and yeah, because of how, but the thing is though is he, is he completely wrong?

Speaker 5:          01:24:35       Because they turned her little like z list status sex tape until like this million dollar industry to the point where they're like [inaudible] their wedding lot. Not saying they're not successful at it, so their brand is huge. I'm not saying, I'm not saying that they're not a huge brand. Oh, you're saying they compliment. If you're saying it's a weird thing to say at a wedding, but then you're complimenting a family or an amazing brand. I can see you guys whoring out all other aspects of your private lives too, too will listen. He, he himself has said he's not the greatest speaker. You know what I mean? Like the way it comes out, it doesn't always come out the right way, but for a family who's trying to be a brand, you know that is a big, huge compliment. And I tell you something just got up and I'm not trying to be a dick here.

Speaker 5:          01:25:28       Oh God, what do they do? What exactly do they do? Everybody always asks that question. It's a valid, what do they do? They have a TV show. They have various fashion lines and cosmetics and the whole like sort of like, I know what they have. They have retail store. I know what they have. They do, what did they run? They do, they do. They are the faces of their businesses. So they are reality stars. They are reality personalities who have then transcended the reality genre and to legitimate million dollar businesses including clothing and et cetera. And they, you know, that's in their spokespeople for various brands. The, all those pictures of them come at a Haagen, Dazs dogs. We would add around Paris that they came out of Haagen. Dazs is paying them for that so they get money. Just to hold an ice cream cone, which I'll take any fucking day of the week. Take [inaudible]. You know I can does, if they were like Bill Barr hundred thousand dollars you and your wife come matter Haagen daas holding an ice cream now you wouldn't do it though.

Speaker 2:          01:26:33       Cause then cause then I then you become then, then, then, then everything you say I, I've, I'm, I'm still of that. I'm still loved that, that old school thing

Speaker 3:          01:26:43       where, look

Speaker 2:          01:26:46       this, this was it. This was after I've come to this point as far as what I think selling out, it's selling out is not something that the fans decide. So I shouldn't, I'm not even a fan of this, but as an observer of them, I shouldn't say whether they sold out or not. It's, yeah, I really think it comes down to the performer and basically selling out is when you don't want to do something, but you do it anyways because of the money and then afterwards you feel fucking horrible to me. If that's what you feel like at the end of it, then, then you, you sold yourself out. You did.

Speaker 5:          01:27:20       I don't think selling out, doesn't it? You, I feel like selling out isn't even a real thing anymore. I just feel like that's an antiquated concept is that I feel like there's no, the idea of selling out, I don't, I don't feel that it really truly exist anymore. There's just different platforms for artists to make money and you know, your time can come and go very quickly. So if you can get $100,000 for holding an ice cream cone and getting your picture taken, is that really gonna like keep you up at night? Like I can't believe I did that for the money, you know?

Speaker 2:          01:27:52       No, I'm not saying it's going to, I'm not saying it's not going to, I'm going to say with some people it is and some people it isn't.

Speaker 5:          01:28:01       Yeah, but you're, you're very, you're, but you are, you're very particular about where you choose to do any kind of advertising and stuff because you care about stuff like that. So I understand. Look,

Speaker 2:          01:28:11       I, I mean I do like advertising on this podcast. I'm not against it. I'm not saying that. I mean love Jesus Christ. To me, that's how this whole fucking business, I mean I got to advertise for my shows and that type of thing, but it's, it's like anything, it's like, hey, I like to drink. Then there's a point where you've drank too much and you're making an ass of yourself. There's there, there are limits to everything. I'm not, I'm not gonna sit here and be like, oh, this is like I'm doing this grassroots thing. I'm not saying that, but what I'm saying is like, just that, that whole selling out thing, I think it still exists, but it's, it's up to the individual. So I would never say that somebody, if I see somebody do a commercial, they sold out, it would have to come from them.

Speaker 2:          01:28:57       It has to come from them where if they did it and then afterwards they're like, oh my, I was in all these great movies and next thing you know, I'm standing there doing a cell phone fucking commercial. And when I saw it, I just felt like, what did I do? What did I do to my image? Because this whole fucking game, you know, is, is constantly trying to stay ahead so they don't fucking pigeonhole you. And then also not stepping on a fucking landmine, which is doing a bad movie. You are putting out a bad special, there's all these different landmines that you try not to step on. But um, I def, I think that there's, there's all this, there's definitely ways that you can sell out, but like the younger me would, you will, you know, I bonded that whole Bill Hicks thing of like, you know, you do do a commercial, you're off the artistic role call. And I was hardcore believe in that. And then by two, you know, just getting older and it's just like, no, look, it's, it, it all comes down that gets your career. You do

Speaker 1:          01:29:55       what you want. Look, there's people out there, I mean, does commercials for proactive but so do a lot. It's like did he didn't want and Katy Perry doesn't want a lot of them do that whole, I had acne and it made me feel really bad about myself and now I am proactive and now I'm happy again. And this is the thing, they can all afford proactive. So you're basically just going there to get paid, right. And you're going to stand there and the Holden hall closer up to your face. Now to me, that would make me want to go jump off a fucking building. Okay. I felt weird when I first started doing advertising on this thing, but what I, what I tried to do is like, oh, at least like, I'll try to make these things fucking funny. But um,

Speaker 2:          01:30:29       against taking like, you know, um, advertising, right?

Speaker 1:          01:30:34       Money, I guess if you really believe in it, like the shit that I've, I've read on this stuff, the stuff that I believe in, right? I fucking read it. And then if it sounds fucking stupid of me, Oh, you know, it just says one. I do. I just say it's still, what am I going? I'm just saying it wasn't, you know, look, it was beyond Sherry's berries and nature's boxes. There's some shit that fucking didn't even make the pot God

Speaker 2:          01:30:58       cast. There was, there was one thing that I read when I wasn't even thinking when we go some, some fucking banker thing and my buddy, you know Andrew who puts the whole all the lists together and everything that I read, he was in banking. He said, Bill, these guys that trick and people that are doing this and they're going to fuck over you listen to. So I immediately took it off and I was there was supposed to do a three week thing and I had read one of them and I just told my ad lady said, listen, just take them off. That first one's a free one up. They don't have to pay me but I don't want to read. I don't want to read it cause they know I don't, I don't have time to fucking look at all of those things. So sometimes I will read something they don't believe in and then if I'm smart enough, when I catch it, as I'm reading it, I make fun of it. That's what I do. I make fun of it and say it's shit. And then they get mad and they yell at me or yell at my Ad Lady, and then we just go, oh, we're not going to have fucking, you're not gonna be on the podcast then. It's cool. Which is funny. So I can, he can't get fired off your own podcast. So, um, look, I'm not saying that like, you know, I don't want people to think of that. I'm sitting here saying that I'm this righteous fucking, I'm not saying

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       that, but there's definitely, you know, there's, I, there's always does always selling out. There's all, unless you just completely don't give a fuck you, you never gave a fuck. And he does like, look at me and pay me. I'm going to fucking do it. Then. Then I, I left about selling out and more about like survival and more about like, you know, let me just sort of hit everything. Well, if you need the fucking money, if you need, look, if you're sitting there in a house and they're going to throw you out and then chitchat comes up, says, Hey, we want you to wear a thong and go down a water slide backwards. I mean, you've got to sit there and be like, ah, fuck man, I got to do it. I mean, I can't be out in the fucking street. Maybe it's not their first choice, you know, be paid by Haagen daas again, but, but he's also, they're also having a, you know, a wedding or whatever and written Versailles and that's just gotta be paid for.

Speaker 1:          01:32:50       But listen, so Haagen daas paid for that. Look, I'm not saying, I'm not saying that, that if you do that, you sold out. But I'm not saying that if you do it, you didn't. It all depends on the person after they did it, after they fucking did it. How did they feel if they thought, fuck, that was great, that was easy money, blah, blah, blah, and they continue on, then I don't think they sold themselves out. I really think at this point in my life, I feel like selling out is, is, is a personal thing and as much as fans will accuse of you are a person of it or whatever, um, that it's just speculation because it really comes down to the person like, like a lot of musicians now. I mean because the whole star making thing went away. There is no MTV, there is no videos, there isn't, there aren't these labels in the CD stores now.

Speaker 1:          01:33:41       It really is on your own. It, you know, back in the day when I was growing up, if, if, if your music was in a car and it was in any commercial, you are a fucking seller and like that really, like people would just say he's a fucking sell out. He took the corporate buck and all that. It was a really thing because there was all these other ways I think then where you could, you could still be this big person, but now be like this pure artists uncorrupted by the system that you're trying to get into. And that's kind of the whole fucking point of it. Not, it's not. See now that I disagree with it, I just, I just, I disagree with that because what you're saying is either you're a fucking horse sucking dick or you're this lonely bastard rather than that, then then you can be in a healthy fucking relationship.

Speaker 1:          01:34:26       There's plenty of people that look this, plenty of people that, that are in this business and they, they just do their movies. So they just do their TV show. This is zillion people that, and you don't see them going, like, I'll tell you and I come home from work and I want to relax. I fucking Blahblahblahblahblah this. Plenty of people that don't do that. Now I'm not saying that there are any better than the people who decide like, yeah, fuck it. I'll take the money to go to a pro, actually liked that product or whatever. Uh, I'm really saying that it's, it's an individual. It's an individual thing. All right, how you want to be perceived, you know, how you want to go about this business. And I think the more that people do it, the less, um, the, uh, the, the less it's going to have like that stigma.

Speaker 1:          01:35:08       Like you see a lot of these movie stars that are on doing it. The commercials now it's because people stole movies. So right now basically the only movies that they make, it's this shrinking puddle. The only movies that they make now are either those hundred zillion dollar transformer Godzilla things where even though they're going to be on a pirate bay, um, people still will hopefully want to get the experience or it's going to be a low budget thing. The thing that got killed was the 30, 50, 60, $80 million movie. Those things are gone. Not totally be a view. You get like a Martin Scorsese behind it. You can get the thing made, but like, like I don't have the exact numbers. I was talking to my agent about this because I'm seeing a lot, I'm seeing a lot of movie stars all of a sudden going back to doing stand up. I'm seeing a lot of them do like, like uh, commercials and all that type of thing. It isn't necessarily because they want to. It's because the business has changed and is going in the direction of the, uh, of, of, of the music.

Speaker 5:          01:36:06       Yeah. So then to that end, and they, I don't think they can be accused of selling out either, you know, because of everything that you said. I don't think you can, you can

Speaker 1:          01:36:15       choose anybody of selling out, but the only person who knows I feel is the person who did it. If afterwards when you fucking, you've walked out of there, if you felt like you needed a shower, if you just, you know, you sit in there and drag fucking whatever the fuck you're doing, whatever job it is that you're doing. Um, and believe me, I've had those,

Speaker 5:          01:36:37       I feel like it affects people's brands are images in that way anymore? Like I just don't, I don't either. I don't either. People thought like Kanye, even getting involved with Kim Kardashians, let alone marrying her and singing the praises of her and her family was going to like destroy his fan base and no, no way. It's not happening. If anything, it's make it even bigger.

Speaker 1:          01:36:59       Here's one for you. This is how much this business has changed with the perception back in the day. If you are a movie star, you are a movie star and you did not do TV. That was considered a major fuck up. I mean you could start in the business too when your commercials and then once you got to the TV level of something, it was really hard when you're a TV star, like they won't even look, oh you though. People see you on TV, you are this, you are that, you know, you're a commercial actor, you're a movie star, you're a TV star. And then over the years it started to like, you know, I mean it was in when it was still, it was an amazing thing back in the day when a guy like Bruce Willis went from moonlighting and then he did die hard and all of a sudden he was this fucking movie star. I mean that was, that was like, that was still an amazing thing to do. And now it's like people jump back and forth, which I think is, um, is a cool thing. But way back in the day, it's my who is, who is that? Who is that? Um, that that actor and actress we went, um, will going, went to that party

Speaker 2:          01:37:55       and turned out she had lived around the corner I African American actress from like the thirties or forties dated that fucker. Yeah. Now she dated this guy or married this, this white dude who had a fucking supper club and he marries her in his convincing her that she should go down there as a movie star in Sing, add his supper club in Hollywood. That is not going to be filmed. Nobody's going to see it. And all of our friends begged her, don't do that. That's going to kill your fucking movie career. If you as a movie star are seen singing in this supper club. And I'd love for this guy who turned out to be not a good guy. She did it and it actually hurt her movie career. So back then, you know, like, like how hardcore those lines were back then. I don't think that that exists anymore, but I have to tell you though, there are certain people that I don't want to see doing a fucking snickers commercial or, yeah. How did you feel when you signed Joe Pesci and the snickers commercial?

Speaker 2:          01:38:58       Joe Pesci. Well this is in it for like two seconds, but those things are well written and the way it is is what they're actually saying is you're not yourself. So there's almost this way that they, it's, it's a really slick way to get the celebrity in and out where they, they don't, they can just sort of not have to take a full shower, just sorta dab the forehead, take their bag of money and leave. Look, I'm not saying I would never do one of those, but as a right now, like I just feel like, uh, I dunno, I like telling my jokes and I like doing the acting gigs that they give me. And I think that at the end of it all, you want to have a quality, you want to have quality. And I don't, and I just always, I always feel like when something that comes down the pike that is just a money fucking Gig, there's always that, okay, I could take this or I could just do a couple extra weekends a stand up and I could make up, you know, some of that money.

Speaker 2:          01:39:57       And then I don't have that. But I mean, we all got our fucking shit when we were coming up. Everybody's got some student films and shit that you like, that stuff. I don't count, but I really feel that, uh, you know, um, I, but I, at the end of it, I thought, I, I just, I just feel it's a personal thing that like, look, this, this people who did get sick of doing the road, and it's like, I don't want to fucking go out there anymore. I don't want to fucking deal with the check spots. I don't want to deal with the drunks up the show. I just, I just, I don't want to get her another fucking airplane. Okay. I've had it, the old me wanting to do that, I did that and I proved that I could do that. If you want me to go do a fucking commercial and take this fucking money and I'm a day and a half and it pays my mortgage for the year, I'll do it. And I don't think there's a fucking thing wrong with that. They go, okay, I don't think there's anything wrong with it. They go, unless, unless afterwards you feel like a filthy

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       fucking whore. So, well for me, like I, yeah, and I completely understand that I think is, for me, I think I had to sort of come to terms with the fact that like I am just like a pop culture. Like I want to see all that stuff. So in a way I'm glad that like they're all out there and their pictures are being sold to people magazine because I want to fucking see the wedding. I want to see like who wins and what they're wearing and what the castle looked like and all that kinds of stuff. How I feel about that show. That's how I feel about that show. I find that show depressing. I find it unbelievable. Kardashians. I find it depressing when they're dealing with depressing shit. Otherwise it's like kind of mindless, mindless entertainment I find. I find the whole fucking thing.

Speaker 1:          01:41:37       This stuff with Lamar, I find that fucker thing walking around in your expensive shoes and you've, you've flashy bag and this whole perception of this life that you're leading. I, I find all of that. I don't know why I look at it. I find it gross and I just find it depressing. I'm not saying that somebody shouldn't live that life and if that's what makes them happy, it makes him happy. Anytime I've ever gone to those fucking, that's all. It's inspiring. It's aspirational. It's just like, it's like a, it's a fantasy thing. Like everyone wants to sort of live in a world where they're in a movie or in their magazine like, you know what I mean? Like, it's, it's part of like, like I'll tell you, I'll tell you this as far as like cars, I fucking love cars. Okay. But I think it's so much more cooler what they do on those shows where they take an old car, you know, like fast and loud and what they do.

Speaker 1:          01:42:31       Cause there's an artistry to that, that stuff. Did they do everything from the, the deciding of this car, can we bring this thing back to life? And then just seeing the old technology and then see what Erin does to upgrade it. And then the whole art of Richard trying to flip the whole thing. I mean, that to me is way more compelling than just going down to the lot being I'm super successful. Uh, so and so has one of those. Let me get dad and let me get that in fucking this color and let me get the fucking lambos fucking suicide doors. And then I'm going to call the Paparazzi and I'm going to go to where the fuck they're at and I'm going to have decked out, head to toe in the sunglass people paid me to wear it. And I'm going to step out and then act like, oh, why are you here?

Speaker 1:          01:43:17       That shit to me is I find that gross. Yeah, it's up there. It's definitely an element of buttons to it. There's an art to everything so I'm sure that there is an art to doing that and the fact that like people are what they are, they have become successful just by showing themselves on TV at not as you said, not doing anything, quote unquote not being actors or singers or anything like that. Just being themselves and they have built this like sort of empire off of originally a notorious thing that happened is I, is that not impressive? Are you not entertained? No, no, no. I'm not saying what they did was bad or anything. I just personally when I watch it I just think it's gross. I think it's gross. That's somebody's daughter and she made that fucking video and if what they said was true that her mother like I don't know if it leaked out and then her mother did like the most amazing spin job ever.

Speaker 1:          01:44:14       I think that's, to me that's what happened. This thing. Well, the, I think that that's the story they tell because a lot of people, how do you know, she wasn't like Kim, get on your knees and suck that deck. We have to get out of this part of town. Milton had a sex tape and it didn't, she didn't sort of go off to become this thing that, you know her. Are we talking about talking about Kim Kardashians she was seeking, she might've been the ultimate anymore. No, no, no. That's irrelevant. She was the original. Um, I'm bringing nothing to the table. I'm just showing up to these events. She was the original. Yeah, of course. So what happens is, is just like, you know, somebody sets the bar for guitar playing, somebody comes along and has to, has to, I'll do that. She set the bar for empty headed skinny bitch going to a club who's got more money than she fucking needs.

Speaker 1:          01:45:08       So then Kim comes along, it's like, well, I got to outdo that. So then metaphorically sucking the dick, I will literally suck it and God help. But did, she was already famous when she did it. Yeah. That's the difference. She was already famous for doing nothing where Kim became, wasn't famous for doing nothing and then became famous for doing nothing. We, I wanted to ask you about one other thing really quick way I have, I have advertising to read. Oh, you did. Let's go into your lovely advertising. I want to talk to you about Bruce Willis and Demi Moore. This is almost a fucking two hour podcasts. I gotta get Outta here. Oh, it depends on how long somebody ride is to work.

Speaker 4:          01:45:50       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:45:51       Well, you know what I want to hear from you guys, man. I to hear from a lot of fads. Those little call one 800, no calm. Let me know. Uh, what the fuck did the ads go? Did I finish them all? Um, oh, here it is. I want to hear what you got. What do you guys think is selling out?

Speaker 1:          01:46:07       You know, what, what do you think that selling out exist anymore? Like I don't feel like it really is a thing anymore. Well, I think also if you grow up just seeing movie stars doing commercials, I don't think it's like a big deal. Let's think about them too. I mean, you know, these last five years has really changed because it was funny when you were in this country, you didn't see movie stars on billboards and Shit like that. And then you went to Australia, you go to Europe, you see like Leonardo doing the tag hoyer, fucking things and all this shit.

Speaker 4:          01:46:34       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:46:35       In way back in the day. Oh my God. And I hate Cooper doing ads for a hug and does actually has pictures there. He might not be coming out of the thing like Kanye and Kim. He might not actually be coming out of the store holders. And to be honest with you, when I think about that, when I about that, it's like what's the, how much fucking money do you got to make you fucking the star? Those, those, the, the three hangover movies, you could get money for life. Yeah, but why not make it life? But why not do that and add to the income? Because I look at it going, no, we need it eventually. Like you said, I want to keep doing movies and acting as though I get that. I always say, when this business is finished with me, they probably have that same, this is my deal.

Speaker 1:          01:47:15       I look at it like, okay, so you do all those movies and you're not getting any more movies. Then you fucking do them. Fuck it. I'll do a commercial. Then you do it, but when you're fucking up there, I mean the guy was just, and then he was on another movie that was up for like best picture and people want Oscars and, but the thing is you'll make more money doing it while you're the big star. So it doesn't make any sense to do it after you fall off. Because then they're like, hey, here's five grand taking her leave it and you're like, fuck, I got to take it. No, take it now. Bank it. Ah, I dunno about that. That's a smarter business decision not to wait until you're like nobody wants you anymore. And then you'll hold an ice cream cone. Like, hi, bye.

Speaker 1:          01:47:54       Then no one even fucking cares. That's the other thing I want to, I want to, you know what? I would love to talk to a movie star and ask them how they feel about sitting there with the ice. Some looking at the spoon. You know what's funny? I just, I just look at it as another acting gig. I think Kim came out with ice cream. Kanye was just in there, but he wasn't holding, he wasn't photographed holding anything. And then like her mom has a picture. Holly and her sister has one. So I think Kinda was like, all right, yeah, I'll go in there with you, but I'm not fucking coming up here with the ice cream cone because I love you. Can I shoot this? Does any of that make you want to buy Haagen Daz ice cream? Like it's not like I'm sitting on the fence going, you know, I don't know about that.

Speaker 1:          01:48:38       Hug and does. I love Bradley Cooper. What is he eating? Jesus get me three pints of it. I think it's supposed to be more subliminal than that. All right, let's just fucking read these so we can get out of here. He voice everybody. Now it's my turn to whore myself out. I'm, this is, this is my Haagen and ice cream right here. Perfect.

Speaker 3:          01:51:39       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:51:41       Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come in here for you know what's funny about this? I was just thinking as I was reading that was that later on in my career, right?

Speaker 3:          01:51:50       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:51:51       When it's all fucking set had done and they are done with me and I'm doing a sag nut bar commercial, people will take the audio from this. Yeah, but I never said that it was, I never, I, I said it was an individual thing. I will tell you this and I could tell you without a fucking doubt. As far as I feel that if I ever did one of those that I would, I would, I don't know how I would be able, I mean I guess you change every four or five years, you know? I guess as you become an older man and he just don't want to fucking go out there or anything, like how you change your physicality. When you say older man, you're such an actor at heart. You just kind of like bent over and may just off physically and old man come an older man.

Speaker 1:          01:52:29       Yeah. He just, he like, you know what you, when I eat candy bars, I like this candy bar. I don't give a fuck if you want to pay for my prostate exam this month. Go ahead. Do it. Now the fear is that, yeah, the business will be done with you and you're not gonna have anywhere to turn. So make your money and hopefully, you know, you pay your fucking house, you buy a house you can afford and you pay the fucking thing off. And then the next thing you do is you go out, you buy rental properties, so then you don't fuck those people over. But they help pay that thing off. And then in the end of your life, if you got a problem, you can sell one of those fucking units. That's what I want to do. As opposed to go on and sit there and look with an amaze.

Speaker 1:          01:53:13       Look on my face as the microwave. Microwave popcorn is popping. Okay. But this is the thing, actually, I shouldn't even say that because there's so many commercials that I think is so funny and great and I think the performances of commercials that are like, oh, they're way better than that. Yeah, they're way better than than they used to be. But I guess the nightmare is you know what it is. You just don't want to be in something that sucks. It's fucking cheesy. Maybe. Maybe that's what it is with every movie or TV. So you do, you don't really know as an answer unless you are like the director or producer, not just in name, but a real producer on it. You have no idea how it's gonna go. So you will go up, but you get the scripts. Awesome. Yeah. You think this is going to be, this is a funny script, is a great director, writer bubble, and it comes out and it's tracked.

Speaker 1:          01:53:58       You're telling me that that same, you think that's, do you think that same thing happens when you get the copy for the Zag nut bar commercial? No, but at least you know what she say on paper. This looks good. Oh, but you know, you know exactly what you're getting into. You know exactly the purpose for this thing. You don't, you don't know exactly what you get your son is that, I can't believe you said not yourself. Oh, you're so old. Sometimes. He snippers Fifth Avenue, Fifth Avenue, payday, payday, marathon bar commercials prepare their think. But, but anyway, yeah, no more what you're getting into because you have no power on how they're going to edit it. You don't know who's fucking direct in the goddamn thing. You don't know if they, if he the editor as opposed to, wow, this is really something that I was really believed in. And it's unfortunate that it didn't, you know, you didn't get to see what we really speaking to that how many buddies, how many people's careers were ruined by that one. Batman movie was one, one of the one where the went chick and when the girl went, oh no, she played poison. Oh Shit. Oh, Scarface. Michelle Pfeiffer. And then the guy, the guy doing the fucking, the guy doing the TV show with ll cool J. Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:55:06       Chris, uh, Chris Christiansen, he played Robin. He played Robin. That's career wasn't ruined. He's on that. He took a major fucking hit. He didn't write that God, their movie wasn't his fault. He was playing the boy wonder whole CSI and he's doing all right. I know, but he, he in there. Yeah, but he was on the fucking ropes because of that movie.

Speaker 3:          01:55:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:55:27       Yeah. Well, you know

Speaker 1:          01:55:30       what I didn't want my point is I'm just saying, all right, I'm not trying to do a two hour podcast is like seeing a to 200 point envy again later on so we can talk about what that word mean. Addendum. That's like an addition Scout Willis. What was weekend too? It's, this has been over two hours. I don't think my listeners give a fuck about what, what happened was Scout Willis. Well she's uh, she went parading around New York a topless because she was in protest of Instagram cutting out her account because you know, she was wearing a sheer top in his shoulder nipples. And that's been a thing where people's nipples or whatever, haven't been on Instagram. Like they shut down Rihanna as account because she posted some pictures from a magazine. She like a French magazine shoot. She did. And then this editor at Vogue, uh, named Grace Cottington just put a picture, like a stick figure thing with little nipples on it and they shut down our her account.

Speaker 1:          01:56:27       They gave her account back because it was ridiculous cause of the cartoon because this whole thing now where Instagram is like, you know, cutting people off or excessive nudity and shit. So Scout Willis and protest quote unquote when walking around topless in New York City and had our picture taken and stuff because she was like, I just got my breasts reduced. I felt good about myself. And you know, Instagram is shaming people and I think that is the most ridiculous non cause ever. Like really scout will as the daughter of delight, famous movie stars, you're really being oppressed by Instagram because they want to shut down the fucking nipples. It was the most insane, ridiculous thing I had ever seen it in my mind. Think about their uh, their, no, no nipple policy. I mean, I mean I don't, I don't give a fuck. Yeah, no nudity.

Speaker 1:          01:57:18       Sure. Fine. I feel like I still see plenty of booty shots on it. Yeah. That's like youtube. It's like, you know, there's a certain level of whoredom that you can go to and then they stopped because they're trying to protect their image. Yeah. Exit. I tried to come a porno hub. Exactly. And they've got all kinds of young kids on it, so they're trying to be mindful of that too. They don't want it to be what's funny about like, don't use Instagram heads in a zillion places on the fucking Internet. That's just like, you know, I've talk, I wouldn't talk like this and church am I let him an old during somebody's speech. But you know, right. You got to respect. It's Instagram. That's it. That's their church. And yeah, and that's the thing. I don't, I don't, the thing is though, she's really trying to make it about censorship and you're shaming women and men can go, right.

Speaker 1:          01:58:01       It's like you are not shamed or being like oppressed in any way. Daughter of famous, yet guys are being oppressed. Oh God. Guys are being oppressed God. Cause you get to look at Man tits all the time, man. And I can't see, you know, that's all. That's all we're thinking about as mantids male, male, male, pex. I'm sure you're, and I'm sure you're really like scared that all the people googling your, your, your pecs, right? You live sort of in that fear of going to the beach. I looked like a piece of chalk that was, somebody threw some cinnamon at flex. Some cinema really annoyed me that Scout Willis has the to act like she was somehow being oppressed in any way because Instagram bands are account names. Scout. What do you think they're going to fuck it do their parents were movie stars. What do you think they're going to do?

Speaker 1:          01:58:54       You know, even Rihanna is like whatever moving on and just as her Twitter account now, and she had an a and the thing is she wasn't even doing it. Like I'm doing it for Rihanna. In fact, she had split. I'm not gonna try to act like all black people know each other. But is there any way you can get in touch with her and tell her to stop drawing on herself? Rhea, Rhea, her tattoo. Oh my God. Yes. No I don't. I don't know where yet. I saw no, I would not be with her. Uh, with their air force tattoo under a tip to something that's not an iron maiden has power slave album cover that she has that little uh, what she wants with her body. And what's your little, some on the side, what's your problem with Rihanna? Having a bunch of tattoos.

Speaker 1:          01:59:34       She's got a beautiful body. She has a great canvas for it. Yeah. No and so he started scribbling all over it. Oh, you're like anti, you're not completely anti tattoo, but you're kind of our anti tattoo. Oh, you know what I don't like, I don't like when somebody tries to write something fucking deep on their rib cage or their shoulder blade like hey, the next time the butterfly flaps its wings. You're talking about Megan Fox? No I'm not. Oh cause she had something that butterflies will latch the gilded butterfly or something about Jesus when the fire dances with the water on the butterfly wings that drunk Jim Morrison Horse Shit, you got on the back of your leg. I don't give a fuck. Like, like, like just advertising that you, you understand life or some shit. Like I'm supposed to be like, wow, that person is deep. Yeah. You know, tattoo artists don't like doing those things.

Speaker 1:          02:00:29       They float. Yeah. Cause they feel like they say, they feel like they're on punishment. Like they're writing. Like I will not talk in class because they're just sitting there writing. There's nothing creative about it. Well then that's, let's see. That's how I feel about Scout Willis. It was, I was very, my role, my eyes rolled in the back of my head. I was having a seizure. That's how hard we were at the two hour mark. We are at the two hour mark. I'm going to end this bitch fest. Thanks for having me on the podcast on my birthday. No worries. It's already three 15 now. Half over notice was half over at noon, but you stay up until three Oh, so then you find, right? Yeah, exactly. That's what you're trying to say. Oh, artists. Artists can't do math. All right, I'll talk to you guys next week. Hey, watch the kings and ranges. Go Fuck Yourself.
