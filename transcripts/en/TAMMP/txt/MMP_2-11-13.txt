Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burr and it's the Monday morning podcast from Monday, February 11th, 2013. Um, how are you? How's it going? How's your week going so far?

Speaker 2:          00:00:16       Uh, you know what, I just looked across my Roman, I saw an object that reminded me of one of my many failures this week. I was in a rush to leave my house and, uh, I was taking my truck cause I was finally going to get the brakes done. I bought a kit to switch my fucking, um, I got drum brakes on my old truck. And as much as I wanted to keep the truck as original as possible, just the way people text and drive out here and there's so many people, I just know that if I ever hit somebody with the front end of that beautiful truck that you know, I'm never going to be able to replace the parts. So I'm like, I gotta do this shit. All right. So, uh, Christopher Titus, very talented. Christopher Titus, uh, he's into all of that shit. So he tells me go out and go buy a kit, will drive it over to my place and we'll fucking slap this thing on. It's going to take no more than four hours. Bing, Bang, boom, everything's fucking done. Right. So I'm all excited. I bought this kit by the way, in July of last year and it's just been sitting in my office. I've been using it like just, you know, putting my legs up on it because I'm,

Speaker 2:          00:01:29       because life goes by that fast. When you're as old as I am next weekend, next week, next week. Next thing you know, you've, you fucking had the thing for like six months. So finally we set a date where like, all right, let's fucking, let's do, it was at Wednesday we were going to do it. And uh, you know, I'm fucking nervous. I don't know what I'm doing. So anyways, I got to move the Prius out of the way. So I move that out of the fucking way. And I got the hazard lights on, you know, because it's the day where the cuts come around and they give people parking tickets. So I bring the truck up, right. It got to fucking choke off of [inaudible] bring it up the fucking thing. Right. And in my haste,

Speaker 1:          00:02:07       okay,

Speaker 2:          00:02:08       bring in the fucking car back. I left the hazard lights on.

Speaker 2:          00:02:13       So after we were done with the job, I came home and my fucking, the fucking car was dead and I'm like, no big deal. I know how to jumpstart this fucking hybrid. I know how to do it. I watched the AAA guy do it and I went out and I bought one of those self contained battery pack fucking things. Opened the hood. Cute little hood dead. It is. I opened the little battery pack, I took the little red thing off and I can't fucking figure out how to clip it on. I tried to clip it on the bolt rather than that metal tab and it didn't matter anyways because my thing wasn't fucking charged and I had to call AAA to have my car jumped. Do you realize the level of, of like how emasculating that is. Have somebody come over, you know, have somebody teach you how to your brakes.

Speaker 2:          00:02:59       Okay. That's understandable. All right. That's, that's some next level shit, right? It's fucking jumper cables out was the one word. It's the worst. When the guy showed up, I should have come out of the house and address, um, just defeated fucking man. But I, I bit the bullet, I was like, yeah, I can't figure out how to do it. And he explained it. My thing didn't work anyways and I can't find the cord to charge the fucking thing. So they're there, it sits there. It sits. Actually, I just kind of slammed that whole thing together. Reality is, is it took us two and a half days to get the fucking brakes on because uh, the back plates that you stick the rotors on, once mark left, the other one was mark. Right. And we put them on, we know the difference between left and right, and Titus kept going, is it me or does it look like it's kind of like talking in like it's been what the, you know, and I'm looking at it like I know what's going on. Oh, you know, it looks pretty good to me. Right. You know, put the fucking things on. It's rubbing. If you turn too far to the left or the right, you know the calipers are going to hit the springs. The fucking break lines weren't long enough. The whole God damn kit. So finally we get these people on the phone. I'm not gonna say who they were, but when I would finally get him on the phone and they like, oh yeah, we had a batch of their ma went out and all they weren't labeled right.

Speaker 2:          00:04:26       I got to tell you is of the Titus and one of the most eloquent fucking ass rip eggs you've ever seen in your life. Never raised his voice, never cursed. I think you said one f bomb. But it was a throwaway cause he was like, you know, I've been, I'm fucking here for three days. Like one of those things. Not saying you're a fucking asshole, but other than that never cursed. And he just basically went right down the line like a, so you knew these were labeled wrong and you didn't call anybody these, this is a safety issue. And the guy at first would not admit any wrongdoing to the point was hilarious. He wouldn't have been any wrongdoing at one point. I swear to God, he goes, well, did you look at the picture?

Speaker 2:          00:05:13       Oh, in defense of them, the picture was right, but the picture was like the size of maybe three postage stamps and it was in black and white. And it was very confusing because you couldn't quite see it, but you kind of could. But it was written clear as day left and right. So what are you going to go with? What I can barely see or what I can clearly read. That's what we went with and uh Oh my God. And then we finally got that out of them and then we fucking switch to them. And then it worked like a dream. But the great thing was, was trying to figure it out. We put them on and take, took them off like I think at least three times. So I kinda got three like, um,

Speaker 3:          00:05:59       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:06:00       It's almost like I did three, three brake jobs. I got like that level of experience and I got to tell you, it was, it was the fucking coolest thing ever to finally do something like that to see how it all goes together. It was absolutely a fascinating and um,

Speaker 2:          00:06:16       I dunno, tidy since the shit because he would not, he could have just slapped it on and be like, Hey, go take a team mechanic. I don't what the fuck's going on? He was determined to get this thing on correctly. And he did. And when he found out it was messed up, he went to bat for me any so eloquently reading these guys that they actually gave me a credit on the kit. So it didn't cost me a fucking dime. How great is that? And then we said, oh, you guys are all right now we're going to send him some DVDs and it's all a wash. So I finally, that was was three, two and a half days of that fucking shit. And then I finally do auto zone like fucking nine times. And every time I came into auto zone I was a little more tired and a little more dirty. Nothing. I was thinking how enjoyable it would have been, had the whole thing gone together. I want, probably want to learn nearly as much, but just,

Speaker 3:          00:07:12       uh,

Speaker 2:          00:07:14       you know, like when you watch those youtube videos, like Eric the car guy and he's just fucking, he's just, this goes here and this goes here, you take that off, put this on and put this thing back on and it just, it just goes so fucking smoothly. And uh, that was not the case on this thing. But when we finally got it all together, um, it was tremendous. And I'm, I'm, I'm sick now, but this how much of a sentimental fool I am, I'm, I'm keeping the old drum brakes and I bought the tools to be able to put it back together just cause I don't want to leave it. I want to learn how to do it. And then I also don't want to just leave all the springs and shit laying around in the garage, you know, kicking them around and shit. You know, how long can you leave that shit around before something fucking happens and then you lose it forever.

Speaker 2:          00:07:56       So there you go. How'd you like death? That was my, uh, fixing the break story. So I now have, I now have a, uh, a disc brakes and I put one of the road is on with the caliper and all of that. And a, I was beyond, uh, beyond site, although it does have a friend. It does help to have a friend who's basically a master fucking mechanic who has all the God damn tools, uh, who was getting home. I should have been over there with a fucking nurse's outfit on. I was just handing them shit, but whatever. I get dirty.

Speaker 4:          00:08:29       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:08:30       So anyways, I, I have no idea what is going on in the world right now because, uh, for some reason I've decided to do like 10 do it yourself fucking projects and uh, I'm painting my living room, so I n I don't know. It's a, it's a motherfucker. It's a pain in the ass. It's easy, but it's a pain in the ass and a to tape everything up. And I haven't watched TV for like the last two days, so I know it in Boston. Uh, that blizzard with the fuck are they calling it Nokia? Nardi. Yeah. What the hell was it here? Nameable Nimoy Nimmo. Blizzard Nimo I guess they're gonna name a snow storms now.

Speaker 5:          00:09:13       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:09:13       You know, I don't even need to get into that. Enough Comedians have made fun of how much they overhyped these things. This looks a little say was actually a decent amount of snow, but in the end, even if you have like, you know, fucking

Speaker 5:          00:09:24       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:09:24       Let's say there's three feet of snow.

Speaker 5:          00:09:27       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:09:28       Yeah. I mean, what is, what is that up to?

Speaker 5:          00:09:30       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:09:31       Let's say two feet of snow. Two feet of snow. Is that even up to your knees if you're an average size adult?

Speaker 5:          00:09:37       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:09:37       Like what is going to eat? You can go 30 days. I think I've said this before in the podcast. You can go 30 fucking days without food. Maybe more than that. The big thing is water. Alright. Snow right there. The Nice fucking handful of cold water sticking your mouth and just relax. Let it melt. He couldn't be fine. You're not going to die. Some guy on youtube made this hilarious video of just screaming, I have to get a, I have to get bread and milk I think is, it's already got 2 million hits. It's the funniest bucket that why do you have to get bread and milk? I don't know. Am I, I guess if I was old I would be nervous, but only if, if like, you know, if the heat went out then that's the only way I would be nervous. But other than that, it's just fucking snow. You're going to get the day off. He can go sledding. Build a snowman.

Speaker 5:          00:10:29       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:10:30       Just put on a fucking scarf. You pussies. It's easy for me to say, right. I'm out here and fucking Los Angeles.

Speaker 2:          00:10:37       I gotta tell you though, you know, it's, it's been a while since I've been in snow and I saw some of the pictures. My, my buddy sent me this go and look at what the fuck I'm dealing with. And that actually looked awesome to me. You know, Snow's fun to visit, but you don't want to live in it when it first comes down, it's beautiful. And then once it starts being dirty and all that fucking Shit, you just get tired. There's less parking spots. It'd be buddy down in southeast shoveling out there. Kaz Putting a fucking trash barrel there. Some Yuppie doesn't know the rules. Pulls in his little fucking Puccio and he never sees it again. Um, at least that's how I heard it works there. Uh, this is the Monday morning podcast. What am I going to do here? Well, you know what else I miss today?

Speaker 2:          00:11:14       I didn't realize the broads. I know that, that that game against Tampa Bay got canceled and I didn't realize that they played a, the Buffalo Sabres, which has become a big rivalry. And I know a lot of you guys don't like hockey, especially the Douche who had to write me on Twitter to let me know that he tried to watch hockey. Hockey didn't enjoy it. It literally wrote Jaan fucking cunt. You know, I just said, you know, if you, it's a great sport, watch Bruins Montreal. If you want to try to get it, do I really need your fucking like do you think the Nhl get well maybe they give a fuck. Maybe they want your money, you know? Right. Then why are you writing me like I'm the commissioner anyways.

Speaker 5:          00:11:58       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:11:59       Why do I read them? I don't know why I re I should just not read them. Um, so anyways, people hate fucking the Sabres. They hate Lou Cheech because he ran over their goalie last year in a hurt the guy, granted it was a Douche move, but you know, he was frustrated. He had a breakout, he couldn't settle down the puck and old fucking old big eyes came out of the net, came out a little too far. You know when he ran them over your right. Your right to be mad at him. But can you please stop asking why Luci Cheech won't fight. John Scott, why do you get John Scott is like six, eight, two 70. He's a fucking goon. He can barely skate. Why? Why would you have an all star fight? That guy risk getting hurt and then sit in the box. That's why he's not fighting them. There's no way ownership is going to let that guy fight. All right. And all Lou chichis is a fucking million dollar piece of meat to the ownership, you know what I mean? So they're not going to have him go out there and go fight that big fucking Sasquatch.

Speaker 2:          00:13:06       He shouldn't even go out there and skate. So she just walk out there with like work boots on. I don't know. He probably can play. They don't allow him to, but I hate when people say that shit. They pick like the best guy in your team and were like, yeah, he's too much of a pussy to fight our toothless moron. Yeah, that, that's a good switch off. That's a good trade off. Let's have one of our best guys sit down for five minutes and all you lose is some fucking God damn gorilla. I get it. Buffalo. You're upset.

Speaker 5:          00:13:37       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:13:38       Okay. You want to see Lou Cheech get pounded. I understand how you're probably, logic is well, fucking what about saucer eyes there he wasn't exactly a tough target. Um, there maybe deserves it. I Dunno. I feel bad for people in Buffalo. You know what I mean? That's just, that's, I been there as a sports fan. Fortunately, I, they let me up off the mat over the last 10 years. You know, I'm rooting for you guys. You know, I know what people say to you. I know exactly what the fight I dealt with that Bucky Dent 1918 all at fucking horse shit.

Speaker 2:          00:14:11       The fucking curse with the Canadians back when they dominated us 25 fucking years ago, whatever the hell it was. Unless you're Dan Shaughnessy, every time we lose to him, he starts, the Kurds is back, noodle headed cunt. Um, I know what you're going through. I know. People say, why'd right? They say bread hall. They say a white, he plays sports. Why don't you just stick to make an appetizers? You already came up with buffalo wings. There's, is there something else you guys can come up with that we can enjoy eating while we watch our teams win championships? I realized they say holy Cunty Shit too. And it eats away at you after awhile. It's awful. You know, I, I don't, I don't have any animosity towards any fans who go through shit like that. Haven't gone through it myself. I only wish it on, uh, you know, I wish it on.

Speaker 2:          00:14:59       I don't need to get into that shit anymore. Um, yeah. Take a Colby stop passing the ball. You guys are losing again. Huh? Did you figure it out? Laker fans or to years, you've just figured out a new way to compliment Koby Bryant. Unbelievable. Do you know like last week out here, uh, Colby for like three games in a row actually pass the ball for the first time in his career, he actually was passing the ball on a regular basis. And I know a lot of people are gonna say, cause they wrote to me and who's good foot Selgian careers schist Muggsy Bogues has over 6,000 in like three less seasons. Okay. The motherfuckers not passing the ball. Everybody who plays with them is not lying. They're not making up shit. Alright, guide finally passes the ball in place the team game. Fucking the Lakers night and day. All of a sudden they're this, this does this team that's winning. And the Laker fans think, oh, oh, that was the problem. Colby was the fucking problem. No, they immediately dropped to their knees in bloom again. It's a new facet to with gay.

Speaker 2:          00:16:09       They started calling them Magic Bryant. Kobe Johnson. I just, I've never seen, I just don't understand. I'm not saying the guy individually. Once again, this is the Peyton manning thing all over again. Individually phenomenal. It's not even, it's not even paint, man. He say, I can't even bring him up. Ah, Christ, I'm rambling.

Speaker 2:          00:20:21       Yeah, so I missed the gay. Yeah, I miss the game today and I saw Campbell jumped that guy in the savers. He get, he, he uh, he didn't come out too well in that one. I love the guy in the state was like looking at the ref like, I don't want to fight. Oh right. What does your day, um, all right now put the sports talk. Okay, I need to appease the ladies and the nerds out there. Oh, here's one for, um, this weekend I actually took a night off from standup comedy and I went out to a Indio, California, I can't remember the name of the Casino. I saw Don Rickles. They had to do it, man. I was like, I always see these guys underrated. Going to a casino and seeing a legend. He was amazing. And Tony Orlando tie a yellow ribbon. He destroyed in front of them.

Speaker 2:          00:21:14       I didn't realize how many hits that guy had. You know, I went with Bart neck and we will, and I was just going like, I think this guy's going to open with tie a yellow ribbon. He's going to close with it and he's gonna, he's gonna play it again in the middle. And he came right out of the gate, tie a yellow ribbon. And in my world, I'm like, this guy's Outta hit. He's out of hits and all of a sudden he goes to the next, I'm like, wait a minute, I know this song not three times on the ceiling, and if you want me twice or not pipe, right? Everybody go nuts. Then he had another hit after that. I'm like, God damn, this guy's got a lot of hits. Then he got do a drum battle, this drummer, and I'd have to give the nod to Tony and then Rickles comes out. It was just amazing just seeing an icon, you know, Tuxedo, the whole old school thing, guy opened up for Sinatra, underrated. Go into, go into a casino to see a legend. This is what I realize. This is a very blanket statement, but I'm sort of the king of this. Legends play casinos, hacks, go to cruise ships.

Speaker 2:          00:22:27       Is that bad? I'm just saying, you know, they give you a certain amount of time to make it in this business. And if you don't, they just, they just put you out to see, you know, Eh, that's not 100% true. There's some, there's some good guys doing. Uh, but you know what? I'm fucking talking about. I told you this story. I did a cruise ship one time. I worked with like a juggler and a, and the guy hosting it, I swear to God, was like a real life guy. Smiley. That was that story told you why? Well, they told me it was going to be a young crowd cause I was like, I don't think my ex can work on a cruise ship. This is like 10 11 years ago. I like not, I don't know. It's this young, these young with a young hip cruise liner thing, right.

Speaker 2:          00:23:10       So I show up, it's a bunch of old people in the guy. Smiley guy goes out there. This is how old they were. He went out and he opens with the f you're happy and you know it, clap your hands. And they did it. And at that point I was like, oh my God, I am going to fucking eat my balls. And I did. It wasn't easy because we were rolling over the waves. It was kind of tricky to get that second ball in my mouth. But I did seven minutes into my set, fucking munched on both. Captain wrote a letter to the agency. Oh God, why didn't I ever get a copy of that? Said I was offensive to all races, the handicapped.

Speaker 2:          00:23:48       I forget what else he said. I don't know. Nothing I said was as was as offensive as the fucking food they were serving on that goddamn boat. Oh my God. You never saw so many fat fucks in your life. I swear to God, if one of those cruise ships ever goes down, you know, has there ever been like an obese shark? The whales too. You know what fat people must be for sharks just because they don't, you know, we're not part of their diet. We just sort of accidentally like we gotta be like, remember those big pink snowballs, those mushrooms there, mushrooms in the middle and then they had, I don't know what the fuck was good. I never had the balls to eat. One only reason why is because it was marshmallow always thought marshmallow was disgusting. They remember fluff peanut butter and fluff and other, that toxic horse shit. I actually grew up right at the tail end of just feeding kids absolute poison.

Speaker 2:          00:24:45       Like now they feed poison but it's sort of disguised. You have no idea cause they'll write oh packed with protein or you know, nutritious shit. You know, there's somehow they'll put, put like those words in there. They try and camouflage. But back then it was just straight up like, you know, it was just poison. Fluffer nutter. The fuck is that? I Dunno. It's bunches. White Shit with bunch of sugar and you mix it up with peanut butter. I let, um, right. What am I talking about? Oh, we're talking about fat people going overboard and he fat listeners. You're going on a cruise and just think like, wow, if this goes, oh well wait a minute, would you float more if you're fat. The big thing is you'd have to relax. But the problem is, is like, you know, if you're wearing like a fat person, like a, like wet suit, you know, you just covering yourself all up. When you laying on your back in the ocean, you know the water that's been absorbed in your bathing suit is going to be coming down in your face. Sort of be like waterboarding yourself, you know. So maybe you've got a rollover and you stomach.

Speaker 2:          00:25:57       Nah, but then the roles in your neck of the kind of holding your face in the water, it's so rough deal. Um, is there ever been a fat navy seal? I don't, I don't think there has. All Right, oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. People I, this is why I do these Monday morning when the brain is fresh. I'm just attacking fucking people who can't defend themselves or stop eating. Um, all right,

Speaker 2:          00:26:25       here's something for you. It's just choppy is health. I got to recommend something as somebody recommended to me, told me to go see that Dave Grohl documentary on sound city. You can actually go to his website. I wish I had that up there. Just look, update growth. Sound city, you can download it for 12 bucks and it's worth every goddamn penny. It's about this studio sound city where basically I would say maybe 40%. It seemed of every fucking awesome album you've ever downloaded or ever wanted to get over the last 40 years was made, um, in this studio. And, uh, Dave Grohl actually bought the soundboard when it was going out of business. He bought the soundboard. So that kind of starts it off. And when you watch it, this isn't really a spoiler alert the whole time they're interviewing him. He's sitting in this old school van and I was sitting there. It's going to Zana one of those old Ford Vans.

Speaker 5:          00:27:23       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:27:23       The original, like the, the, uh, equal liners that you say it, the early sixties, I, he'd help like pedophiles ruined vans. You know what I mean? I don't know if it was pedophiles or date rapists, but like vans in the, in the 60s, if you look at them, they're not that bad. They're actually kind of adorable. I'll, I'll bring a picture up there like, you know, the Ford Econoline, it looked like a big, big fucking eyes. Looked like it needed some sleep, you know, and they was so tiny and he could just see it. You, you, you couldn't do anything and people could just see, you could see almost right through the fucking thing. Um, in the 70s, they became creepy. That's when they started, you know, putting carpet on the floors and the ceiling of them. And they had these crazy sort of acid murals on the side of them. And guys with Harry chess and mustaches started driving him around and just saw him somewhere. It just became the big, just mobile, you know? And this Skaggs liked him. I wish I was around when vans were cool, you know? Well actually I was, when I was a kid, I used to think custom vans with a shit.

Speaker 2:          00:28:33       I used to think, why don't my parents have a custom van? Remember that when you wanted your parents to be cool, why can't he get a corvette? Oh, I dunno, cause you're this fucking six kids with the hell. Am I going to stick you? That's when you know your dad's fucking around on your mom comes home with a two seater. Fuck the family I'm going out tonight. All right, Bill, how do you tell a girl she sucks in bed? Uh, the fish. Uh, hey bill, how do you tell a girl she sucks in bed without hurting her feelings or making her embarrassed? Is it okay to give pointers in the bedroom or would you may over it make that make me look like a Dick helped me out, Bill. Go Fuck Yourself. Um, all right. The first half, there's no way to tell a girl she sucks in bed. There's no way for a woman and tell a guy he sucks in bed without hurting the failings. Alright, let's be politically correct. There's no way for a guy to tell another guy if they live in an alternative lifestyle, 2013 date, no one wants to hear that. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:29:38       well, this is what I would do. I eat. You can't just make somebody good at bed. The potential has to be there. There has to be a certain God given talent. You know what I mean? I mean, some women, they, they reach for your package, like to, they're grabbing something out of the cupboard. You know what I mean? There's just no,

Speaker 5:          00:30:00       yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:30:00       it's, you know, what's funny about women being bad in bed is there's not a lot of, um, there's not a lot of stories. I think guys not knowing what they're doing is, is pretty well documented and guilty as charged. Guilty as charged, you know, but um, that it's, it's definitely a two way street. What I would do is if you feel she has potential, rather than give her pointers, like, hey listen, you're doing a great job in there. He's a couple things like make some halftime adjustments. Maybe you could do that, like stop halfway through fucking, you know, have her run into the bathroom and as you run into somebody interviews you. Yeah. Well, you know, the first half hour is pretty good. There's definitely some things we could do better. I know my balls are kind of lonely and uh, you know, she's got to know she doesn't have a good read them. We're going to try to work on our rhythm and the second half. Right? Yeah. Go Fuck Yourself. You know, runs back in. Um, I would suggest rather than cake, definitely don't tell us she sucks. Do not give pointers. I would, uh, the keyword here is guiding, guiding, and, um, informative, moaning.

Speaker 5:          00:31:17       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:31:17       I would say would be the, uh, the most user friendly way to protect this girl's feelings. It is, that's what you have to do. Um, I need more information. Do you feel she's aware? How did she suck in bed? Like I said, she grabbed me a dick. Like she's, you know, reaching into a mailbox to see what the fuck's in there or is she just shy? You gotta help me out here. I don't, I don't know. Um, you know, that, that's what I would do. I would, I would guide her and by guide her, I don't mean pushing her head down, it guiding, no forcing, none of that type of stuff. And, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:32:09       and then where you gotta be Simon Cowl is, um, don't give her any, um, sympathetic mode once she starts picking up that the moments, you know, you know, don't give her any sympathy once, if it ain't doin it for you. Don't give her a AH, yeah, no, don't do that. Just dead silence. Okay. She has to know she, it's not working. I don't know what to tell you dude. I know I told this story before. I hooked up with this girl one time and we were having sex doggy style and you know, when I come forward you're supposed to back in, you know, like we're clapping, uh, with crutches. Is that a, was that a fucking, does that one of those dances with wolves names clapping with crutches? Sorry. Hacky joke. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:33:03       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:33:03       Yeah, no, what she was doing when I went back, she went back, when I went forward, she went forward. So I was inner, but there was no friction. So I was starting to have a performance problem before I ever so gently put one hand on her hip and the other on the back of her neck. And just sort of stopped her.

Speaker 1:          00:33:17       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:33:17       Went back and then pulled her, but it still didn't work. It was like, not only does she not know how to do it, she was I think almost as tall as I was, you know, so doggy style, you know, they got to have the kind of like, you know, you can get a little too high there, you know, without getting too graphic. So I was already dealing with that, you know? Um, I don't know. Beautiful girl though. All right. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:33:42       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:33:42       Unexpected pregnancy. Oh, Jesus. He's a rough this week. Unexpected pregnancy bill. Absolutely love the podcast and the stand up. You like a skinny Louis C K or conversy Louis C K is like a fat bill burr. I really wish I didn't read that. Uh, um, anyway, not sure. Now I get dragged into it. Uh, and I'm not exactly skinny anymore. I've been having, I've been enjoying the high life lately. Mila. Um, anyway, to business. I'm a 24 year old guy from Sydney, Australia who's run up against a big problem. Last November I lost a well paying job due to an anxiety disorder I've developed over the years. I sought out treatment, been through therapy, had all sorts of diets and breathing exercises. And although recently it's been much more manageable. It's unfortunate. Unfortunately it wasn't enough to hold onto my high pressure job. You know what dude? Yeah, it was probably the job. Granted, I have no medical background whatsoever, but I really don't, you know, when you have to like eat a calm, quiet and start going, just so you can fucking go to work. Hello.

Speaker 1:          00:34:56       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:34:56       Oh Nia, how are you? Sorry. Just so the door opened. Uh, the lovely Nia. Everybody. Oh, you're busy. Okay. Um, what was it that was when you know that I was here. Oh, okay. All righty. Well, I'll see ya feel me along this week. Okay. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:35:19       yeah dude, when you have to fucking do shit like that just to go to work, it's probably the job. And considering you developed it over the years, let me guess, was it as you got this fucking high pressure job? I don't know. So anyways, um, uh, currently I'm looking for a more low key job anyways, days after I'm let go, I get a call from a friend I had had drunken unprotected sex with. The only reason why I went back to our house was at our house was within walking distance from the pub. We share a bed in nature, takes its course. Oh my God. It was a core of it was of course a risk and like any idiot mail, I just assumed nothing would happen. Turns out I'm going to be a dad. Come August after a mere one sexual indiscretion. I've known this woman for over three years.

Speaker 2:          00:36:09       She successful, smart, witty, and we get on really well. I'll be getting on really well. Uh, she is sorry. There was a big space in a new paragraph. I'm not that dumb people. Please, please will still believe in me. Um, she's been up up until now childless. And you can understand her reasonings for wanting to keep the spawn. She expects me to play an active role in the parenting game. And to be honest, that's something I am wholeheartedly prepared to do. That's so fucked up. They like make the decision. I mean cause it is their body. They have to go through the procedure, but it's just really, you're really just, uh, you're just a fucking Tj's hose. That's really all we are a, we were both really irresponsible and we should both have to pick up the pieces and work shit out. Here's the problem. She wants me to move in with her. Fuck that. Fuck that.

Speaker 1:          00:37:02       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:37:02       Before I read any more the fuck that.

Speaker 2:          00:37:07       Anyways, in fact she's demanded I moved in with her. A double fuck that she's making demands. Go Fuck Yourself. All right. I wish it did that earlier. I wouldn't have been as um, I can't help thinking that this arrangement would descend very quickly into mutual resentment and unhappiness and would eventually be a detrimental environment for the kid apps. A fucking lutely. I live with friends in the past and if a dirty kitchen cook can cause irritation, I don't know how shitting drooling a shitting, drooling screaming baby, we'll fly under the radar. I want to move somewhere close by so I can share their parenting duties. But I don't see how moving in is a better solution. She is also asking for financial support to the tune of half, which the Shit I've spelled out above surely makes this impossible.

Speaker 1:          00:37:59       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:38:00       Um, she's tit deep in an already blossomed career and I'm doing my best to stay away from the Dole or as Americans say, welfare. Uh, so I'm asking advice on two things. How do I re how do I relay my moving in doubts to a hormonal pregnant woman without hurting her feelings or making her feel like she has to go, go at it alone. And how can I spell it out to her that I won't be able to be there for the baby financially in the way she wants Jesus Christ. Dude, what else and how do you fucking jumped to the moon? Uh, by the way, when she told me about the pregnancy in old Jesus arrived fully formed in my mouth, go fuck yourself count. Um, you just have to have an adult conversation with her.

Speaker 2:          00:38:52       Just be like, look, who's kitten? Whoa. We're not in love with one another. You're not my soulmate. I'm not your soulmate. But we're both adults and we did this, so we have to take responsibility. Okay. Um, I would still like to meet my soulmate and I imagine you were too. And we're not going to be able to do that if we're, if we're basically pretending to be a couple, which we're not, we're not. Okay. Uh, just look at the baby like we both, we, it's like a timeshare condo. Sorry. Um, no. Just to tell you, you, you, you're not gonna move in. I'm not moving in with you. I'm going to support you 100% with the baby. 100%, but I'm not moving in. And when she says why, I just be like, oh, cause I'm not in love with you.

Speaker 5:          00:39:41       Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:39:42       we're not, we're not getting married. We screwed up and now we're doing the right thing. But um, yeah, I'm not moving in. And what's she going to do? Grab you by the throat. Make you move in. No. Fuck this. And the fact that she's making these demands, she wants half of your money. Well, this is the deal, dude. You knocked a girl up and now you got to fucking, you got a kid coming so you got to go make some money. All right. And you do have to support the kid. Um, this is one of these fucked up things. If she's got a great career, why does she need half of your salary? You know what I mean? If you had a great career, she wouldn't even fucking work. Why don't you say this? All right. How about this? Why don't I be Mr Mom. I'll stay home with the kid and you go out and work and you support me. I'll, I'll wear a fucking apron. Have added Lady, go put on your Nancy Reagan power suit and fucking have added. Yeah, Dude, look what, what, what do you, I know you got the double whammy here. I, this is, I wouldn't, I wouldn't do a double header here, although the conversation might go in that direction, but I would definitely not tell her that I'm, um, I'm moving in with her. Does, there's no fucking way. There's no way that that's happening. All right? There's no way that that's happening.

Speaker 2:          00:41:03       Um, cause I'm not in love with you. Okay. And let her ham, let her hall, let her cry, let her scream, but a throw shit. Let her do whatever the fuck she wants to do. Yeah, you're not moving in with her, sir. All right. Don't do it.

Speaker 5:          00:41:17       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:41:18       No, go to bed with the price on your head. No, don't do it. I'm sorry Beretta. Don't fucking do it. All right. And then as far as like a, you know, supporting your kid, you got to do it.

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       You got to give her the money. You can't have that, this kid. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:41:38       Isn't an unbelievably unf unfortunate situation and you have to make the best of it. And you guys have to be friends. And that's another reason for not moving in. You know, w what are you gonna sleep in the same bed? Like you're married. Like you love each. I mean, you can't fucking do it, so,

Speaker 1:          00:41:59       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:42:00       Um, I dunno, but as far as the money thing, yeah. You got to go out and start making some money and if you have to sleep on a Fuckin futon or whatever, believe me,

Speaker 2:          00:42:10       that's going to be better than having, you know, some 18 year old kids someday who, uh, had a shit childhood because of you. And then you got to deal with that and then try and put the pieces together when you're on your fucking death bed. You don't want to do that either. But uh, as far as moving in, fuck that move close by and uh, that's it. It's not up for discussion. Okay. And she can make all the fucking demand. She wants to demands fucking dope. You made a, she made a mistake to, to fuck. She'd make it demands out of you four. Furthermore, why the fuck you? Why you? Why you worry about it. All right. She can't force you to move in.

I was trying to get something to talk about on the podcast here. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:44:22       so I looked up to drudge report cause I always here, this is like something that people look at and they were talking about newt, Newt Gingrich's ex wife unloads on camera network debates, the ethics of airing what she said about her former husband before the South Carolina primary. Okay. And you guys know like when I talk about hockey and you have no idea what I'm talking about. This, this is my version of South Carolina primary for what? What is Newt Gingrich running for? Mayor of South Carolina or senator? Is that what it'd be? I don't pay attention to the shift. Um, so anyways, it gets, his is Marlene Gingrich has said she could end her ex husband's career with a single interview. Oh Hell hath no fury. Just take the fucking alimony. What did he, oh Denny Denny do something. Wasn't she sick in the hospital? And he kind of tagged somebody else. Why did he think he could get away with it? With a giant head of his? Um, anyways, earlier this week, she sat before ABC News Cameras. She spoke to ABC News reporter Brian Ross for two hours in her explosive revelations are set to rock the trial. What trial? I don't fucking know. It's just another ex wife. Just going. Absolutely. Why? Why would you do that?

Speaker 2:          00:45:48       Don't you biting the hand that feeds as much as you hate this guy and he was probably a piece of shit to you. I mean, you really going to affect his ability. If he doesn't win that political office, how can he pay for your Mercedes with all that fucking hush money? All the bribe money he's going to get. You know how cow can, how are you going to afford to get your hair and nails did every fucking two weeks, you know, if he doesn't have a job where he gets to look the other way as people pour shit in the water supply.

Speaker 5:          00:46:17       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:46:18       For God's Sakes, woman had, have you, have you thought this through?

Speaker 2:          00:46:23       I don't fucking know. All right, what am I doing here? Is that, is that all the advertising? I got to make sure I didn't miss any of the fucking advertise and they always end up flipping out at me. Oh, you know, he's supposed to read it and you didn't read it. You just go through the, couldn't you read it earlier? I think that was it. All right. That was it for the other than the Amazon stuff. And I say that every week. You know what? Where am I in the podcast right now? 46 fucking minutes in. Look at me wheezing across the fucking finish line this week. You know what? I actually had a great week. Really built. Well, it hasn't translated into a great podcast. You unfunny cons, right? I know, I know. It's been a little lack luster. Little Fuck and lack luster. Um, dear billion, I know this is last minute.

Speaker 2:          00:47:12       Oh, I didn't even tell you guys why I had a great week. I went out and I did a bunch of stand up in this bill was like four things that I've been working on meticulously crafting in front of tourists down at the comedy store. And uh, I suddenly I figured out a through line where it all connected. Like, give me that shit. When people say, you know, you don't know how to write a script, just start writing a bunch of themes, just write little vignettes and then somehow they all stick together, which you never fucking works. Um, that's like you're trying to build a house, just start hammering shit. Um, but it actually worked out with the standup thing. I have a nice through line. I have a new chunk of shit that I've strung together, like some cheesy thing with a bunch of beads and some native person that was supplanted through genocide is now sitting on the fucking curb out. Now what does it Honolulu is that when I saw them, um, supplanted, is that a word? Relocated Valentine's Day advice. Billy by deer is billion. I know this is last minute. I had a question about Valentine's Day. I am a single guy in my mid twenties rejoice,

Speaker 1:          00:48:21       okay,

Speaker 2:          00:48:21       dude, I'm going to tell you right now, if you're a single guy in your mid twenties and you live in America and you're living on your own, please drop to your knees and thank whatever God you pray to every day because you're never going to be freer in your life. I know you'll probably get student loans and blah, blah, blah. This stress and all that bullshit. Fuck that. Okay? Did never going to be freer in your life. Go get three years supplies of condoms, okay, and bang away my friend. Maybe you don't need to do it for three years. Maybe you're one of those guys for only three weeks, but you need to get it out of your system. All right? He says, I never really had a girlfriend for whatever reason. Oh, Jesus Christ. All right, we'll go on the whole other other way. Truth be told, my friends could name numerous reasons why I don't have a girlfriend, but that's an entirely different issue. Well, Jesus Christ as a fucking can of worms.

Speaker 1:          00:49:21       They could.

Speaker 2:          00:49:23       You don't seem defensive or argumentative. So I don't know if it's an anger issue that look well, I'm so, I'm so sick of trying to be fucking Hannibal Lecter here to try to guess what your shoes look like with w with the way you're right, you know. All right. I'm just going to read the rest of this shit. Uh, as of right now, I am currently sleeping with three girls off. Oh, so you're fucking, you're good knocking it out. I thought you'd like never had a girlfriend like, and you'd never bagged anybody. All right. My fault.

Speaker 1:          00:49:50       All right.

Speaker 2:          00:49:53       Do go fuck yourself. You're a guy in your mid twenties and you fucking three girls right now and I'm on this. You need advice? Uh, keep doing what you're doing anyways, depending on what day of the week it is and how much I've drank. Okay. That depends on how many girls he's banging. Ah, I've never lied to any of the, any of any of them about where our relationship is going. And although they never met each other, each of them has an idea that I'm seeing other girls. It's kind of a don't ask, don't tell policy. Uh, yeah dude and I, you got to come with that. You know, you can open with that. You know, what are you doing? I'm dating, I'm playing the field. Find people you date right now. A couple of people kind of see it just having a good time. Well, I don't do stuff like that. Well there's the door sweetheart.

Speaker 5:          00:50:44       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:50:44       Then they'll respect like that. The honesty of that. Some won't. Some will actually have self esteem and walked out, but a lot of them they'll hang around eventually the tire, their net gets weak and they'll fall right in your fucking Dick. Um, birthdays and Christmas are always a piece of cake because all that requires a quick text or a phone call or at the very most drinks at the bar. But Valentine's Day is tricky. Our dates consist of bar hopping and drunk sex. So flowers and a nice dinner would completely send the wrong message. Dude, you selfish con. Are you asking me how to keep banging these three chicks while getting through Valentine's Day? Why don't you just look at the Valentine's Day like that's your pussy getting all star break. Just take three days off the day before the day after and the day of.

Speaker 5:          00:51:31       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:51:32       Just say a, what are you doing for Valentine's Day?

Speaker 1:          00:51:35       Um, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:51:38       going to be a Jesus. Where are you going to be? I don't know. I don't have a good one for that one. All right. You know what? I just put myself in your shoes and I understand your problem now. He said, I got to do a little bit of trouble. Last year, one of the girls texted me and said, you know, every girl likes flowers on Valentine's Day.

Speaker 5:          00:51:55       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:51:55       He said, I knew my response couldn't be. Yeah, but if I get you flowers then I have to get flowers for all the other girls. So I just pushed out and responded. Yeah. Well, oh dude, you shouldn't respond to it at all.

Speaker 5:          00:52:09       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:52:09       You know, every girl likes to get flowers on Valentine's Day. Isn't that funny? And that has nothing to do with most likely her having any sort of feelings towards you. It's just the bitch next to her and the other cubicle probably got some, you know why the girl on their fucking, whatever the fuck you want to call it. Some guy broke my balls this week is fucking hilarious. He was trashing me say come off as a pompous ass because I always talk about anybody who doesn't do comedy works in a cubicle, you know, and for some reason he decided to take that seriously and tell me that he actually works at the UN and travels all around the world. If that's actually true, sir. How? Why don't you just get on with doing that? You work at the UN and you travel all over the world. Why would you give a fuck what some absolute jackass is? Say It on a fucking podcast. How insecure are you? Your insecurities? Probably a great thing because that's probably the thing that drove you to be at the UN where you travel

Speaker 1:          00:53:10       all around the world.

Speaker 2:          00:53:12       You know what sir? Good for you. That's awesome. I hope working at the UN and travel

Speaker 1:          00:53:18       rolling all around the world

Speaker 2:          00:53:20       fills you up some point where it fills you up high enough where you don't have to respond to a silly joke on some dumb ass podcast. Um, I travel all around the world. Um, you know what? That's actually a great fucking job. Do you feel like you get anything done? You know, do you sit there wearing that head piece next to that guy who was wearing the water buffalo hat? I'd bet there'd be about doing that shit. And you're sitting there trying to talk to him about how you can sell your Ritz crackers to their country. Is that what you're doing when you're traveling all around the world? I travel all around the world. I can just see you on the plane with your fucking dress socks on. You have a dash. Oh, just sitting there. Well, what movies am I going to watch on this flight as I travel all around the world? Um, anyways. You know something sir, you had you, you had the James Bond job and then you fucking, you played yourself. I don't know why you did that. Why would you fucking, that's like me responding to people on Twitter. Why would I do it? I should pretend like I have better things to do. Um, anyways, I want to keep seeing all these girls back to this guy, but this, but at the same time, I don't want any broken hearts on Valentine's Day.

Speaker 1:          00:54:45       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:54:45       Oh, to do you know what I did? I don't, I'm just, what is your problem here?

Speaker 1:          00:54:50       Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:54:51       dude. Yeah. You like a Gemini. It's like you're this fucking lady killer. Then also you kind of like, you know, you don't want to hurt anybody. Should I get her some jam jams?

Speaker 1:          00:55:00       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:55:01       I can't even, I went and talked to the fucking UN guy. What the hell was going on here again?

Speaker 1:          00:55:05       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:55:06       Valentine's Day got a little trouble last year. Well, listen, you're anticipating trouble. Didn't you learn anything from last year? You know, every girl likes flowers on Valentine's Day.

Speaker 1:          00:55:16       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:55:17       Um, what, what would I write back? I know what my response would be. The second I read that if it was just some girl I was banging and then they wrote that I would get this awful feeling in my stomach.

Speaker 1:          00:55:32       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:55:32       And I would, I would read it and as I got that awful feeling, I go and make that noise.

Speaker 1:          00:55:39       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:55:40       You know that thing like when you're just banging a girl and then all of a sudden she just fucking makes that comment.

Speaker 1:          00:55:45       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:55:45       You know, you think she's on the same page as you. When did, she just makes that comment, you know, I was thinking about you today and you just feel that feeling in your stomach. Oh yeah. Well don't fucking worst. Ah, you gotta be one and done, but one had done is scary.

Speaker 1:          00:56:07       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:56:07       You just gotta be honest. I don't know if some girls, what would I say? You know, every girl likes flowers on Valentine's Day. Um, what would I text back? Yeah. You know, that's what I heard. You know what? I don't, you know what? I shouldn't give you shit. I don't have a good response to that. Well, maybe some day you'll meet a guy who wants to give you some, you want to get drunk and fuck. Um, yeah, I got nothing and you can't ignore it. You know what I would've done? I would have ignored the texts than I would've called her. But a good three hours later, three, four hours, three hours later, that's a good one. You call her, you ignore that text. Then he called and she goes, hell, ah. And you're like, Hey, what's going on? What are you doing tonight? I got no plans. Valentine's Day. What are you doing? And he just started with that. And then she, well, when he went again, and she'll be seen, if you're gonna take it and some romantic,

Speaker 3:          00:57:04       you know,

Speaker 2:          00:57:05       direction and you don't, you just keep it in the fuck buddy. So I figured we'd go down to why meet hammers, whatever the fuck he call, we go down to, uh, take it the face. I have a couple pitchers of beer and see what happens.

Speaker 5:          00:57:23       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:57:24       Dude, you know what? You're, you're, it seems to me you're not just fucking these girls. You're actually having like these mini relationships with them.

Speaker 2:          00:57:34       You don't. The the key to have an a fuck buddy is, is the time between fucking him and I don't give a shit how much a woman says that she can handle it. Most of them can't. Most of them can't. If you fucking come on over there and you, and it just, eventually they're going to get feelings. They're more, I don't know if they're more mature or if it's a defect. It's just, I just respect the fact that that's how they're wired. So you, if you have a fuck buddy, okay, let's, let's just do the math. Okay, now, now February is a very short month here. So let's just say right out of the gate, you fuck her on February 2nd

Speaker 5:          00:58:15       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:58:16       All right. You shouldn't come around again till at least the 17th and progress you fuck and you leave f and l, you fuck them and then you leave. You don't bang her on the second. You Bang it on the second and then you bang her on the seventh year in a fucking relationship in their world.

Speaker 3:          00:58:35       You know,

Speaker 2:          00:58:38       unless you literally this second you have an orgasm as you're coming, you're scooping up your clothes and you walk out like half naked, then you just bizarre is another good way to keep them at bay. And why don't I just read the rest as to see what it, what is questioned is here he says, I want to keep seeing all these girls, but at the same time I don't want to break. I don't want any broken hearts on Valentine's Day. Yeah, you want to keep fucking all of them now do what you have to have. You have to have a road evolving door. You have to have a stable of women if you're going to live this life or you have to give into fucking rubbing one out, all right? But you can't be a relationship guy with three different women cause you are going to end up hurting them.

Speaker 2:          00:59:17       So what you have to constantly be doing, you gotta be like a college. All right? Every year you lose some top prospects, but you're out there recruiting. Okay? So you, so you maintain, but it's never ending. It's fucking exhausting. But if that's the game you want to play, that's what you have to do. So that girl who says, you know, every girl likes flowers on Valentine's Day right there, you put on waivers, okay, for a fucking piece of ass to be named later, you guys got to get rid of her, okay? And you got to look, go back and analyze what the fuck you did wrong that she felt it was okay for her to text you cause you fucked up. That right there shows that you fucked up, that she felt that she could send that to you if you think you just fuck buddies.

Speaker 2:          01:00:08       All right? So anyways, he continues. He says, I know that likert or not, this shit is important to women. If I take one girl out on playing favorites and setting a bad precedent, plus if she does that, check in Shit on Facebook, I'm completely fucked. Yeah, dude, you're doing dirt bag shit. If you're a single guy and something could happen that fucks you on Facebook, you're leaving these girls on anyways. He says, if I take none of them out or do nothing, I have three irritable ladies on my hand. Dude, are you gonna marry any of them? No. Well then let them go. Why don't you have the balls to do that? You know, when a team halfway through the season just realized, do we? When in the shit, just pull a fucking Marlin's. Just get rid of everybody and then you have fan bases your Dick and they're gonna. He's gonna be pissed for awhile. Um, but then you build it back up again. Build it back up again. You know, I dunno. Look through it. If you want to be in a fucking relationship, you know there's other ways about going about it than doing this, but you're trying to have your cake and eat it too. Did you get you, you got three women right now, your bang in three different women. Where's your confidence? You know what you're doing.

Speaker 5:          01:01:32       All right.

Speaker 2:          01:01:34       Dump to keep one at bay and then get two more. Then dump the other one to get the other one. Just see them. You don't even dump them. You just phase them out, phase them out. But the new recruits that you get in, you gotta be straight up honest with them. You know, unless you actually feel fails, you've, you feel are no feelings, you know, don't keep coming back fucking him unless you know, you get that 15 day,

Speaker 5:          01:01:58       okay,

Speaker 2:          01:01:58       you fuck I'm on the second. You fuck them on the 17th.

Speaker 5:          01:02:03       Okay,

Speaker 2:          01:02:03       then you're into March and then bang her on like the 11th.

Speaker 5:          01:02:08       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:02:08       All right. And even then, they can't catch feelings doing that. But before you know it, you know,

Speaker 5:          01:02:15       okay,

Speaker 2:          01:02:16       that's like 14, 15 days out of the year taken up. You, well, you got to bank somebody. This is such, this is, this is really should be eye opening to women that I'm actually saying this is really a, this is really awful. Not, I'm speaking this out loud. Um, he says, in a perfect world, I'll take all of them out at once and have the force and I've been chasing after my entire life, but we don't always get what we want. Any advice from the lovely Nia would be much appreciated as well. Love the podcasts. Go Fuck Yourself. Uh, yeah. She probably wouldn't have been his, uh, understanding as I was, even though I gave you a lot of shit. Um, anyways, that's the podcast for this week or a buddy. Um, and I don't, I don't have any, I'm fucking tapped out. Tapped out. It's been fucking three days under a truck.

Speaker 3:          01:03:04       Okay.
