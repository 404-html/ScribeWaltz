Speaker 1:          00:00:14       how are you doing? You doing good? That's good. I'm not my hope you are. I'm not, you know, I was going to try to tough my way through this podcast and smile and act like everything's fucking Rosie.

Speaker 3:          00:00:26       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:00:28       Oh, Jesus Christ.

Speaker 4:          00:00:30       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:00:31       It just never fucking ends. It never ends. It never fucking ends the work. Never fucking ads. Um, and on top of that, I sat down and watch some sports this weekend. Let's get it out of the way. Oh, how many you dolphin fans left the sports by be honest. How many went out into the kitchen and heard your one loyal friends still in front of the TV going, oh my God. Oh my God. And then you ran back in like, what happened? What happened? Jesus fucking Christ.

Speaker 4:          00:01:06       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:01:07       That last play of that game, that live, you know what that highlight looked like? Not the first guy caught it. The set or the guy latter lid to that literally look like, you know when you, you see an NFL, great. And then you look at one of his high school highlights, specifically the running backs you ever notice. It's like this 20 people on the other team, it seems all standing around. He just runs past all of them. And you're like, well why didn't they just tackle them? Oh cause he's an NFL guy playing against high school football players. That happened against my team. I felt bad for Gronk. He was obviously in there because they thought they were going to throw a hail Mary rather than like a fucking 15, 20 yard pass. Congratulations to the dolphins. You fucking own us in Miami patriots now nine and four.

Speaker 4:          00:01:55       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:01:56       Uh, I think it's a foregone conclusion that the road to the circle of balls now go stroke care. Um, it's going to be a fun play off. Um, not for patriots fans, not the way I fucking defense was playing, uh, yesterday. Geez, Tom Brady. Once again, once again, his dilemma, how many fucking points do I have to score? How many times do I got to put on the white hat, gallop in town and fucking save all the damsels in distress? How many times he looks fucking unbelievable, absolutely shredded the dolphins' defense. And once again comes away with the loss. I would love to see he has to have the record all time record for passing yards in a loss. 500 yards, 300 yards, 400 yards. It's fucking it. Four touchdowns, five, five, three touchdown, five touchdowns. It doesn't make a difference. And this age of no fucking difference.

Speaker 3:          00:02:51       Um, I'll tell ya, de France is so bad that they got drunk playing safety. Um

Speaker 4:          00:02:59       hmm.

Speaker 3:          00:02:59       Jesus Christ. There was so many times in that game where we could have put them away and we didn't. So, uh, but you know, it is, it's a transitional year. We lost our best running back to wide receivers, a left tackle in a corner back. And you know, it takes awhile for people all to get on the same page. You Never Deli there now, at least on the last play of the game. Jesus Christ. How do those guys even look at Tom Brady? You know when you fucking do something like that. Gronk was probably the, hey, not for nothing. I did catch one for you today, Tom. Tom Just fucking glares at him. Right? He puts on his legs. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:03:42       yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:03:43       Fucking brutal. Um, Brian's went back to back. Huh? How about that? Fucking a, that guy up there, Hyman.

Speaker 4:          00:03:51       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:03:52       Hitting Charlie Mcavoy, Mr. Game. Cause I've been on going to these fucking Christmas parties and shit out here. Still ever drank. Still have not drank fucking 15 days and feel good about myself. Uh, fuck it. Thousand 1002. Oh, I mean Mcavoy, I think that was his first game back. But uh, either way, we're, uh, we're winning games when it games with the new coach and all that and uh, I'm open. I'm going to actually get some time. I follow them on Twitter or whatever. I watched the highlights and shit so I know what's going on and beat Ottawa tonight to one and over time.

Speaker 4:          00:04:26       MMM.

Speaker 3:          00:04:28       I Dunno. I'm just trying to spend time with the family, baggies g, uh, but having a great time. Uh,

Speaker 4:          00:04:35       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:04:36       What am I relative spot this motorized car for my daughter. And she liked it the first day and then I don't know what happened. I think she pushed the button and it ran over a little foot, you know, and then she's kind of like, what's with this thing? So she kind of stayed away from it. So finally tonight I just got on the thing at the risk of breaking it and I was just going up and down the hallway going and then finally she wanted to get on it. And uh, then all of a sudden then now she doesn't want to get off it. It was pretty awesome.

Speaker 4:          00:05:11       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:05:12       Um, she doesn't get steering or stopping yet, but I just sort of a

Speaker 4:          00:05:16       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:05:17       You know, I just sort of run along with the, you know, bent at the waist for maximum fucking up, have my dad back. You know what I mean? I'm telling you, your dad, you got to get one of those foam rollers every night. And every morning I'm just on the floor rolling out my back. It's great. It's great sometimes in the middle of the day, but I must have for like 40 minutes running around like fucking Igor and Frankenstein, like literally a 90 degrees bent at the waist to try and running behind her, trying to steer this thing so she wouldn't drive it to chairs and countertops and all of this shit.

Speaker 4:          00:05:55       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:05:56       Then when she was done, I went to stand

Speaker 4:          00:05:58       up on it. Just did the AH, but it was worth it cause that's my buddy. Um, I also watched, um, liver Liverpool verse born Mouth, B. O. U. R N e m. O. U. T. H, uh, told you I was going to start watching them. Uh, Jesus Christ, most Salah four goals. Does that ever happen? I felt like I was watching some Wayne Gretzky shit every time I watched that guy other than the World Cup didn't go so well for Egypt Air. But he scored a bunch of goals and I really enjoyed it and I got to tell you, it's raining out once again. And I had this ridiculous urge to start drinking some Guinness was some fucking shots of Jameson and I'm just like a, you know, it's weird. Everything about Great Britain, Ireland, anything over there

Speaker 3:          00:06:52       just makes me want to drink.

Speaker 4:          00:06:54       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:06:55       Cause I think those are the movies that I see. You know, bakey blinders. Don't know nothing about no robbery. Right. All they do is booze on that show and they're not throwing their little sharp hats at people. Uh, you know, Ireland is fucking Ireland, Scotland, you know, they're up there drinking that fucking pine tar looking beer. Just, you know, it's always raining. What do you want to do on your terrain and out? You know, you want to start boozing but a really shit fucking defense in that game or I didn't I be naughty. I finally understood that I'm starting understand offsides a little bit more. I guess I get it because the goal is so big. You can't have people just running all around. Be fucking great. If he could though. I think what the, the, the thing that I would adjust.

Speaker 4:          00:07:42       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:07:43       On, um,

Speaker 4:          00:07:46       yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:07:47       if, if I was, if I was to buy into a soccer league here in America, I would make the goal smaller and then I would just have a blue line in hockey. And once she got into the zone, whoever was the fastest motherfucker to get out front, you know, he just make the goal a little bit smaller. Somewhere between shocker size, goal in highlight, you know, somewhere in there. Bigger than an NHL goal. Obviously it's a giant fucking ball.

Speaker 4:          00:08:18       Good.

Speaker 3:          00:08:19       Sorry I'm recording this late at night. I gotta I gotta be up with the kid tomorrow morning. Second. I do this, but uh, I really enjoyed it. Now what's the next game? What's the next game we have out there in fucking a premier league? Let's see here. Uh, liver Liverpool. You can't Liverpool sure.

Speaker 5:          00:08:41       Ball

Speaker 3:          00:08:43       shed. You'll come on, come on. There we go. Bump up Blah dude. And I thought they had another guy. Oh this one's at 1219. I need 1218

Speaker 4:          00:08:54       yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:08:55       definitely want to see that man. United game. Cause I know they're like the fucking Yankees. Oh, we Liverpool versus Napoli is going to be another one of these these football clubs with the really small stadiums. It makes me feel guilty for Rutan for Liverpool to see somebody with one of those cute little stadiums are like, well damn I gotta root for these guys. It was like the Kansas city royals or the fucking premiere league. Then they got man United. Then they, then they are up against wolves. Does not. I don't, that does not ring a bell.

Speaker 4:          00:09:24       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:09:25       Is that one of those little last stadium clubs, was that going to be one of those fucking Illuminati Freemason fucking, it's Kinda creepy logo and kind of like it Newcastle's new castle. Right. That's a bigger place. Arsenals arsenal. I know. Those are the bigger ones. Right? I think it's some big games, man. United in ourself. I recognize them 1216 and 1229 I'll be watching those games, you know, if I'm allowed to from allowed to, you know, you know it was a guy you don't call the fucking shot still. Yeah. No you do not. You know. Ah Jeez. What a fucking weird mass. On a weird week. It's just sort of a normal week now. You know, people dig it back into people's tweets. Yeah. You fucking said them when you said this back on you that you were this person that you no longer our member when you fucking did that and then somebody else comes along or what about these people?

Speaker 3:          00:10:14       They fucking did that and then the whole world it's like, well they have vaginas so it doesn't count. I saw this fucking lady, the lady former Miss Kentucky said naked pictures to a 15 year old student. Yeah, you watched the slap on the wrist. She gets, um, so it works. That's the world we live in. They have victims and they never get punished for some reason I just don't understand it. And I thought we were going for a quality here. It's like if you fuck up, you fuck up. Right. Everybody gets fucking the same fucking pound of flesh taken. No, cause that now works. I Dunno how it works.

Speaker 4:          00:10:50       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:10:51       All I know is now is I'm feeling like this is like, it's going to become a world where it's just like, ah, you know, I'll kind of do that job, but I don't want to be the guy doing the job job. I'll be on the outskirts of the guy doing the job cause I'm, I'm not going to, you know,

Speaker 4:          00:11:06       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:11:07       You know, people just, I don't know this whole fucking world now where like people are just, Oh that guy's successful or she's successful level, let's go back and let's just try to fucking ruin whatever they're doing. I think if you fucking do that, someone should go back into your life, interview a bunch of people and let's see if you're a good fucking person. Because if you're not, I mean, what the fuck's going on? Then you just bring in a cunt. He just upset because somebody else has something that you don't, is that what it is? I Dunno. Anyways, so today I went to this awesome birthday party. It was a friend of ours. So we go over there, my lovely life and my beautiful daughter. Right.

Speaker 4:          00:11:53       And

Speaker 3:          00:11:53       it's like a two year old birthday. So we fucking go over there and uh, we're having a great time. And then there's one big kid there, she's like six years old. She's like the oldest sister or somebody or whatever. And she's got like this giant like not like doll house. It's like a, I got tree fort but it's on the ground. You know, it's like a doll house that a kid can go into the fuck. Do you call that clubhouse? I don't know what it is. Right. So she's in there in the, in the dude like whose daughter was hooked it up, had like a doorbell and had a sign with, with the six year old girl's name on it in a little phone jack thing in there. I mean this thing was, was awesome. So she was in there and she was like preparing breakfast or whatever and oh my God, did I bomb in front of this six year old?

Speaker 3:          00:12:40       Every time I went left I should have went right, right. It was hilarious. Like I sat down, I was standing like watching my daughter going in and out of the doors, right. And then she announces, she goes, I made pine cones for breakfast. So I see this little seat that you sit outside almost like a for a serving windows. So I sat down, I said, oh, I go, thank, thank you very much for making me a pine cone. She goes, I didn't give it to you yet. And I went, Oh shit. Sorry. So then she hands it to me and I go, thank you. I go, how much is that? And she goes, it's not for sale. She goes, they're not for sale. And I was like, oh, all right, sorry. I thought it just struck me as like a little lemonade stand. I'm thinking, it's like, all right. And then she looks at me and she goes, it's 1250. So then I pretend to count out $12 and 50 cents. And she goes, now that's not what it costs. She goes, that's what time it is.

Speaker 3:          00:13:41       Like, Alrighty then I'm going to leave. Cause, uh, evidently I have the intellect of a three year old because you're destroying me. She got me three times in a row. Thank you for making me, uh, for the pine cone. She goes, I didn't give it to you yet. How much do I owe you? It's not for sale. It's 1250. Here's your 1250. That's not the price. It's the time. I was just like, wow, this takes me back to when I was in school. Whatever I said was just, was just, it just, I don't know. But anyways, I still had a, a a great time, you know, daughter figuring out some stuff, you know, how to go down the slide and all of that stuff. And um, you know, kids, they kind of go to this thing, we're in the beginning, they're like really outgoing. At least my daughter was.

Speaker 3:          00:14:33       And then they get shy and then, you know, we got her to be outgoing against. So it's kind of cool watching him do that. And I was, you know, it's kind of cool cause I was like in the, I was in the valley area kind of out by Van Nuys Airport and um, just the way the wind was blowing, you know, the planes would an off to like I guess, I don't know if it was the north, but sort of not towards lax. They were headed the other way and they'll kind of going over the house, which I thought was awesome. And then I looked in the alley and there was a guy with like this one floor house, any heat. He had a wind sock on top of his, a on top of his roof. Um, and I'm thinking like, is that guy like a pilot?

Speaker 3:          00:15:16       Like what? Like who the fuck could see that from the air? But in a way it was kind of cool that he was doing it. Maybe he's a pilot and he goes out and he'd just, cause he takes off from there and just kind of a straight shot down to the airport. He just sort of looks at it, but then he could just listen to the fucking 80 said anyways to know which way he's going to take off. I Dunno, I just never seen a wind sock on top of anything other than a skyscraper or at least someone with like a Helo pad on it. For those of you, you know, don't want to talk about it just basically shows which way the wind's blowing. And you always take off and land into the wind, um, for optimal performance. Um, and the last thing you do is you don't want to have it at your back.

Speaker 3:          00:15:51       That's not a good thing. Um, anyways. Uh, but we were driving up there and it's just like, I always knew people drove crazy or I don't like driving on the highway with my kid. I just don't people out here, if anybody out here is listening in La, you know, I know this isn't going to make a difference cause there's so many of you guys out here, but like that fucking shit will you pass people on the right hand side. You really gotta be key. You're going to fucking kill somebody. You know, you passed somebody on the left, the further left you go, the faster you go. All Right, the furthest left that you can go. That's the people driving the fastest. You don't drive that fast in the first fucking lane. Somebody is trying to get off the highway. They're making their way over. Now all of a sudden they got to be going like 80 miles an hour to get off the fucking highway.

Speaker 3:          00:16:44       What are you doing? Um, I just think it's because this, there's so many lanes late til like six lanes out here on either side that I think all the rules, it just becomes, I don't know what it is and there's so much traffic. I just feel like people are just like, oh my God, an open fucking lane. I can go a quarter of a mile and not have to hit the brakes. And they just, they just fucking slammed the gas down. Whatever the hell it is they're doing. But um, it's really unsettling. And then I'm sitting there with any, I don't want to fucking snap and I can't kiss my kids in the car cause I don't want to fucking be that guy. Um, I dunno dude. But anyways, I'm doing some benefits out here this week. Uh, I believe Thursday night I'm going to be up at the ice house and on a, then I'm also doing one at the, uh, the Fonda theater for, um, for, uh, who the hell is it for the comedy store? So that's what I'm doing this week. I've got a couple of those things. I mean, I gotta be doing my, try

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       to take some time off before I go to Europe, but I also have to be on my game when I go to Europe. So it's sort of a slippery slope, but I got a bunch of new shit that I want to talk about. I can't wait to talk about it. Uh, get on stage here. Um, tomorrow night I think I'm going to head out somewhere here in La and tried to get on some stage to get some stage time, I should say. And I still have not fixed my headphone Jack here, but I am done flipping out about it because

Speaker 4:          00:18:18       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:18:18       I'm trying to be a better man. Um, anyways, so when somebody gets, so when some woman gives a speech at an awards show, I could sit there nodding like, yes, I did the work. I've done the work. I understand now. Uh, simply safe.

Speaker 1:          00:25:24       We will be screaming and yelling about shit that's in people's Twitter feeds. And meanwhile, the bankers are about ready to fuck fuck over another generation of retirees. And once again, they will not go to jail. You know what I mean? And I got to fucking sit here and listen about gender neutral bathrooms. You know? Do you know what are you guys have in your house or your apartment? You know what you're already have. You have a gender neutral, a fucking bathroom. As long as you got to sit down toilet. I mean, that pretty much covers the entire spectrum of way a human being can go to the bathroom, you know? But I want to find that half my fellow at on it

Speaker 1:          00:26:10       me, while they're building another luxury high rise apartment with fucking old people's money, our money and our will live long enough to fucking get out of it. I don't know what the fuck we're doing need to do, man, is we need to legalize weed at a federal level and we need to export it and we need to get the world high. So they like us again and then we take all that money. We pay for this never ending war. And then meanwhile we get onto some sort of fucking electrical and solar power even though at the end of the day it's probably not cleaner. But what it will do is put all these fucking people out of business because won't have any oil money. They'll pay the Turks they want to go is up. Why don't we do that? And everybody will be having a Holly jolly Christmas. It's the best time of the year. Buba to beat [inaudible]. I don't know if they'll be snow.

And, and, and I guess they got some sort of warning where they were saying, you know, Peter was saying, you know, you shouldn't say it's raining cats and dogs any more because if they actually were falling out of the sky from a rain cloud, they get hurt. It's just like, yeah, well we understand gravity, but that's never happened. Okay. So of course I went in there.

Everybody, if you listening, it says Safari, then it says file edit, view history, bookmark, develop, window help. I'm not going into help. I've done that too many times. I fucking ask a question and it never answers the question that I fucking asked. You know, I've just been hurt too many times. Do you know what I mean? Do you know what I mean? It's just one of those things. Uh, all right. The first known decorated tree. Oh, Christmas tree. Oh, Christmas tree. How lovely are your branches? You have fucking there. You're really a shrub in a month. Be a nub cause you won't get water. Then you go out in the trash. It's like a puppy mill for trees. Oh, Christmas tree

Speaker 3:          00:30:59       lyrics. Let's see here. Well, let's take me to Wikipedia. Uh, okay. And so Christmas tree, oh, Christmas tree, a lovely yards. Xy branches. Jesus. Some of the powdered wig wrote this one. Oh, Christmas tree. Oh, Christmas tree just felt the letter o not o. H how lovely are thy branches? Ben Franklin is a fucking drunk. Paul revere. Bages horse. Oh, Chris. Smell these original lyrics. Oh, your bows. So you're both so green and summer time. Stay bravely green and winter time. Oh, Tan and bomb. Oh, Christmas tree. How lovely are there? I don't know what a bow is. I don't want to tan it. Bomb. That's like a rich person's last name. Mr [inaudible] right now I gotta look, I got a few to Tana bomb is now. They just start fucking singing about it. That's when you know you were under the holidays when you know what all his fucking shit means. You know those Martha Stewart type chicks? You know the fan girls that really liked keep up, but they'll know how to make it and ball.

Speaker 4:          00:32:16       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:32:17       Oh, bomb is a German Christmas song based on a traditional fast and what I want Wikipedia you fucking intrusive. Cons. Oh Tana Boggis. It's all one thing. Oh, Tannin ball. Oh wait, did they ride? Oh, Christmas tree. I guess all that means is all that means tree in, Oh shit. When I go to Germany next month, I'm gonna have to sing that to all those fucking crowding and sons of bitches over there. Oh,

Speaker 1:          00:32:49       old Tynan bomb. [inaudible] bomb, um, is a German Christmas song based on a traditional folk song. It became associated with the traditional Christmas tree by the early 1920s and sung as a Christmas Carol. The modern lyrics were written in 1824 by leaps zig by the leap Sig organists teacher and composer Ernst options. Shush. A Tannenbaum is a fir tree. The lyrics do not exactly actually referred to Christmas tree or describe a decorate Christmas tree. Instead they refer to the first evergreen quality as a symbol of constancy in faithfulness. Oh, I see.

Speaker 3:          00:33:33       This guy was alone in the woods, started having fucking failings about a tree. You know what I mean? Yet we still complain in this country crisis. People in Germany, right? And songs about trees. Well, I guess we have tree huggers here. You know, eventually whoever the pita is for trees, who's at fucking Greenpeace, you know, they're not going to like the expression tree hugger because the tree has no say in that physical contact. So in a way it's a form of assault. Um, all right. The first known decorated Christmas tree, dear Billy, ghost of Christmas past. I really do look like that though. I did. You know that on your tour of Europe you'll be stopping in the city where the oldest recorded decorating of a Christmas tree went down. I didn't know that. Ragga or Riga, Latvia. That almost sounds like two characters on fucking taxi.

Speaker 3:          00:34:33       Riga and Laca Riga, Latvia. Heard a friend talking about it and immediately thought of you. What's your favorite way to decorate a tree? I quickly, uh, without my wife in the room telling me I'm doing it wrong. Um, what else? Um, I dunno, I, I, my favorite way to decorate tree would be a, with my lovely wife, with some Eggnog, with some Christmas music on a little booze in the egg. Nog We do a little slow dance. I kiss her under a missile toe, you know, one of the last year she can do that because that's a major crisis for white women that you know, that there's mistletoe out there, I guess. You know, they really have a lot of problems and that's like one of the ones right on the top of the list. You know, I mean forget about climate change and that swirl a trash in the Pacific Ocean. Can't even say it. I think what we need to get down to first off is what's the deal with mistletoe. Um, okay. Anyways, I, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:35:41       when you have camel toe during the hozzle holidays, is that called mistletoe reverse? Mistletoe upside down. Inverted mistletoe. I Dunno. Uh, when I was a kid we made ornaments in school with macaroni. Yeah. Then you'd spray painted gold.

Speaker 3:          00:35:56       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:35:56       Uh, macaroni glitter and white glue and shit like that. I doubt that they do that anymore. Thanks and love to you and the family and the mom, Photoshop guy who lets me see you and all your imaginary glory. Uh, yeah, we use those used to be a thing like, um, I made, you know, yeah, you still make ornaments. I remember there was one, it's like it took a coffee cup.

Speaker 4:          00:36:22       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:36:23       And then some, one of those pipe cleaner things, you know, you cut a hole in the bottom of the cup and yet I know somehow you ran a piece of macaroni and it's supposed to look like a bell and the top of the pipe cleaner coming through was the handle.

Speaker 1:          00:36:39       Then they, then they would make a cardboard cutout of a little or a paper cut out of a, uh, a Christmas tree. Then you put a bunch of macaroni on it for whatever reason, macaroni was a big deal. You'd glue it to the paper and then you'd spray painted gold and then he'd give it to your mother. And she looked at it like, that is the ugliest fucking thing I've ever seen. But my kid made it and I loved my kids. So that will now go on the fucking front door

Speaker 3:          00:37:02       until you're 47. Um, yeah, I dunno, I'm not, you know, I like ornaments. I wish we had a lot more of them, but like I don't like those Christmas tree shops. They creep me out and like really

Speaker 1:          00:37:23       people that, that go in there are weird in a way that I'm not weird. And what however are weird is it just fucks with my weird and I get, I get all weirded out man. And I just fucking, I just leave. I can't do that. You know, I'm trying to get to the point where I'm not saying that there were a bunch of fucking Weirdos in there cause I know I'm weird. Right. But I go in there and it's like a,

Speaker 3:          00:37:44       you know, plus I don't like clutter. I don't like a bunch of shit around my house, you know what I mean?

Speaker 4:          00:37:52       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:37:52       It's like those people that like, you know, he'd go buy somebody's house and every year they have like, you know, those figurines and shit that they put in the front yard. And every year you see the same ones and then they add a few more.

Speaker 4:          00:38:08       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:38:09       Yeah. Have you ever thought about like where the fuck do they put those things? The other 11 months of the year.

Speaker 1:          00:38:17       Like how much of that of the garage is that taking? Like it's the middle of July. It's hot as shit. You going in there, you're trying to find the cooler and then you're walking by like reindeer and snow men and all that. That's just, that's just, that's too fucking weird for me.

Speaker 3:          00:38:33       You know, I don't want to step over that shit. Right. I just, we just have like, we just had the Christmas tree lights and then we just put the bulbs on it and I put them on the tree and my wife's stands back and she, uh, well this year she did it that way. You know, she always decorated in other years. This year we've got the kids, so she was just kind of holding her and telling me there's too many blue ones there. You need a little more red and then put some green over there. And uh, you know, so there was that. I probably would enjoyed that more if I was boozing. I'm not going to lie to you, but, um, but I didn't, I wasn't, I've been drinking my eggnog straight this year with the little shot of nutmeg.

Speaker 4:          00:39:21       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:39:21       And, um, if I sound bored shitless, I am.

Speaker 4:          00:39:25       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:39:26       It's this time of night, it's nine 10 at night. This is the time of night. We'll usually, you know, I'm having a good time and I just don't anymore. But I will tell you in the morning's the best thing about being sobers the fucking morning, you know, you wake up, you feel like a fucking million bucks and um,

Speaker 4:          00:39:42       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:39:42       Yeah, I dunno. Anyways, it's always a weird time of year. I love the holidays and it's also depressing that another fucking year went by. But then the second is January 1st and like, it's all ahead of me. I'm going to make those changes. How many to become a better person?

Speaker 1:          00:39:56       Uh, if air,

Speaker 4:          00:39:58       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:39:59       if air, why not buy, see a dear Billy frisbee frown. I don't even know what that means. I don't want to know about that means. I don't know. I don't know that. I don't need to know that. My frown is weird too. I already have enough physical fucking hangups. Frisbee frown. I'm bill. I'm a, I'm a little behind on the podcast since I watched my one year old girl fulltime. Oh yeah. But you hit the lottery. They're the best and have to censor what I play in my house now. Yeah, yeah. I understand that. Um, he says a little while ago you were explaining that you choose not to go into the ocean saying that it's an unnecessary risk and basically that we don't belong in there compared to the other animals that do belong. I don't disagree with you. Okay. But I am just wondering by that logic how you justify going after your pilot's license license or whatever it takes to fly your worldly birds and the like. I was hoping you would compare this while you were talking about it, but I don't think you ever did. Obviously as humans we take a lot of crazy risks every day. Like just getting in a car and going 70 miles per hour. Yeah, I know. And doing that in the left hand lane and all it takes is one fucking asshole and the other side you ever see that shit or where the t the the fucking 18 wheeler jack knives and comes over on the other side.

Speaker 4:          00:41:30       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:41:31       You know, I got the kid in the car now so I try to stay in the right lane, but everybody's doing 90 miles an hour out here on it. I'll try. It's crazy. Anyways, but I would like, I would think the pilot thing would fall under the same category is taking a swim on the beach. Thanks as always for the great podcast. My wife always knows if I have you on my headphones by the stupid grin on my face, go fuck yourself. Um, great question sir. Um, well, the reason why I got a pilot's license was because I read up on the banking system and realized that it was a giant Ponzi scheme. And I was afraid because of how dysfunctional the city that I live in is, you know, you can barely get out of it when everybody, when it's all working, forget about if the shit hit the fan, how would I get Outta here? And the only way I could think was

Speaker 4:          00:42:25       okay

Speaker 1:          00:42:25       to learn how to fly a helicopter, get up and get out. Now I did the first part of the plan. Now the major part of the plan is to actually have access to a helicopter close by.

Speaker 4:          00:42:41       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:42:44       You know, that's why I did it. And uh, but I will tell you, it is a, a, you know, there is an element of danger to it. But now that I have my kid, I don't solo that much. Every once in a while I do just to, you know, just to know that I can do it. But for the most part I just, I'll fly with an instructor and, you know, I don't do anything crazy. You don't fly and like, you know, you know, wins beyond a certain amount of knots. And I also will tell you though, it's way, way, way, way, way safer than getting in a car and going on the highway. And I have experienced both and I can tell you like, you know, there's nobody up there. I mean there is, but you know what I mean. But there is it and it's like we're talking to each other, we're in the same airspace and we're announcing our position and where we're at.

Speaker 1:          00:43:43       Okay. And if we don't see each other, then you take offensive moves, I guess a defensive move, your proactive like at the guys at the same altitude. You just tell them, well, okay, I'm going to ascend 200 feet or whatever the fuck you need to do. And then even if you don't see each other till the last second, you literally like hundreds of feet above or below him and it's fine. Um, there's no radio contract contact on the highway and you are basically flying in formation with people who are on meds. They're texting, they didn't get enough sleep. They suck at driving. They don't, maybe they're really good at driving, so they're driving like a fucking lunatic. Like everybody else is as good as they are. Those people are probably more, even more dangerous than someone just sucks it driving and drive slow. Um, and there's a

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       lot of times that I've, you know, finished flying, flying solo and landed and got in my car and within two miles of going down the street, I watched somebody just fucking t-bones somebody else, somebody go flying off a fucking scooter and land on my side of the fucking road and slide on their face. So we just driving in the left lane and didn't, for whatever reason, just veers into the fucking, they were texting, weren't paying attention, literally slammed into the median between, you know, both sides of the highway. Fortunately stayed on this side of the highway so they didn't, you know, go up and over and kill somebody and literally just went spinning.

Speaker 4:          00:45:16       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:45:17       Three 63 63 it's like five, three sixties across six lanes of traffic before slam. Like a stock car accident. MMM. Nobody near the guy. Just fucking did. I see that all of the time, so I understand what you're saying. And I have to be honest with you, like, um, it is an unnecessary risk. Um, but I find it, I most of what I say about the oceans because they have such a tremendous fear of it and I just can't get over that. All of this shit is, you know, I'm treading water with my head above it, you know what I mean? And, and everything else is like, I don't know, did you ever go into a pit of poisonous snakes and then bury your head in the sand is they're all just sort of fucking slither and pasture? Um,

Speaker 1:          00:46:08       uh, yeah. And just things can go down. This things down there. They can literally swallow you whole or bite you in half. And they are, you know what, a thousand times faster than you. Um, yeah, I mean say what you want about flying. Like I, you know, the altitude I fly at like I don't, I can, I can still breathe. I don't need any assisted or pressurized cabin or anything like that. This, it's, it's, you know, you don't, you pick your poison, but I'll tell you like, uh, there's a couple of things that I watch that just, you know, literally make my palm sweat. One of them is cave diving. And if you ever want to just just, you know, hear the most unbelievable story ever. I, I forget that that fighter's name. He's actually one of my favorite UFC fighters. Um, what is his name? Cowboys something. Um, okay. Is it from like New Mexico or whatever? He's just like the one of the baddest dudes ever. He never, um, he, he caved dies and he was on the Joe Rogan experience. Uh, just look up Joe Rogan experience, uh, cave

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       diving and just listened to that fucking story.

Speaker 4:          00:47:33       MMM.

Speaker 3:          00:47:35       And you're literally listening to the guy they went through at sea, you know, somehow he lives, but still, you're like, I was literally sitting there, you know, when you do that thing, when you put your hands like over your nose and your mouth to sit in there and you're cute, your index fingers or between your eyes. I was just sitting there like they just covering my mouth, just listening to this fucking story. The guy literally said that they have a rule down there that when someone gets in trouble in a cave dive, you just leave them because someone's going home, someone's going to make it home because,

Speaker 4:          00:48:12       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:48:13       It's so fucked up down there that if you try to help that person than both of you are going to die.

Speaker 4:          00:48:19       MMM.

Speaker 3:          00:48:22       That's kind of how it starts. And then it goes from there. So anyways, uh,

Speaker 4:          00:48:29       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:48:30       Yeah, cave diving. And then, um, those people who do that free climbing up skyscrapers in every time you think they're up to, they make those fucking videos and every time you think they went up is high. They're literally on the fucking radio tower and they just keep going up and up and up and up and up. And it's just like, I just sit there like, oh, right, I don't know how the fuck anybody can do some shit like that. So maybe that's why I said most of what I say, I saw jaws at a certain age and I just never got over it. I just never got over. I'm like, I'm all fucking set on that. It's so crazy to me. Like, you know

Speaker 4:          00:49:07       that

Speaker 3:          00:49:09       would you ever go in, you know, into the g? Whatever's left to the jungle in Africa with is just wild fucking hyenas and tigers and lions and fucking hyenas and any God knows fucking what out there. Would you ever go out there without a damn weapon?

Speaker 4:          00:49:28       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:49:29       Okay. And then you go into the fucking ocean. No guns worked down there.

Speaker 4:          00:49:36       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:49:37       As far as I know. Yeah. But you can have is that stupid little fucking bow and Arrow contraption. Alright, now I gotta look up underwater gun.

Uh, there's no fucking bird of prey that's going to grab onto your, uh, whatever the fuck you're flying.

Speaker 4:          00:52:21       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:52:23       Anyways, uh, but thank you for listening to the podcast, but you know, you are right though. I am a bit of a hypocrite, but like I said, most of it is just me being afraid of the ocean. Uh, gift list, pressure bill. My wife gets mad that I don't tell her what I want for Christmas or birthdays. Yeah, well it's a pain in the ass because then she has to guess anyways, obviously now the issue is Christmas. I told her I have everything I need and like you, I'm trying to thin out all my junk. It actually stresses me out because I'm being led to feel bad for not wanting to,

Speaker 4:          00:52:55       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:52:56       Two gifted, something to be gifted. Something. Just ask her for an experience. Just ask her, you want to go to a car show or something like that. Something we could do together. Just do that. So she has something. All right. Uh, we both make a lot of money and buy whatever we want. She doesn't need anything either, but gave me a cute idea of something small. I guess. She's not a total bitch and just Jesus, she's big. She's not even remotely a bitch.

Speaker 4:          00:53:22       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:53:23       Does is complete the, I would throw this and fucking bitch court if you even every, why are we or why did you waste my time with this? I guess she's not a total bitch. I just, and just wants to make me happy. But in a roundabout way, it ruins the fun of it sometimes. How do you deal with this? Um, yeah, I usually just ask for a

Speaker 4:          00:53:45       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:53:45       Inexperienced. It's usually some place I want to go to. Like, uh, my, I'm a big fan of a,

Speaker 4:          00:53:53       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:53:53       You know, hamburgers stands like greasy spoon type places. I don't like, I'm not a big fan of fancy fucking restaurants. I mean, I like going there, whatever, but like, I love going to like, uh, you know, there's a couple of places, a place on bill's Burgers I wanted to go to. Ironically enough, although I heard the guy doesn't work there anymore, but the burgers are still tasty. Um, I love a great taco truck, food trucks. Um, I like doing Jack Shit like that and like going to car shows and you know, I went to a Christmas party at this custom motorcycle, um, uh, shop, uh, the one that Keanu Reeves bought into and went down and just like, I mean to me as an adult, that was like Christmas. I went down there and they were talking about how are they make the parts by hand and how like a 1200 pound slab of like aluminum will come in in from that, like ice sculptors except it use it with the aluminum. They make parts for these absolutely gorgeous motorcycles, arch a r, c h motorcycles. And um,

Speaker 4:          00:55:02       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:55:02       I Dunno, like, I think because I became like a closet gearhead out here where I don't know how to do any of that shit, but I could literally watch somebody work on a car. Describe how they, Eric the car guy. I'm a huge fan of his. I, uh, you know, I love that shit. So whatever the hell you're into. She loves you. Just gay. She wants to give you something. Jesus Christ. Um, it's like she's going to buy a desk. Um, anyways, you got a bottle of booze. You're like, I dunno. Boxing. Hey, Billy bank shot the third. I recently been getting fitter thanks to training sessions at a boxing gym. Good for you. Uh, in wanting to test myself and try some low level legal, of course, amateur boxing. Dude, there's no fucking reason to get your bell rung for no fucking money when you're not going to try to pursue it as a profession, then be careful now.

Speaker 1:          00:56:00       She goes, my girlfriend won't allow it. Good for her. She likens me trying it out to her, trying outstripping in front of a crowd. And how against the idea and how against that idea I'd be, can't say she's wrong. Uh, do you recognize, should try a couple of fights just to see if I like it and not tell her or do I respect your wishes and leave it as a, that doesn't need to be answered. Um, sir, I would never tell you not to pursue your dreams, but uh, I wouldn't do it sneaking around. I would.

Speaker 4:          00:56:33       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:56:35       Bet the very least tell her that you're going to do one fight.

Speaker 4:          00:56:39       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:56:41       But you know, what are you going to, what if you go when you get your fucking nose broken and then he got to show up and try to be like Luca. All right. My name is Luca. I live on the second floor. I walked into a fucking door. You don't have to, you don't have to do that. Right. Um, I dunno. I, I, yeah, communication is always the way to go with the woman is what I've learned and I've learned and I keep learning. And you communicate with them and through the communication, they'll win. They'll end up telling you how it's going to go down because it always goes down the way they want it to go down. And that's basically it.

Speaker 4:          00:57:20       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:57:22       And that's basically a dude, what they say goes. If you want to stay with them and it's brutally not fucking fair, but you're a guy and nobody gives a shit. So what I would do if you're going to go ahead and do with it anyways, I would just,

Speaker 4:          00:57:37       mmm.

Speaker 1:          00:57:40       I would just tell her that you're going to do it. It's something that you need to do something. You need to prove to yourself or whatever the fuck it is. And, uh, you know, other than that, keep moving your head there, buddy. Uh, overrated living in major cities. Is there anything worse than a bunch of losers thinking that if they live where it's cool to live, that they're cool too. Ah Dude, you're preaching to the choir here. That's what I've done my entire adult life and I am not cool. They completely deny the fact that living on top of one another is frustrating and unnatural. New York smells like shit. La is overcrowded. I New York does it smell like shit areas of it does. New York, Manhattan is like a giant bed bath and beyond. Now La is definitely overcrowded.

Speaker 4:          00:58:25       MMM,

Speaker 1:          00:58:27       absolutely. But I gotta be honest with you though. Um, so where are you suggesting to live? Cause if you get to rural then then it deck just gets too fucking boring.

Speaker 4:          00:58:42       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:58:45       Your food options, a lot of options. You know, you want to go see a band and they're not going to come anywhere near yet. Now you gotta jump in a car for four fucking hours. I definitely envy people who live in wide open spaces and shit like that. Uh, I think it's really cool and I got a lot of respect for people that live out there. Like that, but just living where I've lived, uh, I don't know how long I could do it. I go a little fucking stir crazy, although there's a lot of people here in la that, you know, have that second home and fucking Wyoming or whatever. Um, but my wife isn't going to, it would never go

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       for that self. And she makes the decisions, um, underrated, uh, living in midsize cities. Oh, here's his answer. There's nothing better than a city that's not really a city. I, you know, I'd go with that and I have my favorite ones. Uh, and these are all cities. I wouldn't say they're not cities, but like, uh, I'm a big fan of Milwaukee, uh, Chattanooga. Um, what else comes to mind? Uh, those are two of my favorites. Is that it? I think so. I mean, I enjoyed when I was up in Idaho and Montana.

Speaker 4:          01:00:08       MMM.

Speaker 3:          01:00:10       It just seems like nobody really fucks with the up there, but then they had like a massive math problem. So there's always something. There's always something, you know what I mean?

Speaker 4:          01:00:19       MMM.

Speaker 3:          01:00:21       I just switched with all the fucking global warming like that. I just wish that there, those people could still enjoy the climates that they moved there for. Um, cause, you know, just growing up on the east coast and everything, I think it's, you know, I missed the four seasons and shit. And, uh, I also think it's really cool to kind of live out in places like that. You know, having said that, you know, the experiences that I've gotten living in La, this is one of my favorite cities. And I also love New York as much as I make fun of both of these cities.

Speaker 4:          01:00:50       MMM.

Speaker 3:          01:00:53       Where else? You know, I, you know, living in a sports town, I'll tell you what's under rated two FTE move away is going back and live in your fucking home state again. You know, when you don't have to get by all the fucking sports packages, just to watch a regular season, game me a team as pretty fucking overrated too. Um, all right. That's the podcast for this week. A Merry Christmas. Happy Hanukkah. Oh, Hanukkah is going on right now. Happy Hanukkah, everybody. And uh, go fuck yourselves and I'll check in on you on Thursday.
