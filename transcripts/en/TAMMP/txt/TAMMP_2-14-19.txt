You know I was watching TV the other day because I'm not a big reader, you know, unless it's got a lot of pictures and they sound out the words for me. And there was this woman on TV, right? One of these daytime talk shows assump shit. She was just like Happy Valentine's Day week. I sell, I think we should celebrate the week. It's a week of love. It's just like how much free shit are you trying to get? It stopped back then. Like you're celebrating love. You're not, you celebrate and you yes. Selfish. Why is she a whore bill? Cause she's on television. What? Too much makeup. All right, let me, Jesus Christ, why aren't you just out there walking the block? Um, Oh man, I'm in a grumpy ass fucking mood cause I want to go to bed B to the motherfucking Ed. I want to go to bed bitches. I don't know why I'm talking like a fucking old white housewife right now who watched a hip hop video, but I am mother fuckers. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:01:45       I uh, yeah, I want to go to bed, but I got to go out and got to go run my hour. I got to go run it because I'm doing the special soon. I've got to hit the comedy gym and all I want to do is try out my new fucking ideas. Right? That's what I want to do. But I can't, I got to fucking dude. I gotta I gotta be, I gotta be like, you know, middle of 10th about it. I know it's weird. What I have to do is do my new ideas and then start with a joke. I'm going to fucking maybe start with and then run the fucking shit and then in the end I'm not going to do it. I just need to be on stage talking. That's all I need to do. Okay. I don't know how these fucking people do it, where they write the whole thing out, have the whole thing memorized or whatever. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:02:27       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:28       I don't know if it's, I'm lazy or maybe that's not how my brain works. I have no fucking idea. All I know is I'm running it tonight and then that's it. Then I'm coming home, I'm going to bed and then a buck and waking up the next day. I got it. Table read for F is for family episode four.

Speaker 1:          00:02:44       Fucking season has been great so far. We get some new writers and they're crushing it. And um, I dunno, we're almost next week. Next week we'll do four or five maybe right there. Then we'll be halfway through the season already. And now you're thinking, well shit, Bill, what's it going to come out in June? Oh, I mean just halfway through. Just the first initial writing of it. Well, how does it work, Bill? How would you like to know how it works in case? So you write the fucking thing, right? And as you're writing the episodes, they come back with something that's known as an animatic. An animatic is basically, it's just basically black and white sketched. And they're like, well, this is how we're going to draw what you wrote. Does this look good? And Mobility, like we like this, don't have that chair there. Have him stand up, have a move his arm like this up and down when he says, what the fuck is going on in here?

Speaker 1:          00:03:31       Right. You do that and then it comes back, it's a little more drawn, a little more color, you know, that's how it goes. Just like that. But we're on the fourth season so they know what we like, we know what they like, so it moves like last season moves along quickly. So I'm hoping, uh, we'd get this fucker done, um, as soon as possible. So, uh, anyways, um, then I'm going to take my lady out for fucking Valentine's Day. That's what I'm going to do. And I'm going to try to be a nice guy and try not got to get into a fight. Try not to have any appeared yet.

Speaker 4:          00:04:06       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:04:08       Yeah. I, you know what, I'm, I'm doing so much shit right now that I want to fucking go off on, but I can't go off on it because other people's lives will be affected. You know what? Are you talking about? Some top secret shit, Bill? No, I'm not. I'm just talking about, you know, I dunno. Just bullshit in my fucking life. Like, uh, you would never know it, but I am not in a good mood right now. All right. I'm not in a good fucking mood, but I gotta do this. I have responsibility to you. Okay. I answered the call 12 years ago to start podcasting. Okay. The same way somebody answers the call to defend the freedom of this country. All right? Now, God damn it. If white women in this country can somehow enjoy white privilege and then yet also make themselves victims than God dammit, I can put myself on the same level as someone who's fighting, you know, what are they saying? They're doing it. They're fighting for our freedom. That's right. Fighting for our freedom,

Speaker 4:          00:05:20       right?

Speaker 1:          00:05:22       As a podcast warrior, living my truth, I think I'm slowly going insane. Um, anyways, I don't have any advertising here. I don't know what's going on. So fucking podcast has been going off the rails lately. I'm not going to lie to you and you don't want to think. A lot of the biggest fucking problem is, you know what the biggest fucking problem is right now, aside from the fact that I have no guest. And then sitting here by myself, you're listening to one of one of, I'm like a [inaudible] right now. Right? Uh, the biggest fucking problem my life right now is I'm sober. You know, I don't know how the puck of people do this shit. I'm trying to think back to my life before ever drank

Speaker 1:          00:06:10       because I had a hell of a run. I went in, I went, I didn't start drinking until I was like 17, you know, I had a couple sips of beer here or there, but basically I spent the first 16 years of my life sober. I don't know how I did it, but I think back, I didn't have any, there was no pressure now to get up and do my paper route. That was the biggest thing. Occasionally it had to go collecting, maybe it rained out in some of the papers. Got Wet. Maybe there was that. Maybe had a book report. I mean those were the pressure days. I wonder if kids over in Europe, you know when they got a big book report the next fucking day, you know, after they give the book report, do they drink like a fucking couple of shots just to unwind, you know, cause there's just so much more progressive over there and they can allow their kids to booze. I don't fucking know. I don't know how it works. I don't pretend to know. Um, but anyways, I'm committed to this shit though. I'm not drinking this year.

Speaker 5:          00:07:05       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:05       Now I know those animals and Aa, they tried to say you gotta go day to day. All right? But they were different. They were different group of people.

Speaker 5:          00:07:15       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:15       All right. If you ever think you an alcoholic, go to an AA meeting and just listen to the fucking stories and you know, come out the other side and tell me your as fucked up as those people. I, I double dare you to fucking do it. You know, you're just come out of there and be like, oh, you know, I'm a fucking binge drinker. That's what I am. You know what I mean? Once I start losing teeth, you know what? I kind of dial it back. I'm not standing outside the fucking liquor store waiting for it to open.

Speaker 5:          00:07:46       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:07:47       Fucking and mouthwash. Yeah. We go to an AA meeting. You want to feel good about yourself? You go to a fuck at AA meeting. Just look at those fucking animals just sitting there. God Damn. Cigarette ashes. Fucking all over the EDA. Yellow fingers. Just shoven donuts down there. Fucking pie holes done. Unbelievable. Yeah. It's funny. I haven't been in a, I went to two AA meetings. What was it? One? Yeah, to like 30 years ago.

Speaker 5:          00:08:20       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:20       Well only cause the court told me I had to um, it's a whole other fucking story. Eli's got a tiller. The stags dad get out gallery tag, but I gave it a your fucking legs. His back. All right, I'll go to these things. And that was every fucking story. They would say the most fucked up shit ever jaw on the ground. Like you gotta be fucking kidding me. How did you live through that? And then right after that, and they'd be like, and then the craziest thing is, you know I want to do is have another drink. Oh, Jesus Christ. I love making fun of alcoholics. I really do. Alcoholics, feminists. Who else? The Obamas. I was fucking people. Jesus Christ. I don't know what fucking deal with the devil did they sign that they just fucking get off Scott fucking free out there with all that corporate money hanging out of their fucking pockets. Everybody out here is looking at him like they're fucking, I dunno what.

Speaker 4:          00:09:29       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:09:32       Anyways, I, why do I talk politics? I don't pay attention to it. Every time I start to look at it, it, it just fucking, uh, I don't know. It either bores me to tears or scares the shit out of me. You know? It's either like somebody filibustering on the fucking floor or it's like, I dunno, you just watched them, you know, building up a new candidate. And so much of it has nothing to do with their message. It has to do with way the way they look.

Speaker 4:          00:10:03       Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:10:05       you know, it goes back to Clinton. He played the saxophone on fucking our Cineo this watershed fucking moments in politics that changes it forever. You know, like, uh, as far as the age of television, you had Nixon sweating sitting there like a fucking catcher. You know what John F. Kennedy was all tanned up with this fucking legs crossed. You know, like he was hanging out at a fucking country club and people who listen to the debate said Nixon won. And people who watched it said, Kennedy won. You know, Nixon with his sweaty upper lip.

Speaker 4:          00:10:41       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:10:42       Yeah. That was it. That was a moment. Michael Dukakis sticking his head out of that fucking tank. That was a moment. Bill Clinton playing the saxophone and then I would say, uh, Donald Trump, this last one where he didn't really debate as much as he just sort of trash he just sorted was doing a roast.

Speaker 4:          00:11:09       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:11:11       That's what I want to see just as a standup comic is how are People gonna fucking debate. That guy,

Speaker 4:          00:11:20       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:11:23       takes me back to like, when Patrice was alive, we just couldn't beat the guy. So you'd literally walked down to the comedy cellar and I would have like fucking four insults. I would just be thinking about his face was something I saw him do on stage and I would have like four fucking insults ready to go,

Speaker 4:          00:11:42       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:11:44       just so I could get to the table and sit down and order some fucking food. I feel like Trump, you got to do the same thing.

Speaker 4:          00:11:53       Like

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       Hillary should have just abandoned, you know, whatever fucking horse shit she was going to say. Right. And just fucking attack this to pay, you know, and, and just this stupid look on his face and should have just sat there and imitate it. She should just fucking, uh, I believe that the, the, the youngsters call it clowned him. He should, he should've just trashed them back. Um, I dunno, that was such a fascinating fucking thing to see happen.

Speaker 1:          00:12:22       There was all these fucking rules and he just came in there like a God damn bull in a China shop and traipsed right through all of it. And those people all had no answer. All those years I watched those debates in these fucking guys running the debates, acting like they had this fucking control that if you fucking broke these rules, that something was gonna happen, that there was some sort of repercussion for it. So no one ever did for the most part. You know, they talk a little bit over their time. Trump completely fucking ignored all of them. And when he did, they had nothing. Absolutely fucking nothing. So I dunno, what does he like? He said, only two years in little over two years.

Speaker 6:          00:13:10       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:11       So you've got this year, you got next year and then the show starts again. What do you guys think? Let's fucking handicap this like a football. It's the beginning of the season. Who Do you think's gonna win the super like how I wanna know how you guys, even if you were into Donald Trump, cause the guy, he's a fascinating fucking problem in a debate cause it's like this guy is just like, his style is so fucking not what there you all of these fucking politicians, unless they hosted a reality show, maybe that's his strength. He didn't take the bait in classes so he doesn't know that you just fucking goes in, you know? I Dunno. I found it as a standup comedian. Fascinating.

Speaker 6:          00:13:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:58       Mikey was this heckler that you just couldn't get. I can't shut them. Like I just, when I looked at all those other candidates, they would like these comedians and they were facing this Hackler.

Speaker 6:          00:14:09       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:14:09       that was just funny oven then the comic on stage or just wouldn't shut up and there was no security. They couldn't shut them the fuck up.

Speaker 6:          00:14:19       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:20       The only other time I saw something like that, I saw bill O'Reilly when he went on the view and he just said whatever the fuck he wanted and he made them so mad. Two of them got up and left and he was literally two fucking hosts away from hosting the I O'Reilly factor on the fucking view, you know? But Babs was fucking old school. Okay. And she called the ladies back in. She's like, what are we doing here? Sit the fuck back down. You know, it's just a man in a shirt saying things relax. Okay. And they all fucking relaxed and then that was it. Um, anyways, I love when they walked out too. Like that meant something like I'm getting up and walking out like all of show business was going to, was going to stop. You know,

Speaker 4:          00:15:10       I dunno.

Speaker 1:          00:15:12       I don't know what the fuck's been going on with me lately, but this is maybe my thought, like if I've learned anything in my 50 years on this planet is nobody gives a shit.

Speaker 4:          00:15:22       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:15:22       Occasionally when somebody gives a shit, they, they, it's, it's so fucking rare that they actually will do like a piece about it on the news. Like we found somebody that gives a shit. We found somebody who doing the right thing, this is what they do and they're doing it the right way. Why is my voice cracking? You know, where they make a documentary about somebody. There's so few people doing good things. I feel that they actually, that's why they created the documentary. So it came about, it's like, why don't we just make a movie about this person? Well, now that there's such a good person, like it's not going to come off as a believable movie. You literally have to fucking film this guy or this woman doing this nice shit. So anybody believes it,

Speaker 4:          00:16:13       right?

Speaker 1:          00:16:15       Ah, am I dreaming this podcast right now? Is this podcast actually happening? I have no idea. I watched a little bit of the Bruins and a little bit of the Celtics. I've decided that, uh, at some point I do have to put my foot down a little bit and take a little bit of control of the TV. You know, my daughter's just so adorable. It's hard for me

Speaker 1:          00:16:36       to a, you know, say no, but I know I have to write. So, you know, last night the Bruins were playing the Black Hawks, so it's just like, I just want to watch one period of hockey. I'll watch third period of hockey, you know, so I got to put the TV on and I really try not to, you know, do the screen time thing with my kid. Uh, I, I, I believe in that whole thing that having them, especially with smartphones and all that shit, it's just, it's fucking, I don't think it's good for him initially. Uh, and I'm basing that on shit. I've overheard other people say, um, not to mention last weekend when the TV wasn't on and I didn't have my phone and I just took out a deck of cards and I just had a great fucking time, I was like, Oh yeah, remember that? Looking at another person and connecting with them.

Speaker 4:          00:17:33       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:17:35       Anyways, I, uh, the fuck is my point here. Oh yeah. So I got to put on the hockey game and the second the TV goes on, she starts yelling out her shows, you know, made me mouse Minnie. Right. I'm like, no, no many miles. She went to bed many miles, went to bed, then she does this crying.

Speaker 7:          00:17:58       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:17:59       You know, just forcing it out. And I'm like, we're going to watch hockey. Yeah. Be thinks she sees now that sports, she goes, football, football. I'm like, no, hockey, hockey. So Chico was upset for a little bit, but then, then she was cool. And then, uh, tonight I put on the Celtics and then she pointed the TB. She's like, hockey, hockey. I'm like, no basketball. So then she, you know, said basketball, we watch sat a little bit, but then she wanted to do the alphabet. So I put it on mute and I was doing the alphabet with her and then she was kind of looking at the TV. So I said, fuck it. And I shut it off. And it just did the whole, you know, a apple B bad. See cupcake d, dinosaur raw. I forget what he is, you know, and I go through the whole fucking thing. Um, anyways. Um, so now I'm sitting here. It's Wednesday night. I'm doing this fucking podcast cause tomorrow is Valentine's Day. And uh, I have to somehow stay awake. It fucking go out and go do my spot tonight. Roma God damn hour. All I gotta do is just get behind the wheel of the car and that'll wake me up. I'll stick my head out the window like fucking ace Ventura pet detective.

Speaker 1:          00:19:23       I'm run down to this little fucking hole in the wall. I'm gonna run my fucking set and then that'll be it. I'll be good. But with, the thing is, is I've been getting up, I've been going to the fucking gym again in the morning. All right. And I slowly, I'm to the point where my shoulder is strong enough where I'm almost to the point I could do a dip after this rotator cuff fucking nightmare is finally I, I, I did, I did it so fucking wrong. I kept babying my shoulder still. I had that frozen shoulders shit. Right now I've had to go all the way back and I just keep having setbacks. But what I finally learned is when I go on the road and I can't go to the gym when I come back,

Speaker 6:          00:20:05       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:20:06       I can't pick up where I left, left off and I can't even just go five pounds down. I have to go 15 pounds down or this thing flares up against. So I finally figured that out. So now I'm to the point where I take the dip, the dip bar, he can adjust it all the way down. So on. Basically my feet are on the floor and I'm just sort of bending my legs doing the dipping motion. So now I've got it to the point where I'm just sort of, you know when Michael Jackson would come up on his toes, I'm kind of like that. So I'm supporting most of the weight of my legs, but more and more the upper body is going to support it. I got to tell you the day I fucking do a dip then. I know I'm getting close and I've been doing, I disguise, sent me an about some shoulder exercises and I've been doing this thing where I just sort of hang from the chin up bar, you know, with my feet on the ground.

Speaker 1:          00:20:55       But every day I do a little more of the upper body holding the weight, you know, incrementally ever so fucking slowly. And then I think eventually, um, the person I'm working with is telling me because of my body weight, I need to basically be able to do the lat pull down machine like 120 pounds, three reps of 15. And when I do that, then I can attempt to do a pull up without fucking up my rotator cuff and starting all over again. It's been a long, slow fucking road for an old bastard like myself. Um, but anyways, I am very excited about slash apprehensive about doing this. Uh, this special coming up. I just, I fucking, this is the part that I hate is having to be disciplined because like tonight I would just go down, I've just fucking go off and I have to go down and actually work and I'm a lazy fucker so I don't, I don't like working and being a big God damn baby about it. But I'm going to go down, I'm going to fucking get it done. And then next week everybody, uh, is the Patrice O'neil comedy benefits. So I'm going to be in New York City doing that benefit. The next night. Wednesday I'm actually going to be doing nine o'clock show at Caroline's on Broadway. I've not headlined there and probably a decade. And that is the, the first place that headline to me in New York City, they used to have to pull the curtain and I would draw like 30 or 40 fucking people, anybody that could drag off of Times Square.

Speaker 4:          00:22:28       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:22:30       And that's when me, Patrice Norton,

Speaker 4:          00:22:33       mmm.

Speaker 1:          00:22:35       Everyone from my graduating class was just starting to like close out a show on a

Speaker 1:          00:22:44       unlike a Tuesday night or whatever. Man, it's a really cool thing. So it kind of takes me back to all of all of those times. So, um, uh, and then I think I'm in New York for the rest of the week, so I'll be bouncing around doing spots all around the city, just stay in shap. And then I go out from New York, I'm going straight over to Great Britain, and then I just bang out about five or six shows there. And then I do, uh, I do two nights at Royal Albert Hall on the fourth and the fifth, and I knock this fucker out. And after that, oh, all this fucking crazy political talk and all this negative shit that I've been doing right now, it's just because I'm under the pressure. Don't even fucking listen to me. Okay. The world is not as bad as I'm fucking saying it is. I just, you know, I just got to get on the other side of this fucking thing. And once I do, then I'm good finish. Right. And the rest to f is for family and then the rest of my year is just opened up. And then it's my favorite favorite fucking time, right after a special, you have no fucking act. And I get to go on stage and just fucking bomb. It's my favorite thing in the fucking world. And then also be like, I don't have to put out another special for a couple of years. This is beautiful.

Speaker 1:          00:24:09       Oh, gives a shit. If I'm doing a fucking Ronald Reagan impression. Oh, I did the ice house the other night. I had a fucking last night. Ran The hour out there. What are the fuck I did. Um, had a great time out there.

Speaker 6:          00:24:31       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:24:31       You know, worked with Bart. Nick fucking Joe to Rosa J K to braid it. Can't pray them. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:24:40       trying out some new shit. I always have to try out the new shit. I can't just like do my fucking act. I swear to God. Then I feel like I'm doing my God damn taxes. Um, so anyways, so you know what, let's look up some fucking headline, right? And quit listening to me talking about me. I got to start having more guests on this fucking show. I think I've exhausted everything. I can fucking talk about about myself here. All right, here we go. Oh, look at that. I'm looking at UK openers. This is, uh, Ian So-and-so. This is a fucking something, something, something. All right, Google, Google news. All right, let's see what's going on here. Oh, by the way, you know something?

Uh, the fuck is it that, that God damn chicken nae acorn falls on his head. He says, the sky's falling. He runs around and gets everybody off. You know, got all in a fucking panic original chicken little story.

Speaker 6:          00:25:49       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:25:50       And I got to type in Fox. Okay. The original chicken little was a story called Henny penny.

Speaker 1:          00:26:01       All right? Now chicken little, I don't even know how that fucking story ended, but it didn't end up with anybody fucking dying. But in Henny penny chicken, little has an acorn falls on his fucking head and, and uh, whatever. Yeah, Henny penny. Any penny had a fucking blah, blah, blah. And then he runs into ducky Faqih and he said, yeah, the sky's falling. And then Ducky funky in Henny penny went up to and went to fucking Loosey Goosey. And then they, the sky's falling. And then Lucy Goosey, fucky Douggie and Henny penny. That's how they do it, right? It's every fucking bird you could possibly, God damn eat freaking out that the fucking sky has fallen. And then they run into a fox,

Speaker 1:          00:26:45       the Fox like, hey man, what do you guys all freaking out about it? Any Penny Ducky Faqih and, uh, the, the fucking Loosey Goosey. I'll go other. The Sky's falling. Jesus Christ. And he goes, Oh, you know what? I live in a cave. Come on over here and we'll fucking be safe. And then the story just ends with the Fox in his little fucking Fox cubs, whatever you call them, with big smiles on their faces, cause they fucking hate him. That's how it ended. That was the original. And, uh, people were saying that it was too, um, you know, to fucking dark or whatever the fuck it was. But, uh, you know, so I have a theory about those old original or some of the old stories like, or Disney shit like Bambi and why the parents die and all that shit. You know why that is? Why it was so fucking dark back then. Cause people fucking died.

Speaker 1:          00:27:45       People were hungry. He had to go out and kill an animal. You didn't just go down to fucking, you know, Goddamn Ralph's and get a chicken breasts. You had to kill that fucking thing. Watch it, flap it's wings for the last time. Take out the end trails, be covered in blood and all of that shit. It was a fucking gory mess. People got tuberculosis, they got fucking, uh, they got a polio. All kinds of horrible shit happened back then. They had gross on their goddamn faces. It was fucking difficult. So that was probably a cute story.

Speaker 1:          00:28:20       Do you know, cause they knew so much about wildlife back then, like, yeah, you know, the Fox, the Fox is fucking smart man. You know, I have no idea. I don't know.

All my God, somebody said, are they selfish apps? A fuckin lutely are alcoholic. Selfish. Here we go. Let's, let's read this trashy, a deeper look at wa into why alcoholics are so selfish. It's a disease man. Um, all right. Many people seem to think that addicts and alcoholics are quite selfish, especially when they're using, oh, did they? Do they fucking get me here? That they're not going to say they're selfish? Chances are if you had a loved one who was in an active, active addiction, we've, we'd like to invite all active addicts to board next, please. Then you've experienced the selfishness of an addict firsthand. MMM, no, I'm talking about just like even when they're dry.

Speaker 4:          00:33:27       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:33:28       We'll, we'll all recovering alcoholics become less selfish, unfortunately. No. Oh, I love this site. Not all recovering alcoholics will be willing to address their selfishness. In reality, there will be some super selfish people, including narcissists that we'll continue to being self. Well, I mean, they could say that about anybody, right? I'm just being a dick. Are Alcoholics

Speaker 1:          00:33:51       weak? This is actually fun searches to just search shit that's alcoholics are not powerless. Human weakness behind alcoholism. Uh, it's not a good one. Let's, let's one last search here and then I gotta wrap this up. Are Most fem and this fem, I can't even spell it. Feminists dumb. It's not feminist to pour bleach on man spreaders. It's just stupid. Whoa. Jesus. Were they doing that? Why anti-feminism is a logical, evil and incredibly unsexy. Well, I want to be sexy. I thought being a feminist meant I couldn't wear lipstick or crave men with small behinds. I thought that, oh my God. Can you imagine actually clicking on that? Why the fuck would I read that? Uh, why did, why what teen did to her teacher? What team did when her teacher said not to be a feminist, to people? Just make these stories up. The results of this may surprise you. All right? It's not feminist to pour bleach on man's spiders is just stupid.

Speaker 4:          00:35:08       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:35:09       I had no idea that that bothered women's so much to just sit there. It's like we got dick and balls. We have stuff hanging off of us. You know, you've got to make some room there. Um, it's an all tucked away, all nice and fucking tidy. Like your shit. I'm all right. Feminist and does not deserve to be undermined by idiotic acts that set men against women. Oh my God. God bless this woman now. He is a nice rational fucking person he could talk to. This is my new video manifesto dedicated to the problem of man's spreading, the disgusting act that is being fought with around the world and it is hushed up in us.

Speaker 5:          00:35:50       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:35:50       Men demonstrating their alpha manhood in the subway with women and children around it has nothing to do with that, which is sitting there. You built the whole backstory. Like you're sitting there, look at my dick and balls. I will take up as much space as I want with my privates. Um, if you quickly show what kind of macho you are, we will publicly cool you off. This video manifesto was created in the assistant with friends who share my position. I guess this is, I guess it's a video of a woman.

Speaker 5:          00:36:31       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:36:31       Pouring bleach on guys. All right. Anyways, did you hear the one about the Russian student who was so fed up with man spreading that she took to the subways of Saint Petersburg to sprayed the alluded bleach on men's crutches? Hilarious. Right? I got to admit, that's fucking funny. And this woman says wrong. Look, I hate man spreading as much as the next unreasonable feminists. It's antisocial. It's rude. It's displays an arrogant disregard for this people sitting around you. It's behavior that women just wouldn't get away with. What are they talking about? You use the fucking men's room.

Speaker 5:          00:37:12       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37:13       The line is too long in the ladies from you use the mat. You have no respect for our personal space. These fucking women, they're out of their fucking minds. I'm not saying they don't have some legitimate bitches, but the way they're acting like they're not doing anything wrong. It's just fucking, anyway, so let's, let's, let's read a little more.

Speaker 5:          00:37:31       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37:32       And to be clear, I don't mean that I'm advocating for men sitting with their legs clamp together, lady. I don't give a fuck what you're, what you're acting like you're, you're, you're

Speaker 5:          00:37:44       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37:45       You, you're like, you've got some sort of legal legislation here that just got passed and then I have to adhere to this anyways. I don't eat, I don't either, unless I'm wearing a short skirt. Nor am I insisting that men should cross their legs at all times. Oh, thank you. Thank you for that. And that existing, that the existence of their penis is no barrier to doing this. Some may say crossing the, some men say crossing the legs is fine. Some men say it isn't not having a penis myself, I don't feel the position to be the final arbitrator on this pressing matter. Uh, this is not a, this is one of the, this is just like, you know, global warming. Who gives a fuck about that? Corporations dictating our foreign policy. Who gives a about this men trying to sit comfortably on the subway. Um, anyways, I think that's the end of the pot. Just this was a very weird podcast, but you know what it did? It got me to within two hours of when I have to go on, I got to late in that spot tonight. [inaudible] I'm an old man.

Uh, I got Jason Reitman who I was lucky enough to work with on the front runner. And, um, that movie is coming on to all the streaming services. I believe maybe today it came on or, or sometime soon. So Jason was nice enough to agree. I asked them, come on the podcast so he could come on and promote that movie. Um, it's one of my favorite things that I've done. So we're going to talk that, we're going to talk movies, he's going to be, I think directing the next ghostbuster movie and all that type of stuff. So that's

Speaker 9:          00:44:32       what I'm going to have for you on Monday. And, um, other than that, we've got a little bit of music here and uh, after that we'll have another half hour of a throwback Thursday afternoon, just before Friday, Monday morning podcasts. God bless all of you, especially all the strong brave women who listened to this. Um, without you, the world would be nothing. Okay. And I'm

Speaker 3:          00:44:54       closing my legs as I fucking hit stop on my recorder.

Speaker 10:         00:45:27       Six days.

Speaker 9:          00:45:35       You know, I was bitching about Valentine's Day. You know, I always tease you about, you know, how we go out to celebrate our relationship. Yeah. Except I pay by the way. How, how much fun was it going out on the [inaudible]?

Speaker 11:         00:45:44       It was really nice. It was great. Yeah. Doing that from now on. Right. It was still going to be our nice, quiet, romantic. Yup. There was none of the hype. We went to a really nice place. Not going to lie. It wasn't actually cheap, but I can't imagine what that would've caught. We would've been standing outside. Oh yeah. You know, you and your little glitter dress looking at the other girls in there. Glitter dress is going to you like my glitter tries as much as her, I should have gotten mine in poofy shoe shoe colors. Um, so anyways, so I've been bitching about the ladies on this thing, right? Like what do you guys do? And they're talking about this stake in a blow job day. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. All right. I like it.

Speaker 11:         00:46:28       I'll tell you when you were in heaven, when not only can they not, can't say it. Yeah. When they're, when they're proficient in both of those categories because there's a lot of people out there, they're going to say, all right, steak in a blow job day and one of them is it going to be up to snuff? And there is, there is a prevailing attitude amongst women that they are just automatically good in bed because they're there and there's the prevailing attitude that men don't know what's going on. We don't know what's going on. Well, we already think it is. We're just happy to be here. It's a privilege, which is why this lady could says the Valentine's Day, this is, this is from a lady. She said, hey bill, I heard what you were saying about women and Valentine's Day and how we don't buy our men gifts and we expect the whole day to be about us.

Speaker 11:         00:47:14       Well, here's what I did from my husband. Uh, by the way, I'm honestly not trying to sell you anything. He goes, I, she goes, I bought him the liberator Wedge Ramp Combo set. Uh, what's that? You might ask, I actually know about this from the opiate Anthony show. They refer to it as a bedroom, as bedroom, adventure gear. It's a set of cushions designed to help you achieve more positions during sex as well as deeper penetration. So no, we didn't go out to dinner. No stupid cards were exchanged. We simply stayed home and fucked all night. So you can choke on that. You douche. I love your bill. Go Fuck Yourself. I like this girl. Yeah, but you know what's funny about that as she's patting yourself on the back, she bought something for herself. It's for both of them. No, it isn't. What do you mean it isn't she going to do with it without him?

Speaker 11:         00:48:03       I don't need deeper penetration. That's for you. That is wealthy again, that's, that's the difference. What is the difference? She know. I'm not saying that led guys don't satisfy their women properly, that they, that their dick isn't big enough. I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about how she's patting herself on the back. Like she went out and bought this guy, the NFL package for next season. Like she actually went out and bought something for him. She didn't at the very least she bought something for them. But the real thing about that, that's for the woman so he can hit it at that angle that you like so he can hit your spot so he can get in there deeper. Guys, you don't appreciate that. I'm not saying I don't appreciate it and I'm not saying it's not a great invention, but what I'm saying is she's acting as though like this was some sort of a sacrifice that she basically bought him something that would get her better Dick and she's patting herself on the back for it.

Speaker 11:         00:48:56       It's fucking ridiculous. I think it's clever. It is clever because she's acting as though she did something but she didn't see this is it. This is the thing about that is the genius of women is you guys act like sex doesn't feel good for you too. You Act like you guys allowing us to have sex with you, like you don't want it and like this is like you like waxing a floor and it's just a big fucking pain in the ass. You know, she got some in that and that is like celebrate story of their relationship as opposed to like the typical dinner. It's like it's about our intimacy. It's about our connection. So why don't we get something that will enhance that? Yeah, but this is the thing. I got to go out and buy you like some necklace or some let me go.

Speaker 11:         00:49:38       How do I get to wear it? I got to take you out to dinner. Celebrate and I pay for the whole fucking thing. It's all about the guy going out, spending money on you, getting you shit that you want, and it's the precious for the guy to show his love to you. Oh, I know a white guy who can dunk a basketball. All right, let's stop talking about the exceptions. I'm talking about the fucking rule here. All right? Okay. You know what I'm saying? Yes I do. Okay. Alright. Right there we go. This tapping out. Fucking tapping out. Why? Why? Why Do Women Act like sex doesn't feel good to them? Why do you, why do you, why do you guys, can you please talk into the microphone? I'm not like that, so I don't know. I couldn't tell you. You don't have any insight.

Speaker 11:         00:50:20       I can't keep this going. All right, let's keep going. I don't really know. Women that are like, Oh God, it's such a chore. Like maybe in next 10 years when I was making men will be complaining about that. I Dunno, but, well, when I was making fun of Valentine's Day this weekend, some girl in the crowd was going like, you know what? I said, well what did you do for it? And she goes, she, he got to hit this and yeah. Yeah. What can I just show up and be like, hey, you get to suck this lady. Never. This is you. Yeah. Never. You never get to do that, right? No, but I don't want it. Is the planning about this, what it is, if guys could ever stop being such fucking sluts and giving it a well, that's why women women don't respect Dick is because it's so easy for him to get it.

Speaker 11:         00:51:09       If you'd stop giving it away, if, if every guy would just start the day and fucking rub one out, right world would be a lot more peaceful at least until two in the afternoon. By then your balls fill up again. You start getting competitive wise, his cubicle bigger than mine. Um, I don't even know what I'm saying here. It's just, it's, you know what it is? It's just one of those things that balances it out, right? I could choke slam you on the floor and you could cut off the sex and that balances out, but it's illegal for me to hit you. But for some reason it's not illegal for you to cut off the sex. And that right there people is what's known as the tipping point. And that's how you lose.

Speaker 10:         00:51:46       Yep. Hi Barry.

Speaker 11:         00:52:12       Hey, what's going on? It is gopher and it is the Monday morning podcasts for Monday, February 14th, 2011 happy Valentine's Day.

There's every restaurant's going to be packed. You know, would you care for the heavily sheer golf for $900 he went out and my, can I just grab your fucking waiter face and just shove it in something, right.

Speaker 11:         00:54:14       Gadget, whatever. You know what I'm saying? I actually worked it out with my girl this year, said, listen, I'll take you out on the 15th all right, I'll take you to a nice fine restaurant where there'll be plenty of goddamn tables. You know, there won't be some sad fucking immigrant with flowers coming by with an accordion every five seconds, you know, she's taking the night off. We could sit there and actually enjoy the Goddamn meal for Ra, you know, only 30% markup as opposed to 200% what I'm trying to save people is, uh, if you want to find out if you're with someone who's cool, Leah, just see if they'll celebrate Valentine's Day on like the 16th or the 15th, you know, it's like Vegas go there right after the new years when new year when everybody's fucking broke. That's when you go, you get a hotel room for like seven bucks.

Speaker 11:         00:55:10       Oh yeah. I'm telling you, go on fucking orbits. You think I'm lying to you? Um, whatever. What do you, what do you get it? I just, I hate this holiday. All right.

I don't know. I don't have a problem with it. You know why? Cause there's no fucking social pressure for me to go out and get one. What kind of flagged it he gets you. Oh, you only got you that one. You know what that one means. Why don't you fucking shove it up your twat and dry it out. Why don't you do that? Oh, cheese is bill Jesus. You're going to get that dirty, this e early.

So, uh, all my, uh, my 17 fans in Great Britain and my two fans in the Scandinavian area, we'll actually get it on Monday morning. So I don't have to listen to people fucking bitching at me. Um, I just went to a,

Speaker 9:          00:57:57       a Grammy's party. Can you believe that? Happy me. Went to a Grammy's party. I lasted an hour and 20 minutes and um, I watched the first little number there, uh, where they had the, the, the five whaling whores, you know, just screech like a bunch of God damn alley cats. Like how did, how did that become singing? It's like they, they are amazing singers. All right. The uh, the black chick, it used to be the fat chick is now the skinny chick. She's out there, Waylon shaking her fucking we've around Christina Aguilera with their fucking booze face, right in her little fucking special Horry Mike stand. She's wailing away. Then they had was at that Kathy Griffin. Look and check all of them. The old Whitney Houston looking broad. They dragged out all just hitting every note that they could possibly hit every 12 fucking seconds. They sounded like a bunch of fucking alley cats. Whoa.

Speaker 12:         00:59:02       Oh,

Speaker 11:         00:59:05       shut up. Oh, Alia the fuck is wrong with you. Sing the God damn song.

Speaker 3:          00:59:14       You know,

Speaker 11:         00:59:16       you're fucking hold on to it and then you surprise people. Then you one unleash shit. Just get up there fucking screaming like someone standing on your foot that's not fucking singing all five of them. Somebody can just needed to sit them down. Oh, and then they're dead. Fucking emaciated one comes out, uh, Lady Gaga, right? You know what? I can't stand. I hate paint by numbers. Shock. I can't fucking stand it. And uh, but it's, it's a, it's a very smart career choice. She went, she was on the red carpet and she fucking was in, uh, uh, what the fuck was she in? What is a proper medical to an ovary? What the fuck was, she was in a womb. Her womb is so polluted. She was in a fucking womb, right? I mean, that is like fucking page one of stupid ass, like a stupid college student film from like 1963 that was like shocking when Jim Morrison first started shaving.

Speaker 11:         01:00:26       All right. Jesus Christ, you show up in the fucking thing. More cues to be in that's supposed to be artistic. And everybody's supposed to be, you know, and I'm a tell you fucking right now she's going to be around for 40 fucking years because people who do that shit, it's, I dunno, I dunno what's what she gonna do next year. She's going to show up next year and like an old shoe and then come out dressed in like a sock, mini skirt, you know, commenting on the shoeless people in the fucking world. And then she goes out and she sings basically a Madonna Song. I was at the party and everyone was singing Madonna song over it and it and it, and it meshed perfectly with it. Express yourself. Sounded like what she was singing and then she had all these fucking people dancing around her. Right. And then they have like that expressionless like a post apocalyptic makeup on, you know, that they owe hs was fucking horrific.

Speaker 11:         01:01:23       And at that point, you know, at this point I'm in the kitchen and I'm eating a fucking slice of cheesecake just for what? What am I eating it for? You know, why am I eating? I'm just doing that so I can avoid that other shit. It was horrific. And I had a real brutal day. I got a flat tire on my Prius. Uh, fuck. It was just for, you know, it's one of those deals where the, the front left tire was low. All right. And I see that it's low. So I go to a gas station, I go, I'm like, well that's odd. So I put air in the tire. This, this whole fucking thing was my fault, right? So I put air in the tire and then I just kind of keep an eye on it and it's went down a little bit, but not as much as it had in back of my head.

Speaker 11:         01:02:12       My brain's going like, dude, what do, what are you fucking idiot? Take it, take it over to somebody and check. You probably got a slow leak. Maybe they can patch it, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And I fucking blow it off. Start driving 70 miles an hour. Just completely ignoring the fucking thing. You know, in the back of my head the entire time I've owned the car, I'm like, you know bill, you know, okay, you know this thing has one of those piece of Shit Jacks that you have to assemble and then it has that little hand crank. Like I'm trying to start like a fucking model t in the early 19 hundreds. Right. I knew that and I knew it was going to have some half ass fucking that l shape lug nut thing that you can get like half a pound of torque on. And there's no way to get the lug nuts off cause they fucking put them on with death think and they don't, they, they don't stop after it's tight and they go, oh they fucking, there's no way to get that thing that you need.

Speaker 11:         01:03:07       I knew what I needed. I needed up. You need a big piece of pipe that you fit over that piece of shit, right angle fucking lug nut thing. And then he can, you can take them off and I didn't have it. So whatever. So I went to go do, uh, I went to go do the long shot podcasts, right? I was doing that fucking thing and I'm driving out and um, I, I just hear this noise and my car wasn't moving smoothly and I was like, do I have the emergency brake on? What the fuck's going on? Then I go, Oh God, oh Jeez. And I pull over and their am riding on the fucking rim. So I'm like, now I, and I drive a Prius so I'm already on for spare tires to begin with. Okay. God knows what the fucking temporary spare is going to look like. Um, turns out, it looks like, you know, when you used, when you suck on a fucking a lifesaver, a lifesaver, you know, and you know when you get to that point, right when you have it, just try to keep sucking on it without breaking it and you get to that point right before it breaks. That's, that's what my temporary spare looks like and the rim is painted bright yellow.

Speaker 5:          01:04:15       Okay.

Speaker 11:         01:04:16       Uh, I have a picture of it, which will be up on the m M podcast.com. Um, so anyways, anyway, she, uh, I pull into a gas station, which back in the day 12 guys would attack my car. And what had the fucking thing changed before I even stopped. But now you show up, there's no garage at a gas station anymore because that entire area is to sell fucking a whole hose and snowballs and gum. So I walk in, I say, yeah, listen, I got a flat, can you, can you call a tow truck? He goes, well, I mean I can basically do what you do. I just call information.

Speaker 11:         01:04:51       Sounds like I get it. I understand this wasn't your dream in life, wasn't okay, I'll go fuck myself. So I go back out to the hotel, a hotel, I go out to the fucking, uh, the God damn parking lot, right? And immediately, you know, homeless people start approaching me like, like, I mean a Zombie movie, you know, you can't, you don't notice if you just go to get gas at a gas station, you don't realize all the Weirdos. But when you're fucking sitting there and you have a flat and there's nowhere to go, they just didn't come out of fucking nowhere. And I'm like, why are they all these fucking homeless people at a God damn gas station? I don't, I don't fucking understand it. They don't have cars if fucking homeless. Right? Why are they are, are they at the gas station? And it turns out I finally figured it out, especially in La, which is everybody drives. There's no one to panhandle to. You need to get them when they're getting out of their fucking cars. So they hang up the god damn gas stations. These people keep showing up, you know? Hey Meg, can you give me a dollar? No, I can't go fuck yourself. All right. Because you look like a drunk, sir. You don't look like a guy who lost his job and he's down on his luck. You look like a fucking drunk. All right. Fucking loser. Get outta here. Get a job. You're a bum. You understand me? You're not homeless. You're a fucking bum. That was my attitude. And anyways, so, uh, call up, you know, I call up the tow truck, did that Shit, you know?

Speaker 6:          01:06:24       Okay.

Speaker 11:         01:06:24       Then you call them back 20 odd, 20 minutes later they, Fred that 20 minutes up at that bap bap APP, right? Fucking Deco's on 10 minutes was like an hour and a half. And I was not, I want to 15 minutes and I was just sitting there going like,

Speaker 11:         01:06:41       what did I called at like three and four, 10 past four. I was like, if this fucking Douche doesn't get here by four 15, all right, I'm calling a friend, I'm going over to a hardware store and I'm buying a piece of fucking pipe and I'm going to, I'm going to figure out my jack and I'm gonna do this myself. But fortunately, this fucking guy finally shows up with his giant Goddamn truck, which he leaves running, which is fantastic, right? So we can just sit there breathing in the fumes and uh, you know, whatever. He fucking change the type, the god damn tire and this temporary spare is so God damn small. Um,

Speaker 11:         01:07:21       I just drove home with it and I parked the car and I'm like, that's it. I'm done. I'm dry. I'm driving this car home and then I'm driving it over to the dealership tomorrow. That is it. That is how small this fucking tire is. Like the, what the fuck light was on, on my dashboard with a temporary spare. So, uh, I don't know. That's my fucking, that was my God damn day. That's what happened to me today. People don't really take me 15 minutes to tell you. I've got to fucking flat on my car. Are you really still listening to this? Are you, were you upset with me? Um, somebody sent me this article, actually the, the, uh, the person who runs the m m podcast.com, the official podcast page of the Monday morning podcast, uh, sent me this, this article here. Um, it's called the day of the lout l o u t from the Los Angeles Times, and it's written, um, bias actually by some guy, believe it or not.

Speaker 11:         01:08:20       And it says unsophisticated, lazy, misogynistic males may be the primary model for today's young American men. Uh, and I'm sitting there going, where the fuck is this guy seeing this? Because all I see is a bunch of pussy whipped fags, you know. All right. Since the way he says, if you've seen a beer commercial the last two years and how can you avoid them? Well, you could read, you could Tivo shows. See Right off the bat, this guy's a do. She's trashing men and now he has problems with beer commercials. How could you avoid them? I mean really. Um, he says, you know, the tight, he's, he's a 20 or 30 something, sort of a slacker with a beautiful and adoring girlfriend who just can't seem to prize attention away from his suds. She expresses ardor. He looks ardently at his mug or can of beer.

Speaker 11:         01:09:16       I don't know what art means. I don't even know if I'm pronouncing that correctly. She wants to talk romance. He wants to talk anything. But she gets exasperated. He snuggles obviously with his beer and she departs in a huff. Most Martin takes on manhood say that guys will do anything to bed a woman. But this is a new kind of man. And He seems to be everywhere these days, not just on beer commercials, but in movies, on TV, on hundreds of morning radio shows and in bestselling books to the point where he's generating a culture of new masculinity. He may even be the primary model for young manhood in America today. All right? This guy has clearly decided to just completely ignore how much women are fucking pandered to and how you can make a guy look like an absolute retard in any commercial. They always make the, for the most part, so many commercials make the guide look like the moron. You know, I'm not saying 100%, but can't they have a couple ones where the guy is a dick? I'm not saying in, in every, in every commercial, every TV show, the guy's got to be cool and he should act like he doesn't give a shit about his wife. But I mean,

Speaker 6:          01:10:36       yeah,

Speaker 11:         01:10:37       I dunno if I should legally be saying this, but, uh, there there's three things that recently had, fuck, can I put this, uh, show ideas, pilots that are being made out here in Hollywood. You want to hear him? Fuck it. Who gives a shit? Okay. One of them was a,

Speaker 11:         01:11:01       the idea was for a guy who's the audition was to play a guy who actually speaks his mind, but the reason why he speaks his mind is because he got hit on the head and had a fucking aneurysm and he almost died. So then they're thinking, is this some weird side effect that a man is actually speaking as mine? I swear to God, this is the TV show that they're going to put millions of dollars behind and a, and this is how he speaks his mind in the pilot. He actually, uh, I, I might get in trouble if I see what the material is. He makes a comment about how big the girls asses, you know, but of course he likes it. He likes it. Her ass is big. So it's, it's self serving to women, you know?

Speaker 11:         01:11:46       Yeah. It's basically say, yeah, it's great that now that we're married, you've become a dumpy fat. Fuck sweetheart. I'm speaking my mind. Totally pandering to the broads. Then there's another show that's in development. I guess I can talk about this. It's in fucking development. It's not a God damn secret. This isn't, this is, I swear to God, this is the premise of the show. Uh, two guys realize that it's a woman's world. So they decide to dress as women to get jobs at a pharmacy and through dressing like women, they become better men. I swear to God.

Speaker 11:         01:12:28       All right. And this is, I got all of these auditions in a week. I said no to all of these. All right? Because I would, I would become a, I would become an alcoholic. I don't give a, I don't need, I don't need that. All right. I'm already a fuck up. I can, there's no fucking way. And then the last one was a guy who is in the shadow of his spouse, uh, his, his famous spouse and get subset because he's always teased that he's the wife in the relationship. And the guy's first name is Gail could go either way, like gale sayers.

Speaker 3:          01:13:04       Uh,

Speaker 11:         01:13:06       yeah. So I don't know what the fuck this is bitching about. And there's plenty of those. There's all those beer commercials where the women are going like, yeah, well I'll tell you what's a good beer when you take your skirt off your half a fucking pussy, right? All those ones and the guys wearing the tight jeans and looking like Douche bags and having sunglasses on. So this guy just chose to look at this very small. This is like a guy, this Guy Neil. I bet he got the shit kicked out of him in high school by guys like this. I mean, what kind of a guy really gets annoyed?

Speaker 3:          01:13:36       Okay.

Speaker 11:         01:13:37       Buy Beer commercials. Really? Are they really dumb? Do they really fucking appeal to the lowest common denominator? Of course they do. You fucking moron. You want some art? Go rent a good movie. Well I think, oh, what is he like, like reminiscing back in the day when they had good beer commercials, quality beer, commercial, sweat. When they had those fucking lizards talking to each other.

Speaker 3:          01:14:02       I Dunno

Speaker 11:         01:14:04       Neal Gabler go fuck yourself. You guys, we wouldn't be trying to get laid this week so that way you had to write that. Louts. Um, so anyways, did that go anywhere? Has This podcast gone anywhere to 22 fucking minutes in Jesus? Oh, fucking Jesus. Um, what's actually, let's, let's read some things here. Yeah. Bill, that, that'll make it better if you actually start to read, you know, it was funny. It was, I sat there, it was at that, that God damn my Grammy Party and I was trashing lady Gaga knowing in the back of my head it was annoying the shit out of my girlfriend. She absolutely hates my behavior when I go to parties. She can't stand it. She thinks I'm anti social and she thinks, when I say things, I just say douchey things.

Speaker 3:          01:14:49       MMM.

Speaker 11:         01:14:51       I Dunno what it is. She, someone who kind of goes, I don't, I can't say she goes along, I don't know what the fuck it is, but like, yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:14:58       MMM.

Speaker 11:         01:15:01       She's not happy with me right now. She doesn't like that. I made fun of Lady Gaga who was evidently singing express yourself.

Speaker 3:          01:15:09       I Dunno.

Speaker 11:         01:15:12       What the fuck was I supposed to do? I walked in there. I just, I immediately didn't feel comfortable. I just, I dunno. All right, let's plow ahead here. Um, how about some advice? I haven't done one of these in a while when I give something my bed. Oh, here's a guy bitching about a two drink minimums at comedy clubs. Says a bilge. Jimmy Norton is my favorite comic. Um, he's getting ready to go on right now at the Melrose Improv. Yeah, Jim Norton played the Improv right here in Melrose, right here in Los Angeles, um, Saturday night. So his favorite comedian is Jimmy Norton. And uh, he says, I guess he's writing this as the show's about ready to happen. He says he's ready to go on right now at the Melrose improv Saturday night. Guess who's not there? Not just me, but probably 50 other assholes that love him and we could, would kill to see him.

Speaker 11:         01:16:03       I know it's not Jimmy's fault. Uh, it's not any of the performer's fault, but are any of these cock sucking club owners aware that the economy, that the economy is in the fucking toilet right now? No Sir. I'm sure they have no idea considering when the economy goes into the toilet, one of the first things people cut out his entertainment. Yeah, I'm sure they're completely immune to the economy economy. Sorry, my voice is cracking. He said I've skipped most of the handful of live type events I've wanted to see for the last six months or so because of this exorbitantly priced shit. How can these clubs justify selling the place, selling the place out with $25 tickets to see the guy then charge their two drink minimum with their $8 beers, $6 bottle waters and $10 mixed strengths. So when all is said and done, you've spent like $40 or more to see a comic who can afford that kind of shit. I don't know sir. With a paper route, you could really complaining that it costs 40 fucking dollars. Sir. This is how it works. Do you know how you have expenses in life? Club owners also have expenses. They have to pay the comedian. All right.

Speaker 6:          01:17:28       Okay.

Speaker 11:         01:17:29       They have to pay taxes. They have to pay to get a liquor license. They have to pay all of that shit and then they have to pay their mortgages and all of that type of stuff. And the reason why they have a two drink minimum is because tight fucks would go there and just order waters and they wouldn't make any money and they would go out of business. All right, now I'm not mocking you because you can't afford $40 I guess I kind of made of it, but what the fuck, sir? $40 how much does it cost to go to a football game? Cost 20 bucks to park. All right to go down and see the great Jimmy Norton for $4 $40 you're going to fucking complain about that because you got to buy a couple of $10 Shirley temples, you know, you know what your problem is, Sarah? I don't think you have your priorities straight. You don't look around your apartment, you know?

Speaker 6:          01:18:22       Okay.

Speaker 11:         01:18:23       What do you got? You had to get a George Foreman grill. How much did that cost? You know, does it really work? You know, cooks chicken and fucking eight minutes,

Speaker 11:         01:18:33       you know, how does that taste? Was that worth it? You ever see fucking George Foreman's house? She's got a key. So fucking rich. He named all his kids the same goddamn name. That's how fucking Richie is. Like he doesn't even give a fuck that that he'd do something like that. Sorry. You're way out of line complaining about that. Okay. You know what you sound like, you sound like all these kids today who go on Youtube and they get upset when a video gets taken down these fuck goddamn copyright conch looks like. They don't seem to understand that things cost money. So you have to charge for them. And when you put up hundreds of thousands of dollars to produce a film or saw a music or an album that if people just take it and they put it on fucking youtube, you don't get your money back. You know? So there you go. Sir. Believer in a, not a comedy club, it costs money.

Speaker 11:         01:19:30       So run a comedy club and not to mention sometimes they give comedians guarantees like no matter if five people show up a 500 we still have to pay you this amount of money. And then when five people show up, they lose their goddamn shirts. It's not like they're making tons of fucking money every God damn weekend. There's a lot of shit that goes into it. And uh, like I said, you know, people are tight fucks and if you didn't make them buy drinks, they would just sit there. They would booze in the parking lot and then they would just fucking sit there and the club would go out of business. So I think 40 to see a one of the top comp comics in the country, I think that's pretty God damn reasonable, eh. Uh, you know, I don't want to tell you how much it costs to go to a fucking movie. At least half that is John Travolta standing there live dancing for you. He isn't, I don't know. Might be in a dick here. Where did I lose the funny on this podcast is it's pre, cause I already did an hour long podcast for somebody else today. I think I'm all podcast it out.

Speaker 11:         01:20:39       All right, let's get to, is it racist, racist? Um, this is the new of the new fucking thing here that everybody seems to like. Uh, is it racist? Um, Bill, although I thought, uh, also, uh, thought I'd share a little game that I used to play. I like this one right here. This is a great game. You know, I play that older Asian game. Anytime anybody cuts me off in traffic, uh, somebody says a turnoff. I, this is a game I like to play. I turn on the TV and without looking, I try to guess the race of the person talking. I call it the Tony Gwynn game. Now, for those of you who aren't sports fans, Tony Gwynn is African American and he sounds like a def jam comic imitating a White Guy. If you closed your eyes, you wouldn't even think that you were listening to a white guy. You would think you were listening to a black guy imitating a white guy. He, he, he talks like he basically like, yeah, I was talking to Ted Williams the other day and he's really big on headache. Dad. Uh, I'm, I'm not, I can't even do it. I'm not even doing it. Well not even doing it justice.

Speaker 6:          01:21:46       Okay.

Speaker 11:         01:21:47       And I asked him how to hit the Ed side out curve ball. Um, the Tony Gwynn game. Yeah. Cause he is the wildcard. Do you guys think it's racist? Like I remember back in the day when the Oj trial when uh, someone said they heard some yelling and it sounded like a black guy and people tried to say that that was racist and it's like that is not fucking racist. You know what I mean? If you heard somebody on the other side of a fence going, ah, that's a petty smart. Right. Would you be like, that's, I think that that guy could be Italian. Sorry for my Hacky fucking Asian offensive, uh, accent there. But you know what I mean? Like if you were to listen to me, not only would you know I was a guest that I was a white guy, you would guess that I was from the east coast one. Yeah. Just cause you can guess who to fuck somebody is, doesn't mean it's racist. That's like so much. Somebody who send me an email said, bill, he goes, you're, you're older. Asian game is racist as shit. I'm sorry that that was the person's entire fucking email.

Speaker 11:         01:22:57       It's like would call, can you, can you elaborate a little bit so you can enlighten me? Your game is racist

Speaker 6:          01:23:06       as shit. Oh, well, you know, thanks for clearing that up. I don't know what you're apologizing for. I hate when people say, I hate that. That's like that fucking, uh, you know, you know, I listened to your act. I didn't like it. You know, I'm sorry I, but I didn't like, why are you apologizing? I hate like that whole, like, you're assuming that you fucking hurt my feelings. I don't give a fuck if you think my game is racist or not. I know. What is it? I don't, I don't have any bad feelings towards old people or Asians. I'm just addressing the fact that most of the time out here when somebody does something fucked up, you know? Is it racist to say white people can't dance because we can't.

Speaker 11:         01:23:54       There are examples. John Travolta. I believe I already brought up that man can dance, but it's not racist if some, if somebody black told me said, you know what? White people cannot fucking dance. You guys don't have any fucking rhythm. I when I sit there and that's not racist, I'm sorry, but it isn't. Um, you know, that's something I actually, that hasn't been brought up in this whole is it or is it racist, racist, um, topic that I'm doing here is, uh, I think that before you fly off the fucking handle and get offended, you have to at least, you know, not all the time, but 10% of the time, don't you feel that you kind of have to own up to the fact

Speaker 6:          01:24:41       that,

Speaker 11:         01:24:43       ah, how do I put this? It's like when Arabs got upset after nine 11 when they were, they were getting searched for no fucking reason other than the fact that they were Arab. And that's definitely offensive is definitely fucking annoying. And, and all of that type of shit. But on some level, don't you feel you have a responsibility to address the 18 Arabs that fucked it up for you. You know,

Speaker 11:         01:25:11       it's like that white people can't fucking dance. All right? Are they can't jump or whatever. I made, what am I supposed to do? You know how offended he is at some point you've got your kind of gotta like I is one for you. Let me read, let me read this shit here. Um, not raise my computer, goes out a bill. I can't really use names, but I have a friend who was a Lineman for a division one football school. He has a friend who plays in the NFL as a wide receiver. He, the, the wide receiver is also white. Um, my friend the Lyman told me that the wide receiver told him that he's tried out for four NFL teams. Two of the four told him his chances of making the team were not good because he was white. I've had a few arguments with people. Uh, is it racist? Should the NFL should at the NFL teams even mentioned the fact that he has less of a, because he's white. Well, no they shouldn't because eventually someone's going to sue over that. But that comes to that point I was making were you also got to understand where the stereotype came from, all those slow fucking white guys, you know,

Speaker 11:         01:26:20       I mean, one of the reasons why I think Dan Marino never won a Superbowl was because of fucking the Blackledge brothers. He had two white corn evacs you can't win a fucking Superbowl with two of them. Maybe one. But I don't think he could win. He could win with too. Right. Am I nuts? I remember, uh, the, the, the comic strip in a, in a New York City. I went down there, I auditioned in 1990. I went and asked to audition and the guy running the club told me I already have enough white guys and I knew a lot of comedians who got upset like that going through. That's fucked up. He would never say our, I already have enough black guys and soak. Well, first of all, there's only like an eight black guys working here. So he wouldn't say that. And uh, I understood what he meant. I knew what he meant. He meant you better have a fucking point of view because I have enough fucking suburban white guys that can go on and for 20 minutes be like, you know,

Speaker 13:         01:27:23       soup with Bill Clinton, you know, and table. I mean, which I knew I put it on once, you know, crime is and stuff is all in the papers.

Speaker 11:         01:27:37       Like he had enough people doing, I totally understood what he was saying. He just kind of cut through the fat. I got enough fucking white comics go in there and do something different. All right. I have no use for you. I understood that. And the only people who fucking complain, we're lame ass white comedians. So what am I saying here? Am I justify? I didn't want him fucking saying, I feel like I'm justifying it here. I'm not, I'm not justifying it, but I also, I'm just saying you got to tone down the sensitivity here a little bit. You know?

Speaker 11:         01:28:05       Right. Older Asian is not racist as shit. There's an element of fucking truth to it and there's no hatred in my heart when I do it. I just do it for the laugh. I don't drive around screaming about Asian, an old people saying we need to get him out of the fucking country. I've had it up to here with their goddamn driving. They're ruining this country. They need these old people need to go back to what from where they came from. Um, isn't another one. Uh, so anyways, build tonight I was watching a TV show and I saw a commercial for the Crisp for Chris Rock's Broadway show a, they never said the show's name and simply referred to it as the title, you can't say. And on the screen, the second word of the title was black was blackened out and it read the blank with the hat. I immediately thought the n word with the hat. I was also interested in seeing the show. So I promptly googled it with no results. I then went to Chris Rock's only to find the title to the show was the motherfucker with the hat. I proceeded to laugh and then thought of you and your bid. Is it racist? Racist. So, uh, was that racist bill?

Speaker 6:          01:29:13       Okay.

Speaker 11:         01:29:14       I was on the edge, but generally thought it was funny. We'd love to hear your thoughts and your girlfriends too. Well, a knee is not here right now. She's mad because of my behavior at the grammys at the Grammy Party. Uh, do I think it's racist? No, that's what I would've guessed. You know, such, it's such a big deal is made out of that word. The title. You can't say Chris always does edgy stuff. That's what I would have gone with.

Speaker 6:          01:29:40       Okay.

Speaker 11:         01:29:40       You know, I'm surprised you can't say the motherfucker with the hat at this point. I watched 60 minutes tonight and Andy Rooney said, God damn. And they didn't bleep it out. So do I think it's racist? No, I think I don't. A lot of people would think it was just because you thought the, the n word fit in there. But I, I maintain this. Maybe I'm fucking wrong. You guys can email me, but I, I really think it comes what's in your heart when you, when you, when you're thinking that,

Speaker 11:         01:30:14       I mean, you were just thinking all the word. You can't say the title, you can't say it's always saying, you know, the n word white people can't say. You can't say that. You know? So I, I, no, I don't think that that's racist and I have the, and I, and I would have laughed too when I've read that. That was actually the motherfucker with the hat. So, no, no, I don't. All right, here we go. Uh, Hey Ben, here's another one. Hey Bill. Huge fan of up. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Uh, anyways, I have, I have, uh, uh, is, is it racist question at my job, I work with the guy who's not really Mexican, but his father is what, what, so what does that mean? Because he's not 100% Mexican because he's had, that would make him half Mexican.

Speaker 6:          01:31:03       Okay.

Speaker 11:         01:31:04       You know, what are you saying? He's like a light beer in the Mexican version of that. Um, so anyways, he's, he's not really Mexican, but his father is, uh, he's from Arizona, but he looks the type,

Speaker 11:         01:31:18       I don't get any of that. So he's half Mexican, but he looks full on Mexican is that's what, is that what you're saying? I don't think this one's going to end good. I'm going to go on out on a limb here. Uh, were okay friends, but he can be a huge dick sometimes that occasionally I say something that could be considered racist, like shut up. Beaner uh, but this one time he was working really hard and I just walked by and said, you people always, you people always working hard for little wage and he was being a huge Dick that day. Um, before I said that and he just laughed and we moved on. My question is, is it racist to say those type of things if the guys, if the guy's being a complete jack off and deep down you feel,

Speaker 11:         01:32:05       you feel like it shows them they're being a dick. Ah, yes. I do think that's racist. I think if you just said Shit like that as the joke and you guys were friends and you were fucking around, it isn't, but because of the way you're using it, like when he's being a Dick, you feel like it, it shows them that they're being a dick by saying something racist to him. Yeah. You're kind of taking it out of the, uh, the joke in arena and I'm going to teach this guy a lesson and put him in his place. So, uh, and plus also your, your fucking kind of naive statements of he's not really Mexican, but his father is, but he looks the part. Yeah. Yeah. I'd say I'd be in a, you know, in a bar with you and probably, I don't know, about 20 minutes. Then you'd say something that I would be like, you know? Yeah. I could get, what did you say? Could you say that? Could you repeat that? You know, trying to, with the jukebox noise in the background. Yeah. But you ever had that in a fucking bar, you just hanging out. It happens to me all the time on the fucking road. Back when I was boozing, I'd be out there and I would just be a, I'll tell you one of the weirdest ones I ever had. I did this bit on, uh,

Speaker 3:          01:33:18       okay.

Speaker 11:         01:33:18       Uh, Jamie Foxx laugh a Palooza thing. Um, Jamie Fox, by the way, who plays my shit all the time on his channel, on uh, on Sirius Xm, the foxhole. I've had more goddamn people come up to me saying, I heard you on the Fox hole. I thought you were funny. That's why I came up to my, uh, out to your show. So thank you to everyone over there. Um, but anyways, so I did this bit and it was a story that happened to me when I was at, when I was in Nashville, Tennessee. I was, uh, I was drinking in the bar by myself. God, that sounds like such a great fucking idea. 120 days. Then people, oh, does that sound like a good idea? Drinking by myself. I got damn bar at a couple of fucking, um, I'm in Nashville, Tennessee and Tarell Owens, this is like, I don't know how many fucking years ago, but he was doing what he always does. Starts off good with the team, then it becomes a total fucking cunt. So I said, I said, something's effective. Can you believe this fucking guy? How much goddamn money do you need to make before you're not a dick? Like, what the fuck is wrong with this guy?

Speaker 3:          01:34:26       And uh,

Speaker 11:         01:34:29       Oh God, it's been so long since I remember this I the guy, I'll tell you what the fucking problem is because the guy's a fucking end. He just dropped the n word

Speaker 3:          01:34:38       and

Speaker 11:         01:34:40       out of fucking note. And I immediately was just like,

Speaker 3:          01:34:43       okay.

Speaker 11:         01:34:44       I immediately though, how was it? I immediately looked around, I was like, Oh fuck, I'm going to get fucking some black dude is going to punch this guy in the face through my head, cause I'm standing next to him like, I'm going to get fucking, they're gonna think I'm with this guy. So that, that was, that's right. This has been a long time since I told the joke. That was the joke. So the joke was basically he dropped the fucking inward. Uh, that's right. He didn't say what the Aa, he said what the R and he didn't pull up on the yard. He fucking stuck the landing. That's how the joke went. And I felt like I just wished it was somewhere I could just act like they show was some something that I could have done in that moment to immediately say like, I didn't know this fucking guy. You know, I had no idea everything was normal. We would talking football and out of nowhere he starts with this clan rally bullshit. So, uh,

Speaker 6:          01:35:32       okay.

Speaker 11:         01:35:32       And I remember too, like I didn't roll with what he said and I forget what I said, but he clearly knew

Speaker 6:          01:35:40       okay

Speaker 11:         01:35:41       that I was annoyed by him and then he tried to fix it real quick and try to say like, I'm not saying they're all like that. There are some good ones. And then it was fuck, it was like a fucking sick home. And then five seconds later, some black dude comes walking in, right. And then he's like, oh, hey, how you doing? He's trying to be over friendly to the guy in some way to make up for the fact that he dropped the n word to me.

Speaker 6:          01:36:06       Yeah.

Speaker 11:         01:36:07       And the, and the whole fucking thing was phony. And then I felt like he was dragging me into it and I wanted to say to the guy at that point like, hey, why don't you tell that guy some of the shit you were just saying to me five seconds ago, you know, all that classic shit. When you think of all the funny stuff you should've said the moment, you know, 20 minutes fucking later. Um, so anyway, so I basically, I turned that into a bit and I did it on the laugh, a Palooza thing. So like three years later, I'm in North Carolina working in this club. And uh, afterwards I'm standing there and I'm talking to this dude who is like the most stereotypical redneck guy ever. You know, just talking lock the edge, but they or be like if, if like if someone from the north did that accent on TV would be considered like offensive. That's all. Like how fucking hardcore this guy was. You know, you know, I was on my tractor the other day and I was listening to one of my pigs got out it, how's labs are you stop? I'm barely catch him. I mean like telling me stories like that. Right. But then he starts talking about my comedy.

Speaker 6:          01:37:15       Okay.

Speaker 11:         01:37:16       And he was really breaking it down and just talking about like in a really intelligent way was breaking the thing down. I was sticking in my head like this is why I love doing the road because you meet all these fucking people, you have all these preconceived notions. I'm a fucking looking at this guy. Like this guy's a God damn hillbilly and here he is breaking down comedy and my act in particular

Speaker 11:         01:37:38       like borderline on the level that a comedian could. So I was like on, this is why I love doing the road. This is why, this is what makes you worldly. This is how you know it makes you, you, you stop thinking ignorant shit, you know, which is hilarious. All the ignorance, should I say on my pocket, whatever makes you less ignorant. So right as I'm having that feel good moment thinking about this dude, I forget what the fuck, what the fuck happened. But then out of nowhere he, he said he was telling a story. Oh. And he actually alluded to the tea actually brought up the joke that I, the story that I told about being in Nashville and then the guy dropping the n word and he knew why it was funny and he broke that whole joke down. He had this really redneck Yat accent and I was like, look at that. See you. They're not all fucking racist right then. I don't know where he starts telling some fucking story, trying to make me laugh. And He, and then his punchline, he'd gotten himself into some sort of predicament. And then his punchline was, I was more nervous than an end war than Mike Tice. No, I was more nervous than an n word in a, in a, uh, in a spelling bee or something. He dropped the fucking inward and I remember going

Speaker 6:          01:38:50       okay.

Speaker 11:         01:38:51       And I just said out loud to myself with the fucking music was so loud. I was just, I was just like, and then that happened. So I said to the guy, I got, dude, you just broke down that fucking joke where I talked about somebody doing that and then five minutes later you do it. And he says, Hell Yeah, I love that joke. Like he still didn't get it and I th three times I fucking went in trying to explain to him what the fuck just at, why would you do that? And uh, just never fucking dawned on him. And then I, I just, uh, he was talking to me and I just walked off like mid sentence as he [inaudible] fabric fear and I just fucking walked away. Uh, uh, uh, what else? Then I went to the other side of the bar and I remember there was these four chicks were dancing on the bar doing the coyote ugly thing. And one of them was a fat chick who was not sexy but was dancing in a very sexy way. And I remember being annoyed at her. I was really fucking annoyed that she had the confidence to do that. I was like, why? You're horrific. You should be off the bar doing sit ups. You should feel shame and you don't.

Speaker 6:          01:40:09       Yeah.

Speaker 11:         01:40:10       And I dunno. Normally that would have made me laugh I guess, but maybe cause what the fuck happened? Dove, I just remember being really annoyed. Uh, I don't fucking know. Do you know I went on, I had such a fucked up week. I don't even know what that fat chick just reminded me of something I went to. I went on a couple's date to a cheesecake factory. Um,

Speaker 11:         01:40:31       and in defense they said, look, we don't have to go there, but you know, they got kids and shit. They just picks something quick and you people know how I feel about the cheesecake factory. But I was like, you know, I don't give a fuck. It's better than Apple Bee's. I'll go over there. It's, you know the talking about going in an hour. So I go over there and I just want to tell you guys something just in case, just in case you don't know the cheese cake factory fucking sucks. All right? It's, that is horrible food. Horrific, horrible fucking food. And the reason why I'm saying this is because every time I fucking walked by one of them, it is jam packed with people. Line out the fucking door. Everybody holding those little vibrating things waiting to get called to go into to to a fucking table, which is exactly what happened to us. And I went in there, I ordered the Colby Beef Burger. I went as high up on the menu as I could and I still felt like I fucking ate a part of my God damn dresser just sitting in my fucking stomach like a Goddamn old boot. Horrible fucking food. Can you people please stop going to that restaurant?

Speaker 11:         01:41:43       Sorry. He was telling me tonight they don't even advertise on TV. They don't have to people just line. They just think it's fucking good. Like Lady Gaga coming in and that fucking egg from the morgue show. You know what's going to kill me is when people just going to talk about like how outrageous that was. You know, who thinks like that type of shit is outrageous. People who fan themselves with their hands when they begin to cry. If you ever seen people like that, when they start getting emotional, they fan their face. What the fuck I'm talking about anymore? Let's get the youtube videos. At this point. I'm really in a fucking grumpy ass mood. I had a bad burger this weekend. I had a fucking flat tire.

Speaker 3:          01:42:32       Okay,

Speaker 11:         01:42:32       got it. God Damn yellow spare goddamn breath mint for a fucking temporary spare. This is just a miserable fucking podcast and I was in a good mood too. All right, you two videos of the week. Uh, NFL trick shot, white quarterback, uh, check this. These are all on the Mlm, podcast.com. By the way, I'm this fucking kid's amazing. You know, I know a lot of them, you know? Okay. How many attempts did he make to make the fucking throw? But there's a couple where he does like to three um, tricks all in one take. Very impressive. But at the end of the video, oh, okay. Let me fucking hiccups at the end of the video. Candy Brita Defense. Here's another one. This kid, uh, just uh, if you want to see just a great fucking story teller. Um, I don't even know if this is the name of the video, but this is Baltimore storyteller. The fuck this guy tells a story about, uh, oh his dad sent him to the corner store,

Speaker 3:          01:43:32       okay.

Speaker 11:         01:43:32       For some bread and he has to get by some gang bangers in this fucking guy. I watched like three of his videos. It's just phenomenal. Just a phenomenal fucking storyteller. I love telling stories and I nothing more like then listen to a great storytellers. This kid's great. So check that out and check out all those other videos. A midget wrestler flying. All right? If you ever wanted to see a midget in a, uh, dressed up like a baby gorilla, get kicked by a fat bald guy, I believe the guy's bald. And then go flying ass over tea kettle in land on another wrestler. This is the video for you and a funny drum video. I love this video because the guy's fucking hilarious. Uh, English seems to be his third language. I put that on the high hat that they high had that one, the one tote tray.

Speaker 11:         01:44:21       Okay. And uh, and no one told Trey. Okay, that's literally, this is how this guy fucking gives the the drum lesson. But then he proceeds to play this fucking sick drum groove, which I still can't fucking play. Um, so the guys like awesome. It's just a pharmacist like a second or third language. Um, oh, and if you want to see another great wrestling, just horrific. The WCW dungeon of doom, full segment. I don't know who wrote this shit. Um, but it is horrific in a phenomenal fucking way. Uh, what else do I got in here? Oh, here's some advice. Somebody wants a bill. My girlfriend looks like a centerfold. Good for you. She's blind. She has a beautiful face, a tiny waist in giant cans. I have outdone myself. Well, what the fuck, man? Don't you sell yourself short? Maybe you're, maybe you're a, you're a stud.

Speaker 11:         01:45:18       So he says, however, having a girlfriend of such caliber as you might imagine, comes with its share of problems. Ooh, Jesus. Here we go. Like, uh, like your good self. I battle my battle, keeping my temper under control at times and particularly struggle when my girlfriend and I go out in public together. In short, the amount of male attention she gets is ridiculous. And at times it's infuriating. Have you ever found you found yourself out with a girl and notice that every man within a three mile radius from the sweaty 22 year old walking boner to the porky, sexually frustrated father of three is blatantly staring at her tits in her ass. Um, I've always been of the opinion that if a girl is obviously with a guy, whether you know him or not, it's a gentleman's code not to have a staring contest with there with her, with her a ring piece. I don't know what that means. What's that looking at her pussy. I have no idea. This guys from Australia. Um, if a girl is alone or with girlfriend, sure. Objectify the shit out of her. But I think if a girl is holding hands with their boyfriend and you make it obvious that your helmet is pressing against the inside of your front Zipper, then you're a cunt. Um, nothing serious has happened yet, but the weather is getting warmer.

Speaker 11:         01:46:40       The outfits are getting smaller and I'm concerned I'm going to wind up with, I'm going to wind up with some perverts blood and quite possibly come on my hands all for now. Um, all right. All right. This is a tricky situation, sir. You know, is a very tricky situation. You know, there's a price you pay for everything. All right? You're the one who has his centerfold fucking girlfriend with a great ass and Nice set of fucking tits and a, you just, you just have to this, this, this is, this is how I look at this shit.

Speaker 11:         01:47:21       As long as you're, a woman isn't going around trying to get attention if she's just fucking standing there and she's so goddamn stunning that men are looking at her, but you know, she's not, Ooh, I dropped my lipstick and then slowly bending over at the waist while looking over her shoulder. Um, if she's doing that, I can tell you right now a banger another couple of times and then fucking dumper because she's going to be an absolute fucking nightmare and a, and you don't need that in your life. Okay. But if she's just a stunningly gorgeous woman, um, you, that kind of comes with it. And, uh, if you lose your fucking temper and you start acting like a maniac, that's a great way to eventually annoy the shit out of her. And because she can't help it. Like I said, if she's not trying to get attention, she can't help it, that she's gorgeous. And, uh, if you then, it's in this weird way, you're giving her shit for being herself, which is not fun for anybody and then you're going to have a problem. So.

Speaker 6:          01:48:29       Okay.

Speaker 11:         01:48:30       Um, I don't know how to, if you know what it's like, it's like a, it's like when I whore myself out at the end of my shows and I sell DVDs. All right? I don't have to do that, but I choose to do it and I'm standing. It was a choice I fucking made. And then I stand there and what's going to happen? I answered this. Yeah. This is one of these podcast questions. All right. Eventually somebody is going to come up and they're going to fucking insult me. He's telling me they didn't like my act. Tell me. Uh, they didn't think I was as funny as when they saw me on TV and I can't get mad because it's my fucking fault for standing there like an asshole. Just, you know, I, I put myself on the dunking store and I got to admit, sir, if, if you're, if this, if your girl is the way that you describe her, you just have to accept that it's, it's par for the course and uh, just give yourself a little halftime speech before you go up. You know, I'm not going to lose my shit. Um, but

Speaker 11:         01:49:26       if it is overt, uh, there has to be a way that you can fucking address it without pissing her off, without, you know, you also don't want to get into a fucking fight. Um, I dunno. Just say, hey buddy can, can you eliminate it to like, you know, five second shifts of staring at her tea. I can't say tits.

Speaker 4:          01:49:49       Okay.

Speaker 11:         01:49:49       Uh, I don't know what you do. Do that. That's a rough one. That's a rough run. They, man, that takes me back to being Jesus Christ. I was like 21 years old. I went on this, I went out on a date with this girl who was well out of my fucking league just because I didn't have the confidence to fucking be with her, you know what I mean?

Speaker 4:          01:50:09       MMM.

Speaker 11:         01:50:11       Beautiful Girl. And I went out with her and I noticed he just kept looking around the restaurant to see who was looking at her. And I remembered it annoyed the shit out of me, but I, I, I didn't have any experience with beautiful women, so I just sort of accepted it. And, um, but I never went out with her again. It just, it drove it. I saw, I tapped out somewhere through the fucking dinner. Even back then, I was an angry son of a bitch. I was like, let me get this straight. I'm buying you fucking dinner and you're looking around to see who's Elsa staring at your tits. Um, yeah, you're a cunt. Good looking cunt. But uh, nonetheless, someday those looks are going to be gone and I'm just going to be left with the cunt. You know who's going to be a psycho cunt because you're an attention whore and when the attention goes away, you're going to be like some celebrity who fell off the fucking math.

Speaker 11:         01:50:59       Fuck this bitch. Fuck this. You know? And that was the end of that shit that is podcast is fucking horrific. Jeez, I don't even get going, man. You know what it is. I had a flat tire today and I think that that's, that's been, that's a good symbol. Uh, this whole podcast, I've just been riding on the rim Af. Fuck. I got to start my day tomorrow down at the God damn dealership. It was fucking Douche bags. They've got everything. It's all wrapped up. You know, if you do anything to you, God damn car. If I go down to the God damn auto zone and I get new wiper blades, I think that, I think that cancels out my warranty. He's fucking cunts. Um, so anyways, this was the lane podcast for this week. I know it had its moments. Who's getting no, it started off wealth when I was talking about those whaling horse. Um, I actually had a nice little show biz moment. A friend of mine got me tickets to,

Speaker 4:          01:51:54       uh, um,

Speaker 11:         01:51:57       the roots do this pre grammy jam where they're just the house band and like fucking, I dunno, 20 or 30 of the most legendary insane acts ever. Just come on stage and start singing songs with them and doing fucking whatever. And somebody got me a ticket, uh, you know, hanging out, you know, somehow I got in there and uh, it was fucking unbelievable. I think I came home that night and I downloaded like probably about $70 worth of music, just the, the level of talent that was that there. And I'm an old guy now, so I don't know who the fuck, I don't know who the fuck. And if Neil was telling me who everybody was, she was freaking the fuck out. Oh my God, that's fucking Mc. So, and I have no, I don't know who the fuck they are. You know what I tapped when they stopped showing videos on MTV? I kind of liked that last wave. Jay Z, m. And. M. Mmm. Was there any rock like by then it was all that emo shit, so I couldn't relate to any of that. Yeah. What does that fucking Goddamn wining song about not giving up?

Speaker 2:          01:53:10       Woo.

Speaker 9:          01:53:18       They actually play that at sporting events.

Speaker 11:         01:53:22       It sounds like a man crying. I don't know. I know he's saying we will be victorious, but like just, it just, it could have been a better line read,

Speaker 9:          01:53:31       you know,

Speaker 11:         01:53:33       all that shit. That's when I tapped out all that. My Chemical Romance. Uh, could I have another Kleenex please? Whatever the fucking name is. Other bands where I just, uh,

Speaker 9:          01:53:45       I don't know. Everybody just sounded like they were crying. I couldn't handle it. You sex is on fire. That guy fucking crying through all his songs. How does that fucking song go?

Speaker 11:         01:54:12       Rami. The Cure. That's how the guy in the cure used to sing.

Speaker 2:          01:54:17       Oh, always love you. Um,

Speaker 11:         01:54:24       yeah, I'm not into that ship. I'm sorry. Was that, that was that annoying? Was that as annoying as it just sounded in my fucking is what? The music is fucking annoying. So I didn't know who anybody was,

Speaker 9:          01:54:33       but uh,

Speaker 11:         01:54:35       you know, it was amazing. It was booker t came out. What didn't even from booker t and the mgs, I didn't even know the fucking dude was still alive and it was such like a Paris Hilton. Oh my God, am my God. That's hot kind of fucking crowd.

Speaker 6:          01:54:48       Okay.

Speaker 11:         01:54:48       That, uh, that they had no fucking idea who the guy was.

Speaker 9:          01:54:53       Oh,

Speaker 11:         01:54:54       my favorite performer of the night was a chuck Brown, came out and sang, busted loose, and he was the shit. He came out on a leather and on leather fucking outfit with the fucking pimp hat. He sang the shit out of the song with the roots in the background.

Speaker 9:          01:55:11       Okay.

Speaker 11:         01:55:11       And the roots of fucking unbelievable. And it for guitarists out there, everybody knows quest is to shit.

Speaker 11:         01:55:18       But as underrated, Kirk Douglas Diff fucking guitarist.

Speaker 9:          01:55:22       Okay.

Speaker 11:         01:55:23       That dude is fucking insane.

Speaker 9:          01:55:33       Okay.

Speaker 11:         01:55:33       And a fortunate, we were sitting close enough that I was just awesome. Like, you know me, I'm like a fucking geek for that shit. Like I wish I could be if I didn't do this. I wish I could be a, so I like, I think like anybody, you can do that stuff as I've trashed half the people on the grammys, you know what I'm saying? But like musicians, people playing instruments, I'm absolutely fucking blown away by him. And just being close enough to watch somebody take a solo and just, you could just see just going off the top of, they just feeling it and just doing it and coming out of it. And then just fucking looking back at the drummer like, all right, let's, let's go back into this next part of it. And everybody seamlessly goes into it. You know, anybody's ever played like a fucking garage band, you know, and, and just, you know, had the courage to make a tape and you hear how fucking awful you are.

Speaker 11:         01:56:24       They actually hear live music and they played for like three fucking hours. I ended up leaving. I was so god damn old. Like I'm at the age now where if I stand up too long, my back hurts. Like my lower fucking back, my feet hurt. It's, it's fucking, it's terrible. I've got to come home and sit in a Goddamn Tba Epson salt. But anyways, uh, I downloaded a bunch of Chuck Brown Shit, a couple other rappers. I download it. I don't have my iTunes open right now. I don't even, I don't know who the fuck they were. Uh, but it's kind of funny rappers now, they have that odd thing where they, they're wearing skinny tight jeans, which I never thought would come back into style again yet. They're still hanging off their fucking ass, which drives me up the Goddamn wall. Fuck. Pull 'em up. Um, anyways, that's the podcast for this week.

I forgot to talk about the Bruins Canadians game to just see that with all the old school fighting in the goal scoring was like fucking 27 to 26, I think was the final score with all the fighting.

Speaker 11:         02:00:13       And I want to know Montreal Canadians. What the fuck happened? He had team, I'm not giving you shit about losing a game was only one fucking game. But I mean, you guys always had a tough guy all the way back to fucking John Cordic, Chris Nilan, George low, rocky had, that guy was the toughest guy in the league. Why did you guys, all you had was, you know, I know the Bruins kicked the shit out of you guys, but I'm not an idiot. We, we, we, we beat up a bunch of gold scores. I felt bad for that last guy. Jesus Christ. He took like 20 upper cuts to the face and somehow ended up with two giant paper cuts. Um, Google it, man. Maybe I'll, I'll have that youtube video also on the [inaudible] podcast.com. Uh, but I'm telling you right now, if you're a fan of fighting and hockey watched the game on March 8th when the Bruins and the Canadians play again, because I'm a tell you right now, the Canadians are not going to sit back and take that fucking physical ass kicking that they took.

You know, whatever has a lower beyond thunder bay is what I'm guessing what they're going to bring up.

I'm thinking they're going to bring up a couple of those guys and it's going to be, it's going to be fucking insane. I hope it is. I hope it doesn't fucking, not live up to the hype. Um, all right. That's it. I'm done. Okay. I've had a long fucking, all right. And I apologize to anybody out there who aspires to be a whaling whore at the grammys.
