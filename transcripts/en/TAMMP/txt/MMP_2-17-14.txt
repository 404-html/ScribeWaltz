Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's the Monday morning podcasts for Monday, February 17th, 2014. How's it going? How are you? Are you enjoying this podcast so far? I'll tell you if you're listening to it on Monday, Monday the 17th, I am actually a man the fuck. And that's why the podcast is out. Um, as you guys like to think early or on time, I should say, it's early in my world. All right. It's early. Um, yeah, I'm on my way back to, uh, back to the east coast to do a wonderful run of shows starting Tuesday night with the second annual Patrice. So comedy benefit, all money after the expenses. Of course, we do have to rent the place out after we paid back for renting out the fucking bar. Yeah. All monies goes to basically all the people that, uh, were in Patricia's life that he was supporting, you know, his mom, his wife, and on, you know, stepdaughter and all that stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:01:07       So it's a wonderful thing. Um, if you didn't get tickets, uh, we're going to do it again next year. We're going to do it every year. And I know a lot of people like, well, why does she have a fucking donation button online? Because I'm learning about this shit. I'm learning. Okay. Eventually every year it'll get bigger. Maybe we can do two shows one year. I don't know. Okay. I'm new to the benefit thing. I hope I don't have to do. And another benefit for anybody else that I know in love. All right, so there you go. That's the, those are your, those are the answers to your questions. And I know that a bunch of people are gonna try to be helpful and it show me how to set something up through a, you know, I'm trying to raise money for my buddies, you know, loved ones.com or whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:01:51       I'm not going to be able to figure it out. All right. I am. I am anti technology unless it is trying to save people's lives or the lives of animals, nature. I don't mind that stuff. But as far as all these fucking apps, you can stick them on a ball, turned them up sideways and shove straight up Y'all candy. And no, sorry. Had a rush of wrestling. Fucking flashback. Dude. I just was trying to check in for my flight. That's all I was doing. Just an old freckled fuck on the computer. All I want to do is check in. All I want to do is Roma Zoom. Zoom. I didn't want to do is find what airline I'm flying. It's all, when does it leave? Oh yes. That when it leaves. While I'll be sure to be there before it takes off. All right, so what do I get? I get some fucking email from these goddamn cunts and I can't access by itinerary unless I sign up for their APP. Tripcase, these mother fuckers just emailed me back.

Speaker 2:          00:03:02       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:03       You're almost there. Verify your email with TripCase. Go Fuck Yourself.

Speaker 2:          00:03:09       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:03:09       dude, so I can basically, I can't view when my plane takes off or lance because now I have to download of fucking app to say, you know, Eastern Airlines leaves your flight leaves at fucking 11 in the morning and arrives at 7:00 PM why do I need an application for that? Can somebody from this new world of fat children where you don't go outside and you play your video games and you sext one another in the fucking six grade. Can one of you now not, not at all. Let's get out of that fucking world. Could somebody of age fucking tell me why in God's name I would need this app. I don't like the fucking word APP. Download our APP. Do you have our APP? I literally, I have to just, just to find out when my fucking plane takes off. I had to fucking download this thing. They wanted my, they wanted me to sign in with my email and my password. So now the console over there have the fucking password to my email. Like I, I'm, I don't, I don't understand that. What do I need a password? How do I know everybody at TripCase is, is, is on the fucking level.

Speaker 1:          00:04:33       You don't, if you're not trying to figure out how to grow a kidney and a dish like a k and you're not out there trying to fucking prolong the life of a Walrus, you know, I guess I'm guilty of it too. What do I do? What do I do to hurt the environment? What just what do I do? I take 40,000 flights a year. I'm back to using Pam instead of putting in the skillets, you know, goes my wife wore me down. Does Day why you just don't use Pam?

Speaker 2:          00:05:09       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:05:09       fuck that bitch. You fucking up the ozone layer. You know, I try to be like that. That does it. That doesn't work. That doesn't work. When you live with somebody, you know, at some point you just gotta be like, alright, you know, I'm sure there'll be plenty of ozone left for my life as we sit here in the middle of this heat wave. Um, anyways.

Speaker 2:          00:05:34       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:05:35       So I had to just bug somebody who's in the middle of our weekend to tell her, can you just copy and paste what airline I'm on, where I'm going and when can you do that so and I don't have to go to TripCase and download their fucking app?

Speaker 2:          00:05:51       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:05:51       Jesus [inaudible] is it really the fault of the people at TripCase? Hey, God bless him. You know what? They could've gone and fucking work for somebody else, but no, they all sat together and they sold their skateboards and they and they, and they made this company. God dammit, they're trying to make their money. What else are they supposed to do? We don't make anything else in this country. All right? We basically, we plant and grow weed and we create apps. That's what we do in this country and in the middle of it we eat a lot of bugles. Okay. This is from what? The people outside of America. All right. If you haven't been here. And other than that, we make great music and great movies that you guys all then go and rip off you bunch of fucking hacks. Jesus Christ. Has there been any fucking original programming that didn't come out of America? I mean, it's absolutely ridiculous. I mean, the failed attempt of Ricky Gervais' and those guys who did the original office, like they did know that we had the followup in development. Come on England, you're better than that. You fucking better than that. You went from an empire to that ripping off our shows that we haven't put out yet. But you know we're putting them out. Fuck you with your cup of tea. Who's this? Oh, he hit that new stupid fucking ring.

Speaker 1:          00:07:09       Right? Like I'm on an island, but I'm not.

Speaker 1:          00:07:13       Oh, shut up. How do you get it to stop? I had to download the new fucking whatever cause my phone stopped working. The latest. Well, it's like the fucking iPhone. We're fine. It's unbelievable. I stand on a fucking mountain. I can talk to somebody that hadn't froze to death yet. Why do I need it to be better? Why does it have to be made? I don't want to, I don't want to update anything else anymore. Okay. I'm done updating. I'm done with apps. I'm done with all of this fucking shit. Like I said, unless it literally is affecting my ability to live a healthy fucking life. I don't give a fuck about your APP. You brushed your teeth. Have you downloaded our APP? It'll really show you how to get in between your teeth. Really, the fucking dentist can't tell me that. You know what, what, what, what are you supposed to do? All the factories left back in the day. You'd be in some auto auto worker place, making a fucking fan. Jesus. Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop. Oh, hello, Mr [inaudible], welcome to your cell phone. All right, let's just shut this off. You know what I like about it? And it's actually weirdly upbeat, which I think goes along with my fucking, you know, balances out my country behavior. Um, speaking of the dentist,

Speaker 1:          00:08:43       I went to the dentist this week Boto Dodo do it and I sat in the chair, but the blue boop, boop, boop mother fucker. Gabe. Um, I laid down in the chair, whatever, shut the fuck a chair and I got what's known as a deep cleaning, you know, like six months ago or whenever July was. What's that? Eight come on egg heads. How do you look at the calendar? I'm sure it's in some beautiful mind way. [inaudible] 72 days. Like, um, actually it wouldn't be, that's over a year. Three or 64 days in a year. Really. All right. Anyways. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:09:25       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:09:25       Yeah. So I was supposed to get this, I don't know. I got my teeth cleaned, I don't know about a year ago this time. And then I went back to the dentist over the fucking don't, when are you putting your fucking boat in the water? Come over there with a pack of fucking cause light toad. Scrape it off the fucking bod I coast. Um, and I guess I'm on my last trip to fucking the dentist.

Speaker 2:          00:09:55       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:09:56       To fucking the dentist. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:10:00       I agreed to get this deep cleaning, deep cleaning, Ron Jeremy Stars in deep clean it. I, um, I agreed to have this fucking thing done and uh, you know, I don't listen to people. All right. I don't, I look, I'm sort of looking at you and I'm nodding. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sounds good. Sounds good. Just stop talking. Leave me. I want to get out of here. So I come back in July and rather than the lady who cleans my teeth, there's some dude sitting there with this smock on and he goes, all right, do you want us to numb you up a, we've got a numb you up is what he said. And I went, Whoa, whoa. What are we? I thought it was just, he had to get a cleaning. We get pulling teeth out. He goes, no. You said last time that you wanted to come in for a deep cleaning.

Speaker 1:          00:10:50       Right. And I was just like, all right, well look, how long is this going to take? You said like 90 minutes. I'm like, I don't have time for that shit. I thought this was going to be like 45. I said, I didn't say shit, but I said, listen, I, you know, I have other stuff to do. I have drums to play. I might go play hockey, I might go fly a kite because I am a 45 year old child. I have things that I have to get to. So they go out, right. Whoa, cool man. We know we're not trying to hassle you man. Just reschedule. And I said, you got it, you got it, doctor smoky smoke and I'll see you later. That tootsie lady and I walked out and I've been trying to get back to do it and I just, you know, I traveled all over the place.

Speaker 1:          00:11:36       I got married. All this fucking shit happens. So now, now I finally go in for the thing. I go when I say, all right, let's do this. So I go, okay, so you've got to know me up. And he said, well, it's option. I go, what do you mean it's optional? Well, some people know they get numbed up, other people don't. I'm taking basically a drill he thing and I'm going in between your teeth and it can kind of irritate your gums and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And I said, well, do I need to get numbed up? And he said, well, personally I don't do it. So I say, I will fuck it. Let's, let's see how it feels. Let's see how it feels. Right. So I gotta tell you this, unless you have like, you know, your teeth are sensitive to cold. Do you have like a little bit of a nerve involvement? Um, I'll give you a pass on that, but people get numbed up for that. You know what? I'm going to try and to talk shit here, but cheer a bunch of pussies. Was it irritating? Yes. Was it something I would like to be feeling every day, every moment of the waking day now, but was a screaming bloody murder and not at all. It was fine, you know, it was great when I walked out. I didn't, my face wasn't Numb,

Speaker 3:          00:12:51       you know?

Speaker 1:          00:12:54       I like that bill Cosby bit. I would cry. Ain't getting habit. Can Be, Hey, I saw bill Cosby this week. I saw him, he was walking right down the street. Now I saw him a out in that, the Pasadena Civic Center play House, whatever they called it. And uh, it was unbelievable. The lovely Nia took me there for Valentine's Day. Took me out. Um, first of all, that's the first time I've been out on Valentine's Day in years because knee is cool as shit. And I just said, listen to stupid. It's just stupid to go out on this night. You guys know the steel. Maybe there's somebody knew somebody from OCI. Uh, not, oh, she come thinking about who scored all the goals there. What the fuck? Ah, Christ they can't Sochi

Speaker 1:          00:13:41       somebody in Sochi. Right? Hey, how about a fucking round of applause for Bob Costas? You know, toughen it out. Jesus Christ, putting the glasses on every day that, that, that infection got worse in his eye. Then it jumped to his other ride. They just kept pulling the camera back, started up with a, they had like a fucking three quarter shot by the end of it. He was like on the other side of the studio, they will pull back so far. And finally just said, I was literally by the last night I saw him, I was just like, dude, he should just go home. Just fucking get it. Say Fuck it. You know, I've, I what, you're not going to call me for the next Olympics. Matt Lauer is going to come in here and kill it so hard that you're not going to hire Bob fucking costus. I've been around since the Aba. Go Fuck Yourself.

Speaker 1:          00:14:30       I'll see you guys in two years. And then he finally left. I think he left good for him, good for him, but he toughed it out, man. He toughed it out. So anyways, um, so I'm on my way to a over to Pasadena, which is where a doctor Cosby show. My respect to you was performing and a dude, I got a suit and tie on everything. It's, it's obvious because it's Valentine's Day, three reasons, Valentine's Day, I'm seeing, you know, out of respect for Nia. And then also, you know, I'm seeing Cosby. And then lastly, I buy these fucking suits and I never wear, I wear them once, put a gun to my head and I do five minutes on a talk show. Hope I don't fall off the stage, you know, which is the only way anybody's going to see you're set on a fucking talk show. Now if you do stand up, if you kill nobody sees it. If you fall off the stage, you get dick falls out of your pants, it's going to get 100 million hits. So anyways, I have all these, these suits from my numerous TV appearances. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:15:35       and uh, I'm like, I got to wear these motherfuckers. So I was driving over there and uh, I could not believe the traffic and I can't believe, oh, I don't believe, I don't believe the couples put themselves through that shit. Why would you do that? Don't do that to yourselves. Okay. There's a couple of fire and I know you got what you guys are saying. You only bill, you fucking say this every week, but fuck you. I saw the traffic out there. Obviously nobody's listening to me. What you guys can, I'll tell it this way because you guys already know this shit can, can you tell other people?

Speaker 4:          00:16:13       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:16:13       I would, you know if I can accomplish anything in my life. If I could just sabotage that fucking holiday, this guy to be like, I was just going to say the anti holidays, Valentine's Day, then that becomes a fucking crowded mess. Okay. There's a number of gatherings that you do not have to participate in and you can immediately without making a dollar more an hour increase the quality of your life. All right? You don't need to go to super bowl parties. I already told you how to get through that. Now Valentine's Day, you don't have to fucking go out already told you how to do that. Saint Patrick's Day. Stupid fucking stupid. Go out on the 16th going out on the 16th I know you think of, what about the 18th well, everybody's yakked in the bar and no matter how much chlorhexidine the use, you still smelling that stomach acid. Okay, sorry ladies who are listening to this. You go out on the 16th all right. Unless the 16th is a Friday night cause then they, everybody's going to be drinking all weekend. Whatever you do. If that's the case, go out on the Wednesday. As you know, I was fucking dumb. They don't even have Saint Patrick's day in Ireland.

Speaker 1:          00:17:33       They don't even know who the guy is. They don't even wear green in Ireland. You think everybody's over there with an Irish sweater on, cutting into some soap after they jumped off a horse to let you know how to wash your fucking taint. They're not. They're going to work over there dressed like coach on cheers and they're going into their fucking cubicles. All right. And they put in their hands and their keyboards and between their knees they got themselves a flask. All right. And that's how you celebrate Saint Patrick's Day. Um, anyway, so I'm on my fucking soapbox this week. Let me, uh, let me, uh, I'll read a little bit of advertising media and uh, and then, then I'll, and I'll keep, I'll tell you the bill Cosby story. Oh, by the way, no more a nature's box on this podcast. Evidently there are a bunch of babies. They took the little snacks and they were of course, their babies. They give out snacks.

Speaker 1:          00:18:26       So I will not be saying the name of their company anymore from here on out. They will just be known by their new nickname, the tree twats. Alright.

There's a bunch of fucking animals out there. And I'm like, I don't want to try to find the parking garage. I don't know where it is. And then they, I see valet and I like, oh, valet, fuck it.

Speaker 1:          00:22:43       Fuck it. I'm going to valet a Prius isn't, you know, a 2008 Prius with a bird shit stain, the likes of which I haven't seen since owning the car, right on the windshield. I'm pulling up and I'm valet in it. And right as I pulled up, I started thinking, well, this is like a 3000 seater. What if half the crowd does this? How long am I going to be waiting? And I was just like, oh fuck it. My feet hurt. I'm valet. So I valet, I walk into the theater and uh, you know, tickets work. I asked for an no duels, they don't have any, so I get a fucking water and I get some wine for my wife, right? So we go into the theater, beautiful theatre, lovely theater made in the 1930s. Right? And we go in there and uh, first thing I do is look at the stage and it's the coolest thing ever.

Speaker 1:          00:23:32       It's like there's this little apartment up there, full bill Cosby. He has like a little four by four rug. Oriental rug. All right. No offense to the Orient. And uh, he has a chair and then next duty has a little like nightstand little table with this little, I don't know what little cooler that has all his drinks in it. And then he has his little headset thing. It's the coolest thing ever. And I'm, so we're sitting there, it's supposed to start at eight o'clock and right at eight on the nose, no opening act, no intro. He just walks out on stage. I was actually looking down, I don't know what the hell I was doing and the only reason I knew he was had walked out on stage is because the crowd started cheering. And of course everybody stood up and all that type of stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:24:25       And he went over and he put on his little, uh, his little headset thing that's like seethrough like John Bonham's vista light kit. And a, so you don't even notice it. He puts that thing on and then it's like he's sitting right next to you and the guy and literally is, sits down and kills for two and a half hours, two and a half hour. He's 76 years old, 77 this year. Two and a half hours, absolutely destroys his first like bit, took a half hour just talking about Valentine's Day and how you got all the pressure to get, you know, uh, you know, the, the, the woman's something and all you get is a card starts with that premise and then just goes, I don't know where he went. 30 minutes later he brings it back to that, to a thunderous applause break. And I looked over at my wife and I go, that's his first joke, half hour. So he did two and a half hours. So I guess that's like what he did. Five jokes.

Speaker 4:          00:25:32       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:25:32       It was, uh, it was amazing. And, uh, what I, I don't know, I never seen him live like, just do a full set and get to sit in the crowd. And it was um, an unbelievable honor. It was the best Valentine's gift day gift I've ever gotten and she's, she always gives me something nice and, but that was the best. And um, it's definitely a bucket list thing. And just to be able to sit there in the crowd and watch and do his thing is I've tried to do what he's done for 22 years to have that perspective, to have the perspective as a, as a, as a fan and an audience member. Like it was working on like five different levels. It was, it was awesome. And uh, then I walked out and I ran into like three other comics. They know that I knew and were all geeking out. He's two and a half hours. Can you fucking believe that I've done, I've done two and a half hours my life guys, 76. It was awesome. And then I walked out there and there must have been 900 people waiting for their valid cars.

Speaker 1:          00:26:36       So I just stood there by the theater with a couple other comics and we just around just giving each other shit and talking about the business and all that. And then just kept going back to how amazing bill Cosby was. So if you get a chance, it's really cool. He's also, you know, he just put out that special, so he's, he's working on some new material. So I got to see that. I got to see bill Cosby workshopping material and you know, you know, and you see which ones that are already monster bits and then you see the other ones that are on their way. It was, I got the hiccups now. It was, it was, it was amazing. So, um, you know, definitely if there's very few masters out there that you can go watch them live, creating live, I highly recommend going out and, and uh, and seeing a bill Cosby manor was awesome.

Speaker 1:          00:27:26       It was awesome. And I got to wear a suit, you know, so it was a fucking two for, um, all right. Oh, this is something I have to mention. Hey everybody, do you like buying shit off my website? Well, I got some new stuff. Um, I did a uh, a tour at the end of last year right before my European tour. Um, oh I did that. Run a dates where I played the beacon in New York City. I played constitution hall in DC and then I played tower theater three absolutely legendary venues. I still can't believe I got to perform there. So as always thank you to everybody who came out. Um, I have a limited amount of posters leftover from that tour and they will be going on sale I believe. Like on Wednesday of this week, there's like 300 left. Um, it's first come first serve. The posters are 20 inches tall and 16 inches wide.

Speaker 1:          00:28:21       They will arrive in a shipping tube and reading on this stuff and you know what I am and, and in the effort to get these things out of my house and to give you guys more incentive, I autographed each one of them. I sat at my kitchen table and painstakingly autographed 300 posters. It must've taken me at least 17 minutes. My wrist is still sore. I live a very difficult life as an artist, whatever. I have posters, autographed posters. If you want them, they make a great gift, that 20 bucks plus shipping, it's going to be autographed. You know? And if you go to give it to somebody and they don't like it, you got the empty tube to smash over their head when you're done. And then you pick up the poster and you get it framed yourself, not because you like me, just because it will always remind you of hitting that person over the head.

Speaker 1:          00:29:14       You know you, you know what's great about the, the, the poster tube is you get the release, like you fucking smashed a bat over somebody's head without having to get rid of a body afterwards cause it's just cardboard. You know, if I ran a prison, I would allow everybody to have a poster tube. It'd be like enough with the shanks people. All right. Just hit each other with cardboard. If you break it, don't worry. We'll make some more down the office. All everybody relax. We'll get you some pot cookies, you know, get you some porno. Everybody can rub one out at the beginning of the day. That way nobody gets raped in the showers. Okay. This, this is, this is a new kind of prison. All right? She's everybody just fucking relax. All right. Lucky you might, you're not getting out. So I don't know why you want to sit here fighting with each other and we all get together and we will write some songs now.

Speaker 1:          00:30:12       Eh, well, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's a it up. It's what we'll work on it. Enjoy your, enjoy your tubes. They took it too far with the Sif. I did. Um, anyways. All right, let's, let's get, let's get on with the, uh, the podcast here. So, um, I've been watching, I've been missing all the Olympic hockey because it's coming on at four 30 in the morning and because I haven't been drinking, I've been falling asleep like the middle aged man that I have. Like I'm falling asleep every night, like nine 30, 10 o'clock. And I wake up at like six in the morning where I could at least watch the third period I guess, or the end of the third period. But it never dawns on me cause they just woke up, you know, this is what I have to do before I get out of bed.

Speaker 1:          00:30:59       Um, and if you feed a fucked up, um, you know, I fucked up my foot too. I got that planner, Fisher writers and my bass drum for trying to get, trying to play good times, bad times. My technique. I had poor technique and I don't know how to, does anybody know how to Rehab that? Cause every time I run or do anything that exerts pushing off with that foot, it comes right back. But I'm able to kind of, you know, roll a tennis ball letter and my foot and I'm fine. But like when I get up in the morning, if I don't want to have problems, this is what I do. All right. I wake up, I look at the ceiling. All right. I look over my wife and I'm like, good. She didn't leave me. All right, the dog hears me stirring in immediately. I hear her, I hear her stretching because she makes, she makes this noise.

Speaker 1:          00:31:46       She goes, then she stretches again. And then I hear her, her dog licenses shaking as she fucking shakes her head for whatever God damn reason. Um, and all of that happens is I'm looking at the ceiling and before I take step number one, if you have a fucked up your, your whatever that is there underneath your foot, that tendon, if you ever fucked it up, what really fucks you over? It's that first step in the morning. All right. I learned this from another comedian who was a world champion. And this is basically what you do before you get out of it. This is what I have to do. And I've never played organized sports and this is just, and I, and I stretch and I still, you get to a certain fucking age. Like I, I literally throw out my back sleeping. I wake up like what did I do? Was a lifting shit. What sleepwalking? Um,

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       I basically, I point my toes at my knees. He tried to do that paint point toes towards your knees. I'm doing it right now and you'll hold it there for a good 10 22nd cow, right? One Mississippi, two Mississippi, but you say it in your head so you don't wake up your significant other. Then you point your toes down at the the end of the bed for another 10 20 seconds. He'd do that right now. You stretched the bottom, you fought and you stretch. It tends on the top of your foot and then clockwise or counterclockwise. I know a lot of young people like Jesus Christ. What the fuck? Well, I got news for you. This day is coming in your life. All right? It's called your late thirties early forties all right. Then what you do is then you have your bring your feet to normal position, standard side by side, like those fucking jerk offs at guard. That thing over there in London, and then you either go clockwise or counterclockwise. You just make big, slow circles and then you go the other way a couple of times. Then I get out of bed and I gingerly walk, no pun intended. I know I'm a red head and I eye twinkle toe my way over to the bathroom and I just make noise on that. Jesus Christ. I curse and stuff as I'm walking over there. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:33:55       Yeah, and then that's it. Then that's it and then I have to go through the, the beginning I got a stretch. This is just so I can walk my dog down the fucking street and not be in traction. I'll just pathetic. It really makes me sad that I used to wake up. I remember as a little kid you just woke up,

Speaker 1:          00:34:17       you woke up and one of the other siblings or was like, Hey, you want to go outside and fucking believe it. Yeah, you just jumped out of bed and just ran down the stairs. Waffles. That fucking scenario. You just shoved the shit you need to. You just ran out the fucking door. You never stretched ever. You never throw out your back. You're jumping over shit, fucking play, fight and get in a real fight. You are fine. You are brand new right off the assembly line. Brand fucking new. Then after a while, I don't give a shit. No matter how much fucking juices you drink, I don't know what happens to the attendance. They just fucking, they shrink up after awhile. Um, all right. I don't mean to depress you guys. Um, you know, my latest obsession is when it comes to cars, like learning, learning about cars and that type of shit is a, I am absolutely fascinated with differentials.

Speaker 1:          00:35:11       I didn't know there was oil in there all these years. The owner cars. I didn't know that the oil was in there and they each got to change it. When should you change it? Every 30 to 50,000 miles. I'm dying to fucking change it. I'm dying to take that fucking thing off the back. I've watched enough youtube videos to know how to do it. I'm changing the oil. It's easy. You just gotta. You just gotta get one of those Torque wrenches and know what you're supposed to fucking put the screws back. Two pounds per square, whatever the fuck it is. Or is that air? I Dunno. Fuck you. I can figure it out. But you know what sucks on my truck, the 68 f 100, um, that backing plate that usually faces the back of the car on mine. It's on, it faces the engine. It's on the other side.

Speaker 1:          00:35:57       So the drive shaft is there. What? That other fucking thing. And then there's that. So I would have to take off all of that and drain it out. And I know what you guys would think and bill for the love of fucking God. Don't do that to yourself as much as you probably get a funny bit out of it. Please do not do, I didn't know the other people who just love people, the fried and shorts or have you the fuck you say it. They'll be like, yeah, we'll give that a whirl. See how that happens? That's a fucking scary thing to do because that's not, that's not a an injury you can walk away from. In other words you don't, it's weird at that point is if is if I did all that and I couldn't get that shit back together, I could still start my truck up and I could go through all the gears and all of that shit.

Speaker 1:          00:36:44       Well, grant, I've against the transmission fluid would be Lincoln leaking out. If I took off to fucking, what if I took off the, uh, what's that called? The drive shaft. If I took that fucking thing, I'm going to do it. Fuck you up. Tried it. I just, I'm just fascinated with the fact that I don't think it's ever been changed in that there's air in there from, it was put together in March according to the, the, uh, the number inside the door. It was put together in Ontario. Believe it or not, Ford had an Ontario plant or something like that. And uh, in March of 1968 and somebody close that fucker up and that air has been trapped in there. And I think it's high time I released it. I guess it's an ungodly fucking smell. But I posted this video before, um, for people like me who don't know shit about cars and are just starting to learn, um, it's a very intimidating part of the car and to actually see the genius of how it fucking works, I'm going to post that video again because I absolutely love it and I'll actually show this guy from a bleeping jeep, um, youtube, uh, or is it bleeping jeep.com he gets in there, he changes the oil and he does some other shit in there.

Speaker 1:          00:37:56       And then, then, then on youtube there'll be a bunch of other fucking youtube videos. We can actually look at all the fucking gears in there despite it gives the pinion gears all that shit. You know, I watched this guy take an axle off and all that type of, with the little fucking c clamp, whatever the fuck it is. I, it was fascinating shit. The balls to go in that deep. That's what I, I just have to respect it. And speaking of respect, even though I missed all the Games, I watched the highlights. I just saw the, the third period in the shootout of the, uh, USA Russia game. How about that fucking Tj. Oh, oh,

Speaker 5:          00:38:33       she, she, Tj,

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       TJ. Oh, she was just basically that are fucking shootout guy. We just kept sending him and he delivered every time. Jonathan quick. I, you know what I loved about him scoring that over is how it went. The second he scored the, uh, the shootout goal that had us beat the Russians, he immediately turned around and he pointed at Johnathan quick, you know, something somebody else could have done when they tip the pass to a linebacker about a month ago. You know, you can do that every once in a while. It's nice to see somebody do that. Um, and Phil Kessel fill, Castle's been crushing it, the former Brooklyn and now Toronto Maple Leaf, who I will be seeing. I will be going to a maple leaf game and I also be going to a, a Canadians Bruins game when I'm up there and I can, I can't fucking believe it.

Speaker 1:          00:39:23       I'm going to see two original six home games and one against another original six and the best fucking rivalry as far as I'm concerned, over the years, you've got to say that, you know, not discounting any of the year great Detroit rivalries and so on, that shit out west. Um, or even the islanders and rangers or flyers and penguins. He's just a fucking great leak. Um, anyways, so that, that tour is coming up quick. I have a week's worth of dates back here for like four days and then I'm in Canada, man and I have not drank for 20 days. By the time you hear this, 21 days and I got to tell you something. I am fucking miserable. I'm not miserable. But I, I miss him, man. I really fucking miss it. I'm not gonna lie. I don't need it. I don't need it. I mean, what, what do you really need?

Speaker 1:          00:40:13       You know, did I need to, to buy another pair of socks? I have other socks, you know, I miss, I should've never broken up with it. I'll live with this regret for the rest of my life. No, I'm basically, me and Versie are not drinking until we get to Canada. Once we get to Canada. It's hilarious right now. I was talking to him, I said, listen, Paul, all right, both haven't drank in awhile. I've been going easy on the stoves and um, you know, it would be a shame if in those 20 days we gave back everything that we gained. And he's like, Oh yeah, dude. Yeah, yeah, no, I, and I, and I say, yes. Listen, I'm not saying I'm not going to drink. I'm not saying I'm not going to smoke a couple of Cubans, but let's just, you know, let's try to, to manage, you know, let's try it.

Speaker 1:          00:41:06       Maybe the first two days we don't drink and then we go to the fucking maple leaf's game. We'll have a couple of beers and, and Paulson, the IAA. Yeah. And then we just start laughing because we know what's going to happen. We know what is going to happen. All right. It's going to be a fucking shit show. So all I'm trying to do is drop as much fucking weight as I possibly can and get into such great shape because I know what the fuck I'm going to do itself. It's fucking over. I'm going to do what every one of you guys would do. So I'll fucking judge me. I can't wait. I can't wait. I wake up every day, you know, I dunno. Yeah. I feel good, but I don't, I, I don't know. What am I supposed to do? I have a porch. How am I not spell? How do you not drink when you have a porch? It's just a, I got a rocking chair, you know, it was easy to not drink when I didn't have a pool. I don't know what it is about the portrait. Just get out there and all of a sudden I wa I want to fucking, I want a drink.

Speaker 1:          00:46:08       I've seen, I've even, I have seen the stories okay. With all the sports and bullshit that I watch. Uh Oh. Speaking of aid, DD and speaking of shows that I love, is anybody watching? True detective, please tell me you're watching. True detective and if you've seen all four episodes, I'm not going to spoil anything for anybody. Okay. I just have to wait for that person. Take that their, their hands away from the ears. I'm not going to ruin anything that's dangerous to drive like that. Stop staring with your knees. Um, I've seen all four episodes and uh, this past week's episode, certain people were, were going on and on about the way it was shot and I think that they actually in, which was amazing, but that gem of a conversation in the bar this week, I absolutely fucking loved it. I thought I'm, it's very rare that I see a scene with both characters are arguing and I feel like they're both 100% right. They're both 100% right in that seat. And uh, it's just, Oh my God, fucking Matthew Mcconaughey, Jesus Christ crushing it. Everybody is

Speaker 1:          00:47:25       Reggie. And even that get that prisoner guy, Reggie, Reggie to do. Did this shit. Mother fuckers do. I fucking love that guy. That's my new show. Everybody considering gas monkey, they're there. I know they were between seasons. Do you know how depressed I am when I get through all of the fast and loud? I watch all of them like three times and then I just have like my favorite ones where they just have certain cars. Um, what are some of my favorite ones? I'll tell you I liked the uh, so my favorite cars did they done was when they um,

Speaker 2:          00:48:02       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:48:02       which one was the, I would say the 55 for that they made for a mark Cuban that that morning I just absolutely fine what they did to that car. Paint it all white.

Speaker 1:          00:48:18       I absolutely in the, in the interior, that fucking car and the way it sounds. Then they did another one. They did this 1950 rocket 88 where they do this thing where you know, it start no Ross, but it's not like debilitating Russ and they just put a clear coat over it. So you've got this bad ass mean looking car that you can lean up against an underneath it. Everything's fucking brand new and it sounds like a fucking based as they go down the road and they got the white wall tires. That was another one that I loved. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:48:48       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:48:49       what else? I even liked that crazy station wagon with the, that opened like a clam shell.

Speaker 2:          00:48:54       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:48:55       There's just been so many. I don't know my face. And then I'll of course though, I've already talked about this, the wine one, Richard tried to sell the car back to the people for 30 grand and they knew what the fuck he's brother comes in. His brother wanted 30 grand and he busted him down to 18 grand and then his other brother comes back and goes, he shouldn't have sold the car. What do you want for it? And Richard was like, yeah, I was thinking like 30 grand. And the other guy's like, hey fuck head. I know what you paid for us. And then Richard just laughed and then they settled for like 20 grand. He still made like 1500 bucks.

Speaker 1:          00:49:26       I fucking love that show. I wish they'd do more motorcycles. Um, anyways, plowing ahead. So my new show now that breaking bad's over, um, is that show true detective? Uh, get in early so you don't feel overwhelmed like I am with house of cards. I know I have to start watching that. Just so many great shows. Shameless. I haven't watched one episode of that. I got a bunch of Shit I have to get caught up on. But um, true detective, I dunno if it can get better than that right now man. It's fucking awesome seat. But add helps me look at this. It helps me on the podcast because I just think of something I just go off like basically what I just did there, I was going to start talking about my add and all of a sudden I'm talking about a 55 Ford, right? And then I bring it back around. It just, it helps on this thing. Have an add is great when you have a podcast because you never run out of shit to say because everything just fucking reminds you of something else. You just keep going. But it my day to day trying to get shit done.

Speaker 3:          00:50:30       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:50:31       And also trying to listen to somebody else. Like everything that they say reminds me, I just reminds me of shit other stuff and I just start thinking of that and I dunno, I even have add, I'm just unbelievably self absorbed. It's probably a little of both that go fuck yourselves. What do you want from me? Um,

Speaker 3:          00:50:59       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:50:59       So anyways, yeah. Oh, don't forget to get your posters. I did mention that I'm scrolling down here and uh, also amazon.com is a great way to donate to this podcast.

You told, you told Conan that Paula Dean would be back on television because she's $100 million whale. I read today she received a $75 million investment from a guy who won't sky mall. She's already in talks with a mate with major television, neck television networks for a new show. Greg, Call Bill Love U podcast. Keep being you. Yeah, Dude. I mean that wasn't, I mean that was obvious. I just predicted that everything that has happened before we continue happening, uh, she's back. She's back. I actually don't have a problem with Paula Dean. I think it's refreshing that she actually said, yeah, I've used the n word. You know what I mean? She was honest.

Speaker 2:          00:52:19       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:52:19       That's really what she was guilty up. She, she really could have just, you know what? I should really shut the fuck up because I can't even remember what she did.

Speaker 2:          00:52:26       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:52:27       Did it start with she had a slave themed wedding. Oh, that's right. It's just what the fuck you don't. She's like, is anybody watching the haunted house show? American horror story me is watching that this year. And the theme was slavery and I fucking, I, I can't sit there and watch that with Nia because I'm afraid she's going to cut me by the end of the God damn show. And you know, was I'm like going, I wasn't alive then.

Speaker 3:          00:52:57       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:52:59       That's what she's like. The uh, Paula Deen is like, uh, what's her face? The woman from misery.

Speaker 1:          00:53:07       She's like the real life version of that in that she's not like, uh, some dead living thing. She's actually alive and she can make cookies. But other than that, I think her politics are the same. Um, all right. Female athlete of the year is a horse. What? Hey Bill, hearing the story last week about the Seattle newspaper snubbing the women's championship reminds me of this story from a few years back. The Daily Telegraph naming the Australian sportswoman of the year and it was a horse. He's got the link right here. I'll put this up for you guys. 2012 the year of the London Olympics were plenty of our female athletes, one gold and gave great performances by our athletes. He means the Australian ones, they completely blew it off and they gave it to a horse here. Here's the link. Also ever thought of adding Tasmania to your itinerary when touring Australia. It's the small island state below the mainland.

Speaker 1:          00:54:08       If you don't know. Got that welcoming. We don't get much down here, so let's make it a good one. Kind of feel. Uh, last time you were in US steel, you mentioned how it's sucked driving so far to get to different places. None of that here can cross the state and about five hours and take in whatever you want in between. Yeah, if you fly, right. Uh Oh, that's me. Oh, in Tasmania. I got it. Okay. Got Some Nice old theaters and the best beers in the country. Not only will you have a blast, I'll save $600 flying over to see you. A win and a win through. Fuck that. I'll go there. They got some old ass theater, Jesus Christ telling me that's not haunted. How many indigenous people is that fucking built on top of? Is it made out of Didgeridoo is um, sorry, sorry for the Hacky fucking Australian humor.

Speaker 1:          00:55:01       I haven't been there enough to give you anything original. I'll be there. Um, although I was upset that, that, that uh, Bruce Springsteen played Perth and his band played highway to hell as a tribute to bond Scott because that's where bond was from and he's buried there. And as cool as that was, as much as I loved it as an ACDC fan, I was like, fuck, I thought I was going to be the, the American that goes over there and let you know that I realized that Bond Scott is from there. I thought I'd get a little star on my forehead and Bruce Springsteen went over there and took it fright from me. All right. I'm done with my temper tantrum. Dethroning the bankers, dear bill, um, I know how much you hate, but the banker cunts and was wondering if you ever considered getting into bitcoin. The decentralized nature of the currency creates no need for central banks controlling everything. I'd suggest creating a bitcoin wallet. And playing around with the small amount of Bitcoin to learn how the system works. It's the most exciting thing in technology and finance. Since the invention of the Internet. Love the podcast. Thanks and go fuck yourself. Uh, and he's nice enough to take to leave the Wikipedia definition either that are Andrew feminists. Let me know what this is. Bitcoin is a peer to peer payment system and digital currency

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       introduced as open source software in 2009 by pseudo Nima develop pseudonymous developer Satoshi Nakamoto.

Speaker 3:          00:56:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:56:38       Nakamoto. Do Japanese people got the best fucking names that Toshi Naca Balta. It's a fucking killer name. Bill burr that Toshi Naca. Malta, a motel knock on multiple, said Doshi Nakamoto. What would you say that if he scored a goal, I can't do it. All right. Let me just continue here. Add. It's a wonderful thing. It's crypto currency, so called because it uses crypto crypto cryptography, no Jesus, to control the creation and transfer of money. Conventionally, Bitcoin, capitalize a refers to the technology and network, whereas lowercase bitcoins refers to the currency itself.

Speaker 3:          00:57:26       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:57:28       Yeah. Well, the, the big problem with this is it's created by human beings. I don't think that bankers a necessarily evil. I just think that they have or more evil than I am. They just, they're in a position to absolutely devastate everyone walking the planet. International bankers have that ability. But I, I really think that the more,

Speaker 3:          00:57:50       MMM,

Speaker 1:          00:57:53       I dunno, the more I read up on it and stuff, it's just a bunch of greedy counts. And like somebody saying right now, the big conspiracy is that they're going to try to bankrupt all currencies to eliminate all wealth on the planet and then come back with the new currency and well, I know that they're not going to eliminate their own wealth, so they're going to make everybody on the planet broke except for them and they're going to survive. Now. Maybe they can do it, but I don't, how do you pull that off? That seems like that would have a very finite, um, life before people were just like, all right, I don't know about you guys, but there's like nine people left in the world that can afford a three piece suit. And it's not any one of us 7 billion. What do you say? We go over there and beat them with their pocket watches. You know, it's eventually when that happened,

Speaker 3:          00:58:49       I dunno. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:58:52       yeah, I, I would just like to go back to just open bartering, just trading shit. Hey, I'll give you this shirt for that sandwich. I got plenty of shirts. Fuck you. Don't want hungry again, but look at my waistline. I look awesome. All right. Um, I'll read up on it, sir. I'll look up on it. Uh, I look up on it. Oh, I'll read up on it and I'll look it up. How about that? I'll do both of those things. I'll look it up and then I'll read up on it. A lot of up going on there. All right. Donation, currency. Hey bill, longtime listener loved the show, Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Let's get right to the point. Um, the person wrote Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Before you think I'm being arrogant, let's get right to the point you should think about adding an another way of donating on your website, bitcoins.

Speaker 1:          00:59:31       Why is that? You have fans in places so fucking strange that you don't even know where it is on the goddamn glove. Go Fuck Yourself. I know where most places are in the globe and I know their capitals, at least I used to. It's in my head somewhere. They use different currency, which might be a problem. Bitcoin is providing an easy way to dismiss a commercial and easy way to transfer wealth. Use it and welcome to the 21st century. By the way, I'm from Poland. It's really cold in here. It's a second language. All right? Um, I, I would think that if whoever starts bitcoin, if they don't get murdered in the next calendar year, then it's just started by the bankers. Um, or they're just going to buy it up. They'll sell out. Right? I don't know. I'm not going to fucking start using a new currency. All right?

Speaker 1:          01:00:23       I saw what happened with the euro. I'm going to go with bitcoin. That started by some fucking hippie Japanese guy, or even worse, a businessman, Japanese guy that Jesus Christ. You can't tell me. They're not still upset by the, uh, the two piece we gave them back in the forties. Um, adopt or birth. Dear Billy, read Billy red white beard bur thanks for the laughs and look forward to seeing you soon in Calgary, Calgary, KL, Gorag whole category. I'll gladly take you out with, with a couple of buddies for some ice hockey and a couple of nonalcoholic Bros unless you're back on the wagon. Yeah, let's get shit faced and play hockey. Dude. I'll bring in my skates. You provide a right handed stick and his ski Parka. I'll play some pond PandaDoc. Um, in which case we'll enjoy some Granville island. Oh, is that some Bruce?

Speaker 1:          01:01:26       I know. What the fuck. Yeah, I guess I'm off off the wagon. Granville island. See, see what I'm saying? You see how much weight I'm going to gain up there? No, but then if I played pond hockey, he'll skate it off. Ah, genius. Anyways, my wife and I are toying with the idea of either adopting a kid are doing it the old fashioned way and making a baby ourselves. She's only 27, so it's not like she's incapable of making babies. But she preferred to adopt a Korean kid because a, those orphan kids need home be, she'd like to skip the crying baby phase and see that Korean kid will make me filthy rich one day. Jesus Christ doing what? Um, personally I think all what if it's a female, get it into golf projected they're destroying female golf right now ladies, they hitting off the lady teas there.

Speaker 1:          01:02:14       Personally, I think all her reasons are legit, but I'm seriously freaked that if we give birth to a second baby, a love that second baby more than my Korean kid that happened to a friend of mine who adopted and then had another kid and was ashamed of himself that he honestly felt more love for the second one even though he still loved the adopted kid. What would you do here if you were me? Adopter, make one yourself a two and I can't make that decision. And I think it's natural that you feel more of a connection to your own kid. But, um, I don't think that would affect the decisions you'd make unless she had some Sophie's choice that you had to make. I think have your buddies just being really honest. Um, I dunno. I don't think it's a good reason to adopt a kid gives you think it's gonna make you money. Most orphan kids do need homes. I agree with a B. She'd like to skip the crying baby phase. You know what? Both of you guys are a couple of psychos. You're trying to make money. She does it. I don't think you want a kid

Speaker 1:          01:03:12       skip this crying baby phase. That doesn't sound like a mom. What about when it can talk and that's the whiny phase.

Speaker 6:          01:03:20       Like, I don't know why

Speaker 1:          01:03:22       vegetables. Well fuck

Speaker 6:          01:03:24       yeah, you're not mine anyways. You want to go back to the orphanage? Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:03:29       possibly to fix your baby teeth. Right? That's what she's going to do. I think both of you guys should have a kid when you, you want to have a kid for the right reason. Maybe you just trying to be funny. I don't know what, I don't know. Jesus Christ. All right. A D d a d d coming to a theater near you. Hey Bill, you're a funny guy. You amuse me, but before you go all Peshy, I thought I'd run something past you. Um, does that mean Joe Peshy or you does that Italian for fish on the north? That is your recent self diagnosis of add. It wasn't self-diagnosis. It was from my, my wife I think could be PTSD. He said not showing me any sort of credentials. I'm not an expert. Okay, so now I can't sue them, but I have a self diagnosis of myself with this condition. Isn't the internet wonderful? I had an injury to the left side of the brain when I was young, which led to the right brain compensating and in turn this led to above average creative skills. Hopefully you're just a naturally funny fucker by suggest reading about this condition if you've been looking into that stuff. Well, I got run over by a jeep. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Hey

Speaker 1:          01:04:51       wait. You had an injury to the left side of your brain. That's where I got hit. I was riding on my bicycle. I was trying to beat my brother home. I cross the street without looking and I got hit by a jeep. I was upside down and I got hit right on the temple. So I told you guys about this before, when you, when you bite down on your Moelis by putting, put your hand right in the side of your, of your temple as if you're pointing like, ah, that's a smart suggestion there Brian. Yeah, that part of your scope. Put it right there and then bite down on your molars. You feel that thing that goes in and out. That's right where I got hit. And it happened on a Wednesday. I remember that because the doctor said I didn't have to go to school for the rest of the week and I got a four day weekend, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

Speaker 1:          01:05:38       And My fucking jaw hurts them. It hurts to open the hurt to chew. So eight with a little spoon. And I had raisin bran. I remember all of that. Um, I dunno if that's why I'm, I became what I became. I wonder if that's true. I have no idea. I made people laugh before that. I was, I was fucking killing it in kindergarten. Um, that's interesting. I will look that up, sir. PTSD. All right. You know what debt is the podcast for this week, everybody. That's the podcast for each of you. Now go back to work.
