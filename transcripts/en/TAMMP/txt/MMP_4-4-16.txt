Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on is still burning. It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Man da. Um, April 4th, 2016. How's it going? How I yeah, I am an Ottawa, Canada right now. Oh, can uh, it's fucking freezing here. Every time I come, I know. Stroll stick together. Um, yeah, we came, we did fucking almost in Wichita. I don't know what the fuck the named place. Windsor. We did Windsor. Me Versie and fucking Joey be job partner. We did a Windsor the first day.

Speaker 1:          00:00:49       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:00:50       I don't even know what day that is yet. Friday we did it on Friday and um, I bought this little fucking bitchy coat. Nia calls it the Kleenex code. It's just to Celine, all those little ones in the 70s. And when they had the big puffy coats, well, they're still making the puffy coats to not just like, they're like little once, you know what I mean? They look like little, uh, you know, like you're, you're a rib shack and you open a little thing and then give me a little morsel. Talent looks like there's a bunch of those sewn into the code. You know that. Thank you know what the fuck coat on talking about? Well, it was all north north face numbers. So I got dad on a Hoodie because I looked at the fucking forecast and it said that um, you know, it's going to be like 50 degrees and that coach good down to 40. So I thought I was fine. I was fine. I was snug like a little bug in a rug with first. Was it two days? What hell was I? The second day.

Speaker 1:          00:01:52       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:01:53       Oh, the second day I was at Casino Rama. That's right. And that's when it started to snow and that's when I started questioning my, my jacket game is the young kids say my jacket game was not on point. However, by the way, I didn't bring any of my fucking podcast equipment because you know this trip is a motherfucker. All right. This is one of these, it's known in my businesses. A thrash. All right? Sometimes you go on the road, it's a fucking cake walk. All right. Whatever the fuck that means. What is a cake walk? I know. I've never even looked that up. Is there a certain kind of way you walk when you fucking carrying a cake? Maybe that's what it is. Sorry if I'm fucking, the levels are too high year. Just trying to talk to him. I recorded like a microphone. Um, that's going to be my guess.

Speaker 1:          00:02:45       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:02:46       Is that when you have a fucking cake, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:02:50       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:02:51       If you have a KCI going to be be walking a little gingerly, no offense to me. Right?

Speaker 2:          00:02:57       So you walk a little lightly with it. Maybe you know what you're walking like you walk in like Paul Versey when he puts on his fucking Jordan fours for the first time, you should have seen him walking down the casino. He was walking like on his heels because he didn't want to create some, I got to tell you something. I don't fucking understand. People who fucking stand in line and then stab each other over a fucking pair of sneakers. I just really, dude, did you see they got the new Jordans? Three zero dude, that fucking crazy. The new Jordan threes are fucking crazy. I swear to God, they all look like nurse shoes to make big, stupid, bulky looking fucking things. I think I have a pair of Jordan ones. I liked the colors. I never liked those fucking things. Either one, they came out and they were red and black.

Speaker 2:          00:03:46       I thought those were the ugliest fucking thing. So I told you before, I'm farther back in the day. I liked those Bruce Jenner. Um, the capital on shoes, you know, just simple pair with fucking three stripes on the side. I was cool with sneakers, right through towards the end of the eighties when they started having like the fucking Bo Jackson, the Neon, Deon fucking remember that neon green and Neon pink. Those fucking sunglasses to second and went into that shit. Those pastel colors and the stupid fucking Reebok pump. Oh, maybe if I put some more air in my sneakers, I won't have white guy legs. The Reebok pumps where we're as stupid is Batman versus Superman there. Alright. Okay Shirley. Here we go. This cake walk. Surely you've heard the term cakewalk. Did somebody write a whole fucking article on this? Good Lord. Cut to the fucking chase. All right. I'll read this as fast as I can. Surely you've heard the term cakewalk used to describe some sort of challenge or tasks that is reckoned to be pitifully easy. Surely you have what you stop saying that? Stop calling me. Surely. Surely you have. Please. Please don't lie. Good Lord. Who fucking wrote this?

Speaker 1:          00:05:09       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:05:11       The figurative definition has been around since the early 19th century. As long as the literal one, in fact it appeared in print, but did you know that the term is actually pretty racist, racist, racist, racist? I'll bet you didn't. What the fuck is wrong with this idiot who this is such a classic, you know, if you actually had to get a real job writing, you wouldn't have one. You know, everybody on the Internet fancies themselves like there's some sort of journalist, you know when they're writing, this is just no, you just fucking write in on a w.

Speaker 1:          00:05:45       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:05:45       It's like acting in a web series and you're upset. You didn't get nominated for a fucking Oscar. Uh, nor did I. Okay. Did you know it was pretty racist? Um, I'll bet you didn't.

Speaker 1:          00:06:01       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:06:02       What? Because you don't know some shit and that means everybody else does it and you fucking cunt. I mean, I didn't know it, but I'm a moron. I really don't like this person. Uh, he said nor did I. Okay. That's the first humble thing this person said, maybe you can come around. Maybe I was wrong. I still don't think I could drive cross country with this person. Um, nor did I until I looked into the origin of the term and found out it had roots in the,

Speaker 1:          00:06:26       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:06:26       I don't know how to say this word. Antebellum south of the early 19th century. Can you just tell me what the fuck it means? I would started during this era of firmly entrenched slavery in the states. The cakewalk was a dance event where slaves were invited to dress up in the fine clothes and took on the heirs of the white aristocracy. Oh, so this is like when the Wayans brothers did white chicks. What do they do? It? Is this like the first def jam comedy? They started doing the white gay voice. I said, get out in the field to do the work that I should be doing. And everybody starts flipping out, dying, laughing. The next slave coming to the stage. Um, all right. They were held in the plantation home in the same rooms where the risk splendid balls were held among white society. Oh my God. How much did those people fucking stink back then? Putting on all those extra layers of clothes? No such thing as deodorant. Right. Just join you as one of those things where you're washed yourself in the same fucking trough. The God damn horses drank out of, uh, the cakewalk was similar. It was a ball held for the slaves. Oh, so this is a Christmas party. I didn't know they did that.

Speaker 1:          00:07:47       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:07:47       I didn't see that. And roots, you know, it wasn't all bad. Every once in a while they had look a company party after 364 and a half days of absolute horror than they would. They let him in the house. Yeah. Hey, sorry about all that other shit. Would you like some pumpernickel the wife just made it. Oh, let's get him out of the house side. They seem to be a little restless. That's fucking nuts. Oh, what an ugly period. The cake like, you know, like [inaudible] parried but you know Celeste ugly. All right, let's continue. Okay. The cake walk was similar. It was a bald ball held for the slaves. Couples promoted promenaded sorry. Through the ballroom, bowing deeply and frequently. Chins and noses held highly aloft. If you're going to tell me, they finally gave him a fucking party and they still were assholes about it. The couple who performed the best interpretation of how the white folks did it. One a cake baked one imagines by a slave.

Speaker 2:          00:08:53       I didn't imagine that stuff put words in my mouth. I would figure the white people after all the fucking time. But yeah. Well, you know what? Uh, I consider we ruined their fucking lives. I think we can make them a cake once a year, but we're only given it to one of them. Jesus Christ. Every time you think you've found the depths of how evil that shit was, he, you find another layer. Oh my God. Another layer. Just like a cake. Jesus. I'm an artist this morning. All right. The cake walk looks similar, but it was also very different. It's intent was to emulate white society in order to market or the Jesus, there's a dangerous fucking gave me, I told you this is like the first def jam comedy and much the same way as oh Jesus Christ. Saturnalia the ancient Rome winter solstice festival. Oh yeah. Exactly. Watching the same fucking way, um, where the rules of social order were turned upside down in the slaves and laborers became the rulers and Matt and masters attended attend their servants. Oh they did this in Rome. This is just all fucking weird. Can you imagine the tension during that? So then the master's fucking

Speaker 1:          00:10:13       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:10:14       Tended to the slaves and you know, the slaves wanted to be just as fucking me, but then they were like, well we got to kind of alligator arm this shit cause it goes back to the regular way tomorrow. And then I would think the master be like, all right, you want me to wade into that sea of hatred towards me? Um, uh, just keep an eye on me. Please stay tight. Okay. It's still the left side of my nose. That means a, I'm fearing for my life. Uh, the slaves involved did indeed mark the ridiculously refined customs of the aristocracy. Yes. And they surely meant it, but during the cakewalk they were allowed to mock them. And by ruling over even the very event that should undermine his authority, the plantation owners, managers to assert his authority. You know something? I was in such a fucking good mood. I hate this shit.

Speaker 1:          00:11:10       Okay?

Speaker 2:          00:11:10       It's a fucking cakewalk. Well, you know what? I already clicked off. So how does that mean? It's easy. What does that mean? It's, it's a cheap laugh and know I got to go back. I just closed the fucking window. I got to go back. So how the fuck did that? Because that does not sound easy to me. Being a slave all year and then doing one. Did you get to do one fucking day? We get to make fun of this. The master. It's not a cakewalk and struck a difficult, right? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:11:40       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:11:42       All right. As if its roots in slavery don't make the cakewalk racially charged enough. It transitioned in the menstrual show. How did it transition into making something easy of the Jim Crow era or even, or even worse? Um,

Speaker 1:          00:11:58       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:11:59       Gone was even the power. A lot of to the slaves.

Speaker 1:          00:12:02       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:12:03       By the mark and just have the original cakewalk and stage reproductions of balls of the balls. White performers in blackface performed as blacks who made sincere clumsy attempts at emulating whites out of a desire to be like them, not to undermine them. Ah, okay. And then it became that. I still don't understand why it's easy. The original cakewalk.

Speaker 1:          00:12:26       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:12:27       Walks being local affairs. How the, you know what? Fuck the fucking Internet. All right. Can I fast forward to this?

Speaker 1:          00:12:43       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:12:44       Oh God, he use the word apparently. There's no other word. Alternative comics like to use more than that apparently. All right. Clumsy attempt. So I thought the original cake walks were being local affairs held in the confines of the set southern plantation, the minstrel shows traveling as a matter of course, it was later interpretation and it became defined the concept of the rest of the country in the world and what the kids describe. Perhaps it's a deep desire to stop being so incredibly racist American society as a whole. The banner, the racial basis of the cakewalk in favor of it's simply describing something so easy that just walking could yield the reward of a cake. There it is. The definition is still vaguely racist.

Speaker 1:          00:13:26       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:13:27       It isn't racist if you think that definition means it's going to be easy. You're not even being remotely vaguely racist. You just don't know the history,

Speaker 1:          00:13:35       right?

Speaker 2:          00:13:38       Yeah. Jesus Christ. All right, well there's that was fucking depressing. Um, well fortunately I'm up here in Canada where, you know, they have all the angelic white people according to Michael Morris, you know, up here they're all a bunch of angels and nobody has to lock their doors. Uh, which of course we know that's true. Just generally speaking, people don't get along with one another. Um, all right, so that was an excruciating 15 minutes. I don't know how you guys enjoyed it. So anyways, kind of fuck did I get onto that shit? Oh, because yeah, I thought the whole, um,

Speaker 1:          00:14:19       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:14:20       I thought the, I thought this whole trip was going to be a muffin dance. How about that? Can I say something like that? That was going to be a little muffin dance. Did you know that the origins of Buffett Dance, um, you actually, our pro domestic violence. I bet she didn't. Surely you've heard the term muffin dance before. Please, please, please don't tell me you have not.

Speaker 1:          00:14:48       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:14:49       The origin of Muffin dance comes from the early 19 hundreds when women, when they asked, can we vote to, were forced to show their clams and dance out of the voting booths as people through desserts at the, uh, this became known as the muffin dance because clamp indicated that their pussy stunk and turn men off. Later in 1929, the great, great grandson of Abraham Lincoln said, I cannot tell a lie. Some of these bitches clamps to stink, but there's still reason to make them do a muffin. Dads, they should be allowed to vote too. And all the guys said, yeah, you know what? You're right. And everybody had muffins. So next time you used the term buffer dance, just know that you're being vaguely sexist. Um, all right, I'm sorry. Why am I doing this? Why am I talking like this? Why of why am I sitting here in this fucking freezing cold hotel room? I can't find where the fucking heat is. I'm saying in one of these. Um, and I'm a red rum. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:16:04       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:16:06       Well just one of those, you know, I like old shit to a point, you know, I like, I thought I liked had having an old house until I fucking had to deal with it.

Speaker 1:          00:16:14       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:16:15       Oh, all the bullshit of how on an old house, old hotels, I kind of like, I loved the lobbies, but the second you fucking go up to your room, you start walking down the hall. You know, you feel like you should be riding a big wheel and you're going to come around the corner, and those too creepy fucking chicks are going to be standing there. God dammit, that fucking movie freaked me out. That movie still got, it's still disturbing. That's just a disturbing fucking movie, you know? And it's not the fact that he goes completely fucking insane. It's just as a comedian watching a man suffering through writer's block like that, and having that woman coming up who's face is shaped like a fucking parking meter, asking you how it's going every fucking 20 minutes. I love how they blame the fucking hotel rather than that, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:17:04       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:17:05       Why did I, would you say she means well? Yeah, they just were a bad couple. I think that that's what it was. And when they went down in society, they could go to events and they could sort of watered down. They're awful relationship by interacting with others. And then once they just got, you know, let's say we'll just stay in there at the fucking hotel, you know, for the whole God damn winter. I don't understand why they had to be there to watch it. You know what I mean? Like what do you, what are you going to be doing up there? I mean, it's, it's some, it's the level with which said, it's going to fucking snow. No asshole. He's going to go up there and vandalize the place. If they come there, it's cause they need shelter. It was really no reason

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       for it, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:17:54       And that was also a vaguely racist movie, wasn't it?

Speaker 1:          00:17:58       You know,

Speaker 2:          00:18:00       seeing that reverse racist, that white people will be like, oh yeah. Oh the fucking snow's 50 feet in the fucking air. Oh yeah, I got to write a book. Yeah. Why don't I fuck it? Go up there. Y'All hang out there and I'll, I'll do my own room service every fucking day. I'll stay in room fucking 706 and every day I'll take a fucking elevator all the way downstairs to the kitchen.

Speaker 2:          00:18:27       How, who the fuck would sign up for that free, didn't have any sympathy for, you know, I'm just fucking with you. I think it's a great movie. I'm just in a grumpy, goddamn moved considering I going to drive from fucking Ottawa. Are we up to Sudbury? And then right after the show I got to do my travels all fucked up. I got to drive over to fuck Detroit, which is like a fucking eight hour drive. You know, it takes me back to the days when I was doing college gigs and I remember one time I had this gig and the upper peninsula of Michigan, right? Some fucking town up there that began with an h. All right, so like an asshole. I'm like, alright, I'm in Michigan and I didn't look on the map to see where, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:19:16       to see where, you know, basically the fucking college was at and I just, I just flew right into fucking Detroit and then I realized that the upper peninsula as actually it's sort of, you know, it's the Dick of Wisconsin. I should have flown into fucking Milwaukee and driven up, but I didn't, I flew into Detroit and I had to go drive all the way up the whole fucking state. It was pretty cool cause I got to drive over there. Whatever bridge that is, the Mackinaw bridge and whatever the fuck it is. I'm trying to look it up right now, but I can't remember the name of the fucking, I think it was Marquette. Oh, he started begin with an age maybe. I was thinking Lake Huron. I think it was in Marquette. I did a fucking gig up there. Yeah. And I had like a, I forget what time my flight was, but I had to basically, it was an early morning flight in Detroit. It was like a fucking eight hour drive or some shit, seven hour drive. And the show didn't start till nine I was done at 10 o'clock and had like a six or 7:00 AM flight. I can't remember. And I just, I was just like, you know, ah, goodnight everybody. And I jumped in my fucking car and just drove like a fucking lunatic after her. Are you having done the drive?

Speaker 2:          00:20:41       Drove all the way back. Just like nodding off. Almost fallen asleep as one of the dumbest things I ever did. Just trying to save like the fucking $50 change fee or some shit like that. So you would think that I would learn from that.

Speaker 1:          00:20:54       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:20:55       Not Old freckles, but this time we actually have a, I got like Barnett confers you to help me with the fucking drive.

Speaker 1:          00:21:01       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:21:02       Oh my God. Dude. Sudbury is

Speaker 1:          00:21:05       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:21:06       Yeah. It's as high up as fucking

Speaker 2:          00:21:10       the upper peninsula. Michigan. What a fucking ass off for some reason they're going. Yeah, there's never really know airports around here. I don't know why we didn't just take a couple of puddle jumper, so I have no fucking, oh, I know why. I know why. Initially I was picking up a rental car in Detroit and I was going to drive this whole thing and then at the last second they're like, you know, it's a pretty long fucking drive. So I said, hi. Well we'll fly most of it and then we'll do the thing, you know? Then we'll get the rental car, we get the rental car and fucking Ottawa, blah blah blah. We'll do it one way. But then I was still leaving out of Detroit. This is so fucking stupid. Oh, this is gonna suck. But anyways, what will be cool tonight I'm playing a uh, a small, like a hockey arena and a, I was going to be great.

Speaker 2:          00:21:54       Ask him to be fucking good time. I did. I played one of those last night here in Ottawa, Ell, civic center, whatever the fuck it was called. Uh, anyways, this is, and what the fuck I want to talk about. I need something else I want, I want to talk about, but I got to read the fucking advertising here. I know this podcast is all over the place. Okay. I can't say it's a fucking cake walk anymore. Can't say the cake walk anymore because now I know it's fucking racist. All right, well actually I go, I can't say it to you guys, but I could say it somewhere else. You know who's kidding who I'm going to say I'm going to say it cause I've been saying it my whole fucking life. You know, it's just going to cut and that's, that's how you book. That's how you become an old person. Or someone's going like grandpa.

Speaker 1:          00:22:35       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:22:36       Do you know the origin of that? Oh, shut up your first year. Freshmen. All right. You fucking concept. Been around 80 years. Stop breaking my balls. If I want to say 23 scooter, God damn it. I'm going to say it. If you know it was cute, you almost kill your fucking grandfather trying to get them to stop saying something. All right, let me, let me get to the uh, advertising here.

Speaker 2:          00:23:00       Oh, here we go. Oh, the old trunk club. Trunk Club. Everybody. Do you hate going to the mall? Sure. We all do. You surely you've been to a mall. Surely you're not going to sit there and say you haven't. Um, trunk club shopping takes forever and no one has time for it. Well, people will enjoy it too. They live for it. Let's go shopping. It'll is fucking dope. It just go down and they will sit there and look at outfits. You know, never once putting their ear up to the shirt and hearing the crying child that's sewed it together. You know, throwing out their old fucking clothes just end up in the ocean or in some hipsters back who pretends he had the job you had. Right. Um, shopping, you know, I just always drop off clothes at goodwill. Who's kidding? Who I still do. And I thought it went to fucking homeless people and it doesn't, it just goes right on their racks and they turned around and they sell them, which makes me feel good knowing that they don't end up in a goddamn ocean.

I think that it has to be a joke. Nobody needs pastel polos and boat shoes. I think that those should only be for the upper 1% of this country. You know what I mean? It's for the robber barons and their date rape his children, you know, and they can walk around and won't be great as you make an exclusive for them. So they'll feel like, oh, look at us. We are a cut above. It will be like a status symbol. But really what it is is it's a warning for anyone that dates their children.

In fact, again, getting really chafed cause it's cold. You me undies. We'll keep him warm. Alright me undies. By the way, if you ever skate the canal out here, I've always been afraid to do it. You know, I, I've done it, but I was nervous when I did it. I just kept thinking about the omen like I was going to fall through and everyone's going to be hacking at the ice trying to get me out again. The canals only a foot deep, you know, it's really no big deal. So worst thing that could happen is you could get severe frostbite, may have to remove both your feet like in that movie misery.

Speaker 2:          00:29:15       Um, well in the movie she just fucking breaks his ankles and the book, she cuts off his fucking feet. I love when they do shit like that and it's just like, okay so you've severed a major artery and this guy somehow doesn't bleed out in the bed. Cause let me guess, you tied your fucking belt around his calf. Does that even work by the way? If somebody fucking did you see the fucking redneck that blew his God damn leg off? Oh my God, this is new fucking thing that rednecks are doing. You know, cause they just love shooting stuff and blowing stuff up. And as much as people you know, who don't have their own spread living in the middle of nowhere, judge them somewhere in the back of your head, you know, it's fun,

Speaker 2:          00:30:02       you know, riding around on a fucking four wheelers, shooting a gun on your own fucking property. You know, it's got to feel great. That's a level of freedom that I, I've never heard, I've never felt, you know, I live in the city where there's noise ordinances, you know, which basically noise on my property should not carry over. Like you can basically call the cops if somebody splashed around that pool too loud. He's mocked the fact I don't have one. Um, the cops go over, then he just started beating people, right? Or air quote, getting the situation under control. Um, Christ, what the fuck was I just talking about? Oh yeah. Riding around, you know, so I watched this, this new thing that they do. They take this some sort of explosives and they put it in these old cars and then hopefully they stand far enough away and the fucking thing blows up. Well, this fucking guy, alright, redneck blows. Look at this shit right here it goes. Redneck blows himself up, blows up house, blows himself up in a bonfire, blows up pigs almost blows his head off. This is such redneck stuff. Stupid redneck blows himself up. A fire blows up, blows himself up. Boat Motor blows up. Fucking rednecks and crazy blows leg off.

Speaker 1:          00:31:36       Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:31:37       let's see. Where is it? Come on. All right. Yup. And an American gun enthusiast. A. Yeah, that's an all American in there. American Georgia man loses leg f for explosives filled lawnmower. Um, I will link you that she don't see his leg blown off, but you blow blow off his body. But this guy, basically, it's called, uh, I hope I say it right Tanner. Right? It's some sort of explosive and the new thing that these rednecks too is they fucking

Speaker 1:          00:32:11       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:32:12       He fucking, uh, you know, you put it in whatever vehicle in order to is, it's really what's going on here with these rednecks are starting to be a little more classy, you know, after all these fucking years of, uh, you know, having a card die, they just leave it on their front lawn. Now they're getting rid of it. They're blowing them up. So they put this Tanner, right? Whoever the fuck he saying this is explosive and there's some sort of formula like basically for every such and such amount, you need to be like a hundred feet back. All right? So let's say whatever. What we'll just say this guys, if he, he's got a handful of this fucking Tanner. Oh God. We're doing math now, Bill. Alright. And he needed, he basically needed to be about like, I don't know, 500 feet back and he was 40 feet away from this lawn mower. Any fucking shoots the shit. Right? He fucking shoots ish. And uh, he blows the fucking thing up.

Speaker 1:          00:33:11       All right. Listen to this shit.

Speaker 2:          00:33:17       Yeah. Somebody had to do their fucking Dj remix of it. Anyways, he's shooting and he's shooting a lot more shit. All of a sudden it fucking blows up and then he's on the ground and you see it. You just, you can't see anything. You just at the camera's pointing at the ground, he just hear him go, I blew my leg. Oh, fucking unbelievable. I'm amazed that he could actually say that. I would just be staring at the stop going. Ah. I mean, well he's got to tell that story for recipe. At what point does that, can he laugh along with everybody else? You know? I bet he's considered like a tragic, tragic figure now and the redneck community, you know, like he'll probably, you know, at the next cross burning, they let him light it. He hobbles up and everybody gives him a round of applause. Like they're all fucking sad. Like what happened to them with some sort of a terrorist act rather than self imposed fucking stupidity. Jesus Christ, you know, I feel bad for the guy, but

Speaker 1:          00:34:25       okay,

Speaker 2:          00:34:25       the fuck are you doing shooting a God damn gun at dynamite basically, whatever the fuck it is in a God damn lawn mower. That's the fucking blade alone. The shrapnel from that, I gotta look this shit up. Top 10 dumb ways to blow you out to die. All right, let's see. We'll go with that today. All right. What? You don't want to hear your march madness brackets, top 10 dumb ways to die.

Speaker 1:          00:35:15       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:35:16       playing with guns. I don't fucking know I or top 10 dumbest ways to die. Here we go. All right. Starving in a supermarket. I don't even want to read that one.

C'Mon. 10 absolute dumbest. Wasted. Die.

Speaker 1:          00:35:48       All right,

Speaker 2:          00:35:50       this is all going to be clickbait horse shit. Okay? You know what? Go Fuck Yourself. He goes, should be dying right now waiting for me to read this shit. Trying to kiss a reflection of the moon in a lake. All right? Somebody died doing that and then I got to click another page. You know what I mean? Once he can have advertising on every fucking page and somehow you can fucking afford Twinkies this month. Go Fuck Yourself. All right. So when it was, just talk about the,

Speaker 1:          00:36:17       okay,

Speaker 2:          00:36:18       the Tory or so the first, the first day we were in Windsor, right across from Detroit and um,

Speaker 1:          00:36:26       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:36:27       It was awesome. Our upstate, this great hotel and you can look right across the, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:36:32       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:36:33       What are the fucker was, I guess it isn't Lake Eerie, isn't it?

Speaker 1:          00:36:36       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:36:37       It's just a river.

Speaker 2:          00:36:39       I don't know what the fuck you call it. Is it a sound? Oh, the Detroit river. And you see beautiful downtown Detroit and Detroit never looks more beautiful when you're not in Detroit when you're across the fucking river. Looking at it from Windsor. And I just kept asking a bunch of people like, cause I'm going to invest, I want to buy something in Detroit, I'm going to do it. God dammit, you know, invest back in America. I think I totally believe in that city. I know it's going to come back. And I was asking people where to fucking invest and they would just all laugh. And you're like about 40 miles north. Like nobody believes in it, which is what's making me want to fucking buy. They're even more, you know, it's fucking dirt. God damn cheap. It's gonna to come back at some point. It has to come back. Sit right there on the river. I know the fucking Cleveland Cavaliers guy bought up a bunch of fucking skyscrapers there has got to, you know, he put like the people from Google and one of them I have no idea.

Speaker 1:          00:37:38       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:37:39       but the shit is so cheap there. I don't, I don't get how you fucking loose. And I liked the idea. You go in there, right? You've fixed the fucking place up that you buy and then you don't kick the people out that live in there. And then they got a nice place to live.

Speaker 1:          00:37:53       Right.

Speaker 2:          00:37:54       Maybe that gets them in a better mood. Slowly but surely it just start turning it around. I think any American, right, what we should deal with these fucking cities. Cause God knows the government's not going to do anything. I don't think they can because they're bitches to the fucking Federal Reserve bankers, right. I don't have any fucking money. They're robbing Peter to pay Paul. So I think with whatever money they let us keep, we ought to just start fucking, you know, buying up some shit and Detroit, turn it around. Don't kick the people out, get it. Go on and get

Speaker 1:          00:38:28       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:38:28       Maybe then they could start making American cars right. It get

Speaker 2:          00:38:34       start fucking with the, the Audis. And it's a fucking travesty that we don't really have anything they can fuck with those cars. The fact that they're going to allegate around the base level Cadillac, the base level, Lincoln Continental. Alright, I'm going to pale in comparison to what those maniacs in Germany are doing. I mean, I don't understand why you don't, you know, we could fucking do it. I guess Buicks are selling like fucking hotcakes. Is it? Is that a racist, a racist thing. And then we'd kinks in it, I think is racist. Hotcakes. Uh, back in the day when they were actually every 10 years, let us slave have a birthday. One of the things the slave owners would do was actually heat up the cake so we would burn it, burn their mouths because they were that evil. Here's another chapter of white evil that you didn't know existed.

Speaker 2:          00:39:21       Um, selling like hotcakes, I guess hotcakes for pancakes back in the day. And you know, God damn well, you know, having pancakes must have been a fucking tree. Cause I remember back then when you read the Tom Sawyer book, right? Uncle Barry Finn, it's fucking kids paint a fence just to get an apple like that was considered like a treat because all day long you would just sit around even fucking, I don't know if she went on shrubs. I don't know what the fuck you doing. So anyways, I'm, I want to buy them. I want to buy something there and uh, not become the fucking evil person that boots the people out that are in there. He just fixed the fucking place up. It gives a shit, you know, that's of course the people in there then fuck the whole place off. Then I would be upset. You know how much that plastic, because it was Jody do something nice.

Speaker 2:          00:40:16       Um, whatever. Eventually I'm going to look into that. Um, so we did with Windsor and uh, we had a great time and Rosie was there. So of course I smoked a cigar. So you know, you know, I only do two cigars a month now. So last month I only smoked one. February I had two and a half because we started to smoke one and it wasn't smoking well and we have got halfway through and I'm like, it's fucking cigar. Sucks. So actually smoked two and a half. So I smoked two in January. I fucked the fucking rain man right now. So then four and a half, five and a half. So I'm actually half a cigar under my goal for this year. So April 1st used to already smoked a cigar. So now I can only have one more or technically one and a half more. But I'm actually going to try and get down to one a month.

Speaker 2:          00:41:03       And to be honest with you, I'd Kinda like to go all the way to my birthday in June and not smoke another one. Right? Oh goddamn. And I enjoy them. I enjoy, I enjoy the fucking lifestyle. I enjoy the whole fucking thing about it. I love going in. I love picking them out. I love the excitement. I love the smell. I love the old fucking chairs. You sit there. I love that there's no fucking young people there, you know? And by young people, I mean anybody 39 and younger, I used don't run into, you know, everybody's just chilling the fuck out. Smoking a cigar. I don't care what kind of a maniac you are. All these fucking kids that they put on Ritalin and all this type of shit. You just give these kids a cigar. Sam, sit down, puff, you know, next thing you know,

Speaker 2:          00:41:48       you just, you thinking about it, just think about how great life is. There's some of us smoke a cigar. That's how he's, you start thinking about how great it is. Great. It is. He can enjoy the fucking day. You start planning your retirement. How the fuck are you going to get out of this bullshit so you can just sit around in whatever zen you've somehow come into. I mean, I swear to God, if cigarettes make you feel like that, I understand why people do that shit is funny. But you know, nonsmokers like myself, you know, I actually am a smoker now with the fucking cigars, but, um,

Speaker 1:          00:42:22       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:42:23       You know, he's always looked down on a structure. People that smoked cigarettes and they were huddled outside and all that shit.

Speaker 1:          00:42:29       You know,

Speaker 2:          00:42:31       I don't know. Maybe the, maybe they, maybe they know something. I don't, I'm not advocating smoking. I don't know what I'm saying. By the way, Canada, Windsor Airport, Jesus Christ. What a fucking gem that is. I love small airports. There's nothing better than that little ass fucking airport. Then when I went to Toronto, we flew into, we flew over, um, the propeller plane. Jesus Christ, if you sub Rosa, you walk into that. He did. He's, he's one of those guys. I don't, I don't want, if he sees propellers, he feels like he's a riding in like a model t Ford, you know? Um, I always just say to myself, I will, it's, uh, it's going to fly better. Well, we have much less of a chance because there's less working parts here. Perceptive. They go bad, you know, I don't know. That's what I tell myself. So anyways, um, we went to Toronto, we didn't fly into their nightmare fucking airport.

Speaker 2:          00:43:26       We flew to the TR Toronto islands, which I'd never heard of as a fucking little ass airport there we get picked up and we took a little fairy, you know, it's fucking hilarious across the western channel. It literally like, we started to go and I started videotaping it and by the time I pay and from out my side window to the front window, we had already gotten across to you get across it in like 30 seconds. Um, or they have a tunnel, you can walk underneath the western channel. We did that on the way back. It was a nice little ass airport. Um, after all these years of traveling, I love a little mom and pop airport. Get in, get the fuck out. It's hilarious. She show up. They still have the old school metal detectors, so you don't have to go through that fucking radiation shower that for some reason I just don't understand that.

Speaker 2:          00:44:16       So to stop terrorism, you're going to give all your countrymen cancer. Well, if we fucking kill everybody, who they going to blow up? Um, so anyways, how far into this fucking town? 45 minutes anyways, but these shows cannot, it cannot have a bet going any better. And, um, I've been working my ass off in Los Angeles, um, for a reason that I'm not allowed to say yet for whatever fucking reason. So I've been worried that I, I can't, um, you know, I can't fucking, uh, do stand up as much as I'd like. But us, I've been doing a bunch of spots, like little 10 minute spots trying to say shap I just do a little bit of my act, even the jokes, I hate him. Like Dad, I just fucking say it. So you remember how it goes. And, um, I could not be having more fun up here, Matt.

Speaker 2:          00:45:10       Just having a fucking great time. Um, just figuring out my act. I even figured out this new way to trash women that like isn't as fucking mean as I used to do it, but I still get to make the same points, so I just don't come off, you know, was a complete fucking lunatic all the time and I don't want to be that guy, you know what I mean? As much as you know, something I'd realized I never finished reading the me undies think that I, you know. Okay. Whether you're wearing a suit or sweats, you spend almost 24 hours a day and your underwear, but instead of making a statement like Superman's tights under his everyday clothes, your underwear is probably boring. [inaudible] about to change that. Oh yeah. They're, they're about ready to take your balls to the next level. They're going to hang a little disco ball, you know, it's called the third eye, the third ball right out.

Speaker 2:          00:45:58       If you fucking nuts, you know, can you imagine her excited face when she sees a disco ball hanging off the end of your Dick? Right. She probably get that checked. Uh, please include all of the following. No Mo Madell is pronounced modal. Every pair of me undies is made from sustainable source modal, modal fabric. That's twice the softest cotton. Uh, nothing can describe the fit and feel of me undies. But once you try them on, you understand why they're called the world's most comfortable underwear. Um, then if you don't love your first pair of me undies, they're free. No questions asked me. And he says dozens of styles and limited edition prints to help you make a statement with your underwear. Whether anyone could see them or not. Remember Superman. I don't like that joke. I remember Superman. What did, he's fighting Batman. You know, somebody on Worldstar hip hop, one of my favorite fucking websites, you know, watch a people funny vines, you know, music that I'd, I'm completely not even aware of.

Speaker 2:          00:47:04       I get to learn about that shit. And then, uh, to some of the most fucking insane fights you're ever going to see. And there's always a tipping point when you watch fights on Worldstar. Is this always the amazement? And then somewhere it just starts to become sad. If you just start thinking, what is wrong with human beings? Why do we do this shit? Why can't we just go out to a fucking McDonald's or a fucking dance club, you know, and not have like a 50 on 55 I do have to tell you the respect I have for someone that actually would go into one of those modern day Braveheart fucking things. I mean, I don't give a fuck how many martial arts classes you've taken in your life. There is nothing that they teach you in those fucking classes other than to turn around and run, which you already know how to do when you get in the middle of a fucking Malay like that.

Speaker 2:          00:48:01       It's just inevitable. The fucking odds, you know, that's the fight version of being like the helicopter gunner in Vietnam where they had like a fucking a life expectancy of two fucking weeks. It's just, you're just standing there and you know what's going to happen. All right? You're going to, you're going to, something's going to fucking hate you. You're going to get knocked out and I have to tell you the influence of MMA on these fucking street fights. Now back in the day, I seem to remember when you knock somebody out, that was it. You didn't sit on their chest and throw another 40 punches to their head waiting for big John to come over in fucking, you know, usher you out of there. There's no ref. That fucking shit. We already knocked somebody out. Then your boot him in the head. I mean at that point that's like attempted murder, man, you won.

Speaker 2:          00:48:54       You're knocked him out. He'd come up and he'd do this. You sit on that chest to do a fucking speed back. They fucking brutal. But anyways, you know these me undies, I'm going to get through this shipping is free in the u s and Canada and you save up to $8 a pair with me undies subscription plan. I get the subscription. You know, it's like a fucking end zone dance. I always thought it was cooler when you fucking just scored a touchdown. You flip the ball to the ref and like, yeah, I'm going to be doing this all day. If he'd knock somebody out. Yeah. He just turned around like, yeah, my job's done here. You walk away like Clint Eastwood and one of those drifter movies, you know, if you sit on that chastity, like you fucking kind of spazz out screaming, what did I tell you bitch?

Speaker 2:          00:49:40       You know, with your voice goes up nine octaves when your voice goes up like nine octaves like that, you kind of betray your bad ass. And this he kind of is, you hear a level of excitement like, oh my God, I can't believe I won. That's what I always hear. Um, having said that, I wouldn't want to fight anybody in those videos and it's not even the fact that I know I would lose. I just know that after I was knocked out, you do irreputable plucking. I can't even say the word brain damage, which is unnecessary fucking brain damage. You're knocked me out. You want, I'm laying there. Okay. My hands are pointing up into outer space. Um, um, uh, knocked out. You know why he got to go there and knock my melon around more. Um, if I was running for president, I would bring that up.

Speaker 2:          00:50:26       I see in America, that goes back to when you knock somebody out, you walk away like Clint Eastwood in a Spaghetti Western. Uh, all right.

Um, another reason is that Dr Covey's easy shave butter using it with the executive makes the blade glide gently for the smoothest shave ever. Dr Carver's shave butter isn't your average shave cream.

Like is he going to come in in a helicopter and make a truck disappear? Like it doesn't make any sense.

Go to stamps.com before you do anything else, click on the microphone at the top of the homepage and type in [inaudible] that stamps.com enter bur bur there you go. Was that verbatim enough? I'm such a control freak. I can't even handle people who've given me money telling me what the fuck they do. Um, 55 minutes. All right. This whole day's getting away from you haven't even read any of the fucking questions and I haven't even talked about the Bruins. How we're one point out. We beat St Louis and then we lost to Chicago. Um, I of course didn't see any games because I was fucking traveling. Um, you know, it's funny, I had like five or six country Chicago fence talking shit. You know, it's so funny. Last time we played them, we beat them.

Speaker 2:          00:55:54       I don't talk any shit. Do I talk and he should know, right? Hate these fucking people like these, these whack a mole fans that you know, oh we could you rose today. Then they ducked back down. They'll know where to be found. You know, when you fucking loose like Chicago's gun to do in the playoffs, you fucking God damn. Cons. I actually liked the Black Hawks and fans like that make me fucking rude. Root against them. So anyways, um, coming up this week, my Bruins, my beloved Bruins. All right, we are playing. Our next game is uh, uh, where the fuck is that? I think we're playing into, no, he played Carolina, I believe. I think we played Carolina next street. I get the schedule right here. Where is the schedule? All right. We play Carolina on Tuesday. It's at the TD bank, north fucking Home Depot Garden. Whatever the fuck they call it.

Speaker 2:          00:56:51       The Carolina in a tourist sleep plays this tough. They always match up. Well, there's always a tough game. And then we have Detroit, which is huge. They're one point against the ahead of us on Thursday. And then our last game is against Ottawa on Saturday. All right. So basically the two teams in front of us are, uh, Detroit and Philly both one point ahead of us, I believe. So the great thing is during this week, Detroit and Philly play each other. So no, I think Philly's a few points that had, so I'm just fulfilling to just when the rest of the way out. All right. I, at this point, I have to root against Detroit. I don't have anything against Detroit other than their fucking country fans. And they really are cunty fence. You know what I mean? The funny thing about them is they don't realize that they're run is over and that it's now all about Chicago and La and they're wearing the crown.

Speaker 2:          00:57:47       You know what I mean? For some reason Detroit is still living off fucking Eisenman, you know? I guess they won one last decade to pot. Oh, actually they went to, yeah, but you can just see, you can see it in Detroit. It's over. You know? It's something that I'm going to experience with Brady and Belichick are gone and I'm going to be like, yeah, but we're the patriots. It's like, yeah, but that God, yeah, yeah. They're wearing the same uniform, but it's not the same. I'm fucking with the, I actually love Detroit. I love the franchise. I don't like the fence. Um, you know, and I've never been that way as I like to think with all the success that I only talk shit if people giving me shit. That's how I try to be, you know, I don't try to act like, because my teams are successful.

Speaker 2:          00:58:33       That means somehow in my own personal life, I'm a success. Like some people do those. You know what? I'm really judging all black hawks and red Redwing fence by half a dozen people, which isn't fair. So, you know what, good luck to all of you. And uh, I hope to Bruins fucking pull it out. And if we don't, we got no one to blame but ourselves just fucking good Lord. What a fucking season up, down, up, down, up, down, up, down. That's what the fuck it's been. Now I just need up for the last two or three up just fucking nice. Three game winning streak and no one will remember any of this shit. Dan Shaughnessy is sitting there with the fucking hard on being like, I can finally write an article about hockey that I understand somebody blew it. Oh yeah. I could write this all fucking day.

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       All right, let's get to the questions then. I got to get the fuck Outta here. All right. Um, the all star Cafe, uh, on March 28 podcasts, you briefly mentioned you were regular muncher and Nia was a waitress. The all state, not the all star. Uh, for some reason he wrote all star up here then all state before she got pink slipped and now and now and the now closed down Allstate cafe and the upper west side. I thought your listeners might be intrigued to learn that your meeting place was also a meeting place for a young teacher and her murderer in January of 1973 during a one night stand, murdering a partner guarantees there ain't no second night, right. Jesus Christ. I didn't know that the grotesque multi stabbing crime got so much infamous publicity that the pub changed his name from the Wm tweets to the Allstate.

Speaker 2:          01:00:19       The murderer inspired the book and subsequent movies starring the then scantily clad Diane Keaton also. Apparently Kevin Bacon had ones tended bar there too. I wonder if they fired him also. I didn't know that. Jesus, that's fucking creepy. I don't believe in ghosts or anything like that. Not even remotely, but that type of shit is just scary by the way. I love hearing about history even as much as I fucking that cake walk thing. I was trashing that guy. I like that type of shit. Um, all right, girlfriend bothered and annoyed by sexy TV show character. Uh, dear Billy blank balls.

Speaker 2:          01:01:01       My girlfriend and I were recently watching the new season of daredevil and we're enjoying it. However, one character electra was introduced and uh, she bothered the hell out of my girlfriend for reference. Electra is this character that is sexy, provocative, and an all around Badass Ninja woman. Electra is also like a weird sort of, isn't that that mythology thing? What is the, what is that weird fucking thing isn't sit down with, I'm not even going say it because if I'm wrong, it has to do with some sort of creepy sexual relations within the family, doesn't it? You know, daughter, father and then the other one, his son, mother with a son kills the dad or some shit. It's just fucking weird when I see those types of stories actually start believing in Adam and eve. Yeah, there was just two people and they bagged and then they had this obsessed.

Speaker 2:          01:02:00       She was fucking horseshit for a couple of generations until we fucked ourselves up. Maybe that did up and maybe that's why neanderthals and all like or whatever they are, the original cavemen, their heads are all fucked up. Look, and it's because everyone was related. Um, and who the fuck knows anyways, she was a cool character, but my girlfriend hated her. I noticed that it wasn't anything against the character since she couldn't tell me why she didn't like her other than she just bothers her. Other people have told me that their girlfriends slash wives are the same way with electro when watching this show with their significant other. I know it isn't just this character because any female that is in a sexy, Badass role, I've noticed women specifically, ones with both boyfriends don't like, uh, is this just some kind of insecurity women have? Do they really dislike their boyfriends?

Speaker 2:          01:02:48       Seeing someone that may be sexier than them? Um, well yeah, if you fucking put it that way, they're going to be annoyed. Okay honey, you know, I see that girl. Look how much sexier she is. Then when she watched his fight club, you know, does she say how much fucking much better. Well, Brad Pitt's looking anyways. Are they worried that this fictional TV characters going to steal me away from her? I am wondering if I should say anything because quite frankly, it's starting to get on my nerves. She will root against the character for no reasons besides the ones listed above. Um, I don't know if I would just make her move, make her more pissed off though. Have you ever been in a situation like this? Love the show and as always, go fuck yourself. Here's the thing, one of the worst things you can do when you get into a relationship with a woman is to start having your behavior be dictated by just trying to keep them in a good mood.

Speaker 2:          01:03:47       All right? I'm not saying walk around and be an Asshole, but if you're not being a fucking asshole and they're just being moody, fucking assholes, like you got to call him out on it. Yeah. Like, and, and this is another thing too, you got to treat them like adults rather than treating them like children, which is what a lot of guys do because physically was stronger than them. So you feel like if you say anything to them, it's like you're yelling at a child. You're not. Not only is that an adult and a lot of ways they're more advanced because they can't beat the fuck out of you. They have to go, they have to go with their mental, right. That's why they can just manipulate you like a fucking little puppet there because they can just play Jedi mind games because they, they, they're not going to, they from day one, they're like, all right, this fucking thing is going to be stronger than me at some point.

Speaker 2:          01:04:33       So I need to learn how to control it. Just using my brain. Right. That's how you end. End Up holding fucking yard goes can hook no woman's cells anymore. Right. They barely even cook. So I end up at fucking brunch. This is what you've got to say. Um, you just kind of just hit pause and just, I would just be like, what is your problem with this character? You're ruining the show for me. Okay. If look at, look at daredevil. He's got abs. You see me acting like a fucking baby about this. You know, you don't like the way you look. Go to the gym at the one she'd be inspired by this fuck there. That's, that's what I feel when I, when I watch a superhero movie other I the other, other than like a, when the fuck is his dumb horse, shit. Gonna be over. It always makes me feel like, yeah, I got to hit the gym.

Speaker 2:          01:05:26       I could literally sit there and watch Thor who's probably a foot taller than me, a thousand times better looking than I'm ever going to be. And all that dude does is make me want to go to the gym. But then again, if you look at our roles, like all I need to do is earn enough money where I can get a Ferrari in a toupee and next thing you know, I can bank some whore that's spinning a fucking magazine. And that's basically how it works. If I drive the car in the right part of the world, right? Drive around the fucking French Riviera at Jesus Christ, you have no idea what you're going to be banging. They don't have that option. You know what I mean? They can't be like, well, I'm a six, but you know, if I start making money I can go get myself a Brad Pitt. You can't, Eh, you know what? You can't blame society. You got to blame the good Lord for that one.

Speaker 1:          01:06:14       So maybe that's why. Maybe that's why,

Speaker 2:          01:06:19       cause no matter what she does, she can. I don't know. I don't fucking know. Ask Her, but you know something I wouldn't be on, you know, she's ruined in your show. You got to call her out on it. Um, all right. Okay. Going bald. Dear Billy bald cap. I'm 24 and I'm going bald. This runs in my family is both my grandfathers were bald so I don't have any sort of identity crisis about it and in fact I'm leaning into it and we'll joke about it when appropriate. My question to you is, when do I finally start buzzing, buzzing everything away? The last thing I want to do is rocket George [inaudible] kid cause stands a look. But we'd like to have a full head of hair while I can before I look like I'm in denial. No comb overs for this cut. My hair is thin but still covers everything on top though. My Barbara did crack more jokes than usual at my last, at my expense. Last time I went to get a cut. No, I didn't provide a picture because this isn't a fucking roguey commercial. Given your experience. I love to hear your input on what, when you pulled the trigger to buzzard all, all the way and possibly the input of the lovely Nia. What? Jesus Christ. What am I? You're fucking stylist.

Speaker 2:          01:07:29       Well, I think you know something. If your barber starts making jokes, you know what I mean? I feel like there's not enough time left on the clock for you to make a comeback. That's basically like now you line it up and the dude across to you is talking shit about how they're moving on to the next round of the playoffs and you're not. So it sounds like it's already over,

Speaker 1:          01:07:49       you know?

Speaker 2:          01:07:51       I don't know, Dude, why? What am I, what kind of a fucking man asks another man a question like this? Just fucking, you know, shave your fucking head or go get a hair plugs or put Rogaine on it, or raw diet at different fucking cover. I'll give a fuck what you do with it. What is my experience? My experience was when I was just sick of it, I was sick of the slow and I was just like, you know what? Let's just put this thing out of its misery.

Speaker 1:          01:08:23       MMM.

Speaker 2:          01:08:25       And I gotta tell you, it's not nearly as bad as everybody fucking thanks. Who's kidding? Who? Everybody would love to have a full head of hair, but you know something. I gotta be honest with you. Once you start buzzing your head, it's kind of fucking awesome. You know what is great about having a shaved head? You're always ready to go. I got to tell you, as much as I would love to still have a full head of hair, I love the fact that I'm always ready to go. All I gotta do is throw a shirt on, splash a little water on my face, and you have no fucking idea that I was laying in my sweatpants five minutes earlier. Oh. Speaking of which, I'm just kidding. I always make sure I get ready, you know?

Speaker 1:          01:09:04       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:09:05       There was this fucking person, you know, I went out, you know, I took some pictures with people after the show and uh,

Speaker 1:          01:09:11       yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:09:14       these fucking people that have like, this fucking guy comes up, I can already smell them. All right? And then he goes to put his arm around me during the fucking picture and I'm telling you like literally could make paneer peel off the fucking walls was how bad this guy's body odor was. And he's with other people and they don't smell. It's like, why don't you say something to them? Because I'm not going to say it.

Speaker 1:          01:09:41       Okay,

Speaker 2:          01:09:42       you paid money to see me, right? I gave you a show and then I come out there and take a picture and then I tell you, you smell bad. I wouldn't do that to somebody, but Jesus fucking Christ. He was fucking hilarious about this person too. I kept running into him.

Speaker 1:          01:09:57       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:09:57       And then this person just loved to tell a story that somehow involved, you know, lifting his arms up past his fucking shoulders. Jesus. Fuck man. I never noticed how much you lift your arms during telling a story until I ran into this, this guy fucking reeked fucking rate, just completely fucking unacceptable. Well into his fucking twenties and he's standing, he's got a couple of friends with them who don't reek.

Speaker 1:          01:10:23       Okay?

Speaker 2:          01:10:24       Oh my God. You know, wish I bad. I wish I had one of those old school fucking, you know, the spray on deodorant. And as he was telling this story, I'd be like yeah, and just holding my nose and I would just spray under one arm pit. No, keeps telling this story, this spraying under the other one. And then I just hand them the can't do the math there. Fuck. Oh, alright. Psycho girlfriend.

Speaker 1:          01:10:46       Um, all right. Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:10:49       Psycho girlfriend. Uh, where am I? Okay. So my girlfriend and I had been together for about five years and lately I've been feeling the get engaged pressure from her family. Well, yeah, I'm 23 and she's 21. All right, let me rephrase that. Well, now, um, I thought you guys were older. Uh, we've been together since high school and I haven't experienced much else besides, of course, the young middle school, tug job girlfriends, I'm afraid of Sunday regretting missing out on meeting a ton of different girls. Like all my buddies have been, I mean, you're only young once, right? My girlfriend flips out on me about watching porn because I'm thinking about other girls and she acts like I'm cheating on her and half the time when we're out she thinks I'm checking out other girls. Cause you probably are dude, because you want to cause you want to break up with her.

Speaker 2:          01:11:39       That's what I'm guessing. She's a drop dead gorgeous girl so I don't get what she's so insecure about. But like I said, she's crazy. She gets abusive with me and I just kind of sit there and take it all the time. Um, she's Latina by the way. Honduran and Nicaraguan. She's got that wild temper. Um, all right. I was that considered racist to say that Latina chicks are a little crazier than, than what? Unlike what pasty drunken Irish chicks. Oh yeah. They're always so even killed what I asked for space. I woke up the next day and my car was keyed.

Speaker 1:          01:12:19       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:12:20       She claims she had nothing to do with it. I love the girl. She's all I've ever known and she's amazing most of the time. But I'm not sure if I can live like this forever with their temporary jealousy. What would you do anyways? Love the podcast. Thanks for the advice and go fuck yourself. P s good luck with the home gym. Everybody knows.

Speaker 1:          01:12:39       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:12:39       you got no business in irregularly. I'll go fuck yourself. I can not put us in a regular gym. Oh, when you do what? You're sitting here and you're a fucking God. Damn. You know something? I actually had fucking,

Speaker 1:          01:12:51       yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:12:52       I actually had sympathy for it. I was going to give you some good advice. You know what? Go Fuck Yourself. You know what your problem is in this thing. You know, you, you're just, it allowed it. You're young. I'm not going to be a dick to you. Okay? Cause you're young. This is the deal. All right? You got yourself a hot girl. All right. And you did not have set up the relationship. She fucking rolled all over yet. You're asking what I do in your situation. If I was 23, I'd be doing what you were doing. I'd be staying in the relationship, wanting to get out, um, and dealing with this bullshit. But I can tell you this right now. Her looks aren't always going to be there, but she's always going to have keys. You know what I mean? So that's what you're signing up for. The looks go out the fucking window. You're marrying the fucking person that this fucking lunatic. Every time, you know, if, God forbid, your mailman is a fucking woman who's younger than her at that point, you know, I th I don't know. I don't know. I can do it was too wishy washy. I can't tell whether you fucking want to be in it or not, but I can tell you this right now. Um, any woman keys your car, that's it. It's fucking over.

Speaker 2:          01:14:04       Okay. That is a, the level of being a complete fucking psycho. A complete disrespect for your own property and assign that when she was a child, she was never told no. The fact that you would go out and do something like that. Yeah, I dunno. It sounds to me like you want to go fucking get some notches on your belt and you're afraid that if you do and you break up with this girl that she's going to fucking stab you. Um,

Speaker 1:          01:14:31       yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:14:32       I dunno. I got claustrophobic reading it if that means anything, but I'm a fucking lunatic. Right? Sketchy ex-girlfriend. Hey you cunty Leprechaun. Jason. Everybody's staring into the red hat shit this week. Every once in a while I got to give you guys shit to get. Can you be a little more original? I liked that Billy blank ball. That was fucking funny. 58 fucking, you know, fucking red head shops in a row, but I get it. You know, I get it. You don't have an hour's time. You can do a 10 minutes. Set your a showcase comic. Um, all right. Hey, you cut g leprechaun. I am 16 years old and my girlfriend is 15 today. She texted me, she texted me with a picture of a tattoo asking if I like it. It is what it is. The date of her grandfather's death. Personally, I hate tattoos and thanks. If she keeps getting them, she will look like a fucking phone book. I also think her mother is irresponsible, spelled with a bunch of ease. He responsible for letting her get a tattoo spelled with one ho. So young. What are your thoughts about this and how, how, uh,

Speaker 2:          01:15:50       what's your thoughts about this and how she didn't tell me till after she got it. Thank you. I love your shows and your podcast. Um, yeah. All right. She's 15 she already got her first tattoo, which you got to do is close your eyes and age or when is she getting the face tattoo and the nose ring and the fucking Olympic fucking rings in our ears to be different. Um, yeah, I, I'm not into tattoos. You know, I think a certain type of person can pull it off. Um, and that's not 98% of the population, but 98% of the population for some reason has tattoos. Now I don't get it. I feel like there's a certain level bad ass dude in a certain level, bad ass chick that gets tattoos. And when you meet him it makes sense in it actually, you know, I dunno if I see a woman and she's a bad ass and she has tattoos, it actually makes them more attractive to me if she's just some fucking dope, you know? And she has like some advice column tattooed on the back of her fucking neck or some Chinese sign above her ass crack, you know, symbol then yeah, it's just like Jesus Christ. You know, like the amount of people out there that sleeves

Speaker 2:          01:17:11       like back in the day when you got a sleeve, I mean you were like some biker outlaw,

Speaker 2:          01:17:18       you know. Now it's like you work at urban outfitters, you know the biggest, baddest thing about you is your fucking music selection on your fucking iPhone. I have no idea. All I know is I got to get a rental car in 10 minutes. If I don't, I'm going to be late to my show. So this is the podcast for this week, the Monday morning podcast. God bless all of you. I love when you guys trashed me in the fucking emails, but yeah. Can we, can we just keep, can you keep it interesting for the reader here? I know I'm a red head. I know the reason he jokes, but come on. What if I did that with my standup act? Get Out, which had come out and see me if I was out there. Go on. Watch to deal with New Yorker. No. Um, all right. Go Fuck Yourself. I'll check in on you on Thursday.
