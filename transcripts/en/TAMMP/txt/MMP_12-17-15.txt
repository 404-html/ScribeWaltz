Speaker 1:          00:00:13       in on Ya. How are Ya? What's going on? Oh Shit. It's the day before the fucking space movie comes out, but about 35 so fucking religion out there, right? Keep in mind dad, Obi wan Kenobi has died for us and he's using the force. You he had that dirty robe. Maybe that's why he got sliced in half. Um, all right, so I have, I have a little cartoon coming out called emphasis for family tomorrow. I know it's not the big space movie that everybody wants to see, you know with r two d two and c three Po and that fucking green thing that got shot in the bar way back in the day. Bob Power bar. But was I was the evil one goal as the evil song go

Speaker 1:          00:01:21       fucking same goddamn movie. Why are you guys going to see that when you don't know what's going to happen and after it's for family, you know what's going to happen in Star Wars? Good is going to try him over evil, doesn't it always except for that one. You know where they ran around on those mechanical fucking lamas, whatever the hell the word, the ad ads. I know all this shit cause one of my brothers, he had all the fucking action figures, you know, I remember that Shit. You know, I just, you know, I talked about uncommon and I just missed out. I didn't see it at the right age. And then when I saw it I was like, you know, the hype was just so fucking big and I was just like, this was what, this was the big deal. This is the big that I thought the first one was boring and then the next one I loved.

Speaker 1:          00:02:05       I liked the one that fucking dude cut to go it go with the blackout. Darth Vader. Darth. Yeah, they Veda Joe. Okay. Yeah. About Daniel fucking guy moved into the neighborhood. Fucking Darth Vader. Dude. It's fucking ride is kid. Um, yeah, he cut off Luke Skywalker's hand in that air conditioning shaft, whatever it was. None of it's explained by the way. It's just all spacey looking shit. You know what I mean? A bill. You're a grumpy con. Why can't you let people enjoy it? You know they like it. You know what? You're right. You're right. I wish I cared. I wish I was in. I like Scifi. Hey, I like Scifi. Why can't I come along? Um, that'd be a great youtube video. Just have people driving by just heckling people in the lines. Don't do that. Please don't do that. Those people in that line, they've been through enough. You know what I mean? I think the people who are into star wars, but they've been through enough, maybe not the younger ones. Maybe then we can give shit to because they haven't been bullied cause it's been like outlawed right now. Bullying.

Speaker 1:          00:03:15       How the fuck is this generation going to produce another generation of great comedians if nobody got their heads stuffed into a toilet? I mean, it's just, it's a fucking shame, you know, for as much as people shit on bullies, they're really the reason for some of the great musicians, comedians and all that. They channel all that pain and humiliation to the tone in their guitar, right when they get through it. But the silliness, you know what I mean? Learning how to fucking who new toilet water would make your cowlick finally laid down. Who knew that, you know, get jokes out of it. Nothing. He's Auntie Star Wars. He's pro bullying. This isn't what I signed up for. Um, Sony was, so I'm done. I'm done with my press. Uh, I had a great time on found that I did Conan. I did like a fucking thousand goddamn radio things and print things and all of that.

Speaker 1:          00:04:06       And uh, the cartoon finally comes out tomorrow to go see star wars. I'm just fucking with you guys, man. It's just fun to shit on something that everybody's into. They have so fucking good movies. What? They're there for the kids, right. You know what I mean? If the kids, please tell me that for the kids, please tell me you're not sitting there with nobody in your life with a bunch of stuffed animals. He walks on some manmade shelf. I guess they're all manmade but homemade, you know, a little fucking two by six right above your head with your action figures still in the box. So they're worth more money. But you know, you're never going to sell them, but you can't get yourself to open them up. Why don't you take it out, you know, do your little Chewbacca impression. Oh, it was it Yoda.

Speaker 2:          00:04:52       Huh?

Speaker 1:          00:04:54       That fucking weird way. I knew my boy. He talks, you know at the desk you must sit. What are the fucking dies? Oh my God. What an annoying little green can't. Yeah, you can't hate Yoda. You know what you could, if your drove cross country, he'd have to do some gen I shit like every half a state before he just like toad. You either need to do some magic stuff where you have to stop talking. Okay. Because, uh, my fucking brain, you're hurting or whatever the fuck you say to him. Oh, you know, you'd be annoying. Just start imitating them. Roof really get Douche. Um, no, what's wrong with me? You know what's wrong with me is, uh, I, I need to just fucking chill out and I can't, I got two shows tonight cause I gotta get ready for my new year's show here in la at the Orpheum.

Speaker 1:          00:05:42       Who's going to be on the show? Got Damn at the four horsemen are coming into town. Well I guess I'm already here. So three of them. Uh, well I had lived out here to open up Bart next out here. One of them is coming to town. Sorry, I just totally blew that out there. One of them is coming to town. I'm usually good about pulling the microwave. One of them's is to town and the other three are already here. All right. God, God, go that. That's the magnificent seven bill. You need three more writers. Uh, it's going to be me lot head Barnett. Can Paul Versey at the Orpheum, the legendary Orpheum downtown downtown la first shows at seven 15. For whatever fucking reason. I don't know why it's not seven or seven 30. It's seven 15. Everybody just to make sure you're paying attention. And then the, uh, the other one is at 10 o'clock.

Speaker 1:          00:06:32       All right. Two fabulous shows. So last night we had the premiere for F is for family. And uh, I told the lovely Nia that I was going to, you know, go up there with the Great Mike Price from the Simpsons co creator of the show. We were going to thank everybody for coming out. And the second I thanked everybody, I was immediately going to walk right out the movie theater because I did not want to sit there. You know, watching people watch it because that's just, I can't describe that feeling after years of being a comedian where you can adjust, you know, if it's going bad, you can speed up, you can slow down, you can do this, you can do that. The fucking, you know, TV show is locked. It's done, it starts bombing. All you can do is just sit there and I also want to have it.

Speaker 1:          00:07:18       So that was my game plan. I thanked everybody and then I started to walk out the theater and I just felt everyone was looking at me and I'm like, that's not good. Everyone's going to think he doesn't like his own show. So I just walked in and I just sat down in the nearest empty seat, which was it next to my wife. I just sat there and within three seconds of watching it, I was like, why the fuck did I do this? And they played three episodes. Fortunately people were laughing, but um, yeah, I sat there squirming for a, a good fucking or whatever, however long it took, 90 minutes to watch. But fortunately everybody loved it. Everybody can relate all different ages and that type of shit. So I'm hoping you're going to like it there. I'm done. I've done promoting it. Um, why do you feel guilty promoting your own projects? You know, you deserve it and it's your podcast. You should have the right to talk about whatever you want. Um, is that what Yoda would say? But in that douchey voice, but why do I attack star was what, every time it comes out, I just can't handle the fact.

Speaker 3:          00:08:24       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:24       I do the same thing. You know, there's a, there's a lot of shit that everybody likes it. I don't like it. And maybe I should just be like, you know what bill, maybe, uh, maybe have to lighten up it a little bit, you know?

Speaker 3:          00:08:35       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:36       No, you know what I mean? You bought, why don't you just let people like what the fuck they like. I like Scifi that, that fucking Sam Rockwell movie moon. Did you guys see that? I liked that one. I like Stanley Kubrick space. 1990 now. The fuck was it called last computer on ours. I'm sorry Brian. I can't do or whether the fuck he used to say 2001, a space odyssey. I liked that movie Mo. Uh, so say Moonraker that was struck in James Bond when he was in the space shuttle. That wasn't it. Blade runner. I liked that one. I like those ones set in the future where everybody lost their rights and we're out of fucking natural resources. Those are the ones I like, you know, and then they got to fight back against, oh fuck. Am I explaining it? I think I'm describing star wars, I guess it says self help. I don't know what it is.

Speaker 1:          00:09:31       All right. You know what I'll say. You know what? It's too nice there. That's what it is. It's just too fucking nice. You know what I mean? Like they got a couple of malls out here in la. They both called the grove. You then you go down there, right? And it's all brand new and they got this stupid fucking trolley going down the center, right. Making it look like it's this old style town. And you know, it only runs like a hundred yards and then it just turns around again. But when you're in the middle of this mall, you know, and that plane, Sinatra and Tony Bennett, if I ruled the world every day would be the first day of spring and you fuck, you're walking around, there's a trolley, you fail, you get a little spring in your step and then it hits you. Like, dude, I'm going into the gap.

Speaker 4:          00:10:22       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:23       Uh, buying a bunch of Shit I don't need, what am I doing here? They create this whole fucking atmosphere that's so fucking nice. It uh, oh, it drives me up the wall. I got to come with something positive. You know what the most positive thing I saw this this past week was I saw, um, I saw these kids playing two on two football in a basketball court at a, when I was in New York that time when I had the fight with the person at the gym. So I went to that outdoor place. You could do pull ups and uh, I dunno, he just never see that. You never see it anymore. Which kids did that more, you know, I wish kids weren't so fat. I wish they'd go outside the house, you know, but you can't let them out of the house now. Right. Everybody is a fucking pervert by having every fucking tree.

Speaker 1:          00:11:13       You know, they should give kids guts. Yeah, just hear me. I said give, if you give kids guns, just somebody goes to snatch your beak. It just fucking pull his gun out, blow the guy's braids out. And then if they shot each other, as sad as that would be, it would probably, it would definitely obviously help the population problem. You know what I mean? Cause one of them would be dead and the other one would be going to jail. That will be FBI would just sticky when this place, you know, you like leaning it stabbed.

Speaker 1:          00:11:44       That's weird, right? It's desperate times. You know, someone's trying to tell me to watch something that was trying to say that fucking Miami is going to be like finished in 10 years. Miami, New Orleans, all of these fucking places. And I was just like, dude, I don't, I don't want to hear that. You know, I'm, I'm going to be one of those guys. They're going to figure something out. I think everybody's saying that all the way up to the top. Um, so anyways, hey, I'll put my bro, it's, they've been winning lately and I had been so busy, I haven't watched last night I watched the uh, the second period and uh, just long enough to watch McQuade take a puck to the fucking mouth. I don't remember if you've never played hockey. I took one time, but just once. Okay. I'm played a lot of hockey in my life.

Speaker 1:          00:12:33       Just one fucking time. One fucking time. I took a risk off my big fucking toe. All right. Just some fucking novice guy. We were in Canada, so it's probably a better wrist shot than I would have run into down here. I took it right off the firewall, you know, I wasn't doing anything in the game so I wanted to do something productive for my team. I was like a minus 53 minutes into play and pick up hockey and a I. For some reason I decided to block a shot in a, in a pickup game when I had a standup gigs at night. It hit right off the inside of my, the arch in my foot, in my fucking toe. I felt like I got shot in the foot and it didn't even hit me that hard. This guy took a professional fucking thank God it wasn't a slap shot.

Speaker 1:          00:13:16       It was, I think it was a wrist or took, he wa he fucking turned around to see what was up, like where were the puck was and it was like right there. It's like when Tom Brady throws to pass, you know, before you even turn, the ball's already come and you're like, oh shit. Right. If you've got like me, you break your finger cause you didn't, you didn't open them wide enough, quick enough. Right. Um, took it right in the fucking mouth. That's it. And he's rolling around on the ice and he announced, he's just like, well fortunately you don't need teeth to play hockey. Now was it, could you imagine if a soccer player took a fucking puck to the mouth, he'd still be lying there. He will be riding in the stands. They had tear gas and all that type of shit. Um, but anyways, I am completely out of the loop with that is one of my random picks for this week.

Speaker 1:          00:14:07       All right. If you're a gambling man, if you're going on that draft king, so that whatever, if you go in old school and you're actually betting a team rather than players, you know, um, I like the giants this weekend. How do you know how many, I don't even know how many fucking points to get. I don't even, I don't even know how many. Let me see how many fucking points again, they're playing the fucking panthers. So I think everybody's going to be like, all right, the panthers are going to fucking kill him. They're going to give the giants all these fucking points cause everybody's gonna bet the panthers. You're going to get all these extra points and I'm telling you, fucking Odell Beckham and Eli are going to be enough, even though the giants have no defense. Let me see. Right? That giants, panthers bedding lie. Oh, spread when I used to that. That's easier. Huh? Though? What's the fucking spread? I launched last week too, but lifetime. Lifetime. I'm up like 660 bucks on the book, right? Isn't that what all your friends say? Nobody's ever, he admits. Nobody knows what the fuck they figure is. The second you gambled for more than three weeks, you have no idea.

Speaker 2:          00:15:12       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:15:12       dude, lifetime. Maybe I'm the giants. Panthers, odds to giants have a chance against unbeaten. Carolina. Uh, let's see here. Just give me the fucking line. I hate this new era. I really do. Draftkings they have all kinds of fucking shit wasn't eighth I was going to bet on, you know, Odell Beckham, just him odds point spread week 15. All right. The weekly odds, where is it? Where is it? Line Carolina minus four. That's it. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:15:45       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:15:47       What the fuck is that game under rovers 49.

Speaker 1:          00:15:56       All right. You know what? Fuck that I wanted eight gimme a fucking points. I'd Bet Carolina. What's the Games in New York? You know, Bill, he kind of helps you fucking looked it up before you got involved in this, wouldn't it? What have helped. I don't give a shit. All right. Anyways, let's, let's plow ahead here. So I gotta get my shit together, man. I have, I have not been working out and uh, but I've been kind of maintaining and I also haven't been doing that much standup cause I've been promoting this show and I got to get my fucking ass ready for this, uh, for this New Year's Eve shelf. Um, and that starts tonight. If you're in La, I'll be done the laugh factory and I'll be uh, at the comedy store, although by the time they post this to chose a, probably already have happened. So that didn't make any sense. Did it? All right. I don't know where this is going. Hang on a second. Let me, let me look up some shit, man. Give me something. Give me something to talk about here. Right. You don't, what if you noticed lately I've had to hit the pause button a lot. I think. I think I'm coming to the end of this podcast or at the very least, at some point I'm going to have to have a fucking guest. Right,

Speaker 2:          00:17:04       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:05       I mean, after a while you just see, I mean, when it gets to the point you're making pie crust videos, I'm pretty much at the end of my rope here. People telling me told you should make some more fucking videos. It's like there's nothing else that I kind of know how to make that interesting, I don't think.

Speaker 2:          00:17:18       Right.

Speaker 1:          00:17:20       I Dunno. I have no idea. We're finally getting the fucking my house fixed up on the outside. You know, the gates and everything were falling down. It's never ending. It's never ending. I think when I get that fixed, then I got to move on to the garage, that hunk of Shit, I'm never going to get my money back. And I'm just doing this stubborn German Irish shtick that I don't give a fuck and I'm doing everything first class. I don't give a fuck. Well, we could use this PC shit. Uh, we could use this one that's decent or we could use the tub

Speaker 2:          00:17:52       top of the line.

Speaker 1:          00:17:56       I'm like fucking John Bender. You know when, when the press and breakfast club, when he's going, I got you to Saturday. She wanted another one. He's like, yes, that's Drake. Good as with the construction people are doing. Yeah. You know, uh, we, we, we found another fucking problem. It's going to cost another three grand.

Speaker 2:          00:18:20       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:18:21       You want another, I'll keep digging. I'll keep looking in your fucking walls. The is really no sympathy here, man. This is my own God damn fault for buying a 90 something year old to a hundred. Yeah. 92 year old house. It's my own fucking fault. Um, and I have to be honest with you, I think I'm over old shit. I think I'm over it. Like the next house I buy is going to be totally fucking modern. Brand new, you know, just conk fucking two, three concrete slabs. Looked like a parking garage. Now just build some walls around it. Everything's going to be brand fucking new and up to code. I've uh, I, I've just, I've had it, I've had it every motherfucking thing cause you know what it is about this house is it's settled to over the last 90 something years, right? So everything's fucking cockeyed and twist it and all that type of shit.

Speaker 1:          00:19:18       So when they go to fix something, they always go, well, you know, this isn't really square and it's going to look dumb. So I got a square it up. So I go, hey, square it up. You know, go ahead and square it up enough. I just come walking out, you know, at this point, anytime anyone he could structure and talks to me, I immediately decided my eyes are squinting. I got my fucking eyebrow furrowed. Like, just, you know, I'm doing that. Come on, come on, come on. Just tell me how much it's going to be. Wait, where do I sign? Yeah, go ahead. Don't give a fuck. I'll be on the road forever. Don't mind me. Don't mind me. I'm just a guy just to guide, pay in for it. Um, but seriously, eventually I have to do, uh, you know, I got to Redo my fucking piece of shit.

Speaker 1:          00:20:01       Fucking do it yourself. Tree fort of a garage and um, I got a slip that one by the wife, you know, they're all about the shit that's in their world, you know what I mean? But the garage, which is funny, which is where most, you know, most guys who live with women, you end up in the garage. So when you say you want to do something to the garage, like your wife is just, I don't understand what he's talking about. His stick around and faces the garage. Anyway, I just, I just feel like, I feel like that's the place where we just drop shit off. You know? I would eventually like to do a, put a little bit of a gym in there. That's what I should, if I just had some fucking here, but I heard this fucking, those, those treadmills, it's like running like 15 refrigerators at the same time.

Speaker 1:          00:20:55       So when I'm thinking of doing here me out, this is my plan, redoing the garage and on top of you make it solar powered so it's just completely off the fucking grid. Right. And then I can maybe guilt free, have some sort of fucking elliptical assumption that would tell you the time when I was living with Bobby Kelly, Robert Kelly from uh, um Oh sex and drugs and rock and roll a right. He plays the drummer. We used to live together and he was such a pack rat. He used to just bring shit in off of the fucking street. And I remember one time I was kind of living back and forth between La and New York and I came back from La, it's like the late nineties and he had taken from off the street the most boot leg fucking stairmaster I'd ever seen in my life. I swear to God it was made out of like, I don't even know what I mean.

Speaker 1:          00:21:51       It was whatever the material was, it just qualified to be metal. I remember it was white with these red stripes and you got on the fucking thing and it had this little digital clock and you'd start going on it. And as you held the handles, like any sort of body weight with like sort of the whole thing, fucking moved like the frame that it was on. And I remember he got it and he stuffed it over in the corner and I just went like, I was like, Bobby, what the fuck is that? He was like, dude, wait, talking about dude, you're fucking to stem as to, I got it off the sidewalk. I got it for free. Do you want to use it? It's like, no, dude, I'll go to the gym. Fucking Jim's like 15 bucks a month. It gives a shit. So, uh, I remember watching him using it one time and I was laughing my balls off because he weighed like, and um, he wasn't, you know, the size he is now.

Speaker 1:          00:22:45       I'm not trying to make fun of him here. He just was, he was 10 times the size of the thing. It looked like it was built for an eight year old and he was over in the corner and it's a little ass fucking liver numbers. I'm trying to watch this little kitchen TV that we had that was sitting on this TV VCR. Oh my God. TV, VCR Stan that I made in wood class, like my junior or senior year in high school that I gave to my dad and he was supposed to put the TV on top of it and then underneath it was the VCR and then it had to drug doors that opened on the bottom like cabinets and in there you put all your VHS tapes. My Dad took the fucking, I gave it to him. He took the back off the thing and he stuck the TV underneath it.

Speaker 1:          00:23:31       It was so stupid. Yet a lay on the Florida fucking watch it. Who's classic? My Dad like he's just, I guess I'm like Kim, like I just see shit. I don't see it for what it is. And then people look at me like, dude, the fuck is run. That same way that when I stand in front of a stage, a stage, a stove, and it says turn on the front burner. To me it's, it's what everybody else considers the backburner. Because the way I look at the stove is it's like I'm standing behind a car. I don't know why.

Speaker 4:          00:24:00       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:24:00       Did I just look at it like, I don't know. Maybe it's my low self esteem. Like I'm standing in the back of the line. So the front of the lines guy, I have no fucking idea. So he took the back off it and shoved the TV under there and a, I remember all my friends who also took shop class when they would come over my house like years later drink and they'd be like, to, what the fuck is a TV? And I was like, dude, don't even, I don't even want to tell you I met with my dad, took the back off, he ripped the shelf out. He just stuck the TV down there and they were laughing. They thought it was the funniest fucking thing. Ever Day one, here you go, dad, you know, merry Christmas or whatever. And Yeah, just fucking, he modified it. So anyway, so I, yeah, when I moved out I got it back minus the back or the shelf and I finally, I remember it was a proud moment that I put this little piece of shit TV on top of it, so that things sitting on top, we got a VCR underneath it and then a bunch of fucking tapes and shit like water boy and all that stuff that was fucking was coming out in the late nineties.

Speaker 1:          00:25:00       And, uh, we had all these Adam Sandler movies and all this shit that was in there. So I'm sitting down, oh my God, it's spring break. We, I had a fucking couch and uh, and uh, like a lazy boy that, but it didn't recline that

Speaker 4:          00:25:15       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:25:15       Was From my dad's dental office from the early seventies. So it had this horrific floral pattern and it was made out of this wood that weighed like 9 million. It took like 10 guys to pick up the fucking sofa and of course it was busted. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:25:31       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:25:32       So I'm sitting there, right. And I'm, I'm in the fucking lazy boy that doesn't recline. And Bobby's over in the corner on this fucking hunk of shit. Stair master. I'm trying to watch TV and he's over in the corner. Go ahead. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fucking sweating and shit. And I'm laughing at my balls off. He's to fuck you. Stop making me laugh. Did Right. He's, he's trying to go on this thing and uh,

Speaker 4:          00:25:57       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:25:58       Oh, is this the day? I may be. I may be combining days. I just remember going into the bathroom and as I was in the bathroom, you walked out like the giant, Ooh, this big living room. You, he was a railroad apartment, right? So you walked to the right, he's in the back left of the room. I walked to the right and then immediately make a right into the bathroom. So it's like a fucking hairpin turn. So I go in and take a piss and as I come walking out, Bobby get picked up a racket ball and threw it as hard as he could.

Speaker 4:          00:26:31       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:26:32       To hit the wall. It Rekesh. It was a perfect shot. Records, she couldn't even see me ricocheted off the wall, came right in and hit me right in the mouth and like split my lip a little bit, my lip. And I remember I had an audition to do Conan O'Brien that night at the fucking, uh, at the comic strip

Speaker 1:          00:26:54       and I was so fucking mad at him and he was dying laughing. Cause see what it was like a one in a million shot. It was literally like Larry Bird, you know, off the fucking camper off the house, Blah Blah, blah. Nothing but net. Like he couldn't even see me. He was on this fucking piece of shit. Stair mastery farm from an off to Simon and he fucking just fire this thing hit me right in the God damn mouth. So I just sit there and put pressure on it. And he kept saying he was sorry, but I knew he wasn't. And uh, then I had to get them back and that's what it was like living with him. Ah Fuck Man. I don't know how it came up with that. And that was a long, long, long ass time where I moved into the end of that place in 1995 and I moved out, I want to say in 2000, um, this fucking railroad apartment. And I had a walkthrough bedroom and this little single mattress bed mattress fucking thing, just sitting on a frame. And I remember my roommate, this Nigerian dude who was into the Rangers, played hockey and all that shit. He, uh, he had to walk through our, like my bedroom to get either to

Speaker 4:          00:28:15       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:28:15       his bedroom or to go into the basic railroad apartment means it's just side by side. So when his bedroom and then my little half a bedroom and then the living room, then there was a little hallway with the bathroom and then the kitchen and it was all just lined right up, like, uh, people standing in line for some coffee or some shit. So he had to walk through my bedroom. So obviously, um, there was a tremendous lack of fucking privacy and I remember living there. And then when I, I started living in La, I like sublet it out to Bobby. And then the roommate was cool to let me come back when I was in New York to crash. They for like a week or so, we were all young guys. We didn't give a fuck, right. So it was fine. And um, I remember after a while, a couple of years of being there, I remember Bobby telling me going like, dude, we'll be talking about getting them an apartment. Like, do we should just get an apartment. I can't fucking do this anymore. I can't live like this anymore. We living like, fuck, we will live in like animals. And uh,

Speaker 4:          00:29:18       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:29:18       I remember Bobby just go, dude, I just want a door. I just want a door to a room that's mine that I can close. And uh, and I remember just sitting like, oh my God, that'd be unbelievable. Like that was the big, that was the big fantasy back then to just have a fucking door that you could close. MMM.

So anyways, there was this adorable woman next to me and uh, she was from Australia, had the little fucking accent and all that type of shit. So what have long story short, we've taken off from JFK and one of the runways shut down.

Speaker 5:          00:35:38       So it's taken for fucking ever write a couple of people on the plane or in wheelchairs. So that takes more time. You know, you prefer bial fat fucks, you know, the whole deal. So, uh, we take off like an hour and a half late. Is it just the whole fucking thing. The bedtime, we land, we land, there's no gate. And then we got to sit there and wait to get towed into the whole thing is taking forever and sheets does this shit was, she just goes, she says, she goes as is everything in America slow, you know, so I let it slide and then the plane lands and we're all trying to see who won the Celtics and the Lakers cause we all miss the fucking game. Thank God ESPN showed the replay. I caught the second half and it goes around the plane, like wildfire fire, you know the Celtics won, Celtics won and this girl Maya, we're always joking about how much people gives a shit. And then this girl makes comics something that, you know, Americans fucking Blah, blah blah blah. And it's just like, you know what, I let it slide with the first fucking war, but it's just really like, they always talk about the ignorant American. What kind of a fucking asshole comes here from another country and shits on the country to somebody who's from this country.

Speaker 5:          00:36:45       When I was over in England, I didn't walk around saying the English people how fucking awful their torsos where I didn't do that. They said I enjoyed England. I'm like, it's fucking great. I can't believe I'm over here. Royal Albert Hall. It's beautiful. I can't wait to come over here again. Phenomenal fucking city. I didn't say your food sucks. You guys all have will. Pharrel mushy. Torsos I didn't say any of that shit. I didn't talk about your teeth being fucked up. I didn't talk about the weird inbred look because you've all been fucking each other and the same God damn strip of land for fucking thousands of years. I didn't do that shit. I was on my best behavior and here I am sitting next to this fucking clam who's everything in America slow as opposed to what? That beacon of speed that fucking Australia is fucking people. You know, I went to Australia, I was there for like three days. I had a good time down there, but you know, I could've picked that place apart. All the unemployed people just sitting in bars drinking.

Speaker 4:          00:37:46       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:37:48       I fucking hate, you know, same fucking cunts. Same Goddamn just cuts. That's all it is. Everybody taking pot shots in America now. That's what it is because we've been on top and we'd been exploiting their labor and I guess maybe that's maybe we deserve a little bit of that shit, but you know what to look in the fucking mirror Australia or a woman from Australia.

Speaker 4:          00:38:08       Yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:38:09       the fuck I went there. I wasn't so like, wow, like I was going into the future.

Speaker 5:          00:38:15       Can I have a ham and then the fucking sandwiches right in my hand before I even finish it. I didn't find them to be overly fast over there either. You wait, you fucking wait. You think it's not coming your way? Our corporations are just ahead of the curve of where where your corporations are. Are corporations have basically every last legal way that they can make more fucking money over here, so now they're just stealing. They're just stealing and they're cut and fucking staff members. I actually had to wait like a half hour, 40 minutes to get my bag last night. I think it was that Sunday thing. Once again, it's Sunday, it's Sunday. So we just have like a skeleton crew. I Dunno all I'm saying, you know,

Speaker 5:          00:39:02       it's just bugging me. It's like, do you think I know that that shit isn't a little fucked up over here? Do I need you to come over here? I would never be in Australia and go like, yeah, Australians to another fucking Australian. You know, that's the type of shit I should felt like fucking stuffing her in a god damned boogie board bag. Boogie board bag. What did I pick that? Because I saw that documentary of that stupid fuck from Australia who put 200 pounds of fucking weed into a boogie board bag. Right alliteration for you and then goes to like Bali, you know with even have cold medication, they hang you by your balls in the public square and she gets life in prison. Well that's what you get. You dumped. Fuck. That's what you get. That's one of my theknot fuck Australia. That's how it works. You see? And that's how it works right there. There's a lot of people in Australia right now, maybe listen to the shit gone. You know, I would never say that. I would never do that if I went. Yeah, well one he did. So there you go. Do you think Germany likes to be judged by Hitler alone? They don't. I bet there's a lot of sweethearts over in Germany.

Speaker 5:          00:40:07       Look at all those fucking fat jolly people during October fest running around, dressed like they're in Hansel and Gretel, you know, shitting on each other. Whatever weird fetishes they're into over there.

Speaker 2:          00:40:27       [inaudible] I've started their season at zero and zero

Speaker 5:          00:41:10       with the holy as amped up the kick the shit out of them as people were amped up to beat the fucking patriots it by mid November. All right, and I'm telling you right now, they are going to have a mediocre fucking season. I think it's going to start off with the loss tonight. I'm not saying that they're not going to go nine and seven, but these guys, I don't know what their fucking problem is and not to mention that now they have a nice little scandal cover the daily news. They says cool. Your jets, TV reporter flags team for Lewd behavior. Um, Ean is saints reporter for as a TV. Where the fuck is that broadcast? It's is at the center of a jet Brouhaha. Basically, if you see this girl, she's fucking hottie right? She's got her little pass here and uh, you know, she's got some Cleveland show. Oh my God. Are you serious?

Speaker 5:          00:42:09       They got a picture of her at a jets practice. She's got on the tightest fucking jeans I've ever seen in my life with the most perfect round ass you've ever seen. And she's in high heels. Okay. And she's walking around a bunch of football players who got that testosterone going with a fat shit talk and coach, let me guess. Somebody said something out of line. Oh, this is just, this is, you know what I mean? This right here, and this is one of these things where you can't say, well look how you're dressed. Cause they go, you're blaming the victim. She should have a right to have three quarters of her tits outside of her shirt with a thong going up her fucking ass crack. And she should be allowed to walk into a locker room with a bunch of football players and not have one out of fucking whatever the fuck you're going to say.

Speaker 5:          00:43:00       Well, one fucking rude comic. Gimme a break. Nfl boss Roger Goodell was demanding answers last night from jets players. Well, why don't you look at the pictures, Roger. Huh? What are you a fucking unique? You don't understand what the problem was. Uh, for players, coaches accused of subjecting a female sports reporter to sexist locker room conduct, they should've just said for subjecting her to locker room conduct. This is basically what happened. She went into a locker room and was subjected to lock a rump conduct. Can you believe it? I remember last night when I went out to a bar and I was subjected to bar rum conduct. I couldn't believe it. I was like, what am I in a bar or something as they prepare for their season opener tonight, gang green is dealing with a burgeoning scandal over the treatment of Inez Saints, uh, for Azteca of Mexico.

Speaker 5:          00:43:55       This girl is a 10. She's fucking smoking gorgeous. You've got to see the way she's dressed. Okay. And Fuck You lady. Fuck you. Look at the way she's dressed. She's one of those, you know what's funny about the broads out there is this is the kind of girl, all right, the kind of woman that kind of fucking who were, who, if you know, if any of these women, you know, well listen to his podcast, they're walking down the street with their husband and this girl comes walking by, they immediately, they take fucking, you know when the eyes become like little slits, is he looking at them? You know, and then they're looking at their husband and they're going to get mad you because this other bitch goes to the gym. You know, like somehow it's your fucking fault and they fucking looking at you because they can't just come out and say, oh my God, that girl is fucking gorgeous.

Speaker 5:          00:44:43       I'm so jealous of her. They, they can't, they can't own that emotion. So then they look at you and they're just waiting for you to glance in that part and that woman's direction so they can blame you. That does. Fuck another girl is eating right and, and fucking doing herself up. Right? It's going to become your fucking fault. I used to do a bit about that. Next time you, you know it. Here's one for you guys on a burn, a joke right here that I never fucking record it. So who gives a shit? Next time you're walking down the street with your girlfriend, right? And this fucking unbelievably smoking shit comes walking up the street, right? And what do you got? And she immediately just looks at you like, go ahead and look at her. So I can take out my fucking hatred of this better looking girl and make it your fucking fault, right?

Speaker 5:          00:45:23       This is what you do. Rather than trying to look away and having blood come out of your, out of your eyes, you try not to look at this fucking hot piece of it's coming up the street. What you do is you fucking point right at her and whatever she's wearing, you tell your girl that she'd look right in that you point right. And it'd be like, you know what? You look great in a dress like that, right? And then immediately just a p, you know it, it makes Samran security go. Oh my God. Really? Do you think I could get away with wearing something? They totally used to girls feeling good. You're staring at the girl's ass. You're talking about the cut of the dress. You, it's bullshit. You're checking around without disrespecting your woman. See right there. Bill Burke bringing couples together. All right, let's continue on here.

Speaker 5:          00:46:03       Um, so this woman, 32 years old, 32 years old, still in smoking fucking shape, a former miss universe contestant complained. She was bombarded with cat calls and boarish antics at the jets, New Jersey training facility to the extent she wanted to end to end quotes said cover my ears. Um, dying oven, barest. This woman, right? Former Miss Universe contestant who would walk on stage with a fucking string bikini and high heels with a hoo ha hanging out talking about how to save Greenland or whatever is embarrassed because she walked around. I mean, give me a, you know what I mean? This is why women stink.

Speaker 5:          00:46:52       It's like, what are you doing there to begin with? It's a bunch of guys playing football. It's like, and then we're cool enough to let you win there. And then everybody has to fucking adjust their behavior because your there wake, excuse me, excuse me. There's a lady present. You know what I mean? And you'll wonder why you get called a cunt. That's why. Right fucking there. It's just fucking unbelievable. I would never walk into a god damn baby shower be, oh, excuse me. Excuse me. There's a guy present. Can we put fucking game on Ovia I wasn't. I'd be standing in the corner gone. Oh Gee Gee, when is this Shit gonna be over? But I wouldn't at any point try to cock block what anybody was fucking talking about. Go ahead and talk about sex in the city. Talk about your favorite shoes or whatever the fuck it is you do. I wouldn't be covering my ears dying of embarrassment. If you all started talking about my package, I'd be flattered.

Speaker 2:          00:47:57       MMM.

Speaker 5:          00:47:57       This is some of the more and more ignorant shit that I've said on this podcast. But I think there's a point behind this. I'll, let's continue with the article.

Speaker 2:          00:48:04       MMM,

Speaker 5:          00:48:05       good. Hell is she said, I'm dying of embarrassment. Saints tweeted in Spanish, um, Goodell immediately ordered an investigation into the troubling in air quotes, allegations, which were addressed in a team meeting last night. Uh, this meeting is now called to order, uh, last night when that smoking hot chick with the tight clothes came in and everybody said, God Damn, look at that fucking ass. Yeah, you're not allowed to do that anymore.

Speaker 2:          00:48:33       Uh,

Speaker 5:          00:48:35       she excuse to coach. Uh, yeah. Yes sir. Yeah, we'll, you're talking about that girl who came in or a Teddy's, we're hanging out of her shirt. Yeah. That one. Yeah. That one. We a disrespected her. See, this is, this is the deal. All right. They come down, they want the fucking attention. You know what? Wait, what? What is she, what is she doing in the fucking locker room to begin with? You know what? She even in the locker room, did I even, they even say that, I can't remember. Didn't you see any given Sunday? You don't remember that movie? You're gonna stand there and there's gonna be some black dude with a dick down to the floor. I mean, why are you going in? I wouldn't go in there if I went in there, they'd start giving me cat calls like I was at fresh fish guy in the beginning of shot, Shawshank redemption, and I'd be dying of embarrassment too, but I'd fucking take it.

Speaker 5:          00:49:29       It'd be like, ah, well what the fuck did you think was going to happen? You're a fucking pansy and you come in and do an NFL locker room. They're all going to give you shit and say you're a pussy, right? I mean, what kind of a fucking world are we living in now? When a gorgeous woman wearing tight, ridiculous clothes, it's going to walk into a fucking at a football practice and she's going to get upset that she got unwanted attention. Well, why don't you come there and dress like they did in the 18 hundreds with one of the big hoop skirts so they can't see you fucking thighs. This chick is fucking ridiculous. Look, look at the New York Daily News and look at the little inset picture that they have of her. I'm sure they did it for a fucking reason. It's ridiculous. Look at that fucking ass. Look at it. That's the first thing I think. Look at that fucking ass. Jesus Christ. And then she's holding a mic. Looks like a dick in her hand while she bobbing her head up and down and she asked the questions. This is like entrapment.

Speaker 2:          00:50:29       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:50:30       Anyways, let's fucking continue.

Speaker 5:          00:50:32       Um, but, but proper, we've had contact with the team multiple times and are moving very aggressively to establish the facts. The NFL spokesman, Greg, I Hilo said jets owner woody Johnson woke up from his coma and said, oh, wait, that guy no off. That guy's actually young, uh, called saints to hear or side of the story, uh, said that, that the team will take any appropriate steps necessary to maintain a respectful environment for the media. Basically, this girl is now going to become a fucking millionaire off of this lawsuit because she walked to an NFL practice with her Miss Universe body with tight fucking clothes on. And somebody said, God Damn, look at that fucking ass right there. Hey mark. What the fuck would you do with dad? I fucking bed over flubbing table.

Speaker 2:          00:51:21       Okay,

Speaker 5:          00:51:22       and then fucking rex. Ryan. I can't even see him. I fucking my fucking stomach. So big. Huh? Was that a good one? Players. Do you guys like me? I talk just like you.

Speaker 2:          00:51:31       I can't wait for them to fucking lose tonight. [inaudible] all right, let's get on to stuff that I want to

Speaker 6:          00:51:57       bitch about this week. All right? I know a lot of you guys, you probably think on some level then. I hate women. All right? And I gotta be honest with you. You fucking right. I don't like hate him individually, but as a group, they fucking annoying me because they're always complaining, bitch, moaning and all this fucking crap. Unlike me who just always brings to sunshine. I, this is the thing, whatever it comes down to, male, female relationships. What I've noticed on television is that if someone's going to be the dose, it's always the guy. If somebody is at fault, it's always the guy. If somebody's going to pay, it's always the guy except for the occasional Britney spears. All right. Who, if I ever see a binder, a fucking beer for growth, that bum ass husband, right? Backup dancers sitting around the house getting fat sitting in sweatpants that she paid for.

Speaker 6:          00:52:50       You know she ever went over there and slap the shit out of him, smashed him on his head with one of her book dazzled high heels and I was on that jury. I would say not guilty. I would say not guilty. I would say she's a fucking hero that she hasn't done it yet. Um, here's, here's a story for you. These are the stories. I'm just going to put this out here cause I'm really hoping that this is going to eat. It inspires somebody to start some sort of [inaudible] adulation or whatever the fuck you need to do to turn things around. Because I really, in this country, there's a major problem. Women are organized and guys are not when it comes to this relationship shit. All right. Oh, you go right ahead and roll your eyes. Ladies. I don't give a fuck. This isn't for you.

Speaker 6:          00:53:33       All right? Here's a nice story is I'm gonna read one of these every fucking week to fucking people realize what is going on. All right? What is not, not what is going on. What is also going on is every fucking three minutes. I got to watch the story about some poor woman who got the living shit kicked out of her by some asshole guy, right? And you watch enough of those stories and you start thinking, oh my God, women are always the victim. It's not. So here's a nice story for you. A little story called, who knew I was not the father? Do I even need to read it to you? You know where this is going. This happens all the fucking time. But they don't talk about it. You know, it's not considered a major fucking problem. It's because guys are not organized and we have to start bitch moaning and complaining the way women do. All right?

Speaker 6:          00:54:22       Just mentally try and imagine what it's like to, to have a period. And that's the mindset you need to get in to, to make change in this country. That's what I think. That's what I think is needed. All right. Okay. Here we are, boys and girls gather round. Who Knew I was not the father. Take one. It was July in 2007 when Mike and Mike l s the Pennsylvania courts to declare that he was no longer the father of his daughter for four years. Mike had known that the girl he had rocked to sleep and dance with across the living room floor was not as they say his, the revelation from a DNA test was devastating and prompted him to leave his wife. Uh, but he had not renounced their child cause he's a good shit cause he realizes that the kid, you know,

Speaker 6:          00:55:08       it's not the kids' fault that her mom is a whore. You know, sky's a stand up guy. But he had not renounced their child. He continued to feel that in all the ways that mattered, she was still his daughter and he faithfully paid her child support with guys a seat. If there's a god, this guy is going straight to heaven. Okay. He could've been bitter. He could've walked away. He didn't stood in right. So it was only when he learned that his ex wife was about to marry the man who she said actually was the girl's biological father, that Mike flipped supporting another's man's child suddenly became unbearable. Can you believe this woman?

Speaker 2:          00:55:54       Okay,

Speaker 6:          00:55:55       why don't they show that? Why don't they, it's showing all these stories of guys, bt women. What about a woman? Why don't they show what women do? Shit like this.

Speaker 2:          00:56:03       Okay.

Speaker 6:          00:56:04       You know, not only did she cheat on her husband.

Speaker 2:          00:56:08       Yeah,

Speaker 6:          00:56:08       she fucked a dude raw. Not only did she fuck the dude raw, she led a busted in them that only did she have a fucking kid with them. She didn't say shit to her husband.

Speaker 6:          00:56:20       So then make this fucking guy, he has to find out. He sitting there, you know, looking out, we looked in, his kid doesn't look anything like him and she doesn't say shifts. So one day goes to Walgreens, gifts will DNA tests does a little swab. You Swab of her and then him sends it off to you gotta be shitting me. Labs in fucking Colorado comes back, finds out it's not as kid. He's absolutely fucking devastating. His God, their marriages over and he's still a standup guy, so now there's fucking whore goes back with the guy that actually knocked her up. Now they're living together. Okay. Wouldn't you think despite the fact that she's a whore, that maybe she wouldn't be a cunt to, you know, it's unbelievable. Why not at that point, just have the fucking real dad pay and if for some reason the courts are making this guy go through the motions of writing the check, just take the check, cashed it and give it back to the guy.

Speaker 6:          00:57:20       Why can't you do that? You know why? Because they can never have enough that you know how guys can never have enough pussy. Women can never have enough stuff. You ever noticed that even if they have a one night stand, they still got to get a tee shirt. You know, they always got to get something. I don't know if I've said that before in this podcast, but it's fucking true. They always got to have stuff, you know? And he still got this free fucking money coming in. This bitch has got to be, she's pimping these guys. She's got two guys, two guys working for God damn genius. Also a con, but she's a genius of a cunt. Okay? I mean, how dumb is that guy who actually knocked her up? How dumb is he to marry her? Who the fuck marry somebody who was who?

Speaker 6:          00:58:03       Who Marries, who makes somebody, their wife who was already somebody else's wife and fucked around with you? You saw what she did. You think she's not going to get tired of you? You think she's not going to go somewhere else? Get some more dick and a little more, you know, foreign spackle between the fucking gams. Unbelievable Sago. That's Jen. That's not misogynistic that I'm only reason reading these stories. What I'm doing is I'm trying to balance out the bullshit that you see it on TV, the bullshit vibe that only guys cheat guys are dogs, guys, guys, guys do all the fucking bullshit. It's okay. We are equal, okay? We are equal. We are capable of doing wonderful things like this guy who did the right thing by this little girl. And we're also capable of doing horrific things. Alright? Slapping the Shit Outta fucker. Women's sticking their heads in the glove box and try and see if he can get it all the way closed.

Speaker 6:          00:59:03       You know, we also do shit like that. And ladies, right? They can be absolute angels and they can be a steaming pile of conflict. This woman. So there you go. That's my little fair and balanced reporting for this week. Go Fuck. I've done an, I've done two hours, two and a half hours of comedy tonight. My new special, uh, I'm taping this Saturday night at the Lincoln Theater in Washington DC. And let me tell you something, brother. I'm fucking bringing it on this one. All right. I am on a mission to outdo my last two fucking specials. Okay? And I don't care if you conch, don't think I did it. I think I'm going to deal with
