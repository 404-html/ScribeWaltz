Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on? It's Phil Burn. It's the Monday morning podcast for Monday, October 20th, 2000 and [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:00:09       14. How you doing? How's it going and how,

Speaker 1:          00:00:15       um, I'm actually in a hotel right now or a Sunday afternoon recording this on a Sunday after dude, um, out in Santa Monica here. I know what you think of bill. What the hell are you have fucking staying in a hotel room out in Santa Monica? I thought you lived in Los Angeles. I do. I do. You know what I'm doing? I'm taking a little stay vacation. [inaudible] one of the most annoying things that a phrases that's come up in the like the last seven or eight years, stay vacations, you know, after the bankers completely fucking robbed the American people, all the God damn money and then said fuck you. You pay for it cause we're not going to pay for it. What is how he long Evan? His hair. Sorry, I got the TV on. Is that as gray hair? Fucking glistening there is as Grecian formula not working. Um, yeah. So anyways, after they fucking robbed, everybody ripped off fucking everybody and didn't go to jail. Nobody could afford to take a vacation anymore. So then they came up with Stevie

Speaker 2:          00:01:18       occasions. We're finding that more and more people are doing what's known is this stay vacation. Rather than going away and spending all that money, they don't have that money anymore because it was stolen from them, from their banker cunts. But they're too big to fail. So now when people go on vacation, they stay where they live. Isn't that cute? No, it isn't. It's not cute.

Speaker 1:          00:01:48       I'm on the same. That's why I did it. Um, you know, I just don't have a lot of time right now and I wanted to fucking do something and a anyways, whatever. So I'm out here having a stay vacation. Um, I love how they fucking do that shit. Anytime they fucking rob everybody have everything. They always come up with some cute little fucking phrase. It's supposed to appease you. Stay vacation. Well, we earned the money. We went out and worked our fucking asses off. We had the money to go on a real vacation. And then these cunts stolen. I'm really pissed off. When did she have a stay vacation?

Speaker 2:          00:02:24       Oh, that sounds like a good idea.

Speaker 1:          00:02:28       All your anger goes away and then they keep your money right. And then they'd go out and they fucking blow it on hookers that you can't even imagine what they look like. A level of beauty that does not exist for the person on this side of the teller window. Right. Sorry, I'm combining like 12 conspiracy theories. Um, anyways, you can tell them getting over stuff or whatever. Everybody had. I got all right. And um, I want just for the record, I at no point that I think I had a bola. Alright. Unfucking believable. I'm so fucking ashamed of my fellow man and the absolute fucking panic that six people with their head cold can cause the entire herd to start stampeding towards a fucking cliff. Got Airplanes. Just freaking the fuck out. You know, Jesus Christ. People age. All right. Act like you been there before that, that take us down.

Speaker 1:          00:03:49       Well, did it look at Magic Johnson, that guy, he's in better shape than 99% of people. Okay, please. Some professional athletes going to get a bulla is going to have to retire and everybody thinks he's going to fucking die, but he's going to have the fucking money. All right. I was thinking of the best South Park's ever when they showed Magic Johnson's cure for aids and he had a blender and he was just shoving golden cash into it, blending it up and then drinking it. Um, anyways, I'm all over the fucking map here. All right. Act like you fucking been there before. All right. It's not going to take us down. Shit. Hang on a second. Hang on. Hang on. Hang on. I gotta answer this. Hey Georgia. Sorry about that. I had to answer that for two seconds. Um, anyways, um, that was I talking about. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:04:47       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:50       We survived that one. We're going to survive the way it'll be fine. We're going to be fucking fine. The great thing about a bola is it kills you so fucking quickly, Bang, Bang, boom, get gone. You're done. All right. Over and Africa, when it would start to spread like wildfire, everybody just ran into the woods. You stayed out. There is shit in the woods for a couple of weeks. He came back and everybody was dead. Then you throw them in a pile, you lit them on fire and he's just fucking get on with your life. Everybody running around like the sky has fallen. What am I good friends? Paul Versey. He was freaking the fuck out dude. Why do they keep bleeding? People get on planes.

Speaker 1:          00:05:38       Look, you guys have seen my shit. You know that. I know that the world needs a good plague. It needs a good one. All right. We're too smart for our own good. You know if there's always shit out there wiping out animals and then they survive. Not all of them. A lot of them die or whatever, but this day still survive and then they go on and it's balanced. Look at us. We're all over the place. What the fuck is knocking those goddamn cabinets around? It's probably the broad next door. This fucking lady next door. I swear to God her in his stupid ass friend, they were up at seven 30 in the morning. Okay, and I'm a morning person. Believe it or not, even though I have this job. Oh my God, look, I got the TV on in the background. He's his fucking no more commercial. Am I the only football fan who gets fucking annoyed with this stupid commercial? I don't hit women. I don't need to be brow beaten and get a fucking lecture in the middle of my God damn game here because one running back on one fucking team.

Speaker 3:          00:06:42       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:06:42       Knocked out his wife. Not during a football game.

Speaker 3:          00:06:46       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:06:47       he did it in Atlantic city. So why don't you run that commercial down in Atlantic city? Show it on the fucking boardwalk. So God damn annoying. You can't get away from it. Constantly giving you a fucking lecture on how to be a better person. I love how they look at that stupid commercial like that's going to stop a wife beater from hitting his wife. Like he's about ready to do it. And then fucking ice tea, Yo no more. She tell where's my money bitch? Right. And then he's going to be like, oh, okay.

Speaker 3:          00:07:18       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:18       Ah, in everybody's dressed in black, like they're doing a fucking Beatles album.

Speaker 1:          00:07:24       I swear to God, I just, you know, I've got, you know, I thought I was in a good mood. This is pathetic. Kate. Anybody watched the, uh, Indiana Hoosier game yesterday? The football game? I can't remember who the fuck they were playing. It was hilarious. Indiana Hoosiers like the, any, the University of Indiana and I should say they had like the widest fucking school on the planet. All right. And one of the most racist fucking states on the planet. And that's somebody who fucking grew up right outside of Boston. And I can say that because I'm a Republican. I just did that with like race relations. Um, so anyways, uh, I'm watching the game

Speaker 1:          00:08:08       and you know them, they have that classic, you know, fucking uh, Gene Hackman, who's your fucking uniforms? It's just white as white can be. It's as Corny as extreme whiteness is. But the influence of those disco uniforms that the fucking Oregon duck show wearing this people literally signing with Oregon cause they want to wear the uniform. There's athletes making that decision. Fucking unbelievable. You know, like it's a goddamn fashion show. I like playing football, but let me tell you something, honey, those helmets are to die for. There's literally people's siding. Jai, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're shining. Their football

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       lives away to go play with that program. So now everybody's got to have some sort of fucking disco ball football helmet now. So, um, I, you know, I put on Indiana, which is the last fucking team you'd think would ever change their stupid all red with the dumb white. I think they just had the eye for Indiana, you know, classic Bamfam fucking old school. Trump owned goddamn school. And even they had to give into it. They had to address the fact that they were losing recruits because of that disco helmet that the fucking Oregon ducks have. So they actually got themselves some shiny fucking lantern helmet, but they kept everything else. They kept everything else. Totally like the Corny fucking old school when one for the gipper like did like the, even like the texts that they had Indiana University look like it was written like pre war as something in the end zones.

Speaker 2:          00:09:55       And then they've got these fucking disco helmets on. It looks like they stole them. I don't know. That was a long way to fucking go to say like, look, if you're going to fucking do the uniform, you got to go the whole way. You got to have the flashy fucking helmet. You got to have chest hair showing between your fucking shoulder pads with the medallion. Right. Zip Up fucking pants and that no tear away pants is what you got to have. And then you got to have some hoary cheerleader. So you got to go all out. You can't just have the helmet.

Speaker 4:          00:10:26       Right? I Dunno.

Speaker 2:          00:10:31       Anyways. Is it true that like the cheerleaders on the um,

Speaker 2:          00:10:35       Indiana Hoosiers like their pompoms are made out of like a recycled dot clan sheets? Sorry, I'm telling you. I'm saying that racist people. Oh, this podcast sucks this week. I'm just not on my game. I have good ideas. I'm just not, I'm just, you know, I've just thought it's all in the execution. I'll tell you right now with the x's and o's, who all don't read on the board, I mean the coaches could only do so much. I mean the coaches coached the team, but at the end of the day, the players go out and they play the game. And if you're not out there, if they're not firing on all cylinders, if they're not out there acting as a cohesive unit, if they haven't bought into the system, then you know you're going to have problems and you can get national football week. I actually have the packers panthers game on in the background and a pack. Is it kicking the shit out of him? 28 to three yeah. No, here we go. He's a little highlight. Sates first. The lions. Nah, there's a lone pairs. Are you fuckers here? Beg, beg, beg scores. All right. 17 to three. I went to a line, so I'm game a long time ago. Beautiful feel. Ford field, great name for it. You know, and

Speaker 4:          00:11:41       damn,

Speaker 2:          00:11:43       every time they made a play, a decent play, they had this awful son of a lion, roaring sound like that, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       like it was getting prison rate and it just ended every time they make a play, watch a the home game. If you've got the NFL package, watch a lion's game and listen for every time they do something good, you just hear, oh, I guess that's supposed to be a roaring, why didn't they just buy the rights of the 20th Century Fox line? It was probably overdoing it. Like you've ever watched a nature show and you see how a lion roars when it's trying to like say, this is my territory. I don't want any you young bucks coming here trying to fuck my 30 fucking women. You know Jesus Packer, fans of fat, Jesus Christ. Every time they cut to the fucking, there's not one treadmill and that God damn state, I'm sorry. Anyways, anytime they cut to the fucking lion,

Speaker 3:          00:12:47       okay

Speaker 1:          00:12:47       now cut to 11 when they show up, they just, they just go like, Ooh, we're over and fuck it over again. I'm always disappointed. I'm like, that's what they sound like. I thought they sounded like that 20th century Fox. Would

Speaker 1:          00:13:02       you just, I didn't know that they stand, they're sounding like they're going to fucking hurl, you know, like did like they, you know, those fucking things. Eight day eating everything shit. And get a couple of bones in there. He's like, I think I got a Yak every once in a while. That's what I thought it was going to do. But they were like, no, it's its marketing, its territory. Oh, is that what you think? Is that what you think you're going to have one be a pet. So that youtube video the other day and this fucking guy goes over these people's House that have like a pet lioness.

Speaker 3:          00:13:29       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:30       And the thing pounces on him playfully and, but like, you know, weighs like 600 pounds as like digging into this fucking guy's dress shirt. The guy doesn't even have a t shirt underneath it. Right. He's fucking walking around like he's uh, Gabe Kaplan or whatever. Right. That's Clark Gable split meant to say. Right. And um, he fucking, it's digging into his back, which causes him to cry out, which excites the Predator in the wild animal and it's fucking hilarious. Cause like when wild animals, yeah, like they get excited causes them to just fucking snap your neck. Like you have to know like dog toys, you know, those little squeaky dog toys. And all that. Do you know why they squeak? It's not cause it's cute. Is it supposed to excite the Predator in them, which gets them to play with it? It's supposed to sound like a fucking animal dying.

Speaker 1:          00:14:20       And you know when they pick it up, when they shake it around and shit in your laugh and thinking always play it. He isn't, that's their natural instinct. When they grab something, they shake it like that and it breaks the neck of the prey. But we've pretty much bred that out of all dogs. So they just sit there in the corner with that stupid look on their face. But every once in a while you get, I'm one of those squeaky toys and you see it, you see it in their eyes again. You know, it's like when I was in that Italian restaurant in San Francisco and a time, and I look over and I saw Joe Montana sitting there on a double date, right? The fucking Joe Montana and I got up to leave. And as I walked out, you know, it was like a crew of like five of us or whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:15:01       So there's motion and the restaurant. He looked over at us and I was looking at him and he looked at me and my fucking stomach dropped cause he still had that look in his eye. You know that two minute offense, I'm going to cut your fucking hard out. He can't help it. He's sitting there with a fucking risotto in front of him and he still has that look in his face. Every once in a while you get a little squeaky toy. You put it in front of your dog and you'll see it. I don't care how little foofy little prissy dog you have. You give that thing a little fucking chew toy that's squeaks. You Watch it, fucking shaking it around and the owner's going, oh look at that. She thinks she's big. She thinks she doesn't understand that smell she had. See she takes on all the big dogs and whatever. It's like, sweetheart, she's not cute right now. She's trying to kill something and she doesn't even know she's doing it. It's just in her fucking DNA. She's trying to break the neck of that fucking thing. All right. Put some shoes on. Um, anyways. Yeah. So there's broad next door, right?

Speaker 1:          00:16:04       I mean, just the stereotypical, awful fucking female talk. The kind of thing that if I actually did it in my act, I would once again be branded a sexist. Okay. Which I'm not even saying I'm not all right. The definition of the word, by the definition of the word, I think I am, I mean, basically in this, uh, in this climate and this culture, I think basically if you publicly call women on for anything at this point, then you're a sexist because it no, no point could they ever be doing something wrong. Right. I mean, they're human beings. They're just as good as us. Unless they're doing something wrong. If they do something wrong, you call them out on it thing. You're obviously a sexist and you don't think that they should be allowed to vote. Correct. I mean that seems how the math works in comedy clubs anyways, so I'm such a cunt this week, so I'm fucking sitting there and this fucking woman is talking to this other woman and that literally just talking about shit, not literally shit but just like stuff, stuff that they bought.

Speaker 1:          00:17:13       I got static newest trends. Yap. Was it good deal till at that at bat the bat, Sheila's Blablabla Blah Blah Blah Bell-to-bell Blablablabla Blah pocketbook. Like the level of fucking excitement that they had for that was the same level I have when I talked to Versie when like the NFL season, week one is about to begin equally fucking stupid. Equally not worth getting excited about. But because I can't relate to it, I have to make fun of it. You know, kind of just killed my whole point of view there. But you know, whatever the fuck you want. So anyways, so I'm staying at this hotel and Lo and behold, oh there we go. Down the sideline. Not that darn has 25, um, green bay packers just kicking the shit out of the panthers. This cannot be Cam Newton's fault. Cam knew it looks like a fucking superhero, you know, he looks like a war hero, a quarterback and an astronaut all at the same time. So it can't be his fault.

Speaker 2:          00:18:16       I'll tell you, I got to blame that on offense of line. I don't care how good you are at the quarterback position, you cannot play if you laid on your back 60% of the place bike. Oh, absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. Boy, you know what, when it comes down to it, you know, you held out for a bigger car, tractor jar, you know you're going to get all the glory and old criticism. Sherif he said high ankle sprain,

Speaker 1:          00:18:39       touchdown packers. Jesus Christ has got to be 35 to three year. Hey, you know, I don't know that this is actually a movement in the NFL, but according to Paul Versey from the Versie effect, there's discussions about getting rid of the extra point.

Speaker 4:          00:18:58       MMM

Speaker 1:          00:18:59       inverse. He's claiming it's so fucking stupid because 99.9% of them are made and it's just a big fucking waste of time. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Blue. I mean, I just fucking blows my mind that a guy who loves the de, the NBA, right, can watch a fucking NBA game with the final two and a half to four minutes, can take as much as 45 to 50 fucking minutes.

Speaker 4:          00:19:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:19:30       That this fucking guy gives a fuck about a play that takes 30 seconds and takes no time off of the clock.

Speaker 4:          00:19:40       You know, I love the extra point.

Speaker 1:          00:19:44       I love that play for the simple fact I, this isn't even my opinion. I just, somebody else said this and I totally agree with it. It's the one thing that really happens on a football field that people in the, if you fuck it up, people in the crowd legitimately can get mad because who can't make it? Like most of the people in the crowd, if you'll remotely in shape, you can make an extra point. So when they miss one, it's like, how the fuck did you miss that? And then at what I love is whenever you miss an extra point, it always seems to be like you lost by one. I'll tell you those extra points. Don't Miss Texta points. He'll come back to haunt you. I fucking love the x deploy. All right. Keep it in the God damn game.

Speaker 1:          00:20:31       They got rid of the extra point. That'd be like the American league with the fucking Dh rule. Okay. Have the pitcher hit well, it's a fucking waste. It's an uh, you know, this is a picture is always strikes out. Anyways. What the fence, the fun thing of game. I like it. It also keeps the pitcher fucking honest. You're going to go out there and throw it somebody who's head. Then you got to go up. You've got to come up to bat. How much more fun would have been to watch Roger Clemens pitch if he also had to hit? Do you remember when he fucking threw it? Mike Piazza and then they finally played the mets in Shea Stadium. He had to come up to bat. Do you remember how we went up to bat? He went up to bat with nothing other than a batting helmet. He went up there like a man after thrown in people's heads for 20 years. He didn't give a fuck. He was so roid it up. Bring it, hit me in the head. It'll make me throw harder the next day. And he, she need to have on batting gloves. He just walked up there. His big roided up Texas ass in the fucking pitcher threw at him and he missed him. Amen. At his hips.

Speaker 1:          00:21:40       I don't fuck do you miss something like that? You know what I mean? There's gotta be like fucking up cow tipping, right? You can't hit Roger Clemens, all that text message mex in his belly and all those roids in his fucking ass. You can't hit this guy. It's unbelievable. Actually. He was acquitted of it. So I shouldn't say that. Right. I can't even say a legend. Now, can I accused steroid user, Roger Clemens?

Speaker 1:          00:22:11       I remember when I lived in New York City, every fucking two weeks it seemed they did. Uh, they did, uh, before he got busted or accused, um, they used to do a fucking local news piece on Roger Clemens, workout a routine. It was perfect because then when people go, going like, dude, you just see his, uh, I, you know, I think that guy's doing roids so that guy's on roids and everybody would be like, dude, you see how much guy fuck a workshop? It was perfect. His people put that out there first. You know, if they're in the locker room, they know people are going down. They know people are going to get busted. We, we got to get out in front of this thing. Let's do some pieces on how much you work out. [inaudible] all this shit up. He's stolen. He's the one squats everything, whatever. Alright, hang on a second. I apologize. This is rude.

Speaker 1:          00:23:07       Jesus Christ that was actually going to tweet that I was fucking sick, you know, and make a joke about it, but I didn't want to listen to everybody's fucking hacky of Bulla jokes when I had my own anyways. You know? So anyways, I, I'm staying at this hotel and you know, when I'd be staying in a hotel, they have to have a fucking steam, a steam room. Right? Well, you know what, let me actually, uh, I gotta I gotta read some fucking advertising here before I get too deep into this podcast.

Speaker 3:          00:31:11       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:31:12       All right. And we are back.

Speaker 1:          00:31:14       We are back. I don't have the advertising yet, so I got to edit that in. I hope that came back smoothly. Um, yeah, so I go downstairs to take a steam, right. And uh, I walk into the steam room. There's nobody in there.

Speaker 3:          00:31:29       All right.

Speaker 1:          00:31:31       Thumbs up. Number one.

Speaker 1:          00:31:34       It's early in the morning. So a lot of times they don't. You might be the first one down there. So the steam is an odd, which sucks because you've got to wait like 20 minutes for it to fucking heat up. I walked to the steam. It's fucking, not only is it on, it's cranking. All right. Thumbs up number two. So I fucking, you know, I get ready, I bring my own fucking flip flops. Okay. Cause you cannot walk around in that slime barefoot. God knows what the fuck's going to be grown on your feet the next day. And I'm not using people's, the flip flops that they give you because I don't know how well that they wipe it out. Okay. Think about that. That's somebody's job to fucking clean off the fun Gal free slippers at a spa.

Speaker 3:          00:32:17       All right.

Speaker 1:          00:32:18       I don't want to judge anybody who listens to this podcast, but there's no way you dreamed about doing that job when you were a child. So I would imagine if you get that job, you're not exactly exactly like enthused about doing that fucking job. Right. So what I'm saying is, is probably a lot of bullshit that's left behind. Hence, I bring my own fucking flip flops. Um, and I haven't, where the fucking, you've got the thing that fucking goes all the way across your foot. Dot. That stuck between your toe. So it goes full flip per flat, per foot, flat on the bottom of your feet and you know the shit out of somebody. All alright, I'm courteous. All right, so I got my flip flops on. I got my towel and I got another towel to wipe off the fucking sweat when I'm in there, right? All the toxins and I fucking go to the goddamn steam room.

Speaker 1:          00:33:02       I fucking the steam thing, right? I open it up, I go inside and immediately sitting right next to the door. Is it dude? Completely fucking naked once again. Right dick out for fucking days. Just sitting there and you know, I'm just getting in there. My eyes are getting adjusted. Some like, okay, you know, I can naked guy nine o'clock and now like how big is this steam shower? How many fucking people are in there? I'm feeling my way through here and I'm walking away from this guy in his fucking schlong. And so I'm taking like baby steps as I'm walking through, kind of feeling my way in. And this guy's opening fucking line to me. First words out of his mouth. You know what he says? He says it's just us. Oh my God. If it wasn't so creepy, I would have burst out laughing. It's just like, really that that's you coming out of the gate with that. That is so creepy and fucked up. I almost have to applaud it. It's just us. Oh my God. So then he goes, you want me to warm it up more, right as I sit down? I'm like, yeah, sure. You know, staring down at my fucking sandals. So we fucking stands up. I don't know what he did. I don't know what the Knob or he threw some water on it. He just goes, he goes, watch your feet. And I said, I'm cool. I got sandals on. I didn't know what the fuck he was talking about, but the steam comes out, you gonna burn your feets. We fucking cranks to think

Speaker 1:          00:34:38       all right.

Speaker 3:          00:34:40       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:34:40       Yeah. Now it's like hot as fuck, but it's great because it creates like this cloud where I can't see him anymore. So now, now it's great. There's like this divide or a steam. So you know, I don't have to sit there staring at my feet. Right. And then after about like 90 seconds to steam starts to dissipate and as it does appearing out of the mist, the guy is standing up in the shower. Like if you took a picture of somebody like mid jumping Jack, Jack, except his feet were on the fucking ground. He was standing there like arms outside, like doing this like heavy breathing and shit. And it's just like, I don't know what I don't know.

Speaker 3:          00:35:20       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:35:20       I like to think I'm not homophobic. I'm not homophobic in the sense of I don't give a fuck.

Speaker 3:          00:35:26       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:35:27       You know, I don't give a shit. You know, if that's what you went to g, you know, God bless you or whatever. But as that homophobic take, when I'm sitting there like when there's a fucking guy like that clinic, what are you doing? Why don't you just fucking bend over, grab your fucking ankles while you're at it. What's wrong with you? Sit Down, you sitting in steam, the steam is going to get you. You don't got to stand up. And what are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? Set Out. How about some fucking etiquette, you know? Oh, maybe I'll, you know what, Hey, whatever, I'm open to change. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I should have stood up and just face the guy in it. Started mimicking his fucking actions, right? And then, and then, then do I pass the test? Jesus fucking Christ so that he leaves. Thank God he fucking leaves. You know, and I just start, you know, laughing and then I have to fake like I was coughing just in case you get to hear me, cause it was echo in there and uh, he fucking goes, uh, and then I look and I see his hotel key. There's locker key is still there as, oh my God, fuck this guy's coming back or whatever. So whatever. So he comes back in, um,

Speaker 1:          00:36:44       you know, sits down, like to get wet leaves. Fucking doesn't even take his towel. Just walks out naked as a fucking Jaber just walking around, right? So he comes back in. Now I'm done. So I was like, all right man, have a good day. And he's like, all right, thanks. So I leave right immediately. Go into the shower, ice cold fucking shower, close up the pores, you know, wash away all this shit. You sweat it out. You know, Big Bang Boob. And I'm thinking, all right, no more naked guy. I'm good. I get out of the shower. Who's staying? And they over by the lockers fucking naked as hell. Dick out. Save fucking guy. Okay, now once again, baby, I'm homophobic. What is this guy doing? What is his fucking obsession with just being in my line of sight with his fucking junk? Look, you were there first. You're naked in the fucking steam and good on you, but I show up. All right? Hey, how you doing? Whenever you throw a fucking towel, cover yourself. You fucking animal, right? He doesn't want to do it. All right. He's naked in the steam room guy. Fine. Then he walks out without a fucking towel on, you know, he doesn't give a fuck. He comes back. Then I leave, stay in the fucking steam room and put a fucking towel. You guys walk around like, is this house?

Speaker 1:          00:38:16       Why don't you just take a dump? Right. I was just Adam. I Dunno. I Dunno. You know, I don't want a lot of you guys just say, well bill, why do you keep taking those fucking Steve? Cause I like to, it's one of the perks of those other have double the, the fucking hotel.

Speaker 1:          00:38:33       There's always somebody is going to fuck it up, right? There's always going to be the guy with his deck out the steam room. There's always going to be somebody's pain in the hotel pool, right? There's always gonna be somebody down at the hotel bar that can't handle their liquor and either pukes just starts to fucking fight. There's always just going to be that guy. And this is why, you know, like when you see lifestyles of the rich and famous, you know, and they're always doing that shit. They have their own movie. They attack. They have their own bowling alleys. That's because they have the money to not deal with the guy with his dick out in the steam room. They have their own money to not deal with the person who can hold their fucking alcohol. You know, if anybody's going to pee in their pool, it's going to be them. You know, they got the money to basically just exit the society and I understand the older I get, Jesus Christ, look at Saint Louis, Pete and Seattle at the Fuck Outta here. I don't see this whole up. Oh my God, Pete is going to beat his family dog tonight. If they fucking lose this one, they lost last week to the, to the cowboys. It's so, this is what it's so fucking hard to repeat his super bowl champion because the second you win the fucking thing, every coach

Speaker 1:          00:39:59       on like the team immediately thinks that they're a head coach. They're not the best defensive coordinator in the game that year anymore. Now there are fucking head coach, right? The offensive coordinator, defensive coordinator, both of them, I don't even know if they lost them, but it's inevitable they're going into, if they don't lose them this year, they'll lose them within a couple of years. I was under Pete Carroll and uh, you know, now I know shit, right? That's what happened to the Patriots. Charlie Weis, Romeo, Krummel, all of those guys, that fucking baby face kid who's back coaching with us, he got a head coaching job at, I'm in Denver.

Speaker 1:          00:40:35       Romeo chromal got fucked. He went to Cleveland. Charlie Weis got a head coaching job and Notre Dame and then all your players, you know, you've got to have a couple, two or three that are going to take the money. Maybe they feel like their body's breaking down or they don't feel like they're getting it. They got respected for them, their part in what they did to win the championship, and then they take some money elsewhere. It's so hard to keep the, uh, the group together, which is why one of my favorite speeches ever, which I had never heard. I didn't know how. I didn't hear about it. Watching the Celtics Lakers rivalry. I didn't hear about it until I read Bill Simmons Book on a Bass Basketball. The uh, the um,

Speaker 3:          00:41:14       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:41:15       Patrick Riley's speech to disease of more when he wanted them to repeat, he said the disease or more when everybody, when the, when everybody wants more, people want more playing time, they want more money, they want more screen time, they want more of this, they want more of that and if totally fucks up what got you there?

Speaker 4:          00:41:36       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:41:38       You know, what do they always talk about? They always said, well you know, they played a lot of games this year and a a, you know, last year in the playoffs, you know, they didn't get as long as break and then the celebrated too much and blah blah blah blah blah blah. Which obviously I think plays a role. But

Speaker 4:          00:41:54       um, I dunno,

Speaker 1:          00:41:58       I dunno. I've sucks cause back in the day was like free agency, that type of shit that didn't really exist. You could actually hold a group together and you could have like those big time dynasties, you know, like that Seattle defense should have been doing that for like a good three, four years.

Speaker 3:          00:42:14       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:42:15       Um, and would have been one of the legendary defense has had they done that. You dominate a Superbowl like that. I mean, that was like, I, that's like, I haven't seen anything like that since the 85 bears. That's just, it's a shame. So fucking shame. Um, but anyways, what else did I want to talk about already talked about a bola. I'm not afraid of that. Even if there is like a fucking dope, it's a win win.

Speaker 3:          00:42:40       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:42:41       It's a win win either. It doesn't.

Speaker 4:          00:42:45       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:42:46       Do you know either they contain it, which is a win or they don't contain it and, uh, we have a much needed burn off of the population. I know it's brutal to fucking say, but you know, if you take, if you take the emotions out of it,

Speaker 3:          00:43:04       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:43:04       I mean, people, you get 7 billion people on the fucking planet. Well, we're on our way to 14 billion. Everybody's going to have a couple of kids. What the fuck are we doing? Okay. We got manmade salmon people. I mean, if anybody needs a fucking plague, it's human beings.

Speaker 1:          00:43:22       Jesus fucking Christ. How many more casinos can they build out Vegas and they keep getting filled up with mouth breathers. They just keep coming in. And then if you don't believe that we need a plague, then I would say you did not watch that Fsu Notre Dame game yesterday, which for my money was the best college football game of the year. Unbelievable game. I took my wife out last night, so I missed a lot of the second half, but I kept peeking in when we were in bars and shit. But um, it was just an instant classic. But the only in as much as it killed me to miss the game, what I, uh, or a lot of the game, what I loved was that I didn't have to listen to those mouth breathing. Fucking morons.

Speaker 3:          00:44:03       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:44:04       I mean they play that God damn, Whoa, Ooh, every fucking day. Play it for every occasion. If they do something good, they play it. If the other team does something good to get their fans psyched up to, to try to get back into the game. It's like, why don't you just write like two or three of those songs? Just switch it up a little bit. Like I don't, I just can't imagine as a fucking fan. I can't even do, once again, the fucking Boston red sox play that stupid sweet Caroline boop, boop boop. I've never sung it. It was stupid from day fucking one and I never fucking song it. And just to sit there and watch those people and that's just once a game.

Speaker 3:          00:44:46       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:44:47       Magic. If anytime everything went good during a red sox game, everybody just went, Bob, Bob, Bob like a hundred times in nine fucking innings. How could you possibly still be a fed? I Dunno. I have no idea what I feel like somebody just walking into the hotel room right now, probably complaining about me cursing and Shit in here. Um, yeah, that's the type of shit that I see and then I'm just like, you know, I is a, it was a plague really that bad a thing. Uh, Jesus Christ. Bill, Jesus Christ. Um, all right. What do we like 37, 38 minutes into this fucking thing? Minus whatever the hell it to however long it took me to read these.

Speaker 3:          00:45:34       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:45:34       the fucking, uh, advertising. Uh, all right. You don't have to do it. I went to, I'm going to take a break right now cause I'm waiting, still waiting for the advertising of the questions to come in. And, uh, we, you guys didn't need to know that. Did you? Hey, why you don't want came. I want to watch this week. Uh, the big game I want to see is a cowboys and giants because I'm actually a closeted, um, cowboy's fan. I never quite got on board, wants to, Tex Schramm and Tom Landry left. It was so fucking different. It was this stoic, classy franchise, which of course I know the players are like, they were brutal and cutthroat, but I didn't see that part. I just saw the, the, the propaganda and they went from that to habitat, them cowboys, right? And this guy with a facelift and everything. And it became, I just felt like I was watching like Falcon crested or literally the show Dallas, um, became like a reality show. So I never quite got into a, I dunno, I just never got into them after that, even though they went all those times and I was psyched that they won. But I don't know, I never quite was, I was a rabid fan when I was growing up. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:46:47       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:46:48       But now that they're back again in, cause Tony Romo took so much shit to finally see this guy getting protection, it playing great and everything, I'm really hoping, uh, that guy wins one. There's certain people you just have to root for after a while. Tony Romo, Don Mattingly, um, just people that I think are just good guys that have just taken a fucking truck load of Shit and uh, I dunno if they could use a break. So anyways, I'm looking forward to watching that. And plus I also believe it or not, even as a patriots fan, I love the giants. Uh, I always love teams that are like defensive minded and I just feel like, uh, ever since the Harry Carson Lawrence Taylor days, when they revived what the giants were before my time, well, they had Sam huff, the violent world of Sam hough. MMM. I Dunno. Like I, I like those teams that are allegedly like boring that when like games like 17 to fucking nine, um, in Ely always steps up during big games. And I would say that the guy has a horseshoe up his ass, but he did it twice. So at that point, you know, once you're lucky twice she had good. So, um,

Speaker 1:          00:48:02       you know, I dunno, I'm really looking forward to that fucking game and uh, and that is it. So I'm going to take a break here, wait for this shit to come in and I'll be answering your questions, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, whatever. All right. Okay. Taking a break at, why am I saying I'm taking a break? Because you're not going to hear the brake is just gonna come right back. You know, see, watch.

Speaker 2:          00:48:28       Oh, look at that. And I'm back just like dad. And it didn't take any time out of your life, just like a fucking extra point, just like an extra point. Um, I was actually sitting there waiting for the questions to come in, um, for my buddy to send them to me. And um,

Speaker 1:          00:48:44       I saw that stupid commercial. Have you seen their commercial? The Ah, no, no. Drinking and driving commercial with the dog is sitting there waiting for his master to come home and it's sitting there and the dude doesn't come home. So they make you think that all, maybe he died in the drink and drive and or whatever. And then the kid comes home in the morning,

Speaker 2:          00:49:01       he's like, you know, hey a fluffy, he couldn't drive last night, but I'm home. No, what are you doing? You know, I just want the dog to be like, Hey, yeah dude, it's great you came back. But I Fyi, I took a shit in the kitchen. You know, you haven't been home for like fucking 15 hours, so don't even look at me like that. I peed on the carpet. I shit in the kitchen and I need to go out right now and I need some fucking food. All right, next time you're gonna to go out pose. And how about leaving some food out? Maybe some water, you know.

Speaker 3:          00:49:33       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:49:34       Jesus Christ. Every time you fucking come home I greet you like he accomplished something. Even if he just went to the store, it would it kill you to leave out some food but it fucking kill you. Um, anyways, you can't do that anyways cause fucking dogs would eat all of it in two seconds. And then Yak, if he left out 15 hours worth of food, they'd have it done in 15 seconds because that's what they do because they're dogs.

Speaker 2:          00:49:57       They're fucking animals. All right, let's read some questions for the week. A stinky coworker, a, uh, Billy switchblade. I work in a small office with another girl who was really nice and helpful, helpful. Her and I share a small cubicle and I've noticed since the first day she does not shower and she smells like B. Oh. Oh Jesus. Oh Gee gauge. Um, anyway, since we are so close together for eight hours a day, it seems to be ruining my concentration. My question is, how do I tell her to get rid of the smell without offending her or without getting my boss involved? It seriously is making me think about switching jobs. Thanks for the help. Big Fan of your comedy and the podcast. Ps, go fuck yourself, dude. I don't know.

Speaker 3:          00:50:51       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:50:52       If it was a dude, you could just say it. How do you say it to a lady?

Speaker 3:          00:50:57       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:50:57       All right, well let's, let's just brainstorm here by the way. 21, 19 and they go for two points. Seattle, La, where they don't get it.

Speaker 3:          00:51:06       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:51:07       They don't get it.

Speaker 1:          00:51:10       Yeah. It keeps a fucking, just 21, 19. Seattle's gonna win this fucking game. Anyways, let's see. What the fuck would I say? Hey, listen, I'm not trying to be a jerk. You know, you know, I love you. I love working with you and everything, but uh, you know, you just Kinda, I don't know, how do I put this? You just kind of like smell really bad. I mean, how the fuck do you, there's no way to say it, dude. You stink. Hey, listen, let me try this one. Hey, listen, semantic, come here for a second, you know. No, that's close enough. Uh, come over here, but stay there if you know what I mean. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:52:01       I want to hose you down. I, what the fuck do you say? I don't know what to say. You fucking smell. There's no way to say it. Like, listen,

Speaker 3:          00:52:09       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:52:09       I hate to be the one to tell you this, but you don't smell good. You need to bathe more often. You're coming in here and you smell like body odor. Ah, dude, there's not, there's no way to fucking do it. There's no way. The only way you do it is you go to your boss and then you look like a bitch.

Speaker 3:          00:52:30       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:52:30       Or

Speaker 2:          00:52:32       You, you can go passive aggressive.

Speaker 3:          00:52:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:52:37       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:52:40       You could just bring in like a ridiculous, not, you go out and you buy a bunch of

Speaker 1:          00:52:44       air freshness. All right. And he just stick an air freshener in the cubicle. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:52:51       And if she doesn't get the hint the next day you have to air fresheners. Wednesday there's three. You get the point right? And you just keep bringing in more and more air fresheners until she finally takes the bait and says,

Speaker 1:          00:53:07       why do you have all those air fresheners? Why do you keep putting all these air fresheners in there and it without saying a word? You look at her, you hold your nose, and then you just pointed her and then that's it. And then you turn back around and you go back to work like it. Like it never happened. And then when she runs out of the cubicle crying, you quickly take all of the air fresheners. You throw them in the basket, he tie him off, you hand them to a coworker who's obviously Ben informed, you know of what to do. You handed off to them and they sprint to the fucking trash bin and they throw it out. No one, the boss shows up and says, why did you tell old fucking stink toast over here that she smelled? Uh, you like, I never said that. I never said anything. I know w w and she says you have a bunch of air fresheners. There are no air fresheners here, sir. I do not know what you're talking about. And he just fucking deny all of it.

Speaker 3:          00:54:07       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:54:07       Did you at any point pinch your nose and point in her direction? I have no recollection of any type of behavior. I was at my cubicle doing my job. Did anyone hear him pinch his nose in point in her? Absolutely not. No one can hear that, sir. Even if he did in you're covered. You just have to realize at that point you're going to be trashing a year working friendship.

Speaker 4:          00:54:36       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:54:37       What if you just went out and you bought some ladies Deodorant, right? And he put a little pink bow on it and when she walked in you bowed your head and genuflect it as you held it up to her.

Speaker 3:          00:54:49       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:54:49       I'm trying to think of a nice way of telling somebody that they stink a female.

Speaker 4:          00:54:56       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:54:59       All right. Here's another one where you get like your other coworkers involved.

Speaker 4:          00:55:04       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:55:06       It's like throwback sports fan day and you just sign, everybody's going to do the wave. All right. And then the one person conducting them also has this little spray bottle of perfume oil rig comes by her for be like, Hey, she raises her thing. Like people on either side just spray perfume into our armpits really quickly and then everybody runs away now than ever. She'd start crying again. Just ask her. Just say, listen, is there a way for me to tell you that you have body odor that won't make you cry? Is there a way for me to do that? How quick is there anything worse since when somebody puts you in a position to have to fucking do that,

Speaker 4:          00:55:48       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:55:51       oh my God, you fucking stink. You know what's the worst is the air freshener thing? Cause there's going to be this, this tipping point where the air freshener in the BIA or con or are competing for your fucking sense of smell. And if you can somehow tough your way through that day without puking, you're a better man than me.

Speaker 4:          00:56:07       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:56:10       Is there anything worse than when you're watching your own fucking team and a guy catches a ball and you just watching the quarterback, so to just escort him down the field, it's like at any point are you going to try to take a proper angle or at least dive at their fucking what are you doing? Sorry. Alright. [inaudible] animal research. Uh, Dear Bill Nye the scientifically illiterate guy. Ooh, he got clever there, everybody. Um, all right. I'm curious if you have any thoughts on performing research on lab animals for the benefit of humans. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:56:48       we're not talking about testing lipstick on bunnies here, but serious medical research using flies, mice, primates and other animal models of devastating human diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's disease. I bring this up as I recently made the difficult decision to leave a prestigious genetic lab, Nobel peace, a Nobel prize winning researcher. No Shit. Real deal during my phd training as I couldn't rationalize subjecting mice to painful procedures and an all around shit life anymore. I am currently refocusing my career to only performing research on human patients that give informed consent. This decision has already helped me sleep better at night. So what do you think through the costs of animal suffering, ultimately justify the means of increasing our knowledge of human disease? Let's get fucking philosophy philosophical here. Thanks for your comedy and the podcast. Best regards. All right. First off, uh, I take back making funny. If you're Bill Nye the scientifically literate guy, sometimes it pisses me off when I know morons are writing me just as dumb as I am, and then they're going to make fun of me for being dumb. But you, with your background, you had the right to do that. So my apologies. All right. Secondly, secondly, who would know better than somebody who actually did the job? There's no way I could fucking do that job, but selfishly I reap the benefits of it. I think what you're saying is ultimately the way we should do it, um,

Speaker 1:          00:58:18       is that it should be human beings making an informed decision that they want to be tested. And uh, you know what? They'd still figure out something evil. They go to the third world and they would find people don't have a fucking pot to piss in. And they would somehow flimflam them and get them to sign some shit that they didn't even know what the fuck they was signing. But, uh, that's what human beings do. But yeah, I would say that, uh, yeah, we should not be doing that. We shouldn't be doing most of what we're doing. Um, and then a lot of times I think, you know, I go back and forth on, you know, whether we, um, being a vegetarian or eating meat, I just love the way steak tastes and chicken and all that shit. But I definitely think that, uh, you know, we shouldn't, shouldn't be killing as many animals as we do or if we're going to, you gotta be like raising them like cattle and then you kill them.

Speaker 1:          00:59:18       I Dunno, but I don't know. I saw something recently about how Vivian Campbell, who's been playing in Def Leppard for awhile has cancer. And, um, so I was reading up on him and I saw a picture of Def Leppard and what are they guitars? The guy with the short hair who's been in the band forever. He standing there in his fifties, shirtless in the guys absolutely fucking shredded. So I'm like, what the fuck is this guy though? And I looked it up and for the last 20 years he quit Busan and he's eating a Vegan diet and he's kind of on a mission to, uh, tell people that you know, that you can get shredded and be fucking ripped eating vegetarian and all that type of stuff. So that fascinates the hell out of me because as much as I love cigars, I love booze and steak and all that type of stuff.

Speaker 1:          01:00:09       You definitely feel fucking awful. Afterwards, the next day hung over. He got that cigar fucking awful taste in your mouth and you know, and eat a steak dinner. Especially if you have like the taters and you eat it with something that you know, it's going to be difficult to digest. You fucking, you just need to take a nap. But if you eat a vegetarian meal, you'll, yeah, I don't know. I always still feel light and I feel fucking energized. I feel I might, I'm in a great mood and it's one of those things where like, I know that I should be doing that most of the time. I just Kinda like doing the wrong thing more of the time. Um, and also I'm stuck in my ways and I'm too lazy to read up on a,

Speaker 4:          01:00:59       you know,

Speaker 1:          01:01:00       learning vegetarian dishes. Like tonight I'm going out and I'm getting a pork chop. I know. Yeah. Yeah. I've been thinking about it all fucking day and I'm going to smoke a cigar later. I already know doing that. But every once in a while while I'm doing it, I pictured myself 30 years in the, in the future, sitting on one of those hospital examine her things. You know what the fucking, that frontal covering smoke with my ass hanging out the back, waiting for the doctor to come back and I'll start thinking about all the pork chops and cigars. I smoked and I'm thinking, I don't want to be that guy either. So I gotta I gotta do something here. Um, but getting back to what you say, yeah, no, I don't think that they should do it. Um, ultimately, no. I think that the fact that we've always put human life ahead of everything else is why there's 7 billion people on the planet and the polar ice caps are melting. Now, do I have any sort of background to make that statement? Absolutely not, but that's what podcasting is all about. So go fuck yourself. All right. Calls after a date. [inaudible] Hello William. I went out on a date with a girl. Congratulations. We both seem to have a great time. Uh, at the end of the date, she initiated the hug and yes.

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       What I asked if she wanted to go out again. That's wonderful. Well, I called her a few days after the date and left a message. No callback. Texted. I texted her the day after. No reply. Should I give her a few days to reply or move on? Move on, dude. Move on. Abso-Fucking-Lutely move on. And a, that sounds like somebody who doesn't know how to say, Hey, I had a great time, but I don't want to see you again. I think you, you know, what does it say? You asked her? Uh, yeah, you asked if she wanted to go out again. She probably initiated the hug so he wouldn't try to kiss her. And then she just said what you wanted to hear so she could get the fuck out of there. And that's what I would guess. But uh, either way, who gives a fuck? You asked her out. She said yes. You know, you're in the game. You know, they're not all going to be hits, but if you bat 300, you make the fucking all star team. Don't ever forget that. So keep, keep swinging away. Their buddy, they fuck. Oh, um, all right. Oh Jesus. I thought that whole was going to go on forever. Should I dumper uh, dear Barbara Rasa

Speaker 2:          01:03:36       the fuck does that mean and hopefully Nia to, um, I'm in a fucked up situation right now. I've been dating this chick for the past six months and it's been going fine and Dandy until a few days ago we were at the house having crazy sex, but just as she was about to climax, she kind of yelled her ex's name. Fuck you. That did not happen. I'm calling bullshit. Get the fuck Outta here, dude. That's hilarious. That is fucking not only what I have laughed, I would have kept fucking her until she was done. I just be like, Hey, look, I understand. Sorry. I'm getting on a cough drop here. I understand. You know, you're not ready. You're not ready to get into a relationship, but you're ready to fuck somebody else. That sounds like a perfect situation for me. I don't give a fuck. Yell out anybody's name. You want to, I'll ghost write this fucking this blowjob. I don't give a fuck.

Speaker 2:          01:04:42       Sorry. Jesus Christ. Um, anyways, uh, he goes on to say I was dressed up and just left and we haven't talked since. Now I know for a fact that she can't be cheating on me because her x is dead. He died like two. Oh Jesus. He died like two years ago when they were still together. My rational side is telling me that I'm a dick and should just forgive her, but my instincts are telling me, fuck that bitch. What should I do best regards from Italy? Oh, first of all, uh, I can't, I had a great time. I was in Italy, went to

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       Rome. I can't wait to come back. I know rob was kind of like, uh, the basic place you go when you first went there, but this is the first place ever when I learned to see the column a, the Coliseum, where else should I go? Milan, Florence, Venice. Where should I go? Person from Italy or anybody from Italy listening. Let me know where I should go. But getting back to your question, should you move on? Absolutely. She should always listen to your instincts. They're always right.

Speaker 3:          01:05:46       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:05:47       Are there, are there is a reason.

Speaker 3:          01:05:49       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:05:50       You know, there's a reason. I mean, dude, your rational side is telling you that you're a deck and you should forgive her, that there's nothing rational about that.

Speaker 3:          01:06:02       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:06:02       Let me ask you this, dude. If you were banging her, let's just say her name was Maria, right. And right as you can and you went, oh, and then they're like, what? What the fuck would she do? Do you think she'd be back with you? Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:06:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:06:17       Would you even question her if she didn't get back with you? You're totally agree with it. If she actually got back to you with you after you did that, when you be sitting there going, what the fuck is wrong with this person? How low is your self esteem that you're going to put up with that? And if you have low self esteem to that level, how many dicks had been in Europe? Ah, sorry. That's how guys stick. Yeah, Dude. No.

Speaker 3:          01:06:42       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:06:43       I only thing I would say is don't say fuck that bitch. She went through something unbelievably traumatic, you know, and Java c loved the guy. I feel bad for and so should you, but you shouldn't get your heart and mixed up in that shit. All right. That's what I would do. Um,

Speaker 3:          01:06:59       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:07:01       Yeah, they didn't add a very nice way. I would just say like, you know, I just don't think you're ready to be in a relationship.

Speaker 3:          01:07:08       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:07:10       Yeah. No matter what she says, you just hold it to the fact that you called out you're dead boyfriend's name when you had an orgasm. There's really no, uh, you should just stop talking and come in for the hug right now.

Speaker 3:          01:07:25       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:07:26       And I will not let go til you tell it too. I'm sorry.

Speaker 3:          01:07:36       Ah,

Speaker 1:          01:07:38       oh, big love. Until you say somebody else's name. Um, alright, let's plow ahead here. I'll tell you one last story. I did a benefit this weekend for a all simas. Now the joke he gave the officers would be like, for what? Alzheimer's for what? You see what I did there? You know that guy whenever you say, yeah, my grandmother is hard of hearing, he goes, what? You get it fucking joke book Larry. I fucking hate people that do that. Unless you're doing it because you know I hate it then I love you then that's funny. But if you're actually it for real, I, it just like gives me joke Douche chills. Like I, uh, oh my God. Look at the fucking tits on error. Whoa. What kind of an asshole is still brings a defense sign? The d and the fence. We get it. It was a funny joke and NFL films in the Seventies.

Speaker 3:          01:08:33       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:08:36       Holy Shit. Saint Louis is up 28, 19 with five 30 to go. What do they down by right now? Was that nine points? Seattle's got the ball. What do you think, Bill? I think if they didn't win the Superbowl last year, they would actually win this game. But I got a feeling they probably lost too many guys that they're going to come up just short. Oh, there he goes. Russell Wilson. I just don't see the rams being able to hold on though. I got to root for the underdog. Oh, pills. Quit being a bitch. Just pick a team. You know what I say? I say fucking Seattle comes back. They come back now that they're past midfield, GI bill really going down in Olympia. Anyways, so I did this, uh, I did this benefit for Alzheimer's for y and um,

Speaker 1:          01:09:39       it was for a, Seth Rogen put it together. It was just fucking amazing. Lineup. And, um, I didn't realize, I mean usually what do you do? Those fucking things. Nine Times out of 10, they're fucking, ah, they're outside and it sucks. And it's a bunch of fucking, you know, rich people walking around, trophy wives with their red bottom shoes and nobody paying attention. And then it's a benefit. So if he call them assholes, then you're the counter or whatever. Um, I actually, uh, it was not outside. It was at the palladium, right on sunset strip. And that's actually where Richard Pryor recorded a live on the sunset strip, you know, way back in, I think around 1980. He did it and it was a bucket list of mine too, at some point do a show there. And uh, it was so fucking amazing to be able to perform that. Unfortunately, I was really sick, so I couldn't be as social as I want it to be. But um, it's fucking awesome. Show Craig Robinson and his band,

Speaker 3:          01:10:47       uh,

Speaker 1:          01:10:49       with a house band and they will hilarious. Plus an awesome band. And um, Seth hosted the thing.

Speaker 3:          01:10:57       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:10:57       And, uh, what the fuck was appointed? My God damn story. Weird. Al Yankovic was on it. Sarah Silverman was just a fucking awesome show. And um, I can't remember what the point in my fucking story was, was the point of my story just was awesome to form there that it was a good cause. Oh my God, it was for Alzheimer's. I'm literally doing the joke. Um, let me see what happens to somebody's brain. Fuck of works. I started watching the rams Seattle game cause it's getting exciting. It's Russell Wilson rods for a foul. They stopped.

Speaker 3:          01:11:32       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:11:33       I fucked in a, I don't know what I'm talking about it anymore. Anyways, I want to thank Seth Rogen, um, but put me on the show. Uh, I had a great time. Anytime, you know, anytime he wants me to do something like that I'll definitely do it cause I'm such a fucking asshole and I lived such a great life and I'm still a dick that I need to do benefits to somehow balance out my Karma. Um,

Speaker 3:          01:11:55       okay,

Speaker 1:          01:11:57       I'll definitely do it. But anyways, it was a fucking amazing.

Speaker 3:          01:12:00       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:12:00       What's amazing about that? Places it's still looks

Speaker 3:          01:12:03       okay

Speaker 1:          01:12:04       like the prior special when you walk in there, even if you didn't know, um, that they, uh, recorded it there.

Speaker 3:          01:12:11       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:12:12       Get the fuck Outta here. He goes. Seattle all the way down to the nine yard line. St Lowest. Same Old fucking rams. Come on. I always got to root for the underdog, but my money says Seattle. Jesus. Fuck. Ah, the guy slips on the turf.

Speaker 3:          01:12:29       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:12:29       Um, anyways, it was fucking amazing. And um, I'm hoping to someday do my own show there. That is definitely one of the bucket list I'd ever read. Told you guys the bucket list. Uh, theaters, they're all just, staters were my favorite. Standup specials were recorded. I already got to do constitution hall where, uh, Eddie Murphy delirious was, um,

Speaker 3:          01:12:53       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:12:53       And then the palladium is Richard Pryor live on the sunset strip. And then there's a theater in Long Beach. I don't know what it's called now, but that's where the greatest one was. Richard Pryor, uh, live, uh, live in concert. That one I want to perform there. Whoever bill Cosby did, Bill Cosby himself. I can't remember where that was. I did Carnegie Hall. That's where Lenny Bruce and George Carlin voltage specials. Well, Lenny Bruce was an album. Um,

Speaker 3:          01:13:25       okay,

Speaker 1:          01:13:26       where else I want to do red rocks.

Speaker 3:          01:13:29       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:13:29       I did stand up there one time, but it was before a, uh, like a film thing. Um, and that place was unbelievably cool, was not a good show, you know, that was outside and everybody was here to see the movies and then they just brought me out. No one knew who the fuck I was and I sort of survived it, but it was still cool to perform there. Um, so I got a bunch that I want to do. Oh, I know. Uh, I want to do whatever. Sam Kinison did, his standup special on the sunset strip, which I don't think it was at the Roxy. I want to do a show there. Um, whatever. I have all these, these different things. But anyways, let's, let's close out here by talking about patriots jets, but, but

Speaker 2:          01:14:13       Bordeaux, Bordeaux, um, that was fucking ridiculous that we were actually able to win that Goddamn game. And I felt vindicated by watching that where all my friends was trying to say that the patriots turned around and that, that team that I saw that got pounded by the chiefs that now somehow they're not that team there, this team this week. And I was trying to say no, they are somewhere in the fucking middle. Um,

Speaker 3:          01:14:46       okay.

Speaker 2:          01:14:47       And uh, I dunno, statistically we didn't deserve the win the fucking gay by a long shot. I guess that was the first time anybody ever controlled the ball for more than 40 fucking minutes and still lost the game, you know. Uh, as much as I want to credit the Patriots' defense that we stopped them in the red zone, I felt that they were stopping themselves a lot with bad fucking penalties and shit like that. Um,

Speaker 3:          01:15:13       okay.

Speaker 2:          01:15:13       And I got to admit, as much as I can't stand rex Ryan because I think he talks a bunch of shit.

Speaker 3:          01:15:21       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:15:21       Where he has a good team and I thought he was really disrespectful to a lot of people around the fucking league. I still think he's a great coach and um,

Speaker 3:          01:15:31       okay.

Speaker 2:          01:15:31       If they shifted jets didn't fire him and wanted to start all over again because he's not the GM of the team, so he doesn't get to pick the players. As far as I know. I think the guy,

Speaker 3:          01:15:46       yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:15:46       I think he's a good coach, is not a lot of good coaches out there. I think he's a good coach to the jets. Just fucked up with their player personnel or whatever. Um,

Speaker 3:          01:15:56       okay.

Speaker 2:          01:15:57       I Dunno that guy. I think that that guy, if he gets fired, that's a, that's still a good pickup. Even though I don't like the way he conducts himself when he has a good team and he talks all that shit. Nah, I dunno. It just always clearly comes across to me.

Speaker 3:          01:16:11       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:16:12       That you're insecure when you talk like that level of Shit. Do you know what I mean? Like up, my wife watches his fucking reality show.

Speaker 3:          01:16:22       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:16:23       I don't know if it's called love and hip hop. I don't know what it is, but it's this chick who has like this re ridiculous fake fucking tits and a ridiculous fake fucking ass. She looks ridiculous. And she walks around talking about herself like she's fucking God's gift and I'm sitting there watching this shit.

Speaker 3:          01:16:47       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:16:47       And I said to my wife, I was like, do you realize how truly fucking stupid you would have to be to be that confident to just be walking around like that, thinking that you're the be all end all and that you fucking know everything. Like how truly fucking stupid you would have to be. Cause whenever I listen, people who act like that, you're either unbelievably insecure and you're trying to overcompensate it or you just unbelievably fucking naive. You're a fucking moron. So that allows you to be that confident. And then every once in awhile you'll meet somebody who just

Speaker 2:          01:17:28       is just the man and they're confident and they fucking know it. You know what I mean? Which to me is like 1% of the population, basically that benchmark person that everyone's trying to be. Then when they're that fucking confident, you know, it fucking makes sense as far as confident, but only confident as far as like what it is that you do. Like, if you're an athlete or an actor or a musician, or you're running a business, like, you know, you're the best at it, you know you're the best and you're fucking confident that I understand. But just straight across the board, walking around like you're the shit and you know, you, you like moving planets and shit with your mind, like walking around like you fucking know everything. Let's just, how fucking truly dumb you have to be. Um, to be that confidence. So I could never get into directs. Ryan, when he was talking all that shit, I'm like, this fucking guy is actually good at what he does, his job. But I don't know if it was cause he has to live up to his dad or whatever. I just feel like this guy's beyond fucking insecure and it's uncomfortable to watch. And uh,

Speaker 2:          01:18:30       I dunno. I Dunno. He just, I don't know. He just always looked like if you punched him in the belly, he'd cry and make like that Pillsbury doughboy knows noise. You know what I mean? Those noise, I dunno, I'm fucking rambling at this point. Go fuck yourselves. All right. That's a podcast for this week. Um, thank you for everybody who's been listening. Uh, I'm site the new hours common to get,

Speaker 4:          01:18:54       no,

Speaker 2:          01:18:56       it was looking bleak. I've been writing on this show. I haven't been getting the stage time. I wanted to. I've got a couple in there, a couple reps. All of a sudden you've got the Ebola thing coming out. I got some new material. It ties into some other bullshit, couple of random thoughts and it's all starting to come together and I can't wait. I got a gig coming up down in, um, down in Florida because I'm going down for the FSU. Whoa. No, no, no. I'm playing against a University of Miami and, uh, Oh, 28, 26. Sherman just knocked down, uh, just knocked down a pass. And believe it or not, he walked around nodding his head, uh, as quickly as one possibly could. He can't believe how good he is. He just can't, he can't find, can't get over himself. The guy is in awe of themself and that's always fun to be around. Um, all right, listen, that's a podcast for this week. Go fuck yourselves. All right. Cowboy's giant's my prediction. They had the lost Victor Cruz.

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       All right, I'm going to go. I'll make a gambling prediction. Not even knowing what the fucking spread is. Rams with a first down rams with the first down. Where's Sherman now? Nodding his head. Oh wait, now the rams guy is not in his head and he's walking around. Everybody can't believe how awesome they are. Five. Jesus Christ. Oh wait, no, I'm sorry. It was a fake fucking pun. That was the punter. Hilarious. The putter is walking or can't fucking believe how awesome he is. I knew it. I knew I was better than this position.

Speaker 3:          01:20:42       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:20:43       I used to do a joke about that way back in my way back in the day that I was going to start celebrating after fucking jokes worked. Like they way that the way they do when the NFL, when you run for a first down, you start stomping around like Jerome Bettis. Um, anyways, I'm rambling at this point. Uh,

Speaker 1:          01:21:01       by the way, oh, you Fsu people. Okay. I know I'm coming down on your team, but you guys really need to come up with a couple more songs. Okay? Before you give me shit, because I performed at your school. I had a great time at your fucking school, but you know what? You know I had a great time because you guys showed up and during my fucking show you weren't going to be fucking two seconds. All right? So don't be a bunch of whiny cuts about the constructive criticism that I'm giving you. I'm not saying stop doing the Tomahawk Chop. That's up for the date of Americans to try to fucking enlighten me about that. But why don't you get a couple, you know, switch it up. P did he come down there and do maybe a couple remixes on the same fucking idea? You know, just to, you know, just for the viewer at home. Anyways, that's the podcasts. Go fuck yourselves. We'll talk to you next week.
