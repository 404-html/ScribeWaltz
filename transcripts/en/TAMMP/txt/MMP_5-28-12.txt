Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill bar and it's the Monday morning podcast for Monday, May 28th, 2012. How's it going? Wow, I'm happy. Memorial Day. Um, thanks to all the troops, you know, that's what you're supposed to do today, right? Anybody and you still recovering from the cookout, your cookout for the troops, your 12 pack to the head for the fucking heroes. I don't give a shit what a holiday is. I don't give a fuck what is for. Eventually enough years goes by and it's just an excuse to become a tub of shit and drink a 12 pack, you know, and get all your feelings off your chest. You know, all that shit that you've been hammering about the person that you with. You know, a few weeks ago somebody was asking me, Ah, you know, they wanted to break up with somebody and I was saying, listen, you gotta listen.

Speaker 1:          00:01:02       You know, the person who has it down how to do the breakup was minivan men, podcasts, own celebrity star Al Madrigal. But if you don't have time to email Al Madrigal just listened to ll cool j a big old, but I don't know why. I never really listened to him when I was growing up. You know, Mama said knock you out. Oh, did she? Is that what she said? Ll Cool J I don't care. You know, I just wasn't into it. And his deodorant and his armpits when he was jamming with those white guys. I just, I never got into it. But lately, lately I dunno. I Dunno what happened. I just just come onto my youtube shit. I don't know what it is, but I was listening to some of his stuff. Oh, I know why. Yesterday I was trying to remember like, what was that song he used to have that I'm the type of guy and you're the type of guy, he put Paprika, what the fuck was that?

Speaker 1:          00:02:04       And then I listened to it and I kind of liked it, but I hated that. Oh we, oh, part of it really annoyed me and my co that's why I never downloaded this shit. But then on the side, they had a ll cool j big old, but you know, I play drums at Michael. Let me hear what this tracks sounds like. Can I put it on? And he basically teaches you hide a breakup with a girl in that song, but that rap or that, uh, that rhyme, whatever, however you supposed to say it, he breaks it down and just in fucking 11 seconds, he sits his girls down. He's basically hanging out and like some sunglass hut or some shit and some girl comes in with an insane ass and he does what every guy does. He stares at and he thinks, I want to fuck that.

Speaker 1:          00:02:50       But Oh shit, I have a girlfriend. So what does he do? Does he sneak around on earth? No. He goes home and he sits her down. He says, listen, I met this girl named Tina. Okay. Tina's got a big old, but I know that I said I'd be true really whiteness up. But Tina got a big old butt. So I'm leaving you. It's, I mean, that's just fucking air tight. You can't fuck with that. He was 100% I don't know. She could get mad. I think that I think women's show expect guys to be lion weasely pieces of shit that if you actually hit him with that level of honesty, I think they would just be stunned. Just like the chicken, the video. Like I didn't think that that was bad acting. I think that they would absolutely be stunned if you just came home and said, listen, I met this girl. I know that I said it'd be faithful to you, but she's better looking than you, so I'm breaking up with you.

Speaker 2:          00:03:58       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:00       What is the comeback? There's nothing that'd be like if your girl came home and said, listen, I know we're together, but this guy, you know, I met him at the mall, is deck is twice the size of yours and he's got a better car. So, uh, it's kind of a no brainer. Amada, what are you going to do? What are you gonna do with your little dick in your fucking Domino's pizza? It's over. You just got to fucking be like, you know, you only go around once. So, uh, yeah, I, I, I get it. So anyway, so if you don't have time to email Al Madrigal, which you should, which you should just listen to a ll cool j big old bud.

Speaker 1:          00:04:46       You got to see his face. He goes, so I'm leaving you. It's, it's, I don't, can't explain it. It's way meaner than it has to be. That's what it makes it funny. Cause there's a way to read that where you're kind of letting them down easily, you know, but he didn't, he just did it like, yeah, this is how it works. So they, you go look at that on a holiday as you shaken off your fucking keystone lights that you drank for the troops, you know, you're fucking bong hits for the men and women in the Marine Corps that you took. Right? Flag Day's coming up. Everybody. Well we respect and honor all the flags of the world. Come on down and gets your Busch lite for Fuck Ed. $12 a fucking case. Uh, what the fuck would happen? What would the world be like if there was no way to get fucked up? If you couldn't get high, couldn't get drunk.

Speaker 1:          00:05:49       Jesus. How long would marriages last then? They'd probably be even shorter. Would they just be rage? Just sitting around fucking stone sober? Eight and strawberry shortcake could be horrific. Um, anyways, this is the Monday morning podcast. It is the end of May. Everybody. All right. How many days are in May? 30 days had that timber and stone is April and November. All the rest have a bunch of other dates except for February. Yeah. Go Fuck yourself with your song. Um, she got 30 31 fuck. What is it? April has 30 June has 30 maze. 31 I got the little thing. I can click right here. I'll have a computer. I don't need to think. All right, it has, why is it in September? Oh, for Christ sake, do I have to click another button? It has 31 days.

Speaker 1:          00:06:48       All right, so you had till have you guys have until Thursday midnight to make something of May, 2012 all right. Are you on a fucking relationship? You don't want to be in, do you want to be in this relationship? You don't want to be in, in June? Why don't you celebrate the end of May by getting out of your fucking relationship and sitting down and basically just go with the ll cool j vibe. Hold her hand and just go straight up honesty and then what? What's she gonna do? What's he gonna do? They're going to flip the fuck out, but the the die has been cast to ship is set sail. The ball is already rolling. The Sun is setting, the rain has fallen. Whatever the fuck you want to call it. It's out there. Just put it out there. Let him scream and yell and in your head.

Speaker 1:          00:07:41       As much as it sucks, you're going to be like, okay, I did it. I did it. Now I just got to sit here and get yelled at. And uh, how long can somebody really yell before they lose their voice and hour, 90 minutes and an hour and a half. I'm going to be in the car listening to ll cool j driving away from that thing. I didn't want to be in. All right. Now I know I talk about this shit a lot, but I think a lot of people are in situations like this and they don't know how to sit. Somebody dumb it just say, so I'm leaving you. You know, if I was ll cool j and I stopped, you know, selling tickets and all that type of shit, that would be a side business that I would have. I would take that little fucking rhyme that he had and I would custom do it for everybody in their life and just, and then people could just write you all right, I need to charge. You charge them 100 bucks and he would write you a, you know, four bars. It all rhymes and you just get out exactly what you say it, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:08:49       just be like you eat with your mouth open. I know I said that. That'd be true. But to eat with your mouth open so I'm leaving you just get right to you. Just get right down to it. The mom is a fucking con. I know. I said that I'd be true. What, she's fucking always coming over here and some of the rhymes with and I, you got, you got the idea right? Jesus Christ. What do I have to be yellow? Um, hang on a second. What the fuck just happened? Did I knock this out? All right, 10 minutes in. Look at that. That was an easy 10. It was a fucking easy 10. I actually, uh, actually bought a, I bought a new grill. I didn't get to grill. You know what I bought? I bought that fucking egg thing. Big Ceramic was like a giant fucking avocado, which sucks is I can't even talk about the shit that I bought cause I feel like now it feels like it's a commercial on this side. Um, they're not paying me to advertise. So what? So what I feel now you can't talk about them and see what happens. It's a catch 22.

Speaker 3:          00:09:56       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:09:57       Speaking of looking like a giant avocado, how bout those Boston Celtics, what up Philly? How, what'd you take? Did you really think that that was going to happen again? That you were going to go into Boston for a game? Seven on the fucking PLA k.

Speaker 3:          00:10:14       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:15       And that and that, that, that wasn't going to happen. I almost would park. Hey butter at that point, if I ever made that joke, you guys should have just fucking just unsubscribe. Unsubscribe. Is that how you say it? Um, Celtic speech, Philly. I actually watched a most of the game and then I had to go do my gig over at flappers. Um, so I had to listen to the rest on a, on the radio as I went over there, I got to tell you stuff that, you know, I'm not expecting the Celtics to win the championship. I know we're old, you know, but, uh, the officiating in the fucking NBA, I don't think in any other sport. I swear to God, do the reps just dictate the fucking pace and all that. And I know that I've had a fucking Tampon in my ass about this for a long time, but it's ridiculous.

Speaker 1:          00:11:09       Paul, let me ask you a question. What in the ever in any game ever forget about a game. Seven of an NBA playoff to go to the conference finals. Let's just say a regular season game in the middle of fucking December. Does Coby Bryan ever get called for a, does he ever fall out on a fucking charge? Is that call ever going to be made against that guy? I'm going to go with never. Right? Paul Pierce got five files ticky tack fall. They fall the guy out on a fucking charge. It's UN fucking believable. And just three days before, watch, hope Holby I watched Colby fucking hack a guy across both forearms, but that would have been his third foul in the second quarter and they would've had to sit the guy. And what did they do? They have a meeting. The reps have a meeting and they give it to some bumps standing next to them. It's just fucking, it's you to tell me the difference between the NBA officiating in the officiating and fucking wrestling. Okay. If you can do that, then

Speaker 1:          00:12:22       Jesus Christ. Sorry, did I just lose you guys on that one? Why don't you set the fucking recorder where it's supposed to be there, right down on the floor. It's just bring everything down here. There we go, Bill. Seriously, if you can do that, I will fucking, uh, I will go to your town and I will do karaoke. Um, and I'll sing whatever song you want me to sing. I'll do that ll cool j song and I'll wind it up. I know that I said that I would be true. Um, that's what, that's what kills me about the NBA. Okay. I fucking ever really been watching it because of the hangover and the devastation of seeing the Bruins getting knocked out and I got into it again. It's just like basketball is a fucking phenomenal game. It's a pure game, you know, fucking ball in a hoop, loving it.

Speaker 1:          00:13:10       If those fucking striped cuts would just get out of the way and stop taking out there fucking frustration that there's some 23 year old kid who's getting more pussy and it's worth millions of more dollars than you and your fucking footlocker outfit. So now you got to go around and just fucking Dick to you. I have power. I'm going to do what I want to do. I don't know if it's that shit or if it's fucking David Stern in their rare with the Bluetooth, whatever, whatever. So Hey, New Jersey's own, Paul Versey, he's been talking a lot of trash, you know, talking about Oklahoma City, you know, it's a WHO's, that's who he's picking. And I actually picked the spurs, you know, cause my whole theory that the spurs play, they play basketball, the way your dad fights, you know, and I think that that was evident and last night's game, you know, Oklahoma came out all fucking, you know, all young full of piss and vinegar running up and down the court or what do they do that they just started jogged after him.

Speaker 1:          00:14:12       I, I keep running, keep folks like that. And that movie colors that, that, that street joke with a papa bowl in the, in the, in his son, the son, both father and son bull standing on the hill and they're looking down at a bunch of cows and the sun goes, hey, let's run down the hill and go fuck one of those cows. And the dad goes, now let's walk down and fuck them all. All right, that's the spurs. Let's walk down, pick and roll and fuck them all. That's what they're going to do all the way to another NBA championship and they're still not going to get respect because they play in a city that nobody cares about. Okay. Mexicans don't even care about San Antonio. They don't. All right. That's just a little stop off that they have when they crossed the border before they go to like fucking, I dunno, l pass off. All right. It was a bad, that was a bad example. El Paso, I should've said a winter, were legal immigrants usually end up Denver. Come right up through Albuquerque, through Santa Fe, you know, run past Columbine and they go right into Denver, don't they? What does that, is that the 35 north

Speaker 1:          00:15:29       or zen out the 35 goes to Austin. This how much fucking road tribe, road drive and road traveling. I'd done it goes to 10 is the eight, then there's the 10 and there's a 40 and there's this 70, then there's the 80, then there's the 90. That's going east, west. Those are evens odds go north, south. Ah Fuck. I can't fucking remember anymore. I have gives a shit anyways. So what do you guys think? Can the Celtics lived through another round? Can they beat a, I like how they act like, because Chris Bosch is out of it. Like they don't still have Lebron James and uh, that guy with the little mouth.

Speaker 4:          00:16:17       What's that?

Speaker 1:          00:16:22       Dwayne Wade. What does with his fish lips? I don't understand. He looked like a fucking tuna that can dunk. Um, all right. What the fuck am I right now? I know I gotta I gotta do some advertising. I'm sorry. People I'm doing like, you know, like one of these days I'm actually going to, Nah, we'll get, I'm not even gonna lie to you. I was gonna say, you know, one of these days I'm going to get this thing into a studio and you know there's going to be the guy, the the fucking Baba booey guy who comes in or the fucking this guy. This is not happening. All right. It isn't, this is what it is. All right? It's just like ACDC his first album. Okay. Do you think that they were going to do something else? Now? This is what we're doing. Three chords kick in the cunt and a guitar solo and that's it. Go Fuck yourself with done until the next one comes out. That's what I'm doing with this. All right. I don't have time.

Speaker 1:          00:17:14       Yes, I do. I have. I have the time or I'm lazy. All right, well fuck you. You put shit off and your life's don't ya? All right, here's one for you, the man. Great.

And I'm sure that this will be made fun of some day on a show like the office.

Speaker 1:          00:18:05       They will somehow try and uh, just, they'll show a guy who's good on the grill, right?

All right, let's get back to the stuff here. Um, you know, lately I've been asking, I've been asking some of the ladies to write in and uh, finally, I haven't even read this yet, but this already seems like gold. This is, this is the, the on the subject line of this email it says, I think the guy I'm dating is a pussy.

Speaker 1:          00:21:02       Hello Bill. I am a 21 year old student. I began listening to your podcast recently and I heard you complaining about how women have not written in on awhile and being a woman myself decided to do so and ask you for advice. Well, God bless you. Uh, I live at home with my mom and go to college. I recently found a very nice guy. Uh, they were college and was really into them, but then I started suspecting something strange. I started suspecting that maybe he was a pussy. At first I thought it was pretty harmless, but then one night we had a house party and everyone was pretty drunk. And a friend of mine who I haven't seen in a while was there and when everyone was way, way, way past drunk, she tried to get into a fight with me and eventually pushed me down the wall, then stole my iPhone and he was there and did nothing. Jesus Christ. I was so scared that I called my ex to come get me any did.

Speaker 5:          00:22:04       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:22:05       Wow. Uh, you think you're dating a pussy? I mean that right there g and he just stood there and let this other guy who used to hook up with you come in riding in on his white horse.

Speaker 1:          00:22:20       Anyways, my ex was more of a man than the guy was dating now, even though the guy I'm dating was drunk, I felt like he should have protected me or done something, anything. He did nothing. And later he even confessed to me that he was scared of my drunk friend and even scared of me. What the fuck? Right. Even though he says this will never happen again. I have enough knowledge to know that people do do not usually change like that. You know? That's a really wise that you're really wise for your age at 21, if you, if you're already not buying into the, I'm going to change. That's a, you're, you're wise beyond your years. You know, they say that you're basically, your psychological makeup is done by the time you three. So if you see some little toddler standing, there was somebody is taking his blocks, that kid's going to be a pussy anyways, so should I be upset or give him another chance? Is this a deal breaker? Is there no way to change a guy from a pussy to a real man? Should I just break things off with him and if so, should I remain friends with him? Thanks, Bill. I hope you read this. Uh, I love you and Nia. Oh, that's nice. Um, all right. This is the deal.

Speaker 5:          00:23:38       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:38       Uh, you asking a question? Is there no way to change a guy from a pussy to a real man?

Speaker 5:          00:23:44       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:23:45       no, I don't

Speaker 5:          00:23:46       think, I think that that happens. I think it happens way more in movies where somebody has a life changing moment. Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:23:57       and then they just decide I'm not gonna take shit anymore. But even then, that just begins the journey of not being a pussy. You don't just say, I'm not going to be a posting and Bam, you're not a pussy anymore. You have, you got to work your way up. It's like if you were a hundred pounds overweight and you like this, I'm done. I'm not eating fucking ice cream anymore. The next day you don't have a six pack, you know, it takes a fucking year or something. You really got to turn it around. So, um,

Speaker 1:          00:24:26       I dunno, what are you looking for in a guy? I mean, I think the fact that you're writing me and you're saying, I think the guy I'm dating as a pussy, I mean that, that actually hurts me on some level just because I insert myself into this story and the person updating would be calling me a pussy or it could it be the ex, I guess. I don't know. This isn't about me. This is about you come up, you'll stop being selfish. Alright. Um, I think you've totally, Ross lost respect for this guy. And if you don't respect the person you're with, eventually you're going to blow somebody else. You know, if you don't break up with this guy, that's what I'm predicting. If you don't break up with this guy, you just going to cheat on him just to facilitate getting out of the relationship because uh,

Speaker 5:          00:25:11       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:25:13       you know, to get to that ll cool j moment, we can just be fucking honest. But I don't think you'll like that was something about you knowing that people don't change at your age and the fact that you like, you know, this guy's a pussy, he's not sticking up for me. And the fact that he didn't stick up for you and then you took charge and say, well, I'm going to fucking call somebody who will, I mean, technically you should have fucked your ex boyfriend that night and he, and he shouldn't have been mad. He should have been like any, he probably wouldn't have been because he's a pussy. I ain't no, I understand. I mean, you know, when you needed a big swinging Dick, I mean, God knows it wasn't me. So, uh, yeah. Um, I think if you don't break up with this guy, you're actually fighting nature. All right? And you guys are wired to, to, I know you guys aren't wired to have kids with pussies. You know what I mean? You want a strong sun, right? You don't know, you know what that Pussy Dna and your kid, right? All that's going to kill you. Imagine that you have a kid with this guy and you want this kid to be like a, like your ex boyfriend and it comes down and it's like this fucking little wormy worm guy.

Speaker 1:          00:26:28       Ah, that'd be awful. Walking down the aisle to marry this guy with dead sheepish. And usually these years, you know what dad, you want this guy to be the man standing down there and a white Tuxedo like fucking Roger Moore James Bond. I think I, uh, look, I don't know if this just happened and you're really upset. So, uh, you know, and like, and in three days you're not going to care and you're going to go back to having a picnic with this guy because for all I know, your ex who came coming back, maybe you broke up with him because he cheated on you. Maybe he was too much of a guy, if you know what I mean.

Speaker 1:          00:27:07       So then you said, well, all right, I'm going to, maybe I'm this next time I'm dating a nice guy. He's now, he dated a nice guy. The thing about is sometimes you date a nice guy. They can be so nice that they're pussies. Alright, and look, I'm not, I'm not sitting there acting like, you know, if I'm out with my girl in some fucking 200 pounds, 300 pounds jacked fucking 25 year old comes up and starts doing shit that I'm going to start swinging because I'm not, I'm not, I'm not getting my fucking head kicked in just for the fuck of it. No. You know what I mean? I mean, it's not like just,

Speaker 1:          00:27:44       you know, straight across the board as a guy, you have to fucking go and get yet God damn head kicked in. But this was a fucking woman. This was a lady. I mean he, Jesus, it is a weird situation in defense of him where, how do you get the fucking iPhone back? You start wrestling with her and now you're kind of fucking throwing a girl around so you're looking at that possible assault charge cause God knows that's how the world worked. Works right now, your honor. I was trying to steal a phone and he, this guy is salted me and you're gonna be sitting there going, she was stealing a phone and they're not gonna be able to get past your, you're a guy and she's a girl. But um, yeah, he should have just, he should've just held there by the back of her pants so she couldn't leave and just stayed out of reach of her swinging.

Speaker 1:          00:28:40       That's what you do. If you're in that situation as a guy, he just reached out, you grabbed by the back of their pants and you just start running in a circle until cops get there. So they can't swing at you. That running backwards. I mean, I don't know what you, you get. You got to fucking do something and he didn't do anything. That's the big thing that if you told him, honestly, if you told me that this was some giant guy who could kick the shit out of him, uh, I wouldn't say that the guy's a pussy. You know what I mean? I mean, what is the point of going in and getting a concussion? Getting your tooth driven up through your fucking nose. The guys still gonna leave with your phone. You know, let's set old Richard Pryor. Bit Macho, man. I'll take that knife and stick it up your ass macho man.

Speaker 1:          00:29:23       It's like, no, you're going to get the shit kicked out of you. But this was a woman. All right. Pill for fuck sakes. Quit. You have God damn rambling. Wrap it up. Um, I think you know what you want to do when you should do it. Um, you are dating a pussy. The fact that when he was sober, he said that he was scared of her and a view. Uh, he seems like he's a little for limped and uh, I just can't imagine there's going to be a stereotype, but a guy like that actually putting it on you in the bedroom. I really don't. He probably stares at you and the I, am I hurting you? Is Everything okay? God, you're so beautiful. I mean, come on. Alright. Flip her over and wash your face and the pillows. I'm always, she says in ps, don't worry.

Speaker 1:          00:30:07       Uh, that con I used to call a friend who pushed me and took my phone is no longer in my life. She gets your phone back. Well, what happened with you guys? Now wait a minute. What can I hear the followup here? There's so many different ways that this could be gone. Was that like a girl? Like when you thought that maybe you were a swing in another way and all of a sudden you broke up with her and, uh, uh, probably not. It's just my own red shoe diary kind of fucking thing. So anyways, um, what are we 30 minutes in and the Monday morning podcast? Um, I gotta I gotta give a little shout out here to our flappers comedy club in Burbank, California. This city that Johnny Carson made famous. Um, I had a fucking unbelievably great time this weekend. I did four shows out there Friday, Saturday night.

Speaker 1:          00:31:02       It's the perfect size club. They couldn't have been more friendly. They'll all, the shows were packed. I was working out my new hour and um, it was great. I was working with a Chelsea Peretti Sacramento zone, Chelsea Peretti. She was Hella funny as they say up there. Um, yeah, she was fucking great. She's sang some ridiculous line about Michael Bolton backstage, like just fucking around. And I said to her, you got to do that on stage. You got to do that on stage, right? So most people go, oh, I can't do the youth. The youth came up with it and the big keep looking do, she went up and she did it and closed with it and it was just one of those, one of those weekends. It just, I don't know, you'd have to be a comedian to understand how much that like gets you going to be like, all right, I'm going to go up and go try some shit if she's just going to go fucking sink some fucked up in line about Michael Bolton, what?

Speaker 1:          00:32:00       I'm going to go up there and, and pussy out of my jokes, my, the new things that I want to try. So, um, I was psyched. I feel like I already got, I have a solid 25 minutes towards my new hour where I can actually, you know, run my mouth and not do anything on the special that's coming up because that's basically the game you do. You take the special the second it's done. You then have from whenever you finish taping too, when the new one comes out to somehow come up with an hour of shit that you can say to a crowd and they won't demand their money back. So I

Speaker 6:          00:32:40       have until October and I figure, I feel like I'm already halfway there, you know, this time next week I'm actually going to go out with a buddy of mine. Uh, you know, I never wrote a motorcycle. My life is going to teach me how to do it. I know what you guys are thinking. Ah, motorcycle fucking just go by the coffin with and I'm not a dirt bikes. Just gonna ride it. Fucking dirt bike. Just cause I want to learn how to fucking ride one. Do you know what I mean? Just for that, uh, macgyver moment. This too. There's a couple things I want to learn how to do. I want to fucking learn how to ride a motorcycle and maybe fly a helicopter just so I have my, you know, just in case if I'm ever in some Jason Bourne kind of situation.

Speaker 4:          00:33:26       Okay.

Speaker 6:          00:33:27       You ever think about that shit was great about action. Fucking heroes is I don't give a fuck what vehicle it is. I don't care if it can fly. If it's on the water, if it's a fucking dump truck, if it's a God damn tank, it's just a fucking hovercraft. Those sons of bitches, not only did they have time to be trained in every form of martial arts, swords, weaponry, guns, anything. They know how all that works and they can drive every fucking vehicle known to man. You know, you got to do that. You got to, as a guy, you got to make your or a woman, right as a girl. Remember that when he used to spell it, G R R l because you guys weren't taking no mas.

Speaker 6:          00:34:15       You got to make that fucking your, your action hero list. You know, you're Jason Bourne list. Have you ever seen an action movie where the fucking guy jumps into some vehicle, a plane or anything? It's like I, I just, uh, how does this work? Does anybody know how to drive a fucking helicopter, fly it or whatever? I want to be able to do that shit. You know what's his face? Tom Cruise. Tom Cruise has a pilot's license. He can ride a motorcycle. Remember top gun when he was fucking riding with it without his helmet on, right. He can ride a, you can drive a sports car. I wanted at the helicopter though. That's probably the wildcard. Everybody's got that. It's like a great pitcher. He's got his, he's got his four pitches or whatever, but not everybody has the cut fastball. I think the helicopter is the cut fastball for a, maybe it's a knuckle ball for an action hero, whatever, whatever.

Speaker 6:          00:35:12       I never learned how to ride a motorcycle because my parents would not allow it. They just wouldn't allow it. And uh, you know, the fuck was I going to do, I didn't have the money to buy one. I wanted to get one, which required them. I was like, can you buy me this? Still like no. And if we could afford it, we wouldn't. And I was like, why not? They're like, cause you're gonna fucking die. All right. And this is knowing as you are, as a child. We don't want that to happen. So no, we're not. We're not getting you that. And then I remember I got old enough and I was going to buy this motorcycle came out, it was called the Honda rebel and it was only 1200 bucks. This was the 80s. And I still remember the commercial, you something like a look at my watch. He was not 51. So I called up, my girls said let's have some fun and we road riding on a rebel [inaudible] get this fucking bike, something like that. Right. And um, I was going to buy it and the girl I was seeing at the time said, if you buy that, you might as well buy the coffin to go with it.

Speaker 6:          00:36:23       And I don't know, I talked to a couple other people and people work in emergency rooms. They call people who ride motorcycles. They just call him organ donors. And uh, and I was under the impression of, yeah, but what if you got really good at riding a bike? You know, people suck it riding bikes. Maybe if you've got really good at it. And I basically, eventually, probably somebody told me, it's like, listen, stupid. It doesn't matter how good you are. If somebody sucks it driving a car, they're in a fucking car. You're in a motorcycle. That's it. You know, there's no fender benders as they say on those things. So I was just like, all right, you know what? That's probably a good idea. Oh, fucking action. Heroes can also ride a horse. It's just nothing. Can't, there's nothing they can fit, can't fucking do and climb up the side of a building.

Speaker 6:          00:37:14       So what you gotta do, you gotta get a chin up bar and then you got to start knocking down all these modes of transportation because that's, that's as big a part of fucking Armageddon. As you know, growing your own food and having your own water supply, you have to be able to drive every mode of transportation. I guaran fucking tee you. If you go on Youtube, there's gonna be a video. I've never looked this up, but how to drive a tank, I bet somewhere on the Internet and if the, uh, somewhere on the Internet, I bet that there's a video that will teach you how to do that shit. Um, so anyways, what the hell was I talking about? I just totally lost my God damn train of thought. Um, oh yeah. So I'm going to be a off to, I know what I'm talking about coming up with this new hour of material.

Speaker 6:          00:38:02       So how I do it day sees how I do it is um, I obviously I throw out all my other shit, man. I only go back to the old hour if I have to. Um, and I just keep talking new shit. I take all rules of hack. I throw him out the window. I will, I will. And right down to a Michael Jackson impression, if I could do it, I would do it on stage. I wouldn't give a fuck. And I just, just to be saying something new that'll just get me thinking that way. And then in my personal life,

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       I go out and I try and do some shit that I never did before because I know God damn well, I'm going to make an ass of myself trying to ride that bike. I'll stall it out. I'll do a face plant, I'll do something fucking stupid. Um, or whatever. I don't know. Maybe even that fucking Shit I just said there about the fucking action heroes so they can drive some, something will come out of it. So that is my, uh, that is what I'm going to be working on coming up. And I got a bunch of actually standup gigs he gets, starts to get crazy again in, um, in June I'm going to be at the San Jose Improv. Uh, Chelsea Peretti is on that one also. I had to give her that one. It's so close to her hometown in Sacramento. All her peeps are gonna come down, be Hella excited.

Speaker 1:          00:39:25       Um, that's on June 15th and 16th. And then I'm doing the aunt and, and on the 17th, I'm at the Chicago theater and that's a Vince Vaughn show, Vince Vaughn, wild west show. It's going to be me. Obviously Vince Vaughn, Steve Byrne, I gotta get you guys in that lineup. That's going to be insane. And, uh, the Chicago theaters to shit, I actually got to work at one time previously when I was working with the Great Jimmy Norton on his tour, uh, the antisocial tour, it was me, Norton a tell in brewer that was such an unbelievable show. And the Bruins won the Stanley Cup that night. So, um, this is my triumphant return to the Chicago Theater. That's going to be Sunday, June 17th and all right, so all you mustachioed, uh, stereotypical Chicago people bring fucking 6,000 of your closest friends down to that Gig and Ontario Improv, the inland empire, June 29th, 30th and July 1st.

Speaker 1:          00:40:25       And then the next Gig I got after that is Hampton beach and in New Hampshire on July 14th in Newport, Rhode Island of doing the Newport yachting center, which sounds really, like I said, snooty, but it's a tent that they put up in the parking lot in Newport, Rhode Island, uh, July 15th. And that's actually one of my favorite gigs. Um, cause I get to go back and see all kinds of friends and family and that's it. And by then I'm guaranteeing you by that July 15th, I'm going to have my 45 fucking minutes down. That's my goal. By July 15th to have a new 45 minutes and then I can coast through, you know, August and September. Get that next 15 and then my special comes out. Right. And hopefully everybody likes it. Then they come out to see me and he's was like, oh fuck. We show him. He's got a whole new fucking hour. And that is how you do it. Um, all right, dilemma bill. Would you rather lose your driver's driver's license forever or spend the rest of your life as a Vegan? Oh man, that is a great one. And I obviously can't cheat on the Diet.

Speaker 1:          00:41:44       Ah, what a hell of a dilemma drive around is a grumpy, skinny Douche for the rest of my life. No, no, no, no. Wait. Yeah. Wait, what'd you write? I just got lost in that. Lose your driver's license forever or spend the rest of you have license. Oh, I'd have to walk around is a meat eating jackass. Spend the rest of my life as a Vegan. I F I'd have to be a Vegan. I'd have to be a Vegan. What am I going to pick? I just sit around eating Burgers, walking around the block, asking people to drive me places. I wonder if you could get used to that though. I lost my license for drinking and driving a long time ago, and that was back when you only lost it for 45 days on a first offense. And they didn't count the first two weeks while I was waiting to get arraigned. Um, so it was probably more like 45. I probably lost it for, I don't think it was two weeks either. I lost if like 50 something days. And I remember towards the end of it, I almost, I forgot what it was like to drive

Speaker 1:          00:43:01       just after that amount of time. You know what I, if I lost my driver's license forever, I would just live. I would live in New York City. That's what I would do,

Speaker 1:          00:43:15       man. You know, I'd be like one of those fucking people, you know, when you live in New York, Jesus Christ, New York City, man, I, you know what the smartest thing I ever did. I left New York City at 39. That was the smartest thing I ever did. New York City is such a city for young people, you know, I know I've said to ship before, but like if you, this is thing, I really feel it, you got to live there at some point you life, it's fucking awesome. You have to live there, but don't stay there too long. You stay there too long. That's just something happens. You become a gore of phobic. You know, you have some unhealthy relationship with a fucking animal. And I'm not saying beastiality, but like, you know, instead of having a kid, you have like a cat and all you do is sit around bitching that there's no fucking good restaurants in your neighborhood and it just, it just, you get all hunched over you, you start looking like you have osteoporosis, even if you don't this, that, that city is for young people.

Speaker 1:          00:44:10       And, uh, go there and have a good time. And then you got to get out. Don't hang there too long because you end up, it's like Matthew mcconaughey in dazed and confused. You just hanging around and uh, it's, it's not a good thing. Um, oh, and speaking of which, I bought the New Jersey Devils, the New Jersey devils, the La Kings. Who Do you like? Who Do you like? And the Rangers lose the Rangers lose my condolences to all rangers fans and my condolences to the world's most famous arena slash food court. Once again, another year goes by. No NBA title, no Stanley Cup. Yeah. But for some reason it's the world's most famous arena because of music cause of Frankie Sinatra because the led Zepplin because of Muhammad Ali, not because of the rangers or the next. Okay. And I know that's a bitter pill for you, New York sports fans to swallow. And that's exactly why I'm handing it to you on a nice fucking pillow.

Speaker 1:          00:45:11       Swallow it because it's all you. Um, Celtics by the way, are still in it going for their 18th NBA world championship, all championships. One in the NBA, in the National Basketball Association as opposed to that other team out west that counts that be a title. We want an NBA title before there was even an NPA. Um, anyways, by the way, I've got to give the rangers props. Don't arrange your fans. Everybody stole your let's go rangers. Everybody stole that from you guys in 1994. You guys were the only guys doing and it became fucking iconic and now everybody does it. Okay. You know, let's go bro ends. No one ever did that. It was, here we go, Bro. Edge. There we go, Bob. Bob. That's what the fuck it was. Now I, people go, let's go. Bro Wins and it bugs me. Um, I actually looked up the history of, uh, the beat La Chan and uh, cause some jackass was trying to be like, oh shit, you fucking a DCF Francisco giants fan.

Speaker 1:          00:46:20       You should say that to the did back in the [inaudible] go fuck yourself. No, they did all right. According to my fucking Internet research, uh, the history of the beat La Chant was actually when the 70 sixers beat the Celtics in game seven in 1982 and they were going and we hated the fucking Lakers. That's how much we hated the Lakers to sell. The 70 sixers beat us in our own goddamn building. We knew it was over and the fans chanted beat La. Actually, they chanted it to the 70 sixers. All right? That's how much we fucking hated La. You know, we weren't going, fuck you. 76 is Yada, Yada, Yada. All that bullshit. We were just like, all right, you beat us. You know, as much as we fucking hate that, we hate the Lakers more. And then the beat La chant was born. All right. And if that isn't a fucking phenomenal story, I don't know what is. And I got to tell you something I hated the 76 is back then. But when I look back and I remember those teams, I fuck, I love him now. Maurice Cheeks, Andrew, Bobby Jones, Dr Jay. Oh. And then when they brought in Moses Malone, it was just phenomenal. And I love their uniforms back then. I don't know why they just don't go back to those. I don't know why every fucking uniform has to be so Goddamn discoed up. I just don't get it. They were just simple back then.

Speaker 1:          00:47:51       I Dunno. Although I gotta say I liked the new Atlanta Hawks uniforms. I like those better though. Then once they had back in the day during Dominique's they were, uh, they were definitely, uh, I dunno what the fuck was going on with that. Um, all right. Please beat the dead horse bill. You've received this email a million times. All right. Can you please beat the dead horse and make, make it clear one more time.

Speaker 5:          00:48:19       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:48:20       That she should not be wasting any more time with him anymore. Sincerely pronouns. What? I don't even get that. I know you're trashing me. Can you please beat the dead horse and make it clear one more time? That she should not be wasting any more time with him anymore. I didn't know what the fuck that is. You got me. You got me surf or Ma'am or whatever, you beat me. I don't even know what that means. A weird signals from a sort of a creepy friends. Hey Bill. Uh, I'm a girl that has a lot of guy friends. I'd say about 70% of my friends are guys a half our gay half aren't, you know what? I can't fucking stand. I Hate Wa women who have gay friends and they refer to them all. That's my gay, he's my gay. I fucking, ah, those women are the fucking worst. And then there's stupid gay friend comes around Cock blocking Ya, you know, with his Sassy fucking bullshit coming in and out. That's when he just like, why aren't the two you go fucking finger blast each other.

Speaker 1:          00:49:35       No, it's really, it's really fucking annoying. It's really annoying. It's, and then I always feel like the gay guy is gay, ended up his act and he just like acting extra gay, uh, like sit-com gay, not like real life gay. And it's, the whole fucking thing is just annoying. So anyways, she goes, uh, and lately I've been noticing a lot of my male friends have started staring at me. It's a little weird because I've known them for a while and no one ever looked at me twice, but over the last two months, I keep catching them looking particularly my friends, so-and-so. All right, well what's going on with you? Did you hit the gym? Were you late developing? Are you dressing differently? Um, uh, so and so is my age and sword and sort of kind has a girlfriend, but not really. Oh Jesus. Are you that kind of girl? Nia went off on back in the day. Girl has all guy friends. Uh, anyways, she just turned 15. Oh wait a minute. Now you wonder age. I don't want to read this.

Speaker 5:          00:50:45       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:50:45       She just turned 15 and he's determined to wait around for two years until she's legal in the eyes of the state we live in to officially date and get what their sense all they've done is kiss creepy, I think. Yes. Uh, I would say definitely yes.

Speaker 5:          00:51:04       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:51:05       You sitting there floating around, just going, let me tell you something, man. The second model law allows me to take my dick out. I'm going to do with it. That's fucking creepy. Anyways, now even though he's allegedly in love with this child, he gets super flirty with me when we hang up. Even going so far as the cop feels, make jokes about us hooking up and give me long hugs. Yeah. Stay away from this guy. This guy's a creep. She goes, I'm friends with this dude. But this whole situation weirds me out as it should. I'm not sure if he really wants to stay with his girlfriend or try to get or try his hand at dating someone age appropriate.

Speaker 5:          00:51:51       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:51:51       But there's a fucking ton of mixed signals going on here and any outside insight would be awesome. Thanks in advance. Um, I think you got to go with your gut on this one. I think the reason why you're getting creeped out is because this guy's creepy. That's fucking creepy. That's fucking creepy.

Speaker 5:          00:52:10       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:52:11       All right. A 22 year old guy with the 15 that's Chris Hansen. Can you wait? Can you kiss a girl who's 15 at 22? What are you doing? You're in the prime of your life. There's plenty of fucking, uh,

Speaker 5:          00:52:27       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:52:27       you're 22 years old. That's it. You're a fucking rock star. There's a zillion women that you could get with. Yeah. This guy is a creep. He's beyond a fucking creep. I remember when I was 22 with an 18 year old girl, felt like a child at that point. It was just weird like that. That's a huge jump. This is still living at home. You know, you're of legal drinking age. You go on a titty bars. You getting arrested for fucking drinking and driving. You flunked out of college. I mean you're eons away from where they were at 18. That's how I felt.

Speaker 5:          00:53:00       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:53:01       Um, I remember as a, as a senior in college, like freshman seem like, like children. That's fucking weird. Yeah. I would stay away from that guy. And um,

Speaker 5:          00:53:12       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:53:12       And as far as guys looking at you, it sounds like you're a, you have to turn it into a swan. They acuity pie. So why don't you go get a guy you deserve, stay away from, uh, the future sex offender. You know, because you're just gonna

Speaker 6:          00:53:26       have to testify in his trial because you're friends that he's actually a good guy rather than a bad guy that is beyond fucked up. A 22 year old guy making out with a 15 year old girl is beyond fucked up. That's beyond fucked up. All right? Yeah. Like to the point, I wish I didn't even read it.

It. tidies.com um, I was telling you guys how if you go to amazon.com through my website on the podcast page, you just click on it and if you're going to buy something, you just buy it. That way you don't have to do anything else. Once you get to amazon.com that they kicked me back some money in 10% of the proceeds go to the wounded warriors. Well I got my first check from amazon.com so I, I can't do it today cause they don't do that. They don't pick up the mail tomorrow. I get to write a nice check, um, courtesy of you guys for taking the time to go through bill.com go to the podcast page and clicking on the Amazon banner.

Speaker 6:          00:56:44       And I want to thank all you guys for doing that because uh, you know, this is really perfect memorial day weekend to be bringing this up to we get to actually, uh, you know, help out the wounded warriors project through a buy and flowbees on amazon.com. So I actually use it. I'm rebuilding this cabaret data and I'll just go on my own damn podcast, click on that, you know, rebuild in the Holly 41 60 dude and uh, I know that, that sounds impressive. It definitely has that man great vibe to it, doesn't it? But I gotta tell you it's not that difficult taking it apart and then putting it back together. It really isn't that difficult. Uh, what is difficult though is a, I haven't got to the part where you get to use a little measurer. It makes sure the float is that the right level and then adjusting the carburetors.

Speaker 6:          00:57:40       But I gotta be honest with you, I don't think that that is going to get, is going to be that hard either. Once you've taken something apart, you know what I mean? I don't, and then put it back together. It's not as scary anymore, which is why surgeons is so God damn arrogant. You know, when they cut you open and move around you frigging ovaries, easy your goddamn liver and then sew you back up when you don't die. I mean, do you really think that they think they're buying the next round? I think, you know, is arrogant, is professional athletes are, I think that like, surgeons should be twice as fucking arrogant really to just split the d and dunk from the foul line. I cut open a guy's skull, fucking played patty cake with his brain. Put it back together and he can still talk.

Speaker 6:          00:58:25       All right, go fuck yourself, Colby. Um, and then he steps on you. All right, let's get back to the podcast here. Where the hell is it? What's the rest of this stuff here? Uh, oh my God. Here's one for you guys. Uh, my boyfriend wants to have his foreskin restored. By the way, how fresh and new are these, uh, these emails here? Just because it's coming from the female perspective. I love this shit. All right. Not Saying I don't want guys to email him, but I, I would like to have a nice balance here. I already say enough shit. Trash and women. So it helps if women come in trash and guys, because, uh, I, you know, it'll, it'll be a nice balance here. All right. My boyfriend wants to have his for skin restored. Dear bill, I wanted to get your take on the situation I'm in with my current boyfriend. Uh, I'm a girl. All right. A few weeks ago, my boyfriend of two years told me that he's become totally upset that he and wants to restore his for skin via taping and stretching methods. What, and basically why he wants to do this is because everybody, they say that, um, intercourse you, you lose like, I don't know, some percentage of sensitivity when you have, you're forced skin removed. And um,

Speaker 7:          00:59:46       okay.

Speaker 6:          00:59:46       All I can say is no guy can tell the difference whether he has a four skin or whether he doesn't. Because unless you got laid when you were fucking six weeks old, you don't know what you're gaining of what you're missing. So I don't understand why you would do this. So t by restore his force can, via taping and stretching methods. She goes, I know, I know. It makes me want to throw up just thinking about it. I want him to tell him, I think he's out of his mind. Uh, but I don't want to hurt his feelings. The thing is, I'm totally grossed out by the idea of for skin penises are gross enough already. There's no need to make it even grosser. Uh, you know, what am I the only guy that totally agrees with that? Is there anything more fucking disgusting? Then I'll fucking flacid for skin covered Dick. I didn't know what it looks like. It looks like I got a fucking, I don't know what it looks like.

Speaker 7:          01:00:51       Okay.

Speaker 6:          01:00:51       I, it's just this fucking disgusting. I don't even have like a reference.

Speaker 6:          01:00:58       Looks like an Elephant Dick. I get, I don't even know what to say. It's just gross. It's fucking disgusting. Um, she goes, obviously I can't tell him how I feel. He's clearly having a really hard time with this. He tells me that he feels violated and disfigured. This guy's a pussy, this throat, this throw this guy into the fucking pussy, Ben, and get on with your life. He also claims that for skins has a lot of advantage for both partners, but it's hard for me to totally buy that considering the fact I have slept with a couple uncircumcised guy and I didn't notice any extra pleasure. Although I did use a condom with both guys. Yeah, he's full of Shit. He's full of Shit. It may be more pleasure for him. I don't know what I mean. I think it's amazing that women will put a dick in their mouths.

Speaker 6:          01:01:48       You know the at least you can do is try and tidy up down there. You know? How about having fucking empathy? I've asked you this, discuss. It's just fucking extra skin. Yeah. Nothing more sexier than extra skin. Yeah. Yeah. It's like your Dick used to be obese and then lost a ton of weight, but didn't have enough money to have that surgery. They get rid of the extra. Ah, it's gross. There's another two paragraphs, people just just preparing you for another two paragraphs of having an uncircumcised stretch taped dick in your head. Anyway, I think it's absolutely disgusting and totally weird that he wants to do this and I'm starting to get really turned off by the idea of sleeping with him while he's stretching out his force. Good. He told me he's going to tape it to an elastic strap, which is going to tie around his leg. I know. What the fuck is he just coming up with this shit on his own?

Speaker 7:          01:02:49       Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:02:49       I told him that he should see a doctor before he starts to do this, but he doesn't want, but he doesn't think that doctors know much about this sort of thing. Oh, so he's just going to take it in his own hands. Congratulations sweetheart. You're dating a fucking moron.

Speaker 7:          01:03:05       Yeah,

Speaker 6:          01:03:06       that, come on. This is the father. You children.

Speaker 7:          01:03:10       Okay.

Speaker 6:          01:03:10       Coming up with, you know, taking an erector set to his fucking Dick. It was this, do I have to finish reading this?

Speaker 7:          01:03:19       Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:03:20       I'm thinking of breaking it off with them really. Course you are. I thought he was a normal guy, but I had no idea he had all this freaky shit going on underneath the surface. Anyways. What do you think about all of this? You got to go ll cool j. You just got to do any of that. You're stretching out your fucking Dick. I know. I said I'd be true. You're stretching out your fucking Dick. So I'm leaving you go fuck yourself. It's over. Yeah. Fucking gross. Anyway, what do you think all this is my justified dumping him away or would that make me an insensitive comment? No, it would make you as strong person. All right. Go with your gut on this one.

Speaker 7:          01:04:12       Okay.

Speaker 6:          01:04:12       This guy is trying to to do the impossible, like, uh, like he said, fucking scientist in that Michael J. Fox movie back to the future.

Speaker 7:          01:04:22       Okay.

Speaker 6:          01:04:23       He's basically, you know, doing the Delorean bullshit with his Dick and he doesn't want to go see a doctor. Any doctor would tell them, you can't do that.

Speaker 7:          01:04:33       Yeah,

Speaker 6:          01:04:33       you'll be funny. That was if you dumped this guy right, and it actually works. And then he starts screaming like Billy Mays on TV with his, his Dick Stretcher and he sells it for 1995. It makes a zillion dollar. I'm just playing devil's advocate here. You know there's a 99% chance you're doing the right thing, but there is a 1% chance you could be walking away from a, a potential millionaire. Cause I gotta be honest with you if, if that guy actually pulls this off, no pun intended, he pulls this off.

Speaker 7:          01:05:08       Okay.

Speaker 6:          01:05:09       And he's able to do it with some household material and then he, you know, Pete, they already make millions of dollars with those, those pills that say they're going to make your Dick Bigger, which we all know it doesn't work because of it fucking work. That would be an international story. And um, and then it still wouldn't work because then what would happen was everybody would take big dick pills, even guys with big dicks because they don't want everybody else catching up with them. So then having a little dick would then be like having a six inch dick as opposed to a three inch, four inch Dick. Right. It's a math workout on that or get bumped up. You've got to six, seven inch Dick. You just, he just regular, no, you don't actually, not regularly. You'd have a little Dick.

Speaker 7:          01:05:53       Okay,

Speaker 6:          01:05:54       so if this guy actually fucking is able to pull this, that doesn't even make sense.

Speaker 6:          01:06:01       He's going, he, if he thought he was disfigured, now wait till he tries to fucking do this. I mean his dick is going to look like, you know when those people put that shit, their ear lobes, they put those fucking, um, those circles circular things. You could shoot a God damn fucking bow and Arrow through somebody's ear low, but not drawing any blood. He's going to do that to his deck, except he's not going to have that thing in there and it's just going to be hanging. Ah, right bill. We got it. It's disgusting. All right. Overrated. Underrated, underrated. A steakhouse dinner with your bullies. There's nothing better than stuffing your fat face with your friends devouring menu. Philemon, yawn, prime rib and porterhouse and leaving nothing on your plate at the end. Recently my two buddies and I went to Morton steak house and we spent a 115 bucks despite having a hundred dollar gift card.

Speaker 6:          01:06:52       We each got our own stakes side, shrimp cocktails to start and drinks to keep us twisted. We ate like royal royalty despite being low level pieces of shit. He cannot even, we could not have been that gluttonous with the ladies. Why not? No offense to any wives or girlfriends, but nothing beats pigging out on quality food and not giving a shit about how you look in the process. You and your girl just can't do that sort of steakhouse thing, but you can do it with your boys. Abso-Fucking-Lutely uh, you know what dude? You sound like a chick. You're not going to pick out in front of you girl.

Speaker 7:          01:07:31       Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:07:32       You know what? Come see me in San Jose when fucking Peretti opens up for me. She actually talks about eating. A lot of women don't want to fucking throw down.

Speaker 7:          01:07:43       Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:07:43       All right. But I know what you mean. I thought just to hang out with guys, it just makes you feel like you're running your own corporation when you have a steak dinner with, with, with just hanging out with the guys, right. It's smoking a cigar. I get drinking a scotch and everybody feels like they're fucking, you know, HD Buttercup, Shea, um, overrated fake tits. They're too stiff. The, uh, they look silly to me and uncomfortable for her. I don't know why women keep doing this. It isn't better. Thank you. That's one of the truest things ever. You,

Speaker 6:          01:08:16       they're fucking, they're horrific and they don't feel good. And I think natural titties look better always, regardless of the size. It's just, it's just not that big a deal. It really is that you would do that, that you would take a bag of chemicals and have it inserted into your body. It's just fucking insane. I think, uh, it was a bad idea and I think it's over fake titties. It's, it's like bell bottoms. It's over. All right. Let's just let it go. It was a bad idea. Uh, underrated. The natural boob, both Gigli and ECO friendly. Absolutely. Um, all right. That's the podcast for this week. I think I hit everything I had to talk about except a, I guess, game fly.com.

Speaker 1:          01:10:17       That's it. That's the podcast. Let's go. Celtics fucked the Miami heat a, it's going to crush me to see the spurs win the championship again this year because I always felt Tim Dunkin should have been a Celtic. He was, he's the perfect Celtic fundamentally sound, not flashy. The Anti Showtime Lakers. It's what made the Celtics Lakers rivalry so great. They were both awesome teams who did it two different ways and we were always the, uh, we're going to bore you to death and still score 108 points. That's how we always were. And uh, ah, I forget what, there was some bullshit that happened that year on the lottery. We had like two lottery balls and we still didn't fucking get them. I don't know who the fuck we want to aunt wound up with, like Joe Barry Carroll or some bullshit. So it kills me. And uh, you know what? It's a, you know what I think you think maybe San Antonio, we'll finally get some fucking respect. If they win it again, would this be Tim Duncan's fourth or fifth title? I can't remember. He wanted 99. Then they want to like oh four then they want to like, they want like every other year for a couple of years. I have no, I gotta look that up. I got no idea and I should know that ship. He was want at least three Oh bill, shut the fuck up. All right. Go Fuck Yourself. So I'll talk to you next week.
