Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's time for the Monday morning podcast from Monday, January 11th, 2016 what's going on? How I yeah, I was at going, I'm in a great fucking mood. I don't know why. You know what? I haven't boozed in like fucking, I don't know what it's been. I don't t nine 10 days or something like that. I did have a sip of wine last night, but I don't really consider that booze and you know, the way I go after it, um, my wife, so you know, something, we, it's funny when I, when I stopped drinking, my wife always tries to get me back to drinking, not to get drunk or anything. She just is like, you're so fucking, you know, I drive her so fucking nuts that I just think sometimes, you know, if she wasn't such a good person, I think she would try and like drug me every night like around supper.

Speaker 1:          00:00:57       Right. Make a little dinner, be like, how is that honey? Hello? Look at you. You look sleepy. And like, I have no idea. Like, she just put some shit in my food, not to like kill me, just to sort of sedate me. Um, but uh, anyways, but I haven't drank in like 10 days or something. Wow. That really made my head go somewhere like, wow, that's kind of fucked up. She does that. Um, but yeah, I haven't drank in like 10 days. I, uh, I'm feeling good and that, so what happens is nice slowly, you know, I start to eat better. I'm starting my day off with the old, uh, from the old country thing, you know, you little fucking water at room temperature, which should make you keg if you're any kind of a fucking human being, but a, you get used to it with some lemon and then a little cayenne pepper in it.

Speaker 1:          00:01:43       And then I take a, I let that settle in me. Then I get a couple of scoops of a Greek yogurt, the all natural stuff that actually kind of tastes like sour cream. And the first time I ate it, I was like, this is the worst shit I've ever tasted because I was used to the, uh, the crack baby yogurt that I've been eating my whole life that has like fucking 40 bags of sugar in it, you know, and you yogurt, you'll like, yeah, I mean, the amount of sugar that's in fucking regular yoga Humani you should fucking snort it. I mean, it's literally like, I mean, I'm not glad he, I still fucking love it, but, uh, the Greek shit took me a minute and now I'm actually, uh, I like it, man. If I drink this shit and just have a couple of scoops of that, it kind of fills me up.

Speaker 1:          00:02:27       And that's kind of the big thing is you become an old fuck like me. It's just, just somehow getting the hunger to go away without doing damage to yourself, you know, and then walking around and burn a few calories before you go to the next one. You know, and I know this is a bunch, you know, hopefully some younger listeners listening to this judging Mikko this is this old fart talking about fucking lemon water, Cayenne pepper and fucking Greek yogurt. Well, you know something. If you're lucky enough, you'll live long enough. If we don't fuck up something or something bad doesn't happen to, you know, to, to by age and you know, it's good to start healthy habits now. Fuck. Shut up bill. What do you the fucking first lady, you know what I'm doing right now? I'm doing shit that like a first lady does right now. I'm actually, let's get in shape. Kids.

Speaker 1:          00:03:14       How about you go outside for 10 minutes a day and you just do some jumping jacks? Can you fucking believe that they've got to tell kids to go out and play piano? That's how fucking insane video games have got. I mean, if I made video games and I actually saw Michelle Obama on TV begging kids to try to not have their first cardiac incident by the time they were in the third grade, I mean I, I would tear up and just be like, I did it. You know, I am so fucking great at my job. I've made children stop playing outside, you know. Do you think there's like at the Alec Baldwin of the video game industry, you know, from Glengarry Glen Ross Ross coming in just screaming at him.

Speaker 2:          00:04:06       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:07       Yeah. But kids, I cause to have a heart attack, seven fuck Yo. Right. She's screaming at him trying to get them to, we haven't done our fucking jobs till every kid has a fucking pacemaker by the seventh grade. Um, I dunno. Anyways. Yeah. So I'm trying to get back in shape. So, uh, I've been stoned sober. So yesterday I got my, uh, my, my first massage in like, I dunno, like two years. Whenever I get a massage afterwards, I always think like, I got to start doing this, man, this is great for an old fart like me, you know? And then he'd come home, you crush the waters, you get all the toxins out here or whatever yoga shit they tell you to do. And um, but the, I know this always happened in my own fucking do this. You know what? Once, once a month [inaudible] you know, fucking, you haven't worked out my fucking back, like my whole right. I don't know what, like I have a little curvature of the spine and the lady's like, where are the problem areas? Right? And of course your brain always goes my dick. But you know, it's illegal place.

Speaker 1:          00:05:17       They seem to be having a problem in the, uh, central pelvic area on the frontal lobe. Um, I'm like, I never even noticed it either. I was like my right shoulder, my right forearm and my right foot. And I was just like, wow, how fucked up is my right side? And then I realized all of them, all of those injuries I got from playing drums, you know, my right forearm from fucking holding the stick wrong. I Dunno what I'm doing with my shoulders probably after I fuck up another field looking at the bass player. And shrugging like, I'm sorry. I mean I tried to get back on one, right. And then my foot, I fucked that up years ago trying to get my bass drum fast as John Bottoms, you know, which I never even remotely achieved. I just had the lifetime pain. You know, every time I take a step, I'm always reminded of what a wonderful drummer John Bonham is. Um, so anyways, uh, I did that. Um, with the lovely Nia, that's always a good thing to do it, you know, you go in there with your wife, then you don't feel like a dirt bag. Cause anytime I go to get a massage, I always feel like a dirt bag. There's just no way not to feel like a fucking complete piece of shit. When you walk in, they're like, yeah, Hey, I want you to, I want you to work out the kinks there, sweetheart. You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:06:32       Oh, wait a minute. What am I talking about? I got a massage and fucking, Nah, Milwaukee,

Speaker 1:          00:06:42       no, I didn't. No, I did not. That was the steam. That was a steam. That's right. Oh, that's right. That's right. Yeah. I guess I haven't, I'd like two fucking years and they always do the same thing, wouldn't they? When they put my hands on my back, they just go, wow. Wow. Do you have a lot of stress? Has it been a while? It's like I, yeah, if your back feels like gravel. So anyways, we did that and then we came home and um, we made a Mario Batali is a Lasagna A's and uh, it was fucking delicious. Homemade Pasta, homemade pasta things and all that. I got to get my homemade pasta game up. I tried to make the spinach pasta and the pasta was definitely green, but he could still see the chunks of a spinach in there, you know what I mean? So what does that mean? Did I not need the dough enough? Was because it was frozen spinach, like it's said to be like the, uh, the recipe said to me, am I saying that right? Like the recipe said, said to be, what the fuck does that mean? Like the rest of the, we said it should be. I think that's what I was trying to say, but um, you know, and I dried it out.

Speaker 2:          00:07:58       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:07:58       And maybe I just didn't dice it up enough. I have no idea. But, um, I'm actually psyched that, uh, the consistency though, I can get that down. I might have needed it needed to knead it a little bit more. I don't know. Is there any, uh, higher qualified people out there that could help me out on how to make the right spinach pasta because I watched some videos and I still fucked the thing up. But anyways, so we did all of that and meanwhile I was watching like the playoff games playoffs and I'm fucking great games this weekend. Heartbreakers but just fucking, just great games with also that, that creeping sadness that I always have when the playoffs are here. That it's just like did another regular season. Go buy that fucking fast.

Speaker 2:          00:08:45       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:46       God Damn it. It's going to be over there. Not a month. It's going to be fucking over this time. Next month is good. This, I'm not even gonna say, cause there's gonna be two fucking depressing. Um, however, I have gotten totally into the Celtics and NBA hoop with my Bruins. So I mean, I got a little game almost every night sometimes too, but anyways, so let's go through them. Let's go throw him. Is that be fucking Douche? Who doesn't like sports is going to roll their eyes just fast forward like fucking 40 minutes and you'll be safe. Um, the first one I saw, I think I want, I taped all of them. Um, so I watched them at weird times. I watched, uh, the second half of the original Texas, the Kansas City chiefs, just absolutely dominating the, uh, the new Texans. And I actually tweeted that out to an AH, on Twitter.

Speaker 1:          00:09:34       Um, and I actually got a ton of shit for it. People are like, oh, what are you trying to show off your sports knowledge? It's like, no, I like Sharon it. I love when people do stuff like that and I am a sports nerd. Okay. I'm not acting like I played at a professional level. I just love that shit. So I'm going to take you through it. For those of you didn't know that the chiefs were originally called the Texas. They actually played in Dallas, Texas. Um, when the AFL first started and when the AFL first came out, the NFL, the established league publicly laughed at them and said, these guys are crazy. They'll, this will never work. Ha Ha, ha, whatever. I, you know, are you nervous now? We're not nervous at all. We're just going to do, you know, the American people know where the quality football is that right? That's what they said publicly. And then behind the scenes, as much as they may or may have not believed that they then hedged their bets and they wanted to try to sabotage the AFL as much as they could before it even got started. So the AFL, how many fucking teams did they had? They had the Boston Patriots, the buffalo bills, the New York titans.

Speaker 2:          00:10:46       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:10:46       Uh, the Dallas Texans, the Minnesota Vikings, and I'll get back to that before you say that. I'm wrong on that. They had the Minnesota Vikings. I used to know this by heart. Denver Broncos. Oakland Raiders.

Speaker 2:          00:11:01       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:02       San Diego chargers. I'm sorry. The Los Angeles chargers.

Speaker 2:          00:11:07       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:11:08       And a dolphin's weren't in it. Bengals weren't in it. Who the fuck else has left? Bears. Lions. Yeah, something like that. I probably forgot a team or two. And so the owner with the most money was Lamar Lundy, I believe that was his name. I didn't look the shit up again, but I read this whole book on it. Lamar Lundy, and he was the wealthiest of all owners. So basically this guy could hold out the longest in this new crazy venture. All right, so Dave, how they attack the fucking AFL? They did it on two different levels. The Dallas Texans were owned by Lamar Lundy, the most wealthiest of all the owners. So what they the NFL did was they awarded Dallas a team, which became the Dallas cowboys. So for a season or two, I forget, I didn't look it up as I said that you could either go see the Dallas cowboys or the Dallas, Texas now the Dallas cowboys, as much as they were an expansion franchise, you could go down and watch them get the shit kicked out of him.

Speaker 1:          00:12:14       You know, by Johnny Unitas. Jim Brown or you know, Frank Gifford. And while these guys, you know, all these legends, the fucking Green Bay packers would come to town. You get to see Vince Lombardi and the, the, the early days of the packer sweep, you could see all this professional level talent or you could go across town and go see the Dallas Texans, a bunch of nobodies playing a bunch of nobodies cause they want to establish it. So obviously that completely, um, that's a no brainer. As a sports fan, you're going to go see the NFL team and go see all these stars that you've been watching on TV. So, uh, that completely fucked them. And they had to move to Kansas City and they became the chiefs. They kept their colors though. But they were originally called the Texas, but they gave up the name. And then the Minnesota Vikings, which I did not know.

Speaker 1:          00:13:01       I didn't know any of that shit till I read the book. The Minnesota Vikings were originally going to be an AFL team. So at the NFL did was not only award Dallas a team, they also went to the owners of the Minnesota Vikings and said, hey, do you want to just join the NFL and not be part of the AFL? Come on, we're an established leak. And of course they said, hey, fuck you guys and your new venture. We're going to fuck a fuck the whole going against the NFL, we're going to join them. So that's what they did. They, uh, they opened a franchise across town from the wealthiest owner and then they stole one of their teams that, that was their two moves as they publicly laughed at the AFL. So there you go. There's a little fucking little little history from all freckles.

Speaker 1:          00:13:46       Um, but having said that, you know, baby, they got him back, but I guess they'd have to beat the fucking cowboys. And they're also part of the NFL. So a congratulations to the chiefs and evidently they're playing the Patriots is what I got from some of the tweets. And, uh, I am not a comfortable Patriot fan. No Patriot fan who's been watching the Patriots is, you know, we had a lot of losses towards the end of the year. Um, I'm hoping, you know, we're going to get some help back on our offensive line. Um, either way it's going to be, even if we were healthy, it would have been a brutal day. Cause, uh, you know, Andy Reid is no slouch as much as the guy gets a ton of shit. I mean the guy's been to a bunch of, uh, NFC championship games and shit like that. He has been there before, but you know, you do need the players.

Speaker 1:          00:14:31       You do need the ownership. You need all of that type of shit to try and to try to succeed. So congratulations to them. And I'm, I am by no means comfortable with next week. Um, and you know, also, you know, the chief speak the Seattle Seahawks as far as p and the loudest fans at one point, they did it in that old ass stadium rather than the, uh, the stadium's Seahawks fans half that helps him out and contains the south. That was such a cut. But it's true. Um, and uh, yeah, so speaking of the Vikings and the bangles, my condolences to fans of both teams. I've been there, fortunately you have not been there in a long time. I guess the giants losses, but I can't wine as a fan with all the other shit that was going on. But uh, Jesus fucking Christ. What the fuck was that guy doing after he picked off the ball, walking up to the tunnel already celebrating. I thought fucking athletes were were superstitious. The fuck are you doing

Speaker 1:          00:15:34       right there? Yeah, right. That's fucking unbelievable to me. And then he's fucking sitting there. He probably already took his God damn cleats off and then the very next play, what it was at two plays in, they fumbled the fucking ball. I had to watch this part of the game on highlights because I taped the game. If the one time I don't do the extended fucking record, this shit happens and I'm probably to put his cleats on, run back out on the field. I think he was so fucking frustrated cause he still had champagne, you know, coursing through his veins. He was already mentally the next week that he goes, it's, this was the same guy, right. Goes in and fucking knocks out that player. Unfucking believable.

Speaker 1:          00:16:14       Unfucking believable. Hey, Steeler fence. How many you shut the game off after the interception? Huh? Not because you're a fair weather fan. Just because you couldn't stomach to watch the bangle fans jumping up and down and having some joy. You know, I, I'd forgive you if you did that. I'd forgive you if you walked away. You know, or if you already started celebrating and you turned your big fucking sausage eaten back to the fucking TV and you are already doing well where gay. But uh, but uh, who do we got next week doing all that shit. Fucking brutal. And uh, the Vikings, I won't even, I don't even, can you explain to me how you place kicker had the laces facing you kick her twice in one fucking game and a playoff game

Speaker 1:          00:17:02       that's on fuck him. I've never, I mean, you never see the laces in, right? I never even knew about it. I'm not gonna lie to you. I didn't ever even knew about laces out since fucking ace mature. That's when I learned about it. Or is it ace Ventura? Um, Jesus. Fuck. I mean, I watched the replay of that game and I went on Twitter beforehand and I, you know, I found out the vikings one in which a fucking sucked, but I was in the middle of, you know, trying to make spinach pasta, which was well beyond my cooking ability. So, you know, I was a little fucking, uh, got a little sideways there for a minute. And um, I was thinking like, what the fuck at Man, he must make this field goal.

Speaker 2:          00:17:43       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:43       And then Seattle just has a ridiculous kickoff return and then they're able to kick it.

Speaker 1:          00:17:51       Oh, maybe they, they score a touchdown or maybe a defensive back falls down. I had no idea that he was going to fucking lose it. Oh my God. Fucking brutal. But you know what, every championship team, you gotta have a little bit of luck. The first fucking Superbowl, the Patriots won. We had the Tuck rule, which was a fucking rule. Everybody blames Tom Brady. It was a blame the officials. Oh, now the rule rules committee for coming up with that weird one because I say to this day, that's a fucking fumble. That's a fumble. The way sugar bear Hamilton did not interfere with Ken Stabler the year the fucking Raiders won a super Superbowl 11. So anybody in Oakland puts your fucking hankies away cause I don't wanna hear you crying about it. That was payback for super bowl. Uh, not super 11. The fucking playoffs playoffs and a 77 which sugar bear Hamilton was already in the air jumping at Ken Stabler and, and then he lets the ball go and they called roughing the passer and back then it wasn't a 15 yard penalty or they put the ball where the guy threw it and it was the end of the game needs through a 50 yard fucking prayer.

Speaker 1:          00:19:00       Ray Hamilton's already in the fucking air lands on Ken Stabler. They call roughing the passer and they took the ball from like the 50 and put it on the fucking one inch line and then the Raiders went and won the fucking game. So I don't want to hear anything about it, but I am man enough to say that the Tuck rule was fucking horseshit and, uh, I think it's a fumble, you know, but I'm not expecting that level of maturity from rate offense. You know, a fan base that goes to the game, you know, dressed with uh, you know, spikes on your shoulder pads that have been checked by security to make sure that they're totally safe as you make a, I'm not safe, angry face. Um, you know, something that does bug me. I can't stand when they fucking, um, when people get upset that Hollywood has the audacity have awards to have award shows and they always talk about the self congratulatory night. Um, like what business doesn't have an award show, it's just not fucking televised. You know, if you fucking drill for oil, you know, they have the best of, you know, BP and all them. They have their fucking yearly fucking Christmas party in l bass rage and all man at Jr.

Speaker 2:          00:20:15       Okay

Like, we're not getting this dog, we're just, we're a fostering the dog for a couple of days, cause she knew that I'd fall in love with the fucking dog and then that would be hit. So it's kind of like when you first start, start dating a woman, um, you know when she wants a relationship, when she comes over to your apartment, but she starts do is she leaves shit there cause it gives an excuse to come back. I mean, it's fucking nuts, right? Like the thinking that far ahead. All you're sitting as a look at those debts. Oh, the fucker. Right? That's all you're thinking. And they're sitting there plotting. You know what I mean? It's like you're some fucking head coach that has no game plan and she's across the field like fucking Bill Walsh calling the first 25 plays of the game.

Speaker 1:          00:27:05       Right? Oh, I love a football life. There's a nice reference to use. Um, so, you know, it's fucking hilarious. And speaking with Patrice O'Neal benefits coming up once again, uh, tell you a quick Patrice story. Um, he was so fucking brilliant than I remember he was dating this woman and you know, or whatever in her and she started leaving shit around his house and I, I just just had brought that up because yeah. You know, I dated swimming, you know, she left this shit here and she left that. It's like, what the fuck? You know, I only see her like, you know, once every two weeks he's just has shit their, so for two weeks I keep looking at her fucking brush or the shampoo, she left bell or whatever and it just, I keep thinking about her and it's annoying me and Patrice just goes Ecos, so throw it out.

Speaker 1:          00:27:57       I go, what? He goes, throw it out. I'm going to cancel out a brush. He goes, I would, I go get the fuck out. He goes, yeah. He goes, I did that and he told me his story but there was a woman he was messing around with and she left these toiletries and a little bag of like, you know, makeup and brush and all that. Eddie, he fucking throw it out. And then he came back like a week and a half later and she goes to go in the bathroom. She's like a, she's like, Hey, what did you do with my, uh, my stuff? He goes, and he just plays dumb. He goes, what stuff? She goes, I left shampoo here, a little makeup bay. He goes, Oh yeah, I was yours. Yeah. He goes, yeah, I throw it out. And she was like literally beside herself, but actually on some level respected him for like fucking realizing what she was doing.

Speaker 1:          00:28:56       And then also I think because that early on he clearly let her know in a very funny fucking way that he wasn't looking for a relationship and uh, that she was able to relax and kind of be thinking that, oh, we're just fucking all right. I wanted a little more, he doesn't at least, but he let her know so fucking early on that it didn't really hurt, you know? Does that make sense? I mean, I don't, maybe I'm speaking for her, but I guess I am, but whatever. Either way it was fucking funny. Jesus was at the fucking worse. I literally just jumped out of the plane and pull the fucking rip cord on that story. Sorry. It's been awhile. It's been awhile since I told that story, hasn't it? Or have I told it before? I don't fucking know. So anyway, so I'm kind of using the same fucking tricks that my wife used that got me the dog I'm using with her because, um, we're going to like, hey, why am I whispering here?

Speaker 1:          00:29:56       Like she can't just listen to the fucking podcast. Fucking I eat that sometimes. Like how dumb I am. It's just really fucking, so anyways, what I want to do is I have this old school fucking, you know, my house is built in 1923 so the garage whenever it was fucking built was built, um, to house like a fucking model t Ford kind of car and those things for those things, you sat inside the fucking wheel wells, you know what I mean? If you look at old cars, um, you know how the fenders used to flare out and then there was just the engine and you know, you sat like literally like right behind basically what you, you sat and I can't, I don't know if I'm explaining correctly. You know what I mean? You sitting inside the fucking wheel wheel wells, right? Not like literally in them, but as far as like the line down the side of the car, right?

Speaker 1:          00:30:49       Like if you stuck your head out and you didn't have any fenders on it, you'd be looking at the fucking tire. Right. As opposed to, you know, the fucking road. I know all you guys know what I'm talking about. Um, it also goes to show you, I like how fucking fat and in big people have gotten, you know what I mean? Two things, if you ever go to mount Vernon and he'd go to Thomas Jefferson's house and you have to duck underneath the fucking, uh, the, uh, the fuck Dee, calm the doorframes, you see how much taller people are. And then when you look at those old fucking cars, the fact that two adults could sit side by side like that and it wouldn't be, it probably won't even touch on each other, you know, so many ways. What I'm trying to say is that my, uh, my garage is long and skinny and it's like high up, you know, and uh, and then it kind of flares out at the back is, it kind of wraps around the back of the house a little bit.

Speaker 1:          00:31:43       So what I want to do, the, the front part is long enough for me to squeeze my truck in there. Um, but then in the back what I want to do is I want to turn that into like a little gym, which my wife has all four. And then I'm also pitching that I build the, maybe a little drum room that could actually, I got this drum kit that I bought that I haven't cases that if I want to play it, I have to throw it in the truck and drive it down to a studio. I'm thinking of making, building like a room within a room, which will add no value to the house unless I someday sell it to another fucking drummer who also whispers on his own fucking podcasts like his wife can't hear it. Fucking I'm still whispering. You know why? You know why?

Speaker 1:          00:32:24       Because the guys coming in like a half hour in, my wife is asleep downstairs. If she hears me yelling about it, I might have to have this argument sooner than I'm prepared to have it. So, um, that is the game plan. And like a couple months back I bought those holds. Um, you know, all those things like though that American Ninja Shit, so down downstairs in the garage, I want to just have those hanging from the ceiling so I can do all that grip strength shift that I want to get better at. By the way, I fucking started working out for the first time in forever and I went to Duke Code do pullups Holy Shit. I literally felt like, I was like, do I have sandbags in my pockets? What the fuck's going on? I did six good ones and whimpered through the last four. I always try to do 10.

Speaker 1:          00:33:08       I can't even fucking do it. It's pathetic. Um, so that's like the big exciting thing in my life right now. And I got to kind of get this thing going, um, before my wife wakes up and find something else to do in the house, you know, maybe, I don't know. So anyways, by the way, people, I'm doing a Gig in a van couver I'm doing a Gig in Vancouver, uh, Canada this Sunday night. A last second one that was added because I left my January open because I'm still waiting to hear about a season two. We, uh, meet with Netflix this week to pitch them our ideas for season two. Uh, so if you've already watched F is for family. I thank you so much because you've got me to at least getting the meeting. So we'll see. Uh, we will see what happens with that. And, um, so I hadn't booked anything in January.

Speaker 1:          00:34:06       So now we're having some last second gigs, um, coming up. I'm going to do a Gig in Vancouver this Sunday and then I'm going to do a couple of dates, one or two dates I think right before the Patrice O'Neal benefit. Um, in the tristate area. We're still, I'm trying to fucking iron those things out as we speak. Jesus Christ fills, spit it out. All right, let's get to the, uh, the questions of this week. Uh, all right. Inbox, inbox, inbox. Where's the content is the co no, I had it on the other page. What am I doing? Oh, there we go. All right. Bill Patriots first. Kansas City. Hello there. Mr. Barr. How's it going? You freckled cunt there? How I, yeah, I hope your holidays were just peachy. Same to Cleo in Nia. Uh, today. I just wanted to hear your honest and objective thoughts about the matchup between your paths in my chiefs this weekend.

Speaker 1:          00:35:00       I was just listening to your podcasts from 12, seven, 15. We'll, you said Casey won't win. Shit. Somebody tweeted me that. I said that. I talked so much trash, I don't even remember saying that. Uh, and I'm content that you may eat those words this week. Oh, absolutely. Oh, I absolutely might eat those words this week. Uh, but having said, I think I might, well, Casey, what, when Shit is, you're not going to win the super bowl. That's what I mean. My pick is, uh, the Seattle Seahawks, which is not really a, uh, it's not really a genius pick by any stretch of the means. They've been there two fucking years in a row. Um, I mean, didn't they win yesterday without Marshawn Lynch? I was running back and forth trying to make lasagna noodles. Uh, as far as I know, I didn't see Marshawn lynch in there. My wife was also clicking back and forth to like the fucking Golden Globes.

Speaker 1:          00:35:52       So, um, I just know that they, uh, now when our weight, that was, that was the earlier one dude, you know, yesterday I watched, I watched fucking Ohio state, Indiana. I watched two playoff football games and I watched half of a Celtic game and fell asleep was fucking ridiculous. So I'm trying to remember what the fuck I saw this weekend. But, um, no, I don't think it's going to be an easy a, listen, I gotta tell you this. If we were fucking healthy, we would kick the shit out of you. All right? If we actually had an offensive line and Edelman was back and Amygdala was back, we had a fucking running game and we, we, we've, we were healthy. This is no fucking contest at home. You know it and I know it right now, Brady is driving a fucking rental car. So you might go in there and beat us and then you get to get all fucking excited and loud, and then, you know what? I Dunno. You know, why would I root against you guys? Hey, you know what you guys have, you guys haven't won since what, 1970 right? What was that? Uh, what was that fucking Hank Sram call

Speaker 1:          00:36:59       power trap. Cross 57 five and drive. What the fuck was that thing called? I don't remember. You guys have an a, when you beat the fucking Vikings, Jesus Christ going way back, you beat the AFL team. That fucking sold off. Maybe that's why they're cursed. Maybe that's why they've lost, what did they lose? Three, three, four Superbowls. Three Superbowls. Right? They lost through the fucking chiefs. They lost to the pack. Is they lost to the dolphins and they lost to the Steelers. Is that right? Wait, the dolphins lost to the cowboys. Then they beat the vikings and they beat the Redskins. That's right. She speak the Vikings Green Bay B. Yeah. The chiefs.

Speaker 1:          00:37:53       They didn't beat the Raiders. Did they? They beat the vikings right now. The Vikings would have been in the NFL by then. I don't fucking room. Whatever. You lost like fucking three of them. Maybe because you'd get, you didn't stick with the AFL guys. Does that make any sense? Whatever. Good luck to the chiefs this week. Good luck to the Patriots. Obviously my heart is with the Patriots, but uh, you know, I don't know. I didn't lie like that dolphins game where every time Brady, the few times he went back to pass, it was just somebody writing his grill every fucking time. Um, but whatever the end of the fucking day, we have the greatest fucking quarterback and coach of all fucking time. So go fuck yourself. I think we're going to be, yeah. All right. It'd be no fun if I said good luck to you guys. So fuck you guys. You don't stand a chance there. Now if you'd beat me, you got something to talk about, then he could trash me and I can fill out a fucking hour next week on the podcast. Um, all right. Drive to school. Oh, by the way, Alabama. Clemson, I have no, I don't know shit about either team. I was so fucking busy in the fall. I didn't get to watch any of it, but of course, mmm. I wouldn't care if Alabama won, but Clemson hasn't one in a while. So I'd love to see them win. However, if, if Alabama wins, it just makes the Cleveland browns futility even funnier to me because

Speaker 1:          00:39:18       the dumbest fucking move ever. Do you realize that they had bill Bellacheck and Nick Saban coaching their team and they fired the, the Vus, the fucking Paul Brown, Vince Lombardi of the modern day NFL and the Paul Brown bear Bryant, Vince Lombardi

Speaker 1:          00:39:37       of Ncaa Division One football. They had them both coaching together and they fired. So if Alabama as a Cleveland Brown fan, you have to be rooting for Clemson. You just have to, you guys have had enough fucking pain. Right? Who knows, maybe Lebron can get you over the hump this year, you know, uh, roof a Cleveland, like I said, I have relatives, you know, family that grew up out there and all the type of shit. I, uh, I actually loved Cleveland. So, um, however, I also love a good joke. So if Alabama, Winston, and it'll still be funny. Anyways, continue one drive to school. Hey Bill, I've been a fan of yours since the O and a days and Chappelle show. Somewhere along the line I had a kid and he's old enough to listen to some of your podcast. Uh, I listened to it with him on the drive to school.

Speaker 1:          00:40:25       I listened to the whole episode before beforehand and cut out any of this stuff that is a bit heavy or sexual, uh, Jesus, you're fucking great dad. When you start editing that content, you know, look at you, you're a regular, typical, uh, not because I'm sheltering him, but because he and I don't need, don't need certain podcast moments. When you talk of ges in some skank before 8:00 AM exactly. Let the kid have a childhood, uh, trying to keep it light and positive with the exception of the funny negative. Anyways, I wanted to tell you that it's the best thing we got going. We listened to about 15 minutes a day. It puts him in eye and a laughing mood, which he needs schools a lot of work these days and he always got a ton of homework and projects and his dragon in the morning. This wakes them up. Sometimes we pause and talk about certain things or all explained certain stuff to him about politics, sports, et cetera. Yeah. In other words, correct. The dumb shit that I said, all that fathers, sons stuff. Uh, thanks for the parental assist. Ah, that's great. Who would have ever thought my ignorance could be hot, warm? Um, anyways, uh, I'm already regretting fucking making funny record your face. Why did I do that shit? But you know what I mean? He's making fun. Everybody on the show. It's only fair, right?

Speaker 2:          00:41:48       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:41:48       Does showing up with fucking acceptance speeches and he's got all those fucking zingers at him and his writing staff wrote. It's only fair. That's why I like Mel Gibson. They'll give some, gave him shit back. I don't understand why people just go out and smile and they should fucking trash them. A vasectomy. Ah, dear bill, I don't want to get a vasectomy. I just don't, my wife and anyone else who chimes in on the subject started trying to break down positives and point out the lack of negatives ever. Just not want something. I just don't want one. Can you believe this or you with everyone else said it must be rooted in some fear, et cetera. Fuck Dat dude. Fuck that. Are you fucking kidding me? Do you think you could fucking tell a woman what the fuck to do with her body for two seconds before she just said, you're a, you're a chauvinistic. Cont yeah, dude. Fuck that. Fuck that. All Day long. That's your fucking Dick and balls. All right. Dot. That they fuck with your deck. If you don't fucking want them to go in there and snip, snip, whatever the fuck I've even looked up the operation, I still don't get it. I don't get it.

Speaker 1:          00:42:56       Nothing comes out. So does it stop your ability to make judges, do they put an order down there where you got to milk the ges out as allow? That's disgusting. I, I don't get, I don't get what happens, but fuck that. Fuck that.

Speaker 1:          00:43:12       Fuck that. Just just sit down with you. I say, listen, I don't want to do that. And she'll be like, why? Why not you? You're just, you're just fear based. It's like, no, it isn't. I don't want to be walking around and it like, dude, you know what that's like. You like a muscle car and they want to rip the engine out and put a Fucking v six in there, fuck you and keep you Shelby badge on the side of your car and every day in the morning you wake up standing there looking at yourself after he got out of the shower, knowing that it's a lie. Fuck that dude. Fuck you. Keep the bullets of that gun. All right. She can't handle it. You know, I said, you know, what is she going to do to you? Huh? She gonna hold you down and make it while someone else does it. Just, yeah, you don't want one dude. You don't want one to the level you're reaching out to a fucking podcast.

Speaker 2:          00:44:09       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:44:10       okay. Do you understand that? Would even use that and make your argument just be like, I don't play this audio though. I would just say, listen, I so do not want to do this, that I actually wrote into a podcast to get advice. That's how much I don't want to do this. And then she'll just be like, well, maybe we need to go talk somebody about it, which means she's going to set up an appointment with somebody who agrees with her all cause she's gonna set up the appointment, gone. Listen, my husband needs to get a vasectomy. He's very nervous. He says he doesn't want to get it, but I, it's going to be the best for us and she's going to totally set the fucking table. It's like those dumb fucks that go on, Doctor Phil. Do you ever see those sad sacks that go on that fucking show with their wife?

Speaker 1:          00:44:56       Like they have a fucking prayer doctor? Phil's audiences, women. So he's going to have to side with the woman every fucking time. Even if he, you know, he's going to try to, you know, hide his hand and give her a little bit of Shit. But at the end of the day, he's going to be looking at you go, you need to get your balls snipped right. He's going to come at you like that while he sits there, you know, with his junk still fucking working. You know, he's got a giant fucking unit. Doesn't he do that big fucking goof, that big bulk goof. Walk down the hall that you know, he's got a fucking giant fucking unit. Big Gray, great Dane balls. I don't know why. I think he's got a fucking giant unit. He does. He's just like, he's just dug. But uh, the way he talks, he's just, God always gives them big dicks. It just, I don't know what it is. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:45:59       well this giant size 16 brown wooden wingtips just sitting across from you. That's gotta be the worst fucking show evidence. Oh my God. I never thought about doctor Phil's junk before you see that it takes somebody to fucking bring up a vasectomy, you'll never be able to think about him again. Megan, my big Dick say, you need to listen to your wife. All right. Jumping out of a plane. Hey Bill, where are you at on jumping out of a plane? Uh, if you're a chicken shit American, I'm a Brit. How much money would it take you to jump? Uh, I got a bet with my mate that you hate heights and it take 500,000 US dollars. Don't change your answer to be contrary to what I just guess. Keep it fair. Good sir. Thanks Jesus. Another arrogant Brit. These guys think they're fucking geniuses. Um, I've already done it.

Speaker 1:          00:47:02       You fucking idiot. And I paid someone to do it. I went to a, at Pepperell, Massachusetts when I was 19 years old and I didn't do a tandem jump either. I did a static line jump. I've told this story on the podcast, sir, if you're a little bit, um, more up on it. Uh, and also I have a pilot's license. I fly helicopters. So if I was afraid of heights, I mean, I'm afraid of heights. Look, if I don't have a parachute on my back and I'm not in a, in a, in a vehicle that's designed to fly,

Speaker 2:          00:47:41       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:47:41       then yes, I'm afraid of heights. Like, I don't like, uh, you know, like if he should, like one time I watched a youtube video and they just showed these guys that had the climb up to the top of this fucking building

Speaker 2:          00:47:57       and then,

Speaker 1:          00:47:59       no, not clients. They took the elevator, who's getting hope? They, they, they were on the roof and it was already on the fucking roof. This building was so fucking high up and you know, the wind up there must be ridiculous. I would literally just lay down in the fetal position and crawl back to the fucking door that leads to the stairwell, reach up to the handle and fucking go back down. But this, this dude,

Speaker 2:          00:48:24       mmm.

Speaker 1:          00:48:27       Then climbs the fucking, the, the, the whatever, the radio tower or whatever and it just keeps getting higher and higher and higher in the tower gets smaller and smaller and smaller and he's hooking and unhooking his safety line. I literally, I couldn't find, I mean obviously the guy live cause it's his GoPro on his helmet and I've never been so fucking unsettled watching something in my life. Okay. Then I would hate heights. But I think at that point everybody hates heights. But, um, yeah, when I was 19 years old, I went to this place in Pepperell, Massachusetts, which I don't think exists anymore. They might still be an airport there and they had a, uh, uh, school and uh, I did the static line jump. If you've ever seen that movie, a Fandango when a Kevin Costner's earlier ones where the dude from a breakfast club, uh, Judd Nelson, his character jumps out.

Speaker 2:          00:49:28       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:49:30       That's exactly what I did. And I remember when we went up, the command was sitting in the door, get out, and then he slapped you on the shoulder and it said go.

Speaker 2:          00:49:41       And uh,

Speaker 1:          00:49:44       I remember when he said, sit in the door. I thought he was saying close the door. So I was reaching up, I'm sitting down, reaching up, trying to close the door, and he had this big smile on his face. Like he thought I was chickening out. I feel like I just told this story on the podcast and then I find Rosa who's saying, sit in the door. So you sit in the door and basically it's one of those planes were the, the wing is above the aircraft. Do you know what I'm, it's on top of the aircraft as opposed to below, which actually gives you a much better site I would think, um, as far as if you wanted to look down. Um, and then there's the support that goes to the side of the plane. So, and then right above one of the landing wheels, the wheels don't retract on this plane.

Speaker 1:          00:50:23       They had a welded a little step. So you sat the fucking door and uh, I forget how high we were at going to say we will only like 1500. We weren't that high yet because you shoot immediately comes out. Um, so you said you sit in the door, then he goes get out and then what you do is you reach out and you grab that support be from the wing and you hold onto that while one of your feet is, uh, is standing on that little step thing. And then basically what you do is literally acting this out. So I can remember is you then basically you, you bend your arms and you bring your chest, like flush with the support beam and then the, the, the foot that's dangling, you put it straight out behind you. It's almost like a yoga pose. So it was sit in the door, get out, and then he slaps his shoulder and he goes, go and you let go. And then you, you arch you arc, right? Arc One arc, 1002, 1003, 1000. Look, if nothing, look, reach, pull. And when you're looking, you're looking over your shoulder to see if your shoot came out. And then if nothing, you look down at the handle, reach it. Because for some reason they say if you don't look down, you might be flailing because you're panicking because it's the first time you jumped in the chute didn't come out. Sorry. Cayenne pepper. Ah, hang on a second.

Speaker 1:          00:51:53       So anyways, I get out, he goes, go, I let go. And instead of arching ice, I don't know what I did. I just reached for something. All I know is I started doing front front flips as my shoot was coming out and I felt it go by my leg, the inside of my leg, I felt it go by my leg. I felt something hit that and I was immediately thinking, oh my God, I'm going to roll right up in this fucking thing. Like, you know when you put Bacon on shrimp. And uh, the second I had that thought like to shoot already had come out. And by the grace of God, I didn't get tangled up. I think about that sometimes. Like how easily I could have fucking died. Um, and then boom, you shoot comes out and when you shoot comes out, you don't even feel like you're falling because there's nothing going past you because you're above the tree line and all that.

Speaker 1:          00:52:53       So you just feel like you're just sort of suspended in the air. And, uh, there was a radio and this lady just talk to you and she say pull the left toggle and you had to pull it all the way down to unique cause I remember there was this, this big girl in the class and she couldn't get it around her hips and she landed across the street and a pile of loom and dislocated her knee. I remember that before. And then I went up after her and I was just like, fuck. Um, and then they have this ridiculous, you know when you get to the tree line you suddenly realize how you're falling. I think it was like 17 feet per second or maybe 11 feet. I can't remember. But it was really fast. It was like basically, you know, jumping off of a, of a basketball rim.

Speaker 1:          00:53:36       Like how fast you'd come down. It had to be a little bit slower, right? Oh No. Cause you're not reaching terminal velocity. I don't fucking know. So all I know is when you hit the ground, what you were supposed to do is look straight ahead because for some reason if you look down at your feet, what you were going to do, they were worried. You pick your feet up too quickly and somehow break your legs. So what you had to do is look straight ahead. And as right as you hit the ground, you supposed to do this little fucking like collapse down and then this big ridiculous, bring it both your legs straight up in the air and then over to your side. I don't know why. I doubt that they still have people do that. And I did. What everybody else did is I came down and the second my feet hit the ground, I did a face plant right into the grass and my buddy grab the uh, the Mike from the person that called me a dickhead, something like that.

Speaker 1:          00:54:26       What a dickhead or something in the um, in the, in the radio. Um, so yeah, there you go. So I did it. And what are you basing chicken shit. American art. Huh? Oh, you tough guys over there with your fish and chips. Have you done it yet? 500 years. I, there's nothing you can sub. If I don't want to do something, I wouldn't do it. It's not money that you could give me. I know he goes, Doug, fuck a break. Now I'm making great money. I got enough money. I've got enough money. I'm good to take my life in my fucking hands. Now, that's one of those things out. And when I was back working at the warehouse, I mean, granted I pay somebody when I was working in a fucking warehouse, I a shit, you know, let's see. How much would they, I mean, if they gave me, literally, if you gave me $400, you would have doubled my pay for the week. So I would have done that. Well, let's see. Let's go back to the building to climb up that building.

Speaker 2:          00:55:30       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:55:30       How much money would they have to give me a, when I was working in the warehouse, a $800.

Speaker 2:          00:55:38       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:55:39       And that now for that, that building, uh, I would say, uh, yeah, I just wouldn't do it. I'm all right. I'm all set. I'm all set. I, you know, I should actually send you guys said video.

Speaker 2:          00:55:53       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:55:54       So it's not that I hate heights, sir. I hate, I'm risking my life to that level. If there's like a parachute or something like that, it is a bungee cord or there's like a fucking safety line, that's fine. But you know it going up that tower where I have to unhook the safety line and then hook it back up and there's wind and shit. Fuck that. That's too much of a risk. I wouldn't do that, but uh,

Speaker 2:          00:56:21       you know, why

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       don't I ain't, what the fuck I'm talking about it college cooking Billy. Oh, that's a great one. What a great one. Bill it. Billy Boy D. Oh fuck. I gotta wrap this up. This guy's coming in 12 minutes. Uh, I'm sure everyone is blowing you up to make another cooking video, so don't worry. This isn't that I'm a college student. I know you've lived like a college student, India early thirties, from past stories about living with Bobby Kelly, us do. We weren't living like college students. We will live in like fucking animals. Do you have any menu suggestions besides pasta? What would you mix together? I'm pretty crew creative and I do all right, but I'm open to some suggestions. What's good to throw together on a budget and on a fly. You know what dude? I would go to, um, I would, this is what I would do.

Speaker 1:          00:57:14       I would go on Youtube and I would ask that question and you'll find videos and then just start searching in. At some point you're going to connect with somebody and I feel like I'm, you know, dropping the ball here on the question, but like I'm not a chef. I'm not even a cook. Um, really early on this to this myself. So that's what I would do. There's a bunch of old episodes of Mario, Mario Batali's, multiple Mario, M. O. L. T. O. Mario. Um, I really suggest watching those. Just watch the guy. I used to just watch the show and just by watching it, you learn things and you start to see how things are made. Um, and, and uh, the big thing is not having, you just have to, to learn shit in life. You got to have the, the mindset of like, I'm gonna, you know, I'm going to fuck this up probably the first time and that's all right.

Speaker 1:          00:58:11       And then I'll get a little better like the pasta already, just even just running it through the pasta maker. I already have like three, three fucking things that I'm not going to do the next time. Um, and by the way, somebody gave me a great tip when you're after you find kneaded the dough and you put it through your pasta maker, be sure to, to douse like both sides with flour, be liberal with the flower. Cause if you don't, it's going to tear. It could tear when you're in there because it's supposed to be like sticky and elastic at the same time. And, uh, when you run it through there, um, yeah, you could, you could possibly have some issues and it tears. Then it's a big fucking pain in the ass and then he gets sad. You feel like a fucking failure and you're not, he had the balls to try it.

Speaker 1:          00:58:51       So I would, uh, I go that Rachel Ray's got a great bunch of great ones from back in the day. Everybody always makes fun of her, but she would, if she had made 20 million meals, he had a little fucking lab sheet do. I used to watch a shit all the time. That's great shit for probably where you're at. But I would also Google some stuff like that. Um, but it's great as a college student, if you start to learn how to cook, if you start to learn how to cook right now and you do it religiously, you are going to be a fucking beast compared to the average person. Um, by that time you were in your 30 stowed, forget it. If you add like shit, like learning how to, how to make a pie crust cause then then you can make Turkey pot pie. You can make key, she can make all of this shit.

Speaker 1:          00:59:37       He started making homemade pasta. Forget it. It's fucking over. Then you learn how to do all this other stuff. I forget what I mean. I made it with Nia. I was really concentrating on making the pasta. She did the Bowland A's and then she did the whole milk sauce thing. But I just was watching her do that. When you heat, heated up some butter and some flour and then he heated up some milk. Then you poured the whole thing together instead of using like a ricotta cheese, um, arena, that type of shit. Um, you use this really rich milk thing. It was almost too much. The fucking dish was like, it almost tasted like a dessert. It was so fucking good. But um, I didn't know how to do shit when I was your age. So I think it's great that you're doing it. Um, you know, you want, how about Blue Apron?

Speaker 1:          01:00:23       Sign up for that shit and just, you know, steal some of them meal ideas and then expand on them. If there's a, in the earth is a style of cooking that they give you, then you go on Youtube and uh, you just start looking at recipes about that. Like, you know what I don't know anything about, which is weird because I loved the food is any sort of Asian style, um, cooking. I actually smoked some ribs and I, and I had this, uh, this dipping sauce that was like, you know, whatever Chinese or Japanese influenced, you know, with the fucking soy sauce and all that. And it was, and I was in a part of the grocery store that I never went to and it was the shit. It tasted great. And, um, that's something I was kinda thinking this year I want to get down pasta and, and started to have some Asian, uh, type dishes in there. So if there's anybody out there that can help me with that, I'd appreciate it. So anyways, the guys coming here in eight minutes, I get to upload this fucker. Um, I'll talk to you later.
