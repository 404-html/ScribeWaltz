Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's the Monday morning podcast for Monday, May 19th, 2048 barometric pressure outside is about 75 both. Um, welcome. Welcome to another edition of this. Um, I don't know what the fuck it is. It's a God damn podcast. All right. What are you doing right now? Are you at the gym? So it's, somebody told me recently you always think were cubicles when I can kill, because some of us are on treadmills. So hello to all the people on treadmills. Ah, you're running at this point and you're just starting. He just started on your treadmills, on your treadmill, I should say, unless you're running on more than one, I mean you're, that dude is the Douche, the treadmill Douche in the gym right now. You know that person who for some reason I do burn more calories when you go backwards, you know? Or is that some sort of mating ritual where you get your ball sent fucking blown the other way and that somehow attracts the women on the elliptical behind you? I don't know what it is. You ever seen these fucking jerk offs? They run backwards. Then they go sideways because I got to have a lot of lateral movement and the fucking office. You never know when the boss is going to call an audible and start pointing to your side of the fucking tubes. Right?

Speaker 1:          00:01:19       Like you turn it around yelling at cornerback down on the fucking break room. What are you running sideways for? Why are you running backwards? You fuck a Dosha? Then you fall and you break your tail bone and who do you sue? Huh? Chicago fitness. Whatever the fuck you at. Whatever the fuck you at. Wherever the fuck your at. Sorry.

Speaker 1:          00:01:40       All right. You know what? I have to admit something and I have to call just to the people of Chicago. When I pictured somebody in Chicago running backwards, I pictured, you know, a fat guy with a mustache in a bear's hat. You guys really have never outlive that sketch in my, I guess in my world, you know Deb bears and I know nobody says that they're, they might say a version of it, but nobody says that. But to me, you guys were always going to be those, those, those guys. I mean I, you probably shouldn't give a fuck what I think, but you know, somewhere somewhere there's somebody in Chicago that does give a shit. You give a shit. You know what you guys need to do to lift just fucking self esteem out there with that whole second city horse shit. The next generation of babies that are born and turn instead of telling them it's Lake Michigan, just tell them it's an ocean.

Speaker 2:          00:02:30       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:02:30       Michigan Ocean Assam Shit. And maybe you'll have the arrogance of someone who lives on the coast and people will start taking you seriously.

Speaker 2:          00:02:38       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:02:39       What are you going to say right now? CHICAGO? Huh? Oh, what about our Chicago Black Hawks talkie? You're not controlling finance like they are in New York City. How many old people are you stealing from in Chicago right now? The way they are in downtown Manhattan. I'm just fucking you. I know Chicago is one of the most corrupt fucking cities out there. You got to give it respect overtly racist fucking with the finance home is some of the fucking top mob guys throughout history and they got the Chicago Black Hawks. So I will tell you, I don't think anybody's fucking stopping it, but I'll get to that later via the bank and downstairs. Um, as you said that slowly but surely I'm getting the fucking house repaired and I know you think about Jesus Christ the fuck speak in a lake, Michigan. When did that water pour into your house? That was like over a year ago.

Speaker 1:          00:03:32       Yes it was. And I fixed the upstairs, but the downstairs was built like a fucking tree for. So what I decided to do was rather than just rebuild, what the fuck was there, I decided to knock it all out and start from scratch and build what the fuck should have been there. And if anybody knows me and they look at what the Dick Jokes in my act, you can tell the level of quality that I expect from that job downstairs. Hey, is the podcast loud enough right now? Everybody complaints? Make my fucking ears heart right now. How loud I have this turned up. I think I have it down. I don't know what the fucking deal is. I hope it's not going to be overly loud, but every week somebody goes, dude, I can't even fucking hear the tick. Um, so anyways, this was, this was my week. I guess I got to talk about NHL first because the first thing before all the bullshit is I watched my boss, my boss to blue orange. Uh, absolutely fucking blow it against the Montreal Canadians. I'm just going to pause here for all the feminist French guys clapping their hands together, like to plant patty cake with themselves, you know, with your colorful socks.

Speaker 1:          00:04:45       Um, unbelievable that, that was so fucking embarrassing to lose that, that series. It was so fucking like the way we lost it. It's on bearing the loses the Canadians. It sucks. But that was the first time in a long time.

Speaker 2:          00:05:04       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:05:05       I'm going to go back to the 80s that I felt that at like embarrassed turning point in the series. I'm going to say Sean Thornton spraying the water at fucking PK. Suba. Why would you do that? Why would you fucking do that for those of you don't watch hockey? We were down two games to one and they won the first game. So immediately we lost home home, ice advantage, whatever the fuck that means. Right? So we went game to, now it's one one we go into their building, they win game two they are holding surf. So we come in, we got to win game four we fucking winning game five can we take control of the fucking series we win. Game five is Paul Versey told me, Joe Tory said the two most important games to win in a seven game series he felt was game two and game five which totally makes sense because if you lost game one you have to win game two or else you got to win for next five you got to even that motherfucker, right?

Speaker 1:          00:06:00       And then game five you win game five all you gotta do is win one of two. You lose game five you got to win six or seven bill. It's simple math. We'll believe it or not. Some people don't know it. So we win game five, this two and a half minutes to go. They're judging the Canadians a dejected, they had the series by, they'll fucking proverbial balls over there and they let the Bruins right back in it and now they're on the verge of fucking elimination. So what do we do? What do we do? Fuck heads that we were one of the people on our team decides to not only for no fucking reason. Spray water at not only somebody on the other team, that best fucking player, the player that the other people probably rally around because he's fucking the best guy in the fucking team.

Speaker 1:          00:06:48       We spray water in his God, Deb face the dumbest fucking thing you ever remember those old Batman episodes in the 1960s where they'd have the guy off Batman or Robin is this sit for a cape crusaders but blue bubble and they will look like they were fucking dead and the bad guy always did fucked it up somehow. That was the moment right there. That was the fucking moment. He sprays it in that. So then, you know, you knew they were going to come out like gangbusters. I said it last week. I didn't think that they were going to win game six. I didn't think we'd get pummeled for games, for goals to four to nothing. That's what happened. They completely dominated wire to fucking wire dominated that fucking game. So then we go down to game seven and I had a, I didn't have a vibe either way.

Speaker 1:          00:07:37       Are we going to win and we're going to lose? I didn't know, but it's not like the old days when the Canadians fucking owned us. They don't, they haven't since fucking 1987 despite what these fucking idiots will, right. Because they're lazy. Sportswriters not only is it been even, we've actually had the better of it for the last fucking 30 years or so. So, you know, it was a 16 fucking league. Okay. With an expansion six was the tail end of that Horse Shit. All right, can we get over it already? Jesus. Today I could share my shelf enough already. It's fucking over. He's dead. And so is everybody else that watched him give that speech. Um, anyways, that probably not, but who gives a fuck? So we go into game seven and uh, it's the usual shit. I don't think I can remember a series where we miss more fucking open nets, hit more crossbars.

Speaker 1:          00:08:26       We were like, I don't know what happened. I Dunno what the fuck happened. A couple of our guys couldn't hit the side of a fucking bar and I still love him. I don't think they need to shake up the team. I love that shit. Whenever you lose a series they'll do, you know, so, so decisions have to be made. You got to make some like, like you, you don't have what happened. We had a bad fucking series. So anyways, um, the game ends in an a handshake line. Lucita is telling a couple of, you told a couple of you supposed to just go through the line and no matter what, Grit your teeth, good game, good game

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       graduations, good luck in the next round, whatever the hey man, you know, you were great, you got the better of me, whatever the fuck you supposed to say. But Luciano did that for a couple of players and then a couple other players, he said, I'm going to fucking kill you, which you're not supposed to do. And uh, I just wasn't a good look. The whole thing, you know, it's fun. It's kind of ironic that it made fun of how the bad boys, the bad boy pistons, the fucking cheap shot out is how they fucking went out. And they ended up not being in bad boys that went out like punks when they didn't shake the bowls hands or whatever the fuck they were playing. I don't want troop. When they walked off, I thought we had elements of that. Not saying everybody Charo was a fucking warrior. He was obviously hurt. The guy looked like me on skates by game seven. He was literally falling down out there. But um, but whatever, man. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:09:46       I don't like that shit. I don't like the water bottle. I don't like that saying that shit in the line. So it actually in a weird way, ease the fucking pain because I'm not one of those fans that fucking hates that behavior until people on my team do it. I just, I dunno, I didn't fucking like it.

Speaker 3:          00:10:00       And, uh, even if it worked, I didn't like it. Let's say it worked and we won the series. I don't, I don't, I don't fucking like that shit. So anyways, uh, congratulations to the Canadians definitely deserved it. And as much as I hate people saying no real classy, they actually won with class and uh, you know, I didn't have a problem with the guy mocking blue Cheech fucking pounding of his chest when he scored an empty net goal. I mean, you got to think someone's going to give you shit for that and you don't let it

Speaker 1:          00:10:30       get under your skin. And I think they got under his skin. I still love the guy. I'm not shitting on him, but they, they got the better of you and we lost. So there you go.

Speaker 3:          00:10:39       And that's how it works. So now

Speaker 1:          00:10:42       blue block a rules are now playing the fucking Canadians and they got fucking smoked. And the first one, but that doesn't mean shit. That's just one loss. How many coaches have you heard say, I don't care. It's shoving Joe a Chevy Joe. Joe Joy cop one watch. Oh, we could go try learn shop from niche law. Shit. Y'all going in checking game and tried to get about this one. Um, which is what I think they're going to do.

Speaker 3:          00:11:07       And um, my apologies. So ranger fans because uh, there's just something about you. I don't hear that. Bang. There you go. That's the guys downstairs. Um, I just, I don't fucking, uh, I just, I don't believe in the rangers there. I said it obviously I believe in your goal tender. I believe in the energy that uh, Martin, Saint Martin, Saint Louis over the fuck you say his name. I believe in that shit. I just don't think you have enough weapons. And then also I think you're very, even with the Canadians, despite that seven to two, I might eat kraut.

Speaker 1:          00:11:42       I did really well on the first round when the high seeds play the low seats. Oh, I was picking them right and left.

Speaker 3:          00:11:51       This just, I didn't watch a lot of the rangers this year, but I'm going to go.

Speaker 2:          00:11:58       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:11:58       Just with the history of both teams, the exact thing I told you to ignore it when I was talking about the Canadians and Bruins, I'm now going to bring up the Canadian history because I think it applies in this one. So send you fucking hate mail to me. I don't give a shit. I think it applies where they evenly fucking matched and

Speaker 2:          00:12:20       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:12:21       Because the Canadians have their history and their history of winning their fan base expects them to win and I've seen it in other sports. When you have a fan base that believes like that, they're able to sometime push a mediocre team up to a higher level. I'm not saying they're mediocre, but I think that they're going to, it's just going to be a different vibe there tonight when they play.

Speaker 2:          00:12:47       Hmm.

Speaker 3:          00:12:47       Like the fans will have that vibe. We're not going to tolerate you going down oh two they just don't do it. Yankee Stadium, old Yankee stadium had that sound. I'm still getting used to the new Yankee stadium, but the fans know the fucking game. They know what's on the line. They're the ones that's the Yankee fans started that shit with two strikes. You start fucking clapping, right? They understand the fucking game. Canadian fans do the same range of fans. Great fence. I would actually say better fans and the Canadians because they've put up with being a fucking ranger fan. But the thing about the rangers and you got to own up to this range of fear. Maybe you don't have to, but I feel don't you fucking you. You are good. If you're a true range of fan, you're waiting for the other shoe to drop.

Speaker 3:          00:13:29       That is the legacy of the New York Rangers. So it's a series like this where they finally turned it around, I guess. Well I guess they got it when another fucking cup. Cause other than you know, you know the deal. I don't need to bring up your past stats other than the 1994, I'll do it for people who don't watch hockey other than 1994. I mean, you're talking like a fucking talking. Basically they've won one cup and 74 years. It's not a good look. Okay. The first, you know, 27 years of that, they were only competing with six other fucking five other teams. Okay. So, um, I just feel that the Canadians are going to be able to power their way through and uh, somehow in this series, I hope it's a great series to original six teams. You got to love that. And then out in the West you got the fucking black hawks original six first and expansion six with the, uh, the La Kings. And uh, I feel that that is the Stanley Cup final right there. Whoever wins that, um, I don't know how evenly matched they are. I think that King's might've been a little tired in that first game. It was only three to one, but, uh, I don't know. I said it a while back. The fucking, it's the Blackhawks the loose. I think they have a little bit of a tough time with the kings and then they just fuck up either. The Canadians are the ranges. That's what I think now if your or the other teams, you

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       should be real excited right now because I don't think I had been right since the first fucking route. Okay. Um, all right. So there's my hockey, my hockey speak for the week. Oh, it rhymed. Holy Shit. Hey, can I hype a couple of things right now while you have no fucking choice, you've got to listen to it. Uh, the all in comedy tour, the Monday morning podcast presents the all in comedy tour. They're going to be yet hilarity his comedy club.

Speaker 3:          00:20:49       Back to the podcast. Um, all right. So this weekend, um, I had, uh, I had a relative graduated from law school, so I had to fly back to Boston, go right. And every time I go back to Boston, they fucking build something else and tore something down that I loved and then fucking put something else in place of it. And I go, well, what happened to it this time? I went back and he'll, top steakhouse was fucking closed. I was on my way up to giggles comedy club to uh, I thought only do one show. I did two shows. I should've kept it at one. I went into the second room and I didn't realize that it was a church group. Swear to God trying to raise money for something and Ooh, Oh, did, oh Billy boy munches fucking balls on that one. Jesus Christ. It was a legitimate bomb fucking wire to wire. It just was not a stellar moment in it. Like you ever see when a plane goes to take off and it just, it's just not at the right speed and just fucking just clips the trees that like, that's what happened. Then it disappears into them. You're like, oh, maybe they landed safely than this. The fireball. That was my set.

Speaker 3:          00:22:04       Uh, but the other place, it was worth it. Cause the first one, it was magic. It was a great, do you believe in magic? Um, in the fucking main room. That one was great. So, um, I got to work with Tony V, one of my favorites and a Yada, Yada, Yada. At the next fucking day, I go to the, I go to the graduation and you know, you know the deal with graduations, you like, oh my God, this is going to fucking suck. All right, this is going to be long. This is going to be hot. It's going to be hot and long. It's going to suck. It sounds like a fucking point over here. It's horrific. All right. And a pleasant surprise. We show up. It's indoors, it's fucking air conditioning. The Dean comes out, she starts fucking talking crushes it, brings up some political guy. He goes up, fucking crushes it. Then they bring up the guest speaker. All right. This is like when a basketball teams going on a run and everybody's standing up freaking out. That eight Tevo rather are the sole Ipos, the fucking speakers, a crushing it. Then they bring up the guy that they hired to speak and he comes fucking walked. Dr Barack Obama, blue, blue, blue, whatever the fuck his name is. He comes walking up. This is how we started his speech. He goes, before I speak, I would like to say something.

Speaker 3:          00:23:35       I swear to God, that's what he said. That's one of the greatest fucking lines I ever heard before I speak. I would like to say something and immediately are just sitting there going like, Oh God, this is going to be at least

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       47 to 52 fucking minutes of absolute fucking boredom at, uh, fortunately I was Ra like most of my NHL picks. I was wrong. This guy crushed it. It, oh, sorry. Talking about being a little kid and born in fucking Nazi Poland, Nazi occupied Poland, Poland, excuse me, and how the fuck you got out of their survivor's guilt and how have you become a lawyer? You don't have to be a fucking content. You can actually work pro bono and help change the world for a better plane. It was a great speech. Crushed it. Right now all of a sudden they handle out diplomas. I'm like, Holy Shit, they're going to get this fucking thing done in two and a half hours. This is going to be great. Fucking great. And then we're out to the fucking bears in the, in the food and everything's great. They hand them all out and that's it. And then the dean comes back and inexplicably starts fucking talking.

Speaker 2:          00:24:39       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:24:40       keep talk. 10 minutes later, still fucking talking and a, and everybody getting restless and it's just like, what the fuck? What the fuck is this person doing? And then like 15 minutes in, it was so bad. It just started to become funny. I mean, everybody was running for her, wrap it up in 30 seconds and 15 minutes and she goes, I'm going to tell this. This is just an aside. And she told the fucking side story that had nothing to do with the other story and all this shit she was saying was basically what everybody else had said.

Speaker 2:          00:25:16       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:25:17       20 minutes, 25 minutes in, 30 minutes in. And I swear to God, dude, I like I started, I started getting angry because I was all the way in, up against the wall. I was starting to feel trapped and I started thinking, she's doing this on purpose. This is a fucking power trip. And then mercifully, it fucking finally ended like 35 minutes later, 35 fucking minutes later. And she didn't have a clue

Speaker 1:          00:25:43       how much she was annoying the shit out of everybody. The only thing that was keeping me going was looking around at people. People were doing everything. People were, were just sort of sitting there like looking at the side of their head at the person next to them. A couple other people had done that. Uh, uh, what's known as the confessional posts or you're seated and you've got your elbows on your knees and your head is hanging in, your hands are clasped. There was a lot of that going on. There was a other people not even trying to hide it, looking around behind them like a year fucking shitting me that look not just over the right shoulder, left shoulder to right fucking double threat with that.

Speaker 1:          00:26:22       There was people, I was right near, uh, the section, I wasn't near the wall near the railing and then that was like an exit right next to me. And this one fuck guy, he walked in, walked out, walked in, walked out, walked into third time and he literally put his hands out like, you know, like one of the reps make a fucked up. The call itself fucked up. Even the head coach doesn't even know it is. And then they're talking about it, trying to get it right and they've come to a decision and they don't inform the coach and he just kind of puts his hands out like the fuck Hap, what? What's, what's going on? Am I getting fucked her mom? I am, I am I going to come out all right in this. So literally just doing that and then finally she wrapped it up.

Speaker 1:          00:27:01       It was still a good time. It was still a good graduation. But, uh, I dunno that Dean, I swear to God, it was just like my performance of giggles. I should've stopped at the first little performance. I should've ended it. That it was just, it was horrific. Okay. So anyways, the next day I ended up going down to Nashville.

It's right with the Nashville predators play. They got all the Honky tonks there and they got all the play. I don't know if they call them that anymore, whenever all that, all the fucking country music and all that shit. And uh, and right around the corner, right off this little street is the Ryman theater. And um, that's where the original Grand Ole Opry was at from like 1930 something to 1974. And, um, basically who was anybody

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       got to perform even before then, before he was even the Grand Ole Opry. It was a, uh, of, of Vaudeville, um, space. So all these other guys, you know, I imagine Charlie Chaplin, I mean, he was doing the rounds. He was working the road buster Keaton, WC fields, they had his, his, uh, headshot. I'm hanging in there. So we've got see that, that's how much history this place, even when the people that I'm freaking out about the Hank Williams, you know, ah, patsy Cline and all of them, even when they perform there, that place was already legendary. And, um, they actually had a couple strips of wood from the original stage. So everybody who came out to perform had to go and step on them and distinct that, you know, you know, all these unbelievable performance, uh, had been there. And, um, I'm not going to lie to you.

Speaker 3:          00:33:32       It was one of the best shows I've had in my entire career. I don't know what happened. I went out there and, uh, usually it takes me a second to get a little warmed up, get a vibe for the room. But I walked out there and they used to be a church, so they have all the original pews. It was made in like 1898, so they still had all the original pews. Um, I'm telling you right now, if you go to Nashville, you gotta go, you gotta go see a fucking show there. There's a bunch of other great venues there and stuff, but you got to go like I heard Neil young played there, um, recently. I mean that's one that I would just stop what I was doing, get on a plane to go to the Ryman theater and just sit in a fucking pew from 1898 and watched Neil young. I mean that's just incredible. So somehow a shit head like me told enough Dick Jokes and next thing you know, I'm the next guy on the show. So I walk out there and the sun's going down and up in the upper deck. It's really small. Lots smaller than I thought it was going to be because people were smaller back then and they pack them in and there wasn't all this extra crap luxury boxes and everything. So

Speaker 3:          00:34:42       whatever it was like a 2000 seat or 1800 seater and it was the size of like, I swear to God, like a lot of 500 seat theaters. It's unbelievable. We're literally tripled the fucking size of these people, I guess. So anyways, up top, they had these stained glass windows so the sun was going down.

Speaker 4:          00:34:59       All right.

Speaker 3:          00:35:01       The sunlight's coming through the stained glass windows, it looks like the fucking blues brothers moment. And uh, I went out there and it was a great crowd and I was on, I started talking, they started laughing and I swear to God, I almost did like two hours. I'd be like an hour and 45 minutes and I left out like three huge bits then I'm going to do on my special.

Speaker 4:          00:35:24       MMM.

Speaker 3:          00:35:26       You know, you gotta have your blocks. When I put together a new hour and I feel like I got the,

Speaker 4:          00:35:33       I got it

Speaker 3:          00:35:34       together is you need that big opener, got to have the big closer. And then you got to have like, you got to have three or four big ones in the middle, you know, and then you got your little ones, you give him the rest, then you go back new big one, give a little wrestling, give him to take up on a little ride. Um, but you got to have like you got to have the four corners there to build the structure is how I view it. I Dunno. I Dunno why I don't have a good science background, but that's how I fucking viewed the thing. And um, I dunno. I, I've had so much fun. I'm having more fun than I ever had doing standup, so I have more than enough at this point. And um,

Speaker 3:          00:36:15       that's the only concern I have when I go to tape. This thing is I don't want it to be overly long, but I also want to document those jokes so I don't know what I'm going to do either do all of them and then cut the special and then have those as extras. I have no fucking clue how I'm going to do it. But you know what, it's a great fucking problem to have. So anyways, backstage and you can take a tour of this is they have up on the third floor, they have the Johnny Cash room and they have the Hank Williams room and then you go down the floor beneath it. They have second floor. They have. That's where all the womens are because men are better. We're above on floor number three. And then on floor number two, they had like the Patsy Cline. I'm the Patsy Cline room. And then, uh, what else was the fucker? I'm just so bad at country stars. This is really bad. I have no fucking idea who they hit.

Speaker 3:          00:37:14       I'm sorry. I just painted the whole picture and then just drop the brush. Just let you guys fall right off the fucking canvas. I'm sorry, I don't remember, but it was fucking amazing. I actually went, I actually came out to Patsy Cline when I was there. I know it's hacking. It's touristy, but uh, it was cool. I've always liked her. And um, there's actually rumors that she stayed on the street that I live in out, uh, live on out here in la. There's rumors that she actually rented a house on the block that I live on. And, uh, that's one of the really cool things to completely make a left turn here about living in Los Angeles is if you are in an area with a bunch of old houses, there's going to be somebody fucking lived in it at this point. Hollywood and people trying to make movies as we're coming up on a hundred years, aren't we? Um, as far as it actually getting going, Hollywood land and all that type of shit, this, do you know that there, there's a, there's a house, um, I actually read about when it was for sale.

Speaker 4:          00:38:19       MMM.

Speaker 3:          00:38:21       Somewhere here in Hollywood are, maybe it's, I don't know what the fuck it is, but basically the person who owned the house, they owned it during a prohibition and then it had a pool and an a cabana. So it's during prohibition. And he now the deal, what if they outlawed boost? I mean, how quickly would that be a black market? And you'd be fucking drinking in somebody seller, you know, knocking, you know, what's the password? The password is a, you know, 23 Skidoo or whatever and you fucking get in. Right. So, um, this person made a bar, uh, they turned their Cavana into like a bar and they just built this little bar. And then I don't know if they even made their beer in the bathtub or they had some sort of hook up who knows what and all these famous people from way back in the day, Louie Armstrong, Humphrey Bogart, all these people or whatever,

Speaker 4:          00:39:13       mmm.

Speaker 3:          00:39:15       Went over there and drank and they all carved their names into the bar and it's still there. So when you went to go look at the house, you could actually go look at this piece of history and it's actually protected. Like they make sure if you buy the house, like you can't tear it down or sell it or any of that type of shit. So,

Speaker 4:          00:39:32       mmm.

Speaker 3:          00:39:34       All of these fucking, you know, all these icons, they had to fucking live somewhere. So anyways, the rumor is the urban myth on the street that I live on is that she either on this street and the next street overstayed in a house, rented it while she was doing, I don't know what. So it was kind of cool. Anyways, to come back out, uh, to come out with a, can you tell I flew today. I'm always out of my fucking mind when I fly, my brain's all over the place. I've had a fucking brutal day. I apologize. Do you know when I, when I went to the airport this morning, Nashville, and, uh, it was this extra long line and you don't just stand there and I left enough time where I could get through it and um, I'm coming up right to where you begin disrobing and all that shit. Right. And um,

Speaker 4:          00:40:20       yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:40:21       they end up, uh, the lovely Nia. What's going on? How are you? I'm telling my, uh, my airport story from this morning. So, uh, no, not even that one. He has his, his story. So I'm standing in line. Does long fucking security line Jesus bill, get to the point. I know. So I'm getting ready to, it's becoming my turn. Why get to fucking take off the belt and the sneakers and fucking get through the damn thing. And all of a sudden I hear this person behind going, excuse me, thank you for giving me skill needs. Cannes means killing Sharon. Sharon and I turned around and it's this guy and he's pushing this African American woman who's in her 50s, in a wheelchair. So you know, I step aside, she goes by, and then the dude behind me goes, he said, he goes, I got to say that exactly what he said. He goes, they should have to wait in line like everybody else. That's what he said. He went with they, he went with they, so they they a day meaning people in wheelchairs or black people flag I

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       think. No, I think he met wheelchairs because those other black people, um, uh, standing in line. Right. So, so I turn around.

Speaker 2:          00:41:43       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:41:44       And I, I don't talk to fucking people want it and he just, it was just so crazy. I just try, I said, come on man. I mean, she's in a wheelchair. I go, would you rather be standing up and sitting in that chair? And then there was a pause and he goes, they should wait in line like everybody else, like his whole Mississippi burning vibe and we know it's killing me. I came up, I came, I came up with the fucking line that I should have said after I got on the plane, what I should have said, ah, what the fuck was it? And I already forget. What did I got to have the proper word. My brain is just not working today. Um Oh that's, I'm like, oh, now you believe in quality. It's not a quality. What does the word now you believe in a,

Speaker 2:          00:42:29       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:42:29       Oh Jesus, I just blew it. No, I'm completely, no, I'm completely fucking out of it. What the fuck is, cause he's basically, you know, this guy, he doesn't want shit to be equal. But now that she's going by him, now he wants to shit to be equal. But you know, if she went to live in his fucking neighborhood, he wouldn't want it to be. So he wants to quality. Oh, that was on sale. Now you believe in equality. That's what I was going to say. Yeah. Jesus. Okay. You just looked up and you get what I'm saying. It's always a great joke when you have to overly explain it to someone who's known you for fucking years. Ah, Jesus. All right, so she see how that just bombed everybody? Maybe a pip. It's a good thing. I didn't say it. Um, that's basically what my second set had giggles was like, oh, I didn't tell you that. And yeah, I fucking ate my balls. No, I did wired to I, there was one woman's was so disgusted she wouldn't look at me and I just kept saying, I'm not going to tell another joke to you. Look at me. And she, she wouldn't look and I kept going, I'm not going to tell another joke. She looked at me and she just goes, yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:43:39       And continued to look down at the floor and she was like, you know, 65 70. Well that's not exactly your demographic. They were, they were, they were a church group trying to raise money and nobody told me I need. So, yeah, that's, that was my out. That's my app. That's the story I'm telling. So anyways, so he was my morning. All right. So I get a car service to pick me up at lax when I go to land. Now the whole fucking purpose of a car service, when you get off the plane, the fucking jerk office standing there. So you just leave, you want to leave, you paying a ridiculous amount of money, not for the ride. You paying the money to leave to leave the cluster. Fuck that is lax. So I go down there and there's 10 people standing there with names and I'm all excited is my name.

Speaker 1:          00:44:28       We had a name. Did I get picked right? Am I going to make varsity? You know, and of course my name is and fucking there Jarman entitled Jack Ass at this point. So I'm like, you know what? Fuck that. I just walk out and I go right to the cab line. There's no line. There's also no caps, but I see a cab common and the fucking guy pulls up and then right then I get the text about the guy and he's like, you know, trying to explain to me that he's in the parking lot and he's on his way, but his English is as good as my French. So it takes a second. So I walk away from the cab, then I'm standing in a modern gun. He's fucking Goddamn sons of bitches. You know what the fuck I want to get out of here. I want to go home.

Speaker 1:          00:45:11       I got to record the podcast and being a big baby basically. Right. And then all of a sudden, two seconds later, the fucking town car pulls up. He looks at me, I look at him, I nod, he nods and I fucking get in the car. And I'm like, all right, I see. Once again, Bill, you lost your shit for no reason that it didn't take long at all. So we're driving away with driving away and I'm in a great fucking mood. I get out of lax, I'm feeling great. And then all of a sudden his phone fucking rings and he's like, hello, what? Oh my God, I'm so sorry. And he goes, I picked up the wrong passenger. So I'm thinking like, well, you know, top too bad for that other guy. So the guy slows down and he goes, we have to go back until we were like 10 minutes away from the airport, right?

Speaker 1:          00:45:55       I'm like, we're not going back. We can't go back. And he goes, no. He goes, we have to go back. I got to go back and get him. You're in the wrong car. And I'm like, well that's not my fault. You picked me up. Right. And then he's literally started to turn around. I feel like some little kid, I want to go ahead and type stores. Right? And he's taking me to go see the dentist. So I'm like, dude, you can't just drive me back. He can't do that. And he didn't get, he starts going, you know, stop yelling at me and I'm like, I'm not yelling at you. Like he thought this was yelling. That's not yelling, is it? Well, you know what, you guys need to up your yelling gang cause that's not fucking yelling. So

Speaker 1:          00:46:35       Aye, he apologizes. The other guy doesn't fucking apologize to me. And he goes, I had to sign any shows. A sign was like fucking guy's last name. It was like Rancho Cucamonga, this really fucking long name. And I'm like, I didn't even fucking show me that. He goes, yes I did. I go, dude, you're literally telling me I don't know what my name is. And he's like, stop yelling at me. I go, I'm not yelling. And you're sitting next acting like I don't know what my fucking name is. I didn't curse though. So then I finally just go, you know what, just pull over, let me out here. So he pulls over and like support that leaves me off and he's just sitting there in the fucking driver's seat.

Speaker 2:          00:47:11       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:47:12       As I, as I go to get out, pops the trunk and it's just sitting there. So I leave the passenger side door open and the trunk open and I walk out like a total fit. Such a chick fucking move. Like, that's not a man move. Um, but I did that and I went, I got my done.

Speaker 5:          00:47:30       Um, it is, dude, that's that. That's a pussy. Move it as a footsie move, but there you go. Who has a pussy check. Thank you. You know the whole thing about that scenario is his, like his job is to say, are you Mister Rancho Cucamonga? Yes, I am. Are Your any we're going to this place. Right. That's normally what they're supposed to do. They've made sure you got the name right. I had my headphones on. Okay. I took my 50% of it all right. Yeah, because the guy, the driver who have the actual person who I was at least 50% of my fault [inaudible] was 50% of year fall because there was a guy inside holding a sign with your name on it. No, there wasn't. Not at the time. But then he called you or whatever and he was like, I'm coming around and this and that.

Speaker 5:          00:48:17       Either wet or hear what you just said there. What you just said. What you said, there was a guy in there holding a sign with my name on it. I said no, there wasn't. And you said not at the time. Well, they called me. It was the thing. Well, I call. Okay. So if the fire department shows up the day before the fucking house is on fire and sprays water on it, like it's, this isn't his job. They supposed to have a little bit of timing. That's why he is. He's supposed to have time and he should have been there. You should have seen him right away. That's the whole point of it. And at other jackass should have confirmed that you were Mister Rancho Cucamonga and you are going to the right place. So I'm staying Rancho Cucamonga. I said in the beginning and I thought I would go with some different like Walla Walla Walla are chubby chase.

Speaker 5:          00:48:56       Uh, I'm joking, but the the, so now he should have checked. He fucked up. Can I say you got all I fucked up the way you fish kid and kid, I fucked up. I'm a dick. He probably told the story to the next passenger and they both laughed and the next passenger was easy going and fucking was, was a better person than I wasn't. Gave him a nice, but he messed up. He hit, he was supposed to check to make sure. And you've never met the person before you doubled. Sort of assumed I was that dumb. That's basically it. I should have closed the door in the trunk. I'm a content. Has a bit of a bitch move. Totally. Well there you go. So you agree with me? No I but bitch meaning like busy but not a female necessary.

Speaker 5:          00:49:41       Well it's not fair. It's not fair to plunk move. Maybe this, no. Anna pitch 50 like having a fit or throwing a tantrum like a baby ish move. Oh definitely mature. Immature. All about it. We'll go in immature. It was an immature move of you to be like, well why I'm not closing the door or the trunk. Take that. You're both being like unnecessary because he should have been like, you know what sir? You're absolutely right. I should have double checked with you. I'm so sorry. I got 20 bucks on me. Can I at least give you $20 for the next doll? He doesn't do all of that. Look at this and this. I think this is why it's called a chick move. A pussy move. A bitch move is because guys are progressive. We cause you guys don't fight for the most part. You guys don't solve shit physically. So you guys, you solve

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       it that way cause you're, you're more evolved as a man. You're supposed to flake. I was literally supposed to, supposed to take off my fucking headphones and we were supposed to Duke it out right there on the sidewalk and whoever won that was the direction the car was going to go in. Every Clint Eastwood movie I ever watched. That's how it was supposed to be done. And I did all right.

Speaker 5:          00:50:49       I was like tootsie. That's what the movie was like. So, but you still understand that he did have to go back to get the person who actually paid for his car. He, he screwed up. But he has to go back and get the person that paid for the car.

Speaker 2:          00:51:03       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:51:04       He can't call another car. Well, I don't know what their whole situation is. He, I don't think you know anything about the situation because you don't work in that industry. Well, I just know that, isn't it enough that I just said I was 100% wrong and that I was a bitch and I threw a tantrum and he just gonna fucking countersink it and fucking hell no spackle over it. I got it. I'm fine. I know you had a hard morning. I'm not going to

Speaker 1:          00:51:25       come in here the whole weekend. Yeah. I swear to God like I was a fucking idiot this weekend. I got on, I returned a rental car at Logan Airport and I miss my fucking missed my terminal because I assumed that something in Boston with the sign was going to make sense, which it never does. This is the deal. I'm, I'm waiting to go to terminal e southwest airlines. Right. So they go, the first one, there's two buses. One goes to BNC, one goes to DNA, so I don't fuck that up. I actually get on the right bus. They go to the first one. They're like terminal dean, fuck in whatever. United Airlines the south like, well that's not a day. I know it's not d. And I was, I was tweeting once again being a fucking idiot. So while you were driving, not while I was writing, but here's the thing in between Charles, that was terrible. So we get to the next terminal. Okay, I'm in a bus. I couldn't see what the letter was and it says, uh, it says next to, you know, next term when he starts, all I hear is that the airlines, Japanese, their Iraqi air, Turkish air, United, Arab Emirates. I'm like, all right, international terminal, blah blah, blah, blah, blah. And then all of a sudden we're going back to the, where the fuck I was going to go. Well, what happened term leader? The guy goes, I want it to terminally southwest

Speaker 5:          00:52:44       the International. Does that make any fucking sense? Japanese air, Turkish air, Iraqi air, south west, then somebody by southwest. So didn't a bigger airline by southwest. Is that have anything to do with it? I thought I heard that. I thought southwest got bought by some bigger airline. What are you hanging out with? Pilots? No, fuck. Do you know that? I don't know cause I read things. I Dunno. I am. I really could have sworn at that happen.

Speaker 2:          00:53:11       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:53:11       You know what's funny about you? You don't want to get a fuck anyway. Wanted to bring this up. How you don't want to get a TV in the bedroom because you said it affects the connection between the two people. I'm keeping it clean here and meanwhile, every fucking night, you know, you're,

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       you're on your laptop. So what's the point? Why can't I watch the, the end of a game laying there in bed, rubbing my bulls, watching a game. There's another, there's nowhere in here to hang a television. Well, they used to have these things back in the day called TV stance. And when you bought a TV that no, that's not gonna be a TV stand in here. No, I don't at all. That's hilarious. I thought I had 50% of this room. Can I be on my side of the room then? Um, no. I literally blocked the door to my closet with a TV. If I could just do it. Do you want to like it right there and have the door closed so we can like see it on an angle? I mean, that could work. That's not a crazy idea. It's not a crazy idea. It's one of the best ideas you've ever had.

Speaker 3:          00:54:08       Thank you. I'll get rid of that closet door. You're not, you're not going to get rid of the closet. I'll fucking open that. God. Let's be, let's close the door. Let's be serious here. I'll play another man who knows how to fix things. To open that wall up there. My entire closet into a fucking TV. That whole walls a TB. Most people make it in an aquarium, right? Like obsessed with lying down while watching TV. Tired. Fucking tired. My brain doesn't work anymore. I've traveled more and the last fucking year and a half and I'm old now. Okay. I'm fucking old. I forgot. I lost another pair of sunglasses.

Speaker 5:          00:54:44       I left my car charger. I just drop off. Rent a car. I just get out of the car. Yeah, I mean I shouldn't. I should be wearing those hospital loafers carrying an ivy, but that should be like I told you too that all of would tag is a phone call and they were like, no, we don't see it then fine, you move on. But if they're like, actually yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:55:07       I just went out to the glove compartment and there they were working on, I left my sunglasses in a Vegan restaurant in the dude stole them. Okay. It's still sad about that, huh? There's something about a Vegan restaurant.

Speaker 5:          00:55:19       Why You keep tying veganism to like your, your a to, you know, they're like, what? Sufferable people out there. No offense vegans, but you know you guys can be too much.

Speaker 3:          00:55:32       Oh Shit. I said, hey, you know what people wanted me to talk about Jay z and Salon Juror. Oh, the elevator fail. Whatever the hell are fucking name. That's a name. I'm sick of Jay z wearing that. Roger Moore Tuxedo. We get it. You're fucking cool enough already. Tom Ford. Oh, is that what that is? I always feel at this point, Jay z so famous, you forget he's from Brooklyn and he fucking grew up in a street corner. Can still beat the shit out of you. Although him with his shirt off, you know, I don't know.

Speaker 5:          00:56:05       He's definitely a businessman either. Yeah, exactly. He's fine dining, eating like steak and wine and like [inaudible] I can tell you this. I need to do all, he's got the gift of Gab lab.

Speaker 3:          00:56:20       He doesn't need to do all of it. Doesn't, it doesn't, you know, I've, I've, I've had

Speaker 5:          00:56:24       enough arguments with people. God bless him and his Roger Moore Tuxedo. Did you talk about the elevator fight? Have you Kinda I, I, I, I'll talk about it. Oh, I'll talk about it. Write down. I thought Jay z regardless of whatever the fuck he said that set her off showed unbelievable restraint. Okay. Getting kicked by a woman in high heel shoes. I've been there. Okay. That five fucking hurts. And he kept taking it to the hands and there was a moment at one, I only watched it once. There was a time, like one of the last times she hit him, she even flinched cause she was like, yeah at this point he decided to deserve to get punched in the face. You see her flinch, she spit at him. That was what was really awful. That's what I forgot to do to that driver this morning. That would have been like Browning bitch move nine.

Speaker 5:          00:57:20       Never do that. But you know their family has problems like anybody else's family. I feel like if anything it just, you know, it just goes to show you that you shouldn't feel bad when you know your uncles or whatever started screaming at each other over thanksgiving. That is funny though, when you really think about how many people are at tour judging them. Actually this footage that exists somewhere of their family fighting in an elevator, it's just they're not famous and nobody cares. So it's, it just gets taped over. I feel like a lot of, there are a lot more like physical fights that happen in families between siblings and stuff that most people wouldn't want to admit. You know? So it's, I, it's, I really don't think it's that big of a deal. I was watching it like salons stop. No, definitely said something fucked up because you definitely has Beyonce did do anything. She, she was, she was staying with her sister. She was probably like, wow, that's what happens when you say x, Y and z. That was her vibe.

Speaker 5:          00:58:20       Uh, yeah. So, but I, I, it's not that big of a deal. I don't feel like, you know, well that's kind of a big no, that's a tough, that's, that's, it's over. Their relationship is fucking over. And if money wasn't involved, whose relationship? Jay Z's and uh, the fucking large, yeah, those sidekick there. She's not, yeah, she is. Come on Frank. Frank Stallone. No, no. She has a really good album. I love her music and she has great style. No, she thoughts me miss as Beyonce obviously and all these dumb ass Internet people on Twitter are like, I've never even heard words. Who knows? You should be thankful she got any car. This is my nice theory because you don't know music beyond what's on your top 40 radio station. And they play in the morning while you're going to work doesn't mean that this person isn't talented.

Speaker 5:          00:59:10       No, I just get annoyed with that is first of vegans down the music lovers, this is the deal. The only way she can make it as if she's in the same group is Beyonce because that's the way it fucking works. There's no way. Never in the history of two people in the same family trying to be a solo artists. Have they ever made it? They always, you got to be together. The Everly brothers, the Jackson five, the Osmonds and then what happens is somebody breaks out of it and then the rest of them go back to the dinner table going, I have an album out to whenever. He's like, yeah, we don't care. I know I'm your mother. I don't care. Michael is special. Donny and Marie are the best. They're younger than you. They're cuter than you and Jesus likes them better and that's what happens and you're fucked.

Speaker 5:          01:00:04       So the only move she had was when Beyonce was on the way up. She should have been in Destiny's child. Look at me. Look at me on the other side of the fence, just calling off groups here. Wow. Was she in that group? She was like, I thought it was Kim Coles and a that chick from Cole from uh, uh, the one in the roller skates today wasn't she had that name and black people now. Yeah. Um, now she was like a backup dancer. She went on tour with them when she was younger. She had an album when she was younger. She got pregnant. She, Matt Cutts. They're like, I was in Oklahoma as a backup dancer. I was, remember that ACDC, that ACDC video who made, who when I had all the Angus is up there. I was, well, I was one of the Angus six.

Speaker 5:          01:00:50       She, I know she also, I didn't really, I didn't know. I wish I did. She also wrote quite a few of Beyonce songs and I co wrote some of destiny shots on it. So you know, she's, she's got other talents, things, you know. Yeah. She's seven. She's like that. She's like that chick and I say, hey, now go in. And her name is Linda. No, it is it is it called Jessica. So you know I'm right. I don't know what her name is. Four non blondes. Yeah. Lead or Linda Perry recently married to Sarah Gilbert from Roseanne. Did you know that you could play Darlene? They're, they're married. The last time I saw Linda Perry, not the last time, like I see her, but I saw her blonde chick. Isn't she like fuck she's gotta be my age probably. What's she going around with that little girl for what he's talking about? Sarah Gilbert is older than I and I saw the show the other day. She's like 12th that's cause she looks great. Like I was watching the fucking TV show just bombing all over the place. But now I saw Linda Perry at the rest of the Vegan restaurant in question. Oh yeah. I hope she didn't leave her fucking sunglasses or a top hat. I did not. You like her Linda Perry. Oh, because I had a problem with white people with dreadlocks. Dammit. Fucking snuffed that right out.

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       You're too smart for your own fucking yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:02:21       Good. She doesn't have them anymore. Yeah. But she had a young writer, Nia doesn't like white people with dreads where it's like she doesn't like wet weds. I just feel like, I don't know, tread lugs are a very particular cult. I don't know. Maybe they don't, that style doesn't belong to anyone anymore. You considered it an off shoot of blackface? I, no, I think it's like, you know, white people that don't want to do their hair and like think they're super, um, like tapped into like roster reggae music and like what if they really fat? Really?

Speaker 5:          01:03:07       What if they really, really, really love weed that, yeah, that doesn't mean anything. That, and they actually normally do really, really, really love weed with the goddamn hemp necklaces and whatnot. So it's another commitment to the lifestyle. That's not all Rastafarianism is though. It's a religion. No, it isn't. Yes it is. Google it not in this country. Well, it's one of their holidays. And how can we don't get the day off because it's not, it's not an American thing. You said it's not, not in this country. It's actually, no, I was joking. I was just being an idiot. But no, it's not an like an American or whatever religion. No, it isn't. No, but this aren't there enough rosters over here that they could start complaining and we could get another day off. Y'All mine, I've come. The Jews got all that days off. Sorry.

Speaker 1:          01:03:58       Worst fucking Jamaican accent ever. Is that what Rastafarian's come from? I Dunno. All I know is I wouldn't fuck with any of them. I don't believe in magic. Do you believe in magic? But I do with fucking those people. I wouldn't fuck with them.

Speaker 5:          01:04:16       I saw nothing. Magic. I've watched stuff voodoo. Yeah, cause that's not the same place. It's all Raiders of the lost ark to me the same thing at all. Listen, they stay still. They still use to you, aren't they? Yeah, I went there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's threatening.

Speaker 5:          01:08:16       that she was painted women were fucking ugly back in the day. Oh, stop it. And the guys were, everybody was shaped like a refrigerator.

Those were the people who had gray bodies. But the aristocrats, yeah, there's just kind of, you know, they're turning into mush as you like to say. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:09:02       Okay,

Speaker 5:          01:09:02       well we should have painted the poor people because the fucking bad ass is in the castle. They were a mess. No wonder they wore robes. You know, everybody else was walking around with a fucking leaf over their junk. All right, I'm asking you this. If you could have one woman from all of history be absolutely in love with Billy twinkle toes. Oh, it's this for you. Who would it be? No, it's for you. Oh, they're writing. It's him. Okay.

It just looked like a bunch of clothes and uh, which is true. I'm definitely pasty, but here's a little tip for you.

Speaker 1:          01:12:06       People out there want to take a picture during the show. Why don't you use a fucking camera? You know, I love, I was always me and my pigments. Faults rather than you and your phone. You're taking a picture with a phone. It's a phone. It's a cam quarter. It's a texting device. It's something you can watch porno on. Oh, when it's also a camera trying to do too many things. It's wearing too many hats. You bring a fucking camera in there. It can capture me and all my lack of pigment. Alright, so quit blaming me. It's your fucking phone. All right. Big plans for this summer. I know you live out there and the perfect climate. No, I don't. I don't. It gets hot as hell here in the summertime and it catches on fire. Um, he said for people not soil. He said, that's funny, but what's on tap in the months of June, July and August, do you ever think about getting a jet ski and hunting sharks and the coast? Do you have a pool? What are you excited for or,

Speaker 3:          01:13:05       uh, I am excited to not kill sharks. I think it's disgusting that people do that Shit. And, uh, I think it's disgusting that people swim in the fucking ocean. I think it's, you shouldn't do that shit. That's disgusting. It's reckless. Uh, I don't have a pool. What am I excited for? Uh, um, doing Mike Johnston, another one of his workouts and I'm leading with the left hand, one of his drum exercises. I'm leading with the left hand and it's getting fucking stronger every day. And, uh, I'm having a hell of a time playing drums. I'm decided to ride some motorcycles this summer. I'm excited to take my dog on a hike. I'm excited to not fucking work for a couple of months after I take my special, other than doing the local clubs out here to build up my next hour. Oh. And of course, I'm also doing the, uh, um, doing that, um, benefit on July 14th at the green building in Brooklyn, New York with Jimmy Smith. Um, James Smith, sorry. And um, Jimmy Smith. Jimmy Smits fucking Nytd blue. Um, all right, last thing,

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       girlfriend. Constantly gets hit on. Ah, Jesus Christ. Hey Nia, come in here for this one. The landscapers. Oh, Jesus Christ. All right. The landscaper did that. The landscape for these are the people who actually plant the fucking tomatoes. As you can tell, all I do is tell jokes. I don't fucking know how to do anything else. I can't even drive myself back from the fucking airport. I lose my sunglasses like an old man. I have caretakers at this point, a dear Billy red balls. I've been with my girlfriend for around a year and I've noticed that lots of other men hit on her. I mean a lot. Now this happens almost all this almost never happens when I'm around. Oh, that's respectful, but she tells me at least a few times a week about a creepy stranger who approaches her or cat calls, or I have to say it makes me pretty uncomfortable but proud at the same time. The weird part of all this is that why my girlfriend is Asian. It's only older black men that hit on her.

Speaker 1:          01:15:17       Wow, that's weird. She must have a fucking fat ass or something. No disrespect. Now we're both in college and I just got back from four months studying abroad in France while I was there. She told me about a guy in a parking garage that came up behind her and groped her. I told you she's got a fat ass, a guy who stopped traffic in the middle of downtown Atlanta just to say what's up. And a tutor who flat out asked if she's single and started to insult me without ever having met me. Oh my God. That's fucking awesome. I'm sorry, but that's hilarious. He's hitting on one of his students, finds out he has a boyfriend. Yay. Go. Sounds like a dose.

Speaker 2:          01:16:01       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:16:02       How soon before that guy gets fired? Um, anyways, the cashiers at Starbucks drop comments too. When she says they always stare at my chest.

Speaker 2:          01:16:11       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:16:11       Is she trying to make me jealous? MMM. Well, have you conveyed to her how that makes you feel? You know, just say not for nothing. You are gorgeous. I understand why people look at you. I mean, I looked at you, I didn't look at you like a creep.

Speaker 2:          01:16:28       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:16:28       You know, I just thought you was stunningly beautiful and I had to talk to you and now here we are in this relationship. But uh, I dunno. I Dunno why she's doing that. Do you not tell her she's beautiful all the time? Are you not giving her something that she needs? So she's saying, look at all these other people who want me or is she just out of her fucking mind? I don't know. Let's keep reading now for the summer. She's also in a study. She's also in a study abroad program, but in Barcelona.

Speaker 2:          01:16:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:16:57       Jesus Christ.

Speaker 2:          01:16:59       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:17:00       Who is this right now? Oh, and even fucking, is this like a, you guys are live in a hell of a life here. While they were out in a little group exploring the city, one guy with her tried

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       to hold her hand and tried to play it off is just a joke. Uh, Jesus, I can't get mad at that. We've all had a big swing and a miss. What are you doing? Oh No, no, I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. Um, anyways, I don't know why she tells me about these things, but she knows, oh, she knows. It makes you feel uncomfortable. If I was ever there with her, I doubt this would ever happen. But we're unfortunately long distance until July. I'm kind of worried because she's under 21 but now she's in Europe, she's able to drink and I'm scared someone's going to try and take advantage of her and there's nothing I can do. Am I crazy for having this bothered me so much? I don't know what I can do to stop it or even if, or even if it would stop when I'm with her, how do I keep them away?

Speaker 2:          01:17:57       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:17:58       Let me ask you a question, sir. Do you love this woman? You know, is this the woman that you think you're going to be with? If you have a definite answer, yes. Then you need to talk to her about this. Okay. And just say, listen, you're a beautiful woman and I'm just going to have to accept the fact that when I'm not around, guys are going to ask you out the same way I did. Okay. But for my own sanity, I would really appreciate it if he didn't tell me about it. Okay. Unless obviously somebody gropes you, then I want to fucking find the guy and kill him. Um, if your answer is no, um, you are studying abroad in France. I just came back from there. The most beautiful women I've ever seen in my life per capita are over there. You're going to be foreign. You're going to have a fucking sexy accent to them. Cut Your fucking losses. Go down and buy some fucking condoms and have at it all right.

Speaker 3:          01:18:59       That's, that's my suggestion. I hope I didn't go too quickly with that. But uh, how do you keep them away? You can't keep him away and when you date a beautiful warm, when you're just, you have to accept on some level that guys are going to hit on him. Ken on him hit her on her and you can't get mad at that. That beautiful. You did the same fucking thing. You can't tell me before you didn't get to know her as a person. If you really do love her, that when you looked at her, you didn't shoot, went gat. Hey, you did something. You didn't say something like that. So, um,

Speaker 3:          01:19:30       yeah, you know, I don't know what to tell you. You're going to have, you're going to have to find a middle ground. If you're going to stay with this woman, you either have to fuck in a, yeah, you've got to convey that it's bugging you and then make peace with the fact that it's still going to fucking happen on some level. All right? But, uh, she's really young and you must be really young too, and you're both going to countries where they fuck because you know, that's what's to do over there. I'm such an idiot, but I'm just saying, you know, what are you going to do Bob? It was awful. Sorry, I just got off a fucking plane. I tried. I tried. Um, that's my advice. If you know what, I'm jet lagged here. If I fucking, somebody has some better advice, just write it into the, a bill@themmpodcast.com. And, uh, I'll try and maybe do a better job next week. That's the podcast for this week. Sorry. No, I got the hiccups. That's it. Everybody got fuck yourself. Have a wonderful, a wonderful week. And I'm going to go watch the fucking ranges. Play the Canadian say it.
