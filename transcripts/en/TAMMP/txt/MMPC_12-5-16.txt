Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn his time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday, December 5th, 2016 what's going on our why? Yeah. Um, you doing your holiday shopping? Is that what you're doing? Oh my God. What do I get this person? And it's just not enough time. Slide of bullet. By the way. Slight Ebola is still left. Um, yeah. You, you guys are in the same boat as me. Um, you know, I handled some of the shit I needed to handle. Uh, you know, I got to fucking nieces and nephews and all this shit I got to take care of, so I don't know what to do. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to go on bill bird.com. Click on the podcast page and click on the Amazon link and go straight to Amazon and kicked me a little doe. Rape. Huh?

Speaker 1:          00:00:48       Oh No. Bill, you shouldn't have. Hey, don't worry about it. I made a little bit of fucking cash. She, Sean, this one. Oh, enjoy your remote control lab. Rookie. Um, anyways, uh, so I know the podcast is late. I was going to try to do it last night, but, uh, unfortunately I had to go to a memorial service for my friend who died. And, uh, it was a beautiful, beautiful ceremony. And also one of the saddest things I've ever seen with these young kids and everything. And, uh, didn't feel too funny last night, but, um, I learned a lot, man. I learned a lot by going to that service. I will tell you that because when they did the collage of his life in the end of it, um, the, the photos and the videos and everything, like 99% of it was about him with his wife and being a dad.

Speaker 1:          00:01:40       So it made me feel lucky that I'm going to become a father. Definitely. Because, uh, I was thinking like, well, what if I died right now? What would the collage looked like for me? And it would just be a picture of me and a bunch of different comedy clubs making weird faces. Um, obviously the lovely dia, but you know what I mean? I was kind of like a what me playing drums. Like, what the fuck did I do to keep, you know, not to say that you have to have a fucking kid. Cause definitely I think if you don't have a kid at this point, if you don't want to, that's a great fucking thing considering all the shit going on with the environment to not just have another person, just to have a person. But um, you know, like with all of these things, the great thing was I got to see a bunch of comics that I had not seen in awhile and uh, I will be seeing a bunch more this Tuesday night at the laugh factory.

Speaker 1:          00:02:30       I believe the event is sold out. So thank you to everybody that came down and bought tickets. I A or however the fuck you kids do it nowadays. I really appreciate it. It's going to be a, the money's going to be going to a is a twin boys. But um, anyway, so yeah, so I went, that was a very, very heavy emotional nights. So I did not feel remotely funny cause that was the thing. Oh typical fucking psycho comic. I'm going to go to a memorial service for friend of mine that I've known for almost 25 years and then I'll come home. Then I'll do my podcast after that. If you think some of my shit is bleak and dark. Um, yeah, I, I'm glad I did not record last night, so I had some shit to do this morning. I'm a little bit late. Um, we're editing the season two of f is for family and all that shit.

Speaker 1:          00:03:15       Have I made you laugh yet? All I'm doing is telling you what an Arab laid in my bed and I fucked it. Blah, blah, blah. You know, fully clothed by the way, fully clothed this episode. Um, the NC 17, Thursday afternoon, just before Friday, Monday morning podcast did not do well in the ratings as far as the feedback. You know, it was something that we hear it. Monday morning podcast industries decided was, you know, maybe a different flavor. We could throw the podcast every once in a while I could just be wearing a robe with nothing underneath it that Nia could then comment on. And, um, you know, it was like new coke. That's what all it would say.

Speaker 1:          00:03:55       I'm kidding actually with some of the funniest fucking photoshops. I don't know if you guys saw them on Twitter. Uh, this Sharon Stone was fucking f that was, I don't know how you taught that one. That was great. So anyways, let's, let's talk about life. Talk about the world. Let's talk about uh, hey, congratulations to everybody up there and the Dakotas that was fighting against the pipeline. Evidently they've been able at least able to stop it for now. You know. Good Lord. Some of the shit that they would say in those corporations with doin man, they were playing for keeps. They were saying at nighttime they had drones and they would come in and they had this pepper spray water mixture. They was spraying it, the protesters. Um, that whole thing is so fucked up cause I was just like, why can't they just go down to home depot and buy some of those fucking things that makes the pipe make a 90 degree turn, go up the street a little bit and go around the shit.

Speaker 1:          00:04:50       Um, evidently all the white towns, the cowboy side, I guess they tried to go through other people's towns and they were like, yeah, you're not running that shit through here. So even the white people didn't want it. I Dunno. I guess what I'm saying is I should have bought a Tesla, um, until they do the research and what those fucking batteries do once they finally take those out. You know, I remember Michael Jordan telling me not to throw out my batteries, you know, I believe he was standing next to the children. That's so together. Sneakers, there's so much, you know, you can never, you can never not get mud on your shoes no matter what you do. Like, how the fuck do you just like, no matter what you're doing, I do this and I'm not hurting anybody or the planet. Just the mere fact that you're fucking here, you know, somebody is crying in a factory somewhere, right?

Speaker 1:          00:05:40       Or the inverse, if you're the kid or the person working in the sweatshop, right? You gotta be doing something, you probably taken it home with you, you know, coming home, screaming at your wife. That's my part of the concrete flat asleep on right. There's something. Who the fuck knows? Dunno. Maybe I'm just an arrogant kind in a first world country. I have no idea. But let's talk about Formula One racing here. Everybody. Nico Rosberg do diffs level of fucking drama. Like ladies, if you ever wanted to get into a sport, but you just find, you know, the four major ones in the u s boring or you're not into soccer or whatever the fuck people watch around the world. Cricket, you like drama. You like all of that shit. I highly suggest watching formula one racing this whole Nico Rosberg Lewis Hamilton thing. Nico Rosberg, right? He's the, he's the upstart guys.

Speaker 1:          00:06:33       I said he finally won his first championship after being a bridesmaid the last couple of years. This is my first year watching it. So I'm sure a lot of this shit I'll have wrong. Um, he wins his first championship. All right? And then out of fucking nowhere out of the fucking blue, he retired. He just said, that's it. I'm done. And somebody tweeted that to me. So I looked it up and I saw that it was true and the only clip I saw was him just standing there and his wife was talking the entire fucking time. So I'm just sitting there looking and going like, wait a minute, is this guy, was this her decision? You know, he's got a kid on the way, just like, God, I Need God. You really have to drive again this weekend where I, it's, it's just so silly. I mean, you know, I drive a car to, you know, I don't have to put a number on it and drive around s turns.

Speaker 1:          00:07:33       I just, it's just such a male testosterone thing. You're hurting the environment. I don't know if he got an a rear, like the whole fucking Yoko thing, which people always says Yoko broke up the Beatles, which I, I don't, I don't believe that. I think John and Paul kept bringing their work home, bitching about one another. And after awhile, both Linda and Yoko were like, Hey, well why don't you just quit? I mean, you're not happy. Right? And then they just threw that out there and then the, their ego, you know, like they were calling their bluff. They couldn't be like, what, but here, what would I do? I work.

Speaker 1:          00:08:10       I didn't know if I could write without him. Right. So they just, the, they couldn't do that. So they just fucking, I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. Let's get back to the, let's get back to the race in here. So I didn't know if it was that version and then I read that. What's his face? That was a Kiki Lotto or whatever he was trashing. Nico Rosberg said he made them look silly and stupid and all of that. And I'm just sitting there, why the fuck would this guy quit 31 years old. You just won your first one, now you're going to walk away. You know what? Why would you do that? And then I was thinking maybe it's his wife, he's got a kid coming along. He just wanted, he was very emotional. He had the come down afterwards within this, the little bit of a melancholy slash depression. And then he like, fuck, now I've got to do this again. And you've got to climb back up the mountain again. I don't think it's, you know what I take? It is, I think that, um,

Speaker 1:          00:09:10       Lewis Hamilton was the favorite son. This is not just total fucking guests at Mercedes. He's sick of dealing with that dynamic, you know, and he wanted to get out of his fucking contract and the only way out was to retire. So he might leave for, I don't know how long, you know, and then he'll come back with a different team. There's no fucking way. He's not coming back 31 years old. There's no fucking way he's not coming back. He's going to take a year off, get his kid up and running, you know, get the kid to be able to use the fucking shit. Right. Mama Dada throttled break. Right. You get it. Say a few fucking words and then he's going to be right back out there again. You know, I think he's going to be out there and he's going to race for a different team. But here's the thing though.

Speaker 2:          00:09:59       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:09:59       Does Mercedes cars were so fucking good that all they had to do was just get to the first turn. We haven't won the first turn right one, the God damn race it seemed so, I'm going to guess, I'm going to guess he's going to go with the red bull team because that was the only a team that seemed to fucking win anything this year as far as the shit that I watched. But uh, Jesus Christ. So Nico's get fucking trashed people like what the fuck? Five reasons why you would quit. Um, Kiki Rosberg calls him a contra something leak. A Niki Lauda. Sorry Kiki Nikki Colada. I'm like combining the names here. Slams Nico Rosberg for making Mercedes look dumb dude. In that last race with Lewis Hamilton slowed down because if Nico Rosberg came in fourth place or worse, Lewis would have won the championship. So he deliberately slow the fuck down to let the third and fourth place guys catch up and um, and then he disobeyed a direct order from his fucking pit crew. This is, I'm telling you, it's fucking top gun.

Speaker 2:          00:11:02       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:11:02       You know, you do. Characters are going to top gun, right? They tell them to speed up and Louis is like, Nah, yeah, I'm good. I can still win this race. Let's just fucking ad 40 years of stress to this fucking guy. Maybe he'll, he'll spin out now when, and um, Rosberg's also talked about sometimes you know when they're out on the track, he doesn't know how far Lewis is going to go. He's going to push me off the track, but Rosberg's done the same shit. He did that like twice. He has this fucking move where he goes into a turn and it's like, it goes straight for way too long and then oops at the last second turns away and drive some guy into the gravel. Oh Jesus. You don't know anything about this sport too. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:11:41       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:42       I Dunno. We'll see what the fuck happens, but that's my call I think isn't stay home for a year with this kid. Right. He's going to go out of his fucking mind. As much as he's going to love his kid much. He's going to love wife the entire time that Kenny Loggins song is going to be going on in the background. Well, Yay. Well, but did you, did you do fucking stopped itself? Did [inaudible] though

Speaker 3:          00:12:07       YG being, I mean Bernie. Nah.

Speaker 1:          00:12:11       Right. Um, what about John at JFK said and then the guy in the fucking pumps, Eddie said, I am a, I'm an egg or a cookie or something. Yeah, it's going to drive them up the fucking wall and he's going to have to go back out there again and uh, you know, and then I think he's going to drive for the rest of his fucking career. Um, that's my guess. All right, so there you go. There's a whole bunch of shit. How often you hear a bunch of Formula One talk on a fucking American podcast, you know, nothing. I go fuck yourself. Hey, how about that Patriots Rams Game? You know, that's tremendous. If anybody ever had trouble sleeping, that would have been a great game to fucking watch Jesus Christ. I actually did. I actually watched the, you got to watch the game live with me on Facebook was something last second. We decided to try and all things comedy. So thank you for the 1500 people or so that tuned in and watched me a watch the game. I'm sure they'll put together some sort of clips from that.

Speaker 4:          00:13:04       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:13:06       So if you guys like it enough, if it gets enough hits, I might start doing that. I want to do it for boring fucking games cause if the game matters, you're not going to want to listen to me talking. But patriots first rams, that's a good one. Right? And all I do is I just do the first half.

Speaker 4:          00:13:22       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:13:24       So anyways, I might do it with Joe Bark, nick or somebody like that. Maybe with Paul Versey at some point we'll figure it out. So anyway, so I have to go to this memorial service.

Speaker 4:          00:13:34       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:34       Um, last night I was so proud of my friend that, you know, I could really see what a great husband and father he was. So I already knew the suit that I was going to wear because you want to get to my age, you know, it's fucking sucks man. You start losing people and you have your funeral suit. You know, for a lot of people that was, I'm going to a wedding suit and then that big, as you get older that they come. So I'm going to a funeral. Fucking sucks. So you remember last year I got into the best shape of my fucking life and I went to put on the suit that I fucking bought during that time. Jesus Christ, I could barely get the pants down and I couldn't wear a tie to the event cause I couldn't get the shirt closed and all I did, I put on like 15 fucking pounds. It's like how skinny was I? And I was just sitting there screaming at myself in the mirror. My mother, my, uh, I know my mother always told me when I, you know, I, she was always like fucking, I dunno, she was always honest about not being fat fuck kids, which is hilarious to me because he wants a fat fuck for a kid, right? So I'm sitting there screaming at myself in the mirror, right? And uh,

Speaker 4:          00:14:43       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:14:43       my wife is just sitting there fucking laughing her ass off at me. I, we'll go look at you. Look, you're fucking disgusts me. Just, just completely trashing myself. Cause that's how I get myself back into shape. So, um, I remember I mentioned last podcast that I was going to do a half hour cardio every fucking day this month because I'm not putting on the pigs in the blanket. Fucking apple strudel. What's a good Christmas goes? What are you, yeah, what do you, what do people have Chinese food and Jewish people, right? What's this shit that everybody fucking eats this month makes you fat? Fuck all of this stuff. The pies, the cookies, the Christmas party, the bows, all of that shit. You ended up putting on all his fucking weight. Then what happens? Everybody joins a fucking gym. Everybody joins the gym in January. Right? And it's just fucking mobbed.

Speaker 1:          00:15:35       Right? And all you gotta do is just hang in there too about the second week of February and everybody just starts dropping off like the Bataan death march or some shit. Right. It was such a fucked up reference. But I've been watching a lot of world war two shit probably even said it wrong. They said baton, like what your twirl, the Bataan death march. It was a bunch of high school bands that had to walk to the prom that none of them have dates too. Oh Wow. And you know what? I don't, but it's funny, isn't it? Isn't it? Um, anyways, so you know, it's great. Why don't you beat the fucking new person to the gym? Rush on it. You'd do yourself a favor and not go into the new year, 1520, 30, 40, 50 pounds overweight. Let's say you're not that dumb number. What's that first number?

Speaker 1:          00:16:26       Huh? Unless you're in triple digits. I, you know, I don't want to fucking give it to him, but if he, if he got a double digit figure you're trying to lose, let's say you're 20 pounds overweight, why don't you try to get that to down to a one, you know, get that 18 down to a fucking nine. Get that 20 down to a 10 just knock it down. Run some fucking miles off. You fucking know domino, right? C'Mon admitted. Good. Nobody's looking. Nobody's looking at cubicle. Reached down. Reach down. Grab, grab a handful. I look at you. Huh? That's so, that's what you're going to do. You're going to add to that Jesus Christ. Come on. Say it with me. I'm a fat cunt, right? Just say it. One, two, three. I'm a fat cunt. All right?

Speaker 1:          00:17:14       Then the first thing you gotta do is, is, is admitting it to yourself. Once you've lost control over so many of those fucking Christmas cookies. But let's be honest, they don't really taste that good. A lot of them are bad shortbread with some shitty frosting and some sprinkles on it, right? You don't need that shit, right. Half Hour, half hour every day, make a Goddamn playlist. You know what's funny is I've actually, because I'm so dreading doing cardio, rather than listening to some testosterone aggressive shit, like I actually was listening to like Paul Simon, like my cardio thing starts off with something. So right by Paul Simon, which were you really listened to that song? I should look up the fucking knife. My Internet doesn't work down at the fucking lyrics are really annoying. He's like, when something goes wrong, I'm the first to admit it.

Speaker 2:          00:18:07       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:18:07       I'm the first to Ed made it, but the last one to know, Whoa, whoa. Right. So He's already said like, you know, hey, if there's something wrong, like I'm the first one to admit it. I just never know what that is. I don't know if it Yale, fuck you Paul Simon, you can't. I hate when people do that. You know what I mean? They just, they know, they fucking say that they're an asshole and then they take no responsibility for it because, hey man, I, I just don't, I, it's hard for, for me, it's just like hard for me to tell when I'm being a total selfish Dosha. My Paul, you know that. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:18:44       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:18:45       If you could do a fucking sound check. Okay. And you can hear that the horns are too far down in the mix. You can't tell me that you can't be in a car with somebody else and not hear that you're being a fucking asshole, you know? And then the rest of it and when something goes right, oh, it's like you lose me. It's apt to confuse me. Like he's just like, oh, I'll, I'll, let's all stop and help Paul Simon, you know, that's why he married that Ed per cal, I'm telling Ya. You know what I mean? No fucking brought his age was going to put up with his horse shit. He had a good, he find some young chick that was still fucking wide. I, you know, slightly confused.

Speaker 5:          00:19:27       We are right.

Speaker 1:          00:19:28       She didn't know what the fuck she don't know which way was up. All right. God Damn oversized sweater walking, walking around. He fucking shows up. Like, you know, I'm even happy if something goes wrong. I'm the first to admit it. But yeah, I never seem to know. I'm like the last guy to know Paul, you're a nice person. I like see, you know he's behind her just banging away. It's fucking to pay. Slap it off the back of his head. Right. That's how the whole fucking thing went down. And in the meantime, he Brykelle the new Bohemians, right? That you know, for a pop band. I mean those guys could play great guitars. State a great fucking drummer. And what happened? Vocat Paul Simon comes up with his hat and hand showing up. You know Paul Simon got, he got hair plugs right after. I think Elton John. Elton John got the original ones. So like, you know, his head was so scarred up. That's why when he was real coked up in the 80s he was wearing like those mannequin wigs because I didn't know what I'm talking about. I think it was I at the grocery store and read a few too many uhs magazines. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:20:37       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20:38       And it's all, how the fuck that again. Oh, we're talking about working out. Okay. Money had talk about Paul Simon [inaudible] he's fucking relationship I think overstepped a few here, especially during this holiday month. So I apologize. All right. So I start with that. Then I go into one trick pony. Then I go 50 ways to to uh, to leave you alone with Steve Gadd on drums. Um, oh by the way, he's coming to town with the fucking Eric Clapton. Somebody offered me a fucking ticket in, I forgot to get back to him. I got to see, I've seen Steve Gadd lied before, but I never saw Eric Clapton. But anyways, it goes to that and then I go on, I listened to a,

Speaker 1:          00:21:25       what the fuck do I listen to? A couple of pretenders songs. Then I get into Aerosmith's first fucking album and then I'm done. Right. Just like that. I eased my way, ease my way, you know, we start off really easy. Then I get to mid range and then I just get to Aerosmith's first fucking one. That's what I did because what I was doing before I was, I was like regretting, like not regretting, hating doing cardio. And I was starting off with like fucking iron maiden or Dr feel good. Do you know what I mean? Like that's not like if you, if you just waking up and you get not a fucking elliptical

Speaker 3:          00:22:03       tall, he's got the

Speaker 1:          00:22:07       just like Jesus, Vince, Vince for fuck sakes.

Speaker 1:          00:22:13       Well he's got, at least I could start with home sweet home Ryan. He'd know allometry um, you know, I just realized we have company upstairs. Once I put the headphones on it, I don't even fucking realize I don't give a shit. So I was listening to that and like iron maiden, you know, it's just like creeps you out. Like you fucking getting on an elliptical half groggy because I gotta go into work and Shit. Right. Starting your day off. We want information, information, information or why are you the new number two? What was number one? You are number six, right? How about Vincent Price? I'll fucking work. He got in the early eighties, man. He was fucking crushing it, Huh?

Speaker 2:          00:22:53       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:22:55       Whoa. Do you earth and sea for the devil sends the beef was Rad because he knows that a shot let him a lot understanding record the number of the beast. 40 is a human number. It's number is 666. A public [inaudible] right. He get he and then he was on fucking Michael Jackson's thriller. Right. Ah, fucking crazy laugh in the end. I can't remember the funk of 40,000 years. I never really listened to Michael Jackson. Like I was one of those people that have way to like pretend to be sad when he died. You know what I mean?

Speaker 3:          00:23:33       I'm looking at the bed in the mirror, you know, more date.

Speaker 1:          00:23:42       Right. It just never spoke to me. I like shit when he was a kid. Oh baby. Give me more and more chance. I liked right up to off the wall and somewhere. Uh, I dunno. I guess I liked some, I liked some of, uh, like Billie Jean was okay. Thriller I thought was stupid.

Speaker 1:          00:24:06       You know, you know what actually, thrillers in stupid, you know what it is. It's fucking, whenever it comes on, everybody has to start doing the thriller dance. And they always start with the same thing where it's the claws up in the air. I need this side. Always, always, always somebody doing a fucking Michael Jackson impression. You know, you know what's interesting about that guy? As great as he was the Balsam beat to critique this man is like, he was one of those guys, he had the sickest fucking dance moves and then he just stopped and he kept with the loafers and he kept doing the leg thing and he kept grabbing his dick and then everybody kind of caught up and went past him. Even though he was still always the greatest dancer of all time. He, she was, it was like he was doing the Charleston, his whole, his whole fucking life. Bad Gat though. It comes the Moonwalk, right? Somebody can't even remotely fucking debts. Um, oh, the fucking balls I've shown on this podcast. Oh, let's keep going. What other fucking legend can we, can we trashed next? Um, yeah, I never got into a,

Speaker 1:          00:25:13       I never get them. Like when there was, it was always like prince versus Michael Jackson. Like to me it was, it was always print. It wasn't even close. And um,

Speaker 2:          00:36:47       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:36:48       It's fucking unbelievable.

Speaker 2:          00:36:50       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:36:50       It's unbelievable how presidential election goes by. They never talk about any of that shit. Why the fuck do you think that is? Oh, fucking Obama by he was in office when all that Snowden Shit went through the big fucking liberal. All you pussies who cried when Hillary didn't get in. You see what the fuck happened when Obama was in?

Speaker 2:          00:37:09       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:37:10       Bunch of baby stuff. So disappointed. Anyways, let's, let's read some fucking shit here. Here we go. Advice on the future. Dear Bill Murphy, first of all, congrats on the kid. Knew Special Yada Yada. Thank you. I'm an 18 year old guy out of high school and need, need career advice. I graduated with honors. Good for you. Straight A's. Jesus and all that crap. But I currently don't attend college and I'm working some shit job in a pasta factory. Sounds like you're burned out on the academics there. Um, these, oh, he said this is because what I really want to do is sing parentheses classical shit, take piano lessons and be happy. My dream isn't to be famous or anything, but I love music and want to pursue it. Problem is, I have zero background, can't sing, can't play anything. Literally zero. There's a great place nearby where I, I live that gives vocal and piano lessons and all I want to do is start training my voice and start playing.

Speaker 1:          00:38:06       But I feel like there's no point because I have no experience. Jesus Christ. Do you know what it is? You one of these people, you get straight A's, you an overachiever and you're so goddamn smart. Every time you come up with the option. You know when the f the normal level of fear comes up, smarties like you can come up with like rather than just 10 reasons not to do it, you'll come up with a thousand and you're, you're, you're paralyzed right now is what's going on. He said, I spent my free, you're only 18 years old, dude.

Speaker 1:          00:38:37       You know, nobody has any experience so they till they start experiencing it, you're already being way too hard on yourself. He goes, all right. He goes, I spend my free time listening to countless covers of the same song watching videos on vocal exercises and fantasizing about being a singer one day. I feel I can really do it sometimes, but other times I feel like not even trying. Yeah, I do. Yeah. That's a okay. Dead first emotion where you feel like trying to do it. You need to listen to that. That second one that talks you out of it. You need to stop listening to that voice. You need to out loud. Tell that voice to shut the fuck up. That's what I did. I literally would talking to the, you got to beat the fuck out of that voice. That one that goes Nah. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:39:22       Yeah. But when it does happen, you know, nobody's going to like me sit down and shut the fuck up. All right. I don't need you on this one. I need you when I'm thinking about doing heroin then I need you to go in like millennia. If you get it kicked in and you die, you make everybody cry. Yeah, yeah. Then I'll listen to you. But not when you're going after a dream. You don't listen to any of that negative shit cause you'll talk yourself out of it. Um, anyways, I know you always preach about following your dream bone. It actually comes to doing it. It's very scary. Of course it is. However, I don't want to be 40 years old and think, man, what if my 99 year old aunt always tells me to do what I want and forget about money, but my parents say that I need a real job.

Speaker 1:          00:40:02       Well, who has more life experience? You're 99 year old aunt and what is she saying? Huh? Your parents that too close to you, you know they're worried you're going to be homeless and all that shit. So they're always going to say, just get a fucking job so you can have enough money to put a roof over your head and eat a sandwich. That's, that's all they're thinking of. Nobody dreams of that. Nobody dreams about just having a roof over their head and eating a sandwich. Unless you're, I don't know, unless you live in some fucking squalor. Right. But even then after awhile I want you have the roof over your head, then you're going to at some point be like, I want to do something right. I Dunno. Anyways, I've been in between for a year. I've been in between for a year now and need help. I don't want to get massively in debt for something I don't really want.

Speaker 1:          00:40:46       That is so fucking smart. All these poor kids coming out of fucking college, hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt at this fucking point, or at least the high 10 thousands you know, that's what you love being a fucking moron. You know? Cause then you go to community college doesn't cost shit. You work at Dunkin donuts, throw a couple of coffees of people and all of a sudden you've got money for your next semester. Um, maybe pursuing music will open doors to majoring in music in the future. I Dunno. What should I do? You Pale bitch a PS. Give Cleo a head scratch for me. Pimples are awesome. Um, and he says Asian need advice from bill birth. Oh, that's the next person. Is that it? Oh, all right. Yeah. You know, it's fucked up. I was going to say, Oh, you're Asian dude, you're going to crush the piano. It's one of those stereotypes that I guess is, but it's like positive racism. You know what I mean? Don't take up the cello. You'll be playing for you fucking major cities. Philharmonic. All right. This is what I would do.

Speaker 1:          00:41:47       I would just start taking lessons immediately. I would sign up immediately. I would not listen to the rest of this podcast. Hit Stop, walk over to the phone, call the number and get a lesson as soon as you can go to the lesson. Okay. And then keep going and, and just see what that feels like. Don't stop after one. It'd be like, well, we would do one and I can't even play chubs to get, fuck this. Fuck that voice. Keep going. All right. Just say I'm going to stick with this for three months. All right? That's the big thing with, with, with anything. You got to stick with it for three months in really work at it. Working out, learning an instrument, learning a language. God knows I always end up quitting. I can't even get fucking a hundred days together. Um, just stick with it and see how you feel after three months.

Speaker 1:          00:42:38       If you feel like this isn't for me, you're not going to have that. Well, what if, what if? Bullshit because you tried it so this isn't, you're not making a decision that's going to affect the rest of your life. Don't look at it like that. You just looking at the next three months, the next three months are going to happen. Do you want to after 90 days still be sitting there going, I have no experience. I don't know what to do. Working in a pasta place and you want to be in this fucking pasta place and you know how to play a couple of songs, dude, you be fucking excited man. If you, if you actually, if this is what you really want to do, you'll be at work thinking about it. Can't wait to get home and play the fucking piano or or, or try my singing some songs, so whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:43:20       And then once you get that, then that gets in your DNA and when you have stuff to look forward to in life, all of a sudden shit that you don't look forward to, you start looking at it like, why the fuck am I doing this? This sucks, you know, I don't want to do this. And then that gets you out of that and you start going down a path of what the fuck you want to do. Then the other side of that is then your whole fucking life is nothing but fun shit. Then when you actually have to do shit that you don't want to do, like go down to the fucking DMV and find the title for your Goddamn Prius, right then you can be a big fucking baby about it. So there, there, there's always a price to pay. But do, that's what I would do. I would, I would stop listening right now and sign up for those lessons and go in there and just tell your teacher said, this is something I've always wanted to do. I'm just nervous about it. Just fucking just say what you said to me and they'll be like, hi. All right, well let's, let's get you on that dude. You'd be fucking playing piano.

Speaker 1:          00:44:19       That's how easy it is to make a change in your life. Just fucking pick up the phone, say what you want to do and then when it's time you show up and you do it and then you're doing it. You know, you just got to get around all those mental blocks. So, uh, I hope you listen to me man, cause you're only 18 years old, so it's not like you're 50, 60. And even then, I would still tell you to do it because who gives a fuck whether you get anywhere with it. But if you want to do that, you know, you should do it. All right. That's it for that. Okay. Asian needs advice from bill bar. Bill, I love your podcast and your really awesome, um, Asian male, uh, Chinese with squinty fucking eyes and can't drive for shit, dude. You know, kind of shit on yourself.

Speaker 1:          00:45:03       Um, anyways, I need your advice. I came to America, I guess I always do. I'm a fall pasty con. Um, anyways, I need your advice. I came to America a year ago and I really love tall, slim Irish German girls with red hair. Jesus Christ. I just miss, I just Miss B and you're fucking dreamboat. I think they're beautiful. Well, I'm, I told him a blonde is beautiful too. Never seen such beauty where I'm from. Holy Moly. The problem is I'm not like tall and confident like white guys and I live in Texas. Jesus Christ. Dude, this is a fucking reality show waiting to happen. I tried to ask this redhead at the gym out and she won't take me seriously. All right. Time the fuck out dude hat off to you for the fucking balls you got. You came here from China. You've learned the fucking language, right? You're in Texas, you're at the gym, you're talking Shit, right.

Speaker 1:          00:46:01       Gives a fuck. He went up to the plate. He didn't get on base. Who gives a shit? Talk to another redhead, talk to a blonde, talk to whatever the fuck you want to keep talking to him. So what do I need to do to date a redhead now? Jesus Christ or anything? Cause I'm a red head. Like I know like there's some secret fucking handshake. He said they want me to be their agent friend, but I really want to marry him, Bang them and have cute kids. This is driving me nuts. I mean, am I going against nature? Is an Asian guy dating white girls frowned upon and not accepted in America? Thanks in advance. I don't really cuss that much and don't mean to offend you, but uh, wanting to talk and act like you, Jimmy Chow out. Um, yeah. Uh, okay. Is his Asian guys dating?

Speaker 1:          00:46:49       White guys found upon it? Like everything is frowned upon in every fucking country. Generally speaking, people are afraid of anything fucking knew who gives a shit. Literally like that guy before me who said he wanted to play piano, if he told somebody he wanted to do that, you know? Um, I think initially people be encouraging or whatever. They'll always be, there's always gonna be people telling you not to do shit. Is this what you want to do sir? Yes. Then I would go out and do it. All right. So it sounds like to me from your email that you've, uh, you know, I dunno. It's like, it's like you just got into the majors. Okay. It's the first week you haven't gotten your first hit yet. What are you going to do? You're just going to quit baseball. Go back down to the minors. Fuck that. Keep, I would keep talking. Every time you hit on a woman, you get better at it. All right. And I would just, uh, I would just continue, like, you're doing everything you need to do. You go into the gym, you're staying in shape and you're talking shit. I mean, I don't, I don't, I don't see anything wrong with your game plan other than, you know, it hasn't happened for you yet. And um, this is something, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:47:56       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:47:57       You know it's going to take a minute. You know, if you can just walk up and talk to some chickens, a gym, and get laid, I mean, then everybody would be fucking doing it. The reason why most people don't do it is because they know that 99.9% of the time you're going to get the fucking Heisman, aZ , z. This is my elliptical over here. The GGR elliptical over there. Right? Fuck off. Right? And for all the women there going like, can you just like not hit on us at the gym? Can you just fucking, Nah, can I just have this fucking place? Hey, they make gyms for that. They make the all ladies fucking gems. All right, the fuck you going to go? They're working out looking good. And then you're upset that a guy's coming up and hitting on you someday. Ladies some days they're not going to want to talk to you. Take it from somebody. Okay. Who the women, they don't even, they don't even like, you don't even like register.

Speaker 1:          00:48:52       Like I'm, I'm like, I'm a fuck. I'm a sir. I became a sir or mister like fucking 15 years ago and it's all fun. All right. Okay. Boyfriend's obsessed with video games and I know somebody just sent me an email. Who is fucking Nigga talking about some borderline sexual [inaudible]. Obviously that's not what I'm talking about. I'm just talking about a little playful flirtation of someone who wants to fuck you. Boyfriend's obsessed with video games. How far into this podcast am I? All right. This one was going to be a little bit shorter. I usually go a little over an hour, but, uh, that's what I'm going to have to stop today because a, I get to go into fucking why gotta go to work. Um, boyfriend's obsessed with video games, a buffalo bill. I love your podcast and I'm a huge fan. My boyfriend and I love both. Love to listen to your rants about whatever bullshit comes to mind.

Speaker 1:          00:49:44       Uh, I myself have add and can find myself rambling about something completely different than whatever it was I started to ramble about. Anyway. My boyfriend has always been a huge fan of video games and he can play them all day if he could. Uh, more recently he has been obsessed with one game in particular for the last eight plus months and has really put a strain on our relationship. He will turn on is x block from the second he gets home until about four hours before he has worked the next morning. Jesus. So we pretty much spend no time together and let some it unless it's me watching him play with his friends. He talks to his friends while he plays online, in which case even if I do say something to him, he either doesn't hear me or just me. I've tried talking to him about it and he refuses to change or compromise.

Speaker 1:          00:50:32       It's even started to affect our sex life by, I imagine it would because he has no time for sexy time. We were both still young and in our late twenties. And I hate that I'm practically begging him to turn off the game so we can cut noodle in the sheets. I've been contemplating just breaking off our relationship of five plus years because it's been this way for months and it has only gotten worse. I'd love to hear what the y's Nia has to say as well. Thanks for all the good laughs and congratulations on both of use on the new baby birth. Thank you. Um, unfortunately Nias not here. Let me see if I can get her, hold on one sec. Okay. She's on her way down. Um, I would say first of all, you've been together for five plus years.

Speaker 6:          00:51:16       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:51:16       Uh, initially my first thought when you were doing this is what I would do if, if, what would get make me pay attention is I would just start going out with your friends and just start wearing fucking sexy outfits and shit and he'll get the message immediately. If you walk out the door looking good and he's sitting there fucking playing video games and stuff and he, if he doesn't get that hint, then yeah, you gotta be thinking like, what the eff this guy, this guy is more interested in this shit that they, what I'm doing over here with my fucking Christmas leggings going out to a Christmas party dress like a fucking hot piece ash over here. That's, that's what the fuck I would do. You've already tried to talk to him. Um, I gotta be honest with you. I understand people becoming obsessed with video games.

Speaker 1:          00:52:02       It's why I don't play them. But to me this, I, I'm a, I'm a bit of a cut when it comes to video games. To me they'd say child activity, you know what I mean? It's like, what is this person working towards? What do they have for a fucking job that come home from their job and they just play a video game for the whole fucking rest of the day. It does not sound like a driven man. Um, that's another fucking red flag. Um, so that's what I would, I would just start building a life. Initially I would start building a life without him to see if he notices and maybe you guys can get back to where you were or if he doesn't notice, then you already have a head start on getting the fuck away from this guy. So the lovely knee is here. I'm going to hit pause and let her read this email. Um, or I want you, if you just want to, you can just read this while I continue to ramble here. Uh, it starts right here. My boyfriend's been a fan of the video games, Yadda, Yadda, Yadda and all that shit. So that's, that's basically, uh, that's what I was doing. As I mentioned a long time ago, the last video game that I played was grand theft auto three and it literally consumed my life. I would be walking

Speaker 1:          00:53:15       to the comedy clubs, getting on a bus, and I would be thinking about the game when I wasn't even a, I wasn't even at home. I'd be waiting to go on stage thinking about, you know, I'll finish this set and I'll go home and I'll, I'll use the cheats and I'll just go on a fucking rampage and all that shit. And it just kind of took over my life. So here's the lovely Nia with her advice. Oh

Speaker 2:          00:53:37       mmm.

Speaker 7:          00:53:40       First of all, can I just say that this problem really sucks and um, it's really annoying and that you're both in your 20s and he's like addicted to playing video games. I'm sorry, but that's a lame ass and you need to move on. Seriously. Five years, five plus years. It's been this way for a month and it's only gotten worse. Yeah. And you said you tried to talk to him about it and he refuses to change or compromise? Well it's just, yeah. And he obviously has priorities her, this video game. I don't know if he, is there something else going on and your relationship or did he have some kind of,

Speaker 2:          00:54:20       okay.

Speaker 7:          00:54:20       Something bad happened recently that he doesn't want to deal with or something. And that's why he's so consumed by the video games. Cause I'm just trying to think like what normal healthy, happy person and just all of a sudden don't want to bang. It's broad. Yeah. And hands over his live to a video game. Like I feel like something happens and he's not able to like well you talked to quietly. Okay. Cause it's sticking to them

Speaker 1:          00:54:43       my face like well cause you do this, he started talking. All we all be hand that people can't hear you. Oh okay. I'm going the levels. All right, I'm so sorry. That's all right.

Speaker 7:          00:54:55       Um, yeah I I would not necessarily say let's listen, it's the video games or May, but you can just say something along those lines of like, listen, I feel like I'm not a priority in your life. And if that's the case then we really need to talk about this relationship because if you're not into it and then just let me go so I can find somebody who was into me and it's going to pay attention to me and not their x box.

Speaker 1:          00:55:18       This is what I was saying she should do. She should just fucking dress like a whore and go out that night and it just see if he notices like just to have like fucking, you know, fucking STI highs on and all that shit. If he doesn't get it then by highest. Yeah, just dress like a fucking whore. Their stockings, they go up to your thighs and then they stop and there's this glorious little fucking hands of leg. You're so old that you feel like women are calling out and like thigh high. It's like they're like saloon mistresses like on Westworld. Why? Cause I came of age in the 18 hundreds why you ain't? Why you acting like you guys don't always whore it up every fucking holiday. You'll hoard up on your birthday, your hoard up on Halloween. You'll hoard up on Christmas. Sex it up. It's called being sexy sex in it up. Send it up. Lamb on the fucking bladder. That's what you guys do. It's different to be titties out. Clam peeking out from it.

Speaker 7:          00:56:14       No, cause I don't know. I don't believe in that passive aggressive shit. It's just like, listen, why the fuck are you answer this or not because if not, then I need to move on. The thing is though, honey, he has made his choice. That's what I think that you don't necessarily want to fully admit to. He's made his choice. He's more interested in the video game for whatever reason he won't talk about it. He won't compromise. He's made his choice. Maybe he's not into the relationship anymore. Is that a possibility? Is it a possibility that he or she needs to or it up?

Speaker 7:          00:56:51       She's saying she's like trying and she was trying to like beg him to even have sex, which is ridiculous. It could be that he is just not ended the relationship anymore and he's such a fucking pussy ass pussy that he's waiting for you to be the one to dump him because a lot of people do that. A pussy ass bus, I don't even know. But you know, some people are, they don't want to be the bad guy or they're just immature and cowardly. So they don't want to say, listen, I think we should break up because they feel guilty because it's been five plus years. So they do shit like this to like make you be the one to break up with them because they're cowards. You know what I mean? So it is possible. So in conclusion, what are you saying? I'd say dump his ass. Bye.

Speaker 1:          00:57:36       There you go. It's all right. See you there. All right. Yeah. You want to listen to me read out loud. Oh God. I know. Hilarious is a fucking baby.
