Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's the Monday morning podcast for Monday, uh, November 26, 2012. How are you doing? Um, I hope you are fine. Okay. I hope you are fine. I hope during this holiday season that you and yours and any pets you have from mammals all the way down to gold fishes are just doing great and thinking about prostate cancer. Um, all right. I'm actually, I'm psyched to be back here in la. I kind of have to keep my voice down because the lovely Nia is still sleeping upstairs. Um, I am basically, I'm holding two microphones right now because I've learned how to shut off the external microphone on this thing and I didn't have time to go back to guitars and, uh, figure out how to just use one mic on this and have it come into both my fucking ears, you know, I don't know how to do it, so I got to go down and talk to one of those fucking guys.

Speaker 1:          00:01:05       Sorry. All right. I'm not good at this shit. So I'm sitting here holding two microphones, like kind of like John Bonham. You know, if I could compare myself to him when he played the, the, the, the track up four sticks, two sticks in each in, right? I got two microphones. He's got four sticks go a little bottom this week. All right. Uh, I've got a ton of shit to talk about this week. A lot of sports stuff, by the way. Um, just to get, you know, just for, for all the people that fucking hate when I talk sports, this might be one you just want to shut off. Okay. We just fucking walk away and be like, oh, why does he talk about middle earth? Um, somebody informed me, by the way, that Lord of the Rings, uh, that middle earth thing, it's not in the middle of the earth. It's not like between our world and the center of the earth. Like I thought it was, they're like, oh, hey shithead. It's actually another fucking plant. Well, what does it mean? You know that that writers sucks so bad. He couldn't come up with another name for a planet. They did that with fucking Superman's parents, didn't they? Then he, then he come from like the fucking the planet of Zog or Zuora. It was always big and Scifi. Like if there was a planet or a guy's name, it always had to started with a z cause that just sounded like so fucking alien cause nobody ever named a kid. Like there was a couple of Xanax, you know, what else is there other than Zach Zelda.

Speaker 1:          00:02:30       That's it for me. Zippy, you know. Um, anyway, so let's, let's get into the, uh, let's get into the sports here. The soft fucking weird to be holding two microphones. I feel like one of those divas singers, you ever see that back in the day when they would have to be singing into one microphone, then they'd have another microphone taped to the other one, you know? Yeah, no, you did, you know, you did. You had no, you did. What was that song? Yeah. Not Jeeva three. Bahbahbah remember that you used to say live in Atlanta live?

Speaker 2:          00:03:10       No, sorry, I'm, that's what I'm thinking of. Axel rose with his fucking white bike shorts. You could actually wear white fucking bike shorts, you know, not under your pants. Just that's what you could, where he could have warned that with a hat on backwards with the one size fits all strap, making that red mark on his forehead and know and just done a concert. No one, one had a fucking problem with it, which I guess makes sense because Friday market we're used to kind of walk around like an adult diaper. Did he do like shows like barefoot and like tidy whities and he had like that microphone like stand that was sort cut off. She was sort of like a majorette and like singing a song. Did that happen or did I just dream that? Um, anyways, let's get to the, um, let's get to the sports. This week I think I, I watch the most football Arik possibly anybody in the United States.

Speaker 1:          00:04:02       It's on thanksgiving. I went back to my hometown because I was going back from my, uh, my 25 year high school reunion. G O g g h 25 fucking years. Can you believe that? I graduated high school 25 years ago and I stayed back in the first grade. So when I graduated I was 19 to do the fucking math. I'm 44 years old. I'm fucking, I they, they even spotted me a year and I've still, I'm still at my 25 year high school fucking reunion. And um, I got to admit I was pretty nervous going in that thick, you know what I mean? I haven't seen a lot of those. The kids that I went to school with, a lot of them, literally since the day we got our diplomas and then that was fucking it. So you know, you know the deal, you want to walk in, you want to see everybody looking good, you want to see everybody happy and everybody live in a life that they want to be living. That was my biggest fear. I didn't want to walk in there. I didn't want to be reminded of how fucking old I was and I didn't want to see a bunch of beaten down. I like the 20 years. And she walked out on me know that I didn't want to see that, you know? And uh,

Speaker 2:          00:05:15       got it. Tell you, uh, um, my fucking great held up great. You know, everybody was looking good man. Everybody looked down right? Everybody looked like they were happy, Eh, uh, it was a great fucking time. So, uh, so there's one for your underrated going to your high school reunion. There's a lot of people have like, uh, like hilarious react like, like it's visceral. Is that the right word? Like if you mentioned that you go into your reunion, you know what I mean? People just, you go on your high school reunion and they just go off on this rant, dude, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:05:47       Give a fuck if I never see another fucking porch and I fucking hated everybody at fucking, what the fuck? Fuck.

Speaker 2:          00:05:54       You know what I mean? And it's just like, right. What happened?

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       Who stuffed you in a locker? You know, who broke up with you? What? What did you wish you did but you never did? You know what I mean? You know, first he was like that for, as he was trying to fucking go on and on and on and on and on about, dude, I have no desire. I don't want to fucking go. Like I was getting trashed. I was at the, I was at the stand, you know, that little fucking a euro trash comedy club that just opened up over there on the east side on, what is it on a third and 20th street, you know, with that little Shishi food and a can a little stage downstairs,

Speaker 3:          00:06:33       you know. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:06:36       I was there and one of the guys fucking one of the owners of the club fucking hilarious. I told him I was going to my high school union. I was excited because, you know, I hadn't, I hadn't seen these, you know, I liked the kids I went to school with, you know, I was excited to go and he goes, you go to your high school reunion and he starts laughing. He goes, what do you need? Closure. That was probably the best thing that anybody said. I thought that that was fucking hilarious. But, uh, yeah, but I just kind of found like everybody was just saying that, uh, they had no, a lot of people going, I have no desire. I don't know what happened. I was like, those are the kids who've got like bullied,

Speaker 3:          00:07:14       you know, I dunno just fucking

Speaker 1:          00:07:18       what's his photos versus he ended up safe versus he just tried to say he had no desire to go to high school. He goes, the go go to his high school reunion. He goes, I hated high school. And then I asked him, I said, all right, well who fucking a beat you with your own gym towel? What happened? He goes, not do it. They never happen. Never happen. You got just didn't, I didn't like getting up in the morning to have to go to it, you know, like seven in the morning. Quite possibly the dumbest reason ever to not go to a high school. You, it's like the fucking high school reunion is going to be at night. You asshole. You don't have to go back to your home room. Paul Versey and then I talked to him a little bit more than I dragged it up some chick fucking, I don't know what, I don't know what happened.

Speaker 3:          00:07:58       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:07:59       dude, you couldn't fucking pay me to fucking shut up. Shut the fuck up though. The people, I think you know something. I bet Versie when he goes back,

Speaker 2:          00:08:08       he's going to fucking, he's either gonna rent a flashy car or he's just going to get himself in way over his head on a car. He actually owns,

Speaker 3:          00:08:18       you know,

Speaker 2:          00:08:20       why am I talking about this shit? Anyway, so I went there and uh, and just had a great fucking time. Didn't drink because I didn't want to be the fucking drunk guy, you know, and God knows, I really felt that my tolerance was going to be way beyond most of my classmates, considering most of them are normal, got married and had kids and even if they want a booze, they kinda got to wait til a, you know, the coast is clear. Whereas I can kind of still drink, like I'm still in fucking, not even like I'm in college, like, like it's like it's spring break. I can fucking drink like that whenever I want it to. Which is not a good,

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       it's not a good thing for all belly fat face here. So, um, I decided, you know what, I'll just start off with the cranberry juice and a fucking lime and I'll endorse somebody doing the, the fucking departed joke. What do you get your period? Um, and then I switched to water as an I had a coke and that was just like, you know what? I'm not going to fucking drink. And uh, I had a, uh, I had a great time. What the fuck was, I just, I was leading towards something. Oh, you know what? Everybody did and I thought everything would be taken up. Pictures of their kids. I didn't see one picture of anybody's kid. Everybody was just talking about shit. All the dumb shit we used to do. And uh, and had a great time. Just have really had a great time. You know what a great story that I had never heard.

Speaker 1:          00:09:39       There was a buddy of mine, he's the fucking gamble, like big time, used to bet on like baseball and he had like his own landscaping company whenever, like the baseball team would win whatever team won a money, he would then try and cut somebody's backyard front yard in the same design as the outfield of that team. And it never looked like it. It just, it looked like some sort of fucked up design, but he didn't know what he was doing and he was high probably when he did it. So somebody told me a story about that kid. He had bet the fucking Houston Rockets way back in the day. And a Houston had lost like two games in a row. So we thought it was a gift. You fucking buries the team. And they ended up, uh, they just shit in a bed, nobody's playing or whatever. And he got so mad he picked up the phone and he called long distance and he said, uh, yeah, and Houston last name Olijahwaun

Speaker 1:          00:10:33       and he wasn't doing it to make the other person left. He, he literally thought that he was going to get, I don't know if he was high or whatever, he was trying to get this guy's number to fucking bitch. I'm out for losing and whatever, 50 bucks or 100 bucks in the game. So it was basically just shit like that. And, uh, all right, now you guys getting sick of this. Okay. Whatever. I had a great fucking time. So if anybody who was at the high school reunion is listening to me, it was great seeing you and I'm glad everything seems to be going great and everybody's life. So anyway, so let's get on with the sports here. Um, here's one for you. First of all, oh, I forgot to mention. Yeah, I watched all these football. I went to my Mike high school rivalry game.

Speaker 1:          00:11:16       I went to that, we were two and seven. The other team was like fucking a, what are the eight and one and uh, we actually beat them in overtime. It was an away game, you know, sent the other team, fucking fans home with their heads hanging on Turkey day made me feel fucking great. And then I watched, uh, I watched the first game was that the lions, Texas. Then I watch the next game, cowboys and then I watched the Patriots. Uh, I gave him was fucking unbelievable. And don't worry Jeff Fans, I'm not going to fight. I get it. If you've noticed, I really haven't trashed you guys to share despite the fact I really could have. I just haven't.

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       The only reason why I ever really fucking trashed you guys was because Rex Ryan talked all that shit. You know, he hasn't talked shit in two years and I laid off you. Okay. So, um, anyways, you know that guy always make fun of the fireman. I always say it gets on his boyfriend shoulders like you some hot chick at a Bon Jovi concert, a fireman, ed fucking retired if you haven't heard about this.

Speaker 4:          00:12:18       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:19       He couldn't fucking take it anymore. Why? Because the Patriots beat the team so bad. No, cause he, he has to enter another fucking jets rebuilding. No, cause he got sick of the Conti fucking jet fans getting in his fucking grill cause he's wearing a Sanchez Jersey. The same fucking people who are going calling Mark Sanchez, Sanchez, Sanchez. A few fucking years later, they jump off the fucking bandwagon. Now they get into the face of this old fucking retired a fireman on Thanksgiving getting in his face and he finally just decided, what the fuck am I doing the fuck am I doing? Fuck these people. And you know what I say? I say, good for you firemen. Ed, don't take no shit off nobody. Here's the article. New York jets, super fan firemen, ed, who for decades has fueled home crowds with his famous j e t s cheer has decided to r e t I r e retire. Um, I don't name names, I won't say his last name. Who created a stir Thanksgiving night when he left metlife stadium at halftime of the jets. 49 to 19 loss. Yeah. Along with half the fucking crowd. And then he deleted his Twitter account. He announced on Sunday night that he will no longer attend home games. Is Firemen Ed good for you? Good for you.

Speaker 4:          00:13:53       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:53       You gotta go down there and dress up like a fucking clown to get these people going. Only to have these people getting your grill in the fucking bathroom screaming at you. Shame on you jets fans. And I know what you jet fans are going to say. It was a select few people. No, it wasn't. It was, it was probably almost all of you. And you know why? Because you're horrific human beings and that's why God only let you win one. Um, anyways, he says the stadium has become divided because of the quarterback controversy. He claims the fact that I chose to wear a Mark Sanchez Jersey this year and that fans think I'm on the payroll, which is an outright lie, have made these confrontations more frequent, whether it's in the stands, the bathroom or the parking lot. These confrontations are happening on a consistent basis. Wow. So he just said fuck it. And then Rex Ryan, Oh, uh, I, I actually hung around and watched his press conference where he just kept saying the same. You, oh, we're going to throw it all. We're going to come out next week. I'm going to play hard. I mean that's all we know how to do. You know, it just, you know that that same fucking shit.

Speaker 3:          00:15:02       You know

Speaker 1:          00:15:03       the same guy that one year when they lifted the salary cap and the jets went out and fucking one bought everybody, he's like, well, kicked off

Speaker 2:          00:15:09       shit out of any fucking to move league. It's just great watching him eat a big slice of humble pie. And the final question of the press conferences, rex, do you think you'll still be here next year? And he just goes, yes I do. Yes I do. Any more questions?

Speaker 1:          00:15:29       And there was nothing and he had to walk off on that one and I thoroughly enjoyed it, thoroughly fucking enjoyed it. So there you go. But this guy says he's going to keep going to the, to the games. He's just not going to the game. You know, as firemen, ed, the guys wearing the Sanchez Jersey according to him as like he's being loyal to this guy really is a fan. You know something to people go, dude, the guy used to be a fucking dolphins fan, you know? All right, that works. If he jumped on the bandwagon, it became a patriots fan when the Patriots got good or if he jumped on the bandwagon, you know, uh, with the giants or the Steelers or any other team that was good dude. He went from the dolphins to the jets. Okay. No end. He did it in 75. That was a major step backwards. All right. According to what I've read. Okay. And 75, the fuck had dolphins. They, it, they'd want to two Superbowls back to back. Superbowls had a perfect season, went to three Superbowls in a row. All in the early seventies. They still had Bob Greasy, I think Larry, his uncle was already in the WFL and maybe came back with the giants at that point. Fucking rain man. Here, this is all from my football cards that I looked at a zillion times when I was a kid rather than studying in high school. And um,

Speaker 3:          00:16:45       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:16:45       who the fuck did, did they even have Richard Todd at that point? Joe Nemeth was gone. Yeah, I think they just got Richard Todd. That was it. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:16:56       So this guy, this guy paid his fucking dues. He went to a zillion games. He's the only guy still the balls to where? Sanchez Jersey. This guy was actually a fan and he got trashed by other fucking France. I find that really fucking interesting.

Speaker 3:          00:17:12       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:17:14       Yeah. Had it really actually taps into this. This question, I got this this week. Somebody said, Bill, do you give a shit? He said, hey bill, love you work, but you give a shit about your fans doesn't look like it and sad to see. I don't even, what the fuck? What does that mean? Doesn't look like it does. Is My website subpar? I know the audio was bad last week, Bill. Well, you know you get, sorry. You're going to have to elaborate a little bit more. What happened? Did you, how did Jay, you keep sending emails and I haven't read one yet. Did you have a cold last week

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       and asked me to send you a fucking card and I did what? What does that mean? Do I give a shit about my fence? First of all? I don't know. All right. This is what I feel like. I feel you have a fucking responsibility to give somebody a God damn show. That's what you have. Go out there, give somebody their fucking bodies worth all right. And I like to think I do that. So where the fuck is that and what more? What more do I got to do for you? Where the t shirt or your company,

Speaker 3:          00:18:24       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:18:29       you think that's sad? You know, I think just fucking shad. I think that fucking emails said, what are you doing? You know what? What the, I don't even know where the fuck that comes from. Do I give a shit about if it has? No, I don't. I want to go back to standing in a a fucking function room in a hotel room in front of 80 people who didn't even know there was going to be comedy. Give me a fucking break. Okay. I don't, I don't know what your, your level of, uh, I have to give shit. Let me ask you, let me ask you a question, sir. Do you give a shit about the p the, the, the people that you're fans of?

Speaker 3:          00:19:06       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:19:07       cause I, I gotta be honest with you. I don't, I thought I did, but I fucking love ACDC. Absolutely fucking love them. And I had another bad example cause they've never really fell off. They've always sold a bunch of albums. I loved a lot of bands in the 80s loved them. All right. But when they fell off in the fucking nineties I didn't keep going to their shows. I didn't send them cards going, hey man, hang in there. I didn't, I totally fucking slipped and made fun of them. I make fun of hair metal. To this day, I guess they make fun of myself to saying I can't believe some of the fucking shows I went to. But you know what I mean? It's those people who are still fucking going to those shows what their hairs teased up, acid washed jeans, this fireman Ed sitting there was still wearing the Sanchez, Sanchez gene, a fucking jersey. I guess that that is a true fanatic. But the rest of us I think are a, you know, we're fucking hot and cold isn't the real relationship most fans have with the musician and actor, a fucking whatever.

Speaker 3:          00:20:19       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:20:20       An athlete don't, aren't you really kind of just a fan? As long as they're good,

Speaker 3:          00:20:26       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:20:28       they sold a lot of Sanchez jerseys. Okay. And everybody loved him until he didn't start playing well, and now everybody fucking hates him.

Speaker 3:          00:20:40       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:20:43       I think that's, that's more, that's the reality, you know, so you don't sound, well, I don't know. I don't know where that's coming from, so I can't really judge you. But, uh, I do give a shit about the people who come to my shows, uh, unless they have some sense of entitlement where they feel like, you know, I bought a ticket to your show and despite the fact that you then did a show, so I already got my money's worth, that I definitely deserve more shit. You know, they don't consider the bonus round, you know, taking pictures and signing whatever the fuck they want. They don't consider that like, oh, hey, this guy's actually this guy. Technically it doesn't even have to fucking be out here. And He came out here. Most people appreciate that. Oh glad you came out, you know. Ah Yeah, no, thank you for coming out. Right. That fucking little tit for tat thing.

Speaker 2:          00:21:37       Those people who fucking sit there and they come up hammered and nudge it and they have like a, you know, sign 500 fucking things and I want to have a 20 minute conversation with you despite the fact there's another 40 people waiting behind you. Who else would have jobs and shit to do? And when I say I'll come, sorry, this other people. And then you flip out and say that I'm some Prima Donna cont. Yeah. I don't give a shit about them. I hope I answered your question, sir. You're, you're, I, I, you have me wondering what I had and he need to go redo my fucking website. Maybe update some more fucking photos.

Speaker 1:          00:25:57       all right. He's a big as another fucking thing. I got a bone I have to pick. And you know some, I really came down hard on the jets. I have fans. I know a lot of your fans didn't leave. You guys are the real fucking fans and towards the end of that game, if you looked around, if you really want to see the real fans, yeah, if you were still fucking there and not wearing a patriots jersey. I always hate people who fucking leave early when your team's taken an ass kicking from the other team, cause the end of the other team's fans get to like air quote takeover your, your, your stadium. She never let that happen. Okay. You should have them walking out with their heads down nervous that they're going to get beat down by 60,000 fucking fans. That's what, that's what I feel.

Speaker 1:          00:26:37       Um, all right. Okay. As always. Okay. We fucked with the east coast. Now how about the west coast? Did you guys see a Koby Bryant the other night? I forget who the fuck they were playing. They lost another game. Things aren't going well out there. So there's 10 seconds left in the game. You know, there's no way the Lakers can come back to down like by eight or nine or something like that. So the other team has the ball, they get an inbound it there at half court and they're just standing there dribbling it out. Right? And you just stand there, you wait. Then the horn blows and then everybody just goes and shake hands. And you're going to the locker room. Well Colby, yeah, we'd score 30 points that night. Never dental. He thought he was God's gift to fucking everything. He just walks off the court, left his teammates there.

Speaker 3:          00:27:22       Right?

Speaker 1:          00:27:24       One of the most diva fucking things I've ever seen in my life, just fucking walks off court with the whole, Hey, I scored 30 points. I don't know what's wrong with the rest of you. Totally setting himself apart. Just an absolute fucking cancer.

Speaker 3:          00:27:41       Right?

Speaker 1:          00:27:43       So I'm watching ESPN go nay. Let's see what they're going to do. Is He, they finally gonna fucking criticize this guy, Steven, a Smith who I love, who will rip somebody a new asshole whenever it is deserved. He goes on and he goes and they'd go, Steven A. Smith, what do you think about that? How he just walked off? You see Dwight Howard looking at him like, are you serious? What do you think about that? And Steven A. Smith was just like, well Kobe Bryant has a very high basketball Iq, which I don't even know what that fucking means. He has a very high basketball Iq. So what does that mean? He, but he can't use a fork.

Speaker 3:          00:28:18       You know

Speaker 1:          00:28:19       when the guy has been the best guy in the league for like what, 10 12 fucking years. But whatever. He has a very high basketball Iq and this is just evident evidence of the level of frustration the man is feeling about the current state of the situation. I mean, Paul was Saul, he could not hit a shot and he starts ripping all the other fucking Lakers. Just, that's the type of Shit I can't fucking stand just sitting there kissing the ass of a fucking star. Colby Bryant is a fucking cancer. The guys, he ran shack out of town, you know, they want three fucking titles. And he still wasn't happy. He called Rocco. Remember that shack gone. Goes to Miami one a title. There's another one the Lakers could have got that year. You know not, I don't want to win. I'd rather have it all be me. It's all about me, right? He should've been benched, benched for the first quarter. The next game, and this is the same guy that they talk about in the same breath, is Michael Jordan, the Magic Johnson's, the Larry Bird's. Let me tell you something. Those guys never would have done that shit. Fucking ridiculous. Fucking ridiculous. That guy.

Speaker 1:          00:29:28       Can you imagine that? Nag, Nag. Now you got to go walk in the locker room after Colby just left, left you out. They're like, yeah, you guys all suck. Go fuck yourselves. And then you've got to walk into the locker room and you what? You can't say anything to him.

Speaker 4:          00:29:44       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:29:45       You know what they should have? They should have fucking gone in there. And all of them just hung him by his fucking shorts. Give him a big Wedgie. How high would that Hook have to be? I mean, what is he fucking six eight. I mean what? Gimme a fucking, you just walk out and it Steven. A Smith doesn't say anything about it. He just starts talking about how smart he is at the game of basketball and how he's really frustrated like the other Lakers aren't frustrated. Let me ask you this, like a fence. How many fucking, this is a great thing about lake affairs to these fucking morons. The very next game will be chanting MVP at the, a guy who's run coaches out of town, ran shack out of town. Fuck the team out of another fucking championship. Most likely it's check in his prime. That's another thing too. This fucking guy has had the Lakers organization. He hasn't by the short hairs hasn't by the fucking balls. He does whatever he wants to do. It's embarrassing. Then Tony should have sat him. He should have walked right in the locker room just like Colby. What the fuck was that?

Speaker 1:          00:30:56       You know this is a team. You're not playing the first quarter. Tomorrow night. Hey, I don't want to hear it. Shut your face, but once in your fucking life. Black to say it in Italian too. You know what, he'd be a better player because of it. They should have a team meeting and address his continuous, you know, and you know, he get all emotional, you know when he does, when he puckers up his lips, you know, like we did one a, when they got beat by the Pistons or he got beaten up in the conference finals or that skank out and fucking nod. Denver said the sheer they said about him, he had that, he did that thing with his lips. That's what he would do. Yeah. Colby, you kind of a cunt and he'd start making that face.

Speaker 5:          00:31:43       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:31:44       look, the guy's a beast. He wants to win. I totally respect that. You know, you don't do that to your fucking teammates and, and Steven A. Smith. You know what shame on you. You have a very high broadcaster, Iq. You know what the fuck he did and you know why you didn't hold his feet to the fire. Then he'd go at fucking power. Saul, you go up to the guy who looks like a giant Kenny Loggins come on.

Speaker 2:          00:32:09       I Dunno. I don't like that. I'm like that star as kicks it. Cause you know what happens is if you shit on him, then you can't get the interviews anymore. You know what I mean? Well, maybe he played some sort of pickup game at your son's eight year old birthday party and you don't want to jeopardize that for the nine year old birthday. Just something going on there where I was just, I couldn't fucking believe it. The fucking guy walks off the court with 10 seconds left. Fuck all you guys. This wasn't my fault. It's your fault. What else could it mean? You guys take the fucking loss? You

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       take this embarrassing gloss. I'm above this

Speaker 2:          00:32:44       and Steven Aca, he has a very high basketball. Oh my God. Disgusting. Um, that was, it was borderline offensive. I never get offended. Um, all right, here we go. Pillow Bill. My name is Stephanie Mallow. Molossia. Okay. Why did I just read your fucking name? Well, you know what you said it, uh, my, my fiance, my fiance and I are fans. We saw him in New York and new haven. I'm looking to find more information regarding booking bill for my wedding,

Speaker 3:          00:33:19       uh,

Speaker 2:          00:33:21       in 2014. All right. Now this email was sent to me because they thought that I would think,

Speaker 1:          00:33:26       but this Gig was funny and was beneath me. But a 2014 is a long ways off. So, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:33:36       who knows what could happen.

Speaker 3:          00:33:39       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:33:40       No, ma'am. You know, something, there's no way I would ever work a wedding because, uh, just out of respect for your grandmother and everybody else who's got to be there and, uh, you know what I mean? But I'm, I'm, I'm definitely not above it. Long time ago, I got it. I got to trash and from, uh, the late great Patrice O'Neal, Kevin Hart, Rich Vos, Jim Norton, murderer's row, Keith Robinson, everybody trashed me because, uh, I was, I was basically debating whether or not I was going to do this gig. It was, the Gig was basically, I think I've told this before, but just for new listeners, I'll, I'll go through it real quick. Uh, the Yankees were playing the Atlanta Braves in the fucking world series. I'd never been to a world series game. And, uh, so they called up the comedy cellar and they wanted to Comedians, um, they wanted to, comedians to do, to

Speaker 2:          00:34:35       do this fucking Gig, which was basically they'd rented two buses and they were going to drive up to the stadium and they wanted a comedian to do stand up on the bus. And a, they offered it to me and Jim Norton and me and Jim sat there going, are you going to do it? I'm like, I dunno. I know you're going to do it. I don't know it's going to be raffled both wanting to go to the game. So on, but announced to me, he told us that he wasn't going to fucking do it and I was still hemming and hawing about it and I made fun of his shirt and he said, whatever busboy and the whole fucking table stopped and everybody was like, what? And he goes, Bill Burns doing a fucking Gig on a bus to get a world series ticket. And there just wasn't enough time for me.

Speaker 2:          00:35:14       Try to explain. Well, I'm just contemplating it. They offered it to him too. It was over. And I took a fucking, like about a 50 minute pounding, 50 minutes straight, like a headlining set of just getting trashed. And um, so anyway, so they sent this fucking, and you know what? I actually, I didn't end up doing the Gig, but still I don't, I don't think the Gig was that bad. A gig that would have been such easy fucking Gig. You just get on the bus and you just trashed the Yankees and when you run out of Shit, you make fun of somebody on, hey look and look at the tits on her. That's all you'd have to dope. You make fun of yourself. This has got to be the girl. You know, a lot of you are probably thinking this is a horrible, this is one of the greatest gains.

Speaker 2:          00:35:55       Just make fun of that. This is actually a good gig in your career. You could be drinking with them, having a chance, fucked a Yag fuck the Gado. Just get them genuinely yell at other people on the site. You can just, anything to distract you. Just filibuster for fucking 20 minute ride up there and you go to world series game for free. I stand by it. I stand by it. I still don't think it was a bad gig, although the person who did the Gig, but he was less experienced than me who actually maybe I'll have him on the podcast someday. He actually has his own TV show right now. See that and I don't,

Speaker 1:          00:36:34       so there was magic on that bus. He actually did it and I finally, I told him, I took the pounding and uh, you know, took it like a champ. Just sat there and took it fucking killed. Killed me for 50 fucking minutes and I never gave up his name. I was like, that guy in casino getting is. I popped out. I didn't even bring it up that I actually, I could have just said, I'm not doing the Gig. I gave it to somebody else. Well maybe I hadn't given it to him at that point had I, I can't remember. I just remember the end. I was still gonna do it until it finally it died down. And Patrice just said to me, Bill, he goes, I will stand in front of that bus. You can't do that Gig. All right. You want to go to the world series, buy a ticket. And I was just like, wow, I guess I should have some sort of fucking self esteem smash cut to four

Speaker 2:          00:37:27       fucking eight years later, 10 whatever. How many years it isn't being offered a wedding gig. Um, yeah, I'm going to say no, I'm just, because even even if, uh, you know, I needed to fill the calendar, it's just like, it's your wedding day. You want it, you want it to be nice. You don't want somebody going, I mean, you just saw my act. You saw what I talked about. I'm talking about the fucking apocalypse and people eating puppies. I mean, you, you really want me to, I don't have like a wedding set. If that's what you're asking me, I really wouldn't know. Uh, I really wouldn't know what to do. So, uh, but I'm, I'm great. I'm glad that you had a good time. Uh, that new haven Gig was the shit. And that's something I definitely want to do. Again, like I said, I want to come back for the Harvard Yale game, go to a home game there and I just want to listen in to some of the conversations and who knows.

Speaker 2:          00:38:14       I'll probably be sitting next to a, one of the, a future president or maybe someone who's in the future will be the guy who has the on Hai like cloaked road before he stabs at Virgin. It's some sort of Bilderberg cookout. Um, alright, apocalypse. Hello billion. I am dedicated podcast listener. I'm a big fan of, I do. I've noticed your recent musings on preparing for the apocalypse, buying guns. He, I haven't done any of it. I just think about doing it and the Nia just looks at me and just shakes her head like you're out of your fucking mind. Uh, buying guns, learning how to hunt and survive when the inevitable human population bubble bursts and we run out of food and water. Uh, well I don't think that's going to happen anytime soon. It eventually will happen and it may very well happen within my lifetime. Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:39:03       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:39:04       Well I guess you plan on living a long time then sir. Um, cause you're like, I don't think is going to happen to it at anytime soon, but probably in my lifetime. When you think that, you know, when the overall history of how long man has walked the planet and woman, that that's kind of soon we've been around how long we've been around.

Speaker 4:          00:39:22       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:39:22       A hundred thousand years. I don't fucking know. We'll leave it at, we have been around that long. Have we? Jesus was walking the earth 2000 years ago.

Speaker 4:          00:39:32       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:39:32       He didn't have an iPad or the fuck he did.

Speaker 1:          00:39:36       They went to kill him. Did they, did they use a lethal injection or electric chair? They tied them to a fucking stake if you believe in that stuff, you know, I'm not trying to offend anybody. Some people don't believe it even happened, so people only believe that the guy even existed. Some people think it was just all made up. I'm not trying to offend anybody, you know?

Speaker 4:          00:39:58       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:40:00       Anyways, like you, I grew up in a big city with the, with middleclass parents, relatively sheltered and didn't learn a lot of the basic survival skills as a kid, as an adult with children. I think it's vital capitals, vital that they learn basic fundamental skills of survival, building a fire, making shelter, hunting, et cetera. I picked up hunting as an adult and I have to say it has changed my understanding of the nature of the natural world man's role as a Predator on the planet. How we evolve, where we fit in, et cetera. Um, I cannot underscore the appreciation. You will have a who actually get out there and harvest your own food. Do you have to use the word harvest when you killing a living thing? That's really creepy to me. Just say, fucking blow the brains out of a fucking elk. Um, prepare it and then feed yourself and your loved ones. It's an experience. Someone who sees the world as you do, we'll surely appreciate. Yeah, I think that's awesome. But what am I going to do? Am I gonna I'm gonna go shoot a fucking deer and then tie it to the front of my Prius and drive back down to la. Do you understand what will happen to me? I'll fucking liberal it is out here.

Speaker 4:          00:41:08       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:41:08       I'll get fucking stabbed to death with horse shoes on Hollywood boulevard. Um, if you want to get really back to basics, you should learn to hunt without a gun.

Speaker 1:          00:41:23       I actually think that's cool. Hunting without a gun is great. You said bullets make life easy. I, I keep the bullets for a, for people. Um, you said bullets make life easy, but when the shit really hits the fan, you're going to need to save those bullets in all likelihood of protect yourself from, yeah, it's from other people actually already read that. So maybe his idea was already in my head. Uh, don't kid yourself. The most dangerous animal on the planet is a hungry human who wants what you have. Forget about lions, bears, et Cetera. They don't compare. Yeah, that's God damn right. I don't live next to a lion, but I lived next to a bunch of human beings. Um, learn to hunt with a bow and arrow. The arrows are recoverable and reusable. If you want to get really fancy, you have someone take you out to hunt with dogs or birds of prey or both?

Speaker 1:          00:42:08       Dude, I got to say, birds of prey freaked me out. They really freaked me out. They just a, they don't look, they're not domesticated. I don't like how you to put like that fucking uh, special needs helmet over their fucking heads or else they'll, I don't know what they'll do now. Like those talents. It's like they got a butterfly knife attached to both foot. They like Freddy Krueger and just one day, I don't know what's going to happen. You know, they confuse my face with some sort of red chested Robin or something. I don't know. Clot my eyes. Um, and they always look angry. Like Apple's always looked pissed off, you know, it's got that Dan did offline right above his nose, his beak. I mean, by the way, just in case you think I'm a fringe Wacko, a Wackadoo. I am a board certified physician and my wife went to both medical school and law school. Well, that really did improve anything, sir. You just said that by the way, if you think, and if you think I'm crazy. Uh, I also flew the space shuttle, sir. Um, well tell me how do I do, where do I learn how to hunt?

Speaker 4:          00:43:15       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:43:16       I want to, you know what I want to kill? I want to kill a varmint. I could kill a varmint. Um, could I though? I'd have to be really hungry. I know. I could do it. Anybody could do it. You just have to be hungry enough.

Speaker 4:          00:43:32       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:43:32       Unless she knew about berries, you know. Oh, wouldn't it be the worst you fucking out in the wilderness, right? And you don't know how to survive our hunt, but you're with somebody out there who knows how to survive and is like a fucking Vegan and you're just sitting there eating nuts and berries and shit. Right. Stick in your face in a beehive, trying to look up some honey getting stung in the face like a goddamn brown bear instead of just killing a rabbit.

Speaker 4:          00:44:00       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:44:00       And you guys got to deal with this guy. You know what happened? Eventually, eventually you just, you just, you pick up a branch per tenant was like a walking stick and you just the club over the head just in a moment of frustration and then have that panic of being alone in the wilderness, not knowing how to get out.

Speaker 4:          00:44:17       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:44:17       Did I just pitch a short film? Um, you know, I smoked a cigar last night and I got like third of the way through it and I was like, I'm done with this fucking habit. Now I got a stupid fucking,

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       what do you call those things? Human door. Anybody want to fucking humidor? You just want one. You want to just take this fucking disgusting habit out of my life. I don't want to do it anymore. You know, it's fucking horrific to horrific fucking habit. You know how I know it is because there's not a bad smell to a dog. Dog will walk up to another up dogs fresh pile of shit and stick his nose right in it and can have it there. It doesn't gag or anything. All right. If I'm sitting there with my cigar and won't come anywhere near me. Now what does that tell you? Said gars smell worse than poodle. Shit. Okay. All right. The truth behind pink a bill, you should check out the, the outer documentary titled Pink Ribbons Ink. It discusses the culture and popularity of breast cancer awareness month while exposing some of the hypocrisy involved in case you don't watch it.

Speaker 2:          00:45:20       Let me give you a couple of highlights. You can talk about the film without actually having seen it. Well, thank you sir. You got right down to the core of who I am. Give me the cliff notes. What do we got here? Why do we got here? Um, the woman that invented the pink rhythm as a method to raise awareness quickly. One of the most annoying phrases out there raising awareness. Could it be any more fucking vague, vague. Cheevan I am aware it's breast cancer awareness month. I got it. Everyone's in the NFL is wearing pink. I am aware job done now nobody can fuck with all the money that you took in. Is that the loophole? That's what I'm trying to guess. Then you go out and you and you, you buy a, a pink Bentley but they can't get you cause it's pink, right.

Speaker 2:          00:46:07       I'm raising awareness. Okay. And I spent this amount of money on this car to show how theory, if the problem is, um, raise awareness with breast cancer at a, was approached by self, sorry, the woman that invented the, uh, the, the, the shit was, uh, approached by the magazine, self magazine aimed at the ladies and s the SD. Estee Lauder, Estee Lauder, Esther. How do you say that? Estee. Estee Lauder. That's one of those things I've heard people say it's lean times. So it just, I don't know, in the early nineties, uh, to partner with these corporations knowing that these greedy costs were only interested in the pink room as a way to increase their bottom line. The creator of the original pink ribbon refuse to correct, collaborate and told self and Estee Lauder, Estee Lauder, uh, to go fuck themselves. So these corporate fucks created a pink ribbon that was technically a different color and the pink saturation began.

Speaker 2:          00:47:06       Another interesting point the film makes is that companies like, why did you have to pick Estee Lauder? I just set it right. Estee Lauder. There it is. Promote breast cancer awareness by turning pink. The labels of products that contain carcinogens isn't that fucking hilarious. Uh, of the money that buying all this pink shit raises, apparently only 15% of it is used for researching prevention of breast cancer. Most of the research goes to figuring out which cancer drugs work best for treating the disease once it occurs. Yeah. And nothing preventative because the money is not in the cure. It's in the treatment. Anyway, check out the movie pink Ribbon Inc it's available on Netflix instant. Thanks for the podcast and all the free funny. Well you're welcome

Speaker 1:          00:47:51       sir. Um, yeah, yeah. I mean, I'm at that read that book that I'm reading. Uh, I may take it for whatever you want. I mean, obviously I'm not a nutritionist, but the, uh, that eat to live book where it talks about vegetables and that type of thing and uh, and fruits and all the, uh, antioxidants and how it, I know it helps regenerate some damaged cells from all the shit that you do. Yeah. I really believe it just once a day, if you just have a giant fucking salad and eat a couple pieces of fruit, you can offset all that other stuff because I got to tell you there's no way

Speaker 2:          00:48:25       I'm ever going to a 100%, uh, just never have a steak again. You know what I mean? Sorry. It's just some steer out there that's going to have to fucking die. By the way. Why do they have that in the commercial? Why do they have a cow saying, eat more chicken?

Speaker 1:          00:48:39       They don't feed your cows. It steers and a steer is basically a bowl with its ball's locked off as far as I can tell. That's what I was told back in the day when I would do college gigs and a, I would see both randomly see a ball and I would see a bunch of cows and then I would see stare and I'd be like, all right, a bulls, a male, a cow's a female, what the fuck is a steer? And they've said it was a bowl with the balls lopped off. So I'm one of the like Unix. They don't hit puberty. I don't fucking know. But anyways. Um, next question here on the podcast, a Gyno gain. Oh, hey bill, what's your opinion on this? My wife recently had a Gyno appointment. I hate that. Just gynecologist gain or makes it sound like it's all goopy and gross.

Speaker 1:          00:49:26       It's disgusting. But that's what I think. A gynecological appointment as a thoughtful husband, I remembered. So later in the day I casually asked my wife, hey, how'd the appointment go? She said, the doctor said, everything looks great. I was incredulous. I don't know what that means, but I think it means you're upset. He said, I said, what? What did he say? She said, he said, everything looks great. I said, no, no, no, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. Really? Really? What? What? What were his, his, his exact words? She said, those were his exact words. Everything looks great. Then he writes, motherfucker, are you kidding me, Bill? Does that comment seemed completely unprofessional. You, I mean, he's a freaking doctor. He should have said something like, everything looks in order or everything looks healthy. These God damn doctors. Remember that doctor man. See any from Melrose place. He was a real sob. They're all like that. Especially these creepy guy knows what kind of becomes a Gyno. Stop saying that word, sir. The fuck is this? What the fuck? Just popped up on my goddamn computer in the middle of a critical moment. Get the fuck Outta here. Um, anyways, get back to, plus my wife is very attractive and now he's telling her that her pussy looks great.

Speaker 1:          00:50:49       The guy says, Hey, I know a pussy looks great. That's part of why I married her. We're really fucking frost me though, is that I had to pay this guy 50 a $50 copay for his observation. It's like he's laughing at me anyway. What do you think about all that? And I wouldn't mind knee is a opinion as well. Uh, should I get involved here?

Speaker 4:          00:51:11       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:51:11       Thanks. Don't mention my name. All right. All right. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:51:17       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:51:17       You know what you, what you should do is just do what you just did to me because what you say it is funny. Did you just say it to your wife in a funny way and just be, and just be like, what? Who, what does this guy look like? Does he look like this doctor [inaudible] from Melrose place? I don't know what he looks like, but that guy sounds like a fucking sleazebag, you know?

Speaker 4:          00:51:41       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:51:42       Why does he get to just look at you? You know, I had to buy a ring. I had a wine and dine United to do all this type of stuff. I actually love you and I only see it a couple of times a month. You'll get on there for not just something, there's gotta be something funny though, because there is something actually, uh, um, I don't know, women might not agree with this, but there's something caring about this, you know, I see how much, you know, you're into your wife, you don't like some other guy just looking at it without saying something. Ah, you know, ah, shit, my fucking phone. Who is this? Who is this and what do you want them in the middle of talking about Gyno? Um, yeah, I think, you know, if your wife's a hot shit, she'll, she'll get a kick out of it. Like that's the kind of thing that would make a,

Speaker 4:          00:52:28       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:52:29       that would make me laugh if I ever said something like that. Oh yeah. How long was he checking you out? Did he have you lay on your belly?

Speaker 4:          00:52:39       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:52:40       Yeah, I gotta check the other side of the, uh, the, uh, your vagina, just a on your belt is lay on your belly and sort of, uh, just point your, your, your buttocks. They've used like those, those words, so it didn't sound perverted, you know, at the ceiling. Um, oh, speaking of perverted, I can't even get into this.

Speaker 4:          00:53:01       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:53:02       Let's just say early on the podcast I mentioned that I went to something and saw some people that hadn't seen in a long time and uh, let's just say, uh, some older creep from the faculty showed up for whatever fucking reason.

Speaker 4:          00:53:20       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:53:23       there's always one. There's one,

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       um, creepy. Okay. Overrated, underrated, um, underrated. Ah, going to your high school reunion, Eh, uh, overrated. Getting fucking blitzed at your high school. If you, I think if you'd like, you have your five year, your 10 year, you can go in there and get a little bit. Fuck, you definitely get drunk at your, your five year, 25 year. You know, you get a nice little buzz going plus a, you know, I don't know if you'd like the kids you went to school with. You want to be able to remember what the fuck he said. You know, anyways, underrated. Having a tight ass for a boss. As much as everyone wishes that their boss wasn't such an asshole. It's about 20 times worse to have a cool boss that cuts corner, cuts corners and doesn't do their part. Yeah. Then the company goes under and then you looking for work.

Speaker 2:          00:54:10       Um, overrated. Bill. Whenever you see a list of the greatest movies ever made, you will always see gone with the wind on that list. Right? My family and I decided to watch it for the first time on Thanksgiving. It was fucking horrible. It's basically a three hour movie about a self centered content throughout the movie. You watched this bitch gold dig her way through without any remorse for anyone else besides the protagonist being unlikely unlikable. The plot is fucking stupid. It really has no point. When the movie ended, I yelled, that's it. That's the big fucking ending. Avoid at all costs. None of us liked it.

Speaker 3:          00:54:51       Uh,

Speaker 2:          00:54:53       I got it. I have to watch it now. Is that the one we ends? Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn. That was basically the 1940s version of saying, yeah, why don't you go fuck yourself? You cunt. All right. You've got to be old and you too.

Speaker 1:          00:55:05       You're going to fall. And then where are you going to be? Huh? Do you hear teased up on all those goddamn noodles sitting here on the fucking plantation? What are you gonna do then?

Speaker 1:          00:55:14       Not even the non hired help. I'll listen to you. So go fuck yourself right there as soon to be flabby. Tits. Okay? If you're not coming with love, all you got to, you looks okay. There's no botox at this point in, in, in, in history. You're finished. All right? So why don't you get over here and suck this Dick while you still can and then [inaudible] and they roll the fucking credits. All right, Neil. Log preview here. Everybody. Um, this was sent to me. Hey, build, love the podcast back. Cataloguing it like crazy. Thank you. Here's my fucking problem. I got a roommate who was wonderful. We're buddies. We watched stupid shit. You know what? Fuck this. I gotta make this. I gotta make this larger. This print is too small. Here we go. I've actually learned how to do this. Select everything. Uh, go up here. Go from 12.

Speaker 3:          00:56:04       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:56:05       let's make it fucking 18 like a grandmother. There we go. All right. I got a roommate who's wonderful. We're buddies. We watch stupid shit and left together about it. All right. Uh, he's got this girlfriend who's a drain on everything that is fun in the world. I'm not talking the regular guy, girl argument crap. I mean, everything. Quick example, we were watching that BBC planet Earth series and we just joking at the most beautiful shit in the world, literally, and all she could do is bitch about how ugly the birds were. Complained about David Attenborough's voice or get mad at some animal just because it's killing another animal to fucking survive. After we finished, she said she would love to be on the crew of a nature documentary shoot. She's got no soul. The guy loves her. They'd been together for over a year, but it's so clear he can't stand to be around her. They only ever argue,

Speaker 4:          00:57:03       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:57:03       Oh, they only argue and not in that great way that you and Nia did in one of the podcasts where you all laughed with each other. It's unbearable. And she's at my apartment five days a week. Yeah, dude, you know something. I get it. You're in a relationship but either move in with this bitch or let's have a fucking two days here, two days there. You know, you got eight home games a year, you got eight away games in the NFL. Let's try to set it up the same fucking way. So this is like baseball. At some point you got to have a fucking road trip. Okay. There's sport. Um, anyways, most nights I eventually either drink or smoke or just so I'm not in the same world as her and I like smoking. Who am I kidding? Uh, I want to talk to him about it, but he's a really private guy.

Speaker 1:          00:57:46       We've never talked about his relationship stuff. He stands to tea, tends to steer away from it. It's becoming pretty obvious that I can't stand this girl, nor can any of our friends. I'm afraid that she's going to drive us apart. Then feast on his soul. She, she, she can try and find some kind of personality for herself. How do you think I should approach this with this guy? I got a right to complain to him about this girl, right. Got To do a tender, Leah something. Um, all right. This is the deal. I almost started singing when a man loves a woman, but I'm not going to do that to you.

Speaker 4:          00:58:18       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:58:18       But it's true. Okay. When a man loves a woman, no other way to get into this point. I can't believe I was able to say that without singing it. Uh, even, even I as much as bad as I sing, no, I can't even, you want me to do it? All right.

Speaker 6:          00:58:36       Wow.

Speaker 1:          00:58:39       Um, there's no fucking way you can approach, um, the country things that annoy you about them. Well, you have to do is just walk into another room and just like literally just grab a pillow off of the couch. You know, after she says something and you just walk in the other room, you just go,

Speaker 6:          00:59:02       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:59:04       And then you just come back in and he go, oh, so what are you major in? All right. You just do that. But you do have a right as a roommate to have some sort of parameters, all right? The problem is, is you've let it get out of control. All right?

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       So here's the deal. Either this dude's going to marry this girl or he isn't, okay. He's going to marry this girl. Your guys, your friendship is fucking over. You're not going to hang out with him cause he's, he's with this colossal cunt. You're gonna meet somebody else. Then eventually you're gonna get married. You can have kids, you barely gonna have time to see this person anyways, even if you liked his wife, okay. But the fact that she's a cunt, she's just going to fade out anyways, okay? So there's nothing to worry about. They're losing this friendship. If he's going to marry this girl, it's fucking overdue. Okay. It's a done deal. All right?

Speaker 3:          00:59:58       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:00:00       And if he's eventually going to break up with their, whatever you're going to say to him now, he's eventually going to come around and he's going to be saying all this shit that you're going to say to him or want to say to him. So you don't need to say it. You just get you all. What you really have to deal with right now is just trying to cut down the amount of time that, that fucking, that, that, that hell content comes into your apartment five days a week. Dude, I don't care if you even like to just say, listen. Um, I respect you and your relationship. You know, I'm really happy for you. You seem really happy, but you know, it's just a gel. This is fucking hard. She's coming over here five days a week. Ken, is there any way you can, you can kind of cut that in half a couple of nights over her place. Because I like to come out here, like to smoke a fucking bomb and I like to watch the fucking TV. What are they do? You could do though what you do? Ah, yeah, but she's, I, I like to do it in a country atmosphere that has no fucking way to do this.

Speaker 3:          01:01:03       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:01:05       You know what, you just basically going to have to ask yourself, what's more important to you, your friendship with this guy or you're, you're fucking,

Speaker 3:          01:01:16       you know,

Speaker 1:          01:01:18       your ability to fucking have a beer and smoke a joint without this bitch fucking ruined and you, you, you know, five nights a week. Okay, I would suggest this. Okay. If you still want to be friends with this guy, he didn't want to rock the boat, then I would look for another place to live if you could, which is fucking sucks. You got to pay to move. But I'm telling you, you're going to be psyched. How old are you? Do maybe it's time you should fucking live alone, you know, cause you might jump out of this, out of the fireman and out of the fire into the what and out of the frying pan into the fire though. This is fucking rough.

Speaker 3:          01:01:51       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:01:51       I don't know how to just say it. So listen, dude, I don't know how to say this to you because I feel like however I say it, you're going to feel like I'm attacking you and that you know, you're going to say something to your girlfriend and she's gonna think that I don't like her, which I don't. Um, just say, listen, she's coming over here five days a week. She's not paying rent. You know, I like hanging out watching TV and I'm coming over here. She's taken up half the couch. I just need just can we cut it down to four days a week, three days a week? I don't mind her coming over

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       here. Just not five out of the seven days. All right.

Speaker 1:          01:02:24       I want to come out here and my underwear, rub my balls, drink a fucking beer and watch the game. I don't want to come out here, you know, dress like a, I'm a on fathers knows best. You know, you know, back in the day that fathers would walk around the house and a God damn suit, right?

Speaker 2:          01:02:41       You know what, dude? Sometimes you just got to burn a friendship. There's all different ways you can do that. You could just, you could just be honest and just say, listen to it. If this fucking girl comes over here one more time. So do you like mommy to cut it down to like three days a week now? How about zero? How would you break up with her and realize you can get somebody better? How about that? You know,

Speaker 1:          01:03:05       I dunno. So that, that is definitely a rough one. I gave you a number of options.

Speaker 2:          01:03:11       Um, I would in no way say how you feel about that girl, the of buddy. You can't do that. Um, I mean, he can't, but there's just going to be ramifications to that. But uh, I would definitely try to get that, you know, try to get that number knocked down. All right. Did I just say the same thing for fucking 20 minutes over and over again? All right. There's an hour. There's an hour for you. All right. That's the Monday morning podcast for this week. I'm going to be at the Brayer Comedy Club in, uh, in Bray California. Let me get to my fucking website that evidently that guy's got me feeling bad about you. Give a shit about your food. I hope you do because if you don't, it's really sad. Oh, Jesus shows, here we go. I'm going to be at the Brayer Improv. Uh, November 30th, December 1st and December 2nd. All right.

Speaker 2:          01:04:07       Friday, Saturday, Sunday of this week. This is my last headlining Gig of the year. If your dream was to see me at some point in 2012, this is your last chance. Um, I guarantee you're going to see a great show because I'm loving my act right now. And um, I took last weekend off and I'm chomping at the bit to get on stage and I got a bunch of new fucked up shit that I want to talk about and uh, watch something the other night that I got really inspired by actually watch the documentary of the making of Michael Jackson's bad. And it just made me feel like I, I don't work nearly, you know, I don't work hard enough. It was really fucking inspiring and also kill me as I got off at that subway stop with a, with a shot the old day, the whole dance thing for bad and it's weird. It's like you come down the stairs and there's a middle level and then you go downstairs again and the amount of times I've ran through there trying to fucking catch a train and didn't even look around.

Speaker 1:          01:05:05       I wonder if I looked around at what a noticed it I think would have to be like nobody in there. If it was a bunch of people I don't think I would've noticed. But if I was there late at night and I was looking around making sure I wasn't going to get jumped,

Speaker 2:          01:05:16       you know, I wonder if I would have

Speaker 1:          01:05:17       noticed. I probably wouldn't have, I probably wouldn't even notice if I was fucking coming down with my iPod listening to the song bad.

Speaker 7:          01:05:26       Ill Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do bill bill, Bill, Bill, Bill.

Speaker 1:          01:05:32       I would've walked right by la. Um, anyways. All right, that's the podcast for this week. Thank you everybody for listening. I hope you had a great thanksgiving. Um, and that is it. Ed. Um, thanks to the person who organized the High School Union. Like I said, I don't name names here. Uh, I had a great time and I think I'm going to go to the next one. All righty. That's it. Go fuck yourselves. I'll talk to you next week. Oh, gee. Sheesh.
