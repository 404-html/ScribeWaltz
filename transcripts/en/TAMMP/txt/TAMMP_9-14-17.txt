I said greatest fucking thing about Saturday morning. You decide all right, and I don't care if you got kids. I don't care if you've got a wife, you've got a husband and this Dan, I hear you guys. I need you to shut the fuck up. You're not the boss of me. It's Saturday. I'm staying in this fucking bed. Hey, the kid's crying, sweetheart. I am crying. What did they cry? They didn't want to fuck. They're crying about, oh they downstairs. You know what? What? What are they doing right now?

Speaker 1:          00:01:11       What are they crying about? What toy does somebody want that somebody else he had this. That's not a life or death situation. I am going to lay in this fucking bed and I want to get up when I decided that's what Saturday's all about Santa, that feeling you have on Saturday morning when you can basically do whatever the fuck it is you want, provided the woman in your life is afraid of you joking. You can do whatever it is the fuck you want to do. All right. That feeling right there, that's the feeling that you should be working towards. Okay. That misery, that Monday through Friday awaken, I got away. Glad I got to wake up cause I have, cause I fucking, I get an agreement with these people down the street that I have to be there and they have to be able to see my face at this particular fucking time and I got to trudge in here and do this fucking job.

Speaker 1:          00:02:11       However, once you get to feel what it's like to be living your dream acquaintance, you gotta be thinking, what bill? I can't fucking lay in a bed a whole fucking, you know, Monday through Sunday. How would I eat? How would I eat that? Right there is what handouts or for it's what? Seven 11 to four you want to sleep in every day? This is what you do. You sit outside is seven 11 you make a little sign. All right. You don't write it on a nice piece of notebook paper. You got to write it on like a piece of trash you so people know that you're struggling right now. I'm fucking with you. Somehow you got, you got to become self employed. You got to work for yourself if you want that Saturday morning. Granted you're going to still be working on only you get to work Monday through Friday when you're self employed, you work Monday through Sunday, but you'll get up when you want to get up. All right? And you at least have that feeling of a little bit of control and freedom. Then he can take it too far. Like the ultimate Saturday I'll get up when the, wherever the fuck I want to is that fatty cakes there in North Korea. Okay. And you can tell by his build that Guy Sleeps Til at least 11 every day, you know? I bet he has like kid pajamas. Does he look like he would, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:03:31       giant speed racer bed or some shit. Something about him. He seems very childish,

Speaker 2:          00:03:37       you know.

Speaker 1:          00:03:40       I Dunno. You know what it is. I bet he just, because he was the, the dictators son, nobody ever picked on it, but he looked in the mirror and he was like, the only reason why they're not picking on me right now is because

Speaker 1:          00:03:53       if they did, my dad would feed them naked to two wild dogs. That's the only thing stopping the Calafat. I am, look at me just standing there looking at his hair. Hairy, hairless fucking tore self. Right. I bet he's getting any right. Some man, whole fucking level. Any, there's some whole enemies trying to fill. Um, anyways, I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. How about those Cleveland? God Damn Indians. 21 victories in a row. You're never going see this again. I mean it's fucking amazing. That is really amazing. Um, and how great would it be to see them and they're ones, was it 1948 they ended it this year? I Dunno about my red sox. I don't know. I'm going to keep saying that hope and I jinx them into coming together. I kind of fucking fell out of love with this team. I've said it before when they fucking yelled at Eckersley I was like, come on. There was no discipline about, that's a hall of Famer. You know what you're doing in a hall of famer walks in a room. You shut the fuck up. That's what you do.

Speaker 1:          00:05:02       And if he criticizes you, you say, okay, fair enough. I'll try a little better. Their sport maybe asked for exotic now. Now you don't ask for his autograph. You want to be a professional. If you want, if you want to act like you're, you're, you're in the same business. You never asked for an autograph within the same industry. Okay? None of it. Forget that. I've seen people do it. It's an ugly, ugly fucking scene. I know a guy that fucking play golf and a celebrity fucking tournament, right? Why can't I ever type in my password and talk at the same fucking time? It's unbelievable. He played in a celebrity golf tournament and one of the guys in his fourth son was actually a fan of his and then fucking hanging out the palling around. Everything's going great. And then when that, when they would done at the end of the round, he asked for a picture in the guy's face just dropped. And that was it. It was over. He went from hanging out with that guy to be in back in the crowd, thrown his panties out of what is my point? My point is I like sleeping in on us.

Speaker 1:          00:06:05       Um, all right. Let's see what's, I don't have anything to talk about today because I'm just stuck in a fucking writer's room. We just, we're doing the table read this morning for episode, uh, three Oh seven. Oh I can't be screaming at, my daughter's still sleeping. My mom, my wife's probably going to fucking kill me right now on say, is there a reason why ever since Bill Clinton, they just won't let somebody be president? I really think you know what it is. I think it's because of, I think it's because of social media and 24 hours news networks and all of that type of shit.

Speaker 2:          00:06:36       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:06:37       This is like CNN, CNN who refuses to cover any, anything about Hillary and the Democratic Party, ignoring the votes during the primary and boxing out Bernie Sanders who actually gotten more votes. And then Hillary actually has the fucking balls to be like we should do away with the electoral college. Oh, because the fuck over that you ran on Bernie Sanders then was done to you. I've never seen such an entitled fucking person. Everybody talks about how entitled Trump is, and I'm not saying he isn't Jesus fucking Christ. She really thought that that job was hers. It's fucking unbelievable. Anyways. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:07:20       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:21       It's unfucking believable. Um, all right. It says Sean Spicer basically admitted that he was willing to lie for Trump. Now, what is shocking about that?

Speaker 2:          00:07:35       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:36       Do you think there was nobody in Obama's cabinet that was willing to lie for him or bushes or Clinton's or first Bush or Reagan or Carter? That's what happens.

Speaker 2:          00:07:47       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:07:47       Think about in your life, there's people you're willing to lie for.

Speaker 2:          00:07:52       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:07:52       You know, your buddy's fucking hammered behind the wheel. The cop comes up, you sit down, officer, he's, oh, he's fine. He's only had a couple of, you know, you do that. It's a friend, Jesus fucking Christ and everybody fucking sitting here acting like the president runs the country is fucking hilarious. Like he's decisions aren't decided pie all the money that you fucking need to get in the fucking office. Right. I don't know. They keep saying Trump used most of his own money. I doubt it. I don't fucking, I don't even know what the fuck I'm talking about. I'm just so fucking sick of people. You know, acting like this guy is way worse than the other guy because the two or three issues other than that, as far as the environment, as far as the food supply, as far as the heroin epidemic, it's the exact same thing. Don't fucking say shit about it. Right. Is that what it is? I Dunno. All right. After Chicago, Tj, ginger is found dead in a, in hotel freezer. Mystery lingers. This is why I don't want you to know North Korea's latest nuclear tests so powerful. It reshaped the mountain above it.

Speaker 2:          00:08:59       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:08:59       Okay. Well, we have its nuclear power. It's powerful. Rush your fires. Cruise missile at ISPD stronghold. Is that the cool way to say Isis now is I a stronghold in East Syria? Russia is about to kick off a war game that is freaking out. NATO. Here's what we know. This is why I don't read the news. I wouldn't know. I wouldn't know any of this. It's a game having a game. They can't play a game in their own country. Coordinated attack in southern Iraq kills at least 50

Speaker 2:          00:09:35       okay?

Speaker 1:          00:09:35       Okay. No good news yet. All right, let's go to the United States. Let's see what good news is here. Eight dead after South Florida nursing homes, air conditioning fails following Hurricane Irma.

Speaker 2:          00:09:49       Great.

Speaker 1:          00:09:51       Next one as the White House calls for her firing.

Speaker 2:          00:09:55       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:09:55       Espn Jamelle Hill. Address the elephant in the room.

Speaker 2:          00:10:03       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:04       What the fuck is this? How the fuck did we go from the White House to a reporter on ESPN? Now this, now this, I'll tell you. Let's here. I gotta read this one. I got to read.

Speaker 2:          00:10:15       All right,

Speaker 1:          00:10:17       here we go. Here we go. What did we say? How's hours after a White House spokesperson called for Espn to fire her? Because she called president Trump a white supremacist on Twitter. Jamil Hill or Jamelle modal. He'll tweeted about the topic Wednesday night saying she was going to address the elephant in the room after becoming the latest flash point in a cultural skirmish that is involved. The sports network. Once again, hashtagging your tweets. Hashtag facts hill wrote my comments on Twitter express my personal belief, my regard, my regret is that my comments at and the public way I made them painted ESPN in an unfair light. My respect for the company and my colleagues remains unconditional. Yeah. How the fuck do you have that job? And No, you can't tweet some shit like that. You're going to get fired because at the end of the day, all ESPN gives a fuck about is ratings in, in, in money. That's what they care about. Uh, all right, so when asked Wednesday afternoon by the Post, David knock a mirror lockup Moreau. It's a good last name. Uh, about hills original tweets. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said she was unsure whether the president was aware of the kerfuffle they cause, but at, of course he was aware. Okay. Fucking tweets every day. It's like a seventh grade girl. I think that's one of the more outrageous comments that anyone could make and certainly something that I think is fireable offense by ESPN. Get the fuck Outta here.

Speaker 2:          00:11:46       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:47       Oh, give me a fucking break. I love how ESPN thinks that reflects on them and all they is. A couple of [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       Iran may have, you know, further woo at the bottom are prevalent. Oh, ain't gonna walk to see if the Yankees beat the fucking Indians tonight.

Speaker 2:          00:12:03       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:04       Yes you are. What else are you going to do? Read a book. It's his sports network. This is some of the dumbest people on the planet, myself included.

Speaker 2:          00:12:15       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:16       You how many times I've tried, I've gotten so disgusted with the NFL. I tried to walk away. Then I just had to admit that I was too weak to do it. I like how the NFL ratings are down now and they're trying to blame that stupid Colin Kaepernick thing. That's what it was. Oh, that's what it Wa wasn't what, you know what it was is they just got greedy. I think it's the NFL plus it, it goes in cycles too. You know what I mean? It's like the NBA where they had bird magic into fucking, uh, Jordan and then there was a little bit of a lull there for a minute. Right. And then like a, I dunno.

Speaker 2:          00:12:52       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:53       I guess the spurs more fucking exciting enough. Um, I dunno. And then you know, eventually you other guys came along, the Brown came along. Yeah, the next one. Right. I think football goes to the same thing, but the problem is that these, these, these guys in the NFL, they're trying to go global and they're trying to appeal like please, as many people as humanly possible. So they kind of abandoned their original fit in the end. You know where the NBA is right now. The NBA is where you two was when Bano started wearing those big fly glasses, the big mosquito glasses and was saying shit like this is the most surreal night of my life, man. He started playing a character,

Speaker 2:          00:13:34       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:13:37       in eight years they went from carrying a fucking white flag and all, whatever the fuck it is they were doing back then. I was never the big youtube guy. Okay. As I told you before, I didn't listen to the right music in the 80s. I was listening to a crocus and helix, how's this and all those fucking beds, you know what I mean? And then I was watching sports and I was flunking math and French class. I mean, that's basically what you've been listening to all these years. If you ever wondered, um, I don't need to go to ancestry.com to figure out my mystery.

Speaker 1:          00:14:16       I am a fucking dope. I am a dope dope when I walk into a room, dopes shut up just to listen to what stupid thing I'm gonna say. Um, anyways. Yeah. They fucking, they, they did the pink thing. Let's have the football players wear pink. I love how, like for some reason the fact that a football is a really male testosterone aggressive thing that like for some reason guys have to apologize for that and they just can't have, is that the word of feminate? They can't make it like, like feminine enough all of a sudden cause all these feminist bitch moaning and complaining has all these corporations all in a myth like, oh we don't want to be considered sexist. The next thing you know, they're wearing pink for a month. It's if the NFL gives a flying fuck

Speaker 2:          00:15:15       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:15:16       About anything other than making money. Cancer. This is what we care about. Your brain Terman into scrambled eggs. Yeah. We don't get in. You killing yourself by the time you're 50. We don't give a fuck about that. Oh, is that what you did? Here's 40 bucks for everybody who ever played the fucking game. They don't give a shit. Um, according to reports, they kept like 95 to $97 for every hundred dollars he made off of that pink shit. So give me a fucking break. They show people in the crowd that are in the military, they charge that branch of the military. They treat it like a commercial as they tell you to support the troops. The Fuck Outta here. Right? So now what? So now all these women's groups sit there bitch moaning and complaining. So now they got, they got female referees, they get women calling the games.

Speaker 1:          00:15:55       They got the guys wearing pink for an entire fucking month. They got lady Gaga singing at the fucking halftime at the super bowl. They took a total fucking left turn. And when you do that like you to do is you're going to lose a lot of your original fan base that are like, hey man, I liked him back when the boy I liked the first album. I saw him when there was only 8,000 people at the fucking show. That's basically what they're going through and they're going to survive it and they're going to transition from, you know, the frozen Tundra and all of that fucking, you know, making it seem like it was fucking d day. All of that great shit that I loved. They are going to transition out of all of that and I think that there's going to be a lot more futures in, in teals and all that type of stuff coming into the NFL is they try to, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:16:50       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:16:51       I Dunno. I think I say try to get ahead of this next generation of people that that's coming up that goes out to comedy clubs and literally just stares at the comedians. Like that's what I'm experiencing now. I was at the comedy store last night. Granted something fucked up happened before I went on stage. I guess it should have realized that. And uh, they, yeah, just uh, just staring at me staring at me. So I dunno. I Dunno what I have to do. You know what I'm thinking? Actually maybe I'll, I'll start wearing pink on stage and then people will think that I care. Um, anyways, I don't want to, I don't want to fucking, I don't want to call out any fucking specific fucking people. I don't want to fucking do that cause you know, I sucked as a comedian. Eventually I got better at it, but I mean, Jesus fucking Christ, if you're going to go down that road, you still have to pick somebody that's of a fucking certain level of professionalism. Now, if you're going to have a fucking national game,

Speaker 2:          00:17:54       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:17:55       I mean Jesus Christ, and I'm not talking about that poor bastard that froze like a deer in a headlight. That fucking kid on the side too. I just felt bad for that dude. You know what I mean? But I'm just saying, you know, if you're going to call a fucking game, good fuck it, Lord.

Speaker 1:          00:18:14       Good Lord. Um, this is actually my dream. My dream is somebody that like is like a fucking went to broadcasting school and then you pair them up with someone that played the game. I know they tried to do that all the time, but someone that actually can tell a story that played the fucking gate, that's when it's the best. Like Collins worth, John Madden, Phil, I love a lot of people. Didn't like Phil soon. I love Phil Simms, the Guy Fucking, you won a super bowl. He's the first guy to say, I'm going to Disneyland. I'm not going to listen to this guy. All these guys who play fantasy football trying to say the guy doesn't know what he's talking about. Yeah. What? What would he know about what? You know? He only played the game professionally. You fucking moron.

Speaker 4:          00:18:52       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:18:56       I Dunno.

Speaker 2:          00:18:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:19:00       Wait a second. What the fuck is going on here? All right. I don't know what the Hell I just did. I had my recorder on the floor. I don't know when the hell I just chopped it off, but I had the thing recording on the wrong speed. I Dunno what the fuck happened anyways. I don't fuck, I don't know what's going on and what's going on in comedy clubs. I don't know what's going on and a in the NFL, I don't know what the fuck they're doing and this is just, it's just part of becoming old.

Speaker 2:          00:19:29       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:19:29       Like why did I got a partner of street lights up so bright? Like I'm just an old man. Don't fucking listen to me.

Speaker 2:          00:19:36       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:19:37       Anyways, I don't understand how I had a half hour to do this before nine o'clock and it's almost nine o'clock and I only have fucking 20 minutes done probably because I stepped on the recorder and I said the fucking worst. I'm the worst anyways. So congratulations to the NFL. I know you guys want to go global. I hope you fucking do it. Um, you know, I'm sure you're jealous of the UFC that started way after you guys and they were able to do it. You are free.

Speaker 4:          00:20:03       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:20:06       You know, I don't know what the fuck to tell you.

Speaker 2:          00:20:08       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20:09       I Dunno what the fuck to tell you. It's just like, I don't, I, uh, I kinda like college football. My start watching that and then eventually they're going to get pressure to fucking make this game a male testosterone game for some reason. We need a bunch of estrogen in it.

Speaker 2:          00:20:28       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:20:28       You know, this is what I don't understand about women. Okay. Every study says that they're way smarter than men. Right. They can handle a stronger level of pain.

Speaker 2:          00:20:39       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20:40       They're more in touch with their emotions. They could do all of that shit and you know, for them, far as my experience goes, I'd agree with it for the most part.

Speaker 2:          00:20:49       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:20:50       I don't know about the arrogant. We're smarter than you. It depends on what the fuck you talking about. Right? But I'll give you, I'll give you all of that. But if that's all true, what if fuck kitchen starts your own sports league? Why don't you do that?

Speaker 2:          00:21:02       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:21:03       What do you constantly have to fucking infiltrate some shit? A bunch of guys doing some shit that you know at the end of the day you think is fucking stupid. It's a bunch of guys smashing into each other's scrambling. They're fucking brains trying to get a ball crossed the fucking line to score points. You know, you don't give a shit about that. Why can't they come up with their own Goddamn fucking sports league and then from top to bottom, fucking can be all women. Then you turn that thing into a global billion dollar fucking entity. And then women get all that fucking money. There's your power. You'll fucking join a guy's league. And then they give you a pink flags to throw holding office. It's like, why would you do that? I don't know. I don't fucking know. I don't know. I don't understand these things.

Speaker 2:          00:21:55       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:21:56       All I can, all I can do is we equate it to my life as I can tell you this, when I worked for somebody else, I like the fuck over is you can't, you can't keep up. You can't keep track of him.

Speaker 6:          00:33:55       stop acquiring going the box.

Speaker 5:          00:34:10       Ooh.

Speaker 6:          00:34:16       Frank Sinatra. Oh, by the way,

Speaker 1:          00:34:24       by the way. So I'm all over the fucking map here. Did you fucking see that? Shameless fucking Hillary Clinton?

Speaker 7:          00:34:32       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:34:33       Trying to pander to get the African American vote. She's on some radio show. I just watched a clip. I had to shut it off. Forgive me. I don't know what radio show it is, but she's sitting there. She goes and she's trying to get the black vote and she, they asked you what's something that you always carry around with you? And she said, hot sauce. What I found the Clintons are the fucking, I swear to God.

Speaker 7:          00:35:01       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:35:01       Can't you just see both of them on a used car lot to one of those cheesy local commercials? Do they had the fucking devil?

Speaker 7:          00:35:08       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:35:09       I remember when Hillary Clinton ran for fucking, uh, Senate after eight years of being in the White House to fucking Yankees had won four world series. She never showed up, never said a fucking thing. And then all of a sudden she's running for fucking a Senate in New York, shows up with a brand new Yaggie hat goes. I've always been a Yankee fan. And then this big grand, like I said it now, they got to like me. This is how out of touch she is. She literally thinks that. She just has to say, I carry around hot sauce and I'll, all black people are going to be like, oh shit. Oh, I can relate to that. What's she gonna do next? You get to go to fucking Chinatown, which I always carry around soy sauce. We go down south, you know, I love guns and my cousins, sorry, sorry, I shouldn't have said that. Um, hot rods. I've always liked hot rods. Fucking shameless. This is the thing about like when you're at her level of fucking wealth, which is really, I don't know how you explain it. You know, when her husband, you know, had the highest office in, in public office and you only is president, you only make four, 500 grand a year. Somehow they threw their daughter a $3 million wedding. I mean, how does the math work there?

Speaker 2:          00:36:31       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:36:31       They are the fucking, she is the fucking devil. I'm telling you. You know. Oh my God, what a fucking selection this year. Can you fucking believe this shit? A reality show star.

Speaker 2:          00:36:44       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:36:45       You know who's sitting there with that fucking, I don't know what the other guy's name is. Nick talking about the size of their hands and having a good size of your dick debate running for office. You got Hillary. You fucking write it. I'll say it. She doesn't give a fuck.

Speaker 1:          00:37:01       This is why I gotta be honest with you. Why I like Republicans better than Democrats because the Republicans at least have the decency to just show, to openly show you that they don't give a fuck about you and Democrats. They actually tried to act like they give a fuck how people thought. People who work for a fucking living, they don't did the same fucking people. They just lie about it. You know? I swear to God, if Bernie Sanders would just fucking gold the hallway, you know what I mean? Don't stop in Kuwait. You got to go all the way to Baghdad with these fucking bankers. Okay? That's what you gotta do. You gotta tip over the statue when you got to have all those top level bankers swinging at the end of a rope. That's the only way to stay. Got To start over again.

Speaker 1:          00:37:46       That's my candidate. None of them are saying that. So it, it's over. And I know you're thinking, Bill, you don't know shit. And you read conspiracy theory and you know what I say to that? You're absolutely right. Okay. All right, let's move on. That was, uh, that was, uh, that was political comedy right there, if you will, if you're wondering what that was supposed to be, she goes to little Italy. What do you always have in your purse? A jar of Marinara sauce. Who's your favorite singer? Dean Martin. Oh my God. Did you see the house? She looked like she rolled her eyes. I don't want to put like shit on her that, that's what she fucking did.

Speaker 2:          00:38:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:38:28       That's how out of touch she is. Hillary Clinton thinks black. All black people walk around with hot sauce in their purse because white don't know how to season food. Uh, I'm not saying there aren't some black people did do that. You know what I mean? But you know, that would also be people who aren't white, who look at white people and think we're all in the upper 1% standing on a yard shooting the shit with one of the Kennedy's and they're fucking weird in Brenton inbred dentition. I never understood the Kennedys. I, they, they're from like the nose up. They're really good looking people, great hair, you know, nice fucking big five head, you know, it looks great on TV, decent eyes, you know, and then you just get to that, you get to those, those, I mean it was kid. No, they look like from the nose down, they look like Clint Howard. I don't know what it is. There's something going on with that family. You can't, uh, you know what it is, is they still look ethnic. They feel, look at, um, if you look at like, like white people from like, like look at Joe Dimaggio, you know, he's probably considered a good looking guy. That guy is fucking deck.

Speaker 7:          00:39:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:39:38       I don't know what happened once everybody got all mixed up, like all the fucking Nash and I was getting mixed up. Like do you know, started streamlining the looks and people are way better looking now. Don't you think then when you look back in the day, I mean, Jesus Christ, Babe Ruth, every once in Lou Gehrig was a good looking guy. You know what I mean? But Babe Ruth, that guy was a mess. Joe Dimaggio mess. I can say what I want. Bad Looking. I don't know. I'm just saying when you look at the shit back then, like an Italian guy looked a hundred percent fucking Italian. I don't want to, you know something. And when I went to Italy, they were better look in the back then. I don't know what the fuck it was. We allegedly had better food back then. People were shorter. I don't know what it was. Did you ever notice that when you look back and when you really look at those old pictures? I love looking at old pictures and it's like that George Carlin bit. When you look at an old picture and you're like, everybody in that picture is dead. If for some reason in a morbid way, it's like fascinating. When I look at those old pictures, I just, that's what I think. I God damn it, there was some fucking ugly ass people.

Speaker 1:          00:40:41       You know what I mean? It was a game changer was, uh, three things. Polio, vaccine, penicillin and braces. Those three fucking things could just hide so many fucking imperfections. You know what I mean? And once you get braces, Jesus Christ, if you just brush your fucking teeth in remotely, keep yourself in shape. You know, you throw on some nice clothes. People have no idea where you came from.

Speaker 7:          00:41:11       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:41:14       back in the day, people, they saw it on your teeth, told the whole fucking story. You just smile and be like, hi, I can, I can see you're going to have tuberculosis. You live in a damp Dag fucking apartment with no fucking windows. You saw it in their fucking teeth, right? I don't know about it. Heard what's his face? Jp Morgan had like Rosacea. Is that how you say they're all over his face? He was just all fucking angry. Those old school rich guys, you know, he used to walk around with top hats. It's like the penguin harm while walking down the street. Um, is this a podcast anymore? And I don't even, what the fuck I'm talking about? Let me, let me do some advertising here and then I'll, uh, I'll get to more babbling here in a moment. All right. Hot Sauce. A shameless fucking shameless. She looks in, bred her fucking teeth. There's something going on with Tara. There's some go with you see how Bill Clinton collapse now. It's like he's a, like a marionette puppet. He has his mouth open. That's how he made it. But that smiling with his mouth open. Oh, I'm going to fix it. I'll fix everything. How you doing? Call me later. Oh.

Speaker 6:          00:42:48       Oh, whoa.

It's just kind of first ladies in general, you know, I don't know what it is all throughout my life with each presidency. Like these first ladies, they've just gotten more and more like, like a, like chatty, you know, more, more chime in in like leaning into the frame, fitting out their ideas. It's just like, well, why are you talking? You weren't elected. Shut up. Your husband's not running a lemonade stand here. He's running the country. You don't just Shyman. Let me guess. Is this considered sexist?

Speaker 4:          00:43:49       Hello?

Speaker 8:          00:43:49       Okay. You're just not at link. Let me ask you this. Let's say you had a leak in your house. Okay? You call a plumber up.

What'd you be like with all due respect? Shut the,

Speaker 4:          00:44:11       I need a plumber in this moment

Speaker 9:          00:46:46       going on his bill burr, and this is the Monday morning podcast from Monday, September 14th, 2009 um, it's like fucking 10 20 at night. I finally got some time to do the podcast today. I was flying back from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. I lost my cell phone, you know, once again, I lost another cell phone. Every time I get a nice cell phone, I lose him. So I just reactivated my little flip phone. Those of you who go on to bill [inaudible] dot com when you listen to my podcasts, you see that picture of me right there looking down at the bar and that little 15 year old chicks flip phone that I got there, that's what I'm back to. I went from a blackberry to that thing, you know, you know, just once I would like to lose a fucking phone and call it and have someone on the other end be my savior.

Speaker 9:          00:47:38       Be like, why? Yes, yes. I have found your phone and I would love to return it to you. There was nothing more. I would like to do the maternity now, free of charge, free of charge. That's what happens to everybody else. I know you talked, my girlfriend loses her cell phone. She calls up. She just, you know, oh my God, I have my cell phone and that she just picks up Mike. She goes, let me use your phone. And then she just goes, you know, rings like twice and it's always the nicest person ever on the other line. She's like, Hey, yeah, yeah, it is mine. I thank you. Oh, that's awesome. Oh, okay. Got It. Right. And then I'm driving her somewhere to go pick the fucking thing. That never happens for me. It just rings and rings and rings and then I just hear my voicemail. Hey, this is bill. You've reached my cell phone that you're never going to fucking see again. Please leave a message and you might want to call river, you know, call fucking Verizon and avid shutoff is for somebody calls Trinidad on this God damn thing. Fuck.

Speaker 9:          00:48:40       So that was my day. This is how old I am too. You know what? When I was flying out here, there was a, there was nobody sitting next to me and actually he was fell asleep, you know, laying down on the row. And when I woke up, like I felt like my lower body dislocated from my upper body. It wasn't even like my back hurt. It was just like, I felt like I hit by a fucking car. It's been a brutal day is what I'm trying to say. People. But my weekend in Philly was awesome. So many people showed up. So many people showed up. We added a show that's never happened to me, you know? So I want to thank everybody. Before I get going on this long rambling podcast here, I want to thank everybody in Philadelphia who came out to see me. I had a great time and I was working there with, uh, Joe to Rosa, the a teen idol, the new hot shot teen idol on the opiod. Anthony show was opening up for me and, uh, all my God did the Raiders just score a fucking touchdown is in no flag. Holy Shit. Are they finally going to beat the charges?

Speaker 9:          00:49:45       Okay. I don't want to ruin you guys. Who Anybody Tivo the fucking game. They just went up 1917 with two 34 left. You know, it's funny, I was supposed to have a bet, you know I'm a patriots fan and I was supposed to bet these guys shredding Reagan out in Buffalo, right? I made him a $50 bet last year when Tom Brady went down that they are patriots who are gonna make the playoffs. Cause they was saying that they would done. So if the Patriots didn't make the playoffs, I on both 50 bucks. But if I won, they had to read a written apology to build Bella check that I wrote and they had to read it on the air. We went 11 and five but we didn't make it. So I owed him 50 bucks, but I never went to buffalo and it can never pay him.

Speaker 9:          00:50:25       So Lo and behold, the first game of season, we're playing buffalo. So I go, hey, let's go double or nothing, you know? And they wouldn't touch it. They would not touch the fucking game on air. I was like, dude, the worst you could do is break even. And then they still, they still wouldn't back their own team and look at the fucking game. They actually almost want it. They were actually did win it. They just blew the game. But uh, so I'm glad, I'm glad I saved myself. 50 bucks each. Shredding Regen. If you listen to this, you guys punked out. And you know what's funny was when I got off the plane, I actually got a message from one of the guys that works. There's t trying to get me to call in at the last second. I bet a lot of their listeners call them punks for not taking the bet.

Speaker 9:          00:51:08       And uh, unfortunately I'd lost my cell phone or I would've called in, but it worked out for me. Um, I'm too fucking frazzled to do this guys. I really am. I can't fucking do this, but I got to get this done because I got too much shit to do tomorrow usually. And I enjoyed doing the podcast. It's usually in the morning. I'm usually screaming and I'm having a good fucking time, but now it's late. My dog's asleep. My downstairs neighbors asleep downstairs. Neighbor doesn't like us. We have hardwood floors and my girlfriend has high heel shoes. So you can do the math on that one. Let's just get, let's just cut to the chase. You guys mind if I do a short one this week? Yeah. Well to fucking bed. Um, let me, let me give you some happy shit because this isn't going to be happy.

Speaker 9:          00:51:53       I'm fucking exhausted. Let me give you some youtube videos to watch this week. All right. This first one, um, I stumbled across because someone else showed me something else. Um, this video which you want to search is it says try not to laugh or say WTF. Basically what the fuck. But you just write WTF all lowercase. Try not to laugh or say WTF and a, I'm have a feeling a lot of women won't find it funny because it's just really like you'd have to be in the seventh grade or a mail to find this funny. I can't even explain why. It's why it's funny, but it just makes me laugh my ass off. But it's, it's a great video cause you will either laugh or you will say, what the fuck? Um, here's another one. Somebody sent me a search, gay top gun. You guys ever seen the movie top gun?

Speaker 9:          00:52:54       And you've seen Tarantino goes on his rant that it's actually a homo erotic movie. The way this person edits it is fucking hilarious. And I haven't seen the movie. Oh my God, I probably haven't seen that movie since the late eighties. You know, I remember, I saw, did I see in the movie theaters now? I think somebody bought it. So many, my family bought that movie that was actually considered a good movie, you know, and uh, you know, we had it on Vhs, so, you know, the usual life of a VHS tape, it lasted like a fucking year then it was all screwed up from being rewound, you know? So I haven't seen it basically since of what have 89 or 90 and uh, I got to go with Tarantino on that one. At least the way this Guy Edison movie, man, it's fucking, it's really funny. All right. The last youtube video you might want to check out at this one.

Speaker 9:          00:53:49       And I'm just search a dance kick baby. Alright. Comedian, last night who I worked with, very funny guy told me to uh, Jeff and I've already forget his last name. I'm such a moron. He was hilarious. So, uh, he told me to check this while dance kicked baby. Um, it's, it's, I can't say it's funny. It, it'll definitely make you put your hand over your mouth. Um, cause it's not dance kicked baby. It's not that. It's dancing and then a baby gets kicked. All right? You want to, if you want to see what happens when a toddler gets fucking, just check it out. All right. There's a lot of sick fucks are going to look at that one first. Um, like I said, this is going to be real economical, economical, whoever the fuck you say at this week, uh, let's plow ahead. Here's some advice. Somebody wants to listen to this story.

Speaker 9:          00:54:42       This one really a, this one really grabbed me here on a lot of levels. All right, bill asked bill a bill. I was at a family birthday party today when some friends of mine, friends of my dad's showed up with their smoking hot daughter, um, make after making a few glances at each other. I figured I had a good chance of getting her number. I went over to her, my dad introduced us and we made a little small talk. Her mom then asked if a, she wanted a piece of cake or anything. So I decided to be a fucking gentleman and offered to get her a piece. So I come back with a slice of cake in hand only to see my brother, and he's written this in capital letters. So you know, this isn't going to go anywhere good. He goes, I come back only to see my brother capital letters talking to her, um, and already getting her number on the guys that she's interested in getting into law enforcement and he happens to be a cop.

Speaker 9:          00:55:36       Uh, that pretty much canceled me out since there's no way I was going to pull the same shit in which both brothers asked her for her number. Yeah. That would've been creepy. So he goes, uh, I handed the cake and the three of us talk some more until her parents decided to leave since it was towards the end of the party already. Um, after that, after they left, I immediately told my brother, you know, walked up to my brother and I told him, what the fuck. Since everybody could tell I was trying to get our number. He joked along with my, what is that? U. N. D. E. S. I don't know what that word means. Eat all my uncles. I couldn't read that. Sorry. This is volumes up way too high. Here. Let me turn this thing down. Sorry. Um, record level.

Speaker 9:          00:56:28       I don't know. I don't know how to fucking do that on the fly to it. Does that work? That's better. Hello? No, it's still fucked up. All right. Whatever. I'll hold the mic away from me. Told you guys, this one's going to be brutal and exhausted. Um, anyways, so he goes, yeah. So I went up to him. I said, what the fuck? Since everyone could tell I was trying to get a number. He joked along with my uncles saying she's 26 and uh, I guess he's 20 and his brother, the cop is 21. So he choked her with his uncle, said, come on man, she's 26. She's out of your league. And that he beat me to it. I figured, yeah, I guess he did and didn't. Uh, so I did make a big deal or anything after that. Since I'm not a little bitch, who's going to cry about it?

Speaker 9:          00:57:16       I'm going to cry about some twice number. However, I still thought it was fucked up. If it had been the other way around, I would have just let my brother do his thing. I guess it comes down to the bar scene where if you step away to get a bitch of drink, you're leaving the field pretty much open for anybody else. I don't know. Do you think it was a fucked up move or just part of the game? Uh, thanks and hope to see you on stage soon. Um, well what do I think about that? Ah, all right. I don't want to blame the victim here, but what I learned in that letter is that your brother's kind of a dick. You know, that's kind of a dick move. And uh, you know, I wouldn't have done that to my brother, but you know, he's doing it to you that that's, that's a dick move.

Speaker 9:          00:58:07       And you live with the guy. So you know he's a Dick. You know what I mean? And you kind of answered the question. Yeah, you never, you never leave. First of all, even if you know, even if he didn't come over, you're already setting up the relationship that, you know, you're just going to be fetching her stuff, offering her, you know, are you cold? Do you want me to get you a blanket? You know, you don't wanna be that guy. You know your brother. I don't know. I really want to make fun of the fact that he went to law enforcement a, let me teach you how to be a cop. All right? This is how your Fris somebody, you know, but believe me, you use what you got. You, you think I have never met her fucking good looking girl. And I said, uh, you know, worked away in that I was a comedian and an invited her to his show her in one of her friends hoping desperately she would only show up by herself so I could try and fucking banger.

Speaker 9:          00:58:58       So I can't get mad at him for that. Um, yeah, in the future I would just, I just wouldn't do that shit around your brother. That's a really asshole thing and I think you need to get him back somehow. I want to, I want a story of revenge from you. That's what I want. But the end of the day do the chicks fucking 26 years old and you know, she's got a 21 year old trying to figure out our future, you know, she's a loser and plus, you know, just the way you were talking about it, you know, I learned a, you know, you never leave a bitch alone to, you just wanted to fuck her anyways. Right. So whatever lesson learned, lesson learned, and to use the top gun analogy, your brother is now, he's not a wing man. He's not a good wing men. So fuck that guy.

Speaker 9:          00:59:39       And uh, I dunno, you know what you could do, this is something I used to do way back in the day when I was in Boston and I used to go to this place, daisy Buchanan's on Newbury street, which was a total fucking meat market and I'm sure it still is. I used to go in there with a, with a couple friends of mine, you know, going there, you know, I have a couple of drinks and just start talking shit to girls or whatever. Trying to fucking hook up because God knows that's easy to have three guys. That's always a nice magic number.

Speaker 9:          01:00:10       No wonder we never hooked up. But we used to go in there and I forgot what you just called it, dropping bombs. I can't remember what it was, but basically you wouldn't cock block, but she would definitely fuck with your friend. If he was, you'd see him hitting on a girl and it was going well. You'd walk up to him and you would just make up some detail about his life. That would be embarrassing, that he would have to somehow play off. Um, unless she got serious and you really got mad. Like a buddy of mine did one time and mentioned that a friend of mine was still living in the basement with his mom. That's what he said. He had just got done striking out. So then he came walking up, all hammered and he's like, Oh yeah, this guy was fucked. This guy was one of these dudes. You know all those guys who like who look up at the ceiling when they talk. And he was one of those guys and he just came walking up and that's what he said. He goes, Oh yeah, yeah, you liked this guy. Hey did you mentioned that you still live at home with you?

Speaker 9:          01:01:08       And he said it really angry. You know what else this guy did as a classic story? I kept leaving in a fucking, told us we were in daisy Buchanan is one night, right? It was just one of those nights, you know, I dunno what we were talking, the women were responding. We were like, Holy Shit, this is going great for once because believe me, we did not do well. There's a reason I had to get on a stage and act like a jackass. Okay. So, uh, I don't know what happened. Met this group of girls and it was going great and I, we all having a good time and everybody kind of paired off, everybody was vibing, right? And um, all of a sudden you just felt the whole energy, energy of the bar just look towards the front door was like somebody, you know, famous or, or something was going on.

Speaker 9:          01:01:50       You know, like when all of a sudden there's like a commotion, everybody just looks in that direction, right. So it was weird. Everybody just sort of collectively looked at the doors, like a wave that went across the room every second. Everybody felt the energy just looked in the direction you felt the energy coming from. And we look over at the door and I swear to God, what the fuck just happened? San Diego just scored Jesus Christ. Fucking Raiders. God Damn fucking guys. Just can they ever beat San Diego? All right, let me plow ahead. So they fucking, um, everybody just goes and looks at the door and we look over and there's this guy dressed like Elvis fucking Elvis impersonator. This is the most bizarre cock block I ever got. This guy standing there, of course like fat Elvis, some comic did that joke. Nobody, nobody ever dresses up like the in shape Elvis because no one was ever that good looking.

Speaker 9:          01:02:44       They always dress like the fat one or something like that. Right. So everyone's just fat Elvis. He's got the fucking, you know, right before he overdosed on pills, sunglasses on, and he was doing all like these moves to whatever music was on and uh, he fucking, yeah, like every girl in the bar and was like, oh my God, they all fucking ran over to the guy. Yeah. Right. So it was like everything was going great with could we're going to hook up and next thing you know, fucking fake. Elvis walks in and the girls just run away and they all run up to the guy because they don't want to get like their picture taken with them, a fucking whatever. So every guy in the bar were kind of stand like, yeah, duty. You fuck you gotta be kidding me. Right till my buddy who looks up at the ceiling, he has, he walks up to the guy, you know, and the guy standing up to a meeting, everybody will show up, man.

Speaker 9:          01:03:32       How you doing? All right. All right. Taking care of business. How you doing buddy? Like doing the Elvis thing. He's got the fucking leg shaking and everything. So my buddy goes up there, right? And he starts shaking the guy's hand. He's like, well, shut up my Maya and my buddy's like squeezing his hand. Right? And he's looking up at the ceiling. Yeah, but the fake Elvis can tell these pissed. He's like, what? What's the mind of man? And my body's just like, he goes, hey dude. He's like squeezing in his hand. He goes, hey buddy, why can't you just be yourself? You know? He's like looking up the same way because why can't you just be yourself? You know? He goes, I like the red sox. I don't come in here dressed like Roger Clemens and the guys like going, he's Kinda dropping character going, all right man.

Speaker 9:          01:04:10       All right dude. All right. All right. Like his voice has changed it and they start having this fucking handshake fight, squeezing each other's hands. And they were about ready to go at it. And at that point I was like, I was gonna see the greatest thing ever because my buddy was big. I was like, if he fucking punches this fake Elvis and I see those plastic glasses helicopter off of his fucking face, ah, please let him be wearing a wig. And right before they did it was like, you ever see like a Nhl game when the ref steps in right before two goons are gonna go at it. The guy fucking broke it up, but it was still good. My buddy had a fucking handshake fight with Elvis impersonator. It really just broke the guy down. That's what I loved. Everyone is like, oh my God, Elvis, what's going on? I thought you died. No Man, I'm always alive. He's just playing along. Oh God. Let me get a picture of the okay on it. You know, he's doing all that shit and then my buddy just comes up. Hey Dude, why can't you just be yourself?

Speaker 9:          01:05:09       Ah, fuck. Those were some drunk days. All right, let's plow ahead. What the fuck was I talking about? Yeah. You know what, dude? MMM. Two things I would tell you when your brother, first of all, don't fucking hit on women when you're around your fucking conti brother. And if he does pull some shit like that, uh, you know, you got to do something that you, this is what you gotta do to that guy. What you have to do is the next time he's hitting on a girl, you have to deliberately go over and fuck it up. You got to figure out some way to fuck it up. And what you're doing here is you're kind of shooting one across the bow just to let them know that if he does that shit to you again, that there will be like repercussions. You know what I mean?

Speaker 9:          01:05:47       And then just get the fuck away from the guy and continue on. You know you're doing fine. Right. You had no problem walking up to the girl. He had a strategy. You're good. But yeah, there's no, there's no sense dude. You're 20 years old, man. You're in fucking mint condition. He don't eat some fucking 26 year old we can do with that. Right. I know you'd fucker. Exactly, but you're not going to marry you, right? You don't have any feelings for us. A fucking fucker. And Fuck your brother. Fucking 20 year, 21 year old cop cop were at the mall. How did he, how long do you have to go to school to be a cop? You know? Anybody else have that? Like you went to, there's a kid in the grade above you and he's like the biggest maniac ever. And then you become a senior and next thing you know he's coming in, he's breaking up keg parties and you're like, dude, I was in shop class with you six months ago.

Speaker 9:          01:06:38       No, I'm a police officer now. Wow. Well full on. You've got the gun and everything. I think I just missed a fucking unbelievable game doing this God damn podcast. It was two scores late in the game. You know what I hate about football? I hate how they always show the Douche bags who dress up like they're going to the rocky horror picture show. You know what I mean? I went to a Raiders game. Not everybody is dressed like a douchebag and make no mistake. Those are douchebags. Okay. There's people who fucking make a hat out of a football. You know, they did it the Patriots game too. I was joking with my buddy, I go, can't they just show some regular fan who looks like he has season tickets and could actually talk about the game? This guy had like a, you know, silver glitter on his face with the Patriots.

Speaker 9:          01:07:30       Amble people wearing football helmets to the game. You know, it's almost like the guy in the TV truck is just telling the cameraman, just find the biggest douche bag you can find. That's what we're going to show. I went to, I went to a Raiders game a couple of years ago. Man, it was, it was great. You know, just a legendary place. Even though it's been a while since they've had a lot of success. They did go to a super bowl, gets Tampa Bay a few years ago, but I actually met this older guy, man. He had like the Ken Stabler silver and white beard at some booze on his breath. You know, he's a football fan. If I wasn't sitting there dressed like Boba Fett is fucking dumb. Hate people do that shit. All right, let's plow ahead here. Um, all right. Uh, Bill, I was bored and thought I might give you something to think about.

Speaker 9:          01:08:18       I live in Europe and would love to move to the u s but I have no idea how to even apply or even if it's a good time to do it. I'm 30 and I've been stalling for years, but I don't want to pack a bag and just end up as a some homeless guy in the corner in America. I've always loved New York as the idea, as the idea of this, that city. What as the idea of a city that never sleeps fits me. I'm, as, I'm a little older now, I've already seen most of my friends friends leave into the domestic lifestyle and I just can't fit into that yet. I spent a lot of time alone for a few years and it's just like your act, you start going a little crazy. Um, I feel like an observer in life, so I do and say stuff just to see what happens sometimes. Would it be, sorry I'm scrolling down here. Would be a good ground.

Speaker 9:          01:09:15       Would that be a good ground for comedy maybe? Or should I have started in my twenties I also play guitar and people have said I might have something musically for years, but I was always a coward in my youth and couldn't get on stage unless I was hammered. So I never got anywhere. Now I'm worried I lost too many screws and as my social network has begun failing, I just get the bitter alone against the word world feeling. It feels like I'm at a crossroads. Everything I've seen in life seems like a weird dream and I'm surrounded by strangers. What do you think? I think that's pretty fucking deep. Um, what is, well, if you're not married, you don't have any kids and you want to always wanted to move to New York, just fucking do it. Save up some money and just do what you're never going to regret.

Speaker 9:          01:10:03       You know? Or if you live in America and you're like, Hey, I always want to go to Paris, what would happen if I just fucking went there? Do it. The very least. You just got to get some great stories. You know, you're going to come over wherever you're going to go. You're going to have an accent. You're gonna Hook Up. It's going to be a good time. I would definitely say to go and don't mind. Fuck yourself into thinking you're too old to do shit. Look failing. The, uh, uh, how do we put this failing is overrated is far as like the pain that people have. It's not doing it because I have a lot of fucking regrets in life. I got a lot of undergrads, I'm not going to get into them, but I got a lot of fucking regrets and I've failed a lot as a comedian, but none of them really hurt cause I just kept doing it.

Speaker 9:          01:10:49       You know, remember that old Michael Jordan commercial where he talks about shooting the basketballs, all the shots he's missed. He's like, I failed over and over and over and over again and that's why I succeed. You got to take that mentality through. Failing is fucking hilarious. Failing is, it's the best stories. It's the funniest fucking stories. Watch when people, when actors go and they do panel on talk shows, they never talk about, you know, oh I did this. The bad guests go on there and talk. Oh, I work with his director. Oh my God, he was so great. But the good guests go on there and they talk about bad auditions that they had or stupid things that they did in the great movie that they're promoting. That's what the fuck you do, you know, to kill as a guest. Look at me. I'm a little tired.

Speaker 9:          01:11:33       I'm, I'm, I'm making a different point now. Now I'm telling you how to kill doing panel even though I've never fucking done it. Um, yeah, dude moved in New York. You're not gonna be homeless. It's like a big river and you just jump in and you just start swimming. But from the outside it looks impossible. But once you go there, you're fine. You know? And if you do an up homeless, fortunately it's a walkable city, so there's plenty of people to panhandle. Although if you're white, you might have a rough time. At least. I did. Did it one day as a joke just to see what people would do. I was dressed really nicely and it just had a cup. Excuse me sir. Sir, could you spare a little change? Just trying to get home, try and make a phone call. But I had a shit eating grin, so I didn't make any money.

Speaker 9:          01:12:16       All right, next question. Now I'm plowing ahead this week, people. Uh, all right. Hey Bill. I'm a huge fan. Thank you. Thank you very much. All right. You won't be after this low energy podcast, um, throughout my life no matter what I've done, I've, I am known for being a horrible child. All right guys, let's stop here. Uh, just let's just remember that I barely got out of college and I have a communications degree. So let me communicate with you right now and let you know that if you guys are going to go real deep, cause I had somebody sent me like one, they would like suicidal and uh, I kind of didn't touch it because a, I didn't want to give the wrong advice. I was going to say go talk to somebody quite qualified, you know, and don't kill yourself. All right, so let's try it.

Speaker 9:          01:13:04       Let's, you know, let's, let's back off the throttle a little bit here. People, this is supposed to be a funny podcast. All right. The light guy just walking around feeling like it's the dream and I'm alone. You know, I, that's when it starts getting like, all right, I've had those thoughts. Well, I guess I've had those thoughts so I can relate. You know, I thought about killing myself. A lot of people think that shit, you just don't do it. You know what I mean? It's like leg sweep and a chick. You think about it, you just don't do it. But if someone makes a video of it, you fucking watch it. And it's hilarious. Um, all right, let's plow through here. Throughout my life, no matter what I've done, I've always been known for being a horrible child. All right? This guy has gotten right to the root of his paint.

Speaker 9:          01:13:46       No matter what I did, it wasn't good enough. Um, I think I'm pretty and I feel bad cause I mean making fun of people as if fucking really opening up here. So let me stop doing that. All right. Uh, I think I'm a pretty good kid compared to, uh, the people. I know my grades aren't that good, but hey, I haven't gotten held back. Well as a positive way of looking at it. You got a D in math? Yeah. Did I stay back? Will I write then shut the fuck up. I'm 15 and I have an older brother, two years older and I have a younger brother, two years younger. Uh, the younger one is annoying. So if he starts bothering me, I say something to him telling him to stop. Um, oh, when I do that, I'm being a dick. What? I'm being a dick.

Speaker 9:          01:14:29       When I could just slap him or something and then he does the classic shit and screams like clockwork and my parents will come in and punish, make, oh yeah, dude, I've been there. I had three younger brothers. I've been there. Um, if he was bothering me first, Oh, if he, they punish you if he was even bothering you first, um, what, what you gotta do is you've got to muffle his voice with a pillow. Or you can go the opposite route is you can torch room by tickling them is basically you sit on their arms and you do the typewriter thing. You know what I mean? There's a lot of other ways to make, obviously the slap isn't going to work cause he knows he's going to get you in trouble that way. So you got to come up with creative ways to torture your younger brother.

Speaker 9:          01:15:09       Start with doing it when your parents aren't home. All right, why am I telling people to do this shit? All right. Uh, let me go and at some point they need to stop babying him instead of taking his side because he's the youngest. And then there's my somewhat perfect older brother who was always in the limelight. I admit, I'm jealous. I mean, he makes honor role plays football and works all at the same time and I'm just the fuck up in the middle. Why is it middle kid always feel fucking neglected I guess cause you're in the middle. I was so, you know, second oldest. I don't know where the fuck I was. Um, he has always been treated better than me. I'm his best friend got him in trouble for, for laying trash cans on fire back when he was in the seventh grade and my dad cursed him out and told him to never hang ultra cursed out the other kid and told him not to hang out with my older brother again.

Speaker 9:          01:16:02       Uh, what happens in the 12th grade? I'm there hanging out again and my parents don't say shit. I have a bad friend and I haven't even gotten in trouble with them, but my parents won't let me hang out with them. My parents let my older brother learned how to drive when he was 12 and I'm turning 16 and they haven't taught me shit. I probably won't get a damn license until I'm 25 then they treat me like shit. Last week I cleaned my bathroom and left, uh, my mini trash cans sitting outside the bathroom and instead of being glad they go eight, because I leave the trashcan outside the bedroom. Please tell me what you think about this situation. Uh, yeah. You're getting the middle child treatment, you're getting the middle child treatment and this is what I would say, beat up your younger brother when your parents aren't around or maybe break some of his shit when he's not in his room and a, your older brother, uh, you can cut the brake lines on his car.

Speaker 9:          01:16:58       Now I'm fucking with you. Um, uh, you know what? Fuck them. Fuck them. If they don't want to pay attention to you, fuck them. Just keep doing your thing. And I make a joke out of it. You know, you know you left a trashcan outside the bathroom. I know. What was I thinking? I should have been like my older brother and lit it on fire. You're absolutely right. At what point did you realize you were bored with me? Huh? When the newer version of me came along and then when she tries to interrupt, just be like, no dad, dad, I get it. You don't care. You don't, I'm the Middle Kid. What do you think? I don't want you to Brady bunch. I saw what Jen went through. I'm going through the same shit.

Speaker 9:          01:17:43       They bring up that shit about driving. Huh? How bad a driver was my older brother that you just decided not to teach any of us, you know, I dunno. Just go with that route. But you know, above all, don't take it personally. You just focus on your own life. You've got to understand, you're probably walking around in 15 you know, you know, you're at that age where you kind of think you know some shit, but you kind of know that you don't know a lot of other shit, that that feeling never goes away and your parents are walking around thinking the same shit. So, uh, don't take them too seriously. You know, unless they tell you, you know, not to do drugs or hanging out with that Douche bag, you probably shouldn't be hanging out with them. But you know what I mean? I don't, I don't have to tell you, dude.

Speaker 9:          01:18:24       It's like that's shit that you, you're going to get through. It gets better when you're in your twenties you know, and you never know. Your brother might have peaked that am so a lot of people, you know, if they get in fucking late in high school, like do you want to say how great your life is? If you're actually on the football team and you're fucking a cheerleader in high school, I mean, I don't know how you ever beat that. You have to become like a fucking movie star. Like there's nowhere for those people to go. That's why so many of those people, they, when they go out in the real world, they, they, they, they fail because they've always been, I mean, you're king of the world. You're on a football team. You're banging a cheerleader, right? You both in your teens, your bodies are in mint fucking condition and you don't have to pay rent.

Speaker 9:          01:19:13       And if you do some dumb shit, you still charged as a juvenile. I'm going to tell you right now, it's never going to get better than that. Okay? Are you going to go a long fucking way as an adult to make it better than that? Okay. So you know, I don't know if I'm cheering you up here, but you know it's been in the middle of being in that mix is not a bad fucking thing. Being in the middle of the herd. Cause then you can break out. You can try to figure out what you want to do and then the fact that people kind of Shit on you, you get a good sense of humor. You already wrote some funny shit. You'll be fine. You are fuck your older brother and your younger brother. What are you thinking about that? I know what to tell you, dude.

Speaker 9:          01:19:47       I just don't want to fuck you up dude. I don't, I don't, I don't have the background to give a 15 year old fucking advice. I really don't, but I, I hope I made some sort of sense, but don't take it too seriously. All right. You know what I would do? I would always clean the bathroom and always leave the trashcan out there just to deliberately annoy your parents and then act slightly retarded to the point that they actually think back to some drugs that they did when they were single. And that's why you're fucked up now, you know, do some shit like that. Just passive aggressive stuff. Started having fun with the fact that they don't pay attention to you. In other words, act out. That's what I'm trying to say. All right, so let's recap. Break your younger brother's shit. Cut The brake lines and your older brother's car.

Speaker 9:          01:20:27       Ignore your parents and act slightly retarded. All right, that's my advice. Um, oh, here's something for you. I got good. I wrote a, I got good feedback from a woman. I don't get this very often and said, hey bill, just wanted to comment on your response to the guy who got shot down at the sandwich shop a couple of weeks ago. That was a loaded question and for what it's worth from a female fan, I thought your answer was incredibly fair as well as funny. It is bullshit that men generally have the burden of approaching women. And I know that burned is asked to have her look at him like a Disgusting Chore, but just because She's pretty, doesn't mean she owes everybody. Whoever tits honor of fucking thank you card. I really appreciate your answer. You could have gone a much easier and shittier root. Thanks. Yeah, you mean like how he did with the 15 year old kids question.

Speaker 9:          01:21:19       All right. Every once in a while I get positive feedback feedback from a female, so I got to read it. All right, next one. I'm just going to read this like a book this week. People. I'm literally nodding off here. A as bill. Hey Bill. Uh, throughout my life, no matter what I've done, and I already read this already. Read this one, right? Jesus Christ. All right. Oh, here's some letters from people overseas, specifically England. This section's called English [inaudible]. Hey Bill. So you thought my last email wasn't good enough for your podcast. I hold no grudges. It's a recession and you want to keep it all American. Fairplay. So let's keep up the theme from your last one in attempt to get a mention, a shameless whoring of myself here. Uh, you say baseball jumped the shark. Let me tell you something. Coming from the nation that pretty much invent, invented all major sports except the Olympics.

Speaker 9:          01:22:11       Great Britain. You know, I like to consider myself knowledgeable about sports. Uh, exactly. What sports did you create? What sports did you create? Egan do the rugby thing and then rugby developed into football. I'll give you that one. That, that was the spawn of it. But you, you can't take credit for baseball. We're going can say that's cricket. You guys sit there with that fraternity paddle from some horrific night of hazing. You finally pulled it out of some freshmen's ass and now you're tried to hit a racket ball over to some guy from fucking India. Huh? What other sports have you guys invented? Basketball. You didn't invent that. I don't know what you guys invented, but you sure suck at all of them. You know, when's the last time you guys won a World Cup? You know what? That's a great fucking question. That's what you guys are known for soccer, right? And rugby.

Speaker 9:          01:23:08       Like when those douchebags over in England tried to, they always try to say that that foot football players are pussies because they were like helmets and that type of shit. And then you watch a rugby game. Those guys are tough. But those guys would be hitting each other a lot, fucking harder if they had pads on and shit. You know, I watched the game. Yeah. It's a bunch of guys fucking stick in their heads up each other's asses as they're kicking at a football. That's definitely, and I know, you know what's funny is I never disrespect rugby. I look at it like that. That's a tough sport and tough guys play that sport. I don't know why they always pick on football. I don't get it. You know what I mean? Dude, Ray Lewis would fuck up at least five of your rugby players by himself without pads. You got nobody in your fucking little pussy ass English rugby league that looks anything like Ray Lewis let ray Lewis would destroy him. Jack Lambert, once you bring them, bring me your famous fucking rugby guys and show me how those guys are hitting any harder than Lawrence Taylor. You're out of your fucking minds. How do you fucking minds? Let's look up England,

Speaker 9:          01:24:16       England. World Cup victory. I'm going to make a guess and I'm going to say it's, it's somewhere. It's gotta be the 1960s or before England World Cup victory. The World Cup victory by England. 1966. There you go. I fucking knew it. I knew it was going be back then. Like when the Celtics were winning all their championships, right? Was Brazil not allowed in back then? Fucking pattern. Your stats. Um, I'm just fucking with you guys. I respect your sports, but I, you know what, what are you pretty much adventure all major sports except the Olympics. Go Fuck Yourself. You guys didn't invent shit. You had a halfass idea that we made tremendous.

Speaker 9:          01:25:04       Is there any, you know what I mean? Like the greatest fucking soccer player of all time. He's, is he from England? It's Palae. The Michael Jordan of soccer is not even from England's. Why don't you guys dominate something on a world fucking level. I want what, what? What was the last time you guys had an athlete? Cause I'll tell you right now that good looking son of a bitch for the La Galaxy is not doing shit and nobody gives a fuck about him over here. You can walk up and buy a ticket. All right. I went to La Galaxy fucking game. I parked right next to the guy. I didn't even recognize him.

Speaker 9:          01:25:38       I asked him which way the fucking stadium was. The only reason why I knew he was on the fucking galaxies cause he already had his fucking cleats on. All right. He can't wait to go back there. Um, all right, the fuck Bob Beckham. All right, well let me, let me get back to this fucking thing. Ah, I think I come from some authority. Oh yeah. Once you pat yourself on the back a little more. Your English cont here we go. Baseball always fucking sucked. No it didn't. And I'll tell you why it's a game suited for America like no other hours of time to kill between meaningful play. Meaningful for some reason is two words, meaning full, like what is the meaning of the word? And I ate too much. Um, full, meaningful as one word. Get Dumb cunt. Take the last l off the full and smash them together. Jesus. I hope that's right. Her and I just made an ass out of myself. Uh, between meaningful, um, play. Allowing for re the required TV, advertising and selling of Shit. Overpriced food and poor beer. Oh Jesus Christ. Really? You don't have any advertising there? There's advertising all over the fizz advertising on the fucking ball in England. You know what? Maybe if you guys scored more than once every fucking 90 minutes.

Speaker 9:          01:26:56       You know what I mean? You could stick some commercials in there. Jesus Christ. The soccer is like hockey without the skates and the scoring and the fighting and everything. That makes it great. You ever see like a little sissy get tripped out and I don't know, during recess and he rolls around in the ground. It makes such a big fucking deal out of it. You want to beat him with his own books. That's what like watching soccer is like every five seconds. These guys, they look like if, if Pau Gasol, if you could have like whatever 20 Pau Gasol is all in the same fucking field, just bitch and Moan and with that crybaby fucking face, that's what soccer is. See what you did do it. I actually really enjoy the game, but you're attacking my shits and I get attack yours. Um, minimal athleticism required. Yeah, dude, really hitting a baseball is one of the hardest thing you do ever do.

Speaker 9:          01:27:48       Why don't you fucking brush your teeth and give it a chance. At some point you guys are swinging with that big fucking paddle. Okay. All right. Let me go. You know, I would never make fun of the bicycle kick and act like that's a simple thing to do anyways. And before you come up with this stock, we'd like to see you face a hundred mile an hour curve. I just did that. That's hilarious. From insert drugged up goon here and then talk that shit. It's a game. Not a sport. Like bowling is a game now. It isn't. I can, I can see a bowling's a game. It's just you standing there. If somebody was throwing the bowling ball at your head at a hundred miles an hour and it was fucking changing speeds, then that would be a sport. Okay. Or if he just held the ball like tee ball, you just hit it off the stand.

Speaker 9:          01:28:41       Then it would just be, that would just be a game. I don't know. Athletes, athletes or people who actually move around for the majority of the sport, cyclists, rowers, even soccer players cover around 10 k per game. Oh God. Really? Is that why they were all built like women? You know what your athletes look in fucking England. They look like mannequins at the gap. You know? I know we're fed over here, but we're more muscular to you fucking pansies over there with your poor nutrition in your nationwide healthcare plan. Why don't you get some fucking protein in your diets? The skinny ass fucking arms and your little legs running around, not being able to, you know why you can't use your fucking hands and soccer cause you fags would break your risks. All right. That was homophobic. Sorry about that. Didn't mean to say fag. Sorry. Just get worked up. Anyways, let's come. Let's finish this. The game comes from an old English game of rounders, which was by and large a game of women. The fuck is he talking about now? You know, I don't even give a shit anymore.

Speaker 9:          01:29:44       Whilst me, we, me were, while the real me, we're playing rugby and football. What? Oh, Jesus Christ. You're trying to say baseball was made up by a woman as how he trying to say, you know what, I love. Everybody acts like they fucking hate America and they can't stop paying attention to us. I don't listen to any English douchebags podcast. You know, I don't know a fucking thing. All I know Tony Blair, Tony Blair bitched up and fucking sent you guys, you know, got you guys into fucking Iraq too. Cause he didn't have any balls. You know why? Because he plays soccer. Wow. That was really fucking me. Alright. Underrated checkout. This Scottish comedian, Frankie Boyle, very dark but funny. Scottish guys are fucking hilarious. Um, I look forward to your [inaudible] reply and if I do get past your filtering process, fucking up reading this out loud. Well, I did all of that.

Speaker 9:          01:30:39       I don't have any filtering process. I read all of these God damn things. I have nothing better to do. Where are we in this podcast? 44 fucking minutes. All right, let's get to some overrated, underrated. Um, what the fuck are we going? All right. Overrated. Uh, okay. Overrated drummer Neil Peart. Now, before all the prog rock tech heads, start quoting modern drummer here me out. We've had the technology since the 1960s to program a computer to play poly rhythmic beats. Try having garage band play Elvin Jones or Rashied Ali. I don't know who that is. Um, dude, you can't say that man. Those are different kinds of drums. Although I'm not really into Neil Peart. I'm not until, I think he's, I don't know. He's just too fucking on the beat. He sounds like a robot. He's fucking amazing. But uh, I like, I dunno, I think people either like John Bonham.

Speaker 9:          01:31:35       Oh, you like Neil Peart. You know what I mean? Nobody gives a fuck. They're not drummers. All right. Um, I think that's it. I think that's going to be it for the podcast as I'm fucking trying to get a Gig in England. I just fucking trashed everybody over there. I'm just, you know, everybody just fucking trashed and American non fucking stop now. And then you go to their countries and you know, you see fat fucks, you see losers. I don't know what they're bragging about. I really don't. They talk about how amazing their beer is. I got to MIT, I went to Sweden, they did as some good beers, man. Couple of beers from uh, actually had one from Czechoslovakia, some checks, some shit that doesn't even exist anymore. The Czech Republic, whatever the fuck it is. I don't know. That's another thing that bugs me about Europeans.

Speaker 9:          01:32:23       They think they're so fucking worldly cause they know all about Europe and shit and it's like Europe is like basically the size of half of America. So if you know something about the state next to you that's the same as like somebody from England, no one about France. I mean he can fucking drive there at this point. It's really not impressive, but it is beautiful over there. Whatever. Hitler didn't bomb bomb and is still left standing is very nice. Um, all right. I was a little country this week just cause I was tired. Uh, blame it on that. Um, and I think that's it. I think that's all that I have to say this week. Uh, I just want to thank everybody for the tremendous turnout, the tremendous turnout in Philadelphia. I actually had to stay an extra day and add a show. That was awesome. Um, let me hide my show's coming up and a don't you?

Speaker 9:          01:33:09       English cons get all pissed off of what the fuck I say because I don't even read half the shit that you guys. Right. You know, calling me up, telling me if I talk about American sports, it's boring as if I give a flying fuck, you know. All right, let me get to my website. He obviously I give a fuck. I'm bringing it up. Um, and I also, if you, if you're just trying to write shit to Piss me off, it's going to work because I have to respond to everything because I have that disease where I have to make my point. Um, all right, let's get to the, uh, what I got coming up, not this weekend. Next weekend I'm going to be at the Improv in Addison, Texas. Uh, September 24th, 25th, 26th. And I'm also the Sunday. Is that the 27th? I think I added the day cause I'm hanging around going to the cowboys game.

Speaker 9:          01:33:59       Let me see here. Uh, checking out the calendar. Yeah. And the 27th, I'll be there Thursday through Sunday. We added a Sunday show. I'm going to be there. God Damn, it's to bring your friends down and I'll see it, the cowboy's game on Monday. Then on, um, October 2nd, third and fourth, I'm going to be at the stress factory in New Brunswick, New Jersey. And uh, the following weekend I'll be at the Improv and Pittsburgh and all the rest of my dates are up. My website. I want to thank everybody for a, all the great support. I've really had a tremendous last couple of gigs here, you know, going to Atlanta over to Stockholm, Sweden, and then down to Philadelphia. Really tremendous turnout. I really appreciate it. And, uh, all you guys basically out there asking me when I'm going to come to your country, you know, Australia, New Zealand, I'm working on that shit.

Speaker 9:          01:34:48       I'm going to try to put some, uh, youtube videos up on a, I discovered when I was in Stockholm, Sweden, that youtube, you know, there's like literally just like Wikipedia, you know what I mean? There's all kinds of different youtube. So I just stuck with the English one because I'm a fucking American surrounded by people speaking English and water. But, uh, I'm gonna try to get some shit up on maybe the Australian one, the England English one or whatever. I guess evidently that's a way to build a following over there. So hopefully I can travel over there and maybe I'll check out some of your sporting events and maybe I'll change my opinions, but she knows something. I would be way more open to enjoying sports from England or someplace else. If you could just tell me about them without fucking trashing [inaudible],

Speaker 9:          01:35:32       you know, American sports first. If you just want to hear me flip out, then by all means, continue what you're doing because it's working. All right? But, uh, you know, hey, no disrespect to your troops that went over to Iraq too. You know, I just wanna make sure I didn't get a little out of hand there. All right. This is all jokes, so don't send me any fucking hate mail. All right. That's the money Moni podcast for this week. Thank you everybody for listening. And, uh, I know there was one other fucking thing I didn't get to. Maybe I'll get to it next week. That's it. That's it for the pot

Speaker 6:          01:36:01       cast. Everybody have a great weekend. I'm fucking.
