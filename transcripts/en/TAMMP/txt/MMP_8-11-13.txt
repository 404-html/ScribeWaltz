Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Two three. Yeah, my name on it.

Speaker 2:          00:00:13       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burr and it's the Monday morning podcast for August 12th, 2013. How you doing? How'd you like that intro? Wasn't that pretty cool? That was actually, you probably go on the whole, who were those fine singers?

Speaker 3:          00:00:28       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:00:29       Jesus Christ. That was the, that just human beings doing that by themselves. No auto tune was Kanye West. Dot. In there with a leather fucking skirt on singing about getting his Dick Schaap despite the fact he just had a baby daughter. Um, uh, fuck. One of my ears is ringing. I hate when this happens. Does anybody else have hearing damage?

Speaker 3:          00:00:51       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:00:51       come on. Stop ringing. Um, every once in a while one of my ears just goes, Woo.

Speaker 4:          00:00:59       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:00:59       And then it fucking, you know, like some heavy metal singer from fucking decades ago.

Speaker 2:          00:01:06       Like say, remember your childhood, you acid wash jeans. Anyways, that was the, uh, members of a truth, that salvage company. Um, I got to know those guys. Uh Oh, it's getting no, through Busan. I met Deb drama, Bill Smith. I was out on a drunken night and he came over to me and he said, hey, hey, my name is bill also. Why don't you tone it down? You freckled cunt. And I had to respect them. No, I'm kidding. Um, they have a new album out called a pick me up that's available on iTunes and a new single called Appalachian hilltop. If you actually like human beings, if you like, if you'd like, yeah, if you'd like some sort of heartbeat in like your music at this point, you know, not saying that you guys out there on your designer drugs, eating each other's faces, watching some guy with a mouse head and your glow sticks is not a good time. You know, if I got sucked into heavy metal, you know, when I, when I was, uh, coming up in the 80s, if I was coming up now, I would fucking by probably be there.

Speaker 2:          00:02:07       I definitely would be. I'd sit dead jumping up and down in unison is that guy played his stereo, some club. Um, am I doing the thing that all old people do? I get fearful and I'm just trashing all the new stuff. I was reading something recently when, um, when airplanes first came out, actually, believe it or not, people sometimes I do read and I was reading this book about when airplanes first came out and, uh, this guy was pitching, we basically all we had, we had like, we had the army and the navy and that was it. And this somebody in one of those branches, cause I already fucking forget because every other word reminds me of something in my life. And I just start thinking, you know, Tom Sawyer got on a boat. I remember I got on a boat. Yeah. Maybe that digging in that Kid's pool party. And I flipped over and I got underneath and then my eyes keep going and like six pages go by and I have no fucking idea what I read. Um, so I don't, can't remember the guy's fucking name. And I think we just had an army and a navy

Speaker 2:          00:03:11       at this point. And this was, I know in the, in the teens, maybe the twenties of law, I'll just say last century as opposed to people try to confuse you and go the 20th century,

Speaker 3:          00:03:22       you know,

Speaker 2:          00:03:24       the 18th century, 18 hundreds was the 19th century. You got to do that. Fucking carry the one shit last century.

Speaker 3:          00:03:31       All right.

Speaker 2:          00:03:33       And he, he basically said to the army and the navy, he was like, hey man, like these planes, man, they're going to like change shit. And like, I don't know if you guys are going to be ready for it man. And all the old guard were like, Rah Rah, go fuck yourself if you got them Kleenex and your dental floss and your little lawn mower motor that you have in that thing and engine, right? Fuck you. What are you going to do to make my iron sides over here? So he's like, well listen man, like I don't really want to take it to that level, but why don't you pull one of your bad ass boats out? Damn. We'll bring her fucking planes over. See what happens. So they said, all right, so this sitting there laughing at him and shit and they got this fucking thing that's like sixth, I don't know. It's really thick and it's really hard to sick and they keep an AP little lawnmower fucking engines and they sank the fucker in like 12 minutes and there was actually navy admirals crying.

Speaker 3:          00:04:32       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:04:33       they couldn't believe it. Um, they were out of a fucking job. They thought. So anyways, is that what I'm doing when it comes to like dubstep boy, that shit like I guess I should be into it. I Dunno. I like these guys. Truth and salvage company. I, I, they have my stamp of approval. If it means anything. I saw them when they opened a for the black Crowes where the fuck were we? Somewhere in La. I don't know what. So I don't know if you like that kind of music. Give these guys a shot. If you're into other kinds of music, just keep listening to that shit. I don't give a fuck, but I don't need to hear your fucking reviews of it. Okay. I'm just suggesting this is our defenses being on Twitter makes you, because no matter what you suggest, you could just say something simply, simply like, you know, ice cream is delicious and then you will curry flavor. You get it all that she will, you know, the fucking someones inverted it, you know, and he's got to deal with these fucking cunts then as it's coming from a con. All right, so whatever.

Speaker 2:          00:05:42       I feel bad cause I only mentioned Bill Smith and a band and I probably just fucking created a bunch of infighting in their van. Right? If you're in a fucking band, you got to be riding around in an event, don't you? Isn't that how it works? Um, anyways, let's plow ahead. Shall we people I am, I am still here in New Orleans. As you can tell the quality of this podcast, the audio, the audio, at the very least, okay. Is A, is much better than last week's because the lovely Nia I actually sent out my bow is strip or the chord, whatever the fuck you call it. And um, so at least she can hear me. At least you can hear the attempts, you can hear the big swing and a miss. And I gotta tell you something. I actually was actually rooting for Alex Rodrigues this week. You know, I really was not because I liked the guy that cause I'm all of a sudden a fucking Yankee Fan. The bed bath and beyond of the major league baseball community. Um, I just really yeah, the uniforms look like towels. Very nice towels, but towels nonetheless.

Speaker 5:          00:06:54       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:06:54       I'm sorry I'm drinking some water here. I burned my tongue. Isn't that the fucking worst? I actually, I ordered room service. I got a grilled cheese and tomato soup as old people do. And um,

Speaker 2:          00:07:07       I uncovered the tomato soup, which was way too fucking hot and I had the grilled cheese there. So I'm an American. I can't just eat the grilled cheese. I've got to take that grilled cheese and I got a Dunkin into the fucking piping hot tomato soup, so I stick it in my fucking pie hole. Big Bite of that shit. It's a lava hot. So what do I do? I use my brain, my brain says, hey bill, that's like a, you're not gonna have much tongue left if we don't do something about this. How about grabbing some Colt? So my right hand was like, oh, I got this and reached over to that nice ice cold glass of water. But the, the, they had plastic on top of its cellophane so it wouldn't spill when the lovely brought it up to the room. So my right hand's like, you know, this ain't going to fucking work. And then the rest of my body went into panic mode and I went boom. And I just spit out, spit it out instantly. I thought it was actually a smart move, but I immediately started laughing thinking that that would have been the greatest vine ever or one of a nice one anyways

Speaker 2:          00:08:12       is a bill burr each burns tongue is that it was, you know, can you actually do a vine where it's actually just one thing. It's not a bunch of Shit splice together. Actually, I know what the fuck I'm talking about. I'm just saying it burned my God damn tongue. All right. People just trying to tell the story.

Speaker 2:          00:08:29       A fucking puke that thing out. Like, like you have a see a snake when it's in the middle of eating and all of a sudden you walk up to it and it's like, oh fuck, I think I'm going to get eaten. And then it's just sorta opens his mouth in that Yak comes out of it. And then the snakes sitting there like, now what's up? Huh? You want to do this? Um, basically walking up to a snake while it's eating is like what happened to me when I went to that buffalo bills game with my patriots hat on. And they waited till I was taking a piss. All right. With my Johnson out. And then they pushed me in the back. Cause that's what they do up there in the city of lights. Other than eating the fucking wings and losing Superbowls, they wait til you get your dick out in Buffalo. Don't ever forget that. All right? So when you go up there to the falls over there in Niagara, all right? And all of a sudden you get that sensation that you've gotta take a piss looking at all those. Just know, just know that the great grandson of Joe [inaudible] or whatever the fuck you said his name.

Speaker 5:          00:09:31       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:09:32       You know Fred smartlist junior, my fucking pushed you in the back is all I'm saying. All right. Not trying to cause any static with that great city.

Speaker 5:          00:09:43       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:09:44       Formerly great city, that city that will rise again like Cleveland, like Detroit, like de Moines. Um, that'd be tell you guys how much I love those cities. I like, I'm a fan of architecture and when I go there I always just look at, I'm like this eventually this fucking place is going to blow up in a good way. I mean that in a hip hop kind of way. Look at me, look at me straddling the fence of my whiteness. Um, this is another sign that I'm getting old. I have a real problem with that new Kanye West album that, you know, cause I want to settle down and be a fucking parrot and all that type of shit. So I look up to other people that finally fucking do it and I'm thinking, Whoa, is this guy going to, you know, it's easy going to be changed somehow with this new fucking album. And it's just still talking about losing his diamond ring in some girls snatched. Isn't that what it's all about?

Speaker 5:          00:10:42       I Dunno.

Speaker 2:          00:10:45       Sometimes I glad I looked the way I look and I was never able to enter the club scene other than to be ushered quickly back out the side door. Um, anyways, what are we talking about here? This is the Monday morning podcast and um, IOP having a nice August. The summer's coming to a close, but you know, this is the golden age of global warming waters. A little warmer. It's just starting to tickle your toes, but you don't have to worry about getting eaten by a shark yet and you fucking living room. So, you know, I think you might get an extra three weeks, three weeks of the summer.

Speaker 5:          00:11:23       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:11:23       You know, what's the greatest is the football season is starting and you know, I've become a huge college football fan over the is. And a, I actually realized that my Lsu Tigers, my adopted. Okay. Before anybody bet rouge gets mad at me. Like, man, you ain't from prepare you I from air. Nope. They Call Him York targeted our targets. Um, cause that's what everyone in the south sounds like to me.

Speaker 5:          00:11:48       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:11:48       All right. Whether you do or you don't, you do in between ringing ears. Evidently they're starting their season and their guests who they're playing, guess who's back in my life. They're playing. They're playing those jackasses on the kickoff day. I know Alabama's playing somebody else. Uh, I don't know who the fuck their plan. Alabama. Can you believe those? You see what those cuts did this week? You see what they did to fuck in the Aggies, you know that came from them. That horse shit about Johnny Manzel sign and Shit. You know that came from an Alabama booster. You know what did you know it, you know why? You know, I think it came from them cause they're fucking scared. They're scared that skin that's skinny motherfucker is going to run all around the field like the white Michael Vick. Alright. And he's going to fucking beat their ass as again. I actually saw the replay, the end of the game last year, where a Jesus Christ, you never saw sadder looking faces when they cut to the stands after that interception, right down there in the end zone.

Speaker 2:          00:13:01       Tremendous. Oh, look at that. I'm looking out on the Mississippi River that goes a paddle boat. Whether it was Tom Sawyer once, you know, way back in the day when food was fresh and everybody was dropping the n word, every other word, right? We will exterminate the Indians. Oh, what a beautiful piece of history. Um, all right, what am I doing here? Is it time to do a little, a little advertising? Would you say? Well, I don't give a shit.

We all started this comedy network called all things comedy. Um, just cause you know we saw podcast blowing up in artists always create scenes and then they never end up with the money. The business man comes in and a, we own your podcast and we get all the money and you get great exposure. Go Fuck Yourself, have fun and behind the podcast music on VH one. So we created like a co op where everybody owns this shit.

All right. Back to the God damn podcast. Um, so anyways, uh, the past couple of weeks I've been talking about the food down here in New Orleans saying how delicious slash unhealthy it is and how you can't find fucking Kale, excuse me, as a drink, more cold water for my fucking scalded tongue, blah. Um, I actually bought a juicer this week to somehow combat all the fried food that I've been eating. And a, I started drinking that shit that, that guy and uh, uh, fat dead and kind of sick, whatever the fuck is called, fat sick and nearly dead.

Speaker 3:          00:19:42       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:19:43       Just sick, fatty with dead fucking something, whatever. Um, I've been drinking that Shit, man. I gotta tell you something that's delicious. Not only is delicious, you crave it after awhile and uh,

Speaker 3:          00:19:57       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:19:58       Yeah, I think I dropped like four or five pounds. Good pounds too. You know the flabby once I was joking on Twitter saying how I was in, I was in buttoned down shirt shape and I actually want to get into like, I want to be in shitting down no shirt on shape.

Speaker 3:          00:20:18       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:20:18       I Dunno what, I know bill Cosby did a bit on this, but he's, so what the fuck happens when you sit down? You stand up and look sideways and Mariella Guy, you know what? That is a bad, dare I say it's kind of cue shows that I like the occasional snickers. Right. And you should, they're pitching it yourself like you're in an old, old school, special k commercial going on. Right. That's not that bad. It's not that bad. Then you just sit down and like three of shit just lands on your thighs.

Speaker 5:          00:20:51       You know,

Speaker 2:          00:20:54       for the life of me, I can't, what is, what happens? The hip bones move up to your fucking man tits and everything just gets blown out. I have no idea. But sitting down without a shirt on, you know, that's, that's the truth moment of your fucking physique that you're going to see all day. Stop standing up, sucking in your gut. All right? You want to see, you want to see the damage you've done. Maybe you're not ready for

Speaker 5:          00:21:20       all right.

Speaker 2:          00:21:21       This is like the ring. When you looked at that fucking chick's face, you judges opens up and you land in a fucking walk in closet. Oh my God. I don't know what happened to me. I'm not even that bad a shape. So I said, fuck this. I got a juicer. And um, I just did a quick gig up in Chicago, came right back, this private thing. Um, so I don't know. I ate halfway decent up there. I did find a Vegan restaurant, but then of course they had had some Chicago Pizza. Um,

Speaker 5:          00:21:53       yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:21:54       So now I came back and I had my little fucking grilled cheese sandwich and tomato soup. So now my body is starting to pull me back to the, to the bay, the dark side. And that's what I've really learned about trying to stay in shape. It's all about keeping your brain out in front of your body.

Speaker 5:          00:22:15       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:22:16       Keeping your fucking wits about you.

Speaker 5:          00:22:18       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:22:19       Like this shit, it's like food. You don't, when they need to say food is a drug, I didn't believe him, but I, I'm totally convinced of it now. It's like when you're reading bad, when you just go on like a three month bender have just eaten bad and in your head like, Oh God, I got to stop by of fucking cheeseburger and you just keep going and then that makes you want cookies and all that type of shit. It's the food equivalent to like locking yourself in a Roman just free basic for three months. That's what you doing. So when I tried to do, when I'm eating, eating bad like this, I just talked to a buddy of mine outside of the business who's trying to lose some fucking wait. I was trying to tell him that like you gotta keep your head out in front of it and just go like, I want that, but I'm going to eat this. Even the in, in, in that moment when you're looking at that apple as opposed to that fucking glorious, whatever you're looking at, right? Toasted roast beef and cheese with the fucking pickles and the chips and all that. The last thing your body's like, that's fine. Just what the fuck I want. And you got to reach for that apple.

Speaker 2:          00:23:27       You got to fucking hit that, that crack pipe instead. And I'm telling you the second you get two, three bites in, you're like, oh thank God, thank God I did that. Then you fight cause so from what I've, what I've read the braid little, I've read your body is actually craving nutrition.

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       You know,

Speaker 2:          00:23:48       that's why we eat Chinese food. Like fucking 35 minutes later, you're hungry again because your body's still craving nutrition. There wasn't like a fucking ounce of it in that shit, at the risk of getting sued by that entire fucking continent of China country. Go Fuck Yourself. Um, so that's what I would say

Speaker 2:          00:24:10       if you could try to do, that's what I'm trying to do as I'm trying to keep my head out in front of us. So I got that grilled cheese sandwich and I got to tomato soup and I said, all right, I gotta get back on the fucking Green Gumbo here is, I'm calling it because I'm in New Orleans and uh, that's it. I'm back on that shit for the last two tomorrow morning to wake up and make another one. Bingo. Bango I'm trying to do two a day. Jewson and then one day having the fucking, uh, you know, a healthy dinner and then I'd go on the treadmill for a half hour. There's no fucking way you're not going to drop away. All right, so there you go. So stop doing those stupid ass fad diets. EA. It's the fucking cornflakes died. Oh, I do it. He could plagues. They can eat as much as I wanted. That bullshit veggie eventually.

Speaker 3:          00:24:56       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:24:57       You don't really, I think the really, it really is, is not even like, it's not even the fucking diet. It's the, once you get to your weight, what do you do then? You know, once you get down to your weight, at some point you're going to be looking around. It's like he got out of jail and there's some ice cream right over there. You're an adult. You don't have to go more. Right? That's how you become a fat fuck as an adult. There's no one to say you had enough cookies. So on you fair enough. Boots put on a condom. It's all on you. You gotta be your own fucking parent until you get a lady and your life. And then she starts fucking nagging at you. [inaudible] get out the rug ass. Fuck you lady. Where did you become so angry? Um, so that would be my advice when you're just on, if right now, if you listen to this shit and you're on a bad fucking road, I'm telling you one of these days in the future, you're going to wake up, you're going to be sitting down on the side of your bed, you're going to glance it to a mirror and you're going to be like, what the fuck? What have I done to myself? You just stand up real quick. You can try to suck it in and try to deny the truth that you just saw.

Speaker 2:          00:26:20       Hear that? That's the steam engine coming back on the fucking racist genocide. One Oh one. Um, the fuck am I to, yeah, just make yourself eat an apple or just eat a fucking salad. You gotta you gotta turn that you've got to turn the boat around.

Speaker 3:          00:26:38       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:26:38       That's what I'm trying to do.

Speaker 2:          00:26:41       I've got to do what I fucking went back up to like almost a buck 90 and now back down to like the mid one seventies. I got to the fucking worst. Just trying to lose like 15 pounds is the fucking worst. I can't imagine people who got, uh, got to lose more than that. So, uh, you know, I don't, I don't know how this became more of a weight loss podcast. Um, but I think it's working enough. This guy actually sent me a letter. He said, uh, podcast success story, Dear Wilbur, you sir are a god amongst men. Ah, Jesus, I wish that was true. He goes, I used to be a depressed piece of shit. You're a, your typical, the world is against me. Nobody likes me. Nobody wants me fucking moron. That's who I was. But your advice on stepping back and making fun of every negative annotation I have. Is that a word? Did he write that

Speaker 2:          00:27:33       d type that correctly? Or My homeboy annotation, I dunno not to make you depressed again. I don't know how to spell. Um, he goes, I have fucking change my life. I'm 80 pounds lighter. I got a great girl and I've gotten two count them two promotions. You're a comedian. You're not obligated to be Oprah. Amaury but you still make a difference. Thank you, sir, for knocking me back into cohesion. Uh, you probably make 20 times more than me. I doubt that sir, with the two big promotions there. Um, but I know, but I owe you a drink next time I see you. And if you're in Canada or being town, you stay classy, sir. Wow, that's great. Good for you sir. Look at that. He turned it around somehow. My negative, whatever the fuck my shaming, my fat shame. My for shame has been working. Um, all right, enough about that shit. So that's what I'm doing. I'm drinking the, I'm, I'm doing that fat, sick and nearly dead juicing thing and it's like all green stuff. It's Kale, celery, a couple of handfuls of parsley, cucumber, Zucchini, and then alignment to take the bitterness out. And uh, I get tell you it's fucking delicious. I love it. And um,

Speaker 2:          00:28:52       I dunno, I think I'm going to incorporate this in every couple of months. Just go back to that. Well, just juice for like four or five days just so I stay out in front of it just so I don't have to have sit down one day and have that fucking beach ball. I got a thing on my button down shirts. It's the one, two third button down. When that button's starts to look like it's doing the iron cross between both sides of my shirt. That's an amazing guy. He fucking jerk off. All right. And then what happens is they lay off the beer and then I just start slamming whiskey. Like that's my initial when I've, we've begun our initial defendant until our dieting is, I go from drinking Pale Ales to whiskey. I really am a freckled mess. All right. Um, so anyways, I had a lot of downtime last week. Um, I wasn't working. I had a couple of days off from my episode of Glee. Um, it's really long episode. You, I can't believe how long the film in this book. You know, I guess this is how they do it over there. I'm to sell a hell of a budget.

Speaker 6:          00:29:58       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:30:00       I got into one on Netflix and I started watching a Ken Burns the war. I know. I'm like, that came out like five, six years ago. If you haven't seen it, if you like me and you late to the party dude, like that's my recommendation for the week. It's a seven potter on World War II. Each one's is about an hour and 50 minutes long. And I know that sounds like I just told you to watch every episode of lost.

Speaker 6:          00:30:25       Um, just,

Speaker 2:          00:30:29       it's effortless to watch this thing other than the amount of times you have to hit pause and go, Jesus Christ, I haven't done shit with my life. That's what, that's what it makes me feel like. I can't,

Speaker 5:          00:30:41       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:30:42       I can't even begin to, uh, you gotta you just gotta watch it. You've got to watch it. And what's great is it really ties the whole war together. Where for me, I've always seen like, they'll always do stuff on it, on the history channel that there'll be talking about the war in the Pacific or they'll talk about the blitzkrieg or they'll talk about d day and occasionally they'll talk about northern Africa, but this thing kind of goes in chronological order of the whole damn thing. And um,

Speaker 5:          00:31:16       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:31:16       It's, it's, I don't know. I can't explain it. It would be like, what the fuck was that movie that they showed and it showed it backwards and the guy tattooed shit on his arm. I can't remember what the fuck it was. It's like finally seeing that thing going forwards.

Speaker 6:          00:31:32       Um, it's just,

Speaker 2:          00:31:35       it's unfucking real what? Jesus, I'm too stupid to fucking just go. Just go watch the God damn thing. Why don't you people 17 years old lying saying they're 18 and just going out on the front lines and just listening to these fucking Bob's whistle again, seeing all your friends getting blown up and just, just having to resign to fate while this one's either going to hit me over it. It isn't, and I'm still going to be fucking shooting at these guys.

Speaker 6:          00:32:01       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:32:04       They, that the stories that they see, they talk about that, that the guys who were flying over on the bombardiers before they had the escorts and Shit and you had to do 25 fucking missions before, you know, you had basically completed your obligation and nobody had ever made it past 14. It's a fucking suicide mission. And, uh, they had a guy who actually survived the ship because he was in that little fucking skylight at the bottom of the plane and he got shot the fucking arm and went through him and killed one of his buddies and I don't he, and then he still went back, flew another one and got shot again. And that's the thing that I, that basically saved him was because he kept getting shot

Speaker 5:          00:32:44       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:32:44       That he wasn't physically well enough to go back up in the God damn plane again. And you know, and I actually have the fucking nerve to be afraid of flying. I'm landing in fucking El Paso, Texas going, oh Geez, oh gee, there's nobody shooting at us. I never felt like such a fucking pussy in my life till, I mean, I feel bad enough when I watched like a UFC event, you know, or I watched one of those, uh, the one of those shows about going to prison, you know, I, I watched the training for UFC and I would be like that the I three times kicking that, that heavy bag with my leg, it would be all bruised up and I'd be like, it stinks. I want to get out of here. It just, can I be the guy who washes the tee shirts? Can I mop up the mat? The Mat that you guys wrestle on, you know?

Speaker 5:          00:33:38       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:33:39       I Dunno. He just, whatever. Ken Burns the war and he's done a whole bunch of documentaries and now he's doing one right now that is, uh, that's about the Vietnam War. Now I'm all paranoid that I said his name wrong. You know, all of a sudden that sounded like some guy in Espn, but that's Candy Maine, right? Yeah. Ken Birch. There we go. All right. I've got the right guy. All right. He's the one writing one right now. He's, uh, making one right now on the Vietnam War, which I'm definitely gonna Watch. You know, he already made one on the civil war, so I'm like, I'm going gonna fucking watch all of these things. And then, uh, I dunno, six months later I'll forget most of it. I'll probably combine a couple, two or three wars. I'll get drunk and I'll just start spewing out information about Lincoln speaking in a, he would Jima. All right. Anyway, let's get on with the podcast. Highly recommend that if you, uh, if you get a chance, if you have seven hours to kill, I highly recommend that if you have chicken pox, it'd be a great way to, uh, forget about the itching for a good seven hours. Um,

Speaker 5:          00:34:43       yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:34:44       What else? Oh, tonight. Oh, last night.

Speaker 5:          00:34:47       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:34:48       This is weird because I'm taping this on Sunday. Um, right now I'm taping this Sunday afternoon, New Orleans time and uh, I'm actually really excited obviously because, uh, the season five, I guess the second has of seasons, season five, the breaking bad premiers tonight. Did I start like 12 sentences there? Let me try that again. These seasoned, the second half of the season five series premiere of breaking bad starts tonight.

Speaker 5:          00:35:20       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:35:20       Do you guys ever wonder why it never became a game show host is cheesy as I am. Or like ever like hosted the family feud or was standing next to Billy Bush [inaudible] like they have to read stuff.

Speaker 5:          00:35:33       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:35:34       You know, I know I have the head to be on. I don't have the hairline, but I do have the head, you know, I fuck it. Who gives a shit anyways, breaking bad. It's coming back tonight and I can't fucking wait. I thought there was only five episodes. It's just fun. What? There's eight. So I'm psyched about that. And um, I've already, I think I've already gotten past the sadness that it's ending and I'm just talking as a fan. Forget about the fact that I used to, you know, get in there every once in a while. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:36:05       yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:36:06       I can't wait for this thing to come out on box set and, uh, and just go back and just go through that whole thing again.

Speaker 6:          00:36:17       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:36:18       A couple of months back, I actually watched the first two episodes of breaking bad and just seeing, you know, Cranston's character, Walter White has the hair and he's just meeting, uh, Jesse for the first time. Do you know, I heard, I don't know if this true, but I heard that Jesse was actually, that character was gonna. They were gonna have him killed in the first few, but he was such a good actor, uh, Aaron Paul that they are, and they liked the character so much. I don't know if that's true. I should stop fucking making up shit. I think I remember reading this. Like what, why would you do that bill? Why would you, it's one of the few bridges you can actually cross in this business and now you're going to burn it by putting out misinformation. What the fuck is wrong with you? Um, anyways, I was, I was somewhere at killing time. Oh, yesterday when I was in Chicago.

Speaker 3:          00:37:07       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:37:08       And I was a in the hotel and they had a marathon on of those doomsday preppers

Speaker 6:          00:37:14       and uh,

Speaker 2:          00:37:17       they're all fucked. Do you know why all those doomsday preppers are fucked is because they're loners. They might survive some initial shit. They might last a month, they might last a year, but they're just, instead of ripping the bandaid off like me and just getting fucking, you know, bludgeoned to death within the first 24 hours

Speaker 2:          00:37:46       or vaporized from something blowing up that that's, that's my doom state plan. My Dooms Day prepping that I do is that I live in probably the most dangerous city that you could possibly live in as far as earthquakes, as far as the water supply, as far as the fucking inability to get the fuck out of there. I really should get a helicopter license and tried to go on Ebay and buy some fucking use chopper. Cause other than that I'm fucked. But there's, there's a, there's a piece that you gain from just being completely fucked is you just saying, what am I going to do?

Speaker 3:          00:38:24       I'm fucked. All right.

Speaker 2:          00:38:28       Oh, I get a great idea. I'm going to sell a doomsday prepper,

Speaker 6:          00:38:34       um, kit

Speaker 2:          00:38:37       for people who don't want to prep and what it's going to be. It's going to be a beautiful locket that you where they'll have a mail once, a little more masculine, like put some spikes on it or some shit for male or female and when you open it up, there's one little cyanide pill in there. There you go. You just off yourself. That's all it is collapsing. There's fighting in the street. You just pop it in there and that's it. It's over.

Speaker 6:          00:39:06       You know

Speaker 2:          00:39:07       you want to live in beyond dead body patrol going out there with the fucking scheme as gone, having a barrier, all those cuts before they give out disease because that's what you're going to be doing if you survive. If you're a low level human like myself where you're really not bringing anything to the table, if they let you survive, if they decide out of the fucking glue to let you survive, that's what you're going to be all that's going to be your first fucking jobs.

Speaker 6:          00:39:35       Okay?

Speaker 2:          00:39:36       Other than getting naked and have him throw the fucking lie all over here, whatever they fucked Lyme, is that what they throw it? Lie, lie Ma. You got to get rid of the body lice, your job, you're going to go out there and some sort of Tarzan fucking bikini bottoms with that powdered sugar all over you. And you're going to just start, you're going to up,

Speaker 6:          00:39:57       it's gonna be yet.

Speaker 2:          00:39:59       So my suggestion is either get some cyanide or learn how to use operate a backhoe cause other than that, if you survive, you're going to be standing there with a shovel getting a fucking sunburn that, uh, the, the, the, the modern world has never seen.

Speaker 6:          00:40:14       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:40:15       Anyways, I'm watching this, this doomsday prepper thing and uh, they got all these guys doing this shit and they got this one dude who's just, you know, he's got like fucking three years worth of shit. He's got flat screen TVs, got all his fucking stuff down. So I love the flat screen TV. That's hilarious to me. Like it's the end of the world, but somehow cable still exists. Somehow somebody is at the head of the cables, cables central, wherever that is, flipping the switch so you can see the final eight episodes of breaking bad. Um, despite the fast, everybody connected with Hollywood is now gone. Um,

Speaker 6:          00:40:57       yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:40:58       Except for Wesley Snipes. I'm sure he's got a bunker somewhere. Um, yeah, if you've got the Ballston and I pigged the government taxes, you definitely got you got, you have a strategy in place and plus just even if that shit, even if he didn't take martial arts, just the sword swinging alone, that he had to learn the choreography that would scare the fuck out of most zombies and they turned the other way. Right? Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:41:18       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:41:19       So he's got all of this stuff and he's sitting there talking about he, he's still afraid of the Russians and a nuclear holocaust. He's been prepping for 30 years because that's basically what they used to scare the shit out of us about. Um, I came in in the tail end of it in the 70s, and, uh, this guy was older than me, so they psychologically fuck this guy up so bad that he was now, you know, stockpiling this hole in the ground. And then he found out that, uh, recently declassified information said that the Russians had detonated some fucking, I dunno, 200 mega ton fucking something or other, but the biggest bomb ever detonated. They did it and he realized that he wasn't deep enough. So he went out and he bought this big steel fucking tube and the whole time he's doing this, this guy is like 200 pounds overweight.

Speaker 5:          00:42:12       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:42:12       And it's like, dude, you better, you better deal with that first. Like you, you're going to drop up a fucking heart attack before they drop a fucking bomb on us. And he finally addressed it. He says, you know, I probably should get myself in better shape. Of course he was sitting down the entire time and even with the tee shirt on, the guy was so fucking fat, you could tell that he was finished. But um, so I actually liked the guy cause he finally addressed the fact that he was out of shape and needed to do something about it. But towards the end, there was this 15 year old kid who since the age of 12,

Speaker 2:          00:42:48       um, maybe it was a little bit older, one was 2008. That was five years ago. He's, what's 17? He was 12 one to 2008 a banking collapse happened. So he went on and he, he internet and he started reading up on banks and probably saw the conspiracy theory that I did. And it scared the fucking shit out of him as a 12 year old. And this fucking kid has been like scavenging slash stealing shit wherever he can because he doesn't have any money. And he has all these guns and he has these fucking swords and shit. He dresses in fatigues and stuff. And his mother is just sitting there going like, you know, I always wanted a normal thought. I don't know why he feels he has to do this and that. And now he's got, he's brought a friend into a fold and the, and then they brought it a into the fold and he brought a third person into the fold. And it's literally like, lady, Lady, did you see Colin? Bye. All right. I'm not saying this kid is like that, but like what the fuck are you doing? Her, her, her big parental moment was he's not allowed to go to the gun range without her.

Speaker 2:          00:43:53       She goes there and let some practice in. This fucking kid was great. His spread was basically from, you know, one ventricle to the fucking other. All right. This, is there two ventricles or is that an AOL? I don't fucking know. I'll Google map the heart at the end of this. Um, yeah, he was basically hitting it all center mass right around, right around your fucking heart. Right. And, but then he goes home and he's got the ammo when he has the guns in his fucking bedroom. And um, you know, he's like, I'm thankful Lou, uh, grow up with guns. He doesn't even

Speaker 7:          00:44:32       have a southern accent. Why am I fucking trash in the south again?

Speaker 5:          00:44:36       Okay.

Speaker 7:          00:44:36       Hear this fucking awful haircut. He didn't have a girlfriend. He's a fucking, he's, he's going down this rabbit hole and she's just letting them do it. And, uh, I find it really disturbing. I don't find it disturbing when like I see those kids smiling and they have rifles and their parents have gotten them into hunting. I know people out where I live and when I lived in New York City, they freak out about that stuff. Um, really intolerant of it, you know, as they eat a fucking chicken burrito. Uh, but I don't, I think you should know how to hunt and do all that type of shit. You know what? I didn't know I could fucking kill. I could kill a pig, a wild boar. I would love to go out and do that.

Speaker 5:          00:45:22       Yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:45:23       Fucking shoot that day. You know, I want to hear it from the rednecks out there. What am I in for?

Speaker 5:          00:45:31       Yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:45:31       If I miss and I think comes up when we don't, they just start fucking eaten. Yeah. The pigs. Right. They fucking eat anything. What I scare them or what I look like. One of those white chocolate covered pretzels.

Speaker 8:          00:45:44       Okay.

Speaker 7:          00:45:46       They think my freckles was salt. It'd be all over it. Um, would it be okay? Can slips in somebody, you know, next time I do one of my southern towards here. Can you guys take me pig hunting and uh, I want to fucking do it up. I want to go Rambo style with a crossbow, but I do want to have a backup Uzi. And I know if you're a redneck, I know you have a fucker newsy that's been fucking handed down since the the eighties.

Hey Belle. You mentioned a couple of weeks ago that you were thinking about going to Italy and you wanted some advice about where to go. My lady is Italian, so I've been there a bunch of times. Here's the deal. First you should decide if you want to see the north or the south. The North is more industrialized with lots of interest in interesting cities. Yeah. And San Marino too. All right. Isn't that where the blue bloods day a good food and as a more vibrant urban feel. The South is more country style with good weather and beautiful nature. I think I kind of liked that. You could think of it being very roughly like the difference between New England and the south back of the states. And the winner of the north will be pretty cold and the south will be a little more ball. Me, they both are the shit. All right, cool. Ah, where's Rome? Rome's like right in the middle. I got to get to know that type of stuff.

Speaker 5:          00:51:34       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:51:35       I can't wait to go. Um, and that's what I'm going to do right before my a European tour.

Speaker 5:          00:51:40       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:51:40       Uh, is I've got to go to Italy for a couple of days, like two, three days. Why the fuck wouldn't you if you're going to be over there anyways, I'll get acclimated to the time, the time change while eating some of the best food on the planet. I mean, my two favorite kinds of food is a Italian and Japanese. Those are my two favorites.

Speaker 5:          00:51:58       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:51:58       I love them both fucking delish. Um, so I got to figure out where I'm going to go on because I only have three days.

Speaker 5:          00:52:07       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:52:07       I don't want to go there and try and do a bunch of things.

Speaker 5:          00:52:11       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:52:12       I think it just want to go there and eat a big into stadiums. Maybe I would see the Roman Colosseum, but uh,

Speaker 5:          00:52:19       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:52:20       I think I just want to, um, I don't know what I want to do. I just want to eat some fucking just great place and tastes really clean food

Speaker 2:          00:52:31       with like what I show respect about Italian. Just how, how much they give a shit about the food making process. You know, I've told the shit the foist just to no more ice, no more Italian guys back in the day when I was living in Boston and I swear to God they would watch, we make a meal and it would like be upsetting them and eventually they just have to take over, be like, just, just, just get out of here. Like they would watch you fucking up a piece of meat. It would literally, it would, it would owed upset them.

Speaker 5:          00:53:03       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:53:04       You know, so you gotta respect it. All right, here we go. Salads. Oh by the way, that's another great part in the, the, the Ken Burns documentary is um,

Speaker 5:          00:53:15       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:53:15       You know, I always saw Mussolini given the speeches. Yeah. Oh, he's got one great one. When he's, he keeps doing this thing with his hand like, Hey, let them have Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah. Like he's just fucking talking shit. Like Hitler makes me want to speak German and Mussolini makes me want to speak Italian. Just watching those speeches, watch it. Hitler's screaming and yelling

Speaker 2:          00:53:38       like, you know, we used to be quiet, no sock up second a shit. I mean, is that what he's saying? I want to know what the fuck is he yelling about and Mussolini that look at confidence on his face. I just want to hear what the fuck he's talking about. I'm sure this transcriptions, but it's, it's gotta be better if you actually know the language. Um, and I got that fucking Irish thing where I got to do everything the hard way. Um, so all I would ever see was him a Mussolini given the speeches and then him fucking hanging by the meat, hook him with his fucking girlfriend.

Speaker 5:          00:54:09       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:54:09       MMM. And I always wonder what the hell had happened. And I didn't know that he had gotten captured and then the Nazis came in and freedom.

Speaker 5:          00:54:20       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:54:21       you don't like the fucking expendables Assam Shit. Is that a right reference? I never saw one of those movies, but that seemed like they what they were doing, like they will rescue the people and uh,

Speaker 5:          00:54:30       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:54:31       And then he got, he got caught again and he tried to talk his way out of it again. And his last words were, was basically saying no, like, no, no, no. It's fucking Christ. What a fucking way to go out.

Speaker 5:          00:54:48       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:54:49       it, I've been talking about that in my act. It's just that guy, like a year's time he went from just like being, having a boy band fame and everybody's screaming and throwing bras at him and shit to be like on his knees. Like keep fucking, they killed him, man. His woman, I love it too. It was his mistress, I believe is what they call, I don't fucking remember. I remember you starting to forget the shit and then they brought him into town and everybody was kicking him and dig his face. Just, they just kicked the shit out of his face and this spitting on him and they hung up by a meat hook.

Speaker 5:          00:55:27       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:55:28       It's like what happened? You know, you think it's bad to be like, you know, in, in old town, try being a fucking dictator, man. It's, it's brutal. It just does. That's why they never have a behind the music for dictators because, you know, how would it, for the most part, I would fucking ends. You don't end, you know, you're not lying in bed.

Speaker 5:          00:55:51       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:55:52       You know, going through some fucking Buddhist, this is the death process. You know, where they teach you how to die peacefully and you're surrounded by fucking loved ones or whatever. This is the exact opposite of that shit.

Speaker 5:          00:56:05       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:56:06       Hitler blew his brains out.

Speaker 5:          00:56:08       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:56:09       What's his face?

Speaker 5:          00:56:11       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:56:11       Mostly Lady. I just told you what the fuck happened to him. Sudan will say they dragged him out of a fucking hole. He went out like a gangsta though, man. That Jesus Christ, he refused the hood.

Speaker 7:          00:56:24       We put the rope around his neck and he was getting heckled. This is his shit. Like when people talk about, you know, when they go and they look at comics getting heckled and taken on the crowd, he has to have the best one for, for dictators. He was standing there and he's getting heckled and he's giving him shit right back with a fucking rope around his neck. He got to respect that math. I would have been like Muesli and me trying to fucking wriggle my fed out of it. I definitely would have taken the hood. Um, who else does that get that? The fatty over there in a little fat boy in Korea. I wonder how he died. He's probably watching like little house on the prairie or something. He was a weird guy. It was in the movies and shit. He actually, he lived, it's very few that actually get to make, make it that far. You know, they get to continue where it's like actors who get to continue working on into their seventies and still doing like Oscar winning work. It's very difficult. Most people fall by the wayside. All right bill, we get it. Okay. All right. You know I'm into that shit. Alright, salads. Hey Bill. I would like to get into eating more salads, but I'm only 20. And what the fuck do I know about salads do I didn't know shit about salads. I wish I started eating salads when I was 20. I wouldn't have this fucking mess.

Speaker 7:          00:57:50       Jesus Christ and it's pasty. It's even worse. Uh, should I get into spinach? Some good old iceberg lettuce. What do I put in Salad? What's the point of making a salad? If I just cover with ranch dressing and put a bunch of Bacon on it, I'm not even sure what Balsamic vinegarette is. Is a boiled egg. A good thing to put in is appreciated. Gotta be a Dick here and say hi. Hi. Blackhawks won while you want. You get the fucking brag about it. You can't listen. I don't know shit about nutrition. I'm just starting to learn about it. I know iceberg lettuce is like 90% water. I think a spinach is good shit. I like that. I like a regular um, kales awesome. And um, yeah, don't go through all the crappy eating that shit and then put a bunch of dressing on it cause you know, you're adding all those extra calories, I guess Balsamic vinegarette this is all shit that I've overheard.

Speaker 7:          00:58:44       I heard that that's the healthier one. But even then I try to avoid drowning. And uh, what's great about is when you start eating them, you start craving them and that becomes one meal a day. And that's just, you know, you got to start looking at like a steak and cheese sandwich or something like that. A pizza. That's just, it's just a plate full of setups. You know, I fucking hate going to the gym. I like going to the gym cause I want to look good. I hate going to the gym cause I fucking have to go, which is what I'm doing right now, which sucks, you know, you know what's another bad one is when you fucking sitting up in bed like I am and you'll hold your iPhone up to you and you get the reflection of like, you're fucking nine Chin's start to get that Pelican neck. Ah. Anyways, so, um, there's a bunch of recipes out there. You can find it, but I would, I, I'd stay away from iceberg. That's stinks. Romaine is like, that's like halfway decent. All right. Iceberg lettuce. They're like the, uh,

Speaker 5:          00:59:45       yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:59:45       I Dunno. What will you want? You want to go sports on this one? We'll go sports and I'm not talking about what they're gonna do this year, what they did last year. I would just say what they've done in my lifetime. All right. Iceberg lettuce is like the fucking Detroit lions. Uh, even though they're good now, they weren't then. So that's probably a bad example. The Cleveland browns of lettuce, sorry everybody in Cleveland. Although I did promote your city and I saw a lot of fucking knock construction going on there. A romaine lettuce is like dead fucking team that every once in a while makes the playoffs but never fucking wins it there. That's like the Falcons of lettuce. Um, and then you get into a rural girl loves the cowboys. Kale, I would say is the 40. Niners and uh, I dunno, I dunno. Maybe I should have said the packers and Steelers or the Steelers and packers packers are the most successful.

Speaker 7:          01:00:41       So I'd say the Kale, I'd say Steelers not just shut the fuck up. Okay. A Russian guy. Outwits banks. Oh, I like this one already. Hey Bill thought you might enjoy reading this article about a Russian man who outwit it, a bank by writing his own terms into their credit card contract. Jesus Christ. That's fucking phenomenal. I hadn't held it. That's like beaten. Bruce Lee had karate or Kung Fu a Jean funky, whatever the fuck he did article. Here we go. The idea of beating the banks at their own game may seem like a rich joke, but to me, tree,

Speaker 7:          01:01:17       uh, Gara Cove, a Gar cove, I don't know, 42 year old Russian man sounds like he plays for the Redwings, doesn't hae a 42 year old Russian man may have managed to do it. Unhappy with the terms of the, of an unsolicited credit card offer he received from an online bank tin cough credit system at Gar cough. Sorry. If you're listening and I'm butchering this story. If you have Russian descent, uh, he scanned the document, wrote in his own terms and sent it through the bank, approved the contract without reading the amended fine print, unwittingly agreeing to a 0% interest rate, unlimited credit and no fees as well as a stipulation that the banks at the bank pay steep fines for changing or canceling the contract.

Speaker 5:          01:02:08       Okay.

Speaker 7:          01:02:09       The bank has so much money, they'll be able to get around this. But what, that's fucking genius. What a hero. A Garco. I've used the card for two years, but the bank ultimately it and sued a Gar car for $1,363. The bank said he owed them charges, interest, and late payment fees. A court ruled that because of the no fee, no interest stipulation to guard cough had written in, he owed only his unpaid $575 balance. Look at this two minutes left in the game. People, are you going to win this? A what? A God carve is now suing the bank for $727,000 for not honoring the contract's term. And the bank is hollering fraud. They signed the documents without looking. They said what used what? Usually they said to me, what? Usually their borrowers saying court, we've, we've not read it. A golf club's lawyer said, uh, the shoe's on the other foot now. Sorry, I really butchered their ending of that reading so well, I got to pay attention to that. Well, they'll settle out of court. I Dunno, man. That's, that's a hard, I mean, the fact that you got to just got out of paying the fees.

Speaker 7:          01:03:26       I gotta put this in my, uh, my computer here. I want to pay attention to a Gar cough.

Speaker 5:          01:03:32       Okay.

Speaker 7:          01:03:32       Russia bank case

Speaker 7:          01:03:40       Ak. So it's still at that point. Hey, anybody in Russia listen to this thing. Can You keep, please keep me abreast of this. I want to see if he gets any of that. $727,000. All right. I want to do a little pre game analysis here. I'll tell you right now, I gotta tell Ya, if I'm the bank I got to be taken out of, we ended up in this situation, I would actually guess that they're not gonna pay any of that. Um, they probably got enough politicians and judges in their pockets. I mean, it's corrupt enough over here. I can't imagine what the fuck it's like over there. No offense, but, uh, it is what it is. Um, yeah. If anybody I know Estonia, Latvia, get close enough, you can pay attention, they'll let me know. I'd appreciate it. Lithuania, the Ukraine, Belarus, look at me. I've learned some shit. Uh, I'm an attention whore. Bill. Bill Burke Marshall. I'm a 16 year old guy and I've recently come to terms with the fact that I love attention. In most instances, this would not be too big of a deal. I mean, look at you. You made a career out of it. Hey listen, you fucking cunt. Just cause you find out that you're a dick. You don't get to rub up against me and get your stink on me.

Speaker 5:          01:04:51       Okay?

Speaker 7:          01:04:52       You know? Did I say I didn't like fucking attention? You asshole.

Speaker 5:          01:04:57       Yeah.

Speaker 7:          01:04:57       Jesus Christ. You know I was actually going to compliment you with the fact that you actually could. You could step outside yourself and see something that could potentially be a floor. Wanting attention is not a bad thing. It's all how you do it, you know? All right, here we go. I constantly sit in class loudly, cracking jokes and can usually get the whole class laughing. Plus I don't have to worry about the teachers yelling at me because I'm such a manipulated, manipulative son of a bitch that I have ensured that they all liked me. Here's the problem. My friends hate it. All right? This has taken a different turn here. The jokes I make with them are far different. I actually think they're funny. You see the jokes I make to the whole class or Shitty hacky, cheap, cheesy, douchey jokes, targeting a group laugh. The jokes I make with my friends are normally riffing on something. They might actually be creative.

Speaker 5:          01:05:54       Okay.

Speaker 7:          01:05:54       Oh, all right. So you kind of, when you're with your friends, you're actually a comic's comic,

Speaker 7:          01:06:01       but when you're in front of the crowd, you, you're, you're, you're playing to the masses. Well, you've got to pick a road here, son. Um, or maybe it don't, I mean it's not you, you're trying to be a comedian or maybe you are, if you're going to be a comedian, I would try to make the crowd laugh at the jokes to make your friends left. All right, here we go. Now. Now I know the simple solution seems to be stopped being a class clown, but I just loved the attention. I'm so emotionally undeveloped that I craved the CRAs class approval and attention. Dude, you're not emotionally undeveloped. This is unbelievable that you have this sort of a knowledge of self. It's 16. I certainly didn't what you know at 16 I don't think I knew until I was 36 so you're, you're, you're in a,

Speaker 5:          01:06:44       okay,

Speaker 7:          01:06:44       you're in a good situation. Here he goes, I love being the center of the class, making everyone laugh to spice, knowing that I'm being fake and not myself.

Speaker 5:          01:06:53       Yeah.

Speaker 7:          01:06:53       What should I do? Should I stop cracking the shit jokes in class or should I tell my friends to get over it and keep being that guy? Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. Ah, first of all, I don't know what the fuck your friends have a problem with. I mean, how bad are these jokes? Just say and, and

Speaker 5:          01:07:12       yeah,

Speaker 7:          01:07:13       you're basically what you're doing is in class. Sounds like the first, I dunno, three to six, seven, eight years of being a standup comedian were once you figure out how to make the, uh, the crowd laugh, you then try to be like, well, I want to,

Speaker 5:          01:07:30       okay,

Speaker 7:          01:07:31       I want to be like, say what? I really want to talk about up here. Basically find your voice. So, um, I don't think that you should make a change because of your friends. I think you should make a change because you want to make the change, you know, when that makes sense. If you like the attention and that type of shit, who gives a fuck?

Speaker 5:          01:07:51       Okay.

Speaker 7:          01:07:51       But, uh, if you want to take your class clown or to the next level, I would go with some of the more creative stuff. You don't have to always go with a shit joke, but I have to commend you that you, when I used to be a class clown, I would always get in trouble and the teachers didn't like me. So the fact that he able to do that is great. And uh, I think you're going to be real successful in like in life. You could do anything. Politics Show business sales.

Speaker 5:          01:08:18       Okay.

Speaker 7:          01:08:19       If you like, if you could actually talk to a crowd that, that really puts you ahead of the game, I would think. All right. He also says, ps, as a Blackhawks fan, I would just like to personally thank Boston fans for being so classy, respectful, and dare I say Saint Lake St like from the bottom of my hat, my black cock hard. I would like to personally thank each and every Bruin fan. You were all models of fandom. Thank you for fucking mocking that. Um, or just trying to rub it in. I don't give a shit at this point. That seemed like years ago and we just want a cup, so I'm good. So congratulations to you, sir. Good luck with trying to find your voice as a class clown. All right. God Damn ex-girlfriend. Dare Billy boy. Um, your podcast is killer, man. Thanks. Well thank you. I appreciate that. And he says, I'm writing you to get some insight on my ex girlfriend situation. About six months ago, my ex dump my ass and totally crushed my heart. That's the worst. Did you got to go throw it though? Uh, he says I was fucked up for a while, but it took some of your advice and focused on improving my own shit. I never called her texts or a did any asshole.

Speaker 7:          01:09:32       It's for six months. A couple of months ago, she texts me, ah, fuck. And I know it. I know it now without reading this thing she's texted you now. Either she legitimately wants to get back together with you, which if you still love her, that would be a good thing or whatever the fuck she,

Speaker 7:          01:09:55       whatever path life path she went down over the last six months has hit a hard, is it a bump in the road and maybe she's having second thoughts or maybe she's completely evil and she's like, wow, he just never called me again. Why don't I call him up in mind? Fuck them. Those are my three guests on the, uh, the cont genie lamp player. All right? So she texted me, she wanted to know what I've been up to and how I was doing. She also wanted to know why I unfriended her on Facebook. And he writes, why do you think you'd dump cunt that, wait a minute, did you unfriend her because of my advice? Did you do that on your own? That's a great thing. You got, you got to get cut the cancer out. You can't be watching what the fuck she's doing. All you're doing is prolonging that pain in your heart.

Speaker 7:          01:10:47       You got to watch, I'm telling you, if you gotta, you gotta cut off all contact and then you got to go Chris Bosh. We just got to drop to your knees a couple of times a day and cry it out. Don't be afraid to fucking do that and I wouldn't do it in front of a bunch of men, but you know, do it on your own like as a man. You have to understand that the reason why you're able to cry is because you supposed to because if you don't, you keep it in your chest and it becomes, and then you yell at your kids. All right. I resisted the urge to tell her to go fuck herself and kept my responsible, my responses. Cool and casual. Dude, you are on the road to a post breakup blow job. That's where you are right now. Let's see if you keep the car on the road. Here's my question. How the fuck do broads know when you are finally getting over them and that they should get ahold of you and make you feel like shit again. Also d say I know it.

Speaker 5:          01:11:40       Yeah.

Speaker 7:          01:11:41       Also, do you think it's a dick move to get a hold of an x if you're the one who dumped then when they haven't gotten a hold of you since the breakup. Finally, how do you think I should handle this going forward? Um, well you know what? You, you basically, you learned one of life's tough lessons. Is that a

Speaker 5:          01:12:05       yeah,

Speaker 7:          01:12:05       my amino something. I might be being a dick here. Like baby got guys do this shit too. All right guys do do this shit too. That you got those guys who they break up with a girl but then they keep her in, in, they try to like hold onto her so no one else can fucker. You know guys who do that shit. So this is really like I'm being a sexist more on as usual.

Speaker 6:          01:12:27       MMM.

Speaker 7:          01:12:28       I'm coming from the male perspective. That's all I got. All right. Trying to show a little empathy here. Um, how do they know? I don't know, but they're great at it. So rather than trying to figure it out because I don't know that you can as a guy, just respect that they have that ability.

Speaker 6:          01:12:47       All right. Um,

Speaker 7:          01:12:51       you might want to consider changing your cell phone number so she can't text slash mind fuck you again.

Speaker 6:          01:12:57       MMM.

Speaker 7:          01:13:01       What if it is the fucking worst? They just the fucking worst in that situation, dude. You just, you got to walk away from a man. So I can't remember what the fuck you asked me. I'm going through all the breakups I've been through mentally right now.

Speaker 6:          01:13:12       MMM.

Speaker 7:          01:13:14       All right. So the first thing you said is how the fuck do broads know when you finally over them, I don't know, change your cell phone number is my solution.

Speaker 7:          01:13:24       Um, also, do you think it's a dick move to get ahold of an x if you have no intention of getting back with them? Yes, I do. And you have to accept the guilty. You feel that you broke somebody's heart and you have to own that. You can't like calling, just calling to make sure you're doing okay. You're not helping that other person. If you have no intent, you're giving them a half a second, a hope and then you know, you're just, you're, you're, you're ruining them. You gotta let them go. Um, and lastly, how do you think I should handle this going forward? Yeah. I would say don't respond to her texts or uh, even that, just her texting you and seeing your name and knowing that she's thinking about you and your heart's still going to be like, well, maybe, maybe two minutes.

Speaker 7:          01:14:08       You can night together. I would just change the number. Start over again. Go Bill Bixby. Get a backpack. Walk out of town. Who Do go down the fucking street. Um, start working out. Get some new women in your life. That's another thing. Go out there and go hit kid on something he thinks out of your league. Gives a shit. Go have a good time. I'm hitting on a girl that's odd. That's so called rd or league is like playing a sport against people who are better than you. It makes you better it up. She's game. All right. So then when you, you play against somebody who's only little out of your league, your actually, you used to play and beyond and you're not nervous. You used to that speed, you know? Does that make any fucking sense? I hope it does. Anyways, that is the, uh, the podcast for this week.

Speaker 7:          01:14:56       Everybody. Thank you. As always for everybody who's contributed with the questions and everything that really is the last half of this podcast every week. MMM. And also, I forgot to mention that, uh, the last couple of weeks, if you'd like to support this podcast, a very easy way is if you plan on buying on some something on amazon.com just go to billboard.com first click on the podcast page and click on the Amazon banner that we have that'll take you right to Amazon and you don't have to do shit after that. It doesn't change the prices of anything. They kicked me a percentage of the sale for driving traffic their way. I take a percentage of that, send it to the wounded warriors project. So it's a two for one as far as supporting me and supporting the wounded warriors project and also hard copy versions of my DVD, uh, of my standup special, sorry, DVD copies are available on my website and also available for download, um, for five bucks.

Speaker 7:          01:15:51       And it's uh, the, you people are all the same. So people have asked me when I'm doing another special, I've begun talks about planning about doing one in the first half of next year. I basically I do them every other year. Um, as basically outworks I spend one year having fun, right. And a new hour and then I spend the next year fine tuning it and then when I'm done with that, then I shoot it. That's basically a, that's basically what I do. And uh, that's the formula it's been working for me, so I'm sticking with it. And then also people in Scotland had been asking me about my, am I still doing Scotland because they didn't see a date. I am definitely doing a date. Things got moved around. I do two shows in London. I'm still doing one in Scotland. Um, it's going to be at this theater, I forget the name of it, but I'm somewhere around the fourth of the 5th of December or something like that. But, uh, hopefully at some point this week I'm going to get an official date and I'm going to tweet about it. I will Facebook about it and I will podcast about it next week. And a thank you to everybody over there who's been buying up the tickets. It starting off really strong and, uh, somebody actually sent me a,

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       um, for the, uh, the advertisement in Stockholm and it was really cool. It was other than my name, obviously, if it's all written and fucking Swedish and shit, and it's just a, it's the coolest fucking thing ever that there's people in an, on the other side of the world speaking a different language and they're writing about a show that you gotta go up there and go, do, you know, he's fucking awesome. So anyways, I'm really excited about that. And, uh, all the shit that I have coming up. Uh, oh, by the way, if you're in into a, if you're not into motorcycle racing or you'd like to get into it, they got one of their grand prixs, I think it's in Indianapolis or something, somewhere in the states this weekend coming up on, uh, August 18th, I believe. I'm actually going to watch it now that I got a motorcycle license be, I watched that documentary on Netflix about all those motorcycle races, races and that type of shit.

Speaker 2:          01:18:06       It's just fucking the balls that that takes. It's like you weren't in a formula one car, except you don't have a roll cage around you. It's unfucking real the balls of that takes. So I'm hopefully going to have time to watch it next Sunday. I'm definitely gonna try to find a buy out here. And once again, thanks to everybody in New Orleans, been having a great time coming around town, going to the open mics, doing the, uh, doing the standup shows, been getting a wonderful reception. And I've been trying a lot of new stuff. So I'm having a ball down here. I'm going to be down here for another week and a half and then I'm back up. Where the hell do I go? I go up to Connecticut to do the MGM and then I do, I think the University of Cincinnati, and then I'm back out to la and that's the deal. Everybody, that's the podcast. Go fuck yourselves. Have a great week and I'll see you later.
