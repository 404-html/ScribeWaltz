Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burr and it's the Monday morning podcast from Monday, February 2nd, 2015. How you doing? How the fuck?

Speaker 2:          00:00:10       Ah, yeah. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:00:14       I know what you guys are all expecting. You guys are all expected me for to get on this fucking podcast and to start going absolutely fucking crazy because the new England patriots won another fucking Super Bowl and beat the loud mouth green comments from Seattle. You know what? There is nothing that I would love to do more than that. I would love to sit here and tell you that I enjoyed every fucking second of that Goddamn game. But unfortunately all freckles missed the game every fucking second to that game I missed. And I know what you guys are thinking. What Jesus felt. We were, you kidnapped. Did somebody chloroform rag you. What the fuck happened? Um, what happened was is I booked this fucking tour in Australia, New Zealand, Singapore. I hope this is the, he's not gonna be too loud. I'm doing it on my fucking iPhone because uh, you know, cause I'm in fucking New Zealand and I can't get any outlets to work and my batteries don't fucking work.

Speaker 1:          00:01:16       I'm just having a technological nightmare anyways. You know, I booked this fucking tour back in November. How the hell did I know the Patriots are going to be in the God damn Superbowl? I didn't know. You know, I'm one of the few fucking football fans that actually admits that he had no fucking idea what his team was going to do this year. I had no idea. You know, um, I can't fucking believe you want, I just landed. I was literally in the air the exact moment the fucking game started and when I landed it was fucking over. I missed absolutely everything. Uh, I'm obviously unbelievably psyched that we won for a number of fucking reasons, aside from the obvious, you know, more so than fucking excited that we won. I'm just so happy that I didn't get half to watch Richard Sherman run into fucking Brady's face and disrespect the guy again.

Speaker 1:          00:02:09       That whole fucking you mad bro thing. I just, I don't know. You know, you run it up to a champion, the guy's got three rings, you want a regular season game and you treat him like he's a fucking rookie. I mean, I dunno, I've never liked people that do that type of shit. I'm sure he's a hell of a guy to sit down and have a fucking cap, a Chino with. But I just, you know, all that mug into the camera and shit. I've already seen the highlights where he did the 24 thing and all that. And I'm sure that's another thing that would have kind of ruined the Superbowl for me was every five seconds they got to cut over to him or his reaction. I hate when they do that to Tom Brady, like at the other team scores. Then he got to see Tom Brady sitting there with that. I'm mad. Look on his face. It's like, I this, there's too much fucking coverage at this point. Having said all of that. Um, um, so it's, this is, this is still weird, kind of like fucking excitement.

Speaker 3:          00:03:01       Like the level of excitement I have right now is I, I guess I know what it feels like before the days of TV and radio. You know, we just live in the middle of nowhere and someone walks up to you and like, Ethel did, she here we won the war. That's what I feel like right now. I got on a fucking plane and um, yeah, I missed the whole thing. And I was praying to God that they were going to have live TV because they had sports bars down here that had the fucking game on and everything. And um, you know, I know what a lot of you guys are going to see. Well, why didn't you change your fucking flight? Um, because I am on the other side of the fucking world and I can't miss shows because of a fucking football game, be it the Superbowl on not be the Superbowl.

Speaker 3:          00:03:47       Okay. With Tom Brady fucking cancel a flight to watch one of my specials. I don't think he would, you know, I don't want to get all Bronx tale on you right now, but I, I, you know, I got to fucking life. I got to lead here. So, um, uh, my God, I can't believe I missed the fucking game, but, uh, pardon me. When I saw the ending and there was another fucking ridiculous catching the ball against your helmet and your ball bag catch and it looked like we were going to lose again, I literally would have died a thousand deaths. I can tell you right now, I would have missed that interception because after that fucking catch, I would've been walking outside doing laps around my house. Like, you gotta be fucking kidding me. Um, but anyways, uh, I'm psyched that we want obviously, and um, you know, my condolences to Seattle Seahawks fans, the real ones, the ones from back in the kingdom era, the ones that is still going to be in your fucking stadium after Pete Carroll's gone and everybody's fucking gone.

Speaker 3:          00:04:44       And you guys, you know, stink. Again, the same way to patriots will stink again when Belichick and Brady lead those, the real fucking fans, I feel bad for you all you fucking loud mouth shit talk and fucking cunts. Who were those lime green wigs? You are the guys that I'm happy that you'd fucking suffer that loss. Go Fuck yourselves with your stupid 12th man fucking shirts. Do you know I heard Seattle actually has to pay the college Texas a and M for that 12th man thing that they didn't come up with that, you know, so they got to pay them and not to mention the buffalo bills had a 12th man thing, you know, back in the early fucking nineties. I don't know. I'm just so fucking happy that we won and that, uh, you know, who knows. I'm sure they'll fucking dealt, measure the thread count in the fucking towels that we were using to drive the balls off with. I'm sure Jim Irsay is somewhere trying to figure out a fucking way to try to taint this fucking victory. I swear to Christ. Did you guys see that thing where the Atlanta Falcons maybe got busted for pumping extra crowd noise in? Did you happen to catch that story? I swear to God, if the Patriots did something like that, we would literally be sitting down in front of the fucking Senate. You know, that was another thing, another

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       reason why I was so fucking happy that we won because I'm so fucking sick of winning games and these fucking cunts bitching about.

Speaker 4:          00:06:07       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:06:07       Absolute horseshit.

Speaker 4:          00:06:10       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:06:10       At the end of the fucking game, I mean deflate gate, the flake gate, all of that fucking shit. And nobody brings up how many people on the fucking Seattle Seahawks team had tested positive for steroids over the last four fucking years. Nobody brings up that Pete Carroll had a championship taken away from him for fucking cheating. And I gotta tell you something. I don't give a fuck.

Speaker 4:          00:06:32       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:06:32       I don't give a fuck. That's Seattle. Use Steroids. I'm sure what fucking using them too and whatever fucking Pete Carroll did at the college level. I know there's a bunch of other coaches doing the same fucking thing. So I don't know why people get comfy with us, but who gives a fuck? We won the Goddamn thing and I am literally sitting out here right in the fucking abyss. That's like, I'm ridiculously excited.

Speaker 4:          00:06:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:06:57       Like this must be like what it's like to find out the Patriots won. If you sit in and fucking Walpole prison in like solitary confinement, I can't fucking believe I missed it. Jesus fucking Christ. I'm sitting there watching documentaries about cricket. My fucking head phones won't work down here. Nothing's fucking working. Um, so anyways, if you called, if you fucking are listening this week to hear my blow by blow Horse Shit, you're not going to get it this week. So I suggest you listen to another podcast. But if you want to know what my fucking Australian tour is like in the New Zealand, that's basically, uh, I guess what I'm going to be a Todd. Can't fucking believe. What are the fucking odds? What are the fucking odds step? Literally from the time my flight started to when it ended, that was the exact time that the game was on.

Speaker 1:          00:07:49       Um, I, I don't know anything about the gang. I really don't. I just know in the end is that Seattle was up by 10 points and for some reason they're going to say that they lost the game by not running Marshawn lynch in. But I would just say that if you were up 10 points with a quarter to go, there's more than one reason why you lost that fucking game. And uh, you know, I don't think it's the worst call in Superbowl history. I think it's going to be called that because it didn't work. You know what I mean? And uh, if it fucking works, then he's a genius. Let me talk about guts. Everybody in the building is keying on Marshawn Lynch and he dumped, you know that that was going to be the fucking thing. I'm just so happy that the Patriots didn't lose another Superbowl on some fucking circus catch. I swear to God after the helmet catch. Well, I guess, you know, I didn't actually mind the fucking helmet. Catch as much as I met. I was annoyed that a satay Samuel drop that interception. Other than that, um, the 2007 Superbowl wasn't that bad because I felt that the giants were a better team. The second giant loss, that one was brutal because fucking blew that

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       game. Um, we fucking blew that game. We had the right call and it was Brady to Welker eight yard pass wide open and it bounces off his back fucking shoulder. That would ice the game. That was a fucking brutal one. But, uh, that first one we definitely lost. So anyways, there you go. Now the championship for Boston. How do you like that New York City? Huh? Nine championships and like 12 seasons. What do you got? 58 fucking teams and you can't even do that yet. It's a fucking unreal. Uh, uh, Jesus Christ. Why am I shitting on fucking New York? You know, I'm shitting on New York, is it? My fucking team won the Superbowl and I didn't even get the fucking, see. It's unbelievable. Unfucking believable. So I guess I take the game, so I'm going to have to watch it after I do gigs in New Zealand and then Singapore, Hong Kong, Mumbai, India, and then I go to New York for the Patrice O'neal la benefit.

Speaker 3:          00:09:53       Speaking of which last night, but when it, what, uh, let me, let me just finish here. Seriously. Do my condolences. Tell to a Seattle Seahawk Trans. I don't break any balls a little bit. There's nothing fucking worse than losing a God damn Superbowl and to lose it like that in the fucking end. I know it fucking blows. Um, but you know, he just got fucking, well that ex extra fucking horseshit hype about you guys being loud, you know, got a little annoying. So maybe I am being a little bit of a con. What are you going to do anyways? Um, plowing ahead here. Uh, speaking of the Patrice O'neil comedy benefit that we're doing for the third time, um, which I want to thank everybody over the last three years who've, who've bought tickets because you've really, you've changed people's lives that Patrice loved. All right. I'm not going to get into the details of it, but like, you know, yeah, this does charities on the up and up. I just know that, you know, we're not doing a show with a pink microphone.

Speaker 3:          00:10:58       Um, this is so fucked up. Some people tweeted me so much shit about awful commercials during the Superbowl and I just had no idea. I literally, you know, I might as well have been orbiting the earth and the fucking space shuttle that that's like how, how much, how little I know about whatever the fuck happened. Um, I do know that it looked like a hell of a game and uh, you know, my heart said we were going to win. I had a feeling we were going to win, but my brain said that, uh, you know, on paper we were going to lose. And to be honest with you, before the game started, when I was thinking about it, I had no feeling one way or the other. I didn't have a bad feeling like we were going to win. I didn't have a good feeling.

Speaker 3:          00:11:40       Okay. If we won by 40 or lost by 40 hours, I I don't think either would have surprised me. I just had no fucking id on this one. So, um, anyways, I feel like I'll let you guys down because I was doing this fucking Goddamn tour and you wanted to hear me globe and Shit. But, uh, you know, I'm not a guy, I'm not a guy who fucking gloats anyways, come on. I break balls, but I don't fucking do dude. I'm not going to fucking sit here and go act like I played the Goddamn game, but, um, anyways, and as much as I don't like the way Richard Sherman acts when he fucking wins, that guy is one of the best corners in the fucking Lakey is. And I wish she was on my team, although I wouldn't like to watch that fucking dumb shit that he does.

Speaker 3:          00:12:20       Um, so anyways, uh, like I said, speaking of the Patrice O'Neal benefit, um, last night I was playing the, uh, the Sydney Opera House, which was, it was a ridiculous honor playing two shows there. And at the end of the show, somebody in the front row handed me a shirt that they made, um, that had Patrice, I'll take a picture of it. It's fucking unreal. It has Patrice on the front. And then on the back is Patrice talking to me and it's got Colin Quinn, uh, Keith Robinson, Jim Norton who have Robert Kelly's in it. It's the fucking shirt is unbelievable. And, uh, the person that front row just handed it to me as I was getting off this, you know, it was, I was getting off really quick, so I just grabbed it and I just, you know, I handed them my setlist from the show, which I hope it didn't come off as a douchey move on, just kind of getting off stage there.

Speaker 3:          00:13:13       And, um, I didn't have a chance to look at it until I got backstage. Um, whoever you are that made that shirt, please try and reach out to me on Twitter or whatever. Cause uh, you know, I wish I could have thanked you, um, personally for cause it's a fucking unbelievable, uh, piece of work. I don't know how the hell you did it and I wish you made more of them. Um, cause I know all my friends would love one and it was just amazing. But, um, anyways, I'm about a week into this tour of Australia and it has been, uh, you know, just take it right now. I'm thinking of all the Patriots fans that are just fucking shutting it off right now. Going, what the fuck, dude? I thought he was going to go off. Sorry, I didn't see the game. Ah,

Speaker 1:          00:14:01       yes. Anyways, let me get back into the, you know what I did do this week? I, I saw some tennis. Does that help you out at all? This sports fans? I, um, I went to the Australian Open, I thought some tennis. I saw Maria Sharapova and the SMEs and I saw us,

Speaker 3:          00:14:25       Serena Williams, both winning the semis to play each other in the finals. And uh, if you've never been to a tennis match, this is so fucking funny to be doing this. The day after Superbowl, I might as well be baking a pie right now. Um, if you'd never been to a, uh, to a fucking tennis match, you know what, just the level of wealth that is, they're like, you know, um, you don't have, first of all, the tickets weren't hard to get like a, you know, I just scalped a pair of them, you know, I'm not gonna lie, you know, they were like 300 bucks a whack, but I'm like, fuck it man. You know, it's, it's, it's one of the majors. I'll fucking, you know, bring it up on the card. I'll deal with it later. Right. Fuck it. And when you go there, like the level of fucking wealth that's sitting around there and they smell it on you when you show up the second they see the fact that you're not wearing loafers with no socks on, they just look at you like you're a fucking animal.

Speaker 3:          00:15:24       You know, you watched him getting old boozed up and shit. And I always get excited when I sit around. Those people just said, I just want to ask them, you know, Shit like, you know, when's the dollar going to collapse? Like, what's the insight information that you fucking know? You know those people, they'd like, they sit there, right? They have tickets for the whole day we just had for the afternoon. Right. And it's sitting there and they got, they were like the sweaters, you know, where you're not wearing it, you just have it draped over your shoulder. You don't, you don't have a tied around your neck, you just have it draped over. I think that's the new way to do it. And then not doing it like ironically, like they have a sweater for when it gets cold later when they're watching the tennis.

Speaker 3:          00:16:04       But anyways, we sat close enough, um, and got, got to watch Serena right before she won the, uh, the 19th, her 19th championships. So I got to do that. I went to Bond Scott's grave when I was out in, uh, when I was out in Perth and um, it was really cool. They had a little bench there cause I guess bonds, Ma, mother for as far as I know, is still alive. She's well into her nineties, and up until recently would go down and visit the grave every almost every day, which of course is really sad, but they, so they made, they raised some money and they made like a little bench for her and everything. And uh, you know, it's, it's, if you ever get a chance to go to Australia and Perth, first of all, purpose is the shit. I talked to some woman when I was here in the states and she tried to tell me, you know, she was from Australia and she was shitting all over at saint it.

Speaker 3:          00:16:51       Like it was, you know, that it was fucking horrific or whatever. It's uh, it's quite the opposite man. Very impressive city. It seems like the kind of place where you, a vacation or something man and beautiful beaches. That was another thing. Cool tools. We uh, we went down to the beach one day and I quit laugh and fuck you. I know. I'm pasty, but I had to do it, you know, um, and just to see the Indian Ocean, you know, never seen that. And I'm, my wife of course went in the ocean cause she fucking loves the ocean and I sort of frolicked along the fucking along the fucking beach. I just do not go, I went into the water just to say I've been in the fucking Indian Ocean, but I do not fuck with, I just don't fuck with the ocean on any level. And uh, but if I was going to fuck with it, I would go all in. Like I would get certified to scuba dive and the next time I come here I would go to the Great Barrier Reef and that I would do that before I would fucking just start, I don't know, swimming, align the fucking coast, you know, like I guess that the sharks come out in the morning. They, they're basically out when the seals are out, so you don't want to be out when the seals are out. I guess it's early morning and dusk or something. And um,

Speaker 3:          00:18:11       they, they were telling me some fucking story where there was a helicopter following an 18 foot tiger shark. Just keeping an eye on it to make sure it didn't go into the beach area. I mean, give me a fucking break. I'm not going to that God damn water. You. What's funny about the Australia is down here too. When they talk about somebody getting attacked by a shark, they don't say you got to attack. They say he got taken and I was like, yeah, there was a bloke got taken. I don't say bloke. I came up the fuck they said this, if you'd like. Some dude got taken about 20 miles up. They told a story. I don't even know if this is true, if they just trying to scare a tourist, but they were saying this fucking guy was surfing and he was, you know, not waiting for a wave.

Speaker 3:          00:18:51       He was in the wave riding the wave I should say in the fucking shark and jumped out of the water and grabbed him like some sharp NATO shit. Like I'm, he jumped out of the fucking wall. I thought you had to have like your arms hanging off the board and then from underneath you look like a seal. Sort of a strange shape seal or whatever. But like, if you're, if you're fucking on the board at that point, if they're jumping out of the water, I don't know. I don't know. Like I'm saying, I don't fuck with the water, but I had a, uh, I really had a great time in Perth. Uh, my favorite beer out here is that little creatures and it turns out they had a brewery and I was able to go to the brewery. I could have taken the tour, but I, I don't understand going, taking a tour of a fucking brewery, looking at the, uh, the distillery process.

Speaker 3:          00:19:36       All I look at is like the entire time I'm taking this tour, I could be drinking your product fresh out of your fucking big silver, whatever the fuck you call those things. So a boost it up there. Um, went over to bond Scott's grave like I mentioned. And uh, you know, it's funny when you get there, like people all, it's kind of weird. People leave like all these, you know, bottles of booze there. It's like the guy kind of died from that, you know. I mean, do you somebody overdoses on heroin? Do you leave like fucking used needles there? And it's really weird. But um, I kind of felt bad when I showed up and there was an empty Miller genuine draft bottle next to bond Scott's grave. And the uh,

Speaker 3:          00:20:21       the ACD, not only the ACDC fan and me, the beer lover in me wanted to take it away from the grape, but there was just something about removing something from that place. Just seemed a little a sacrilegious. So I refrained from doing that. But if you ever get to Perth, they have this own little entrance little gateway and you come walk, he says Bon Scott entry or something like that. I took, I'll have all the pictures up on the podcasts. I, I did a retweet some this shit. But you walk in, um, very easy headstone to find. And a, if you look down on the ground, they have like a lightening bolt, like the ACDC lightening bolt in the pavement. And then above it is like a looks like a record. And then they had something else. I forget what it was. Uh, which is really cool.

Speaker 3:          00:21:07       So it just sort of guide you right to it. And um, and then if you go over, down onto the wall, the water where they have the little creatures makes their beer and shit a little bit further up from that. They have a statue of Bon Scott, which I think used to be in the graveyard, but they moved it because I guess back in the day he was a deckhand, a red decky as they call it down here in Australia. So they, uh, they put them down there on the water and um, I don't know. It was really cool. And, uh, what did I go from there? Then I went to Melbourne, I got there and that was a, uh, that's when I saw the Australian Open, did a couple shows that night. And um, evidently some comics came out to see me throughout this tour. I'm glad I didn't know they weren't in the crowd. That would've made me fucking nervous. Um, and I basically been putting together my new hour out here, watching this thing come together, get my fucking standup shops back together again. It's going to fuck just been a great tool. I really want to thank everybody who came out and um,

Speaker 4:          00:22:07       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:22:07       You know, throughout my time here in Australia, this has been a fucking incredible to come out here and play these big venues and be adding shows and stuff. Uh Oh. Then I did Brisbane and um, had a fucking, uh,

Speaker 3:          00:22:24       I don't know how to, one of my best shows I had in Brisbane and then I got all, I got pictures of all this shit. Sorry guys. I'm a little fucking jet lag. I know this shit isn't funny. I'm just kind of go through my fucking tour here. I played city hall. There was one of the best looking theaters I ever played. Literally you could shoot a fucking special there. It was phenomenal. Um, oh, here's what I got a funny fucking story for you. All right. Listen to this shit. So I'm going to fucking security.

Speaker 4:          00:22:47       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:22:47       All right. And they have the reg regular metal detector and then they got the fucking ex-ray one that I don't go through.

Speaker 4:          00:22:54       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:22:55       I don't go through that fucking thing cause I don't give a shit what they tell me. Death thing is not good for you. I remember when it first fucking came out and people were opting out and I remember people going, look, Ooh, it's a big deal. You already talk on your cell phone. Like all that dumb shit that people say. You know? Um,

Speaker 4:          00:23:11       yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:23:12       yeah. It's like, oh yeah, so why don't I get extra radiation, you know, but I just add to it. Just makes sure I get fucking cancer. Right. And what did they say? They tried to say that the thing was totally fucking safe. And then what ends up happening after a year and a half of radiating everybody in my country too much, they realized that they had the fucking thing turned up too high. And to this fucking day, when you go through one of those, if they, if a kids young enough, they fucking send them around because it fucking retards the puberty process or something like that. But I'm supposed to go through it, go fuck yourself. So I always opt out and I don't give a fuck about

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       your opinion on this by the way. I don't need to hear your fucking opinion. This is just my opinion. If you want to go through the fucking thing, more power to you. So I'm down here in Australia and they got the regular one and then they got the fucking, the bad one. So every third person or whatever it has to go through, whatever. So I come up and guess what? They want me to go to the other one and it and I'm like, yeah, I'm opting out and they like, you can opt out in Australia. So now I'm in this fucking thing where I'm challenging authority in a different country, which is always scary. But I just said I'm not, I'm not, I'm not going through it. And the guys starts going like, oh well he goes, do you mind if I ask you why?

Speaker 1:          00:24:27       And I go, yeah, cause he used to work in a dental office and I took fucking x rays and I put a led vest over somebody before I fucking took an x ray and I got cancer in my family, so I don't want to go through it. And he goes, well you can opt out here plus the ones down. Here you go. He goes, this thing is, he goes, ecosystem only sees through your pockets is fucking rent a cop. Like he knows how this fucking thing works, right? Oh, just see through your pockets. Really you fat. Fuck. What do you know about anything other than eating too many fucking donuts? You Do, right? So I say to the guy, I go, well we had the one in the states, they had it turned up too high. It goes, this is a different one. I go, no it isn't.

Speaker 1:          00:25:03       I go, that's the same company. I'm not going through it. He goes, all right, well then you have to stand over there. And I'm like, fine. So the guy fucking makes me stand over there for like 10 minutes. Then this other fucking guy comes walking over and he's got this little fucking, do you know like when you don't like you, when you get your baseball team schedule or your hockey team schedule for the fucking year, he comes over with one with one of those that's like four pages. Most of it is pictures and he goes, if you just want to read up on it, and I'm just started laughing like what? That little kid's book you have there that explains that complex fucking machine over there. And he goes, no. When he explains it, I go, who to? Who explained it? The people who made that fucking thing. I'm obviously not cursing at them, but they just said, you can't fuck an opt out. It's a lot down here. Now, if I had the fucking time and the wherewithal, the presence of mind during that conversation, I should have said, tell me what law it is. Tell me what fucking law that says. I have to go through that fucking thing. Pat me down. We don't do that here. Well you should fucking start

Speaker 1:          00:26:06       fucking unreal. So then I ended up having to go through the God damn thing.

Speaker 1:          00:26:11       The guy was actually nice. He apologized for it and I just said, listen man, I know it's not you. It's, this is what it always is. It's not you. You're just the guy here who has to tell me I have to fucking go through it. But the real cops who were making money off their, who fly fucking private, who never have to go through that thing, don't have to worry about having their entire fucking head all the way down to be a balls in their fucking toes. Radiated. So is if there's anybody out there that it has a fucking scientific background and can explain to me how something that can see through my fucking clothes is not a, it's not a, uh, it's not some sort of an x ray. I mean, Jesus Christ Drinking Coca Cola can give you cancer. You're telling me standing in that fucking thing head the fucking toe puts your arms up. Oh, just shoots beans out yet. It's just looking at what's in your pockets. Oh yes. Is that why you want to come up the other side? There's an entire image of me. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:27:00       I don't know. So whatever. So that was my fucking big goddamn moment. Fucking fat. Fuck. Make, make me stand there for legs. Another thing that they do, that passive aggressive thing is they make you stand there for fucking 10 minutes trying to break your will. No one that you probably late for your flight. I fucking hate myself that I didn't say. You know what? Let me, uh, let me see you at the fucking, uh, once you show me the Goddamn fucking law there. I Dunno. I'm sorry. I'm looking at all these people's tweets now saying, ah

We sit down, we have a nice meal, we shoot the shit and that's fucking it. I don't go to cvs and buy fucking, oh, they'd fucking confetti. Whatever the fuck it is you supposed to do. I don't know. I'm in such a country moved because I missed the super Superbowl. You can't fucking believe it and we want, goddammit, we want, I'm so fucking psyche one on not even winning. I just so site. They don't have to hear it from Seattle fans.

Speaker 5:          00:35:13       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:35:14       so site. They don't want to listen to another fucking Goddamn story about how fucking loud they are and that and nobody addressing that. The stadium is built to make them louder than they really are. Fucking drives me up the wall, but whatever. You know what? This is the first 24 hours, I'm sure Jim or say we'll figure out a way to save somehow we were cheating. All right, let's get into the questions for this week. Everybody. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:35:39       wait, am I told him I fucking stories. I really don't have a lot of stories about here being down here in Australia other than the people are unbelievably friendly. It's really relaxed. It's a ridiculously underrated place to go. And um, for tennis fans, if you want to go to a great city and if you want to go to an unbelievable fucking venue, gold, go to the Australian Open and go into the rod like fucking arena. I mean I went to the u s open like twice, like 10 12 years ago and it's a giant, it's for tennis. It's still a huge, it's really big venue. And you know, we were sitting up top and they were, they know they were very far away. This, this venue, I swear to God, it felt like I was watching it with 600 other people. Like you could hear everything, like Serena would throw the ball up and if you know, like when you throw it up and then you don't serve, you know, you just felt weird. You just grabbed the ball to serve again, he'd literally, here we go, sorry, sorry. Sorry. I felt like I was at her house and she's playing in the backyard or something was amazing. And, um, I would say that Melbourne is probably the, uh, like if you're, I dunno, I would say that that's sort of the New York City of a, of Australia. If I'm going to get shit right now, if I'm just starting to try to compare to this, is this is made knowing very little about their country. That seems like more like,

Speaker 6:          00:37:05       you know,

Speaker 3:          00:37:08       I don't know. We're all like a lot of the, just where all the shit is, you know, and you're not spoiled. New Yorkers are, since they grew up in New York, everything is right there. So when they go every place, they think every place else sucks. I've kind of noticed that Melbourne people kind of think every place else sucks. Um, but, uh, and I think Sydney is more like a touristy place. Both have their merits or whatever. It all depends on what age you are, what you, whatever the fuck you're into. And, um, Brisbane was the shit. I had a great time up there. Beautiful beaches. What do they got? The gold coast or some shit like that around there. I don't know much about it, but it was just a phenomenal place to visit. And I was actually a little melancholy when I was leaving. And also one of the great things is when a comedian, I actually started out with Al del Benny, I got to uh, he married an Australian girl and uh, they relocated to Sydney outside of Sydney about a year ago.

Speaker 3:          00:38:05       And uh, he hit me up out of the blue, asked if he could come down and hang out for a show. And he actually, I throw them on and did about five, seven minutes before each show. And uh, it was great just hanging out with him, talking about the fucking old days, trying to figure out how the hell we became the old guys. Like I saw a thing the other day that, you know, the same like top 20 comics, new comics to watch. So you know, I'm a fan of stand up. I want to see who's coming up. And I probably knew like two of them and um, and I was looking at him like, Jesus Christ, I've been doing stand up since all of these people that they're shown. We're probably like anywhere from two years old to eight years old. So starting to feel my fucking age here.

Speaker 3:          00:38:45       Um, but anyways, um, a New Zealand and I missed the Superbowl, you know, if you're going to miss a fucking Superbowl flying to New Zealand, I got to think is a pretty good. Got It. Thanks is a pretty good excuse. Um, okay. Got To admit being down here and not here in any of the Superbowl hype or any of that type of shift. I really fucking enjoyed it. Did Not miss any of that, any of this shit. Oh, did you hear so and so said this? Somebody said this, blah, blah, blah, blah blah and I fucking crap. I'm so fucking psyched. I miss that. And that's like that Mr Goddamn game. Um, anyways, Australian food. You know what's weird? I'll actually do a recap of the Superbowl when I get back after like February, you know, and I'm back February. Whenever the fuck I get back at, um, I'll watch the game helped do a special, I'll do a special podcast and bid week. How about that? And I'll react to the game. Like it just happened. Yeah. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:39:40       That Jesus film. Anyways, Australian food. Let's get to the, uh, the questions here for this week.

Speaker 3:          00:39:46       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:39:46       Hey Bill, I'd never been to Australia. I've watched my fair share of food network, but I've never heard of authentic Australian cuisine. The whole shrimp on the Barbie thing has to be exaggerated and I'm pretty sure the only people who drank Foster's are morons not living on that prison island. What's the meal you've had so far? Uh, what's the best meal you've had so far and can you give me some insight as to what you think, uh, as to what they're known for

Speaker 3:          00:40:10       down under, down on that.

Speaker 1:          00:40:12       Thanks. And go fuck yourself, dude. I have to be honest with you. I am barnstorming across this part of the world. I land, I do a show and then I go to the airport. Um, occasionally, like today I landed in New Zealand and I have tonight to go out and grab a quick drink. And then tomorrow I have to do the show. Um, I've been doing a lot of press when I've been over here. I haven't really seen or done shit.

Speaker 3:          00:40:35       Um, I've drank a lot. What are they known for?

Speaker 1:          00:40:42       I don't know. The food over here is great to see foods, obviously tremendous. You know what they're really known for over here. I think they're known for their beaches.

Speaker 3:          00:40:48       Um, beautiful people, men, women over here. Yeah. Fucking uh, over and not over here anymore. I'm in New Zealand, but they're fucking gorgeous. But as far as the food was the best thing, I've had a, I got to tell you something, man. I've had some French fries or chips down here. Ordered Room Service. This one fucking hotel, one of the best order of French fries I've ever fucking head. That's the only thing that I can think of that's, that has stood out. Other than that, everything, the food has been great. Um, but I mean, I haven't had any fucking kangaroo or any shit like that. I don't know. I have no idea. Sorry man. MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:41:23       Can you guys tell a fucking jet lag? Diane, I really apologize for this fucking podcast so far. Um, El Camino looking cars in Perth. Okay. Hey Bill, on last week's

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       podcast, you said you saw two guys in El Camino looking cars driving like assholes in Perth. Um, I didn't say assholes. I said driving like people who have el Camino's. Um, in Australia we have cars that we call you and they are similar to the American pickup, but more like a normal sedan. Basically. They are mostly a uni body, like car rather than a body on frame, like a pickup. Do you know, somebody tried to tell me that the pickup was invented by a woman here and uh, well over in Australia.

Speaker 5:          00:42:05       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:42:05       But they used to have what the, what they used to have like these vans sort of looking to hell. They used to call those things, uh, God, my brain is mush this week. Um, what would those fucking things called?

Speaker 5:          00:42:18       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:42:19       Begins with a p those fans from like the 1950s but they had, they had pickups in the 1930s I dunno, whatever. It had more like a van type thing and this woman got sick of fucking back in or something and having to like open the doors and throw hay in the back and she just cut the top off of it. Somebody I guess from the states was over here and saw it doesn't sound right. Does it sound right to me? I doesn't make any fucking sense, but somebody tried to claim that they came up with them over there. Anyways, our division of General Motors is called Holden and they make the commodore, which is the current Camaro which the current Camaro is based on and you can get in the u s as a Chevy s s wait a minute, our Camaro is based on yours or your, your shit's based on our shit. Okay. Don't get it twisted buddy. We came up with the fucking car. We invented the Goddamn car. All right. Then we, I have no idea who invented the fucking car we flew first, didn't we? Other than those French guys who said they flew first.

Speaker 3:          00:43:17       How the fuck would we know what you were doing back then? We'd have to take a fucking ship. Um, well actually the Camaro was the 60s. I Dunno. Actually took a picture of a couple of, uh, some muscle cars over here. Man. It's cool cause they almost look like ours, but they're not, but they still look bad ass and actually found a sleeper. This fucking a mustard colored wagon. Man, that thing was bad ass a algae also try and post that photo. Let me finish reading this thing for Australia. Builds the Falcon a parenthesis. The interceptor from Mad Max was an Xb Falcon, uh, which can also be bought as a u. We have both these cars in Australia for well over 30 years, but unfortunately they will no longer be built here anymore after 2017. Also douchebags love clapped out commodores to Hoon about in case they are cheap. And pretty quick, there's some Aussie slang for you. I have no idea what the fuck he's talking about. Bragging about commodores. Uh, I know you're a Ford Guy, so you should really check out some of the Aussie Bill Falcons throughout the years. Yeah, I actually did that. I looked up and a check them out. I was surprised how much longer you guys built the Falcon. I actually saw a model falcon

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       that looked like a fucking Ford Taurus station wagon when it was outside that little creatures beer place. Um, he goes on to say, and also if you have some spare time you should check out the v eight supercars. It's like Australian, a NASCAR, but they race on a road course. You know, it's funny, I actually mentioned the corvette one night when I was on stage out here that I, I love the corvette and I was thinking about getting one and people had no idea what a corvette, at least the new one, you know, they know what's, I guess some of the old ones aren't. I started just sort of looking for Corvettes when I was in Australia and not a one, not a one. So, you know what, if I lived down on that, you know what I would get? I get that new corvette, z o six habit fucking shipped over here.

Speaker 1:          00:45:10       You'd be the only one on your block, right? And I go fuck and drive around the scare. Some fucking Kangaroos. Alright. Australian woman bill. I have a couple of friends who studied abroad in Australia. They all say that women down down there are unreal. What are your thoughts to make it fair? Because you with the lovely Nia, uh, you or she can comment about the men as well. Fucking hilarious. Uh, no good looking people. Tall, blonde. Um, it's weird. Their eyes, their eyes are you, they have Ozzie eyes. It's weird. It's somewhere between white guys and Asian eyes. You don't like John Denver? That's what I would say. Oh Shit. That's what they got. They got John Denver eyes with blond hair, uh, Tan people, a really good look and fucking, you know, tall, blonde and 10, they get go. I mean, I don't know what Hitler's feelings were about Australia, but I think he would have loved it.

Speaker 1:          00:46:09       You know, if he, if he just, he's such a fucking moron that Hitler, you know, why didn't he just fucking take his easel? Travel abroad? You would have been interesting. You would have had a fucking, you would've had an accent. He could've come down here and got himself some tall drink of fucking water, painted the beautiful beaches, could lived out in a nice quiet fucking life. Right. But now he had to go for the glory. He wanted to get into show Biz Dendy, uh, response to army guy from last week considering marrying girlfriend to get her out of the UK. All right, this is okay. This is this guy last week who was talking about, uh, you know, he was, he was joined the fucking, some branch of the US armed services and he was stationed over in England and the only way he could get his beautiful, perfect girlfriend over to meet him is, uh, to live over there was if he fucking married her.

Speaker 1:          00:47:01       So this is what this guy, this is good. The guy's response here. Hey, burnout. Uh, on the one 26 podcasts, there was a guy you called me. Oh, burn it. B. U. R. R. N. I think it was talking about the guy who's going to get married, right? Hey, burn out on the January 26 podcasts, there was a guy who was worried about getting married in order to get his girlfriend to come to Europe with them. My advice, get legally married, but don't have the ceremony. If you just need some to show you I'm married. This is a great way to avoid the added stress. If you explain that you love her and you want her to be with you, but you're not ready for marriage, she will likely understand. Explain it. You still have a regular wedding later if you decide to make the emotional commitment. Also, the issue of getting a prenup can be brought up to make you feel more secure without her thinking. It's a trust issue. Waiting. What are you saying? Get legally married, but don't have the ceremony so you're already married. Then if you're legally married, does he need to get the fucking prenup?

Speaker 1:          00:48:03       I'll continue reading here. I was in the reverse situation when I want, when I wanted to get married to my girlfriend, she had student loans that would get much more expensive if she was married. So we had the ceremony without the legal contract. We were contact connected without the added cost. Um, later when she needed health insurance, we went to the JP and got her on the insurance. Just separate the legal marriage from the emotional one until you're ready, uh, for the commitments they entail. Thanks to go fuck yourself. Yeah. But then if you're not emotionally ready to get married and then you get married to somebody legally, and then you decide later that you don't want to be married to them, then you're, then you're fucked. And there's no way to bring up a fucking prenup without the other person going like, so just exactly what he was thinking of tapping out. Believe me. Um, all right. Princess or just a lady. All right. What do we got it? Yeah. Uh, Bill, I'm a sweet guy, so hang on. So hang out with this girl. What bill? I'm a sweet guy. So when I hang out with this girl, I often tried to be nice towards her, either with compliments or little acts. For example, sometimes when we're just watching a movie, I'll look at her until she sees me staring and then say, she looks beautiful. Yeah, I'm sure that's not creepy at all. You may be gagging right now, but hey, go fuck yourself. I care about her. The problem is not that,

Speaker 5:          00:49:29       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:49:30       [inaudible] problem is not that she loves. When I do that, the problem is my gift giving a few times now I've walked off campus a short way to pick up her favorite dish from her favorite restaurant. The first time was because she was busy with homework and miss dinner, so I wanted to surprise her and the other was when we were going to hang out around lunchtime in our dorm. I got us both something. I got exposed to something. Then I've also gone to the store when she told me one night how she wishes, how she wished she had this one type of cereal. Oh Jesus, Gee, I wish I had this one type of cereal. And then you go fucking running down the street like fucking mister McFeely speeding. Mcfeely uh, how she needed a blah, blah, blah, some type of cereal and how she needed to go to the store for milk and coffee creamer.

Speaker 1:          00:50:16       While I've only spent like $30 total honor over the past month, my friends wore me. It's either going to get excessive or lose its special touch. I wonder if that's true and what should I do, Bill and have a great day. Uh, just kidding. Go Fuck Yourself. Ps, she's not a manipulative bitch. Uh, she's gotten actually upset that I went all out of my way to get her these things and she told me how she feels very grateful but kind of bad about it. Um, all right, well first of all, I didn't say she would never say that she was a bitch. I don't know. But all women are unbelievably manipulative. They have to be because they can't physically beat the fuck out of us unless they're like, you know, taking that UFC shit, then that's just game set and match because they could already beat you mentally.

Speaker 1:          00:51:00       Women can always be a guy mentally because they fucking work on that. That's all they work on. You know what I mean? They're like a boxer, you know, standing up, just throwing punches and what do you as a guy, you got to learn how to fight. You've got to do all this other fucking shit. You just become a jack of all trades, master of none. Okay, so they fucking do that mental shift their entire Goddamn life. And then they go down to a Dojo, like, can you imagine trying to fucking debate a point with, with Ronda Rousey, how far, how many on how many levels? It would be fucking over as a guy. She could beat you mentally because she's a woman, so she's going to be fucking, she's just going to weigh you down. It's going to be over. Or if she decides or you decided to say something stupid tour, she could then beat the fuck outta here. So I mean, I dunno, I dunno what you say that that's like the ultimate fucking debate. I would say as a guy trying to be a woman in an argument that also holds a UFC belt.

Speaker 5:          00:51:57       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:51:58       Oh my God. Jesus Christ. How many times would you have to get your fucking ass kicked mentally and physically before you even found a weakness? And that would just be fucking brutal. Anyways, going back to this, uh, first of all, dude, I dunno what the fuck you're doing here. You should never hang out with a girl that you like. All right? You got to get it on some sort of, let's, I want to take you out. You're going to ask this fucking woman out. You just going to stare at it and just say, she looks beautiful. Then run down the street and get her some food that's not going to get you where you want to be. Okay. Um, you've been hanging for a month. You're acting like her personal butler and she hasn't said anything like she wants to fucking get with you. I mean, I don't know. I think I feel like the window of opportunity is closing because pretty soon it's going to be weird if you fucking ask her out.

Speaker 5:          00:52:53       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:52:53       Um, I don't want to crush your dreams here. I didn't know what your question is. It says princess or just a lady.

Speaker 1:          00:53:01       What did you say? Uh, well I do all that. Do I think it's going to be excessive? Yeah, I think you're going to be, she's either going to use you, which you said she's not like that or I think you're just going to become annoying or she's just going to treat you as a friend and women don't have a problem looking at you just as like a friend. So then when Sunday you go to ask her out or try to kiss her or something, you're really going to weird her out and the whole thing's going to get fucked up. So, um, I dunno, you know, at some point when she goes, you know, I wish I had some cereal. It's like, well, you know, there's a 24 hour store down. Yeah, the street might just give me some cocoa puffs while you're at it. And you know, something is rude as that sounds for some reason. I Dunno. They respected on some level that you like.

Speaker 4:          00:53:45       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:53:46       I Dunno. But most women, they just don't want some guy that's just like, oh my God, you're beautiful. Could I buy you stuff? As much as they think they want that, they just, they just look at you like you're pathetic.

Speaker 1:          00:53:58       Probably because they know on some level that they're fucked in the head. And the fact that you can't see it, you don't see any flaws. They just, they look at you like this guy's got and you just, his judgment stinks. This is the guy. Then I'm going attach my fucking wagon to somebody with no goddamn judgment who can't read people. And like somehow he's going to bring home the bacon, fry it up in the fucking pan. I don't think he's going to do it. So what I would say, dude is a, yeah, I stopped being her food bitch. All right. Does she wants to, she should go get her fucking self and um,

Speaker 1:          00:54:30       almost think you need to back it off and then you've got to lay it on the line. That's what you got to do back off. Stop buying your shit. Stop fucking hanging out with, they, when they run into would just say, listen, what's the deal with us? Okay. Cause I don't want to just be friends. I like you. I'd like to take you out and I would like to date you. That's what, that's the direction I want to go home. All right. I don't want to fucking hang out with you and go buy your smores even though that's what the fuck I was doing. That's the old me. This is the new me. You see me right now. Look at me.

Speaker 3:          00:59:41       I think I ran out. I had got damn and I read all the fucking questions for the week, right at 59. Look at that. Um, once again, congratulations to the New England patriots sets the podcast for this week. Uh, you know, beyond being a fan, I'm really happy for a Tom Brady and bill Belichick a grant to get his first one, the defense and all those guys to get their fucking rings. It's just, it's just awesome. And uh, you know, whose kidney with Tom last, this fucking one. Then you'd be three and three and all the fucking jerk offs would be seen a bunch of shit about them. And to be honest, this is six Superbowls in a row. This guy drove from behind for the winning fucking touchdown. It ain't his fault. Well actually, no, I can't say that. The last one that's wrote a Welker, I dunno. I don't know who to blame on that one.

Speaker 3:          01:00:29       But, um, five out of six, this guy is always doing the fucking deed. So it's so psyched that the defense finally stepped up and I don't even know the name of the guy that picked off the ball. I never even fucking heard of them. I read his name. I had no idea. So, uh, anyways, my apology to the sports fans that listen to this fucking podcast because, uh, I did not see the God damn game. I can't fucking believe it. Um, but anyways, I'm looking forward to my time down here in New Zealand, um, work in Auckland tomorrow night and I'm working a Wellington and then I go, then I go to fucking Southeast Asia. Man, can you fucking believe that I'm going to be going to Asia? And I already had an an amazing interview as far as like just talking to this guy from Hong Kong and uh, I'm really looking forward to meeting comics in Singapore or Hong Kong and India just to hear their, you know, cause the scenes is so new over there and that type of stuff, it's fucking ridiculous.

Speaker 3:          01:01:28       You know, I did a podcast this week out of India. These guys, two guys called me up, right. Fucking hilarious. Guiding India is going to be fucking hilarious because Indian people seem like my favorite kind of comic where my nothing I like better than somebody who's really smart, but they're fucking silly. And these guys in this podcast for like that as they tried to trick me to get in talking about the fucking government, um, when they didn't have the fucking balls to or whatever, they, they weren't going to do what they tried to get me in trouble over there. Man. It's fucking hilarious. When I called him out on it, they fucking laugh their asses off. It was like, it was like talking to fucking rich vos is some shit from over there. Men that same kind of ball buster. And so I'm just really looking forward to, uh,

Speaker 3:          01:02:14       to that I think it's going to be life changing. And, uh, and then once again, when I, after I'm done with this, this whirlwind tour here, I flied from India over to Dubai connecting Dubai and then I go to New York. So I will literally have flown around the world, which is an unbelievable privilege to be able to do that. So I really want to take the time to thank everybody who sent me emails telling me to come over to these places because it's definitely a life changing experience. And, um, you know, I ran into a bunch of Indian comics at the laugh factory maybe like four years ago or something, three years ago. I can't even tell at this point. And they actually, you know, knew what my, knew my stuff and said that there was people over there that would come see the show.

Speaker 3:          01:02:58       And that's all I need to say. And I'll fucking figure out a way to get over there. And, uh, I actually, when I did that podcast, like they were talking about, you know, they asked me about the Philly thing when I got booed, I was like, you fucking guys saw that over there. They're like, yeah, you know, we do comedy. You know, we fucking watch this shit. So it's a pretty humbling that. So I'm looking forward to it, going to get some dumplings in Hong Kong. I want to get some fucking, you know, it's funny, I, I'm going to ask the people in India where should I go eat? And I was just thinking they're probably sick of Indian food. You know, they're probably going to take me to a Sushi joint or something like that. Cause you know, I want to go over there and get some fucking the best Indian food I ever had.

Speaker 3:          01:03:40       So hopefully that's where they're going to take me. But uh, I'm really looking forward to it. You know, a lot more shows to do a lot more whiskey to drink and I'll do, do you know, they don't fucking have any cigar bars in Australia. That's what this fucking guy told me. And when you go to buy the Cuban cigars, I made a video. I got to show you this, like how fucking hardcore they are. I bought a Cuban cigar and you had to sit outside like a fucking animal smoking this thing outside. Like I smoked a cigar the way Paul Versey smokes a cigar standing out in the street next to a trashcan.

Speaker 3:          01:04:16       Uh, anyways, I don't know what to tell you. Uh, thanks for listening to the podcast. That's it. Congratulations to the Patriots, ed. Seriously, I'm not joking. Condolences to the Seattle Seahawks fans. I know. What the fuck that feels like to have a crushing goddamn defeat. But uh, you'll be back next year. You know, you're gonna fucking great team and fucking organization and I don't give a fuck that you stadium makes you louder and that some of your players did. Roids I don't give a fuck about that shit cause everybody's fucking doing that shit right. There you go. God bless you. Go fuck yourselves. I'll talk to you next week.
