Did you have a good time? Did your blow off your fucking fingers? Um, did you enjoy the 4th of July? You know, first of all, before right out of the gate, right out of the gate, I want to thank everybody that did some dumb shit with fireworks and it had the presence of mind to fucking make a youtube video out of it, you know? So guys like make it just sit down. I was laughing my ass off last night. I went to bed and I was watching people shooting bottle rockets out of their ass, having a Roman candle fights, seen somebody take one to the face. Do you know some guy in Maine lit something off on top of his fucking head and he died instantly. They will like he lit off, they said some a mortar or something fucking insane. What could, what kind of, you know what kind of a fucking asshole would do something like that? He must've had it. There's no way. Everybody knows, once you get up to anything like a pack of firecrackers on your head, you like, that's, that's funny. You're going to fucking kill your ear drums and you know, but you're going to survive. But what, what do you put an [inaudible] in his mouth or something? Well, I don't know, Bill. You fucking brought it up. All right, relax. Let's just look at main guy dies. Fireworks.

Speaker 2:          00:01:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:01:38       All right. Man. Shoots off fireworks from top of his head dies instantly. A 22 year old man was drinking and celebrating the 4th of July. Happy Birthday to America. Don't put it on my head. Happy Birthday to America. I'll fucking lie again. Happy Birthday. Wow.

Speaker 2:          00:01:58       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:01:58       Michael. Oh my God. So many cool. Um, that's how I went down. 22 year old man who was drinking and celebrating the 4th of July. I tried to launch a firework from Trump, is his head, killed him instantly. Authority said,

Speaker 2:          00:02:13       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:14       30 said, you gotta be an authority to say that somebody is fucking dead after the light. Something off on their head. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Claire. Claire the way. Click yes. Yes, he is dead. Well, we kind of knew that he has Brian's all over the sidewalk. Watch your mouth. Watch your mouth woman. It's one of my favorite quotes in sports over the last fucking, I don't know how many months, six months. Watch your mouth woman. When that woman called, uh, ask the Braun what it was like to be a punk ass bitch and then that guy's going to watch your mouth. Woman wants your mouth woman and you know, you would think that the broads would've had such, which have fucking difficulty with it. Like, you know, I realized that she said something derogatory towards him through excuse, go change your Bra Lady. All right. I love that they didn't say anything because even they knew even they knew that I guide. Yeah. That bitch was out of line up just talking shit today. Um, they won't say what kind of firework it was. All right. Apparently he thought that was a great idea that have just when you died in a stupid fucking way, when somebody starts it off when they start your yield eulogy off with apparently. Yeah. Apparently this guy, Todd sticking his head in the garbage disposal was a, you know, going to give him a good buzz. I mean, I'm sorry to bring it up Claire, but you know, how did they even get it in there? Um, his friends said they thought

Speaker 2:          00:03:46       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:46       They thought they dissuaded him from doing it. The next thing they knew, he ignited the firework and he was killed instantly. What the fuck did he shoot off?

Speaker 2:          00:03:58       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:03:58       there was no rushing him to the hospital. There was no Devon left when I got there. She said 25 year old Cody. Jesus Christ. The names of this generation. Huh? Devin Cody jeep wrangler. Uh, Devin was the kind of person who would do something stupid. Absolutely. He was the kind of person who would pretend to do something stupid to make people laugh. Well, he wasn't faking it.

Speaker 3:          00:04:24       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:04:26       All right, so first fireworks fatality, since they legalized fireworks January 1st, 2012, while he just fucked it up for the whole state, it's bad enough. Everyone's on heroin now you're going to give them fireworks. I mean, what next does isis get their own juice store?

Speaker 3:          00:04:46       Come on, people.

Speaker 1:          00:04:49       Over 80% of bottle rockets are shot out of people's anuses in this state alone. This needs to stop.

Speaker 3:          00:05:00       Woo.

Speaker 1:          00:05:03       That's going on in main street right now in Maine.

Speaker 2:          00:05:06       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:05:07       Hi. Do you know me? Of course you don't. I'm your regular housewife here in Maine. My son is on heroin. My other son shot a Roman candle up his ass. I'm sorry to be graphic. He was trying to shoot it out of his ass. But apparently his excitement.

Speaker 2:          00:05:30       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:05:31       Who was getting who? I mean, in order to light the wick, you gotta be able to see it. So I don't know how these things were done when we were kids. We just, we let them and we ran away. We hid under a desk. That's what we did. Devin was a great person. Um, and in New Jersey, a 52 year old man blew off a large piece of his leg below the knee. When he set off a tennis ball size in Montana, Montana, Montana, a 32 year old man was killed. That is billings home. In a fireworks accident involving a mortar tube.

Speaker 4:          00:06:10       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:06:10       All right. At least there was some sort of mortar round. I mean mortar around. I mean, first of all, when you start lighting off shit where your neighbor starts screaming and comment, you know what? What do you think is going to happen?

Speaker 4:          00:06:24       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:06:24       so look up a mortar tube here, everybody. I'm learning about fireworks through the death of my fellow Americans. Um, I spelt motor.

Speaker 4:          00:06:34       All right.

Speaker 1:          00:06:36       Firework, mortar tubes. How about some images? Let me see. What the fuck these things look like. Is there some sort of, all right. All I see is army guys. Yeah, that's not good. You know when, when the shit you're shooting off. Oh, there we go.

Speaker 4:          00:06:56       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:06:56       well there's one that looks like a little barber shop thing. What a fucking dope. He shot that off his head. You know what probably happened, I would guess is that there was some sort of discharge from the bottom end of it and he concussive force, but it seems like there was no Deviney fucking blew his head off. Know Jesus. Want to where to start. I had such a wonderful weekend. Um, I didn't mean this one. I was talking about funny shit I was just talking about, you know, people, they haven't Roman candle fights. Come on, we all did that shit, right? That's, that is the evolution of all weaponry and all right. Anything that has an explosive device, anything that, that, uh, it's explosive device. Anything that, that fucking blow shit up. You just, you start or do you anything that you can shoot at a target? It always starts simple. Let's light it off. You know, let's, let's point it in that direction at the trees,

Speaker 4:          00:07:55       right?

Speaker 1:          00:07:57       And then what? Then you move up to a, let's torture some insects. Uh, let's shoot a bird. And eventually,

Speaker 1:          00:08:06       because you know, the way human beings are that we always try to top one another and we get bored, which is the reason why we went from walking to the horse to the car. I'm really in deep right now. I know. I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. Eventually you're going to move to the, the, the ultimate prey, the human being. You know, something that can think the same way. You do something that may have done better in math than you did. You know, that's the challenge. This person passed Algebra. I did not. We're both trying to kill one another is, you know, first outside, inside, last, going to come into play here when we're out in the woods are opposite angles being congruent? Is that going to be the death me or do I just have that extra something? Do I want it a little bit more? Am I able to block out the fifth commandment? Do I have such a strong religious background that I can hear God's voice in my head telling me that I'm right telling me to deliver?

Speaker 2:          00:09:15       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:09:16       that animal, so he met a man anymore. It's a fucking animal. Deliver that animal

Speaker 1:          00:09:23       in the express lane to its maker. Right? Do I have that? I mean, it's inevitable. That's personally why I don't fuck with fireworks. I don't fuck with fireworks because I know that I am scatterbrained and I get bored easily and I have 10,000 fucking hobbies and eventually lighting it off on the driveway is not going to be enough for me. Okay. I have neighbors. I have neighbors that I get along with. Maybe I'm bored with the fact that I get along with them. Maybe I want to stop. Maybe some days you just wake up and you just want to start some shit and you just happen to have some fireworks that don't just blow up. They go way up in the air

Speaker 1:          00:10:09       and you want to shoot somebody. Right. Okay. Anyways, uh, my condolences to anybody who knows somebody that died and I don't have any condolences for the people that die because you're fucking dead and you are either dead or I think you were in a better place because someone who's dumb enough to blow themselves up on the July 4th weekend with their own goddamn explosives, I don't think ever had the brains to really hurt another human being knowingly. I never knowingly, Lloyd knowingly hurt another fucking human being. I mean, honestly, if you're that fucking stupid, obviously could go out and you could hurt somebody, but you know, do you really have the mental capacity to understand, you know, your actions.

Speaker 2:          00:10:55       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:55       It's gotta be one of the dumbest fucking things you could ever do.

Speaker 2:          00:10:59       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:10:59       Take something of that level. You know what it is. I really think it's the fucking, while they don't, there's no video of it.

Speaker 1:          00:11:06       I was thinking this is the youtube generation where you know, everybody's basically on TV is that fucking skinny blood disease to cont who painted the soup cans and everybody flipped out over Andy Warhol, one of the most overrated, overrated fucking artists of all time. All right. I almost said, I'm sorry, but I'm not sorry. I'm not sorry. That fucking jerk off drugging up people and banging them in the ass and then fucking drawing a soup can. I mean, if that's, if that's an artist in your world, then you know what? There's a lot of artists in prison right now. They're fucking tasty. Jacquez, you know, he was the original hipster, you know, didn't have the balls to fucking strike out and do something new. He just sort of mocked it just by the way, did anybody see the last two episodes of the comedians? Ah, did anybody with Josh Gad and Billy Crystal, I fucking love that show. And uh, this is a mini spoiler alert. Basically Josh gets caught talking shit about Billy crystal in his act and uh, then they still have to do what they gotta do promos to do. The upcoming is through the fight that they fucking have is great. And, um, Billy Crystal's character and makes fun of Joshua's like fucking hipster friends and such a fucking

Speaker 1:          00:12:50       just beautiful way, eloquent way, and just really sums up that whole when your creativity is just mocking whatever exists, it's such a pussy place to create from because at some point that's what I always do whenever I watched somebody, like even one more time watching somebody that went on on TV

Speaker 1:          00:13:10       and they just mark the artist's stand up, you know, which on on a certain level was funny, was basically doing all the, I don't know what is, what is the word in the industry, the tropes, the Hacky fucking, you know, setups and all that type of shit. Did all of that. But you know, after a couple minutes it's like, okay, I get it. I get it. There's some tried and trued fucking paths that you could walk down and as a comedian, all right, if you so adept at seeing that shit, why don't you show all of us the new road? And that's what those hipster cons never do. They never, they don't cut, they don't carve out any new ground. They just stomping all over shit that's already been done, making fun of it. So I actually, you know, it's weird to me it's because there's so much of that.

Speaker 2:          00:13:54       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:55       During this period of time, you know, like whenever, in 20 years from now, when this generations of directors makes their fast times at Ridgemont high, they're fucking dazed and confused. You know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          00:14:08       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:09       No, actually fast times at Ridgemont high took place in the 80 so that was actually very current. But I'm just saying how, you know, when the nineties to seventies became the strategy, can you made fun of all the clothes and the fucking hairstyles and all that in the two thousands and people made fun of the 80s and now people kind of mocking the 90s what are you going to mock now? People mocking the decades before. Like that's what people did in this. There's gotta be something. I know what that did. I see. What will they do? They'll do a DJ music and being too hard on this generation. They got their own stuff. They get math. Every generation has to have their own drug. By the way, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:14:43       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:43       And heroin, a little bit old. Something old, something new.

Speaker 1:          00:14:48       Something borrowed. Something blue. Right? So what he did a, they get the math. That's the new thing, right? The old things. Heroin, something borrowed. They're mocking all this shit and something blew. That's when they fucking Odie and they don't have any oxygen in their blood anymore. Jesus Christ. Bill, what are you doing poetry over here? Um, I'll tell you right now, that was a solid 15 minutes and 15 seconds of absolute horse shit. And you know what? You sat there and listened to it. That's what you're doing today. Two days after the fucking birthday of America when we kicked England's ass. Jesus Christ. Fucking England. Isn't it amazing that that little ass fucking island, that there was full of so many fucking evil white people that they could actually actually kind of took over the world for a while? We're actually, there was way less people. It wasn't there.

Speaker 1:          00:15:48       You know, most of the places they went to, you know, they weren't, uh, they weren't as advanced, right? This is where a white guy gets in trouble for saying some racist shit. You know what I mean? I'm not trying to say that you know, your boats weren't as good as their boats. I wasn't there. Okay. And in a lot of ways, cultures that were considered primitive, if we continued to live that way. I want to ask you, do you think that the planet would be in the, the, the, the, the polluted state that it is? I don't think it would be, but I'll tell you this right now. I would already be dead. I would already be dead, you know, which for me, selfishly, I'm glad we continued to advance and pollute the fucking world, you know? But that's just a selfish fucking move. I should, I should have said like, you know what? I wish it stayed the same. And I died of a ruptured appendix when I was 12 years old under a stack of blankets, sweating in a fucking log cabin, log cabin, too advanced, too many trees in a hot may not have the skins of the animals that ate throughout my life, my life. I was going say my lives, my life.

Speaker 1:          00:17:00       I was actually trying to think the, I was watching something the other day and uh, I've been doing this weird thing where I fucking start to nod off watching TV and then I wake back up, back up again, and then I start thinking like that. I just watched that or did I just dream that? And then I always do the math and I was like, that is way too fucked up to have been on television. I must have just been dreaming. And then I never have the presence of mind to fucking write it down. You know what I mean? I'll tell you, it'd be fucking insane as we could actually make a movie that made people feel like they were dreaming. Right. But you knew you were dreaming, but you couldn't wake up. Am I describing a coma right now? Am I awake? Can you guys hear me? Hear me, hear me? Um, okay. Closest thing to that would be, I guess we'd be movies like Jacob's ladder. Jacob's fought Gandel. That movie was fucked. That movie's still great. I watched that the other day. Very underrated movie starring a, the guy from shark, Tim Robbins, the guy he used to be married to Susan Surandon. Oh, crush. Two names in a row there. I saw Susan Surandon recently in a movie with a, I want to say Melissa McCarthy. I don't even, I don't remember. All I know is she was fucking hilarious. Oh, it was Melissa McCarthy. She was fucking hilarious. Fucking hilarious. Um, it has what's Melissa has always. So anyways, speaking of lady luck, be a lady two night.

Speaker 5:          00:18:45       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:18:45       you won the ladies World Cup.

Speaker 5:          00:18:48       Okay

Speaker 1:          00:18:49       baby. You stuck dead ball and the mother fucking goal and you won the World Cup for the first third fucking time though. Fucking man. Have any even wanted one. It isn't fair. It is not right. Why do all leave the ladies with the fucking World Cup while all the guys got their soccer balls on ice? Sorry. Um, the ladies World Cups. I actually fucking really got into it. And by really getting into it, I kept forgetting it was on, but whenever I saw it I kept going, you know what? I'm going to watch this. I saw Japan versus Australia. I Japan obviously one that one, cause they played the lady to the file, you know the fucking women had. Um,

Speaker 5:          00:19:46       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:19:47       The women had what? Three goals in the first four goals and like the first, I don't know how many minutes, like five minutes or something like that. I missed it. Of course I was out. Uh, what was I do? I was playing drums. You know what I mean? I was doing that shit and then he fucking came back. This is what I do. I look like a fucking eight year old. I should have died when I was 12. What am I doing here? I'm walking around like a big kid, you know, I to have a bio shit, have a fucking pacifier. The way I live my fucking life. It was, he goes, Weirdo guys, you know, they can't let go. They fucking childhood. Remember on Opie and Anthony one time we were watching these things and they fucking walking around in diapers and then mothers treats him like a big baby. Jesus Christ.

Speaker 5:          00:20:28       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20:29       You know what I mean? That's the one good thing. If Hitler lived the one good thing, if Hitler lives, people who want to be adult babies would would have been exterminated. That's the only good thing. That would be the only time Hitler got it right. You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:20:50       That you'd take out child molesters and all we know beyond a shadow of a doubt that guilty. You got the guy dead to rights lane in a fucking play pen playing with the mobile mobile. One of those fucking things that hang over. You had shell, Exxon, what do you call those? Fucking thinks immobile. A Menorah Menashe. What the fuck is it called? You know what it is? The things that hang over and the kids look at it cause they haven't like a fucking acid trip. Dude. That would be the ultimate drug. Don't worry ladies, I'm going to get back to the women went in the soccer. I got a lot to say about that. Or football as they call it, around the world. That would be the ultimate fucking drug is if you could take something that erased temporary temporarily erased everything you've ever learned in life and you could go back to being a baby again. Like the first time it opens its eyes and you're just staring at a chair. Like what in the fuck is that? Is that my mother? Is that edible? I mean, you know what I mean? Like cause I heard when baby's first opened their eyes, it is, it's like an acid trip. When they're taken in all the colors, light in every, they don't know what the fuck. They didn't want that fucking, they don't want their own hands are sit there staring at the hand. Can you imagine,

Speaker 1:          00:22:07       can you imagine the wonderment of that? That's why, that's why babies need diapers. Cause there's, there's, they're on such a trip that you, if you could fucking do, then you looked at every no, you shit yourself. Cause you don't even, you don't even want a toilet is,

Speaker 2:          00:22:22       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:22:22       he'd never been teased for shitting yourself. You'd never even smelled the shit. You have no fucking idea what it smells like. You just have to shit and your shit.

Speaker 2:          00:22:32       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:22:32       You know what tie do it nice. You fucking end zone. You just bury in threes like Steph curry, except we hit all of them where he only missed two out of a hundred but you bury all of them because you don't know that it's fucking practically impossible. Tell you right now, if I was running a basketball team, might sign a baby. You know, get him up on his feet. Just get them up and his feet. Okay? Keep feeding this kid. All right. This is the new triangle offense. Okay? We got the fucking baby right at the point. We're going to keep fit and keep working it around to him. All right. [inaudible] kid, kid over here. Hey. Yeah. Oh yeah. You just keep launching it. Everybody under the fucking me. You just keep fucking throwing up, right? Be like when the nuggets decided not to play defense and they thought that they were going to have the first 200 point game.

Speaker 1:          00:23:23       What am I talking about now? Fuck you. I got an hour to fill here. I don't have any fucking advertising copies, so this is just going to be me just running my fucking Yap for as long as I can. Um, all right, so back to the ladies. The ladies of women's soccer, the soccer playing human beings that have the, the, the lady bits. All right. Um, so they scored four goals. Of course I missed all the fucking goals. The only goal and was 41 the only goal I saw was when Japan all of a sudden cut it to four to two when I was like, oh fuck, is this like Nhl hockey were no lead is safe anymore. And then the ladies came right back down and gave Japan the old right there. Fred, they gave me all right there. Fred Bam. Shut the fuck up. Go home. Go home crying because you just lost all right now.

Speaker 5:          00:24:15       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:24:16       let's look at, yeah, I actually, the sound into motor sports nerd. I am even a sport that now don't even admittedly do not even watch or don't watch it nearly as much as I should because it is a beautiful sport. Especially the way that women play it. I actually prefer women's soccer to men's soccer. Why you say over there? Jolly Old England, Ireland, a WEF, fucking Argentina, Brazil, Germany, all this fucking soccer giants. Football. I'll tell you why I preferred because the women don't dive every three seconds crying like a bunch of babies.

Speaker 5:          00:24:53       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:24:54       Like when the women go down, like they fucking, you know, they got tripped up and then they, they look at the ref like, what the fuck you going to call that? I thought the women play down. They play a better game. They just play a better fucking game. I'm sure the men, right? This is a little faster, fucking blah, blah, blah, blah. But all the God damn fucking whining and crying and men's soccer gonna tell you right now, men's football players, you gotta be ashamed of yourself. And that goes for you too. They're fucking Rooney or whatever you fucking name is there. And Man United. All right, look in like fucking, I don't want to fucking what?

Speaker 1:          00:25:35       Champs Sport, whatever the fucking characters name is. Sorry. All right, let's just fucking plow ahead here. Yeah. The women, don't fucking cry be two seconds, but I will tell you this. What is fucking funny is when they lost Japan's goalie just started crying. I mean the defense sucks. The defense had a total fucking meltdown. I don't know what the Lady's coach saw, but whatever it was, they exploited it fucking three times in the first five minutes. And the only bad goal was when they actually shot one from center ice. And uh, the goalie looked like me playing right field when I was in fourth grade. Like, oh, it's going to drop in for a single room. Come on, come on. Maybe all shit. It's over my head. Remember that when you totally misjudged it. Second it hits the bat, you start running in towards the first baseman and then, I don't know, and I'll tell within three steps you do that fucking just immediate stop. And then all of a sudden your head's back at a 45 degree angle is that ball just keeps going up over your head. That's what she did. And what's funny is she leaped up in the air with the one hand to try to stop it,

Speaker 1:          00:26:56       and when it went over ahead head, she just fucking landed on our entire backside and you could already see her just going fuck. And in the end of the game, I guess she felt that she caused her team the victory, which she didn't. It was absolutely horrific defense. She just burst out crying, which is one of the beautiful things about being a woman. You know, when you look at a baby, all right boy or girl, you know they want something, you know that's yours, something of value when you take it away so you can't have that and they want it, they immediately, or you can just start fucking crying. They're upset, they don't like what's happened and they immediately, they just cry it out. When we can do that, women can do that and you feel bad for if a man cries another man, the only thing you can do is just laugh in their face and tease them until they stopped doing it because it makes you so fucking uncomfortable as a man. The only time it's acceptable is when your friend blows his head off with a mortar round. Whenever the fuck he did at a, at a, uh, you know, and a 4th of July party. And even then,

Speaker 2:          00:28:16       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:28:16       even then, you know, you got to shake it off within a couple of Miller high life there.

Speaker 2:          00:28:23       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:28:23       You know. All right, cliff. He's dead. Okay. It's not going to bring them back. We still got all these beers. What is the difference? If we'd say it now or in the morning, he's going to be just as dead in the morning. We're running out of ice. We got to finish these sinks. And you're like, you're right. You're right. Sorry. Why would he do that? Sorry. Um, cheeky. That's the thing about women. They can just fucking cry and we're not allowed to and it's that combination that they are allowed to cry out their pain and we have to hold onto it. And the fact that they then turn around and Nag the fucking shit out of us, that they actually take 10 years off our lives. Do you realize that if women died 10 years before men did, can you imagine how much they be complaining about that? How much they would be blaming us for it? You know, when we say that we die, you know men die 10 years earlier. They just blame us. Well, you know, you don't, you hold onto your emotions. You don't go to the doctor. Yeah. And what about the current factor?

Speaker 1:          00:29:34       Uh Huh. Anything there? Can you, if I'm sweaty, got, if you turn the fucking tables and women died average of 10 years

Speaker 6:          00:29:42       before men did. All right. What color, what pansy colored uniform with the NFL players have to wear for an entire fucking month as they raised awareness, how much would they be blaming us? How many movies would Meryl Streep Win an Oscar for? Playing the woman that was strong enough to die at the same time as the guy in her life? I don't know. You know what's funny about guys in the beauty of guys is we still, we don't even give a shit. We die 10 years sooner than you do and we don't even give a fuck. It's the beauty of this simplistic man brain.

Speaker 2:          00:30:19       Okay.

Speaker 6:          00:30:20       Um, anyway, so let's plow ahead here. Uh, so women's World Cup soccer has been around since 1991 and as of yesterday, the United States of America, we've won the most, we've won three once. Germany has one too. I'm spice. Norway has one, one the death metal capitol of the world. And Japan has one, one Japan actually when the last one. So we different the champions. Alright. Um, men's World Cup soccer, there's only been so wait, wait, women's World Cup soccer, there's only been five, six, seven times it's been played. All right. This is why I'm finally gaining respect for this. I always get had respect for the championship because the entire world does compete, but not only does the whole world compete, they do it every four years. So it's really, it really fucking mean something here. And all these people around the world who are going like, yeah, Bill, you'd dumb fucking Yank it. Yeah, it means something. Well, you know what? Maybe if you guys want a bunch of fucking girls flopping all over the fucking place and you could actually pick it up with your hands. The fuck did, I don't understand a sport where you have four fucking limbs and you only allowed to use two of them. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:31:43       Jesus Christ. It's like, it's like, it's like you're mocking the handicap the entire time. I'm watching the fucking game. Anyways. Sorry. So this is only been 20 men's world cups. All right. Brazil is one the most at five. Italy and Germany. You have both one four and I got to give the nod to Germany. As much as I love Italians, the way they dress their food, they're flashy fucking jewelry. I'm all about it. I love Italians and I am fucking German. I got to give the nod to Germans because they won their first three with half of fucking country. They won their first one. Let's let me look this up. Let me make sure that I have this correct. Um, they won their first one, I think in 1954.

Speaker 6:          00:32:35       I mean, that's literally like, what is that like about nine Yeoman? Less than a decade. Yeah. They formed their first one in 1954 world war two ended in 45 46 something like that. 1944 maybe we'll say 45 what the fuck? Within nine years of trying to take on the entire world and losing Dresden and bombs all over the fucking place. They, they won a world cup with half their country, West Germany. You know what I mean? I'm sure East Germany was actually in it to who's getting know Jeremy is just, I mean that is just a roid factory over there. 1974 they want it.

Speaker 2:          00:33:21       Okay.

Speaker 6:          00:33:22       They are, they were on, they were on. They were doing so many steroids by 1974 dad, a lot of people don't know this, that West Germany team was actually 80% a women. A lot of people don't know that. East Germany, east German women, you know, they were so write it up. They didn't have to sneak out of the country. They just stare down the people in the guard tower and they were just like, Amen. I don't want any problem, bro. All you, all, you, you want me to open that gate for you? Okay. Um, 1990 they want it. All right, let's get back to what the fuck I was talking about here. Uh, what the hell did it go? Oh, there we go. Alright. Uruguay as one to Argentina. Hand at God. One, two, and then England, France and Spain have all one one. And that is it.

Speaker 6:          00:34:15       It's only been one 20 times and one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight countries. Only eight countries have one. So now I feel better that the u s a men's have never won a fucking world cup. You know, most people given a shit. It's like, well how many did you fucking win? You'd never want it either. And I love that. I now know who's won it and who hasn't. So I've ever walked into a soccer sports bar. I know who I can talk shit to and who I can't to. What are you? Huh? You from Brazil. Oh, Chile. Oh, go fuck yourself. You ever won? Shit either. What's your big butchy big feather in your cap that she care? Um, which makes the women winning three, all the more impressive, but you got to give it up to Germany. Germany is the only country that has won both the men and the worlds in, in the women's and they've won for men's and they've won two women and they were only off by one and bolts. You got to respect to Jesus Christ. When is Bryant Gumbel real sports going to be doing a what's in the water, what's in the water over there and fucking Germany. He know why they're not going to do it. Cause we have a base over there. We already know what's in the water. A van of fucking steroids. I got to tell you, it's amazing, you know,

Speaker 6:          00:35:43       to watch Germany channel all their hatred for other races and nationalities and and put it into something more productive like sports and look at the success that they've had. You know what I mean?

Speaker 5:          00:35:57       Bad Burning Passion

Speaker 6:          00:36:01       to incinerate people that aren't, that don't look like them. The fact that we've been sitting on their fucking chest for the last 60 years, they've had to to, to focus that energy in different areas. And they are dominating the world, game of soccer, football, whatever, and look at the cars that they make. It's incredible. If you've noticed all the fascist countries make the greatest cars, Germany,

Speaker 5:          00:36:29       fuck in Italy.

Speaker 6:          00:36:32       Who else? Finland. They don't make good cars. They make good phones for a minute. But look at them. Angry birds. They made those angry birds. You know what I mean?

Speaker 5:          00:36:44       Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:36:45       All of a sudden they couldn't exterminate the people. They didn't want to exterminate near country. What did they do? They said, all right, what, uh, what are we going to do with all this? Hey, what do I have to make some phones? Sorry. Can't do a fucking Finland accent. Actually, I give fin when a pass for being down with the h bomb in a, in a World War II. I, uh, you know, what were they supposed to do? You know what I mean? This ship was like, all right, where we are geographically, you look to the right, you got Adolph Hitler with beads of sweat. There's bdis in his fucking eyebrows. [inaudible] or are you against us? Right? And on the other side, they got, uh, eastern Europe's Tom Selleck, the one and only Joseph Stalin or Yosef, if you're a history buff,

Speaker 5:          00:37:33       okay.

Speaker 6:          00:37:34       Staring you down. Right? This motherfucker would sacrifice 100,000 Russians every day just so we can have fresh pineapple juice. I mean, this guy was a fucking maniac. They will, they will between too. They were stuck between two of the biggest psychos in the history of, of in modern history. All right? So they had to go with self preservation.

Speaker 5:          00:37:56       All right.

Speaker 6:          00:37:58       Hitler's style and equally out of their fucking minds. All right, so that's a wash and what's the next thing? All right, let's go with technology. German cars. What do we got? What do we got going on here? They got their Mercedes Benz, they got the Duesenberg. Did they make the Duesenberg? I don't know what the fuck they had. They had fucking, I'm they, you know, they got, they got, they got a, they make an eight track tapes over here fucking 50 years before the gout. 40 years, 30 years before the fucking be, Geez, what are we supposed to do here? They got real real machines. You go over to Russia, what do they get? They got vodka. They got a God damn fucking made with

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       a lawnmower engine spitting out blue smoke. And they, you know, they got, you know, they've got those checks with the fucking lousy to watch. You know, by the way, Russian women have really come around, Huh? Jesus Christ to fucking gorgeous. Now back in the day during the Cold War, maybe those are the only women that they showed us. They all had those fucking Popeye, the sailor man. Boop, boop, fucking forearms. You know what I mean? From throwing calves over some fucking hill. They weren't supposed to run over. So whatever. So Finland goes, you know what? Fuck it. We'll go on with the h bomb, you know, but we'll have it up. Boom. They went with him by flashlight gas chambers. They fucking went with this maniac. What were they supposed to do? They fucking pick the wrong guy. And you know what's funny was Russia actually attack Finland in Finland, kicked their fucking ass with no help from the Germans as far as what I overheard and bars and Finland, and this is the funny thing, but they went down with the ship with the h bomb over there. Right. They went down with that guy who fucking pussied out and killed himself in the end. This fucking broad. Rather than going out like Saddam Hussein talking shit is they put the rope around your neck.

Speaker 2:          00:39:59       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:40:00       Even people heckling you was still, he's still add them on their heels. Huh? For me that's like a, like when you know, when people bring up comics getting fucking heckled and that type of shit and people like to watch it, the ultimate one, like if I was a dictator, I would be looking at how sit down was saying when I'll be like this motherfucker here, right there. Right. And everybody La, what about Hitler? You know, we killed all those people. Like that's probably be respected with fucking, you know, dictators like that's how many HBO specials you had. Like how many fucking people you killed. They, but you know, all evil people are going like, ah, man, like his fucking amazing numbers that he had. It's like, yeah, but he went out like a bitch. You know, he went out like a bitch just like Gaddafi went out like a bitch pleading for his fucking life. So now I'm going to say, walked right up going, yeah, go fuck yourself. Fuck you. I'm going to come back. I want a hot chill. Right? He fucking stare at them all down. He didn't give a fuck standing there, stepped onto that thing. No one at any second, they could pull the fucking lover. He wasn't even shaken.

Speaker 2:          00:41:06       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:41:07       He was staring them all down. Go Fuck. He wasn't even nervous to meet his maker. It's one of the sickest things I've ever seen in my life. Um, what am I talking about? So they fucking, they beat, they beat the Goddamn Russians, but because they, they picked the wrong guy.

Speaker 2:          00:41:24       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:41:24       You know what I mean? That's like when you were in the wrong division in baseball, you have like back in the day, you know, you'd have a better or I want a pill in that year when the patriots 11 and five, but they didn't make the fucking playoffs. That's what, that's what fucking Finland did. And they actually had to give up even though they beat the Russians. They didn't have that. They still had to give him some land. How fucked up is that? Oh, war. All right. I hope some of that was even just remotely historically accurate. I have no idea. As long as it's entertaining. Did it entertain you? All right. So anyways, I had, I had an amazing weekend. I had an amazing weekend. Um, I uh, you know, it had some family came in and for the first time ever I, uh, I gave a helicopter ride to some family members.

Speaker 1:          00:42:13       I went up with the fucking uh, instructor though, cause I'm on a moron. But we did this great flight. We flew out of Long Beach, we ran around the palace Verdes peninsula. It's great man. You fly right over the Queen Mary. And then you go around the peninsula and then as you go around the peninsula, that's when you start realizing how many goddamn things are in the ocean, even though we fucking fished him out. And we started going along the beach and I thought they were dolphins and my instructors going, no, those were actually baby great, great white sharks. They just haven't reached the predatory stage yet. And I swear to God there was like five of them. Um, and there was one and there's all these people frolicking in the fucking water. And there was this one jackass who had swam beyond where they were. Um, they were perpendicular to him, but he was further out into the ocean.

Speaker 1:          00:43:02       They were closer to the beach. I hope I'm explaining this correctly. And he was swimming out to like a bully like that naked chick in the beginning of jaws. Um, yeah, I said it a million times. You're out of your fucking mind. If you swim in the ocean, if you don't believe me, take a helicopter ride, have him fly a hundred feet off the fucking ocean. I know you're thinking bill, once Jesus Christ. And went the how fucking nuts and they have a 2100 hour fucking overhaul. It's a brand new helicopter every 2100 hours, go fuck yourself. What I'm doing is infinitely more safe. All right. Um, and then we uh, made a right turn at the Ferris wheel on Santa Monica Piers. We flew over Santa Monica over Beverly hills right over fucking Aaron de Aaron Spelling Mansion, which is the most ridiculous house ever built that I can think of. Do you know that house was so big?

Speaker 1:          00:43:53       I saw a thing one time they did it on the Aaron Spelling House. They actually have a room in there just for wrapping gifts to have a gift wrapping room. You know what I mean? To me, I always thought that the people who do American horror story like that would be a great place to do one of those things. People that are that level fucking rich and then somehow the kid, the children and the poor people that put together all the things that they wrap in there somehow come and haunt him. I have no idea, but feel free to send that to the producers over there so they can fucking laugh you out of the Goddamn Room. Um, and who doesn't like watching a fucking rich person

Speaker 6:          00:44:32       get haunted and die a horrific death? I mean, it's just fun. I mean, that's a fucking home run right there. American horror story. You know, you don't have to give me any money. All I ask is if you use it, just give the Monday morning podcast the fucking shout out. That's all. That's all. Just have somebody tells somebody else to go fuck themselves and have them wearing an orange wig and I'll be happy right there. That'll be enough for me. Um, all right. Plowing ahead here. Uh, in the playboy mansion is right to the left of it. Then we flew up, um,

Speaker 6:          00:45:07       to the Hollywood sign over the observatory, did a lap around dodger stadium and then my favorite part ever, we flew up route to bang the left up and over the hill. And where is it at? Eight at grand daddy of them all flew over the fucking rose bowl and then went right back. Took right down, back down to a long beach. Um, it was fucking awesome man, but flew in what's called an our 44 Robinson 44 some day. You know what I mean? Some day I want to get one of those. Um, when I get a little more, uh, confident and I also have the kind of money to blow on a fucking helicopter. I imagine I don't have to drug my wife on some level. There's a lot of, there's a lot of, you know, variables as a man to buying a helicopter. Like the amount of fucking money and and

Speaker 6:          00:46:03       hand is, they sit on Seinfeld, the amount of hand that you, you got to have hand in a relationship that you'd have to have to fucking justify buying a helicopter when you really have nowhere to go in the thing. So anyways, don't get a used one on fucking craigslist. Damn. Things are awesome. Um, all right. So guess what? Last night was my last cigar and my list. I'm taking a booze break. Old Billy clean cakes is back in the house. I got a nice round white belly from, uh, you know, grilling, drinking. I had a great fucking weekend and I mad my own grill man, my own Grill Aza. Man Does. Even if you don't know how to do it, even if you're, you, you risk giving the people at your party eat Kolai it doesn't make a difference. You are a man and you fucking human your own goddamn grill. Um, I, I kept it simple. I've just made burgers and hot dogs and what's fucking amazing is we got this butcher, um, in the next neighborhood over from us and they make their own.

Speaker 4:          00:47:14       Okay,

Speaker 6:          00:47:14       you can order homemade hamburger buns and hot dog buns. They made us like the hot dog buns. They came in like a, it looked like ribs except they will hot dog buns. And you had to cut them to separate them and then cut them again to make them, you know, to them. So you put the hot dog in. It was fuck, I felt like it was like the 1920s assumption, you know what I mean? Everything was homemade and boy, oh boy, was it refreshing. Um, so anyways, uh, let's get to, let's get to some of the questions here, um, for this week. Yes. So I am, I am announcing it on the fucking podcast because uh, that I am not drinking or smoking or anything like that, so I will stick.

That's what they should do. They should just let everything fail and then, then everybody's money isn't worth shit. And then you know something, those bankers got to come out in public and then you fucking stab them in the gut. Like that dude at the beginning of Scarface, right? Leading gap lay band, gap, uh, Greece. Vote. Let's see what, come on, man. Come on Greece. You know, they didn't mark is resilient after no vote. Uh, and we always plus the out.

Speaker 6:          01:00:35       We always pussy. Everybody always ends up pussy and out. You know, something. Only fucking Iceland has had the balls to stand up to their fucking bankers. And you know what? I hope I'm wrong about that. And if I am, please tell me who else has. All right, no idea where to start. Dear Mr Burr, I'm a 16 year old high school, junior from a rural town in Mississippi just to good old bar they ever made in no hall getting the conferred or red flag, birthday cake every fuck and see x months because his parents are too dumb to know what a year is. You're not even 16, Buddy. You're really fucking a sorry. That was totally stereotypical and I shouldn't have done that. Um, now that I'm nearing my final year of high school and will soon be having to decide where to go to college, I realized I have no idea what I want to do with my life.

Speaker 6:          01:01:32       The only two things I have interest in his writing and standup comedy, unless those are two phenomenal things you can make a hell of a living. I flunked everything in high school. Uh, but here's a few places from where I live, but there's a few places from where I live where I could do something like an open mic and Jesus Christ. But you know some that should inspire you right here, right here. How awful. I am at reading out loud yet I've been able to do something in this business. You know what I mean? I'm able to make a living and, and I can put frosted mini wheats on the table for my family of one. I'm the only two things I am interested in is running standpoint, but there's few places from where I live where I could do something like an open mic or get honest opinions on my comedic writing. I'm writing to ask, in your opinion, would be a great town for starting, for starting convenient to start. Uh, also if you think someone can juggle college in a standup, do you think someone can juggle a stand up in a car, a college, in a standup career? I would truly be grateful for your advice and also go fuck yourself. I'm all right.

Speaker 6:          01:02:38       Any place is a good place to start. Just start. If there's an open mic, I would drive

Speaker 6:          01:02:44       as long as I had to drive to go to it. Um, let's see. You're in Mississippi. All right. What do I, what do I know about down there? I mean, the closest thing that I know of from Mississippi, Atlanta and Nashville, uh, Texas. Houston was always a great comedy town. I don't know what the open mic scene is like. If anybody, anybody, any comedians out there starting out and even buddy, anything going on in Alabama, what's going on in Mississippi, right in give this kid some fucking advice. Uh, tweet me about it. I'll retweet it. That's the easiest way to do it because we might not see your emails because we get a bunch of them. So just tweet me about it. And, uh, you know, at Bill Burr on Twitter and if you got some good advice, I will retweet it. Um, can you juggle college and a standup career? Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. Um,

Speaker 6:          01:03:44       you can do whatever you want to do in life, dude. You can do whatever you want. That's the one fucking thing. Everybody, you know, you know, cause people want to make it, they try to look at what is working for the most people and then they, they get locked into that. I, that's the biggest advice I can give you is do not get locked in to what everybody else is doing. Get locked into what's going on in your fucking chest, whatever that thing saying like do this unless they say and to shoot your neighbors. Don't do that. But if it's, you're doing something that's not going to hurt somebody, like writing jokes, telling them, writing a script. Yeah, you can do whatever the fuck you want to do. And the fact that you're 16 and you're already are listening to yourself, you're way ahead of the game.

Speaker 6:          01:04:23       So, um, and you have the intelligence to understand that, you know, hey, I need some help and you reached out for it. Keep doing that, my friend and I hope to see out there. Give it a shot, you know. But I would, I would, I'd write five minutes is shit tonight and then sign up for an open mic somewhere and within the week I would start do it. And that's unbelievable balls to be able to do that as 16 it took me almost a 24 to get the balls to do it. So my hat is off to you sir. Or ma'am, I don't know who you are. All right, here we go. Girlfriend has prejudice parents, a Billy Billy dingleberry. I am a white man who was dating a black woman. She is the greatest thing that has ever happened to me and there's no doubt in my mind that I want to spend my life with her.

Speaker 6:          01:05:07       Well, congratulations until now. Don't done. We'd been dating for 10 months then I finally met her parents this past weekend. When I got there, seemed shocked by my skin color, almost like my girl hadn't even hinted to them that I was white. Well, that's probably what happened if they are fucking racist. Um, the whole dinner was very awkward. I wasn't being looked at in the eye and I was left out of most of the conversation. Then they make a movie about this Ashton Kutcher in the late great Bernie Mac. I even tried talking to her dad about music since we are both musicians, but he just kept giving me short answers. Like he didn't give a fuck after the whole thing was over. My girlfriend said that they didn't like that I was white. Uh, she said that they wanted her to have strong black babies and not to dilute the bloodline also.

Speaker 6:          01:06:03       Uh, they sprouted a bunch of other shit about how much trouble will run into as an interracial couple. It has been four days and we still haven't talked about it, nor is she told her parents off for being prejudice assholes. I truly believe this is the only situation where a white person can fully understand what a black person go. I don't know about that. Dewayne you get, you get, you get a little sprinkling of it. Uh, a black guy with the microphone on the street corner can call me cracker all he wants and I won't lose a wink of sleep over. But when you told, uh, the person you love is wrong and invalid, that's like a kick in the balls anyways. How should I go about addressing this? I'm assuming you didn't run to this problem with Nia. No, I didn't make, maybe she could weigh in on this as well anyway. Thanks and go fuck yourself. Uh, Jesus. Um, I would say if you love her, I would stay with her. If, if you questioning it, I pull the rip cord cause that's just going to be a fucking nightmare. That'll end up being a nightmare. You know what I mean? You gonna be going to be in a relationship where you're waiting for the other person's parents to die. Sitting there going like one down today. You know, that's just the fucked up. You know, you really, when you're going to get married is you have to, uh,

Speaker 4:          01:07:18       okay.

Speaker 6:          01:07:19       I Dunno. I mean, who are the fuck am I to say I waited so God damn long. So I'm not an authority. But you know, if you, if you're with somebody that's fun, you know, and they come from a good family and their family supportive of you guys. I mean that's so much of the battle actually, you know, something, this past week when I was in Vegas, somebody came up to me, said, hey bill, I want, let me, I got to ask you a question. Who makes you laugh? And without even thinking, I said my wife and it made me feel really good like that. It's quite, you know, my wife saw hot shit. She makes me laugh, we have a good time. Um, and uh, so I don't know, she might not be bringing it up because she's embarrassed about it or whatnot. Um, I have no idea. But uh,

Speaker 4:          01:08:07       okay.

Speaker 6:          01:08:08       I mean that's going to be a hell of a fucking situation if that's how they're going to view their grandkids. I mean, that's kind of a, that that's a major fucking situation where I would at least want to see where her head is at. And then you throw out certain scenarios about the future. So how are we going to handle this? And Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Um, you know what? I'm sorry you're going through that dude, but you definitely need to have some fucking conversations. I would think. I would definitely think some conversations that were in the order. All Right, Collin Farrel movies. He, Billy Redskin, uh, Colin Farrell has done a couple of great movies since phone booth. You should, uh, you should like, namely

Speaker 6:          01:08:57       in Bruges, Bruges. I don't know how to say it. And seven psychopaths with the always excellent Sam Rockwell. Oh, Jesus Christ. I got to c seven s seven psychos.
