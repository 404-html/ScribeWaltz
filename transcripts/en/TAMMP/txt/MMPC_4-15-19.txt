Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn his time for the Monday morning podcast from Monday, April 15th. Ouch. 2019. How you guys doing today? On this fucking tax day? Ah. Oh, Uncle Sam's knocking at your door. Uncle Sam. He's a whore. He's taken all your fucking money unless you didn't do shit. And then he gives you some, I didn't do anything this year. Uncle Sam. Oh, they're there. Here's some money for you. Pay Uncle Sam. I work my balls off. I'll take that. Um, anyways, I hope today fine. She wanted the fun side of tax day. I hope it does. I hope it does. You know, it's funny as I actually found a fucking w nine or whatever, you have to go give to my accountant. It's the 15th, and he's going to be like, well where the fuck was this? Went back and I was asking, where are you parking derby fucking nines where, man, my, my lawyer is a, he's a southern character. Um, my lawyer, my accountant. How are you guys? How are you this morning? I'm actually, I'm mute. You see how I didn't even wait to see how you're doing because I don't care how it's all about me on this podcast. It's why I don't have guests. Um, oh, freckles is fucking white out.

Speaker 2:          00:01:26       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:01:28       This is the thing about being a fucking redhead. Even when the red party you had is gone, right?

Speaker 2:          00:01:33       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:01:35       There's only so much sun that someone like myself can take on during a 48 hour period. Uh, really only an eight hour period or I am going to be in series fucking problems here and I'm old freckle, spent the entire weekend out in the sun on Saturday. I went to Long Beach and I went down there and I, I watched uh, the Long Beach, uh, GP, the Grand Prix down there, whatever the hell they call is fucking amazing because not only was there a couple of races, there was also like people out there trying to qualify for the Indy 500 or something. I didn't get that part.

Speaker 1:          00:02:18       Well maybe they will get like qualifying to try and qualify. I don't know how the fuck it works, but it was kind of reminded me of like a mini Lamont where, uh, you got all these different classes of cars that were out there racing. Um, and uh, it was so fucking cool and I got to go down and you know, go in the whole pit area would have the fuck they call it the paddock. Um, and they had BMWs and Porsche's and Corvettes and then they had more indie indie car racing style cars. And I got hooked up by a good buddy of mine and he got this one pass, it said to take a hot lap, which really sounds, but you get no fucking race car. And the guy tears around the track at about 120, a hundred, 230 miles an hour. Now I had already done something like that.

Speaker 1:          00:03:08       Um, at the, uh, the Indy 500, that time when, when for with for all things, comedy, comedy, comedy. I interviewed Danica Patrick right before her last race and she took me around in a Camaro. So I already did that. And my lovely wife was the one who kind of put together the whole long beach thing. So, and I knew that she was bored shitless, so I was like, um, can you, can my wife go instead of me? And the guy was like, yeah, I mean, if that's what you want, it's like, yeah, man, I've already done this. I, you know, I gotta, I gotta keep her adrenaline going here. And, uh, she ended up jumping in this car and she gets some fucking Porsche, which I guess was worth like fucking 300 grand and this guy tool around the track, she did a little Instagram thing about it, but, um, that put a big smile on her face and got to go.

Speaker 1:          00:04:03       And again, I don't know who she drove with, but, uh, she thought he was dead. That was his job. That that's what the fuck he did. And it turned out he was like some like legendary racecar driver who would want a ton of racist or something. Um, but anyways, uh, we end up having a great fucking time and a dude that I, I've been meaning to go to that, that is a killer fucking event. The crowd is like crazy intuitive. And on the first lap of the first race that I saw, um, there was a, there was an accident when you just heard the cry go, ah, you know, freaking out cause they fucking, we'll watch it and up on the TV. And, uh, there's a couple of hotels down there too, for those of you who don't want to sit in the sun like me that have balconies that overlooked the race track.

Speaker 1:          00:04:49       So it's like basically, you know, you get high enough up a floor, it's like you're hovering in a fucking helicopter just watching the whole frigging race and then he can have the TV on in your living room, you know what I mean? And then he could burn some call and do a couple other things to fuck up the atmosphere just for your own fucking personal enjoyment. It was tremendous. I had a moment there where I was almost going to get to meet Bobby Rail. Um, who is far as I know is I think the first guy who ever won a NASCAR event and then won the Indy 500. Um, that's quite a leap. I don't that you didn't see a lot back then. You know, Dale Buche good old boys back in the day. Hell, they would just run some car they had Shannon had fucking weekend before. It was much more like that. I caught the tail end, you know, when bought it. Baker Cale Yarborough Harry Gant, you know, here and gaining a scold Bain, it, your Buick, regal, whatever. The fuck it when this is when the fucking car is still looked like something you'd drive down the street. I caught the tail end of that. Darrell Waltrip, Bobby Bonia. No, I'm sorry. That's a baseball players

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       and um, well the fuck else was out there. Oh, Bill Elliot, the Bill Burr is fucking star car drivers.

Speaker 2:          00:06:06       You know.

Speaker 1:          00:06:08       [inaudible] he said, I looked like Ron Howard. It's like, no, I didn't. I used to look like I used to look like Bill Elliot Aka Dollar Bill.

Speaker 2:          00:06:15       MMM.

Speaker 3:          00:06:17       Which was never my neck.

Speaker 2:          00:06:18       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:06:20       Um, what the fuck am I talking about? I'm wiped out. Sorry. And then Sunday, um, when all this unbelievable sports shit was happening when tiger woods

Speaker 3:          00:06:31       one the mat,

Speaker 1:          00:06:46       oh my God, that was a scary moment. All of a sudden my mixer wasn't working and I was like, Holy Shit. I believe I just said, oh no. I'm like, now what the fuck am I gonna do? How am I ever going to go out and buy another $60 fucking two channel mixer? It's $99. It gets has center.

Speaker 2:          00:07:08       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:07:10       Turns out it's just the outlet in my house. All right.

Speaker 2:          00:07:15       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:15       I love it. I love buying an old house with character. It's got a lot of character,

Speaker 2:          00:07:21       you know.

Speaker 1:          00:07:24       See that guy over there. He doesn't work at all. He's got, he's got a lot of character. Um, he doesn't have a fucking job. That guy has a lot of character. It's weird how like the way human beings, you're not judged having a lot of character if you don't have a fucking job. But you know, if a house doesn't work at all, it's, that's how it's described getting a lot of character. It's going to Kuwait personality. Um, anyways, tiger woods won the master.

Speaker 4:          00:07:48       Ah,

Speaker 1:          00:07:50       ladies, uh, the ladies all these years, they were hoping that that motherfucker would never win again. So there's stupid fucking theory that, you know, you know, women always try to take the credit when, um, when a great

Speaker 3:          00:08:04       man does something, whenever a great man achieves something, what do they try to fucking do? They go, well these teas, white supported them. So when she fucking leaves him, when the guy's old and he's limping around and all that and he can't hit a jump shot anymore and she goes out and takes his fucking house, they always try to say, well she gave up on her dreams to follow her. Yeah. Cause her dreams couldn't sell out an arena. Here's one for you ladies. I don't know why I'm coming at you like, because it's fun. You know what? It's fun. You guys are just getting your fucking asses kicked by all these man. China's out there right now sitting there fucking interview. When you specifically white women, like you have difficult lives, which is just fucking hilarious to me.

Speaker 2:          00:08:51       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:08:53       But it also is the genius a woman, you know what I mean? The, the manipulating powers of women is to such a high level, their skill and manipulation is such to a high level that literally white women are being interviewed on television right now. Like there's some sort of like oppressed people

Speaker 2:          00:09:11       both.

Speaker 1:          00:09:14       Um, what is it like to be a white woman in the United States of America? That has to be so difficult. You have no idea. Every Jay, when I wake up and I look at my SUV and I'm like, oh, it needs to be vacuumed out. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:09:32       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:09:32       Anyways, there's that big fucking stupid fucking argument about support. Whenever somebody great specifically a man does something great and then a woman cleans them out or this credit, you know, or the guys given a fucking speech, he always has to thank his fucking wife. You know what I mean? And you know, all guys, we know what this is, say her fucking name. So she's in a good mood on the car ride home because God knows her emotions come first before anything else in the fucking relationships. So that's why guys are given a shout out. But what women do is they take it at face value, like they actually had something to fucking deal with it. You know what I mean? Ladies, let me ask you this fucking question. Okay. Because for all these fucking years, they had this theory that when tigers personal life fell apart. That's why his golf game fell apart, which was complete horse shit. All right. If you read any of those stories, the men definitely had the ability to compartmentalize it

Speaker 2:          00:10:27       life.

Speaker 1:          00:10:30       That wasn't the issue from day one when he was just a kid. What do you want his first master master master, right? When? When that fucking 1997 all these fucking old white guys who are going like, this guy is unbelievable. He's gonna fucking do this and that. But I'll tell you the way he swings, it's such a violent swing. I'm worried about his back and his knees and all that. They called it.

Speaker 2:          00:10:55       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:55       A lot of them are probably hoping it was going to happen because they want to Jack Nicholson or Nicholas, sorry to still be at the top. You know who's kidding? Who Golf isn't exactly the most inclusive fucking sport out there, right? So are, I don't know, personal, uh, Cutler and like they said, person of Color Breighton fucking lick cold sucks this Sun God. Jack Nicholas. So they were predicting that his, his, his body was going to break down and give out on him, which it did right when his personal life did. So of course everybody gives the Barbie doll all this fucking credit debts. She was his rock. She did did that fuck Outta here. The guy did it on him by himself. That's it. He did it on his own. At the end of the fucking day, she's not out there swinging the fucking yard sticker. Right. You know, in, for any women who don't like that shit. Let me ask you this, okay. When a woman gives birth and a guy sitting there supporting her are going, come on, you do it. Okay. Okay. Who? Who deserves the lion's share of the credit when the baby gets delivered.

Speaker 1:          00:12:01       Furthermore, who gets the lion's share of the crest? The woman still does. You know what I mean? But you can better believe if we were pushing a kid out of our ass there and the woman was chairing this on, you know, God knows, God knows the court system would be like, well, he had al, she played a major role.

Speaker 5:          00:12:19       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:12:20       I'll come fans for the patriots, haven't gotten their own super bowl rings for supporting the Patriots through this incredible super bowl run with my ring. I supported you Tom Brady. So anyway, I'm just, I'm really talking to go small segment of fucking women out there, but it's fun to fucking trash them. Um, I missed the whole fucking thing. I didn't see any of it. And I was at, I was at Fort Irwin out in the Moh Javi desert there in the Mojave desert watching the army plays some war games. Don't ask me how the fuck this whole thing came together. I did, if I did a show at an American Legion is a comic there. John Sites who, who is a veteran himself and you just go down there and you're smoking cigars with veterans and they asked you shit and you just keep saying yes. And next thing you know as a bald, redheaded mail, you were, you were out in the middle of the fucking Mojave desert, no piss this being out there

Speaker 1:          00:13:28       fucking in the middle of the guide where we actually, we got up at like five 30. Well you had to be there at five 30 in the morning. It was pretty cool. We flew like a Vietnam era. Uh, Huey, like the apocalypse now on, you know, Charlie doesn't like to surf, you know, we flew that thing up out there. Uh, I got to sit in a Black Hawk and an Apache, talked to all these pilots and then I watched a fucking war game and um, eight, eight, the fucking military meal that they have out there that you cut it open with a knife and there's some fucking psycho thing that you, I don't know, you kind of rub it together and then you stick the Chili in and it heats up. I got to tell you, it was pretty fucking good. All right. Granted, I wouldn't want to eat that.

Speaker 1:          00:14:11       Every God damn day for two fucking years in the middle of God knows where. I wouldn't want to do that. But you know, for one day it was funny. I'm so Hollywood, they were like, you know what's funny is this, this meal here is actually 5,000 calories because these guys had just fucking sitting out there. These brave men and women are sitting out there, right? They pretend days, they're out there. So then, you know, they're burning all these calories and shit. And I'm immediately, I'm so Hollywood, like 5,000 calories, I have an acting gig coming up and I can only eat about 1875. That's my target. But I ate the whole fucking thing. I didn't want to disrespect anybody. So anyways, watch these whole fucking war games. And it was, it was fascinating. They like play, it's almost like laser tag and they get like these blinking lights on like tanks and shit like that.

Speaker 1:          00:14:59       And, uh, if you get hit and it blinks twice, it's considered not a direct hit, but you're, you're, I don't know, sort of wounded. And if it blinks four times, that means you're dead. You're out of the game, you'll hold tank shuts down, you're not able to communicate with anybody. Cause you know, they were radically you fucking dead. And I just watched how the a black horse, the home team they drew in, the other two was basically an away game for the other people. And uh, I kind of at the end of the day learned a lot of shit. I don't know a lot of shit, but I learned a lot of shit. Like how that terrain is fondant and it's basically you move through the valleys, you're not going to try to go up and over. Certainly with all that, you know, equipment, which isn't something that I ever really even thought about.

Speaker 1:          00:15:47       So you just Kinda know, all right, where can they come from? And then they just basically draw them in. You know, it's, it's like, Hey, look at this over here. And they go after that and then they get, I don't know what the proper terminology, they get flanked. I don't know what the fuck it is. They, they hit him from the other side like, Hey, look at my left hand. And then they punch him with the right was essentially what they kept doing. And it was working. It kept drawing people in like you'd see them, they'd spot their position, the other team would get excited and they would just fucking come flying in guns a blazing and then they would just get broadsided. And by the time they figured out where the fire was coming from, it was over. If they were fucked, um, I got to go in an old tank and I shot a, uh, whether you know that gun on top of the Turret Terrick I, whenever the fuck it is, that little thing. And you know what I realized in that moment, I could give a shit about guns.

Speaker 1:          00:16:43       I am all about aviation. I was hanging on every word of those pilots, asking them how, you know, the whole thing worked. Why the tail rotor was that much higher than the main road. I could've talked about that all day long, but fucking sitting there, my ears a shot. I don't want to see, you know, it was like doing that, you know, something every fucking redneck would get half a woody to go do. And I was up there, I felt guilty. I was just up to like cheese. It's Christ. How many bullets are left. My ears are ringing. FOC.

Speaker 1:          00:17:19       Um, I was more fascinated with how you change the fucking, if, if one of the, uh, the tracks comes off the tank, how you change the fucking thing and what a bitch it is to change and how long it takes and how fucking pissed off everybody gets. I was more fascinated with that. Um, although they'll, the fucking weaponry on the, uh, the Apache was pretty cool. You know, that thing that thing's on the side where it's just like they, it's like a circle thing and like they just kind of all his comes out. And one of the pilots was saying, yeah, those things are about as accurate as a bottle rocket. So it's really like this big skill to try and to initially try to get some sort of accuracy with those things. But anyways, we spent like, um,

Speaker 5:          00:18:04       okay

Speaker 1:          00:18:05       God, we get out there at like seven something in the morning.

Speaker 5:          00:18:08       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:18:08       And uh, I took pictures with a lot of the troops out there and as you notice, it's fucking hilarious. I kept it real. I came out there and dress like a civilian. I wasn't going to go to the army navy store like a friend of mine did, but he was a veteran and buy some fucking camouflage pants. I walked out ahead like this mccoley vans on. I didn't realize we were going out in the middle of the desert. I, this is fucking windbreaker that my wife bought me for Christmas. I've only worn it like five times. I don't know how I'm going to get it clean. Um, but I want to thank everybody out there. Fort Irwin. I'm definitely going to come back and do a show if I can figure out where to do one. I didn't see where they had any sort of a theater or a stage or anything, but I definitely, I was talking to John Sites that I go do it, we gotta come back out and do a show and these people are great. Um,

Speaker 5:          00:19:00       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:19:01       They treated us awesome. And uh, I dunno, that was, that was quite a goddamn experience. Like if I was gonna miss the Masters and see tiger when, cause I know I can watch that on online, I'll be able to find it. But I heard it was the most exciting masters since Nicholas Nicholas and 86. But, um, I don't know. It was amazing. And what was Keller was every fucking

Speaker 5:          00:19:25       mmm

Speaker 1:          00:19:26       army guy, a woman that even remotely knew who I was, said, hey, I love Apis for family. Not one of them said anything about my standup, which was so fucking cool. So I'm kind of feeling like after three seasons episodes, episode, family, it's finally breaking throat. Um, anyway, so thank you to everybody out there. Fort Irwin, I want to come

Speaker 3:          00:19:47       back out and do a show. All right. Not In the middle of the fucking desert. I need a stage and an air condition bunker. You give me that and I'll, I'll be, I'll be back out there. Other than that, I'm, maybe I'll, I'll, I'll go out there in the winter time. I'll do a nighttime show when all them creepy critters come out. I guess there's some turtle out there too. That's like in danger.

Speaker 5:          00:20:09       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:20:10       So if they come upon it, they supposed to let people know and then they come out and they remove it and they stick it somewhere else. And uh, the big joke is the reason why is in danger, just because if you come up and you try and pick it up, it's defense mechanism is it empties all the fluids out of itself, bodily fluids, and then it like, it dies of dehydration immediately. It's like, well, I mean, if that's your, if your defense is to essentially kill yourself, um, I don't know how long you can be around. I would, I wouldn't assume that that would be something you could do. All right. Anyways, um, congratulations to tiger woods. I, when I got off you, when I came back to, uh,

Speaker 5:          00:20:50       yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:20:50       you know, the helicopter, we were going to fly back. I turned my phone back on and, uh, you know, I got all these messages from Versium Bartolik and all these guys flipping out about tiger. I was like, oh my God, you gotta be kidding me. And, uh, so I immediately looked up tiger woods and I saw that picture of him when he's sunk, the sank the puck, the pot sink, the Putt. And, um, I can't remember the last time I was at happy for an athlete. CanNot fucking remember. So fucking great. And now he's got like, what, 15 or 16 and Jack has 18 if he had 43, puts it all back together. I mean, Jack One one in 86, he was 46 years old, so he can definitely do it. But I thought, I remember seeing him, I watched the beginning of the masters and I saw him. He looked like he was in really good shape. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:21:47       uh, that's just, I mean, how great is that for golf? I can't imagine what the fucking ratings were and any amount of jackasses who are now going to go take up the game. That guy has been the greatest thing for golf, you know, of the last, you know, quarter century. Like he's basically had the sport on his back. Um, so it's so great to see that guy come back. Uh, congratulations tiger woods and congratulations to yard Boston Bruins tying up to series. They may pull a first the Boston Bruins out day. It's a tale of two different gates. This is my takeaway from both games. I would say in game one, the Bruins got lulled into the maple leaf's game up and down the end to end fucking defenseman getting caught up ice, whatever the fuck they were doing. We let up, like I felt like six breakaways. They'd a break away gold and then they scored on a penalty shot.

Speaker 3:          00:22:40       It's just like, what the fuck is, this isn't how we play. And then in gained two, I thought the maple leafs got drawn into the Bruins, a physical play. And, you know, I thought on both games, both like the Bruins lost their composure in the first game and I thought the leads kind of lost their composure in the second game is far as like not sticking to their game plan and getting drawn into, it's like watching a boxing match and a boxer gets drawn into the center of the ring for a broth, you know, cause the other guy kind of gets them into that macho fucking mode. So game three I would assume is tonight. Like I said, I was kind of off the grid this weekend. And um, by the way, I'm going to look it up right now. What the fuck is happening down in Tampa? That is the only fucking time after game two when Columbus beat, uh, beat the lightning as the only time I've ever seen was it total rally. That's the only time I've seen that guy smile like that. Like he, he looked elated. Oh my God, they fucking lost again.

Speaker 1:          00:23:48       Are you fucking kidding me? I mean, it's fucking over. I was just gonna say Columbus has to win game three because you can't wake the sleeping giant. That is the Tampa Bay lightning. Good fucking Lord. I got to watch she NHL network. What is, what are the Columbus blue jackets doing that the Bruins couldn't fucking do play off shock. Columbus wins again. Goes up three nothing. Okay, here's some quotes. Everyone's got to step up. Everyone's got a place, solid solid game and we've got to make it a little bit harder. That was Tyler Johnson.

Speaker 2:          00:24:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:24:38       I Dunno who that is. I don't know who anybody is. I got a kid now. I don't know who fucking plays for who. All right. Game three. Steven Stamkos now I believe he's still playing with Tampa. Uh, he said they have no power. Plays in a game is pretty surprising. The after earn those and I thought we played well in the third, but it's no constellation right now with the position we're in sorta complaining, but not really. Our focus has to be coming out and playing with that same pace, the same execution, that same desperation right from the start play one period. At a time said Ryan McMahon. I don't know who the fuck any of these people are.

Speaker 2:          00:25:12       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:25:14       Somebody asked a question, when was the last time Tampa went to Stanley clap? Why? That would be 2004

Speaker 2:          00:25:20       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:25:21       That would be 2004 um, Jesus Christ, you know, I went to a game out there in Columbus and I was very impressed with their fans and that was early on. They were all in, they were injured the fucking game. So congratulations to them. Tampa Bay lightning fans. Fuck, I've been there. God knows I, I've been there. I've been there as a fan where you fucking kick the shit and left my first year of watching the Boston Bruins, like really letting all my first year I went to a game.

Speaker 2:          00:25:53       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:25:54       Was that 83 season?

Speaker 2:          00:25:56       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:25:57       80 was it 83 84 we won the president's trophy or something. We had Pete Peters and he was like the best goalie in the league and all of that. And the first round was best three out of five. And the Canadians came in and they were like fourth place in the Adams Division and we drew them and those fucking assholes came in and swept us like they always did back then. And uh, the first game that was the first Boston Bruins game I ever went to,

Speaker 2:          00:26:24       mmm.

Speaker 1:          00:26:26       I was taking French and the French kids had come over and they took him to a game and you had to buy the tickets through. Our French teacher was pretty cool. And we all went down to the old Boston Garden. And I remember we went in there and we were sitting with the French kids and it took me about eight seconds to realize that those fucking assholes started rooting for the Canadians because, uh, they are started hearing all that blue block, a rouge and all that fucking, which is so fucking ridiculous because the French don't even respect the fucking French Canadians. They don't consider them real French. They consider him farmers. Um, but I got to hand it to those French kids. They will fucking wave in these, these Montreal Canadian flags right in the faces of these drunk fucking Bruins fans in the upper deck. But I think because they were French and they just want an American jerk offs, they somehow got away with it.

Speaker 1:          00:27:16       But I remember my French treats her teacher looking over at me like making this face like, did these fucking kids know what they're doing? This is getting pretty intense. Um, oh my God. Would that been hilarious if a brawl broke out and the next day we went to fucking French class? You know, it'd be hilarious is nothing would happen as far as like back then where now that would be like a national news story. Like what was that French teacher thinking? Bringing these poor immigrants down to that hostile environment. Look at this cell phone footage that wouldn't have happened. Do you realize I grew up in an era where something like that could have happened and know the people in this section would not even have known the backstory of what went down. They would have thought it was just a bunch of fucking cons. Who came down from Montreal and got their asses kicked. They wouldn't realize now that was like teenagers from France.

Speaker 1:          00:28:13       Um, anyway, uh, so game three, I imagine it's tonight a huge fucking game. Huge game. We got to take control of the goddamn series. Uh, Toronto is such a good team and I was not believing in their goaltender there then Anderson guy. And um, basically I watched one game and he mishandled the puck twice. So I was like, I know about hockey, but he's been playing great. Certainly in that first game, that first game we had, like I felt like we had 20 more shots than leased it and they still came into one. So leaps have a really good team and I really liked the least, you know what I mean? Um, always have. Um, so like I said, if we don't beat the least in this series, uh, that they're going to be the team that I'm going to be rooting for. Um, although Columbus, I mean, that's a fun story.

Speaker 1:          00:29:01       Now if they'd be Tampa Cheese is Christ and I've, I haven't seen a second of that series. I'm missing the whole frigging thing. I'm running around like a lunatic. Why? Why is that? Cause we got the last episode of F is for family for season four. We're writing it this week. Uh, but what happens at this time of the season is as you're writing the episode, you're also getting the first animatics, which is the first rough drawings. And then you have to go back and punch that stuff up and look at the edits. So it starts to become like a, rather than one giant wave writing the script, it starts becoming a series of waves hitting the beach. And uh, oh, freckles gets busy here. But, uh, I definitely to tune in to watch that game for, um, that Columbus series and uh, and of course I'm going to be watching my Bruins tonight.

Speaker 1:          00:29:51       All right. What else? Oh, big announcement. This is something I've been trying to do for awhile. Um, I have a charity show coming up, um, on, uh, August 1st at the Wilbur Boston, Massachusetts. Yours truly is going to be there with a bunch of other, uh, Boston comics. It's for the, uh, the Travis Roy Foundation. It's laughing with your buddies for the Travis Roy Foundation. Travis Roy of course, was a great hockey player for the Boston Bruins and unfortunately, um, and you know, he broke his neck and got paralyzed plane for the team. And um, I remember where I was when I saw that story. That story really affected everybody living in Boston. And um, I was, I've been trying to get involved with their charity for a long time and it's finally going to happen.

Um, some of you saw my general hospital trailer to, well that's a first soap opera actually released a trailer.

Um, anyways, when they can turn to medicine and science, this really is like a thing, like, I guess you don't have to go bald anymore. It's funny. The other guy I was working with was also bald and we were talking about, um, he was going to you getting those old age spots on top of your head. I said, no fucking way, dude, I do not have my bald head in the sun whatsoever. And he goes, yeah, man, it sucks. And then we just started laughing. I go, you know, it's fucking crazy with all these stem cell research, they can literally grow a fucking ear and a god Damn Petri dish and they can't come up with, um, a solution to balding. And, uh, and we were both laughing about it. I go, yeah, but you know, it's fucking funny. Once she shaved her head like I don't think I would want to go back. There is something great.

Speaker 2:          00:39:08       oh,

Speaker 1:          00:39:10       all right. What else did I want to talk about? Was there anything else? Uh, Lewis Hamilton, once again, finally had his first right, great start of the year. Blew right by foul Terry Botox who had the pull position and that was pretty much it. And I had been watching racing f one race in long enough to know that will Lewis Hamilton gets to first in that first turn, the fucking race is over, it's over. And I also know that if he's in second or third place and there's only 10 laps to go and he has no chance of winning the race, he's going to start complaining. I don't understand why other people aren't helping me out here. Um, I was really hoping Botox was going to win that because, uh, I didn't realize the first year when I watched,

Speaker 2:          00:39:53       mmm,

Speaker 3:          00:39:56       what a great fucking year that was. To Watch two drivers on the same team compete for it and not help each other and smash into each other. What the fuck was that guy's name? The guy retired.

Speaker 2:          00:40:08       I can't remember his name. Anyway,

Speaker 1:          00:40:12       plowing ahead. I did not see the moto GP race. I have a lot of shit to get caught up on it because I was out in the desert. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:40:21       I was being such a fucking asshole when I was out there too. Like they were explaining all this military stuff to me and I was just standing there in my fucking vans and my, my, uh, Pete Carroll Khakis and they would explain all this military shit and then when they would just be like, do you have any questions? And I was just like, um, kit, I bet the stars at night are incredible out here. Can you see the stars a lot better than you came without the thing in the fucking those the guy when special forces and he totally rolled with it. He was like, absolutely, it makes you question your existence. We're just a speck of dust. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:41:00       yeah, there was a lot of ball break it out there. And it reminded me of back in the day when I used to work in a warehouse and all we did was just give each other shit all day was the most fun fucking thing. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:41:09       Ever. And uh, at some point,

Speaker 1:          00:41:15       because one of the guys on special forces was also had a kid around my age. We both started going off on that show, fancy Nancy

Speaker 2:          00:41:24       and uh,

Speaker 1:          00:41:26       and what an asshole she is. And how we both, uh, watching her going like this, I don't want my daughter watching this shit.

Speaker 5:          00:41:33       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:41:33       And we watch

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       it. Oh cause she's fancy. She's totally into like status and who were friends aren't having tree forts and not letting people in and is trying to fill up her life with like fucking clothes and shit. Like that's going to fill up our passion and we would just trashing it, laughing our asses off. And at some point we said that the working title of that for the working title of it was actually Conti Kathy, but they couldn't get it on the air or something. Like I forget. But we just fucking sitting there in the middle of this desert just laughing our balls off about this fucking cartoon. And then all of a sudden this war games thinks started and um, I don't know. I want to thank everybody once again, it was out there, man. That was a hell of an experience that I will definitely not forget. Um,

Speaker 5:          00:42:17       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:42:18       So anyway, let's see. Let's read some of the questions here for this week. All right. Uh,

Speaker 3:          00:42:24       okay. So I sent out a tweet as a joke saying, you know, I wish somebody from England,

Speaker 5:          00:42:31       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:42:31       Could explain to me the different leagues in soccer. And I was doing that as a joke because last week when I fucking thought that Man City had launched a league game and that what's his face is, you know, it's so fucking stupid. It's not a fucking league game, but they still add the points or don't have the points. I don't fucking get it. It's so fucking ridiculous. Like this is just a friendly, the middle of the season. Let's just play a fucking game for the fuck of it. And then there's the champion's league anyway, so I have all these fucking English cunts put down their fish and chips for a fucking minute. Right then waddled they're bloated upper bodies with these skinny fucking legs over to their computer and just started. It was hilarious. They were fucking live at, at me. Um, and so I was just sort of being a dick going, I wish somebody would explain it to me. So may if I could see if I could get him to start writing and capital letters. But what ended up happening was because I wrote it nicely rather than being a dick here, sorry, still going fucking sand in my throat. Um,

Speaker 5:          00:43:38       yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:43:38       Uh, they actually sent me a bunch of emails to try to explain it to me. So now I can't break that balls anymore. So all right. So here's the deal. This is basically explaining all the different league. Soccer has has a playoff, but it's called the champion's league. The top four premier league teams at the end of the season make the playoffs. Just like the divisions in American sports. See, I didn't know this. I'm the team with the most points in the premier league basically wins the president's trophy. The biggest difference is that the playoffs happen at the same time as the regular season. I see like that I needed more explanation there. So that basically means that this season is a play. All right, so the Tottenham win over man city happened in the playoffs. What? Liverpool is currently

Speaker 5:          00:44:32       in the playoffs and there are no tie games. If you get a chance, watch the Champions League. It's really awesome to watch. Thanks and go fuck yourself. Yeah, no, see I would watch that. Now why didn't somebody just tell me that from the beginning,

Speaker 3:          00:44:47       but the Champions League is also, it's not just the top four teams. I thought there was something like with like Switzerland,

Speaker 3:          00:44:55       I dunno, I'm just going to keep asking questions to like get it because now that seems, that seems exciting to me as opposed to just, you know what, we met twice during the regular season and I lost both fucking gains, but I still have more points to you. So I win the premier league. I don't, I don't know. Anyways, um, this is Biden, dear Billy night night shades. I'm not offended by your take on Biden cause I don't really get offended and I'm not outraged by, by Biden. Okay, so now you know immediately this person's going to fucking be offended. My opinion, however, is different than yours, which despite what they tell us on the new, the news is, okay.

Speaker 5:          00:45:37       All right.

Speaker 1:          00:45:40       I would take another look at the video of him groping side Boob in shit. If that was a guy I work with, I'd have the same opinion. And it happens when the guy is next to a podium, not on the dance floor, sending signals. Some of the girls are young. It's just weird. And I'm not even saying he's got bad intentions. You just can't touch strangers that long. Ha Ha. And I totally understand the, it was from a different time thing, but my dad never rubbed up on people and he served in Korea in drove a cutlass, love you and love the podcast. Oh, here's the thing about the Joe Biden thing. I didn't even see that. I saw like half a cliff before I went out on Conan. They go, you want to talk about that? A Gal fucking talk about it. I don't pay attention to shit. I'm just so fucking sick of everybody having their fucking career ended on, on, on our fucking, you know, a two minute tripping penalty and everybody else sitting there fucking acting like they're good people. As I've said from day one, if everybody's fucking text messages were made public, could anybody go to work next Monday?

Speaker 3:          00:46:53       Nobody. Nobody could. So everybody's got to stop fucking lick this fucking witch hunt that like you know for your own fucking instance. The thing too, the amount of people that are going to watch Biden's dream of becoming president get destroyed just for the entertainment purpose of it. That's all they want to do. And there's another thing too, is because there's so many different ways to just sit down and watch shit, there's so much shit to fucking watch. There's so much weight, so many ways to watch shit. That one ratings grabbing his fucking stirring up controversy. Jesus Christ. Do you remember the fucking family feud? Richard Dawson was like tongue kissing every fucking chick on the God damn fucking thing. There was no fucking problem. He hosted few bap bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap. Right? It was fine.

Speaker 5:          00:47:48       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:47:49       Everybody fucking sitting there getting uncomfortable. It didn't happen to you. Nothing happened to you. This isn't your fucking story. If the woman's uncomfortable, she should say something. Jesus fucking Christ. Tell your mother that shit where it's just like so and so said this, but did they really need that?

Speaker 3:          00:48:13       Should Peyton manning be upset while he's obviously not upset? Espn, I remember that one from back in the day. I don't know. I'm, I'm one of these fucking people there. It's just like if the, that's between the fucking people involved. I don't know what they're fucking relationship is and neither do you for all you know, he was maybe the side boot check. He's fucking banging and afterwards she's just like, dude, what the fuck? Don't grab my Ted on fucking TV. They're going to know we're fucking bang and there's a possible scenario. Look at me with no evidence. I can do it too.

Speaker 5:          00:48:48       MMM.

Speaker 3:          00:48:51       Yeah. I'm not an, I'm not in the fucking business. A fucking making up shit and trying to fucking get people in trouble. Am I? Maybe I am as a comedian. I don't know. I just feel like I'm fucking joking around and like this, this fucking thing where you just shove a microscope up. Everybody's asked. They're all human. They're all fucking flawed. I remember back in the day when I worked in a warehouse, there was this fucking manager guy, he was too fucking touch you. Faley and you know what? We all fucking dealt with it. It was fucking hilarious when he'd get you and everybody else would just be laughing at you. But nowadays that guy would lose his fucking job. He'd have to be a registered fucking sex offender. I remember I used to fucking try and make sure I was like, you know, you had to have your head on a swivel when that guy fucking came in. Big fucking doughboy looking dude. Right? So I was at the vending machine and I was, uh, I was, I, I've told this story before, I was trying to figure what the fuck I was trying to buy some fucking food or whatever and uh, as you do at a vending machine. And he came walking in, he goes, oh, hey bill, how you doing it? As he was walking by me from left to right, he slapped

Speaker 3:          00:50:06       his hand on my left shoulder and then dragged it across my entire back as, as he was walking past. And then squeezed my right fucking shoulder. Like it was a perky teddy. I think he was squeezing the Sharmane and I was like,

Speaker 1:          00:50:29       ah. I mean it took like a decade and a half to fucking shake that thing off. Now it should. That guy had been doing that. No.

Speaker 5:          00:50:39       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:50:39       Do I think I need to report him and he should fucking then lose his job and then this is on him for the rest of his fucking life. Now. He's just weird. He's a weird guy. Okay. He didn't fucking dental me, drug me and throw me in a van. He fucking, he fucking, yeah. I don't know how he got a little too friendly.

Speaker 5:          00:51:01       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:51:01       he gave me the Heebie. Jeebies okay. I don't think giving somebody the Heebie jeebies should fuck it. End Your career. I think you ought to be able to sit down with them and be like, listen, could you do me a favor? Can you just say hello?

Speaker 5:          00:51:16       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:51:16       Ninth grader, he was, sorry. Granted he was my boss

Speaker 3:          00:51:23       then I was younger and I didn't know how to fucking say that, but I mean, you know what? If fucking Jesus Christ every fucking thing. Everything is just the biggest thing.

Speaker 5:          00:51:32       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:51:33       Oh, you know what I did? I went back into the warehouse and I fucking told everybody and I got such a big laugh telling the story. It was almost worth the debt. He did it.

Speaker 1:          00:51:43       The fact that it was worth it. I don't get, I didn't give a shit.

Speaker 5:          00:51:46       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:51:47       I didn't feel fucking triggered and all of that fucking crap. Every fucking thing I know. But I gotta tell you something right now. Anybody fought in Korea and drove a fucking olds cutlass is our right with me. Um, all right. White people challenging, uh, racism. Hey Mr. Billy Baldwin and I liked it. That's a new one. Play on the Baldwin thing. Oh, what people done that before, but that's in a different, different way, right? Anyways, uh, I'm a fellow mass hole that used to work in the athletics department at East. Don't call me a math hall. It's, you're shaming an entire state and I feel like every state, bring something to the table. Speaking of which Fort Irwin I learned when I was there. The square mileage, square mileage, the square miles of that, um, training facility. That base is bigger than the state of Rhode Island. How crazy is that? Um, anyways, the class, where the fuck am I?

Speaker 5:          00:52:47       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:52:48       I am a fellow mass hall. They used to work in the athletics department at a small college in one of those rich suburbs of Boston.

Speaker 5:          00:52:55       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:52:56       They ain't all registered there, buddy. I wanted to hear your opinion on a professional development class that I was forced to go to.

Speaker 5:          00:53:06       Uh,

Speaker 3:          00:53:09       the class was titled White People Challenging Racism to middle aged women. Ran The class. One white lady that had to mention that she had a black husband. Every other sentence and the, and the other, a black lady who referenced the book that she wrote every other sentence. Oh my God, this is like a sketch. I wish I was there. Long story short.

Speaker 5:          00:53:36       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:53:36       The class was about how the only people that can be racist in America are white people because they hold the power over every minority. Uh, they're big fanapt. You see road, their big. Finally, they're big finale. Uh, was showing a video from the 90s of a high school science teacher showing kids that all people share the same DNA and we're one race, which I mentioned. Yeah. They taught me that in middle school social studies and science class. I thought everyone knew this. The black professor also came over to me and my coworker after we had finished reviewing and said, you two look like you don't want to be here.

Speaker 5:          00:54:21       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:54:22       My coworker and I looked at each other and explain how we had finished the work she just assigned, which was to point out how the video she showed us was racist overall. It was a very uncomfortable experience and I was just wondering how you would have responded in this training. Sorry for the long email. Love your stuff and hope you and your family are well from a fellow mass hall. All right. Okay. A lot of stuff here. All right.

Speaker 1:          00:54:52       The wording of that is so stupid to say that white people are the only ones that they have the ability to be racist is because they hold the power over other. Every other minority is such a stupid fucking way of conveying that thought to a group of people that you want to be receptive of that information. That's immediately going to put every white person on the defensive and be like, what the fuck? And then start sending fucking email questions to some shitheads podcast who sits in his basement and talks to himself. Um, I would have worded that differently. I would have said that the reason why white people being racist is the worst is because they hold, they do hold the power over every other minority. So the effect of them being racist, um,

Speaker 1:          00:55:48       is so much more painful. All right. And if I was in that class, what I would have said I would, I would've said is what you want. You're saying, and I'm not saying this is with all white people because not every white person is in a position of power, but overall all the powerful positions, you know, 99.9% of them sees to be held by white people. What I would have, what I would say and what I have said to people, you know, when they try to come out with that white guys are evil shit. It's like, no they're not. They're not. Inherently what you're seeing with white people is human beings with unchecked power. The result of that, okay, so what you would then see is if another group where to get that power, they would behave in the exact same way. And what I would say is the me too movement.

Speaker 5:          00:56:44       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:56:45       If you look at how these powerless women then handled the power of being able to destroy, you know, first of all get get people who did something wrong all and then how quickly that spun out of fucking control to just like, um, I was in a toxic relationship, which who the fuck hasn't been

Speaker 5:          00:57:08       okay?

Speaker 1:          00:57:08       Who the fuck can't look on back on their dating history gonna be like, Jesus Christ, I should have got out of that relationship fucking two dates in.

Speaker 5:          00:57:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:57:17       And then we would have avoided all of that fucking drama of screaming and yelling show, but that me too. Shit went from like these fucking horrible guys that were taking their dicks out and doing all this fucking horrible shit.

Speaker 2:          00:57:28       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:57:30       To then just like he yelled at me, you know, and, and, and you just saw how bad that whole fucking thing has spun out of control. I thought, uh, how, uh, I don't want to fucking stir up the name here again. How a certain fucking group prevented a certain fucking performer from doing a dream Gig this year. I thought that their unchecked power that they went from, despite the fact that they became, uh, an entity to protect victims, they actually became the bullying that point where this person had already fucking apologize. So there needs to be more of that.

Speaker 5:          00:58:06       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:58:06       Because the ultimate goal is to get white people to understand the position of somebody who isn't white. So when you come at people that way, that's, that's how it's done on the Internet in a more crass way, which I've always said is when somebody is presenting an opinion, there'll be like a hey fuck head, maybe if you fucking blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. They start with hey fuck, like who's listening after that?

Speaker 2:          00:58:29       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:58:32       So, and it's weird cause I unders cause I though it's one of the first huge fights I got in with Patrice O'neil when he said it was impossible for black people to be ready. I was like, what the, what the fuck are you talking about? And uh, and then I later found out he was quoting like spike Lee and it wasn't even his quote. Um,

Speaker 5:          00:58:52       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:58:53       but that whole, that whole thing where that woman came over to me and if she, if she came home and said, you two look like you don't want to be here, uh, you got to go right back at a person like that. You two look like you don't want to be here. And I would be like, and I would just look at it. I go, what? What is that based on? And I would throw it right back at her. So now you're coming over here judging me and my vibe.

Speaker 5:          00:59:18       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:59:19       And your comment over here with like this aggressive thing. What this, this veiled sort of, I'm going to report you cause you weren't sitting here with the big smile on your face. What do you want me to do now? Be Reversed Louie Armstrong while I listen to this shit. Is that what I'm supposed to fucking do? You told me to do this and I did. This is the thing like, but you're not allowed to say that in that it's like well you kind of came the whole fucking way you entered this was not the way that, that's just not the fucking way to do it. You know? And then if somebody is up there while they're doing that, also trying to sell books, the whole thing is fucking hilarious. You two look like you don't want to be here. Oh I'm sorry. I was thinking about where the nearest Barnes and noble was so I could go out and buy your book.

Speaker 2:          01:00:08       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:00:09       Do you have any sort of guilt that you're trying to make money off of this? Um, yeah. So here's the thing I see, I see both sides of that. Like, like white people challenging racism. That's a weird title for what happened.

Speaker 2:          01:00:26       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:00:27       I thought that that was going to be like, you know, when white people do that thing, when somebody, a black person talks about racism and they go like slavery was like 180 years ago. Fagging get over it. Like they do that shit. Like I've thought that that's what this email was going to be about. Um, which obviously is astoundingly ignorant and uh, it didn't affect so many people's lives. That would be actually funny on some fucking level. Um, yeah, so that's my take on that. So if anybody does that, like the big thing about when you're presenting an opinion and God knows I learned this by doing it the wrong way for, for fucking 40 of my 50 years is you have to enter your point in a way that keeps the other people's deflector shields down so they can hear what you're saying. And then also feel that you're not saying that they are the thing that you're talking about.

Speaker 2:          01:01:19       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:01:21       That would be my suggestion. And um, when you're doing that, you know,

Speaker 2:          01:01:27       yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:01:28       I dunno. I that fucking lady, they're just sitting there sitting that going, cause I got a black husband. Um, I've written a black Dick, so I feel like I should be here. Um, we need a white person that's halfway into the black world here to maybe help the white people that are fully in the white world to bridge the gap between themselves and then this African American woman here who's going to try to inform them while selling books. Um, all right. Titanic theory. All right. Hey, bill a, they are Billy false flag. Uh, do you know the theory behind the titanic sinking? Uh, in short, JP Morgan owned the titanic and the Olympic completely identical ships. Olympic was damaged in port before it could be insured according to a shipyard captain. At the time Morgan had all the identification changed. So it said titanic on the, now we, we can

Speaker 1:          01:02:35       Olympic get the fuck outta here. Morgan was supposed to be on the ship but fell ill at the last minute. Important side note, this was all while Morgan was fighting for a central banking system so he can manipulate us markets even more. Also the voyage on the voyage where two billionaires who opposed the federal system and stood in Morgan's way. There's a lot of good info on this one. Billy would love to hear your thoughts. I love to read about it. What you're basically doing here is you're presenting motive, all right? Where he would definitely have a motive if all of that is true, but how do you prove the old switcheroo, which is what a lot of conspiracy theory starts off with in a reminds me of this great Robert Klein joke. When he was making fun of those people at late night, they would tell you, uh, how to get rich and he would start it off. He goes, okay, you have no money. So you buy a house and then you take the equity in the house. She don't own in like, it all starts off with this giant leap of bullshit. Like, wait a minute, I don't have any money. How do I buy a house? Um, how do you PR, how do you prove to me

Speaker 1:          01:04:00       the Olympic was damaged in port before it could be insured? I mean, how bad was it damaged though? I don't believe this. I don't believe it. I, yeah, I, I simply don't believe that. So what had already had holes in it and then they just sent it out. I know. I don't believe that. Um,

Speaker 1:          01:04:36       and also I think the people, the way the exam of the boat when they found it, I didn't everything kind of fall in place. I, yeah, I don't believe that the old me would've believed that damn bed and we meet from 10 years ago would've believed that. Um, but I'll, I'll look it up. That's, that's fascinating shit. That makes for a great, I'll take it. Makes for a great fucking movie. All right. High School's Sweetie reached out to me. Oh Jesus. Dear bill, longtime listener of the podcast, seen all your specials. Look forward to season Pfoa of FC for F is for family. I am 22 and I've been listening to the podcast for the last five years. Tremendous. Uh, the other day I literally put myself in, in, I put you in my shoes. Like all of a sudden if you were 50 in your high school sweetheart reached out to you.

Speaker 1:          01:05:20       How weird that would be. Cause both of you would be married or divorced and would be crazy. Um, anyways, I am 22 and I've been listening to the podcast for the last five years. The other day, my high school sweet. He texted me out of the blue explaining that I was on her mind and she couldn't hold back or feelings of curiosity. So she texted me. Well that was smart. It's what she should though. You're young. This is all, this is all above board? No, no biting, no Biden. Um, they'll side book. I now live in a different city, have a new girlfriend and my ex and I haven't spoken in over a year.

Speaker 2:          01:05:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:05:58       Oh, so you only broke up with her a year ago? I thought you haven't talked to her since high school. Oh, okay. In the past. She has reached out to me when she's having difficulties in her current relationship and in my opinion, would text me to test the waters to see if I was ready to get back together with her. And of course, things would always escalate to the bedroom. Her texts went on to say that the next time I was in town we should get together for coffee or something and quote, catch up. Uh, I was skeptical, but played along and agreed. What? You have a new girlfriend here, man, I don't know about this, but you're young. This is what you do. I was skeptical what played along and agreed. She then went on to say that she has the cutest puppy and I just have to meet. All right now she's drawn you into her house or apartment and I was even more skeptical of her true intentions. Jesus career acting like the white guy in every fucking the horror movie. When I was growing up, I need to investigate. I asked her if she still lived with her current boyfriend.

Speaker 2:          01:06:58       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:06:59       And she said, no, it's complicated.

Speaker 2:          01:07:02       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:07:03       so bill, would I just be dumb to actually meet up with her and chat with the thought that maybe she actually wants to catch up or should I just stay away reaching out to you because you've always been great with advice or relationship, which wish you and your family all the best. All right, let me get to the top of this thing here.

Speaker 3:          01:07:24       Um, I now live in a different city and have a new girlfriend. All right. You have a girlfriend, dude, so you should know you should not be doing this. Would you be cool if your new girlfriend was fucking catching up with her old boyfriend who got a new goldfish and wanted her to come by his apartment to check it out? You know what she wants to do? I know my listeners know and you know, your deck is taking you over there, buddy. You don't seem like you, you didn't mention one time that you still have feelings for this woman at all.

Speaker 2:          01:07:52       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:07:52       I think it's some fucking throwback pussy that you're going to. Uh, it's not fair to your new girlfriend. You shouldn't fucking do it unless you still have feelings for this woman. At which point you should not be in a relationship with this other new girlfriend. He should figure that out. But all is forgiven because you're only 22 years old, you know, and you have a dick. So these are tough years as a guy. You don't know what the fuck that though. So no, I would not go. I, I would, you know, if I could go back and talk to the 22 year old me, I would say don't do shit like this. Um, especially now.

Speaker 5:          01:08:31       Okay,

Speaker 3:          01:08:31       okay, well you have social media and all that and there's nothing preventing her after you hook up with her, which you know, you're gonna do. There's nothing preventing her from fucking, you know, when she finds a, she know you have a girlfriend, she probably doesn't. And if she finds out there's the, you know, you're going to get caught, the whole fucking thing's going to blow up and you face, you know, Eh, then that's going to be yet. So I would not do it. I wouldn't do it. It's not fair to the girlfriend that you have, but, um, I dunno, you, the weird thing about all of this is I don't think you're in to either one of these women. I think you should be single because you have a new girlfriend. You didn't say that. I love, that's fucking awesome and blah blah blah, blah. He didn't say that. And then he didn't say that. You still love your ex. Um,

Speaker 5:          01:09:19       okay.

Speaker 3:          01:09:19       I think you're trying to fuck both these checks is what I'm thinking. I wouldn't do it. I wouldn't do it. And I would also try to assess how you feel about your new girlfriend before you waste her time and break her heart. You might want to be single. He's one. I'm, I'm, I'm leaning towards that. I don't have enough information here, but that's, I didn't see any sort of, uh, you know,

Speaker 3:          01:09:43       my high school sweetheart. I felt like I could be with her. I thought this was the one, I never heard that and I never heard that, but the new one, so I'm just going to keep saying the same thing over and over again. So good luck with dad situation, sir. Um, it's tricky one. All right. That's the podcast, everybody. I'm, I'm going to watch the Moto GP and get caught up and supports some sports and try to catch the, uh, tiger woods masters to at least some fucking highlights, something of it. Uh, once again, Travis roid tickets, foundation tickets, go on sale. Uh, the presale is this freaking Wednesday and Thursday. I'm going to tweet, sorry, tweet the link, Instagram it and all of that shit of Facebook it, and, uh, please come down. It's going to be a great, great night. A stand up for, uh, a great foundation and a, that's it. Go fuck yourselves. And I'll check in on, yeah, on Thursday.
