How are, yeah, happy Patriot's day, everybody. Um, I believe that only woo. It's one of my voice right now. I believe that um, Massachusetts is kind of the only place that takes Patriot's day off kind of, sort of, you know, they have the Boston Marathon, right? They usually play a red sox game during the day for everybody doesn't want to fucking run around and watch a bunch of skinny people running down the damn street, shitting themselves on heartbreak hill every year somebody shit's themselves in that race. You know that anytime there's a marathon, there's people that push themselves so hard that they literally shit themselves.

Speaker 2:          00:00:53       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:00:54       It's a fucking running up the hill. You know those runners, they were those little fucking nylon shorts and stuff, so there's nowhere for it to go. And these maniacs, they just stayed just keep running with shit going down the back of their legs. Like one of those fucking horses that carried, you know, drags the newlyweds around the park. You know, but even then, you know, they put the tail up, they fucking shoot it out. Always going in early with the shit jokes. Everybody says what it's going to be. Is it literally going to be who should show? Um,

Speaker 2:          00:01:25       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:01:26       Yeah, so whatever happy Patriot's day to everybody. I don't even know what Patriot's day is. You know, I don't think it's about the football team because it's not football season system. When we raised the banner Patriot's Day, let's look it up. Shall We? People Patriot's Day a Hashtag. What the fuck is it? Why does it automatically go to fucking Wikipedia? Even though I would have gone here. All right. Then as I a Patriot Day, a film starring Marky Mark Wahlberg. That's not what I was looking for. Fucking cock suckers. I just don't understand. I had, oh my God, I had the worst day with my fucking phone. Like yesterday. I tried to update it.

Speaker 2:          00:02:06       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:02:08       You know, and then it comes back on and then you need all your fucking passwords and no matter how much I type them in, the way that it's supposed to be, it doesn't recognize it. Then it shuts down my phone. Then it's going old la bones [inaudible] guten tag and like 50 different fucking languages. And I can't, I can't. I came. So if I had not, I haven't meditated in a month. I'm not gonna lie to you, but I, I, if I hadn't meditated so much, the beginning part of the year, I would have broke my phone and half I grabbed it, I turned it sideways and I fucking started. I started to do it. I started to fucking break it and I stopped. I did throw it at the couch into the cushions. And I also did throw my laptop into the, they were all into the cushions, not overly or, you know, it's funny, when I lifted up the laptop, I felt the pain of my rotator cuff so I could only throw it so hard. It was really pathetic. It was a pathetic display of anger. Uh, so, you know, I dunno my phone still fucking with me. You don't, I'm trying to go into the Goddamn apple store here and they won't let me do it. I don't understand these, you know, apple is, is everybody fucking loves his con got company, you know. Can somebody please fucking explain to me why they're so hostile when it comes to any sort of customer support. Is there a fucking reason? There's not a phone number. I can't talk to anybody. They're like fuck you. Here's our product

Speaker 1:          00:03:31       that doesn't work. Go Fuck Yourself. We're not responsible for anything. You don't know what we look like. You don't know where we are. Don't even talk to me about those fucking apple stores with the people walking around with a genius tee shirts. Give me a fucking break. Oh, that sounds says cause somebody just came into my house and I hear it all the time. So I mean it doesn't mean shit to me anyways. What, what, what? That was like an anger meter. You know, as I was getting up higher would ring and it would let me know to come back down again. You know, like an idiot light on some cars that your engine's overheating anyways. Fuck those apple stores too. All right, those are dead, dead. It's all bullshit. You're talking to low level people in the, in the company. Nobody who's fucking designing these God damn things. It ended up being fucked up. It's working at that store.

Speaker 2:          00:04:20       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:04:20       give that stupid fucking shirt. This is genius. It shouldn't say pee on. Um, and then what do they got to deal with? Fucking balding hot heads like me who come walking in and going like to where the fuck did all my music go? Who did you put it on the cloud? I don't want you to have my stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:04:38       Fine. I don't, you know, I should have never stopped getting cds. All I know is everything's fucked up. Okay. And so now I'm signing into shit on my laptop. My phone's talking to me going, hey, somebody signing in on another device and that there's no place for me to say, yeah, I know it's me. And then the laptop soon, the same thing. They're like, it's like David Lee Roth and Eddie van Halen. It's like, you guys, you were great together. We had the band and now you're fucking break it up and you're talking shit about each other and don't even talk to me about those fucking numbers I'm supposed to punch in because I did that too. I went into my settings, I fucking stupid. Uh, whatever. Clicked on my name, went into passwords type the fucking number that they just sent me into the thing and they said they didn't recognize it and then they freeze up. My phone frees up my phone, like I'm working in the Pentagon or something. Come some fucking general. I'm just some jerk off once, listen to some fucking hair metal from the 80s get killed. Well, you know, well I get on a treadmill. It's all I'm trying to do here.

Speaker 2:          00:05:42       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:05:43       You know what it is. It's fucking, it's incestuous.

Speaker 2:          00:05:47       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:05:47       You know how really rich people want to keep the money in their family, you know, so they just sort of, they sort of breed with the same five families. I've taught you this before. So it's why, you know, you look at the, it's like they're, they're good looking from the forehead down to like the mouth area and then they smile and it's Whoa, you know, starts looking like they should be playing a fucking Banjo,

Speaker 1:          00:06:09       you know? So it's the same thing with technology. Technology. It used to be a radio was radio over there? My Stereo dead over there. It's the dishwasher right slash made. I'm sorry, I was just thinking about the time I was talking about. And then you had your walk wins, right? Then the walk when also had a fucking radio and a phone was a phone and now they've all four. They've all just been gang bang, right? This big fucking calendula. Fucking fisting technological, I dunno what they're all the same goddamn thing now. Everything, everything is just on those fucking things. And I don't know, it's ridiculous. So what I ended up doing as I, after I started to like, it was weird. Like I had the strength signals sent from all the way to like my wrist. I didn't let it get to my hands. I felt the anger go all like, it's like the hulk, right?

Speaker 1:          00:07:09       The fucking my arms turned green all the way down to my wrist and I just, I stopped myself from breaking it in half, but I have to, Oh God, that would have been such a great feeling to just snap the has to be youtube videos of people snapping their fucking phones and half. Um, what I did was I just said, fuck that phone, fuck the laptop and I had a drum lesson and I got in my truck and I just fucking drove over and yet can admit, you know what, it was kind of fucking nice not having a phone, you know, I wasn't looking at text messages and dwell driving. I wasn't doing any of that type of shit. Trying to fucking scrolled in the next God damn song, none of that shit. I just was, I dunno, driving a car, like I used to talking to myself and um, then it came back calm down.

Speaker 1:          00:08:00       I tried it again and about, I don't know, maybe the 17th attempt to, I got it to work again and uh, I just got it as you know, is greatest. These are and my ability to communicate with you guys and everything like that. You know, I still would been our right without these things. I could have made it the old fashioned way as a comedian where he just keep doing the clubs and doing the clubs. Then I do a guest spot on the Hollywood squares right next to Paul Lynde. You know, maybe do a fucking tonight show and I just keep building up. I could have made it that way. I didn't need all of this shit. All this shit that these fucking Yolo dishes, you know, selfies and then the, the picture you take that it takes sort of a video, but it's a picture, but it's also a video.

Speaker 2:          00:08:47       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:48       You know, these flying squirrel suits, I mean, I dunno.

Speaker 2:          00:08:53       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:54       What is it you just to do shit that other

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       people didn't do? Is that what it is? I don't fucking know. You know, back in the day, you know what it was back in the day, you fucking did the clubs until you built up enough of a following on your own that you headlined clubs and then maybe you got an hour special. Then you know now if you're a middle act, you need an hour special to headlines. Like the whole thing is too. I just feel like this old man, like

Speaker 1:          00:09:28       what's the deal? All right. Patriot's day, everybody. Um, Patriot's day.

Speaker 2:          00:09:38       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:09:38       Whereas Patriot's day in Massachusetts, in Wisconsin and Patriots Day in Maine is an official state holiday commemorating the anniversary of the battles of Lexington and Concord.

Speaker 1:          00:09:52       Well, what the fuck does Maine and Wisconsin have to do with that? The first battles of the American revolution or does, does his main and Wisconsin, the only other two fucking states of respect to holiday. The holiday was originally celebrated on April 19th. The actual anniversary of the battles fought in 1775 since 1969 it has been observed on the third Monday in April in Massachusetts and in Maine. Doe. Let's get a three day weekend, Donovan, you know, fuck the 19th just make sure it's on a Monday. It's also the first day of a vacation week for public schools in both states in both states and a school holiday for many low local colleges and universities, both public and private. The day is a public school observance stay in Wisconsin. Florida law also encourages people to celebrate it like those fucking people needed an encouragement to celebrate anything else. If I could celebrate like everyday's Patriot's day, fucking meth day, though it is not treated as a public holiday.

Speaker 2:          00:11:02       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:02       Of observances in reenactments of battles occur occur. I remember going to one of those when I was a kid. I thought those people were cool as shit, shooting the guns and pretending to die and all that stuff. I thought it was awesome. Then I got older and I was like, Hey, what do you mean? If that's what he's into? All right. The Boston Marathon, he's run on Patriot's day every fucking year. Therefore, sometimes the holiday is referred to as marathon. Monday at the Boston Red Sox had been scheduled. It had been scheduled to play at home in Fenway park on Patriot's day. Every year since 1959 the games are postponed due to weather and (596) 016-0560 seven and [inaudible] 84 do I need all of this? All right, we got it. Okay. We got it. So that's what it is. It's commemorating the first battles of the American revolutions in Lexington and Concord. I thought Gettysburg was the first one.

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       That wasn't the first one. Oh, that was a civil war. Oh my God. Shaking my head. Shut up your fucking Wikipedia read and can't nobody gives a fuck about your war knowledge. Did you fight in it? Well then shut up. All right. You know, it's funny, before I came in here, right, I was watching the Celtics lose. It's a fresh loss at the time. I'm, I'm taping this Sunday night, a Celtics loss to a, a giant Jamie Foxx and the Chicago Bulls do that. Butler guy looks like Jamie Foxx. Circur like somewhere in the 90s in living color and uh, you know, fucking brutal game, brutal game, brutal game. But it was also, you know, with Isaiah losing his sister and stuff, it was Kinda like, uh, the, the drama of the game was definitely just looked at us. It's a fucking game. Look what this guy's going through, but the balls as much as they're an eighth seat, you know, let's go a little sports morning, talk radio all day. You don't leave Chicago Bulls, these bunches here or an AC. Do you have a lot of veteran presence? Ed? Can you experience? Oh,

Speaker 3:          00:12:59       would you Dwayne way will you ever ride go and

Speaker 1:          00:13:03       yeah, it's not going to be an easy one. Um, and then they got that Unabomber guy. Like, I dunno what the fuck that guy's deal is. You know what I mean? I think when I look at that guy, his do the hair do he has and the fucking facial hair.

Speaker 2:          00:13:18       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:18       I just hear his agent, you know, going like, dude, we've tried everything to get you a lucrative advertising contracts. We got nothing. So, you know, why don't you just be the crazy fucking heroin bearded face guy. Why don't we try that? Did the bird man retire yet? You know, I used to get claustrophobic looking at that guy's fucking tattoos. They just kept going higher and higher. Like the little he would choke in them. Um, very colorful, very marvel comic. Um, yeah. So we lost whatever Bam. Fucking one game. You know, what are you gonna do? I mean, we live and die, but we got one guy, we got fucking Isaiah Thomas. That's our guy. Okay? He's the fucking guy. We live and die by the threes. We don't get fucking offensive boards

Speaker 3:          00:14:02       and I'll die and get away with that in the regular season. Maco playoff time. You don't, you won't get it.

Speaker 1:          00:14:06       Oh, that's what I'm worried about. And the Bruins blow it. You blew it. We fucking blue game. We blew it. We fucking blew it a game too. I think we forgot that there was a third period. We were all impressed with ourselves. You know, we scored three goals in the second period of something like that or to something. We were up three. Here we have three to one, three to one. Everything's going good. And the cross checking cons that are, the auto was centered as Jesus Christ.

Speaker 1:          00:14:40       If one auto was centered, a fed bitched about the refereeing in that game, I saw one play like this fucking guy, he crosschecked the same guy twice, right in front of the net. The guy went down twice call. It was like every fucking third crosscheck that, uh, they would call. And then that, that color commentator was so pro auto. It was fucking ridiculous that that first one that was trying to say that, that, you know, the goal was offsides. It's like kind of, can you tell that? He definitely seems like he moves his leg, but there's no way you can see from that shitty angle from nine. I love the NHL too. It's like they're going to, they're going to implement fucking replay, but then for whatever reason they're going to have a camera on top of the God damn arena. At least that's the feed we got. It's like, how the fuck can you tell what the guys on site or not? I don't know. It might've been a good call. Might have been a bad call. I had no idea what the color common day was, was convinced. That's a doubt that they should, that they should have call that went back. Oh fuck you just go skate down the Goddamn river and go get your fucking whatever. Whatever the fuck you guys eat up there. Um, so what it was, we'll see how that one goes. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:15:49       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:15:49       I'm hoping I bows basically open the same thing for the Bruins and the Celtics. I know we're not winning the championship and either fucking league. I'm just hoping we can go as far as we can. All right. Get some good playoff experience and build on that. That's what the fuck I'm looking for. That's it. That's all. Nothing crazy. You know I didn't even look to see if a, I know the predators. They won that first game. One to nothing. A pitcher's duel. See, wow. See what the fuck happened with them and game too. I know the fucking ranges and the fucking Canadians are playing. What do we got here? What's going on? What's going on in the world? The NHL fucking penguins. They're the team to beat man. Fuck the capitals till the capital's do something.

Speaker 2:          00:16:33       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:16:33       Ah, the fucking Canadians want again. God, I hate those fucking pastors. They're not going to win shit though. Blue is take a three game to none series over the wild. What else do we got here? What's going on with the phone? Come on my, can you just give me the fucking scores here? Oh, Pittsburgh wins in overtime. All right, well where's the rest of the, where's the rest of the scores? What happened yesterday? Chicago when she, should it be this difficult? Should you just go on the website and it's just all right there for mouth breathing morons like me? Is this asking too much? I went the wrong way. Nashville one five to nothing. Oh my God.

Speaker 2:          00:17:18       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:19       Anaheim's up two games to not Nashville's up two games to none. Toronto beat Washington and overtime. Ah, and I wonder, I didn't hear from fucking Josh, Adam Meyers.

Speaker 2:          00:17:30       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:30       We lost in overtime. All right, let's fuck this page. I don't want to go back and relive this shit. So, um, yeah, that's what I did today. That's what I've been doing this weekend. Hanging out with my daughter and I'm just watching the playoffs. I watched that fucking f one race and by rain whenever the hell that one was that I actually taped it this time. I had a great time watching it. And the Ferrari's when again, when again, what's his face one it and I didn't write down his name. One of those v guys want it. You know, Hamilton got fucking penalize five seconds for driving too slow, slowing up Ricardo. And then people would go and like, Hey, you know what? I don't think he should have been a, I don't think he should have been penalized for uh, for fucking, basically what was happening was Mercedes was pitting both their cars at the same fucking time, you know, so the other guys in there, the guy was not Nico Rosberg, he's in there, that bolt to Skye. Right. And he's fucking sitting there. It's basically, it's like when the jet pulls into the airport, you know, and the, and you're all excited. You're 20 minutes fucking early. But then the guy gets on, catch me Qa,

Speaker 4:          00:18:43       she could see what you arrived about 11 minutes early yet. Fortunately our gate is still occupied, so wow.

Speaker 1:          00:18:52       Well he doesn't make a difference if we get here early or not, we're still,

Speaker 4:          00:18:54       then I'll pull up to the, uh, the jet way at the same time. So

Speaker 1:          00:18:58       wow.

Speaker 4:          00:19:00       Just sit back. We'll actually as well make sure that got away.

Speaker 1:          00:19:06       Let you go enjoy the a tonic right. Same fucking thing. Okay. So he's fucking guy. Sorry. I then went on way too long. I was just trying to remember the names of the airport shit. Right. So here's the other guys for already sitting there. All right. That Boutros Boutros barley guys already fucking sitting there. So he's pulling into the pits. He knows he can't go there, so he starts slowing the fuck down, you know, causing the other fucking guy. Ricardo hit his spots open. It's like, dude, get the fuck out of the way. You know, we said it's the way the official side, but I, I actually agree with the officials because Lewis Hamilton is, uh, is, is I, you know, I haven't watched too much, but I think he's, he's like that level competitive or he will pull a little country moves like that. And I think that that's why he got paralyzed.

Speaker 1:          00:19:48       You know, cause you know, it's like, it's like when Marshawn got busted with the fucking, you know, the stick to the boss, you know what I mean? You're going to get suspended. Cause even when we know we know the other shit you've done. So I think Lewis Hamilton gets the same fucking treatment. Um, anyways, congratulations to Sebastian fettle and the Ferrari team. This has been great. Three races, Ferrari wins. One Mercedes. When's the other? Now for Ryan, once the third one I like, it's gimme a nice back and forth. Sebastian Vettel leads fucking Lewis Hamilton by seven championship points, 68 to 61. I'm telling you guys, get into it. It's like 57 laps. It's a great fucking time. Go see what the Illuminati does with their money. It's a phenomenal God damn sport. It's already way better than last year where it was just fucking the Mercedes. It was a race to the first turn and then that was it. It was over, but very, uh, very happy with it this year. Um, so anyways, um, what else did I do this weekend? I've been working out like a fucking maniac. Um, I actually got on the scale, so at one 74.

Speaker 2:          00:20:47       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       You know, I got some acting work this week. I like to be about a buck 72, you know, that's the way I kind of need to be around. So I don't look like a big headed fucking jackass, you know? Shout out to all you actresses out there who think only women deal with that. It's so hard. It's so Womack's shut up, shut up. You're in a movie, shut up. It's like, you know, how was I going to, I can't be too loud. My daughter sleeping, but my wife was watching that, keeping up with the Kardashians and they were having a tough moment in their family, you know, and they were all sitting there as you know, you know, it just, it just seems like it's one thing after another and I know a lot of families deal with that, but just, it's been really fucking, it's been really hard. And as they're saying this, they're sitting in a private jet.

Speaker 2:          00:21:36       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:21:36       Being filmed for a television show on their way to New York City and they're all sitting there with these said pound puppy looks on their faces. I don't give a fuck if I was going to my own funeral. If I was on a private jet to fucking New York City, I would be getting shit faced. The pilots would love me, you know, I wouldn't have a disrupt what they're doing up there. I would be like, I'm fucking temperate. You guys. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:22:03       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:22:04       Sitting there all sad. It's just hard because you know, with everything that happened last year to then come into this year and have more hard things to be happening, it's just really hard.

Speaker 2:          00:22:19       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:22:19       I would love to take that clip, you know, and show it to people who actually really have problems. Dual reaction video, you know, whoever's sewed together, they're fucking clothes and I'm guilty of it too. Everything. I fucking where's made in a sweatshop. I actually tried, one time there was a, there was a website called no sweat. I don't know if it still exists and they made all these clothes. None of it was sweatshop labor. And I looked at all the clothes and none of it was cool clothes. And I was like, wow, I want to do the right thing, but I can't wear that shit. All my friends are going to make fun of me.

Speaker 2:          00:22:54       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:22:55       So I put my own insecurity. I had a fucking people.

Speaker 2:          00:22:59       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:00       Working for sweatshop Labor prices, I dunno. I just know it's just really hard sometimes. Even if you are in a private jet on your wage in New York City.

Speaker 2:          00:23:09       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:23:09       Drinking Champagne. They weren't even drinking champagne. They were just sitting there and looking sad. They're big fucking brown cardio machine eyes. You know what they look like? One of those fucking creepy paintings, you know they make a kids with, remember that that artists that just had those giant fucking eyes that was like his thing. They had giant, these giant fucking creepy eyes. I gotta look that shit up there. This guy, this guy actually made a ton of money. They were considered cute in like the 70s and I always fucking hated them. I always hated him. Oh by the way, if you're wondering how the point system works in f one you get 25 points. If you come in first and you get points all the way down to 10th place, it goes 25 like (512) 108-6421 I believe that's how it goes off and then everybody else can go fuck themselves.

Speaker 1:          00:23:54       By the way. How funny was it and that guy drive them for the Honda's just bitching over the radio, but what a piece of shit his car was. He sounded like me in high school, cause if he's driving a fucking formula one race car, he said this is the most under powered race car I've ever driven in my life. They're all sitting there like die, do not on the radio. And then they cut into his car and it says Honda on the side of it. Um, anyways, uh, yeah, it was a really fascinating race because there was somewhere in the Middle East and there was, they were worried about sand blowing onto the track, which could chew up the tires and obviously fucked with the traction. Um, I don't know. The more I get into it, the more I like it. What the fuck was I looking at? Okay. Creepy big I kids.

Speaker 2:          00:24:45       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:32:22       You want me to read these two and now you want to hear this story about me trying to make fucking dumplings? Let's talk about that. A where any any fuck Anais it's out there. Any Asians listen to this podcast and anybody from the fire east migrated over here. Maybe a generation or maybe your family's like old school and they kept the tradition going so you know how to make fucking dumplings. I, I love dumplings. All right. I'm like Oprah right now. I love dogs. I fucking love dumplings. And I told you the story of when I was in Singapore and I was on my way to Hong Kong and I was in the fucking airport lounge and that con ate all the fucking dumplings. I swear to God, I don't know how it was. Belly wasn't hanging over his pants. He says little skinny motherfucker. It was like as a competitive eater, they kept bringing them out in like in like groups of like 14 in this fucking guy would eat like 11 of them.

Speaker 1:          00:33:16       It's like he was flying around the world and there was going to be no food in the God damn plane. So the best dumplings I ever fucking head. I was in Hong Kong, I went to some dim sum shit. I don't know what the hell it was, but it is a fucking art form over there. But I'll tell you here in America, they still do a great job, but the dumplings, the pots, I love him. All right. I told you guys a while ago, I was, you know, I wanted to get outside my palate and I never cooked with any of the Asian Shit even though I love it, right? So I decided that I'm going to try and make these fucking dumplings right. So of course I don't have any of the ingredients I need other than the flower. Hot Water, sugar, salt, what are the fuck else did I have?

Speaker 1:          00:34:01       And of course they had some of that with a soy sauce. I had that, but everything else I didn't have, I didn't have anything else. So I go to the white grocery store, right? I go to their little Asian section that's right next to the Mexican section that's a little bit bigger. And then everything else is just for northern Europeans. I mean that's, that's a white grocery store. That's what it's like. Okay. So I say to the guy, you got to eat his fucking chili sauce. Do you have any of the dark soy sauce? And you know, I actually asked an agent dude that worked at the fish counter and he was like, Nah man, they don't have that shit here. And I was like, do you know where I can get it? And he was like, no, I mean, I dunno where you live.

Speaker 1:          00:34:39       And I was like, all right, sorry. So I ended up going to, uh, uh, whatever it was a Korea town, Thai town, I don't know what the fuck it was. I went and I went to into this grocery store and I come walk in whole new fucking world, all these fucking noodles, all of this shit I'm looking at going, that's the stuff when I ordered, there it is right there. Right. So I'm looking for my style. I needed like corn flour and they didn't have any. So when I went to the Thai grocery store, I was looking for it and there was this Asian lady there with their mother and she sees me, the fucking white dude no round. I here looking at the shit, trying to figure stuff out. And she starts laughing. She goes, what are you trying to make? And then I laughed.

Speaker 1:          00:35:20       I sent him and try to make dumplings. So he goes, all right, what do you need? I said, I'm trying to find corn flour. And she goes, Oh, you know, it's just, you know, since she talks to her mother, we had [inaudible] down there fucking, you know, the real deal, shit, you know, bilingual shit going down and they're trying to help me find the corn. They couldn't. So I they found this other shit and that was close to it and we're like, ah, I don't know if you can use that. So I was like, I fuck it. Maybe I got to go to Chinatown. I have no fucking idea. So I thank him and they say, good luck and I leave. Then I'm standing up at the register and was hilarious. That same woman came up to me and this is what she says to me. This is like a minute later, she goes, uh, excuse me. She goes, well, you're the guy who was just talking to and immediately I'm like, oh my God, we all look alike.

Speaker 5:          00:36:04       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:36:06       So I laugh and I go, yeah. She goes, I just googled it. You can use this as a substitute. She took the time out to Google it. It's like, you know what, you, you're awesome. She said, no worries. I said, all right, see you later. So now I got a new grocery store to go to. So I come home. So I go to the meat store, I get my fucking pork and all that shit and get my ginger, right. All this shit that I'm going to put in there. So I go to make this make the filling was fucking easy. My Bok Choy, fucking cutting up the green onions, all of that. It's smelling right. It's looking right, everything's going good. Then I go to do the fucking dough and it, God damn it, that was a motherfucker.

Speaker 2:          00:36:41       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:36:41       Not Mixing it up. Mixing it up was easy, but like, just trying to make them into a round circle was, uh, that was not easy. Forget about folding them up and uh, so whatever. I put a little oil in the pan. It took me forever. It took me like two hours to do this whole thing. And I was talking to somebody else who married into an Asian family. It was just like, oh man. He goes, when they do it, they think fucking how quickly, you know, they can fucking get the dumpling together and fold it up and make it look right. It's like, it's like a fucking, it's like magic, you know? And I'm sitting there all clumsy trying to get the thing together and it took me like two hours to get the whole thing together. And for whatever reason, this fucking recipe I had like how many did I have? I had like fucking like 40 of them.

Speaker 2:          00:37:30       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37:31       Almost like I almost quit like 15 times just going like, yeah, how many times can I have ordered dumplings from the people that invented them, that know what the fuck they're doing. But I plowed ahead. Right. So we got the oil on the Pan and I just follow the thing, you know when they get nice and Golden Brown, then you pour your water in, you put the lid on him, you steam them when the water's gone, they're done. And uh, I got to tell you they were, they were ugly on a scale of one to 10, they were a strong six. Did Not look good. Too many different sizes. Even though the ladies on the, on the video show me how to do what? I still fucked that up. And um, and then, you know, I'm the worst. I have to stop fucking doing this. Cause I always go to Nia like, was it good? How does it taste? Is it good? And the second she knows I want approval.

Speaker 2:          00:38:15       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:38:16       She turns into fucking Simon Cowl.

Speaker 1:          00:38:19       She was just saying, Oh, you know, they're uh, you know, and it's like, I even said, well listen, I know these aren't great for first attempt it. That's pretty good, right? I look, you know, insecure fucking guy that I am. I need to look, just give me a little fucking feedback comedian. That's why I like stand up. How'd you guys like it? Ha ha ha. We it dead silence around it. Get it. All right. I want this one now. Do you like math? Do you like me again? You know, that's how I live my life. I lived moment to fucking moment. Not in a zen way, just in a completely insecure way. Right? So she's not giving it up and I go, so we know what's, what's, what's up. She goes to something, uh, well, I don't know. The doe is just not a, you know, she's clearly just opening them up and just eating the middle out of them. I go to, to like sticky, she goes, no, that's not the word. Um, and immediately I'm just like, Oh God, I just want to fucking just, yeah. Um, gummy.

Speaker 2:          00:39:20       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:39:21       Is that the worker? Yes. Sticky gummy. You want it to the source. How are you? Say The fucking word. So this is what happened is, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:39:34       I learned from the chef that you gotta be, you know, tasting your food. I feel ever I used to cook and I wouldn't be tasting, so I was tasting them the whole fucking way. And the chef told me, you know, by the time it's done, you're not going to want any because you've tasted so much of it. So I'd already had so many fucking dumplings the time I got it. Like I was almost a little sick and I fucking hate him. And I knew that they weren't right. But I definitely had a good time. I think I would quarter that recipe solely, only make like fucking eight of them. Then I could have fun and I could actually like take my time rather than do. It was like, I swear to God, it was so perfect that I did it during tax time because that's what it felt like. You know, when you get all your receipts all laid out and all these little balls of fucking flower. But um,

Speaker 2:          00:40:18       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:40:19       Ah, dude, this morning, like I didn't even clean up. I went downstairs and I was just like a dumplings and I had a fucking scotch. I was doing so well on my diet and next day of fucking woke up, looked like a starving child with it, like a distended belly, you know, if that should starving child was an alcoholic. And um, so I fucking, I came upstairs and just the smell of that fucking soy sauce and all that should have to all those dumplings I fucking hate. And I swear to God, I actually have a new found respect for that son of a bitch. They all adopt those dumplings in, uh, in Singapore. I don't know what the fuck that guy's stomach is made out of, but food, you can't eat all of that dough. So, um, Dan, of course eating like that kind of threw me off my diet.

Speaker 1:          00:41:04       Went to this fucking great cookout today and I, I, you know, I ate well, but not well, if you know what I mean. So who knows. Whatever I'm doing. Well, I'm doing one with the Diet. I'm still, I'm still going in the right direction. Okay. I've shaved off about eight pounds off of the fucking Christmas Ham here. Oh, bill is going to be able to fit in as suits in about another five pounds. Get down like one 71 71. That's it. Then we're trying that suit again. You know why? Cause I'm not a quitter. I hung in there with the dumplings some, but I'm not going to fucking go down to the, I'm not, I'm not going to be that guy. I told you guys then I'm not going to be the guy that goes down to the dry cleaners and it has this fucking suits.

Speaker 1:          00:41:39       Let out sitting here with you. Fucking shoulders slumped. All right? And if you're, if you're in that right now, if you're doing that right now, you got to keep one fucking suit. Okay. That you don't do that too.

That was a nice little flippy do that you did there because I respect you. I'm going to be honest with you. If I didn't respect you, I would just be like, oh yeah, everything you do is amazing. Well wait, that didn't come out right either. What I'm trying to say is, I think they put forth a great, I'm just going to, you keep talking your way down this fucking well, I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. Yeah. Okay. Well, you know what? I realize I respect you too. What does that mean? It means I'm going to start being as honest as you are. That's what I'm going to do. What is it exactly that you're upset with me about?

Speaker 1:          00:46:49       Cause you can't just be like, you know, they're, they're all right then a great, that would be perfect, but you have to be like, um, there's something with the dough and I was just like, is it sticky? You're like, wow, Ooh, that's not the word. Oh, she's just let me just put two behind my ear and I'll move onto the next fucking meal. Then you had to finally just be like on gummy sat the word.

I heard you the email you read a couple of weeks ago about the older guy who was wondering if it was worth it to lay off the booze and reconnect with his family. I can tell you I wasn't as bad as that guy, but it made me realize I could be a better person. I quit boozing two days after I heard his story. I called my brother and I started a dialogue. I should've started eight years ago. I used to listen to you talk about boobs and think it was an excuse to keep boozing, not placing the blame on you. I'm a moron. Well, yeah, I mean, I don't know you so I wouldn't think that you were trying to blame me. I wouldn't accept the blame either. Uh, but then I realized you don't drink all day every day and that you have a full career in a kid and a wife. I have a plumbing and heating job and a terrier. I still smoke weed because it helps with my arthritis, which is actually very severe and prevents me from doing things. It just picturing you're jerking off. God Damn it. I can't, I can't sustain. It prevents me from doing things like running and lifting comfortably. Uh, the call to my brother initiated. Um, well I bet taking all that booze out of your system would probably help out. I don't think booze and is good for your joints. Is it all that sugar?

Speaker 1:          00:50:46       I don't, I don't, I, I always just repeat shit that I half listened to. I'm sorry. The call my brother initiated his inviting me to Easter. Nice. The first holiday I was spelling my family and almost nine years. Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. All right, well, I don't know what you thanking me for. You did it. I don't know that I said anything. By the way. My wife was watching Dr Phil.

Speaker 2:          00:51:08       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:51:09       And they had this fucking guy on there. I, I, it was one of the most fucked up things I've ever seen on TV. This guy was basically going on the Internet. He was into conspiracy theory and he lost his job and he went and got into this meditating thing and he said he had reached this spiritual plane.

Speaker 2:          00:51:28       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:51:28       Um, of constant meditation. And nobody and he couldn't explain it to anybody around him, like his wife and doctor. Phil's trying to talk to the guy and he goes and he just kept going like, so what are you trying, you're, you're meditating, you're on the Internet, you're meditating. And then the guy just kept taking this arrogant like line with him going. Yeah, see once again, I mean you'd have to read up. I mean I can't just explain this to you. I can send you links on to try to get to my level basically of higher thinking. And then doctor Phil's like Dow, talk down to me. K, first of all, you don't know me. I'm one of the most open minded people you're ever going to me. First of all, who the fuck says that about themselves? Oh, I'm one of the greatest people I've ever met.

Speaker 1:          00:52:18       Right? So long story short, they bring in Deepak Chopra. All right, another whore of spirituality. You know, he's a horror of psychology and this fucking jerk off comes in with these fucking bright red sneakers on and sits down next to this guy and the guy's freaking out cause he feels like he's on the same plane as this guy. And then he proceeds to basically say that this guy is a abandoning his family. He picked his words carefully. I will say that about a old fucking Depok d to The motherfucking Chopra. He basically picked his words carefully, but in the end he said to Dr Phil that he feels this guy is bipolar.

Speaker 2:          00:53:04       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:53:05       this fucking poor bastard found out that he was bipolar on national television. Like, Oh and the guy fucking scissor. Excellent. He's helping people. Basically, you're bipolar. You're not reaching a higher spiritual plane as much as you are experiencing a episode.

Speaker 2:          00:53:27       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:53:29       Yeah. Just doing that judge Judy Shit, where's he's talking all tough to two minutes into it, I was like, this guy needs some serious psychological help, but I, I don't, I don't know shit.

Speaker 2:          00:53:40       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:53:40       Fucking Depok coming out with making this face. I'm trying to think who the fuck he looks like. I don't know what he looks like. Liberace.

Speaker 2:          00:53:54       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:53:54       Whatever, whatever national, what is he? Is He Indian ease? Like if, if India had a Liberace, this, this, would they ever do the fucking Michael Douglas, Matt Damon version of Liberace? If they do it in some Bollywood thing that he got to, you got to cast that guy.

Speaker 2:          00:54:09       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:54:11       Any, I love that he was just available to, does he live out in Hollywood?

Speaker 2:          00:54:16       All right.

Speaker 1:          00:54:18       Anyways, I have no fucking idea. I don't know anymore. You know, one of my favorite things too is my wife is on Instagram and Instagram's a pain in the ass because if you're not on it, you can't look at the photos and shit. And I just can't join another social media site. But one of my favorite fucking things of those people who take up pictures of themselves in their amazing bodies after they work out and rather than theirs in saying, don't I look fucking amazing, they actually act like they're trying to motivate you. You know, like reach Hashtag reached your goal.

Speaker 2:          00:54:56       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:54:58       The hashtag putting that work in. Um, I just, I think I've just, I've just become an old man now and I don't understand younger people. I just don't understand like it did the level of dose chills that you would take a picture of yourself while you're working out, you know, under the guise that you're trying to motivate people. You know, like, this isn't about me guys. This is in my eight pack. This is about you. I'm trying to, I try to inspire people with my beauty.

Speaker 2:          00:55:31       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:55:34       That's why I don't believe in Christ.

Speaker 2:          00:55:36       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:55:37       When I just see moments like that, it's just like, what is God waiting for? When are you going to send this dude back? Like, how bad does it have to get, you know, in a way, I almost blame God at this point. It's like you're enabling us. How long you going to keep letting us have the intelligence to advent these devices to further disappear up our own ass holes? As I sit on a podcast talking to myself for a fucking hour. Ah, Jesus. I swear to God. Every time. I think I'll make it a point. I just realized what a fucking hypocrite I am. All right. Little girl statue in Syria. Okay. This sounds like clickbait. You know when you see little girl finds a statue in Syria, what she does next will shock you. You know, you click on it and there's one photo in 87 ads. Fuck all of those sites. Um, all right bill for days people flooded Facebook and praise of the little girl statue they placed in front of the Wall Street bull. Everybody, mostly women and social justice warriors went on about resisting.

Speaker 2:          00:56:44       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:56:45       And how powerful the statue was. I choose to fight. Um, it turns out the little girl statue was put up by a media slash marketing company that has zero interest in doing anything but creating a buzz for themselves. Um, that's not, that's not all the bullets. Self was a piece of art erected by an independent artist. It was panned by Wall Street and they wanted it removed. The people kept it there. Everyone is a sucker. Uh, whenever that means.K O n y 2012 I cited a source below unless the rest of the twats

Speaker 2:          00:57:26       okay

Speaker 1:          00:57:26       on Facebook. Thank you. Skipped some words here. Sorry for the stomach growling. Um, also that white hat document mentoree that went everywhere about the group of volunteers that came to the aid of Syrian chemical weapons victims was part of a huge agenda to make America mad at the Syrian regime. International reporters are questioning the source of those weapons. Some think it was even, it wasn't even the Syrian government. We're all fucked. Love you love Nia. Congrats on the little lady. Um, yeah, I believe all that type of shit. I believe that type of shit. Um, I don't know if any of that type of stuff, but I definitely believe that they show images to make us fucking upset about stuff. You know, um, seems very easy to defeat terrorism. To me, all you do is just embrace the electric cars. Just make everything electric. We stopped buying oil from those guys. They don't have any money. They go bankrupt and next thing you know, they can't afford anything but rocks. We're not over there. They gradually forget about us. They go back to arguing with one another and we just slowly back away. Why don't we just do that? You know why? Because there's no money in that. That's what I think, but what do I know? All right. Terrified.

Speaker 2:          00:58:40       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:58:40       Have a threesome. Can I, can I click on this link up here? What does this link? This person sent me? I don't know why. Oh, I know why because I don't have it. I got to click on it when it's in the email. What's in the eat when it's an email? Now how do I find what the fucking email is? Live reads. Blow my, go to that. Click on inbox. Retrace all my steps. Go to the contents, scroll down, click on the link. Wait for it to open. It is now trying to load. All right, I'll get back to that in a minute. In the meantime, terrified of a threesome. Hey parentheses, insert cheap redhead insult here. Huge Fan love you. Stand up andF is for family. Thank you. I'm 20 I'm a 21 year old college student who has a girlfriend that is bisexual and beautiful as well. God bless you.

Speaker 2:          00:59:34       Woo.

Speaker 1:          00:59:35       God bless you sir. God bless you. There's no way you don't believe in God, man. God bless you. We've talked about asking girls to join us in bed and are finally getting ready to have it happen. The girl that's joining us is a girl that the both of us have gotten with in the past at different times. Ah, this is perfect. The only problem is that I get freaked the fuck out when I think about this happening. Both of the women involved are hot and experience, which is what scares me. I'm not that astounding looking of a guy, not that well in doubt. As far as my dick goes and not experienced at all. Come here. You're going to talk yourself out of this dude and not experienced at all compared to these girls. I do. I get past my fears and relaxed enough to make, to be into what's happening and make sure I make it worthwhile for both these ladies. Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. Uh, two,

Speaker 1:          01:00:32       do not fuck this up. Okay. The only way you can fuck this up is to not show up. To show up and let nature take over. Okay? It's all right to be freaked out. You're 21 years old. You've got to fucking smoking hot chicks, one of fucking banging at the same time. That's a lot. This rockstar shit. I Dunno what you do for a living, but I'm guessing you're not a fucking rockstar. So yeah, this is a, this is, this is fucking great. This is a great God damn thing. Um, you know, and if you want to, I'll just tell you girlfriend, just be like, yeah, I'm excited and I'm a, I'm got to be going to seem a little nervous. You guys are both so, but just keep paying it back cause it's so beautiful. Now things should we tell women you're lax, just follow my lead. Just do that. Just be open and honest about it. But don't take it to the fucking point that you like. Don't say all that other shit. You know, just look the guy, I could have had a bigger dick than, she's going to think, well, what the fuck am I doing this with you for? Don't go that far. All right, here's the thing dude. You definitely good looking enough. You definitely got a big enough dick. Oh, none of this shit would be happening, right? Okay. You got called up to the shell.

Speaker 1:          01:01:39       Okay. Get up to the plate and swing out of your fucking cleats. I would let them start. Let them start and then you just kind of fucking, you know, work your way in. That's all. Just start making out with both of them. That's it. Get some fucking, I dunno, I don't just, just please, please do please. For the Sunday 48 year old you who probably be doing a podcast by himself. Okay? Please don't fuck this up. Okay? Don't do not talk yourself out of this. You getting in your fucking head. All right? You've already gotten with both of them. She obviously likes you, Dick Sheiks coming back for more you girlfriends still there. This is just like, this is something else, dude, and this is a great experience for you to push past all that fucking low self esteem. All right, so man, have fucked up.

Speaker 1:          01:02:29       Have a great time. Follow up email please. All right. My girl loves me too much. No, but I can't love myself at all. All right. Hey, Billy moose knuckle. I always forget what that is. I know what a camel toe is. I don't know what a moose knuckle is. A, I'm a 22 is that a Canadian camel toe? I don't know. I'm a 22 year old college student and I've been with my girlfriend for about a year now. Things have been great. Only problem is that she's got the tendency to tell me, I love you or you're so important to me, or I adore you at least 15 times a day without any lead up. Oh yeah, that's creepy. She just does it out of the blue. I guess. It's nice to hear, but after a point it makes me wonder if she has some underlying issue.

Speaker 1:          01:03:16       I'm the first boyfriend and she's still shocked even after dating for a year that someone finds her attractive. Sorry. Hiccups are coming. I'm on top of all this. She gets weird and passive aggressive. When I suggest I have a night to myself saying things like, I guess I'll stay home alone or I'll just eat leftover soup and watch the food network. This shit kills me and I usually cave and come over. I'm an introvert at heart and need my time alone to recharge and study or read my favorite books when we're together. We mostly watch movies, talk about school or fuck, which is fine, but I need to be alone once in awhile. I have too much empathy and I'm a pushover, which doesn't help anything and it doesn't help anything. I need some advice. Do you think she has an attachment problem or is it something else?

Speaker 1:          01:04:01       Thanks and go fuck yourself. I would just work on your end of it. Whatever her issue is, it might come to a head when you just say, listen, I just need a long time. Sometimes you know, and let her pout and do whatever the fuck she wants to do. And eventually she'll accept that about you. Or she'll tell you why she's too insecure to not spend the night and you know, spend a night alone or she'll flip the fuck out and you'll be like, wow, I'm not with the right person, but I can tell you this, I'm not doing what you want to do in a relationship is the quickest way to poison the water. Okay. And I don't mean just going out and fucking around and doing all shit like that, but I mean like, you know, if you don't like going to Brunch, you have to tell him you don't like going to brunch now.

Speaker 1:          01:04:46       You still have to go to some brunches, but you're not going to be going to them all the time. All right? To not tell her that you're an introvert at heart and you need your time alone to recharge and study and all that type of shit. Read your favorite books, you know, she has to respect that about you and you got to respect that about you. Okay. Stop giving into what the fuck she wants. Um, what you, you were having a night alone every once in a while is not a crazy request. Okay. And, um, I would do that first and see how she reacts. And you might get to the bottom of why she has to say, I love you and I adore you and all of that shit 50 times a fucking day probably. Cause you're a, she's probably terrified that it's not going to end well.

Speaker 1:          01:05:31       You know, she's, if she's never had another boyfriend, I'm guessing she's around your age. Maybe that gave her some sort of complex, I don't fucking know. This is some few guys to work out, but I got to tell you this right now. If you need a long time, you got to tell her that or else you're gonna end up presenting her and the whole relationship is going to gradually start. It's fucking downward spiral. And, um, and that's it. And it crashes and Burns right in the fucking cornfield. Okay. That's it. That's the podcasts, uh, for this week. Um, I said everything that I wanted to talk about, I got Boise, Idaho coming up. Uh, this we can, yes. Next weekend I'll be out there with Rosebowl tailgate legend and puck off host all things, comedy network podcasts, or, uh, Joe part. Nick. We're going to have a great time on her up there. Um, that is all. Go fuck yourselves and I'll check in on you on Thursday.
