Speaker 1:          00:01          Hey, what's going on? It's bill burr and it's the Thursday afternoon, Monday morning podcast just before Friday.

Speaker 2:          00:10          Yay.

Speaker 1:          00:15          Sorry man. I'm running out of ways to say it. I try to do it differently every week cause I know people are starting to do mashups up and so I tried to give you some, I'm trying to give you something to work with. Um, I'm doing this on a Friday. Why you ask? It's like what the fuck bill? The Monday morning podcast is always late. Did you come up with the Thursday afternoon, Monday morning podcast just before Friday? Just just to, just to disappoint us twice in one week. Huh? Like the podcasting version of a dead beat. Father dead be dead. Why is it a dead beat father? I'll tell you why. Because there's no alliteration and on the news you can't keep people sitting there listening with their mouths, hanging out her up next dead beat fathers. Nah, that doesn't work up. Next dead beat dads wanted a doing d dead beat dads dead beat dads at [inaudible] up next on Ktl a Sarah, can you tell us your story about being married to a deadbeat dad?

Speaker 3:          01:20          Well, you know, I probably shouldn't have stuck his dick on the first date and he said I'm going to come. And for some reason I don't know what I was thinking, but I just crammed it into my clam hole and that. So we had our first kid. Well, I mean, nine months later, I'm sorry, I'm nervous because I'm on TV and right off the bat it's like he take us to Denny's and the check would come and he would be like, excuse me, I have to go to the bathroom. And I never saw him again.

Speaker 1:          01:51          We tracked him down. Dead beat dad. Danny come out of this dilapidated fucking something that begins with the day. Um, we just want to give you your chance to tell your side of the story. I love those fucking things. Those, those new stories where they expose bad people, like they give a fuck. You know what I mean? They don't give a fuck. They just know that we like sitting back watching people get in trouble. Is there anything better than that than watching somebody getting yelled at? It's fucking phenomenal. It's like you can see last week when I went off on the Burger King Guy, I didn't even know his name. I didn't even know how many fucking rounds there were. And I clearly stated that I was making fun of someone that could beat the shit out of me. Right. So what do you constitute? You chop it up. You leave out this where the part where I say I'm just some more on in a fucking in my office. It shopped the whole fucking thing up and then you start put, oh, a fucking comedian goes on rent. What are you doing nia? I'm giving these guys shit for, they fucked me over last week. I you're talking about a safe corner [inaudible] hour. Yeah. Neil loves him. A great guy.

Speaker 3:          03:00          But I did tweet that. I was giving that, uh, that when a little bit of the side, I know he'd be, they stopped it because obviously that guy was gassed or something would've got hurt. Think so. Like it's just, I feel like he was this, can't do this again. We can't do this again. Not to down, but not out obviously. I don't know all the rules, but he knocked him down shore and then he covered his head. We don't protect this head. One of the thoughts or anything. We were just excited for the underdog. We were showing, I met grant and we were like, how bad ass is? That guy's chest tattoo though. You got to being about his bad ass. You've got to be in the sickest shape ever to pull off the fucking that guy. He's basically signed himself up to fucking pull up like pushups and spin classes for the rest of his fucking life. Spin classes now. But you know, some of it because he's been on TV kicking people's asses. Then he can just be like, well I did that and that's why I had so much shit. Like, that's the thing that's so hilarious about him and the shaver gets him in trouble. Do me a favor, tell me, tell them the tea story and then I got to blow through the rest of this and then I got a, I got to drop my truck off to get the story.

Speaker 3:          04:10          So I'll, I'll say Aka bills add or just not paying attention. Maybe. No, that's not true. Knees laying in bed. She's like, oh, can you go get me some tea? Cause when you get married you're also like a waiter and bill's like, Ooh, Ooh, Ooh. Do you want, I say I like I a cup of green tea would be lovely. Just not the caffeinated coffee. He said, not the caffeinated, caffeinated, regular, you know, what did I say? And you went, Oh hey, I knocked the cafeteria and then you walked out the door and I just sat there thinking he's not going to get this right.

Speaker 3:          04:49          He's not. And sure enough, he came downstairs with your big sweet smile. Hey goes sweetie. And sure enough, it's the decaffeinated. See when I told you we cannot, not the cafe. I thought there was the caffeinated and not to caffeinated. So when you said not the captain and I was like, Oh, good to caffeinated. I thought it was like fiction and nonfiction. I don't drink tea or coffee. So I was like, all right, that's not to caffeinated, caffeinated. What you should have said. Oh No, I should, I wasn't thinking you should have said no, I was not, not the captain. And we have to use a double negative to get your brain to work correctly. Well, you'd say, well I want a book, not nonfiction. No, you wouldn't say that. You would say I want a fiction book. I just, but yeah, but you can also say, I want a book, not nonfiction also. That means fiction new for you. If I just said green tea, you would just listen. You would have screwed it up regardless. It's like get any points for trying. I you do. And you were very sweet to even gave me a cup of tea. Oh, don't talk to me like I'm fucking

Speaker 1:          05:58          neck against some mental issue. Well, you were very sweet. Is that what I am? I'm that person. The person who is never going to get laid and just stays in his hometown for the rest of his life. He's sweet. Can you help me carry this thing that's really heavy? I don't think that's what's happened, but you are me. You are pretty, uh, I'm pretty, what's the word? Slow on the uptake. Alright, listen, I gotta knock this out cause I gotta drop my truck off today. All right, you've got to follow me. Okay. All right. That's it for me. Well, I gotta I gotta go.

Speaker 4:          06:28          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          06:28          I got to trash them. I was pretty good. I got to trash him for, uh, you know, I was making fun of the guy there and the tidy whities that's what I, one thing I did like about Conor McGregor is that when he was going on that Greg our, when he came out and the tighty whities what saying what I did like about that is you got an idea of what it would be like if you broke into his home in the middle of the night. He come out with that crazy luck that he did between round one and two, like, hey, you want to come out in his bare feet a fucking put his heel, he, you'd sit, he do this spinning thing. The best sound, even though you're getting your ass kicked, would be him running across the hardwood floor, the slap of his feet.

Speaker 1:          07:13          And then he do this spinning thing. Just like, then he started with a spinning kick or was that somebody, I think he did. And that would be right at him or was that the, it all ran together. I forgot to say the fight before the fight of the night. Bloody like nightmare over there. Yeah, that was a two were the sickest warriors. I've deaf guy. Finally his fucking nose just exploded. It was unreal. She near wanted all race. I was like, no, I have to, what? I've got to Wa I live, I'm such a fucking tub of shit that I have to watch guys fighting at that level just to get myself to take my dog on a hike.

Speaker 3:          07:45          And you know what, we fast forwarded through it but I uh, I think I read that Sinead O'connor like came out and sang with Conor McGregor. I'm only going to say it like that from now on, so I have to go back and watch that. I mean I don't, I, I think I read that on the Internet but I may be wrong. I have to go back

Speaker 1:          07:59          and chill. It's funny you brought her up and I know she doesn't think this thing sing this song, but I thought it was that the who married the old creepy guy that's saying on the boat,

Speaker 3:          08:09          let's say, let's say another episode of what is bill talking about?

Speaker 4:          08:16          Woo.

Speaker 1:          08:17          Whitney Whitney Houston. Oh sorry. First done by Dolly Parton. All wait, can you tell, can you tell everybody when you were just trying to describe a gone girl, what did you call where the [inaudible] but the thing is, I know I'm wrong, but I do it like I do it like the $10,000 pyramid. I just start throwing clues where the bitch really though, that's a really brilliant, because Hollywood keeps remaking movies now. Cause everybody stole the movies so they can't, they can't do anything originally. Marcus, what's the point? They just got to keep doing shit that works. So they'll do the black version of it will, which will be where the bitch go. And then Paul, Paul, Paul C we'll do, we'll do the all female one. An alternative to a fucking 10 zillion dollar a comedy. Where'd the dude bro Go? I don't know where it would be. I don't know what it'd be.

Speaker 1:          09:11          All right, let me, let me finish this so I can get outta here. So as I mentioned today, very exciting day for me is uh, my, the power steering in the air conditioning units. Would it be him motors came in from my truck. So a, for those of you is not mechanically inclined as myself. I've since learned the amount, those on the front of the engine, you know that belt that goes all around, it's just using the front end of the crank shaft and that's what turns the fucking motor. Then that's what gets it going. I don't fucking know. That's how it works. Um, at least that's how it gets the motor going. That's a very simplistic version of it. So now my truck will have power steering, which, you know, I was one of those guys, I'm going to keep it all original. I'm going to keep it all original, but like, you know, it had drum brakes and just driving out here, drum brakes, no power steering original suspension.

Speaker 1:          09:55          It's every time I went over a bump I had to hold onto the seat so my head wouldn't hit the fucking ceiling. Um, the roof of the cab there if it was a significant one. And um, you know, if there's somebody behind me and I'm trying to parallel park and I'm holding them up, you know, that panic, I got to get in the spot, I would literally be out of breath. And, um, so anyways, so I'm, I'm just updating it, keeping, I still kept it three on the tree. I got the whole engine redone, it's running, it's running so well. I'm not scared about saying how fucking great it's running. Um, so today I'm getting the, uh, the power steering in the air conditioning done. And then also I went on Ebay and, uh, I have an aftermarket horn on my truck and it's just the high note.

Speaker 1:          10:39          So it's like, hey, it's such a bad ass truck. And an I beeped the horn and it just sounds like the worst fucking thing ever. So I found somebody, uh, I don't know how the fuck they got it, took it off a truck. I had it in a junk yard, but they had the low, the low whatever, the low note and the high note. And, um, uh, they're going to slap that on. So it actually sounds like a fucking man's truck. And then I think at that point I'm done. Oh, I still need the directionals and the reverse lights to work. And that's the reason why my wife put the Kibosh on me getting a 65 galaxy. So I gotta I gotta hold off on that. She actually made a great argument. She goes, we already have one old car that constantly needs work. And I'm like, no, I'm getting to this to the point where it's going to be totally fixed.

Speaker 1:          11:22          And she just like, you know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. So whatever, I haven't given up on the fight, but sometimes you just got to realize when it'd be like, you know what, you know, stick and move. I kind of put it out there, I'll wear it down. I wear it down the same way she does when she wants a pair of fucking shoes or something. But I really like, um, so anyways, the continuing story, uh, of me not booze and trying to lose fucking weight, I weighed myself this morning. Um, and I'll tell you I had a rough week, you know, um, I did not Boosie and this week started off, uh, started off a little, hit her reform. Um, I was, I started, I quit. And on July 5th going on a 72 day liver cleanse, which by the way, I don't even know that that's how many days you need, you know.

Speaker 1:          12:13          Um, I basically talked to Dr. Paul [inaudible]. Paul [inaudible] was the one that says, you know, dude, I argue, you know, I heard you needed like fucking 72 days. So I just took that as law. I was like, well, that's my buddy Paul Versey. He never went to medical school. I'm sure he, he overheard it. And a bar from a us, somebody with a doctorate and something. Um, so I am going to go the 72 days considering I fucking booze like a maniac from that southern tour, the end of April, right on through, right on through to a, the July 5th. So to get everybody caught up. So I'm trying to lose three pounds a week. When I started this, I was one 86.68 and belly fat face.

Speaker 1:          12:55          Did I know the news, fat freckles exposed. Um, so last week I weighed myself. I was one 83.2 and I'm halfway through this week. Now. This week started off rough. Who? Boy? Or of one? Um, on Monday night, Monday night, I, uh, I took my lovely wife to go see steely Dan with Elvis Costello opening up and I got to tell you, that was easily, that might've been the best concert I ever saw. I mean, Elvis Costello comes out and just fucking, just destroy, like he had such it, like I'm sitting there, I'm sitting in the crowd when Elvis Costello is going to fucking open this thing. This is ridiculous. Um, you know, sky's been headline and for 40 fucking years. And, uh, he came out and he had such a sense of humor about it. He played all the, some weird Illuminati song that they were like the chosen ones. So immediately I'm like, this is going to be a, this is going to be fucking great.

Speaker 1:          13:58          And he came out, played some newer shit, played a bunch of classic hits and he just kept going and going. And what's funny about the Hollywood bowl is down low, you know, I got great fucking seats right in, down low. They have, um, they have like these like picnic tables kind of things. You can get this. And what was funny is I'm watching Elvis Costello and he went on early first. I mean, and uh, it's still light out and there was so many people eating where like it was like a groups of four. So two people who are in the front seats closer to the stage would be turning around facing the people they were talking to, eating. There was so many people turned around while Elvis was initially on stage that I was looking at so many faces. I almost felt like I was on stage.

Speaker 1:          14:43          It was fucking hilarious. But then he just went into the hits. And when he played that, uh, I don't know his shit that dayday around. Damn. Damn. Damn. Damn. Everybody fucking went nuts. And the sun had gone down. Oh well darn has set some fucking asshole. Flew right over the Hollywood bowl at about four or 500 feet. Now I am a novice. I just got my license. But as far as I know, you can't fucking do that. You can do that when it's empty. But as far as I know, and outdoor arena with the significant gathering of human beings, one hour before the event to one hour after is a temporary no fly zone. But this fucker flew over at twice.

Speaker 1:          15:27          And that was being that fucking guy with a hobby. My wife's trying to enjoy the show and I'm like, he can't, she's like shut up. So by the way, I'm embarrassed to say that I wasn't aware that um, Elvis Costello has had basically the same drummer for 40 years because I was watching the guy going after once. I was like, wow, that guy's really good at two songs I was saying near as any better than watching a professional drummer. They've got fucking fluid and just smooth. That guy is, and then I ended up looking him up, guys name is Pete Thomas does not get enough credit, but every drummer out there knows who the fuck he is and was blown away by him. All right. And then his, his night ended. I would've been fine with Elvis Costello band. I would have been fine with that. And then, um, stealy dad came out and did the greatest live band I've ever fucking seen.

Speaker 1:          16:15          How intricate and how like amazing their albums are. They came out, they sounded exactly like the albums and they got Keith Carlock on drums who played drums so fucking well that it transcended like music. He was playing drums so well I was thinking about how can I get better as a comedian. Like I want to do standup as well, if I can do it half as well as this guy's playing drums. And my wife took this amazing clip. Um, I'd even think I was so fucking blown away by his, his playing. I didn't take any video. I just sat there with my fucking John the ground. And um, this is what a bad ass he is. Two songs into the set. They played Asia and he fucking destroyed it. Absolutely destroyed it. Effortless was amazing. Just fucking amazing. How fluid isn't it fucking that Mola movement thing that he does where it looks like both of his fucking arms are doing the worm just flying down the toms.

Speaker 1:          17:12          But it wasn't overplaying. It was all tasteful. The dynamics. He just, he's a fucking beast. If you ever get a chance, cause I remember when I lived in New York, that guy would do a lot of stuff down in the village, just sit in. I would just follow him on Twitter. Uh, I'm sure he announces the live gigs and all that when he's around. If you ever just want to fucking sit like, you know, 20 feet away from arguably the greatest drummer of his fucking generation, I would say check that guy out. Um, and right now obviously he's on tour and um, it's a long story, but I got to know him a little bit through, uh, the guy who sets up all my radio tours. So he hooked us up with the tickets and then afterwards I got to fucking talk to him for two seconds.

Speaker 1:          17:49          I swear to God, just like a total fucking drummy groupie. And you know, I avoided asking him all the drum questions I wanted to ask like, can you teach me some of the fills in Asia? Can you just hammer them out here on this trashcan? I just wasn't going to do that because you know why? Because I was sober is old Billy drunk tank didn't, wasn't drinking and I, and I was aware enough not to do that. And all I needed was a couple of Mila highlights and I would've been, I would've asked him all kinds of questions and he would have been crawling up the walls trying to get away from me. So there's another reason not to drink. Um, so anyways, please go see them if you get a fucking chance. Um, I know they just played New Mexico, whatever, but they were fucking amazing.

Speaker 1:          18:31          So anyways, um, what else did I want to talk about? So, Oh, speaking of flying, I'm all over the map here today. People, I'm actually leaving tomorrow to fly up to Ottawa to play some Blues Festival where I'm doing standup outside in between two bands, which usually is a hell gig. But they're telling me that all these awesome comics have done it and it's, and it's a great gig. So I'm hoping it's going to be that. If it isn't, it's just going to be 45 awful minutes in my life. That's it. That's how I always look at him. Like, all right, this is going to suck, but in 45 minutes, it's going to be over and I'm going to be in the car and I'm going to, it's not going to matter. And I'm going to go back to my room and I'm going to, uh, put a pillow over my face and I'm going to cry myself to sleep.

Speaker 1:          19:22          I picked this job. Um, and then I do the Montreal comedy festival. And as, as mentioned, I'm playing three nights on the comedy jam. Oh, Billy woodshed there, uh, three different songs and um, and then I'm doing three shows a at a theater up there. I forget what the fuck it is, but uh, I'm really looking forward to it. And um, you know, not gonna Boosie that's going to be difficult. That was really difficult during, uh, going to a concert to not drink or anything or get any sort of a buzz. But, uh, I stuck with the waters for a minute and then I finally got like a Turkey wrap or whatever. So long story fucking short. I weighed myself today and I am the fuck was it one 81.41 81.6 I basically dropped five pounds. That's how much I boost. Just stopping boozing. I dropped five.

Speaker 1:          20:12          How hard is it to the lose five fucking pounds? It's really fucking hard for me anyways. And I dropped five pounds, so I'm, so I'm on the, I'm on the fucking road here. All right. I gotta I gotta buy next Monday. I gotta be one 80 and then I'm keeping it going three pounds a week. Everybody three pounds a week for two months. Do it with me. All right. Have you fucking oatmeal every morning with a banana and then have an apple or an orange is a snack. Somebody told me, maybe you have a couple of scrambled a couple of eggs, you know, but don't even start the egg debate with people. Uh, too much cholesterol than other people. Well, if you scramble it, you get rid of all the fuck nutrients would you want to do is soft cook it? I like good egg over easy, whatever.

Speaker 1:          20:51          I have a couple of fucking eggs. Just don't have any toast, bacon and potatoes. Just throw those on the side of a gently. That's a good fucking thing. I don't know. And then a lunch, I just been doing the fucking Turkey slices, little bit of Avocado. I'll actually have a sandwich. I don't give a fuck. I'll have a couple of slices of bread even though people say don't do that. And then I after that, it's just fucking a giant salad, some sort of fucking vegetarian thing for dinner. And then all I got to do is take my dog on a hike, do couple of pushups and uh, not fucking booze and it's been going good for me. So that's been working for me. I hope it works for you. So anyways, um, continuing on. So I've been, uh, I've been flying here, I'm trying to get my hours up.

Speaker 1:          21:36          My school recommended that I fly with an instructor for different times just to get radio calls down and I've done, um, I've done three flights and this last flight I did, I flew out to Catalina island, which a lot of people don't know about unless you live out here in La and you probably know about it. You never went to it. Um, I didn't have the time to land cause I had to go do some F is for family shit by the way, which is looking really funny by the way. We got the first episode almost totally edited and I was beyond excited, um, up until that point I was like, I don't know man. I don't know how funny this is going to be. You get all nervous. And yesterday we just fucking worked on the thing. Um, I don't know from like two o'clock to about nine o'clock at night, just tightening it up and tighten it up, tighten it up, editing it and all that type of shit.

Speaker 1:          22:25          And uh, I was able to keep my add under control. I really do hit the wall at some point where I'm like, I just, I gotta get the fuck out of here. But um, they're really good about just ignoring me when I say that. It's like he became the running joke cause I kept going. I have a hard out, I have a hard out at seven, I have to be Outta here by seven. And then it was like seven 30 and then it just became the running joke. I just kept saying, I have a hard off guys like guys, I'm not kidding around. And they, and they would just be like, oh yeah, but oh yeah, you're right here. You're going to get you out of here by seven. Um, so anyways, uh, yesterday before he went over there, I did a flight with one of my instructors out to Catalina island.

Speaker 1:          23:02          Like I said, we didn't have time to land. It's a just off the coast, about 23 miles, 24 of 25 miles off of, uh Oh wait, is that how far it is? No, I think they aren't back was like 25 miles. I think that, yeah, I think that's what it was. Anyway. So right off the coast of Vile Long Beach and uh, we flew out there and I saw my first whale, if you can believe it, we're flying out there. We got the doors off, which is actually great because if he had to do an emergency landing, that's kind of a bitch to have to fucking, you know, tried to open the Goddamn doors and shit. I just like immediately, uh, hitting the water and get the fuck out, you know? Um, so what, what is that fucking procedure? I should know that, right? Yeah. I know what it is, right?

Speaker 1:          23:49          You go into your flare and then when you pull your power, but he's a skids. Hit the water. You fucking go. You go left cyclic, right. You rolled down to the tent too, right? You go left cyclic in the fucking blade. Stop hopefully. And then you just sit there and hope somebody picks you up before the sharks get you. And that's what I was thinking when I was flying over it going like, Bill, you are fucking terrified over the ocean right now. And that was that halfway point that we got to with the altitude that we were at where it wasn't even that we fly it like 2000 feet. So basically once we got to a certain point off the coast, if we had a fucking problem, we'd have to ditch it in the fucking ocean. So you just hold onto a, that's not going to happen to me.

Speaker 1:          24:32          So anyways, we flew out there, saw up two pods of dolphins and at the altitude that we're at, they like glow and they're jumping out of the water. It looked like look like a well those little fireflies man, it was fucking amazing. And then um, the guy was a flying with, you know, he was looking for whales cause he knew I never saw him when he goes, they haven't won it. There was one that has one and know and he's like, I have controls, you have controls. I have control. So he now he's flying and I was looking and I got to watch the thing. Come right up, take a breath, you know, blow the fucking water out. Right. Take a breath and then dive down again man. It was fucking amazing. So, uh, I'll actually, you know what, I'll, I'll give you guys some pictures of that.

If I take a bus that he doesn't know who the fuck I am, I take the subway, Hey I know what the fuck I am. I go and play and they don't know the fuck I am. Something about Uber, something about singing, no more sweaty, clammy. We really meet that just connects with these cons but you know, whatever.

Speaker 1:          34:47          Um, everyday I love them by the way. And in chatting with the different drivers, some of them have really interesting stories as to why they drive with Uber. They love being their own boss. They earn great money. It's easy to start. You just need a car and a license. Driving with Uber is great for anyone who needs flexibility. Parents, this is really easy way to work under your family's schedule. They were like 20 of these points. Stone, it's, you can make extra money between classes. No more stripping layer. I just go topless. I feel it's more like an artistic thing. Um, now that now's the prime time to cash in with Uber. You'll thank me for telling you how to get paid every week.

They owe you. You want to stand it. That's still what you want to stand it. You want to stand that. That's the way to go. I'd love to keep talking, but my internet sucks here and that's going to take forever for me to fucking upload this thing. Um, anyways, that was me just checking in on you. Hey, it's Friday everybody fucking Friday. It's the fucking east coast at this point. What is it? 11 a two o'clock. You're almost there. You're almost there. Whatever. Um, anyways, uh, thanks to everybody who's been listening. Uh,

Speaker 2:          36:42          yeah.

Speaker 1:          36:42          Why don't I feel like I've got to thank everybody this week. I just had a fucking awesome week. I did. I had a fucking great week. I'm just psyched. I'm losing weight. I'm turning this ship around. You know what's funny too is fucking how much your skin clears up. You know, and I don't need you guys with your fucking horse shit when you're just going to go look up stuff about your Liverpool's because of the toxins your liver is able to get rid of. I understand that. I can also Google what the fuck happens, although nobody will give me an actual number. Why can it get an extra we'll number? Does anybody know? What is the, I mean it obviously depends on how much you boost. And I booze pretty hard, but when an ice stopped boozing, I just miss boots. Like I didn't fucking get the sweats, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          37:25          I didn't fucking get the shakes, you know, they didn't have to lock me in a room with fucking chicken broth or any of that type of shit. I just miss it. You know what I mean? There I said it, I miss it like a friend. Um, all right. That's it. I'm going to send, I'm going to upload some pictures of a flying around Catalina and I'll, oh, so, uh, I'll, I'll upload that thing of Keith Carlock killing it a while he's playing Asian. I'm telling you guys, even if you're not, even if you don't play drums, you just gotta see, you gotta see this fucking band, their horn section, that bass player, fucking everybody destroyed it. And um, you got to go see. All right. That's it. That's the, that's the podcast. And I'm going to get a little throwback here. Half hour above podcast from days gone past. And it's only a month out from fucking football season, right? There'll be, they'll be playing three seasons. Think about that. All right or don't think about it.

Speaker 7:          38:23          Oh,

Speaker 1:          39:13          let's go get something to eat. I said, all right, here's a fucking Mcdonald's right there and she's like, do you want to eat there? And started was looking down at the ground, all sad,

Speaker 6:          39:26          you know,

Speaker 1:          39:28          just doing that classic female manipulation thing. She knew I wanted to eat there. I just said there's a Mcdonald's there and then why would she say, do you want to eat there and look down at the ground? This question is for all the young male listeners, if my whispering podcast, why would a female do that? Do, do, do, do, do. I'll tell you why. Because she doesn't want, if not only does she not want to fucking eat there, she already has a place where she wants to eat. She's our, she's already had this place that she's wanting, wanting to eat at for probably a month before you ever went to Vegas. But she's not going to tell you about it because if she tells you about it that give you time to do research on it and find out how fucking expensive it was.

Speaker 6:          40:16          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          40:16          So should I take you out to eat and she looks down at the ground. So immediately, despite the fact that I know all this about females, I take the bait. Why? Where do you want to eat sweetheart? Um, there's this burger place at Mandalay bay. I heard it was really nice. Do you ever watch top chef? Uh, only when you're watching it sweetheart. I don't like that show.

Speaker 1:          40:41          Fucking show is annoying. I hate when the shift starts screaming at those people. Fucking foreign accent. He called that a fucking grilled cheese sandwich. Get the fucker in my kitchen. Hey. Hey, you think I'm fucking afraid of you? You fucking dope. You got a fucking problem with my grilled cheese sandwich. You come up like a fucking gentleman and you take me aside. Don't fucking be screaming at me. Well, I got these fucking knives in my hand. Stick it right to your God damn trachea. What you think about that? Huh? I'll give you a fucking blow holes right out the front of your fucking neck. Get out of my goddamn face before I take your value fucking hair and wash your face into this pile of shrimp. Huh? That I haven't taken the shells off so I'll give you a bunch of little razor cuts. Sorry.

Speaker 1:          41:33          That's a good shit. At Mandalay Bay. The bad shit is we go to this fucking burger place. I can't remember the name of it. We go in there and I, I order a $16 and 50 cent fucking Coby beef burger and they're talking about how it's the greatest God Damn Burger. I'll, I'll, you know the highest quality fucking meat, Yadda, fucking Yada. My girl orders one to 1615 1650 what is that kid? That's 33 bucks plus fries plus drinks, all that bullshit. You know the mob doesn't run Vegas anymore. You can't go out and get yourself a $2 stake. The whole fucking place out there now is a god damn. It's a fuck over. So whatever cost me like 40 something bucks, 50 bucks with the goddamn tip, I eat it. A aunt wasn't even that good. My girls like, how's your burger? You know what I said? I said, it's good just keeping the peace, keeping the water nice and smooth. Nice and fucking still on the horizon. Okay.

Speaker 1:          42:35          So anyways, I get back to my hotel. My girl already tells me she doesn't feel too good at that burger sitting in or like a God damn boot. And I'm like, you know what? I feel fine. I get ready to do my show. I end my button down shirt, put a little conditioner in my hair, what's left of it, shape it up a little and I head downstairs to go work the Orleans casino. The last place Carlin ever worked, the place where the smothers brothers retired, you know, smothers brothers who was so fucking edgy. They actually lost their sketch show during the Vietnam War. They did. So I forget what the sketch was, but they had the balls to say no to the network and do a sketch that was actually criticizing what the fuck we were doing over there and they lost it. God Damn Show, you know, I don't know about you guys, but for me, that's lifetime for respect. So anyways, I walked down there and I'm going through the Orleans casino and then all of a sudden it just fucking hits me. Boom. Right. My stomach, like some capsule, some time release. CIA, you're going to shit your pants fucking capsule goes off. And I know there is no question that whatever I just ate was not good for my body. And it was about to reject it one way or the other without getting crude people, when something goes into your stomach, if it's coming out, it only has two options. All right.

Speaker 1:          44:14          Anyways, I just thought of a really, really bad joke for the fucking third one and I'm not going to say it, but it involved stabbing yourself in the stomach and you can fill in the blanks on that one. All right. So anyways, um, tell him he gotta be fucking, do you gotta be shitting me? No Pun intended. So I go in the back way, the same way that Carlin used to go in, cause I've already asked everybody every fucking question. Literally so much. I'm into Carlin. How did he leave? Did he hang out now? He'd say good night and he would go right out the door and he'd be in the car and he wasn't difficult to work with. I guess he had arthritis at the end of his life. And uh, the sound guy was saying one show you forgot to take the bottle caps off the water bottles and he saw the car loan was struggling with them and when he got off because George, I'm so sorry.

Speaker 1:          45:07          I'm so sorry. And George just like whack al come. I'd come out and I don't give a shit. Don't worry. Just walked out. I guess he was a really great guy. So anyways, I'm walking through this legendary door and uh, you know, and what's worse is like, I know what's going to happen, but I know it's not going to happen for like another 15 minutes. And coincidentally the fucking show starts in 15 minutes and I'm going on first. All right? And this guy, when you're backstage, literally says 20 minutes till showtime, 20 minutes till showtime, he liked counts it down. I ain't never get nervous before shows, but this guy counting down the show is making me nervous. 15 minutes till showtime, okay. And it's starting to get worse and fuck it. Get literally gets down to two minutes before showtime. And I'm questioning, can I make it through a half hour set? And I was like, you know what? Fuck this. The show can't start without me. My opening music is Elvis Presley. Anyways, the fuck do I care? They can listen to that song.

Speaker 8:          46:15          Oh, going robe of illegals. Lose your long block her, Slam your fork and fully solve the fucking sink. A Ho, Ho,

Speaker 1:          46:23          I don't give a shit. And I said, fuck it. And I fucking ran into the bathroom. And I will spare you the details. But you know, when something either amazing or, uh, something amazing happens, they make a statue. If something horrific happens, a lot of times they will preserve the area. You know, like Dealey Plaza. Fuck a president gets his brains blown out. All of a sudden we can't change one blade, a fucking grass. The horror that happened in that fucking bathroom, ladies and gentlemen, I never do shit jokes. They should have retired that fucking bathroom. That's it. They should have just fucking, uh, air sealed it and just put a glass fucking door. Two people could look in and realize why they closed that fucking burger joint at the Mandalay Bay and a, I got to met, dude. I have, I haven't, this is Monday. I'm finally back to normal.

Speaker 1:          47:29          So there you go. There's my big shit story. I had a burger over at the fucking Mandalay bay and it almost ruined my fucking show over at the Orleans. So if you guys saw me, anybody saw me Saturday night. All right, you want to talk about a professional because I extra fucking killed on that show. If you knew what the fuck happened, just know that the next time you go to Vegas and you go to see Barry Manilow and he's singing that song, Mandy, you something and you saw amped and then you stomped and, but I still want to fuck you. Oh, Mandy. Right. Just know that he could have just been shit in his fucking brains out two minutes before he put on his ray on fucking slacks with his horrific plastic surgery is yank back face. I bet you know. I was going to say he did another facelift if he fucking shit the way I did before my show. But that's actually not true. There's no strain. There was no straining. Um, anyways. All right bill. Jesus Christ. Enough already.

Speaker 9:          48:55          All right, here we go. Here's a question for a week. Uh, Bill, let me start by saying this. This question stems from events spanning over the last six years or so. About six years ago, at the age of 20, I was about a year and a half into what at the time seemed to be a really great relationship. Coincidentally, my job and money situation was also doing really well. Um, so I decided instead of throwing my money away on rent, I'd buy a house. There you go. This guy's making the moves. He's doing well in life, buying a house. Everything's good. So far being that I always plan ahead. I purchased a rather nice house for a first home, even though I thought, uh, he said, even thought I knew it, even though I knew it was a little too much money. Um, now I didn't decide I didn't buy this to start a family or for her.

Speaker 9:          49:49          I just wanted a fucking house, uh, in the year or so after the relationship really went downhill, mainly because I was working more in spending less time and money on her. Um, okay. Uh, long story short, we split about two years later. Since then, I've had many encounters with girls. Okay. So let me, let me fix this with my awful reading. All right. Basically, this guy's dating a girl. He's making good money, doesn't want to throw his money down the toilet, paying rent. So he goes and he buys in house. And then now he's got a nut to fucking crack every month he works a little bit more. He's not spending time with his woman and it downhill plus these younger. That's pretty normal except the fact that he owns a house. So now he's in this situation, he's single, he has this really nice house and this is what's been happening since.

Speaker 9:          50:36          All right. Since then, I've had many encounters with girls. The one thing they have all had in common is their hatred and animosity towards my ex girlfriend and my house. I've even heard them say things about sleeping in a bed I bought with her or how they don't like it that I did all this with, uh, with the other girl. I've been dating a girl for about two years now and she's the same way. Uh, she even has problems with my dogs because she says they were her dogs, meaning the ex. My question is this, why is it never good enough? Well, if you're a fan of this podcast, you've already asked that question, but I think it's timeless. So I'm going to go, that's why I'm reading this again. Am I suppose to start my life over every time I want to begin a new relationship or is it that girls really always want to have what they can. They cannot have half the country nowadays are just waiting for some guy to put them up in a house and take care of everything. But when you give them the chance, they bitch because they didn't get to pick the fucking drapes.

Speaker 3:          51:43          Yeah.

Speaker 9:          51:43          Oh, this guy is making some good points near, I'm going to need your help. Paris. Uh, I don't, uh, I don't get it. I've done really well for myself and I've done it on my own. None of that had anything to do with who I was dating at the time. And I hate feeling bad because I'm trying to make, because I'm trying to better myself. What should take all right. Nia, what did you say on this? She summed it up really well here. What do you, what do you think about this guy? Just to, just to reiterate, you know, the deal. What, what, what is, uh, what is his problem? I think the problem is the kind of people that he dates, cause I don't think that they're mature enough.

Speaker 3:          52:20          So like let go of the past, you know what I mean? It's like, of course he stayed at other women, of course. You know what I mean? It's not,

Speaker 9:          52:26          yeah, but let me ask you this. If, if when I met you already had a house, right. And uh, it was, you know, it had a little bit of the female touch to it. You know what I mean? Yeah. You know what I mean? It's not like you walked in and there was just a coffee table and like fucking a play station, you know, popcorn in the cushions or whatever. Right. I'm not saying this house looks like that, but you know. Right. Yeah. No, they, it looked like, and I still had the bed that I used to bang the other one me. Then I'll say, at least she can do, dude, you can leave, switch out the bed. You know what I mean?

Speaker 3:          52:54          Led though I thought. I think that's a little, I think that's a little much, honestly. What did the little much to still have it? Yeah. He's going to buy it. Do you have much better because you don't have him buy a whole new bed just cause he's slept with somebody else on it. Ladies, can you see why this is my girl? You're the shit. Yeah, because I mean how many, when you're dating somebody and you have sex with them in their house, chances are they've had sex with somebody else in their bed before you anyway. So now all of a sudden it's like a big deal because no, he, he needs to date some more mature girls, but he's been dating someone for two years. Uh, I don't know what he's been doing. I thought you said he, I just focused on saying the words, right?

Speaker 3:          53:37          Yeah. He says, you know what? You know what this, this house could be like the lock to the lock, the door tests in them in a Bronx tale. Oh yeah, that's true. Yeah. Like if if they can't deal with and they start giving me shit, you give them the heave Ho. Exactly. I think they should get the heave Ho this is my house. This is where I fuck you want in. Well not quite so asshole, but if anything he could, you know, get some new sheets or something. You know what? I know obviously. Oh yeah. Bed, bath and beyond. I'm thinking about some new sheets. You want to help me pick out some girl would love that. Love it. Yeah. There you go. Yeah, there you go. Yeah. At what point in the relationship should he do that? You know, cause we don't like being tied down.

Speaker 3:          54:17          I want to send the wrong message. I don't want to say that I love you, but I want you to still bang me. Like at what point? I think when it's like official date, like a monogamous type thing is when you can say, hey, lets you know. Okay. All right. That's really, you answered the question, don't oversell it. You answered it. I think it's really annoying that these girls would be like, oh my God, I can't believe that, you know, this is already decorated and these are her dogs and as her house, and I can tell that she's saying that's stupid. That's how I say how la girls say favorite. That's my favorite. All right.

Speaker 9:          55:01          All right. I think that's going to be the podcast for this week. So I guess so that's your answer right there. And you know, I'm not going to always defer those, uh, to Nia, but I just think sometimes you're, you're really asking me what women are thinking and I think I've done enough trashing of women and, uh, shut up.

Speaker 3:          55:16          MMM.

Speaker 9:          55:17          I'm done enough trashing of them. And you know, that's actually a serious question here because still, you know, you don't want to get that in a situation where, I mean, you have to, I mean, literally sell the house. What if it's a bad fucking market just to appease her? That's ridiculous.
