Um, and then I do an interview so I don't want to interrupt the interview. All right. Um, basically becoming Chai Lee rose. All right. Quip everybody. The truth is, most of us, most of us are brushing our teeth wrong, not for long enough and forget to change our brush on time.

There was spaghetti hanging on your mouth. Go. And I said, well, what am I doing since high school, while I started a couple of small businesses as a, they help regular people get their businesses running and thriving with just about everything. You need to make an I an idea real these days. That means do it yourself websites. I can't believe it figured out. Diy email, social tools, and even a business phone app for your apple or Android may just for a small business. It says check them out. They'll do right by you. Well, there's no links or anything that she said. I emailed you too. This is a two parter. Have you buddy? All right, here we go. Where's the rest of this? Oh, that's it. They'll do right by you.

Speaker 1:          00:04:14       Um, all right, that's it. Now, why don't we listen to the interview here with the one and only Danica Patrick.

Speaker 2:          00:04:39       All right,

Speaker 3:          00:04:47       you ready? All right. Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Byrd is time for the Thursday, Thursday afternoon, just before Friday, Monday morning podcast. And I'm just checking in on you. Who's phone is that? Is that my phone? Um, I believe it or not. I am at the Indianapolis Motor speedway here. And uh, what is it? Bloomington. No, Indianapolis, Indiana and play Indiana speedway, Indiana. And I have a very special guest, a lovely lady coming to the podcast, the one and only Danica Patrick. Thanks. What's going on? You know, just uh, taking in the sights and sounds. Hey, I used to work in a dental office with my dad by the way. Lovely dentition. Oh, right out of the gate. Fantastic. I don't know why I've been doing the Invisalign by the way, which I think is a, uh, it's a great thing. Kind of straightened out my teeth down on the bottom, but they make it seem like they're like, hey you, you're just going to wear it for like three months and then you have like this night guard thing and I'm finding that it isn't, you kind of have to wear these things for the rest of the time or else you go right back to have him like snaggle tooth.

Speaker 3:          00:05:49       So it's kind of annoying. So they basically get you there. Like you get so happy with your new smile and then they lock you in because they're, you're on the, well, it

Speaker 4:          00:05:58       must be your fault that your teeth don't stay like this guests, you're going to have to wear them forever and they're going to, and then I'm going to owe this guy money, money, money, money. The whole time. I, I should have known. I screwed up. So anyways, I don't think you have probably some what? Straight teeth. Oh, money. Yeah. I got a little bit of money. I go out there, I tell him my shit jokes or whatever. We just went around the track in a, uh, I was saying this, this, this Camaro, the color of my pubes. It was a little wimpy that it was a, a, a, a, a convertible. They know the, do you feel like that was slowing you down rather put the top down. It should be great. We could put on some jewel, you know? Yeah. The Sarah McLaughlin, I'm just rolling around in the, you know, 40 miles an hour.

Speaker 4:          00:06:42       I've done that one of the time and I was really nervous with the other person. But you have like this steely calm where you were cruising around. You just sort of like, you know, I'm trying to make my stupid, you know, you know, I'm a dancing monkey. I'm trying to think my clown jokes. And you're just looking over like distracting was riding distracting as in you were sort of finding yourself like feeling and seeing and anticipating and getting nervous at any point? Or were you just like rolling? Like there was a couple of times you came close to the wall and I was feeling my face getting pulled in towards the wall that I was kind of like, all right. I just kept thinking, you know, she's done this a zillion times and she has to work on Sunday so she doesn't want to wreck this thing.

Speaker 4:          00:07:23       And then I was of course also thinking there's really no rollbar this is just sort of a very feminine, very fancy high quality seatbelts. Hey, how come in Indy car? Like I noticed this year in, in, in a Formula One, they have that ridiculous thing that's now it looks like it's in their, in their line of sight. Um, that little halo thing that they have going around them, they're testing the halo, just, you know, being exposed as dangerous. Right. So right there, you know, there have been drivers killed through things hitting them, um, rash parts of the car. Yeah. You never think that you think, oh, I gotta actually the cars have a little wicker on the front of the cockpit where it opens up right in front of the steering wheel, obviously have to be able to get in. Um, so it's clear, it's like a plexiglass piece.

Speaker 4:          00:08:09       Um, and that's what I'm looking through. Basically when I'm looking down the front straightaway, I'm looking at cars just before I get into the corner. I'd say I'm maybe look a little past it to the, to the left when I'm, when I'm getting into the corner. But for the most part I'm looking through it and that, that thing gets so many like chips and bugs and all kinds of stuff. Like I feel like I'm, you know, drunk by the end I'm like, I can't see what's going on. What's the scariest thing like accident you've been in like that you must at this point, the, as long as you've been doing it had like a wheel or like I would just think of a lug nut going, you know, 2000, two, one at miles an hour coming at you. I mean, that's got to be terrifying. Um, let's see. My first accident in Indycar was really big. Um, I ended up going in an ambulance to the hospital, like, you know, full speed. And I kept asking the nurses how if it looked bad. Apparently I was obsessed with the idea of like, I'm a, I'm alive, but it looked really gruesome cool. And they reminded me that I had asked them three times now. And so I didn't realize that because I was being a little forgetful.

Speaker 3:          00:09:17       Are you saying like, did you look bad?

Speaker 4:          00:09:19       No. Did the accident look bad? Like what's happened to the car? Did it look like catastrophic? Was it exciting? Was it, you know, did it look like, are you shocked? I'm here?

Speaker 3:          00:09:30       You know what I realized when I, when I came here, I went to this race and 95 and 96 I was telling you, and you know, I'm not going to lie. You want to see an accident? You want to see it. You probably, it's probably really annoying. That's like somebody going to a comedy club and wanting to see somebody bombed. But, uh, what you don't realize is you think you want it to be right in front of you cause you're not thinking of the physics that like I saw a guy hit the wall right in front of me, just really know what this tires, but it's just like he hit it there and all the, all the action was like immediately a quarter mile down the track. So you want it to happen like a half mile up the track or whatever, however far if you're really going to see all the, uh, all of the action. I feel bad saying that to you. But I did eat. I mean you want to see an amazing race. You want to see,

Speaker 4:          00:10:13       last thing you want to see accidents. Um, you know, it's a,

Speaker 3:          00:10:18       that's why I used to watch chips back in the day. It wasn't for the banter between paunch and John. It was for like the giant pile up. I'm probably dating myself. You probably don't even remember that show. I think that show came up probably before you were born. It is the little tool, but I have heard of it. You know what's great about that is they always have like these freeway pileups and that would go on for like a minute and then in the end there was always the guy that was somehow got air and went over the top of it. And if you listen to the sound effects, he was still on the gas pedal, which was the funnies. You'd think you'd hit the brakes at that point

Speaker 4:          00:10:50       in the air. They, it was in the air. You know what I had ended up learning with um, stock car racing cause I did that for seven years. Was that the best thing to do if you were about to, if you were spinning out or anything was happening was just mad. It keep the wheels straight and keep it floored.

Speaker 3:          00:11:05       Is Out mad at means. Oh Matt it put it down to the foot of down pedal to the metal. Yeah. What does that like when you drive driving that fast? Everybody's spending out, all you see is smoke and you just hope you're hitting the whole.

Speaker 4:          00:11:15       Yeah, I mean it's like poking hope, you know, you're just hoping that they clear, they clear away and the right, they're like, you know when they, when cars crash, especially stock cars and when there's lots of them. Um, cause the pileups in stock, car racing tend to be a little bit bigger than an Indy car racing. But he, but either way, generally the cars, you don't know where they're going to go there. Like football's bouncing, you throw it and it hits the ground. You're like God, which toys are going to go? And that's how it feels when you're like trying to decide where to go based on the car. Like there was a car that crashed in front of me and practice and it hit the right outside wall on the right. And then I wasn't sure if it was going to cut across the track somehow right in front of me.

Speaker 4:          00:11:55       So I just kinda waited, waited, waited, waited. And then as soon as you think you're clear, you just gun it and you just get by. I miscalculate again, if they had you miked up, if I heard you on TV or you just, you just going fuck, actually that's exactly what I'm thinking before anything happens is fun. It is. It is. Hey, so uh, what's the most, I'm just jump around here as far as like, I know you've probably got a lot of shit for being a woman, you know, in this, you know, this is a gas where I was, was stock car was a, I'm just picturing them being more sexist because I'm a northerner. Probably like when you showed up with, they're like, what are you going to do here? Darlin you're going to ride around in the pace car. Did you get a lot of, I did get people that said to me like, how are you going to handle these big cars?

Speaker 4:          00:12:40       You know, and I'm like a lot easier because they have power steering. Yeah. Plus you're hot, but they're not harder to drive physically. They're much less physical to drive. Was it like one of those Hollywood movies? Did some guy like say a bunch of sexist stuff to you and then you beat him and then the end he had to walk up and be like, [inaudible] said a bunch of sexist. I would beat him. You would in some way, maybe verbally, but probably start verbally and then I don't think it would escalate to anything physical, but I would verbally abuse them. No. Did that ever happen? Maybe I don't want you to name names. Yeah, I'm not going to talk about, do you remember a quote? Do you remember a quote, which was what did, what did you say? Remember there was a quote a long time back from a, you've got an f one hat on. Um, Bernie Ecclestone's said that women should be wearing like white, like appliances and be in the kitchen or something like that. Oh, he said that I was stupid.

Speaker 4:          00:13:40       He's asking, I'm married. It's always, I think all that stuff's funny, but, but what it does, it's drama. Then you go out and you beat the person and you prove them wrong. Right. I don't really take it that personally. I just don't. It's interesting. It creates some drama on something. Talk about, but I don't take it personally. So now you're going to a, and I'm really jealous about this is you're going to retire. I think that's awesome. I know. I think it's awesome too. I'm super excited. I'm like, you know, I there, I don't know how it feels for you when you walk out on stage or free do this with me or I don't know how you feel when you interview somebody, but like I'm just excited to be gone from that stress. Like I, I'm excited to have, I'm excited. I'm excited for less polarizing sort of emotions of, you know, so, so happy and so, so scared or so mad or so sad, but you can die doing what you do. Like my job is the most fun job ever. It's just getting there because all I think is if I retired I would be, I would never go to lax ever again and that's amazing. I would never have to connect through Heathrow, which is one of the worst experiences I ever

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       had. I had to get off, go get my bag that I checked and then like get on a bus. There was like three forms of transportation to get to a whole, the whole other side of the airport. And I just, ever since then I was just like, I'm never, why do they kiss one of the kiss? We're standing, we're right on the finish line is these tourists, they're kissing. That's the thing you do after you win the races. Kissed the bricks. Oh you do? Yeah, I don't, you know, everybody's looking at it and then watch, he's gonna walk across it. You know, he went to the men's room today will autograph it too. They're probably autographing it right now. Oh, you can sign it. I guess you guys just wear it off after like three laps here. Really? And they leave with the dream that it's still there someday. If you ever go to that race, you're going to see my name right down there.

Speaker 4:          00:15:34       Um, so yeah, like uh, she ran over my name.

Speaker 3:          00:15:38       How often do you like beat yourself up after racist? Oh, what'd you, I should say?

Speaker 2:          00:15:43       Okay,

Speaker 4:          00:15:43       Matt. Every one of them for the most part. Yeah. I mean you're always thinking about what you could've done better. I feel like that's the nature of a competitive mind of someone very driven. Like I'm not just

Speaker 3:          00:15:54       what's, what's the worst as far as like as far as racing goes, I would think you're leading with like two laps to go and then somebody gets around you, you run out of gas.

Speaker 4:          00:16:05       Running out of gas is not your fault really. So I would say that's the lesser of them. Unless they told you to say to you guy go, when you run out of gas, does he just leave the whole thing? Does he immediately get fired? I mean, I feel like I could do that fueled and you know, pull the, pull the fuel fueling hose out too soon and didn't get it full. Something like that. It would be him. Now if it was your engineers not putting enough in or not take into account what was going on and not telling you to save more, then it was them. If they told you to save fuel and you didn't, then it was you. So it could be a series of, of um,

Speaker 3:          00:16:44       Stan, what after the race is like, it's like, all right, there's a giant finger, where are we going to point it

Speaker 4:          00:16:48       a little bit? Yeah, a little bit. I think there's always, you know, given the fact that the driver has the most amount of decisions to make come race time with passing and restarts and nailing pitstops getting into your pit box while getting out of it, you know, all pit out, just you name it. Like there's so many different things. The driver has the most amount of things that could be their fault. I would say that generally before the race it's probably a little bit more on the team. Um, you know, preparing the car and then of course working on it, engineering it and making sure the changes are good and I'm getting the balance right for race day and anticipating the, the weather conditions and you know, how that will affect the car aerodynamically. So, um, those, those decisions become theirs. But then in the race, you know, the driver has a little bit more weight on the shoulders.

Speaker 3:          00:17:34       What would you have to do and the pit crew to get fired. Um, like how many times can you screw up so that guy short fuels, you're right.

Speaker 4:          00:17:43       Oh, he probably not going to get fired till after the race, but actually that's not true. There are, there are times where, um, pit crews, let's say somebody falls out of the race or sometimes there'll be the middle of the race. I think I've seen this before with like Jimmy Johnson or something, you know, um, they'll swap pit crews in the middle of the race and just be like, you know what, we need your picker of you can take ours. Really? Yeah. Just switch with different drivers, different, different guys. Changing the tires for the four different driver. It doesn't matter. Tires or tire. Sorry. Oh, so anytime we watch or I see somebody run out of gas, the fuel guys fired. If it's his fault, probably not. But um, you know, it's probably a little like baseball. Yeah. You can only, you can only can give up so many home runs before you're going to go back down to the minors.

Speaker 4:          00:18:28       Yeah. There's only so many strikes you get against yourself. All right, so you're, you're going to retire after this race. And then you mentioned you have a, you have your own line of wine. Is that what you say? I have my own, uh, my own label. I'd make my own wine. I make a jungle juice. No, I'm a big drinker and a big drinker. No, when I'm a couple of bottles down, before you get out there on the track, just take the edge off, loosen up. I can't imagine, I don't even want to take like a Tylenol before I go out, let alone it seems you just going around in that rental car. Who's kidding? Who? Glorified rental car? We just went around like that. That would be, you know, you said you were going twice as fast as this. Uh, you know, we're going half the speed of what I'm doing and car.

Speaker 4:          00:19:10       So it seems like it's a pretty terrifying sport. Yeah. Probably don't want to be drunk. Yeah, I would think that. Yeah. I make wine. So I bought a, I bought a property in Napa Valley in 2009. Smart and, uh, just dirt and then planted a vineyard and it wasn't a vineyard. You started from scratch, from scratch. How do you figure out how to do that? Uh, I had a lot of help from, um, who was my friend at that point in time. I'm a wine maker. He is my wine maker. I'm now, so, um, you know, I met him at a, it really goes back to why I started that falling out on the grapes enough. No, no, he's still my winemaker. It's all good. I met him back in 2006 on a vacation there and um, he worked at Contessa at that point only and uh, he was, um, you know, he, he was just having to be there that day.

Speaker 4:          00:20:03       It was during sort of the end of crush period. So it was November time and it was a cool, nice, beautiful morning. And you know, the valley's got a little bit of fog in it and you know, it's kind of pulling back down into, towards San Francisco, into the bay. And, you know, I'm sitting there on this beautiful grassy knoll overlooking the vineyard, rose pedals leading out to this place. Oh yeah. It's, it's a, it's not going to get real funny though, unfortunately. It's going to get more serious. [inaudible] pensive high pressure system moving down. Yeah. So, um, I just stood there and I thought, man, this is just so cool. Like how amazing would it be to have something like this someday? And that I in my mind thought

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       it was wood, most of what, $50 million. I don't know. What do I need to do this? And I thought, I don't have that kind of money yet. And, um, and then I really believe that I was like, look, I'm, I'm, I might have $50 million someday to be able to do this. But, um, but I, I started slow, so went back a couple years later and looked at some properties and Aaron Pot is to my winemakers name. Aaron kind of helped pick it. Yup. So it's illegal, isn't it? Okay. That's too many people grow it in your state. Then you have too much product and then you can't ship it out because then it becomes a federal offense once you go across state lines. Why do you know so much about this? I don't know. I'm not really a pot smoker. I'll do it occasionally. Like when I'm not drinking I'll, I just, I just get bored.

Speaker 3:          00:21:40       I just don't, I, I what I like about drinking as I feel like I earn getting buzzed. We're, you know, drinking whiskey so he got to get it down. You know what I mean? Give me another one where just like a man at the end, you're like, I drank all that whiskey. It's not even that. It's just like, I feel like, uh, like weed smoking. It's just like getting fucked up with like training wheels on it. It's like you don't have to worry you just a couple of puffs. Especially now with the stuff that, I mean I don't know what the old stuff was like cause I never tried it to like my late thirties and um, all the tests it just puts me, they'd take two puffs and then you just kind of like the two seconds I'm like, oh is kinda cool. And then I just fall asleep.

Speaker 3:          00:22:19       We're booze. Um, I don't know. A bit of a slower process. You can kind of enjoy the growing, the, the escalation of the buzz too. And I also know where it's going. I know, okay, if we controllable, if I have three of these, I know kind of where I'm going to be at, how fast I drink them. And it's not like you take one sip and that's one. It's the whole drink. If many, many sips of enjoyment, you can have a whole conversation instead of patriot. I love pass and then all of a sudden you're like, wait, yeah. You see and stuff now they, it's, it's too, you just sit there. I remember from high school basing out, right isn't that, I don't know what it's called. I thought basically was smoking like coke. All I know is I got a buddy of mine and my drugs.

Speaker 3:          00:22:57       I've never done drugs. You can tell. He can tell you still got the glow look at me. I look like, Oh cook a curmudgeon. I got a buddy of mine, he's like a, he's a year older than me and he actually kind of stopped smoking weed cause he's just like, dude, I miss the old stuff. You know what I mean? You just sort of smoked it. You felt alright. He goes, now it's just like you take two hits you, you're like tripping. And I think that's just because there's so many people grown it now and they got to have, there's be like more intense and stronger than the next. Yeah. I don't know. All I know is this just a big thing was [inaudible] somebody needs to make the Pinot noir of weed then you know it was that was that is that you're a little lighter or something. You can sort of smoke all evening maybe or sporadically through the evening. That's smart. It's a lighter red wine. You just sold the hell out of that to me. You know what, my wife wants to go up there. So

Speaker 4:          00:23:46       like, what's the difference between a, a Cabernet, Cabernet, Cabernet and hello? Marillo. Well, you know, ruined Merlow. Who's that guy who played pig vomit in, uh, in the Howard stern where I can never remember people's names. Uh, I don't remember if he had the same name as the guy who ran a league. I can't remember his name, but remember he said he was in that movie. It's like I am not drinking Merlow sideways. Yeah. I don't remember their names. I, uh, there's Paul, Giovanni, Giovanni. Yeah. So everybody who didn't know shit about wine like me, I was thinking like, oh, Merlow is like this. That's like drinking, drinking any fucking Merlo. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So for this time, literally affected sales of Marlow and Tina. No, I went up, peanut oil went up, what is your f you like a [inaudible] cab and make a cab.

Speaker 4:          00:24:33       And then we decided last year to use the cab to make a Rosacea, which turned out amazing. Um, we sold out of that really fast. Um, so luckily we're gonna be able to make more next year than we did this year. And then I have a 70 old blog coming out as well that I purchased grapes for that one. And from Knight's Valley. So. And what is, uh, what's the name of your won? Uh, it's a Latin word. So every time I say it for the first time, people are like, what? Um, but it's not that hard. It's a, the name of the wine is called Somnia, which means dream in Latin. Um, because I told you about my little dream about like having a owning, of owning the quintessence. Someday write something like I'd love to have a winery and I'd love to be able to do this whole experience and own it and make it, and yeah, it was my dream.

Speaker 4:          00:25:18       And so it's a Latin word for dream. So like insomnia or I get extreme. You make can be one on my winery. You can just pop by mine and you know, we'll be happy to ship to you whenever you like. Maybe I'll just do it in my back yard. I'll have a couple of bushes of grapes and it'll just make my own wine. Just podcast. I got to figure out how I got to figure out a way where I don't have to go to the fucking airport every six days. There's gotta be some kind of technology where you can see someone somewhere else. I know you talked to them. I know, but you can't do that. Well, we couldn't have written around Indianapolis Motor speedway at half race pace if you weren't here. So if you want the experiences and you want the connection, I appreciate you going the extra weight mile.

Speaker 4:          00:26:06       Then I did that and I'm horrible at math. Power, all the extra 1200 miles. There you go. Oh, from la? Yeah, whatever. I took the red eye, I took the still counts. Those miles still count. What are these are punishing? What other sports? Sleep or on a, on a red eye. Can you sleep on airplanes? Yeah, I can. I do, but usually you want to get the window seat so you don't get that tap, like someone's got to go up and go to the bathroom. But I had the ILS snippy me by the way. You got a weak bladder. I liked, I just drink a lot of water. Speaking of, it's a great idea. You drink a lot of waterway cause it's really good for you. Oh, okay. That wasn't challenging. It was just asking, you've got this weight. I wasn't trying to pass you.

Speaker 4:          00:26:45       I work out a lot, so I do a lot. And then you work out a lot. Is that what you do? What else do you do? Um, I sweat and race cars and uh, you don't want to go just generally a sweaty person. You're not one of those. I'm not a, you don't do that. Uh, what does that stupid thing with Crumb Yoga? No, the people where they got to run down the street. So you know that they're working out. What do you call that? Fitbit. What do you call it? Shit. It's a new kind of working out where you run down the street, like a garage door. They have it open and they're making all kinds of noise. And then crossfit. I do that. Well, can you ask me what are you gonna run down? Run down the street. Well, because you needed to accomplish your 400 meter run.

Speaker 4:          00:27:25       That's part of your workout, don't you? Don't you just trying to run by people sitting down eating brunch to make them feel guilty. Cause every time I sit down I get a little eggs. Cheese, Huh? If you had gotten done with your workout already and we're at breakfast, you'd be thinking to yourself, I've already done that. But instead you're feeling guilty. Yeah. But I would want the person to know that as they ran by me. It's a little self reflection moment. You see somebody working out and it reflects back to you that you're not, I think he blamed the victim. One of us is blaming the victim. One of us is being a jerk here right now. And I have to, only thing that makes me gets me, I feel guilty when I see somebody working out thinking to myself, I could do a two a day.

Speaker 4:          00:28:01       Right. And I do two a days as often as I can, but I'm like, man, I wish I had more time to work out. What do you, uh, what is, what is your workout crossfit mostly? Um, I do a cross between jumping jacks, you know, the, the way that the classes are usually structured, they're an hour and the beginning is some kind of a warm up, some kind of, um, just shake it out some kind of maybe a gymnastics move. Um, and there's pipe position. I already can't do this workout. Um, uh, then there's usually an Olympic lift that you work on, so deadlift cleans that we got to like squat all the way down to put a press back squat. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just [inaudible] driver side. Then there's the actual workout part and the workout is between, oh Jeez. Anywhere from like five or seven minutes to 25 minutes.

Speaker 4:          00:28:54       That's pretty much what the workouts are. In crossfit, they usually range around the 12 to 15. Why would a regular person like me ever want to put that kind of weight up over my head, squatting down, blowing out my knees and then trying to blast up. Like what is that gonna do for me is don't you want to kind of like take it easy on your body? Well, I mean [inaudible] athlete, I get, you know, um, uh, weights and um, impact on some level does actually strengthen your bones. Who said that? The people who make the weights because you got to look to see where it comes from because like in my lifetime, eggs have been good for you. Bad for you and then fruit bad for you. Yeah. So I feel like cigarettes, I did you watch what the health that I watched that and I'm like, I'm just going to die tomorrow. Oh yeah. As far as everything that's in our food, right. Oh God. And I told you sugar wasn't bad in that one. They're like, no, eggs are like smoking. And you know, sugar is just fine. I'm like, I'm so confused. Who is putting this shit out there? That's confusing me. I, that's why you have to read both sides. They were sugar is good for you. No Way. Shooters, I would've died 10 years ago. Are you two eggs every morning? I love eggs.

Speaker 5:          00:30:06       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:30:07       They taste too good to be bad. What's sent a bunch of skill too good. When I have animal meat, so I can't imagine how that's bad. It's a byproduct of the sun. If it's not made by the sun, you shouldn't eat it. I do stand by. That sounds good to me. I'd have to sit down and work that out. Like, I mean in animals, a byproduct of the sun, they eat the grass that's grown by the sun. Vegetables made by the sun. Fruits. Now is your, your uh, you know by, for the most part is your a or your cheerios made by the sun. I love true risk with any refined, but I put a, I put bananas on top of it. Made by the sun. That's better. That's maybe go for the whole banana and maybe some almond butter with it.

Speaker 5:          00:30:48       Oh boy.

Speaker 4:          00:30:50       It just literally yesterday. Oh, it's that. I would definitely want to add to that. You pasty fat, fuck or not. You are pasty but you're not, you're not the other one because I'm turning 50 next month, so I sit at least I got, I got, uh, I got to get myself in good shape here. You look good. You look like you're in shape, so don't, don't, don't look good. And then you looked away when you look good and you just sorta look down. You don't have to look down. And I was like, you look good. Um, so I get on the airplane tomorrow with a bunch of people headed to New York to do media day for the Indy 500. You have to leave here and then come back. Yeah, well actually that was Monday night. Gosh, sorry. That was Monday night after practice we went and so there's food on the airplane and so we're kind of like handing it out, you know, here, here, here, those lazy bastards come out here.

Speaker 4:          00:31:42       They don't have to leave where the Superbowl is, right. Actually every driver went there. There were like one or two drivers in each location, but up there was like 34 drivers out in America doing media Promo Fund, spread it out on TV. You know, it's not going to leave the state here. Right? Yeah, yeah, that's true. Well, look, yeah, there was a lot of local TV done, I'm sure. Um, so anyway, uh, I get on that, we get on the plane where Dan in the food out and then they're handing out like the dressings and the bread rolls and they're like, anyone want Brad? And I'm like, I look back and I'm like,

Speaker 4:          00:32:14       you know, there's absolutely nothing in that. The, the nothing in that food that's going to help you. There's zero. It's like no nutrition. It's nothing. Other drivers or, no, I told them, well there was, they weren't, there weren't any other drivers. They were just, it was a few guys, few girls on the plane. No, it's just people from Nascar or people from Indy car, my people, whatever. So anyway, um, yeah, so anyway, I told the girls that get in their bread rolls. I was like, there's nothing in that that's going to help you. Nothing is going to, so you were talking about coming into your kitchen and critiquing your food and whatever else this is, this is what I would do. So anyway, I told them, I went on a long diatribe of all the things that I, all my opinions and thoughts and feelings and they didn't, and you know what?

Speaker 4:          00:32:54       They didn't eat it. They didn't need it. There you go. When we started talking about Chia pudding in, somebody had it for breakfast the next day and they were very excited and I was like, I'm so proud of you. Well, it's Chia seeds mixed with some kind of a, of a milk of sorts. So Chia seeds are the little tiny little balls. And when they, when they come in contact with the liquid, the outs that they puff up, almost like a chia pet, like a chia pet. Um, but like, um, like a, I'm trying to think tapioca kind of thing where they, they get like a little gel membrane around the outside of the seed and I'm so it becomes more like pudding or just felt like it was on the $10,000 pyramid. All these clues and it wasn't going to guess okay. This thing and I did it kind of makes itself bigger.

Speaker 4:          00:33:38       She just add is it a grain liquid and it uh, it's not a grain. It's sound absolutely discussed putting Chia seeds. I hate porter. It's just like, it's like it was going to be something in a quit halfway before it got there. It just feels like it is kind of boring until you put stuff with it. Like fruits and you know, Granola crunchy things. I'm a whole, I'm a big fan of the, obviously my life is filled with just dualities of, you know, super stressful, super relaxed. Like there's me meditating and then there's me going 235 miles an hour. Um, and then like food wise, I like sweet and salty, combined, crunchy, creamy combined. So you hate, that. Drives me nuts. You know the, I wasn't, I was telling the story of Darryl's wouldn't want like a salted caramel ice cream. What's wrong with you?

Speaker 4:          00:34:28       No, and I don't want like a Karmic says who would want assaulted ice cream? Salted caramel ice cream. Yeah, exactly. It's just because they like you because I'm going to give them salt, salted ice cream, salted caramel ice cream. It's part of, it's, that's like a generation gap thing. Like I went in to get a, uh, an ice cream the other day. I was in San Francisco and it's one of these artists in place. Oh sure. Like pistachio, goat cheese, whatever they had, they had chocolate rose pedal or something. I was like, what happened to just chocolate? What, what is that? There's no way they put rose petals in there. That's good. Yeah, they do. They have a rosewater mist and all kinds of things. You can extract the oil from rose petals. It's very expensive, so I bet it was the most expensive ones. Why did you pick it? I know I ordered mint chocolate chip. I could just have a mint chocolate chip and they go, no, it's not in season. It's not in season. Yeah, you're making ice cream here. You're killing anybody that's ever grown. Men knows that that never dies. Oh. So it's always, we'd all creeds and I'm pretty sure chocolate chips don't ever go. I don't even have a season other than all the time. So I needed you then put the, your your knowledge, I mean a little earpiece to say that to him. So I just went to Walgreens and I walked

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       in and they had a pint of the mint stuff and I just bought that and I didn't think what killed me was I didn't want to eat the whole pint, but now I had to, cause I bought it, you know, and I was telling not to waste

Speaker 4:          00:35:47       Mama, I'm with you. I don't like to waste food either. It was really killing me to leave food on the airplane last night. And I was like, maybe I'll eat the salad. Never mind. I'll just leave it.

Speaker 3:          00:35:58       You just give it to the drug dogs as you walk out of the airport. That's what I do. Oh, I pet them. That's what I do. They still scare the shit out. I don't have any drugs on me, so I'm confident and I can go pet. I don't either. But what if the dog's having a bad day? What if it was to just to, it just, you know, it messed up. Then all of a sudden it starts staring at you. Whatever the hell it does. Well, when it's really mad at won't stare at you. Have you ever raced in Singapore? No. All right. I did a Gig in Singapore and that's where like they, you know, they put people to death all the time. I have never been so terrified walking through customs. Like I made sure I look through my bag like a thousand. I don't even, I don't even do drugs.

Speaker 3:          00:36:32       But like you get like the death penalty over there. I think you'd be able to get just something abroad like where you get locked, docked up abroad. Yeah. That made me not want to travel. Seriously. Yeah. But people kept doing dumb shit. You get the most, see what the ocean really, um, sharing my feelings. No, the ocean. Um, let's dive deeper. I would say yeah, the ocean. The ocean is my number one fear of falling overboard and just sitting there without a sharp object where I could just stab myself in the neck before the sharks get there and then kind of go under and bleed out real fast. Well yeah cause I was sitting there looking at it at Hawaii. Well, I mean what? I don't think it would sting as much as a tiger shark. Cause they come up and they take a bite out of you to see if your edible, cause they're like, what the fuck kind of fishes that.

Speaker 3:          00:37:20       Then they take a bite. I don't know. It wasn't that bad. Kind of out here in the middle of nowhere. Right. I think I'll go back in for the second and you're just sitting there and your heads above the water. You take three bites, you know, if you don't want to eat something. So it does. I can see what you're saying here. Yeah. No, it's just, it's absolutely scared of sharks. I'm scared of sharks. I'm scared of that aloneness of just being out there. So do you not like being alone period? Like are you one of those people that always going to have a buddy around? I'm a total loner. I love being alone. I like drinking alone. That's cool. Yeah, no, I actually drink

Speaker 4:          00:37:57       Glenn. You know what, I drank alone by myself after qualifying. I had a good qualifying weekend, you know, come back. It's been seven years. I qualified seventh, like as just pretty good. So I went home and everybody wanted to go out and do and stuff and I'm like, I just, you know, like, no. And I tried to see if somebody wanted to go and then they didn't text me back, so I was like, you know what? So I sat by myself and drank a glass of my own Somnia wine cause I, and then I said to my parents afterwards, cause I'm, I'm staying at my parents' house. So, uh, which was just funny. Um, I said, uh, Hey, I, uh, I took some of your wine. Um, but I, I did one that I took one, at least that I could replace for you. So I alone, I

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       know, I know the feeling. Sometimes it's just relaxing. It's nice. It gets a little weird when you go to the second glass. I'm not going to lie to you. Yeah. You're kind of like, wait, what am I doing this for? You start feeling like you're in barfly. Um, my buddy, uh, de Rosa was telling me that he goes, I love drinking a lot. He made he, Joe Rosa made it. Okay. So if he's listening and I want to thank him, but uh, oh, getting back to my diet, I didn't, I didn't get to tell you this guy, Dean del Rey, uh, you should have seen him like maybe three years ago. He looked like he had been like the stereotypical, like a cop. That's what he looked like he'd been, you know, just sitting in a cruiser eating bad food, Tacos and donuts and all of that.

Speaker 3:          00:39:13       And uh, he got diagnosed. Is having like the diabetes that you can get rid of whatever type that is. And he just had one. Yeah. He went on like this. He actually listened to the doctor. He read up on nutrition and a, he lost all of this weight. He doesn't even look like the same person. He went from like almost 200 pounds and he's a little shorter than my, I am a one was five 10 sometimes I lie, I lie on my driver's license because I'm five, nine and three quarters. I've got to bump it up. Right. That's okay. I'm five one and a half and I'd write that if I could. Yeah. What do you, what are you saying? Any driver's license? I five one I think I'd rather be if I'm going to be short and I love it real short. Go ahead.

Speaker 3:          00:39:50       Alright. I'll say fun. He looks better. He lost a bunch of weight. He looks amazing and then now he's done a bunch of us comics on the Diet, so what? Every morning I basically, I'll have like steel cut oats and then a couple eggs over easy, whichever Denley you're going to kill me. Then in between I'll have like a is z Keel toast, which is the devil is the way it tastes. But you just put almond butter and that's all right. And then uh, then Keenan, Keenan was the Shit Ma and I say keen wa I was to say nuclear Kikino Ah, I say all the grains. It has a lot of protein and fiber in it. It's actually a seat. It's not a grain. You want to five bucks cause I brought it up. Let's look it up. What do you say? Look it. Look it up.

Speaker 3:          00:40:33       Tell me, I want to know because I think it's a seed in my diet. I am missing everything has been been free. And so if this turns out to be a seed and not a grain, I don't know, even though it's called the mother of grains. Oh it is. Listen, once your podcast, once a podcast, I make a complete ass of myself and I think that this is going to be okay. Well we got like six people in here. They can probably look up whether or not keen was a grain or a seed. What's the verdict? It's a seed. Bam Patrick. I'll check Dan and crisp singles. I swear to God, somebody give me some milk here that I can drink for that victory. Um, look at that. No Way. I just blew your mind. I wish you guys could see the look on her face right now. I love it. I need to see. I love it. What the hell? Hey, the proof's in the pudding. That's a callback sweetheart was cedar grain keen. Wa is a seed

Speaker 4:          00:41:34       that harvested from the species of a plant called goosefoot. He'd a part of a part of a group of pseudo cereals making it neither our grain, neither a serial nor grain and closely related to spinach and beets. Then to cereals or grains. Holy Shit. That's it. I'm going to have, I'm going to have mind blown back on the train. I mean, look, I think you need a glass of wine right now. Oh my God. I do. I need a glass of wine and some, you know, the peanut and a war of marijuana. Apparently. I gotta be honest with you. I think this is, I've been doing this podcast for uh, coming up on 11 years. I think this is the first time anybody's ever learned anything. This is like a legendary moment. I know you have one before this airs. Can you like lay in some triumphant music in the background and there's no production quality.

Speaker 4:          00:42:27       But this is all this says, well listen, I know you have to get back to racing. I cannot even begin to tell you what an as far as like a fan of racing it. Like what a thrill that was. Every time we went down the straight away and I saw whatever you call that thing where they show the leaders and all that. The tree there. I mean this is a, it's incredible. Thank you so much for doing that. I'm definitely going to get some of your wine. Can people, you've got a website where they can order it. Somnia wine.com. You got to spell it for my listeners. So em and I u M it's phonetic. It's just a weird word. Some neat. Um, he really didn't spell it for them. On the front of the bottle, on the front of the bottle there is the, the, the, the breakdown like syllable by syllable is underneath the words so that people can, can find out some to get, I'm going to definitely going to get some of that.

Speaker 4:          00:43:13       And what should I go with? What do you think? Get the peanuts cab? No, I don't make it. I don't really like Fino actually. Okay. I'll get the Rosedale cause I love a rosy in the, no bonk, you know, wrapped round it all off. You've got, you know, summer, Spring and fall and winter covered. I'll drink them all by myself in my hotel room tonight. All right. Danica Patrick, everybody, uh, about to retire driving her last race. I'm so happy for you. You know that you, you're, you're doing what you want to do. Yeah. That's awesome. I got relaxed listening to your retirement plan, hosting the SBS and I'm hosting the SBS told me all the keys to the kingdom for that one. Yeah. Having never hosted in award shows. You said make sure you drink before you go out there, but the camera for yourself take a shot at James.

Speaker 4:          00:44:01       So if I, if I fall or if I just completely lose my train of thought. Um, basically if I end up saying boom, goes the dynamite, it's because I'm drunk. There you go. Just relax, smile. Have a good time. Make Fun of yourself. If a joke bombs, make fun of the fact that it bombed. Just be, be in the mall. You're going to be great. You're going to be great. And at some point I hope, ah, me and my wife can get up. What does, what does the name of the wine? I'm a booze guy. Somnia Napa Valley.

Speaker 2:          00:44:33       That's where the wine is. Everybody. All right, thanks for listening to podcast. Hang in there. We've got a little love a little music here and then we'll have a half hour of greatest hits from the Thursday afternoon, just before Friday, Monday morning podcast earlier my life. So anyways, I go,

Speaker 1:          00:45:03       I go to the airport and I'm taking the red eye, taking this 10 55 flight. No one fucking stop. Cause that's how I do it. All right, I'm on a good plane. Why would I want to get off it and switch and roll the dice and get on another one? You know, let's just fucking get there. When it, when I drive up to San Francisco, I don't pull over and fucking, uh, Burbank and then get hit new, another cup. We get it bill. All right.

Speaker 5:          00:45:31       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:45:31       So I get on the fucking plane, right? I use my miles, bumped myself up like a fancy person. You know, maybe, maybe I invented the cheesecake factory. People are thinking and then they see how I'm dressed and I go, oh no, he didn't vent that cheese cake factory. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:45:48       and I go to go to sit down in my seat and I go to set my bag down. I was going to set it down right in front of me. And the nice fellow sit next to me, he goes, why don't you stick it in the middle of this room? And he moved his bag out of the way. I'm like, all right, this guy's a solid dude or whatever. And then all of a sudden the waitress comes by a stewardess, whatever. She comes by, flight attendant, whatever the fuck you supposed to call him, she comes up and she, uh, could I get you juggling to Drake? And I was like, yeah, can I get out? Let me get a water please. I said, no, ice what? However you make it,

Speaker 1:          00:46:18       stop acting like it's a fucking Martini. It's war, right? Just give me a water with ice. Thank you. Um, and the, the guy next to me, he orders it doers. Neat. No, I, no nothing. Just put it in there. So they bring our drinks. All right. And I'm really thirsty. So I start sucking mine down and he just throws his back. Like it's nothing like fucking John Wayne right before he's going to turn around and beat up three guys, three mustachioed guys in the 1930s. Right? So, um, I'm just sitting there and everybody's getting on the flight and now, and I'm looking around at the passengers, you know, fucking doing whatever I'm doing. And all of a sudden the guy next to me, Mr doers goes to me. Uh, he goes, excuse me? He goes, are you afraid to fly? And I looked at it, I was like, why? He goes, are you afraid to fly? And I go, no, no, I'm not. And he goes, because all right, but you know, it's, he goes, it's okay. It's okay to tell me if you're afraid to fly. And it's immediately getting weird. And I'm like, no, I'm not afraid to fly. And then I'm thinking in my head, wait, is he afraid to fly? And that's why he's drinking the way he just drank. And now he's hoping that I'm going to be afraid to fly. So he, you know, he just wants to open up. That's what I'm thinking.

Speaker 1:          00:47:44       And I get, I'm like, yeah, no, I'm not afraid to fly.

Speaker 5:          00:47:48       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:47:48       And he won't leave it alone. He goes, all right, cause you know, you're, you're, you're fidgeting, you're looking around at other passengers.

Speaker 5:          00:47:56       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:47:57       And I'm sitting there looking at it like, is this guy fucking serious? And I go, no. I go, I'm not afraid to fly. So now I'm like, fuck this guy. I'm not talking this guy for the rest of the flight. This guy's weird man. It's like a 30. Just get paint a picture. He's like 32 year old winery in shape, but like, why are we white dude, he's got a skully cap on with fucking glasses. Um, you know, and uh,

Speaker 5:          00:48:26       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:48:26       He goes, uh, like there's like a minute of silence and people still getting on the plane and then he goes, hey, sorry about that. So we, we just, we just got off on the wrong foot. He's like, my name's So-and-so. He goes, what's your name? And then I'm thinking in my head like, what's my name? My name is frank. I wanted to give him like a by just some reason I just wanted it's bill. And he goes, oh, hey bill Nico's nice to meet you. So we shake hands and I'm just looking at, I don't have any poker face. I'm looking at the guy like, what the fuck is your problem? I'm not even trying to not, I'm not trying to be pleasant. I'm already done with this guy. So then the guy goes, oh, hey bill. He goes, why are you going to Indianapolis Bill? Right? Like he's fucking interrogating me and I,

Speaker 5:          00:49:09       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:49:10       I'm like, is this going to fucking serious? And I start doing the math in my head going, when is this guy like an air marshal or something? And I'm like, no he's not. He's fucking slamming bows over here. Fuck this guy. So I just go, I go, look, I don't, I don't have to answer your questions. That's it. And I just look straight forward. He goes, okay, now I'm concerned. Okay, I am concerned and I'm looking at, I'm like concerned about what he goes, you're fidgeting your, you, you have issues with other passengers and blah blah blah blah. He's such a Peyton like, like, dislike. He's been, I don't know what the fuck, like psychologically breaking me down. All right, so now at this, by this point, they've closed the fucking the door to the fuselage and we're starting to taxi. And I just finally look at the guy and I go,

Speaker 5:          00:50:07       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:50:08       I go, you know, I came up with the five one point. I literally stick my hand out cause he kept saying I was nervous and I stick my hand right in front of his face and I hold it level. Oh, that's what I did the first time. Yeah. I hold it level. I go, I'm not nervous. And he goes, well, anybody can do that. And that's when I was like, fuck this guy. I'm not talking to the guy. Sorry, the story up. Then Denny Denny came back, got my name. Now he's going, why are you going to Indianapolis? And I find, look at them. I say, listen pal, I'm drinking waters. You're drinking doers. Okay, there's no issue over here. And then he goes, it wasn't doers. What she gave me wasn't doers really. What was it? Some sort of spy juice. You fucking jerk off this point.

Speaker 1:          00:50:48       I want to punch him right through his fucking stupid wirey glasses. Right? So he's going like you looking around hostels. And I said something that just ticked him off. I was just sad, dude. I go, I don't have to answer your questions. All right, leave me alone. And then he goes, uh, he goes to egos. He starts going like, okay, now I am really concerned right now. He goes, why are you going to Indianapolis? And I just look at him, you know, when I stopped doing, I start doing like this Ryan Gosling, you know that little smirk that fucking Mona Lisa smile he has is he smirks his way through all this fucking movies. I do go. I go full on Ryan Gosling. Now I'm not talking to this guy and I just keep looking at him and I give him that little half a smirk and I just shake my head.

Speaker 1:          00:51:29       That's my game. Now this is Mike. It's like if you're going to be a Dick Right now with your fucking delusional authority, right? That you're going to say like, we're in fucking Guantanamo and you're going to waterboard me. Ah, there's no water, there's no board. Go Fuck Yourself. Here's my smart and I'm just going to shake my head at you like you're a fucking pathetic human being. This is what I'm doing, right? And this is the funny thing. I'm such a Dick. All they have to say to the guys, I'm a comedian, I'm going to do a sold out show there and that would make them back off, but I'm a dick. I'm like, fuck this guy. I want to see where this is going. So now he's all fucking amped up and he starts droppingF , you know, you see saying the f word, he's sitting there going, if you don't, he goes, if you don't fucking answer my question right fucking now I'm going to hit that call button was sitting in a taxi and down the fucking getting in line, I'm going to fucking hit this fucking button if you blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

Speaker 1:          00:52:18       And I'm just fucking Mona Lisa smile smirking, just shaking my head like you are a fucking retard, right? So now he sees saying the f word so much. The lay who sitting in front of me diagonally in front, right in front of him, turns around and looks at us and now my heart's racing. I'm like, where's this going? This is going to be great. I am a hundred percent fucking innocent. This guy's drunk and I think he's going to hit that button and he's going to hit that button. What's going to happen, right? I want to see what the pilot looks like. Let's see where the fuck this is going, right? So he goes, if you fuck you, he starts me such bringing his hand up to the button. Go, I'm going to hit that button. You don't have to go fucking do it. I'll hit that button and I'm sitting there smirking, and I'm thinking in my head, go ahead and hit the fucking button.

Speaker 1:          00:53:01       Let's see what happens. Let's see what happens, right? So finally, now he wants to hit the button and he can't fucking find it, and it's an in defense of him. I couldn't find it either. I was looking up there, I half wanted to hit it myself. Then he finally, he finally finds it and he hits it right? And now I'm just like, Holy Shit. What's going to happen? And he's sitting there going, yeah, Huh? You want to fucking play this game and you want to fucking play this game. And I'm surprised. I mean it took like fucking like 30 seconds before a flight attendant, the one who gave him the booze, which evidently wasn't booze comes over. And at this point we're like doing that shit where we're behind the plane, we're almost ready to take off, like we're pulling up and then stop and pull it up.

Speaker 1:          00:53:42       Then stopping as planes are taken off. So she goes, yeah, what's the problem over here? And he goes, ah, I'm not comfortable to fly with this guy. This guy, he's fidgeting, he's looking around at other fucking people. Blahblahblahblahblah he's doing all this thing right. And then the stewardess looks at me and I'm just sitting there fucking my little smart, just shaking my head that just looking at just shaking my head. Like, this guy's out of his fucking mind. I don't say a word. And this guy goes on and on and on about his fucking psycho babble about having this security risk. So she goes to, so she goes, okay. Um, any other passengers? Have you noticed anything? She talks to anybody first class, this

Speaker 1:          00:54:25       is there. Anybody notice anything odd about this guy? And The lady who was sitting right in front of the dude, Dagley's from me turns around. She goes, yeah, I've been listening to this guy, bright berating this other passenger. She's on my side and I haven't said a fucking word. This is a great, and I'm just sitting there smirking. Then they'll let it, it sucks for me and I shrug my shoulders like, I don't know what to tell you. So finally she said, sir, do you have anything to add to this? I just said, look, I'm just a guy trying to go to Indianapolis. This guy over here, he starts slamming his doors. I kind of felt like a rat when I said that. I go, he's slamming his doors. Next thing you know he's dropping the f bomb to me. Then I'm thinking, oh fuck.

Speaker 1:          00:55:07       I just said bomb, right. Fortunately nothing happens. So now another fucking, the male stewardess comes over right now. He's going like, what's going on? And the captain of the fucking, now at this point, we've pulled over in the plane, has stopped 250 people trying to get to Indianapolis and jerk off over here who can't hold his fucking alcohol, who just watched a person of interest every, every August. Evidently I have no fucking idea. Now the plane is stopped, is fucking jerk off, has stopped the plane interrogating a Goddamn comedian. Like I'm in the fucking Taliban and like he works for the CIA, right? So now we're just sitting there

Speaker 1:          00:55:52       and the captain is up front in the plane, like saying to the storage is going basically relaying, do I really have to fucking come back there? This is the last flight of the night. Is there really a God damn problem? And that was the vibe. And they finally said to the doe, sit next to me, are you going to be okay to fly with him? And at that point it appeased his fucking ego that he was somehow in control. And he goes like, you know what? Okay, it's fine. It's fine. It'll be fine. It'll be fine. So they go, okay, so now the plane's going again and now what? Now we fucking come around and he's sitting there fucking, he's in my ear and at this point I am lat, like to fucking laugh. He had me doing the podcast. That's what I'm doing. And he's sitting there going, I, he goes, you know what?

Speaker 1:          00:56:38       I'm glad. I'm glad you, I hope you fucking do. I hope you fucking try something. I'll be fucking try something one more up there. I really hope you fucking try something. And I'm just fucking like gut and laughing. Shake him at like, what are you going to fucking do to me? What are you gonna do to me? How are you gonna Punch me in the face? You fucking wire jackass. You get fucking glasses on. You know that's a federal offense. You're going to go to jail if you do that or something. I don't know what, right. So I'm just in a fucking laughing at the guy going, I actually, at one point I put my fucking little eye pillow thing on. Do you know like

Speaker 3:          00:57:14       going to sleep? Oh, I had that out too. When the stewardess was talking to me, I was like, putting it on is this total mind fuck. Like I don't know what this guy is. I'm just trying to go to Indianapolis. I'm going to sleep. And um, so I got, I got my fucking thing on, right as he's sitting there threatening me, just I was going with total passive aggressive. It's like, dude, I'm so not concerned with you. I'm literally putting a blindfold on. All right,

Speaker 1:          00:57:39       so this fucking guy, he starts going, he goes, hey. He goes, you think you fucking one this, you do, you fucking won this. He goes, my, you know, my dad is my dad. He started seeing his dad, some major CEO in Indianapolis. Doesn't sound like a fucking made up story. I swear to God, this is all true. He Goes, Mike, my dad is some, a major CEO in Indianapolis and I will have you fucking arrested. And The lady turns around again, how have you fucking arrested the second we get on the ground? I'm thinking like, for what? For what? Sitting here, you fucking loser. Learn how to hold your alcohol. All right? And he starts describing the view. Then I'm going to have, when I go to jail, like some fucking law and order episode. Oh, you're going to love it. You'll be able to see Lucas oil field and by by the bar. And I'm just sitting there cracking up laughing and then there's this pause, right? And I'm thinking finally he finally shut the fuck up. It's like a three, four minute pause. He finally just gave up because I wasn't giving them anything. I was just laughing and shaking my head. I was being a dick to him. I was cause I was enjoying it. And then there was like a three minute pause and then all of a sudden he just goes, why are you going to Indianapolis Bill?

Speaker 1:          00:58:52       So we're like 20 minutes into the flight and am I going to be honest, he's, my adrenaline was so going during all of that because I knew I didn't do anything wrong, but I thought we were literally going to go back and it was going to be fucking cops there. And if like, if, if, if, if the fucking stewardess or the pilot asked me who I am and where I'm going, I'm going to tell them I respect your authority. You're just some Jay, I don't, you don't have any authority. I don't have to answer your questions. It was pro was one of the most fun experiences I've ever had with another human being. Like when somebody thinks that they have power and you know, they don't, and all they can do is try just keep bluffing and raising their voice and start cursing at you. And if you just start laughing at them, the look on their face is fucking priceless. So

Speaker 1:          00:59:50       the last thing he said, he said, why are you going to Indianapolis Bill? Right? And I fucking started howling, just fucking holding my stomach, shaking my head and with my fucking eye pillow thing on right. And I know I'm going to get a ton of shit that I wear one of those eye, they're fucking underrated. Get the one at Brookstone where it's literally a pillow. I'm telling you, you could fall asleep 12 noon facing the sun. It's awesome. So anyways, like after he asked me what, what, you know where you're going, Bill, you like there was like a 10 minute, like probably 10 minutes had gone by and I can't fucking sleep because it's so fun. And to me I can't wait to tell the story. Every comic I know, I can't wait to try it on stage to see if it's funny or whatever. Uh, so finally I just like fuck it. Maybe I'll just get on my computer and I

Speaker 5:          01:00:40       yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:00:41       bring up my eye pillow and I like, I got to look at the guy cause I know he's fucking staring at me waiting for me to do something right. So I lifted it up, I get my fucking Mona Lisa smile going and I look over at the guy and dude, he is fucking passed out.

Speaker 1:          01:01:00       He looked like he got shot. He was sitting there like his head was just hanging straight down and anytime the plane move like his head was, I mean he got knocked out for the rest of the fucking flight. All fucking uh, what's Matt Damon's character? Jack Ryan. Hold fucking Jack Ryan over here is just, you know, the sky marshal the fucking booze bag and God knows what else he was on. He was just completely out passed out for the rest of the fucking flight. And this is what I want you to dick. I am. I was having so much fun with this guy. I start, I can't sleep. So I start slamming waters because I want to have to get up and take a piss just to see if this guy's going to freak out because this security risk is getting up and there's, the joke was on me, he never regained consciousness and then I really had to take a Piss, but I'm such a stubborn fuck.

Speaker 1:          01:01:55       I was holding it because I wanted to make sure he was awake when I got up because I was going to give them a little smirk and then I was going to get up, see, hit the call button again. Um, but he did, he didn't wake up till we hit the ground and um, and it's funny. Then he woke up and it was like four hours later. So now he had kind of slip off whatever the fuck this guy was on. And I'm sitting there smart and wait for the guy who started talking him, he won't look at me and I, and I think at that point he kind of fucking realize that maybe he got a little, uh, a little extra little too patriotic. So we stop, we stopped at the gate and everything and we're going to get up. So I grabbed my shit.

Speaker 1:          01:02:39       I get up and I'm just kinda looking at him and he won't look at me. And then the lady who was sitting in front of me had this big smile on her face. She goes, hi. She goes, how you doing? I don't want good. I go that. I go, that was an interesting one. And I said it really loud. So the guy heard and he didn't say anything and to, this is what he did to try to save face. His pillow was kind of stuck behind this kind of stuck behind his shoulder and like a weird place. So he was frustrated with it. So he, he ripped it out from behind him and kind of threw it down on the floor when he tried to do some caveman grunt to try to still have some sort of a, I don't know what. So, so that was my flight to Indianapolis people. Um, you know what, how, how far into the fucking clock has diary? That was a long thing. It was a long fucking story here.
