Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's the Monday morning podcast for Monday, January 23rd I'm sorry, February 23rd February 23rd, 2000 and uh, we'll go 15 [inaudible] I know what you're thinking. Jesus belt. What happened to your voice when we would have from my voice, it's fucking February. That's what happened to my voice. Okay. It's winter out. I was just in Southeast Asia. Blatant breathing and fucking pollution. And then I was in fucking New York City, you know, hanging out with that animal. Paul Versey. Yeah. Jesus Christ from drinking throat coat tea. I don't know what happened. I was kind of fighting off a cold all of the whole time I was in New York, but there was just so many people that I wanted to see and all of them are turned out to be raging alcoholics. So, you know, what are you going to, I've actually been doing really well. Okay. I haven't drank in like a week.

Speaker 1:          00:00:55       Oh Man. Well me and this other guy I'm on the other guy's name will, will remain nameless. I cause I'm all stolen. I don't name names. Okay. I'm not taking notes, I'm not going to write a book someday. Some tell all book about every cunt that I went out and smoked a fucking cigar with and drank booze with and all the shit that they said to me. It's a great thing about alcohol. You can't really remember it anyways, somewhere in my brain they used to be a tell all book and it's gone. And I think that's a good thing. I think it strengthens relationship friendships when you fucking drink it away. Anyways, I was staying at a hotel and a, for whatever reason, the bartender just decided that he had to do something and take inventory or some shit. So the bar was open all night and uh, it was hilarious. We was, we were staying at the hotel, right. And um, I don't, I didn't really remember what happened. It was just basically it was one of those things where the place was full and then it was half full. And then it was like me in this other comic just sitting there now, it wasn't very easy and it wasn't any of the Rosebowl legends all right. With somebody else. And we would just sit in there and uh, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:02:14       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:15       And of course, you know the tail once it gets to around four, five o'clock in the morning, right? You get a text from your lady, right? Then the text becomes a phone call and then she comes down there in her bathrobe with the fucking rolling pin and drags you up. Nia said when she came downstairs, I had his full scotch, not a full God, probably like half full scotch. And I, it was tilted so far in my hand. It was almost pouring out of the glass, but it wasn't. And um, and then the next day I had to get up early and I had to fly back to finally be back out, you know, out here at my house. And, uh, Jesus Christ, I gotta tell you, man, that's the closest I've come to. Just, you know, like you drank so much and someone just goes, okay, you want to get breakfast? And you just got to tell him to stop talking. Like, just please don't bring up breakfast or I'm going to Puke. No, no. People will be like, what? It get the fuck he talking about, but the look on my face and the dead serious tone, she just knew. So she was like, alright. And I forget what the fuck I had. I don't even remember, but I was just like, you know what? The whole freckles here, oh, Billy bread face needs to fucking shut it down for a while. So, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:03:29       you know, whatever. I'm like fucking eight days into it and I have no desire to drink again for a while. I think I'm just going to fucking, I think I might have a couple of pops towards the end of the month and then I'm going, I'm going to go clean and, and fucking a march going to go in like a lamb and out like a lamp, going to go a whole 31 days, no booze, no cigar, right? No cigars. Just going to be me and my fucking thoughts. How long has that month going to fucking drag? You know, I got to finish up some shit anyway, so I might as well do that every once in a while. You've got to give you a liver a fucking break, right when that work. Well anyways, I'm recording this Sunday night. I apologize for how lady got up. Uh, last week. I actually recorded at Monday morning and um, I just have really bad internet where I'm at. I don't know why. And uh, you know why? Because it's technology and nothing works out for me. So what I do now is I just fucking,

Speaker 2:          00:04:25       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:04:26       I'm just going to start recording. I'm going to upload them to my computer and then I'm just gonna drive to a local fucking Wifi. I'm writing a script, Coffee House and I'll just upload them there. So you cons can stop fucking bitching about it and everything will be fine.

Speaker 1:          00:04:43       But I know you guys like to bitch so it's kind of good when they're up late, you know, it'd be even better. What if I did two podcasts a week and both of them were kind of late then you could pitch twice. Maybe you could feel twice a good about your life. Would you like to add? Would you like to, what would you do? Like if I did another cause I'm thinking about doing it. In fact, you know what, maybe just maybe next week there might be a big announcement about a possible second podcast that I'm going to be doing. What should be a culmination of, uh, so maybe some classic clips from the old ones and then me also just going off on topics that you guys pick, you know, rent a rant or something like that. I don't know what the fuck I'm going to call it.

Speaker 1:          00:05:26       I don't even know what I'm going to call the podcast, you know, I don't know what the epilogue, I have no idea what the fuck I'm going to call it. But I'm thinking of doing a random Thursday every once in a while. Maybe a couple of Thursdays that was maybe slowly, I'll just do this like a fulltime fucking podcast, five days a week, like a real radio show. I'll quit doing, stand up and I'll just stay in a little tree house talking to myself five days of fucking week and you guys can slowly listen to me slip it. Uh, no, you can listen to me slowly slipped into madness, not slowly listened to me. Slip into madness. Listen to me, slowly slipping America, there's something fucking wrong with my brain. You know, the more I do this podcast, the more I understand the grades I got in high school and weren't necessarily my fault.

Speaker 1:          00:06:11       You know, I just think it's the way the thin apps with fire. So anyways, it's, it's fucking five 40 to 5:42 PM. Uh, I got a big day tomorrow I'm doing the Goddamn comedy jam again, Josh, Adam Meyers. And uh, as you guys know, I always go down there and whatever drummer, do a little bit stand up and then you jam with the band. And I always, whatever drummer I'm imitating, I always dress up like him cause uh, you know, I want to keep it, it's gotta be a go for fuck going to do it. You know, I couldn't just sit down bill burr behind a fucking, I'd look like a jerk off. But if I dress up like an idiot, then he can laugh at me and then I can play drums. And everybody has a good time and this, there's no tension there. There's nobody sitting in the crowd going, wait a minute, does he actually think that he can also do this as a profession?

Speaker 1:          00:06:55       Now I don't, I'm just having a good time. So anyways, I'm not going to tell you that drama I'm dressing up is because that's always supposed to be a surprise for the people come to the show. So anyways, um, so I'm trying to on the costume tonight, right? And I put the wig on and I got the fucking sunglasses, the jacket, the t shirt, and I'll let shit, right. And uh, I come downstairs to show Nia and as I'm going down there, right? My fucking, my dog Cleo is in the bedroom with her and the door is closed. And I'm like, what if my fucking pit bull doesn't recognize me? What's going to happen? Right? And I fucking open the door. I'm like, Hey Nia, my dog just goes, Whoa, whoa, Whoa, whoa. Fucking launches herself at the fucking door. And I closed the door and I'm going, Cleo, and I'm not taking off the wig.

Speaker 1:          00:07:39       Cause I'm thinking like she'll smell me. Right. How does this work? I'm actually doing an experiment behind this brand new door that I just fucking had put in that costs me a fucking fortune downstairs. Right. So I'm going to Cleo, it's me. Relax. Okay, relax and I, she stops barking. Then I opened it up again and as you just go blah flipping the fuck out. I finally had to take off the wig and the sunglasses. But Dude, she went to fuck this mode and when pitbulls go to fuck this mode, it's too late to take the wig off. So my wife had a totally fucking calm her down and the dog was just looking at me like sideways for like five minutes, almost like don't do that to me. You don't know how close she just came. Do you understand that? You don't know how fucking close you came.

Speaker 1:          00:08:26       I'm not shit, not pit bulls. I'm not shitting a pit bulls because once you get a pit bull, you actually realize how many other dogs act exactly like fucking pit bulls. They just don't have the capability. You know what I mean? It's like if some little twerp said, I'm going to fucking kill you. Do you just laugh and keep walking? That's like one of those little chihuahuas. But if a big guy said, I'm going to fucking kill you, you'd be, you'd be afraid. You know, like you'd call somebody and be like, can you beat that guy up for me? That's what pimples. Cause it's this little cunty dog. Every five fucking hate this dog. There's two dogs. When I walk my dog that I fucking hate. All right, there's this one little fucking dog he lives.

Speaker 2:          00:09:06       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:09:07       Whatever it's allowed to live saying he lives like he's making payments. It's fucking dog lives at this House with these people that allow him to live. Although I don't know that they fucking like the dog cause it's always outside and they have one of these driveways. It's like a little horse shoe, right? So you get know entrance and an exit could spin right around. It's probably fat. People live there, right? Fat People can't back up cars. That's why I didn't know if he know that that's why they have the backup cameras now is because the fatties when they would turn the neck fat, which stopped the head and they can only look so far and I was causing a lot of problems. So uh, that's why they had the backup camera. It's just right there. They don't have to fucking turn around. Oh, they got to do is move their eyes. They're big Fred Flintstone. Waterhead can just sit there. Right. So anyways, he's fat. He's got this dog. And uh, and what it does is when we come walking up the block,

Speaker 2:          00:10:02       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:10:02       this, it's, it's on one side of the driveway. The second is sees us, it immediately runs to the other side. Wait for us to come is probably like, you know, whatever, like 20 feet between two and it just fucking talks all the shadow, all this fucking shit. And my dog just looks at it and it's such bull. Like my dog doesn't even give a fuck. I actually react to the dog now. Like it's been bugging me. I'll take a little short step towards it. A growl at it. I do other shit like put my arms up. You know like you're supposed to do when there's a bear coming at you, which I'm sure doesn't work. Put your arms up so you look a bigger, yeah. Well My, well my arms are up. I don't look bigger than a bear, so I mean I don't see what the big fucking, if it, if I was going to step on an ant and it fucking put four of its legs in the air while it's still not two of them, I'd just be like, wow. It's a very talented and Smush, right? Isn't that what the bear is going to do?

Speaker 2:          00:10:54       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:55       I level those people with theories. What to do, what to do if you're in the water with a shark swim underneath it. They don't like the vulnerable underside of their bodies. Oh, is that what I'm going to do? I'm just casually swim underneath it and it the thing they can swim 10 times faster than me.

Speaker 1:          00:11:14       Do you know, go to fight or you are when you just use your mouth. Think about that. That thinks not worried about taking any sort of fucking, you know, mad at you if you've just fought with your mouth, you just fucking, you know, kind of what if you just put your arms out like they were fence, you cut them down by your waist and you just turn your hands out like they would fit. How many bar fights do you think it went? All right. What was the last time you saw a bear loose in a bar fight? What if a shark could go in a bar? You think it would have a loose to say could breathe, right? Yeah, but some sort of reverse auction can mass. It was like full of water. You know when you sit at the end of the Bar, right?

Speaker 1:          00:11:48       And you're fucking lady just can't stop looking at the shark down there. Right? And then you're like, you fucking looking at this all night. Will you make me a fucking jerk off? And then you went down there, you know how many punches do you think you'd get in? He fucking eat it. He your damn man. Alright, so fuck your whole, you know, put your arms up to make yourself look bigger, curl up in a ball, play dead. You know, you've only got one option. Okay? Hope you're near other humans and run near them and hope they don't see what's chasing you and maybe they get eaten. That's the move. That's the fucking move. You never go in the woods by yourself. All right? You always want to go into the woods with somebody that can't run as fast as you, and it looks a lot tastier, okay? That's called the buddy system. All right? And I don't do a lot of scuba diving is everybody knows I'm terrified of the ocean. But I would think that that would be the same case when you, like if I was scuba diving, I'm trying to think which one of my friends looks like a seal.

Speaker 1:          00:12:53       Uh, Joe to rose. It looks like an eel. Sort of like an old eel. You know, it's got a little bit of a punch. A God. Who else? I don't know. Fucking, I'm going to start this bullshit. Whatever I picked, somebody is going to be somebody. I know. Somebody I know that it looks like a Walrus, although you know walrus can kill a polar bear. God knows. We've all seen that. Right. And pull the IRIG must seen that famous youtube video with a polar bear just rather than picking on a little one. He went for the Thanksgiving dinner and went for that big one, a big one with the giant fucking teeth. It didn't even lay, got him that bed and a polar bear justice. It was like a fucking, he got shanked and that was it fucking thing like walked off. I thought it was just like regroup and like, all right, that wasn't worth it.

Speaker 1:          00:13:39       Maybe I'll, I'll live to fight another day. And it didn't, it just kind of walked away only about 50 yards and just laid down, curled up in a ball and uh, just bled out and died. I felt really bad for it too. It's weird how, you know, you fucking look at a polar bear just attack and walruses you like, it's so vicious and everything that you fucking hate the thing. But then the second you see it vulnerable, you actually kind of feel bad for it. Like you guys ever seen that Youtube video where that that pride of lions are attacking, I dunno, one of those bowls or whatever the fuck it is and one of them gets kicked in the John at breaks his jaw and his mouth is just hanging open. Like you have a Roger Rabbit right before he died, that fucking awful cancer he had.

Speaker 1:          00:14:24       That's what this line looks like, right? Just sitting there and how can I, as his mouth opened, and it was trying to play it off, but like all the other lines where Eaton and this thing was and eat and it was getting skinnier and skinnier and they're just looking at him like, dude, just, you know, either say it or shut your fucking mouth. They were just, and the thing just basically starve to death and you felt bad. You felt bad for this thing that would have no problem. Just eating alive actually don't eat you alive. They fucking go right for your throat. The worst thing is if you ever got fucking, I'd say a Komodo dragon where they just bite you and then just fucking follow you around for two days and wait for you to die because the kind of bacteria that's in their mouth, once it gets in your bloodstream, you know you had just done two days and they just sort of linger around. You just wait, this thing's just waiting to eat you.

Speaker 1:          00:15:17       He's sitting there talking to you mother fucker. It's just walking behind you. Like Jason, you know, Crystal Lake, no matter how fast you run that fucking thing, it's just lumbering along by, yeah, I would just pick up rocks and just, I would stolen it to death. You know like what you know. I don't know. Like somebody who steals an iPod and Saudi Arabia, like what they have to fucking deal with. I would treat the lizard the same fucking way. I would just be, all right, something's eating me, but not you and mother fucker. You're not going to enjoy this meal. All right. I think I would be a delicacy out there. It's pasty as I am, you know, God knows everybody likes still for fucking breast meat now. That's why they inject those chickens with all the steroids. They can't even walk because they got such big fucking, you know, breast.

Speaker 1:          00:15:59       This is now I'm talking about. All right, this is the Monday morning podcast. Everybody, I do this every single week if you're new to it. And I'm doing it a little bit early this week. Ya Know, why? Cause my fucking lady, she's downstairs, she's watching the Oscars, she's watching the pre red carpet Oscars and every year, you know, I try to hang in there, you know, I was like, all right, I know this is your Superbowl. I'll sit and I'll watch it. Much of this as I fucking can. And you know, I can only get so far. You know, it was really interesting at one point was the guy, uh, who's hosting Daniel Day Lewis, whatever his name is. Greg [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:16:40       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:16:41       Kirk, I don't know what the fuck his name is. Thomas [inaudible] Thomas House. Thomas Haden Church. It's one of those three name guys. Stiggy houser. The fuck's his name. I had it. I had it anyways. He was talking to this other gay guy, right. And I felt like the other gay guy was like the old style gay guy and the new guy. Diogenes what? I got to look up his fucking name. It's going to ruin this story. It's going to ruin this fucking story. I love when they asked the guys, what are you wearing? You know, we're all wearing Tuxedos. Does it fucking matter?

Speaker 2:          00:17:18       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:18       You know, what are you wearing a, it's Tom Ford. Oh my God. I knew it was Tom Hardy. Tom Ford. Yeah. Actually it's missed a Tux. Alright, you're dumb. Fuck. Uh, I like how Ryan Seacrest has his own line of fucking clothes. It's hilarious to me. Doogie Howser. What is his fucking name? Doogie Howser. Alright, MD. Wikipedia. Here we go. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:47       Neil. Patrick Harris. I knew that. So anyways, he's talking to this other gay dude, right? And I felt like the other gay dude, let me ask gay guys, any gay guys will listen to this. Is there a such thing as hacky gay or a zero kind of gay that fucking annoys you on television, this gotta be, you know what I mean? There's a kind of redhead that bugs me, you know what I mean? That aw shucks guy tagging along with the fucking funds. A rally guy. At what point was Richie Cunningham going to be like, hey, you know, Fonzie, you kind of a cunt, you know you're bang and everything that, well, you're not that tough. I'm fucking taller than you. They might kick my ass, but I'll get one in. I wanted to do all fucking five, 10 seasons of that. He never did it. So the other, the pudgy gay guy, like he was going, he was like, that really affected gay, like gay dude. Just go and like, uh, go over to Neil, Patrick Harris. He was going like, is there anybody in the crowd that you're just like excited to say, you know, like those gay guys that say honey, right? It's like, isn't it like hackey gay because the Pudgy guy goes, is there anybody you're excited to say? Like for me, it'd be lies them Minnelli and I just went like, really? Would it really be Liza Minnelli?

Speaker 3:          00:18:58       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:18:59       Wasn't that like funny for a gay guy to say like 30 fucking years ago? Come on. Right. I mean, I'm talking out of school here, but I just seemed like, what's his face? Neil Patrick Harris. He had like, you know,

Speaker 3:          00:19:12       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:19:13       he was a fucking human being. The other guy was just fucking, I don't know what he was doing. It was like he was uh, uh, who was in that fucking movie with that guy or hung himself. I can't remember. I can't even remember the name of the movies.

Speaker 3:          00:19:27       You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:19:30       Just because you're gay doesn't mean you're not a person. You know what I mean? It's almost like when somebody is acting regular, then all of a sudden they plug become a game show host and then they just stop being human. They just become game show host guy. Alright, let's bet the whale. I feel like when, when gay dudes that's like the gay version of doing that, I just want to shake that fat guy and just be like, who are you really? How do you, what? What do you really talk like? Um, anyways, I'm sure summer we'll fucking take a snippet of that and send it to a, we've had enough of that.com and next thing you know, there'll be another story out there, but that's what they do. And you know what, you should do that. You should take this podcast seriously, goddammit. The nerve of me to be out here joking around. Okay, this is in my park. It's your podcast and you should take it seriously. It's somehow shape it into whatever fucking cause you're trying to get an attention to. Um, anyway, so she's down there watching these, these fucking,

Speaker 3:          00:20:30       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20:31       I don't know what the hell are you? I really helped somebody gay chimes in on that because I got, as I got a sense that I'm fucking right on that one. You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:20:40       Anyways, going back. So Nias downstairs and she's just totally into it and somebody is the red carpet and she's just gone. Oh my God. No, I can't stand it. I can't. Sounds like it was a bad call, but she's actually, that's like how into the dresses she gets. And I sit there and go build, don't ruin it. Don't ruin it. Okay. Just let her enjoy this. You Watch sports, it's just as fucking stupid. If you really sit down and think about it, it's just is fucking stupid. It's just as stupid. All right. And I get more fucking upset about the outcome than she does with the Oscar. I think. You know what? I actually had to walk away from the Oscars with at one point they were like, you know all the best pictures, all of them are starring men, you know, like every fucking award show. Is that? No. Well, what the flow. Well, can't that just mean that guys make better movies this year?

Speaker 1:          00:21:38       You can't say that, can you? You gotta be like, no, no, no. The witches of Eastwick that was fucking phenomenal. Which is at Eastwick. Really?

Speaker 1:          00:33:01       All right. I uh,

Speaker 1:          00:33:04       I've gotten back into reading everybody and by reading, I mean I just, I just liked reading autobiographies right now I'm reading this actually the book about Richard Pryor. That was fucking amazing. Then I started, um, you know, I got add. So I'm always reading like two, three at a time. So reading that, the ESPN book, uh, those guys that having too much fun and I'm also tearing through Steven Adler, my favorite drummer from the 80s. I just, I've fucking, I dunno, I absolutely love the way he played. Um, and he's got a book called a my appetite for destruction, sex, drugs and guns and roses. And it was really cool as if you've already read slashes book to hear him go over like some of the same stories in his version. I mean they line up pretty good, but uh, I don't know. It's pretty, it's pretty fucking awesome.

Speaker 1:          00:33:52       He actually talks about some shit that I had no idea it happened to them and uh, maybe have even more empathy for that guy. You know, what I watched recently this week was, um, they actually, I never knew this. I was literally like two things devastated me. Like two major blows. One was more severe because it was a death of somebody. But in 1990 as far as the music fed was the first, obviously the top of the list was when Stevie Ray Vaughn died. I couldn't fucking blow was the first time, um, someone that I was into to that level, uh, died and just, it was just so fucking shocking. Like, I didn't even, uh, you know, it didn't register until after, you know, then family style came out with Jimmy Vaughan, so there was still new material and I just remember thinking like, wow, this is going to be no more Stevie Ray Vaughan and double trouble, new material. And he kind of had this, this theme where he would always, with a lot of his albums, he would start with an instrumental and end with an instrumental. So I'd always be excited when I bought his new album too. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:35:07       what did he do that or wouldn't eat? Maybe he did it in a few, getting older, starting to get a rude mood. I think it was the first song on the second side. Oh, I guess you would have one instrumental every album or to wait. He had stang swing and couldn't stay on the weather and scuttled button. He had rude mood on Texas flood. It's say what? Unsold his soul. He had Riviera paradise. Oh, y'all said Lenny, how can I forget that one? So anyways, I was always thinking like, oh man in his plane always would go to next level. I just remember thinking like, wow, this is never going to happen again. So there was that and then um, Steven ads or got kicked out a guns and roses.

Speaker 2:          00:35:47       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:35:47       I couldn't fucking believe it.

Speaker 1:          00:35:51       It was just, he was, he was the guy for me. Like I was all about all these other guys from the 80s that I saw, you know, and they all had the double bass drum set up and all that. And I just remember when I saw guns and roses live at the Ritz on MTV and I saw all the music that Steven Adler was getting out of that little four piece drum kit and it was so fucking cool to just go see somebody go back to having the one rack Tom with just the one ride symbol and this is how dumb I am when it really comes to spatial relations and shit. Like I'm really fucked in the head like I, so I don't have a good mechanical mind. Even like when they say if there's cooking directions, like, you know, turn it on the front burner.

Speaker 1:          00:36:33       When I look at the stove, the front burner is not the burner closest to me. It's the one furthest away to me. I always view the stove like I'm standing behind the car and that's, I don't know why that doesn't make any fucking sense, but I'm always looking at shit ass backwards. So at the time I had a five piece Slingerland late seventies all bond of size is 24 like 14 by 24 bass drum. I think I had a 1214 and a 16 two racks and a floor. And I had my ride a pie over the second rack, Tom and I was telling a guy at work, he's like, yeah man, I really don't play a fourth. This is how dumb I was. I really want to play a four piece, but you know, I got a five piece kit, man, maybe next kid I'll buy it would be a four piece.

Speaker 1:          00:37:15       And he goes, well, why don't you just take that other time off and then it becomes a four piece. And I was like, Oh yeah, do you know bad? I want that story not to be true. But it is true. So I took that fucking rack Tom off and it changed my world as far as drum and how much fun was it? I've never gone back. I absolutely love that setup because the way it makes you go around the kid is totally different because once people started having the two rack toms, it became start your fill on the snare, go up to the first rack Tom and then just blow down every fucking Tom you had. And every fill kind of started to sound the same. But when you had the fucking sorta the l shape thing going there one up and one to the one straight up, but one over to the right, it made you go around the kit differently. I mean nowadays I don't even think kids can relate to that shit because there's so much information on Youtube and kids compete with each other that the, the, the growth of the average drummers through the fucking roof, like in the last five years, how good people have gotten into playing the drums compared to five years when I was a kid, it's not even close. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:38:25       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:38:25       And now, you know, they had the bass drums in with the fills and all that. Did that just fucking there there are unbelievable, you know, but whatever. So that was my thing, know I started off playing with to ACDC records and then rolling stone source, Phil Rudd, Charlie Watts, really simple two for shit. And then I'm moving up to two appetite for destruction, which was all, you know, rock and roll type of shit. But you know, Bass Drum was more busier and uh, he had, he has a signature licks and that type of thing. But the degree of difficulty as far as just technically was harder for me and I used to play the hand, got stripped it down to the four piece. I ice to play that fucking album every day after work, man, I would, I would unload trucks all day in this warehouse, laugh my balls off.

Speaker 1:          00:39:11       One of the great jobs, I have a hat, you know, and then I would, uh, I would fucking go home, lift weights. This is my day lift weights. I go on a bike ride and then I fucking a, then I would sit down and play drums at. That was it. I would just fucking play from the first song all the way to the end of the album. And my older brother used to drive him fucking nuts because I sucked. But Steve, what was funny was Steven's drum parts was so unique to each song that in his head he knew all of the tracks. He knew what, what's if he came home in the middle of the album, he'd be like, ah, fuck. He's only on Mr. Brown stone. He's only on the f. He's only, he's only halfway through the first side of the, the fucking tape. You know, it was funny is I had the tape and a boombox. I didn't even have headphones. I should've just got headphones that I did and I could have heard it so much better. I would have that thing fucking cranked up. And I have my head turned to the side with this little shitty plastic fucking poor excuse for a boombox. And I used to play that thing, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:40:20       all the fucking time. And I remember just in, you had no idea, just had to figure shit out for yourself. There was no youtube. He just listened to it and I was convinced anytime any drama was playing on the snare drum, it was never just singles with accents. I always see was convinced it was some sort of rudiment he's got to be playing a rudiment. It sounds too cool. And um, well I guess a single stroke roll is a root of it, but you know what I mean? I thought it was some sort of special sticking. So I remember it's so easy in the beginning where he's got those fast 16th notes on the snare drum with the what? The crash accents. I thought he was playing paradiddles so I would be trying to crash and play paradiddles. It was, oh my God, it was a shit show until fucking somebody at this other warehouse, this burnout musician. He showed me that it was singles and a, I dunno, that was just a great, it was a great time of my life as far as like,

Speaker 3:          00:41:12       mmm,

Speaker 1:          00:41:13       I was fucking up bad.

Speaker 1:          00:41:16       But like it was going to be a while before the chickens weren't going to come home to roost because it was still in my early twenties I was fucking up in college, but nobody I knew had graduated college. So even though I was behind, you know, none of them had jobs yet. I hadn't started doing stand up. I was working out like a fucking is the best shape I was ever in. I lifted weights every fucking day and rode a bike like 11 miles every day. In other weekends I have one dad right at 18 miles and I was like 20 years old and I had like zero body fat. I was just like, yeah. And I would go out and booze like fucking four nights of the week, eat McDonald's at the end of the night. Just metabolism was, it was, it was the best. And I went to work and my job was unloading trucks. That's all it was. And then stock on the shelves and everybody I worked with was a fucking, either it was a warehouse, they were the class clowns, struggling musicians or some sort of just, I dunno, drug addict, free spirit. It was just the best fucking group of people I ever worked with. And um, anyways, I remember, um,

Speaker 2:          00:42:21       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:42:22       Somewhere. Yeah, he, I always heard they played farm aid. I remember hearing a story like it went nationwide I think as MTV was running. That's right. Was Axel said that someone in this band is fucking with Mr. Brown stone when they opened up for uh, the rolling stones and I was like, Oh wow, that's cool. They live in just like that song. I didn't know that that was a bad sign for the band. And then, um,

Speaker 1:          00:42:49       I dunno if they played far made or whatever and I just heard that, you know, I heard that he got fired and I couldn't fucking believe it. And I never thought the band was the same. Once he left and his, he left and then they got, they got all those other guys, they added a fucking keyboard thing. And it just, the whole thing, just like, yeah, you know what happens. So, um, anyways, this is a long drawn out story, but I didn't realize that, that uh, there's video of Steven Antholis last performance with guns and roses and a slash tells a story that Steven was high and they went out to go perform any, went to jump on the, the drum riser, but his depth perception was off because of whatever he was on. And he missed it by like eight feet. And he does, he comes out and he fucking just eats it, does a face plant. Then he gets behind the drums and evidently he didn't really know what songs they were going to be doing, got to know that was his fault or whatever. So they did civil war. Then you see the look on his face in the video, like what the fuck we do? I haven't, I've rehearsed this with a bear, but never with axel dude out to zip me. He fucking kills it.

Speaker 1:          00:44:08       I mean, they're all a little bit sloppy, but I thought he did fine. And then they pulled out some punk tune and duff had to count it off for, but even then, he still fucking did a great job and it made me Madec all over again that they fired a, but like I'm getting through his book and I think, uh, obviously they wouldn't have got rid of them if he wasn't completely fucking up. But, um, it's weird to read this book because know how it ends as far as this trip with guns and roses, but I'm still fucking rooting for the guy. Like that's how big a fan I am of his. So all right, there's your drum nerd part of the fucking podcast for this week. So anyways, so I'm reading that Shit and um, oh, here's what for, I wanted to read you this shit. All right, let me type this in here. People always say this shit like, dude, you're type A, type a right? Like this is some negative fucking thing.

Speaker 3:          00:45:02       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:45:04       Oh, you're tight B and all that. Here's, here's what you, next time somebody says that, because people usually what they do when they run out of points to make with you, they say, oh, you're type bay, you're tight bay. Right? Rather than being like, no, I made some good points and now you can't refute them, so now you're going to, you're going to fucking hide behind this fucking pop psychology horse shit. This is really interesting to me. A type A and type B personality theory. Yeah, the big word there theory, the those type A and type B personalities are just theories and it basically describes two contrasting personality types that could either raise or lower respectively one's chances of developing coronary heart disease. There was a considerable controversy about the role of these personality types in coronary heart disease and the role of the tobacco industry funding of early research in this area.

Speaker 1:          00:45:58       Early research turns out they funded this study for 40 years and basically the theory about the tobacco industry is what they were trying to do is cover up the fact that cigarettes smoking caused heart disease and they tried to blame it more on if you were this type bay guy who gets impatient with people that's goal driven, that loses his temper and all that. Like you, you had a bigger chain. Like that was more of a cause of the heart disease than smoking then that if you were actually like more chilled and relaxed, like a type B personality, you wouldn't get heart disease. So as far as my ignorant way of reading this, like these personalities are just like,

Speaker 3:          00:46:44       okay

Speaker 1:          00:46:45       cause I feel like everything that they bring up by him, like Taipei describes individuals as rigidly organized. I'm not, my office is a shit show and I don't write anything down and I never look at emails. Highly status conscious. Yeah. I mean I drive a Prius and I dress like Malcolm Young. I don't give a fuck a sensitive yes. Impatient. Yes. Take on more than they can handle it. I got like 20 Ha uh, hobbies, maybe one other people to get to the point who doesn't anxious that as much as I used to be proactive. Depends on what you're talking about and concerned with. Time management. Who wants to waste of fucking time? I'm all right. Tight.

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:47:31       By definition, generally live at lower stress levels. It typically work steadily enjoying achievement, but not becoming stressed when they do not achieve. I mean, I've kind of come to that point,

Speaker 1:          00:47:48       um, where I'm at, you know, I think they're just means being more happy with your life. You know what, I'm a comedian and I sell tickets. I mean, what the fuck else is there? Everything else after that is gravy. I felt like I made it like four years ago after like a somewhere between, um, why do I do this and let it go. Once I was selling the tickets at clubs, I could go out twice a month, live my dream it live a comfortable lifestyle, take care of my wife. What the fuck did I care? So I dunno. But anyways, it's good to know. There were actually a fucking theory. It's just a theory. You know something, you know, poof. We came up with this pussies

Speaker 1:          00:48:29       fucking jerk off. Stick up for yourself. Good. Come on up with this crap. Here's funding by the tobacco companies further discrediting the so called type a behavior pattern. A study from 2012 based on searching the legal tobacco documents library suggests the phenomenon of initial pro initially promising results followed by negative findings to be partially explained by the tobacco industry's involvement in the type a B personality research to undermine the scientific evidence on smoking and health industry is newest. The industry's interest in type AB person. I lasted at least for decades until the late 1990s involving substantial funding to key researchers encourage to prove smoking, to simply correlate with a personality type prone to coronary heart disease and cancer. So I dunno, I find that interesting. After the 50th time somebody said, I'm type a

Speaker 3:          00:49:28       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:49:28       let's just say it's not a theory. I think I have elements of type A and type B. I really think a type a type person wood, we'll throw it down in a bar, which I never did. I never did that. I haven't had a fight since like fucking junior high and I lost, I was playing stick hockey and I lost to this fucking guy that was, it was over and I was just like, yeah that sucked. You know, just cause you have a temper, it doesn't mean you type a does it. I don't think it does to me it type A's like a fucking guy's guy knows how to fix a car or break your jaw. To me that's type A, he's like a hero. I think very few people at type A and type is the whole, you know, either live in like the Zen. I think there's, there's two ways to live in both if they actually exist. Okay. It can be type A,

Speaker 1:          00:50:24       this is zenway maybe you'll live both. I don't know. Cause like there's the type B person that actually knows how to fight but re recognizes how stupid it is. It doesn't throw down unless they have to and then they throw down and they win. In the end they still think it's stupid. That person. Does that person exist or am I just thinking about a cool guy saw in a movie? Speaking of that, do you guys see the movie the drop? I saw a bunch of movies and my 70 plus hours of airline travel over the last, uh, month. Uh, the drop is a great fucking movie. James Gandel Finis last movie and there's another actor in there. Of course, I didn't get his name. I was on the plane. Um, I can't, I don't know. I don't, I gotta I gotta get his fucking name, his son. He'll fuck this up. I absolutely love that guys performance of that thing. Really cool movie. Come od the drop. 2014. What would be great if I actually looked this up in the meantime, as I'm waiting for this to come around, I saw horrible bosses too, which I thought was fucking hilarious. Did you see anybody else see that movie nanny body? Um, today? Chris was fucking hilarious. Is it Tom Hardy said, oh, it is

Speaker 1:          00:51:50       Jesus Christ. He looks so different. Every fucking picture. Yeah. That's the guy. Tom Hardy was the shit in the drop. He was so fucking good in that movie. Um, horrible bosses too. I fucking love that. Would Kevin Spacey's fucking Hilarious in it, Charlie Day so day because all three of those guys, just a payment, just funny ass fucking movie. It's laughing like an asshole on the plane. Everybody looking at me and I didn't care cause I had another 10 hours to go and I was drinking the fucking Johnny Walker black there. I saw a dumb and dumber two was disappointed. It was a couple of really good scenes, but I was disappointed. I didn't think that the script was there for those guys. And that's obviously a fucking classic. Uh,

Speaker 3:          00:52:37       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:52:38       What else did I see? I think I told you I saw a chef a while back when I was, oh, I was in New Zealand. I saw chef. What a fucking great, well, let me ask you this as, as John Leguizamo ever been bad.

Speaker 3:          00:52:50       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:52:50       That guy, he's been in bad movies, but he always makes the movie better as long as he's fucking in it. So,

Speaker 3:          00:52:58       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:52:59       it's a great script. He's great. If the movie stinks, he's still great. The guy's fucking money in the bank money. That's probably why he's been working for like 30 fucking years. It's unbelievable. Uh, it was that feting that I'm talking about. This shit on Oscar night. Everybody as you don't watch as many movies, I usually don't fly this much. I usually talk this much. I usually don't start sentences with I usually every fucking two seconds. Let me get back to what the fuck I was talking about here. Um, oh yeah. Hell is it? What was I gonna talk about those Bruins. Huh? Beaten the Black Hawks. Oh, by four goals. How do you like that? Chicago. What's up? Ah, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton St Louis. That said we lost two on this trip already. Brutal fucking losses. I got all of my tape. Uh, I don't have the nerve to watch the Calgary game.

Speaker 1:          00:53:51       I watched the, uh, the Saint Louis one. I was really jet lag last week, so every, every to Vancouver and Calgary. But I watched the Saint Louis one, we called up [inaudible]. It was probably the wrong team to do it. Some people said, well, who gives a fuck? He'll be fine. Um, but I can't imagine. Why don't we try and get rid of two kinds? I mean, you know, guys had a little bit of a rough patch all of a sudden. What? He's not good anymore. It's his fucking fault. We lost all these great defensemen. It's been all these injuries. We lost a fucking boy, chuck. I mean, come on, you're gonna blame him. It's stupid. That's like, well, you know what that's too, does shit like that New York does that. Boston does it too. It's so fucking dumb.

Speaker 3:          00:54:35       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:54:36       You know, every two fucking years, the goddamn giant fans trying to get rid of their coaching. Fucking Eli Manning. It's like, oh, you mean those Superbowl champions? Yeah, I'm sure it's their fault. Um, what else? I think that's it. I got into, I'll watch the end of the day. Total of 500. I've got to go to that one of these years. The OT is self someday. I never been to Nascar. I've been to two Indy 500 racist. But you owe it to yourself at some point to go to any sort of auto racing event. Because the funniest fucking thing about it is the difference in intellect between what's going on in the pit row and what's going on in the fucking stance. It's unbelievable. I mean, you're talking state of the art,

Speaker 3:          00:55:16       like

Speaker 1:          00:55:17       mega brains trying to figure out how to go half a second faster 10th of a second faster it like 200 miles an hour. See when by a fucking bumper.

Speaker 3:          00:55:26       Right.

Speaker 1:          00:55:28       And then literally you look across the street, which is the track and there's some guy fucking just crushing old Milwaukee, you know, would dip in his mouth. He's so fat is t shirt can't cover as navel. That's what I loved and I, you know, I would love to say at the Indy 500 you know, open wheel racing though is a little more snooty. It wasn't, you could bring a cooler end, you get, do whatever the fuck you wanted. It was a great time. And uh, I've been meaning to go to Talladega and Daytona. I got to scratch those off the bucket list at some point. I always forget, it's just NASCAR starts at such a weird time. It's a great time. It go right. No football. This is the time of year. I was getting into like college hoop. Like I didn't realize Kentucky was still undefeated. Saipem watching. I just hate the fucking pack. 10 I like watching Kansas, Kentucky and liked tobacco road man. I like fucking a Carolina Duke, NC state. I like watching that shit. It just sucks. The big east has gone now. Well he's back in the day, man, the 80s when I first started watching fucking who? The ACC and the fucking big east lake in a five year period I watched like James Worthy. Uh, Michael Jordan. Patrick Ewing. Ralph Sampson.

Speaker 3:          00:56:49       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:56:49       Elijah one. And what's his face? Clyde Drexler wear out and Houston. Chris Mullin was Saint John's. Pearl Washington is Syracuse and it was just fucking, every week there was some sort of fucking epic goddamn battle always would come down to the end. Those great coaches, I forget the coach for St John's always wearing the Cosby sweaters then. Yet. John Thompson, who was as big as fuck in you and almost always wondered like, how fucking long is his tie that it goes all the way down to almost as belt buckle when that fucking guy, he was like six foot 10. It's like when a fuck do you get your suits made?

Speaker 3:          00:57:28       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:57:31       just picture like the, like the haberdashery guy. Like they like Elvis, like standing on ladders trying to measure the guy.

Speaker 3:          00:57:37       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:57:39       Yeah. And you had, what's his face?

Speaker 3:          00:57:42       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:57:42       Uh, oh my God. Am I going to forget his name? Dean Smith. I told you, you guys all these fucking stories about, go to the dean. Don't see Michael Jordan play. I told you that as an NBA player right before the Charlotte, whole year before the Charlotte Hornets came, they tried to get NBA excitement going on down in North Carolina. So they scheduled a two NBA scrimmages during the summertime.

Speaker 3:          00:58:09       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:58:09       And before the NBA season, probably like in September, and I went to both games and each NBA team had a former tar heel on it. So it was the Chicago Bulls. Michael Jordan, no championships, still had hair, still was skinny then bulk up cause Detroit had beat him up enough. Right. I saw him play, uh, who was it? I think the Cleveland Cavaliers that had a Brad Doherty think his name was, he's that guy with the fucking hairline that went right down to his eyebrows. Who'd actually now he actually commentates for a

Speaker 3:          00:58:43       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:58:44       Stock car racing. And then I saw the Lakers with James Worthy magic. Karima. I think Kareem didn't show up though. He used to weld at that point. Like man ain't fucking coming down for that shit. He might have been retired. It was 87 [inaudible] 87. Um, yeah, he didn't play 87 88 30. I don't fucking know. And then they played the Cavaliers. They had Sam Parker's. That's right. Anyway, so let me, uh, let me fucking read some of the letters for the, Goddamn, we camped before 40 fucking go off the rails here. All right. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:59:17       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:59:18       Okay, here we go. Alpha brain build a half a man. Thrill ride. Uh, go fuck yourself. I know your buddy buddy. With Joe Rogan then. I'm not sure if he's already turned you onto onto this, but his company on it pronounced on it. Thank you. Oh, you know what? I think I already knew it was on and I wouldn't have known. I wouldn't have known how to say it. Anyways, PR produced a product called Alpha brain, which helps with cognitive brain function. He's been talking about it for years, but try to a couple of months ago and is great. It helped me focus on a novel. I'm writing on nights and weekends and nights and weekend away from my boring day job. Weekends away from my boring day job. It's why he should have written it. A, you always talk about I forget stuff and have trouble concentrating. You should give it a shot and report back to us. I'm sure he gives you some free samplers. Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. Ah, yeah. I don't fuck with drugs other than boots. I just don't, you know.

Speaker 1:          01:00:29       All right. Sorry. Um, do you that tried to do with solid thought she was downstairs? Um, yeah, I'll fuck around with miracle drugs. If I have a disease, I'll do that. Like, look, being scatterbrained is working out for me. It does. It just churns more comedy. I just fucked up and I embarrassed myself. You know, it's like, didn't you ever see that episode of taxi where they showed Reverend Jim before he fucking ate the pot brownies? It was just some boring guy with the sweater on. If I took Joe Rogan's pills and all of a sudden I started focusing more that what I would just, I don't think you'd like me now. I don't fuck with pills. I don't fuck with pills. I don't take, I don't take sleeping pills, you know, I don't fuck with them. I think they beat up your liver and he thinks it's a bunch of shit out there that they say is healthy in it doesn't have side effects.

Speaker 1:          01:01:26       And I feel like the food and Drug Administration has, you know, I've seen documentaries where people used to work for these drug companies are now they've infiltrated the food. Uh, the five, whatever the fuck it's called. I just said it, uh, who's a better candidate for this shit than me? The fruit, food and drug organization, food and health, whatever the fuck it is. I just said, and I just had it. It's unbelievable. The FDA, there you go. You've got the nuts running and not house, so they just push and shit through clear and it, you know, they're getting kickbacks on the side. I don't fucking trust any of it. All right. I think the way I was born is natural. You know, I don't think being scatterbrained is necessary. It's bad as far as the way things are set up right now, but

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       back in the day, if we were still living in the woods, I'd be fucking killing it. I'd have those squirrel like instincts, so I fucking be looking around, you know? But it just weirds people out in the office environment. I'm all write with it. I'm staying with that, with how I up. All right. I saw Joe the other night. I had one of my best sets of the fucking year up at the ice house band. I just had a great time. I saw Joe the other night and I got to tell you something that Matt had laser focus when he was talking to me. He didn't break eye contact. What's so maybe that shit works. I have no idea. I taken any drugs, man. I gotta do enough. I do enough fucking damage to myself. Last thing I need to do. Does that make any sense though? I play devil's advocate here. Oh my God, I can't fucking think. Oh, take this pill and then now you can think straight. All right, and that's it. That's it. Right? Those side effect. No, nothing. I just take this and magically I'm fixed.

Speaker 1:          01:03:22       I Dunno about that. They're, there always seems to be like this, like back in the day old school shit like penicillin, thank shit like that seem to work, but all this shit since then I feel like the, the drugs, like they just sort of peeked at some point, you know, and there was no more new drugs to kind of come up with Lsa. They fix something while fucking something else up like Rogaine. Right. You put that shit on your head, you grow a little bit of hair and then your kid has like three feet, you know, or whatever. Your heart starts racing and it was always something good to have your cake and eat it. This is what I want to let, it's a brand new drug. I'm going to let all you guys take it. All right? And if 10 years from now you still have laser focus. All right, can you levers are fine then maybe I'll think about doing it, but at that point I'll be uh, I'll be pushing 60. So what the fuck do I care when I'm pushing 60? That's what I would start thinking. Like, what am I going to feel like? I can try heroin only once. I'm going to do that.

Speaker 1:          01:04:24       Most smoke it

Speaker 1:          01:04:27       not fucking with you. I ain't get it. I shouldn't say that. This, you know, people who actually give me shit about that. I would never fucking try that. How many fucking people got it? That's bad this week to bring that shit up so I'm not going to, anyways, that's the trouble with Improv. All right. Girlfriends. Breath stinks. Dare. Billington the red. Uh, I been, I've been seeing my girlfriend for a little over a year now and if you could tell me your fucking breath is stuck the entire time. I've really not gonna have any sympathy for you and I don't know how you fucking bring it. And the only way you bring it up now is if you act like it just started. I've been seeing my girlfriend for a little over a year now. We're very much in love and have a great time when we're around each other. However, in the past couple of months I've noticed every so often or breath stinks. I'm not talking. She had ate something bad, but some deep seated stench that makes my eyebrow hair burned away. I noticed that her teeth have a certain yellow tint to them that is hard to look away from. It's like a film of American cheese. Oh Jesus. Sorry for the grocers. But that's just the truth. It's not like she doesn't take care of herself. She's very beautiful, responsible. Anyway, she has health insurance but not dental and hasn't been to a dentist in three years. Well take her,

Speaker 1:          01:05:41       take her. Okay. Cause she's starting to sound like a woman that lives in a tree in a fucking fable. Um, I think she might have some buildup of Tartar or gum disease. Yeah. Or something she needs a deep cleaning to start with and then they should have, if that doesn't work, I would check for some sort of sinus infection.

Speaker 3:          01:06:00       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:06:01       Yeah. If that doesn't work, uh,

Speaker 1:          01:06:06       you know, I dunno, consult a specialist rather than a comedian doing a podcast. MMM. We're going to move out together when I go to my new job, but I'm going to pay for dental insurance when I make the money because everyone should be able to see a dentist, especially as a girls asked him of her until that day comes, I want to say something but don't know how to say it. Obviously I just can't say, honey, your mouse smells like shit. We're very open with each other all the time, but I can't get the balls to tell her to say this. Any suggestion from you or the loving you would be appreciated. All right. Ah, fuck. I got to get Nia. Nia for this one. Yeah. Hang on. Hey Nia. Nia. Yeah. Can you help me on the podcast? I need you to help me answer a question cause I can only think of a way to say it in a mean way.

Speaker 3:          01:07:03       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:07:05       I just, I don't understand. Shut up or you're not capable of just pressing pause and come and get me instead of I have shit to with a crazy person. I have shit to do it. What do you want? I'm watching something. Alright, here we go. This guy's girlfriends breath stinks. Okay. Um, I'm gonna, I'm gonna go through it really quickly. Can you talk about how you ate garlic today? No, I did raw garlic because I had a sore throat, ate raw garlic, and then you wash it down with milk. How gross. Is that too fucking? Yeah, I know. What's to somehow fixes your sore throat. I Dunno. Is it working? No, and I feel like I fucking ate a lit cigarette. Um, anyways. I'm just gonna say it real quick. Was the only of what would microphone. So anyways, her breath didn't stick. And all of a sudden lately it's just stinking. She's, he's noticing a film across the teeth kind of yellowish. She hasn't, um, seen a dentist in like three years. How does he, how does he say, listen,

Speaker 3:          01:08:00       yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:08:01       I love you but your breath stinks. I want to pay for you to go to a dentist. I don't want you walking around the world.

Speaker 1:          01:08:08       You're going to get a nickname. Like that's how bad your breath smells. Does she not brush your teeth? No, she does. She hasn't been to a dentist who I said it takes care. She might have some target built up. The first thing you'd do is go brushes her teeth every day. And she still has all of this going on? No, we said there's a yellow film. Yeah, that means he's not brushing her teeth. Cause why would there be a yellow film on her? But she brushed her teeth in the morning and then before she went to bed, even if it's once a day, she needs to go see how does, how does he tell him? How does he get her to go to the dentist? Okay. Okay. You know, I would just say it to me how, no, how would you want me to say it to you if that's, if that was going on. Oooh. See I practice one. Let me practice one. We all know you're going to anyways, it doesn't, go ahead. Yes, go ahead. Hey Nia.

Speaker 1:          01:08:57       No, no. You don't have to get up. You can sit right over there. Stay over there. Um, do I love you, but it's sometimes I like looking at you from across the room. Listen, I'm only telling you this because I love you and I would want you to tell me this. It hasn't been, you know, the whole time I've been with you, but at some point in the last six weeks, like you've had like moments, especially like actually right now, like I don't know what's going on, but your breath really smells bad and I, I don't want to be near you and it kills me to tell you this, but your breath stinks. And I think you need to go see a dentist. I know you don't have dental insurance and I want to pay for it. Okay. Cause you're too beautiful to be walking around with that rotting smell in your mouth.

Speaker 1:          01:09:52       You still love me. I wouldn't be mad at that cause I haven't, I would start with it. We're using that to me. I would laugh at it and I would know that was coming from a good point. Would be mortified. Mortified though. I would be really, really embarrassed. But obviously, you know, if anyone's going to tell me it's going to be the person that has to kiss you and be around you all the time. So yeah. Well then fix it. Fix what I just said. How's Kaushik? How can you tell it where a lady wouldn't get pissed? I don't know. That's actually not too bad. I don't think. You know, it's just, that's so hard. I don't, hey ya. Shit mouth. Why don't you go see a fucking dentist before you kill the house plants. All right. Go eat your pizza. Yeah, I mean, I think that's it just to be really just brutally honest, but try to do it in a cute, funny way, you know?

Speaker 1:          01:10:40       And just be like, yeah. Oh God. That would be so hard. Yeah, you're beautiful. You're too beautiful video walking around because at least you're throwing in a compliment your body and faces a 10. Your mouth's a negative too. We got to get those numbers closer together. How are we going to do this? All right. Can you be fair? Can you give me a glass of water by fucking, I ran out of water. My throat is killing me. I sound like this woman's breath. Um, all right. Good luck with that, sir. All right, let's wrap this up. Um,

Speaker 1:          01:11:15       bodyweight exercises, spelt, B, O, d, y, boody weight exercises, Willie Bond Bond. Uh, I heard of the podcast last week. You like body weight, exercise me to fucking love him. Last year I found a great app with a shit load of great bodyweight routines. It's called, is this the one app that you invented? This might be free advertising. I don't care. It's for working out a bodyweight training. You are your own gym. I think it's about three to $3 and it's fan fucking tastic. It was developed by a navy seal fitness trainer and it has four different 10 week programs for different fitness levels. All the workouts are short and will kick your ass in a good way, plus a bunch of other goodies. I can't recommend it highly enough and I am not in any way feel affiliated with the APP. It's just a great workout at a great price.

Speaker 1:          01:12:02       No equipment needed by recommend picking up a pull up bar. You stick in your doorframe for 20, $30 at target or somewhere. I started using it back in September and in a much better shape because it, because of it. Fucking awesome dude. Uh, while I'm at it, I also recommend a regular full body stretching routine. I've been doing that for months as well and I'm as limber as a whole. It's clamp. That's something he wrote near. Oh, what was clam there and for the ladies, um, as bendable as a drunk and louses WIC whiskey Dick, they a kid see that he was trying to, it's trying to do one for the women. Yeah, like a negative noodle deck. You know, when there's no blood in a deck, he can bend it. Let me, let me ask you, if he's talking about how great and how in shape he is, why would he ever compare himself to a limp Dick Women's sucking the common, I have everything for over a hundred years. All right. Take this. What is it? It's a fucking Ricola. Oh, Rico law. All right. By the way, it'll recent study I read about and health showed that to best, the two best things you can do before bed to get a good night's sleep is stretch and visualize.

Speaker 3:          01:13:19       Correct.

Speaker 1:          01:13:20       Um, what do you jerk it off after you fucking touch utopia? I'm sorry. It's so fucking childish and I love it. So I often stretch and then do a guided visual mental meditation from Youtube before bed.

Speaker 3:          01:13:37       What

Speaker 1:          01:13:39       does that mean? You're watching a video, do you think? I took it to a weird place there. I didn't, these guided meditations are Corny, but they're great. Super relaxing. Hope this is his info is useful to you and my fellow m m p see brothers and sisters be well, um, you know something

Speaker 1:          01:14:03       right. I think that makes a lot of sense. I might try that. Oh, you don't wanna use it. Do you know when I was doing the helicopter lessons, which I'm going back to my final and much before I test for my license here, um, I was having problems with auto rotations and I just sat there visualizing doing them but not close my eyes. I was just like my minute at the end of the bed pretending I was in there and the next day I did them, I was much better. So maybe there's something to that. I have no idea. He said a be well miniature version of animal to your bill. Okay. Miniature version of animal. Here we go. I think this is the last one here. Um, if you could have a smaller version of a normally large animal, what would it be? Ideally it would be trained and you'd have it as a pet signed weird roommate. Well, it couldn't kill me. Um, I love animals too much to have a, make a wild animal, a pet. So, oh they, I have, I'd have a miniature version of my talk, Cleo. So even when it flipped out, when I dressed up like a drummer, I wouldn't have to worry about it killing me. That's a lame answer. I'd have a miniature gorilla.

Speaker 1:          01:15:23       That's what I would have made sure gorilla. Right then I do pull ups as it climbed a tree looking at me like, why can't you go all the way up? But I'd be like, because I'm human, miniature gorilla. The fuck's wrong with you. Then we'd smoke some weed. Man, that's a weed fucking question man. If you could, if you could have any animal miniature, what would you have? I'd have an alligator man and I'd have a clip. My toenails, dude. Alright. Old Billy red face. First off, go fuck yourself second. I'm having some issues with my roommate. I'm in college and share a campus apartment with one roommate. My question is how do you motivate someone to be more considerate? Uh, you can't, I grew up in a house with brothers and sisters, so I try to respect other people and those who I live with, for the most part, my roommate on the other hand, doesn't do dishes. It doesn't take out the garbage and doesn't even change the toilet paper where we're out of it. I've asked him to do it, do the above, mentioned nicely, and he gave up on it pretty quickly. He doesn't even say what's up and make eye contact when he walks in the door. I'm not trying to be a Douche, but at what, at what time do you think I should take a shit on his bed now or later? Thanks. Um, I don't think you need any help. I think you're mentally moving in the right direction.

Speaker 1:          01:16:39       You know, there's gotta be, um, you don't have communal dishes, right? Dental start using yours. Uh, you know, you're going to have to drop this guy at some point.

Speaker 3:          01:16:53       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:16:54       This is what you do next time. He doesn't flush the toilet. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:17:00       I would just stick his pillow in the toilet. I mean, I think that, what else are you going to do? What does pillow back on the fucking bed? Um, I had a roommate like that. I had a roommate like that and we almost came to blows. And I'm thrilled when you live in with an animal you live in with an animal and it's just like, you're just going to have to tough it out for the rest of the semester. We get somebody different and, um, is the deal, just know that some, he's, that's the type of guy that's probably going to get divorced or he's going to marry an unbelievably understanding woman. Um, I fucking hate guys like that. I never, that whole fucking, you know, you know that stereotype of how on a guy's apartment it looks like they just slice a pizza between the cushions fucking and I never was like that. What a fuck what you want to live like that?

Speaker 1:          01:18:00       Never did that. I mean, when I was living in New York, right? Um, I had this roommate and um, you know, from day one if I did, you know, fight dirty some dishes and he had a few in there. I did mine and I did his, you know, if I took out the trash couple times in a row, I didn't give a fuck. And you know what, he immediately was the same way I showed him respect, he showed me respect, we got to look fucking great. Alright, I've fucking move out. Other dude moves in and all of a sudden all the harmony goes away. He starts telling me what a fucking asshole the other guy is. And I read, it took me awhile to realize this. Like, no dude, you are the fucking asshole and you pissed. This guy was a respectful guy. If he showed him respect, he took out the trash to without asking. He actually hooked me up. Took me a minute to figure out the math on that one. So you just got a bad roommate and when you live with that animal, you got to treat them like a, you know, you've got a wholesome doubt. I Dunno what you do.

Speaker 1:          01:19:07       Just break one of his glasses in front of them. Just say, let's just start throwing out his dishes. Go look, I'm not going to wash up, so I'm just going to put your dishes in the trash.

Speaker 3:          01:19:19       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:19:19       Okay. Which is ridiculous. And it will be like, why I go, because I'm like, you fucking bitch. Do your dishes, your fucking animal. I would literally take it. I mean, I don't know. I don't know if you can take this guy, but like, I dunno, that's make us making me go back to an angry place in my life. So I'm not going to give you any more advice. Talk to that. Don't bring it to violence. Don't stick his pillow and the toilet. They'll do that. It's a short time when your fucking life, you'll get a better roommate. But, uh, just, you learn a lot of lessons with this cut. And, uh, when you go to meet a woman, uh, you know, check out her fucking apartments. Yes, she lives all right. And don't do a one and done either. So, yeah, she has over time. She's a fucking does nothing worse than a messy woman. They have way more shit than any guy could ever have. Just imagine all your fucking male roommates. Shit. Just multiply the amount of sneakers. He has times 20 fucking pairs of shoes, all that makeup and crap fucking animals. I used to clean bathrooms and um,

Speaker 1:          01:20:15       when I worked in this restaurant,

Speaker 2:          01:20:17       okay,

Speaker 1:          01:20:17       and you'd think the guys bathroom would have been dirty or at the fucking a woman's bathroom? I swear to God. It looked like there was a ticker tape parade and then somebody shit all over it.

Speaker 2:          01:20:27       I was a fucking right

Speaker 1:          01:20:29       water all over the place. It was like, what the fuck are they doing in here?

Speaker 1:          01:20:35       Because they have to sit down to pee. They would just build a nest. I don't know what it was.
