Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Barr and his time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday, January 3rd, 2017 what's going on out? Yeah. How's it going? Oh, Jesus. What to talk about first? Uh, no, I am not a father. That's not why this is fucking late. All right. Now I just lost all my female female listeners. I was at the rose bowl yesterday. That's why I did not record. Okay. I watched a bunch of college football this weekend.

Speaker 2:          00:00:28       Wow, man.

Speaker 1:          00:00:32       Right. I watched a bunch of, a bunch of college football. Got into this huge debate with Jason Law had before the Ohio state game going, dude, I still don't get how the fuck you guys are in the playoff. And Penn state isn't, you know, you guys lost to Penn State, head to head and Penn State one year conference championship. That would be like if, if the Yankees won the American league east and the Red Sox won the wildcard and then the red sox got to compete in the playoffs to possibly win a world series and then the Yankees didn't, that makes no fucking sense whatsoever. And he starts going, well, I'll tell you what I know we had our, we had three, the most impressive road winds of any tea but bubble just all of this shit. And I just kept going, you bleed scarlet and gray. If this was happening to your team, you would say it was bullshit.

Speaker 1:          00:01:19       And he said, no I wouldn't. I be asking why a Washington, The Washington huskies were in it like he would have no problem with a team that his team beat. And when the fucking camera give me a fucking break. Right. And then what happens? What happens? Ohio state goes out and plays Clemson and they go out and proceed to get their asses by a bunch of Goddamn nerds, nerds, 31 to nothing. Clemson just fucking completely dominated them. And in the end Bly had sends me this fucking text, he said, I can see blah blah blah blah blah. And then I just sent him a picture of Joe Paternal shrugging and said, I didn't see nothing.

Speaker 1:          00:02:08       Maybe that's what part of it is. Maybe that's why they still don't want Penn state to be in there, you know? Cause at the end of the fucking day, the end of the day, this guy kind of fucking, you know, it was a lot of shit going on in the shower there. And the guy, he fucking didn't say nothing. It was so weird about being at the game cause I was rooting for Penn state yesterday at the amazing, amazing fucking game by both teams. The quarterbacks he bolts set like tide or set, I'm zillion fucking records is the highest scoring rose bowl in history. Uh, at one point both quarterbacks had four touchdown passes, which I don't think I think that tied a record or not. I can't remember. And then won the, uh, the red headed kid there through his fifth, I think it was ran and I was fucking sitting way up there. Um, he threw his fifth touchdown. So, uh, final score was, what was it, 52 to nine. The over under was 53 and a half. So, um, Penn State score 28 points in the third quarter. It was just a fucking amazing game. And two things bug me when I watched when I was there though. Of course, it's always something that bugs me. Okay. Number one.

Speaker 3:          00:03:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:18       The fucking, uh, at one point they were showing all, like the coaches were one of the Roosevelt, whatever. And Joe Paternal goes up there and this is, he gets a bigger operation than anybody else. Bigger ovation than anybody else. How important are sports?

Speaker 1:          00:03:36       How important is fucking winning of fucking Game Day? These Penn state people? Evidently that's more important than if you look the other way is some poor kid in a fucking shy. I'm, it's just fucking, it's, it's unspeakable. All right. I just fucking, I'm stepping away from that fucking program. I've always liked him. You know, I was still kind of rooting for him. I was like, wow, you know, these kids here in the field, they didn't fucking do it. These other people are, uh, they are innocent of Alban and then they show, you know, they show the fewer up on the fucking there. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:04:12       Just like, all right, fuck these people. Right. But then USC and their fence, you know, USC fans of the classic, you know, all day Yolo Douche is, you know what I mean? It's, there's just so fucking hard to root for it despite the fact, you know, um, oh, Jay Marcus, Allen, Oj pre murders. Like if they put Oj up on the screen, you know, I wouldn't have fucking show. I probably would've just to be a cunt. All right. I'm a Penn state fan again. I don't want to f I don't know. What, what are you doing at situation anyways? Um,

Speaker 1:          00:04:51       so Penn state a USC, USC, it looks at looking like they're going to win the game. Okay. And then Penn state comes roaring back in the third quarter, which by the way, took like an hour in like 10 minutes. It was the longest quarter of my life. The TV timeouts, we're fucking ridiculous in that game. Actually said to my buddy, I was just like, dude, you know what? This is the most boring, exciting game I've ever been to in my life. It was like every, it was like if you watch watching Goodfellas and every fucking three seconds, somebody just hit pause on it for two minutes. That felt like 10 minutes fucking referee standing around. They fucking reviewed everything. Everything. But the fucking coin toss they reviewed, they take game was like four hour, well over four hours long. So anyways, Penn state comes roaring back. Fucking USC fans, few of them left, most of them stayed. And anyways, long story short, they end up coming, you know that they were down by like a, I can't even, it was like 27 14 the next thing it was 35 27

Speaker 1:          00:05:50       then I think it was (353) 053-0520 seven Penn state than 35 35 then two whatever, 35 then 49 35 and that's right. Then Penn state, I mean USC came back and score two touchdowns. Right. And when they tied the fucking USCW USC players, just the way they act, their program is the fucking worst. They're the, they like that type of a program. I can't stand like, do you remember the first game of the year when they played Alabama and when they were coming out of the tunnel, there's a bunch of them acting like they were these crazy dogs at the end, the leashes and they were lunging forward. Somebody pulling it back. Oh you guys all, you wait to see what the fuck's going to happen here. And then they go out there and proceed to get their asses by a bunch of God damn rednecks. Red fucking Alabama kicked to shit.

Speaker 1:          00:06:44       It was like 52 to go fuck yourself, whatever the final scores. And then after all that fucking shit, then they just kind of hit good game, good game. They just scurry off the fucking field. Right. And then yesterday you see when they win, right? They like, first of all, when they, they, they tied the game up, you know. And I would say on some ticky tack, fucking a pass interference calls. But like USC was getting fucking screwed earlier. They had a couple bullshit. It was just sorta we fucked you guys twice and then uh, we'll, we'll, we'll fuck the other guys twice. Okay, well balanced it out here somehow. Um, couple of pass interference thing. So when they scored the touchdown to tie it up with like a fucking minute left or something, dude, all the scoring that Penn state did, I mean they jumped up and down.

Speaker 1:          00:07:30       That was it. Two fucking USC, the guy, they scored one in zone. This guy with no helmet on, runs down the sideline to the entire other end zone. Like Ah, doing that 300 Yelp, like he fucking scored. Even then I would have been like, dude, relax. It's a fucking tie game all jumping up and down, all up on the benches with their fucking Jersey, spinning them around over their fucking heads and it's a Thai fucking game. And then in the end, right, by the way, Penn state totally played fucking Marty Schottenheimer ball. Marty Ball. I swear to God. Like every time they had a first down towards the end, they just written the first play was running right up the middle. Right? Nia centers fucking ass for no, no yards. We're burning out though. Where were you know were taking time off the clock? They would do when that shit, I said I'm actually star.

Speaker 1:          00:08:19       I'm convinced that the prevent defense, by the way, is actually a, it's a scam that was come up with by the heads of the leagues that is executed by the coaches to make sure every fuck as many games as humanly possible can come down to the wire so people will continue to watch that fucking thing. Once again, did not work. I can't even begin to tell you. They just, you just going to give them the first fucking 80 yards. Then you're going to play defense and hope that you hold them to a field goal. That's a philosophy and the we'll just, we'll take away the sidelights. I'll give him the middle of the, everybody knows how it fucking works in. All it does is ensure that on the final fucking three, four plays, the other team now has a chance to win. You've been playing defense, you've been shutting them down.

Speaker 1:          00:09:05       You've been throwing the fucking ball. You've been kicking their ass and then all of a sudden hand up off the middle every fucking time. I Dunno. Drove me up the fucking wall. So then you, when USC finally wins it right after letting up 49 fucking points and then they score 52 the second day when at the entire team runs down the field, not towards the field goal kicker to celebrate, who by the way was doing that stupid dap thing, the entire fucking thing. Trying to get like a sneaker deals, like what kind of kicker gets a sneaker deal? They got like half a deal if they just get it for their kicking foot. Then the other thing they give him like a fucking Sandal, so they don't even go out and celebrate with the fucking kid who kicked the field goal. They just run right down at Penn state's band and the whole fan section and just screamed all in their faces.

Speaker 1:          00:09:57       And what's fucking hilarious is that game obviously could have gone either way and if they didn't win, they would have been like, well hey, good game [inaudible] Penn state wouldn't done. That was just a completely classless fucking move. But that's how they are, you know, that's, it's one of those schools were saying, well, the coach just doesn't take any responsibility. And he's just like, well, uh, the, uh, cancer, this is very emotional team and they like to express themselves and have that, yeah. Yeah. When they, when, when they, when, when they don't, they fucking scamper off the field.

Speaker 1:          00:10:27       It's like that Richard Sherman guy, whenever the Seattle world's you mad, you mad, Bro, you met. Right. And then all of a sudden he loses, he tries to be mister tries to be the mirror. Hey, good game Tom Brady. Good game. And it varies like that showed class. No, it did. Anybody can be classy when you fucking lose, you can't talk shit. You lost the class. Act is when you win and you're not a cunt about it. Um, but anyways, having said that, it was a fucking amazing, amazing game. Great comeback by a USC. And uh, is as much as it came down to the wire and there was all those points scored. I have to be honest with you, I, if I could have fast forwarded through the last 45 minutes of the fuck, that's how long the fucking game was and how long these fucking TV timeouts where I can't imagine how much fucking money they made.

Speaker 1:          00:11:15       Game started at one 15. It wasn't over until like, I want to say like five 45, five 40. It was just way too far. It was over four hours long. It was like a fucking baseball game. It's like this is, this is what happened in the national pastime. Bill. You know what was one must as long as you bitching about the fucking game. Um, anyways, so we went to the tailgate. I brought that, uh, that flat top grill that I got the campfire one. Um, this is not a paid advertisement dude. Fucking thing was unbelievable. It was unfucking believable. Lie head was at, I didn't want to go to the game. He was having so much fun. He cooked so much shit. I make, we had so much fucking food. We had too much food. And, um, that's why I felt like I got hit by a truck was I ate so fucking much.

Speaker 1:          00:12:04       And um, I made these hash browns. He made this crazy egg sandwich. Then we had chicken wings, then we had fucking steak and cheese and we still have burgers and dogs that we're going to try to do at the end of the game. But I was just too fucking full. But a law head was fucking hilarious man. He was so excited to cook. Right. I'm back in the truck and he's outside of it and this guy comes walking by and you know, when they, they sell those ticket holders, I always get one right? And he goes, hey, take it all you took it. I go, yeah, yeah, yeah. Let me get four. So these guys sort of walking up to the truck and I'm not doing a good job back in it in cause the grills blocking my view. I'm trying to look around. I don't want to fuck this thing up.

Speaker 1:          00:12:40       And, uh, so I had to do get to make a couple of temps and rather than blaming it on me, chase starts yelling at the ticket guy cause hey buddy, hey, think he could get out of way, let the kid fun party. And then I didn't hear the guy going, hey bro, you gotta, you gotta relax and, and Jay just starts fucking John Adam. Like he's fucking arguing when a call and I just yelled out, I automatic, I said, Jamie, just shut the fuck up. I got to it. I'm sorry. Sorry about that guy. You know, he's, he's a little wound up, right? So we have fucking buy the ticket holder things. The guy leaves and then Jay setting up his fucking, his little a canopy thing and t's just fucking, he's just locked in, you know, Jay's a fucking athletes so he just fucking gets his, he's got that focus right.

Speaker 1:          00:13:24       And as he sat in the thing up, like these four people we've barely even establish our space are just passing through. And then Jay immediately it's like, Hey, I want you to walk from the whole area. It just walk along like freaking the fuck out. I said to him later, I said, Jesus Christ, Jay, I go, you fucking dropped the gloves before the game even started. What the fuck is with you when he's like, not a lot of guys, the guys walking, right, and he types, what are you tired people come through the whole fucking kid. And I just started laughing. I was like, Jay, you're excited to cook. Say the cookie. You got a little excited. Then he finally just fine. Just relax and goes, all right. I got excited.

Speaker 1:          00:14:02       Um, I don't know. We don't know where we are. Just, we had a great fucking time and, um, I dunno, I still nodded off a little bit in the first quarter. You know, I can't get to sleep after all these years of doing, stand up till like fucking a 12 midnight and get up, you know, four hours later, I'm an old. Um, I really felt my age, the sheer man, uh, speaking of which there was someone at the Tailgate, I'm not gonna say who, who was fucking slumped over the truck because they had to go the bathroom and couldn't. So we're like, dude, we got to take you to the hospital. We got to take you to, Nah, I'm fine. I'm fine. And five fugly ends up coming back like 20 minutes, slide it through. And it felt great because I eat, I think he passed a fucking kidney stone or subs. I don't know what the fuck it was.

Speaker 1:          00:14:48       I don't know what to tell you. Oh yeah. So we almost had a fatality lie. It almost got a game misconduct. Oh, that was a bullshit one on USC. That fucking, uh, targeting with that was setting that, that wasn't, I don't know. Guy Jumps in the air, he's aiming for his chest and somebody else hits him. Then all of a sudden the guy gets knocked down. Where is his chest? His head is now we're just chest wasn't, and the guy was already in the air. Right. Does anybody give a fuck? I, I'll, I will plow, I will plow ahead here. Um, I also watched the UFC, I know this is like an old story at this point, but, um, you know, everybody, like everybody else, I watched the uh, Amanda Nunez and the Ronda Rousey Rowdy Ronda Rousey fight Ed A. Yeah, that was tough to watch. That was definitely tough to watch. And um, it was even tougher to watch all the fucking shit talk and assholes on like Twitter and all the means.

Speaker 4:          00:15:46       [inaudible] you know, I've taken naps slogan the note, they went to get a drink and then it was fucking okay

Speaker 1:          00:15:52       over. And it's just like, like all of these people that have, have fought and competed and won in the octagon and they have the right to talk shit like that. It's just a, I don't know why people do stuff like that. Uh, you know, if that happens to every champion, if they, if they stay, if they stick around eventually somebody younger is going to see you're the champ. Everybody's breaking down what the fuck it is you do over and over and over and over again. And then eventually you get run down. It happens to everybody if it can happen to Muhammad Ali, sugar ray, Leonard, Marvin, Hagler, all these fucking guys, they last fight. I saw 'em loose Roy Jones, Jr Matthews, George Saint Pierre, right? I think George Saint Pierre might've won his last one, but he was all beat up and everything. But um, and said he didn't remember part of the fight. So that's what happens to everybody. So of course I texted it to my buddy, he goes, well, not rocky or fucking Mayweather, meaning rocky Marciano. And it's just like, dude, all right, I'll rocky Marciano. Absolutely. But like Mayweather, I dunno, maybe owes me like 300 bucks in paper view.

Speaker 1:          00:17:00       Think about that guy. All right, I'm really going out on a limb here cause I don't watch that much boxing. I think one, obviously one of the greatest fighters of all fucking time, but like he's just also understood that final third of his career, I feel better than anybody else. How do you still continue fighting and not take that big fucking knocked down? Part of it, our blog apart was his amazing defense. But the other is to fucking opponents that he picked. You know what I mean? That fucking Pacquiao fight should have happened at least eight years before I was on his side where I was like, yeah, he, maybe he's on drugs. He probably, I don't know, maybe he is, maybe fucking isn't. But, um, I dunno. All the boxing isn't the way it was. Um, somewhere in the 80s at died like a,

Speaker 1:          00:17:51       that Hagler Hearns Duran Leonard, they all lost and they all fucking lost to each other and shit. It's just like, he had unbelievable fighters for unbelievable fighters and they all fought each other. It's impossible to stay undefeated, but, um, you know, when you fuck it, you know, it'd be like, I've just fucking, Ali fought, Joe finally fought Joe Frazier in like 1981. I'm like, what? Ali's last fights. I think it was against Larry Holmes who then was the fucking champ for like the next four years or whatever his rule until I think Tyson came along and maybe there was one guy in between. I can't remember. It's been so long ago. Hagglers last loss was to sugar ray Leonard. I mean these guys fought champions right up until the end of their career as opposed to a, you know, fighting some guy from England with weight issues. You know that one Ricky, Ricky, Ricky Hatton. I saw that fight. I don't like talking shit about fighters either because you know, they cannot beat the fuck out of me. I'm, I'm just saying that, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:18:52       I think it's going to hurt me whether the level of guy that he fought the final third of his career. Um, cause I know for one like just, I just, you know, you'd watch his fucking fights. The other guy couldn't hit him. Mayweather could knock them out and he just kind of a poop poop poop poop. The whole fucking fight with is those white kitten gloves. I'm just like, this is fucking boring as shit. Um, fighting not to lose playing, not playing, not to lose like Penn state, like Penn state didn't the fourth fucking quarter. Um, so that's, I know, that's my own dumb opinion. I don't know what they don't know shit about fighting, but all I know this is you're a fucking asshole if you go on Twitter and you start trashing somebody cause they uh, cause they got knocked out like they're a pussy or you, you are overrated or any of that type of shit.

Speaker 1:          00:19:42       I mean, some of you probably say, I just did that to Mayweather. I'm not, I'm saying he's one of the greatest of all time. I would never say that the guy's a pussy or anything like that. I would have just liked to watch him fight a better caliber fighter. Um, I dunno. You know what I mean? I'd like to add that may whether patio fight that should have fucking happened at one oh five oh six something like that. Bill. Shut the fuck up. All right, I'll shut the fuck up anyways. Um, you know what it really is, is the adverse, he fucking said that may, whether it would have fucking beat Hagler Hearns Leonard Duran, like he would have fucking beat all of them. It's like he would've beat all of them. All of them couldn't beat all of each other, you know, I don't know what he's, I don't know what he's basing it on him. You know what he's basing it on? He's basing it on being born in the late seventies. I just, you know, I'm just an old fucking crabby men, I'm speaking of, which, you know, I've, I've been working on my anger. Um, I got in the car today to return the pickup truck and I, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:20:46       I fucking, uh, I don't know. I made it down the street and around the block before it got into an argument with his fucking woman who just glided through her stop sign in her white Mercedes Benz. I got to fucking, I got to anybody who's got a white Mercedes, a white, uh, people, white cars, high end white cars are fucking entitled cuts. I don't like, you know what I mean? They think the car is a classy right. I was confers he shit like versus he loves, you know, it just, it gets the class is fucking thing ever. Mercedes and BMW, they've really fallen the fuck off. You know what I mean? They just went right down to the bottom feeders. Anybody with like Sukin afford 60 bucks a month can lease one of those cars now telling you when he used to see a Mercedes drive down the street, he used to be some fucking guy like in his 50s, who was wealthy or have a BMW.

Speaker 1:          00:21:46       Even then that was like more like the Yuppie guy. Like I'm not having to fucking kids and I'll pour shit in the drinking water just to make another buck, you know, Cook the fucking stock market and banker psycho, right? We were just having rough sex, you know, that fucking lunatic. Um, now it's shit. It's like, it's like fucking 21 year old kids. Um, I think this podcast should just be like a, some sort of theme of like, things aren't the way they used to be and I'm fucking upset about it. Um, you know what it is, is I, I didn't have a good breakfast today and at my age, that's not a good thing. You know, I woke up in the, and we didn't have any fucking real food. The fucking, my, my frying pan was underneath all the dirty shift from the fucking Rosebowl that's in the sink.

Speaker 1:          00:22:33       It's like, I'm not going to fry up a fucking egg. And a Nia has one of those fucking little kid cereals in there. And I was just like, all right, I'll fucking eat this shit. And, uh, um, I already had the fucking sugar high and now I'm starting to crash saw and being, uh, being a little harsh than the millennials, you know, in Floyd Mayweather and, uh, people who drive white cars. I can admit that in 2017, I can admit that this is the new me, the new bill. I meditate now and by saying I meditate means I tried it once last week and I plan on doing it twice a day, but I've only done it once so far, but uh, but I've been thinking about doing it, you know, and uh, people have been sending me shit about trying to get over my fucking anger issues and uh, yeah, that lady like gliding through the stop sign and I, I stopped, I said, you gotta Stop Sign, right?

Speaker 1:          00:23:25       Then she goes, you got one over there. And I go, that's not it. It's the other ones. It's just like, you're just a fucking nother Douche in a white Mercedes. I sweated. Got, do you think if they stopped making that car, people would drive better? If there's something about people when they get in a white Mercedes, a white fucking car, like you know, of, of, of that costs a certain amount of money. That's it. Look, I'm, I'm getting upset again. Just relax, Bill. Take a fucking breadth, you know, go outside. Look at the birds. We have a hell. It is, you're supposed to do it. You know, somebody sent me this, I, I should play it. No, somebody sent me this fucking video on, uh, you know how to get over my anger and the risk of sounding like a hack comedian. It actually, it didn't make me angry.

Speaker 1:          00:24:07       It fucking upset. Maybe though. It really did. Let me see this here. See if I can click on this fucking thing again. Oh, how not to be angry all the time. I wonder if I can play this and not get in fucking trouble by some, uh, some podcasting entity here. See if I can turn this fucking thing up here. So I look at this thing, right? It's a cartoon. So immediately it's on my intellect level right? Here it is. This, this is what they're trying to say to me. I'll try to play this year, my minimal fucking, um, abilities here. Oh, for God's sakes. So you gonna play it here or what? I hit play.

Speaker 5:          00:24:49       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:24:50       I refuse to get fucking angry during this. Why won't this thing play? Oh, I know. Because I'm in this room. I'm in this room. So the fucking in the internet doesn't work or there's a little spin wheel. It's gradually fight spinning around. What's going to happen? All I want to do is play this fucking all. I want to do room a zoom, zoom, zoom. I just want to play this fucking video. How does it know? How does the universe know when you're trying to fucking do something? All right. You know what? Fuck it. I'm not playing to, hey look at that. I'm not angry anymore because I just gave him cause that's basically what this fucking video told you to do. It was talking about so and so. This is, this is the name of the video. It says how not to be angry all the time and I would love to read the fucking comments on this thing, right?

Speaker 1:          00:25:35       He says how not to be angry all the time and it shows this guy, it's like a William or whatever. I think you guys actually name was bill. I can't remember. You know, he likes to read the newspaper and he tells his wife not to interrupt him while he's doing that. And then it goes, his wife finds this very upsetting. So one time he's reading the newspaper and uh, she says, Hey, when are you going to a, you know, set the table, the Blahblahblahblahblah and William flips out. He gets angry and it says William gets angry because he has hope. It was talking about how angry people, as much as they come off as a negative, they're actually really positive people. And it was basically saying that they have hope. So they present all these different scenarios and they're like, at each one of these cell, you know, he goes to the airport in his plane is delayed. He's one of the premiere fucking flyers. He gets mad, he goes up, he flips, he screams at the fucking lady behind the counter because he is hopeful. And it was basically saying that he needed to be a little more pessimistic. Oh, here's the video, here's a video. It's basically saying you needed to be a negative cont. Here we go. Like Boomi times.

Speaker 6:          00:26:44       We certainly don't usually think of them as well,

Speaker 1:          00:26:47       why is it so fucking quiet?

Speaker 6:          00:26:50       They treat me.

Speaker 1:          00:26:53       You know what? I can't deal with this fucking guy's accent. I can't deal with it. Oh, I know I had no, I had the fucking microphone turned round. There we go. Can you be paypal? The actually, aw,

Speaker 5:          00:27:07       hold on one second.

Speaker 6:          00:27:10       Sound like Fumi Times. We certainly don't usually think of optimists yet. They truly march to them.

Speaker 1:          00:27:21       I can't fuck it. Oh my God, I can't fucking listen to it. Can He, why is he going to fucking over it? And that's everything. And that's the get everything. Give me paypal actually ported the people on the left. Yeah. So basically he goes through all of this fucking Shit, right? And he says in it, to be more positive is what you have to do is you have to accept the world that the world is actually a very dark, gloomy place. And most things fail. And most basically, most dreams don't come true. And, uh, you know, be more of like a realist. And like people who, you know, people get upset. People who aren't angry, people get upset,

Speaker 1:          00:28:05       um, when something happens, but they get over it way quicker and they don't get nearly as mad. And it's basically because I guess they're walking around going like, oh yeah, why wouldn't this person in this white Mercedes blow through the stop sign? Of course they do. I guess this part of me that I understand that, like I flip out about the moron drivers out here and I literally say to myself out loud after I flip out in the car going like, yes, Bill, you have established that people out here suck at driving. When are you going to stop reacting to it? And um, you know, I, I, I, I don't think ever, I don't think it's because unlike an optimist I don't have, I'm not hopeful that someone fucking, you know, if they're going to make a left, that they, that they'll get all the way over to the left instead of sitting in the middle of the lane and now I have to fucking wait. Where if you just were over by the double yellow line, I could have gone around you. You fucking cunt. I'm not like hopeful that they're going to do that.

Speaker 1:          00:29:16       I don't have hope that they're going to do it. I just can't understand why you wouldn't because I know that person has been sitting behind somebody doing that. It's like when you're, you're in a long line at fucking whatever and it's moving slow and everybody's Yammer with the person on the other side of the fucking desk. It's like, just get up there and say what you want and shut the fuck up. How hard is that? And there'll be a person in front of you look at you rolling eyes. Like I can't believe how long this takes. And then they get up there and what do they do? They just fucking launch into all of this shit that has nothing to do with what you're doing and it just fucking ads timed. So I'm not, I don't have any hope that people are going to, maybe I do. I have hope, you know? I guess I would hope you'd be a fucking not a moron and figure out why this seems to be taking way longer than it should.

Speaker 1:          00:30:15       I Dunno. I don't think it's because I have hope. I think the reason why I get fucking angry is because that is my default emotion. I think that that's what it is. You know, I came from one of those families are like, shut the fuck up. You sit there and take it. Right. One of those things, which, you know, if you're not allowed to express yourself, you immediately feel like you're not going to get what you want in life. And I think that that's what I think, that's why I flip up. You know, I flip out because of that. Like, you know, if something starts to go away, I don't want it to go, um, no one's going to listen to me and I don't have any fucking options other than just sit there and fucking take it. So I think that's what he's, I don't think it's, cause I'm hopeful. I get maybe a little bit, baby. I'm such an angry cunt. I can't say that there's some truth in this video, but I don't think the solution is, is to just walk around, um,

Speaker 1:          00:31:08       you know, just accepting that people are the way that they are, you know, that'd be like, if you know, you're coaching a team, it'd be like, yeah, you know, we're eight and eight, eight and eight next year, you know, I will probably be eight and eight again because, uh, I've, I've accepted that this is the way things are. Um, I know a lot of positive driven people and they're not angry people. So I don't think being positive as part of that. I think it's, I think it's just how my fucking wires, my mental wires had been soldered together. I think I probably came into the world.

Speaker 3:          00:31:47       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:31:47       I Dunno. Can you come into the world angry?

Speaker 3:          00:31:51       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:31:51       I Dunno. I don't think he can. I don't think you're born that fucking way. I have no fucking idea, but I dunno about this video where I got to now just, I just, the solution is just to be like, yeah, well you know, people out here when they make lives, that's how they're going to do it.

Speaker 1:          00:32:07       I mean, I guess if you just do that, then you don't get angry because all these years in me getting angry has not made people stop doing that. It never made the person in front of me go like, Oh, I'm sorry, let me get over. They just sorta look at me weird as I, as I drive by yelling at them, looking at me like, what the fuck is he yelling at me? Am I doing something I have no, I have a white car. How could I possibly be in the wrong? Um, I dunno. I have no idea. I think a,

Speaker 1:          00:32:43       I dunno, I dunno what my deal is, but I plan on getting to the bottom but at least understand it. But I don't think a three minute fucking youtube video with some guy with his fucking, you know, I think in the United States we like getting like people with English accents to fucking narrates shit. Cause then it just sounds like it's true for smart, you know what I mean? Which is why I think all these, uh, these English guys have been Scottish guys have done well. Um, maybe it's just women like fucking that accent or just like a different foreign accent. I don't know, like these talk show people, you know, for some reason that slot that used to be after David Letterman, you have to get an English or Scottish guy, like that's become like that time slot, like an American accent. That guy can not do well in that.

Speaker 1:          00:33:27       That is the Great Britain accent. Time-Slot um, I dunno, I I, but I, I all I know is, I can't, I can't listen to fucking, I can't listen to this again. Friend Fred furious. He's been married to his, he's often furious. He sounds like he's in the fucking clockwork orange. Uh, but I am off often furious. His name was Fred. I knew it was one of my names. Right. Um, all right. What am I doing here? Let's, let's, let's read some fucking advertising here. 34 fucking minutes into this podcast. And I don't think I'm a, I don't think I'm even remotely a better person. What about you guys? Um, all right. Oh, it's our friends here. No, wait, let's, let's, let's stay on this point here. Maybe. Maybe that's what I should do. I'm going to try that today. I'm going to just try walking around and what am I do is have my eyebrows up a little bit.

Speaker 1:          00:34:23       I'm going to do that thing that, uh, people do. You know, where they make their lips disappear? Their mouth looks like it's closed, but their lips disappearing on the car. Just going to do that. Walk around like, Oh yeah, of course. This thing that should take 90 seconds. Of course. Now it's going to take six minutes. Yep. Okay. Take my car over to the dealership to get the, uh, the brake light done. I mean, I know that I could change out a break lake, but of course you've, uh, have the screws. They are, they're inside the car behind a plastic thing and I know when I go to take that thing off that they are the head on, the screw is going to be something I've never seen before and requests and requires a special screwdriver. Then I could go down or maybe order on Amazon, do you know? And of course they won't just sell me the one. I'll have to buy the whole set and then I'll be like, well I guess I can pay fucking $35 for a new set of screwdrivers and hope I don't get a ticket over the next few fucking days. Or I could just drive down to this fucking dealership and just pay 180 bucks for a fucking like, boy, get married, get mad again.

Speaker 1:          00:35:32       I'm just going to go down to the dealership and just say, yes, I have something that I could totally repair on my car. If you guys hadn't put those aliens screws in there, excuse me, could I have the screwdriver that I need to undo those four screws? Could I, could I have that please? And could I then find the corporate guy right as he's getting on his jet who came up with this idea and could I please just, I don't know, just sort of stick it into the side of his neck. I think that would be nice. How does that work? If I say angry shit, but I say it in a pleasant way, ma'am. Is there a reason why you're so not focused as you work this cash register? Is there a reason why you feel that you were above a job that you stink at? How does that work? Shouldn't you be so good at this job that I'm actually sitting there thinking to myself, why are you working here? You're way beyond this. Why are you standing here reinforcing that you're not even good enough to do this job because you think you're better than another job?

Speaker 1:          00:36:42       Is there any way you could open that cash register door and I could grab you by your ponytail, shove your head into the drawer and then see how far I could close it with your head in it. Is there a way I could do that? Sorry guys, you just know I have to rehearse everything that I'm going to go through today.

Speaker 3:          00:37:00       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37:00       Oh, hello. Staples. No, you cannot. You cannot have my phone number. I mean, I'll give you a phone number and I will give you an alternate phone number. Yes, I will. None of these will be true.

Speaker 3:          00:37:12       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37:12       Oh, I'll, I'll give you a, I'll give you a, uh, you know my fake email addresses that I give. It's, you know it at AOL, aol.com. You got to have a fake one. You know it@aol.com.

Speaker 3:          00:37:30       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37:30       That's my fake. What? And that is a reference to will Ferrell in old school. Frank the tank when they go on frank a tank, right? He's gone. You know it, you know, um, the fake phone number I give out is a series of area codes followed by the number of five.

Speaker 1:          00:37:50       That'd be like, what's your, what's your phone number? It's like, Eh, three, two, three, two, one, two, eight, one eight, five. That's what I do. But they start to look at, you have to two area codes, you know when you go like three, one oh two, one, two. They get that. You get that little puppy look, the gold cock of the head. And then rather than saying eight, one eight, cause they're gonna know I go eight, one, eight, five. So I still get it in there. A fake name I go with all the time. Russell. Russell, whenever I just need a first name. What's your name? Hey, what's your name? Russell. Russell. What can I do for you today? Well, you can, yeah, you can start by not asking me personal questions. All right. That's what you can do. And you can get some loafers. Are that fit you fucking feet. How about that? All right. Did tight shoes. Um, I'm sorry.

Speaker 1:          00:38:43       I don't want to tell you. Oh by the way, I, uh, you know, I got some video, my old buddy cleo and um, she seems happy as hell. And this is unprecedented. This person that I gave my dog too is a dog trainer and um, at like the fucking dog whisperer or level. So, which is what my dog needed. And he sent me video of something I've never seen before. My dog came in and wanted to play with another dog, which my dog never did. My dog tried to kill other dogs. My dog tried to kill another dog when my dog was with the trainer that now has it and he's slowly been working with this fucking thing. And um, what was amazing and the trainer said, you know, within a week to 10 days they will probably be just like best of friends sleeping together in the sun.

Speaker 1:          00:39:38       So that made me feel good cause I think she's actually happier. Um, and that environment then she was with me even though, you know, I miss her to death or what, but that made me feel good. So there you go. There you go. I'll tell you that fucking dog has had an amazing life, an amazing life. Like a literally, it should have been over like three different times and it always survives and its life has gotten progressively better. So, uh, they made me feel good as much as I, uh, as much as I missed the thing. That's cool. It's got a Fred and I got nobody. Ooh. All right. Oh, here we go. Let's read a little advertising it.

Sorry. Read the anger one goodwill. Hey Bill. Bill up the podcast. Can't wait for F. F is for family season too. Thank you very much. Last week on the Thursday podcast, you talked about goodwill. I worked goodwill for a little over a year and you wouldn't believe the shit that was donated there. Oh my God. This fascinates the hell out of me. I imagine they give you basically everything short of a body. Um, you are totally right. They just throw all this shit and trucks, but they, but instead of throwing shit in the oceans, yeah, wait a second.

Speaker 1:          00:49:07       But they, instead of throwing shit in the oceans, put the trucks and warehouses and let them set for at least three to 10 years so the shit can get a lovely scent of mold over them. When they get loaded. They literally throw this shit on the truck. Nine Times out of 10 breaking whatever you are donating. Yeah. No Way. You know what the Shit, you know what the shit thing is about donating to goodwill. You can bring shit with mold, Piss, shit or anything else disgusting there and they have to take it. Well then what are they supposed to do with it? I'd put it on a truck to nine times out of 10 they will take anything but that one time out of 10 if you bitch and threatened to call corporate and complain, they will take no matter they'll take it no matter what.

Speaker 1:          00:49:53       Okay. Oh God. Someone's got to do a documentary on goodwill. When I was there, people would donate trashed. They didn't want to pay to get rid of couches, torn to shit with piss stains all over it. Mattresses with literal shit on them and a laundry lists of low of long gross shit. Dude, this is like an expo as a, and I'm taking this all is fact. I have no idea if this is true or not. They will literally sell anything. I got to the point that when people would donate things that were really nice, I would tell them they should keep it or give it to someone because it would just be thrown away. But of course the mouth breathing assholes that would donate trash that they, that they have to what, but of course the mouth breeding assholes that would donate trash that they have to take.

Speaker 1:          00:50:41       Dude, you're a bit of a mouth breather here. You're, you're, you're not speaking in full sentences. Uh, these people are hoarders that you can't even open their car door without shit falling all over the fucking place. Fucking discussing. The grossest thing that I ever saw gets sold was either a mattress was shit and piss stains on it or an anti dildo that had white hair all over it. Ah, come on. Come on. Come on people. I can't believe this. This, this. I'm, am I getting trolled here? Is this a millennial? Is he giving me the business? He says, I know this is going to sound like I am making myself in this situation. What I know this is going to sound like I am making myself in this situation. The good guy, this is a voice text, but I seriously would look at them and be like, why the fuck are we selling this?

Speaker 1:          00:51:33       This is really wrong. They will respond with, we have to sell everything to try and make bonus. The sad thing was we never made bonus. I got to the point where I wouldn't price shit because it was garbage. And my last day I felt like grabbing a trash bag from the office, go around the building, picking up trash than tying it, tie it up, slap a dollar on it and write on the bag mystery bag or some shit like that and see if anybody would buy it. But I didn't do, this is all, that was all one sentence on my last day. I felt like grabbing a trash bag from the office, go around the building, picking up trash, then tie it up, slap a dollar on it and write on the bag mystery bag or some shit like that and see if someone would buy it.

Speaker 1:          00:52:16       But I didn't all one sentence. Thanks bill for the labs and good luck to you and Neil with the new baby. Um, yeah, I kind of, I kind of get, but people just use goodwill because they want to feel like they're being environmentally conscious. You know, I'm not throwing this out. It's going to end up in a landfill or in the ocean and then you just bring it down there and they just throw it up. Yeah. Well it didn't take a genius. She come down there, there's a giant fucking 18 wheeler empty just park there now. Like it's dropping off or picking up shit. It's shit. It's there on its, on its legs. There's no a tractor trailer there and you know, they just come over there like once a day and just drive that thing away. Where, where's it going? All right. Drama Queen Dad. Dear Billy, red nose.

Speaker 1:          00:53:01       First off, I'd like to say thanks Megan, but thank you. Thank you. I'm a lady. Oh my God. I have a female friend in high school and lately I've been listening to your podcast whenever I'm stressed out or just looking for something to laugh at. Okay. Now onto the story. My father is a middle aged man with bipolar disorder and likes to blame everything on his mental illness as he calls it. I liked it. You're already taking them to task here. He's going to blame everything on his mental illness. Yeah. There's no reason to not do your dishes. All right. All right. They'll loopy. Um, he's very dramatic and claims that his bipolar is the reason he hasn't been able to hold a job lately, even though he kept the same career for about 10 years and is now working for a new company by parents are divorced.

Speaker 1:          00:53:44       So whenever my father can't have us over to visit, he claims it's because of his illness. Ah, man. That's the greatest. That there's nothing like a fucking builtin excuse. That's gonna be great when I have a kid here in a few fucking days, minutes, weeks, whatever, uh, uh, you know, I'd love to, but my kid, my kid's a, yeah, I can, I got a kid. Um, I don't want to tell them him that bipolar disorder is not a mental illness because he, he'd go ape shit on me. Um, is bipolar? I don't know. I thought it, anytime your brain was fucked up, he had a mental illness. I haven't met the limitless with my anger. Okay. Bipolar, bipolar, is it a disease? Well, let's see here. Oh, just give me the fucking answer. Oh, Geez. Is uh, fuck you. I'm not reading all this shit.

Speaker 3:          00:54:46       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:54:46       This is the Internet. I don't want to expound. Expounded on, just give me the yes or no. Is there a yes or no.com? Can you just do that? You just answer a fiasco. Fucking, it's like, I don't want to know why.

Speaker 3:          00:54:59       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:54:59       Is this blah blah blah, yes or no? And then you have your answer. So then when you go to the bar and somebody says something like, no, it is. Yes it is. Yes it is. Did you know that bipolar disorder develops with during a person's late teens or early adult years? Do you know? I didn't ask that question. Never trust a fucking doctor with a goatee. Where the fuck is it? You know? Oh my God. Jesus Christ.

Speaker 1:          00:55:27       Look at these fucking eggheads. Y'All got nice full heads of hair though. I've got to give him that. All right. Anyways, um, I don't want to tell him bipolar disorder is not a mental illness because he'll go ape shit on me for some reason. He seems to enjoy making me and my sister feels like shit. It makes mountains out of molehills whenever we correct him or stand up for ourselves when he bullies us. Yeah. I don't take any shit for you sound like an asshole. What's even worse about this is that his bullying always works. He's very manipulative and I'm scared to see him because of the things he said and done to me in the past. Every time I'm, I'm informed I'll have to spend the weekend with him. Um, I nearly piss myself with anxiety. My question to you is, how the fuck do you deal with someone like this? I know my dad is ridiculous and uses underhanded tactics, tactics to make me feel like shit, but for some reason I'm not able to just get over it. None of my friends seem to relate to being so terrified of one person. Like I am of my father. I would like to hear your take on things. Thanks for reading this and go fuck yourself. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:56:30       all right. How would I get past? Well, this is the hardest thing to do. You have to stop giving a shit about the guy to a certain level at some point. You know, when you, if you have a parent like this, you have to look at them and remove mentally that they're a relative and you have to just say to yourself like, if this person was a complete stranger, would I be friends with this person? Would I interact with this person? What I waste another minute, my fucking life dealing with this person? You know? And when you got to ask those questions, usually it's like, absolutely not. This would have been a fucking one and done situation. But the thing is, is is your dad, she can't write them off, but you have to kind of, that's the toughest thing when you got to write off a parent but still interact with them. You just gotta be like, I don't know. You kind of have to find the humor in it. I think that's a tough one, especially at your age.

Speaker 5:          00:57:27       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:57:31       I Dunno. I would just, I dunno, I would probably could do some passive aggressive shit where I would just say, oh yeah, is that how it is? Okay, I'll get right on that. You know, Shit like that. I don't know what to tell you. I would just basically, um,

Speaker 5:          00:57:44       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:57:45       I would still like, what is he going to do other than get mad? He does. It doesn't sound like he hits you anything. So he just mad any flips out or whatever and just I stop who gives a fuck? That's what he's going to do. The guy's out of his fucking mind. Right? Maybe he's got bipolar, maybe it doesn't. Maybe it's a disease. Maybe it isn't all, you know, they just,

Speaker 5:          00:58:06       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:58:07       oh man, this is Tom. This is fun. This is a fucking rough one because it should dad. And the last thing you want to do is then go out in the world and start dating somebody who then treats you like ditch that, the exact fucking thing you don't want. And then you end up with that and then you have that same nervousness in a fucking relationship. That's all I can say. You know, you got to do, you're not going to be able to fix this guy. You got to deal with them because he is your dad. Um, but the big thing that you could do is in your life is you create a life that does not involve this. All right? You need to go out and go marry a fucking story,

Speaker 5:          00:58:44       right?

Speaker 1:          00:58:47       And then your fucking house is great and it's peaceful and it's what you want. And then every once in a while this fucking tornado tornado blows through and you deal with it and then it leaves and then you go back to your peaceful life. Um, that's all you can do. You really, as a kid, you really can't do anything about your parents. You can't pick them. You just get the ones that you get. But, uh, the thing that you could do is create a life that does not involve that. And then you don't do that shit to your kids. And then you break the cycle, then that's it. You know? But the weird fucking thing is, is that your, your decks still always going to be in your life, you know, so that lunatic will then be around your kids and it's just, it's a, it's a motherfucker. It really is. But fortunately they, for the most part, die before we do. And then, you know, you don't have to deal with them anymore. So I guess try to find the fucking humor in it while you're dealing with it and then think of how exciting your life is going to be. Um, by not having that in it, you know, you might want to just Skype with them for awhile.

Speaker 1:          00:59:50       Get yourself in a situation would be like, why? I think the screen froze hello. And he just click. Uh, but that's really a, that's disappointing to hear that an adult would manipulate a teenager. Forget about his own fucking daughter. That's sucks. So I don't try that, but just know that you can go out in the world and have any life that you want to have, uh, simply by, you know, you know, he's showing you what you don't want. All right. There you go. Oh man, that's brutal. You fuck you fuck up so bad as a parent that your daughter goes outgoing. I want to marry a man who's the exact opposite of my own dad. Oof. That's game set. Match. You fucked up as a father. All right. Sister's girlfriend, dear bill, the red bitch birth. Uh, my twin sister is a lesbian and she's dating a lady who was bisexual.

Speaker 5:          01:00:43       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:00:44       She was bisexual. And then what,

Speaker 1:          01:00:48       then what became totally homosexual and went back to heterosexuality or it's just she asexual. At first we didn't, we weren't close or anything, but we did get along with your twin sister, not the bisexual woman. Right. Then about a year ago, we ran into each other at a club in the end. Oh, I know you're talking about the bisexually. My sister is a lesbian and she was dating a lady who was bisexual first. We weren't close or anything, but, but we got along. I mean, I'm assuming you're talking about the bisexual lady. Then about a year ago we ran into each other and a downtown club. Uh, we, we had a few draw. Jesus, we have a few drinks. Just start talking about random stuff. Uh, she came back, she's going to try to fucking, she can try to finger bang the whole family here until a friend of mine invited us to a party.

Speaker 1:          01:01:31       At some guy's house. We went and had a lot more to drink. And then one thing led to one. Now that w what it, what it does, anything good ever come out it. And then, you know, one thing led to another. That's when you're fast forwarding through such a piece of shit thing you did or something you're embarrassed of, hey, you know, one thing led to another. No one ever talks about fucking a hey, how did you hit that when they're winning game shot? Well the inbounded the ball and uh, one thing led to another and uh, you know, I hit the, I hit the shot the way the, and chip, you will tell every fucking detail I was running down the court with every step. I can feel my IP. I knew somebody had to step up, let to do this. I'm always going to be me.

Speaker 1:          01:02:11       Right. That's how you tell it when you fucking, when you did some good ship, he did some bad shit. Yeah. One thing led to another and the guy was on the ground and he wasn't breathing. So I dunno what happened. Okay. One thing led to another. We ended up having sex. The next day we came, we came to and both fell the horrible about what happened. You both came to, I just pictured that fucking, you know, take my picture. Smack my bitch up. Remember that Madonna was in the background going on. She was saying like the fucking opening to star Trek. The next day we came to in both felt horribly about what happened. She then told my sister that she slept with a man, but didn't tell her it was me. Oh, wait, you're a guy. I thought this was a lady.

Speaker 5:          01:03:07       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:03:08       Oh, okay. Okay. I'm bisexual. I Dunno. All right. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. All right. Your twin sister is a lesbian. She's dating the lady's bisexual, Yada. Ya. At first we weren't close or anything, but we got along okay. And then you ran into her and you fucked. You fucked your fucking sisters

Speaker 1:          01:03:31       girlfriend. No wonder you went with one thing led to another. Then we came to like, you were both drugged. Oh, these are classic. You feel horrible about this, sir. Or you don't. And, uh, but you want to get away with it so you're blowing through the details. What is very, this is very underwritten for what the fuck is just gone down here. Jesus Christ. Uh, she then told my sister that she slept with a man but didn't tell her it was me. Dude, this chick is a psycho, uh, for the past year I've been torn up about it. I need your unbiased style of advice. Should I tell my sister that was me or not? Thanks. Ps, come to blah, blah, blah. I would love to see you again. Um, dude, no, don't say a few. Die with that. Secret, that secret and hope that woman fades away and then if it should ever comes back around, she said it was you and just be like, it was the fire. One time he had got with Drake's. Oh, what they let you went down there? I wouldn't say a fucking word.

Speaker 1:          01:04:43       Don't say a fucking word. Okay. The fly in the ointment here, it's just bisexual lady. Okay. She's jumping all over the fence. She's fucking sister. She's fucking brothers and she's fucking white people. No Kid. She's fucking two people that she's, she's the flying the fucking ointment. Okay. She said the shit. Um, I don't know why she's doing that. This is like this and she's like Glenn Close, um, in, in, in fatal attraction. If she fucked both Michael Douglas in the Hottie who was married to and the rabbit. Okay. She just fucked this lady. Just, you know, you just sit tight. Okay. This is like in a sub and you cut the engines and you're just hoping that they're not going to start dropping depth charges and you just hope you get through it sometimes in life. You just shut the fuck up. I, this was one, I wouldn't say anything. Okay. And if she brings it up, yeah, you slept with her. I would just, I mean, what are you going to do? This is the thing, you just, this lady's out of her fucking mind. There's no way your sister's going to end up with her. Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:05:45       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:05:45       There's no way she's going to end up with her. All right. This one was out of her fucking mind, so she's eventually going to fade away. Uh Oh. You have to do is just hope that when it comes time for the breakup, that the crazy bitch is breaking up with your sister because your sister goes to break up with her in that highly emotional moment. She might drop the ball. Okay. And then you would just, you just gotta play it. Like she said, what now had never have cheese, just you've just breaking up dead. She said that's why she was saying it because you broke her and that she walks in the room and be like, oh, I right. I did it

Speaker 5:          01:06:22       because one thing led to another.

Speaker 1:          01:06:27       All right, Carl, my pants down a Billy blue lungs. I Dunno what that means. I'm 24 years old and I'm dating a woman that was 34 years old. Uh, alright. See fucking and all the lady you're not dating. Come on. What are you gonna do? Wow. What were you going to have your first kid with her when she's like 96 we've been dating for close to three years now and I couldn't be happier. We recently bought a house. Oh Geez. You, you're 24, you're dating a 34 year old and you bought a house with her recently bought a house. I would be nervous if this was flipped in. The guy was 34 and it was a 24 year old. He's still a wild horse man. You've got to run out on the range. Um, we recently bought a house and it finally came time to put down the down payment on the house and all that extra stuff.

Speaker 1:          01:07:11       I'm going to be honest and ego issues on the down payment. She knows my financial status and she was cool with it, but I just wanted to provide more because she does so much for me. So I dropped my car insurance without her knowing to give her the extra money, even though she said I didn't need to. I felt like, what sort of man would I be if I didn't contribute my part? So my luck has it. I got into a car accident literally two weeks after I dropped my car insurance. I'm between a rock and a hard place. Now we want to start a family, but I'm guessing my license would be suspended for a year. A lot of burden will be put upon her now that I'm, I'm assuming my license will be suspended for some time. Bill, any, if you could do me a solid on this one, that would be great. Ps, longtime listener, first time email. Oh Jesus. What do you, what are you asking me? Like, yeah, you're fucked. You are fucked. I agree with that. Um, well I, um, in life sometimes you learn a hard lesson, sir, and you'll learn in right now. I'm sorry. I don't know what to tell you. You with this woman, I mean, the solution, you, what you learned is the solution is not doing what you did. You don't expose yourself to that type of a liability.

Speaker 1:          01:08:34       He didn't really ask me a question.

Speaker 3:          01:08:38       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:08:38       Uh, all right. So you love this person. You want to start a family, that's all good and you fucked up. Uh, I would, I guess if you haven't told her, I would come clean. Tell her what you did, why you did it. Say you're sorry. And, uh,

Speaker 1:          01:08:54       and I don't know what your, what's your fear? 24. And you want to be able to provide, she's 34 and you're going to get married. You're going to start a family. I don't know. How would you be able to provide, you've got to get your career going? I would think so. That would be my biggest concern once I find out what the judgment against me is going to be. But, uh, here's the deal, dude. She's 34. You're 24. She should be making more money than you should have more money than you. Her life should be further down there. You know, uh, you can't try to catch up to a 34 year old. All right. Cause the only way for you to do it is to do what you just did. And you end up fucking yourself over and in the long run, you fuck her over too.

Speaker 1:          01:09:31       So, um, you have to respect the fact that you're the age you're at, you're at. And, uh, I would try to figure out what the fuck I wanted to do with my life and I'm gonna try and get that career going. And I would hope that there would be a bus close by that I can take to get me to that because you're, I think you're going to get fucked here. Sorry to say that. But um, yeah, my advice would be stop trying to measure up to a 34 year old, just be 24. All right. I hope that helped you out. Um, but that's all I got. Sorry. Okay. All right.
