Speaker 1:          00:00:43       happy Thanksgiving to you. What's going on? Happy Thanksgiving to the United States of America's citizens. Each and every one of you. I am thankful to be in America, sitting here with McGovern, eating the fucking doughnut, getting fat and Ham. Fun The my wife miles off to me. Go and slap her in the face. Get Marcel some pie and then make fun of another race. Hey, all right, what's going on? This is it while you were around the world and you want to know what the fuck at Thanksgiving is all about. This is what it's about. It's about sitting down and overreading celebrating the fact that on this day, thanksgiving, 17, 76, the United States of America kicked the shit out of the fucking bread. It's British people at the battle of thanksgiving. You know, this black dude Crispus addicts, attic, Eric's Attica, whatever his fucking name was, he came walking out and he said, he said, Yo, motherfuckers, what's, what's your pattern when pitch.

Speaker 1:          00:01:57       Right? And then the English will like, you can't talk to me like dad, especially with dead skin complexion. Then they tried to shoot nobody fucking Stab King Henry the, uh, the eighth. Yeah, right in the throat with the, uh, with the Turkey bone, broke his larynx. The guy survived. We took it out on his wife, you know, beat her to death with a chastity belt. This is all true and you can look it up, but at the end of the day, the end of the day, that small act was what created this country. And, um, I'm thankful for Crispus addicts where his name was, go back to my history classes. You know, was that the only black guy they talked about? I think it was, they sort of touched on slavery. Um, all these white guys did this amazing stuff. Slavery and then they built the White House. Um, anyways, I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about and who cares that

Speaker 1:          00:03:02       Oh, here we go. We're back. Went Back. Yeah. I don't give a shit. This is one of these podcasts. I don't care. I don't care from entertaining you. I don't care if I'm confusing you. I don't care if I'm ruining your fucking meal because I am in a resentful moved. A lot of people are thankful today. I am not thankful and I'll tell you why. Cause I'm working right now. I'm doing a podcast so you can hear my daughter screaming in the background. She's already half in the bag. Everybody's boozing and having a great time and old Billy. No Fun. No Fun is continuing with his streak. Why is he continued with his streak? Is it cause he's vain? I don't know why I'm continuing. I just don't want to be a fat booze bag again. Can I do, I'm just going to ride out the rest of the year. I'll see what I'll see, what the vibe is for 2018. You know that first day when I roll out of bed I'll see how I feel.

Speaker 1:          00:03:57       Granted I'll be at the rose bowl so I'll be very excited. Um, which this year is going to be a, I was one of those semifinal plas. I think the Miami hurricanes are going to be there. Um, somebody was saying that I have no idea. All I know is I'm going, I'm going right that, that that's what I did. I bought some tickets for myself and my friends for the rose bowl cause I was giving thanks to living in this wonderful country that has the stadiums you can go to, right. It used to be able to get drunk and have a good time. Can't do that anymore. Ah, you can't do that anymore. Somebody was jerking off vigorously with the fucking shrimp cocktail and now ne everybody shut it down. It's going to be no fun anymore. No Fun in the comedy clubs, Dude. Fucking the vibe and comedy clubs to pending on what you talk about. If you talk about absolutely nothing, I'm sure nothing has changed, but if you even remotely touch on fucking anything, there's so many subjects now and these fucking millennials, they swear to God, they just, they just sit there. It's like doing a cruise ship Gig.

Speaker 1:          00:05:11       Can you imagine? Sorry, didn't mean to scream, but can you imagine the fucking midlife crisis that millennials are going to have? They're not having any fun. This sitting around staring at the goddamn screens, they're afraid to say anything. Everything's been judged and labeled. It's like this, this fucking bizarre like way back in the day, oh hey, back in the day they, they used to say that the government, right, they're going to come down on you, man, you're going to take away free speech, man, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Wasn't social media. Social media has made everything so fucking important. Your quote, everybody's on eggshells. It's really different the amount of times I have to sit there as almost a 50 year old man and tell young people to snap out of it.

Speaker 1:          00:06:04       And then they always applaud like, Yay, we want to snap on him. And what I'm calling this right now, I don't know what's going to come out of this at the very least is going to be a great wrestling character. You know, if I were, if I actually could take the beating, the punishment of professional wrestling, you know, and I was a younger fellow, my character's name would be the millennial, right. And I would be fucking sanctimonious my, the word I learned this year, self-righteous, which is basically the same thing, set in a different way, isn't it? And I would act like how much I cared, and then I would go into the ring and be a selfish fucking prick who just cheated and fucked over everybody all the way to my victory. Something like that. That's, that's the loose, or maybe maybe it's not too late for me to be a wrestling manager.

Speaker 1:          00:06:56       I'm too old to be a millennial. I'll be proud of my millennial children. I don't fucking know. This is why I don't rest. Well, I don't write for the fucking WWF or whatever they're called now, the WWE. Um, Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ. So how was your guys' Wednesday, just before thanksgiving. How was it? Did you go to the local bar and did you see that lady? Did you see that fella? Maybe you wanted to bang one of your teachers? Did you hook up? Did it happen? I is a creepy teacher. That's what I would do. You know what I mean? To keep my job. I wouldn't try to bang one of my students, but I would hit every fucking Wednesday before Thanksgiving at the local watering hole, you know, by then when the fucking, whoever the hell I wanted to bang was of age and I'd show up, you know what I mean? Just fucking chalk dust on my pants.

Speaker 1:          00:07:55       Do a little dance. Mega Little Love Bug your teacher. Um, hey ladies, have you ever gone the Wednesday before thanksgiving? Did you just check in on one of your teachers if you ever done that? You know, not an old crusty guy, but they had new guy. All right. The guy who was like in his thirties seemed like he had it all together at least to you. And you were sitting in your class before you realize these probably make it only 18 grand a year with no benefits. Of course he has the whole summer off, which would be great for the kids and the above ground pool, underrated above ground pool under fucking rated the above ground pool. I mean, how much into the water do you need to be? As long as it goes up to your neck, you're fine right there in the winter time. You let it freeze over and you can skate on it. Actually bill for above ground pool, little of water. Shut the fuck up up. Nobody cares about your sites. So listen to this.

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       I told you last week I fucked up my ribs or I fucking the cartilage around them. I don't know what happened. So, uh, I went to him with Seuss, you know, which is what you wanna do. You want to go to ah, fuck. You want to go to an a Seuss just sitting up purse. If you want to go to, you want to go to a fucking misuse that knows what the fuck they're doing. Cause basically all my muscles were spasms and this guy fucking fixed all of it. And I walked out of there and they felt great. And then like the German Irish asshole I was, I'm like, well you know about 60%. I guess I can go play drums at a 100% now and see what happens. And I came out of there and I felt like I got hit by a fucking car. Um, in a way it is because they'll bill, he's working on his double bass pedal. He's got the double pedal now. Huh. And you know what the deal is if you're a white guy and you're fun and you're white drummer if you're a warmer, right. What are the first couple of songs you're going to learn? Huh? Motley Crue live wire

Speaker 1:          00:09:55       before you move up to Pantera cowboys from hell. That's what it is. And I'm actually finding that fucking triplet like is easier than actually just playing 16th, 16th pass, like fucking 95 100 bpms. I just sound like a Horse Gallop and down the street, but I didn't realize was how much I was engaging my obliques. And the right side is all fucked up. So whatever. I have a, uh, I have another appointment next fucking week. But dude, I got to tell you something right now. You guys out there, all you old fucks like me. If you have aches and pains in your body before you go to a doctor, I'm telling you go see him as Seuss. All right? That actually I a top shelf messsage that knows what that understands the body and how it fucking works. Cause I'm telling you right now, if you go to a doctor, you, you know what they gonna do. What is it? Heart. This is my specialty. I'm a knee doctor, so I'm just looking at your fucking knee and then they're going to give you prescriptions. They're going to give you some pain medications, you know, next thing you know, you're, you're fucking on heroin.

Speaker 1:          00:10:59       You don't need, Oh, you could just go to [inaudible] and not play drums at the end of the day. And I think you'll be fine. As always. I have no idea what I'm talking about, but it does warm my heart on things I do give. Thanks right now thinking that I'm, I'm possibly ignoring, not ignoring annoying somebody in the medical field.

Speaker 4:          00:11:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:22       That's not true on the new doctor. I take in consideration the hip joint to fucking pharynx, your larynx, pharynx, the hypothalamus, pharynx. I think I just invented a body part that she, ah, it's your thyroid and your larynx where they connect. It's like the taint between the two of them. Larynx is somewhere in your voice box and your thyroid. I don't where there that isn't that in your neck of a swollen thyroid. Yeah. And you also got something on the side of your mouth. So if you don't pick up the conversation, I'm walking away cause I don't give a shit about you fucking can I say that? Can I say that on the podcast? Will I offend thyroid Americans? Um, anyways, so I, uh, I fucking made of sweet potato pie first time this year. And what I learned was, uh, there's no sweet potato and a sweet potato pie.

Speaker 1:          00:12:21       It's actually fucking yams. I didn't know that I'm white. I don't know. So I, it was the least of fucking sweet potatoes I got when I fucking boiled them and got the skin off them, they will, they will Hawaii. So I was thinking, all right, maybe the cinnamon and nutmeg and that shit turns it Brown. It did not. I basically made a sweet, uh, I made a potato pie. The had a little bit of sweetness to it, so I had to fucking get rid of that thing. Went back, got some yams. You know, you got to understand people that I'm essentially going to be one of the few white people at my Thanksgiving dinner. And rather than making a Hawaiian Pie, I'm making a pie that is the staple of the black communities as far as I've been told. So there's all this fucking pressure.

Speaker 1:          00:13:07       Um, I'm thinking I'm going to take a pounding today as far as like, you know, I should have put these, should have put some vanilla in there. You should have done this. You should've done that. We'll see what happens. We'll see how I survive. You know what I mean? Which is probably a good thing that I'm not drinking today. You know what I mean? Cause then, you know, I would have all that alcohol in me, everybody be criticizing my Pi and then I'd start crying like a sad drunk. Speaking of sad, I realized I just fucking set back, which is not what you want to do because now I've got to make that noise again when I fucking sit up. Um, anyways, congrats. You know what I'm thankful for something else and I'm thankful for is the Celtic 16 game winning streak. What an absolute gift to start off the season.

Speaker 1:          00:13:56       I'm thankful for Danny Ainge or as I like to call them, Bill Belicheck junior. Look what this man is doing with draft picks. Look what this guy has done. Anybody can be like the Lakers and just sit around and go, who's the best players in the league? I will have them. Thank you very much. Oh did you already developed them? But to actually sit there and hold on to your draft picks for years and then exquisitely use them to trade, to move up in the draft to pick the guys to assemble the pieces. Who's kidding? Who were in the east? So everybody in the east is doing the exact same thing. We're waiting for Lebron to get old. You know? It's like everybody in the AFC east and football. It's just how long is this motherfucker Tom Brady going to be great for? You know, you know what the turning point his career was was getting with Jazelle.

Speaker 1:          00:14:53       All right, so what she has him on, she eat, he's like on that fucking wheat grass yoga diet. He's all flexible and stuff. You know what I mean? He's eating like a stab and model. Right. You show when he came into the league, came right in out of the fucking dorms eating fucking Jalapeno poppers. Did they even have those back then? That's how old he is, like, like a new appetizer has come around since he started in the league. That's when you know your old, you know what I mean? When all you want is those little mini fucking hot dogs with the mustard on them and somebody go, we have Jalapeno poppers. What? What? What are those? I am not familiar with those. Do you want some? A one set fucking weird one that's smores. Let's say one. Every. All those other weird families. You know what the weird families are that basically people that cook the shit that you don't eat, you know that's smores. Not Charlie Brown's, what do they call him? I said some chocolate thing. It just sounds like a sweet name for taking a dump. I can't remember what the fuck it is. They have no, he's he, you want one of these? It's like, no I don't, I don't. I'm hoping the lovely Nia will come in here and join me at some point on Thanksgiving,

Speaker 1:          00:16:10       so I give thanks for having a lovely wife. I was hoping that that was going to happen at some point, you know? You know what? My wife is like, she's like Louie Depalma on fucking taxi as far as the way she always gives me a fucking other jobs. Sick. She's like dispatch every time I'm out driving around you got to shut your phone off. Cause if you don't, you're just going to get all these assignments. Hey, are you like 40 miles away from the dry cleaner? Could you go over there and pick up some stuff?

Speaker 1:          00:16:51       Yes. How many are trashing you? Happy Thanksgiving to you bought a Booboo, booboo. Hurry guys, like today. You like the lines. Do you like the cowboys? Oh, here we go. Oh look who's here. There she is. Mrs Mrs burb up Baba Baba Baba booboo. Boo. A triumphant return making a triumphant maternal. Aw Man, I was just trashing you. Can you, uh, can you pull up the, uh, the, your chair there I was comparing you to Louie Depalma on taxi member. How he's in dispatch and it was always telling the guys where to go and pick up stuff. You're 10 years older than me and I don't does this references a lot of times I don't get, well, it's classic. Have you ever seen the Maltese Falcon in college, but I don't remember it. Oh, you don't? Oh, that's right. What's your plan? What is my point of? I like how aggressive you're going into this. This is very offensive. I like it. But you just said to me, you trashing me, so why wouldn't I be I, I wasn't saying that it was wrong. What was your point? Is it me or is there a lot of tension for a holiday? Yes. Yes, there is. I was just saying that I'm going to start when I go out and about, when I drive around Hollywood, checking out the scene, I'm going to start shutting off my phone.

Speaker 5:          00:18:12       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:18:14       Because you're always giving me jobs. Do you notice when you go out, I don't call you up and be like, Hey Nia, can you go by the two page shop and pick up my, my rug?

Speaker 5:          00:18:27       [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:18:30       yeah. I mean it's a real, it's a real hard time for you. I understand. It's difficult for you. I get that kind of thing. You're just going to go with arrogance. So beyond your capabilities. So that's cool. I'll manage my expectations. Thank you. Thank you. Can you do that? Can you stop giving me assignments? It's really hot in here. Does it just me? Is it really? It's really hot in here. So take off your bathrobe. Um, come on, stop it. Be Fun on the podcast. Just cause I went in there and I trashed you right out of the gate rather than being thankful. Oh my God. Oh my God. Hey did you, um, where were you giving me shit for coming in? So late last night. Cause I was wondering where that Effie, where I was upstairs. First of all. Okay. I came home and I went to turn on the fucking TV to watch the Bruins first.

Speaker 1:          00:19:25       The New Jersey devils and the fast forward button worked and then I couldn't get it to stop. But you always worse. It was on one. Oh No, it was actually trying to watch it like Ah, and I realized it needed new batteries. First world problems. Right. All right. So tell me what happened with your Thanksgiving dinner. Oh Wow. You know, I don't like to trash people in the podcast, but I will say that this particular company that I ordered from you promised you a peach cobbler and you got there and it wasn't there, you know? And so I made it known via a very short, simple email that I was disappointed in that fact. And you know, I was waiting two and a half hours to pick it up and you know, nobody could have nobody came out and said, hey, listen, doesn't look like the peach cobbler is happening.

Speaker 1:          00:20:16       I'm so sorry. Because then I would've been like, okay, well let me maybe run out and try to grab something. But you know, I waited for two and a half hours in the parking lot and got my food and came home. I was exhausted. And you're going to write those people back because they responded to your email with like a four page Gettysburg address. I'm telling you, she write him back and be like, if you spend as much time making my peach cobbler rather than giving me four pages of excuses where you're the victim, here's a good one for your business in the future. Don't promise what you can't deliver. That's much

Speaker 6:          00:20:48       what I yeah, yeah. They said you ordered really late and don't take the order. Yeah, they sent us that now. All right. Um, hey, but they were doing me a favor. Is is basically the tone that I got back was that they were doing me a favor and you know, um, it was difficult to get my payments information but it's like I missed a couple of phone calls cause I was with the baby. So now you have excuses and then when they would call a pod here on a third time, I gave them the information and for the full amount, not the half deposit that they initially requested, I was like go ahead and do the full amount. But you know, um, three guys think that when will there be a second date? Do you guys think you're ever going to, this is the second date per call.

Speaker 6:          00:21:31       So this is this, there will not be a third date. You know, life goes on and uh, yeah, that's why you cook your own fucking meal. I'm telling you, I see that some have to deal with other people. Bullshit. You know, it's, it's, it's fine though. It's like I expected this response back because I have dealt with this person before. So, you know, this isn't surprising that it would be like a whole list of reasons of excuses, I should say. Not even reasons. It's excuse. I loved how she kept complimenting you and telling you to have a happy thanksgiving. Oh, all in catalytic. Just the air getting on an airplane and we're jetting away to enjoy our, the anger as opposed to being like, I know you're disappointed. Sorry about that. Sorry, we promised something that we couldn't deliver, but here's four pages of excuses. Yeah. Here's a bunch of excuses why. And then to like, you know, bring my mother into it as well, which is very classy. Very, very classy on, on this person's part. But you know, I feel like Andy Cohen Roginos like I wish the other person who didn't make the sweet potato pie was here.

Speaker 6:          00:22:38       Sweet Potato Pie guy. I don't, oh, come on. So Nia, um, I have to do what? Have you started your Christmas shopping yet? No, I have, I am fucking crushing it. Nieces, nephews done. Okay. You done what's I'm done with you. I'm breaking up with, you know, Christmas gift for you. No, I'm actually, I'm going to wrap some shit and then I'm going to wrap my presence. Sorry. Can't read a little bit. Did you see the Christmas wrapping paper that I got for you? For the kids? I thought it was cute. Like peanuts and then like Rudolph or Mickey, your gifts are always going to be wrapped in that. We have other wrapping paper. All right, let me read this thing here. This frigging side feel so much better today after not moving. I think the key, the key to letting your rib cage heal is to not move. So I want to let you know today. I'm not avoiding you and your relatives. It's just not, I'm nursing my side. Okay. Are you going to be able to handle a sober me on the holidays? I mean having, I've been handling it for the last

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       however long. You haven't been drinking? No, but on the holidays usually get all drunk and belligerent. Start telling everybody around the room with their problem is, it's anytime. I'm a happy drunk. I liked it. So silly and goofy and you're very loving. You're one of those drunks that calls me up at four in the morning and telling me how much you love me. I do. It's so funny. That's why I don't need weed, man. I don't need the we, I'm done with that shit. You say that all the time. Yeah, but I don't smoke that much, so every time I do I just ate. Always fucking burns my throat. I don't get it. I just don't know how to control your inhale. Yeah. And I just don't get it. You're just doing like these bong rip type of things and like I do shots. What do you want?

Speaker 1:          00:24:34       Because you're trying to get that same effect. It doesn't work like that. Got I not just trying to fucking inhale and fill it out. I don't know. Yeah. I don't want to get good at it. I don't want to get good at, but whenever I don't drink then I'll, every once in a while I'll come around. It'll be all right. I gotta I gotta do something. I got to break up the monotony here. Thank God you're not into heroin or I'd be doing that, but heroin. I made a sweet potato pie. I feel like I'm down. I feel like I'm woke. All right. Frame Bridge. Everybody. If you've previously listened to this show, you've heard me talk about frame bridge. They make it so easy and affordable to co two custom frame favorite things from art prints and posters to the photos on your phone. I actually collected all the pictures of our lovely daughter and put it on a hard drive and there was so many of them that I was like, you know what?

Speaker 1:          00:25:25       I think frame bridge could really help me out with this one. There you go. That's a personal story. Men's health says frame bridge has disrupted the custom framing industry making what has typically been a frustrating and expensive process. Easy and affordable shots fired in the custom big frame. Take that. Yeah, custom framers and with the holiday around the corner of frame bridge is the perfect way to send truly one of a kind gifts without that much thought out, right to everyone on your list. This is perfect. This is what you need. The thing about it is, is so many people that you don't like, but you have to get him something. You know what I mean? That's perfect. You don't have the fucking time. Just scroll through your Goddamn cell phone. Go past the Dick Pics. Go Pass that dead dead picture of the directions. Okay. That you have saved on there for whatever reason, and find that picture of you and this person you just required to get a stocking stuffer for right?

Speaker 1:          00:26:27       And go in there and just send it up and then it's done and then it's done. There you go. There you go. What's a way did you go during all of that? You just fucking started staring a hole through my giant head here. Um, what do you think you're thinking about the meal, right? I am. You're a little off. You're a little off on this podcast. I'm sorry, I'm bx. I'm trying to figure out if I'm going to respond to this email or not. I don't think I'm going to, oh, I would have to, I would just real quickly, I would just be, I would just pay something along that and going back and forth and back and forth about it. You know what I mean? Like it's just going to be more of the same, you know, I said what I had to say and that was that they said to say and you know, there you go. You know what you guys both said, but you had to say and I think she's supposed to be thankful that you, uh, you know why I'm doing this and highly favored equal letters. Do I keep doing this? What I'm thankful for is I fucking hate. That's the one thing about Thanksgiving that I cannot stand is listening to adults. No.

Speaker 1:          00:27:31       Like just you don't think that's a nice, I don't like listening to it because I am so jaded that I'm just like, I just feel like people try to top one another about like what they're thankful for and how much more they understand what's really makes you happy in life. Yeah. Um, it's like when people have a baby and they tried to sit there and talk about like how much they love their babies, so then they have to top the other person. Oh my God, my heart is just filled to the brim with love. Oh yeah. I feel like my heart is on the outside of my body now and then they just keep fucking going about their heart and she's like to, to begin at elm. You can't love your kid. Yes, I get it. Oh my God. Is it standing up like all babies eventually do. That is incredible.

Let's not get into the population problem. Hey, hey. Hey. Fair enough. Fair enough. Speaking of, fair enough, the throwback podcast for you, for those of you who are new to my podcast and you're listening for the first time, which I am so thankful for, I just feel it for me. If I have board lists and Aries, um, Andrew who I am also thankful for the wonderful producer who picks out the music every week. When we do the, the, uh, after I, I babbled for a half hour, we then had listened to some music little interlude and then we go into a classic podcast from a Thursday gone by and another year or possibly earlier this year, evidently last year, one of these years I gave the uh, the now classic. I like to call it a classic because I would like to do something classic in life.

Speaker 1:          00:40:17       So I'm going to say that what I did was classic. Ah, the fair enough. Like how to get through your Thanksgiving dinner with the simple phrase. Fair enough, Huh? You don't feel that a boarding a child is murder. Fair enough. It is. You killed something. Right? Cause if you didn't do it, I mean dead, dead based something. Fair enough. I like doing that. I like arguing the opposite side of political shit. Like if I was in a conservative, a conservative fucking state, I would argue pro pro choice. When I'm in La I argue prolife and nothing, none of it has to do with the fetus or anything like that. All it has to do with is me annoying the person that I'm talking to them. That's what I do. Anyways, that's, that's the Thursday afternoon, just before Friday. Monday morning podcast. God bless all of you. I am so thankful. I'm so thankful to be able to go out and tell jokes every night and I just feel like for me, all right, have a great thanksgiving weekend you cunt and I will talk to you on Monday. I cannot wait to watch the football

Speaker 8:          00:41:34       game. And unfortunately, my wife has gone into that fucking Westminster dog show, which I really enjoy except for the fact that it comes on at the same time as the football game there. I set it by

Speaker 9:          00:42:16       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:42:30       the Turkey day to you all, you know, stuffing and potatoes and pie and beer, cranberries and gravy and your cousin who's gay. Um, hey, what's going on? How are you? Happy thanksgiving. Happy not having to fucking go to work today. Huh? You around the table. You're sitting down yet both. You haven't gone downstairs yet. I got, I got some advice for you. Today is going to be a day. I think that's going to be a lot of fucking arguments. A lot of fucking arguments at the table, right? The big fucking election. Some people wanted the guy with the eyebrows. Some people wanted the fucking lady with the pants suit, right? Um, this is what you gotta do is see you. You're already going to have a fight, right? There's already going to be your older brother. There's going to be this person. There's going to be another per, somebody's going to say something, right?

Speaker 1:          00:43:31       And you're going to be, you're going to have a couple of wild fucking turkeys. He's just standing over there, you know, eating a fucking appetizer or two and somebody is going to be getting on your nerves. Maybe somebody fucking wife who won't shut the fuck up, right? Why the fuck did he marry? Or maybe maybe it's the husband, Jesus Christ. What is she doing with this guy? All he does is fucking talk about himself. Something's going to drive you up the fucking wall. If it's not this, it's going to be that this is, this is the phrase, this is a phrase that's going to save your day. Okay? Save the whole fucking day. Cause you're not going to change anybody's opinion. Oh, these fucking jerk off. Still yelling. He Hug. Well, could you vote for Trump? Well, what the Fuck About Hillary? You're not changing. You're just gonna fucking yell at each other. So here's the phrase she got to use to get through this fucking day. All right. Along with the alcohol or whatever drug you fucking want to use.

Speaker 8:          00:44:19       Fair enough. You know? Hey, fair enough.

Speaker 1:          00:44:26       That's all I, that's all you gotta do. What'd you say? Hey, hey guys, guys, guys, fair enough. Fair enough. Whatever. You don't need to see him anymore right now, if you're younger and you still live there, that's kind of fucking tough. I don't know what to tell you, but if you've already moved out of the house, why are you still arguing with these people? Why are you still trying to change their fucking minds? You're not going to change their minds. All right? I don't give a fuck. If you majored in debating it, you stupid fucking skull in the woods, whatever the fuck it is. You did the, now you're coming back and now you think you know something and you think that you fucking siblings want to hear it. You know what? They don't the same way. You don't want to hear the way they fucking eat.

Speaker 1:          00:45:07       When they had, they've had a couple, two, three, right? And all the sudden the man, everything just sounds like they're eating fucking mashed potatoes. You know? You start having these murderers fucking thoughts, you know, just fair enough. Hey, fair enough. Whenever it, whenever it was that what you think is that it's there. How you look at the world. Hey God bless Ya. Pass the fucking peas and carrots. Fair enough. Fair enough. You know, and that's all you got to do that eventually the meal's going to be over. All right, and you're going to get in your fucking car and you're going to drive away unless you stay in there for the weekend, then you've got to go out to, I don't know, you got to. Oh, but you gotta write, you gotta get the fuck out of there. Yeah. Thanksgiving is a, it's such a great day.

Speaker 1:          00:45:54       There's no pressure to get any gifts eaten a bunch of great food. All of that is tremendous. Okay. Unless, unless you go into her fucking family's house or his family's house, that's a weird one because you know, you're used to all your family's food and thanksgiving. You know how it's supposed to taste that you're going to go somewhere else. It's going to taste a little bit different. You know, this is like a classics standup bit like here's how it usually is, but when you're fucking blah, blah, blah, it's a whole different story, right? Then you just got to suck it up and just be like, you know, worst case scenario, this absolutely fucking sucks, you know, in which case, fair enough. You know, you don't know how to cook. Okay, you're supposed to cook today. You know, it's, it's like when it's somebody's birthday, most people can't sing, but God dammit, you got to sing the songs.

Speaker 1:          00:46:47       So they do the best they can. Happy Birthday, right? They do what the fuck they can. Well, sometimes she got to take the, the, the same fucking theory of a tone deaf person singing happy birthday to you because they love you. Right? You get, you got to apply that to food, which is a motherfucker, which brings it to how do I make it look like I ate the shit when I really didn't? Well, oh Jesus, I don't know how to do this one. What you gotta do is you've got to fucking, uh, you got to engage in a lot of conversation as you just sort of fucking hit and the plate with your fork a little bit as if you almost like, you know, that noise people make when they want someone to make a speech. That annoying fucking thing, you know? Oh my God, nothing fucking makes my god damn blood boil. Like when I'm in the middle of a fucking conversation at some con starts hitting the glass with the fork and then for whatever social fucking reason I have to now shut up, you know? Oh my God, that gets me going. But not today. Not Today. Everybody. Hey, fair enough. Hey somebody sounds so. He's down the fucking street over there with a little, a little fucking stone knocking against some glass.

Speaker 1:          00:48:01       You know, I guess we all have to start as adults. We have to shut the fuck up, right?

Speaker 5:          00:48:07       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:48:07       Like we're working for this asshole bay. You know what? Hey, fair enough. Fair enough. You know, he just fucking sit there. Oh, here we go. Oh good. Oh, here's a cliched what? I'm thankful for speech. Oh, is that what you're thankful for? You know what? I'm thankful for lady. Every fucking word that comes out of your mouth is one less worry. It was one word closer to the end of whatever the fuck it is you're saying. You know?

Speaker 5:          00:48:32       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:48:33       That's when you know you're the passive aggressive movies is when someone's in the middle of that is you. You fucking as some, it is just kind of pointed. Somebody pointed some a plate, you know, little fucking, give me that bottle right there. They're still yammering on. You know, you know back in 1983 when we first saw this house, right? And you just sit there butter in your fucking roll. Oh is this why the fuck are going to go every God damn year from 1983 hey, you know what? Fair enough. Fair enough. Yeah.

Maybe they ran out of them down the quiz, the last fucking time they ever ran out of potatoes. They never run out of potatoes and this country, it's why so many fucking Irish people over here, right? Fucking Irishmen. And they tapped out on their own country one fucking time. And their whole history, they run out of potatoes and everybody fucking jumped ship. Right? But not the real Irishman. The Real Irishmen and real ladies, they fucking stuck around.

Speaker 5:          00:49:43       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:49:44       I like these cowards that all move to fucking New Jersey. Um, but you know what a fair enough, you know, they wanted some potatoes. This is one of these days people, you know, and if you're a younger man, you got to enjoy the holidays cause cause they're never going to get, it doesn't get better then, you know, cause you don't know any better. So the food tastes the way the fucking food is supposed to taste in your world. Right? Everyone who's supposed to be there is there.

Speaker 5:          00:50:14       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:50:17       it's when you get older and you start expanding your fucking world and all of a sudden you know Jesus Christ. I mean, you're sitting there with somebody, you might even, we have me and might be sitting at their fucking table being, I don't even know if with the right person right now, what the fuck am I day? You know what, hey say what? Be Fair enough. I'm with somebody that I probably was never really in love with but didn't realize what love was. You know, and now here I am,

It was the name of the song and it was the name of the album and lead singer killed himself. There's a trivia question. Do you remember early eighties big country, there was a band called big country. They had an album called big country and the name of their hit song was big country. Needless to say, with a well of talent like that to pull from, I dunno how they only had one hit song. We're called cupcake is our thong cupcake for our album. Cupcake. Fucking calve. K toodaloo and then that's it. I mean what the fuck is wrong with you? Don't think about switching it up a little bit. It's actually isn't funny cause the lead singer ended up killing himself.

They slow it down and they show you how to play it. And people still ask for tabs. Great Video, but do you have any tabs? Why didn't you just ask the guy to fucking go over there and put your fingers on the Fret Board for ya? You Lazy. Fuck. Oh, there's Lampinelli. They got a nice picture of Lisa Lampanelli on. Now let's see if my picture comes up. No, it goes right to fucking you too. Okay. And some guy with a cowboy hat named Brad Paisley on his American Saturday night tour. All right, let's see if there's some sort of search here.

Speaker 10:         00:58:46       Okay.

Speaker 6:          00:58:47       All right, let's go to the bees. Blue Rodeo. Bob Dylan, boys like girls brand new Brandi Carlile. Brian Regan and know me well, that's good.

The Black Crowes la Los Lobos bill bar right there. So that's what you do. All right. So I don't need any fucking emails from you whiny bitches about how you can't find fucking tickets cause I just did it in real time. All right. So anyways, as I said, I'm sitting on my fucking couch here and I'm actually watching a replay or the Bruins sabers game. I don't know who wins. Don't fucking tell me. Um, as what I do, I take all the hockey games and I come back like a fucking scout and I watched like seven games. I already watched when the Bruins beat the, uh, Atlanta thrashers and I gotta tell you something. They got a great fucking team and I don't know why they have an NHL team in Atlanta because you should, you should have seen the amount of sales look like a fucking a AA meeting.

Speaker 8:          01:00:17       That's how many people were there for the fucking thrashers game, you know? And they got eagle yet Coleville Chuck and a couple other fucking guys with names. Like they should be working the Russian border, but they're fucking great players. But I don't understand why did they put what, what the fuck is wrong with the NHL? Why did they put another team in Atlanta? You know, I don't understand cities that fail in a sport and then get another opportunity. You know, I'm one of the few people that understands why Los Angeles doesn't have an NFL team. Well, let's say you had two of them and you'll, they both left you. Now, right there, I mean, granted, I don't know why the fuck they left. Typical me. I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about, but all I know is you don't put fucking hockey in Atlanta. All right? If the fact that the, the original Atlanta flames left 30 years ago, if that wasn't enough of a tip, why don't you listen to parliament and they'll let you know that it's a chocolate city.

Speaker 8:          01:01:19       You know who the fuck is from Atlanta Little Wayne. You've got everyone from like little Wayne to like rem. And I'm going to go out on a limb here and I'm going to say Michael Stipe is, he doesn't strike me as a fucking hockey fan. You know, the fuck is wrong with you. So anyways, I'm watching the game. There's like 30 people in the crowd. There's no fucking energy whatsoever. But now I'm watching the Bruins sabers and I always, never the Bruins play the savers. I have to listen to the, uh, the Sabres announcer. I Dunno what the fucking guy's name is, but I swear to God he could make, he can make watching somebody sit waiting for a bus. Sound exciting. He's one of the best guys in the league. So I always watch that fucking guy. So that's what I'm doing. Was that boring? I hope it was. Cause I'm fucking tired. I'm really country this week. Um, uh, why am I being an asshole? It's thanksgiving. Thanksgiving is come up is coming up. Let me, uh, let me switch the tone here. Um, you know, people, this is a week when everyone, all Americans should sit down no chain. When those fucking

Speaker 6:          01:02:20       Douche bags get on TV, you know, with the ear muffs and their little fucking NBC gloves, they're fucking overcoats with the floats going by in the background, they start telling you about why you should be so fucking thankful for your fucking miserable life. You know, we not, maybe if I was on network television, you know, with the cashmere coat that I didn't have to fucking pay for, I could enjoy my Turkey a little more. This year. You know, you know what all Americans should be given. Thanks right now. They should be sitting around going, what the fuck happened? For whatever reason, everything from the bankers did that fucking Twat who dropped you out nowhere. Supposed to sit there and happy and you're catatonic state with cranberry sauce dripping down your fucking chin. You know I can't. That's, you know, this is such a great fucking holiday.

Speaker 6:          01:03:12       If you don't listen to anybody, you know you don't have to buy any gifts. And by the way, Wednesday of this week, for all you drunks out there, I know you know this information, but just bear with me for all you amateur drinkers, drinkers out there. This is the best. The Wednesday before Thanksgiving is the best night of drinking all year. Hands down. All right? It's not new years. You know when all his fucking idiots go out with their silly hats and those noise makers, why anyone goes out that night? His fucking beyond me. Unless you're out there telling jokes trying to make money, which I understand. All right? That night and Saint Patrick's day and everyone's got their green plastic hats and they're singing those stupid fucking side green alligator and along net goes, why are all eating corned beef sandwiches? Let me ask you this. During the course of the fucking year, the amount of times you go out to eat and grab a sandwich, do you ever order a corned beef sandwich? She had doubt cause she'd know. Does anybody even know what animal that comes from? Cause I don't

Speaker 6:          01:04:16       corn beef is ETA. That's cattle, right? Beef. Pork is a pig. Oh fuck it though. You know, you know I was riffing about this week and I'll actually talk about it here in the podcast because I don't give a fuck about burning this joke just cause it's a topical joke. Why did they stop calling it the swine flu? Did all the farmers complain? We ain't going to be a wholesale no fucking pig. You keep calling it the swine flu you want, you want bacon up to your fucking eyeballs in every fucking pig warehouse out there. You know, and don't even act like a don't affect he because government is going to have to buy it back. So why don't you come up with a new fucking name forward? H One n one is not the name of a fucking plague. The black death. That's the name of a plague. All right. You know what? Let me fucking look that up. That's what it's pissing me off here is we finally got a plague. You know something that I've been for for

Speaker 8:          01:05:18       a long fucking time. Imagine if I ended up getting it. They'd play this at my funeral. Well, you know, we uh,

Speaker 6:          01:05:26       he died the way he wanted to die. I mean, the guy was into the fucking

Speaker 8:          01:05:30       swine flu and let me, let me, let me search here. Great plagues. There's no way. I'm not on some FBI fucking watch list after this goddamn search. How the fuck do you self spell plague? I know it's not that way. Pla gue great plagues. Did you mean I liked that after you, you fucking spell it wrong and then Google is like, did you mean this? You fucking moron? Of course I did.

Speaker 10:         01:05:56       Yeah.

Speaker 8:          01:05:56       All right. I guess there was one called the great plague. What do I need to search? Awesome plagues. Plagues. How would I just search plagues? All right. This is a long fucking way to go. Just tell you why that they should still call it the fucking swine flu. The 10 plagues of Egypt, Jesus Christ, and one of the fluff. So fucking skinny over there, Huh? Time. You turn around them as a great way to lose weight. 10 plagues in a row, even if you survive it, right? There's no way you're gonna be more than a buck 40 are Egyptian skinny. I don't even know what they are. You only a gypsy Shin. I know. Is Anwar Sadat, right? The 10 plagues. Ah. Who gives a fuck? All right. Wait. The plague of lice. The plague of flies. What does it some biblical Shit I fucking give up. You know what I'm saying? They swine flu. That's a great name. We'll think about it. If you could just put yourself a hundred years in the hit in history. If you look back and they talk about, you know, if when we're old we talk about it, you know,

Speaker 6:          01:06:59       every day much going. Great. And then in 2009 the swine flu came, Ga Ga grabber. Where did the swine flu come from? I'll show you where it came from. Some foreign are fucked or fucking peg.

Speaker 6:          01:07:18       Have you guys noticed that? All the new diseases, there's never any sort of scientific explanation of where they come from. So all you can do is go get down to your local bar and listen to people hypothesize. I don't know if you've noticed, but anytime you go into a bar, if you ask where a disease came from, that's the answer you always get. Somebody from another country had sex with an animal and now we're all gonna die ever since age. Remember that? Do it. I'll tell you what happened. Somebody fucking blew a monkey and then they fucked this. Store this in. There you go. You know, you always have to have some sort of nationalism in it. You know, dude, you don't see anybody fucking pigs in this country, right? It's why we need to close the borders.

Speaker 8:          01:08:06       Oh fuck yeah. I think the swine flu would be great. You know, it'd be a nice cleansing, a nice cleansing, get rid of bunch of, you know, you're

Speaker 5:          01:08:16       not going to die of it. Just take some vitamins, put on a sweater, you'll be fine. It's just going to kill the week. And that's what needs to happen. If you notice every other animal, all the strong survive, all the weak die. And that's why there's no, there's no traffic in the squirrel community. Have you ever, have you ever just seen just a fucking highways worth of squirrels, you know, peaking over each other's shoulders trying to figure out what the fuck is going on upfront as are all waiting to try to get some fucking,

Speaker 8:          01:08:48       not a whatever the fuck they eat. You know, you don't, you know why? Because they cause the weak don't survive. And the problem is is we have medicine and we keep saving people. And that's why you can't get an empty row on a plane anymore because seated next to you, a two fucking people who should have died 30 fucking years ago. You know, and if you don't believe me, watch them. Try to get their oversized bag into the fucking, uh, overhead compartment and watch how their brain works. As you're sitting there visually seeing, why doesn't he just turn it sideways? If he has it going that way, there's no way the door can close. I can't believe he just tried to close the door again. Are you a fucking moron? And then I like when they're sitting there with a suitcase, which I don't know if you've noticed, is a solid object. Okay. And it's in the shape that it's in. You can't push it in further. Like it's a fucking beanbag and it's going to take the shape of the compartment. Like it's some sort of water based thing. Alright. Jesus Christ, Cleo. Oh my God, the fucking dog just farted really bad. Really? You just got to lay there. That's, you know, that's what kills me. It's not that my dog farts, it's the complete lack of guilt on her face. She just doesn't give a shit.

Speaker 5:          01:10:06       Okay.

Speaker 8:          01:10:06       Evidently that causes a lot of stress, doesn't it? Holding farts in or whatever. Some sort of methane gas. I can tell you right now, there's not a fucking ounce in my dog clout.

Speaker 5:          01:10:20       Okay,

Speaker 8:          01:10:21       why I button you that nice big bed. I bought my dog this fucking insane. That cost me like 200 bucks, you know and I, you know who spends 200 bucks in a bed? I'll tell you I'd fucking dog owner dies because that's how much she love you dog. Right? And I swear to God I've gotten this thing there and it literally, it loves his bed so much. You know what it looks like when it's sleeves, how hard this fucking dog sleeps on that bed. You guys watch pro football, you haven't noticed when somebody gets knocked out for some reason when a wide receiver gets knocked out, this always ends up happening there. Legs always end up crossed and then they got that one arm like don't, he's like stuck up in the air. You know, like they will right in the middle of making a point.

Speaker 8:          01:11:02       Like they were pontificating. If anybody that you haven't noticed that that's how she fucking sleeps. Her back legs get crossed and one of her and she lays on her back and one of her pauses up in the air. Like she just got drilled by fucking Ray Lewis. Um, anyways, I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about here. Uh, now I'm interested in this 10 plagues of Egypt. This has to be some sort of biblical Shit, right? That they're still fighting about today that makes them want to kill Jews in Egypt and Egypt and Israel as number three. They always end up arguing about, um, I say you let them fight it out. That's my solution to the Middle East. You know, why don't we just pull up stakes and let them have at it. You know, you want to fucking kill each other. Go ahead. It's great for the environment,

Speaker 4:          01:11:48       you know,

Speaker 8:          01:11:51       sort of a manmade plague. All right. That's what I do. The week of Thanksgiving, I say, Oh, I'm pro war. Um, all right, let's, let's talk about football. I got a lot of shit last week from people who are fans of, um, Peyton manning for, uh, talking about what a cry baby that cry baby is. And then a lot of points that people brought up. Uh, for some reason I can't fucking find them. I don't know where the hell they are. Maybe they're in junk, but I'll basically paraphrase it. They're like, Oh

Speaker 6:          01:12:19       God, you're going to, you're going to give Peyton manning shitty. And you can say Brady's not a cry baby. What about that time earlier this year when he turned around and asked for a flag and got the call? What do you mean? Oh, that's your example of Brady being a cry baby because he got hit and he turned around and asked for a fucking flag. What you mean? Like every wide receiver when they don't catch a ball, every fucking play in the NFL. Every fucking guy gets up bitch and looking for a flag. He got the flag. The same way Michael Jordan is allowed to push off people and doesn't get called for a foul cause. He's one of the stars in the fucking league. All right,

Speaker 6:          01:12:59       and other points somebody tried to make, they're talking about all the roughing, the passer, the Tom Brady rule. Tom Brady did not fucking campaign for that rule. He didn't. That was a fucking NFL rule where they're like, wait a minute. If our pretty boy quarterbacks aren't playing, the viewership goes down and we make less money. That was a business decision. Tom Brady didn't campaign for that fucking rule, which brings me back to the crybaby, Peyton Manning, who lost a playoff game that the patriots and fucking cried at the end of the fucking game. And then he and his coach, Tony Dungy made a fucking a tape, a game tape, sent it to the league. They cried some more at the fucking pro bowl. Two weeks later, a week after the Patriots won another title, they're fucking crying again about it. And then he cried about it at the draft. That's why he's a fucking baby. And I forgot to bring up the fact when he didn't win the Heisman trophy that's on fucking youtube. I believe Ricky Williams won it that year. And when he didn't win it, the look of entitlement, Uber to put your professional quarterback. I was bred for this. That fucking look on his face. He's a fucking baby. Tom Brady has never lost a game and then thrown his teammates under the bus. Peyton manning. How many fucking

Speaker 8:          01:14:12       more examples do you need? All right. You Jack Asses with the fucking surrogate fucking team out there. It's the Baltimore Colts, by the way. All right. Or Colts. When I say boss Baltimore Coats, I don't fucking know. Fuck all of you guys. You just fucking hate the Patriots because we fucking win. And what did I say? Did I not say that the Patriots were going to fucking kill the jets, which we did yesterday. Other than that little brief hiccup, 31 14 all right. And I called that Rex Ryan Shit too. I've been saying it since the third week. Rex Ryan, that poor bastard, the guy's out of his fucking mind. He's gonna make a halfhearted attempt at his life this week. I did. My prediction is he's going to break his, he's going to break his tailbone trying to hang himself and yes, that is a fat joke. All right.

Speaker 8:          01:15:01       I think I already did this on a podcast. My psychological breakdown of Rex Ryan, this is when I knew that guy was out of his mind. Okay. When he first said when the Patriots were going to play him and he was like, you know, I'm not here to kiss their rings. I thought it was funny and I like, I like this guy, you know, even though he's a coach of the jets, he's talking shit. But then there was that week when a player from another team said something derogatory about them and he actually responded to it, a hedge co head coach responding to some player on another team and he's trying to act all cocky and confident and it was something about his smile. I saw it in his face. I'm like, this guy fucking cries himself to sleep every night with a pint of fucking ice cream.

Speaker 4:          01:15:39       You know,

Speaker 8:          01:15:42       this is what I think happened. All right? His Dad, Buddy Ryan, one of the great defensive coaches came up with the 40 60 fence, you know, won a Superbowl. I'll tell ya, doing something like that, you don't have time to raise your kid and you don't have time to be there for. So all this shit talk and fucking Rex Ryan does all the shitty sane is this shit. He wished his dad said to him when he was a kid kid, so he could have built up some sort of confidence, but he didn't. He wasn't around. So the combination is still looking for his dad's fucking approval and living in the shadow of a man who created the 46 fucking defense has caused this guy to be an insecure shit talk and psychopath. And I think in his head he knows that he can coach at the professional level, but the the fucking deafening voice of doubt that he goes, that fucking is in that guy's head. I'm telling you, that's why you overeat. He's one of those guys,

Speaker 8:          01:16:36       you know when that voice in his head's gone, racks, what are you doing coaching at the professional level? You're not as good as your dad. They're going to find out what you're going to get fired. You'll never coach again. You're going to have to move home with your fucking parents. They're going to kick you out. You get to be always [inaudible] fuck it. Oh yeah. That's why eats all that ice cream. He gives himself that fucking ice cream headache and that's all you can focus on. It only takes a couple of Tylenol pms, and then he goes to sleep and the next day he wakes up with all that dairy product rolling around in his fucking intestines and he's hung over from all the Tylenol PM's and then he does a press conference. He doesn't know what the fuck he's doing. He's like one of those wrestlers, you know, he's got the sickness. He's like, Jake, the snake. If he was fat, Hey, you know what? Speaking of which, somebody asked me a question. Um, this week they said a bill, you always drop references to wrestling on your podcasts. Um,

Speaker 6:          01:17:31       and during your appearances a, the ric flair mentioned suplex thing, a girl you've said that during your standup special. So are you actually a fan or were you a fan back when you were a kid? Um, I don't think, I know one adult in real life who watches wrestling and I don't blame him because a lot of the time it's corny and it's Corny as hell help. Uh, I'm still a fan and it's just one of those things I never grew out of. And if you're a fan, who is your all time favorite? All right. Uh, your first guess was correct. I was

Speaker 8:          01:17:58       each fan when I was a kid and, um,

Speaker 6:          01:18:02       but Rick Flair, I have to admit, I got into ric flair

Speaker 8:          01:18:05       because of one of the listeners here when he brought up the flare chop and I started watching Rick flair and I realized what a fucking genius he was. So, um, I watched the WWF when I grew up, so ric flair was in something else. I think with the von Erickson, I kind of used to watch that, but I, I watched WWF and when I first started watching Bob Backlund was the champion. And I want to say Bruno Bruno Sammartino might've been Ted dibiase was the intercontinental champion until Pat Patterson took that foreign object out of his trunks, smashed him in the face with it, and somehow the ref didn't see it. Then Pat Patterson became Unicon Anelle champion and a, let's see me. I sound like the fucking rain man, as I always do when I try to remember this shit.

Speaker 4:          01:18:50       Uh,

Speaker 8:          01:18:53       the tag team champion was Tony Galleria and Larry's a Bisco and uh,

Speaker 4:          01:19:01       okay.

Speaker 8:          01:19:01       I don't know fuck else. Ivan put ski Polish Power Bulldog Brower.

Speaker 4:          01:19:07       Okay.

Speaker 6:          01:19:07       Mr Fuji, Mr Sido, the moon. Remember the fucking moon dogs, those three fat hillbillies with their overalls.

Speaker 4:          01:19:14       Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:19:15       And then one wouldn't be laying on the floor with the dog bone. And I was, I was scared shitless to them. You noticed as used to scare me with George, the animal Steele when he came out with a green tongue and he'd be eating the belt buckle. I thought it was fucking real is fucking Harry back. Killer Khan the way you used to scream that big Mongolian son of a bitch used to scare the shit out of me, you know. Then I realized like George, the animal Steele was like a fucking substitute teacher on to Detroit and it just kind of all fell apart. So then I, you know, I watched it right through Mr. Wonderful Rowdy Roddy Piper.

Speaker 4:          01:19:50       MMM Jesse

Speaker 6:          01:19:53       the body Ventura when he used to call a Tito Santana used to call him Chico Santana. I don't care about no Chico Santana. I used to watch back then and then I briefly 10 years ago I got back into it cause I was roommates with Robert Kelly and he started watching the Rock and stone cold Steve Austin. I got into it briefly during then, but I used to mainly watch, uh, just the shit talking on the mic but, and it hasn't been good for a while, so there you go. There's my long drawn out question. Fucking answer to your question there. Um, all right, let's get on with the podcast here. Um, oh wait a minute. I have to hype one other thing. I'm really all over the place as opposed to the usual. I'm even more so all over the place. Um, I have a new website out there.

Speaker 6:          01:20:41       It's called a uninformed radio.com and a, that's the radio show. I deal with Joe to Rosa and myself. Uninformed, no reading, no research, just strong opinions. It's our radio show. Um, we are unable to get it onto iTunes because we're not going through some big conglomerate. Um, so we're just going to be putting them up for free. You can listen for free and eventually you'll be able to download them for a buck of whack. So there you go. That'll be your options. You know, if you don't want to pay, you can just sit there and listen to it at your computer. But if you know you want to take it on your iPod and become the hit of the year, the next party you go to, you know, just in case you go to a party and they don't have a fucking computer, you can download it, you can download it for a buck.

Speaker 6:          01:21:25       So, uh, we're going to be trying to get that up as quickly as possible. And, uh, and that's it. So anyways, really been all over the place. You know what I did last last week? No, Bill, what the fuck did you do? I went and I saw, uh, the best rock show I've seen in a long time. I went to go see, uh, uh, what does it them crick, those crick them crooked vultures. So what the fuck? I kept calling them crooked buzzards, them crooked vultures. I went to go see which is uh, uh, I guess it's, that's super group. Scott, John Paul Jones from led Zeppelin, uh, David Grohl on drums and I don't know how to say the lead singer's name cause I never heard anybody say is that Josh Hommie from Queens of the Stone Age and eagles of death metal. I've been listening to all those bands for years just because, uh, you know, I've been a big fan of Dave girls drama.

Speaker 6:          01:22:18       And so whenever he would go, you know, do like killing joke or he'd be in Queens of the Stone Age, I got into those guys. So anyways, I went to go see the show. Um, and I bought their new album. They were actually selling it on vinyl, so I had to get it so I could seem cool at my next party. And if you get a chance, um, I mean their whole album is up on youtube, so listen to it. If you like it, don't be a cunt. Go out and go buy it and then go see them on tour. Man, they will fucking unreal. And Dave Grohl might be the best live rock drummer I've ever seen. Uh, the guy that he's just, he's fucking unreal. The guy was the shit. And uh, I dunno man. I felt like I was like a fucking kid watching that were, you know, even when you watch a great band and you just wish you were up there doing it, and then as you're driving home, you start thinking all the cool stuff that happened and then were actually fantasizing

Speaker 8:          01:23:06       that it was you that did it. Like that's how fucking good the, uh, that's how I was just fucking awesome. They just a fucking killer band and uh, uh, it's all I've been doing is listening to this shit. So, uh, if you get a chance, definitely go check those guys out. Or if you want to see the show that I went to, what's already up on fucking youtube because people record everything. Um, just search them crooked vultures will turn w I l, T, e, r, n and then Los Angeles and you'll get to see the fucking show. I saw it. You know, I haven't, I've been fucking sitting here. I got the God damn game on mute here. Who's winning? Is it still one to one my allowed to do that or am I on some sort of copyright infringement here? Oh, it's one to one the third period.

Speaker 5:          01:23:58       Okay.

Speaker 8:          01:23:59       Buffalo's got a fucking great goaltender, sons of bitches. You know something I wouldn't mind seeing buffalo winning poor bastard. You know, you got fucked in 99.

Speaker 8:          01:24:10       What else did you go to the finals. So you go to the finals in the 70s. Was that Saint Louis? Do you lose to the flyers? I don't fucking know. No one gives a shit bill. All right, let's plow ahead here. Uh, last week I did the answer to the, uh, the women thing. Why is it never enough? And that created an absolute shit storm and a, of basically misogynistic trashing of women. So let's continue it. No, I'm kidding. Uh, we're going to try to balance it out here. I actually, I took one, two comments from women, one supporting what we said last week, and another one who just really brought up the point that should have been made from the beginning. So let me read the first one. All right. Uh, first off, bill loved the podcast. Especially this week's, I have rarely heard someone so succinctly describe what is wrong with the predominant attitudes of women, even men today. Um, you know what most women really want from men? It's not material, nor is it being spontaneous. It runs deeper than that. Women wants sacrifice. Did I read this last week? I can't fucking remember. Maybe I did. I'm losing my mind. Women, one sacrifice. Most women will tell you, uh, your dreams are selfish if they don't revolve around them. And that real love is compromised and commitment. Uh, they want you to drop.

Speaker 8:          01:25:32       I'm just trying to remember, did I already read this?

Speaker 8:          01:25:34       I have fucking, I'm going to plow ahead. They want you to drop your hopes and dreams. They want to see the moment you give up. I emphasize that because once that moment has passed and you have nothing left to sacrifice, you become that 30 to 40 year old loser that they will leave to the guy who asks, why is it never enough? It isn't until you've given up everything that is important to you. This is what love is for most women. It's not even that they are selfish, but propose precisely the opposite. It's the complete other lack of self. I think I already read this, didn't I? The nature of love is not that of a host and a parasite. Love is only possible between two complete our independent individuals who do not require sacrifice from one another. Real selfish people do not need approval or love from others.

Speaker 8:          01:26:17       They simply would not give a fuck. I don't know if I agree with that. What you're basically saying is you need a significant part of your life that it's not two overlapping circles. It's two intersecting circles is basically what it is. So where you intersect is your lives together and where you're not is your own fucking life that you're allowed to lead. Um, sign off. That was a bunch of generalizations but that's what we do here. But this, this lady here just basically sums up the whole thing. She says, Bill Lady, you've been talking about men who have been doing all these nice things for women and the women have been complaining about it like selfish cuts. My response is this, men need to stop allowing women to get away with anything they fucking want. Seriously, it's the pursuit of pussy turn men into all men and to whiny bitches.

Speaker 8:          01:27:04       All these guys have been whining about the way these girls react when they do something they think is nice. What these guys really need to do is stand up for themselves and tell these chicks they have two options. Say thank you or I don't get number two. It says, try to be nice and let them and let him complain about it. I don't know what that means. Um, these guys are writing to you instead of country confronting these women. So the women aren't even aware that their behavior needs to change. They are only making it worse. Exactly. That's really the truth of all of this shit. You know, I mean, I actually ran into the guy when I was in Tempe who wrote that, uh, that, that letter of why isn't it enough? I met his girl, she was a sweetheart and everything. It's just kind of a, it just was a great question to ask.

Speaker 8:          01:27:52       That set off a lot of fucking frustration and a yeah. What the reality is, is what this woman wrote here is that 100% true is that you really shouldn't be writing me bitching about it. You should be talking to you, a woman. But you know, some of it is, you know, people just want to vent. And then there's other times people are there in fucked up situations and by fucked up situations, I mean, they're married. So, um, I think what a lot of guys learned quickly is when they get married is now that they're legally bound to someone and if they break up with them, they lose half their shit. It becomes, it's not a balanced situation, you know, if, I shouldn't just just put that on guys, but it's whoever has more, whoever brought more into the relationship when you get married, you fucked because you stand to lose more, which we can in you're arguing position, which you have to do is get to that zen place where you don't give a fuck about materialistic goods and then you can really go off on whoever the fuck you're with.

Speaker 8:          01:29:00       But the reality is, you know, same thing, like when you see like, you know, the big thing, when I first started doing comedy, as I used to always see female comics would go on stage and they'd be joking about how guys don't know what they're doing in bed. Debbie. Like, oh my God, they have no idea where it is or what the dual ba Ba ba Ba, Ba, you know, which I understand the frustration of that. But it's like, so you know, I'll wait. Sam Kinison did the bit, just tell us, tell us what to do, we'll fucking do it. Um, I think that's what a lot of complaining is. God knows a lot of my complaining. I said, well why don't you just walk up to the person or thing that you're bitching about and tell him how you feel and just take out all the fucks and the insulting the, the insults, I dunno, you know, at this podcast fucking sucks. I'm going to call it out before you guys. It's just podcast is just sucked this week. All right, I'm all over the fucking place. I'm fucking exhausted. It's a Goddamn holiday weekend. You can you guys and really, how hard are you work in this week?

Speaker 6:          01:29:58       You know, hasn't somebody gone come in and brought a pie in and somebody is wearing an awful brown and orange Thanksgiving sweater. You know, maybe it's your manager to show that he has a human side. You know? Isn't that the worst when you hate your fucking boss? And then around the holidays, all of a sudden he just lets up a little bit and tries to act nice, you know, or it's a female. She gets a little bit nicer, you know, and the whole time she's sitting there wishing you a happy thanksgiving. You just want to fucking kicker right in the box, you know? But you can't, you fucking can't.

Speaker 6:          01:30:35       Well, I was sad. What the fuck is it? It's one to one 1515 minutes left in the third period you don't, one of the hardest things to do I think is to be an announcer for hockey now that they took and taken out the red line, the fucking game. You'll break your neck sitting there watching the fucking game. That's why I like it watching it on TVs because I don't have to keep turning my head. The camera, the camera moves for me. It does all the work. What? I'm literally out of Shit to say, you know? I feel like right now the south bad, this podcast is when you bomb is a comedian is that works. When, when, when shit is going great, when everything you say is killing, when you're on stage, basically what happens is, is you've done about 20 minutes of material and you look down at your watch and you watch says you've been up there for 55 minutes.

Speaker 6:          01:31:20       That's when you know that you're fucking killing. And conversely, when you're bombing, you will do an hour's worth of material in 17 minutes and all you have left is your closing bit. And you look down at your watch and you realize that you've been on stage for just under 20 minutes and you're like, wow, now what the fuck am I doing? You know, your mouth gets dry. That's when you start going into the crowd. Hey is, you know, so what's there to do around here and a Raleigh, North Carolina. Look at this guy over here. Ah, what do you do sir? Oh, you're a plumber. Really? Oh, so a, I bet your butt crack is always shot. Fucking kill me. You know, then you just, you just fucked. Hey, how about a round of applause for the wait staff, you know, keep it going for him.

Speaker 6:          01:32:11       You know, and I just want to thank all you guys for showing up. I know it's a recession and I appreciate, uh, you know how bad I am for the tropes. You know, you know, whether you support going to war or not, you know, these kids are out there that laying down their lives and they're away from their families in thanksgivings this week. I think we should all sit back and give thanks and be appreciative that I've already done an hours worth of fucking jokes and you conserve and laughed at anything. So now I'm technically in overtime even though contractually I already, I owe you like another 40 minutes of fucking comedy, you know, and let's not forget all the people who have died in boating accidents this year. You know, a lot of people don't know that boating accidents is one of the leading, leading causes of death. When human beings are out in the ocean and you start remembering jokes from the early party, your act, and you start telling him, you know, yeah, they did a study the other day. They said, you know, 90% is shark attacks actually happened in shallow water. No Shit. That's where the people are. It's called the fucking beach. Oh yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:33:23       What are their people swimming to Europe? Let's go to France. You pussies. Ah, you like that joke. That's a joke for my act in 2001. I'm too fucking old jokes in my act. What else did I used to fucking do?

Speaker 10:         01:33:36       Okay,

Speaker 6:          01:33:37       I already did one of those. My original jokes. You guys see these uh, rap group criss cross warm it up, Chris. Warming up, Chris. Hey, go to bed. Chris. What do you like nine years old? Oh. Oh my God. I had horrible jokes.

Speaker 10:         01:33:55       Okay.

Speaker 6:          01:33:56       Easy jokes about working in a dental office. A people, I got news for you. Six years and neglect is not cured by a tic tac in the waiting room. Hey, you guys ready for your next deck? Too Bad. I still got another 30 minutes to do. Ladies back me up. Guys are crazy, right? I mean, you know, where are we? We don't give a shit that's going be just searching for shit to say what, but I'm, it's, it's great to be here in Raleigh. You know what I mean? It's guy, you know, you come out here to Raleigh, you know, they got a, he got a mall. All right folks, I'm not gonna lie to you. I'm out of jokes. I wish you could just do that and just fucking become honest. I'm, I'm out of fucking material. I don't know what the fuck you guys want from me. Come on. Tic, tic, tic, tic, tic, tic, tic, tic. All right, 41 minutes. Does that qualify as a podcast? Oh, I actually, you know, I forgot one story was supposed to be here. I think

Speaker 8:          01:34:58       I got one other question. This is a Phillips some time as I scroll down, what's up with scrolling? There's another when you won't do a full conclusive Haber with some old rolling on. All right, unacceptable. Here you go. Here's a classic example where somebody should just have used the phrase unacceptable and I really want to go into this bar with this guy. When there's a classic fuck over. Um, so bill, I show up to this local sports bar at 11:00 PM the night before my birthday by myself. While do, that's your fucking fault, you know?

Speaker 10:         01:35:30       Yeah.

Speaker 8:          01:35:30       I don't know what your problem is. Stop lashing out at the people around you right now. Look at me. I'm taking it out on you cause I'm out of material here and whatever the fuck it is, I've lost my stream of consciousness. Still one to one, by the way, with 12 minutes and 32 seconds to go. Hey, if anybody knows the name of the announcer for the, uh, the Sabres I'd love, I'd love to know the guy's name. I mean, I guess I could Google it, but I know when I do, there's going to be like fucking 58, you know, buffalo sabers.net backslash org. And I don't want to go through that shit. All right. So anyways, Bill, I show up to a local sports bar at 11:00 PM the night before my birthday by myself. All right. He goes, the bartender asked for my id, I give it to her, she hands it back and ask me what I would like. Now I'm not looking for comments, but you would, you would think the bartender would be aware of the date and time and have some snide remark about hanging out by myself. Um,

Speaker 10:         01:36:25       okay.

Speaker 8:          01:36:26       This close to my birthday.

Speaker 8:          01:36:29       Well, I think she's just trying to see or he's trying to see if you're of age and hunt. Right? I don't fucking know. Anyways. Uh, I'm not upset. I'm just expecting a stupid comment. So I ask, uh, what the specials are. She tells me that the large domestics are three bucks and well drinks or two bucks. I see they have blue moon on tap. I'm not a huge fan, but as 22 ounces of beer for three bucks, I'll suck it up. I order. She says, okay. And serves it. Fast forward to the bill, it seems a tad high and I see I was charged for 50 for each of the three beers. I ask about the bill and she said, oh, only domestics are $3. My reply was, blue moon is a domestic beer. It's made in America, and she says, no, domestics are Bud Miller and course. Now, wait a minute. I thought Blue Moon wasn't that made and fucking Belgium. Now I got to fucking look it up before I take your side here because I really want to be blue moon. All right. Blue Moon brewing company. All right, here we go. Let's see what we got here.

Speaker 8:          01:37:32       Oh, Jesus Christ. It's a whole fucking website isn't Blooma. It's not a Belgian beer date of birth. Enter.

Speaker 10:         01:37:42       Okay.

Speaker 8:          01:37:43       I have to give you a valid date of birth to read about beer. Are you fucking kidding me? All right, let's go to Wikipedia. God knows that's fucking accurate, right? A blue moon is a full moon. It's not what I want. Blue Moon bear. You fucking, no one gives a shit about space. Actually, I do. My brother's really in this space and I learned the other day I thought something was the north star. He's like, that's not in the north star. That's Jupiter. I don't get the fuck out of here. He goes, yeah. First of all, he goes, stars, twinkle planets reflect light. So ever since then I've been looking up at the sky and go on. That's a fucking planet. I want to know what that is and I want to go buy a telescope. But there's no way to buy telescope without looking like a fucking pervert. You know what I mean? That's yet another thing that pervert to fucking ruin the same way gay guys have ruined cowboy boots, cowboy hats, and foo man shoes. You can't fucking, you know, you can't wear any of that shit unless you're on a fucking ranch rustling of fucking cow to the Goddamn ground rules. People think you're out there blowing someone. Um,

Speaker 5:          01:38:50       okay.

Speaker 8:          01:38:50       All right. Blue Moon Beer. Let's see here. Blue Moon beer is Molson Coors brewing company.

Speaker 8:          01:38:59       All right, so Yaz fucking right, good. Now I can side with you because I really want to go off on this. So the fucking dude is ordering a domestic beer and she goes, no domestics or Bud Miller and cores. Two things. First, why couldn't she mentioned that Blue Moon is not considered a domestic beer when I ordered, but second, let's look at the bigger picture. I'm sure bill, you've run into this. You're told domestics are on sale for happy hour. So you order a Sam Adams. At which point you told Sam Adams this is considered a domestic beer. Well actually, um, you may have thought, yes, Sam Adams is a domestic beer. It was made by the blood of the American patriots. He had dumb cunt. I liked this guy. Uh, who made the decision? Who made the decision to call Shitty Beers? Domestic beer. What kind of a euphemism is that?

Speaker 8:          01:39:46       Whenever this happens in the future, I'm going to ask for a manager and tell them that not including all domestic beers with their domestic specials is unacceptable. Dude, you should just fucking said that unless this is actually made an a different company, a country and Molson Coors brewing just bought it. You guys want to hear about it? Blue Moon is a Belgian style wheat beer brewed by the Molson brewing company in Golden, Colorado. It's a fucking domestic beer was launched in 1995 in Canada is marketed as a similar beer called Rickard's white. Why do they not have blue moon's up there is blue moon offensive and it's brewed in Montreal, Quebec. All right, so some of it is brewed in another country. Is that they're out? Well then it should be called Rickard's white, right dude, bottom line is you got fucked. Yeah, that's what they should say. Our are cheap ass beers are a r three bucks and anything with any sort of hops and flavor in it is going to be for 50 they go, that's the big outrage of the week. This dude get fucked. All right. That's the end of my lackluster one. You know what I mean?

Speaker 6:          01:40:55       What the fuck do you guys want from me? I do one of these every fucking week. I'm running out of stories to tell you. I already did that. Gay Guy joked before. I've already done the fucking, I think I need to take a break. Just like the foo fighters. You know when they sold out Wembley Stadium, they sold it out twice and they were sitting around going, what the fuck else can we do? Just like when, uh, the Beatles sold out Shea stadium or the police sold out Shea stadium, that's when you just realized, well, the only way to go now is to go down. I think I've begun the backward slide. I'm sliding down the backside of a, of the podcast and I was actually thinking about that. How long am I going to do this podcast? You know, Oprah's retiring. She's calling it quits after 25 fucking years.

Speaker 4:          01:41:43       Okay.

Speaker 6:          01:41:44       I mean, I've basically done one episode every week for the past two and a half years or two years. Two months. So 52 weeks a year. That's 104 episodes plus like another 20 maybe move up to 125 episodes. All right. Back in the day, if you did a sitcom, you needed a hundred episodes to go into syndication. I'm in syndication right now,

Speaker 6:          01:42:07       so think about that shit. I'm like, if this was the drew Carey show, I would be in like the seventh season, you know when they've added the fat chick with the crazy makeup. Cause we're on a story ideas, you know. So my question to you is how, how much longer should I do this? When do I bow out gracefully and come out with a new, a new form of a, what do they call this shit on the Internet? Huh? Viral. Do I, do I take it to the next level? I do a video. Maybe I'll do a video podcast next and I'll do like, I'll, I'll have puppets now, right? I'll have the cont puppet. Right. What'd you just be sorta some twice shape tortilla with a red lips on it, you know, that can talk and uh, whatever. I'm, I'm just sort of brainstorming here and a fucking, I'll puppets a creepy, you know, you ever go back and watch Mr. RogersRogers' and just see how creepy those fucking puppets are. You know why? Cause their mouse did move king Friday.

Speaker 4:          01:43:10       Yeah.

Speaker 11:         01:43:10       Hello Lady McMullen.

Speaker 6:          01:43:15       My name is much think I'm out of my fucking mind. I actually did it in the living room this week. You know, that's why I had the Nice Carnegie Hall sort of, Ah, acoustics in here. All my dog fucking walked out on me. You don't have really think my dog finds me annoying. You know, my practice, my guitar, she has a habit of going, gives me like a big fucking exhale. And if I'm practicing anything up high, like I was trying to learn how to play the beginning of, for those about to rock, we salute you, which is way up on the neck of the guitar. And I was trying to play it the way Angus plays it, which is a combination, a using a pick

Speaker 8:          01:43:52       and plucking with two other fingers. So needless to say, it sounded like somebody was choking a sparrow. And, uh, my dog, you know, she sort of got, you know, just lifted her head up and sort of looked at me and I laughed because I knew I was bugging her. And then I was so focused on trying to be able to play this for some stupid fucking reason. And, uh, when I came out of my fucking comatose state, I looked and the dog had left. So, uh, I don't know what the point of that was. You know what the point was? The point was to somehow get to 50 minutes because um, if I don't do it for 50 minutes, then I can't continue to, to not get paid for this. Um, let's hype my website, [inaudible] Dot com I'm once again go there and a fucking, I dunno, go to my show in Cleveland or go to my show at Sacramento.

Speaker 8:          01:44:43       It was in a, in a, the punchline is Sacramento. There's the next two weeks I have coming up and a or come on out and watch my live taping. Oh, somebody asked me a question and they're like, which one of the two shows are being taped that night? Are both of them being taped? And if you take both, will you combine both and make one special? Yes. Okay. Yes I will. That's what happens. You take both of them and if I just have one set that's just fucking awesome and I loved it. Wire to wire, which I hope is going to happen. I'll just take that cause I'm, I'm really big into a, you know, not creating a performance that didn't happen. Um, my CD is all one show. Why do I do this? We only did, we only taped one show, so that's all one show.

Speaker 8:          01:45:28       Uh, my HBO special, we did too. And I forget which one joke is from the first show and the rest was all from the second show. It's so it's basically one performance and um, yeah, so that's what I'm hoping for. So yes. If you're wondering, yes, both shows will be taped and um, this is what you basically hope for. What you do is you go out and you fucking rock on the first one. See like, all right, I've got a great special already and then you can just totally relax and fuck around on the second one. You know, kind of the way you, you know, you get into like your head, like you just in a club rather than, than doing a special, that's where you want to be. Um, and that's what I want to try to hope to do. So that's it. I need to rest my voice. I hope everybody has a wonderful thanksgiving. I would have played a Thanksgiving song on my guitar, but uh, none of them exist. There aren't any thanksgiving songs. And I'd like saying Shit like that cause there's always a,

Speaker 12:         01:46:25       actually there is one. The Lawrence Welk Orchestra did. Why nobody gives a fuck. There's none. There's no

It divided the family in half and it would always be sleeting and raining and uh, we would end up getting into huge fights. Like, fuck you, fuck you fist fights. And, uh, it was really bizarre. And then we'd sit down, we'd all be fucking soaking wet, you know, grass stains and, uh, that the food was great. You know, still one of my favorite days. Thanksgiving music.
