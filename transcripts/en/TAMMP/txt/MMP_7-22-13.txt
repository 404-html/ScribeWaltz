Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's the Monday morning podcast from Monday, July 22nd, 2013 off we go into the wild blue yonder. Ah, fuck. I gave a bunch of shit to do today. People just like you. Even my Mondays are busy. I actually got a lot of shit out of the way already. I walk my dog around the block. It took a shit. I picked it up in a bag. All right, I like that Rappaport fella. I picked it up right and I put it in somebody's barrel. Somebody else's barrel, which is the right thing slash douchey thing to do. The ultimate neighborly thing is you pick it up and you hold on to a t, get back to your own trashcan and then you put it in there. That right there. That is a class act. All right. Then you have tier two you have me, well at least he picked it up, but then the con threw it in my trash barrel. I can argue, well, hey, you know, to trash barrel, what are you worried that it's just going to smell like rotting garbage is the shit smell really going to ruin it? But I understand as a principal it's your dog, it's your shit. Um, you know, and you have the last one is that people just don't pick it up. But anyways,

Speaker 1:          00:01:24       anyways, people have been breaking into cars and my neighborhood, man, it's fucking him. Every once in a while like this, they'll come by here for a while, then they leave. La is really a weird city where it's like you live in a place in one night it's safe and then the next night it isn't. You know, there's the general vibe and then there's also like the fucking rule, that aspect of living in Los Angeles. So I think they come by, they fuck with cars because it's the same people, right? It's five of them, five people running the world and there's five people breaking all the windows and stealing shit in this car. I'm convinced of it. All right. I have, I have, I have information that can back that up. If you want it, I'll give it to you. But I would appreciate it if you've been listening to my podcast long enough that you would just take me at my own with my word actually means something to you, you know? Um, anyways, I've been breaking in these fucking cars and uh, uh, it's just annoying. I told you they had me last time. They fucking, there was nothing in my car. And then they took all my quarters as little Satchel, a quarters for the parking meters because I still don't want to use my credit card because I don't want to tell people where the fuck I am. You know?

Speaker 1:          00:02:35       Well, she, according to your, your, you're a fucking parking meter records. You, you were there sir. And I know what right now do it. They can just track you with your cell phone Yan. Um, maybe they can.

Speaker 2:          00:02:48       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:02:50       But I could say, well, I lost my cell phone. Someone else had it right. I could come around with it, but if he fucking down can say, somebody stole my credit card. I Dunno. I don't like people watching me all the fucking time. You know, you know what kills me is the amount of people that actually are happy. Snowden did what he did and there's nobody any, anywhere in media with any sort of a fucking job that pays any decent amount of money that is open in their fucking miles. Everybody's keeping quiet.

Speaker 2:          00:03:19       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:03:19       Good for you. Snow. Keep running. You could stay at my house if you want to hang out until you know, blows over, you know, sit around, eat some TV. Hey, you know what I did this week, everybody? I uh, I went out and I bought the, the body issue, the naked issue. The nude issue of ESPN. Why? Cause I'm a pervert. Yes. Why? Because I always liked the 40 niners but wanted to see their quarterback completely naked in the, on some lava rocks. Absolutely. You got me?

Speaker 2:          00:03:53       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:54       I can't remember how many times last year when I was watching a 49 nighters gain. You know, this call of Kaepernick, I'll tell you, he's entertaining to watch, but you know, it'd be more entertaining if somehow he would get down on all fours on some fucking lava rocks. Like he's going to, uh, do a hundred yard dash into the ocean. That's what I would really like. No. You know why I bought it because somebody told me Gary player was on the cover. That's what I was told. Am I Gary Player? Isn't that guy like fucking a hundred years old. They're like, no, he's like 77,

Speaker 2:          00:04:26       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:04:28       and I go, he's an unbelievable shape. You know me, I'm obsessed with not becoming a fat fuck.

Speaker 2:          00:04:34       Right.

Speaker 1:          00:04:35       Fat People call that having a body issue, you know, cause they didn't want to stop eating the jelly and Ritz crackers late at night, you know, that they stuffed into ice cream. You know what's funny is as mean as I am to fat people, I've slowly begun to win according to this guy last week. And I'll take Kim is, is like every fat person who listens to this. I'm beginning to shame people into losing weight. And I think that that would be a great show.

Speaker 1:          00:05:00       It would be just like biggest loser as far as the amount of yelling, but it wouldn't be as motivational. Oh, it'd be like the opposite. And then it would cause a controversy and then there would be people doing that split screen on TV. You know, you got the host and then he got the two people like, uh, you know, what, what, what do you think a person I've never heard of before or I think it's great. You know, I think these fat, Fuck Charlotte's both types. Nobody called him a fat fuck. What do you think about a female person who of course you have to have the motherly side of this? Well, I just think that people have to understand that it's a food addiction. This negative reinforced is we're seeing this in schools with by, Oh fuck you lady. Okay. I think you'd go out with a couple of pounds still.

Speaker 1:          00:05:45       Hey, let's try to keep it nice. So I, let's try it. Like the fucking house who's exploring the whole problem can then sit there rubbing his chin, shaking his head. You know? I mean, you know, it's funny. All three of them in that moment, they're all getting paid. They're all making money off of the Lard that's in the ashes of so many people these days. And I, I like to think that that's the true Tao a tragedy. You know, I like to think right now that I'm thinking outside the box, the ice box, I guess. I guess you would call it. What's the deal? Um, so I got the body issue and uh, you know what bugged me? It w this fucking trend, like the fucking tattoos

Speaker 2:          00:06:30       mmm.

Speaker 1:          00:06:32       That people have in order. It is in particular, what is it in particular bill? I don't like people who write fucking inspirational shit on them

Speaker 2:          00:06:39       body, like, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:06:44       and they always have it in a place, you know, they don't always, but for a lot of times they have it in a fucking place where only I can really get a good look at it. So there's no way for me not to take that is like, what do you think I'm a fucking moron? Like you have life all figured out

Speaker 2:          00:06:59       that, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:07:00       you gotta write this shit on your body, where the hell is it? What the hell is this fucking person who was this fucking Golfer? Beautiful woman, right in like a 1950s kind of way. You know, little houses, then they're all made out of Ticky tacky and we fucked missionary only to have more kids.

After I assassinated or imprisoned or pistol whipped every fucking bank or I could find, I would then be like, all right, you have two options. You either get that fucking thing removed, all right? Or you never wear shorts again. You're allowed to wear your underwears when you walk around your apartment, but that's it. Other than that, go fuck yourself. Look at these fucking people. Every new beginning comes from some other beginnings and, oh Geez. Wow, wow. I never looked at it that way. Thank God you wrote that on your rib cage. Would you like another fuzzy navel?

Speaker 1:          00:13:30       Oh my God, this girl's got an entire story but not a back.

Speaker 2:          00:13:34       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:34       I just love this passage and I always wanted to have it written on my back. All right, the shoulder blade tattoo. What does she got here? What does this one say? That was a lot of women with the shit written on their backs and different languages. All right, here's to me, here's to you and here's to life and laughter. I'll be true as long as you and not a single moment after Jesus Christ.

Speaker 2:          00:14:03       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:14:03       What in in it literally looks like she wrote it on her back and had someone else fill it, fill it in. He used to me, here's, yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:14:12       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:12       Love never fails. All right. This guy's getting written on both forearms. I listened to the, I listened to the Bray of my heart. I am. I am. I am. Oh my God, Dude. These are like, you know, the thing I like about this shit that they write it on their bodies is, that's just a great thing to read during your, during a first date. All right? Here's the one for you. If you, if you meet a girl with a foot tattoos, like you got to go in another direction, right? There's nothing uglier than a foot tattoo. They just did. You just, I don't understand. I don't understand. You know what? I'm sure there's a lot of you guys out to probably most of you at this point have tattoos, right?

Speaker 4:          00:15:00       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:15:02       at what point are those things going to go out of style?

Speaker 3:          00:15:06       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:15:07       Has this podcast just completely lost momentum? I feel like Lenny Bruce, when he fucking just kept reading his, uh, his court cases, I really got way to enter that tattoo. I just fuck it. I'm not enough. I am enough. Every fucking athlete, that's stupid issues. Got some big dumb ass piece on their back and their shoulders. And you know what I gotta be honest with you. It all looks the same bunch of squiggly squibs scrabbly dues is always a or a fucking dragon in there.

Speaker 4:          00:15:37       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:15:39       the fuck is wrong with you. Everybody else has what? I want one too. It's one of the greatest things I ever did was I never got a fucking tattoo it back. You know, it's funny, back when, uh, when I was, when I was just the lad and he got tattoos people, it was the tail end of getting like cartoon characters like just about four inches away from your Dick. You know, we get it like you, I remember there was a guy had you sent him, he, Sam with the two guns and said back off and it was just to the right of his package. You know, I knew another guy, he got the fucking Budweiser label. That's what you got.

Speaker 4:          00:16:18       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:16:20       he didn't sit there and have to be like fucking

Speaker 3:          00:16:23       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:16:23       You know, a stitch in time saves the sorcerer who gets up early and catches the worm. Yeah. A bunch of fucking constant. You know what, keep getting your tattoos. I like it. You know, it's branding you as someone not worthy of talking to um, give you guys do that for me this weekend. Can you walk around when you see people who have those and when you just read them, just point at them like you're in that version of the body. Snatcher and just go, oh

Speaker 5:          00:16:48       yeah. Damn.

Speaker 1:          00:16:50       And then fucking walk away. No, don't do that. Don't you know what? Don't even listen to me. Um, all right, the fuck was I going to talk about this? Like, oh, guess what I did this week. Oh, freckle face bill. Guess what I did, you know, a year ago I wrote a fucking motorcycle or whatever. I went dirt bike riding. I actually took a motorcycle safety course. It was a, it was a day and a half and I got to tell you, man, it was fucking a exhilarating and terrifying. So I actually, I passed the class somehow. I don't think I should have, I was doing my little youth turns. They had to put my little foot down there.

Speaker 5:          00:17:30       Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:17:31       um, no, it was a great fucking time sell. Basically how it worked was you rode for like four hours and then he had a class.

Speaker 4:          00:17:40       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:17:42       I realized how spoiled I am as a fucking human being, you know, just having this, the life that I have where I don't have boss and I basically do whatever the fuck I want. I have not been in a classroom.

Speaker 4:          00:17:53       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:17:55       I just immediately, I just takes me back to why I chose the route I chose. I just never liked the classroom situation, but this, this was a, was actually a great time, but it just immediately had anxiety and I'm like half paying attention and then, and then in the end they're like, okay, now we're going to do the test. I went right back to when I was like in eighth grade. And I got got, I'm going to fail this. And the guy's like, no one has ever failed this. And you're like, oh, good pressure pressure. I'm a moron. Was sitting at the table and everybody's fucking finishing. Before I was like, there was like, I don't know, 40 people in the class. I think I finished 37th as far as completing the test. Um, I don't know. It's 50 questions I got for run. It's like something like that. How fucking though? But somehow I passed and um,

Speaker 4:          00:18:44       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:18:44       That was funny. I've never flipped flopped so much of my life on a decision. I was thinking, am I going to get a bike? Should I just get a dirt bike? Should I just know how to do this? And then, you know,

Speaker 4:          00:18:54       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:18:55       I just wanted to learn how to ride a motorcycle. You know, I grew up in the 80s. All right. I watched a lot of action movies and one of the things that I always was envious of the Action Heroes Aside from their oiled up fucking eighties lifting weights, no squats ever bodies, was

Speaker 4:          00:19:12       uh,

Speaker 1:          00:19:14       the fact that no matter what vehicle they approached, not only with the keys always in it, they knew how to drive it. They knew how to drive everything from a dump truck to a fucking helicopter airplane. They could sail, they could fucking do anything. So, you know, it's coming up where, you know, we got to raise the debt ceiling again. Eventually the wave's going to hit the beach and there's going to be a period where you could quite possibly be getting chased down the street by an angry we fucking mob is, is this, everything goes to shit, you know? So at that point it would be nice if you had the ability to, whatever escape vehicle you meet you ran into, you could actually just jump in and just be all right with it. Right. Sylvester Stallone, fucking, uh, Arnold Schwartzenegger, Steven Seagal, Chuck Norris. They never it, I challenge you to find anything that they fucking ran up to when any of those movies that day did not a jet ski fucking motor boat, sailboat, submarine, combine helicopter fucking plane with, with only can land on water. Those skis or the tires doesn't make a difference. They could instrument rated they everything.

Speaker 4:          00:20:36       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:20:37       Everything. They could be on a fucking plane, a commercial airline, and somehow kill the person next to him, put a hat over their face without anybody noticing, crawl down where the luggages and then jump off the landing gear and do a fucking mash at the end of the, the, the, the runway. They were unstoppable. So I've added motorcycle. All right. I could drive a car stick or regular and now I can drive a motorcycle. I'm just checking off the list. I have a day and a half of experience. No, it's actually really fascinating and it made me a better driver and I actually have a much more appreciation of, uh,

Speaker 3:          00:21:20       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:21:20       Of this skill it takes to ride a motorcycle. It's not like a car. Yeah, no shit bill now, but just shit that you wouldn't think.

Speaker 3:          00:21:28       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:21:28       Like I didn't, I didn't understand all that went into just going around a turn on a motorcycle and out. Not only do you hit the, do not hit the break, but if you hit the brake, you're actually gonna you know

Speaker 1:          00:21:39       you're going to crash. You gotta judge to look through the whole turn, judge you speed and then fucking power your way through it. Um, pretty good tense. I got not going to lie to you. I'm not gonna act like I was, eh, got this. This is easy that we were going into the class and like has anybody seen it? And I'm getting excited like wow. Then I just wrote a bike for four hours. I've got it up to third gear down and this is fucking great. And then I went into the class and one of the things, you know, the group discussion there was like anybody ever see a motorcycle accident or been in a motorcycle accident? It's like fucking almost everybody, or at least half the class puts their hands up and they start telling stories in this one guys was like a paramedic and he's going like, Yay. You know, I saw this guy was going like 90, he hit a car head on and his heart came out of his chest. He had like all these stories and I was sitting there, I'm like,

Speaker 3:          00:22:33       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:22:34       like laughing at myself going, what the fuck am I signing up for here? This is insane. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:22:41       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:22:41       And then like the guy who was teaching the class who looked like he was born on a motorcycle and was fucking, you know, wrote the same way it was. You know, obviously he's the instructor, he's fucking great. Ryan bikes. He even had a story of a couple months ago. Yeah. You know, I hit some sand and I was like singing, oh, I'm going over the fucking handle bars and I'm like, keep my body relax. And all I'm thinking in my head is just like, dude, you went down, you went down.

Speaker 3:          00:23:04       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:23:05       Right. This guy, I'm telling you, it just looked like he was just made the ride a fucking, we just had that I ride a motorcycle look, as opposed to me who looks like some do. She goes to take a safety course and I'm just thinking this guy went down, this guy's an EMT talking about people's hearts coming out of their chest. I'm just like, what? This is fucking stupid.

Speaker 3:          00:23:22       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:22       You know? So, uh,

Speaker 3:          00:23:26       okay

Speaker 1:          00:23:26       on, I don't know where I'm at. I think I'm just going to maybe just right on dark is what I'll do. You can't, you can't fuck or ride a bike out here in la. You know what it is? I'm old enough to know it's fucking stupid. So, uh, I think I'm going to, if I'm going to do it, I just get like a dirt bike and I put it in the back of my truck, drive out of the city and all the people texting, get to where the trailers and then just ride around on dirt. And I know all you constantly be like, yeah,

Speaker 6:          00:23:52       actually [inaudible] PTLD Jap in off road people, not PA. Could you,

Speaker 1:          00:23:57       I know I just stand this risk with everything, but uh, you know, I dunno. I, I think it's a good thing that I waited till I was 45 to learn how to ride a motorcycle because if I was thinking if I was 21 and I would just, I wouldn't give a shit ass. I can happen to me. And that's not going to happen to me. Like you get older and by the time you're, my age, shit has happened to you or some close friends. So you kind of like, yeah. You know, that could happen to me. Kind of like my heart in my chest on this side of my rib cage. Uh, but I got to tell you though, I definitely got the bug and

Speaker 3:          00:24:34       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:24:35       It's the most fucking fun.

Speaker 3:          00:24:38       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:24:39       I even by the second day I was actually getting frustrated because I was thinking like, I just want to take this out on the street. I'm sick of speeding up and slowing down. I just want to drive this fucking thing. And uh,

Speaker 3:          00:24:53       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:24:53       I Dunno. Don't worry. I'm not going to go out and do that. I'm not gonna do that dumb shit. This is exactly what a lot of people do when they, when they finally get to where they want to be in life, which is what I feel I am, you know, selling the tickets as a comic, get some acting gigs every once in a while. You know, you got a little free time. What do you do? You pull a John Denver, you go out and get a pilot's license yet out you fly some experimental aircraft and next thing you know they're the news today. Singer songwriter. All right. So that's definitely in the back of my head. But um,

Speaker 3:          00:25:29       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:25:29       I dunno, I don't think nick is going to let me get one anyways, to be honest with you. That's probably a good thing. But you know what she did when she was saying no, she did the classic thing like why do you want to like, you know, have all these toys. What is it with guys and have, you know, you have your, and like, what do I have? I go, I get my truck. She goes, you get your guitars and it's like, you're upset with me cause I'm a joint life. And she's like, no, you know, I think she just doesn't want me to get one. So she tried to do that stupid argument that the motorcycle was this extension. Like it's like you, Dick, like you, you guys like it's between their legs and they have ride this thing down the street. It's just like, I dunno what the fuck that is about.

Speaker 3:          00:26:10       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:26:10       When I was riding for the last two days, at no point was I thinking about my dick other than thinking like, I hope I don't fall off and, uh, when I'm going fast enough that I get road rash on my leg,

Speaker 6:          00:26:21       Dick,

Speaker 1:          00:26:24       that would be the only thing. Other than that, you know what, I wish, I wish she took the class with me. You know? That's what I was actually think it'd be great if she took the fucking class with me and she would just see how much fun it is. It's fun.

Speaker 3:          00:26:36       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:26:37       You know, I don't know. Fuck it. No. So, uh, I got the bug now. I The bug and I was looking at motorcycles all last night, so I was telling her, I said, look, all I want to do, I'm just going to get like the Honda rebel. It's a fucking two 50. It's exactly what I should get when I start out. If I get something else up, kill myself. And she starts, you know, looking up those stupid Ducati's, which were cool about up until six months ago. And now every Douche bag out there has him. Like everybody seems to have one of those fucking things. So,

Speaker 4:          00:27:05       you know, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:27:07       And I looked at the new Harley's and I don't like them. I think they're ugly. They kind of lost their way. They lose used to look meaner. So I'm just going to, if I'm going to get one, I'm either going to get dark bike or I'm going to get this little fucking two 50. I think the speedometer only goes up to like 70 or 80.

Speaker 4:          00:27:23       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:27:25       I Dunno. Tell me, what do you, what do you guys think? And this is, and this is going to be one of those extreme,

Speaker 4:          00:27:30       uh,

Speaker 1:          00:27:31       conversations. And believe me, I've heard all the things get a motorcycle, you might as well buy the coffin to go with it. It's not a helmet, it's a brain bucket. I've heard all of that shit.

Speaker 4:          00:27:41       Um, I dunno.

Speaker 1:          00:27:46       Just dot. It does seem like a lot of fun.

Speaker 4:          00:27:49       Right.

Speaker 1:          00:27:50       You know, if I, if I get one, I'm going to be one of those douchebags who gets like a little two 50 and I'll have like all the gear on and be dressed like all Samuelson. If he ever rode a motorcycle, flipped completely over, protected fucking Robo cop suit on it and I just ride around my neighborhood, never, never get out of second gear. Um, anyway, so that's what the fuck I did with my week. But, you know, it's good to know though, if I ever get chased by a bunch of people with hatchets down the street and I happened upon a fucking motorcycle and there's a little key there provided it's not an old one with the throttles on the other side or the shift or whatever the fuck it is. Uh, I'll be able to, I'll be able to escape, you know?

Speaker 4:          00:28:31       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:28:32       All right. I know what the fuck I'm talking about. Okay, everybody, it's time for a little bit of advertising. I know this is your favorite part of the week.

Tim Tivo before Tivo watching TV was weirdly hard. You could only watch a show at a certain time and if you missed it or even part of it, you literally had to wait for it to go into reruns before you could see it again. I could vouch for that. I am an old man. Tivo totally changed all of that. And while other dvrs exist, they are not as sick. Alicia says Tivo because if you have cable, Tivo lets you watch your shows wherever you want.

Speaker 1:          00:30:26       With Tivo stream.

Only Tivo searches both cable and web to find any movie, any show, any video at the press of the button, you hear that both cable and the web. That's what sets him apart. Netflix, Netflix, Amazon, Youtube. Uh, now those are just like more channels on your TV. Oh Wow. You can look at all of that. That's amazing. And what the Tivo mini one Tivo box works on a second TV from the couch to the kitchen from the minivan to 35,000 feet up in an airplane. Tivo makes TV about a thousand. Time's better. Um, there you go.

Speaker 1:          00:31:17       Alrighty. Thank Bang. That was easy, wasn't it? All right, let's get back to this. So anyway, so I'm looking at the body issue here and uh, I'm telling you to get inspired. Gary player. The guy is like 77 years old. I forget what he's it, five, seven ways of buck 55. He's like it his high school way. There he is. Here he is who he is. Golfer Pga tour winner achievement award winner. He's five, seven 150 pounds. Um, I got to read this quote that he didn't have to have tattooed on his tattoo lists body here. You said a great man in India said to me, Mr. Player, the less you eat, the longer you live in western society, it's each eat plenty and die young. I'm 70% vegetarian this morning. I didn't have any fats. No Bacon, no sausage, no butter. But I'm a normal human being.

Speaker 1:          00:32:08       I have a snickers if I want one. I'm not a martyr now my duty, you can't if that's not something too buyer to, you know, last time I was at one 50, I was in fucking, I mean I'm taller than the guy, but what was the guys at his high school weight? You know, you can still fit into his fucking Tuxedo that he wore back in. Uh, when he danced the Benny Goodman, you know, you know what's funny about that? Vegetarian Shit. You always fight it, right? You sit there, you got to have some meat. You got to Blahblahblahblahblah. But I got to tell you, do you need a giant salad? Every day you're going to be right as rain. You can eat a steak and afterwards you can feel like you have a fucking shoe and your stomach, you got to take a nap. You know, your body shuts down if you have red meat and potatoes, right? You know, God damn well, you got to take a nap. You literally have to fucking sleep it off. You know, you never have to sleep off the salad people. Uh, that's what I've learned as I've gotten older too. I got to stop fighting it. You know, I want the meat eaters to be right. Does that make sense?

Speaker 3:          00:33:15       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:33:16       Who wants to eat a fucking stunt? You want cheeseburgers and fries to be the right way to go? Of course you do. But I'm telling you, uh, oh, did I mention I finally ate a tomato out of my garden, my little modest garden. Dude, I got to tell you, it was one of the most fucking unbelievable experiences of my life.

Speaker 1:          00:33:34       It was, it was like, I don't, I don't know what the fuck I was eating for the first 45 years of my life. Um, I've got to tell you, don't do it if you want. Don't, this is great. I got tomatoes growing right out in front of my house, cucumbers and peppers. I'm on my way. I'm gonna have a bunch of fucking veggies growing out there. I know how to ride a motorcycle, right? So I'll just have a bag of veggies. Always ready to go. That's, that's my, uh, that's my game plan. But the other thing is, is if anybody on my block knows my game plan, if they listened to this, then I'll let it going to do. It was just still my vegetables. Right. And puts some piano wire across the street and that's going to be the enemy, you know?

Speaker 3:          00:34:19       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:34:20       Wouldn't that make sense? Oh, here you go. I just got a text message answering a question. I would have this tattooed on my body.

Speaker 1:          00:34:29       Hang on a second. I've been playing a lot of drums lately, everybody and I've been fucking with that Zeppelin Song in my time at dying and I never know how to count it to count it in for that Barbara Barrett do you don't, when he starts off, when the fucking drums come in, I never, I I can't fucking do, I knew, I kind of thought it was maybe in four, four. So I got the answer here to all you dramas out here. This is coming from a professional drummer. It's in four four. If you mean the big Tom hits, which I do, they are one what? They are one and have one and have to get the fuck. So it's one end. And is it, I thought it was convinced the guitar riff that opens the song starts off on the end of four. Ah, that's what it is and one and two and three. Okay. Ah, okay. You motherfuckers see that's the thing I loved about Zeppelin is they always did that little tricky shit.

Speaker 3:          00:35:35       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:35:35       So that Dan, Anna, Anna, it starts on the and to four and then know. Okay. All right. Was that the most boring thing ever to hear me trying to figure that shit out?

Speaker 4:          00:35:44       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:35:46       All right. What the hell was I talking about? Oh, hey, I owe, I owe a major fucking apology last week. You know, I have the apologies every week. So last week I was talking about, uh, I got to get his fucking name here. The Guy who won Wimbledon, let me, let me look this here. When we'll do the 2013 something Marie, right? What's his name? He, Andy Murray. And I said, hey, for the first time ever, congratulations. The first time ever an English guy, when the fuck in, uh, the Wimbledon, turns out the guy was Scottish. So right there I gave Andy Murray is props and instead of calling, but then I called them English, which is a classic example of what

Speaker 1:          00:36:31       that is. Some cold lotion. I wanna hear somebody sent me some audio that with the fucking Scottish accent, I apologize to everybody in Scotland. People of Scotland can't stand English people, you know. Actually, most people in Ireland can't stand him either. They're not, they're not a very well liked group of people. And you know why people just hating on him, you know, just hating on him. I'll fucking successful. They are with their kingdom, right? Great Britain, the English Empire, the guy, you know, something, they are like a franchise that got bought out. You know, like, remember back in the day, there was Kinko's everywhere you went. You know what? Oh wait, blockbuster feel like the blockbuster video of fucking empires actually, every empire is after a while. You just get bought out by something else. And I would say that, uh, our empire, the United States were like blockbuster in like 2006. You know, you see the writing on the wall. Um, so that's it right there. You can't be a tub of shit. It's coming to an end here. People. Something's going to fucking happen. All right? So you got to get your ass in shape. You've got to start growing tomatoes and he got to learn how to drive, ride sale, any fucking thing that's out there. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:37:47       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37:49       Uh, I'm a fucking moron. I don't have anything to talk about this week. People, I'm not going to lie to you. I got nothing. Okay. Usually I talk about sports. This, oh, I know what I can talk about in the wonderful wide world of sports. Did anybody see Nellie going off on Coby or discussing Coby? Huh?

Speaker 1:          00:38:08       That's why I finally, I feel vindicated. Somebody else's seeing it. He's talking about dove white. Howard, Doug White. Howard leaving, going. Maybe he doesn't want to play with Colby. And you know, it's so funny, Steven A. Smith is sitting there going, blasphemy. Blasphemy as as he's as Nelly is credit has the audacity to criticize Coby Brian. That's why I love Stephen A. Smith cause that's the funniest thing. And he's saying blasphemy like Nellie is talking about the son of God. That's how blinded Stephen A. Smith is about criticizing Koby Bryant because of his friendship with that guy and protecting his interview. Stephen A. Smith. I know you can't say it. Come on. Come on man. You know, you know the deal. Koby Bryant, they're the, in the history of NBA basketball. There's never been another guy who's gotten more help getting five championships that Coby Bryan. All right. The same way the Celtics piled on in 2008 and the Miami Heat the last couple of years. Koby Bryant every year he's on a team like that. And I'm talking to my buddy Jason Lawhead this say and Lebron. The rumor is he's going to opt out. So as Carmelo Anthony and they're both going to go to la, how much more fucking help does this guy need?

Speaker 1:          00:39:28       Unfucking believable, but like Steven A. Smith, can you ever address this? If you, somehow somebody sends this to you because I am a huge fan. All right. Explain this to me at the risk of you saying blast for me as I say this, how a player like Coby Bryant can walk off the court twice this year during horrific losses, walk off on his own team. You tell me how that does not breed resentment in the locker room. All right? And how doing shit like that all year does not end up with your fucking star center saying, I'm leaving. All right. And I'm not saying that, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:40:06       Mr. Howard didn't fucking fall short. All right. I just hate saying delight. It's Dwight Dwight Howard, Doh white. Spell it. D U H white. All right. Um, I dunno. All Dwight Howard has dudes just steal a couple of moves from a keen and a couple moves from Kevin Mchale and he's going to be fucking unstoppable. And he had a look on his face, like maybe he was going to commit to doing that for at least four days before. He's going to have that silly grin. Look how pretty I am and look how big my arms are. I don't give a shit anymore that he brings to the court every night.

Speaker 1:          00:40:40       Do you realize if you include Steven A. Smith that I just criticized about 40 foot of a human being? You understand that that could all kick my ass. I don't know about Steven A. Smith. I think I could take them to the ground, choke them out with his tie. Who knows? Blasphemy, blasphemy. But uh, that's one of the youtube videos of the week. You got to see that. And then I also have a great, uh, I was watching the NHL network this weekend. A NHL network underrated. They, they just, you know what they did? They just, Oh, you know, they just showed every islanders clinching game during their, their four year dynasty that they had from 80 to 83. And, uh, I got this great clip after the boot. Who did they beat? They beat the north stars I think in 1980. Uh, when Nystrom had that overtime goal, fucking unbelievable pass to. And uh, one of the Sutter brothers had just been called up

Speaker 1:          00:41:35       from the minus and they interview them and it's just like, it's just what's the most unsafe, smooth ending to an interview. It's a, the name of the youtube videos is good luck. We'll have that up there for you to, uh, and with that, I've, I babbled enough here. Let me, uh, let me read a little fucking ad here and then we'll get into the questions for the week. Sound good? Well, you don't have a choice cause that's how it was going down. All right. Do all a shave club everybody. All right. This is why I like dollar Shave Club because for years I've been complaining about why do they treat like disposable razor blades like the gold bullions. You know? For some reason it's like 40 bucks for a pack. They got up behind glass. You got to find somebody with the key. You know the the reason why you know why people steal them, it's because they're horrifically overpriced.

Speaker 1:          00:42:21       Wouldn't it be nice if someone was doing something about that while I give you dollar shave club? All right. Dollar Shave Club. It's a cool brand and they send you these quality radio written radios, razors right to your door every month. You don't have to think about it. You don't have to wait in line, get someone to unlock the key. Then from the cage, like I was just saying, and pay way too much money for a bunch of features that don't even fit on your old handle. Shaving has become such a mess, but not with dollar shave club. You know what, I'm part of this now. It saves me time and it saves me money and the razors are great. They're just as good as any of that crap behind the glass, you know, except you don't have to go out and get it. If you want to try it, go to dollar shave club.com forward slash burr support the show. Got a dollar shave club.com forward slash [inaudible] or click on the dollar shave shave banner on the podcast page at [inaudible] dot com once a month, they're going to bring you your blades. You don't even have to think about it. You throw out the old ones. Did He have a nice smooth shave all month? You don't pay too much for it. Give it a shot. All right. God bless you and God bless the United States of America. Okay, let's get to the questions for this week. If I could find them.

Speaker 1:          00:43:31       Oh Christ, what did I do now? What did I do? Oh, it was great. I was talking, I wasn't stuttering this week. I've been reading copy, you know, I feel like Mike, my copyright has been good this week. All right. Okay. Water a day. Bill. This is in reference to your podcast and the consumption of water. I fell off working. I fell off working out when I was working out. What, what do you guys do this to me? I fell off working out, but when I was working out regularly, I easy was drinking a gallon and a half of water a day, sometimes two,

Speaker 1:          00:44:06       two gallons. Someone questioned, questioned me on this, so I started to do research and basically that's nowhere close to the limit. Humans can consump I've consume I think 10 liters a day safely. Is that what you think, dude? You can die drinking too much water like people, please don't go out and drink two gallons straight. All right. Uh, he says thanks for the three comedy by the, that's what the reverse of Colt Lotion. Thanks for, for the free comedy. By the way. What's the reverse of cold lotion like when you get a podcast out late Monday or Tuesday? Yeah, we didn't get the podcasts on Monday because what Tuesdays mornings we're going to have one. Um, you guys would just never get beyond the fact that the Monday morning podcast. It's my Monday morning. It's 9:44 AM Monday morning. I'm recording this. Okay. All right. I'm just like you guys. I see it in my world.

Speaker 1:          00:45:01       It's my Monday morning, not yours. Go fuck yourselves. Um, you know what's funny is this guy sitting there like thrown out stats here and then in the end he goes, um, humans can consume like, I think 10 liters a day safely. So anybody listening to this don't drink like I think 10 liters a day. Find out how many he can have an over what amount of, of what period. You know, look, you can have 30 drinks in a month, but if you drink them right in a row, you know, I don't think that's a good fucking thing. So there's gotta be a way to s to space it out. Right. And a fucking though. All right. All right. The truth behind Jimmy's last week I was talking about Jimmy's and I heard it was racist. The reason why, you know, so you call them sprinkles or something like up in Boston at the reason why they call them jimmies.

Speaker 1:          00:45:52       That was a reference to Jim Crow. A look, got a couple of Jimmy's over the air. And then a lot of the sprinkles being chocolate and color, it didn't translate it over. And this guy saying that I am wrong. All Right, Bill, love your podcast and it's great to see you are getting more and more recognition. I'm from Massachusetts and heard your comment on the podcast about Jimmy's possibly originating as a racist term. This is a bogus Smith and the history of Jimmy's is innocent and actually philanthropy pep thick. I can never say that word. It's a philanthropist. And whenever I see it, I can't say it philanthropic, I dunno. Fill anthropic fill anthropic philanthropic. Um, so please don't get sucked into these urban myths just because you heard it from some idiot cunt. Um, seems that I've heard you blast these types in your acts anyways.

Speaker 1:          00:46:43       Thought you would find this interesting and go fuck yourself. The Jimmy story is below. There is nothing racial about the name. Jimmy's and there are no connection whatsoever with the Jim crow laws. Jim Crow laws were anti African laws that many southern states passed following the civil war and they had nothing whatsoever to do with maths at Massachusetts. Now, wasn't Jim. Jim Crow was, was basically separate but equal and it was never equal. It was separate. Shittier, but called equal. Correct. Is that what it is? Anyways, um, here's the story. The bring of family of Boston was in the restaurant business in the early 19 hundreds of 1911 based on a bequest, a bequest, not a real, not a request of request from the patriarch. The Peter Brendt Brigham Hospital was founded. It later merged with the Boston lying in hospital and is now known as the Brigham Women's Hospital. Three years later in 1914 a son Edward l bring them, started the ice cream restaurant in Newton called Brigham's. I remember that place. Brigham's was the shit. It later became a chain of restaurants in 1927 Sidney Farber graduate. Jesus Christ is going to be this long. Can I just tap out and say, you're right. 1927 Sidney Farber graduated from Harvard Medical School and became a

Speaker 3:          00:48:03       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:48:03       a pathologist.

Speaker 3:          00:48:05       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:48:05       At Peter Bent Brigham hospital cheese. It's too fucking long. In 1929 he became a resident just at the children's hospital. Meanwhile, 1930 a candy can't fade out of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Do it. Can you just get to the fucking point? Bethlehem Pennsylvania called just born introduced chocolate grains that could be used as a dessert topping. The man who ran the machine that made the grain was Jimmy Bartholomew. So the grains did. Grains became known as Jimmy's, you know, everything was sounded great. You had all these dates and all these long names of hospitals and they like, yeah, with some guy named Jimmy and he came up with them. Uh, fast forward to 1947, Dr Farber established the Children's cancer foundation known as the Dana Farber Cancer Institute. The next year in 1948, Dr Farber established a fund raise money for children's cancer. A 12 year old boy named in our Gustafason. This is such bullshit at this point. These names are too long. Became the poster boy. He attracted wides, assists the Jimmy Fund.

Speaker 3:          00:49:12       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:49:14       We attracted widespread attention after 1948 radio broadcast for the purpose keeping the boys and MIT. It was agreed that the poster boy should have a more all American sounding name. Yeah. Cause no one will care about an ENR Gustafason.

Speaker 3:          00:49:30       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:49:31       In our Gustafason once you'll have your papers, Peter Bent Brigham Hospital where Dr Fiber First participated, supported the fun, bring them restaurants. Also decided to help raise money for the institute by offering to put chocolate grains on top of ice cream cones and Sundaes for an extra penny. They got the grains from the Jess born company, which sold them as Jimmy's the penny went into the fund. When you got Jimmy's, the boys nickname became Jimmy and the fund became known as the Jimmy Fund. Jimmy was a big fan of the Boston Braves baseball team. Today they are the Atlanta Braves. Holy Shit. Now we've got the history of baseball. When the braise moved from Boston in 1953 the red sox took over as the sponsors to the Jimmy Fund. That's how the sprinkles became known as Jimmy's. Well, you know what sir? Like if that is an all true, that is the greatest filibustering ever. All right, well fuck it.

Speaker 1:          00:50:19       I'll call them jimmies again because you said so. Another unknown client who has a bunch of dates with hospitals and all of that and now know the rest of the story. Jesus fucking Christ was that long. You know, it's funny you heard all of it now it would be great to see if he could, how much you could actually remember and repeat. Hey Bill, how did the name Jimmy's come along? Ah, there was a guy who liked ice crave and he knew someone at a hospital. Then a guy named Gustafason got sick and then there was a gym. He showed up with the ice creams and uh, they would call Jeremy's, there you go. That's, that sounds how it came about. Public service announcement for divorce listeners. Hey Bill, a couple of weeks ago, you advise to force guys to go to another city to increase their chances of getting laid by a good 40%. Did I say that? You know, I'm just trying to fill an hour. I don't even remember saying that and now that I've read it back, it doesn't even make sense to me. Um, I concur. Oh, okay. I guess it does make sense. Allow me to provide a public service to these guys and save them the trouble of trying to figure out where to go get to Amsterdam. Gentlemen.

Speaker 1:          00:51:35       I moved here four years ago from Canada and it's been insane. There are a couple of reasons for this. None of which has to do with weed or hookers though. You can go that route if you want. Reasons. Dutch women, gorgeous with bodies, sculpted by a lifetime of dairy products and riding a bike, uh, as a definite bonus. Uh, they are bored to death of Dutch guys who have zero game. It's like negative game. They're all 14 year olds. No sense of humor, no manners, no flirting skills, Nada. Wait a minute. The whole country, there's not one guy who's fudge just slaying it. There's always one guy in every grade is a handful, but then there's, that was the chosen one that just has that thing anyways, whatever. And he goes, as a foreigner, you're way ahead of these stiffs as soon as you step off the plane.

Speaker 1:          00:52:29       Yeah, that's true. Because you have the accent. You're from somewhere different. Tell me about Winnipeg. Um, and it's not just the Dutch chicks. The city is filled with hot European women either on a, on a weekend bender as a highly impressionable intern because their own country's economy is even in a shittier place or as an expatriate sewing their oats. It's a freaking gold mine. Uh, you can get here, you can get by here easily on English. Everyone speaks it really well. Throwing a couple of Dutch words, Shit that you can learn on the plane, and you've upped your chances by another 30% anyway, they have at boys. Uh, go fuck yourself. Oh, it says go frig yourself. Canadian politeness. Yeah. You know, that's something I wish I knew back when I was a single man. Just get your ass to a different country and your intro intro instantly. You're interesting. You have an accent, you, your clothes are a little different at different perspective. You know, you've seen that these fucking cops come over from England MLL love.

Speaker 7:          00:53:33       Oh God, I love your art.

Speaker 1:          00:53:36       This sitting there with their fucking tight pants, you could see their ankles in their balls all at the same time. You know? I'm all right for the birds. Hey Bill, I got these two parakeets. My problem is that these little dudes don't like me. Uh, I've tried whistling petting them. I don't know. You can pet a bird and squirting them with water. Uh, do they like water? I'm guessing that that's a good thing. Parakeets like water. I don't know. Why don't we ask the fucking Jimmy's guy to write a fucking nine pages on it? I love all them upset with that guy cause he actually did the research as opposed to me who were like, oh yeah, I overheard this in a bar. So anyways, this guy's petting his birds. He's fucking get them with the water hose is Westlawn Adam.

Speaker 7:          00:54:23       Woo.

Speaker 4:          00:54:26       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:54:27       I'm all to no avail. I know they're only birds, but I feel they hold a deep resentment towards me. Where your clip their wings and you stuck them in a cage. How would you feel somebody cut your fucking nuts off, came by, started whistling at you and throwing water at you.

Speaker 4:          00:54:40       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:54:42       I got an idea. Why don't you leave him alone? She opened the cage.

Speaker 4:          00:54:46       Right?

Speaker 1:          00:54:47       Why don't you take him to one of those car Dashi and doctors and I get a little botox in their fucking wings and let them fly away.

Speaker 3:          00:54:54       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:54:55       Would that be annoying to you? If you are in a cage, your arms cut off at the fucking elbows and somebody came up and running and then whistle and they started speaking English. How are you speaking English at you? He goes, I think it's because I yelled at them. Oh, here we go. He goes, I think they were sent me because I yelled at them.

Speaker 4:          00:55:14       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:55:14       What did you, what, what, what were they doing? Uh, I said no with my, during my shows, uh, basically I had to scold them for pooping in their water dish, but I had their best interest in mind.

Speaker 3:          00:55:29       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:55:29       Do you understand how fucking insane you are that you feel like you can talk to a bird? You know, why don't you like not stick the water dish, you know, underwear that, that was it underneath the swing. Or what I would do is I just get a bigger cage. I get a bigger fucking cage. I put the water in the center that isn't near any of those trapeze bars and hopefully they won't be at the top of the cage is still shit down on it. Or I would accept the fact that it's a burden, a cage and that it's, you know,

Speaker 3:          00:56:03       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:56:04       Basically anything at the bottom of the cage might as well be the city of Dresden.

Speaker 4:          00:56:08       Right.

Speaker 1:          00:56:10       I would just take that as part of it. I wouldn't yell at the birds, but it was this guy, he had to scold them for pooping in their water, but I had their best interest in mind. I heard if they drink contaminated water, it can cause a disease that makes all their feathers fall off. While you could also read up on it as opposed to me who just repeat shits that they, here he goes, I do a lot for those little guys. But putting jackets on nude parakeets isn't one of them. Even if I wanted to, I couldn't, they don't even let me pet them, let alone dress them. Dude, you're not a bird guy. You should've got a dog. Uh, he goes, when I originally bought them, I imagine I would have one pair of keyed on each shoulder. Why? Hanging out around my house.

Speaker 1:          00:56:49       But instead, whenever I approached the case, they freeze and horror every time they do that, I can't help her. Remember my brother's face when he fell through the ice. We had to pull him out. I thought maybe if I bought them more toys, they would, that would somehow help to birds. Motivation isn't more toys. Their motivation is you not having energy. Like, I'm going to fucking twist your head off to their wings are clips so they can't escape. You got him stuck in a cage that terrified and you yelled at him. I would say more than on one occasion you yelled at them.

Speaker 4:          00:57:23       All right. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:57:27       you need to fucking relax.

Speaker 4:          00:57:30       All right,

Speaker 1:          00:57:32       listen to this. Would you, would you want to be like your job to be in a cage all day?

Speaker 4:          00:57:37       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:57:38       and then some, you know,

Speaker 4:          00:57:41       I dunno.

Speaker 1:          00:57:42       Some giant comes home and puts you on his fucking shoulders

Speaker 1:          00:57:46       and your whole job is to enhance the giants fucking life. You know what? I'm having a little bit of empathy for the fucking birds. What I would do is I would just have a totally relaxed energy and hope that they forget that you're screamed at them, treat them nicely. Don't try to pet them, just don't fuck with them. Every time you come over, they'll graduate and be like, Oh, this is the guy who feeds us. Scale brings water. This guys on our side, you know, as opposed to the mixed messages that you send to them. Um, yeah. Birch don't give a fuck about toys.

Speaker 4:          00:58:17       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:58:19       do they? I don't think they do a, he said, I bought them a new toy every Friday on my way home from work and this is a ridiculous amount of toys in the cage. And here's the kicker. They haven't played with the single one. Not once. What do do you look at the birds outside?

Speaker 4:          00:58:33       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:58:33       They're, they're not out there. If you leave your toddler's toys outside, they don't go, oh good. They left and then they go down and they start playing on his fucking tricycle. He goes, they just stare at me.

Speaker 4:          00:58:43       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:58:43       I took them to the vet, but he spent more time looking at his phone and the birds. Anyways. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Um, I think you should find a bird lover, sir.

Speaker 4:          00:58:53       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:58:53       And now give the birds away

Speaker 4:          00:58:56       and then, um,

Speaker 1:          00:58:58       I dunno, I think you should get your temper in check and before and before you do that yet, get your temper in check. And then if you want to get a dog, it seems like you want more interaction with the pet. Most people get birds because they can have an interaction with an animal, but they don't have to walk it down the street. And uh, this is very, a lot less interaction with them. You seem like you want a bird to like a dog slash a little kid. Like, Hey, daddy's home. I bought you a fire engine. Oh boy. Look at that as a bell work. You know, somehow you want the bird to do that. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:59:35       yeah, please stop yelling at your birds. All right. They can't help if they shit in the water. You know, the birds, they're not supposed to be in cages. They fly around. And they shit as they fly. They shit when they're on branches, when they have to go, they go, they don't have any stress, they don't have any shame and there's water all over the place. So then I got them in this fucking cage with little confined area water. You know what are, what are they supposed to do? Well, what do I know about the restaurant business? All right, size issues. Oh Jesus. Here we go again. Here we go again. Maybe you need a motorcycle. All right. Sizing issue, a Cape Pasta Bill and Nardo Oh la bill or not. They'll get past show. Uh, we all know your disability to read pop properly.

Speaker 1:          01:00:33       Well, you know what? You don't even have to write a sentence properly. Half of this shit is I get too far in front of myself and the other half, you guys don't have to write a fucking sentence. We all know your disability to read properly. Is that even written correctly or am I a moron? Again, we all know you have a disability when it comes to reading properly. Isn't that how it's supposed to be? So when I don't have to fuck, so I'm going to give it my best shot to keep it very short. Okay. You come in with the arrogance like you have all light life figured out, right, and you've got something tattooed on your rib cage. Um, as you may have read the subject title of this email, you may already know where this is heading. Yeah. You seem pretty cocky for a guy with a little dick. He says, I recently got into an argument with my girlfriend who I've, who've I've been with for a little more than two and a half years, where she told me that she wished I had a bigger deck.

Speaker 1:          01:01:29       Oh Man. Ah, yeah. That relationship is over, dude. DEB relationship is over at one or two ways. Either one, she's just trying to be so fucking mean to you that you break up with her because she doesn't want to be the bad guy or she's just such a fucking self-involved human being that she doesn't realize like how mean that is. That'd be like he said, yeah, I like you. I wish the tits were bigger. That would just be the mean is fucking thing. Why would you say that to somebody that you cared about? That's a horrible thing to say, sir. You know what? You started off as an arrogant cunt. Now I'm feeling bad for you, dude. That's not the mother. Your kids just take the dick out of the equation. Why don't you just said your nose is too big? That's just fucking a, that's,

Speaker 1:          01:02:18       that's, that's, that's just a terrible person says she goes, I was shocked to hear this and didn't know what to say. There's nothing to say. There's nothing you can do about it. This is the first time she ever mentioned my penis size. Also the first time in my life. By the way, I guess anybody's ever brought it up to be honest. I don't know that I'm not well endowed with my 5.5 inch rocket. You're a little below average, sir. I'm not going to lie to you now being me. You know, you can grab the rim, but you can't stuff at home. You know what I mean? Um, and I did have little, uh, have insecurities about it in the past, but learn to accept it and moved on. I never heard any of my former bed partner girls complain and the sex was usually great.

Speaker 1:          01:03:01       Um, I know that it may sound ridiculous, but those few words were heartbreaking to hear it put a big giant stain on my confidence. Yeah. It's a terrible thing that she said. I haven't felt like having sex ever since. And she made oh, was ever since she made that remark. And I am afraid it's going to be awhile. I haven't spoken to her since the arguments since I work a lot. We don't live together. I know it's a stupid thing to be upset about. No, it isn't, sir. You're a 100% and the right hundred percent in the right. And he goes, and I usually don't really care about penis sizes, blah. But hearing that your small from your own girlfriend is a whole other story. Um, typically, typically not that guy that gets back at her by pointing out her physical flaws, but I don't know where to go from here. Uh, it's even more difficult texting with her. What do I do? Bill? Got Any advice? Okay. You said you don't know where to go from here. I can tell you exactly what to go right out our front fucking door. That's it. It's a wrap, sir. It's a wrap. Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:04:04       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:04:04       Now listen, I'm not saying that she's wrong for wanting a bigger dick. Okay? Like she needs more to satisfy or, or whatever. Or She just wants to go out and bang some fucking big Dick Dude at this point. All right? You know, but her tact is wrong. Okay? You, you, you accepted yourself, which is one of the greatest things you can do that leads towards being happy every day, which leads you to treating the people around you,

Speaker 2:          01:04:36       okay?

Speaker 1:          01:04:37       Respectfully. Which leads them to treating you respectfully, which leads to more happiness. She fucked with the core, your happiness. You know, you felt good about yourself. She pointed out something and made you feel horrible about yourself. It's one of the worst fucking thing she could've done as far as mentally to you and, and, and right now, the last thing you want to do is go out and say the same thing to her. All right? If you really want to do just paraphrase what the fuck I just said. It just, just, I dunno and I would just leave it dead. I get in the childish thing to do. This is what you really want to get it back. Just saying challenges, thing for me to do would point out some, some of your physical floss. And the great thing is is you leave it ambiguous, okay? And I guarantee you she's going to be in a bathroom mirror staring at herself. Uh, if you want to get mean,

Speaker 4:          01:05:32       okay, but um,

Speaker 1:          01:05:36       you know what this, but I gotta tell you some of what's even better. You got to have this, what's known as the self esteem breakup,

Speaker 4:          01:05:43       okay?

Speaker 1:          01:05:45       Which you totally in the right here and you just say, listen. All right. What you said to me, I thought I used to feel good about myself and what you said to me, mess with the core of my own, my own happiness and how I feel about myself, and that's not what I'm looking for in a girlfriend or a potential wife. And, uh,

Speaker 1:          01:06:10       I just can't see you ever being a good mother if you would say something like that. It's just something along those lines. I don't, I don't, I keep going. Me Don't call me, uh, whatever the fuck I just said. I was just trying to paraphrase what the fuck I said, but it, dude, this, this is, you should feel good about yourself. All right? You know, you, you're not a porn star, but you're also, you know, you're not like a, you're not what she's making out to be here. All right? That's it. You still, you're still in the game, sir. Okay. You're not part of the starting five. Hey, neither am I. You know, but you and I, we come off that bench. Okay. We're the kind of guys, well, the guys that go in the corners, right? Uh, yeah. Man, that's, that's you're, you're a hundred percent advice. My advice would be that this girl is, is not anywhere near the level of maturity she needs to be and, uh, might never even get to that level. Um, the point, the redeeming thing that I can say to her is she has such a difficult time doing what she wants to do in life that maybe she wanted to break up with you for awhile and she didn't know how to do it and it was building up. And then there was just an argument and then she just said that. Or, um, I dunno. Have you said anything to her? I have no idea.

Speaker 4:          01:07:28       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:07:30       Oh, it's funny. He says, uh, thanks for the weekly podcast. You have no idea what it means to me.

Heard you ask about Bulgaria in eastern Europe. I've traveled around Europe over the last five years in Bulgaria is very nice. Plus they love Americans.

Speaker 1:          01:12:11       Serbia is pretty nice too. They don't love Americans like the bulks, but uh, it's still safe even though we bombed them in the 90s. They even have a pretty good sense of humor about it. And if they know you're American, you're American. Perfect. Strangers will walk. Or if they know you're American dish should be a common common there. Perfect. Strangers will walk to you and ask and ask the question, why did you bomb us? And even they settle, celebrate a battle they lost to us. Well, if they came up to me and said, why did you bomb us? I would be like, I wasn't even aware of we did that.

Speaker 1:          01:12:48       What happened? Uh, that would make it even worse. May even celebrate a battle. They lost us. Serbia, Serbia has been very commercialized over the last 10 years. And there is a strict code of masculinity amongst the men, kind of like Americans plus, I don't even know what that means. Plus the exchange rate is great all over the former Yugoslavia and instead of booking a hotel, you can rent a very nice apartment for a month and it would actually be cheaper and nicer than a hotel because there's no first or last or at least as long as you have cash in a place to crash, stay away from Romania. The only good thing I heard about that country is the country, which is beautiful in the summer. The rest of the year it looks like Apalasia I don't even know what that means. I don't, I don't even know what that is. Apple Laka um, I, yeah, I always feel like if I'm going to get kidnapped in Europe, I always feel like it's going to be in eastern Europe. I would think of that. And you never hear anything about Bulgaria, what the weight and what the fuck did we do? I need to know this. We're gonna be dropping bombs on people in a bad way.

Speaker 2:          01:13:56       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:13:56       We bombed Serbia.

Speaker 2:          01:13:59       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:13:59       Was that when there are other Croatia, the Serbians, Bosnia, Herzegovina. We were all fucking battling with each other. That's when you get sloppy and checklists of archaea became independent of Russia and now they didn't have a common enemy and the Russians because they had pulled out. You have to like 1990 and then they instantly picked up on these wars that have been gone for like 90 years. Isn't that what happened? Ah, Jesus. Hey, America bombs Serbia.

Speaker 4:          01:14:35       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:14:35       NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. All right. Reason why I hit USA America bombing of Serbia.

Speaker 1:          01:14:44       That's a video. Oh, Bill Clinton. Oh yeah, I remember that. Oh, didn't he bomb them? Because he fucking was fingering in that fucking refrigerated faced fucking mess of a woman. You make me feel like a younger man. Can I stick this cigar and you pussy. Um, the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia was NATO's military operation against the federal public of Yugoslavia during the Kosovo war. The strikes lasted from March 24th, 1999 to June 10th. My birthday, 1999 the official NATO operation, well, code was operation, allied force, Yada, Yada, Yada goals, NATO's objective and the Kosovo conflict or stated and the North Atlantic countings means, but yeah, and I imagine they said it was something about freedom, but it was really about some sort of natural resource or power.

Speaker 4:          01:15:37       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:15:40       Strategy today. What the fuck is it? Come on, let's get to the, what was her name? Margo Adams. What was the name of that? Poor. That unfortunate woman,

And uh, then right after that, then I have to do my acting gig. And I never tell you guys much about the acting gigs because so many guys I know get into movies or whatever and then they tell people they're in them and then they get cut out or whatever.

Speaker 1:          01:18:41       So I wait till it's in theaters when it's in theaters and I'm actually in it. Then I tell you I'm in the movie. That seems to be the best way to go about it.
