Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's the Monday morning podcast for Monday, August 20th, 2012. How's it going out? I can't fucking hear myself. I don't know what the fuck happened to my, uh, my other, my regular, my regular headphones, which suck by the way because they flake all over my ears. What does that mean bill? I don't know. A little pieces of plastic. You know, like they don't have the space age technology. Whenever somebody uses that expression, you know, they have no idea what they're talking. This is just coming from the gut. Like they don't have the fucking space age technology to make a set of headphones that, that will just last forever. You know, can't do that canyon. Well we might get lasts forever. Oh, they're never going to come back and buy another one. Dan, what are we going to do? I don't know. Go plant some beats. You fucking cunt. Do you feel how fucking hot the sun is lately? Have you felt it?

Speaker 1:          00:01:05       You know, do you remember it ever being is fucking hot as it is now? Like, literally God has a magnifying glass right up on the crown of your head. Granted, part of it could be because my hair's done and out, but I choose not to address that this week. You know the God damn hole in the ozone layer. Can you make fucking headphones last a little bit longer? You know, so now what I'm supposed to throw out these other ones, these flaky ones that I can't even fucking fine. Right? I love, I yo put it in the trash, put it in the fucking trash like, like it's still not going to end up outside somewhere. It is outside. We just have it over here in this contained area. You know what? I'm not going to be able to tell whether any of this is funny cause I can't hear myself. I'm like a singer right now. You know, turn up the monitors. Oops, I did it again as shaped my pathy. Um, yeah, so I got to go out and go buy another, another fucking pair of headphones. I'm one of those crabby old fucking people who I, when I buy something, I use it until it's fucking, it becomes literally on a different matter, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:02:22       Starts dissolving into a, a powder. Is that a different matter? All you egg heads out there, we'll technically a powder is still a solid, it's just did a more granulated form. Thank you. Never fucking got your Dick sucked. Why don't you go back with the lab coat and have a nice fucking hand job with yourself and a pipe in it again later when I say something stupid. Um, I'm a little wound up this morning. I'm excited. An older, wiser bill burr, wiser than he was last week. I'm finally back, uh, back here in Los Angeles, Los Angeles, you know, which is always, you know, kind of a creepy place to come to once you've been on the east coast and you sit in there looking at all the green trees and all the ponds and all the lush land back there. And then I fly across the fucking country, as I always say, watching the country slowly die, right? Slowly getting fucking, you know, geographical chemotherapy. Um, it's usually to be a big Bandanna tied right over fucking Arizona in southern California. Oh, that's good. Beth. A little cancer joke in there with your fucking musings about our topography, topography. Um, but I got to admit, I'm actually excited to be on this side of the country.

Speaker 1:          00:03:39       I think I have a better chance of surviving whatever the fuck is going to happen to this planet. Believe it or not, in this overpopulated city that technically has no water supply. I have a better fucking chance. Why you ask? I'll tell you why. Because I read a fucking article. I didn't read it. Who's kidding? Who? I glazed over it and it was so fucking depressing. It scared the fucking shit out of me. But as far as I can tell, New York City is going to look like Venice and about three years. That's what I'm guessing. You know, it's going underwater. That's what I think.

Speaker 1:          00:04:18       So if you're on the third floor or lower, you might want to consider selling your apartment now. Um, they've just do an all this shit talking about how, you know, the glaciers are melting at a much quicker rate. Len scientists first feared, look at this picture from July. Now look at this one. You know, I have no idea. You know what's funny is I have no idea if the pictures are fucking real. You know, they're like these, uh, these pictures that show like, you know, red and white, white obviously being the glacier red being now like fucking the sunburn, shoulders of a red head or some shit. Right? So it's basically scaring the shit out of me. And then I actually found comfort in something.

Speaker 1:          00:05:01       Well, they were saying that scientists, you know, not so much shit has melted in Antarctica. They're actually saying that, um, this is even being recorded. I can't even fucking hear myself. Uh, what's the solution bill? Should you turn it up a little bit? Maybe a little bit halfway through it. Why not now? Look at it now. It just went through the fucking roof and I still can't hear myself anyways. Scientists or the writer who wrote the article, maybe they just made it up. I have no fucking idea. Basically said that, uh, they discovered, you know that back in the day, aunt Artica was aunt Artica bill at Arctica, aunt Artica, who gives a fuck, you know, God damn place with all this fucking penguins sitting there pushing their fucking, except who fucking went and saw that march of the penguins. Why don't you just call it, I want to cry for the final half hour.

Speaker 1:          00:05:57       You know, that's what every nature show is. Let's show you how fucking cute they are. And now we're going to show you what we're doing to them. And now you sit there with this hopeless, sad fucking feeling, right? And then what if you'd like to donate, give the flak and save the penguins feet, right? Dotcom. And then what do you do? You go over to your checkbook, you know, and you pull out another check and you write, you write it out, and then you grab a fucking envelope and you grabbed a stamp. You do all that bullshit. Or you print out a stamp if fuse and stamps.com oh, what a whore. Um, right. And you mail it off thinking you did a good thing, but what did you do? He just used a whole bunch of paper. Yeah. You know? Right. Because you do that enough people do that. They got to cut down another tree, right? Next thing you know that little fucking penguins got nothing to center underneath. You don't want to, Jax is a little fucking penguin dick to make another egg. And then how it works. Aren't they like asexual that they fucking Jack often with their little flipper into the other flipper. And then do like a pap smear fucking uh, sort of a George Gervin lay up to their own fucking crotch area.

Speaker 2:          00:07:04       George Gervin the iceman that actually made sense. Penguins ice, right? I go fuck yourself. Anyways,

Speaker 1:          00:07:12       so, um, this part is it made up, they actually said that, that the fucking and article that the fucking Antarctica, okay. You people who are, uh, scientists out there, Jesus belt. Just say what they said. Just say what? The Guy said that they said that you now believe. Um, he said, uh, oh Geez, I can stop talking to her cell phone than Antarctica. People punching the dashboard right now. Spit it out. And Arnica used to be a tropical forest. All right. Nine. Oh, a lot of rednecks went.

Speaker 2:          00:07:51       How born to the fucking swamps running over vapor.

Speaker 1:          00:07:59       Well, I think their tails is so flat. They used me round to me. My truck went in that crick. Hey, no, not likely. And driving over some hairy little fucker. I love it. Raccoons. These just something about him. Raccoons, possums, all of them. They just got this look on their face that just says, shoot me. You know,

Speaker 2:          00:08:20       I'm just going with my instincts. I'm out in nature and I'm just going with it. I'm seeing these little fuckers to staring at me. I got my headlights out them. They just keep fucking looking at you don't get shot stuff fucking looking at me. That's how I look at it. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:08:35       this is what I believe with that information that that guy said that the other guy said that know what they're talking about.

Speaker 1:          00:08:42       So I, I think that the global war, I can't believe I'm actually trying to attempt to discuss this subject. I think global warming is actually natural, but we are hastening it. We're just making it way fucking quicker. We have it on forward. You're like, you fast forward through commercials. That's what we're doing. And we're doing that towards our, uh, our own fucking demise, which I think is going to be tremendous. You know, and then we'll die. And then maybe all this shit that, you know, when they put a microscope up to your skin, all that little shit there that's crawling all over you. Maybe. Maybe that's the next thing that's going to build a skyscraper. Name it after themselves and have people write a whole fucking nice version of their life because they're afraid that there actually is some old man in the sky that's going to fucking judge them when they die. You know, if you could write your own little thing,

Speaker 1:          00:09:34       your own little ditty about your life, how would you sum yourself up? I love people that kind of know they were a Douche, you know, although he didn't always right there, you know, like, okay, I know I'm kind of going to hell in a way. Speaking of which, I started reading this book, sins of the, it's a book I wanted to read for a long time. It was about not Joe Kennedy. And I figured what better time to start reading that book while I was taking an ultra white vacation on the island of Nantucket, considering you get on the high speed ferry, run over a couple of seals, um, right out of Hyannis port, home of the Kennedy compound, you know, and for so long, what did they say? They call it Camelot there the first fucking Royal Lee family and all that bullshit. Right. But I always heard, you know that what's his face?

Speaker 1:          00:10:31       Joe Kennedy was, you know, Goddamn rum runner, you know, he made all this money, insider trading and all this fucking bullshit. Right? So I wanna I want to read about it. I want to, I want to see, I want to hear the other side. Now that I've read the fluff about all the sacrifices he made for this country and all his kids die in, you know, in war and in public servants getting assassinated and fucking going skiing while trying to play football. Right. I was like, I got to check this shit out and I read it. You know, I've got the book. I thought it was going to be a great book. That book is, it's like a fucking, I feel like some soccer mom reading some juicy like summer novel. Like I should be digging my toes in the sand with my knees up to my chest as I read it. It's just such a one sided and it's so, so much fucking hearsay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:20       Oh, did he? Did he do this for this reason? Or maybe he did it because he was a cunt. First of all, the guy made a fuck load of money. All right, let's, let's get down to brass tacks to guy is one of the weirdest looking human beings I've ever seen in my life. I used to think all the Kennedys had that same look about them cause they sort of did a Rothchild thing where they kind of, they kind of fucked real close to the farm, so to speak. So they kind of had that [inaudible] here comes my big fucking head over here. Right?

Speaker 1:          00:11:53       He's a fucking weird looking dude. I will definitely give you that. But when he did his insider trading, it wasn't illegal. You know, the guy actually says in the book that it wasn't illegal, so he didn't do anything wrong. You know, it was looked down upon, it was considered a shady thing to do. But the guy goes and then he has some sort of quote of Joe Kennedy go cabal, let's do this quick before they make a law against it. It's like, where did you get that fucking quote from? I don't know. So all I do is I'm just skipping around the book. I want to see how he reacted when when Jack got whacked, I wanted to see what happened to their kid that you know, they said was a mentally challenged but maybe wasn't, was just a pain in the ass and they gave her a fucking love. Bottomy it's really just a sad fucking read. I just jumped around it and now I'm going to use it as a fucking paper weight and I can't tell you how long I wanted to read that book. I know what you're thinking right now. Bill, where the fuck are you going with this? I don't know. I don't know where I'm going. I can't fucking hear myself.

Speaker 1:          00:12:58       All right. For those of you who did listen to my podcast last week, I have a new stand up special called you. People are all the same and it's airing exclusively. It's streaming, whatever you could say on a Netflix and I know what you're thinking. Is it only on Netflix in America or the United States? No sir, ma'am. Transgendered person. It's a hermaphrodites. It's also on Canada. Netflix. It's also on Ireland, Netflix and Great Britain. Netflix, which I'm really excited about because I think I got, I think I have a very, uh, very, uh, user friendly, special [inaudible] got a little choked up there. Um, I think people are gonna like it. When you think about that. I'm actually, I'm feeling good you guys. You guys wrote so many nice things to be on Twitter, which is a rarity to just get a whole nice sea of niceness. And I know a couple of cuts right now just for the fuck of it going to write a bad one, but I know what you're up to.

Speaker 1:          00:13:59       Um, so people ask me, they said, hey, how can I regular guy, regular old gal, just salt of the earth person. How can I get a hard copy version of that hour of filth that you just put out on Netflix? Um, this is the deal. Um, the hard copy version, the digital version, whatever the fuck you want to download it to your Ipod, you're fucking a iPad. What? I don't know what, whatever you people use, I don't, I don't fucking know anymore. Okay. However you want or you want to go fucking old school, I'll put it out on VHS. You keep running your gaps. Now I'm not doing that. I'll put it out on DVD and all that stuff and you will be able to get it at my website. And my website only build bird.com. That's it. We've got a whole page set up, but I just, you know, it will be coming out in September.

And uh, the wonderful thing about this is, uh, I'm eliminating the middle man and that way it can be fucking cheaper. You know, I'm basically, I'm doing what Radiohead did 10 years ago. I'm doing what prince did. I'm going to do that thing, you know, and now it's gone into the whole fucking comedy world with uh, Louis C k Aziz and all those guys and I being the hack that I am and I am following right in line. Okay. Seems to be working for everybody else. Why not me? Um, so there you go. That's how you're going to be able to get it. You're just going to go to my website and um, as that day approaches when you can do it, uh, I will let you know and um, I don't know what the prices are going to be.

Speaker 1:          00:15:43       It seems like it's going to be $5. I want to be, I want to have it be $5 and 1 cent just to fucking piss people off, you know, sacrificing some sales just for people. But this got to think he's 1 cent better than everybody else. Um, so that's, that's the answer to your questions. People have been asking me. Um, all right. And that is it. Back to the podcast. If this podcast is even being recorded, God knows I can't fucking hear myself. Um, speaking of stamps.com everybody, come on. Don't do this to me. Oh, I hate this computer. I fucking, what is the problem?

Speaker 1:          00:16:25       What is the fucking problem? I did it right. Oh, what now? You're going to freeze up on me? You're going to freeze up on when I need you most, right. Right in the middle of the podcast. So now what do I have to do? I have to force fucking quit. I don't like foursquare. That's a little too rapey, isn't it? In a computer sense. Forced quit. There you go. I'm forcing you to quit. Yeah, like an overbearing father. Hey. You know, one thing that I noticed about myself asides, you know, the obvious that I'm an extreme douchebag is when I was down in Nantucket, I really had to work on not hating rich people just because they were rich, you know? Oh, let me get this stupid commercial out of the way here real quick. Not a stupid commercial. A a very important information. Let me get this to you here.

Nieces, nephews, the whole nine yards, drinking again. Oh baby, I'm drinking again. You know, I'm down there, boozing it up, drinking some of that Cisco Brewery, whale tail, Pale Ale, whatever they got down there. You know, I got my little Nantucket Red Fuckin um, I'm friends with the bankers shorts on. I'm living the dream. All right. And I'm just sitting there walking around and I'm looking at all these rich fucking people

Speaker 1:          00:19:19       and I just find myself, I fucking the level with which I was judging them, which of course no one would give a shit. You know what I mean? If I was judging, uh, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:19:32       a Ey, ey with the fuck am I doing? If I was judging like some poor group of people like that, I would be considered the biggest douche ever. All right? You don't all these poor people. Why? Why are you judging in that way? Right? But you, you, you did he, why am I stuttering? You're fucking judge rich people that way. Everybody laughs. They all think it's funny. You know, I had to work the whole week. It's like, why do I hate that guy? How do I know he didn't get his money? Legitimately? Why am I immediately assuming that this guy was a complete piece of fucking shit? You know, you know what it is. I don't like how rich people carry themselves. People born into wealth. They just have this, like that time when I was in DC and that little fucking six year old kid got up, walked right up to the bark, a client up on the stool and started calling out to this adult behind the bar, sir, sir, excuse me sir, like the co I can, I'll never be able to do the proper read of that. The way this kid said it, there was such a comfort

Speaker 1:          00:20:36       in, in, in summarizing this person over to come and talk to them to do whatever the fuck he needed them to do at six years old. Um, if fucking the shit, I mean, I was

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       just looking at in these, these fucking which people they have the creepiest looking God damn kids you ever seen in your life. Just creepy little fucking future bankers, CEO looking kids, you know, little blonde hair. They already got those, those Chubby fucking, you know, all kids have chubby cheeks, but just the way they look, that waspy pedigree. Right.

Speaker 1:          00:21:09       Which is another thing I can get away with. You know what I mean? The waspy pedigree, everybody will laugh. We can only gives a fuck about that. You can trash waspy people up and down. I can't be always with this, this, this Jewish

Speaker 2:          00:21:20       blah blah. That's it. I got to fucking apology. Waspy totally gets a fucking open lane. So anyways, waspy fucking look upon them, right with their fucking, you know, they look like little Winston Churchill's like they still talk like little kids, but they should be walking around and right here Troy Howard was numbers number rider. How did, it just did just look like they're going to fucking get, they're going to get some great fucking job and they, and they're going to steal from the company and when they get caught, they're not going to get fucking prosecutor. Just like these God bankers just like all these rich cuts, they just not gonna cause they're going to have connections and Pete and he's going to got to know shit about people, whatever. And they just, they just hook each other up the same way

Speaker 1:          00:22:06       at the level that I grew up. You didn't rat out your friends. They're doing the same thing at their level, except what they can do affects the entire population as opposed to the level that I came up with where, you know, maybe somebody's car that used to be there isn't there anymore yet off. That's insurance fraud, I guess that hopes that hurts the group after a while, doesn't it? I Dunno. So that was basically, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:22:33       what I had to work at, you know, and they had this place down the street called the summer house. I was staying out in Wisconsin and uh, it's absolutely fucking beautiful and uh, I just couldn't get myself to go in there. I want it to go in there. I wanted to sit down and have a fucking drink, but every time I saw another person going in with their fucking boat shoes without any socks on, like I felt like this, this hatred coming up in me and I justified it for like two, three days. And I was just like, what the fuck is wrong with me? You know, I bet you know those people that they're probably just like me or the people I hang out with in that, as I always say, most of them are douchebags but there's going to be like four or five people in that are going to be really interesting. I've totally time I flew on the plane, right? And I sat next to that guy who made a ton of fucking money starting his own credit credit card. And then he parlayed that money into buying cell phone towers. The guy was fucking hilarious. He had it lost it, had it all again, lost it. And then now he was on top again. He had this a, what the fuck are you gonna do? Vibe self made man. So I'm sitting there going,

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       they're not all like that, but they all had that saved. I def with their fucking feet. I can't stand them. I really got issues.

Speaker 3:          00:23:54       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:54       Cause here I am, I'm down there, I'm vacation and to act and like, oh but I'm the down to Earth Douche bag with my salmon colored shorts on. Fucking hypocrite.

Speaker 1:          00:24:05       I Dunno. So anyways, I ended up going out fishing, uh, with my family. We had a great time, didn't catch shit, just catch blue fish, didn't even catch us. Striper did catch anything, but you know, it was still cool and we didn't take more than that then we were going to eat. So, uh, I didn't feel too bad about that, but, uh, I think I kind of got talked into doing something really stupid. The guy who had the boat actually had a fucking shark cage and he's like, you know, it's totally safe. We take you about 15 miles out. We chummed the water and you get in this fucking cage and you know what, Ah, you have to all these years of doing bits about how fucking stupid it is to swim in the ocean and all that type of shit. I'm going to do it next year. I'm going to do it. I almost said it costs an arm and a leg as your fucking pun right there. You're awful joke. But uh, it does. It's really expensive, but I want to see a fucking shark.

Speaker 3:          00:25:03       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:25:03       You know, and I got that white thing in me where I, uh, that white person think where I want to see the shark being a shark. You know, the same way. I don't want to see a bear just walking through the forest. I want to throw something at it so it gets up on its hind leg Ra and starts doing that shit. Like it's about ready to step into the squared circle. Right. I think that that is uniquely a white thing that we, we just, we just want to see it animal looking like it's going to kill us or we don't feel like we, that we got the full experience now. Okay. Now can I not only not hear myself getting hot as fuck in here and I don't even know why. Oh bill private. Cause you don't have the windows open. Um, anyways, what else do I have here? What else do I have here on the dock at a shit that I want to talk about?

Speaker 1:          00:25:59       Oh, as you can tell, I read rolling stone. Here's another article I saw, by the way, they have Rick Ross on the, uh, on, on the cover. I don't know much about the guy other than he's the most confident fat person I've ever seen in my life for half a second. I thought it was little Wayne and he just went to like Wendy's for 20 days in a row. How much does the tattoo artists not want to tattoo the underneath part of fucking Rick Ross's man tits. You know, cause at some point you sitting there with the surgical gloves and you got to hold it up and actually feel the fucking weight of it. Is Your fucking, I wonder if he giggles. Um, I actually, I started to read that article, but I, I cannot, I can't read articles about rappers at that fuck who come with that vibe of look of, Oh look at all the shit that I have. It's the most, you feel like you're reading like a fucking, I dunno what Jordan Marsh catalog. That's all they are. He said something. He was standing on Jewish marble. Is there a such thing as Jewish marble? I have no fucking idea. Is that somehow like a GM? I said kosher if like some fucking Borshbelt joke. Um, at one point and he goes out to a fucking steakhouse. They list everything that he orders and how much it costs.

Speaker 4:          00:27:19       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:27:20       Uh, it's unreal if you illiterate, if you, honestly, if you have problems sleeping, read that. And I'm not trashing the writer. I just, I, I, I'm on a fucking plane. I'm trying to kill time and I couldn't get through the fucking article. Oh, do you smoke weed the whole time? Do you have 50,000 fucking cars? I got it.

Speaker 4:          00:27:43       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:27:45       You know what they call that Nantucket? They call that new money.

Speaker 1:          00:27:50       I never used to know what that expression is. He's new money. You know what old money does old money acts like they don't have money. You know what I mean? They'd walk around and Salmon, fucking colored pants and they call up their financial advisor and then they manipulate the market and they make more fucking money. And then all of a sudden they, a prohibition comes along and they got to hook up for Scotch. So what do they do? They fucking do it. I really don't have a prop while you know something, I didn't get into how we, uh, I don't know who the fuck knows if anything that they're saying about Joe Kennedy's the truth. I want it to be the truth. You know, cause it makes you feel better about yourself. That's what it is. That's why you look at rich people like that. You have to look at them like they did something fucking crooked. Because if you don't, it makes you feel like a loser. His fucking yacht is bigger than all the houses on my block,

Speaker 4:          00:28:40       you know?

Speaker 1:          00:28:41       Now if you give him the benefit of the doubt, then you just have to stand there and just take that shit. Or you can just say he's a crooked son of a bitch. He's going to hell. God loves me best. Right. And you could walk around with your fucking nose in the air, like you're better with your slightly cheaper salmon colored fucking pants.

Speaker 4:          00:28:59       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:29:00       I ain't know what the fuck I'm talking about. So anyways, so I'm not an operating that whole fucking Rick Ross thing.

Speaker 4:          00:29:06       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:29:09       I don't know. I'm sure he's got good music. I don't give a fuck. Okay. How many different ways can you say I have more shit than you do?

Speaker 4:          00:29:20       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:29:21       like he was bragging about eating lobster bisque for breakfast. That's what, that's what new money does. New money gets like fucking DVD. Those DVD players in the head rest when you drive in like a two seater. Remember that Shit, I got those best for the people behind me. That's how much money I have. I can actually waste it. Rather than taking that money and, and adding to my portfolio and be, and, and truly getting out of my fucked up neighborhood. I'm going to do that instead. That's what new money does straight across the board. Straight across the board. You get a redneck, a bunch of money. You know what's he going to do? Huh? So you going to buy some gold? Is he going to, you know, try to invest it and seeking to start a business. Now he's gonna put another three inches on that truck.

Speaker 1:          00:30:13       He's going to get some big fuck and motors and he's going to fucking drive down the fucking street. He's gonna make us fucking engine waterproof, have that goddamn chimney coming up the side of it so you can go into the swamp and right back and never have to fucking stop. That's my Apocalypto fucking truck out there and he shit happens. I'll drive over everybody. I'll just keep going to, I get up North Pole, make myself fucks. NOCO that's what new money does, right? Is that what they do? I don't know what they do. You know what I do with my money? I just sit and stare at it.

Speaker 1:          00:30:51       I Dunno what to do with the money that I have. I don't, I have no fucking idea what to do with it. Cause you know what would wherever you invested, this is the funny thing about investing your money. All of it involves you taking your money and giving it to somebody else and then going, all right, call you in a month. It's the dumbest Shit I ever did, you know, and the fucking stock market. That's like getting in the mob. Once you're in, you can't get out. Oh, you can get out, you know? But it's going to cost. You got to cut your fucking Dick off. Get your fucking shit back out again.

Speaker 1:          00:33:59       Um, anyways, so I know I'm drinking water here. All right. What else can I talk about here? 34 fucking minutes. And you guys watching any preseason football? Why not? What are you watching? Baseball and the six teams that are competitive. Um, well, speaking of which, I was back in Boston and uh, I try really hard to listen to that sports talk radio. It's just fuck, it's impossible. Who listens to actually feel bad for the on air personalities that they have to sit there for four fucking hours. Like, like those legitimate sports talk radio guys, not the smart ones who go, all right, it's a sports talk radio show. But we're going to talk, we're going to bitch about our wives. Uh, we're going to fucking talk about how we went golfing and we gambled and so-and-so sucked. And I want all that guy shit and smoke cigars.

Speaker 1:          00:34:50       And then if something interesting is going on in sports, we'll bring it up, right? Like Roger Clemens gets acquitted, you know, by the way, just cause he got acquitted, he got acquitted, uh, of uh, lying under oath, which is one of the most difficult things to proof. Okay. So, but if you think that that guy didn't take a fucking something and stick at, you know, where and all of a sudden he's winning those shiny things, you're out of your fucking mind. See how he did that? So couldn't get sued. Uh, that's just my opinion. All right. I actually have a number of people that I'm watching as a sports fan.

Speaker 4:          00:35:25       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:35:26       I'm telling you what's his face? Milky Cabrera. I almost called Paul Versey and gave him shit like, Hey, you should've got rid of this guy. All of a sudden he's coming on. That is the telltale fucking, I think now of, of of PDS. It's, it's one, it's one of the, it's basically as simple as this because you don't get fucking gigantic anymore. I think they got it down with that little cream that'll solve. They have like steroid lip, Bob, you know, you just put it on your bottom. Let me go [inaudible] and next thing, next thing you know, you're fucking running over people. You turn in the corner and you're hitting home runs, right. Just pay attention to people who were okay. And then they started to taper off and all of a sudden they're fucking great up telling you,

Speaker 3:          00:36:13       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:36:14       that never happened when I was a kid. Once you started tapering off, you have, you were fucking done. I Dunno, maybe, I'm sure there's always a couple of examples. Oh, by the way, one little fucking editor, a note last week when I brought up the, um, the spurs and the Houston Rockets, I talk so fast, it sounded like I was saying that those were pile on teams. I wasn't saying that, I wasn't saying that. I realized that, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:36:41       you know that what's his face Olijahwaun and they drafted and I obviously real, if I certainly realize that Tim Duncan was from their system because the Celtics were in the lottery that year and Tim Duncan would have been know, he would have been great anyway, but he was such a perfect Celtic yet out fun of Bell Basketball, boring as hell, kissing the ball off the glass. Jesus Christ. Fucking Tommy Heisen. Um, and David Robinson, I realized that those were your guys. So I w I was trying to say that those teams I respect, they weren't pile on teams, but uh, you know, the NBA is a silver, silver bunch of little dream teams. Um, what the fuck was, okay. So I actually, I am, and I'm not going to say the person's name, but it is a running back in the NFL and his last name is the name of a bear.

Speaker 1:          00:37:36       And it also talks about maybe a lady's muff. Um, they go, it's just somebody who I saw was, you know, was the man in college, was not the man in NFL. And all of a sudden last year I'm watching him. He's fucking running over people. Rarely you learn how to run over people. Four years into it, I'm not buying, I'm not buying it. And the last sentence he plays on the Seattle Seahawks, that's just a misdirection. Um, you'd have to be a two year old enough to figure it out. Um, all right. And that's the deal. I want to start taking fucking roids. They make it up for us now. I'm, I got a whole new bid on it too, so I can't burn too much of this. But it's about that synergetics those fucking old roid it up. Those guys they're on, they're on. That's human growth hormone that those guys are on. You know, they show him all sad but there man ticks, tits ticks, man, tits on this stomach and then the stomach hanging on their fucking old man ball bag. And then all of a sudden, like a month later, that did look like an Adonis. You know the ball bag looks like a fucking speed bag again. They'd read their bay, their wife is over in the corner, right? Just fucking squatting on a tub of fucking, uh, Ben Gay. Cause he just tore it up like it was 1926 again,

Speaker 1:          00:39:00       I want to know why those fucking people aren't going to get brought before a grand jury for cheating.

Speaker 3:          00:39:06       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:39:07       You're going to bring Clemons out there. Clemens in his big old butt, right? You're going to bring him out there and question all of the 87 cy young award. See One past the age of 50. What about these fucking old guys? All of a sudden they're old fucking heads in a young body is going to go down to the Goddamn a fucking, uh, whatever the clam shack, right? And just start banging out fucking 20 year olds. There's gotta be a price that you're going to pay for that. Is God going to allow that? That can't be a god,

Speaker 3:          00:39:40       okay?

Speaker 1:          00:39:40       How is God allowing them? That goes against all the laws of nature. There's going to be fucking 80 year old guys with knocked up 25 year olds,

Speaker 3:          00:39:55       okay?

Speaker 1:          00:39:56       My girlfriend's pregnant, right? They're going to be sitting there with their fucking dentures and they'll write it up. Bodies trying to talk to these girls and to get an abortion. You know that I'm telling you, that's what's going to happen to this fucking generation. All these guys, these guys who invented the fucking, uh, youtubes, the, my spaces, the Facebook's, all of them, by the time, you know, once they figure this shit out, by the time they get in their [inaudible], they're all going to be fucking write it up. They're going to be fucking knock it up. Fucking 22 year olds and then they're going to have them like there's somehow happen CAFTA hadn't whacked. Can you imagine that? Would you, would you guys, uh, I dunno. Would you do it? Cause they're going to figure it out. Look it, I'm 44. I figured by the time I got to start doing roids I figured right around 65. So that's another 21 years. If you go back 21 years, what is it? 2012 21 years. That's 1991 it doesn't seem that long ago to me. Yeah. Shit. I'm fucking, you know what the next guys, you guys, you guys in your twenties, by the time you guys get to, you know.

Speaker 3:          00:41:10       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:41:10       Cause if you go back another 20 years, that'd be 1971. And when you took roids back then, like literally your balls, they turned to dust. You had like c Cup titties and uh, you know, you turned into a fucking Werewolf.

Speaker 3:          00:41:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:41:28       Women did. Women turned in a wherefore Werewolf and guys became like these fucking psychos. Like women had like those Merlin Olsen beards and then guys just became these Adonises who look like, you know, had like, they had no balls anymore and they had tits.

Speaker 1:          00:41:48       They, they look like if, uh, who's that guy in the fucking Chicago bears? Like if Mike Ditka became like a transgendered person, that's what she ended up fucking look alike. And now you know, you can't even tell, look at Milky Cabrera. That guy didn't look like he was on anything. So I figured by the time the people in their twenties you guys get there, it's going to be fucking over. Like how good you guys are going to look. It's going to be another 60 years of them practicing facelifts. All right, the probably cure baldness, they're not even gonna know. You probably going to get carded at fucking 68. And that's going to be like the new thing with like checks, like the new lie guys are gonna tell. They gonna tell chicks that there, I'm legitimately 28 years old and then one day you're going to forget to die your pubes and she's going to see a couple of fucking silver ones down there. Or even worse white ones when she's down there grabbing your fucking prohibition era. Fucking Dick. She's kind of flipped the fuck out.

Speaker 3:          00:42:49       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:42:50       Calling up cry. Mandy, what's right. I found out he's 80. Well that's okay. He still has another 70 years left.

Speaker 1:          00:43:00       Right. I remember reading one time, this guy that said, these other guys said that the scientists said that the fucking, uh, that the body is actually the body. My Boston accent coming back bawd wide body is designed

Speaker 1:          00:43:18       to live 150 years. You know? That's how, that's how difficult life is. They had to have it designed to live that long because the way nature of beat the shit out of you when you lived in a cave, you could only get fucking 30 years out of it, you know? Oh by the fucking way, not by the way people, this is by the fucking way, which you know that I'm about ready to tell you some shit that I believe in baby. Uh, I'm at, I'm at Logan Airport, Edward Lawrence Logan Airport. I finally learned that. But Logan Airport is a, as named after Eddie Lawrence Logan, who was some sort of fucking a military person who fought in the Spanish American war and that they used to have a statue of him before they had to make the airport even bigger because people are fucked it, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:44:10       so why go there? Okay. And I go through security and they got the giant fucking microwave. They want me to stand in with my legs spread doing the Jay z symbol. Right. Well the Sammy Hagar from the 51 50 tour, depending on what generation you are, a business, depending on what side of the tracks you from. All right. This podcast is for, um, I'm sure someone in the village people did it there. You see that reached out to the gay community swell guy. Pat Myself on the back here. So anyways, I say I'm not fucking, you know, I'm opting out. All right, sir. Can you go stand over there? I didn't even like standing over there. I used to work in a fucking dental office when I would take an x ray, somebody's tooth, one little fucking thing. And we put that camera right up to the side of the jaw.

Speaker 1:          00:44:59       We've put a led vest over all their vitals right down to their dick or who ha. And then I left the fucking room, stood behind a wall that had lead in it and I pressed the fucking button. Now I'm supposed to stand there. You know, like I'm just going into prison. They do everything, but you have your bend over and spread your fucking ass cheeks. I'm like, I'm not fucking doing it. And I know what people are saying. Well Bill, you talk on his cell phone, right? That's fucking radiation. You fly in an airplane, right? That's fucking radiation. I understand that. I am getting radiated throughout the course of the day in the way I live my life. I understand that. Okay. But I don't need to get extra radiated. So if there's a way to opt out, believe me, if there was a way to opt out of flying on a fucking airplane, a viable way, aside from just saying, fuck this business, I'm going to buy an old bus and just drive around and that'll be my miserable life, I would do it. But the fact that I can just stand there for an extra five, 10, 15 fucking minutes, you know, and rather than stand in that microwave, I could just go over and just have some, you know, sort of cute male person, pat down my ass with the back of his pants,

Speaker 1:          00:46:26       the sensitive areas. Uh, I would much rather do that. Okay. And then, you know, people giving me shit about it, saying it's stupid, it's fucking pointless and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Well, so anyway, anyways, I met Eddie Lawrence, Logan Airport, Edward Lawrence, and um, I'm standing and I'm waiting, you know, and whenever you want to get fucking padded down, they wait for fucking ever. They'd make it take extra long. I'm convinced that they do it just so you just say, fuck it. I'm going to go into the toaster. All right. But I don't give a shit. I was get to the airport early because I know the game that they're running over there. Oh, the lovely Nia. Everybody. Oh, are you? Come over here and talking to the microphone. How you been? We couldn't hear you last week. Oh, I've been great. Thanks for asking. Great to be back. Are you reading from a script? Oh, who just woke up? I am. Great. Thank you for asking. Where's the Real Nia? Who is a sexy robot that was replaced? Listen to this shit. I'm telling you this story about, you know, I always opt out of doing the Jay z thing where they radiate everything but you fucking taint at

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       the airport, Jay Z. Yeah. You know what? You're fucking, you have your hands like the whole aside. Oh, isn't, isn't that what it is? Yeah. So, um, I'm standing there waiting, right? And I'm staring down some baldheaded Douche. Who knows? First of all, they always have some chick there and she just goes, you know, what are they, what are they, what do they say? A male. What does what they say? Male pat down or whatever they say male support. I'll five. Whatever the fuck they say. And it's typical chick voice where it, it can, it can only carry what? What is, what is that? You guys are good at yelling. Yes, we are like, no one hears it. No one hears it. All right, go ahead. You know I've got the microphone away. Yell male support aisle for yell at. I want to hear it. I want to hear it.

Speaker 2:          00:48:16       So that's good. That has a sense of fucking her. Just say all right then. You know what? They don't put their fucking Hartnett. They just go a mail pack down. He's screaming like there's something going down or whatever. Yeah, but you got to communicate. You've got to communicate to those bald fatties guys down there. We're gonna put the back of their hands on my ash there. Well they, they don't, they don't get it. They have a whole little system that they're talking to each other that you use fucking side. Do you want here? Not Yours obviously. All right, well listen to this shit. Listen to the shit. Wait a sec, let me, let me get to the point. Timeout. Timeout. Get another microphone. Get another microphone. Hang on a second. We're actually going to pause the podcast, the podcast. All right, so the magic of hitting pause or something I never do on this thing. Actually hit pause there. Uh, so anyways, this is the deal. So I'm going through security. Yeah. After all these people

Speaker 5:          00:49:09       [inaudible] you already getting rid of each gene anyways man.

Speaker 2:          00:49:12       So why not stand there and have literally have your entire body budget tank lit up, right? So fucking standing there and this lady is going to nail supportive, you know, and I'm like, they're not hearing you. They're not here. I know that. She goes, sir, could you stand over? There I go. I'm going to stand right. And you'd watch my wallet. Okay. You can stand right there. All right. So anyways, this fucking, this Asian kid comes up. Fat Asian Kid. One of the rare ones. Why? Why? Like like, like, like, like a white elephant. Why is that relevant? Because Asian people in great shape, they eat great. I don't know what it is. There were fucking awesome shape. There's every once in awhile you see one, you see a fat age and you're like, Holy Shit. Right? I don't mean like he's a fucking did it on purpose to sumo wrestle.

Speaker 2:          00:49:57       This is just a fact. Sumo, sumo, Samoan, whatever the fuck it is. This fat Asian kid comes up and relevant to the story, but it is for the comedy. It is. Oh, I see. Alright, sorry. Come on. Listen, I trashed waspy fucking white people on this. Oh, you did? You're talk about Nantucket. Yes I did. Oh boy. Oh boy. Yeah. See you just hate him. Hate anybody. I don't have hate in my heart. All right, shut up. Listen, so this, this, this, this person. This fat comes up. All right. And The lady in lady, she goes, hi. He couldn't even here. He goes, he's like, what does it, hey. He's like, what? And I want to be like, how old are you? That's what the fuck she's trying to say. And he goes, 13 and she goes, all right, come over here. And she had them go through the old school one.

Speaker 2:          00:50:48       Yeah. So basically you want me to stand in something that could kill a 13 year old. That's what the fuck I'm supposed to do. You know why the white way on the way out on the way back twice. Two Times, two times that four times a month I'm going to stand in this thing that can kill a 13 year old. I'm sure I can't kill it. Maybe like can affect his like um, puberty or his growth or something. I think women that is Dick. I have a dick to what? Cause my Dick's old now you're taking old 30 grown. Your shoulder are like down between your knees cubes. No one cares about it anymore. Like it's just kinda like out of commission. I think women can avoid that full body thing by saying that they're pregnant and they won't let you go. They won't make you go in there if you say that you're pregnant.

Speaker 2:          00:51:37       Women always have the, I'm just a girl excuse that's not get out of this a girl twins that guys have to do. But stick with the thing here. If that fucking thing. How old are you? 13 get over here at him from getting like chest hair or something. But you, yeah, you're old. Like they don't care about you. It's the youth of tomorrow that we're concerned about or there you go. I sat there and I, I I man, I almost, I'm not even, it's, this isn't about me whether I feel like I'm older, not, I know I'm old, I'm talking about bed. Um, I almost high five myself.

Anyways, I came in to the office where I work on Friday and my boss came up to me very angrily and said, you up to something staring in his face. See he voice, legal zoom. You get off from under this. Um, he goes, I didn't know what the hell he, I don't know what. I didn't know what the hell he meant. So I said, no. He said he'd been watching me. That's what he basically that you walk in on a Friday, you site for your weekend. This guy comes up and goes, you up to something. You say no, and he's like, I'm watching you and walks away. You just have to sit there and take it right. Slink back into your God damn cubicle. He goes, I found out later that everyone in the office thinks I fucked the secretary. Mary. I didn't, Ooh. He goes, I didn't, I asked, I asked Mary about it and she said that she made it up. Don't guys usually do that? He goes, I thought it was sexy.

Speaker 2:          01:01:27       Oh Geez. Jumping right into this one and then they really fucked. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:01:32       I had always admired Mary from afar and thought she was a good match for me. I really want to date her, but I fee you want to date this girl. Just put her on the desk and Banger. You're already getting fucked over for it. You might as well this isn't the mother your kids do. This trick is a psycho. Stop it already.

Speaker 2:          01:01:51       What? You are such an asshole when it comes to let me finish. Let me, let me let me show or asserting her sexuality and you're such a fucking hypocrite about it because he'll love that shit. Okay, so don't sit there on like some sort of moral high horse. This is the mother of your children. This is how women should act. Madonna and whore like you know what I'm saying? I had done, yeah. Just say bitch, please bitch please. There we go.

Speaker 1:          01:02:16       All right. Coming soon to a podcast. That's right. When are you going

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       to start the bitch, please? I'm going to start and I got a lot of shit going on. Yes, it's coming soon. The bitch please podcast. Yeah, my own and my own podcast and you should. You should. Now that I've said the name, you should definitely go out and start the website or anything. Anyways, he goes, he goes, I really want to date her, but I fear that if I do, my boss will fire me or otherwise hurt my career because he is strongly against office relationships. What should I do? All right. First of all, right there. That's why you need to get out from underneath this dick, because he's literally saying, who can fuck who this guy is on a total power trip? That's a normal policy. And workplaces, they frown on interpersonal relations up to something. I'm watching you. That's a total. Now j Edgar Hoover Shit.

Speaker 2:          01:03:00       That's like, oh, go to HR and talk. You know what he should have done? He should have kicked him in the balls from behind when he walked away. Get that nice sound. Yeah, that nice sign of a foot hitting the, the MC hammer part of the selects. So Mary, Oh, you just tore me a new fucking asshole. This is what I'm talking about Mia. What? That chick is fucked in the head. Why she made, she made a joke of inappropriate joke that got around absolutely asserting yourself sexually is that she just comes up to him and asks him out or whatever. I don't have a fucking problem with that to walk around. You know what you want to talk about fucking hypocrite. You're a fucking hypocrite. Why? Cause if he sat there and he said that he fucked somebody, he didn't fucking the office. How would you look at that?

Speaker 2:          01:03:42       Uh, exactly. Okay. This chick is doing, she has some sort of, she has some sort of, this chick is a fucking psycho. You don't have to go that far to be like they're a psycho. But I gave you did you do me? It's a major red flag. It's a decent point because the Afa man said, oh, I could down to me it's a decent point. Stuff. Pat me on the fucking head to break Goddamn head and I gave you a fucking example and you, you, you actually shut you off for half a second. Which is not an easy thing to do. I am saying that it was a good point. Put your eyebrows down. All right. Now your eyes. See what you did. That's classic female shit there. See what you did. No, no, no. Your behavior. Why do, why am I said what happened for your classic overreaction and like, you know, because you assumed that me saying that this chick is a fucking psycho.

Speaker 2:          01:04:28       You immediately assumed that I was, I was saying that women can assert themselves sexually. Okay. And then I turned it around and I gave you an example. I am pointing, you're away. You better put it away. I'll do the Bill Clinton fist out of not have sex in proper relations. Um, because bill about, let me finish. All right. Then I gave you the example. What if some guy said he fucked you and he didn't fuck you. What would you think about that guy? Always just asserting himself sexually. Is he hot? What's the, what's the stuff you suck? Suck on with the joke. All right. All right. All right. Yes, I get your point. I get your point. Yes it would. No, no, that's not good enough. What do you want me to say? Cause you're going, I get your point. That's a decent point. You Pat me on the fucking head.

Speaker 2:          01:05:11       I made a great God damn coin point. After you sat there and you flipped out on me calling me a hypocrite and all this bullshit. You want your new little bitch please fucking rant. And I came back. Now you actually understand where I'm coming from because you fucking leaped off the got you just took a little thing and you ran with it because you watch, we tell some jokes for fucking 10 years. Um, I mean you're right. I am right. It would not be and it's killing me to say, okay, if we're got to do that Fellas, that's how you do it. You don't let them warm or the way out of it. That's what she did. She tried like three different techniques of patting me on the head. It's decent point. And then you did the other thing when you knew that I was right.

Speaker 2:          01:05:49       Then you put your eyebrows up like, yes, you're right. Like I'm being an overbearing asshole because I know when one of these things, because I said, I said it was a good point, so I don't know what more you want from me, but yeah. Do you remember you don't remember your Newt Rockne speech she gave fucking 90 seconds ago about an asshole. I was screaming and yelling and all that, and then when you find out I'm right, you go, okay, that's a decent point. You don't think that that's, you know? Yeah. I think it's me giving me be like if I took my barefoot right now and I just know she right in the face with it and then you went over the side of the bed, hit your head, started to cry. This, you said that I was wrong. And I said, all right, you're right.

Speaker 2:          01:06:27       Maybe I pushed it too hard. This rights. You're right. That should not kicked you. All of this is besides the point. The point is he actually likes this woman. No, he's trying to figure out what he not, no. See once again the last second, she tried to warm her way out to just see that. Anything, I'm just trying to get back to the top aside. The point, it is a beside the point. You just read me the riot act and you will fucking wrong. I don't know that I was completely wrong. I don't know. Why aren't you making eye contact anymore? I don't think that I was completely wrong. I just think that you brought up a good point that I hadn't considered passing hatred. Of course. What else do I have to judge you on paths, Beth course. I judge you. I'm not saying that's wrong.

Speaker 2:          01:07:06       You. My entire life is judging people on past behavior. Okay, but when you find out you're wrong, you just say, yeah, you know what I was wrong, which I do and you never give me fucking credit for when? When do you ever say I was wrong? Whatever. You do something where I didn't know. You come in and you snuggle up beside me and you make a little joke or you like to try to get me wrong and I'm going to work on it. No, that's not what happens at all. You'd try to cute your way out of it and like charm and do a little funny dance and hey everybody, I'm Billy. Okay. You know what is? You know what? And that's some of the times I do that. I do admit that when I'm seriously fucking wrong, what I'm saying, I see wrong. You do apologize. That's true. And I say, Oh, we'll work on it. Right? What'd he go? Jesus Christ. It's like police fucking teeth. All right. Female question about anal. There's, there's a nice segue. Wait, did we even give that guy advice though? Or do we just go off on our own relationship? Here's the advice. Uh, don't date this girl. If you're going to banger. I mean you're rolling the dice because then she's going to be a, okay, lastly, go with a joke. Right now. I really am. Oh, that's true. She might blow up your spot cause she's already

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       talking out of school. Yeah, that's a good point. This and this guy has the problem that I have is that when he makes a fucking loony bird who's fucking all about it, you just fucking, you. You can't, you can't, you know, you just, yeah, that's like a, that's literally uh, that's like a second degree like Dick Black belt to be able to walk away from pre pussy like that. And I sorry that I'm being crass. I've just one running out of time here. I'm just trying to get to the point here. Followup was a virgin, not a virgin anymore. This is before the female question about anal. I wrote, okay, this guy got fucking late. Hey you broke your cherry. I wrote in a few months back elaborating on my situation. Remember this 20, I got a lot of versions calling in uh, writing, uh, as a 21 year old virgin, uh Oh, I was going to make a really bad joke there.

Speaker 1:          01:09:10       La. I've got a lot of virgin typing in on a semen stain, keyboards. I know it was gross. I, it is funny to me in my head. All right, sorry. I wrote it a few months ago. I helped this person a few months back elaborating on my situation as a 21 year old virgin conservative girlfriend where the furthest we went was oral sex as well as subsequent hookups with other girls only stopping there. Um, so you kind of get blown. I don't really consider that a virgin. I just can see you like how I was going to say you like it, Dah, Dah, Dah. You're not out in the field. You know, you just come, you, you go to bed every couple of innings. I don't know though, but is that guys deliver like not a virgin if he gets blown, but a girl, is it still a virgin if she just gets EFA guidance goes down in our, because then her hymen isn't broken.

Speaker 1:          01:10:05       No, no, no. As a guy, you're still a virgin until you banged a girl. You've got to in there and a woman, you're still a virgin slash kind of Horry if the other way around, I don't have time to get involved in the debate anyways. Um, as well as subsequent hookups or the Gobbler Blah, blah. This was when I asked you whether telling a girl that I was still a virgin before slash during, during, during, quite as, I don't know what that means. Fornicating was a good idea during, does this jolt your memory? Absolutely it does. I actually lost my virginity 30 minutes before my actual birthday with a girl I'm currently dating go. So yeah, it's not like I was a fucking whore. Anything, uh, you will write about telling a girl about my sexual experience or lack thereof. She was actually totally fine with it. Of course I'm not a bad guy. Gave this guy some advice that worked and we shouldn't Fry's that. I was a virgin, which I guess I should take as a compliment. Absolutely. It means you probably kissing a nice rubbing it tidies the way she liked it over there. Um, anyways, I'd like to thank you for that as a small part. Uh, it

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       may, uh, as small of a part as it may have been, it still helps. Well, there you go. So what is good now, if I could follow this up with another short question out, me and this girl been hooking up pretty frequently in, I'm going to have some dirt question here. All right, here we go. Now he's going to get technical. Not, I'm just fucking on. How do I improve on that? Um, is that disgusting? Um, and the one issue I have is that I used, I have to use a rubber. You did say safe sex is like boxing, keep yourself protected at all times. Uh, unfortunately when I do put one on I can't feel shit and therefore tend to lose my erection erection after awhile. And it's not like she is in hot or anything. Uh, cute Asian. That's number two with the Asians. I know one fat Asian, one Q one.

Speaker 2:          01:12:04       Now number one, what is wrong with saying she's a cute Asian? Nothing. She's a hot chick. How dare you say that? She's good looking and describe her. There you go. Um, stop talking for condoms were number one. Have you ever encountered issues like this? Yes. And how would you go about solving it? Uh, is it actually my fault? No. Cause what? You know what it is, dude, you're used to fucking mouth on Dick contact and now all of a sudden you put in the Dick. Oh yeah. Your, your, your condom on and it feels like you're, you're in the abyss. This is what you're going to get used to. It jerk off with the condom bond. This stuff that you could do don't jerk off for a while. You have to get used to the sensation again. It sucks. But I'm telling you he could get those thin ones though.

Speaker 2:          01:12:49       The real thin lambskin or whatever. And I could run through that x ray machine at the fucking airport to no, I'm telling you this is the greatest thing you can do now that you're fucking, but I don't really get this kid some advice. Get some different kind of car. I'd like to experiment with different condoms. No. Trojans are super thick. No, there's other ones that are, oh, this is what you want to do. Okay. Okay. Well in this day and age with Greenland fucking melting and the water rising in New York. Okay. You, you cannot, you have to where you got to fucking go all out. No, I'm saying he should wear a condom. You don't get the one that does the fucking thin one. This thing too, you can wear condoms. Still get herpes. I still don't understand all that happens. Is it on your ball?

Speaker 2:          01:13:29       Big Oral. If you shaved your nuts that day and then you fucking against it, I have no idea. It's a risk of getting something. That's just how it goes down. So this is the thing, dude, uh, right out of the gate, get used to fucking wearing condoms. I can't even fucking tell you how psyched you are going to be. You know, if this doesn't work out, you have a one night stand. As much as it sucks, there's, there's no fucking better feeling. The end when you walk out knowing that you wore one and oh, this is what you always do after you have sex, you go, okay, you know, you act like, oh, I got to go throw this thing out. Right? And then you go and you put your Dick in her sink in flux and you scrubbed that fucker and then you walk out that need to put, use her face towel. Oh Man. Get the fuck out of there. Or you know what else it could do and you don't fuck whores, which is hard.

Speaker 2:          01:14:16       You know what else you could do if he's in a relationship with his girl, he's a virgin. I don't know what her sexual history is. They could both go to the clinic together, get tested for everything wrong, everything across the board and then still wear a condom because you have no idea what the other person's going to do. You can be with a sociopath. You don't have time for this. Don't fuck that. Fuck all of that. But if they're in like a committed thing, you know the 21, the 21, she's going to run into one of these, write it up. 80 year old guys that's has fucking 70 [inaudible] 70 years again, he's going to fucking talk him into going down on his fucking grows. Babe Ruth Dick. Uh, female question about anal. This is the last one. I got to see this. I gotta get Outta here. Um, my husband keeps jokingly bringing up the subject of anal sex. The funnies.

Speaker 2:          01:17:37       okay. I thought that's the one person you would want to do it. Well, no, you do it with it. With that fucking dig back that says she's already banging you at work. Okay. That's who you do it to write on a desk. You fucker in the ass musher face into the card catalog and then you know what the card catalog, whatever the fuck they got nowadays. That that's how you do it with, that's it. Okay. That's the podcast for this week. Um, oh, I got it real quick. One from, well if I'm a lady, uh yeah. So,

Speaker 4:          01:18:07       okay.

Speaker 2:          01:18:07       I Dunno. I Dunno what to tell you. It's like, you know, get 95 pounds. He has a giant Dick. What, what do you, what are you going to do there? I have no idea. You know what I would do? I would call in doctor drew show and have them, uh, I would say I'm going to pass up. You throw? Yeah, I'm gonna I'm to send that one up. The up the up the, what'd they say? What'd they say in the precinct? Send that went up the up the ranks. They uh, you know what? We don't have time. No, no, no, no. Really quickly if you, I don't know what city you live in, but if there is a sex shop near you, they normally have like these anal sex workshops, like taught by women or whatever and a couple can go in, you pay a little bit of money and they like, they talk you like, they tell you how to do it so that it's gentle and it's not freaking out.

Speaker 2:          01:18:51       How do you see you could do that? How do you start that? Wait, wait, wait, wait. I understand that. If she wants to get it when you go into a sex store and they're fucking in there, but how did you get there? Where are the anal sex shop? Like open mics, like where do you start? Like you're sitting in a cubicle and like you know where I think I would make my millions in New York City people how to take their big Dixon and that little white sand city. There was a place called toys and babe land and they gave all kinds of workshops how to give blow jobs, but how do whatever what's you're missing? Introduce SNM into your relationship. They all have these things but you're missing the point here. What is the point is is how do you become that fucking person? I don't know.

Speaker 2:          01:19:29       That's what I'm saying. Where are the open mics? I Dunno. You probably see a good gig. You want to sit there and talking about Amy, you're acting like a bunch of hotties I going to cry in or you work in a sex shop, you learn about things and then you just become an expert. You study it or whatever. You talk to people and I know you don't even know what you're talking about. You literally were looking up at the ceiling, sort of shaking your head like idea or out of this guy. Probably just, yeah, it just have a parachute and you land on the store and they say, Hey, you want to talk about dicks? Humble, female breadwinner. Hi Bill. I'm, I'm one of those ladies who usually takes too long to tell a story. So I tried really hard to make this quick. This is actually than most of the guys, so

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       I appreciate it. Uh, I make three times more money than my boyfriend of 15 of one and a half years. Sorry, 1.5 years. Jesus Christ. How career-driven is her 1.5 years? Let me sure that she's making more money. Um, I have zero problem with this because money is not a big issue with me. It's a tough economy and he's very hardworking. Lately. This seems to be more of an issue for him. Of course it is. He makes a bigger deal about going out to eat and took a weekend job so we could see each other less. Um, he has told me that he is ring shopping and even though I've told them many times that I don't want anything fancy or expensive, he counters saying when I show my friends I'll be embarrassed and he wants to give him some really nice yeah. Any advice on how to convince them? I'm not a material girl now what you got to do is support the guy cause there's, you got to understand that as a [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          01:20:58       guy, like going out and earning a living, that's, that's what we're there for. And when we're not doing it, not only we can't do it at that time because we don't have a job and your fucking doing it, no matter how cool you are, it's totally fucking emasculating. It'd be like if I could all of a sudden have a fucking kid and you

Speaker 1:          01:21:15       get pregnant and I was over there, fucking nursing a baby is creepy as that example. I'm just saying, you know what I men, men want to be the provider that's like in their nature. So no, that's our job. It's our job. It's our fucking job. It's the same way that women like when you're with a woman, if you get in too good a shape, they get fucking insecure. Like they don't like a lot of women. As much as they liked those shredded guys, they don't want to be with a guy that's in that go to fucking shape cause then they're like, fuck, now I have to be in that good of shape and I can't go to those cheese fondue, lava fucking things. You don't stick my tongue in it with a glass of wine and pontificate about sex in the city or whatever the fuck it is. You brought stu. Listen, you want to, oh my God. You want to like, uh, those are absolutely disgusting by the way that she's come on. They sit, they stick in the, she's calm. That's gross. It smells awful. Terrific. Yeah, I don't, I don't like fondue. You only fondue? No, that's weird. All right. I went to a fondue restaurant. It's my like feed. I would just say, listen, you got to support this guy. Just say to the guy, just say, listen,

Speaker 2:          01:22:21       I get it. I get it. You don't have a job right now and it's fucking hard for you. And, uh, I have 100% faith that yet you're going to find another job. We're going to have a great life. And you know, you don't have to buy a ring right now, but when you get your job and everything, you want to go out by me. If I totally respect the fact that you're thinking about me being embarrassed or on my friends, just support the guy, that'll be fine. Yeah. That's all you gotta do. Just support the guy. Yeah. Because right now, no matter unless he hears that from you, he's just going to automatically think that you're thinking that, you know, he's not a provider and he's not a good guy. He needs to hear it from you. The same way that when Yell Lady, maybe put on a few, you got to tell us she's still looking good. Right? Why

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       are you looking at me like that? Because lately I've been slipping. That's the podcast. Oh my God. No, I was actually thinking like, I'm given a good advice. Maybe she'll play, she'll pleasure me later. Um, all right. Just left it at the good advice. You know, you could have not asked the question. You could have not shown up. Come down here.
