Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's the Monday morning podcast for Monday, December 17th, 2012. Um, I am emotionally exhausted from watching that Patriots San Francisco game, uh, last night. How insane was that game? Unbelievable. Um, unfortunately it was exactly what I thought. Although the comeback, I was amazed by that, but I, I've, I've, I've gotten so much shit from a couple of friends of mine who are patriots fans because they feel like I'm not a patriots fan anymore because I keep talking about how bad our defenses and they are one of those people who like, you know, they like dress like drew Bledsoe when they watched the game. You know, those people with it, this such fucking fans, the no matter what's going on you, you can never say anything what they deem is like negative rather than constructive criticism. But you know, I feel vindicated because last week when we beat the text and say was sitting there going, yes,

Speaker 3:          00:01:06       what are you going to say now you're ready. Yeah, it did take stock, right?

Speaker 2:          00:01:14       Ima tell him the whole fucking time, but the afcs week, all right. Fucking week. The NFC has been far superior to the AFC for fucking years. All right. But the thing is you got Brady and Bella check and a little bit of luck and that's how we got to the fucking super bowl last year. We still almost won. But that doesn't change the fact that our defense, all right. Oh we do good against the mediocre teams and the so called good teams in the AFC. But I'm telling you right now, we'll be lucky if we get by the Broncos. Okay. You let up fucking 40 something points to a second year quarterback. I can't help you. Why is my voice cracking? Cause they've been screaming at the fucking TV for three hours watching the damn thing.

Speaker 3:          00:02:01       Um, yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:02:04       If the 40 niners actually had a quarterback, they would have scored like, you know, a more experienced quarterback. I'm not shitting on their, uh, their guy there with the soul patch, whatever the fuck his name is at a Boise state who could have played baseball. Ali. Yeah. But he had one fucking Shiny Tatiana. I mean, fucking times. You can tell that story. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:02:22       yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:02:22       I mean, he missed like two guys who will have like three steps on our safety.

Speaker 2:          00:02:28       I Dunno. Just fucking brutal. But I knew it was going to happen. I knew it was going to happen. You know what I mean? I mean, I hate to say it, but if you know, if the 40 niners had Aaron Rodgers, uh, drew Brees of fucking, you know, Eli Manning get, Oh, it's, we can't compete with, that kills me. Kills me. I don't what the fuck we have to do, but I, you know, we're all right. We're all right in the box as they say, but I swear to God, our fucking pass defense stinks. I don't, I don't keep it just, it was, you know, it was enjoyable watching the 40 niners celebrating and stopping around and doing that because they're doing their job, all that dumb shit that every fucking athlete does. Now, you know, you fucking get a layup for two points and then you go scare children than the front row.

Speaker 2:          00:03:19       Like, like he had this like, you're actually in 300, you know, why don't you just fucking bend over and blow yourself at that point. I really enjoyed watching the 40 niners do that and then get that deer in the headlights look is Brady calmly does just dismantled. They're fucking awesome defense and tied it up and scored like 34 points in like a basically a quarter. I did enjoy a 31, whatever the fuck it was. I did enjoy that. Watching them have to stand down and actually having seen that glazed over look. Oh and now the phone rings. Now the fucking phone rings. Could anything else be going on with this podcast? Just seeing that glazed over look on Jim Harbaugh's face w was enjoyable, but I fucking love that guy. And I loved the, uh, the fake punt call and the first quarter on your own 40. Was that when I was awesome. I had to respect it. It's like this guy is going for the juggler, but I mean those guys honestly could've been up like 21 nothing after like six minutes in the game. Um, yeah. So they had golf desert, right. Nice big bucket of ice water to the face of delusional patriots fans. That's, that's what it is. That's where our defenses against, um, the elite teams, you know, sucks. I'm not happy about it and um,

Speaker 4:          00:04:44       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:04:44       Yeah, I'm not fucking happy about it. I just wish I, we could, we could. Oh, for fuck's sakes. With your fucking, you know what I hate about this fucking stupid phone besides everything. So you have the fucking thing on mute. It's still makes noise. Like, like I get important phone calls, right. Clia. What am I the president? Does it really need to do that? Even when you fucking put it on silent mode, it still vibrates. I guess I could just shut the thing off. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:05:14       I never, I never even thought to do that. That's great. I worked that out. Oh yeah. Of course. My password doesn't work on the fucking computer. This is just going to be one of these days. You and I know he's going to be one of these days is I took my dog out for a walk and um, she took a shit and I'm like, Rappaport I went to pick the fucking thing up right now and I had my headphones on and as I bent over to do it, my headphones fell down and almost landed in the pile of dog shit. And uh,

Speaker 4:          00:05:39       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:05:40       Rather than laughing it off like somebody with rosy cheeks would, um, I'm a cynical bastard, so I took that as an omen on how this day was going to be and uh, it's lived up that way.

Speaker 4:          00:05:51       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:05:51       I had a bowl of cereal this morning. I almost fucking died.

Speaker 4:          00:05:55       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:05:56       You know what's funny? The lovely

Speaker 4:          00:05:58       Nia was literally maybe seven feet away in the other room and never checked on me.

Speaker 2:          00:06:06       Could give a shit, you know, and you know what that is? It's like we've been together when you've been with somebody as long as I have, they just, it's not like they want you to die. It's a combination of two things. They, they, they just tune you out. So I could've been in there talking to her about how, you know, my headphones almost fell into the dog shit this morning. Or I could have been almost choking to death. Either way. She doesn't even hear it. And then like subconsciously it's not that they want you to die, but they not fatally. But if you could die for like three hours, you know, I, I don't think that they would be upset. You just Sorta, you know, drag you over and put you behind the couch and just, you know, fantasize about being single again for like three hours and then you, you, you know, you wake up like in one of those, those movies with Kiefer Sutherland was that movie call shockers wasn't clockers.

Speaker 2:          00:07:05       That was likely. I don't know. I don't know what the fuck it was. Anyways, this is what happened and I was eating a corn checks. I'm a big fan of the checks family. All right. This isn't some sort of subtle advertising I'm trying to put in here. Okay. This, this, this is coming from my heart, not my wallet. All right. I like to check serious. I'm not into rice checks. Man has nothing to do with World War II or Vietnam. Okay. I just don't like the taste of them. Okay. I'm not coming at you with some red state, Shayla. I ain't, ain't nothing. It got fucking raw Sienna and after what happened over there and a of the DMZ, I'm not coming at you like that. I just don't like the taste of that one. I either go corn checks or I go week checks. So here's the deal. Yeah. You know what I noticed the other day is this, this morning when was, I was almost choking to death on my cereal. Was all cereals kind of the same color. You know what I said? It's all sort of fucking, just different kind of browns and that weird. Isn't that weird? That that would go through my head is I'm almost Diane choking. That fucking bad eighties comedian analogy went through my head that well. It might've been my last thought.

Speaker 4:          00:08:15       You know?

Speaker 2:          00:08:17       Well like it's like a topic you'd hear on like NPR. All things considered today we discussed the different shades of Brown and breakfast cereals. I don't care if you're eating rice checks, corn checks, we checks rice krispies or corn flakes. The all too familiar off color bandaid brown. I'm an old things considered. Um, we listen to NPR. Neil listens to that shit. She's such a fucking nerd and she always has it on. And um, I and you know, I don't know, there's really no good radio stations out here as far as like playing music out here in la. I don't know why. I don't, I dunno what goes on out here, but evidently, uh, these, the two bands that they play, they play in like, it's still 19, the early nineties. They play ice cube all the time. Bad Ass when he come to my town, bad app, like, like, I don't know why they play it. Like they play it enough like you think he did, he died or something, you know, and then, uh, and then they also play the, uh, who were those guys?

Speaker 5:          00:09:26       La La la La, la La. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:09:30       Oh, but that, that held at bay obey, whatever the fuck. They are pretty fly for a white guy. They play them all the fucking time.

Speaker 4:          00:09:36       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:09:36       You know, like everybody's still walking around in flannels going, hey, have you heard the new Pearl Jam man? Um, anyways, so here's the story.

Speaker 4:          00:09:49       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:09:49       I basically, I go to get my fucking box of corn checks. I pick up the box and Mila and notice it's pretty light. You know, pour it in, get a full bowl, and there's like an eighth of a box left. Now I could be a Douche and put the box back and give Nia false hope. Oh, I want a box. You know, I want a bowl of cereal, you know, and then she grabs the box and she feels the likeness. Then that panic comes in, you start to sweat like all, fuck, you start pouring it out. Come on man, keep going. And there's only an eighth of a bowl left, you know, the Douche puts that back in the cupboard. The gentlemen, the refined individual like myself, you just say, all right, I'm going to have a little more serial than I usually have. So that's what I did.

Speaker 2:          00:10:29       All right? And I start eating the fucking cereal and I'm wolfing it down cause I know the podcast is a little bit late and I'm going to get a bunch of shit on Twitter, right? So I get about halfway done with my bowl. I take the box of cereal and I pour that last a thing. And you know the deal, the last part of the box, that's the most dangerous part of the box. You know, you got half of it, half of it's Cyril and the rest of it's all fucking powdered. So all the power goes on my, on the top of the cereal, I started eating the shit and I'm doing that, you know, eating so fast you're, you're eating an inhaling through your fucking pie hole. You're doing that shit. And I had a half a spoon of powder and the other half was the cereal and I inhaled the shit and I, my, my throat just closed off.

Speaker 2:          00:11:14       I thought I was gonna. I thought at the very least I was going to pass out to the point I was, I was debating as I'm coughing and hacking away and Nia is completely ignoring me. Um, I'm sitting this Ponant, I'm thinking, should I make them loud noise in the kitchen or should I run to, you know, five steps to the bedroom. But then I'm thinking what that, but like take up too much oxygen. And um, I basically was choking on this shift for three straight minutes in Nia. Didn't move a fucking muscle, didn't move a goddamn muscle. And when I finally, I finally realized I was gonna live, I was so pissed at her that, you know, you know, like after you get done choking like you, your voice is like, it's like turned down to one. So you're trying to talk just like, you know, open, you know, that type of shit. I basically said sarcastically. Thanks for helping in the, I was just choking for three minutes voice and all I get for neo is like, oh, I'm sorry. Are you okay? No. Is there any way to start the fucking day? I don't think this was that even funny. Was that even remotely amusing to you? I don't know.

Speaker 2:          00:12:27       I almost died this morning. I'm just how I don't care if I'm funny or not, Cleo. Um, all right, let's do it. Let's do a little advertising here and then I'm gonna talk to you about this 30 for 30. I watched called broke. All right. Um, where are we? Oh, we got a new, we got new advertising this week. Everybody cascade studios, cascade studios on Santa Monica Boulevard out here in Los Angeles. We got a local ad here. Um, this is based a rehearsal studio pull. If you're in a band basically, and you need a rehearsal space. Cascade studios is the number one place here in Los Angeles. This is where, and when I got out and I played drums and I tried to pull off that bottom stuff, trying to get my foot is fastest. His, this is where I go. I go to cascade studio 66, 11 Santa Monica Boulevard. If you want to go down there with your whole band, they got a five piece drum kit in every room with high hats, two guitar amps, bass amp, pa system with three mikes.

Speaker 2:          00:13:24       Symbol rental is only five bucks. Um, or if you're just a drummer like myself and you want to go down there with your iPod and beat the hell out of a kit and have a great time, he charges you 15 bucks for an hour.

Back to the podcast. So I was watching, um, I was watching one of those 30 for 30 [inaudible]. Um, and they did this whole thing on, on athletes going broke. It was really bad. There's a ton of people who've gone broke. Most of them didn't want to do the documentary. Like why would you, you know what I mean? Hey, you want to talk about how you completely fucking blew it.

Speaker 2:          00:15:41       Now I don't, I don't, I resent the fact that the end of your documentary, you're going to be running a list with my name on it. You know, that's what they had at the end of it. But, um, I was watching it and I felt bad for people, but after a while it was just the same fucking story over and over again. And it's as much as I want to say that if I was 21 years old and you gave me $1 million, that I would probably fuck it up too. I just don't think I would.

Speaker 4:          00:16:14       You know,

Speaker 2:          00:16:16       I love these guys. You know, I got a check for $55,000 and I saw hummer. I had to get it talk to the guy down to $49,000 and it's like if you just got a check for 55 fucking grand after paying all the people in your life, your agent, whoever else she got, where else has taken a geolocation, whoever else takes a chunk out of that check, whatever's left out of that, the government's going to come in and take a 40 40% where if you get a check for 55 grand, I mean you already got left 20 grand and he just went out and bought a $50,000 Hama. I Dunno. But anyways, the point I wanted to make was at the end of it, you have to show and all these people going through this hell, they have this guy that who's supposed to be evidently some sort of a financial advisor and in the end they were talking about Lebron James going to eat is going to be, he has a potential B other than tiger woods pre divorce, um, a billionaire athlete. And they get like, how exciting is that? And they go, what, what would your advice be to this, to Lebron James on how to hang on to his billion dollars? And the guy goes, he goes, don't blow it. Keep it simple. Count your money.

Speaker 2:          00:17:35       It's what he said.

Speaker 4:          00:17:36       It's,

Speaker 2:          00:17:39       it might've been the dumbest thing I ever heard. And I immediately, I had no sympathy for anybody in the fucking documentary. It's just

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       like, even like, why is this guy on this document? Who the fuck is that guy? That's the guy who manages money that's, hey, I got $1 billion. How do I hold onto this? Where should I invest it? What do I do? What advice do you got from me? Oh, it's simple. Don't blow it. Keep it simple. Count your money. All right, thanks a lot. I'll be, I'm out of here. Fucking ridiculous.

Speaker 2:          00:18:20       We, it was basically, it was an hour and a half of listening to morons telling you what the fuck they bought with all their money. And I don't know, I felt bad, but there was another part. It was just one guy that I really felt bad for because it was the hurt that he had. You know, like Andre rising was on the thing and he's sitting there in his suit, was sunglasses on, mirrored sunglasses during the interview and just right there, it's like, yeah, dude, you, I'd give you another million if I had it. If I gave it to you, you'd, you'd, you'd fucked that up. Why? Because you're sending here in a shiny suit with fucking sunglasses on. Look like Michael Jackson at the award show. Right. So anyways, the one guy who actually really bothered me was, if you ever watch it, it's 30 for 30 broke. There's a guy who's sitting there and he's just ever so slightly lean to one side and the just the, the pain in, in his voice. He's just just sitting there going, ah, I made $75 million in that career, add meal at Mercedes,

Speaker 1:          00:19:42       got a homo, got me a boat.

Speaker 2:          00:19:47       It's just sitting there looking down on his knee, like playing with his pant leg, a jet ski and, and you just, I had to look away. It was fucking brutal. But the rest of it was just a bunch of knuckleheads. You know, I felt bad for Bernie Kosar to cause burning coals are, uh, you know, I don't know. It seemed like his dad took his money. I don't know what the fuck it was. It was, it was, it's, it's a really, it's a, it's a great, all the 30 for 30 is are awesome. This one is awesome, but they just should have had a couple of, they did, you know, something that's not true cause they had like four or five guys. There was only two people who really came off like morons, but they were just so, they were such morons that I felt it tainted the whole thing. Ah, that is, might have been the dumbest thing I ever heard. What is your advice? Don't blow it. Simple. Count your money. All right. I'm sorry. Was that even remotely fucking interesting? I love watching those 30 for 30 is I got to watch the Bo Jackson one. Um, there was just something about that like, you know, for as much as they showed

Speaker 2:          00:21:06       the amount of people that went broke, there's been so many more people in the league that didn't go broke. So really weren't you just showing a select group of morons, you know, who we're going out and buying a corvette and stick in a fucking hot tub in the back of it, you know, living week to week on paychecks. I mean, I just don't think that most people are doing that. I would really think that if, if I was barely on the team, I would be saving every dime. I know I would. I've done that in this business. I've never fucking,

Speaker 2:          00:21:45       you know, it's common. If you're in any sort of entertainment, you know it's coming and the day it's coming is the day you think that you're good and that you made it. That's when somebody comes in with the hood on and the sickle and they just fucking Chop Ian half and then that's it. And then you're that guy on TV. Fucking lean into one. But that's why that guy was leaning to one side. They had a twist his torso back onto some fake legs as he sat there going, I got me a cabin, bought a mountain. You know, you think that if you had $75 million that you could never anyone, that shit goes in and when, when, when it goes, uh, they, there's nobody around.

Speaker 2:          00:22:27       Um, anyways, I gotta wash it a few more times. I feel like this comp, there's some sort of comedy in there. I just don't know if I got to it today. Uh, anyways, I've been drinking like a fucking mad mad lately. I really have to stop. I just keep going to these, these frigging Christmas parties, you know, and they got booze there. So yeah, we, you know, something maybe that if I got like a zillion dollars, maybe that, that that's what I would've would've done would've gone out and become a complete frigging booze bag. Now what the fuck did I do with my notes here? Oh, for Christ's sake, I swear to God, this is just, it's not my day.

Speaker 2:          00:23:06       It's not here. It's not there. It's not here. It's not there. What the fuck is it? There it is. You know what? Let's read a question here. My brain is suffering from lack of oxygen here. Let's just read a question. College do wet. Hey Man, I'll keep this question short. I got my eye on this broad. She heard me playing music in the dorms, knocked on my door. I invited her in and we talk for a bit. Jesus Christ. Dude, I don't think you need any advice. That sounds like you're already there. She just heard your talent and came knocking on your door. What more does she have to do? You know, pull up her dress and backer weigh in anyways. Oh, she said she wants to do duets together. My fault, I didn't realize she was also in the business. Uh, Jesus. Um, anyways, second time I wasn't playing music, but she knocked on the door and started talking about duets again. Not sure if she wanted to play then or what, but I was busy studying so I invited her in again and we talked yet again.

Speaker 4:          00:24:17       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:24:17       Dude, you're only going to get so many at bats where it's going to be weird if you finally fucking make a move. All right. What are you doing? I I, this is, where did that come from? Um, anyways, I figure I'll invite her down.

Speaker 4:          00:24:33       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:24:34       Uh, I have a single dorm with her instrument. Once the workload, it didn't really sound good. What I figured, I'll invite her down. I have a single dorm with her instrument. Once the workload, after holidays, debt dies down and just kiss her and see what happens.

Speaker 2:          00:24:53       Oh, this is just a band geek. All right. What are you doing? Hey, come on over and, and bring your, your bassoon. And then she's going to walk in and you just gonna kiss her. Please tell me there's going to be some sort of preamble of making her laugh or something. You at least don't try to light a candle anyways. He says, how does that sound? Any advice? I've had almost no interaction with her before or after this, by the way. Uh, okay. He goes, love the podcast. Keep it up. You're a great guy. Just kidding. Fuck you. All right. Um, what, what, what do you want to do with her? You just want a banger. If you just want a Banger, well, you have to do is just, do you have to stop acting like a gentleman?

Speaker 4:          00:25:41       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:25:41       And I don't mean that in some sort of gropey disgusting manner. What I mean is you have to, you have to not just say the shit you thinking. All right? Just say the shit you thinking and say what you want to do. All right. If it's one of those, but if this girl, but if the girl is like, uh, I dunno, she's more walled off. I don't know what the fucking word is. I think that brain cell died when I inhaled the power powder this morning. Um, she's more walled off that. I don't know if she's like a nerd. I don't know what to tell you. I never was able to interact with female nerds beyond just talking to them because they would just so fucking, I don't like everything was like awkward. So after that I was just like, you know what? I could literally rub one out faster than it's going to take.

Speaker 4:          00:26:34       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:26:35       For me to figure out just how to get her glasses off.

Speaker 2:          00:26:41       So yeah, dude, just invited down fucker instrument, you know, get the music out of it and just say, hey, you want to come deal? I'm watching a movie tonight. Just get her over there. All right. I Dunno. I don't know where you've gone with the conversation so far. If it's going to seem weird, if all of a sudden you sit in there and you're Hugh Hefner robe, but that's the vibe I would have tried to break. If you just want to bang her thing, that's what I would do. If you want, if you want to date this girl, then I take her out. But if you just want to bang her, you, you, you have to start acting like a fucking, um, CRAs individuals sooner rather than later. You know, you know what's a good way to kind of bring it into this sex thing is if you're watching TV and just start talking about some fucking girl on the TV, how hot you think she is and blah, blah, blah, blah. Hopefully that'll spin her around and be like, why? What do you find attractive in a woman? And then you just fucking blah, blah, blah, blah. Well, let's take a look at you. You kind of get your fucking Teddy's air and sitting in my phone, right? And then you're in.

Speaker 4:          00:27:43       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:27:44       right. Does that work? I owe but works for you, sir. Does I think you are a great guy. You're a great guy. Cause you know, you're sitting in a dorm and you're, you're practicing your fucking Piccolo. Um, all right, next one. Actually, you know what that reminds me of a long time ago,

Speaker 2:          00:28:03       long time ago, I went to this girl's dorm and she wanted me to, and I wanted to, and I didn't know how to fucking bridge that gap. And we sat on her fucking single bed for like till my ass fell asleep and I finally ended up just, I just finally just said, I have to just get out of here. I don't know how to, you know what I mean? I don't, I don't know how to fucking crack the safe. So I should have been a little more empathetic. God, I was pathetic. I was, I was fucking pathetic. Not Saying I'm, I'm, I mean, I think that's been a through line in my life, just being pathetic. But it's sort of morphed, you know, every time I feel like, oh, you know, hey, I can kinda get that settled. Then there's a new thing, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:28:45       like say podcast. I feel like this is a pretty pathetic attempt this week, don't you? Well go fuck yourself. Hit the stop button. I don't give a shit.

Speaker 2:          00:30:40       Oh, I know. You know what? I was going to make a, I was going to try to make this shepherd's pie this week. Every once in a while I get like really into cooking and it's usually when I have a doubt downtime in this business and this time of year I always take a, I always take some time off, you know, I don't like working over the holidays. I did enough of those fucking awful, uh, New Year's Eve gigs. You know, you're in some God forsaken fucking strip mall in the middle of nowhere. You all by yourself. You go on stage, you got like a 50, 50 chance that they already handed out the fucking noise makers.

Speaker 2:          00:31:16       You standing up there eating your balls and then they make you do the countdown, stop your act. Did I talk about this last week? I feel like I already did. I'll fast forward to this shit. And then you gotta somehow, then they want you to continue your act after the countdown. It's still worse fucking thing ever. And everybody's hugging and kissing and that type of shit. You're standing up there by yourself, like the absolute, you know, cliched entertainer, you know, sitting there crying and your Tuxedo. So anyway, so I usually, I take this time of year off and I, uh, I start, I always get, I get into cooking, Cleo, stop staring at me. Come here, stop staring at me. So anyways, um, I'm a big Mario Batali Fan, right? So I made these braised short ribs that were the fucking shit. I went out and got myself a Dutch oven, you know, which because of that joke is really been ruined.

Speaker 2:          00:32:12       There's no way to fucking say Dutch oven and cooking without somebody thinking about somebody farting under the blankets in Poland. It over your face. But I made these braised short ribs that have been the shit but niggas on a fucking diet. So she's not eating any of them. So I ate like half a pig myself. And I don't think my belly is ever been rounder or wider. I have like one of those toddler stomachs, you know those little beer bellies that they have. You know what I'm talking about? Cleo, Cleo, do you want to finish the rest of this podcast? Do you hold and get off me? Fuck, a dog is so God damn needy. Um, all right, let's continue on here with the questions for this week. If I can find it on my computer, of course I can't cause this is just how my day's been working. I should have known I, she, you know what? I should have gone right back to bed. The fucking, the second

Speaker 2:          00:33:04       my headphones almost fallen dog. Shit, isn't that, isn't that like a sign that you should end the fucking podcast? 33 minutes and this is brutal. All right. Douche boss. Dear Bill. First I want to say, uh, but, but it, but it, but B, um, I have all the episodes of uninformed you did with the teen idols sensation on my phone and listen to them every day. But on to my dilemma, I'm 18 and work at the finish line at the mall and my boss is a complete Dick. Of course he is because he's managed managing a finish line at the mall. You're 18. You got your whole life ahead of Ya. He probably fucking married the wrong person. He starting to go bald. He's standing there wearing that referee uniform going, hey, we're not you about the chuck Taylors. You know, I told you I was talking stock them up in the back or whatever the hell. They say, don't you just want to choke them with his whistle? Did they make you aware of whistles there or is that athlete's foot or is that the foot locker?

Speaker 1:          00:34:02       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:34:02       I dunno actually, you know something I have like the, the worst collection of dirty white boys sneakers you'll ever going to see in your life. Every time I look at my sneaker collection, I pictured, you know, Keith Robinson or Patrice, he was still alive. God dammit. I'm just trashing me. You know, it's funny about how much I Miss Patrice is the amount of times is when I, I, I miss that guy.

Speaker 1:          00:34:33       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:34:33       How the fuck do I tell this story without fucking out in somebody's, somebody told, gave a fucking speech, you know, or whatever. Went on some rant about the state of comedy and everybody thought it was fucking amazing. It was just one of those times where I wished Patrice was in the room when this person was, fuck. It was probably, you know, was, was talking about it. That's when I missed that dude the fucking most, I missed him. I missed him when, um, Penn state, that Sandusky Guy, when he did, when he gave the fucking interview.

Speaker 1:          00:35:07       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:35:07       You don't have that interview when he, he, I think he's talking to Bob Costas and they would go and do you, uh, do you like little boys? And he was like, do I like little boys? I mean, I enjoy their company and somebody says, do you like little boys? This one fucking answer. No, no, I don't. Okay. And Fuck you for asking me that. And this guy sitting there like, you know, like trying to work out the math in his head. And as I as creepy it was to watch that when I watched it, I was actually laughing, thinking of Patrice watching and laughing hysterically and how he would somehow get 25 minutes of material.

Speaker 4:          00:35:53       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:35:54       Just out of that guy trying to figure out how to answer that, that question. And I swear to God, like, I dunno, we got this benefit coming up for him and as just putting the thing together, it's just like going through him dying all over again. It's been fucking brutal but good in a good positive things because everybody bought up the tickets, but it's just been like this fucking, ah, the finality of it. It's just something like on that I even talked to all my buddies, like we bring him up like he's still around and we'll talk about it. I'm like, he's still around for five minutes before you just start looking at the ground. It's just fucking awful. I really, I really do not wish that, you know, I don't know why you would, but in, it's not been worth even stating, but I really don't wish this on fucking anybody cause a, it's really just something when I'm 80 will, if I'm lucky enough, you know, the, we had been drinking lately. Let's us be a little more conservative. I'm 68.

Speaker 2:          00:36:50       It's just something that's still just going to be, I've just, I'm coming to an acceptance that it's going to be as sad when I'm that age as it is right now and up. So I figured I talk about that to add to the already not hilarious podcasts that I'm doing this week. I'd add to the losing a close friend fucking vibe. You know, who's getting hurt? It really wasn't a funny fucking week out in the world. Uh, alright. Douche boss. Where are we here? Um, the finish line, he is one of those guys who, okay that his boss is a complete tech or it and he says, uh, he's one of those guys who got bullied all through high school and now actually has some control and takes it out on me and the other employees. How did you figure that out as that you just like psychologically breaking the guy down?

Speaker 2:          00:37:36       Do I have to tell you something? There's nothing worse than watching somebody uh, abused their position of power. Harvard, however small it is. You don't like this guy right here has no right getting mad at like an athlete who goes around being a dick because it's like, dude, you're doing the exact same thing. You just can't run a four 40, but your, your head space is the exact same place as some, you know, Egomaniac fucking athlete. You just, you just suck at sports. So you sell the gear to people, look to go play sports. Anyways, he says he even steels out of the register at work and holds the special release shoes for him and his friends. He's 30 years old. And tries to fuck the 16 and 17 year olds who work there. Oh my God, this guy is a character right out of the movies. You know, I worked with a guy like this. I used to work in a restaurant in a long time ago. Sorry, I'm trying to get the check cereal out of my throat. Um, I used to work with this guy and the, basically like four or five of these guys bought in to a restaurant

Speaker 2:          00:38:47       in the one guy who is going to be there every day, who's always the guy who ends up stealing the silent partners, always get fucked. His, his, his buy in was, he had all the equipment for the kitchen. So he, he, he, he had some other failed restaurant and he got all the equipment and uh, but anyways, this guy was a coke head. He used to steal out of the register. He used to fucking, uh, try to bang the, uh, not the Maitre d, The fucking, uh, maitre ds, whatever, the fucking chick who sits you down the hot one, you know, who dresses classy, that skirt fucking going right over a shapely ass. Yeah. He used to try to fucking bang them all the God damn time and when they wouldn't give it up, they get fired and then he'd be bringing a new one. If that one ended up banging him, then she stuck around. It was brutal. So anyways, he goes, uh, he harasses me and others calling our phones repeatedly telling us to come in on our days off and leaves voicemails saying we are ignoring him.

Speaker 2:          00:39:46       Jesus Christ is my fucking day off. Anyways, he goes, recently he got the only cool management manager fired because he said he was stealing. I don't really need this job, but we'd like to keep working here, but don't know how much longer I can take this. Any advice on what I should do would be appreciated. Uh, sorry for it being so long. Go Fuck Yourself. Uh, it wasn't long at all and it just sounded long the way I read. Um, well if you don't need the job, then I would, I would quit. But what I wouldn't do is I wouldn't leave on bad terms. I Dunno. Is it really going to matter? It's not like when you're 30, if you're looking for a new job, you're going to put on your resume. I worked at the finish line because at that point you're going to be into a career. I know you say, I don't really need this job, but would like to keep working here, but don't know. Oh, so you said basically you're saying you like having walk around money. Well, I would just get another job, just get another job. Start the process of getting the fuck out of there. Like nothing you're gonna say to that guy is going to change that guy and all that guy can do is kinda make your life difficult if you're trying to get another job. I at this point your life, just know that like he's at the tip of the iceberg of the awful life that he's going to be living. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:41:09       like just what the, the way he sat in the table. You don't need to do anything to him because he's going to do it to himself. And it would really be bad if, if this guy was just such a negative force, you somehow got sucked into it. I know you probably fantasize about punching him in the face and tell him the guy to go fuck himself. And then the girl that you have the crush on at the finish line walks out arm and arm you guys and you start your own sneaker store right across and you watch him get fired. I know you've probably played that fantasy out of you had a hundred times, but uh, I would just get another job. It sounded like you don't mind working. You're not afraid of working. You like having the money, but you just can't deal with this dose.

Speaker 2:          00:41:48       So this is a great life lesson. You do not need to be surrounded by doses. You have the power, it's your fucking life. Just, he's always going to be a dose, just walk out of his life. Just be like, yeah, you know, I don't need to be around this guy. You know? And then one day when you run into them after you get another job, hey, how come you left it? Just be it, you know, cause uh, I dunno dude, you would just end, don't curse at them or anything because then it gives him an excuse to not see himself and just be like, well, I dunno man, you the, you just kind of creep me out the way you were always hitting on girls who were like 16 and 17 years old. I mean, if that's what you want to do, I mean, you know, that's cool.

Speaker 2:          00:42:25       But uh, you know, I'm just kind of not into that. So, uh, you have yourself a nice evening and he'd just walk away from him. Maybe it'll work out like that. I have no idea. But, uh, I try and get yourself another job. All right. They, that's my advice. All right, here's another next one. Ah, multiple fuck buddies gone wrong. You know what too? Just the fact that you had multiple fuck buddies, uh, it's, it's still a win. You know what I mean? It's still a way you made the playoffs. Hey Billy boy. First Time, long time I got there, I'm going to go to get right into it. All right. Last weekend I got a text from a former fuck buddy who found out that I had slept with their friend before we started hooking up. Oh, you know what? Go Fuck Yourself. All right. You're crushing ass all over the place. You don't need my advice. I probably need advice from you.

Speaker 4:          00:43:16       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:43:17       That's all we, that's a secret goal of, of a certain percentage of guys is like, what if I can fuck her and all of her friends before they all figure it out? You know what I mean? It's sort of like an action movie with your Dick.

Speaker 2:          00:43:35       Can I stick in and all of them before the bomb goes off and uh, and can I get out of town like fucking Deniro and heat before I see all of them coming up with the, how dare you? Have you ever fantasized about doing that? And you were so good. That is mad as they were. They all reminisced about how great you were and then all four of them come over and be like, ah, well fuck he. At the same time, if you haven't had that fantasy, God bless you because you're evidently a way more decent human being than I am. So anyways, with that, here we go. Um, he goes, she sends me. Anyway, let me, let me just refresh your memory here. Last weekend I got a text from a former fuck buddy who found out that I had slept with her friend before we started hooking up. She sends me a pretty heated to page texts about how much of a dog and Douche bag I am for sleeping with their friend then fucking her the same weekend. Yeah, dude, dude, you're a legend. You're a fucking legend. What is the doing? All you can do is just stand there with your hands at your sides. Take the slap to the face and just know that, yeah, you're a hero dude. You banged her friend and and her in the same weekend

Speaker 2:          00:44:53       and you're, you're, you, you don't front a raw, a successful band. I mean, that's, that's, you know, my hat's off to you sir. Hat's off to you. Anyways, he goes now in reality, I had slept with the friend in late May and then starting hook hooking up with the fuck buddy in early September. Oh, okay. So she tried to make it more dramatic. That's still great, dude. You seamlessly made the shift over the summer. You still a hero. Um, anyways, he goes to go into a little more detailed to fuck. Buddy had gone on several dates and fucked once three. Oh. I had gone on several dates with her and fucked once, three years prior when we were both at college, but then shortly after she lost interest and we remained as friends for the next few years. When I say friends I mean the occasional texts and seeing each other maybe three or four times. All right, so what is your fucking problem? What is the rule? Shouldn't this, shouldn't the second one be mad at you cause you fucked the other one first? I don't know. I'll never understand. I never understand. What can any female, if you're still listening at this point, if I have any female listeners at this point, can you explain to me why that makes you mad?

Speaker 2:          00:46:14       You know because I don't know. There was always like,

Speaker 2:          00:46:20       there was always that girl that like, you know when I was growing up, like I can't say me because I wasn't getting anything. I didn't get anything in high school, big fucking goose egg. I would make my, my pussy getting career in high school. I was like the first year the Tampa Bay Buccaneers came in the league and when winless what was the name of their Gary hough. Was that the name of their quarterback? I was the Gary Huff of of Pussy in, in, in high school. Whatever the hell are you, I can't remember the name. His last name was huff, was the name of their quarterback with creamsicle fucking uniform and well had a suit made out of that when I was in high school. Um, I, but anyways, there, there were, there were those girls that like my drinking buddy crew like three or four of them out of the five had all hooked up with her and none of us. For me, none of, nobody was mad. Everybody high fives fun. Great. That's, you know, we thought it was a great thing. I don't understand why they get so mad. You know what it is, is I, I just think that want to, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:47:33       it's a big thing with them then that has to be difficult and you know, and if they, I think they just feel like if you bang them and their friend, they just somehow feel like maybe it makes them feel cheaper that there's just, you're just fucking hidden. It's like you're a machine gun, you just mowed them down. I think that they really want to believe that they're the only one in that area code. You know that they are like a, that it's like gold rather than like pine cones.

Speaker 4:          00:48:14       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:48:15       You got to dig for it. It's a precious metal. They don't, they, that they don't want to feel like they're just like litter in the gutter. Maybe that's what I have. No, I have no idea by I've learned something in this. Fuck Buddy is two words. This guy put fuck buddy together. Um, that's how much he's into sex right now. He's getting, he's literally like the fuck is his gun. The buddy part bent over and it's all one word. They are one. Um, so anyways, he said to go into a little more detail or I already read that part. He said it so fast forward three years and the friend of hers, that's the future. Fuck Buddy said that we should hang out after the sox game. All right, I'm getting lost in this with all my rambling. No, what the fuck? So you hooked up with a former fuck buddy. And so now, okay, so this is when, when, when number two comes in, before you went back to number one. All right, so fast forward three years later. Yes. So she didn't give a fuck. So who she should be mad at is the second one. No, but it's been three years.

Speaker 2:          00:49:18       You know, I really don't think anybody has the right to be mad here. All right, whatever. She said we shouldn't hang out after a sox game. Of course, I see this as a green light because whenever a girl that you really don't know says we should hang out is code for I'm down to fuck. Exactly. Did you hear that? A guy with the fucking bassoon. You got they speak in code. We should hang out sometime. That that's literally, that's what that means. If they say, well do you have anything? You're taking me out. That means they want a relationship. We should hang out sometime. That's what that means. Okay. And I'm not saying 100% just say it. It's, it's looking good. You get waved around by the third base coach. Um, anyways, where the hell am oh for fuck sakes. I apologize guys.

Speaker 2:          00:50:10       When a girl says eight down, fuck. So also anyways, so we end up fucking, and she gets on a plane the next day to study abroad in Europe for the summer. Exactly. She wanted some shoving off Dick. You know, let me get a little last piece of America before I go over to tremendous. Anyways, fast forward three months later and the fuck buddy, all one word says that I should come over some weekend to hang out greenlight. We Bang, it's great. And we continued to do it until the end of the month when I fly back to the place that I now live. So a few days ago I get the heat of tech saying I'm a dog, I'm a Douche bag. And she thought I was a friend, et cetera. I say that there's nothing I can do or say to change what happened. And the only thing that I could say is, I'm sorry if I hurt her and then I am an asshole by my question to you. Uh, Mr no relationship psychology degree comedian is, am I a dog for what I did? No, you're not.

Speaker 1:          00:51:10       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:51:11       You're not in fuck these women who call you up. And use you like a fuck stick. All right. They called you up because they wanted some Dick and you gave it to them. All right? You gave him what the fuck they asked for and then she's going to turn around and get mad at you and then you apologize and say, yeah, I'm an asshole. You're not an asshole. But you know something. I don't think you think you're an asshole because you're out there crushing it. You're just fucking saying what you know this girl wants to hear because probably six months from now she's going to fuck you again. Right. You're not an asshole. You didn't hit on the other girl. She said, hey, we should hang out sometime. Okay. She's giving you the green light. You know what I mean? You're a guy you have to take that. You gotta take it. Women don't understand that because they can get laid every night of the fucking week if they want to. They don't have to have any game did they did it for us. It's, it's, it's work. It's a skill. Okay, so when somebody wants, if it's like you're in the wild, you got a free fucking meal, you're going to take it. You know I learned that in Australia when I was looking at those poisonous snakes and they're like, why does that thing have enough venom to kill 200 mice?

Speaker 1:          00:52:19       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:52:20       Why does it need that much venom? It's cause it's out there in the fucking, the outback and out in the outback. Food is scarce. So if you get a shot at something, you've got to fucking take it down and that's what the hell you did. Yeah. Yeah. I'm a fucking dog. You know? It's like, you know what? Fuck you lady.

Speaker 1:          00:52:38       Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:52:38       I'm a dog then. Then you're a whore. Fama dog. You're a fucking whore. Did I call you up? Did I come around sniffing up your skirt? No, you called me because you wanted some dick and I gave it to you. How about a fucking thank you letter?

Speaker 1:          00:52:55       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:52:55       Did you really should have come at her like that?

Speaker 1:          00:52:58       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:52:58       You really should've. And I got to tell you something. And some fucked up levels. She would actually respect you as long as you didn't call. Don't call her a whore. All right? But she fucks sheet. So w what? What is her relationship with you? You guys barely talk and like whenever she's in a dick dry spell, she fucking goes over to you like your hertz rent a car and just fuck. Just ride your Dick. And then you're supposed to be exclusive and not bang her friend who's cut from the cloth who wants to get plowed before she goes over to Europe. This is your fucking fault. You're the one that should feel used.

Speaker 1:          00:53:34       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:53:34       You know neither one of them wants a meaningful relationship with you. You know what? This is what I say. Just don't even ride it back and you know something. Fuck 'em again. Just Bang them again. Do you agree? One gives a fuck. Next time you see her, she wants to give you a dirty look. Just like I don't even react to it. What? What, what a what a fucking what? A bunch of bullshit. And again, I can't believe that. Like you, we don't have a relationship. I'm just gonna keep saying the same thing fucking over and over again. Why don't I,

Speaker 1:          00:54:10       yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:54:10       Let me, I'm stuttering here. Do you know the other day I was watching the, uh, when I was watching the Texans, when the Patriots played the Texans Monday night football, right. And, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:54:23       yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:54:23       some lady at the, at the, at the, I was watching with us and she started giving Bob Kraft Shit.

Speaker 1:          00:54:32       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:54:33       For having like a, a 35 year old girlfriend. And for those you don't watch football. Bob Kraft was married forever, had a family and his, uh, wife unfortunately died of cancer,

Speaker 3:          00:54:46       you know,

Speaker 2:          00:54:48       so she dies of cancer, you know, he stuck by his side, did the whole damn thing. And then now he's got a new girlfriend and she's 35 and women are mad. They're upset about, they're upset by, and I, I don't, uh, I don't get it.

Speaker 3:          00:55:07       You know,

Speaker 2:          00:55:09       if I die of a disease, I don't want fucking need it to be sitting here like some spinster, Guam, go have a good time, I'm dead. I don't give a fuck,

Speaker 3:          00:55:20       you know,

Speaker 2:          00:55:22       let's say I'm a ghost and I'm sitting there watching it, then I wouldn't like it, but I would just fly away. Why would I sit there watching it?

Speaker 3:          00:55:33       No,

Speaker 2:          00:55:34       start haunting them every time they were going to have sex. I wouldn't do that to somebody. I just don't understand why. Like, um, it's not like you went out and got with like a 17, 18, 19 2021 year old girl. She's 35, 35 at 35. If women aren't married, they're freaking out.

Speaker 3:          00:55:52       Right. Date Book.

Speaker 2:          00:55:56       I, I, you know what I love, I just love that they get mad at the guy and it's like, what about the girl? Why is she with them? Okay. If he's some sort of like, you know, oh, he's just there because he wants a hot girlfriend. Then what about her? She's just there for the money so then it works out, doesn't it? I Dunno. They didn't want whenever like shit like that goes on. That really taps into the cynical part of me, which, you know, if you listen to this podcast, God knows it doesn't take. But um,

Speaker 1:          00:56:26       yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:56:27       sometimes I just, I just think that it almost taps into that fuck buddy thing.

Speaker 1:          00:56:32       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:56:32       They just don't want to know how easily that they could be replaced yet. They want you to feel

Speaker 1:          00:56:41       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:56:41       They don't give a fuck if they, if they try and make you feel that way. All those stupid songs, Beyonce, that debt to the left, to the left,

Speaker 3:          00:56:49       you know,

Speaker 2:          00:56:51       that whole song is like, yeah, just take your shit. Get the fuck out of here. I'll have another guy in two seconds. You're, you're that easily replaced.

Speaker 3:          00:56:58       You know,

Speaker 2:          00:57:00       and they, they love those songs. Those songs are, they consider them fucking empowering. But then when they see a successful guy with a, you know, a nice closet full of shiny ties, his own sports team, when they see that he can still fucking pull down some 35 year old ass, they get mad. They start judging his character leaving me and my mom, we had that discussion yet. Why? I just don't think that that stage just, and I'm sure that there was somebody in their 50s and he could, who the fuck wants to get with a 50 year old? Even if you're 70,

Speaker 3:          00:57:39       you know,

Speaker 2:          00:57:42       oh fuck. You know what I mean? You know, you're starting over again. If you got a fucking old car and you trade it in, you don't trade it in on a fucking nother old car. You get a new one.

Speaker 3:          00:57:56       You know,

Speaker 2:          00:57:57       you fucking ride that thing into the ground and then you get to know one. I don't know. I'm just saying I don't have a fucking problem with what the guy's doing.

Speaker 3:          00:58:06       All right.

Speaker 2:          00:58:08       That's it. All right, everybody, if you like, if you enjoyed this podcast,

Speaker 3:          00:58:11       mmm.

Speaker 2:          00:58:13       And you'd like to support the podcast and in a roundabout way, support the wounded warriors project, go to [inaudible] dot com click on the podcast page and click on, uh, the Amazon link. If you're going to buy anything on Amazon. Not saying you have to, but if you've got to buy something, just go and buy it. Doesn't change the price button because you went through my website. They gave me a little kickback and then I take a portion of those proceeds and I give it to the wounded warriors project. So everybody wins. You're helping out the podcast and more importantly, you helping out the troops, then that seems I'm kind of whoring out their plight to increase money that I'm making. I Dunno. There's something wrong about that whole thing. I don't know, do doing a good thing, but that's just the way that whole thing set up. I, I'm almost doing like what the NFL is doing with, with that pink shit, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:58:59       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:59:00       Instead of telling people the foods that they can eat to look to, to, to knock down the potential of getting cancer, they just have everybody running around their dress like a Barbie doll. I don't, I don't get it. And I'm guessing somebody making some money off of it. All right. That's all I'm saying. Um, all right. That's the podcast for this week. Everybody. That's the pod pea w d cast. That's the for this week. Thank you guys so much for listening. Um, NHL Hockey, I have given up on you. They'd had given up on you. I've, I've, I've threatened that I was going to get the, uh, whatever the fuck the NBA packages and they had it for free for two, three days, which was a great idea. And I watched it and I'm enjoying watching the Knicks, my Celtics, and watching the Lakers lose. And I'm just, well, I guess I get the Lakers game out here all the time. Do you know Bill Russel wrote some book basically describing how he made the guys around him on his team better. And I was reading this Bill Simmons article. It was making me sick to my stomach because I couldn't finish reading it because I think Colby is reading it, which would really be devastating because I don't think Colby has ever progressed

Speaker 2:          01:00:10       beyond where Michael j, Michael Jackson, Michael Jordan was in about 1989 when Michael was trying to do it all themselves.

Speaker 4:          01:00:19       And

Speaker 2:          01:00:20       there's nothing better as a Celtics fan.

Speaker 4:          01:00:23       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:00:23       That when Phil Jackson isn't coaching and Colby is just trying to do it all himself, there's nothing fucking better because he's going to score 30 and they're going to lose. And, uh, that's what I love to see. Uh, wouldn't that be ironic if it took a Celtic to teach a Laker how to fucking win? Wouldn't that be something? All right, that's the podcast. Go fuck yourselves. I'll talk to you next week.
