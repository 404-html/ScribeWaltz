Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on is bill burn is time for the Monday morning podcast from Monday, October 10th, 2016 Jesus Christ. Holy Shit. That's what, who else yelled at near Knoxville, Tennessee when they'd running back fumbled the ball and your quarterback is trying to, God bless them. It's trying to pick the ball up. Why won't they fall on the fucking ball? Everybody's just like, oh, I can pick it up and then run with it. Just fall the fucking thing. It's not, it's the shape of the fucking ball too. Even if you fall on it, it somehow fucking squirts out. Oh, he'd die. 1,000 deaths is three. I was, this street thinks that have probably brought me closer as far as sports goes, just generally speaking, week after week, like a bad cigarette or drinking fucking problem. Right. The three fucking plays that get me. I don't know what gets you.

Speaker 1:          00:00:57       I don't pretend to know who you are and I would never speak to me however I am willing to share with you or what the fuck did I just do? There it is. Sorry. I swear to God, I can't get this fucking thing to do anything, but if I brush up against anything, the whole fucking screen disappears. You don't need people who suck at playing video games. You know what I mean? If you play playing like one of those five games, the other guy's kicking your ass. You just start fucking hitting a million of them and all of a sudden like these, these clouds started forming around your guy and he does a little fucking, I dunno, spinning back fist with his foot, whatever the fuck that's called. Right. Um, that's what it happens to me with computers. And then I then I, you never know how you just did it.

Speaker 1:          00:01:38       Everybody was like, Oh shit, what the fuck is that? I don't, I don't know. So anyways, the three things, how's this for controlling my add? I'm going to stick with this year. The three going to get back to it. The three fucking things that just make me die. 1,000 deaths is deaths. Plural. Yes. Is um, cause 1000 is more than one. Stay on target, Bill. Stay focused is not falling on a fumble, dropping, you know, catching a fucking ball run into the end zone, returning upon returning to kickoff, running with the fucking bank. Banks rarely do this. It's always fucking receivers and people who returned kicks, I think they called kick returners for whatever fucking reasons. Reason. I don't understand why these motherfuckers, they get to write to the goal line and then they booked. They just drop it right on the half yard line as if they bet the under. That kills me. Like how many? Like you would think like the first time you saw somebody do that, you'd be like, Oh my God, I'm never fucking, that's not going to be me. I'm going to run to the back of the fucking end zone. Then I'll fucking spike it. I'll drop it. I'll do my little fucking moonwalk. Whatever the fuck it is. All right. The freckled, Fandango, whatever. My end zone dance would be called. I mean on Fandango means, I just know it's an old Kevin Costner movie. Um, okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:00       That and then finally,

Speaker 2:          00:03:02       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:03       My favorite in yours, the prevent defense. The fucking privilege giveaway. The Mill, Allah will give him a fucking 30 yard cushion and rather than them scoring on us on one play, they'll score in five places. But the amount of clock that they're going to eat up versus the points that they're going to score is slowly going to kill everybody in our fucking fan base. You know what I mean? It's really hard to tell him fucking voice. It's really hard to tell [inaudible] that I'm not through puberty yet. It's really hard to tell like truly who was a great quarterback in the final two minutes of the game ever since the prevent defense. Cause I, I think back in the day, I mean I know that they didn't want you to get behind him. They must have done some early version of it, but there was like a few guys that would go down the field. You know, you're Roger Star, she, you, Terry Bradshaw's, Ken Stabler, you know, but everybody else, I mean it was like three or four guys that could do it and now it's just everybody in the league because it did just get, I swear to God, you could put, you could put, I'm going to go a little Mike and Mike here.

Speaker 3:          00:04:05       Don't write down. You could put me under center during the prevent defense.

Speaker 1:          00:04:09       I could definitely, I could complete a fucking pass as long as they didn't know that. It always me.

Speaker 2:          00:04:15       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:16       That that was not a professional quarterback, that this is actually a podcaster slash comedian slash a crafter of shit jokes, you know. Then of course they just play defense, you know, they blitz or whatever the fuck they would do. But if they gave me the respect of an NFL quarterback, I could, I could dump it off. That shouldn't happen on any fucking level. So whenever I was watching that, the Tennessee, Texas a and m game, what a fucking game. You know, I want to say that Tennessee shot themselves in the foot with their 58 fucking turnover was, but you got to give it up to Texas. I mean, they just kept making them happen. You know, I mean, I want to think that somebody on the coaching staff or the volunteers said, hey guys, what's say we protect the football? What's say the next time we gained 80 yards on one fucking play on this team, we talked the thing away,

Speaker 1:          00:05:10       you know, put two hands on the fucking ball. Um, I know that there was saying that yet the turnover's just kept coming. You know, it was just, I dunno, it was fucking him. An amazing game. And um, I have to tell you, coming from a professional sports city, you know, the safe suburbs, as I always say, ever since goodwill hunting, everybody thinks she grew up in southeast. You stole cars, you're good at math and you like apples. That's not me. That's not the guy I am. I grew up in the safe suburbs. There was street hockey dad, there was a, there was little league baseball. We had a great place to get ice cream, you know, not saying that they weren't fucking maniacs, you know, that later got into fight next daily bid people's ears off cause they were biting on the air and that guy would go to push them and then part of the year would come off.

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       I'm not saying that people like that did not come from my town. I'm just saying more so than not, people did not bite other people's ears off. Now you getting towards the downtown area, like the, you know, who knows what the fuck would happen. All right. That's all I'm saying. Anyways, let me get back to this shit. So, uh, coming from a, uh, the safe suburbs of a, of a major fucking city that's a professional sports city, um, I, I can't believe that. I haven't watched called football. Like I've been watching it since 2007, so I'm almost a decade in, but the years that I lost, it's a fucking travesty. I'd watch it a little bit, but I have to be honest with you. If you watch SCC football, if you watch the Verne Lundquist Gary Danielson, if he just watched that game every week. Okay. Which is usually a fucking SCC game.

Speaker 1:          00:06:47       You watch an SCC football game. I'm telling you the NFL [inaudible] this time, this particular time cannot fuck with those games. They're unbelievable. They're just fucking, even even that last week, that was an ACC game that Clemson Louisville game was fucking crazy, man. It kind of helps. This year somebody was bringing up that everybody seems to be scoring 30 and 40 points. Speaking of which, what the fuck happened to the Oregon ducks did like the whole school did the whole team from last year just say, yeah, we all want to be eligible for the draft. I don't know what happened to them. What's going on with you, Cleo? You're all fucking itchy. All right. Just lay down buddy. Lay down. You don't know how to come up on the couch. You don't your idea. You can't just have your part of the couch. You'd come up here and then you just feel fucking, you know, you're all over me.

Speaker 1:          00:07:41       I understand it. I like it. But I've got a podcast too, so go lay down buddy. Go lay down buddy. Go on. There you go. Um, anyway, so I ended up watching the Tennessee game, um, at home in Los Angeles. Now some of you, if you listen to this podcast, you're like, well, wait a minute, Bill. How the fuck were you at home on Saturday? And as they say in the Boston area, why don't you come over on a fucking Saturday as one little consonant in the, it's Saturday. Come over. Well, I don't want to say, um, he was supposed to be down in the swamp at the Florida. Lsu gained that fucking stadium. I've wanted to go there since Emmett Smith played there, I always loved the colors. The blue with the orange helmet. Emmitt Smith was the shit. It just, I just, I've wanted to go there for fucking ever.

Speaker 1:          00:08:41       They've, oh, they've always had great teams. Florida football has always been, it's just my whole, probably since my teens, when Jimmy Johnson, how boys came into fucking University of Miami. Then you had the other guy there at Florida state with Billy Bouton, whatever the fuck his name was, who couldn't feel goal kickers were always wide left and wide. Right. You know, um, I've been wanting to go to that stadium forever. But of course the, uh, the hurricane came in and, um, you know, one of my buddies was saying, you know, early in that week, like, like we get so fucking crazy excited cause that that's like you got, and you got to have this as, as, as a guy when you get older, you have to have that thing that you do. The guys weekend thing is fucking Coney as they try to make it sound as much as it sounds like a fucking beer commercial.

Speaker 1:          00:09:27       Like those are the things and women should have them to whatever it is that they want to fucking go do. I know it involves wine, their own way of getting fucked up and everything and they like, you know, food and all that shit. Um, I like to stand out in a parking lot in the elements eating stuff that I don't really know, uh, what they put in it, like hot dogs and that type of shit. So anyways, we get so excited to go to this fucking game. Uh, my buddy got the tickets, somebody else handled the, uh, the, the fucking car service ticket over there. And uh, I went out and I got the, I got the cigars. All right. I came in, they loaded for bear. I got to hook up. I'm not going to say, oh, whatever, whatever. I had some fucking sticks.

Speaker 1:          00:10:11       All right. I had some fucking just picture every fucking brand of Cuban cigars that, you know, Cohibas party gets partake in over the fuck you say it. Tomato, tomato. I had mono. Christos, I just, I had some fucking tremendous sticks and I brought it up. There was five of us. I was brought, I brought 15 Cuban cigars, right? We could eat smoke one every fucking night and each one was going to get progressively more insane. Start with the mild one Thursday go a little medium and then the fucking, you know, we just, I dunno, we just fucking won a world war. That's the one you got a smoke on the game day game, right. So the beginning of the week we're all fucking amped up with texting each other and everything. And then my buddy who lives on the east coast, cause every on the west coast, we don't pay attention to the east coast.

Speaker 1:          00:11:03       You fucking get up three hours before we do. By the time we have a cup of coffee, that day's half over. There is no, there's no point of even reading the newspaper. Everything has already progressed like another 12 hours. So I didn't pay attention and my buddy texted me, he goes, uh, there would have to be a fucking hurricane this weekend. And I was like, get the fuck Outta here. Right in the game plan was we were flying into Atlanta and like assholes. I, we booked US Atlanta. We were doing a Gig and then we were going to Gainesville to do the show, but like assholes, we didn't book hotels until the last second and already 100,000 people coming in to see the fucking game. There was no hotels. So guess where we got our hotels? Take a wild guess what? Florida city. We got our hotels rooms, Jacksonville, Florida.

Speaker 1:          00:11:51       That's where we were going to go. So we were going to fly down from Atlanta and then pick up a rental car, drive over to Gainesville, do the gig Friday night, drive back, drop off the rental car, go back to the hotel, smoke another stick. Fucking jumped in the car service. Go over there and see fucking a legendary football program and the greatest conference that's out right now. The Sec, right? So I hear the hurricane's coming, so I got right. You know what? They're probably going to cancel bunch of flights. Fuck this. So I get a rental car. I get a rental car. I'll clear. Please don't puke on the rug. Do you need to go outside, buddy? What are you doing? Huh? Was that just you or was that me? That was you. You okay? Don't step on the recording, cleo. God dammit. Just sit down. Just sit down. Just sit down please. Can you please sit down? Sorry guys. Anybody else's dog? Eat Grass. And even if they're not failing, even if they're feeling well, they just fucking eat grass. Why do you do that, Cleo? Huh? Sometimes you've just talked to them. They get so focused on you and they put the rose up. No, no. Go lay down. Go lay down. Do you need to go upstairs? You want to go see mommy? All right. Hang on a sec.

Speaker 4:          00:13:10       Hang on one sec. All right. Can I go see mom? Hold on. Oh, that was a great one for us, but she did a few picked up something.

Speaker 1:          00:13:26       There it goes. That sock. Alright. Anyway, so that was the game plan. So I was like, all right. So you know they're, they're going to be overly cautious. They're going to cancel the fucking flights and Baba Baba Baba. So we'll just fucking drive down. Well, everybody's leaving the hurricane. We're going to fucking drive down the 75 south. Well, so we fucking land and uh, they're supposed to make a decision Thursday at one o'clock and they don't make a decision. So me and Bart, nick around the fucking or in the lobby more excited that they didn't make a decision like, yeah, dude, come on man, this is fucking, this is the south. They're playing this fucking game. They're playing the game. They don't, they don't want to cancel this fucking game and have to fuck him or refund 100,000 tickets and try to figure out when to reschedule their fucking plane.

Speaker 1:          00:14:10       And we got excited and we had hope and then the whole fucking thing it, it, you know, it went up to a category for it and all fucking went to, went to shit. But I got to tell you actually, if I was even trying to drive down to the south, like they evacuated so many people smartly, by the way. I mean, only three people died in a category for, well you know, down in Haiti, like you know, a couple of hundred, they said even more died. Uh, granted we're first world, we have better structures and that type of shit. But you know, back in the day, I mean that would have been us. Like I was thinking about that back in the day. Like you know, when you didn't know a hurricane was coming, I mean you saw like signs, but like by then you only had like six hours to try and get the fuck out of there.

Speaker 1:          00:14:56       What am I trying to say? Long story short is even if we try to drive south, they just completely closed off the southbound 75 at some point. And it was just like all of Florida driving up so it didn't work out. So then we were like, okay, how do we save this weekend? Because my buddy, the one who told us about the fucking hurricane, he had not even left yet. So he's at home with his wife and his kids. He's a total family man. In once a year he goes out, you know, has some beer, smokes a stick. It's just, you know, and he goes, this was the one weekend where his kids didn't have any sports. All right, we got to make it happen for this guy. So we started looking around, where the fuck can we go? The Georgia bulldogs home? No, there in South Carolina.

Speaker 1:          00:15:40       South Carolina is three and a half hours away. Let's fucking drive to that one. And then we find out it got fucking moved to Sunday. Fuck. Can't go to that game. What else do we got? UNC? I just went to UNC and I want to watch him play Notre Dame. Notre Dame stinks. Or is that NC state? NC state was playing them. I was like, look dude, I'm not driving into the fucking Carolina. It's the God. Damn. The fucking storm is coming up that way. All right. What about Tennessee? Let's go to the voluntary. Well, do it right. Let's go to where all fuck. We're in a panic. Who's Tennessee play at Texas a and M Aggies. Great fucking game where they play in college station. Fuck. All right. Who's next? Who's next to Alabama, where they play, who they played with it. They're playing Arkansas. Where they playing in Arkansas.

Speaker 1:          00:16:29       Alright. Auburn, Auburn war. Eagle War Eagle. Who Do they got? Who they got? Mississippi state is sippy state where they play it. Auburn, Mississippi state. It was just three of us standing at this fucking over the sports page trying to salvage this fucking weekend looking everybody was a way, the only way to get to any of the games that we wanted to go to that worn in the path of the fucking hurricane was that we were going to have to fucking, you know, we were like Clemson, what about Clemson? They playing BC. Ah, they're going to kill them. Were they playing Boston College? Shack's right over and over and over. Right. So the only way we're going to get to them as if we fucking, uh, you know, I don't know if we jumped on a plane and I was already not working the next night, so we're just going to hang in Atlanta, then jump on a plane.

Speaker 1:          00:17:19       It was just, it got to be too fucking crazy. But for half a second, we did consider, um, we did consider the Alabama Arkansas game, but, uh, so it didn't end up happening. But, um, you know, what do you, what the fuck are you going to do? It was still, it was still great to, you know, it was cool when I got home, I got to chill with my wife and I got to watch all those great games and, um, I didn't have to be in the path of a fucking hurricane. I wasn't another asshole that the poor fire department had to try to fucking, because I didn't listen to their warnings, you know what I mean? And, uh, so anyways, um, Jesus Christ, that stone was fucking nasty men. My condolences to anybody down in the Jacksonville area, you know, I hope you made it out. All right. As far as I think pretty much people made it out. But I hope your stuff is, our rec has, God knows those fucking insurance companies, you know,

Speaker 5:          00:18:14       they just, Oh yeah, we don't cover that. If you see that shit, that one that spike Lee made about New Orleans where they, like they just were looking at the waterline will cover anything below the waterline there. Like anything above it, it's your fault. It's just like you mother fucker

Speaker 1:          00:18:30       Chris Mad. Like why, why, what kind of people are you, you know, I dunno. Anyways, so can you tell him most of the typing in my password here? So anyways, oh, I got, I got some more iPhone stories for you now at a time for a quick iPhone story. So I got the iPhone seven now. All right. And uh, I want to thank everybody who tried to help me out with even the condescending ones or this new generation people who were saying they were cringing.

Speaker 5:          00:19:00       Me and my boy had to tweet. My boyfriend works at the apple store or an, I work at the apple store too. And we both cringing as we were listening to you talk about like, why, why are you see you're cringing from, I wouldn't cringe for you. Like, if I watched you two geniuses, tried to change a fucking tire, I drive a stick shift as they say you millennials can't do. If that's the truth, I wouldn't crunch. I tried to teach you how to do it

Speaker 1:          00:19:23       cringing. I felt so bad. I was so odd. I really think this whole generation of the reason why they're always using that term awkward is because they were so sheltered that I don't think that they kind of work shit out amongst themselves as kids the way we did. Now, granted my generation was too far the other way. They didn't know what the fuck we were doing. And I think what millennials, there was an overcorrection. I think this next generation they're going to get it right. It's like, you know, he can't have him fucking join. You know, the, those groups where there's all these pedophiles, you know, you know what they are. I am not going to say him. One rhymes with, with the, uh, the rubs louts

Speaker 5:          00:20:08       the rub shouts. You also don't want to, when they're very young, it's probably not good to have them take a,

Speaker 1:          00:20:17       uh, I can't even say it, right. A Herati class, um, you know, shit like that. They're the kinds of places and then you can just say church groups, church groups, and one of the big one, you just, you just can't have them fucking, you know, but you have to let him play outside. You got to let him solve Shit, you know, interact with each other and shit like that. Like, you know what I mean? Like I think we went too far the other fucking direction and I can say that having never had a child. So anyways, um, somebody told me that, you know, when I, when I sat there and counted all my contacts, I didn't realize, and this is all shit that you guys can laugh at me about, but I know there's a lot of you, especially in my generation, do not know this.

Speaker 1:          00:21:00       If you scroll down to the end of your contacts, it'll tell you how many you have. Um, I was off by one, I said one 13. I had one 14 who knew who the fuck knew. Um, I, and by the way, if you didn't use the cloud, uh, getting all your contacts back, not a big deal, not a big deal. It's just as you need the person's number. You're like, fuck, I don't have the number. Who Do I know that knows him? He just, you know, by then you have that person's number and you gradually put it all back together again. It's so, it wasn't as bad as I thought. And then somebody gave me a great suggestion and say, well, there's, there's, uh, these places you can go to that they, they can retrieve lost data or whatever the fuck that, whatever the computer term is that.

Speaker 1:          00:21:43       So I might try that with my phone. I have not turned it on since then. I'm going to try sometime like Tuesday morning, hope that I can turn it on and grab a couple. Um, you know, the guy who used to work on my truck, he moved to Arizona and uh, he recommended this great place here in California, the tune it up and all that type of shit. And I lost his fucking number and cause he's a crazy car guy. Like his website's still has like a fucking California number, so I should probably just give it a try. But anyway, so, so anyways, so I had to get the iPhone seven cause I, I fucked up my phone. I've got it all wet and shit. And um, so now this one's waterproof, so they had this little fucking umbilical cord off of it. And I was sitting there going, there's no fucking way, I'm not going to lose this thing.

Speaker 1:          00:22:28       I have to be on my best behavior with this. So I was literally carrying that little cord around in the iPhone box with me while I was on the road because I was too paranoid to even leave it into the phone. Cause I was afraid I'd go to put my pocket pop out. I wouldn't know. I don't know what. So, um, I somehow make it across this country and back. I still have it. Um, I went back to my house to use my gym, you know, I said finishing up the fucking kitchen, you know, um, and I had it there and I went to grab a few things and I dunno, I get back to the place that I'm renting and it was just gone. It was gone. And I started to have a meltdown and I was just like this drive, she wife nuts, don't do it, don't fucking do it.

Speaker 1:          00:23:16       And I tore apart everything, couldn't find it in the house. I drove back to my place, I couldn't find it there and I just said, fuck this. And I drove over to the apple store and somewhere over there I just got into this fucking zen place. I was like, dude, this is 100% your fault. It's not Steve jobs fault. It's your fault. You should just left the fucking thing in your phone. I'm sure you can pick up the phone and fucking shake it. And I'm sure nothing, you know, I'm sure it probably doesn't even come out cause they'll probably already knew that that was going to be a fucking concern. So I drive over there, you know, I pull in, I just said fuck it. I valet my old Prius dirty as shit right now because I still have to get the dense taken off from that fucking road rage.

Speaker 1:          00:23:59       Cunt slammed in the person, two people behind me. Um, so I just got that thing has got dense, I'm going to get pulled out. Why get it washed? So it's, it's really looking bad. So I pull in and the valley place at the mall, they go like, yeah, what's, what's your phone number? And I'm just like, yeah, none of your business. I go, I don't give out my phone number. That's what I used to say. Now I just go, I don't have a phone cause they're just going to call you. And it's just, it, just all of those things, by the way, all of those phone numbers and all of that Shit, I'm telling you, it all gets bundled and it gets, it gets sold. There was a lobby, there was something, a lobby, there was something, something going on in Washington where they, what, what they were saying.

Speaker 1:          00:24:32       What I was saying much more intelligently and written down on paper saying that you ought to get a piece of it and something's going to sell your information. Shouldn't you get a cut? Right. 10% something. I'm sure that got shot down. But anyways, uh, so I just pulled up and I just say, yeah, I don't have a cell phone. So then they just take your name down and there's always ways to get around it. You just say, yeah, no I can't do that. Right. So I go into the apple store and I walk up to one of the geniuses and I said, yeah, Hey I need the little fucking umbilical cord. And they said that right there over the, over there on the wall. And I just walked up and I grabbed five of them. Okay, I grab five of them and I grabbed this other cord where it was, you know, where you can plug it into your phone and someone else can also plug their headphones in while you plug your headphones in and you can both listen to the same song.

Speaker 1:          00:25:16       And I did that, cause whenever I'm on a plane and he's always like, listen to the thought, it was a great thong and I was just like, I'll get that one for her, right? So I walk up to one of the dudes with the fucking iPad and I just say, yeah, Hey, I wanna I want to fucking, I want to buy these. Right? So they're all looking at me like, what the fuck? Right? Why do you have so many? It was two geniuses and one of the, one of the people who just trying to buy some shit there and it's one of them finally goes to me. He goes, I gotta ask Ya, how come you're buying five of these? And I was like, uh, because I know what kind of a moron I have. And the dude was like, what? I go, everybody's a moron, so you've got to include me.

Speaker 1:          00:25:54       So you've got to figure out what kind of moron you are. So, uh, I'm the kind of moron that's going to lose at least four of these in a year. So I'm getting five. And they all fucking laughed. And I joked to her night somehow is able to joke my way through the whole fucking experience. I kept it light and I, and I didn't lose my shit. Uh Oh. Except when I got into it, that one guy, I forgot when I was driving back, this guy came barreling up the street and I, and I live on a street where it's one of those streets where it's like, it should be one way, but it's two way. And he came flying up and I was rushing over, so I just had to slam on the brakes and just kind of gestured, like really do it and it back up.

Speaker 1:          00:26:31       And then he pulls up alongside me and he's big fucking Jaguar and he goes, he goes, yes. Is there a problem? He said, I go, I go, yeah, I tried to stay calm. I go, yeah man, I got you. You're driving too fast through the neighborhood here, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. He goes, I go, hey. I go, you know, it's a one way street. He goes, it isn't a one way street. I go, yeah, but what the car is parked, you know, you know, I go, you coming through here like 30 40 miles an hour. He goes, this car won't go forward, which I don't really know what that means. Won't go 40 on this street. I have no idea. I was just like, dude, this kid's on this street. And then I lied. I go, dude, I have a kid just trying to make my argument better.

Speaker 1:          00:27:06       He goes, I've got three kids. And he holds up the fingers to like, alright. And then he just said something. He goes, now do you feel stupid? He said to me, he goes, now do you feel stupid? And I so I wish I could go back to that moment and just say to him like, dude, I always feel stupid, but this has nothing to do with that dude. You're driving like a fucking maniac. You got three kids. Yeah, I bet they don't live on this street. Shit can't. And I was trying, I was trying, cause I've done this before, people on that street, I just speak in a slow turn. It's going to, I got kids, you know, I s line, I say kids plural, just totally lie out my ass. The reality is I don't want to have a head on collision with somebody.

Speaker 1:          00:27:48       So, um, in our last couple of times I did it the, even like the young punk kids and shit, you know what the fucking hats that match the fucking shoelaces. Even there, they actually all, all right, cool. All right. Sorry. You're like, yeah, cool. No problem. You know, and uh, this guy just wasn't having it. He just goes, now do you feel stupid? And then I just, once he said that, I, and I go, fuck yourself. We both drove away. Uh, so that did happen on the way over there. So anyway, so I go to buy all of these fucking things and I'm making fun of myself cause guys, I'm really trying not, I mean, it's funny when I do it on stage, it's not funny when I do it in real life or around the house, I'm really trying to work on my temper.

Speaker 1:          00:28:28       So I was making fun of myself going, yeah. And the kind of fucking moron that's going to lose four of these in years. So I'm buying five. So they all laugh and the guy's like, all right. And I go, what's that going to be like $7,000 and he said, no, it was like 75 bucks or something. If he's little ass fucking wires, five I'm like 25 a whack, a 20 a whack, whatever the fuck it was. But plus I had the other thing. So I go to open my wallet to take out my credit card and what is sitting in the fold of my wallet is the fucking attachment. It couldn't fight. I must've put it in the same pocket. And I just laughed. I go seek my days, look at this. There it is now. Now I got six, I'm a fucking war. And they were just all laughing and made me feel good, even though they were laughing at me.

Speaker 1:          00:29:05       It just made me feel better that, uh, you know, I dunno, I, I gotta be, I gotta learn how to fucking do that man, because I am a, I am a lot, you know, I'm funny. On a podcast. I'm funny for an hour, but after that dude, I, I can be a lot to live with. So anyways, I'm working on myself. I'm actually considering going to speak to somebody and uh, you know, cause I swear to God like two things I want to do. I want to just actually sit down and maybe read some instructions on my iPhone and actually make it something that I can use and computers actually maybe learn about them rather than screaming to anyone who listened about road robots and being microchipped, you know? And then also I would like to, to, uh, if I could just have the same sense of humor I have about big shit when big shit happens, I do not flip out a little shit happens.

Speaker 1:          00:30:00       Like I lost a fucking little cord on my phone. I fucking lose my shit. So if I can just somehow, you know, not lose my shit in the car and the technology thing, those are my two biggest fucking goals. If I could just laugh my way through that shit, I would be, I'd be a much better person. I've been going to be a lot easier to deal with, you know, um, and I'll just go after it the way I go after other shit. I've never really tried to fucking like full on trying to fix my temper the way I try to lose weight, workout, play drums or whatever. By the way, dude, I am in a fucking iron maiden rabbit hole right now, Clive for the whole fucking number of the beast album. It's just, I can't stop listening to it. That and peace of mind. Um, Nicko mcbrain I am fucking uh, yeah, that's where I'm at, right?

Speaker 1:          00:33:00       Today. Speaking of which, has anybody watched a Luke cage yet? I loved that. I brought that fucking dude up. Why? Oh, long time ago on this podcast, man, that was my, one of my favorite comic books was a Spiderman and power man one when it was about the NYP a f fire department. A buddy of mine actually ordered it on Ebay and got it for him. And I hadn't seen that since like 1978 or 80 when it came out. And I watched the first episode. I liked it. They did the usual shit that they do with superheroes. Like it, like, you know, we just sit there like, well, you fuck this chick already. Why are you letting this guy slapped me in the head? They always have them do that shit before they just fucking, you know, throw somebody through a wall. I watched that and I also watched, um, a Westworld, which you want to hear something hilarious.

Speaker 1:          00:33:51       I love that movie. When I was a kid, I loved Yule. Brenner was huge. I mean, nobody said draw like him when he drawl. He did this fucking, he just had the best voice ever. Bad Ass with the fucking shaved head and all that shit. Uh, I love that movie to the point. I remember like 15 years ago, not 15, which will be like 10 years ago, actually called my agent and I said, hey, how much would it cost to buy the rights to Westworld? Because they just started redoing all these things and I'm like, there's no fucking way you could make a killer movie out of that. And of course they came back, it's like, it's like nine zillion dollars. I didn't realize it was a Michael Craig Mu Book and all that shit. So I obviously didn't have the money and thank God I didn't have to fucking rights to it cause I have to tell you, I watched the first episode of Westworld.

Speaker 1:          00:34:39       They completely 100% took it to another fucking level. Updated it. It's, it's unbelievable. I actually liked that pilot better than the Luke cage one. Slightly better. I thought the Luke cage one was the shit. So now I got two new shows back bay to fucking watch. Definitely check those out. And if you want a laugh, by the way, I ran into a buddy of mine, uh, Willy Garcia, who I'm seen in fucking forever.

What's going on here by the way? Uh, was I gonna say, uh, I weighed myself today. I'm in the buck seventies, which is perfect to get my saw. I want to be one 72 or think I'm going to come in about one 75, but that's fine. All right, that is going to be fine. Tipping the scales at one 75 as long as I got that seven is the second number, uh, I'll be all right. You know what? I'll tell you, I walk around weights about two 10, two, 10. If I could eat and drink the way that I wanted to, um, by the way, guess what came the other day? Guess what came I ordered it back in June.

Speaker 1:          00:40:10       My Jaguar came. I fucking picked it up today. I can't, I'd like the Catholic guilt that I fucking had that actually went out and fucking, you know, did this, but it wore off the second I got behind the fucking thing. I came walking into the showroom. Dude, I ordered the color, everything underrated under fucking rated. Ordering a car. You just go to the website, everything that you want. You just fucking order it. It's like blue apron, except it's a fucking car, right? Everything is perfect. This fucking car. Oh my God. It's, it's, it's fucking insane. Um, I'll post Christian, am I going to post it? But I don't want to post a picture cause no one has this color out here. Um, I'll be like that chick driving around in that pink Cadillac got fucking corvette out here. But, um, even Nia, cause she's all like, you know, you know women dude, like when a guy gets excited about some stuff, I swear to God, it's like you're looking at another woman.

Speaker 1:          00:41:09       They always Gail, he's gotta fucking take you down. It's kind of cute and kind of annoying, you know, but I'm mostly annoying and way less cute so I, you know, whatever. And uh, so I come walking in, they got the whole day, they actually backed it into the show room and they put a car cover over the fucking thing. Right. And they fucking did the unveiling. They took it off to it. It's just fucking, it's the fucking, I don't give a shit. It's the British racing green with the black rims black grill. I got that, that the fucking, I had the analog gauges. I didn't get all wheel drive cause I wanted the rear end to kick out a little bit. I got the rear wheel, 390 fucking horses. I'm going to take it over to Galpin to get a new exhaust system on it.

Speaker 1:          00:41:49       Cause right now it's very, are very refined sound. I like a little more of a growl in it. It's, it's dude, it is the fucking shit. It's like what if Steve McQueen drove a fucking, uh, what a Steve McQueen drove a Jaguar and had two kids because it is a four door. Let's not get crazy. Let's not get crazy. Um, dude, it is. It's fucking awesome. And uh, I love it because everybody out here that has a four door sedan either has a Mercedes, a BMW and Audi, and then to a lesser case, Alexis, but that's more of a younger person's car. I feel, uh, those cars are all fucking great and um, I blown away. It's like those have kind of become the muscle cars of today are the four door sedans, which is perfect. He can actually put somebody in. It's like an adult persons car.

Speaker 2:          00:42:35       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:42:37       Oh my God. Like I absolutely love with this car. So,

Speaker 2:          00:42:42       mmm.

Speaker 1:          00:42:43       It was fucking hilarious. And I got the price. They wanted everything. So then of course, dude, I just did, I did everything right. I got these foot, the floor mats are a,

Speaker 5:          00:42:52       they're not like the carpeted ones and after a while they start wearing out and everything. I ordered these, these like these rubber fucking match that looked like the shit. They say Jaguar on them and, and they actually, they're a little bit different color black than the, than the carpet. So they kind of pop a little bit. I mean the car is the fucking shit and it's going to kill me the first time somebody opens a door into it. But I was just thinking of the week Steve McQueen drove that current bullet the way those good old boys drove that fucking uh, 69. What was the challenger? They fucking broke one of those every week. Fuck it. He was supposed to drive it. I remember fast and loud one time they bought a Ferrari like f 40, and the host of frame had been bent and all that and they saw it and they were all laughing. They were just going like, you know what dude, if you buy a car like this, at some point it should look like this. Obviously you shouldn't crack up your car, but

Speaker 1:          00:43:41       they, they're meant to be driven. But, um, I dunno, I can't believe that I have that, that nice of a car. So I want to thank him. Stopped before I keep fucking gloating about the car. Thank you to everybody. Kevin came out to one of my shows and watch my shit and told people about it cause uh, you know, uh, yeah, I wouldn't have that car if you didn't, so thank you. And um, I'm actually going to miss the Prius self. Um, I actually selling it to a, uh, to a friend of mine. So it's got, it's getting a good home and I got to tell you, underrated the fucking Toyota Prius. I had nine years, 85,000 miles on the fucking thing. I changed the oil. I did everything on it. It's a fucking, that thing will go for 200,000 miles easy if the next person changes the oil and and on and all the lubricants and all that type of shit.

Speaker 1:          00:44:27       Just regular maintenance and all that type of stuff, but they're just fucking great cars. He knows. I also found that the Prius Dude, when people, all my friends found out that I was getting a new car. I like half a dozen people go and do what he doing with the Prius. I'll buy it off you. All these comics are loving it because it has good gas mileage. They actually have a decent resale value. So the amount of shit that those cars get mad, they're, they're kind of a good investment. The fucking cheap, the cheap on gas. Like I know the whole fucking time, every time the gas went up and went fucking crazy, I never paid more than like between 35 and 38 bucks is the most I ever paid in the rest of the time. It was about $27 to fill the fucking tank. And, uh, when it would drop really low, like when we would start producing oil and then Saudi, the Saudis would be like, Oh fuck, let's put them out of business.

Speaker 1:          00:45:15       And then they would overproduce, you know, all the fuel and all that type of shit and then it would just plummet. I mean, I, there was, there were days I filled that car up for like 18 or 19 bucks. So, uh, I will definitely, I'll definitely miss that thing. But this thing is just, I'll just fucking, it's a beautiful car. Red Calipers. Um, all right, let's, let's, let's plow ahead here. Uh, I have yet to watch the Japanese Formula One. I feel like I got you guys all excited who are into that type of racing. Uh, we're in a racing, I guess just to say, and uh, and I've just, I've dropped the ball on, um, Singapore and Malaysia and now Japan. It's just because this fucking house, some rent in this guy has like cable from like the fucking 18 hundreds. And uh, I got all the racist tapes.

Speaker 1:          00:46:03       I've watched Singapore. I haven't watched Malaysia yet, where our Lewis Hamilton was going to win the race. And then for whatever reason, his engine just fucking blew up. I have no idea who won the Japanese one. I haven't gone on the Internet. I'm not looking at my Twitter feed. I'm going to watch that tomorrow. Um, and me and he actually knew a couple people that are over in Japan and I was, you know, they having a baby or something. So they have, they're doing a, a baby moon, which I guess is people before they have a baby, they go some foot fucking place and uh,

Speaker 1:          00:46:34       you know, they're in Japan. So I was seeing a knee. It's hilarious. Typical guy, shit, this is typical guy, women shit. Like I say, Oh fuck. They were in Japan, what will text so and so let them know that the Formula One races there tomorrow, man, that he should go. And then my wife's just like immediately just looking at it like a check. Like, yeah, she's not going to want to do that. And I'm thinking like, yeah, but he was fucking guys like in a motorcycles and cars and off road. But why the fuck would you want to do go to a Formula One race in Asia? Are you fucking kidding me?

Speaker 1:          00:47:04       I'm telling you if you, even if you're not into that shit, you got to watch the Singapore, the Singapore race was fucking incredible. Like they do it at night and then after when, um, the city and beautiful, right, granted you're not allowed to do anything and one of the guys spit gum on the street and they fucking detained him for six hours. Um, I think they would just show it off because when I was there, I was like, I heard if you spit on the, on the street, you get arrested. They go, Nah, they'll give you a fine. It's not like that. And maybe they were soft pedal in at the hotel. She would be afraid to go out and go spend some money. I have no idea. All I know is this one of the fucking guys from the Ferrari or Mercedes or somebody spit some guns.

Speaker 1:          00:47:44       They fucking detained him for six hours. Um, but anyways, they ranted at night and that city is, is gorgeous at night. It's beautiful. And then when, uh, who won that one? Nico, when Nico Rosberg won that race, they just shoot off all of these fireworks bed and they go all the fuck out. And uh, so I've yet to see the, uh, the Malaysia one, so I'm going to watch that and the Japanese one tomorrow if I have the time. Um, all right. What else? What else did I want to talk about? What else was a big, oh, you know what I started to watch, I started to watch before I came down and I'm taping this, a taping this Sunday night, I started watching the Trump Hillary debate. I mean, I, I just still cannot fucking believe these are two choices and a dude Trump, I got to give it up to Trump. Dude, that guy's one liners. All right. Just for a politician. Jesus Christ, he's fucking, he kills the guy fucking kills. He's great on his feet. He's,

Speaker 5:          00:48:46       he'd make a terrible president. It's got no idea what the fuck he's doing or what he's even talking about it. It's just like the dope verse, the Devil. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:48:54       You know when I know everybody, all that all fucking, you know, that shit that he said, I just got up, I grabbed by the pussy. I, nobody just does that.

Speaker 5:          00:49:06       I felt bad for Billy Bush. You know, he was just sitting there. He's like, can you sit near some fucking unknown 2005 you know, he's still

Speaker 1:          00:49:14       kind of unknown, you know,

Speaker 5:          00:49:16       by a Billy Bush. I'm going to talk about people who are in movies. He's not in a movie. You know, he's a talking head. Cut The guy a little slack. He's sitting there with the dawn that Don's talking shit. He's talking about women. You know, as guys do, I just walk right, get up and I'd kiss me you. I grabbed right by the pussy. You know, Billy was just like this. Donald Trump, you know, you get caught up in the face. Oh yeah, grandma.

Speaker 1:          00:49:40       He just went along with it. You know, stay strong. Billy Bush. She shouldn't have deleted you to fucking Twitter account. Man, he should have hung in there. Fuck these people. They just, they get mad for like three fucking days. You know what I mean? It's unfucking believable. He's going to get more shit for that. That fucking Hillary's going to get for the Goddamn, you know, classified fucking emails, classified information through her own fucking email. Just some of that all goes into the rug. I cannot stand and I can tell when Hillary's lying to she that smile. She does. She can see it arise when she's lying. Trump is like, I just don't, he's like a fucking cartoon character. Like Alec Baldwin as Trump is more believable than Trump as Trump. That's how fucking nuts this guy is. So I started watch it. Oh Man. Trump had some funny ones. He said to Hilary said, if I was running this country, you'd be in jail.

Speaker 1:          00:50:38       You know, it's funny to really see how hard Donald Trump goes. This is a clip. I don't know if he could still find it that the first time Donald Trump was on Letterman and he and Rosie O'donnell had said something about him and he went off on Rosie O'donnell and he goes, well, you know, she's a degenerate. And like it was just so over, the top. Letterman was laughing just going like, Donald, you just can't go around saying that about people. And he's just like, yeah, no, it's true. She's overweight. He just fucking like, just no filter. Just went right after him. And uh, he hasn't changed at all since he's become a politician. Having said that, like, I, you know, it doesn't mean he's going to make a good president. He's just, you know, I can't get, I can't get past how many overtly racist people love the guy.

Speaker 1:          00:51:29       And that's, that's always a major red flag. You know, what the fuck it is with this fucking election. It's like either got the guy that's going to rally up the fucking neo Nazis, the guy that rallies up the white guys that think that there's something being taken away from him, you know, or you got Hilary, you know, but he's actually, you know, Oh, you've got Hillary who's actually going to, she's going to be in bed with the corporate clients up at the fuck. It's like a lose lose either. You got somebody like rallying up this fucking cess pool of people at the bottom as far as mental. I'm not talking financially, mentally speaking, or you got Hillary who's just, you know, she's going to give them their wars. She's going to let the fucking robots be made and I'll let you know. I Dunno. I Dunno what that, oh my God, he's just fucking and her fucking pants suits.

Speaker 1:          00:52:18       That's the only thing I like about her. I love the pants suit. If I was a chick, I would wear fucking pants suits. I mean, you can, you got to go with it at some point. As a woman, you reach your pants suits age and you just gotta give into it. That's like a man at some point. You got to stop wearing your tank tops and you've got to put on a sport coat. All right. Try to keep the carbs low, do the best you can. You know, at some point you just get to that fucking edge. So, uh, I know a lot of you were like, why didn't you bring up the Tom Brady's back and all that type of shit. Cause you know what, we played the Cleveland Browns, no disrespect but Cleveland browns of where they're at and congratulations to the fucking Indians.

Speaker 1:          00:52:56       You guys look like you're kicking our ass. We're down o two I watched like per Detroiters first at bat and the plane landed. So I missed all of that game, uh, missing every fucking game. Cause this guy doesn't have a god. I mean, this is, this is when I come in with my brand new red sox hat. Um, but I do know the Blue Jays were up two games to none. I don't know what's going on with that series right now. They were up three to two. The last I saw in game three. But, uh, Tom Brady's back. Gronk Kowalski's back. We won, um, buffaloes on a tear there looking good. Uh, I dunno, I just was just great to see Brady back. Uh, it's unbelievable. That whole fucking thing that, that's I'm telling you, I give it 20 years. And then NFL films, when they look back on it and be like, do you think that was fair?

Speaker 1:          00:53:42       Do you think it was fair that one of the greatest players in the history of the game had his entire fucking integrity questioned by one of the biggest scumbags to ever own a fucking team? Um, who basically hired a guy for an in house investigation? I mean, I still cannot, I cannot fucking wait for that. How old will I be? 68. Um, all right, Tom Brady will be 58. All right. 60 minutes everybody. All right. Hey, bill, I saw your tweet about 60 minutes about a row. About the talking robot piece. Yeah. Charlie rose was sitting there talking to this artificial intelligent robot that really moved bad, speaking of fucking Westworld, right? And he asks the robot what its goals were. First of all that a robot would have goals like a person. Okay. And the robot said, my goal is to one day be smarter than human beings.

Speaker 1:          00:54:38       So I tweeted, you know, I basically treated, please unplug that fucking thing. Right? So he goes, um, I come somewhere between, unplug it and fuck it. It seems like everyone knows the machines will be our doom, but I feel like everyone involved and even everyone else just looking on has a, but will they take over type of curiosity? My question, I don't know what you meant by all of that. My question to you is that if in 10 years the robots are filling in his clerks, had stores or working the lobby of hotels, would you be comfortable as a customer in those location all sleep? Also, I highly recommend the new Westworld remake on Hbo. Yes. I thought that was Netflix. My fault. Hbo, uh, it's totally up your alley and I'm sure you remember the original with Goodall Yule Brenner House funny and said, yeah, you hit the nail on the head.

Speaker 1:          00:55:31       I already talked about it. I loved it. Um, this is what I think. I actually think that, uh, that those, um, robots will make human beings obsolete. I know that sounds fucking crazy, but they will. Okay. And they don't have to sleep. They don't have to fucking do anything. They'll outwork us and all that type of shit and they're going to act like that. Then we finally get to sit around and chill out. Right? Like that was, that was the big promise of all of this technology that was going to be coming out in the future. I mean, there's always technology, but the, the newer technology, it's technology of the future. You know, the three day work week, they used to make fun of that on the Jetsons. Sally's three day workweek. So brutal. People are working more than they have ever worked in their fucking lives in this race to wa, I don't even know what the fuck, why the kinks? It's somebody. Please tell me what the fuck we need robots for. What do we need any of this shit for? You know what I mean? Like I feel like somewhere in like the mid nineties that was good. We advanced enough with cars travel through advanced than us with medicine and that type of shit. I mean basically from 1995 on if you fucking die. And then, I mean,

Speaker 4:          00:56:48       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:56:49       I mean, I don't know the amount of shift did you could sidestep tuberculosis, polio, all of these fucking things. Deed all those plagues from back in the day. They were all gone. I mean, something, I don't know. It's hard when it's somebody you know and love or obviously if it's fucking you, but like, um,

Speaker 4:          00:57:05       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:57:05       I Dunno. I think the population, I've always talked about it, I always, it's a major fucking problem and I don't know how they go. Like

Speaker 1:          00:57:13       I just feel like those things will come along and they'll just be like, well, you have those things that don't need to, they don't need a flat screen TV. They don't need any of that type of shit. They can do the work of 10 people or they say they can do the work of four people. Then there's three extra people out there isn't there? Or there's forks to people out there. Let's fucking cut this thing down by 25%. I mean there's already too many fucking people walking around. You can have a bunch of robots walking around too. At some point something's got to give. All right. And I can guarantee you one thing, robots are never forming a union, right?

Speaker 4:          00:57:43       All right. They're not gonna so

Speaker 1:          00:57:47       I think there'll be smart enough to not get him to do that. But the greed of going after the dollar and making one that's just a little bit better, just a little bit better. Like these fucking iPhones. I think we could get ourselves into a tough situation. And um,

Speaker 4:          00:58:04       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:58:04       here's a question I have. Uh, if you kill a robot in the future, like is that going to be considered property damage? At what point will that actually be considered murder one or murder two or robot slaughter that they have all these new laws, you know what I mean? Like what if they make them like what they're trying to do? Like they probably try going to make up fuckable at some point. Like that fucking movie I saw like a year ago. You know what, if you go out and you fuck somebody else's robot, you know like, Hey, that's my robot. You just came in my fucking robot. What the fuck?

Speaker 4:          00:58:39       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:58:40       Even though it's self cleaning and all that shit, I can't fucking do that. Right.

Speaker 4:          00:58:44       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:58:44       You just really opened it up and fuck a can of worms there. Um, alright. Clown sightings. Uh Oh shit. And he is calling me. My episode of the Simpsons is on tonight is an on of doing the podcast. I know he was supposed to be done. It's hard than like a minute while I can hit pause. Hey, come here. I don't want to miss it. Puts your eyebrows done. You're like, what are you doing? I don't want to miss it. Hey, how nice is my car? It's very nice. It's awesome.

Speaker 4:          00:59:16       Oh,

Speaker 1:          00:59:18       I thought you when to go harder than that, I think. When you say it was a gorgeous, all right. How good was a potato pancake?

Speaker 5:          00:59:22       That was delicious. That was better than the restaurant. Is it me or did you guys just have like a distinct lack of fucking passion? This is totally you like, this is what I want you to do. This is what I want you to do now for the love of God. Go fucking do it. And I'm sitting there like a little six year old, mommy. Look what I can do. All right, just hit pause. I'll be up there in a second. Pause. There's no DME. Oh, all right. I know this guy's fucking depression era. Fucking a cable. All right, I'm just going to hit pause here and then we'll, we'll come back and finish this.

Speaker 4:          00:59:59       Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:00:00       All right. You know, and after all that, it wasn't even on Becky. She fucking went off on how great the potato pancake was. She thought the car was gorgeous. You see where they do? See what they do. You see what they do? How all of a sudden I'm fucking bragging a little bit. Ah. Oh. It goes out. They're always trying to fucking not knock it down a little bit. All right, here we go. Clown sightings.

Speaker 4:          01:00:22       Okay,

Speaker 5:          01:00:22       you're listening to one right now. All right. Clown sightings do have freckles. Have you heard about this clamp? Steria sorry. Have you heard about this clown hysteria freaks are dressing up as creepy clowns and going out in public trying to scare people. Yeah, I've seen those just search creepy clown sightings as a bunch of and a bunch of shit pops up. Uh, other people are now starting to go out to go clown hunting and beating the shit out of clowns that they see in public now. How the fuck do you go about doing that? Isn't it? There's like nine people in the country that have done that.

Speaker 4:          01:00:59       Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:01:00       Let's go out clown hunting. Wake where to clowns hang out. Do they have a natural habitat? Is there a bush she can go to the clown Bush. Shake it a little bit. Throw some rocks into it. Anyways, my question is one of,

Speaker 4:          01:01:13       yeah,

Speaker 5:          01:01:13       is if one of these clowns charged that you what, what would you do? Do you think it would be legal to run over slash beat the shit out of the fuckers that she'd, you let the misfit go without harming him. Thanks and go fuck yourself. I think at this point, I've seen enough of those videos that somebody, if one of them came running at me with like dragging the body and it's just so fucking over the top.

Speaker 4:          01:01:37       Uh,

Speaker 5:          01:01:42       I dunno, but you, you'd have to just out of respect for you sell your own safety, you'd have to fucking backup or runaway. Yeah. I mean, if a guy came running at me because of my luck, this would be the guy who isn't fucking around. I'd be like, Yo, what's up youtube? Worldstar whatever. Take a fucking axe to the head.

Speaker 4:          01:02:01       MMM.

Speaker 5:          01:02:04       But, you know, I don't think that you should go. I'm, I don't, I clown hunting to me is hilarious. Like, how the fuck would you even remotely begin to know where to look? You know what I mean? Like that was that thing for a while where people putting train horns in their vehicles and those people, uh, it should be prosecuted because, you know, my years of fucked that from years of going to concerts and playing drums and shit and like somebody did that one time when I went by. You know, it's funny watching people jumping ship, but like it was close enough that it did even more damage to my left ear, which is fucked up. And it's like that's something now that I have to live with because this person wanted to have a laugh. I mean the ring and went away. But they definitely, uh, and when you do shit like that, I mean you are kind of asking, you are asking for it.

Speaker 5:          01:02:49       You shouldn't do it like the other people. You shouldn't go beat the shit on the part that just fucking around trying to make a funny video. I mean, you really have to go beat the fuck out of them. Uh, but when you do scare somebody to that level, uh, maybe that is a thing that you can kind of expect. I don't fucking, I don't know what the rules of clowning is. All right, now she's texting me saying that it's starting. All right. Hang on. Stop. And again, every time I get momentum, you know, we get a fucking hold and call. It just kills the drive.

Speaker 5:          01:03:20       All right, now back again, guess what? It wasn't even the episode was the wrong episode. There was a pre episode, so the episode that they're going to show that I'm on. All right. Anyways. Um, all right. Waterproof electronics, waterproof electronics. Alright. Uh, dear Billy, what, what phone? Uh, just to let you know, the waterproof or water resistance rating on electronics is bullshit. The same goes for watches in any other water resistant item. Here's how they determine the water resistant. I mean, that makes sense. I mean, you pour water on to anything it's going to gradually seep through, right? Um, although boats don't,

Speaker 5:          01:04:02       ah, that must be the dumbest I've ever sound boats to. Okay. Uh, they stick the phone in water and a water filled tank and then increased the pressure until the phone has problems. The water in the tank is perfectly still and the pressure stimulates, stimulates the depth below sea level. Um, it's a bullshit tests because the water you drop your phone into is probably spa splashing all about and your phone is going to move in the water as it sinks. Um, if you don't drop your phone into an ocean or a river, you might drop it into the kitchen full of detergent or some other situation that isn't perfectly still water pressurized under test conditions. It's another marketing trick, which technically legally correct for the fine print, but as bullshit for the day to day life. Um, I dunno, I don't, I don't, it's gotta be better than the shit that isn't waterproof where he just fucking sneeze on it.

Speaker 5:          01:04:59       It doesn't work. Um, I know my watch, I kept wearing it while I was doing cardio and all of a sudden was fucked up and it was just cause it was on my wrist. I'm just sweating every day. It got wet. Um, I don't fucking know. I have no idea. It's probably all bullshit. I know when they, when they do miles, you know how much a car miles per gallon, they drove it like they drive it like one mile an hour with no headwind for most of the fucking test. Um, clear what is going on with you buddy? What is going on with you? Go lay down Jesus Christ. Are you allergic to the rug? Every time he come down and you start flipping out. All right. Um, let me do these last couple of reads and then I can finish with the questions here. Sorry for the whole fucking pause and then going out this week.

Speaker 5:          01:05:46       Alright. MVMT watches everybody pronounced movement. Oh, that's I'm supposed to say. All right. Movement watches. Everybody was founded on the belief that style shouldn't break the bank. The watchmaker's goal is to chart change the way consumers think about fashion by offering high quality minimalist products at revolutionary prices with over 500,000 watches sold to customers in 160 plus countries around the world. Movement watches have said solidified itself as the world's fastest growing watch company. Um, podcast slash radio evergreen copy. Why would you tell me that? What's the difference between this and what you'd see on television? I guess the company started by two broke college kids that wanted to wear stylish watches, but they couldn't afford them. Okay. So they started their own company. That sentence never makes sense to me. The two broke college kids, they can't afford a watch. A stylish watch, so they start a company.

Speaker 5:          01:06:48       Why can't afford a g five jet, uh, dig all started jet company. How is, how is this like, how is this like how you started built a following launched into podcasts, youtube, radio, et cetera. I'm not supposed to be reading this shit. Oh, I'm supposed to be like, oh, these guys remind me of how I fall, how I did it. Uh, movement watches start. I don't know where I am in this copyright. Now. This is, this is a shit show movement. Watches start at just 95 bucks at a department story. Uh, you're looking at four to five and a bucks moving movement figured out that by selling online they were able to cut out the middle man and retail markup providing the best possible price. All right, we're making sense again, over 500,000 watches sold over 160 countries. Good for you. Get 15% off today with free shipping and free returns.

Speaker 5:          01:07:36       Go up by going into movement. watches.com/bird that's MVMT watches.com/burr. This watch has a really clean design. Seriously. You got to love it. If you put it on, you're going to get compliments. Now's the time to step up your watch game without breaking the bank. Go to MVMT watches.com/ [inaudible] it's fucking hilarious, right? I want a pure bred dog. I can't afford one. So I started pure breeding dogs. That's not even a good example. I mean, wouldn't even know he'd fucking do that. I wanted my own island, but I couldn't afford one. So I bought island. I started, I started a company that made islands. Bill, get it. All right. All right. Stamps dot. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:08:18       Ah, man

Okay. Let's get back to the fucking questions here.

Speaker 4:          01:09:13       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:09:13       Um, let's see. Where the hell was I?

Speaker 4:          01:09:18       Okay. Water dear Billy, what phone? All right. We did that one. Okay. Uh,

Speaker 1:          01:09:30       it's all your listings at ps. Uh, keep a little black book full of your phone numbers from now on, so you never lose another contact. I'm actually doing that with a couple of little red books. I couldn't find the black ones. All right.

Speaker 5:          01:09:41       Ceo a there. Billy boss. If you could become CEO of any company for a couple of months, which company would it be and what would you try to change at Monsanto? When I'd stop poisoning the food. Oh, Andy. Monsanto just now on by bear. Bear doesn't care. Uh, imagine, uh, you have a few months so it's not like you get to get fired day one for joining apple and changing the name to orange for selfish purposes. Also you pick apple and can also pick any other company you talk less about as well. Ha Ha. Thanks for everything. I think I answered it. I think it was, I also, my dyslexia kicked in and none of those sentences made sense to anybody. Those last two ones.

Speaker 4:          01:10:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:10:27       What did it say? That one gives a shit. Yeah, that's what I would do. I would, I don't know. It would be nice if the way corporations will run, you know, it's some point you made enough money and at some point you thought, well hey, what would this be doing to the environment? What would this be? You know, I actually heard that they're lobbying. They got all these lobbies going on right now.

Speaker 4:          01:10:46       Two,

Speaker 1:          01:10:47       make marijuana illegal again at the state level because allegedly, uh, prescriptions, medication has dropped drastically, uh, in states where marijuana use is illegal and uh, so they want to make it legal or illegal again. Evidently my question is, is, well, why not the big pharmaceutical companies just start making weed. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:11:09       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:11:10       You know, and phase out these other fucking pills do not work in ways, you know, they don't work, you know, all those fucking side effects. I mean, it's fucking nuts. This is shit that you can take literally. That's just for something like really basic. And if you get on it for a while, if you come off it, if you come off a too fast, there's a chance you might kill yourself. I mean, they never had stuff like that when I was a kid.

Speaker 4:          01:11:33       You know,

Speaker 1:          01:11:35       somebody was all over the place. They were, they were fucking, they will call the spares. There was a fucking spares, man. He's all over the fucking place. You know what I mean? I know it's a bad word in Scotland. My apologies, but that doesn't mean shit to us. And you guys say cunt, every other word.

Speaker 4:          01:11:49       MMM,

Speaker 1:          01:11:51       yeah, I guess. Uh,

Speaker 4:          01:11:55       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:11:55       I Dunno. That's one of those super depressing kind of questions because when you really think about it, there's really no fucking reason for our behavior towards one another. You know what I mean? Um, I dunno. I think it just comes down to this just really,

Speaker 1:          01:12:13       you don't, you don't remember when you watch like planet of the apes, it was like the champs. They were the fucking doctors. Then he had the orange ones, they were the old ones. And then he had the gorillas and they would like to fucking maniacs or whatever. Um, which was sorta oddly racists. They were the darkest of all the apes, you know what I mean? They were the worst and I guess what the chimps were subtly supposed to. I can see orange ones were supposedly gingers and we were supposed to be the best of people. I don't know. You can, you can always read into all of this shit. But like, I dunno, I think, I think people are kind of like that. You know what I mean? You got fucking nice kind of, hey man, you know, whenever you taking the Ambien man, you know, and then he just got fucking complete psychos who will literally stab a baby in the head to get another inch forward.

Speaker 1:          01:12:51       And I think those people really succeed in life. Like when you just don't give a shit about, you know, and I'm not saying I'm a fucking perfect person cause I've done some horrific shit, but I'm just saying, you know, that's just the pain that I've caused on an, on an individual level. Forget about it. If you're doing it at the fucking corporate level, um, I dunno, I just love those people go, well, if I didn't do it, someone else would be doing it. That, that's, that's usually a good, that's usually a nice red flag that you're doing something fucked up. But

Speaker 4:          01:13:18       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:13:20       I really think that we are, uh, this is depressing. You might want to shut it off now. I think we are the, uh, there's a flaw in our design and the way we are wired. We are, it's inevitable that we're going to destroy ourselves. Um, it's just,

Speaker 4:          01:13:39       you know,

Speaker 1:          01:13:40       and I really don't think that it's not even necessarily human thing. It would be like whatever the next thing on the food chain was. If we weren't here, it would be taking too much and it, and in its own fucking way would be fucking up the balance in nature and all that type of shit. But uh, I don't know if I 100% believe that, but I just look at it that way cause then I don't, I can just, I can deal with some of the shit

Speaker 1:          01:14:03       like a, that I see. I do have to say though, this presidential election in these two choices is one of the most depressing fucking things. Uh, I've been around it in a long fucking time. I can't believe, I just can't fucking believe it's a reality TV show star or the fucking devil who, oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. All right. Halloween costume. Just get off that topic. Hey Bill. When was the last time you dressed up for Halloween? Uh, two years ago I dressed up as John Bonham. Um, if you had to go to one of these celebrity dresser parties, like we're Heidi Clume goes all out every year and shows up looking like an extra from the Tom Cruise movie legend. What would you dress up as a, when millions of women look at a US weekly at the hair salon, who will they see Billy red face dressed up as a, when they get to the celebrities wear stupid costumes just like us a section. Um, well first of all, those are all the beautiful people self. I'm out. I'm not in that section, so I don't think they were, let's just say all the beautiful people got hit by a truck and it got all the way down to I, you know, was in that thing. Let's see. I, I would probably John Bonham, I've done that one enough. Who would I dress up as?

Speaker 4:          01:15:22       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:15:22       Somebody like debts known but sort of obscure because you only to be the like the 12th Douche to show up, you know, dressed as like Donald Trump is going to be like the, everybody's doing that or Hillary, you don't want to dress up as Steve Jobs. I still think he's fucking known well enough. You gotta you gotta dress up like, uh, uh, let's see here. Who'd be a good one? Who's a good fucking, they were the sh, you know what I mean? Like if you were going to dress up like somebody and uh,

Speaker 4:          01:15:56       okay,

Speaker 1:          01:15:57       you know what? You got me, this is how I would have, this is something you just can't fucking pull this gem out. Like, you know what? Dressing up like the professor instead of Gilligan. It's basically that formula, but not that example. You know what I mean? Like who the fuck lost the last presidential race Obama ran against? Who Was it? Mccain? I don't know. But Tina Fey did the fucking, the chick, she did that one to death. I Dunno, you know, some bill Bellacheck might be a good one for as well known as he is. I'm, Tom was out in here in la and I just dressed like him. I think people would love it. A hoodie with the fucking cutoff sleeves, you just have it up, you know, maybe him.

Speaker 4:          01:16:45       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:16:46       You know what I, I would go, Vince Lombardi, maybe an old football coach go out as Tom Landry, but I got to pick some with a fucking blockhead like mine, something like that. Something along those lines rather than like the hacky once, you know, want to go. And I was fucking Chewbacca. Anything from star wars, any superhero. I mean that's just fucking lame. Trump, Hillary, that's fucking lame. Obama, you gave you me, you're going to get in trouble for being in blackface, so you got to leave them alone. Ah, Shit.

Speaker 1:          01:17:20       That's a good question. I go out, I was like Phil Rudd Drama for ACDC and people say, who are you? I'd say Phil Rudd. And they, and people said, who's that? And I'd be like, Ugh, you gotta be ashamed of yourself and you just walk away. So you get to like have a cool costume and scold people. There's a way to go. You know, pick somebody who people you, you feel should know, but they don't know addresses Clive birth. Um, I dunno. I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about anymore. All right. That's the podcast for this week. Everybody. Uh, I'm going to watch those Formula One races. I'm hoping the red sox can come back. I just want to be able to sit down and watch a fucking game. I don't know anybody on the team. I know Petrolia and I know big poppy and when he leaves, I'm just going to know Pedroia um, plus this one Cleveland fan was like fucking talking shit to me. A buddy of mine, he's going to call fucking, you know, Tito is playing a chess game with the fucking red sox and I jokingly wrote back like, yeah, you don't need to talk to me. You don't need to talk to a red sox fan about Tito playing chess. I saw him play chess a few times when he was here and it just completely went over the guy's head. You know what I mean? I Dunno sometimes just sitting there going like, hey man, you guys are looking pretty good. Nothing
