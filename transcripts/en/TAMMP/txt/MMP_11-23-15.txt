Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn his time for the Monday morning podcast from Monday, November 23rd, 2015 what's going on? How? What's up? Oh Billy red face. So Billy red cakes. Oh fucking what are you doing? Douchebag. Freckles here is integrate Moody's on is for dumb with his first week and not doing shit. I'm not doing shit for the last week. I already did it already accomplished a dream of not doing shit. And this week I'm not doing shit right. Greatest fucking holiday. The year everybody talks about Christmas. People talking about flag day, fucking Easter. I'm telling you this is the one you don't have to buy shit. Oh you though. You just show up. You show up little corn, beef and cabbage, whatever the whatever your little family fucking dishes. You show up, you smile, you do a couple of air kisses, you know, feed your fat fucking face and then you just slip into the living room, right?

Speaker 1:          00:01:02       And watch the game sitting on the sofa. Then there's that other guy that's socially fucking awkward guy who hides and alcohol sitting in the lazy boy. You know, you guys are angled just enough that you can see each other in your peripheral but you never say anything. You know, a couple of times you go to start the conversation and you see the lonely guy being excited, but then he fucks it up. He seen withdraw again and you try to act like it didn't happen and that's just a second quarter. All right. Anyways, um, I find I did my official way in today to see the damage I did. I was about a buck 65 or something before I left to go to way back in September. Right. I was trying to get down to one 62 I got to one 65 and one day I just skipped rope and just sweated it out.

Speaker 1:          00:01:52       I got to like one 62 point something but that's bullshit. Right. Got down on one 65 then I had a wedding week long family event and then right after that I went to Texas for a week and then Toronto and it came back for a few days and then I went to DC. Then I came back for a few days, like a week, and then I did that two week fucking tour of, uh, the Midwest came back for three days. Then I did the Philly run, then I went to New York and I did MSG. So in that time I knew I was putting on way, uh, I knew I was doing, I knew what I couldn't, I couldn't stop, right? All right. Now before I started this whole thing, I was 187 pounds of getting down to one 65. I lost 22 fucking pounds. So the big question is, Bill, you dumb.

Speaker 1:          00:02:38       Fuck. After you did all that work, you stupid cunt. How much did you give back this morning after weighing himself in September before all the festivity of you see what I'm talking about? 165 pounds. I weighed myself this morning, right when I woke up, the most accurate weight from what I've read on the Internet. So take that with a giant grain of salt. And, uh, one 76.8. Ah, Billy, what did you do? I just remember my last night in New York, fucking hammered eating two slices of a sausage, Pepperoni, and it wasn't even good. And after the first one, I was like, Jesus, this is so much shit on this. This feels like Chicago pizza where like nobody in there, nobody in their right mind ever has more than one slice of deep dish pizza he had just fucking can't do it. You're, you're out of your fucking mind. So anyways, um, yeah. So I'm pissed that I fucking went that hard, fucked it up that much, but I'm not, I didn't see the dreaded, the one that really depresses me is when that second number is an eight. So I'm going to try to do the impossible. The other thinkable Cleo, we have stopped licking yourself so damn loud. Hey Cleo,

Speaker 2:          00:03:56       Cleo,

Speaker 1:          00:03:59       we get you knock it off over there. I know you gotta do what you gotta do. You need a bath?

Speaker 2:          00:04:08       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:09       Anyways, the fuck was I talking about? Oh, I'm gonna try to do the impossible. The unthinkable. Now this, she goes, look at herself again. Good Lord. No shame whatsoever. I'm going to try to lose weight during the holiday months here. I'm actually during the week of Thanksgiving, I'm trying to get to, my goal is to be a, to do the three pounds that I was doing back in the summer drop three weeks. So that's one 73.8 is when I need to be next Monday morning when I roll out of bed. And um, so we'll see what happens. But he has a fucked up thing. I made three Pi's yesterday. All right. I'm not all for me obviously just people come by the house and stuff like that. So I made a cream pie or pumpkin pie and an apple pie and I actually fucked with the sacred family recipes. Now I even had a slice of any of it yet, but I up the cinnamon in my apple pie and um,

Speaker 1:          00:05:04       and I use this, this different recipe was a butter base crust. And um, my wife sent me a fucking text message. I thought the house was on fire. It was just Omg, Omg, Omg, OMG. I can't even say it that fast to fucking say it slower. Bill will be still on the stand. She wrote Omg like 50 times in a row. So I was, I had gone, I was driving. So I texted while driving of course. And I said, pie question mark, question Mark House fire question mark. And then she did a bunch of Emoji Emoji Shit. And uh, she wrote that pie is fucking delicious. I said, how's the new cinnamon levels? She said perfect. And then I said yes with an exclamation point. How about that? You got to hear my whole private text message now that's the best apple pies. A motherfucker, you know, I don't know how you guys do it.

Speaker 1:          00:05:55       I use it like three different types of apples got appeal and then you quarter and then you try to get like eight slices, right? You slice them nice and thin. The Way Paul, he does the garlic and fucking good fellas and you gotta you gotta have your mics ready though. So they don't turn Brown. You stick them in there, you swish it around and all that. You make sure it gets all over the place and then, then the fucking, the apples all intermingle, you know what I mean? Like, like, like the higher ups. Don't want us to, everybody getting along. I'm fucking with you. I guess why I went down to the comedy store yesterday for the, for my first set since, uh, my last show in New York and I went down there, I had the best fucking time. I try it out, all this new material and I actually walked into the comedy store and you know, they have the original room and then they have the main room.

Speaker 1:          00:06:43       The original room is the part of the original club when they just bought half of it. It used to be in a nightclub called Ciro's and a with the original room sits I think was the back of the main room. So, um, and he's whatever, come out to la, just walk in, take a look at it. So I got what's going on in the main room and they go, Dick Gregory, I go white. They go, Dick. Great. I go, Dick Gregory is on stage right now. And they were like, yeah. And I went in there and the guy was fucking hilarious. Still funny as hell. Still Edgy, talking about topical stuff. He was talking about Paris, he was talking about all this just right up to date stuff. Um, he was fucking amazing. So that gave me a charge. So then I go into the, the uh, the original room, they bring me up, I start doing my thing, everything's going great. You know, I did my little one

Speaker 3:          00:07:37       wage gap, gift, a joke, and then I get off stage, thanks a lot. And uh, all of a sudden there's lay, she comes up to me and then she just wants to present her case. She's like, you know, well actually I'm in my mid thirties, and now I'm at an age now that when I go out with a guy, he wants to go Dutch. She expects me to pay for half and then I just go, well yeah, you should,

Speaker 1:          00:08:04       you know, it should.

Speaker 3:          00:08:08       No, this is asking too much. You're in your thirties. You've demonstrated that you're not a first round draft pick at this point. You know you fucked up like me so I know I'm fucked up. I know you're fucked up or maybe too driven to commit to anything. So you know, we got to keep each other at arm's length here, right? So I paid for my shit. You pay for your shit. I couldn't be like, I couldn't even listen to like that's lets your big fucking complaint life that for the first 30 years you got free fucking food and drinks like as a guide. You know how far back into my life I got them. They get to live like eight year olds. When when you were a kid you just walked around as a kid, you had no money. You went out with your parents yet all fucking day. Yay you had drinks, you fucking on booze. But you know, cut yourself a high c, whatever the you had, you know, went

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       to a ball game, whatever. You never went in your pockets. The life of a kid, you know, you essentially in that nightlight, look, I obviously know that women don't just not pay for fucking anything, but I'm just saying that when they get courted,

Speaker 2:          00:09:13       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:09:17       you don't have to pay for Shit generally speaking. Right. So anyways, so she comes up to me and I just didn't want to fucking hear it. And, uh, I made the mistake, I treated her like a guy and I feel bad. I just completely, I just gave a shit and then she was like, going how you're being mean and everything I make, it's a comedy club, but Canadians, this is what we do.

Speaker 2:          00:09:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:09:38       And then she wanted to make her fucking point and I just, you know, I just walked away and then of course I made the mistake of asking another comic. I goes, I just two main there. And he's like, yeah, no, no. Comedian will never say you're to me felt like the, uh, the right level of it. Um, that's a pet peeve of mine. I don't like when I'm standing on stage and you could heckle me while I'm making my point. Instead, you don't, you wait until I get off stage and then you want to have some fucking, you know, Charlie rose conversation about what the fuck you think of the jail. I don't give a shit at that point. I, you know, I would much rather that you yell out during my show.

Speaker 1:          00:10:24       Okay, I'm in my thirties. I got to pay for a date that we could have had that hilarious conversation a little back and forth. But instead, you know, I got to get off stage and then you come up to me like I'm being debriefed after my shift. You know what I mean? See where I went. Right. To see where I went wrong. Like, I don't want to fucking hear that. But you're more than welcome to heckle me. I don't give a shit. I don't care about that. You know, I'm up there just me and the mic stand. You know, I feel safe.

Speaker 1:          00:10:55       Uh, who's given you, I was probably too much of an asshole. What do, what do, what do you want from me? So anyways, what the fuck happened to my Lsu Tigers? Jesus Christ. I'm not even what was on the road. A lot to shoe, so I missed most of the season, but I watched the end of the Alabama game. They lost that game and the fucking wheels fell off and they got their asses kicked by Arkansas. Who even knew they still had a football program out there? I mean it's Arkansas. When was the last time you even heard of that state? Bill Clinton was in office and that was only in the first term that former governor, a little rock, Arkansas. All right. By the time he got to his second term, they phased out Arkansas, like the older brother on happy days. Right? No more chuck. Now he's at school now he doesn't exist. Right. I'd a fuck do you lose to them then? Add in the Midwest and not in the south. They're just there.

Speaker 3:          00:11:52       The name their capital.

Speaker 4:          00:11:54       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       Little Rock. It's got little. How does he, how does your capital have little in it? Yeah. Unbelievable. We fucking lose to them. What do you mean? What are you, he goes on in Arkansas.

Speaker 4:          00:12:04       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:12:05       Some reason why I think Arkansas, you know, I think of, I think of like an Oldsmobile four, four, two.

Speaker 4:          00:12:10       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:12:10       I guess 65 for some reason. I know that riding around it, but they're all driving around old cars like Cuba, you know? But that embargo hit them real hard to, even though there's no embargo on them, but to just Arkansas. How to Fuck d lose to Arkansas. Um, I'm just waiting for those fucking Arkansas sc.

Speaker 3:          00:12:30       See if you were actually in the conference. I don't care.

Speaker 4:          00:12:35       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:12:36       And then who the fuck did they play this past week? Uh, all miss. No, right down there on the goal line. And one guy thinks it's a fake play. The other guy's trying to hand it off to him was fucking keystone cops.

Speaker 4:          00:12:47       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:12:48       Keystone cops. This is what kills me. They'll probably end up getting rid of les miles. You know what I mean? I love that one bad fucking year. And then all of a sudden you don't know how to coach anymore. He watched, they'll run them right out, you know? Well, show me, show me. He's got to answer to this. Nobody could just just be like, you know what? We had a bad fucking year. It's gotta be like, Oh, you know what? That's it. You're done. You don't know how to do this anymore. Does that happen at your guys' jobs? You know what I mean? Say you're working at staples, right, and you fucking a, you're going down to the dial with the three ring binders and you think they're on the lefthand side. They were on the right hand side. Then they go, you know why you just can't do it anymore. It's over. You've been here for fucking four years. I don't think you're not to work at staples anymore. I know I'm, I'm, I'm,

Speaker 1:          00:13:31       I guess I'm belittling both people belittling that job and I was a belittling the job of working at staples. I think the job at staples is a big thing as you hide in the back room because they have so little people on the floor. If you walk out on the floor, everybody's going to ask you a question. Right? You're going to walk out and ski with me. Excuse me

Speaker 5:          00:13:47       sir, sir, sir? Yes. Could you tell me where my dad is? Age, birthdays coming up and we had Devon Kelley paper. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:14:00       That's when you should legally be able to just grab somebody by the back of the head and steer them towards where they need to be. You know, this then like push their head down to see where it is on the shelf and then as you go to let go, you give them that little push before you do that causes them to do that half a step and put their hands out like a toddler about ready to fall. Um, anyways, um, I barely watched any football yesterday. I got a couple of things done that, uh, we're hanging over my head that we're going to cause me to not enjoy my fucking holidays. Um, I am now at the age is, it's somebody asked me to write a letter of recommendation

Speaker 1:          00:14:40       for this fucking thing and I just kept putting it off and putting it off and I was like, you know, Bill, this person just trying to get on with their life here. So I just sat down and fucking forced all my add away. You know, I opened the email, but I looked at a bunch of other emails first. I gradually closed all the windows and a, I missed all the one o'clock games. I caught the tail end of the cowboys game. I was psyched for the cowboys. How fucking nuts is it that they're undefeated with Tony Romo? But the 10 games in, it's just a fucking tragedy. They were two and all Tony breaks gets his fucking collarbone broken. They lose seven in a row. They go all four fucking seven that totally comes back. Boom. It's like he never left. You know, like that old friend you don't see for 20 fucking years and you can see each other. You just start laughing. You pick up right where you left off. Tony Romo. Tony Romo. I want to get a cowboy. Feds bitch about them now. Huh? Hey, you go. You got what you wanted. You got Tony out of the fucking line up and look what happened. Oh, four fucking seven.

Speaker 2:          00:15:53       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:15:54       so now he's back. Anyone I love is the fucking NFC. He sucks so bad that they could actually go on a run and still win the division.

Speaker 2:          00:16:04       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:16:05       You know, that's what's killing me about the giants right now. Cause I know I told you I never want to see the giants can, I don't give a fuck that we beat him in the regular season and thought it doesn't matter. Okay. I can't, I, I can't handle another, I can handle another Superbowl loss. I can't handle another loss the way we lose to the giants and just can't do it. You know Tony Romm Rama Fades back.

Speaker 6:          00:16:26       That's a show comes up. He does a show by accident. Everybody goes after the show. A tacky Friday. What? The football? My Lane, our touchdown.

Speaker 1:          00:16:38       Fuck that. I can't, I can't watch another one of those John Brady back to pass. He's got to throw in fucking half a yard or Westworld.

Speaker 6:          00:16:46       Correct.

Speaker 1:          00:16:49       I can't, I can't, I don't even want to fucking deal with that. And this is what kills me. The giants whose absolutely have absolutely shit the bed this year are in first place. I think with like a fucking, you know, foreign six record or something. You know, I could just go on the Internet and I could look this shit up or I could just wing it. Um, no. Who's kidding? Who? I would love to play the giants again as long as we win, you know, to try it. But I even know if it was like going to be a 50 50 and be like, yeah, you know, I don't need to go through that emotionally anymore. I really don't fucking kills me. How much these stupid losses, you know, I never get a ring. They don't ask me to get on the duck boats for the parade duty.

Speaker 1:          00:17:26       Why the fuck do I care? Why am I absolutely elated that the Bruins if on two games in a row right now, Huh? I don't know. I have no idea. Second, Wayne big winning against the Toronto Maple leafs. I've been at home getting caught up with them being all they look all right. Last couple games they look are right. Definitely up and down season. Um, so I don't know, I won't pack it in until like February and in February they still doing this stuff. Then he stuck getting those awful feelings. Waikiki almost want your team to lose so they get a better draft pick. Um, but uh, I cannot, I can't fucking do that. But anyways, oh, did I miss it yesterday to the islanders and uh, Canadians play job bite next from puck off. Told me that there was going to be bad blood is going to be some bad blood in that game.

Speaker 1:          00:18:17       I think I fucking missed it. So anyways, but the big game tonight is a Ulu to do is a patriots first the bills. So, um, I'm going to try to do my best to get in front of a TV so I can listen to bills, fans talking shit again, uh, about what they're going to do, what we should have done. Right. They're going to get all like, fuck Gig, you fucking there. I already got a text from somebody. So one of my friends out there, I think the shred and Reagan show, they texted me going, the Patriots are going to get their asses whipped and I just wrote back, uh, who were they playing? He goes to play in the bills this year is super bowl champion. And I just wrote back, I said, well it should be a great game. You guys have a wonderful defense. Good luck just to fuses all this shit out. Why is a, why you talking shit? You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:19:18       Dude, the little fucking call me for good. He's going to do it for getting one if he does it. And what if he does? What are you going to do? Huh? You going to sit there and grow your man tits with me? You don't want to fucking do it. You know? And I was watching a Bruins game and I was so disgusted with myself. Um, I had this workout for like the last two periods. Every five minutes of the game I would do 25 push ups. Um, it's an easy way to do 200. You know what I mean? You get nice long rest depending on uh, how many penalties are called and commercial breaks. Just every five minutes you bang out 25. I've got to do something guys. I made three fucking pies. I'm in trouble here. Um, but the key is I haven't had one yet so I don't have the crack rolling around in my fucking system.

Speaker 1:          00:28:09       which should be a cool thing to do for the holidays. Plus then I don't have it around here, so I'm not fucking eating it. Right. And then all they do is eat one. I think that could work, right? You've got to give away some of it. Um, but I'm going to do that three hours of that by thanksgiving. Am I one bad day is going to be Thanksgiving then I'm just gonna try to, uh, I gotta turn around guys. If I go back up to the one 80 zone would be so fucking depressed. I just don't want to be that fucking guy at the start of the year. Like, Oh, good to fucking, yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:28:37       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:28:37       here we go. I'm going to fucking get in shape. You know? You know what that's like. You know, it's like starting your year as a fat fuck. Who's got dropped like fucking 20, 30, 40, 50, a hundred fucking pounds. It's the worst. Why not get started now and not do the fucking damage? You know what I mean? You know, that awesome feeling you get, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:28:55       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:28:56       if before you go to work, you make the bed and you come home and the bed's made, you know, that fucking feeling. Or maybe the night before you did all the dishes and you wake up to make breakfast and there's no dishes from the night before that, that, that ahead of the game feeling, you know, or at least I'm even, you know what I mean? Like, I don't get to start my day doing yesterday's bullshit plus whatever the fuck hits me today. Um, that's what it's like to be on January 1st to actually be in shape. And I don't think I've, I've done that since my twenties, so, um,

Speaker 2:          00:29:28       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:29:28       I'm really gonna try and, uh, it always helps me to announce it on the podcast and I'm going to fucking do it because I know you guys will fucking, you guys are going to check in on me and you're going to give me shit when I, you know, if I'm not talking about it, you know, I'm not doing well and God

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       knows you guys like to be mean, but I probably deserve it after what a cunt I was to that lady last night. I wasn't even a cunt. It's just the fact that she's a woman. You need just supposed to, you know, you're just supposed to let him win. Be Like, oh wow. Wow. Yeah. You, you, you and you. Yeah, that's exactly what the joke was about was all about you. All of you. Why not talk about all of you? Your so interesting. Please tell me another story about your Damn Day and what you said and all my God, what you were like. So I said this and then she said that, and then I was like,

Speaker 4:          00:30:17       okay

Speaker 1:          00:30:18       ladies, how do you not see the pain in your man's face when you're doing that? You know what I mean? I see the pain in my wife's face when I tried to talk to her about a game, man, it was fucking two minutes left, right? Patriots or getting killed on defense. Right. We get the ball back. Tom Brady throws the ball. Giant guy grabbed any fucking lands on his stomach, not just window. By then, it's just fucking over. She just starts making fun of me. Really? Oh my God. That's amazing. Just give a fuck. You know what? If I don't listen to her fucking stories, oh Jesus. Oh, forget about it. To be, it's a big Goddamn, I don't know what it is. Um, anyways, let's get to some of the reads for this week. Okay? Yeah. Bell, it's fine. It's absolutely fine. All I'm doing the comedy jam tonight are right with the fucking,

Speaker 4:          00:31:04       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:31:05       the fucking text message is there. Um, let's read the text message. I was that somebody else who saw the F is for family.

Speaker 4:          00:31:12       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:31:13       Yeah, I saw the trail. People are like in the trailer. Thank Christ. All right.

Speaker 3:          00:31:18       Uh, venue dear Billy, big shot.

Speaker 4:          00:31:21       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:31:22       Now that you've done the mother of all venues with Msg, what non traditional venue would you like to play? Like something like the Great Wall of China. Congrats on your year ago. Fuck

Speaker 1:          00:31:32       yourself. Um, no, there's still a, there's still a bunch that I would love to play. A Royal Albert Hall is on my bucket list. Um, and, but then there's also, there's a bunch of theaters that I would still like to play or continue playing. There's the one on out here in California in Long Beach. So Long Beach something or other where Richard Pryor did his, uh, live in concert. Um, I already did a show at the palladium. That's where he did live on the sunset strip. And I forget if the, the one that he performed at when he did his here and now, which I think was in, uh, New Orleans. I got to see if that one's still exists. But I really, uh,

Speaker 3:          00:32:18       I like doing those old theaters. I like doing a man. It's like going to old ballparks and you hear all the people that were there like last night when we were

Speaker 1:          00:32:24       down the, um, the comedy store, this is just

Speaker 3:          00:32:28       characters just show up, right? Dick Gregory's onstage. And then this other guy comes in cause he knew Dick Gregory. He was the publicist for Ciro's. There was this nightclub. I said it became a,

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       the comedy store. And uh, you know, when Frank Dean, Sammy and all of them were down there, he was just naming all of these fucking names. He said, hey, he goes, I first came here in 1950 so immediately doing the math going, Jesus Christ, if this guy was like 20 in 1950, that's 65 fucking years ago. He's 85. He didn't look like it was in his eighties. He actually looked great. But, um, so let's see what venue. You know, red rocks. I performed there though, but I, I did, I did red rocks when it was, uh, there was some sort of animation thing going on after it. So when do you get the comic comedy works? Uh, got me the Gig and we went out there, but it was cool to be at red rocks, but uh, they weren't there for me. They were there for the fucking film. So there was a lot of chatter. But um,

Speaker 2:          00:33:36       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:33:36       A lot of the things on my bucket list are venues that, um, that either bands played in that I love and had some live album there or as comedians that did a, uh, special there. So I told you when I was in hammer town, they're up in fucking, uh, Toronto, Ontario. I mean, I know Ontario and it's Toronto. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:33:59       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:33:59       They just kept calling a hammer town. I can't remember the name of the town, but it's south of Toronto. I didn't realize I performed until after I was there. I performed at the theater were bill Cosby did bill Cosby himself. Um, arguably the greatest special of all time, you know, now what he did afterwards. I don't want to get involved in that. Um, so that was cool. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:34:24       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:34:25       I did a,

Speaker 3:          00:34:27       yeah, that's a great question. I don't know. I just want to keep going. I liked going to venues that I'd never been to. You know what I really enjoyed this year was when I was doing the tour of California going to Reno and Bakersfield and Fresno and they were along the old school highways where people were site too, like the highway went right down main street. So they would have some big fancy sign, you know, Reno biggest little's town and uh, you know, the West Fresno, you know, whatever the fuck their slogan is. You know, they would always have like town and then some sort of slogan Bakersfield, like, Hey, stop and stay awhile, you know, some corny shit. But um,

Speaker 2:          00:35:06       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:35:06       I really liked that route. 66 type of stuff. And uh, as far as Europe goes, that's to me is all about world war two, World War One,

Speaker 1:          00:35:17       those, you know, those types of places. But as far as performing, I don't know enough about Europe and that type of thing. Uh, I did look up, you know, Ac DC where they recorded a, if you want blood, their live album, that was a place, I believe it was in Glasgow or Edinburgh, I want to say Glasgow, but, uh, the venue doesn't anymore. So, um, yeah, so that I would say that I get a big charge out of a music place cause I'm a total nerd when it comes to that shit. And, uh, I remember when I was in England, London a couple of years ago accidentally coming upon that Ronnie Scott's and I saw Jeff Beck have one of the great fucking was him, Vinny Coley Uda and that chicken base. And they just will fucking unbelievable. Like Jimmy page was in the crowd, you know, sinking down in his seat. Like, Oh yeah, I stole that riff on, it was still on that one from him and nick in it, I believe, as they call it. So yeah, there's still plenty left. And, um, the MSG for me was not as much as it was a high watermark. It wasn't like this, you know, and now I just slide down the back nine. For me it was, uh, it just felt more like an honor to be there and it was mine for an hour and a half. And then, you know, the second you leave somebody else's name was on the marquee and it's like, wow, I got to do that. Um, but I got to tell you, I had just as much fun,

Speaker 2:          00:36:39       uh,

Speaker 1:          00:36:41       fucking around with the new stuff. You know, it's hard to describe unless you're a comedian. The excitement of new stuff. Like, Oh, I get to say new shit. I have to keep saying this stuff and trying to figure out how to make this fucking new again tonight. Um, so anyways, so yeah, I would say I've Royal Albert Hall is like the next one I'm really thinking about, but there's no way there was in something in Ireland or something in Scotland or, uh, Finland, Norway. I mean, I think I'm doing a tour of the, uh, the fucking, um, eastern Europe.

Speaker 1:          00:37:15       Be Crazy to play a venue that like fucking like Hitler or Stalin or Mussolini, one of those fascists. When now I get stolen wasn't a fascist, but one of those fucking maniacs gave his speech and you know, it's still exists, you know, fucking nuts, right? I Dunno. Alright. Baking. Hey, Bill. Uh, Bacon Bill. I'm thinking about surprising my girlfriend and her family by bringing over a homemade pie for thanksgiving. All right, dude. I got you. I'm going to make two pies because one isn't enough. I'm thinking about apple and Pumpkin also because also, please know that apple capitalizes apple as if there's no such thing is fruit. Oh, the apple company. Anyways, I know, uh, from previous years that you're killing it in the kitchen. I'll thank you before I called my mom and her two s and get her 2 cents, uh, from Youcan, I get some pointers, some basic do's and don'ts, uh, when getting into it, should I avoid either apple, the fruit, uh, or Pumpkin?

Speaker 1:          00:38:22       Thanks. Um, Pumpkin pies and an easy recipe. Apple pies work as far as the filling, but it's also fucking, now it's apples and cinnamon. Man. I mean, come on. Um, I'll give you the biggest, like the filling is the, is easy. All right. The, the thing that scares and intimidates people is doing the, uh, oh my God guys, do I have to make a fucking pie crust making video? I'll fucking do it. I'll put on the apron. I'll put on the apron and a silly hat. You want the, I'll do that for you for fucking thanksgiving. How about that? I will make a fucking pie video, um, pie crust video. Uh, but if you're going to do it right now, because I won't get the video up in time, I will show, I will show you. Uh, I'll try to walk you through it. All right, so the recipe that I use, it's two cups of all purpose flour.

Speaker 1:          00:39:17       The kinds that people say, you know, you're gonna die if you eat it. That's what you want with the pie. You don't want to go any low fat. You don't want to go wheat. You don't want to do any of that fucking stinky feet, Seattle thing of with it. All right? You want to go? Midwest Chicago heart attack. All right? You're making a pie. You want to be healthy? Go have a fucking salad. That's not what we're doing here. That's not what stock you're crying, right? And it's funny. There's roofers fixing something on my fucking roof that's never going to be fixed. And they probably just heard me yelled at, now stop your crying and get out of my kitchen. You know, that's how rumors start. I know that guy. That guy tells jokes. Yeah, he's fucking verbally abusive to his wife. Um, anyway, so what you want to do is you add two cups of flour, okay?

Speaker 1:          00:40:07       And you get yourself a sifter, right? And there's always a little bit of salt. Go easy on the salt, like an eighth of a teaspoon. So what I do is I take the cup of fucking flower, I poured into the sifter. The sifter is sitting in the bowl that you're going to sift into. Don't just pour it into the sifter and it's going to end up on your counter. You don't want that, right? So you're pouring one cup, then you put in your salt and you put your next cup over it. Then you sit there, right? It comes fucking out. Then a, and then you add you shortening, right? I use a stick of butter. Sorry. You want it to be cold so it's not too fucking mushy. Uh, take it out of the fridge. You just cut it up and like, you know, eighth of an inch slices, you put it in there and then with your little fucking thing that you hit.

Speaker 1:          00:40:52       See, this is why I'm gonna to do a video. You just, you want to cover it, right? And then you put your shortening it and then cover that. You want it to be all like, uh, like you make an a fucking meatball. You want to get the bread crumbs all over except it's the flower. And then when you do that, you just lightly tap all the way around. You know, he let in that shortening sat kind of get into it. Then you go a little harder, a little harder, gets a little mealy once it's a little mealy, he started adding your water. I got to make a video, I got to make a video and I can also show you how much you can fuck up acrossed and still save it. And uh, uh, you know what, I gotta do it. I'll actually do that.

Speaker 1:          00:41:27       But as far, listen man, pumpkin pie is great, but if you want to knock people on their ass, you got to make an apple pie. And I'd get three different types of apples. Uh, throw a granny Smith in there so you got a bitter thing and then something else for a little sweeter taste. You know, little surf and turf going on in there and a, you just make sure you use enough cinnamon. You know what I mean? I use about a half a healthy half a teaspoon. What has happened to me? I'm literally just sitting here talking about this shit. Like I'm about right. Like it's, this is a fucking game plan to win the fucking football game tonight. Um, all right. So anyways, holiday wedding, uh, Billy bell's, my friend from college is getting married, uh, the Sunday after Christmas. Oh, Jesus. What a stupid time to do that was because everybody's in your hometown. He goes, is there a worst time for a wedding now?

Speaker 3:          00:42:23       Can you believe that it's in upstate New York? Of course I can. If he's going to be a [inaudible], he's got to go all the way with it. I'm sure it'd be fun once I got there, but I'm thinking about skipping the circumstances are grounds for not going right. Absolutely they are. Fuck

Speaker 1:          00:42:37       that. Fuck that.

Speaker 3:          00:42:41       You know what I mean? I always think that when people do shit like that anyways, it means one of two things that kind of hope and most people won't show up or two, they don't have enough money to throw a good wedding anyway, so all that great food. You're going to walk away from that to go up there and fucking eat hamburger helper, you know, standing out on the stage, eating the fucking dance floor, eating a steak, um, gray, good tags, Calla Bu du, Du, Du, Du, Du, Du, Du, and you don't want, your friends is going to cancel last second that agreed to go and you're going to fucking show up day. There's some shit food being served. Ride here now. Some fucking shitty food. It's going to come out. Chairs. Yeah. Fuck that.

Speaker 4:          00:43:29       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:43:29       Fuck that. And he can never give you shit. All you gotta do for the rest of your life when he gives you shit or she gives you shit or whatever about not going, just, you just, you don't use you sitting at the bar and they're fucking [inaudible] man, you're fucking ear. You don't, you just keep looking straight ahead and he just put throw your hands out and you just go. You got married on the Sunday after Christmas.

Speaker 4:          00:43:52       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:43:52       Who does that? That's it.

Speaker 4:          00:43:55       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:43:55       And as they try to defend it. You just talk over married the Sunday after Chris, when? The Sunday after Christmas. It's almost like he didn't want me to be there. If you get divorced, when are you going to get married this time? Fucking New Year's Day. The Fuck Outta here.

Speaker 4:          00:44:19       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:44:19       What do you think you're better than Santa Claus? You better than the baby Jesus. Huh? You think you're better than the prime rip my mother makes on Christmas Day. You mother fucker.

Speaker 1:          00:44:31       Where the fuck do you get

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       an upstate New York? How dare you? I want to be that fucking person driving in his station wagon fucking Sunday after critic. Get to fight this. This is like my time off. This is my time. All this is my time. Okay, I'm going to go to a God damn wedding. Oh, that just reeks of like my friend got ordained as a fucking preacher and he's going to go up there and his fucking street clothes. Oh yeah. I bet they get married and like the basement of a fucking holiday inn and the ceremony is going to be going in the door to the function room, still going to be open to people and we randomly walking by looking at it, you know, they got to keep the door open because there's no bathroom in the function room. See, you gotta walk out. Oh, that's a shit show. Jesus Christ. It was, that's like a, it's like a sales meeting. You don't want to go to, well, you know what? I've convinced myself that I wouldn't go. I don't know what you're thinking, but I wouldn't go. That's totally grounds for skipping a wedding alone is grounds for skipping. Who the fuck wants to go to that? Unless you're still in your 20s,

Speaker 1:          00:45:40       you know, then it's a good time. You want to go to a wedding single, right? Go there. Maybe bank, somebody's right. Have a good time to go there. You know? If you're not married then eventually she's going to look. Oh wait, wait. Dad I did is, uh, when you think of it, just fucking running, doing a running

Speaker 3:          00:46:00       jump right off the balcony. All right. Sleep, trouble sleeping trouble. All right. I hate bell. I just started traveling for work and getting a good nights and getting a good night's sleep is brutal. Yes it is. I'm not trying ambien or increasing my alcohol intake. How do you deal with all the travel, uh, alcohol? Uh, do you use a one of those stupid neck pillows? Nope. Hotel beds aren't bad if I do sleep well, I end up waking up feeling comatose, which leads me to being more tired cause those beds are huge and soft and I don't want to get out of bed. You're also making up for the sleep that you didn't get on other nights, which you can't really do. You know, there's that weird thing that a flake say, you know, you got six hours one night and then 10 hours the next night. So

Speaker 1:          00:46:46       you got, you know, it averages out to eight hours. It still doesn't work that way for some reason. Um, you can't retroactively, like when you miss out on whatever it is you need. Some people only need six, some people just need four. But if you need like whatever the fuck you need, I'm saying if you come up short, you can't just sleep extra one day and then even it off. It usually takes like a week. Like I've been fucking sleep in this whole week. I'm falling asleep like an old person. So, um, but anyways, let me continue. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:47:17       and I don't want to get out of the bed. It has, it hasn't happened yet, but I can see it's slowly turning me into a grouchy asshole. How do you do it? Well, you are cheery fellow before hitting the road.

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       Thanks for the free labs. Um, how do I do it? I'm German. Irish. That's how I do it. Um, we're not in touch with our feelings, so even if I am tired, I'm just naturally trained to block it out and I just get up and, um, then I go. But however, every once in a while when I do make a conscious effort to think about slowing down and relaxing and not having something to achieve every fucking day, be it picking up dry cleaning or writing a new joke, um, I suddenly become aware of how tired I am. So, um, what I would do is, yeah, it's not, not, uh, not use any of the drugs. And I also wouldn't fuck with alcohol. I wouldn't do that either. What I would do is workout in the morning and then go to your job, whatever it is that you do.

Speaker 1:          00:48:23       And then at night, because you were working all day and you worked out, you'll actually go to sleep. If you just get into the good habits out there, it's not that bad. But, um, I dunno, biggest thing that I found him, he sees food. Food is difficult. And uh, if you're doing like a bunch of one nighters, if you like a traveling salesman kind of fucking thing, selling your widgets or whatever, that's when it gets hard because you spend your day traveling and then you arrive at the hotel, you fucking hungry. But you got to go to your Gig. So you usually end up, you know,

Speaker 3:          00:48:56       did you guys get to have anything healthy way? We got an apple base. Oh yeah. Do they deliver and you they, yeah, he sure don't. They sure don't.

Speaker 4:          00:49:06       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:49:06       Nodding yes. They sure dope.

Speaker 4:          00:49:10       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:49:10       You should shake your head. No.

Speaker 4:          00:49:13       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:49:14       Can I get what I need? You sure can't. Not In this town. So then you, then they always have like fucking menus and they're always going to give you some Chinese food, which is just, is going to be unfucking believable or absolutely horrific depending on, uh, you know, it has nothing to do with where you're at every fucking town in the United States as Chinese food, I believe. And every town has a Chinese family that moved there, right. For the most part, or at least within two towns, is a Chinese family that moved there and they will make that fucking food. Now, whether or not they're people from China that know how to cook, that's the fucking rub.

Speaker 4:          00:50:00       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:50:00       You know, you never know. Even set and get five and in the middle of fucking Kansas.

Speaker 3:          00:50:06       And I got some of the best Sushi I've ever had. Japanese family, middle of fucking Kansas. It's like, how did you end up out here?

Speaker 4:          00:50:13       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:50:13       Does unbelief. I, I, most of the white people I know didn't end up out of here. How did you, uh, from Japan end up in a lazy fucking Kansas. Oh, speaking of bucket list, I have like a bunch

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       of college basketball games I want to go to. I want to go to Kentucky. I've always been a Kansas Fan. I don't know why I want to go to their, their facility. I want to go to a Duke Carolina game at Carolina and at Duke. Um, can I have been to UCLA?

Speaker 1:          00:50:50       Who else has a big basketball program? Georgetown. Syracuse. You know the red men, Saint John's Redmen one of the fuck they called now the red storm. I grew up on big east basketball, but uh, I used to love watching all that shit. So I've been to Indiana. I told you guys I went to Indiana University, uh, university basketball game with Bobby Knight was still on the team. I was, I could not fucking believe the level of which set guy was screaming at his players was insane. Come in all the way on his fucking head. Just snapping is a point that they let up an easy bucket in the point guard was bringing it up the court and the fucking guy, I swear to God, he walked like 10 feet out into the court. Everybody was just like intimidated by him. I just say, just annoyed me. I wanted to see like somebody stand up to him, you know, give the guy next verbal fucking slap.

Speaker 1:          00:51:41       But it never happened. That guy, classic example, Eagle completely out of fucking control. Um, when he started buying into being Bobby Knight and he started doing those, I'm going to be Bobby Knight. You know, what is, what is a game face. I never understood that. And he starts mugging to the camera or when he goes, uh, you know, I, boy my credits bury me. They bury me face down so they can kiss my ass. I was like, Oh God, shut up. I have another drink. Um, I just make fun of Bobby Knight. What it, what the fuck is wrong with me? Um, yeah. So I'm doing the goddamn comedy jam tonight at the, uh, if leaves the lyric theater on a [inaudible] and I'm looking forward to doing that. I got, yeah. You don't want to tell you guys I've got nothing else. I can't even do a fucking hour. That's, that's how little I've been doing this week.

Speaker 1:          00:52:32       I got caught up on peaky blinders, peaky blinders. I don't know nothing about no robbery, um, peaky blinders with subtitles, uh, um, up to the, a first episode of season two. So I'm going to blow through that this week. And then my wife is watching bloodline, I believe that's the name of it, with, uh, Norbert Leo Butz, who I did a failed pilot with a long time ago. And, uh, he's a fucking great guy and I keep walking in there and he's absolutely crushing every scene. And, uh, so I, I got to watch it out of solidarity. Um, we actually, a long time ago did a fucking pilot. Did I ever tell you guys this fucking story? We did a pilot and they wanted edgy.

Speaker 1:          00:53:19       All right. I thought I told you guys this one, whatever. Who gives a fuck? They wanted edgy. Okay. It was, you know, and they will let us go really far. And the, uh, the pilot name was playing chicken was the name of this pilot. And the premise was, um, me and Norbert were brothers, he was Republican and I was Democrat and Norbert's character was paralyzed from the waist down and he was paralyzed because he was playing chicken on a fucking jet ski and neither person turned away and he got paralyzed. So that's what's the name of it. So that's already the fucking premise. So he was like over the top fuck homeless people and all that Shit. So anyway, so we're doing, you know, whatever, they write this edgy fucking pilot and um, right as we're about ready to do the fucking run through where all the fucking major network guys come down.

Speaker 1:          00:54:24       And it's basically you do, it's basically, it's like a live play. All right, let me just give you a little packet. Basically what happens is if you're on a sitcom, you have the table read on Monday, right? If it kills, you go upstairs and you do a bunch of blocking in the fake living rooms and all that, which is basically, I'm going to stand over here when I do this. You go through the whole fucking thing. If it bombs and they know that they're going to rewrite a lot of shit, you have a quick fucking day like, well we're going to get a new script tonight and this'll be, you know, a little bit different. So then Tuesday comes around, you fucking rehearse it, you still got your script in hand, and then you do a run through and it's just for the, uh, the production company, like the, whoever's making the thing.

Speaker 1:          00:55:07       So it's, that's friendly fire there, you know, those are like the executive producers and the people that wrote it, the writers and all that. So they watch it and they see what's working, what isn't, what needs to be fixed, what can stay the same, what they can add on to. And then Wednesday is the network run through. And that's when the people that can cancel your fucking show show up and leave their sense of humor. At the fucking door. Right. So that's always a nerve wracking fucking day. And you go out there and if you do a couple lines, they don't get laughs. You start getting in your head like you're going to get fired. You know, and as you're walking from one fake living room to the fake bar or a coffee house that you hang out, the only sound you hear is the shoes of the fucking executives walking over to the next fucking the next scene.

Speaker 1:          00:55:53       So anyway, so we're doing this fucking pilot and the opening scene is, we're sitting there at some ice cream place eating ice cream and this homeless guy, whatever. We're having a back and forth and this homeless guy comes up and asks for money. So I of course being the liberal go to give some money and Norbert's character being the conservative guy, you know, basically tells the guy to fuck off. So everybody's loving it. He actually, I remember flicked ice cream at him. Oh he decided he was going to do that during the fucking run through cause we weren't going to do it all day long. Flick and ice cream. And I'd be a fucking mess. So he just kept miming flicking the ice cream. That's what it was. So anyways, people are digging the pilot, you know, the producers and all the writers, they're all thinking it's funny, they're laughing it up.

Speaker 1:          00:56:42       We do the regular run through what's going great. So now we've got the network run through but the next day, and it just so happens that during that week or whatever, Don Imus said the nappy headed hoes fucking comment and for whatever reason all hell fucking breaks loose like you know, Hitler's back and um, it becomes this big fucking lightning rod thing that allows a bunch of people who don't, you know, want to increase the fines with the FCC and all this shit. All basically what this one guy said on the radio trickles all the way down to our pilot that has these fucking suits, nervous, you know, just in general about, we better watch our step because Don Imus, I dunno what loss, some advertising money. So they in that fucking headspace and they come down to our show where we got to half paralyzed guy, you know, and the opening scene, we're doing the scene, it's getting zero laughs.

Speaker 1:          00:57:39       And I remember where the homeless guy walked out and they even gasped at that because they really made them look homeless. He was really dirty and Norbit goes all the jokes of bombing and he goes and turns around and flips this fucking Globa ice cream and hits the actor right in the face. And they gasped and no law. I mean I thought it was going to kill. We thought it was the funniest shit ever. They, there wasn't a fucking, they just gasped and then it ended right. And then just the sound of their shoes shuffling all the way down to the other side of the set for the next fucking scene. And it, dude, it was the worst run through I've ever been in. I'm talking, there was zero laughs, it was dead fucking silence. And I just remember walking by this one actress, she delivered her line and it got nothing.

Speaker 1:          00:58:38       And she walked by looking at me like, what the fuck is happening? And I almost burst out laughing because for actors it's like, fuck, I'm going to get fired and I'm going to be unemployed again. For a comedian, I can still, I'm not, I'm not unemployed. I can just go back to doing shows. The fact that I'm on this thing is, is gravy. So the look on her face was just, I mean, I don't want it to be out of work, but it was just funny to me. So the more it was bombing them, the harder I committed to what I was doing just because if you're going to bomb, you might as well just fucking do the triple Lindy. So I was just going bigger and it just was just dead fucking silence. So the run through ends, I mean, you can hear a fucking pin drop and it was to the point, he was like, dude, I didn't think they gonna shoot this fucking thing. So me and Norbert went back to the hotel. We go right to the bar and we just start laughing, going, I'm getting fired. He's going, no, I'm getting fired. And we had like a bet who's going to get fired. It's like somebody is going down for that. It's like, you know, like Lsu loses three in a row of somebody's got to pay the price. Somebody getting fucking fired. So, um,

Speaker 1:          00:59:51       day ended up showing up and they would talk to both of us individually in the, uh, in our hotel rooms. I remember the guy that directed the thing, he came walking into my room and just sat down on my bed. It started eating the peanuts, my peanuts without asking. And I was the most arrogant thing I'd ever seen in my life. And I was just sitting there going like,

Speaker 4:          01:00:14       okay,

Speaker 1:          01:00:15       it's still bugs me to this day. I didn't say anything to that guy. Um, but anyways, so they fucking, uh,

Speaker 4:          01:00:23       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:00:23       So they ended up towing this whole fucking thing down.

Speaker 4:          01:00:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:00:27       Right. They go, look, we're not gonna, we're not going to get rid of you guys. Uh, was the wrong tone, blah, blah, blah, blah. And then what ended up happening was they fucking dialed it back like 40%. Really took all the balls out of it. Um,

Speaker 4:          01:00:42       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:00:43       And then, you know, a few days later we shot the pilot in front of a live studio audience and it actually killed it went great, but it didn't end up getting picked up and a, and yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:00:52       that's my, uh, that's my story about bombing. Sorry guys. I had to, I had to go in the weld air, man. I ran out of fucking stories to tell if you tell you for this week, all I know is that the bills are playing. The Patriots tonight in Gillette Stadium

Speaker 1:          01:01:07       can happen. Um, they just don't have a quarterback. They got a great defense though. So we'll see what happens. Uh, I don't think the Patriots losing one game is the worst fucking thing. I think it's actually better, man. Get it. Makes people focus on somebody else. So, uh, you know, worst case scenario when nine in one, I'm on vacation, you know, I'm having a good time here. So, uh, that is it. I'll talk to you guys on Thanksgiving. Um, I'll try and make up a pie crust video. I'm going to do that shit. Why not? I said I was going to do it. Right.

Speaker 3:          01:01:38       That'll be me giving back, giving thanks to you guys listening to the podcast I'm doing to do I the Joe Rogan podcast, Joe Rogan experience. I'm going to be doing that tomorrow.

Speaker 1:          01:01:50       Um, and, uh, I think that's it. Happy Thanksgiving to everybody. If you're traveling, you don't have time to listen to podcasts and he'll get a chance to say it. Happy thanksgiving. Thank you to everybody that's coming out to my show, uh, over the years from the bottom of my heart. I really appreciate it. And, uh, that's it. Go fuck yourselves. Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:02:04       And I'll check in on Thursday.
