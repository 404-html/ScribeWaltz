Speaker 1:          00:01          Hey, what's going on? It's bill burr and as some Monday morning podcast for Monday, February 10th, 2015. How's it going? How, um, I'm back in the USA. I just landed at JFK a couple of hours ago and I've been trying to get this fucking thing done in my, my Olympus ls 10 that I bought like six, seven fucking years ago. It finally died. I think it finally died after a trip around the world. The old girl couldn't take it, you know, she went quietly, quietly in the night. Um, anyway, so I'm psyched to be back. I had a great time and just a whirlwind tour around the world. I don't even know where the fuck I am right now and I don't even know what time it is. Um, yeah, I do. It's 5:53 PM east coast time according to my, um, my little fucking little, little iPad thing here. Uh, Ah Shit, I don't know what to tell you guys. What the fuck do you want from me? You know all you can see out there who, who gave me shit because the podcast is so late this week. All right? You didn't have the fucking decency Digi to go onto my website and maybe have a little bit of empathy. You'd be like, Oh, oh, that's why. That's why it's late. He's flying back from Mumbai, India.

Speaker 2:          01:25          Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:26          It's fucking three hours to do by another fucking 13 hours on the Goddamn plane at some dose. Miss Their connection when we were in Dubai in their plane was on their planes. That bag was on the plane, so they don't let the cont on the plane yet. They spend 15 minutes trying to find 20 minutes trying to find the fucking bag and they take it off the plane. It's like, at that point, why don't you, let's just let the asshole on the plane so we can all get outta here. Right. I mean, that's what I was doing. Well, you know when I used to run an airline, that's how I did it. So I don't know what's going on with United Arab Emirates and Mercedes, whatever the fuck the airline is that I flew. Uh, anyways, first of all, before I get going, thank you to everybody came out to my shows in India, China, Singapore or whatever the fuck I was this week.

Speaker 1:          02:15          Uh, it was my first trip to fuck in Asia and I had a, a, a great time. I did not get caned in Singapore. Um, I didn't have any secret police in China and no religious crazy people got me when I was in India, you know, so I, I survived it. Singapore was great. China was great. I don't fucking know what to tell you all. Let's just talk about India. All right? First and foremost, the second you get to India, this is what you're going to see. Mumbai, India, you are going to see the greatest drivers in Jay Walker's you've ever seen in your fucking life. I've never seen just complete fucking chaos when it comes driving. Like, like I saw in India and even like the old people were good at Jay walking and what killed me. They never changed their gait, I guess gay does that running whatever, whatever fucking speed they were walking when they stepped down and traffic, they just stepped out and just kept walking at the same pace to traffic.

Speaker 1:          03:18          Never sped up, never slowed down. Nobody got hit. It was unreal. I've never been in the back of a cab so many times going, ah, well watch it, watch it, watch it. And just nobody slows down. Nobody speeds up. Everybody just keeps doing what they're doing. It's like, it was like, it's like watching Chevy chase and Caddyshack when he's a fucking Putin barefoot. No, no, no, no, no, no. Saturday Dah, Dah, Dah. That's how they fucking do it. I'm definitely the most insane, craziest, coolest country I've ever been to was definitely, uh, at least that city man that was, um, it was something else that people were really cool. Uh, you know, at first you freak out, you know, when you show up. And uh, we landed there at like midnight.

Speaker 3:          04:01          Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:02          And, um,

Speaker 1:          04:04          you know, we showed up to the hotel and there's a guy with like a machine gun in somebody's checking for bombs underneath the fucking car, you know, which creeped me out at first. And there was like a metal detector going into the fucking hotel within. I was just like, ah, now that I'm in here, I got a guy with a machine guns standing up front. This is way better than a red roof inn. So I guess it's just a big, I guess maybe back in 2008, they had a terrorist attack. So ever since then and the hotel was and get attacked or whatever. So now they just have a guard. They were all the time. But other than that, I didn't see anybody with a gun. It's a really safe city. The food was fucking tremendous. And uh, I did the show the last show of the, um,

Speaker 3:          04:50          okay.

Speaker 1:          04:51          Of the, uh, of the tour. Sorry guys. It's going to be a lot of fucking mental, uh, brain farts here this week. I'm just trying to take in everything that I saw. Um, it was awesome and I got to hang out afterwards and went out and got dinner with me and like 20 Indian comics and just sat there talking comedy for a good half hour, 45 minutes before I had to go to, uh, the airport, which was, uh, one of the highlights of my career to be honest with you, have to be able to talk to people on the other side of the world that do what I do. You know, and um,

Speaker 1:          05:25          you know, this, these guys want to send you a link to this, although maybe I shouldn't because I know that trying to lay low, but for those who listened to the podcast I did over there, those same guys got in trouble because they just did a fucking roast. Right. And according to them, it was way tamer than anything in the, in the u s but uh, they haven't had, I guess a lot of roasts that might've been the first one. And they did it, they roast it. A couple of Bollywood guys and everything was fine. Everybody laughed, everybody had a good time. And then for whatever reason, either they posted it online or somebody else did and the second went online, you know, you know what happens? The second something goes online, everybody starts going, oh my God, what about the children? What about the fucking religious thing that I believe in?

Speaker 1:          06:14          What will this comedy due to that? You know what I mean? Like they will, it's just fucking roast. Everybody's laughing, having a good time, so whatever. So they, everybody freaked out and um, you've got like 8 million hits and uh, they're like sort of in trouble but not in trouble, but they're in trouble. Like they could spend eight years in courts with, I dunno what lawsuits or whatever. I was reading some of the comments and someone was just going like, you know, what does this say? What is this going to do to society and Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And it's like, have you fucking looked out your window over there? Jesus Christ, they got like in New Delhi, they have like a major problem with rape. Is a roast going to make that any worse? You know what I mean? Jesus crabbing. I mean, I'm not even going to fucking say some of the shit that I saw over there.

Speaker 1:          07:09          I saw a stray cow, a stray cow. It's just as fucking, it's awesome. I don't see, I don't want to say a half of this shit cause I don't want to scare people from going over there because it's one of the coolest fucking places I ever went to. Um, but yeah, you'll see like a stray cow eating garbage next to her. Like a Mercedes Benz driving by. Okay. So you got, you got the entire fucking colors of the rainbow there. It was. It was awesome man. And the uh, the food was insane. Can't say enough about that. And um,

Speaker 4:          07:42          okay.

Speaker 1:          07:43          Other than that, what else did I get a chance to see? I didn't get a chance to see her. They, oh, this was the scary thing was I went into the country and because we we fuck with, with the Indian people when they come to the u s I guess, cause we're trying to make sure that they don't illegally immigrate, immigrate, whatever to our fucking country immigrant. Right. And immigrate. Yeah. Immigrant. That's how it is. Emigrate, you leave, immigrate, you come in, there you go, Bill. Now you worked out yourself then. Yeah. Um, anyways, so we fuck with them. So this is tit for tat thing. So then they fuck with us, specifically Americans from the west coast. So they don't fuck with anybody from the east coast I guess.

Speaker 4:          08:25          Okay.

Speaker 1:          08:25          Um, as far as like you come to the country and then once you get to the country, you, you need another piece of paper stamped by the government so you could fucking leave, you know, or it's some Bronx tale shit. Like now you can't leave until you get this fucking thing and then it's,

Speaker 4:          08:41          yeah.

Speaker 1:          08:41          You know, just some big pain in the ass thing. That took like two and a half hours for me to get. But, um, I guess they've had problems with artists on the west coast, but not in the east coast, which means to me that maybe somebody, a governor or a senator of a state on the west coast, like maybe Schwartzenegger said something. I have no idea what, but somebody said something, somebody pissed off, somebody snuck. So you know, old freckles has got to get up in the fucking morning and I go down to a, I didn't know what the hell it was, but I had this, this big like envelope as shit with my passport, my working visa, the fucking contract for the show, all of that stuff. I go inside the building and the, the promoters not allowed to go with me. So now I'm in there.

Speaker 1:          09:31          I mean this was like one of the biggest like touristy things that I got to do, like really experienced, be in an Indian and I fucking go up to the third floor and this big long line of people all from different countries trying to get this piece of paper so they can fucking leave and a, the line move quickly. But then they just got you into another room and it was like being at the fucking DMV and you know how that goes. You're going to show up with a stack of papers, like the God damn phone book and when you get up there, you just see the look on their face. You like, Oh fuck you. What else do I need? And there's always something else. So whatever. I kind of charmed the lady I was talking to like, uh, I couldn't understand her, she couldn't really understand me and I finally was able to convey it to her that I was a comedian and she kind of gave me this look like, really? You think you're funny? And I forget what the fuck I said, but I was able to make a smile, which was good because eventually I needed the promoter to come up there to help me get over the last leg of it. But what's funny about Indian people is they got this thing they do when you ask them a question, they don't shake their head no or not. Yes, they do like this bobblehead thing.

Speaker 1:          10:44          And I was sitting there like this white dude in Hong Kong told me that they're going to do that. And it actually means yes, you're going to think that they're being assholes, but it actually means yes. So this lady kept doing it. I kept going. Does that mean yes. I mean, yes. Long story short, one of the comics told me later on that it doesn't mean yes, it doesn't mean no. It means that there, how did he put it there? Uh,

Speaker 2:          11:08          okay.

Speaker 1:          11:09          Politely accepting your existence or something like that. Yeah, what it was. But um,

Speaker 2:          11:17          yeah,

Speaker 1:          11:17          everybody that I asked a question too there, I was like, so if I give him all this stuff, like I'm going to be able to get to piece of paper, I'll be fine. And then they do like that bobble head like a, you know, maybe you will, maybe you won't, you know, maybe you'll be on that plane back to the u s maybe a you'll be in that. You'd be in the garbage next to the cow tomorrow. I don't know. I don't know how. I don't, I don't know what to tell you. So I'm just going to do this fucking thing with my head. So I got a big kick out of that. And here's the thing too. Like I've really been working on my temper. I stayed up there for two hours and 45 minutes. I never lost my temper once. At one point, I sat down, I looked over at the lady and I was just like, I looked down at the floor, it's like, how fucking long as it's going to fucking this the worst.

Speaker 1:          12:00          I got sort of whispered debt, but then I just looked around the room and I saw this family of four from the Philippines and they would in front of me and I'm like, all right, they're still here. The guy was behind me, he's still here, so everybody's waiting the same amount of time, you know, for the love of God, Bill fucking relax. Um, so whatever. But uh, I just um, got, okay, I saw so much shit over there so quickly went down to this. Um, they haven't like the street fair thing and they had all this, you know, brought my wife down there. They had all this amazing clothing and all that type of shit and artwork and all that type of stuff. I, it's just one of those things. You just walk around like, I'm, I'm in fucking India right now. I couldn't believe it.

Speaker 1:          12:44          And, uh, then what's funny is you go out to go do the show and you feel like you're in the United States. It's the exact same thing. People laugh at the same shit. It's just that when Singapore, Hong Kong and India, they had like these, you know, don't talk about the government, don't talk about religion, don't talk about race. And then you go to the show and the comic in front of you is talking about all of that shit and basically how it works for you to really get in trouble with that. You would have to be basically living in the country, build up a reputation for doing it all the time. And then eventually one of those governments will be like, all right, let's see, let's send somebody down there. And then they'd go down, they'd watch you. And in all you'd get is like a fine, either they'd find the promoter or the venue or possibly the performer. I Dunno. It's not really like, you know, harshly, um, and forced, which is actually was a pleasant surprise with the way everybody's taking everything. So God damn seriously lately, like every fucking thing that you say now is just like,

Speaker 4:          13:55          okay,

Speaker 1:          13:55          I mean it's fucking ridiculous and I really think comics have to hold the fucking line here and not apologize or else, I mean, I don't know where it goes from there unless you want comedians just up there talking about widgets. Um, and what kills me about the so called outrageous is such a small percentage of the population. First of all, you realize how many people could just give a fuck about standup comedy. Like if you walked down to the amount of people that the small percentage of people who've actually been to a live show, you know, it doesn't even fucking appeal to like 80% of the population as far as I know. You know what I mean? They're doing other things. There may be into music or they just watch sports, but like, you know, it's fucked up. Like, I love standup comedy before I became a comedian. I only went to one show ever and I was almost 24 by the time I started so I could legally could have gone to stand up shows for like six years, 18 plus. And then once I was 21 I could go to anything and I never went. I only went one time and I wanted to do it for a living. So

Speaker 1:          15:13          I dunno. All right. And of course this stupid thing just crapped out on me. I'm really having a rough go here with the technology on the strip. I apologize to everybody. Uh, anyways, what was I saying? Um, I guess I was just talking about how few people actually even give a shit enough to even go to a standup show. Um, so if a comic says something, it's really not affecting that much of the population that really they could have fuck lives their life by what a fucking comedian says and a God damn joke. It's so ridiculous. It's just gotta be a, I dunno, I'm really hoping this is just a fad to be taking comedian seriously.

Speaker 5:          15:54          Anyways, that's the end of the whole, um, the whole world w world tour thing. Um, it was really insane. I went to five countries in three weeks. I did a 11 shows in nine different cities, five different countries. I don't know how many different time zones and uh, so first time I ever was in Asia and um, I had just, it was, it's just a part of the world. I never, I always wanted to go, you know, and I just never, you know, he's just don't think you're ever going to get to do something like that. So, uh, thanks to everybody listening to this podcast, watch us my specials and all that type of shit and actually learned something. People downloading my specials illegally isn't always a bad thing. I mean, it kills me monetarily, but had they not done that overseas, then they wouldn't have seen me.

Speaker 5:          16:43          So, uh, I dunno. I'm starting to rethink some of that shit. Although I do stand hard is far as I got a hard line on the fucking, I stand hard yet with my dick standing up. I got a hard line when it comes to fucking tape and be in a club when I'm trying out new shit. Um, that's, that's fucking brutal cause then I go to town and my new shit is already old shit and it's just, you can't write fast enough, so can all you fucking teeny boppers uh, just take that into consideration. I know it's all about you and your fucking Facebook pages now and Oh my God, look at me with my selfie and all of that shit. It's, this was fucking hilarious. Now is this like the crowd wants to be famous back in the day. The crowd was cool when they would just sat there.

Speaker 5:          17:31          All right, monkey boy. He wanted to be famous. Let's see if you're good enough to be famous. Now it's like half of them aren't even paying attention to you. They're literally like really bill. Is that half of them or is it like three, four people is show? All right. Three or four people is show are like already on their Twitter accounts or Facebook or whatever the fuck they use. Um, talking about themselves, trying to put myself in their position, but I just can't picture myself any show I ever went to when I was a kid. Right.

Speaker 5:          18:06          You know, if I paid to go see it, I would watch it, wouldn't you? He got all fucking day to do your duck face into the phone, don't ya?

Speaker 6:          26:44          Um, I watched it three times and uh, it's just a hell of a fucking game. Um, and I actually think Edelman should have got a co Mvp because not only did he have a big game, he knocked his defensive back out of the fucking game, you know, broke the guy's guy. Damn rests on a wonderful fucking tackle and a, we exploited whoever the fuck they put in for the guy that broke his risks that I don't know his name either because I was traveling around the fucking world and I don't collect football cards anymore because they fucked up the whole way you did it. You know, back in the day you could just go out and buy a post stack of them and eventually you'd get all of them, you know, now they try to make them deliberately rare and they have like pieces of game worn jerseys.

Speaker 6:          27:30          It's just not what it used to be. I just wish tops would put out a set of 390 like they used to back in the fucking day and someone like me could ride his bicycle down. Old freckled face bill. You know, any you're awful gum that was in there, that fucked up one football card in every pack. Why can't I go back to doing that? So I'd know back then, I swear to God I could have announced the fucking game. I knew everybody's name. I knew the offensive linemen, defensive linemen, I knew fucking everybody. Now the only way to do that is you got to play fantasy football with a bunch of fucking jerk offs. You got to go to somebodies living room and have a fucking draft as you sit there with adults acting like, just see, oh is of a fucking league. That doesn't even exist. It's one of the saddest, most pathetic fucking thanks. Anyway, so let's talk about the game. Um, even though it's way over. Uh,

Speaker 2:          28:22          okay.

Speaker 5:          28:22          Um, obviously the excitement wasn't there cause I already knew the, I knew the end result, but I was anticipating how I would feel throughout the game. I would say that when Brady threw the pic, uh, in the beginning, um, I guess with the broken wrist, I guess that that would have made me feel like they kind of offset. But, uh, I always get nervous when someone says a turnover and I'm thinking, like I said, it's going to be the first in many definitely when we were down by 10, I definitely would have been like, it's over. We're not coming back from this shit. And uh, you know, that ridiculous catch. I would've completely freaked out. But um, I'll tell you, everybody's given Pete Carroll Shit. You know, they had a great stat that I saw. I'm usually not a big stack guy, but that play that Pete Carroll called that was run a little over a hundred times during the regular season. It resulted in like 65 touchdowns or low sixties touchdowns, like 40 incomplete completions and like no interceptions or something like that. It was like 64. No, like 65, 66, something like that. Touchdown. Right. And

Speaker 6:          29:30          45 was a little over a hundred times. They tried it, but there was never an interception until that place. So it's just one of those fucking things. And God, if anybody knows, it's just one of those fucking things. It's a patriots fan with like the helmet catch, you know that fucking ridiculous pass at Eli through after Brady to Welker shit the bed. Um, but you know, it was fucking hilarious. Was seeing Tom Brady space after that ridiculous catch that that guy in the Seahawks mate, he's just, he just had this look on his face like, like really like how many times do I have to win the Superbowl?

Speaker 2:          30:06          Okay.

Speaker 6:          30:06          Before I, I actually, and the defense will just fucking get a goddamn three and out. It led me ice to fucking game. How many fucking times? So I got to drive down the fucking field for the, go ahead. Touchdown.

Speaker 6:          30:20          I did it in both fucking giants games and you guys are out there letting people catch it between that taint in their fucking ankle for the love of fucking God. You know that whoever that Patriot was that jumped up and over, that's the result of those fucking don't, don't hit a defenseless receiver cause back in the day, even though Malcolm Butler tip that ball up debt, other that's safety coming over the top, he would have gone right into that guy's jaw. Even a hurdle in like, oh, don't step on the receiver and wouldn't knock the ball out. So thank God. And uh, I loved seeing a drunk, um, Robert Kraft and I loved that he demanded an apology and that fucking gym or say what a bunch of Horse Shit. Did you guys see that thing ESPN did where they had the, uh, the science guy actually investigated the advantages or disadvantages of a deflated ball and they actually found out that it was, it was actually a disadvantage. Um,

Speaker 2:          31:17          yeah,

Speaker 6:          31:18          but there's an article that came out that I retweeted that grant it was from, it was from like CBS Sports Boston that really debunked a lot of the shit. Of course you guys won't believe it, but, um, you know, I dunno what I hope that they pursue that they should pursue that. The way the colts complained throughout the years. Just keep complaining right through the fucking draft. All I know is the fucking bill Belicheck sat on the rules committee and change rules to make the game easier for his offense. I mean he would have to go on in front of the Senate defending himself. Jim Mercy does it. Nobody gives a fuck. Um, so that's my message. Fuck Jim, our sec. What are you going to cry about this year, Jimmy? Um, anyways, what else?

Speaker 5:          32:08          I'm trying to look at my list of Shit here. Anything else that I wanted to talk about? Uh, Oh and I lost my list. Well, I guess that, well, there goes that, um, anyways, I'm in Not New York City for the, uh, the Patrice O'Neal events, um, benefit I should say. Uh, the third annual time is flying by and uh, this is such a wonderful event. So most positive thing I do every year. And, um, we've got a hell of a lineup this year as always. A, we got some new faces, we've got some new, uh, this is the first year. We actually fact we've got a couple guys on that were, uh, you know, I think got to see Patrice before they were even comics, I'm guessing by their age. Michael Che in Hannibal Burress. So that's pretty cool to have that sort of element. Like watching people who were influenced by Patrice has comedy before they started, or at least very early on in their career, they were able to see him. Um, so I'm really looking forward to that. And once again, it's just such a great benefit and a, all you guys who've gone out throughout the years in a bought tickets, it's really, you know, had such a positive

Speaker 5:          33:15          effect on, uh, the people that Patrice loved because you know, unlike a lot of fucking charities where there's an infrastructure and there's people getting paid, nobody gets paid. Like I said, the only money we have to spend is the money that to rent out the venue and then the rest of it goes to his level. And so it's really just like direct, like, you know, when you want to help wounded warriors and veterans, like you just wish you could just be like, give me the name of the person and where they live and can I just fucking write a check to this person directly? Um, then of course then they would just put it in the bank and then it would be considered income and then they get taxed on it. Right. Is that what it is? Uh, these fucking cuts. I don't know how to do it. Uh, but I think the way we're doing it is about the best way you can do it. By the way, did you see all that shit on fucking no more

Speaker 5:          34:06          that they don't really do anything other than just raise awareness. It's the biggest fuck any, I'm telling you right now. I am done with any charity that says they're there to raise awareness. Fuck no more. Fuck that. Uh, pink shit in October. All of them. It's a bunch of it. They're the modern day slim, slam snake oil salesman. They're all getting rich off of, of of people dying of diseases or get beaten up, spousal abuse, all of that. They literally going out buying fancy cars and nice houses because regular people feel like they're doing something. I don't know. I don't know. Of course. And I haven't investigated any of it. I think they're all full of Shit and uh, I'm done with it now I'm done. But I'm done with, I think I'm pretty much done but just about every one of other than a,

Speaker 3:          34:56          okay.

Speaker 5:          34:56          What's that one that Danny Thomas started.

Speaker 3:          34:59          Okay.

Speaker 5:          34:59          That one has just straight up like a five star rating. Is it Saint Jude's hospital? That one. And then the thing I talked about a few weeks ago, which I still haven't done cause I've been overseas, we, she'd see if you're a match for the, uh, bone marrow transplant, we thinking literally saved somebodies life. Like those types of charities that are transparent. There's just a handful of, if you know. But isn't that, isn't that the truth with everything? I mean there's a lot of people that play music, but how they are really good charities are no different. Everybody. All right, let's get on with, um,

Speaker 3:          35:35          okay.

Speaker 5:          35:35          How is this a bad thing? Is it bad to think someone's a bad mother because they still wear leather pants? It's probably a bad thing, right? I'm here in New York and I was sitting down eating at yet another bad slice of pizza in New York City. You know, New York City is just like Chicago where it's known for its pizza. So there's so many fucking places that are living off that reputation that like, you know, you have to talk to somebody that lives in Chicago and they'll tell you where to go. And pretty much still there's like five fucking places maybe in each city that people will recommend it and everything else is bullshit. So this place across the street of course is bullshit. And I'm sitting there, I meet my slice of pizza and they got some sort of a Latino judge, Judy thing going on. And, uh, which is just at a total different level where on this show the defendants can actually put their hands on each other,

Speaker 5:          36:35          I guess once once a, uh, the prosecution, once it, the family, whatever I want to have the fucking legal term. It's the person bitching and the person getting bitched at. They can actually, like when this guy, he actually ran up to this woman and ripped her shirt open and pulled out, like, I don't know if he was bitching that her bra was stuffed and uh, that's what he was suing her over some sort of false advertising. I have no idea the sound was down. And even if it was up, it was in a different language and I was the only one watching it other than the guy making pizza. So when he ripped her shirt open, I screamed out what this pizza place? And everyone's looking at me like, what am I talking about? By the time they looked up, they'd cut away. So I dunno. Maybe they thought I was some sort of red, had a Latino guy and I could read lips or some shit. I don't know. What, but anyway, so this woman walks in, his lady walks in with the two kids. She's got a leather pants and high heels shoes and just right there. I just immediately judge was like, she's, she's too fucking self involved to be a good mom. Then I was like though you too. Oh, because of what? Her pants and her shoes.

Speaker 4:          37:42          Yeah.

Speaker 5:          37:43          Am I wrong for saying that ladies? I would love to hear from you. And is there the male equivalent to that? Wouldn't that be like the guy, if you saw a guy, he's a dad of two when he comes in and he's got his hair highlighted in his fucking eyebrows shaped up, you know, looking like he's trying to do the a book, a role for the Ricky Martin Story. You know, maybe wearing some Cologne, you know, aren't the both of them still kind of horn it up? Like are you still trying to find a mate? Like what's going on here? Probably everything. I said, you know what, somebody's probably gonna take an extra for that and then put it on there and then it'll be a little sexless rats, although blood, they bullying ass fucking morons. Um, anyways. Yeah. There you go. I'm just being honest, like I feel like a, if I see a woman with kids, she's wearing leather pants. Uh, I'm going to say that, uh, I dunno, somebody might fall in a swimming pool and it's going to take you a minute to get there.

Speaker 7:          38:49          Okay.

Speaker 5:          38:51          Ah, Shit. Anyways, Hong Kong, h o n k, Honk Kong, by the way, people who live in Hong Kong are known as honkies. How funny is that? Well, I think it's funny. Hang on.

Speaker 7:          39:06          MMM,

Speaker 5:          39:08          yeah. Right. Hong Kong, Hong Kong. Oh, by the way, India, there's so many fucking people. They're like you. It takes you a minute to be able to breathe that fucking air. I definitely felt like I've done a couple of times live in, in Los Angeles. I've gone on a hike, you know, in my leather pants, you know, but I don't have any children, so it's okay. My leather hiking shorts and if I am jogging a little bit and, um, you know, breathing hard or whatever, I felt a burning in my chest

Speaker 6:          39:39          on a, like really smoggy days. But, uh, I was not jogging when I was in India and there was definitely this, this like, you know, it takes a second fee about it to get you so, oh, it's going to be this level, you know?

Speaker 7:          39:53          MMM.

Speaker 6:          39:55          Having said all of that and as much as a pain in the ass as it was to get the fucking slip and all that, I can't wait to go back.

Speaker 7:          40:02          Uh,

Speaker 6:          40:03          alright. Hong Kong bill, you probably already talked about this, but can you speak about the pollution and the constant tickle in your throat caused by the air over there if you haven't already? Oh, that's what somebody experienced that in Hong Kong. I didn't feel that. I felt that in India. I felt there was that tickle in your throat?

Speaker 7:          40:21          MMM,

Speaker 6:          40:23          there was definitely, it was definitely hazy, but la gets hazy.

Speaker 7:          40:29          MMM.

Speaker 6:          40:32          But, uh, I would think a lot of that was, yeah. There's just a zillion people over there.

Speaker 7:          40:36          MMM.

Speaker 6:          40:39          Yeah, I dunno. I don't want to start saying a bunch of negative shit. It's already enough negative shit about a lot of places over there. They're fucking amazing cities to go to. I highly recommend it. But yeah, there's definitely a zillion people and you see the effects on the environment, which is why it's funny when people deny global warming and that we're having any sort of an effect on the environment or any of that type of shit. And the little for years that was the fucking earth is heated up and cooled down. Jesus fucking Christ. Um, I am not a scientist, but they seem to be very alarmed at the rate that it is heating up this time and this time of year, people always point at snow storms and go ese. It's snowing in February. Uh, this one scientist guy was saying that both the summers and the winters are going to have, are going to be really erratic.

Speaker 6:          41:33          And uh, all I can say about it is I hope that the, the, the people who say it isn't true are right. Because if we're having effect on it and we're not fucking with the population other than to keep adding to it, uh Oh my God. I almost said the worst joke ever. Forecast calls for a shitstorm. Oh, I'm such a Gemini, sorry. Sorry to anybody who ever remotely even liked or enjoyed comedy because I just ruined it, a part of it. You know what I mean? What I just did to comedy with that awful joke was like during a war when a city gets bombed and uh, you know, a really old historic building gets blown up. That's what I just did really built. I think he just told a bad joke. I think comedy will be fine. You fucking jerk off. All right. Foreign music. Billy, have you developed a love for any music you've heard while traveling?

Speaker 5:          42:30          Um, I traveled so much, I didn't have a chance to take in to too much of anything. Um, I will tell you that, uh, when I was in

Speaker 5:          42:43          Singapore, I think it was in Singapore, I walked into that hotel that has the infinity pool at the top at your, you're not allowed to go into, I discovered unless you were a guests, I just wanted to walk out and go see it. And they were like, ah, no, I'm sorry I can't do that. And then the lady was like, well, he's doing a show here in town. And they're like, yeah, well have fun at the show. You still can't look at the pool. Um, when I was in the lobby of that hotel, there was a, it was these women playing.

Speaker 3:          43:17          MMM.

Speaker 5:          43:19          I don't know if these instruments from Asia basically, as far as I can tell you, you know that one that has to strings, but you hit it with little hammers. They haven't. And every karate movies that I've ever watched, um, not during a fight scene. It's usually when the person comes to the hero comes to town and, uh, the hot girl in the village that the Douche bag that the heroes is going to have to fight. Notice, notice this is the hair off when it comes to town. And then that guy immediately hates the hero and then they have to fight over her vagina basically. Um, you know, that instrument that's played in the background. I liked that one. And I liked the music. I like the moods that that creates. Uh, by the way, I'll tell you right now, Chinese girls, a fucking hot man. Good Lord. Beautiful fucking stunning. Um, same thing with the women is Singapore. They all got some cutie pies. You know, every God damn country I went to, every country has cutie pies. I'll tell you that. Say That right now and have as far as music, I didn't fuck listen anything other than I heard that shit in the lobby. Um, that was a, you know, it's funny with the hotel we were staying at and, and, and uh, Hong Kong, they, uh,

Speaker 1:          44:34          they had all these beautiful fucking women working there. All these Chinese women, right? And they all had names like Susan and Ethel, meg. And then you'd walk out and go to a store across the street and everybody would have like Chinese names. And it's just like Jesus Christ. What are you doing it? I know your name is Helen.

Speaker 7:          44:57          Okay.

Speaker 1:          44:57          Fuck, I forgot to do that joke when I was in, you know what? I wanted to open with an India. I was just so fucking tired. I forgot I was, I wanted to open with like, you know what? You know what? I was nice to be here in India and I know I've already probably talked to most of you on the phone. And by the way, we all, everybody in America knows your name is Scott. You don't need to do that. Is there anything else I can help you with? What is your name? Scott.

Speaker 7:          45:27          Okay.

Speaker 1:          45:28          No it isn't. My name is Dakota. That's going to be funny when the updated to those fucking awful

Speaker 6:          45:33          celebrity names. People name their kids now the fuck do they name him? Your name? Your kid like carburetor or some dumb shit like that? Uh, you help my wife give birth the fuck out of here. Um, well she heard that joke I did a few minutes ago. She'd have a miscarriage. Uh, you helped me with my wife. Give birth. Dear Billy boy, I am writing to you from my lovely wife's hospital room and she gave birth to our beautiful and thankfully not redheaded little lady. Oh fuck you. Uh, my wife was a complete ship going through 29, long hours of labor. Holy Shit. The what did they get bitch longer than we can if they're fucking bill to take 29 hours of labor, you think you're going to beat them in a fight about whether you can watch the game or not. Fucking it's over before it starts. One round loss.

Speaker 6:          46:27          Um, and now I have a huge respect for mothers everywhere after seeing what an intense process that is firsthand. Anyways, that's hilarious. It took 29 hours of labor. At what point did your, your opinion start to change our 17. Do you know? I ain't got to say Seo. These mothers, they got something. Um, that's funny. Then I'm judging that lady wearing the fucking leather pants. She probably went through 29 hours to write, at least between the two kids and the fact that she can still fit into leather pants, you know, I dunno. Maybe that's my insecurity, but I think she's still trolling for cock. Uh, anyways, let's take that out of context. Let's just shove that somewhere. Put that on the news. Anyways, my reason for writing is while she was in labor, I tried to play some music to help distract her from the, from the uh, contractions. After about three songs and a few contractions, she said to me, and I quote, this music isn't helping. I need something

Speaker 5:          47:29          else. Put on bill burrs, podcasts, bullshit.

Speaker 5:          47:36          Jesus Christ was, that's probably why she pushed it out. She wanted US fucking stop hearing my dumb voice. Obviously I obliged a woman giving birth to my child and we sat there listening to old freckles distractive from the pains of labor. I am sure that nurses were a bit confused when they heard a litany of shits, fucks and cons coming from the phone. But we didn't care because it was helping. Thanks for all you do and for helping distract my wife for awhile from her uterus trying to push a little little wrecking ball through the birth canal. Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. Well there you go. See that like podcasts can be used for things that are good. Right? Isn't that lovely? All right, go on to the next one. A coworker, dear William, there's a woman, or as I like to say, fuck and lady at my, at my workplace who I am in love with a, there was a project and I was handpicked. Oh fuck. I just forgot. You know, this is, you know, something that I love about traveling is the random shit that you see. Somebody bought me a cigar.

Speaker 3:          48:47          Yeah.

Speaker 5:          48:47          Um, when I was in New Zealand, thank you, by the way. And they had a cutter and matches and all that shit. Not Everybody. You heard that? And I said, thank you. Please don't do that. Nobody else do that because I'm really trying to cut down my habit. Um, but I appreciate the gesture. So anyways, he gets me that. And by the way, if you're gonna pick out a fucking cigar, you got to pinch the ENT where you put your mouth and it's supposed to be spongy, supposed to go in, and they want to come, supposed to immediately come back and then it's going to have a nice draw. The rest of the cigar, it doesn't fucking matter. All right. And, uh, cause if it's hard where you put your mouth, um, it's like you ever have like a straw and a milkshake that's too thick and you can't even fucking enjoy it. Uh, that's what ends up happening. But having said that, that's another reason why I don't want to fucking cigar from someone in the crowd because if you actually pinching it, I don't know where your fingers are bent and is, it just gets gross. So anyways, but I'm smoking the cigar anyways and uh, I'm in Auckland, New Zealand, right?

Speaker 3:          49:50          Yeah.

Speaker 5:          49:51          Had a great show, played this unbelievable theater and they had this Oregon there that it was one of the top five or six organs in the world. Um, and you know, you see an Oregon with those giant pipes, you just think they're playing and that's the pipes that you seeing is, is you know, with, and be all that music's coming from. It isn't, it's actually those pipes are uh, just for shelf for the most part. And you go in the back. We, she took, this lady took me in the back, there was three floors of inner workings to this Oregon and are telling you

Speaker 1:          50:27          like giant rooms of things that you know, opened and contracted like a goddamn accordion and then all these different size pipes all the way down to these little things you could smoke crack out of that all were part of that sound and I guess these old guys would come in. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          50:43          Every, uh, like monks to retune it, you know, I don't even know if it needs to be tuned that many times, but uh, I guess they love the fucking Oregon so much. They used to joke, it was like their train set. But um, anyway, so it's just as far as like random shit that you see some smoking this cigar

Speaker 6:          51:01          and it's like one in the morning, I mean fucking New Zealand, other side of the world all the way down there. Fucking Antartica it feels like. And all of a sudden somebody walks by, I swear to God, it's like a Mitchell and ness art monk Jersey, a Washington Redskins Jersey. I'm looking at is that a fucking Redskins Jersey? I mean Auckland, New Zealand and then look at the back and it's, it's art monk. Not only is it a choice, a fucking great joke. Who the fuck has an art monk Jersey? Great Choice. What are the health? Has that, that's one of my, uh, I hated him when he played because I was a big time cowboys fan back then before, uh, ill Jimmy's face facelift came in there and uh, Jerry Jerry facelifts came in.

Speaker 3:          51:48          Okay.

Speaker 6:          51:48          Jerry Jones and Jimmy Johnson. I was, I've never been able to keep those two straight. Uh, so anyways, I liked, that's the type of shit I like. It's just the randomness of that I saw and there's a bunch of, of bootleg Yankee Shit because wearing like a Yankees hat or anything New York is just like, you know, it's like the fucking chicken. Where's the parish shirt? That's never been there for a little Eiffel tower someday day. But they're not like Yankee fans. Actually, I heard a funny story of some mets fan, I guess fucking living overseas and couldn't stand that because none of them because he wanted to like shit on the Yankees as a mets fan. Like, I don't know, it doesn't really have a leg to stand on. But uh, he find out that they were just wearing them to wear them. And uh, oh, the other thing too is when you go into a country that doesn't really speak English, I've told you this shit and I saw this in France where like, like the shit that they have an English never makes any sense or it doesn't, you know, it doesn't mean what they thought it meant.

Speaker 6:          52:46          Like when I was in Hong Kong, I was reading their tee shirts, the way they read our tattoos, you know, we get the Chinese characters where you think like this means like brotherhood. This means serenity and it really just means like a, you know, take a left on fuckhead street or whatever the hell it means. Um, somebody had a,

Speaker 3:          53:06          yeah.

Speaker 6:          53:06          Oh Christ. I knew I should have written down. I can't remember.

Speaker 3:          53:10          Okay.

Speaker 6:          53:11          Somebody actually had a football jersey, but the numbers 69 on it and where the name when it's said all night, all night 69. There you go. This guys wants to get some and give some all at the same time. Good for him. Uh, anyways, coworker dare bill. There's a lady at my workplace who I am in love with. There was a project and I was handpicked to help out in her department. Not sure why, but there were plenty of other people who could have done it. Well, maybe it was fate, maybe it was cupid, maybe it was, I dunno what, something bringing it together. Anyways, this person says, because of this, we have worked together on numerous occasions when I'm doing something on the computer and she's sitting beside me helping out, I can't help but notice she's looking directly at me. Jesus, Buddy. How many more fucking signs do you need here? Sometimes she will be one aisle over bent over a desk.

Speaker 3:          54:11          Okay.

Speaker 6:          54:11          Talking to someone and adjusting her tight jeans where she knows I can see it. Okay, this took a left turn. I ain't seen relationship here, buddy. I'm seeing, uh, seeing a fun time for about six weeks and then I'm seeing you losing your job. That's what I'm saying now. All right, let's keep reading here. We work in a large building and she has all the way on the other side, so weak. So we correspond by text messaging. All that's always good. Good move, good move. Get it in writing, write something lewd to her. Uh, believe me, she'll keep every one of these and when it goes south, she'll fucking show it to your boss who probably also wants to banger. Um, we work in a large building way my way. Oftentimes when I text her about work or have questions, she doesn't respond. I'm guessing if she was into me, she would reply back immediately, but touch, sometimes I get nothing.

Speaker 6:          55:04          Or is she playing hard to get? I really want to make a move, but there is a fear of hostile work environment or worse, I get fired for sexual harassment if she doesn't have the same feelings towards me, it's killing me not knowing what to do because all I do is think about our thanks and go fuck yourself. Ps, I'm married and have kids and so does she. Oh, fuck you. And that was a big waste of time. Ah, Jesus Christ. All right, I think that's a podcast for this week, right? That's not, that's that. That was a pretty decent effort. Once you say decent effort all the way around, uh, that's the podcast. I want to thank everybody who came out to my shows as I toured the south of Asia. I still can't believe I got to do that. It was fucked up. I was in two countries that had one of the wonders of the world and I saw neither one of them. I didn't go to the Great Wall and I didn't go to the Taj Mahal. Uh,

Speaker 3:          55:59          so

Speaker 6:          56:00          yeah. What are you going to fucking do it? I tried. You know, I did my think. Um, anyway, so I am in New York City right now and I'm doing the Patrice Patrice O'Neal benefit tomorrow night. And uh, I dunno, I'm on different time zone. I might go out to the clubs tonight. Who knows? Who knows? That's the Monday morning podcast. Go fuck yourselves. Thanks to listening and I will talk to each and every one of you next week. All right. Thank you for your patience. I know it's coming out later. See Ya.
