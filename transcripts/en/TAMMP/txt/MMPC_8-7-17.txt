Speaker 7:          00:10:14       There's no intelligence. You just spin it. You can be the smartest person on the world and you're going to roll loser turn.

Speaker 24:         00:10:23       Bankrupt and it's fucking over.

Speaker 13:         00:10:27       I like watching Jeopardy when you know there's somebody just you just can't defeat this guy and all these other smarty pants get on there and their whole life. They were the fuckin smartest one you know.

Speaker 18:         00:10:39       You know those people that don't like drink and they'd like they play board games like let's play Trivial Pursuit. You know what I mean. Let's let's play whatever those fucking games I have to tell you some of the saddest moments in my adult life as I've gone to parties and all of a sudden a breakout board games and you ever see like when somebody is on hidden video and they start looking around like What the fuck and the crowd starts laugh like that's the look on my face like that and then I'm going to do this.

Speaker 6:          00:11:12       They're not doing this other does this everybody have to play. I don't wanna do this. I don't wanna fucking do one of my five year old you know are we trapped in a fucking cabin and then there is no television.

Speaker 13:         00:11:25       No. This is crude. You can connect pretty I'll play some cards. You know I like how cards is like the only other cards it's just like there's a sleazy vibe to cards that I've always enjoyed even though I don't play a lot of cards. But you know even like those fucking old ladies seen some old lady with their bony fingers fucking shuffle and not even look and talk and some shit. She's got a favorite little candies right to the right you know in a dish. You know I saw an old school old lady today I was in I was down at the grocery store buying some fuckin food right.

Speaker 1:          00:12:00       And this lady comes around the corner she add on like this turquoise blazer with like some sort of brooch. I forget what she had underneath it. She had white slacks on white shoes and a white purse. Just old school dress to the fucking night she look great. Total fucking class act made me miss my grandmother.

Speaker 7:          00:12:25       My grandmother was a sharp dresser. They think those people they knew how to fuckin dress you know what I mean and then they did buy a pair of shoes. God

Speaker 6:          00:12:31       damn it they took care of not like us today you know.

Speaker 18:         00:12:38       Well every black person I knew there was took care of their fucking sneakers. You know what I mean. Keep the fucking things look brand new. You know taken out a god damn you know the nail brush scrub in the sides right. There was another white privilege moment right now you could just have dirty sneakers and that was OK. Me and I went outside and you got dirty and you keep watching me just. He's always gonna be dirt out here man.

Speaker 25:         00:13:02       I mean when Patrice just give me shit for my sneakers being dirty I was just like a fucking beauty pageant. He's like Bill if you were black and you walked out. I mean I'm not black. This is totally socially acceptable for me. I get it. You have new sneakers on. Congratulations.

Speaker 13:         00:13:25       Anyways I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. I'm doing this this Sunday night because as always I have a million things to do during this time of year as we're writing Season 3 3 3 of episode family family family.

Speaker 4:          00:13:40       We're going to be recording Episode 3 and writing episode 4 this week. Big shit going we're almost at the clubhouse turn here now it's actually the guy coming down the backstretch. You know I think we'll have five. Written and recorded by the end of this this month. And I know what you guys are thinking. So what does that mean. It comes out December. Oh no. No there's like 40 different other things you have to do to it over the course of the next. I don't know how many months before it finally fucking comes out. I have no idea. We were joking one time I think by the time we do the sixth season I'll be in my late 60s but I have to tell you I really fucking like it.

Speaker 6:          00:14:24       I really like doing it and I really enjoy being in the writers room you know. Some days it sucks when like this shit just doesn't work and my brain isn't working and I'm fried some of those days suck but generally but then you know and everybody else is saying funny shit so that makes you get going you know. But I actually really enjoy writing dialogue. Who would have thought you know in a way I can. You know some guy who says nucular can actually write a fucking episode of television you know just think about that. Okay.

Speaker 18:         00:14:57       Think about think about that and then stop complaining about who is president right now. Okay. If you can say nucular and then you can fuck me.

Speaker 2:          00:15:06       George Bush you say nucular the amount of people that fuckin laughed at him and I want to be like Hey are you bilingual. Can you also speak Spanish. Did you go to Yale. The guy went to fucking Yale. All right. I don't give a shit if his dad got him into what is a legacy. He still went there. You still got that education.

Speaker 13:         00:15:26       Still gonna be a member of the skull and bones.

Speaker 2:          00:15:29       I think it's why I had that laugh because he knew we didn't belong there.

Speaker 6:          00:15:33       He knew he got his feet just got pushed down that fucking road you know. Well you think he really wanted to do.

Speaker 11:         00:15:42       I think like what you do after your prayers after President really lets people know how much you love the job. You know what I mean. And like he just fucking desert Bill Clinton he still you know Bill Clinton was all about the horse you know so he's still he's still out there giving speeches. I don't know his fucking Dad's right. He's still out there. You know. Jimmy Carter's is building fucking arms there now and then he got fuckin. George Bush he's just he's fucking hanging out like a trust fund kid.

Speaker 18:         00:16:14       He's just sit around Peyton did you see that documentary rich kids like one of the saddest fucking things I've ever seen in my life was these people they were born into such wealth like one of them was that they were part of the Johnson Johnson family which I think a lot of people don't know what that is but like when I was growing up everything was made by Johnson and Johnson.

Speaker 13:         00:16:38       I'm sure they got bought out whatever but when I guess when they bought that out Johnson and Johnson they built it in that their kids would always just be taken care of and would have a I don't know a position that competent they would just get money is this fucking beast that Johnson and Johnson built just the inertia of that fucking thing just tearing through the capitalist economy right was just so big that they just think just like if they get the skim member fucking casino the scam that their kids still get the scam and the fuckin scam alone they get a little fucking duffle bag of cash that they don't ever have to work in their life right.

Speaker 6:          00:17:22       And I would think that that would be too. That would be the fucking greatest thing ever. That would be the greatest thing ever. And it kind of turned out that it wasn't. I think it would be the greatest thing ever if you actually. Lived the other way first but even then I think I think it'll get boring after a while. Do you think you could do it.

Speaker 1:          00:17:45       I think if you just had enough money well you never had to work again. My thought would be well the next big thing in my life is I'm gonna die. That's the next eventful thing. I have no deadlines.

Speaker 26:         00:17:59       I have no worries Oh my my.

Speaker 16:         00:18:05       I would get like Psycho obsessed with shit you know.

Speaker 1:          00:18:12       Like I do already but then like my real life takes over. I can play drums and lead once again for us. I'm a fan of playing on fucking time and then like my real life to. You get to go to the writers room and then it eases it off. Like if I just fucking was sitting there like when I was talking to guys about that building in Manhattan the one looks like a giant cigarette something Park Avenue.

Speaker 4:          00:18:32       And I was like What the fuck is that thing that thing is bigger than the Freedom Tower. And I went back and I looked at those pictures that they have from the penthouse in that building and that bathtub.

Speaker 13:         00:18:45       Bathtub everybody has now it's shaped like like the fucking Chicago Bears stadium. You know that one that freestanding one is not on legs like it's it's big. The ladies love it evidently. Right. And it's right up on the fuckin window and you can just look out. All the way south of Manhattan past the Statue of Liberty to see the fucking and you know whenever the Germans come to attack us again. Think you know this person in the fucking tub is gonna see it first right. The Japanese I should say. I just figured that side of the country you know the Germans would be coming right with their nuclear weapons.

Speaker 18:         00:19:28       Actually why would you bring it over here. You just fucking shoot it off when you. Anyway so I was just looking at and I was just trying to imagine sitting in that tub taking a bath.

Speaker 11:         00:19:38       That would be one of the saddest experiences you could be could possibly have.

Speaker 15:         00:19:44       It looks so fucking lonely. First when I saw I was like holy shit that's fucking unbelievable that looks like. Feel like I'm in a helicopter but you're like in a fuckin building.

Speaker 27:         00:19:57       But then just being that high up you can't even hear the city anymore. Just how quiet it would be.

Speaker 11:         00:20:05       You know you lit it. You're getting to that level that thing that astronauts see.

Speaker 27:         00:20:09       You know like the astronauts they would go out and they would orbit the earth and they would just look down at it and they were above all the bullshit all the politics all the religion all the fucking war all the disease all the suffering and they looked down and they were able to see how beautiful it was the paradise that we actually live in we just sit here with all those petty shit and these guys would come back and they couldn't talk to anybody about it couldn't give anybody else that perspective unless they talked to a fellow astronaut.

Speaker 7:          00:20:42       So then they would just be you know pulling up to a stoplight. They would see something they would just randomly start crying.

Speaker 28:         00:20:51       I think that would happen if I took a bath that high above fuckin Manhattan.

Speaker 29:         00:20:59       And you just looking out all.

Speaker 16:         00:21:00       Why can't why isn't.

Speaker 2:          00:21:04       Why don't we ever do the right to be philosophically just stay why don't we do the right thing why are we always like you can't.

Speaker 29:         00:21:09       That's that's. That's the scary thing it's what all pilots are a little fucking weird. There's something weird about going up there and just looking down at all of it you know like a higher being.

Speaker 7:          00:21:22       That you also get to see what the fuck would do into the planet. It's a really fucking it's a weird thing.

Speaker 29:         00:21:31       And then you combine that with the fact that you'd taken a bath. One of the most relaxing thing ever. Just looking down at this fucking terror. I don't know.

Speaker 19:         00:21:40       I also kind of wonder like with global warming like what's going to happen.

Speaker 6:          00:21:45       You know I'm sorry.

Speaker 23:         00:21:47       Climate change. I didn't mean to shock you by saying global warming I hope I didn't ruin your day with those two fucking words let me say climate change you can fucking relax a little bit.

Speaker 18:         00:21:56       Still understand why they say that climate change. It's like wouldn't Halliburton changed its fuckin name right. Well they changed it to peaches and cream. I can't fucking remember.

Speaker 6:          00:22:05       Anyways I was just thinking that like the more like severe the weather is gonna get like what will that mean.

Speaker 18:         00:22:16       You know like we can expect some crazy storms we've never fucking seen before. I wonder if they took that into consideration when they built that goddamn thing. Then all of a sudden you know we're going to start getting like like steroid era Mark McGuire era of fucking.

Speaker 6:          00:41:24       I understand that. So what. So are we. So are we. You know.

OK so can we we already we already have ours ready to go their latest test puts most of the US all of Europe and a good portion of Africa within range of their weapons.

Speaker 2:          00:42:00       Yes and all of those places are in range of our weapons and Russia's weapons so you know I mean look I'm not saying it's great that this guy has this fucking thing but just imagine if he had what we had. What the fuck would we be doing. Wouldn't we be doing the same fucking thing. Well we've got to get some stuff here. He's making that shit because we got our shit. Right.

Speaker 39:         00:42:37       And if they are actually able to successfully launched from a submarine as they are attempting to do this. This not only increases the range but can potentially dramatically increase the amount of time we have to respond. If they were to launch a missile what would happen sir.

Speaker 6:          00:42:55       That's it. Everybody knows there's no end game to this shit. Okay it's okay. It's gonna be over we would have time to respond.

Speaker 2:          00:43:18       Having to turn on the TV and have somebody has to try. It's like news now is just scared the shit out of somebody and offered no fucking solutions and then normal people just sit there screaming at each other to the point that this fucking dope is taking the time to turn my podcast which is supposed to be a break from all of that shit. Which is why I just say silly shit about it. You turning this into Meet the Press if that fucking asshole shoots one off poignant right at my house because I don't want to survive it.

Speaker 43:         00:44:06       We're fearful fucking lunatics.

Speaker 7:          00:44:10       Who for some stupid reason were given the ability to fucking intimidate nerds so they would build all this shit for us and now here we are.

Speaker 6:          00:44:19       Here we are.

Speaker 23:         00:44:50       Like what are we doing now. Now we're gonna fudge the fucking numbers so these people look like they're out of their minds but everybody else is fucking OK. This is like commie countries are like community colleges where they will figure out what their number one and so they can fuck and put it in their pamphlet.

Speaker 4:          00:45:07       OK. Let's read some more fucking depressing information. This is why I don't watch the news today that it did.

Speaker 44:         00:45:15       And that doesn't even mention the network of concentration camps across the nation and the people getting less than subsist less than subsistence levels of daily calories.

Speaker 11:         00:45:26       Well I mean they're also not allowed to trade with anybody are they you know they really can't get their shit going right.

Speaker 44:         00:45:32       I mean part of that is us trying to force them into giving in to get them forever twenty ones in Starbucks there isn't that right. I mean I might be wrong.

Speaker 1:          00:45:42       So I fuckin watch sports I watch sports I listen to music. OK.

Speaker 27:         00:45:48       I block all this shit out so I'm sure I mispronounce some words here to put that into perspective. About three hundred eighty eight thousand slaves were shipped to North America from fifteen twenty five to eight nine 1866. It's obviously a huge issue. Well how do you how do you put that in perspective without telling me what the population of Korea is. And also three hundred eighty eight thousand people back in but between 15 25 in 1866 was a way more significant portion of the population than it is today. Correct. So I don't know what you're saying there sir but I do know that whenever we have an issue with the country all of a sudden we pretend to care about its people.

Speaker 39:         00:46:37       Unfortunately there isn't any easy solution to the problem. Even if China withdraws their support and the regime regime collapses you're still looking at a potential civil war in a nation with nuclear weapons. Let's just hope people smarter than you are I can find a different solution to the problem and then they won't. There's only one solution.

Speaker 19:         00:46:57       Gotta go in there and get them.

Speaker 39:         00:46:59       Keep up the good work. I love hearing you talk about us how awesome it is to be a parent instead of constant talk about how hard it is. As a dad of two boys there are obviously days when I feel like ripping out what little hair I have left. But the vast vast majority of the time is just awesome. Look at this. He was actually just informing me and I got all fucking defensive because all this week people said that I said new killer instead of new clear. Yes sir I realize he's out of his fucking mind. I realize that person's out of his fucking mind.

Speaker 27:         00:47:26       The guy before him his dad was out of his fucking mind OK. Trump is out of his fucking mind. I'm out of my fucking mind. OK. Nobody should have weapons other than your fucking fists and whatever you can grab in the kitchen. That's ideally that's what that would be better.

Speaker 6:          00:47:44       All right. I think I don't understand why war is legal but it is.

Speaker 7:          00:47:51       So this is the game that we play with each other and it is fucking inevitable that one day somebody is going to go Martin Sheen dead zone and what are you gonna do.

Speaker 6:          00:48:05       Yeah out.

Speaker 11:         00:48:07       See people this is why I have all four sports packages because I don't want to know about this shit.

Speaker 27:         00:48:15       I don't want to fuckin sit here and watch the news and have them scare the living shit out of me that now this is going to happen. You know and some flies going to bite me and then I have a baby with a little head. Somebody else is going to fucking blow me up. Yeah just I just I don't want to talk about this. OK. Trying to keep it light on the podcast here.

Speaker 43:         00:48:36       Let's just make this just laugh at me not being able to pronounce words don't bring actual facts into this podcast.

Speaker 11:         00:48:44       All right girls softball team punished. Hey there billy batting glove. Did you hear about the girls softball team that was removed from the World Series because of a picture of some of the players flicking off the camera on social media. One of the girls on the team is the daughter of a family friend. It's fucking brutal.

Speaker 18:         00:49:09       Yeah I mean I don't know. I don't know what I don't understand social media. I'm kind of over it. Other than for business purposes. I don't just don't think it's a good thing that should've just been a funny picture that they all took shared amongst themselves. But now you upload it and everybody sees it and you know somebody is going to get offended. Let me guess. Were they the best. Well they probably were the number one seed.

Speaker 11:         00:49:33       This sounds like one of those bad news bears things.

Speaker 18:         00:49:40       They were removed from the World Series.

Speaker 7:          00:49:42       Well well you know how you know people are there trying to make money they make money off that World Series is a national thing. I don't know. It's like the Colin Cameron Dick thing everybody's fucking flipping out and immediately thinking that this guy's not getting hired because of racism. It's like the NFL is a fucking Corporation. Okay you know what they give a fuck about money. Now look if he was trying to get a coaching job or own a team then yeah I would say racism would be more obvious but like what he does most of the league is black. Doing.

Speaker 45:         00:50:16       Okay. Their thing is they're such cheap fucking cunts they would rather lose a fucking game.

Speaker 23:         00:50:25       They probably have an algorithm going like OK if we get this guy and he wins a few more games.

Speaker 20:         00:50:30       How many jerseys will we sell versus the amount of people who won't buy a jersey because we signed this guy and I swear to God if if if we'll sell a fucking Jersey less by signing a guy who would actually make us a better fuckin team I swear they will decide not to sign the guy. I don't. I'm not saying this isn't racism involved but it's really it's fucking economics and what these fucking corporations try to do is they they don't want any bullshit they want smooth fucking water that's what they want everybody fucking just tow the fucking line that's what they want and I'll tell you all these fucking groups that are trying to make change.

Speaker 23:         00:51:14       No that shit. Which is why they always complain to the advertisers because the advertisers will then pull. Sponsorship from TV shows they'll do it from fucking podcasts. Everybody knows that. So the NFL is a corporation. So that's what they're doing.

Speaker 46:         00:51:28       I don't know what the fuck league these girls are in but I'm sure they have some sort of stupid conduct thing that they're trying to you know trying to uphold.

Speaker 1:          00:51:38       Yeah. It's fucking stupid. It's also fucking stupid to upload that picture. I mean how many of these dumb stories are you going to see where people get offended by absolutely nothing and it's something happens right.

Speaker 4:          00:51:51       That's unfortunate. It's unfortunate. All right. Trent Reznor This is like a way more serious podcast than I ever want to do. I don't know. I don't know I have to do it. I must just start making up shit here I try to read the news but it's just all depressing.

Speaker 7:          00:52:04       Although the funny one was all this shit coming out about Lady Diana now I just don't understand how new evidence. Twenty years later they're fine. They found out that fucking she was listening to Prince Charles jerking off talking to some other lady on a toilet.

Speaker 20:         00:52:19       Did somebody have that tape for fucking 20 years going hey to listen to this I swear to God don't tell anybody I have this I'm going to release it when the time is right and then you just hear the echoing sound of Prince Charles going Roy again putting your ass your arse.

Speaker 7:          00:52:36       All right Trent Reznor article A Billy boy Billy boy he thought you could relate to this.

Speaker 47:         00:52:41       Trent Reznor talks about what it's like to meet his parents kids you meant to say is kids parents while having a body of work with lyrics like I want to fuck you like an animal. Yeah I read that article but never underestimate the power of celebrity and especially I know he's an older dad. So maybe they don't even know what his fucking music is but you know I wouldn't give a shit I sang I downloaded that focus so I fucking loved his stuff. That shit came out of that album blew my fucking mind.

Speaker 25:         00:53:20       I believe that's Trent fuckin Reznor hey sweetheart that's Trent fuckin Reznor.

Speaker 6:          00:53:26       I wouldn't give a shit you know but it's gotta be weird. But then there's of course the people that don't like it you know the people there were like the for each club and you know what Adam they wanted to fuck someone like an animal and he expressed it all right.

Speaker 11:         00:53:45       Court girlfriend cheating after joining the military and I legally can't leave her what she's a girlfriend.

Speaker 27:         00:53:54       All right. Dear Billy ball balls. He's a good this week you guys usually you know. Lately there's been a little drought is a fucking funny this week all right. Greetings from Scotland. Recently I quit my well-paying job to join the British Royal Marines.

Speaker 39:         00:54:12       My girlfriend of four years was very hesitant and didn't want me to leave. But it had been a dream of mine since I was 14.

Speaker 44:         00:54:21       I sat down a week before leaving and gave her the opportunity to separate my girlfriend for years is very hesitant and didn't want me to leave but we'd been dreamers and unfortunately I sat down with her a week before leaving and gave her the opportunity to separate on good terms and maybe continue our relationship.

Speaker 23:         00:54:38       When I had finished my mandatory four years service.

Speaker 48:         00:54:41       But if we stayed together but we stay if we stayed together and she cheated she would be dead to me.

Speaker 46:         00:54:48       I'm half Sicilian by the way. She chose to stay.

Speaker 23:         00:54:53       The fact that you were given the option to leave. I mean how much you give a shit about this woman. I was in for just over four weeks and fell during a run in a six six month server guys stood on my leg breaking my tibia in two places. Oh fuck. I was given the choice of staying in medical custody on base and rejoined training when I had healed or leaving for a year. I chose to leave so I could spend more time with my girlfriend. Oh. Oh I thought it would be a nice surprise to not tell her I was coming home. Oh Jesus.

Speaker 2:          00:55:26       I arrived home around 9 p.m. on Thursday. Oh my God. To find my girl oh jesus choking on some guy's dick.

Speaker 22:         00:55:37       Wow.

Speaker 23:         00:55:40       So what did you throw your fucking crutches at him. Naturally my instinct was to beat the shit out of the guy but I'm not too mobile with a pair of crutches. I forced the two out of my house and kept my promise of your dead to me by changing the locks. The next morning and blocking her number and social media accounts around 2 weeks later I received the letter from a lawyer saying that if I don't take her back she can legally take half of all my assets including the house my mother left me in her will because we had been together for more than two years what I thought you had to be married.

Speaker 47:         00:56:19       But lo and behold the British justice system does me another solid.

Speaker 23:         00:56:25       I could understand if I was away on tour from 9 months that she cheated but for weeks fucking for weeks you gotta be fucking kidding me. So I just take the loss and leave this dumb whore. Do I take her back and try to forget the fact that she took the first opportunity she had to jump on jump another guy's bone your bones your input would be great and maybe can put a funny twist on this fucked up opportunity for your listeners. Do you need to get a fucking lawyer. You need to get that bitch out of your life and get a fucking lawyer.

Speaker 6:          00:56:53       That's what you need to do.

Speaker 23:         00:56:56       All right. That's one of the dumbest laws I've ever heard in my life and that's going to cause.

Speaker 1:          00:57:02       That's going to cause people to make some really fucked up decisions. If someone can screw on that fucking bad.

Speaker 6:          00:57:09       All right. Over here. If the statutory. Statutory rape. What is it. What is it. What is the fucking law when you've been illegally married.

Speaker 18:         00:57:22       That's squatter's rights what the fuck is it. I don't know. Over here it's like you gotta be living with somebody for like 7 year depending on the state.

Speaker 46:         00:57:30       And at that point they considered it so dumb that she's entitled to half his shit especially if she's not making any money and you're fucking paying for everything you know.

Speaker 1:          00:57:42       It's fucking ridiculous. What a fucking cunt.

Speaker 2:          00:57:48       You know what I mean. I mean how many fuckin stories do they do out there about men beating women and how awful men are to fucking women right. Which obviously they've got to shine a light on that but look at this she's she's gonna just fucking whore. Who sucked this other guy's dick. Doesn't could care less about taking half of the house that your mother left you Oh my God what a fucking cunt.

Speaker 15:         00:58:13       Dude I would get a lawyer.

Speaker 10:         00:58:17       I would get Oh my God I would get a fuckin lawyer.

Speaker 2:          00:58:20       What a fucking piece of shit dude like I only I can't even.

Speaker 16:         00:58:23       This is like making me angry that someone could do that to somebody what kind of a piece of shit.

Speaker 2:          00:58:32       The kind of person that fucking blows somebody for we said. But even then there's plenty of women that would do that. There's plenty of fucking women that would do that. They wouldn't take your fucking house. They were raised right. They get caught sucking addicted guy.

Speaker 11:         00:58:46       You know fair enough and they leave Jesus cry. We get a lawyer sir. I would get a lawyer and I would fuckin fight this thing find some fucking thing that Oh my God.
