Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's time for the Monday morning podcast from Monday, August 29th, 2016 what's going on out? Why? Yeah. Ah, I'm back. I'm back on the time. No more jet lag and all that. I apologize for the, um, I sounded like I was coked up on my last fucking podcast. I was listening to what I was cracking up. I was like, I literally sound like I'm wired out of my fucking mind, but if I didn't do that, I was going to fall asleep. Um, so sorry. Got a little loud. I got a little fast. I got a little hyper, but um, I think last night I finally beat, I was starting to fall asleep again. It's seven. I kept falling asleep at seven, then I wake up at two 30 in the morning and I, that's not a good time to wake up, you know, as a person by yourself waking up at two 30 in the morning.

Speaker 1:          00:00:49       You, you, you have nothing to do but your mind to just sit there fucking with you. You know, what are you doing, Bill? You're getting older. I don't everything you're supposed to be doing and you just like, you're walking around, shut the fuck up. You know. Isn't it amazing how loud your feeder, when everybody else in the house is sleeping? It's so full at two 30 in the morning. You can literally like I'll be at my desk and I'll take a pen out of a glass cup and I swear to God by full, we'll start downstairs.

Speaker 2:          00:01:22       What was that? Oh that,

Speaker 1:          00:01:27       oh I'm sorry honey. I put a sock on.

Speaker 2:          00:01:31       Well can you keep it out of sleeping?

Speaker 1:          00:01:36       Everything is so fucking loud at that hour and a, yeah. So I've just been a last night I started to fall asleep again and around seven 38 so I just drove down to the Improv. Didn't even do a spot cause I felt like my head was in a cloud and I just fucking, I just walked around and talking to people and um, you know, it was great. I went down, I got a fucking salad, you know one of those comedy clubs, Salads. Except this was a good one. So I'm back right now cause I got to drop like fucking 10 pounds before I do my next special, which is going to be recorded, uh, in Nashville at the Ryman theater on October 21st. Uh, very excited about that. And, um, you know, I gotta I gotta drop like 10, 12 pounds, so I don't look like a fucking Billy fat head on this thing. So, uh, last week was the a, all right, I'll start doing some cardio, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Still eat like a fucking jackass and that, you know, but make attempts to not totally eat like a fucking jackass. And now this week is when, now it's like, all right, I'm going to the grocery store.

Speaker 3:          00:02:42       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:02:42       And I'm doing, I'm going back to my fucking that fucking, I need, need to lose weight diet, just like a third of a cup of oatmeal and a fucking egg over easy. No fucking toast. None of that bullshit.

Speaker 3:          00:02:56       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:56       And what do I have? Have like a fucking apple between then and, and then for lunch I have like fucking Turkey slices and some other bullshit. And then around four o'clock, I don't know what the fire of a protein, like a Turkey patty with a little bit of fucking salad. And then for dinner, a couple hours later there's another fucking protein. And sometimes I'll just go like a fuck it sell. It sucks. It's not fun. You know, my wife asked me to make a strawberry fucking shortcake, so I'm going to do that, you know, so I'll have that. I always got to have a little bit of crack on the back burner. But um, anyway, so I'm back into that. Just going to do fucking cardio. 45 minutes of fucking day over there and hopefully the ship, we'll uh, start to come off because a, I was disgusted with myself when I got back from vacation. Holy Shit.

Speaker 3:          00:03:40       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:03:40       Dude. I was doing that shit, putting on my socks and making those noises. Uh, uh, um. Anyways, I want to thank everybody who came out to, uh, the, uh, was it the Silver Lake Casino? Whatever the fuck it is. This silver something casino up there in Reno and uh, hey was I write about Todd rex t rex was, I write about Todd rex. I told you the man was a beast. I told you he fucking kills. I told you one of the funniest guys in the country, this fucking asshole. I say that most endearing way ever did 15 minutes in front of me and got a partial standing ovation. Okay?

Speaker 3:          00:04:15       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:15       All right. And I'm sitting there going like, dude, you're supposed to be opening the show. Like, hey, how's it going everybody? Let's get settled into the little fucking knock knock. Who's there? This guy did like a closing set for 50 fucking minutes. I heard it from the crowd when they clap, they didn't want him to get off. Um, but anyways, we had a, we had such a great time update. The crowd was fucking amazing. And I'll tell you an underrated, underrated right here and now is fucking not only Reno, but Reno is international airport.

Speaker 3:          00:04:47       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:48       I don't know why they were all international. I've never heard him. But where are you going? I'm going to Paris flying out of Reno, like I've never heard that connecting through Reno and then I'm going to South Africa. Um, Reno's international airport, um,

Speaker 1:          00:05:04       great food. I, when you walk right in, this is place across from where they have all these, uh, they have all this golf where by the way, which I am totally fucking addicted to those polo shirts in the fucking action slacks. You know, can I just just stop for a second? Can I just want to thank all the F unathletic fucking people out there. All the fat fucks. All the people who literally if they tried to bend down and touch their toes, they do a somersault. I just want to thank all of you for taking up that gate. Attempting to walk a couple of holes and rather than addressing it, dressing yourself and how fucking out of shape you are. You turned around and complained to the companies that your balls were too sweaty and that your shirt was too tight because all of your fat fuck complaints, right is, is basically created the most comfortable fucking clothes I've ever worn in my life. I wear them all the time now it's that get comfortable as hell and my wife hates them. So it's, it's,

Speaker 1:          00:06:10       oh, every time I walk out the fucking door, my wait, wait, wait. Are you going? You going to go meet Tiger Woods? Other the greatest fucking clothes over. It's unreal. You put on one of those golf shirts, you go to reach for something. It just stretches with you. You feel like you're doing yoga, but you're like just reaching for a donut. It's the greatest. If you're not wearing fucking golf clothes. All right, let me tell you something. If you're an old fuck, like you're in your forties, like me, 48 sliding into 50, you are a fucking asshole. If you're not walking around wearing just golf clothing, you know, and the sweet spot is, is to just buy the clothing and not get sucked in to that game. I'm not saying it's a bad fucking game. It's actually a fun, it's more, it's like, I dunno, it's like smoking a cigar with your friends, but you're also walking around hitting this fucking ball.

Speaker 1:          00:07:02       Um, I have a good time. Anytime I played, just because I do not take it seriously and I count every fucking stroke. I don't do any mulligans. I don't say there's any gimmes I come in and about, you know, I played nine holes. I come in and about a buck 30, you know, and I count every stroke and I do it loudly. So all the fucking cheat and cons that I go out. Well, it's a gimme that's a Mulligan fuck you're talking about, let's see. You know something that's the only fucking, I'm telling you, it's why it's not as it is. It is. It's an activity. It's a fucking skill. Okay. And the guys at the top level domain in the lase, they are athletes without a fucking doubt. But I'm just saying, you know, Michael Jordan plays a game of darts. I mean, he's still an athlete.

Speaker 1:          00:07:52       You know what I mean? Darts is not a fucking athletic endeavor. Right. I Dunno. All I know is the fucking clothes are tremendous. And um, you know, it was great. I was looking yesterday, I was actually watching this golf event. Um, I like watching on Sundays. Like, you know what I love about golf is how they try to act like it's this upper crust thing and you listen to the crowd and you can hear it with the people yelling. They all go to the track like golf and betting on horses in bowling, you know they're all fucking kissing cousins, all of them. All right? And Boland just is like whatever. We're fucking bowling. Eat a fucking grilled cheese sandwich as your role in it. We don't give a shit, but golf,

Speaker 1:          00:08:40       golf fans that fucking like that arrogant in l cut above type of thing. You know like Democrats, like Republicans are the bowlers of politics. They are not to pretend to be sub. They're not. They don't give a fuck about me. They don't give a fuck about you. And they don't pretend to. Democrats on the other hand try to act like they, they actually give a fuck about people when they get paid by the exact same fucking assholes. You know, they keep the fucking war is going. They know what's up, they know what's up. They didn't want to see that 1963 convertible limo pulling up to the White House staff. I don't want to get back in that thing. You will give them what the fuck they want or you serve will be taking a trip to Dallas. Um, I know I'm out of my fucking my, what am I so fucking podcast? Just relaxed. I don't know. Fucking read. Um, but when you listen to the crowd at a golf event, I'm telling you right now like, like, you know, you don't, golf actually has the nerve to fucking pretend. They think that they have the same sort of crowd that you find it a formula one event. All right? What you have at a golf event is a bunch of fat fucking dopes and really, really comfortable fucking clothes, you know? And anytime anybody hits the ball, why they all have to yell at the ball,

Speaker 2:          00:10:02       get it.

Speaker 1:          00:10:04       You know, they, he, he, you know what it is. You know why they yell like that? It's because there's so used to being at the track, yelling at the dog or the horse getting outcome. Right?

Speaker 2:          00:10:14       Come on, you're six. What type, right?

Speaker 1:          00:10:19       You take it to a golf Canada Golf Event Day. They, that, that's just how they're behaving. If you really look at the people, if you have time, they're fucking animals. And this is thing too. They know their animals and I know that they know their animals because those fucking assholes. We'll stand in front of somebody teeing off, looking down at like you ever see people like when the subway's late and they're fucking looking down the tunnel. They're doing that while somebody is driving a professional is God forbid. I can't believe nobody's ever gotten killed.

Speaker 1:          00:10:54       Good, fine. I mean I would have, I'd have a fucking pan if I was a professional golfer. Like that would be my nightmare. I hit some little kid in the fucking forehead. Um, yeah, the fucking animals. But anyways, uh, I cannot say enough about the clothing. So I'm sitting there watching the event and uh, one of the guys who of course is falling apart, they all end up falling apart. You know what I mean? All of these golfers, I don't understand what the fucking problem is cause I don't play the game. But I just don't understand it. There's nobody stopping you. Nobody's getting in your face. You know, like Tony Romo, you fucking rolled out and somebody tackled you and you're broke. You're broke bones in your vertebrae.

Speaker 4:          00:11:37       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:11:37       Standing over a fucking ball. You got a club. Just hit the fucking thick.

Speaker 1:          00:11:44       What is the fucking problem? You're already in the winner's circle. You're already going to win six figures. Everything else is fucking gravy. And then he's like, no, you don't understand dude. Yeah, it's a game against yourself will be once you have that one bad shot, you know you got, you got to forget about it, blah, blah. It's like, dude, you're literally describing life right now. I love, I absolutely love oversimplifying the game of golf because people have such a passion for it. And um, when people really enjoy something as a comedian, if you make fun of it, you get to see them get upset. And for whatever reason, if you're truly a comic, it, it fills up your heart. Not, don't listen to me. I'm fucking with you. I think golf's a great game. It's a fun me look, you get, you get yourself a six of course light, right? You get yourself a nice, a nice fucking stick. You know, I do that right now, but I'll tell you right now, I can't do 18 holes. I can't do what I like.

Speaker 3:          00:12:41       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:12:41       Do an 18 holes. That's like a marriage. You know what I mean? I'm going to fling. I want to do, I want to go to a fucking par three, nine hole course, you know? Uh, actually that'll probably go by too quickly. You know, from smoking a stick, whatever I do, your honor, I would just like whatever. Where am I go? Right. This is how I would like to play golf. I have a cigar. All right. I like the fucking thing I should do. Right. Set it down. Wherever the fuck I said I have a, I'll have the little fucking, they've got to have like a on your bag. You know what I mean? Remember a Rodney Dangerfield in Caddyshack. He had all those extra, you know, the radio. He had all that shit. There's no fucking way. They don't have an attachment where you can have your fucking lit cigar still gone. As you stay, have you address your ball, you mean stand over and get ready to hit it. Um, ugh. And those watching those fucking old fucking people getting down on their fucking hands and knees when they're on the green trying to read the Putt, you're watching their face getting all fucking red, you know, and you're just standing there halfway down the fairway. Well, you just fuck it that day.

Speaker 1:          00:13:54       Jesus fucking Christ.

Speaker 3:          00:13:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:58       Trying to take a couple of strokes off my game. Oh, kill yourself. Just hit the fucking ball. Just be happy. You're still walking around. All right. You Bacon and cheese on leading. Fuck. Um, that's another thing too, is then it always ends up getting backed up or, you know, something that I, I uh, I just feel too much stress when I'm playing golf. There's always that group of people behind me. There were always better than me and I feel like a fucking asshole. Like I'm ruining the day, you know? Like when the few times I've golfed, I feel the same level as stress. Like when I'm the first person and a red light to make a left, you know, and there's like five people behind me, like literally my heart starts racing because I know that not only is it my job to make sure that the person behind me makes it through the fucking light.

Speaker 1:          00:14:48       Okay. Like the, the person behind the person is that works out here in la by the way, for all you Boston people, so you don't fucking almost get yourself killed. You know that move you do in Boston with the light turns green and you just stomp on the fucking gas and you cut in front of people is, as far as I know, Boston is the only area of the country that does that and it's totally acceptable. Like as soon as the light turns green, you just stomp on the gas and fucking cut in front of two lanes of traffic out here. If you do that, you're going to get killed. Uh, nobody's ready for it. They're not good drivers and it's going to be at least three lanes of shit coming at Ya. Um, my brother came out and visited me one time and I forgot about that move and we were on like Venice Boulevard and the light turned green and he stomped on the fucking gas and I just put my foot up on the dashboard was like Doh, Doh, Doh, Doh, Doh, Doh, Doh. We made it halfway across and up and,

Speaker 1:          00:15:47       and he was like, you know, like when you don't, like when you're driving and you don't know what's going on in the other person's freaking out, but you can't figure out what you get. Like mad. I was, I was like, dude, dude, dude, dude, he just stopped me. He's like, he's like, why? Everybody's beeping at him. And I was just like, dude, you can't do that out here. You can't. And he goes, all right. Then we had to just sit there and everyone drove around us looking at us like, what the fuck? Anyways, getting back to the golf thing. So, um, so out here, one of my pet peeves is fucking people who's the first people in line. Your job, you get out into the intersection, you get out into the intersection, right. And you make sure that not only the person behind you, the person behind you,

Speaker 4:          00:16:29       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:16:29       Behind the person behind you. There you go to fucking cars back. Jesus bill. You know, that's why I feel like, like when I'm golfing, I swear to God, one of these times I'm just going to do, I'm going to fucking, I got this Gopro for my birthday. It's still sitting on my desk just mocking me. Gone. Yeah. You thought you could figure this out, didn't you bill? Yeah. He really thought you were going to use this fucking thing. Um, I would love to give a fuck in tutorial on how to drive in La. I really wouldn't, you know what I mean? And I'm talking, I just had to behave. There's too many fucking people out here. The traffic is fucking ridiculous. I just really want to do this. I'll even tell you how to be a good pedestrian. Alright. You get in the crosswalk, he fucking hustle. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:11       You know what I mean? I've, I've been with walking. Okay. And I see I'm approaching the intersection and I see that person wanting to turn in looking at me like, fuck, you know what I do? I stopped by wave from throw to third base coach waving like five cars through. Go ahead. Go ahead. Cause the second this thing's turns red, I can just run a crossed, it'll be fine. Five cars, we'll fucking make it and I'll get across no biggie or I can be a Douche and just completely not even pay attention to the situation you're in, in your car acting like I've never been that guy and just stroll across the street and I'll fuck at least two people out of the light. You know what I mean? You know, to start when I'm talking about right now I'm talking about having a little bit of empathy, which brings me to Colin Kaepernick. Oh, a segue. I am not going to watch, um,

Speaker 1:          00:18:04       I'm not gonna Watch any part of this story. Only thing. I'm a, I'm just going to listen to what he says, which is I think, you know, I'm not going to sit here and these fucking assholes on sports radio are going to try to get me all fucking stirred up. Like what he's doing is going to somehow bring down this country and second of all, like I'm going to say I can't, I cannot sit there and listen to a bunch of people act like they don't understand where this is coming from. You know what I mean? This is a good time. I think. I Dunno, I, you know, I'm not going to tell you what to do, but I think this is, for me personally, I'm like, you know what, I'm a white male heterosexual. I could basically within reason do whatever the fuck I want to do. Here's a guy who was making zillions of fucking dollars and he still feels this way. This is, this is, I should probably shut the fuck up and listen to what he has to say as supposed to. All of these soapbox cons saw this person. Like, you know, of course, you know, shows a picture of, of a soldier who lost both his fucking legs and writes all this fucking bullshit. And I so wanted to just tweet to the person and be like, Hey, let me ask you a question. What sets soldier's name?

Speaker 1:          00:19:17       You know, what happened to that person? Are they being taken care of? Do you know anything about that person? Well, you just fucking whored out though. The worst fucking thing that obviously has happened in this guy's fucking life is, is for your own political propaganda. I don't know. I can't even talk about it. I just can't stand white people who don't act do act like they don't understand.

Speaker 4:          00:19:41       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:19:42       You know, I don't know. But you know something, I can't even get mad because I'm a hypocrite. Everybody's a fucking hypocrite. This literally people out there, they're going to chastise that guy and act like they don't understand what he's talking about when, and completely not in touch with the fact that if he moved into their neighborhood,

Speaker 4:          00:20:00       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20:00       You know, let's just say he was unknown and a black guy moved into that neighborhood that, you know, how not thrilled they would be.

Speaker 1:          00:20:09       You know what I mean? But it says this, the amount of fucking people out there, it's fucking hilarious if you read what half the shit that people are writing this say as guys should be lucky to in this fucking country blood. And then in the, in the middle of that are writing racist shit. Um, that's why I think this is a great thing. I think it's great that he's doing it and uh, um, it's just a way that to open up by a little conversation. I mean, I dunno, as soon as, I don't think it's, it's, it's, it's going to turn into a bunch of people fucking yelling at each other as it always does. And then unfortunately, nothing's going to get changed. It's going to be a bunch people go on my kids in the fucking navy, my uncle thought, dear doctor, you're free to go back to fucking Swahili, write whatever the fuck they gonna say.

Speaker 1:          00:20:58       Completely ignore the fact that, you know, there was, there's been an astounding level of cell phone video over the last couple of years. Can you at least admit that? Have some pretty questionable fucking slash murderous behavior, all this shit yet your whole life that you heard black people saying was happening now this video, and I'm not saying all cops are bad, I'm not saying everybody black is fucking innocent. I'm just saying I've seen a lot of fucking people, black pinned on the fucking ground. No hopes of getting up shot the back of just shot in the fucking chest. So you kid, you know, if you're a fucking rational yeah. Human being, regardless of color, can you really sit there and act like you don't understand where that's coming from? So I don't want to listen to, uh, I dunno. I, I, you can't fuck it. You're going to argue with somebody on their experience. Let me tell you something. Your, your, your idea of how your life going is wrong. And I can say that cause I'm over here live in my own fucking life. So anyways, um, I think it's great that he's fucking doing it and hopefully it, it goes into a, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:22:06       in a, in a positive direction because, you know what, I don't, I don't think that, I don't think any cop wants to go out and shoot somebody that's innocent either. You know what I mean? I don't know what's going, I have no fucking idea what's going on, but I definitely think something ought to be discussed. You know, they're now I'm off my fucking soapbox, but I, I'm hoping more people than not won't respond to this guy with fucking anger. I really don't think that that's the way to go about it. Um, but in my heart of hearts, I know that that's what's going to happen. I know he's going to get booed on the road by a bunch of fucking lunatics and, uh, it, it's going to be ugly. It's going to be fucking ugly and there's going to be people holding up signs and they're going to make his life experience about them.

Speaker 1:          00:22:57       Um, which I think is a selfish thing to do at this point. Okay. Nobody's saying that you know, anybody who fights for this country isn't a hero. Nobody's saying that. I think this guy's just saying, hey, you know, my group of people is getting murdered. You know, innocent people are getting murdered in this needs to stop. Uh, how, how you could be against that, I don't know. And how you would then somehow wrap your fucking life into his shit when you know, at least I can't do that when I can drive down the fucking street. You only have fucking hilarious story. One time my brother in law, right, was going to move across this country and he was driving across the country in this sheer panic. My wife and my mother in law had it instantly a sketch to me cause I'm thinking, Nah, you drive it across the country.

Speaker 2:          00:23:47       You got to do route 66, you know, make sure you hit the arch

Speaker 1:          00:23:51       and they are in full on panic mode going, don't, don't drive at night. Always stop in major cities. Do not get off the highway in the middle of major said like they were in like you would think that this, that he was in Russia and uh, you know,

Speaker 4:          00:24:09       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:24:10       I mean right there, can you imagine? You imagine fucking driving across the country and if you get pulled off in the middle of nowhere that it could be a chance you could get shot to death just because you're reaching for your license. And I'm not saying it's fucking everybody and all that shit, but that, that is actually a, something that could happen to a citizen in this fucking country is, is pretty crazy.

Speaker 1:          00:31:40       okay. We got two more simply safe and MVMT watches. I'll, I'll, I'll read that shit later. Um, anyways, let's Talk Formula One racing. Everybody did. Uh, did anybody, anybody watched the fucking Belgium Grand Prix? I watched the replay of it. Thank God. I want to thank whoever texts me going, you watching this fucking race cause I thought they will off for all of August. Um, congratulations to Nico. Rosberg I don't know if that puts him back in front. I should probably look this shit up. Okay. Through the magic of the pause button. I just looked it up. A Formula One standings. Lewis Hamilton still in front of 232 points to Nico Rosberg's two 23 bite they go is really important to come out of the Craig for Nico to get a win. I don't know what happened with Louis for some reason. He started in 25th, um, 25th fucking place. Uh, for some reason he had a bunch of penalties or something. It's like he had a bunch of parking tickets and he's like, well, I'll just pay them all at this race. And they stuck him at the back of the race and because he's one of the greatest drivers are at least right now, he went from 25th to third. The guy still made the podium, which was pretty, uh, which was, um,

Speaker 4:          00:32:49       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:32:49       which is pretty amazing. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:32:52       I look at all of this, the gun, a little gossip here. I've never seen more people bumping into each other. Yesterday's race, it was fucking unreal. In the first turn. The Ferrari team, they slammed into each other while it's other client was trying to cut down low and then he says to his team, are they ran into me? It's like, dude, what were you were driving on the sidewalk, whatever the fuck you call it. Um, so anyway, somebody said Max for staff and will cause a massive accident sooner or later if he does not change as driving tactics. Ferrari driver Kimmy Raikkonen and says, oh, he must've ran into him. Reagan was angry after an incident during Sundays. Belgium Grand Prix, the latest of series of controversies related to the Dutchman's driving the fence said, if I had not break, we would have had a massive accident.

Speaker 1:          00:33:33       It will happen sooner or later. If he doesn't change, I am fine with good heart racing. But that is not correct. A raikkonen swore over the radio because of a tactic red bull's Verstappen had adopt. Oh he for stopped employment with the red bull. My fault has adopted repeatedly this year, which is to drive in the middle of the track and only make a defensive move at the last moment when he sees which way? The drivers attacking is coming for stopping, raking in and Ferrari. Sebastian Vettel vital collided at the first corner of the race with all three cars, suffering damage. But it was an incident on the chemicals straight later in the race that angered the fin. Other guys defend, but they do it correctly. Yeah, I uh, yeah, I guess you're supposed to, you're only allowed to make one move is somebody is going around you. You're allowed to make one move to get in front of him. He can't start fucking zigzagging back and forth. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:34:26       oh man. It's just, I don't, I can't, I can't believe I finally got into this shit and I, as you can listen, you know, if you actually watch this stuff, I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about, but I really enjoy it. And yesterday's race was the kind of race than I wish they were all like, I think when they're fucking bumping into each other, it was like fucking Mad Max, you know? And this track was crazy. They had like major fucking downhills. So He'd be coming up the hill and I learned yesterday, you know, they call it compression, the cars, you know, sticking to the fucking ground. So you've got a lot of traction. Then you come up over that hill and they say the road falls away from you, which really made my fucking stomach drop because it driving like, you know, 180 miles an hour with the road dropping away from now you're like coming out of this seat and this guy in this fucking yellow car came up over.

Speaker 1:          00:35:10       He lost it. He got it. Then he just fucking, it's unreal. If you saw what the car looked like after this guy's accident, you would have thought that like a family of five was dead and he got out his, his ankle was a little tweaked, you know, I don't understand why they can't make our cars like that. We just put on helmets and just drive like fucking lunatics that I mentioned. You guys help bad. I want to buy a motorcycle again. I can't fucking do it because everybody just tells me I'm going to fucking die, but I really want to buy. I want to buy a fucking bike so bad. I miss it man.

Speaker 1:          00:35:47       I want to get that Ducati, that Deval one, that cruiser have it all in black. And then on the side just right underneath where it says, uh, the name of the bike just had that little Italian flag sticker on it. That's all I want to do. And I wanna get it. But Saturday and Sunday morning at like six in the fucking morning, cause I had jet lag and I was walking my dog and be like, this is the time to fucking right. There's nobody on the road. Slow down at every intersection. Just look, take it through the gears, you know, ah fuck everybody. Last night it was talking to somebody, don't know you can't do it. I've had fucking three friends of mine, they'd died and I'm like, yeah, but when they were young driving like maniacs, Nah, they were great writers. Somebody else hit him and I'm just like, why can't they, I wish they could come up with like, like a suit you could wear right where right as you get hit. What are those? What does that thing that's stupid.

Speaker 1:          00:36:43       Then you put on your desk that people have where you can totally compress the thing or open, it's like a toy or you can open it up into this big ball. Ever seen that toy for kids? It's a little plastic ball. You can make it as a really small building. You make a big one. What if you just had that thing right? Because it would be heavy as fuck. I don't know. The solution is that you always just make carbon fiber always seems to be solution, which evidently is flammable. Is that what I'm seeing? I have no fucking idea. You can't be right. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:37:11       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:37:11       it always does seem a carbon fiber. Lee. A, the particles when they go to make it like the underneath the guy's cars on fire a little bit. Um, anyways, why can't they just have something like that? So when you get knocked off your bike, somehow it's senses it. This is in the perfect world and it just expanse this giant ball around you and, and the ball takes the hit right and you're inside of it, right? Isn't there a fucking way to do that?

Speaker 1:          00:37:39       I mean, I can Skype with somebody on the other side of the planet and there's no delay. Is that talking to me? And you can't come up with some sort of fucking suit that allows a fucking freckled cont like me to ride down the street. Oh my God. I, uh, if you go to Europe, there's no way to not get into motorcycles cause everybody's, there's so many people over there riding them. Um, and uh, I got into it fucking hardcore again and I'm trying to, uh, I'm waiting for that thing to go away and it's not going away. If I just wrote like twice a fucking week, six to seven. Yeah. I know. Everybody has to ruin it.

Speaker 4:          00:38:18       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:38:18       Why does this fucking business have to be in this city? Why can't it just be like in Montana? Just the middle of fucking nowhere, you know, just a bunch of self centered concert in the middle of that giant fucking state. And then he just fucking, you could go out and cruise on a bike. Still don't understand why it has to be here. All the fucking places to pick. They had to pick here at the middle of a Goddamn desert, a desert. Um, I always say dessert and then desert because of the Lake Greg, Greg Giraldo, when you talk about the, the, the troops right in the home during the civil war.

Speaker 4:          00:38:55       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:38:56       Like how eloquent they are. Writing was as opposed to like, you know, during the Gulf War, you know, age fucking hard. You're not have your ball sticking against your leg. Is you sitting out here in the, in the desert. A fucking Mr Gun. All right, let's uh, let's, let's read some questions here. For some reason, after all the ignorance, she just heard, believe it or not, people actually write in to me and they asked for my advice knowing that I have no background in psychology whatsoever. All right, so here you go. At your own fucking risk. Jeroen risk. All right, Kenya, uh, I built, I'm a Bostonian. Like yourself. Uh, I'm a suburbian outside of Boston and I get it right. Okay. I lived in a cul de sac and played street hockey. Okay. I wasn't, I wasn't down in southeast steel in cars. Good at math. Like an apples. It's a whole different breed of tough guy. All right. I had legos, I had Lincoln logs. I had a tree fort. Okay. All right. I'm a Bostonian like yourself that has a question for you. My wife is Kenyan and we have a place near a narrow Nairobi national park. The government is ramming a railroad straight through the middle of the park in clear violation of the environmental efforts put in place by past generations for the betterment of the Kenyan people. Uh, this park is considered a world heritage site and this construction would be devastating. Would you be willing to champion this cause with your connections?

Speaker 4:          00:40:26       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:40:26       What do, what connections do I have to stop? A railroad being built in Kenya may not going to lie to you. My last couple of specialists, we're pretty damn good, but I don't know if I can stop. He goes, I hope just to bring attention to this cause as it is being implemented very rapidly before people can complain about it. I can assure you this is a very good cause and deserves the attention of anyone who values natures nature. Now I'm off to fight in the traffic on the Jamaica way. Um, all right, wait a minute. Well you know, if you send me a fucking link or something I can definitely retweet it. Um, but I think the best thing for your cause would not be me to be a spokesperson as long as I don't have to speak about it because I'll tell you right now, I'm not going to read, even if I read up on it, I'm going to stutter and it's just going to, you know, as kind of come a cautious has a dope. Right. But yeah, just tweet me a link today and I will, I will retweet it. And um,

Speaker 4:          00:41:24       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:41:25       I dunno. I mean they're not listening to their own people. Then we'll still fucking comedian in la. Don't John Play yourself pill? Everything counts. We'll fuck it. Then I'll positive, okay, I'll, I'll join the God damn. Cause

Speaker 1:          00:41:37       I'll say don't build that railroad through that park. And then they'll say, well what's your other solution? You got to, you got an alternative and I'll say, no, I don't. All right. Concert Story. Hey there, Billy vanilla tits. That's a good one. A month ago I took my niece the little way and a couple of friends to a concert. They wanted to see, I get free tickets to lots of shows, Yada Yada. So I took, uh, we get there and I'm immediately and immediately I'm standing out in an ocean of teens to get into this thing. Another group of friends show up and they accompanied by one of the other girl's dad's. So we say hello and walk into this situation. It's pretty slow. At first, the opening band didn't have me in mind when they made music, but they were okay. The second band came on and they sounded real familiar.

Speaker 1:          00:42:34       The Dad says to me, I heard about these guys from bill burr. They're amazing. So I'm immediately like, I'm like, fuck yeah, this guy knows about bar. So after they're sent, we walk outside and decide, I would guess that was 21 pilots because I went to go see mute math and they opened, uh, for 21 pilots and they had a very young young crowd screaming like it was the fucking Beatles. Um, so anyways, so after they're set, we walk outside and decided to have a couple of beers while the kids enjoy the main act. That definitely didn't have us in mind when they made their music and talked about, uh, Jesus, she talked about me and laughed our asses off in the lobby. What a turn. Not only did I get to stay with my, is this like a fluff piece? Why was this sent to me?

Speaker 4:          00:43:22       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:43:22       Not saying that you sent the email, I'm just saying my fucking podcast guy. Uh, not that I didn't want to stay with my, my niece, but I had an excuse to let it hang with the friends without me standing there. And if I didn't have this guy to talk to, I'd be the lone dude in the lobby, or even worse on the floor watching the show. But it doesn't end there. All right. I'm guessing this is one of the email was sent. Here we go. While I'm standing out there, a girl walks through and asked me what time it is because her phone died. I answered her in a couple minutes later. We're talking about everything and anything. The other dad was a champ. He laughed at my jokes and then pieced out when he saw things going. Well, what was going well? Not like some married dudes. Uh Oh, what? This chick came. Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait. What?

Speaker 1:          00:44:11       Oh, I answered her in a couple of minutes late. Oh, we're meaning you and the lady. We're talking about everything and everything. The other dad was a champ. He laughed at my joke. Then pieced out when he saw things going. Well, I don't know if guys like that, right dad, he fucking made it look like this guy. He's holding court there. Has a guy right there that guy get, he gets in the intersection when the light turns green. He makes sure to cars by and it gets through. That's what I'm saying about that guy. He said, yeah, he made sure he peaced out when he saw things were going well, not like some married dudes who don't get out much and feel the need to flirt. So they have, uh, something to jacket too later. Anyways, I've gone out with this girl a bunch of times then and got into a new band that I love, whose name I won't name because you don't like to name names all because of all Billy original recipe tits.

Speaker 1:          00:45:02       Uh, thanks and go fuck yourself. Well that's great. That's great. You know what, and that's a nice fucking story for all the cock blocks out there. You know what I mean? Those people who fucking cock block, I've never understood that. It's such a like a, it's such like a, Ah, this is bad, so I'm going to trash women in this and I'm the worst. I was looking to see that such like a female thing to do. You know, chicks have that fucking thing where it's just like, well, if something good's not happening for me, then I'm in. Everybody around me has to suffer. That's like what? That's like the male version of that is the cock block. Well, if I'm not going to get laid, you're not getting like get the fuck is what the fuck is wrong with you. You know what I mean? I said fucking Douche. Who throws the lady out of the way and jumps in the fucking lifeboat on the titanic? That person, right?

Speaker 6:          00:45:53       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:45:55       I Dunno. I had fucked it. That's like male behavior and I still ended up trashing women. Like what the fuck is wrong with me? I mean, part of it is I have issues with women obviously, but the other part is it's just so fucking fun to annoy him. Maybe that's my fault. Maybe it's my problem.

Speaker 1:          00:46:11       Is it wrong that you'd rather annoy him than fuck him? Is that weird or is it just sort of a, as a different approach? Oh my God. The best people watching in the fucking world. Reno International Airport, that fucking burning man thing was coming in and I, I was going on, you know, a couple of everybody kept asking me hilarious. They're going, are you going to hang around and go to burning man? First of all, it's like two, three hours away from Reno, I guess. And secondly, it's like, dude, look at me. I was joking about that on stage. I'm a 48 year old fucking bald white dude. I'm not going to show up there and freak everybody out. I looked like a cop. Everybody's gonna be in the middle of the taken acid or whatever they're doing, and then I fucking show up looking like I have a walkie talkie on my, on my waist. I don't want to do that. That's, that's some young kid shit. I hate when fucking people my age right before the day, just totally just dead. Just too fucking old. Even hide it anymore. I hate when they still try to go to young people's Shit.

Speaker 1:          00:47:12       It's over. It's not your time. You don't remember when you were back in the day when I'd be in the clubs, you know, way back in the day, old Billy red face in the clubs won't bump it, don't, right. They'd always be that fucking old creeping. Then you just bleed. Looking at him like I remember just looking at somebody who was like 35 even like 27 started to seem old. Like what the fuck are they still doing their, we'd like 2021 fake ids getting this plane. There'd be somebody 27 in there. Like what? That dude, you should be like married with kids by now. That's what, 27 now here I am 48. I don't, you know what we were fucking mind to tell you what to do. It's just my own personal choice. I don't, I like going to adult shit. I want to be with the adults. I don't want to be um,

Speaker 4:          00:48:01       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:48:01       You know what I mean? I don't want to be around that shit. Oh, by the way, and speaking to young shit, I have to give a shout out to a DJ named Afrojack who I'm not going to lie to you. I never heard of the guy. I'm not in that fucking world and everybody's sending me this stag where he took a clip of some shit. I guess I talked about Djs like a couple of years ago. That's how it works on my podcast. I'll say something and it takes like two years before anybody really hears it. Like that car Dashi and thing or the Yoko Ono thing. Like I said, those like they did the podcast.

Speaker 4:          00:48:34       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:48:34       And it goes like two years goes by. And then somebody who actually has a, uh, a podcast with influence, like Joe Rogan, Joe Rogan blew up the Yoko ono thing. Um, so anyways, people would send me this shit and he did like a, I don't know, do you call it a song? Is it a track? Is, is it as something else? I don't know what the fuck is. I don't know what it's called. I don't know what the fuck it is. But he somehow aligned the shit up and uh, he put me in a song and um,

Speaker 1:          00:49:05       as much as I still don't get what the fuck is going on, I want to thank the guy because there's a bunch of young people in the crowd and uh, you know, performers, you need that. You've got to keep getting the next wave of young people is your fans start to get older. They have kids and they can't even go out if they want to go out. You know what I mean? Like he just, he probably just stopped me from going on cruise ships. He delayed that for another like six years. So thank you very much. Afrojack I don't know if your name is Afro Jack, like that's your first name or it's if it, your name's Jack and your nicknames Afrojack like you know, Billy red tits. I Dunno. I Dunno what it is, but I appreciate it. Thank you for, you know, whatever the fuck you know, what, how, how have you seen however, however you could say that shit.

Speaker 1:          00:49:48       Um, you know, it's funny, I actually watched this thing one time with Nia recently, this documentary on Dj a m can I just say that again and you guys so I can make you cringe again. The fact that I as old as I am just said that name, um, on Dj a m and I watched it and uh, I actually started to understand like, oh, what I to see the, I know there's an art to everything, but I actually was really starting to understand it and Neil was talking about how one time she and a friend of hers were in New York and went to some fucking club and that guy was DJ in there and she said it was like the sickest night ever have music and uh, you know, within 10 minutes of being in the club, everybody's like, who the fuck is a DJ? And then they figured out it's that guy and I don't know what it is.

Speaker 1:          00:50:31       I guess it's like what song leads into the next song? And you're, you're changing the energy of the crowd, which I'm relating to stand up, right. You don't open with the closing bit, but you got to open strong and then you've got to take him on a ride. You bring them up and then they go, they're going to give you burned out. You got 40 more minutes, what do you do? You take it down a little bit and he started building it back up Dan a little bit and then you're throwing them. Fuck yeah. You know, it's like wrestling. It's like what I did while I was stone cold fucking a podcast and he talked about how you can bring them up down, up, down, up, down, a little more higher, a little bit lower, a little higher. And then you get a right that last fucking moment and then they fucking explode and go nuts. So I dunno, I haven't said that well. Like I just fucking, I like seeing live drummers.

Speaker 4:          00:51:15       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:51:15       that was a problem my hand when I went to go see fucking lady Gaga, like I can, I can go see anybody. If I can see the band. She had a band and a fucking house. They're like, I was in this fucking cast on, she's riding around on a God damn horse.

Speaker 4:          00:51:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:51:28       Oh Jesus Christ. Jesus fucking Christ they believe was my quote. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:51:33       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:51:34       By the way, what, what the fuck's Tony Romo right now? Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:51:38       If,

Speaker 1:          00:51:39       if he was, it's hard to say this, you know, cause I could never retire from fucking standup. I don't feel I could and obviously he loves football. The way I love standup up, I would think, but like this is the time to retire. This is the time to just say, you know what? Fuck this. You know, it's like Ali, those last few fights, if he didn't have those, maybe it would have been a little bit different. I know. What the fuck am I to say that shit. I Dunno man. You fucking break a bone in your back for the second fucking time. Jesus Christ. How fucking tough is that guy by the way? Everybody always breaking his boss. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:52:16       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:52:16       And I probably shouldn't have said that shit. You know, I don't know if he's married and he's got a woman in his life because what if I just gave her ammo and then I just ruined his breakfast. Tony, do you hear this? You hear this podcast? You hear what this person who never played organized football paths, the fourth grade said, sorry, look at that. I'm sitting there fucking shitting on cop block. So then I turned around and I make a move like that. What a fucking asshole. That's, you know what bill, that's just typical you.

Speaker 8:          00:55:23       Um, here we go.

Speaker 1:          00:55:26       I think that's it. Okay, let's get back to the questions. What are the questions? I'm a little out of sorts here.

Speaker 8:          00:55:32       Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:55:33       okay. All this'll be a good one. Stand up at high school reunion.

Speaker 8:          00:55:38       Oh No.

Speaker 1:          00:55:40       Oh, this just has fucking train wreck written. I'll, uh, if this is a comedian and they're going to do stand up at their high school reunion,

Speaker 1:          00:55:49       uh, it takes balls, man. All right, Bill. Fuck you. Sunscreen burr. Uh, we've missed a couple of reunions now all my classmates are married with kids, so we, I'm guessing your significant other. I've been doing local standup for a while now, but that's been two hours away from where I grew up and none of my classmates have seen it. S. C. E. N. E. They haven't seen it. Uh, this is why it's great to get into show business. You can be as dumb as me and you can still be successful. Um, now they've asked me to do a set for the reunion. I'll admit it's different for people, you know. So your advice on going after the home crowd that knows you keep it clean, offensive, use your best shit regardless. What are your sunburned thoughts? My sunburned thoughts is you're out of your fucking mind. There is no fucking way.

Speaker 1:          00:56:44       There is no fucking way I would do that Gig. I'm going to stand up there in front of these fucking people that I knew for 15 years of my fucking life and having seen for 20 years, and I'm going to be as I'm looking at them trying to de age their faces and figure out who the fuck is who? Oh my God. And go right back to being like the, the pecking order. I'll tell you right now, you've got balls like right now, the fact that you just said that, you know I'm going to do standup at my high school union is the spider moment in Goodfellas where he goes, why don't you go fuck yourself, Tom? And then Dinair or goes, oh, tests like dead pause shows them in the 40 tell him to go fuck himself. You know, I, it's kind of like, don't take no shit off.

Speaker 1:          00:57:37       Nobody. Right? Yeah. Go ahead and do you know what dude? I say you fucking do it. And this is the thing, dude. I would, I would fuck, I would not hold back. I would give them both fucking barrels. The only thing you have to lose is, is if it goes bad, you're going to have a great panel story about bombing in front of people you haven't seen in 20 fucking years. Um, my advice would be, I would definitely, I would see the humor in the situation. How fucking ridiculous it is. Um, that's what I would do. You know, I don't have to make some sort of joke that, you know, after me, you know, fucking Joe Blow over here was a biologist. He's gonna come up here for 10 minutes and look through a fucking microscope or some shit. I don't know why, but I have no idea what I would do. Um, but I've actually, I ain't, you know what, I've done something like that. I'm like, I'm not gonna lie to you. I've done something like that. I, um, I, I did stand up in a bar in my hometown and there was, it just so happened there was,

Speaker 1:          00:58:44       there was like, I don't know, there's like a table of people I went to high school with and I'll never forget looking at them. The look on their face was holy shit that said fucking guy, he used to have snowball fights with like, they're not even listening to that. Just what they, this is the thing that they've there, this site, you're doing it. It's all between. It's all about keeping your own fucking head together. And uh, I'm not necessarily good about doing that. Like I don't even like seeing the crowd before the show. I hate that. I hate when before I go into something, somebody goes, hey bill, looking forward to the show or like gay really like your stuff. I hate that because I feel like I always feel like, well now what if I go in there and I bomb or what if you don't like my shit? And then you already said that you liked me and then you're gonna feel bad that you said that because I stunk. Like after the show, I'll talk to people after it went well and I felt like I gave you your money's worth. Then denim fine. But I feel like if I get compliments on the way in, um, I'm like a, I'm like taking out a loan.

Speaker 1:          00:59:46       Does that make any sense? I don't know.

Speaker 4:          00:59:50       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:59:50       So anyways, I, I gotta say as you, you, you got more, you got more balls than I do. And if that sounds weird and disjointed, like from that, my last thought is because I had to pit pause and go fucking shut off the air conditioner. Oh, it's going to be a fucking hot one today, you know? All right. I think this is the last one here. The last question. All right, last question here. Uh, ex girlfriend's sister. I hate Billy Birkenstocks. Uh, I'm 26. Um, and still in love with my high school sweetheart. We've been on and off again for 10 years and I've gone through a lot to say the least. Jesus Christ. Yes. I just got back from a two week vacation with her where everything was perfect and we had the time of our lives. This is the woman I want to start a family with and it became more and more apparent on this trip. Congratulations. What could go wrong? Um, here's the thing.

Speaker 1:          01:00:43       I slept with her sister on a drunken blacked out night three years ago while me and her, we're not together and we're on bad terms. Oh boy. My heart was broken and I had a lot of resentment. I was 23 drunk week. Shut the fuck up dude. You had a dick. You fucking jerked off to where while you were dating her other sit, stick. Get the fuck Outta here. Don't fucking come at me. I got a dick too. All right. Don't fuck. And our younger sister came on to me. Oh my God, you victim. Things were different then and I was a mess. Listen, I'm not saying you weren't fucking heartbroken. You A, yeah, you were fucking psych the next day. There you go. You know what? You just got to check off a whole family. Well you got left to do is bang them mother. Um,

Speaker 4:          01:01:37       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:01:38       That's got to be called something like the Grand Slam. You don't like when tiger woods won four in a row and they was saying he won the Grand Sake, you won, you won. All four majors would be if you bang the mother. And all the daughters. That would be the Grand Slam. Uh, the amount of guys. Laughter right now. Why the women are pissed. Uh, well a year or so later, me and my high school sweet, he started talking again. It started to become close leading up to where it is now. I had an unbelievable guilt for what I did with their sister. The, the closer me and this girl got years later. It is the only thing that I haven't been honest with her about and I had to tell her, you fucking idiot. No you didn't. You should have talked to his sister and just been like, look, what are we going to do here? You know, easy. Is it, how does it make things better that you told her that's such as and I, and then like for the rest of their fucking lives, that's going to be a problem between the two of them. Ah, Jesus, you shouldn't have said Shit and just waited till 20 years later when the sister, you know, who never got married gets fucking hammered and the guy, yeah, well I fuck Jasmin 25 years ago. And at that point, you know, what are you going to do? He'd be like, yeah, it was, dude, I was in the fucking two thousands. What do you want from me? Um, anyways,

Speaker 4:          01:02:55       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:02:55       He goes, well, a year or so later mean in the high school, sweet started talking again, blah, blah, blah, blah. I had an unbelievable guilt.

Speaker 8:          01:03:03       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:03:05       So I had a test sold the last night of our vacation. Oh my God. We were laying in bed and I told her everything.

Speaker 1:          01:03:13       I took a slap. She was crying for hours and it was as ugly as you can imagine. Well, you know what, Dude, I commend you. You got it off your fucking chest. He goes, I feel terrible. And I'm torn on if it was the right decision to tell her, my friends are giving me mixed answers and I would like an outside perspective from someone who I respect greatly. Uh, Jesus Christ. I appreciate the respect me. Um, I don't know. Do you know if it was really bugging you and you felt like you had to tell a good good, you told her,

Speaker 8:          01:03:46       you know

Speaker 1:          01:03:47       now you don't have to worry about that fucking thing coming out of nowhere. He goes, it is still fresh and everything is confusing on what is next. We love each other very much, but obviously I fucked up big time. Do you think this relationship stands a chance? I really hope it does, but I'm worried I ruined it. She seems to be getting through it better than I thought after her first reaction, she told me she loves me, but I really hurt her and she needs some space because when I'm, oh well she needs some space. I hope you don't have a brother because when I'm with her,

Speaker 4:          01:04:22       okay,

Speaker 1:          01:04:23       okay. She told me she loves me, but I really hurt her and she needs some space because when I'm with her she can't be mad at me. I'm not a scumbag and this is completely out of character for me to do. I just made a terrible mistake. Thanks to go fuck yourself. I will say the fact that you actually feel this level of guilt, um, uh, you're a better man than me cause I wouldn't have said Shit. I just would've just been like, well I hope this doesn't fucking come out someday. Well we're having a pumpkin pie over thanksgiving. Uh, and I bet there's a lot of people out there that live with that secret. My thing is not only the cowardly self preservation that I would try to have, I would also, I'm also thinking like this is, I, I would have handled that situation. I either wouldn't have said shit or I would just break up with her and just walk away from it because I wouldn't say, Hey, by the

Speaker 8:          01:05:18       way, I banged your sister and then for the rest of their life they have to fucking deal with that. MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:05:25       When I'm the piece of shit that did it. But I have to commend you that you actually felt that level of guilt and said something. Ah, cause I don't know. So it sounds to me that you're going to get past it. So the good thing is that now you don't have to worry about that fucking grand piano fuck crashing down on your fucking life someday. So that's the upside.

Speaker 8:          01:05:53       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:05:54       Maybe there's an upside that you told her where she'll have faith in you that like, wow, this guy actually feels guilt about stuff like that. So I can't trust them. We were broken up while it happened.

Speaker 8:          01:06:09       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:06:10       Let me see if I can get Nia in here for this one. Hang on a second. All right. The magic of the pause button again. The lovely Nia is here. Hi. Hey, I you doing watching the Vma is because you refused last night and we were walking cause I was watching the car race. Is that Formula One formula one was, is it called? Yeah, I said it sounded like a swarm of killer bees. It's a lot longer than I thought it was going to the corners. Yeah, I know. Yeah. Little playstation fucking game boy they have or a steering wheel now. I didn't know they had to go around 44 times. That's a lot of times. Um, well it's a long track. It's like a four and a quarter mile track. What's the going like 200 miles an hour. You can't fucking him driver on a parking lot.

Speaker 1:          01:07:03       God I know. But yeah, it was just a lot longer than I thought. And I know the first time you go to a race track you don't, you never, you can't, you can't believe how fucking big it is. Like I've, I've gone Bob Talladega and it just, it just keeps going. And you're like, oh yeah, they're driving like a 180 miles an hour. Yeah. So it's gotta be long. Okay, that makes sense. Yeah. And then I fell asleep so I wasn't able to catch up on all the moments everyone's talking about. I don't know what anyone's talking about, but the Vms, I have to go and watch, obviously the, not on MTV, but they're all, they're all online. Yes. Videos are still produced and made, cause you're always like, they don't even make videos anymore. They do make music videos, but there will have it, how do I say it?

Speaker 1:          01:07:47       They don't even make music videos anymore, but they're all online. But they do make them and they still have big budgets to, so that was gonna be my next question. All right. Ex girlfriend's sister. Oh, Geez. All right. Really quickly, this guy. All right. I'll give the abridged version A. I've been on and off again for 10 years. Just got back from a two week vacation with her. Everything was perfect. We had the time of our lives. This is the woman I want to start a family with a, here's the thing. I slept with a and a drunk and blacked out night three years ago while we met while we, me and her were not together and we're on bad turns. My heart was broken. I had a lot of resentment. I was 23 drunk week and her youngest sister came on to me.

Speaker 9:          01:08:29       Uh, no. I'll tell you, that's a rough one there. A real rough. Then you're like, oh, he makes himself the victim. She came onto me. I said, really? I said, dude, I have a dick too though, fucking light. And I stopped that. I said, you rubbed one out to her before you fucking eat. The seeds have been planted for a while that you've been wanting to fuck the sister. Don't try to act like, oh, I was so heartbroken. You and the sister or both

Speaker 1:          01:08:55       dirty. Okay, so here's the deal. He goes, he felt toward terrible the last night of the vacation, he couldn't deal with the guilt. So he told her, he goes, I tell him, he goes, I took a slap. She was crying for hours and it was ugly, as you can imagine. Yeah, I'm all right. She told me she loves me, but I really hurt her and she needs some space because when I'm with with her, she can't be mad at me. I'm not a scumbag and this is completely out of character for me to do. I just made a terrible mistake. So he's basically saying, do you think the relationship stands a chance? I really hope it does, but I'm worried I ruined it. She seems to be getting through it better than I thought after our first reaction. What do you think?

Speaker 9:          01:09:37       Yeah. No, it's, it's not going to happen. He fucked her sister. It's over. That's it. I think so. Yeah. Because I mean maybe, maybe there are some people who are more emotionally evolved than I am, but I couldn't get, but like that's her sister. Like her sister's not going anywhere and like how's it going to be at like Thanksgiving and Christmas and like all that kind of stuff. Like you're just going to avoid each other or just kind of like, it's weird. I mean maybe the three of them can have a threesome. That's what I was thinking. You can't, you can't have a threesome with your sister. That's disgusting. That's gross. I would never want to see each other on these bonds. Yeah. Talking to each other. Hey, I know we went to a, the waterpark. Oh No, stop. Unless the three of them sit down and both the guy and the sister are so repentant and so whatever. But like you, you'd never be able to trust them. You'd never be like, Oh yeah, can you guys run out and like, you know, get some extra sugar and more groceries.

Speaker 9:          01:10:49       Exactly. So, and that's the thing. She might be okay with him now, but in the end she's going to choose her sister like that no matter how her sister betrayed her. That's the sister. So you are disposable. You're just like the dude that's her family. So if you think that you really like hands on to her and the sister and the sister will probably get past it long, a long, long ways from now and it'll probably always still be there. But because their family family betrays each other all the time, you know it's a thing. I think what she did was worse than what he did. The sister? Yeah. Oh definitely. If we're going to like put them on, who was the worst person? That situation? The sister 100% here's what I learned. You never do that if you're with a woman. Okay, okay. And you guys break up and blah blah blah. If her sister comes onto you like you are effectively ending that relationship forever and only they told her her and the relationship, you think he should have told her.

Speaker 9:          01:11:54       The thing about it is, is that he told her because he felt guilty. So it was to unburden his own conscious because it wasn't real because there's nothing in telling her that would make her feel better and oh my God, thank you so much for being honest with me. That's the sister. So I don't know. I don't really know nothing. Nothing compatible that he had such guilt that he had to tell her. Not really, because people are paired with shielding all the time and they like, oh, I had just had to get it off my chest and it's like, great, congratulations. It's off your chest and now I feel shitty. So was that really for me or was that for you need Renee hill coming in and bringing the love? Yeah, I, I don't, I don't, I'm not with that whole like, well at least he was honest with you.

Speaker 9:          01:12:45       It's like, for what? For me now that was all for him to, I never looked at it that way. Wow. Yeah. Not that I don't think apologies are worthwhile or I don't, I, it's not like, I don't think that you should apologize for something you did wrong, but I just feel like you really need to question. That's what you were saying. Yeah. You really need to take that question. Your motivations for confessing something of this level. You know what I mean? It's like what are you really trying to do? A lot of times people are just trying to unburden themselves. Well that's what I was saying, that the best thing now is he got it out there so he doesn't have to worry about that grand piano coming crashing down into his life someday. Like I'm saying, well they haven't like fucking Thanksgiving dinner. What I want to know is what is going on between the girl and the sister?

Speaker 9:          01:13:32       Cause obviously that's no sister. That's no real. I don't know. That's what I'm wanting. Something else. Why that's fucked up is because now you know that the parents know. You know, you think she would have told the parents like, but if they know yeah. And then they gotta be like, Oh my God, we raised a whore and I don't think that she's a whore. She's on a horse. People make mistakes, but it's got some really, yeah, no, no, that's, that's beyond, that's a power thing yet it is total power. It is. I wonder if this was a younger sister and I wonder like, who knows? But that's what I'm more intrigued about now. It's like what's going to happen with these sisters? You know, that's like, that's some deep shit right there. So I don't know. That's like a power thing on her thing saying like, you know, it was much as you're into her, you still can't fucking resist me.

Speaker 9:          01:14:25       What is it? Yeah, maybe so because who does that? Who goes after the medicine to the female mind? I, I can't let you win on that. That's not a female thing. That's like a dirty ass ho bitch, nasty person. I don't know what that's like. I would never go after, uh, relatives like significant other. So where do you draw the line? What do you mean coworker? So you're not just so that people know because you really have strong opinions on this. So I want to know too. So family obviously. Yeah, no you don't do that. Yeah. If the person that is clearly in a relationship with somebody else and you know that all of that together, I want to know that. I want to know where you draw the line. Coworker. You've okay. You guys occasionally up lunch together with the sisters. Coworker. Yeah. And there's something the guy's got like he does like the Paisley tie with the suspenders. Camera's that something that you guys always go nuts about that no belt.

Speaker 9:          01:15:31       Yeah. Well if you have suspenders, you don't need a belt. So, but anyway, um, what if he has both suspenders and a belt and then you're thinking like, I don't know what it is that you're trying to do. Well maybe how would you have both when that, when that like get that thing, that female thing with like you'd feel safe. Like this guy's really going to have like he's going to have an alarm system and a gun. Yeah, and a sword and where to condoms. Yeah. No, I don't know about that. Yeah. No, I mean if they're not involved, if they're not like in a real relationship, neighbors, would you bang a neighbor when I Bang like my sister's neighbor? No, not your sisters. Now we're taking family out of it. I'm saying where? Where is the line where it's just like, well whatever bitch, you know isn't that you guys say you put the hand up, whatever bitch, what are you talking about? I'm saying, cause you're saying like that's family. You can't fucking do that. I was just trying to find a comedic angle here. Oh I see what you mean. I mean neighbor two streets over. Your neighbor knew them, invited you over and you went over there. You know what? I have a real life example of the guy. The guy was an architect. Okay. All right, I got it.

Speaker 9:          01:16:43       I have a real life example of this during, during my prom I went my senior prom. I love somebody else already. Wait a minute. I went with somebody who was just a friend. Okay. But my friend has Biz Markie, he was just depressed. Um, but my friend went to the prom with this guy that she had just met and they were set up by another friend. He went to a different school. So they didn't really like know each other. That was the day of justification. They was set up by friends. So I'm totally innocent. So really we really connected during prom and like, as you know, that was not what happened. As you know, my prom did not end that great. My parents like came and like took me from this house and I was in, because I was dumbing up, wait to tell them the truth. I called my parents because I was supposed to spend the night at a girlfriend's house, but instead we're going to be hanging out at this boy's house.

Speaker 9:          01:17:45       His older sister was there. There's a whole bunch of us were hanging out. I was having such a great time that I call my parents and I said, hey, just so you know, I'm staying here. My mom completely flipped out and she and my step father came and like extracted me from the home. So that's how my prom ended. Exactly. So it didn't end on any, it was a very traumatic, but ultimately they did the right thing. Um, but anyway, he, me and this guy ended up connecting and we ended up like dating afterwards, so you know, um, oh that's different. I thought you were saying that, you know, like I, we went in the bathroom like to the front part of the Limo and put the window up. No, no, no, no. But it wasn't her boyfriend. They had just met. I think she definitely felt some type of way about it, you know, only because he chose you over her.

Speaker 9:          01:18:35       Exactly. You guys didn't have any sort of like friendship, friendship? No. She and I were really good friends. Yeah. That yet. No, no, that's not good. Oh, that's a rough one. But it wasn't, Oh Fred, a lot of rough ones and we dated for a while. We dated up until, you know, like I went to college basically. And that was, that was the end of that. So it wasn't like this law of the term, you know, toward affair. It wasn't like he was my first love or anything. He was just really cute and a football player and Nice Bob Marley, you know. Hey, what can I say?

Speaker 1:          01:19:10       Sorted, sorted, sorted details here. All right, well that's the podcast for this week. Um, Jeez. And he came hard this week. You came hard. You're really fucking just put that guy you just said. You know what? And that's it. It's a fucking rap. And you know what? I think you're right. I think you're right. I could say that. Yeah. Cause I sit here and my yes. Yeah. How long have you had these fucking buddy? I've had these, as long as I've known you, he's fucking Pajama bottoms. There's two things that I'll never die. Pajamas, we'll never get holes in them. Right. And sweatpants. You cannot kill sweatpants it and made out of that fucking, um, I think we'll go do some break dance. Was it boogaloo something rather than one of the fucking movie is, yeah. Yeah. Whatever that fucking movie. Electric overload break electric boogaloo right, right. Those are is that breaks the breakin two electric boogaloo. There was such a weird period where all those dance movies are coming out. You know one of the worst dance movies of all time is footloose. That is some of the worst dancing ever.

Speaker 9:          01:20:05       It's, yeah, not a great dancing.

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       It's Brits Pretty Peak White Dancing. But it's still a fun movie.

Speaker 1:          01:20:13       Why, why are you looking at me like that? Cause I, I don't, I just, it's how you can fucking sit through the excruciating dances in that movie and still see the fun and it's cute and it's like it's a town where they live. That's right. Cause dancing and folks, was that an off Broadway play that they turned into a fucking, they made it into a Broadway show of course. Cause they always, that's where it should have stayed. Yeah. I don't know. You should have to decide to go. Kevin Bacon was hot in it. I remember that part where he goes and he does that Solo dance out of frustration in the barn and he's like flipping around on the beams in the ceiling along the barn. And he just, you know, now he's at the Billy Squier video. Who's Billy squire? Squire, the poor bastard. The guy was a foster this guy that you were like obsessed with watching off his videos when we were on vacation.

Speaker 1:          01:21:03       Yeah. Cause I, when I was watching them live and like Detroit is like this guy was a fucking rock star. You got to see the video. It's so bad. No, I remember you showed me the video. Did I show you when he was crawling on his fucking name? I feel bad too. Piling on. But like I know the guy already feels like it ended his career. What are you doing? I don't want, I said I wouldn't do it. I said it wouldn't do it and here I am. No, I don't know what it is. It's the, you need to apologize to Billy squire and get that off of your chest while he is. Why he's still feels shitty about, oh by the way, it's drummer. I guess it's pronounced shoon art.
