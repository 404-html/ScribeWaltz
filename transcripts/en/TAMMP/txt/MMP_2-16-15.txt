Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burr and it's the Monday morning podcast for Monday, February 6th, eighth, and I'm back in the USA baby. Finally I should say I'm back home, back home. And home is where the hardest. Don't you think? I actually, I have a new recorder. I don't know if the levels are too high here. I have no fucking idea. I can't really hear myself. Um, the old girl finally died. I mentioned last week, the Olympus Ellis 10 is what I had. And uh, they're all the way up to the 14th. And I got the 14, which I'm, I seem to be enjoying so far, although I can't stand the fucking lady voice. Every button that you hit, it goes like recording

Speaker 2:          00:00:48       back to main menu and it's this fucking English lady. It's like, what the fuck are you doing? Why, why? When the fuck did an American accent just become like, you can't have that. You can't have it on like you're, uh, like all these fucking, one of those things that I advertise on, on this podcast. It's like they try to give you like a, for your voicemail, you have some sort of international, just not from America voice and all of a sudden it makes it sound like you. Okay. Wow. I like this company. They must be fucking people over globally, all over the world. They fucking did you. Did you hear this?

Speaker 1:          00:01:27       Okay?

Speaker 2:          00:01:27       Did you hear the outgoing message? Oh, hello. Welcome to pink Barry. All of a sudden I think I'm getting a higher class fucking yogurt because what? Because it's got an English accent. What the fuck is it with the goddamn English that everybody thinks it's so fucking, you know what it is? It has to do with the fact that we're over here on our own God damn island. All right. And if it actually had some sort of French accent, all it does is remind you that you can't fucking speak the language, but what? Like English, all of a sudden it starts to sound a little hoity. Toity. You know who I blame for all of this? I blame Madonna.

Speaker 1:          00:02:08       All right,

Speaker 2:          00:02:09       let me tell you something about that fucking lady there. All right. She's from fucking Detroit. She grew up side outside of that fucking hell hole.

Speaker 1:          00:02:23       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:02:23       A, by the way, you know something? Oh, let's complete the thought bill for the love of God. See it through. Okay. She grew up outside of their fucking hell house. She does a couple of fucking woopty dudes around the world singing her dumb ass song in our mustard colored pumps and all of a sudden she's got a fucking English accent. It's annoying.

Speaker 1:          00:02:39       All right.

Speaker 2:          00:02:41       I've lived out here for fucking coming up on eight. All right. I still like, I still sound like a go down the tarp pike. You know I was just over in Asia that it come back. Sounded like I was from fucking India.

Speaker 1:          00:02:59       Yeah, know.

Speaker 2:          00:03:01       I mean Madonna, how much he is searching.

Speaker 3:          00:03:04       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:03:04       How bad was your fucking childhood? How bad was this country that you felt you had that you had it, you move to another one and then you took on their goddamn accent. Like they wouldn't notice.

Speaker 3:          00:03:16       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:03:17       Why am I jumping all over her? All right. Favorite Madonna Song? What would you like? Would you like the guilty pleasure or would you like the one that I actually liked the musicianship. What's the guilty pleasure one? Oh God. It was one of earlier ones,

Speaker 3:          00:03:36       you know,

Speaker 2:          00:03:39       before she got into all of that. I don't know what the fuck she was doing, you know, before the sex book, you know? Or it's just like, you know, I'll fuck anything her those years. It's like we get it, we get it. All right. Yeah. Like you like Dick, you like women too. You like Dick and women. You know you liked that fucking fat guy in a, in the Monty python, get a better get it buck. I'm going to sell APP except it's with Dicks. You know? It's like this new thing I've noticed with comedy with women, like that's like this fucking, it's considered edgy. If they talk about the clamps and it's just like, you know, with all due respect, you just sort of a bar hack at that point, aren't you? Aren't you just doing Dick Jokes? Because it's a vagina. All of a sudden, you know, they're taking good shoulder, their bodies. It's like, I don't give a fuck what you doing? You're doing a dick joke. My acidic with the pussy. It's the same fucking shits like Sam Smith with the Tom Petty Song. Right? It's the same fucking thing.

Speaker 3:          00:04:39       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:04:39       No, ah, stay with me. Um, it's just a fucking Dick joke. We could, everybody stopped losing their fucking minds over a dick joke because now it's a pussy joke. It's the same fucking joke.

Speaker 2:          00:04:55       Blah, blah, blah, blah. So let me get this straight. If you're shooting a loaded somebodies face, you're just a fucking, you know, a blue comic. But if you're taking the load to the face, you're groundbreaking. Is that how it work with you? God Damn kids today. Well, Hey, more power to you. And by the way, I'm just fucking with Sam Smith because that song doesn't sound anything like the other song. I guess when you speed up and slow down the other then yeah. Yeah. Then I guess it is the same sound is the same song. But like at no point that I ever listened to it and think of that Tom Petty Song and not to mention Sam Smith Song was way fucking better. And you know, there's people out there that actually say, um, what kind of going like, what the fuck? When uh,

Speaker 2:          00:05:40       when he said he had never heard that Tom petty song and like everybody was like flipping out mostly older people don't. What do you mean you didn't hear that? That big hit? That was a hit when I was a kid. This is the thing that you got to, you got to know about, about these to the kids. Dot. Right. They don't even know who the fuck Paul Mccartney was. Paul Mccartney came out and sang with Kanye west and like kids in their twenties they don't know who Paul Mccartney is. Some of them don't even know who the fucking Beatles are. And then those kids who know who the Beatles are, they listened to the Beatles and they go, what's the big deal? These guys are overrated because they're fucking songs are 50 years old. At least the early ones. She loves you. Okay. Okay. Yeah, all that Shit, all that shit in right then their, their, uh, their end shit there and shit, the shit that they did right before they broke up is as old as me.

Speaker 2:          00:06:40       46, 44, 45, 46 years old. They don't know where the fuck they are. So if you don't know the god damn beetles are, if they come out, you know, with Kanye West. Okay. And he sings a fucking song with them, they're not going to know who the fuck he. Yes. He, she looks like a, he looks like he should be like a civil war. Reenactor now he's actually more revolutionary war. When I think of a Sir Paul Mccartney, I fucking hate that shit. I hate how over in England they date night people dumb it set. Then what do you have a little fucking pretense? Sword fight really is Paul Mccartney of fucking, he's knighted now. What's he gonna do? Go storm a castle in a far away land or is he just going to put on a big silly necklace and get down on one fucking DEA? How the whole fucking stupid.

Speaker 2:          00:07:31       Um, but anyways, yeah, I, for the life of me, I didn't notice it. That was the same song and I don't get how that guy gets sued, but lady, a lady Gaga, it doesn't. With that Madonna Song, which was the exact same fucking temple and I guess the same chord progression and all of that shit where I would go in into like clubs or whatever and just regular people with singing the Madonna Song along to the Lady Gaga Song. I didn't fucking ever think of the Tom Petty Song with the Sam Smith Song and what I love is the second the lawsuit comes around, then everybody, all of a sudden everybody's Phil Spector. Now everybody fucking heard it, right? Everybody's got a gun in some fucking horse mouth going admitted, admitted. It's a Tom Petty Song, right? Isn't that what he did? Can you imagine being in a studio with that fucking weasel who's walking around with a goddamn gun coke dial up or whatever the hell he is? I just don't understand how people get into a situation like that. Like, how bad do you want to make it that you stay in a studio? The first time that guy waves the gun around, it's like, Hey Phil, I'm going to burger king. Do you want anything? Yeah, you pull an amps absentee father. Thank he just abandoned the whole thing. What's he going to do, do you think? A guy that fucking crazy, he still drives, probably has some old fucking Limo,

Speaker 4:          00:08:56       you know, really high roof so he can hold his fucking wig. Um, anyway, she'll listen it to the Monday morning podcast. I hope this thing is recording. I really hope it is because I can't hear myself right now. I have a bit of a cold. All right. I just flew around the world and the last fucking thing, I still can't believe I just did that Shit, man. Um, hey. You know what seems like a really hacky fucking city to go to is a Dubai and that's just from landing there and then seeing all their advertising, you know? Do you remember that? What was that fucking commercial they had where they fed those dumb whores? Uh, oh, you know what, I'm trying to get better with the add here. Borderline is my guilty Madonna pleasure. And then my favorite, uh, fucking actual song is bad girl cause of all Mar Omar Hakim is that he said his fucking drumming on, that's the shit.

Speaker 4:          00:09:58       Uh, and actually when they played it live, live on Saturday night live a long time ago. I remember, uh, just watching him playing the drums on that and thought he was fucking awesome. Um, but it's a classic radio hit. You know, you listen to it three times in a row and you're like, you know what? I don't think I have, want to hear that song again. And then you've got to wait like three, four years and then you listen to it again. Like oh yeah, oh yeah. Oh yeah, shut it off, shut it off. And that's what, you know, you have a head. Um, so Sam Smith gets fucking sued. What about that new song that Bruno Mars is singing on? Cause that dam funk gonna give it to you. I mean, how many fucking times it's that Song Ben Written. Don't believe me. Just watch how many times is that line been written? Doh, Doh, Doh, Doh, Doh, Doh to this. Here's that same song that save song comes out of his summer.

Speaker 4:          00:10:58       Oh Jesus. Hey. Don't believe me. Just watch. Um, but whatever the fuck you saying, I have no idea. Uh, what was I talking about now? I just all Dubai, that lecture seems like a, if Jersey shore was given out just to open fucking checkbook to make a Goddamn city, that just, that's what it seems like that with the little bit of a fucking car Dashi and Calabasas vibe to it. Like it seems like when people go to Dubai, they come back and I imagined they would say shit like, like Dude Day had a Lamborghini store next to a Ferrari store next to a water slide where you slitted of champagne, you know, all this fucking horse shit. And then outside the city they got like

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       a fucking tent city of all these fucking basically modern day slaves that had to build the whole fucking thing just by sitting on the airplane because we connected and do by. Um, after we left Mumbai, that used to be Bombay. Bombay is now suing Mumbai, just like Tom Petty suits. Sam Smith to same fucking city.

Speaker 2:          00:12:16       There's too many of the same letters in Mumbai that was in Bombay. Right? Would that be just the A, there's no fucking way I'm trying to do this in my head anyway. Spec to Dubai. So we, we connected in Dubai by the way, to then depart flyover. I ran and then over Russian, I'm fucking as an American, I am nervous flying over Iran. But then when I looked at the stewardesses and they kind of had those little fancy little head dress things on, I'm like, oh, okay, wait, I think we're all right. I think I'm on the right team here. I think I should be all right. So, but they had all these advertisings advertising's advertisements for Dubai for all this stupid hotels over there. And that's, it just, it reminded me of that commercial a long time ago where they had like, uh, uh, do you remember was just some shitty restaurants like olive garden or it was like a Domino's, you know, dominoes is fucking hilarious too with their whole ad campaign where they just admit that their product sucks, you know? Well, you know what, you guys, you know, you're right. I mean, we ate it tastes like shit.

Speaker 1:          00:13:25       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:13:26       We couldn't believe how bad it was either. We agree. We're joining it. We're joining it like, like during civil rights. She can't stop it. See, you join it and then you take control of it. I had some of that page site and Ah, I thought it tastes like shit. Ask not what your paycheck Joe for. Yep. Yep. Nope. Right. They just joined the fucking thing. They come to our side of the fence. We're yelling at Deb gold. Your pizza sucks. And then they just join our cry. Yeah. Yeah. It fucking sucks. And then we'll yelling at, nobody in the whole thing goes away and then they come back with their fucking pizza. It's the exact same God damn price. The lovely Nia said it the best. She goes, why don't you charge more than five 99 for a fucking large? Maybe you could put a little more into the product

Speaker 2:          00:14:19       and when you really think about it, that's should have been the ally when people said that pizza sucks, but okay. Hey, it's five 99 for a large. All right, you broke son of a bitch. I'm just trying to fill that hole in your belly. Okay? Yes. Sucks. But I have a couple of beers and starts to taste better, doesn't it? All right. Then who else is going to bring in this much fucking food for that little of a price at two o'clock in the fucking morning, Huh? Nobody. Nobody. We all know what you do. This is what you do, you or okay, you put in an order, right? For one large pizza. Okay. Providing, and then you pick another address out of the fucking phone book and your order. Fucking three of them, but it's close enough to the other house so they know that you're coming to your house first. You would have four largest for that fucking place and then you have one of your friends hide in the fucking bushes across the street. That Domino's guy pulls up. All right? He jumps out of the car and he's going to leave it unlocked. He brings your pizza up to the car while you're paying for that PC of friends go and they steal the other fucking pies. Then you run around the fucking house and he got four pies for five 99 okay. That's how it was done

Speaker 2:          00:15:33       anyways, we should just go out and just grab them and then just eat whatever the other people fucking ordered and then you know, a lot of times it was something he didn't want like a vegetable pizza, which is so fucking stupid. It's like you, they have vegetables. Eat something bad. Okay. Stop with the yard and you already have the guilt is you're eating this

Speaker 3:          00:15:48       all right,

Speaker 2:          00:15:50       it's cheese topping or Salami, Salami, Pepperoni, mushroom, something like that. Okay enough with the fucking peppers and all of that shit. You know how much heartburn and you're trying to get here. So then what we would do is we then eventually we'd start to order pizzas. You know, that we want it a little further down the street knowing that that come to our place first. Occasionally it didn't work out and then they just went to somebody's fucking house and they were like, we didn't order that shit. Oh, are you serious? Yeah, I'm serious. And then they come to our house and then we'd still steal it. And that's how you did it. That was how it was done. Um, but it wasn't Domino's. What, what was that? I'm trying to talk about Dubai here. That fucking commercial, I think it was all of garden

Speaker 2:          00:16:31       where they had these people sit down and they had cloth Napkins and they had all this fucking pomp and circumstance. Right. If that's how you say, um, just pump and circumstantial evidence. Right. And then they're eating this pasta and they go, oh my God, it's so decadent. Right. You know what I loved was they had a bunch of animals eating the shit. So of course they think it's great. The second you throw a cloth Napkin. Okay. It's somebody that goes to a tanning bed. I mean they automatically think that they're eating a five star fucking meal. You've already, you've already mind fucked him. It's like those psychological tests where they give them a pill that doesn't do anything, but you tell him it's going to make him feel better and then they convinced themselves that they feel better.

Speaker 3:          00:17:13       Right.

Speaker 2:          00:17:16       To me is like what Dubai is. Dubai is like, you know, if you took olive garden's Pasta, however they're trying to make it steady, you know all the bread you want. Like that's, that's Dubai. That's what it seems like to me. Having said that, I'll still fucking go there if I get a Gig, you know, so I'm just trying to sell the shit that I would say if it was more of a free fucking area, cause God knows how go there, you know Jesus Christ. I'm going to go over there just to see what I have to wrap Nia in. Oh, oh, I'm going to have a good time at one of those countries. I'm going to talk all kinds of shit. I'm going to make me a walk like five feet behind me.

Speaker 3:          00:17:58       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:17:58       Nia looked down at the floor when you walk behind me. Oh, that's great. They got it down over there. Huh? You just wrap them all up? Yeah. That's, you know what they are actually doing? They're actually admitting how much smarter women are that men, the fact that they have to have them on that level of control. You know, what were they doing before then? They must have just been running shit and they're just like, we can't fuck it. You know? Why don't you put your foot down? Okay,

Speaker 3:          00:18:29       fucker. Right. We'll wrap them up. We can't see what they look like then they can't use their but Japanese to, to, to mess with my, our minds.

Speaker 2:          00:18:41       I just don't understand why you would do that.

Speaker 3:          00:18:44       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:18:46       She's gotta be crazy. Like when you're fucking, I guess you're definitely gonna marry somebody that you love because you can't see what they look like. You know? Because guys will put up with a lot,

Speaker 3:          00:18:57       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:18:57       If the woman is beautiful the same way I'll, I'll lady, we'll put up, if you've got money and you're making money and you can provide, they're going to put up with way more shit than they should. You know? And it's true. As much as nobody wants to admit it, we all want to sit there and act like where that fucking Badass that has a line in the sand that you won't cross. But give me a fucking break. If she's a 10 that there's no line. Sure you got it down there and she's stepping over oil all over it. And what are you going to do? You're going to walk. You want to walk. You know you should walk when you get in your car and you drive away fucking bitch.

That'll make you fucking do it. Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:27:10       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:27:11       I don't know what I'm thinking.

Speaker 2:          00:27:14       I feel like you've got a hyper Joe to Rosa date here for best. It's taking a bunch of heat out there and let's see, it was Joe to Rosa going to be yet Joe to Rosa de Rosa due to do to, to, to, to, where is he? Where is he? Where is he? Ah, Christ. He'll come up here in a second. My fucking computer and just love on your computers. Just the shit for like three weeks after you buy it. Yeah. It's the fastest thing out there and then it just sucks after that. Such a fucking rip off. Anyways, what did I want to talk about this week? Um, American sports. Let's talk about that. I have no fucking idea who's doing what. I know the Bruins were playing really well right up to the all star break and then we, uh, I don't know if we can have an a it bit having a rough one, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:28:00       Um, I think we lost a van. It's the beginning of a big west coast, a trip here. And I got, I got to get back into a watching that type of stuff. Um, I do have to tell you, I fucking, sports are awesome over here. You know, we have at least three really exciting sports, football, hockey, basketball or fucking exciting goddamn sports. All right. They have basketball over in Australia but it's called Netball and women play it in. There's no back board. I can watch that little bit, but the rules are, I can't remember if they can't dribble or some shit. Like they get it then they just have to stop and I'll see any dunking or any of that type of stuff. But um, I'm looking forward to getting back into it. But um, I have no idea what's going on. One of my buddies up in Canada to gave me shit cause I guess we got swept by the Canadians, um, for this season.

Speaker 2:          00:28:59       It's so sad to listen to the Canadian fence gloat about that seasoned sweep is complete, you know? Yeah. There's just Stanley Cup. What do you guys done in the last 20 years? Lose the expos you think? I give up. Fuck that. We lost a Montreal again. We just won another championship. We won a super bowl. All right. In a real league. Montreal's not that poor shit CFL thing. Yeah, I've up there. All right. We're bubby Barista can go up there and it's fucking throw for 500 yards or meters, whatever the fuck you call them up there. Every God damn game me a fucking break. Did I already did I already break new city's balls. Do you realize that the fucking city of Boston with four teams has one, one more championship then the, then the fucking city of New York has professional teams. We would have enough rigs to give each fucking sad ass New York fucking team of fucking ring and still have one leftover for ourselves with just four tapes.

Speaker 2:          00:30:05       That's why I don't respect New York sports in their championships. It's like you doubled down in every fucking sport. Gee, did you win one? How many at bats do you need to baseball to football to basketball and if you include the island is they got to fucking hockey. It's fucking pathetic. Oh, I love Robin and into those constant, you'd probably go on like bill, why are you rubbing it in on the ads? Because they've been dicks to me my entire fucking sports life. Cause we now we never won anything and they and all of them fucking just run and hide. Anytime Boston wins something or they tried to, no, no, I'm happy for you guys. You have, I'm really happy for you guys. Go Fuck Yourself. Go Fuck Yourself. All right. I swear to God, it's what that city is, is it's the Yankees, the Yankees prop that entire fucking city up. If, if the, if, if it wasn't for the fucking Yankees, New York City would be exposed as being basically one of the saddest places to, to ever be as a sports fan.

Speaker 3:          00:31:08       You know,

Speaker 2:          00:31:10       wait, but the giants are good. What am I talking about? The giant ticket, but rather than that, all right. The jets. Horrific. 1969 the next, you know, you have to get, it's 1973 the rangers have one, one cup and like fucking 90 years. 80 years, right?

Speaker 2:          00:31:27       Well, yes. Nets have never won anything. The island is, they had their run, but at that point it's like 30 fucking years a Gulf that plant better though. Right? I don't know. Just a sad, sad fuck you got the Yankees. Thank God for the fucking Yankees have won like 99%. I guess he probably wouldn't 99% for everybody, but I dunno, I dunno. I'm quoting here a little bit. It's been a hell of a fucking decade, everybody. And if you think, I think that this is going to last. I know it isn't. I know that right now I am at the tail end of the greatest run Boston sports is going to have in my lifetime. I know. I don't know when it's going to Ed,

Speaker 3:          00:32:08       but, uh, I'll take it.

Speaker 2:          00:32:12       If it just becomes like, you know, like the Bruins don't seem like they have it this year. It seems like they're going to have to fucking shake it up. A Celtics. It goes without saying, um, the red sox, you never know what today's game, we kind of seem like we, uh, when it, then we shit the bed, then we win it. So we'll see what happens. Maybe we'll, uh, we'll come back around and try to stay. Uh, we'll try to keep up with the giants. We've won three, they've won three in this century.

Speaker 4:          00:32:40       Oh, we will be like one ahead. If we end up winning it this year, who the who the fuck knows and the Patriots, I don't know what happens with them, but at some point Bella checks going to have to retire and Brady's going to have to retire and then we're going to go back to be in the team that I watched when I was growing up. And uh,

Speaker 1:          00:32:58       yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:32:58       you watch how that stadium empties out,

Speaker 4:          00:33:06       it's going to go right. But you know, it'd be funny as if you actually had a camera, right? Like doing like this still photography and you had people who were there, um, basically before Bob Craft and he got them in this seats and then you just sort of fast forward through all the years. Robert Kraft, Bill Parcells, Pete Carroll, Bill Belicheck, he just see the stadium, fill it up, filling up, filling up, and then they gradually retire and then all the seats around start getting empty again. And then you just see that same person you saw before Robert Kraft bought the team and he's just fucking much older at, fuck, am I going to sneeze here? God dammit. I hope I didn't catch a fucking cold. Um, so anyways, um, somebody was telling me that they read a story that Pete Carroll said that, I don't know if it was like three nights in a row, whatever, but he was laying in bed crying that he lost the super bowl. And that's why I love Pete Carroll. I can't, I mean I hate that Wu and I hate the dockers, but that fucking guy is so fucking driven. He wants to win it. Do you realize like the pain that guy, that guy was going to do something that, I'm trying to think how many people did it. If he went back to back Superbowls, that guy joins fence, Lombardi Don Shula, Chuck Noll,

Speaker 4:          00:34:34       uh, Jim at Johnson and bill Bellacheck. That's it, right? It would become one of six people to ever do it. Any be in the same, the same fucking categories. Lombardi, Shula, chuck Noll, Jimmy Johnson and bill Bellacheck. Bill Bell check. By the way, I would actually say it's the greatest coach of all fucking time of all fucking time. How long he's one.

Speaker 1:          00:35:03       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:35:04       Doing it now on the salary cap era, the amount of fucking players switching and switching out, even when he doesn't win it, we still win like 12, 13 fucking games a year. Um, I think he's, I think he's the greatest of all time and I really hope that we keep pushing to get the fucking cult to make some sort of public apology for their absolute fucking, there's such fucking babies, man. I love Andrew Luck. This is nothing against the colts. The team. It's their fucking owner, man. That guy, such a goddamn baby. The amount of times that they've lost and then of course they can't just lose. It has to be like a fucking rule change. He's got to send a video to the, to the League office. It's like, dude, you lost

Speaker 2:          00:35:51       Aaron. It go fuck yourself.

Speaker 4:          00:35:55       What a fucking baby man. Anyways, so,

Speaker 2:          00:36:01       but you know, they throw it out there. It was great. They throw it out there. So forever. Bill Bellacheck, you know, by all the fucking people out there who just hate the guy, are forever going to quit. I love our Jerry Rice to Sarah and goes, yeah, you know, they should have an asterisk next to their, uh, their championship and then admits to using stick them.

Speaker 4:          00:36:17       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:36:18       Give me a fucking break. So now what Jerry? Now you're not, he's now, you're no longer the greatest receiver of all. Tag me a fucking break. You still are.

Speaker 4:          00:36:24       Grow Up. Um, so anyways, that was on the, uh, I was on the plane coming back from a Dubai and um, I blew, I blew basically all any, any gig money that I made going through Asia. I blew on plane tickets because I'm too fucking old to fly in the back of the plane. I just can't do it. Okay. I can't, I'm too fucking old. So I actually lost money. You went to Asia and probably lost a good month of my life breathing in some of that air over there. Uh, but I'm still going back cause I absolutely loved it and I fucking love the people over there. So a nia was giving me shit because she saw the money that I spent. She saw what I was going to gross and then what I spent on plane tickets. She's like, what the fuck are you doing? And I was just like, listen, I know you can't put a price on it. Okay, this is like a fucking vacation. Just look at it that way. And we're actually going to maybe make a little money on this thing. All right. But I am not going to fucking fly to Australia with my fucking pasty knees up to my chest. I'm not doing it.

Speaker 4:          00:37:33       All right? So enjoy it. So like the entire time we were, we just flew business class. All right. And uh, every time we'd go on and get a nice seat and I always just kept looking over it and he had just go and you can't put a price on it, you know, you can't put, just kept saying that and she just kept shaking her head and you get off the plane and then they give you a little pass. So when you went through customs, just letting you guys know this. So if you want to use your fucking miles, I'm telling you, look, if you're flying within the United States, I mean, you don't need to do that, I guess do you have to la as a motherfucker, but you can handle that. But when you start talking about a 14, 10, 14 hour fucking flight, take out your miles, take out your credit card. Just I'm telling you,

Speaker 4:          00:38:16       I'm telling you you won't regret it. So we'll fly it back air Emirates. And it was one of those double decker planes and we were upstairs in the business class. So like fucking ridiculously excited, totally exposing ourselves. Um, and so I got, went up to get to the, you know, we sit down and uh, you know, nice big ass fucking chairs and I look and I look over it and Nia and she laughs and goes, you can't put a price on it. I'm like, that's right. So, uh, I get up like about an hour into the flight and I go in the bath to go to the bathroom. When I go in the back and they have a, they have a bar in the back of the plane, like not giant bar but just like a little fucking, but a bartender sitting there with a bunch of fucking booze behind, you know, bottles and all that shit.

Speaker 4:          00:39:07       And then on either side of the plane, like the get these s shaped benches with like four seats with four seat belts and you can just sit down and put on a seatbelt. I can have a bar. So I like my fucking heart. I can't believe I didn't faint. My heart rate went through the fucking ceiling. So I go back and I go, Nia did come on the back of the plane. She's like, Wah, Wah. You know, she's watching some fucking TV thing. And I go like, come on, I want to get you a drink. She goes, what do you mean get me a drink? She thinks I'm just going to go back there. It's gonna be like three stewardesses, like huddled in the back. We go in the back and she saw it. She just starts laughing. We sat down, put seatbelts on an order, the fucking drinks, they're like olives and shit back there was ridiculous.

Speaker 4:          00:39:51       And they looked at it and she finally sent us. She goes, you can't put a price on it. There's all of the great fucker moments. And I sat with her drinking a goddamn drink flying over Iraq going, if I'm going to get hit by a fucking RPG, I'm going to be doing it like this. This is the way to do it. Right? So, uh, that is the one thing that I've learned to all of my fucking travel is that, uh, you have to have a line. And once you go and beyond, I mean, granted, I haven't gotten the bill yet. When I get that bill, oh, Jesus. When I get that bill, um, and I don't give a fuck, fuck that. I don't give a shit. All right. I need you to be comfortable. If I'm going into a goddamn country where I could get caned are hung, you know, you want to ride there in a comfy chair.

Speaker 4:          00:40:39       So, um, all right, well I'm already 40 minutes in here. I gotta a fucking move along here, but um, I can't even remember what I talked about last week as far as India. Um, I can't help. It was such a good time. Maybe I'll tell the story again if I've already told it. But after, after the Gig in India, um, I hung out with a bunch of comics all went out and got dinner and just sat down and talk comedy for uh, for like a good hour. And it was probably one of the highlights of my career just as far as just one of the coolest things ever. You are on the other side of the globe hanging out and you met people that do what you do then have the same passion and love for. And what was killing me was the questions with the exact same questions that I would hear from American comics are comics.

Speaker 4:          00:41:29       I meant in the UK or Ireland or Scandinavia. It's just, it's, it's the same art form. And, um, my favorite thing was in the end when it started getting petty where they would go in like, all right, Bill, who's a comic that you think just fucking stinks, but for some unexplained reason is selling a bunch of tickets. I just started laughing. I was just like, Jesus, even over here it's like that, you know. But, uh, I don't know if that's one of the really cool things about, uh, about traveling or whatever. So, um, I'm definitely going to go back, definitely going to go back. And what's funny is, um, Jerry Seinfeld actually has, is doing four shows over there.

Speaker 3:          00:42:16       MMM.

Speaker 4:          00:42:18       And, uh, I was just back in New York next month he's going to be over there and I was just in New York was doing the Patrice O'Neal benefit and uh, I just happened to run into Seinfeld. He comes down the cellar, you know, which is always fucking unreal when he shows up. And I mentioned to him that he was, you know, him going over there. So it was just kind of comparing trading notes with them or whatever. So I can't wait to hear how those shows go cause he was, you know, he's asking all the questions like, you know, can they understand like, yes, I was like, dude, they get everything. They get everything, all the slang and all that shit. But uh, anyways, I that,

Speaker 4:          00:42:56       I don't know, I wish I could actually go to those shows. That'd be pretty cool. Honestly, and Seinfeld and fucking Mumbai. Um, anyways, uh, sell the Patrice O'neal Benefit Ladies and gentlemen, uh, thank you to everybody that came out to the, uh, to the benefit this year I actually think was one of the best shows because, um, we only had eight comics this year in the past. The thing is, is so many people love Patrice and so when people want to be a part of it that we've been having like 12 to 13 comics and it really gets like jammed up towards the end and it's a union house. And if we go over like, you know, unions, they've, they're fine sit through the roof and we're defeating the purpose of why we're doing this thing. So it becomes really stressful. This year, there was only eight moved along quick. And um, you know, everybody crushed it.

Speaker 4:          00:43:47       And, uh, this year was great because I felt like by having Hannibal Burress and Michael Che on it, we actually had guys that were influenced by Patrice has comedy. Um, this is the first time we didn't just have like his peers, the guys who came up with that started the same time he did, or maybe a little bit before this is when we actually had the generation of comic set as they were deciding to become comedians, could actually have watched Patrice on TV and been influenced by him. And, uh, those two guys killed it. Uh, Jim Florentine, Ben Bailey, David Tell Jim Norton, Collin Quinn, uh, rich foss hosting it as always.

Speaker 3:          00:44:25       MMM.

Speaker 4:          00:44:27       It was just an awesome, awesome time. I know I always forget somebody and they're going to get pissed at me, but um,

Speaker 3:          00:44:34       yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:44:34       I dunno. Thanks again to everybody who, who, uh, came out to that thing. We're going to of course do it again next year. Thank you to the opium Chimi show for helped me promote it, but blah, blah, blah, blah, Blah and all that type of stuff. And um, I dunno. It's definitely a, it's, I don't know. It's been, it's fun. It's my favorite thing to do of the year because, uh, it is such a great cause we obviously love Patrice and getting to see his mom, his stepdaughter and his, uh, his girlfriend and uh, becomes like, uh, like the standup, like high school reunion and it's really fucking cool. So, all right, here we go. I got to wrap this up because guess what I'm doing the second this podcast is over, other than uploading it is a, I get to go see my dog. I'm see my dog and like three weeks and I know what you're thinking.

Speaker 4:          00:45:22       Like bill, wait, wait. Did you put your dog? Where did your board your dog? And it's like, no, I just kept her in the garage, you know, Shit and piss all over the place. But I had plenty of food for and uh, you know, I had a tie. Paul. Um, we actually bought at our, our veterinarian and my dog is one of the few dogs that absolutely loves the vet because she, you know, she's a pit bull. She's got herself heard a couple of times cause she's a maniac and um, you know, my dog's got this thing that he looks at you, she looks at you sideways. Like who the fuck are you? The second you take care of her, that's it. You, you're, you're, you're a made man. So they took care of her a couple of times. You know, she broke one of her teeth one time and a couple other things she's done to herself, Bang yourself up.

Speaker 4:          00:46:14       And um, you know, they took care of her down there and when she sees that someone's going to take care of, she's like, she's like a little fucking goddamn baby when she's down there. So whenever I take her to the vet, all these other dogs are like wine and going in there and I'm like water skiing behind my dog. She's like dragging me in there. And what kills me was whenever I drop her off to border, she's so excited to be there. She doesn't even turn around and look at me. She tails wagging and she just fucking runs away with somebody else. Kind of hurts my feelings a little bit. But um, anyways, let's get to the, uh, let's get to the, uh, the, the, the fucking, um, what am I saying here though? The letters for this week. All right. Sam Smith and Tom Petty. I actually kind of already answered this one. Uh, when is this one? All right. I've been a big fan of the podcast for years. I've got to say hello and correct. Congrats to you and lovely Nia when you played Dublin Ireland a while back. Oh, I got to say congrats to you. Okay. This is a trivial point, but I'd like to throw in my 2 cents on Tom Petty Suing Sam Smith. Tom Petty is almost famous for looking the other way when people happen to sound like him. He's been quoted as laughing it off when last night by the strokes appeared to rip off American girl saying

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       his early stuff. And then he just said that his early stuff sat and like Chuck Berry even gave the strokes credit for owning up to it. There's a similar story about the red hot chili peppers, Danny California sounding like last dance with Mary Jane. However, in this case with Sam Smith, Smith's response to the story was that he never heard, I won't back down if we believe that. Are we supposed to believe that every musician, producer, and other asshole heard that song before it was released, had never heard Tom Petty's. I won't back down. Uh, maybe. So for what? My dumb ass opinion's worth petty either sued because he didn't believe that denial or who was offended because Sam Smith didn't know him and not because the songs sounded alike, but what the hell do I know? That's actually interesting. Go back to Ireland sometime soon. Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. That's a really interesting take. I never even thought about that. If he just owned up to it, like you have to get pulled over by a cop and you just, you know, you know why I pulled you over. Yup. Yup. I made that illegal. Uturn why'd you make it? Because I was impatient and I didn't want to do it the right way. Do you know I could give you a ticket? Yeah, yeah, I do, but I'm not going to lie to you. That's an actual conversation I had with a cop.

Speaker 1:          00:48:41       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:48:41       And he goes, all right, I'm going to let you go. And then I laughed and said, you're awesome. And then he laughed like,

Speaker 1:          00:48:47       yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:48:48       Not laughing like, yeah, this is great. He was laughing just like, it was just a weird conversation for him, I think.

Speaker 1:          00:48:54       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:48:55       I always tell the truth whenever they pull you over, you know, I pulled you over. Yeah, absolutely. Stealing, doing like fucking, you know, fast. You're going, yeah, like 85 soap and I wasn't going to run into you. Most of the Times. They still give you the ticket, but sometimes if you just fucking honest, Ya know, it's towards the end of their shift electorally. Fucking let you go. Um, yeah, of course. Being old fucking freckled faced howdy duty looking white guy probably doesn't hurt me either. I'm already hearing envy. Anybody not white listening to this going? Oh yeah, yeah. Now if I go take the shit out of it, I know. I know. What do you want me to do? You know, one of my, I mean, I, I don't make the rules. I'm happy it works out that way for me. Um, I'm sorry it doesn't for you, uh, moving across the country. Uh, dear bill, birth bill, I'd think you podcast. Thank you. Okay. Okay. I just, I, I just turned 23 years old a few months ago and I realized I have lived in the, in the West Michigan town. I've officially lived in the western Michigan town. I live in for more than half my life. Can you guys please?

Speaker 1:          00:50:03       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:50:04       please try to proof read your shit. This is a sentence. Okay. So I turned 23 a few months ago and I realize I have lived in the West Michigan town. I've officially lived in the western Michigan town. I live in for more than half of my life. All right. So it was definitely editing as he wrote this and just kind of fucked that up. This crushed me.

Speaker 1:          00:50:24       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:50:24       Why cause you're living in western Michigan. I like it out there.

Speaker 4:          00:50:29       Well, you got to move to the big city. Uh, this crushed me. So I began saving up as I wanted to live in Portland, Oregon. Good choice. I've always been musical and I want to go do the band thing, but I've never, but I have an associate's of science degree, so if that doesn't work out, I can go back to school. But in Portland after establishing reds, but I'll, I'll, I'll go back to school in Portland after establishing residency. All right, so you've got a plan here. My question to you is this, how much do you think I should save up with the plan to live minimally and just work a job slash play music? I've never felt I could express myself here as I am isolated and since the town is small, high school follows you everywhere in which I was a total weirdo.

Speaker 4:          00:51:15       Slash. Loser. Uh, thanks and go. Love Yourself. Um, all right. I totally relate. I totally relate. Like, you know, I was a loser too in high school. So there was an element of like going to Boston to try stand up comedy. And I remember whenever I would get a gig anywhere near where I was from, that'd be so nervous that my entire high school class would show up and they wouldn't laugh and be like, dude, you're that jackass. And went to school with who are you to think that you could make this dream come true? Go Fuck Yourself. Right. So I totally understand all of that. And I also worked a day job and I saved up money before I moved to New York. I paid off all of my debts. I just paid it down. I paid down everything and I saved up. I saved up some money and then I moved to New York. And uh, I went there thinking I got to get a day job and a, but I had enough money where that wasn't, you know, wasn't dire. Like I gotta get a job right now. I could actually go a few months. So I started getting some standup gigs. So, even though it was negative cash flow, it wasn't 100% negative. Like say my nut, I think my rent, I swear to God, I had to walk two bedroom. My rent was uh, it was for 25 a month. This is 20 years ago. And, um,

Speaker 4:          00:52:44       but I mean I had no spots. I had no gigs. So I think I did a couple of road gigs when probably back to Boston, maybe did addict already gig or something. And I probably made Jesus, I don't even know. I probably made like 300 bucks, three 75 for the weekend. But I also had to travel up there and I took the bus and I had to eat. So it was probably in pay taxes on it eventually. So I mean, I was probably walking away with 125 bucks. So I probably had, you know, and plus all the other eating, living, every time you walked outside in New York, it's like you blew 20 bucks. So, um, I watched my nest egg start to dwindle, but after a couple months I stopped thinking about a day job. I just started thinking, um, I got to get more gigs and I got to get more gigs. And then what happened was I was able to kind of slowly stopped the nosedive, a cash to level it off a little bit. And um, then I booked some acting gig or something way I was able to make enough money and I just stashed it. And at that point then I got to college age and it just all starts to happen. You know what? I'm a guy brought up on this, um,

Speaker 4:          00:53:58       podcasts before Mike Johnston, Mike lessons.com. I'll try to find the video for you, but he's got this great video that he does where he talks about, you know, or maybe I was, when I went and I saw him live, I think it was when I saw him live. So I'll paraphrase what he said, but when he wanted to make money as a musician, you know, he just,

Speaker 4:          00:54:25       he just totally like his day, even his day job, he just stayed in the music arena. I'm really going to butcher this story, but he started giving drum lessons. All right. So that was money he was earning as a drummer. He started working at a music studio, tuning up the drums and that type of thing. So that was two way. And then then he got into, you know, a couple of bands and he had a couple of gigs on the weekends. So that was three, four different ways that he was making money as a drummer. And he just keep doing that. So when you're out there, I would just make, make it all about music. You know, if you get a job at fucking guitar center or something like that, you can get a discount on some of your, your equipment and then you can also get to know guys and you can start talking to people.

Speaker 4:          00:55:08       Like I want to get into a band, join a couple of fucking bands. I mean that's, I would do all of that shit. And then also you can get a discount on all the recording stuff that you need. If you're going to start writing songs. I would just keep getting jobs in the music industry because it seems to me like that's what you want to do. And then your backup is to do this associates of the sciences degree. Like that's your backup plan. Um, just by reading your, your letter, it seems like, you know, you want to be in the music business that's going to make you happy. So that's what I would do. And uh, he just kind of have to try to shake off that whole idea that, you know, you have to fall back on this college degree and this whole idea that you can't have a fun job. You could totally have a fun job and it's going to be a job and it's going to be working all that shit, but you could totally have a fun job. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:56:02       you just keep applying for jobs that have fun and you will have a fun job and just stay there and then that's it. And then, you know, you know how to do it though. Do you eat your ramen noodles? If you wake up in the morning, you just have a fucking apple that'll fill you up and you'll be in great shape. You just pound some waters. Um, you know, you know the deal. Everybody fucking does this shit. I use each spaghetti. That was my thing. Spaghetti and, and a couple pieces of bread. And that was my dinner that would fill me up. And uh, I remember I didn't have any of, have a table. I had a fucking chair that I turn around and I use that as the table and I just would fucking get the prego and I'd throw fucking spaghetti in there. I could make the fucking meal in my sleep.

Speaker 4:          00:56:51       And you have to measure the water or anything. I just knew where to pour it in the pot. I've just had it every fucking night and I was so fucking sick of it. I remember like every once in a while I would either take a taxi cab. I just be so tired after doing gigs and just fucking, every once in a while I treat myself to a cab ride. All right. Treat myself. I'd actually order out. And when I say order Ron, I'm talking like ordering Chinese food. Um, cause you know, when you first moved to a city, you know, I'm from a small, tiny moved to a big city, you're on your own and it's really on you. Uh, you're terrified to spend money. This is creeping thing, you know, you got to get your footing once, you know, you've survived for seven, eight months.

Speaker 4:          00:57:33       One day it just kinda hits you like, Hey, I'm on my own here and I'm, I'm making it. It's a great failing, you know, even though you've got fucking spaghetti coming out of your goddamn ears. Um, so good luck to you, sir. All right, so a workout, a William B, do you still work out? If yes, what is your routine? Do you do any running or biking? Love the podcast man. Uh, I actually did quite a bit of working out when I was on the road because I was, you know, eating airplane food, airport food and that type of stuff and Gig food. Uh, and I only think I put on like five pounds, which is pretty good, you know, for the amount of time that was away for three weeks to only put on five pounds. And really what fucked me over was when I went to New York.

Speaker 4:          00:58:15       I was there for a few days and uh, oh, the booze was flowing anyways. Um, do I do any running nine oh two running, running kills my fuck. You know, you can't do that to myself at my age. You can't keep running like that. It fucking, you need your feet, your knees, your hips, you need all of that shit for the rest of your life. What you really have to do at my age is actually finally sit down and learn about nutrition. So you're not eating your way into the gym. You're actually eating your way out of it so you don't have to do as much. I do a lot. Like I take my dog. Um, there's a lot of hiking trails out here in la, the fucking greatest city ever. I love it, man. I'd have to be in a freeze and fucking New York. I love New York and that shit. But, uh, Jesus Christ, when it's that fucking cold and there's no Christmas lights out, it's pretty goddamn bleak. Um, but anyways, yeah, I kind of do that. And then I'm into, uh, your own body weight. I have a climbing rope, I got a peg board, I got a, I got one of those pull up dip stations. I'm into that type of stuff cause I feel like it's a much better

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       strength.

Speaker 3:          00:59:23       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:59:24       Being able to move your own body and it's much more practical when you're in situations to be able to move your body,

Speaker 4:          00:59:31       um, climb up on to something, lower yourself down onto something. Just getting it up and out of bed is easier if you're used to being able to handle your own body weight as opposed to that weird shit with like bench pressing, which is you're pushing all this weight up off of you while adding this mop muscle weight to yourself, which is, I dunno, it just seems more of a complete workout when you move in your own body. So I'm into that stuff. And, uh, I'll skip rope I guess every once in a while, but I make sure that I do, like, I don't jump up too high. So it's more like I'm kind of not even like running in place so much, just sort of lifting a foot up and setting it back down. Uh, once you get the muscle memory down, you can really minimally be slamming your joints. Is she coming back down? Uh, it's sorta like lightly running in place as you do it. And I'll just do like two, three rounds. I, you know, it's funny, as I brought it, I brought a jump rope on the trip and I never used it once. I just never fucking used it. But I did do like a lot of that elliptical shit. And, um,

Speaker 3:          01:00:34       I dunno.

Speaker 4:          01:00:35       So what I, what's my routine? All right. So my routine, I do

Speaker 4:          01:00:39       a set of pull ups and I do it to exhaustion as many as I can do. And even after I can't put my head over the Chin a get my chin over the, over the bar, I still am doing Reps. Uh, even if you only go halfway up a third of the way up an eighth of the way up and just to exhaustion, that's the first set I do. Then, uh, I climb up the rope, go back down, and then I go over to the peg board. And it's weird because my garage ceiling isn't high enough. I had to buy the skinniest ones and to have them go horizontal. So I'm actually, I only do the peg board but I go to the side and at this point I'm only at the point where, you know, I can take the pegs out like two or three times total.

Speaker 3:          01:01:26       MMM.

Speaker 4:          01:01:29       You know, and actually make it happen. If you do get a peg board, you want to aim a little bit higher than the whole because your, your body is going to be going down. So you actually stick it in there. And then the next time I go through is I do a set of pull ups where I do the negatives. Will you pull yourself up over the bar and then you lower yourself super slow and that actually helps you reps over time. And then the next, and then I do the, I got this tree that I jump up and I, there's a branch that goes way out where I kind of do a, how the fuck do you describe it? Right hand over, left hand, right hand over, left hand, walking out towards the end of the branch. And then I come all the way back again. Um, and I tried to keep my arms at like a 90 degree angle, not just hanging straight down like that. Um,

Speaker 3:          01:02:15       okay.

Speaker 4:          01:02:16       And then the third set I do is a wide grip and then it's the same again. And I go back up the rope instead of the tree that time, something like that. And then I'm always switching it up. Um, sometimes I just do three straight things, a regular pull ups or whatever. This sounds boring as shit, so I'm gonna move on. But that's basically what I do. And then I take my dog for a fucking hike. That's it. And then I try not to eat like a fucking animal. They go and that is my workout. Let me actually do the last bit of advertising here. Fucking that. Richard Simmons, the hell am I doing here? I'm sitting in candy striped shorts right now. People doing this podcast. All right,

Speaker 2:          01:05:46       All right. Out of the closet. Here we go. Dear bill, I'm a 17 year old high school student who recently came out of the closet. Congratulations. That's it. Very courageous thing. It's 17. Um, I have always been fairly timid and don't have a very aggressive character. Once again, even more courageous. Three years ago I found your comedy and I was inspired by your race, your religion of logic and passion. Listening to your comedy and hour on the podcast gave me exposure to a strong personality that I could relate to internally and be inspired by outwardly. If this is going to be all compliments, I can't read these. All right, some point you got to shit on me. Uh, without exaggeration, exaggeration and moved my type table up at least a year for forever. I plan on waiting til I was 18. Thank you for the inspiration. Good, sir. Uh, this is where you call yourself an idiot and downplay the situation. Ah, your son of a bitch. You with two sentences short. I lifted that moved from you two. When my aunt said I was very brave. I just brushed it off like you will with this email. Go Fuck Yourself. Jesus Christ. He's fucking guy's killing it here. Uh, should I be worried?

Speaker 2:          01:07:02       Oh, it's totally different. This is a different thing. I actually just assumed that this was a guy too. It could have been a lady. All right. Should I be worried? Well, congratulations sir. Or ma'am. Um, where am I? Uh, should I be worried? Hey Bill. Burrington the first, please read this on the video. So I'm an English guy studying psychology in France and I've been dating an Italian girl for the last five months. Do what? Do you fucking James Bond.

Speaker 1:          01:07:33       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:07:34       I'm insanely in love. It's international cunt. What is the problem? Should I be worried? You should be worried. You're an English guy living in France, studying psychology date and some Italian woman.

Speaker 2:          01:07:47       That's fucking awesome. I want you to life. Uh, he goes, I'm insanely in love with her and I think she may be the one, or at least the mother of my hypothetical children. Hilarious. We both have a long history of relationship. I've been with a lot of girls and she's been with a lot of guys. Nice. You both experienced when he came out of it unscathed? No STDs. That's, that's great for both of you. You know what that's like when you've bagged a lot of women and she's banged a lot of guys and you get there unscathed. You know what that's like? That's like one of those great fucking Superbowl matchups you know, that's a pickup. It's like the cowboys steel is 79. Uh, I'm insanely in love with Tara Bubba Bubba way. Okay. The other day I bought, I brought up an ex and this obviously pissed her off.

Speaker 2:          01:08:30       Yeah. What the fuck you don't do that? Because she then said she was speaking with an x on Facebook and he said he wanted to marry her. I know she's still friends with some of her exes, those so am I. But I still, you guys both need to fucking grow up. All right. Either get out of this relationship, friends with your exes. But I still think her getting messages from these guys who clearly still want to fuck her is messed up obviously. And why you still talking to your ladies? Uh, you're keeping them in your little fucking Dick Orbit, aren't ya? Uh, we're moving in together at the end of the year and usually you would say dump the bitch. No, I'm not. I'm saying you both need to grow up, but she says she loves me and I can't lose this one. She's fucking beautiful, smart, funny and sweet. So should I be worried about these fuckers and therefore bring it up or should I just shrug it off? Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. Well, I think you need to do what you need to commit to this woman. You have to tell us. Say, listen, I'm not talking to any of my, any more of my exes and it, and I would appreciate it if you would do the same. I think we got a great thing going here and um,

Speaker 3:          01:09:41       you know,

Speaker 2:          01:09:43       I don't, I don't feel it's right then I'm still in contact with women that I used to be intimate with. It doesn't feel right to me anymore the way I feel about you. And I'm hoping that you feel the same way about you keeping in contact with your excess. I'm not trying to have a fight here. I just want to have a rational conversation. Just start that way and then you know what? You commit to her dude. It's over. Okay. All those other fucking guys at Bangor and all that type of stuff. Did they give her a ring? No. You know, so you sound like you're an older guy as far as like, you've been down the fucking, you know.

Speaker 3:          01:10:18       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:10:18       You know, you've been hacking your way through the jungle for a while. Who the fuck's kitten home? All right, what are you going to do here? You know you're going to lose this one. I don't think you're Gunna so commit to her and then just show you come in by. But you know, once you lead by example, maybe that'll work. I don't fucking know. But uh, that whole bullshit where you both stay in, uh, well you're both fucking um,

Speaker 3:          01:10:43       okay.

Speaker 2:          01:10:43       You know, staying in contact with the x's is bullshit. Uh, come on. Who's getting home? And you know, if you're a little drunk and then he'd get on the fucking Facebook, their shit is said Bob bub knowledge. So you know what you need to do. You're both too. All right, good luck to you. All right, that's the podcast for this week. You'll fuck yourselves if you'd like to donate to this podcast. Anytime you go on to Amazon, you're going to go buy yourself a little hairnet. You know, maybe an apron a, if you go to, uh, my wet website, [inaudible] dot com and you go into the podcast page as an Amazon link. If you click that, it'll take you right to Amazon, then buy whatever the fuck you want and it doesn't cost you any extra money.

Joe To Rosa will be at the punchline in San Francisco this weekend. Oh, twinkle toes himself. So if you're in the San Francisco area, it goes, see fucking Joe to Rosa. All right, there you go.
