Everybody's in the bushes so they could say whatever the fuck they want. Every just, I don't read Twitter. That's hilarious. I don't think they're really genuinely mad. I think they just want to like, you know, they want to get their little, like I said this today, are they not doing that? They like that

Speaker 1:          00:01:57       general then not big on heckling during the show, but afterwards, if you're standing out there, whoring yourself out, that's when they, they'll come by and the

Speaker 2:          00:02:05       be like, oh, you're not as tall as I thought you were going to be like that. And I always, I always, yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:02:11       just give him, should I go? You know, you had 90 minutes to say that when I'm [inaudible] pussy, it's always good when there's a woman standing there too and then they go home. They probably take it out on her hate fucker or something.

Speaker 2:          00:02:20       I like to feel that I had, I had something to do with that, but that's not why we're here today.

And I'm excited because I've never been to Sacramento. I've never been anywhere.

Speaker 2:          00:03:46       Oh Jesus. What are we doing here? I've never been anywhere in California other than Long Beach in La. So I'm looking forward to San Diego tomorrow. See this is one for me because you're, you're in California. I've been out to see you in New York at least a handful of times since we've been friends. But you've never been to California, you know in all verse. He does his shit on California as he got hammered when we were in this cigar bar in Calgary and I was shitting on the Yankees are shitting on golf. I think he was shitting on golf, golf. And then I, cause I was saying about playing it or the, or follow me like where I keep, where I put it as far as sports competition. Gotcha. And I put it in with bowling pool shuffleboard where, where it's one of those things. So he gets mad at me and he starts going, he starts going like, you know what bill?

Speaker 2:          00:04:30       He goes, I wish. He goes, he goes, Brito suck. Comes me with the cuisine. He goes, all it is is beans and rice. And I go, Yeah Paul, it's all it is. No one ever thought to put anything else in there. I got by. But you know, you even said I got drunk. He said it hit me like a, like a smoke bomb. Like I that time you've started slumping, but at the time he got hammered and you were just like, you were a mess. Like let me get my calendar. But can you take, do you think that's bad though? I saw you shaking your head that that's where I put I put golf. I'm not, not anywhere near bowling or shuffleboard. The no, no, no. I'm not saying that because there's all different degrees of, of, of difficulty. But I'm just saying as far as you're playing a sport where it's all between your ears, between your ears.

Speaker 2:          00:05:12       There's nobody physically trying to stop you. In other nations it's fall times. I'll give me five. I'm just saying when Wa, I mean there's a lot of forest, well no, I think places and shucking, but playing against of what leaves us in the way. I'm not saying that it's still wouldn't hold that. Oh, a guy hits a home run. Like know what I know. But when face ball players talk about how difficult it is, they talk about trying to hit a curve ball. They don't talk about the wind. I'll forget my hitting the golf ball is in your, I forget mother nature. There may in cancer they no walking. No, but there's more than that. It's not even that. It's how about the fact that you actually do have to have a proper swing posture, your hips,

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       your legs, you're not listen to me in tech to your body. Listen to me. I'm not saying it's not difficult. You Golfing zombies. What I'm saying is, is it's not fucking playing football, basketball, hockey with is somebody trying to stop you. There's not a pitcher throwing the fucking golf ball a hundred miles an hour at your chin to Bacchae off the, uh, the t and then you've got to come up there and settle back into your fucking swing. Okay? That's all I'm saying. I know it's mentally difficult, but it's in the same family is pool, bowling, shuffleboard, horseshoes, all the way down to some of the most simplistic sports. There are tiddly winks. Nobody's stopping you na, I mean already stopping in Jacks. You don't need to be in shape to do shuffleboard. You don't need to be in shape to bowl. That's a such a terrible point to bring up with.

Speaker 1:          00:06:46       Cause I'll, I'll tell him, I'll fucking show you Duke. First Time I watched the masters, Kenny Perry, he looked like somebody's grandfather fucking came out. He blew it. He blew it. And then some other fat Argentina guy won it. They'll go fat. Oh Cabrera fat guys still, Ugh. I give up. Give up, can see the fat guys can play golf. I get to the sweat bill. Nicholas's man, tits is so unacceptable. He should always have. Why? They should have married her own bag. Yeah, but they're not piles of shit. Kenny Perry is not a pile of shit. Dude. What is he? Donna's? What? Is he close to? Death playoff. He is. No, no, no. But what is he closer to? Is he closer to an a donnas or a tub of shit? Oh No. Yeah, he's, he's definitely closer to a Tbi Shit. Then another tub of Shit beat him to fucking dude.

Speaker 1:          00:07:36       Even that cow. But the general Lee car, he doesn't look like he did a fucking pull up in his life. He had those seventh grade straight arms where you don't have, you just have basically the humorous bone with a little bit of meat hanging on and you can still pick up a pencil or a phone. Gene iron the the guy, the guy who hit that amazing shot and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, chef on the one. Right, right. I love that. We're cores light drinking. Come on. He's like the guy that's, he's a Digi jetskis. He's totally the Kenny powers of May, but I'm not disrespecting the sport. I'm not disrespecting the sport, but I'm just saying the reason why I find the sport boring as hell to play is the fact that there's nobody guarding me and I just get, I get bored shitless by three, four fucking holes.

Speaker 1:          00:08:20       I don't care. The whole thing is silly. I'm trying to put this little ball in a hole and the hole is on garden. There's nobody trying to swat it away as it goaltending. It's this fucking hole in the ground that you should have a good way to look at it. He designed differently. It's just a different game. Listen, there's a reason why it should have been a Getty shack too. There's a business, there's a reason why a bunch of fucking old people when they start putting on weight, you know, and they need to get active. They always pick up that sport and I'm telling you, those fat fucks who if you throw a baseball, the the odds of them chipping that tooth can somehow still get on a golf course. And I'm not saying crush it like a pro, but they can hit the fucking thing straight enough. They're, they're all right. They're okay. They're okay. They're good fun to play with. They can shoot a one oh five I love our colon millionaire golfers tubs. Yeah, they're not fun. Not Daily. Used to be fucking pounding beers. John Daly was an animal. I heard his book like he was an animal.

Speaker 3:          00:09:16       I used to fit. We used to go to the a Firestone every year. Some buddies of mine down at the NAC and Akron and we used to follow, this is back in their like late nineties mid to late nineties when daily was on top of the world. He was in every tournament because he was, you know, he was still exempt from all of his wins. I love that guy too. He was the best. We would follow him around and he bombed the ball past everybody. This is before tiger made a name for himself on the tour and he was a smoking Cha Cha Jim Jane Smoke. You know they don't show it on TV, but a lot of these guys chain smoke, it's like they hit the driver, they liked the cigarette and he literally changed when the camera goes away from him and the camera goes away from him. He there, they don't put the camera on him.

Speaker 3:          00:09:53       And then a lot of times when you do, they'll go back and be like, we'll go to daily at 16 he's got a cigarette burning in the fairway. You just don't see it. He takes his hit and they say, and then they show the ball. You know, he saw it hit the green and they show him like give his cloak. And then once they show like the trees and the leaderboard, he's back smoking again. He carries a, he actually smoked so much. He's got an old coffee can with a hook on the side of his bag when his, when his as an extra. Yeah. So cause they don't want them litter and up those nice courses, that's not cool. So he is like, you literally you would follow him and his caddy had put the bag down and he'd be waiting to hit is approaching and he'd be smoking cigarettes as long as they go and he throws it in the coffee can or if he still had a cigarette when it's time to hit, he throw it on the grass and just let it burn. Wait till pick it up. It's hilarious.

Speaker 1:          00:10:41       Well listen, I know it's difficult because I've actually talked to a professional athlete hall of Famer who said those guys mentally, the strongest athletes, cause you've got all that time to stand with a ball. Think and I understand that. But there's just something about the fact that there's nobody trying to stop you but me. It's just the, the activity of it. I feel like I might as well just sit in a restaurant with a chopstick trying to catch a fly. It's just like, why am I doing this? This is dumb. I'm not working up a sweat. Like I just, I would rather play fucking horse shoes and they just walked back over to the grill and just grab a sandwich. Like I decided to stay on what I'm doing. Part of it might be because I'm so pasty and I'm out there. Do you know how bad I want to go out on the course that you guys get you smoking cigars and drinking? Like I'll meet you at the fucking at the club? Yeah. The drinking and the smoking on the course is so fun. Oh, there's no, I know, but this is the thing. Maybe that's time. That's how you have to sell the sport because it's not like, yeah, you want to go play hockey and it just be like, Hey, you smoking stogies ah, maybe I'll come down and have a, and it's fun.

Speaker 3:          00:11:43       We should have an annual, like we'll call it the cube it open. We'll just get like a gag for eight guys, get a couple of forums. We meet at a golf course every year and we just absolutely, we just play like two rounds of golf over two days and just smoke Cubans

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       and drink scotch. I got to tell you this, if, if I, if I ever became a center and going again, if I ever, if I ever became president, one of the first things I would do was, and I would risk my own assassination by doing this because I would go against all the corporate cons and I would basically, I would break bread with Castro and those guys and I would just be like, all right, listen, we will wrong to try and turn your island into a bunch of Starbucks and casinos and the end of the day it is your property. Do what with it what you want. We'll bring you some cars down here. Just start sending us to cigars exam and would just leave it at that. But that's not what they're actually waiting for him to die. And then they're going to turn that place into a, it's going to look like Orange County.

Speaker 1:          00:12:35       It's going to be fucking brutal. It's terrible. He, you know, I'm not saying the guy's the greatest leader. I'm not saying I'm going to be underneath the guy, but in principle they will. Right. It was their country. They had the right to do. Okay, we're going to take college here. All of a sudden come see him like a fucking place getting back to the cigar. I'm so fucking sick of having to try and find, it's kind of the excitement of smoking a Cuban is trying to find one. Yeah. You know, and uh, now you know what everyone was saying, you know? No, you've said up on the fake. Yeah. Where you go. They are, they're already on Twitter doing it properly. They, they do that shit. But, um, what even know, like, you know, if you order them and they send them in, you know, they get a little bit, a little hard. What was, I'm just getting tired of people talking about like how it could get you sick and how it could give you, you know, get, you know, give you a throat cancer and shit. It's like, listen man, you know, I'm not smoking these like cigarettes, like a package. If I'm going to smoke one or two cigars a week, that's it. That's it. I seen you smoke four and two nights

Speaker 4:          00:13:31       and I don't even live in New York. I mean, it just happened. I just happened to be there. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:13:35       yeah. Well, you know. No, I was like, fuck. It was, it was, it was a, yeah, it was of Thursday. It was, wasn't that was her back pedal at night. There was a couple of days I went a little bit does break down to 14

Speaker 4:          00:13:45       anyway, dude, I love it.

Speaker 1:          00:13:50       I fucking love them. So do what now I gotta ask you guys now when you go to go out on this tour, being the Scotch drinking cigar smokers that you are, uh, what, what is the, what is the over under, on weight gained on, uh, on this, the all the, uh, the Olin tour here? Well, my, well, my plan coming in and I told, I told my wife, does my plan coming in was to, to not try to hang with Bart. Nick

Speaker 4:          00:14:14       like, no, no, no. I'm not even kidding. Like Bart, nick is not like we're the bargaining to be a day behind the tour when we're in Portland. He's going to be the, in Seattle when we're in Sacramento, he's going to have to be in San Francis.

Speaker 2:          00:14:26       Never seen, I'm not even kidding. I'm not even joking around. I'm not just saying this, you know, I've never seen a grown man in door what he can do and still be able to hold this role back to throw it, like to hold it together. I mean that dude, like he was going back to the bar. He's going, yeah, man. How about another heater and member. I had to tell him, I go, hey dude, listen, I'm not hiding. I was at my wedding, right? Yeah. At Bill's wedding he goes, hey dude, you guys would be a lot at versus you want another heater and I literally, you did it. Yeah, I got, I go guys, I'm not going to lie to, I can't do it like I need. I need a break here. The bartenders at the wedding, we're pulling, we're pulling bartenders over from other bars to watch.

Speaker 2:          00:14:59       They were like, watch, watch, watch, watch what he does. The Guy Walking up now watch what he does and like think about your wedding, which was awesome. Was there, it was never like, it was never hard to get either a be a hard liquor. It was just always right there and the guy knew what you wanted so Barney could go, yeah, you guys want more heaters. Another round of hears and he would just start giving them Barton. It's just drinking his crown and I just patted him on the back and I was like, you are at, and he just had that shitty and green, but he was talking straight on, but all the way into the bar, he said for people who don't know him, he's a, he's a mountain of a man. Like he could give, he's like Cam Neely size man. He said, well he's a, yeah, we're all like, what?

Speaker 2:          00:15:35       Like five, 10 or whatever. Trying to keep up with a dude who's like six, four. Yeah, I mean me and you by the end of the night we were shot and he was just like, hey guys, you want one of these for the road? He was like helping us. He was like, Jason, when it comes back against, uh, you know, a fast Eddie in the fuck, you know what? I used to sit in there and putting the carnation back in his jacket. Let's play some cool pop in. Yeah. Well, that's how they, that's funny is because like I think over those heaters that all that drinking as well, how we came kind of came up with this idea for the door that that was at bill's wedding in October. We'll see. We just started joking about it. Bill's not going to beat a voice of reason on this one.

Speaker 2:          00:16:07       He's kind of letting us go. Bill's not going to be around. Hey guys, let's, that's a good sign. You're in trouble when I'm the voice of reason. No, but you would at times. How much do you have to talk me into something now? That's the thing. No, you know what bill does? This is what he does. He acts like he's the guy who like to like to keep it cool. He'd be like, yeah, really? I should go. Well, this was so funny. We were in Canada. He goes, listen man, I'm not, I'm not trying to get tonight. I'm not tryna get tonight. I swear to God. I'm backstage and he's on stage. He's onstage and I'm thinking, I'm going back to the old ties again. No, not tonight. Not Tonight. He's onstage asking the crap. You guys know where we could, let's just say we did.

Speaker 2:          00:16:39       Let's just say we were to go out and then after after I get, you know, take close out the show, he'll be like, yeah, we'll get one, we'll get one. So like he acts like he's not going to, but see Barton has just like, I mean every tweet, crowns, crown like Barton examine like what he saw when he's all in. Dude, that was hilarious. We were in buffalo one time. He pulled the same thing in buffalo. It was after a Bruins playoff when we were in, but we were in buffalo doing buffalo wild in June. Right. And then we were like talking to the whole time, the place like I couldn't really drink tonight. [inaudible] we get back to the hotel. He's like, you didn't have Bruins game still on it. Let's just go down to that little like bar like yeah, we watch it Bruins William, we celebrate e right there to the part that we have one, we'll have one beer, right.

Speaker 2:          00:17:21       Wait one very of it ruins way and we're going to celebrate the book part. Then as the bill goes, hey, if we weren't going to go out next door, next thing you know we're next door getting hammered talking to these locals eaten Bacon. Remember that Bacon, they put bacon out as a bar snack. Remoteness. That's right. So we had the west man, I know it's buffalo, but you're already north of Pittsburgh. And then there's like peanuts, peanuts and pretzels. They can, she bring hot bacon out in baskets for the bars neck. And I'm like, look. And I go, Bacon's not cheap man. I, I know, like I asked the part, I'm like, wait a minute, this is crazy. She's like, Hey, it's Friday and Saturday nights only, but it gets people drink, they, they make the bake and I asked the guy, he came out, they make the Bacon, they let it cool for like 25 minutes so you don't burn yourself on it. So it's warm but not hot and it just comes in. He just, he was like, I'm not gonna eat this. And then it's like literally like crack. You have a couple of handfuls and then you get all that. It's all salty and then you want to start pounding. Yeah, they was setting this up. I gotta I gotta do some ads here.

Uh, once again, the all things, comedy tours coming to San Diego Tuesday, April 1st, uh, it's going to be in Bellevue, Washington Sunday, April six at parlor live, a helium comedy club, Portland, Oregon and then two nights at Saint and uh, at the punchline in San Francisco, the eighth and ninth in Sacramento on the 10th. Um, yeah. Then we're going to swing it over to the east coast and a couple months more dates to follow. I think they're working on that, but I'm looking forward to doing that. Those dates are coming. [inaudible] Boston bought, we're [inaudible] all these guys, all these guys opened for me. If you've come out and seen any of my shows basically in the last shit, I don't know, five, six years. It's been one of these guys open it for me. So I'm excited for you guys. I was actually trying to think who I met first. I think I met you. Law Ahead. We've known each other for a long time. It's coming up on 10 years. No

Speaker 2:          00:23:31       over 10 years. You know what's funny is I didn't want to get, I didn't want to get like sentimental about it because my first whiskey, but no, like we did that show. We did that show on New Year's Eve. We did that show on new years eve at the Wiltern and that was literally 10 years to the day we met. We like hung out on New Year's Day, New Year's Day tenure, like New Year's Eve. You did Cleveland and then hung out. We got and then that's when we, that's when we became friends. It's like you just came and hung out with me on New Year's Day because you had nothing to do. We were dark, but you had to stay in Cleveland for like two more nights.

Speaker 1:          00:24:01       This was a deal like New Year's eve was a was like, like a Thursday. Yeah, there was a Wednesday or Thursday. So then there was new year's day and nobody's coming out that day, but then there was, you still had the weekend, so I had this weird weekend there where I was working new years. I was doing a run the whole week doing new years and I had a day off so I had a day off and nick, the club owner of the greatest guy ever at, uh, hilarity is out there in Cleveland. He goes, hey, you know, just just watch out for the guy, you know, keep them company, Blah Blah. Do we fucking drank all day? They actually lost me at one point. We somehow ended up in this brutal titty.

Speaker 2:          00:24:35       Yeah. Rudel Silverhorse silver horse and a, yeah, that's a boring Cleveland as you need. Like the comic needs to be assigned somebody to just invest. That's how it was. I was like that guy. I was like, Hey Jason, what are you doing now? Well entertain this guy please.

Speaker 1:          00:24:52       Cleveland is way better than even, it was like 10 years. What's wrong? Like an attitude. I wish she had money back then cause I was like, I'm, I'm like, I'm going to buy a frigging building. Cause you could see it in common. It's common back around, unlike Detroit, which keeps starting and stopping Cleveland. You could buy a hospital for like 80 grand and Cleveland they showed me, they showed how, I swear I'm there, I'm closing on a hospital. You could get like a four bedroom house there for like $36,000. It's insane. But I gotta tell you though, but like when, when I first played hilarity, he's in Cleveland. That was the only game in town on that street. You walk like you walked up that street like a cotton and I crossed the street out of my hotel. It's the cop met you at the corner and walked you up the street and now it's like closed off to traffic.

Speaker 1:          00:25:37       They got the house of blues across the street and they got all this stuff going on, restaurants and stuff. I remember seeing this giant apartment building like right across the way. I think Mike was living there at the time around the corner and I was thinking like, like I was literally thinking that I bet you could buy that thing for 75 grand and in 20 years it's going to be worth like millions of dollars as this whole thing eventually hopefully comes back, you know, you know they've got the casino, they just build another casino. Like not downtown but somewhere else. But um

Speaker 2:          00:26:02       oh that's not a good idea that I don't like that idea. I just don't like the casino at the, I think that we could have built that, that there is no reason that that city can't be built on its waterfront and its character and its positioned geographically in the country through casinos. Then casino nightlife for like toddlers. The nice thing about the [inaudible], we're close to DC, we're close to New York. There's no reason we can't be successful. But you know, it's funny though, the Nice thing was I said to, well you know ball the color I love, but I said, I said, he loves you pay, he loves your parents. And I said to Bob, I go, how come to, you know, where's the home? Cause homeless is big out there. Big, big, like they come after you and I go, how come there is it just light on the homeless? And he goes, they're all at the casino. That's just like all, yeah. Oh, is that right?

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       Yeah. They just all hanging out at the workplace. A nickel slots all day long. That was like the lottery for that one. That was the lottery. Then you're bringing in the trenches, started stretching when that clicks again. Wow. Why would homeless people go to a casino? They don't have any fucking money. What are they doing that they, whatever they make those, some of those people make decent money. It's amazing. I love that theory. And it's all those guys. Yeah, they make like a hundred grand. So of them do. Now, I don't know about a hundred grand a year, but some of them make their own urine in that fucking cardboard box. And we talk about committed to the free scam. It's freezing fucking Ohio. Whether it was fucking, uh, what's that shit? When you feed a frostbite black toes, making a hundred grand a year, you know, you gotta make sacrifices.

Speaker 1:          00:27:34       Nfl guys smash their brains around the homeless. They lose their toe, do that scam and south beach to call my own gift. Black Long. You get a blood flow to it. I got to tell you, when I was in San Francisco, uh, I was just up there trying to find someplace where I could shoot my special and, and I have never seen so many people laying around not doing shit. Then that city, I don't know what, everywhere. Well, they used to have a stipend. They used to fucking give them money. It was, this was hilarious. Like gave the homeless, we would give him enough money to get there, tried to get him off the street. That was one of those things where it made sense if you were giving it to people who thought sensibly, but they did and they gave it to the fucking homeless. So they would give you enough money so you could afford rent in some flop house for a month.

Speaker 1:          00:28:15       So what would happen is the first four days of the month you wouldn't see any homeless people. They were all inside drinking, you're shooting and drugs and all that shit with the money. They didn't have enough money for four days and then by the fifth day they'd start coming out like zombies and then you had the problem again. So they get with basically we're buying themselves like a four, five day reprieve. Now of course, as always with all my stories, that's just something that like four, four or five people did tell me that story in San Francisco. I don't know if it's true, but I was there and they had, um, they all have the, all these beautiful parks and dude, these people are snoozing to a level. You actually start thinking like, what am I working for it? Look at that too. And I saw this guy like, he was like face down in the sun, like some old hound dog.

Speaker 1:          00:28:58       And I was, you're just thinking like this fucking guy. Like I know he's living outside, but he's eating. Yeah. You know, he doesn't have any conference calls. There's no debt. Doesn't wake him up. This guy, dude, and it was such a beautiful sunny day. It was one of those days where you actually would entertain the thought that I could like I maybe I could just fucking live. I'll dad. Beautiful Dude. I took a picture of the guy and I just, I tweeted it and what was funny is I didn't even realize that there was another guy in the background. It's like you can't just get one. This is so many of them when you get to the parks, just fucking lying all over the place. Um, I saw what I was just there and do a is a couple of weeks ago and I saw a guy laying on a park bench sleeping covered up champagne bottle ed is at his feet, right?

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       Cop Strolling. I was sitting in another part, but it's just people watching. This guy's hilarious. He just bundled up. Not only am I watching this guy, he's got the champagne bottle, have his feet, two cops comes strolling up towards him. They're like, Hey god, Hey, let's go pick it up. Let's go. And one guy picks up and he like wakes up out of a panic and he sees the one cop holding is half empty bottle and he's getting ready to go pour it out and he's like panicking like it's not my wine and I wanted a guy doesn't care. He knows. He's like, yeah, I'm sure it's not. He's like pouring it out. Right. The funniest thing is is this guy, when he got up and he rattled off and I noticed it after he woke up and he put it up there, he had American Airlines I the patches to cover your eyes. You can sort of the sleep mask on an American Airlines logo, flimsy little woman. They probably give you on the flight and they were so then they were up on his forehead as he was like begging for mercy when the cop was, I'm looking at them going, wait a minute, what are you worried about anyway? Did I'm putting you under a route, like a roof? What are you worried about?

Speaker 1:          00:30:43       Yeah, but dude, I would rather sleep outside, worry about getting hit over the head with a log. Fucking take. One of my acid, you know, hey, you know, I heard I just like a bed. They actually, uh, they actually, uh, one of those cities when they had like the stipend, other cities were flying their fucking homeless people in there to just get rid of them because they were having, and then they started sending them back. I forget what the fuck happened. Maybe that's where that guy got the mask. I can't remember. I can't remember what, it would be hilarious if that's where he got the legs still had it. That's what I'm guessing. The other night in New York I saw a lot of the homeless, they sleep on the top step of the church, but the church never lets him in. So like they're just laying there like what?

Speaker 1:          00:31:25       No, I know. But after a while they got to be like, listen, they're not listening. They're not opening up. Let's go somewhere else. You know what I mean? Like they're just laying on the thing and it's almost like sad cause it's almost like they have the belief and the faith and they're being shut out. Well, I think that the church church, and I'm going to Starbucks, I'm going to somewhere else because it's no one, someone's not listening to him. I'm showing my faith. No, but it's good business for them to let them stay there. Like they give a fuck, but they're not going to let them in. Um, but I don't know. That seems like a safe place. You want a safe place to sleep if you're home. I want if any homeless people in the church floor, cause I don't want it in there to say this part about how this conversation got steered into is we were talking about Cleveland.

Speaker 3:          00:32:13       It's the saddest part of it all. Oh we, we've just gone to the dregs of humor comics, dark Cleveland. But anyway,

Speaker 1:          00:32:22       no, but I find that interesting when I kept seeing you don't want a bunch of smelly homeless people sticking up the church for the decent people who've come in on Sundays. And that might sound like Fox News. But at the end of the day, if you smell like urine, you smell like urine. You gotta go outside with the dogs. What if to do doesn't smell and he's just freezing, you know, put a, put them in one of the pews and let them get home. Fucking let him sleep in your base, but smell only thousand. I said, look, I understand. Going to let him see my butt. You smells good though, Paul. You got it. You've just got some Irish spring. Me, just stranger. There's a church. He's going to go in there and steal all the chalices that they stole from the other fucking people. I just feel like if he's saying that he's got faith in that church, they should do something.

Speaker 1:          00:32:57       And that's all. That's what churches should be. That's what it's about. Should be homeless after cost. Money, baby. Put a little in the back. Exactly. But that's my point. That's my point. What is your point, Paul? My point is that like, they kind of get faith on us here. No, no, no. I'm just saying like, uh, you know, uh, I know, you know what I'm saying is I, I, I see them laying on the front step of the churches and it's kind of a sad thing to see because they're wrapped up in their blankets and they have so much faith in that belief. Yet the doors are never opening and it was just a, an observation that I've found fucked up. Why do you think that the fact that they're sleeping on the stairs means they believe in Jesus Christ? I'm not saying that. I'm just saying that it's just, I, I think the people that show thing is unraveling.

Speaker 1:          00:33:43       No, I think that, I think the fact that these people choose to be on the, on the top step at the door of a church, it tells me that they have some sort of faith because I think I put it down. What if it rains? You want to be underneath the arch. There's a million. You could go under, you know, awnings are places or you could go on dirt, you know, buildings. They have a little one. The church stairs. Yeah. It doesn't mean you believe in Burger King, but you know what? The church that I saw this guy on, there was no roof. He was just sleeping there, man. So I just put, I just pushed off. I don't think he believes in it. Okay. I don't think he does. Cause you know, no, but you don't know him either. No, I don't. But I think it's he could or he might not. It's that just because you're sleeping on church, there's doesn't mean you fucking believe in anything. Well, what did you think it's a good guest to think that he's got some sort of faith. If that's his choice of, I would think it would be safer to sleep there then outside of white castle. This is the first dude you've called it on a homeless.

Speaker 1:          00:34:34       What a fuck is Bart? Nick say he ain't making it. Yeah, that's Barton nigger. He ain't gonna make it cause it's gonna make it. This is, this is this. So this education, this is the dedication we're going to have with this fucking tour. Is that what we're saying here? Um, no, but going back to drinking on, let's, let's start some more arguments here. Hey, so you're a Cleveland Indians Fan, a red sox fan. He's a Yankees fan or all American league east. They're all American league east night. Um, w how do you feel about both of our teams and the way we spend money each year? I think it's disgusting. Now. I will say that Boston last year wanted in a way where they didn't go out and over, like they didn't spend any more than they kind of had been spending. Uh, I love the fact that most of the, most of the trend is all these deans that are spending money aren't really the teams that are being successful.

Speaker 1:          00:35:27       At the end of the day, the doctors were $135 million. Any outspend the Yankees and the number one to you. I loved it. That sits, you can finally say that. See, I loved it. No, not because of that. I just love the fact that like the Dodgers are trying to, you know, the Dodgers are going all in. Well they hell, they have to all link towards what's he know because they've been, they've been, they've been 25 years without a championship. Um, they've corrected their financial situation after the guy and magic new, you know what, I forget the guy's name at random. Under the ground spending $230 million is the waiting, well, you know, they didn't set the trend. I I to believe that if they believe that they're going to do something, uh, that the Yankees or Boston have done, which they haven't done yet in this, in this economics of baseball.

Speaker 1:          00:36:17       Yeah, you got to do it. I mean, the last time they, they, one was in 88 when the economics, we're shifting a little, but it wasn't, it wasn't a five mega market league. Being able to spend that kind of, there, there's only five teams I can spend that kind of, there's only five teams that can spend that kind of money. So why wouldn't they, if they're one of the five teams that can spend it anywhere, should question, why do you think that baseball allowed it to, to go the direction? What was the, what was the thinking that it was good to let fucking the Yankees do what they did, which caused the red sox to have to react to it and then we became them. What, I mean, we're not right now I don't think, but, but we in oh seven. I mean there's no fucking, there's no, there's nobody on the planet that can't tell me, oh seven we didn't buy a fucking title.

Speaker 3:          00:37:02       Well, I think it all stems back. A lot of it stems back from, obviously you can't change what happens moneywise but I think a lot of it sends back to when the um, owners were, you know, uh, found out about the collusion in, in the late eighties and they had to pay once they paid the, once they played the players union, I think $350 million settlement for collusion and the players, union owners getting together going down. They said don't pay Jack Morris is what it was. Jack Morris was on the free agent market, I think in [inaudible] 86 or 87. And The tigers owner told all the other owners, don't pay him. Keep him at the market value that we have in Italy in the long run. Yeah, we get to keep Jack Morris, but in the long run all you guys will get be able to keep your Kirby buckets and your Roger Clemens is at a price that won't gorgeous. That was vida blah blah blah. The end of the day is it strength in the player's Union to a point where the salaries have gotten to the point that the player's union really runs the market and they run the market. So now the big market teams that have the money they've opened, the player's union is have made, has made it able to be able to speak for those teams to spend that money and the rich teams can, well that's, that's the bottom line. The bottom line,

Speaker 1:          00:38:14       as long as there's no cap in baseball, 80% of the teams will never win a world series.

Speaker 3:          00:38:20       No, it says as long as there's no cap, the Kansas city royals, I'm never going to one off. It's that high. But I mean it's good to at least 60 close to one thing is is what baseball has tried to do is obviously with the wildcard and now the extra wild card, if you tried to make it somewhat competable where as a team like Cleveland or if by the all star break, if we look like we're playing really well with the guys we've groomed in, we can go out and you know, get a, if the Philadelphia Phillies are fallen flat on her face, we can go out and get a Jimmy Rollins if he doesn't, if he wants to waive his trade clause and be like, you know what I want to go play for these guys are pretty good. I'm at a certain point in my career, I'd go hit, you know, when a title, whatever. That's the only thing baseball's done. The kind of recoup that. But

Speaker 1:          00:38:58       why they just don't look at the NFL and be like, okay, the way they're doing it. Greenbay can compete with New York City. Can you walkie compete with Boston? No. Like brewers compete with the red sox. They can't. So what the F why don't we do,

Speaker 3:          00:39:12       why should I assume you're so strong? Because they can get big players. You need to get the guys pay.

Speaker 1:          00:39:16       I think there's another walkout coming. We'll talk and lock out here on the podcast. Uh, I like talking and stuff.

Speaker 3:          00:39:22       I don't, I don't see it looming anytime soon. I think baseball's in probably a pretty pretty good labor, a labor situation because now the bay, the players haven't had to kind of weigh, crawl with their tails between their legs a little bit in the last few years with the, with the PE deals and everything else. So they've kind of had to kind of come off their high horse a bit. So now there's a little bit of love. There's a little bit of balance between players and owners because the players ever kind of had to go, hey, yeah, we were doing all of this.

Speaker 1:          00:39:49       That's so fucked up that those guys actually went in front of the Senate or whatever the fuck was going on. I don't understand. I just don't get why politics had to get involved. Why am I watching curt Schilling? Yeah. Talking to some representative from Minnesota. Yeah, because it's just fucking all stupid and you should be talking to is accountable shit. Hey, speaking of a lot, this sexual time, this ties in with a question here that uh, somebody said, I said Bill, what team, dear Billy batts if you could coach one team in history without knowing the outcome of the season, which team would you pick? Keep in mind, stack teams don't always win championships in, there were other teams that you that could have one perhaps with some better coaching. What the fuck? That was like a brain twister. Like a train's going this way. If I could coach one team in history without knowing the outcome of the season, which would I pick? Keep in mind, stack teams don't always win championships. Yeah, but the teams won the championship. I know if I coached the cowboys in 78 they won. They beat the Broncos. I don't get your question.

Speaker 3:          00:40:48       All right, drop that part of it. But what team would you coach because that is an interest in quit. Like if you could coach one team.

Speaker 1:          00:40:54       No, I think the question is saying now, like, I think the question is basically like what you see now. If you could coach one of these teams that's out there now, don't go out and try to win a championship to stack. Don't look who stack, but just say, well, who would you want it? Debbie says one team in history. Ah, okay. All right. Then look at this guy is either really smart and we're dumb or this is a fucking confusion question. Uh, I don't fucking know if I could coach one team. How about, can I play on the team and said, look, I'd like to cook. Go. I'll go every error in hockey. If I can play on any team, I would play for the, the, the eighties Edmonton Oilers. Um, if I could play, if I could, I guess, coach, Dude, you're the, you're a coach's son. Who would you coach? If I could coach one team one time, uh, I would probably,

Speaker 3:          00:41:43       I would probably coach Larry Bird's 79 Indiana state team against magic. I'd like to, I'd like to coach that game. I like to see if we could, if I could help, I'd like to see if I can beat magic.

Speaker 1:          00:41:53       Maybe there's this question. You know what I'd like to do? I'd like to coach the fucking, uh, 79 Dallas cowboys and the 76 Dallas cowboys to against the Steelers in both. And I, and I would win the fucking game. Yeah. That's how confident I am. Because they had their number in the first half. Uh, this is what we need Barton, dude, if you, I want somebody, somebody put up the 70 Superbowl 10, they put that up on, on the Internet to the cowboys called a reverse on the first play, reverse to Hollywood Henderson. He ran down the field that they're kicker tackled and we took a need of the ribs, fucked up three of his field goals and they will play in loose and all that. And they were up and then they played Marty ball in the second half and they got all fucking tight and they just stay, basically conserved the game away. Um, as far as the, uh, the 79, oh, I guess I would know this. I wouldn't throw it to fucking Jackie Slater or whatever the hell his name was. Jess Smith, bless his heart. He's a sec. As man in America, I would coach.

Speaker 3:          00:42:49       Did you see they outlawed the dunk. You know they made that a penalty. Now the dunk of over the goalpost and you were saying Hollywood Henderson, Hollywood Henderson invented the dunk of the goalposts. They would just had a base mesh first one or did they set up, they had a big thing on ESPN. Yeah, it was a, the owner's meeting over the winter. It's a 15 yard penalty now if you dunked the ball cause Joey Graham and all these guys. Oh it's a, you know, they dated it back to history. They like the WHO, the first man and it was Hollywood Henderson after a reverse. Landry used to call it reverse all the time to Hollywood Hendrickson and it was a, in 75 they called a reverse the Hollywood Henderson and a regular season game and he busted one loose for a touchdown and he was the first guy and they show it.

Speaker 3:          00:43:26       He's the first guy that glove and dunk it over the goalposts and outlawed because these tear there, they're tearing down low. They're tearing down. Some goalposts guys have gotten to heard, I guess. I don't know. Wow Mill. One Time Joey Graham from the saints was so strongly pulled one down where they had to come out and re level the goalpost cause it wasn't, you know, so he pulled it and then the next guy to kicks in and is kicking in and out. A lot of white guys upset about that rule. Wes Welker now the West woken up bitching about that at all. As long as it needs to. It needs to be on Joey, Jimmy Graham shoulders.

Speaker 1:          00:43:58       Why this is the deal. I would, I would, I would actually, if I could coach any team in history, what I would probably do is I would maybe the 86 red sox. Yeah. But no, but then I put Dave Stapleton in at first. Yeah. But, but that's only because I know what was going to happen. So like I could know. So like, uh, I would, I would try to pick a team that, that hasn't won a championship, but I live in Boston and they won't run the table. So I know, I don't know what to tell for me. It's a no brainer. I would 100% coach to nicks and I would, I would make them run, listen to that. I would make that run.

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       I would make them run until they puked. I would I, if they didn't play defense, they're out there find I would fucking goes up fast with this team. Quit on his second. You'd be a second nick coach in history to get choked. I would, I would fucking, I'd lay into those lazy cock suckers like I like, I swear to God, Dude. I want to be fun. Actually. I would like to just take a horrible team and just terrible. Yeah, you show me. You don't get back. Just get all my shit. I would do with Gene Hackman. Didn't Hoosiers minimum of three passes. Minimum of three passes. Okay. You fuckers are going to run all day. We're not, we're practicing the first month without a ball. Who are running up and down. Carmelo Anthony's. If you didn't go, you can do this with rows or they're all Carmello. Anthony's lazy we'd face would fuck it. Get everything shut. No, you want to wear that headband? Go take it off the top of the back. Yeah, I would fucking turn into, oh, that's what I would do. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:45:36       Nick Joey to do my puck off podcast and I thought I said I couldn't be heard and until to hey between you guys like you would need another 10 mikes. I don't think anyone's missing my, my uh, hey. Well we're currently answering a question right now. If you, if you, this would be perfect for you. Worked in coach, any team in history, not knowing the outcome. If you could just be the head coach who, who would you want to be? Head coach of? Oh, the Steelers 78 Steelers 78. Oh, I want to do the 78 cowboys or 76 cowboys. 76 roll the market. The whole ready for that shit. You would've thought you'd text Bart. Nick, the question three sixers. I was thinking to them too. I said six or I said, did they played four on five these play diver voting, I mean they played four on five.

Speaker 2:          00:46:27       They'd be that. It'd be genuine anyway. Yeah, I put them up against, I'd put them up against the 96 bolts. Yeah, we talked about that on mine. I never, he goes, who's gonna Stop Jordan? I'm like, why? I think doctor Janka kind of offset a lot of the shit he was doing. And then I got Moses against the fucking Luke long week. Yeah. I don't think anybody's been in the 96 bulls. That's because you're a child of the nineties dude, that team, they said they 79 Indiana state defensively as they were all, oh, that's a good one. But I'm telling you. But Luc Longley would have four files by, by the end of the first quarter trying to stop Moses Malone. And in all fairness, I didn't see enough of that 76 15 but how good was Pippin on Dif? I mean the defense xe offensively, they were phenomenal. There's a reason I picked the 96 bolts. Great. Well, Andrew, Tony had bad feet or Andrew. Tony would be in the hall of fame. Yeah, absolutely. Tony could, they didn't have six quarters back to your career. Broke him, strangling stroke them that they, that that was the ultimate two man

Speaker 5:          00:47:30       game. If you had to double team m and M, most of them bouts of nearby. He went from, from high school to dominating the dominate Aba. Aba Aba was like a fucking prison rec league. It was that mean the bet he was. Dot. People were afraid of Moses Malone. He like, he was 17 he was a beast. He was remember the mere expression of a man child and it was like him, Daryl Dawkins. He never lived up to those guys. Joe, was he the first guy to come out? Yeah, early. Yeah. Bose as well. Darryl Dawkins a second. Yeah. You know the funny thing is is Moses Malone and Lebron James are the only two guys in the history of the NBA to win consecutive MVP awards with different teams and they're the, and the, and they both never played college ball. It's pretty freaking impressive. Wow. I mean if you take out the big three, you know the, the, the, the, the, the, the mount, right.

Speaker 5:          00:48:24       You know, we'll Kareem and uh, Bill Russell the next, I mean this was in below weight and Moses, Moses, just like six, six, 10 truck. Yeah. Yeah. That's 17 who just, he's just crazy. He just didn't miss, what did they lose that year? They lost one playoff high school kid. That's a baby coming into that. Firstly they lost one playoff game. They actually, I asked Moses to predict. That's his famous thing. He goes, what do you think about the playoffs? He just goes, fold, fold, fold. Just me and we're going to sweep everybody. And they basically would, they'd lost one to the Lakers, three pho, pho, pho. Because back then it was the first round game was a five but three. Oh was okay. But the funny thing was is that was a huge six or fan. He seems to fit back in because I was a huge Dr Fan.

Speaker 5:          00:49:09       Huge six or fan and when he got traded cause you could, they could never win because Coldwell Jones and Dawkins and Steve Mix whatever agglomeration, the shit that they put together to stop either like parish or Jabar would never work. So we, they get him and he was heading to cover rock. He was like sitting on the steps like rocky. It was like you knew it was over. There was never a lock in the history of sports like Moses go into the sixers like was over. It was, it was, how come they only won one though? Cause doctor Jay was old. Moses wasn't, no, I mean he will, he wasn't old but he was, he was dude Moses, bad play back in the day where that do play 46 minutes and Knight Dragon gives up without it as I say like, because because of black Monday is why they definitely one one black Monday he trade hit black eye. The eye. The only time I ever cried in sports other than like Lemieux getting cancer, they were crying sports black Monday dude, they traded bread dough. They, they try to, they try to hit those below and the rights to bread Doherty for Roy Henson and Ruland dude, they trade. They are or are you still a NASCAR shit would do but they traded like they, the front line would have been a Barkley bread bread Doherty in Bozeman. Moses said I will never lose to the 76

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       there's again the bullets when like eight games that year, like five of them were against the six [inaudible] five he was like 30 and 25 it give Brad Doroty has probably the the most epic fucking hairline. It almost touches his eyebrows. I mean the fucking guy when he gets a shape up, I mean they gotta like put a separate it like at the grocery store between his eyebrows and his, it's just something sad about seeing Brad already talk NASCAR, you know, he's just sitting there talking. NASA was even sadder. We see this in the bench at all star Games. It was going to say this, this and this check I drafted. It was like, well they're good for Nascar is probably like fuck this. It's like, well Brad already cause they'll make plans for all star weekend. How did he get

Speaker 1:          00:51:15       you fucking go from, he's like, he's like one of the announcers for Nascar, Black Mountain North Carolina and he grew up in that shit and he loves it.

Drinking. No, we were talking about we were drinking and drinking.

Speaker 1:          00:54:09       Pointed at you like he was an NFL coach and you were a defensive player who missed an assignment? I I'm drinking but he said like, we were talking about smoking cigars and drinking and bill said, what's your game plan to not, you know, to not gain so much weight and go nuts. And I go listen, I go, I got to really just watch Barton it cause Barnick is you know you, you got that thing dude, you're unstoppable. You're fucking unstoppable. The thing is like an idiot every year at the rose bowl. I tried to go blow for blow your shot. I don't know why I was telling him, I was telling him that though at the wedding you were like, you guys want another heater. And like after the fifth time I was like Joe Man, you know we just met. I was looking at, I love, I need, I can't right now I need a break. And the end of the night you had those crowns, the shots and you're smoking a cigar and you're just intact. You are just fucking intact.

Speaker 5:          00:54:56       It's the way we grow them in Pittsburgh. I was back home with this weekend. I told people, I said, I know people in Hollywood, like I think I got to go to Rehab. I'm like, first of all, you drink wine. Yeah. I said, check the boat. My aunt's drink more than you before dinner. I mean, people pay it's drink. I mean cope. I mean, but no, there's a, there's never peer pressure because there's more boost for me. No, don't get me [inaudible] somebody me stop early, so we got to keep that in mind. No, no, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna definitely to have some guys have a writer. What is the writer on this tour? I don't know. I haven't even seen it. I didn't even have a rod track for openers

Speaker 1:          00:55:45       is going to be an amazing tour. If you guys, these guys are like that guy's guys to fucking hilarious. They know smarts and you know, it's not going to be a, trust me. You did. It's definitely worth the money. As I mentioned earlier, we're going to have all the dates up here. Uh, they play in San Diego, a Bellevue, Washington, Portland, Oregon, San Francisco twice in Sacramento so far, and then they got an east coast thing line up. I'm really psyched for you.

Speaker 5:          00:56:06       You guys got some Midwest shows like a people in that and did I want to thank everyone that came to the shows this week in Pittsburgh. They were awesome. We're, we're, we're, we're coming back as the tour. Nice. Nice. They're stoked for us in the DV guys are stoked for us to comment.

Speaker 1:          00:56:19       No, that's good. I just meant that you got,

Speaker 5:          00:56:21       I told him, I told him all about you. They're going to,

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       yeah, they're going to make fun of me. Is that they're going to do, no, we do. We feel your pain. We feel your feet. What do you feel? You don't feel super bowl championship to Cleveland. Pittsburgh rivalry. There is no, there is no robberies. No rivalry though. There is no rivalry. We don't even where we can't. You can't be, no, there isn't. Right. There's not a rivalry. It's your, your browns rivalry is now the ravens that we don't even have a rivalry with you because we haven't put up a fight and 15 years I made it. It's not as true. It doesn't exist. You think that there's people that I'm the outside looking in that remember that old brown Steelers that doesn't exist. You go to Cleveland for Brown Steelers games. It's a sea of black. There's no browns fans there. They sell their tickets of Pittsburgh fans.

Speaker 3:          00:57:06       There is no rivalry. You can't be rival. I wouldn't see the saddest moment and one of the saddest moments in La heads, adult life. We're watching the Steeler game in a bar in San Francisco. He was up there hanging out. We're done doing shows. You did some sets walking walk in the booth. We look over to the booth next to us. Guy Grew up right next door to him, like four houses, four houses down. They haven't seen it is cheering for the Steelers and he goes like, he's like, what are you doing? Is I just gave up. I wanted to back a winner. We see this kid in a booth next to me. I think he grew up four houses down from me. I'm like, Holy Christ, he's wearing a, he's on, it's a Sunday football that different people are in there watching different teams. Right. And he's like La head and I know he's wearing like a Cordell stewardship.

Speaker 3:          00:57:52       I got really, and he just said, he goes, hey, you know what? I just gave up a long time ago. I said, are you awareness steel? Are you rooting for this dealer that this the thing I understand, just saying fuck it, I am not watching it anymore. And then go to go to a different conferences. I wouldn't even root for anybody in the AFC. Exactly. I would, I would, I mean if I could, if I would root for any I've, I've contemplated it and my thoughts on my, my contemplations are, I would go, and I know you hate him, but they're central to me. And I liked the new young quarterback. If I had to quit, which I've thought of, I'm thinking of quitting and going to Indy. I don't mind Nandy right. Well, I mean, am I an idiot? I liked Gluck. They're close by.

Speaker 3:          00:58:32       They're a small little town. They've done everything right. I, I'm thinking what? Whatever I've talked about. That's a plus, right? Exactly. I'm saying their owner does drugs, sits on the rules committee changes, rules of passing the hell. That's like a Knicks fan. Becoming a fucking Brooklyn Nets fan is despicable, man. It can't. It can't do it. I'm just saying, if I thought about it, if I agree with bill, this guy watching him, just stop watching it and give up, but you can't just automatically take your journey, puts it, go buy it. Go to the store by how the fucking Jersey. Then what happens when your team actually fucking wins it? Yeah. Then you're an idiot. Then you deserve it. You deserve your team to win it a couple of years ago, that's not going to actually happen. No. It has to happen. Eventually. Say, Hey, listen, we're going to, we're going, do I have your guarantee?

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       We went up this year. It opens on to Delta. Got April. That's a guy that rats out. It's a movie called draft day. It opens. I'm sure it's something good's going to come out of it. That's a got it. Ratchet as friends, if you do that, if you do that, if you switch uniforms because they're not winning, you're a rat. You'll read sturdily. It's a carrier. Your waffle walls, you'll rate your friends out or you can't trust deck. Are you going to trust that guy? No, you can't trust that. Exactly. That's been going to what's going with stadium with his mother and father as a kid and then he just fucking throws in the towel and throws on the enemy shirt. That cable sell you down a fucking shirt. Is that, that's a character that is a character. That's a character flaw. Something's wrong. No, you're right and I think he and that person specifically, I'm not going to name names, you know?

Speaker 2:          01:00:03       Yeah. I need to join a puck off today. I need you a pug of, there's a lot, a lot of Bruin stuff going on. My man crush. What was just what he did. Did he do dude hitting the guy in the and the balls from behind with a stick. I didn't see it yesterday. No. Can they have all the Canadian gay dude? I was so jet lagged and not so wiped off my toy. I actually forgot Monday nights, usually dark. Not only did they have a game, they played the Canadians. I missed every second of that. I saw the capitals game. I saw the flyers game this weekend. Uh, who else did they play? I think they each do what? Looch he speared him from the back under his butt. Like hit him in the taint. The guy went down like a house of cards. It was, it was not, it was not something that does Lou chicken to put that on the highlight reel. I got to see that. What a thing. I got to see that. Yeah, he, he's stick them underneath like it was real. I'm like, Luke, what are you doing?

Speaker 4:          01:00:58       Huh?
