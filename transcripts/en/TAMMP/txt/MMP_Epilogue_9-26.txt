Speaker 1:          00:00          Alcohol. Hey, what's going on? It's bill burr. And as promised this week, there's going to be a Monday morning podcast epilogue with uh, the wonderful, the lovely, the lovely Nia who's a little under the weather, a little under the weather. But I'm here for you. I'm here for you guys to make me laugh too much, but I'm here. Yes, you are here. Be in a fucking true. Yeah. Well, I'm also on my way to the freaking airport, so we got to do this one quickly turning old friend into girlfriend or, and I see, and I just thought that this was a question for me, Nia, as most of these ares, considering this is my podcast, but you have become such an epic personality on it. Wow. That more often than not, these questions start this way. Hey, Bill, love the podcast. We'd really like your, and then in parentheses and Nias if possible, thoughts on the subject.

Speaker 1:          00:59          So you've gone up to not being mentioned at all to saying Nia if possible, right? Yeah. Right. And ask and ye shall receive right. Here I am. So you're basically at this level, the same level of the professor and Maryanne on Gilligan's island. What do you, what do you mean the professor and Marianne? Because they did, they did that song two ways at the beginning. Right. Pat, can you hear it? Tails and they'd go [inaudible] ran his wife, they're movie star and then they'd be like, the professor ran Mary Yang. So they already said, um, last, but then a couple of times they'd be like the movie star and the rest. Oh Hey. Yeah. And the rest and the rest. And I want to say like that had they had done that first and their agents had to been like, listen, who's kidding? Who Marianne is fucking hotter. Yeah, she was definitely hotter and hotter than ginger.

Speaker 1:          01:51          I liked her, but I always like brunettes better. I'm a ginger. I'm not going to put Yaba Daba do, you can fucking the same thing. Ginger was, you know, she was, oh, she was definitely smoking. But I mean, when Marianne was the more, you know, she was the girl next door, she's more accessible. And I thought the professor is pretty hot too far. We really riffing about the Sherwood Schwartz. We are. All right, let's get into this here. All right. There's a lady I've been friends with for over a decade now. We met in college and for about a year or two back then I would have considered a one of my closest friends. That means he's jerking off to her, um, to, I really, I really cherish our friendship. She walks away. How's, Yup. And then he feels really bad and then he goes to church and he gives money and that money is used in a pedophile case, you know, so ladies really taking it out.

Speaker 1:          02:45          They're all friends. Yeah. For the kids. Oh God. Um, during that whole time she had a boyfriend, so I never thought about making a move, stupid and lack the confidence to do so anyways. It's not a husband. Um, as time went on, we gradually lost contact until recently I found her on Facebook like you do, like you do. And we spoke for the first time in a, we live in the same city. So I suggested we get together and catch up, which she is enthusiastic about and is going, it's going to happen sometime soon. Now for the details were both single and 30 years old. She's recently divorced. No kids clean break with little to no drama. Nice. She is beautiful. And honestly one of the nicest people I've ever met. That's funny cause I see a red flag. Oh yeah. Then why'd the guy just dumper, uh, you know, that she didn't dump him?

Speaker 1:          03:37          Oh, come on. Oh, come on. Was seriously, seriously. What do you, where are you based in a stop it people get divorced for a lot of reasons. Stop it. Um, I had no point. I just want to annoy you, so, all right, go ahead and finish it up. Hurry back when we were close, I was okay looking, but extremely skinny and shy. Since then I put on about 25 to 30 pounds of fat and muscle distributed pretty evenly. This guy's an honest guy, so I'm looking much better and that is boosted my confidence. Um, yeah cause you can use your gut to pin them against the bar. He'd going home with me. That's disgusting. My question. She has only know me as the friend Zone Guy, the classic Chris Rock Bit. Uh, but does eight years with no contact or racist and you think I might have a shot with her.

Speaker 1:          04:29          Any advice on how to go about this and how to act and what to say on the night we catch up would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance. A PS, one thing may be an issue here. After I suggested a ketchup, I checked on her Facebook page and it turns out that she changed her status from married to single only a day or two earlier. How would you find that out? Cause he was watching it, watching stalking her on Facebook. Yeah. He knows every little fucking change she makes it. Yeah. But this could be as hard though. It could be as hard, you know? Yeah. But I think at a certain point you got to step away from the Facebook. Yeah. But without that he wouldn't, he wouldn't have seen it. But anyways, he gets his button real life. That's true. She said she's been signal for a few months.

Speaker 1:          05:12          Yeah, so that was inadvertent, rotten timing on my part. Hopefully I don't come across as tankless opportunities. Opportunistic douchebag. No, no, no, no, no. Not at all. I don't think so. No, because they are probably separated for a long time, you know, but still technically married. Look, no marriage falls apart in three weeks. She was already mentally out, you know? Yeah. They probably having problems. They separate and he moved out or she moved out, but she still technically married. She's sleeping in the bedroom. He's downstairs on the couch or whatever. Or they're in separate places. They might have different bedrooms. I'm not, no, I'm not saying it like that. She could be paying for the house. I didn't mean it like that. I was saying like that weird, like the end of the relationship where you're in the same place and like you got to pass each other in the kitchen, you know, and act like you're on a subway and don't know

Speaker 2:          05:58          each other.

Speaker 1:          05:58          Well, I guess that does happen if people can't afford to go and get their own places. But yeah, you'd think in an ideal situation they wouldn't have to still be under the same roof looking at each other and thinking about all the things that went wrong. All right, so he wants to know, does the eight years I've not contact erase the pass. Yeah. Does that erase the free now? It does not. No, no, no it doesn't. I don't know that it doesn't erase the friend zone. How does that

Speaker 2:          06:25          work? Like I can't hang out with someone who has a vagina and not eventually wanna Bang, Bang them

Speaker 1:          06:35          with.

Speaker 2:          06:37          Yeah. Unless I'm just completely not attracted to them, which means they would have to be some sort of, you know, major car accident or something. That's, that's a horrible thing to say.

Speaker 1:          06:50          Yeah. I'm just, I don't, it doesn't, it doesn't. Um, no, it's more like you guys have a history of friendship, but it can always change because things change.

Speaker 2:          07:00          At what point when you, when, when you're hanging out with somebody, would you be like, oh, this person's like, cause I would just think if, if you're hitting it off and you'd be like being in friends. Yeah. Then eventually aren't you thinking like, well hey, you know, maybe, uh, maybe this would go to the next level. What it does cross your mind. So what exactly does a guy do? How can we avoid this purgatory? Because none of us want to be friends with you.

Speaker 1:          07:27          Well, really we look at bump, Bang them with you, then a friendship. Bang. If I'm begging you, then I can become friends with you by discovering who you are after the ass. But you don't think that people can be friends with each other. Right.

Speaker 2:          07:42          Hang out and, and not have that energy between them. Listen to you. I'm a closer, I'm hoping, I was hoping to give you a spit take. No, I don't know. Is she drinking your I'm sick. T I a

Speaker 1:          08:00          hi philosophy that I'm friends with guys and I bring it with you. Yeah, exactly. You're not friends with women because you're one of those people that doesn't think that men and women can really be friends because the sex thing always gets in the way. Which I used to feel big time. Yeah. I don't know, but I don't think that's true anymore because I'm friends with a guy, isn't it? It's not like that because it's 100% it's not really. It's a maturity thing. Yeah, absolutely.

Speaker 2:          08:30          Mm. I Dunno. Maybe. Well, all right. Well, you know what? It's not like I'm, I'm not going to waste time on this thing actually trying to defend that I'm a mature human. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          08:38          I'm not, there would be no point now. That wouldn't be. I don't think I would just trash myself. Then you piled on. Hey did. So anyway. I don't think that the eight years it doesn't. I had to get out of it. How does this guy get out of it? You go and you meet and you, you, you, you take it up notch. Now you're both single. You're both older and wiser. Don't stop speaking in code. Is it the take it up and watch what you throw? Some sugar in there, like a Mario Batali. Oh No. What's his name? Emilio. Estevez. What's the name of that fucking cook? Mri. Got some sugar, Bam. And the crowd goes nuts. Yeah. You just, you flirt with her. He just maybe compliment her a little bit more than you did before and all that kind of stuff would take it slow.

Speaker 1:          09:18          Start hanging out more. All right, let's break your attentions. Next role. Play. Okay. Okay. You're the dude. Okay. And I'm the chick. Oh God. In the friend zone after eight years. Right. All right. We're meeting. Okay. And we see each other. Hey. Oh my God. Look at you. You look amazing. How are you doing? Oh, thank you. Well, you know, considering, yeah, marriage just ended. I'm sorry to hear about that. I don't know what that was. There's a lot of cards in this restaurant that's really, oh, we don't have to eat here. No, I got it. Okay. I saw some things on the menu. Yeah. So, well, we can go wherever you want. It's up to you. Okay. Yeah. Um, I'm sorry to hear. I was just bringing that negativity and that's why I was never this person. I would never, this person, he brought that in my car and I remember, I remember you.

Speaker 1:          10:05          Okay. And you were the most positive radiant person I've ever met. Oh, stop. I have no doubt. No, seriously. I have no doubt that it wasn't, it wasn't your fault. Listen, I know it takes two to tango to, to end the relationship. Jumping into this sign up. You already met the host of Shit and you're just, wow. I have to admit. I'm excited to see you. Uh, can we kitsu please. That's nice. You know, it's been a while since I felt somebody was excited to see me. I am, I'm excited for it for awhile to see. I got to admit. Um, but anyway, tell me, tell me what else is going on with you. At what point are you going to throw a joke out there? If I could just interject. You've got to make a laugh at some point. Why? I'm sorry, I'm not a professional frigging comedian.

Speaker 1:          10:43          All right. I'm just going to get you nowhere, the ground. Alright. Okay. Alright. Okay. Um, you want to eat in the high road? Whatever you want to do. Okay. Well you didn't inside. Okay. All right. Can I get you want something to drink or uh, oh yes. What do you want? I'll have a alone and lethal bottle. Okay. Oh, just a lot. A lot of stress. Yeah, I understand. Can we get a bottle of your house? Where though? Thank you. You want some food or like a salad or burgers? Absolutely. So what have you been doing? You look different. Well, yeah, muscular and kind of fat and it all works.

Speaker 3:          11:26          Let

Speaker 1:          11:27          me try to take care of myself. I got to to, I wanted to look nice for you tonight. Fuck this. W W like I personally, I would try one, I'll throw my theories out here. What I would do is I would come in and immediately try to make her laugh and it's some point I would point out how gorgeous some other woman was that just walked by. Like, wow, that girl's, you know, and cause that would be like, oh, you like her is that was, you're fucking me into that. But by me kind of start steering it towards the sex thing to get out of the friend zone. Wow. You've changed, you're like really forward. Now you're on the side of my breast. That's not really a hug is it? That's ridiculous. Terrible idea. It's the name of my next special what? That's ridiculous. That's a terrible idea.

Speaker 1:          12:13          That sums up all of my theories. No, no, no. He should go on there and be, he should be flirtatious with her and have it not you. So you can then get the motor running. You can then as as that, and you're right. Cause it shouldn't be too much dwelling on the past that Oh my God, what happened and all, I'm so sorry about that. It shouldn't be. So you want to get her out of that. He wants to go in and just be like, I'm living life. Bring in this. He's got a light up there. He's got to go magic Johnson on this one. Right, right. Exactly. Not Corinne. He's gotta be magic. Not Kareem. It's right.

Speaker 1:          12:49          Yeah. He wouldn't know. You should go in there. Be flirtatious. Be Complimentary. Definitely. Definitely. But don't be in a, not in a predatory way. I don't know that this guy really understands the balance, or maybe he does and he's just got, he's a stalker, but he doesn't want to be too far the other side because then it's like, what happened to you? You used to be so nice and all of a sudden you're a creepo. So he's got to be able to bring back that flirtatious, sexy energy without being totally disgusting. And Are you guys picking up on this? This is what, this is why it's so hard for guys to get laid because it's literally like dismantling a bomb. It's gotta be the perfect combination of flirty, but not creepy, but not overbearing, but not disinterested or whatever, if I'm using that word correctly.

Speaker 1:          13:35          Um, listen, I, I think you've, you've, you've, you've helped without a doubt. I'm sorry. No, no, no. It's just that I have to go to the fucking airport. Um, shout out to Jacksonville. Shout out to Jacksonville. I'm coming to that strip mall out there to the comedy zone with dude. I called it. What did I say? What did I say? Robinson Cano. Dude Robinson could know. Um, Paul Versey as guests that your pulverize the impression. It's really, I'm just, I started to do Bobby and then I tried to tone it down. I thought it sounded like Bobby, anything. That's it. Yeah, that's Bobby. But that's just become a generic sort of impression. Kind of like your generic female voice. Yeah. It was kind of sounds like a stereotypical gay man. It's a little bit different. I twist it up. Oh, I see. That's what's set up just a little bit.

Speaker 1:          14:25          Yeah. I never claimed to be Michael Winslow. Okay. I'm a one trick pony. I see something. It makes me angry and then I yell about it. Uh, just tell this guy I, I'm excited. I'm excited for this guy as the one I want to say. I'm excited for this guy to reconnect with her to possibly take it to the next level cause I think they've got a great foundation. Your friends. Yeah. I don't know. It's nice. It's a nice story and it's a, he seems like a nice guy. Go in there and make it happen, but it doesn't necessarily have to happen on the first meeting, you know, you'd meet up, it'd be kind of flirty, you walk away, you come back to it and then you hang out again. Then you playing ping pong and it's just like, well he just got to learn not to get into that friend zone.

Speaker 1:          15:11          You got to make it more about like how she's attractive, make it clear that you're interested in her and you've always say for certain just reach across. He puts your hand on a forum and you say, listen, listen Selena, I really hope this isn't too forward, but I have always, always, you know, you got to maybe pull the move. You pulled on me. What do you, what do you mean when you were like let's share a cab. When we were living in New York and I was like, why? Why do you want to share a cab? And I said, cause I want to kiss you. Yeah. And that was like the perfect thing to say. But he got, see, it's honest. It's like, you know, it kind of sets the mood. I looked at your fat and then I looked away. You can't say that in the continued to stare it up.

Speaker 1:          16:00          No, that's, that is the world series of poker moment. When you go fucking, I'll let you go all in and then you stand up, you walk around, walk around the table. Here comes the river. Right. Exactly. I'll take a cab with you. I was fucking, I was on my game that night. You were then we got in the cab and you said, uh, is would riding along and that fucking jerk off was driving like a maniac. You said, you're going to kiss me yet. And I said, no, I'm waiting for a red light. We had a red light and then we kissed. Right. That's true. Then what happened? We drove again. The guy's being a maniac and then he slowed down and you're like, it's another red light. And then that was it. And I was in Bingo Bango and then hit left.

Speaker 2:          16:37          Fuck. I am years later with the dog living with you and it's awesome. So good luck to you sir. Um, that was a nice ending, wasn't it? Was all right. What can I hype crane horror out my stuff cause I forgot to say my new special you people are all the same is going to be available, um, for download off of Bill bird.com on October 1st USA time. I don't know what, but it's going to be there. We'll probably try and put it up. Do you say USA time? Yeah. I got people in Australia and a bunch of people. Uh, October 1st is USA. I'll go fuck yourself. Thank you to everybody who was sent me all the nice comments. People liked what I did on Twitter. I'm sorry to those Twitter on Conan. They tweeted me. There you go. And they said that they enjoyed my performance and I had a uh, I had a great time.

Speaker 1:          17:26          I thought you, I thought you did an amazing job on Conan. It was a hilarious, people were really, uh, taken aback by your Steve Jobs.

Speaker 2:          17:36          Yeah, but they weren't though. They weren't, but they weren't. Come on, man. You know what it is. It's like those are a bunch of happy people who came out to Hollywood wanting to go to a TV taping are all in a great mood and all of a sudden this 44 year old curmudgeon comes out. It took half a then they got

Speaker 1:          17:50          on board. I had a good time. No, it was funny. Yeah. And Conan was was awesome as always. He just started teeing me up. The end of wars is really likes you too, which was a fantastic Bam. You guys watch the whole cone and you should have because they have to. Florence band of horses is at the troubadour on Thursday night. Yeah. So if you want to see these guys, you should go. Yeah, they are kick ass bad and they loved you and they're opening up for a Willie Nelson coming up. So it's, Oh my God. Usually when they come through here, like my buddy Solomon, like the Wiltern theater, which is like a 300 seat or so. The troubadour, you know, it's a good, good venue that holds like 400 people. That's like the coming over to your house. They're probably sold out already. I don't know why. Why do we go with the negative? No, not to happen? Because they will see the horse assuming that they're going to be sold out anyway. All right, well, I'll try it. I'll try and see if I can get you some. All right. I have to go to the lovely Nia.
