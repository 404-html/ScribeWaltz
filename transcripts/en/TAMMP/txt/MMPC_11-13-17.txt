Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday, November 13th, 2017. What's going on? How I, yeah, what's going on? I am in New York City, both boom, boom. Buttered oda doubt to dote. Um, oh, it's actually Hollywood with the fuck am I thinking? It's not a New York Song, right?

Speaker 2:          00:00:27       Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam.

Speaker 1:          00:00:33       Did it. It did it. That's Hollywood right? That's in New York side. Starts spread in the nose. Right? I don't fucking know. I'm all over the map here. Um, I'm winding down this trip. I just wrapped up my acting gig on front runner. Uh, I want to thank everybody that, that allowed me to be on that movie. I had such a great time. I met so many great people on that shoot. And, uh, the last night of the shoot, I actually got to do a scene with the star of the movie. He was

Speaker 2:          00:01:05       Jackman. And um,

Speaker 1:          00:01:09       I can't even tell you how great that experience was. He might, he might be the not one of the nicest guys I've ever met in my life. Uh, totally cool. Big Guy too. He's like six, four or something. Big Guy. Totally cool. Nicest fucking dude ever. Then you start doing the scene right. And it's, his character in the scene was getting, was getting mad and frustrated with us dude. And he went into that wolverine thing a little bit. I was just like, Jesus Christ, I will not fuck with this guy. Just an amazing, amazing actor. And uh, I was the coolest thing. Like on the last night, we had like two things to shoot, like one quick thing in a car and then the whole rest of the thing was, uh, us, you know, like me and two other actors and Hugh Jackman. And it was just like, it was a, yeah, we shot that the whole night.

Speaker 1:          00:02:06       And it was one of those things where he's like, I wouldn't really care if we continued shooting this scene tomorrow. I'm having so much fun. You know what I found out? I actually, I like to run when I act. This scene involves me running into running before I delivered the, uh, my lines or whatever. And I found that I really liked that and I was just like, wow, no wonder. I always like William Shatner and Tj Hooker. I know I've talked about this before, but if you ever watch TJ hooker, I don't think in the history of television they ever, they ever made an actor run farther than they made William Shatner who's well into his 50s by then they would just have like this the master shot of the scene and I want to get all Hollywood here run yet, but the master is just, when you go to shoot this scene is you're just, it's a wide shot and you're capturing every character in it or you're establishing the place, the setting.

Speaker 1:          00:03:04       I have no fucking idea. I think that's what it is. Right. They would just, they would just be standing on the other side of a wharf, a runway like Williams shot and he chased after planes and they would just start and he would come running around the corner and he would always be like look 70 yards away and they'd be playing this fucking music with the Bongos in the background and you would watch him just full speed running a man in his 50s all right. And this is like the 80 so no guys stretched unless you were on like you know you had to be like in the Olympics and even then if you watch like the old NFL films, the way that they would stretch, you know what I mean? They weren't doing like any just sort of you know, doing a forward bend, none of that Yoga Shit.

Speaker 1:          00:03:47       It was like touch your toes, touch your hips, touching shoulders, do a jumping jack come back down or whatever the fuck they would do, what to treat for that type of stuff. I'm running and cop shoes, full speed for a good 80 yards. This is actually a great youtube video that I think I posted before of we have of Tj hooker running. Um, so anyways, I had the, uh, I had the best time and uh, did the perfect amount of time on the movie cause right when it ended I came right here to New York and then I'm going to go back and the rest of my year, other than like two road gigs, I am done. And I'm going to get to spend this ridiculous amount of quality time with my wife and daughter and I can't wait. I'm totally getting into the Christmas spirit this year.

Speaker 1:          00:04:32       Not to the point of sacrificing thanksgiving. Um, you know, I don't know, I might even put up a couple of little like cut up turkeys in my house. I hate out thanksgiving, just gets passed over. You know what I mean? Gets passed over like a a, I dunno like a person that should have got the job but didn't write a, but I'm totally getting into it and I am, I'm still so ba was it, he was 84 days on Thursday. So 85, 86, 87 88. Eric Lindros 88 Lynn Swann. I wasn't he 88. Yeah. Um, 88 days. Not boozing. And uh, I think I'm going to go for the hundred. I don't know. You know, I think I will be, let's see, I'll be 91 on Thursday a week from Thursday. It'll be 98 and then there'll be thanksgiving. And what, I'm not going to have a little brandy in my eggnog there.

Speaker 1:          00:05:29       A big with the brandy and the egg Nog you know? Um, that's what I would have added to the great opie and Anthony bit the Eggnog. OPA Anthony Little Jimmy. Right? You think those guys love to get back together? Do like a reunion tour. They should have like a one off. You don't need like a toy. You don't like the police got back together. They should do that with great radio shows where everybody eventually, you know, just got sick of each other and went the other way. But the fans are still sitting there like, come on man, just to one more tour, man. They should all get together. You know, I think it will have guns and roses can get back together.

Speaker 2:          00:06:09       Right. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:06:13       I know, fucking know. Anyways, plowing ahead of you. I'm totally going to get into the holidays. Uh,

Speaker 3:          00:06:20       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:06:20       And I dunno, I dunno about the drinking thing. I think I'm done for a while. Like I said, I want to go staying in my fifties. I'm turning 50 in June

Speaker 2:          00:06:30       and um,

Speaker 1:          00:06:32       I want to make sure, uh, I dunno, that's a critical fucking decade,

Speaker 2:          00:06:38       right?

Speaker 1:          00:06:40       That's that one. They make, you know, people like fucking die in their 50s. So I get them. That's when people just start dying. I mean, people, I've, I've gotten, I've already lost, like I've lost count how many fucking friends I actually, I have a list on my phone, so I don't forget all the comics that I've known that have died.

Speaker 2:          00:07:02       Um, by the way, all men,

Speaker 1:          00:07:06       all men out of the 25, they're all meant, so all these women out there like you don't understand how difficult it is to be a woman. It's like, lady, I got 25 dead friends. They're all guys.

Speaker 2:          00:07:17       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:07:18       I don't know what the fuck is going on with us, but whatever you guys are, there's something that you guys, something in your life is easier. I know in this age of feminism where it just has to be, everything is so fucking much harder for a woman. There is one easy thing, one easier thing for a woman and it really is the most important thing and that is staying alive. I wouldn't fuck is my phone. I got them all like I got and I'm, I'm, I'm probably going to forget a few people. All right, let's see here. These are all the fucking people did I knew that had gone here. All right. It all started with Mitch Hedberg in like March I think at 2005. Mitch Hedberg, Freddy Soto, Mitch Malanie, Robert Schimmel, Bernie Mac, Dave Fitzgerald, Kevin Knox, Bob Side Bell, Bob Lazaruth, rich size slur auto from auto and George Greg Giraldo, Patrice O'Neal, Todd Lynn, Sam Brown, Charlie Murphy, Scott Kennedy, John Pinette, Richard Jeni, Mike [inaudible], Fano, Ralphie may and peak coming. Those are all the people that I knew really well or worked with as a comedian then have all died since 2005 separate day. Fitzgerald. He died earlier. He doesn't like 2001. It was a Boston karmic. Um, and I probably forgot a few people,

Speaker 1:          00:08:50       you know, club owners, Manny Dorman, Lucian Hole. And then I have like let's high school kids that I went to school with. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. All guys.

Speaker 3:          00:09:02       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:09:04       Fucking unbelievable. He just don't understand sometimes what it's like to be, I know, I absolutely, I'm sure it's fucking a much more difficult than a lot of ways, but I'll tell you that the most important way, staying alive, that's not, forget that. Um, anyways, uh, so I did the, uh, the new west side comedy club

Speaker 1:          00:09:32       and it was just the perfect layout. And I also love to, it's right around the corner from the, uh, the beacon theater. So, uh, I've gotten to play, there were a couple of times, but what I also love is if I was a young competing starting out, it's really like this motivational thing where you walk out and then you walk around the corner and there's the beacon theater and you can kind of be thinking, you know, Sunday, maybe I'll be able to play that place. That's the type of shit that used to get me. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:10:00       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:10:01       used to get me motivated when I was starting out, although I don't know about playing theaters. I think it was just seeing Caroline's comedy club because when I was starting out, like nobody played theaters. It was like Cosby played theaters. George Carlin like you had to be like a legend. Um, Joan Rivers, um, those people played like theaters

Speaker 3:          00:10:24       and um,

Speaker 1:          00:10:27       you know, for most comedians when I started, I think it was, um, the dream was to just sell out clubs. The dream was to sell out clubs and to get a Sitcom built around your act. Uh, that was the dream. And then somewhere along the line it's switched and a lot of people talk about, you know, social media and Blah Blah and all that. I think the biggest thing that is created, one of the big things that people forget as far as like how all of these comedians now are, are big enough of a draw to play theaters. I think one of the best things that happened for comedians that nobody brings up is Napster.

Speaker 1:          00:11:14       An online file sharing air quote, sharing of music, which was really stealing music that completely destroyed the music business and their ability to make stars. Um, you remember virgin records but you would go in there and they had that little CD listening thing and they had like the top 10 or the top 20 cds and they'd always be like a new band in there. It's like they were feeding, you know, bringing new people in. And once Napster came out and then there was the live wire and all of that shit and then iTunes and all of that, what happened was, um, oh, am I gonna use this term? There was an the development of new, like when you look at like the amount of bands that broke through and like the last 10 years that was suddenly able to sell out arenas. It's like a handful of bands or people like lady Gaga, Bruno Mars was at 21 pilots is very few

Speaker 2:          00:12:13       that got that big.

Speaker 1:          00:12:16       Um, at least not as much as uh, as they used to. I feel my might be completely wrong on this, but if I'm, if I'm not mistaken, there was like, like the MTV music or had like the five, the same five artists for a long time. We're with a few new ones but like, like Jay z Kanye and like, I dunno, I'm not so good with all the, all the youngest people stuff, but they stuck around forever at those music awards because there was not these new people coming in.

Speaker 2:          00:12:50       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:12:51       Usually for somebody to stick around in a music award for over 10 years. I feel like there was only a couple of bands that could do it, but they had to keep those people from 10 years previous cause they all got knocked out. And then I'm going to get to a point here. So everything became a quick little bullshit. I don't want to pay for it online. And I think in everybody went online, either wanted to fucking uh, watch someone do something incredible on a skateboard, some x games, shit. Or you wanted to watch people fail and you wanted to laugh. And I feel like standup comedy fit into that set up punch, set up, punch. It was quick. They made you laugh, you fucking moved on. And then I think comedians slid into all of these theater gigs that were, all of these bands would have been playing.

Speaker 1:          00:13:37       I'm not talking arenas, I just mean like, like theaters. I might be wrong on that one, but I think, um, if you look at the graph as music business imploded, comedy went through the fucking roof. Then also with technology, I'll comics comics could just keep putting out these specials. And then Netflix was another big thing. But everybody talks about that. But nobody seems, I don't know. I think the music business, I'm completely imploding also helped out stand up. It created a void. Um, I don't know. You liked it and you're like me discussing the fee, the INS and outs of ticket sales and standup comedy. So anyways, so I was working at the, uh, west side comedy club. You got to go there. Some old friends of mine opened the place up. That's why I did it. I had the best time. And what was really cool is it mostly, you know, podcasts listeners, so I could say whatever the fuck I thought essentially in these times, you know what I mean? Everything that's going on, you know, I heard like those fucking,

Speaker 2:          00:14:40       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:40       People were going down to the comedy cellar and then writing down what other comics were saying about Louis Ck and all of that type of stuff was just, it's just so fucking, it's such a crazy time. Right. Um, and, uh, you know, I dunno, I love Louis C K and that was really obviously just at fucking hard thing to see happen to somebody. And he was definitely 100% wrong. I'll just say this, he was 100% wrong. He did own up to it and I think he will definitely be back. Um, I will say that, and I also knew a couple of the women that he did the shit too. And I just felt bad for everybody. It's just fucking terrible. And uh,

Speaker 1:          00:15:23       I dunno. I Dunno. I Dunno. What else do you see you say about it? I feel like I'm in a divorce where, you know, both the mom and the dad. You need just, you got to like pick a fucking side here. Uh, you know, I dunno all, I think that just this new thing though is like, like the level of witch hunt that happened when the Louis think came out. Like the amount of fucking people that they went after was just fucking, it was like six degrees of Louise Dick, you know, to the point that even the fucking Huffington post was even trying to like, you know, list people that clients have the same manager that he had and stuff. Food by the way, is one of the great people I've ever met in life. I stand by my fucking manager and I'm never firing the guy. I've been with this guy since 2006 date. Becky's one of the great people that I've met in this business. I love that guy. It's still have him over my house for fucking dinner watching everybody just, Oh, I think I remembered this happening 15 fucking years ago. And then watching everybody tried to burn down this guy's life. It's just fucking predicts people. This is America. You remember due process,

Speaker 1:          00:16:27       like the whole thing, it's just like, it's fucking insane. I wouldn't be surprised if they don't have to. Louis Ck is mailman man saying if you deliver his mail yet part of the problem, um, you know, and it doesn't seem to be like there's any sort of like, you know, when the judicial system where there's like if you steal a bike, you get this sentence. If you rob a bank, you get this. If you kill somebody, if you kill a whole bunch of people all the way up to the death penalty. Yeah. This kind of seems like it's become, um, it doesn't make a difference if it's sexual misconduct all the way to sexual assault slash rape, you know, you're getting the exact same, uh, like level of punishment. Um, so that's only my question. Okay. Out of all of this because he was definitely wrong. Obviously I'm, that means is all obvious shit that I'm saying. But, uh, does the punishment match the crime because you know, sexual misconduct when you talk about sexual misconduct? Like I, I don't, I would, I don't know how many podcast I would have to do to tell you all the stories of sexual misconduct, but just women as a standup comedian who used to go out after his shows, selling his posters all and taking pictures

Speaker 4:          00:17:50       with, to just the fucking women. Okay. And I'll tell you, it was never any of the young ones. It was always these middle age fucking women. Couple of glasses of red wine. Oh God. And they'd come at you with their vulva boom energy and you'd be like, oh no, here we go. You know, that's my advice. Young male comics out there, young female comics is plenty of information out there for you now about watching out for creepy guys. But I don't think there's anything out there for young male comics. I will tell you this, okay. If you're going to go out and meet a crowd afterwards, when middle aged women, you can tell they've had too much wine beyond the fact that they're sort of teetering on their high heels shoes with their old feet sticking out of them, just looked for the great teeth. All right. And a little bit too much makeup and then that, you know, they got the girls out a little bit. Just fucking watch yourself. Okay. Cause that's the, uh, that's the old cheerleader who is not aging well and is freaking out that guys don't find her attractive anymore. And I'm telling you, they're going to come up to you Eric, you know, Covey of junk. That's all I'm going to say.

Speaker 4:          00:19:09       Dude. I hit a woman, licked my neck one time and I'll tell you worst than the touch of her tongue, her old ass, disgusting wine breath tongue on my fucking neck. Worse than that was, I felt her breath right before the eagle landed. I will, uh Oh gee, oh and forget about gay guys. Jesus Christ. I got to do another half podcast on that one. We've, we're just talking about sexual misconduct. Um, I always wanted to rub your chest. The fuck did you just do I remember what time it is. The thing about a guy when it happens to a guy, it's just funny just for the simple fact that, you know, generally speaking, you can overpower whoever the fuck is coming at you. I'm not a, I'm not a little boy, so I get why nobody gives a shit when this happens to a guy.

Speaker 4:          00:20:04       I get it. Um, I remember I was dating this absolutely lovely woman, beautiful woman. She danced on Broadway. She was such a sweet town. I loved him to death and I completely fucked it up cause I was an angry young man. So I'm sorry to her. Right. So she was dancing in this thing called Broadway bears, which was like, they used to do this thing to raise money. It was like a burlesque show. So it wasn't like this creepy titty bar thing. It was just, uh, you know, if you ever go to a burlesque show, which my wife took me to one to see that Dita von Teese. I was just like, are you fucking kidding me? She's going to take me down here to go to go see, basically go to a rated PG 13 strip club. I have the coolest wife ever. And then I got down there and I think I was the only straight guy there and it was like mostly gay guys, right? And uh, that's what this Broadway bears thing was. It, it wasn't like the creepy who'd is five? So it's actually better if there's a bunch of gay dude sick. Cause I always did that whole, I feel like Hooters strip clubs, titty bars and all that shit. It's just like, that's something that's like fascinating when you're like in your 20s I think. And then somewhere, you know, if you're progressing, if you're maturing at some point it just becomes gross. Or at the very least like this is fucking stupid. You know,

Speaker 4:          00:21:29       I want to go out and get laid. I'm going to sit here looking at naked women who aren't going to fuck me. You know, this is stupid while losing a ton of money, paying for watered down drinks went, now I don't want to eat in here. You were in the sex industry, get away from me. I want to order some food. Right? So I go down to this Broadway bears thing right? And, uh, you know, there's all these fucking lyrics, there's all these smoking hot women doing their dances and stuff. And then there's all these shredded dudes. So all the gay guys are going nuts about the dude's. And I'm looking at all these women going like, oh my God. Right. Fucking dance or legs. They were incredible. Right? Oh, by the way, they also were really talented. All right, so the fucking show ends.

Speaker 3:          00:22:13       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:22:14       And I'm waiting for my girlfriend at the time to come out and this fucking out of nowhere, this guy came up and just smack me on the ass. And it wasn't like, like, it was like if you were playing football, it was good game, but at that place it was, it, this guy wanted to fucking hook up me. Dude, he hit me so hard, like I almost fucking got whiplash and I fucking turned around and I can't say what I said to the guy. Um, but I made it clear to him that I wasn't gay and I'll never forget, he just like put his hands up and was like backing away.

Speaker 3:          00:22:46       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:22:46       Edelman where he put his hands up the dude at these fucking guns. And I was just like, you know, I don't know what this guy's thinking right now, but if he wanted to do something, I don't know if there's anything I could do about it and never forget is, is big hairy gay arms just going, Oh, oh, I'm sorry. I just fucking, no, you didn't even talk like that. I'm doing like the hacky gave voice. He had just like a regular dude voice. And um,

Speaker 4:          00:23:14       I'll do, I got a zillion of those fucking zillion of those fucking stories. If we're talking sexual misconduct here. And um, and you know, it's funny is the reason I stopped going out after my shows wasn't all of those fucking witches of Eastwick drunk bitches coming up to me doing God knows what, right. Just crossing all kinds of fucking lines. Like literally like you're a cartoon character. What made me finally stop was that time that guy went to take the camera to take the picture of his girlfriend or wife and a loaded nine millimeter felon. You Proud?

Speaker 2:          00:23:53       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:23:53       And it was right on the ground. And I should have kicked it away. You know, all the episodes is Saskia a hot, shy watched. I did. And I just froze. I pointed at the gun and I went, Dude, what the fuck? And I let them bend down and pick it up and I just stood there. I've never felt more white in my life, you know what I mean? Just classic Culdesac like, Hey, frank d I, I believe you dropped your pistol. Thanks, Bill blows my fucking brains out. Oh, you hear that? That's my alarm. I get up a little early. So anyways, people, I think it's a great thing that all of this stuff is coming out because there's no way that women should have to be tolerating this. They've tolerated it way too long. But can we stop short here of like, um, then trying to literally destroy everybody around the fucking person, um, over social media and no burden of proof whatsoever. These are like real people that you're going after. Okay. You know?

Speaker 2:          00:24:58       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:24:59       These people that are around, these people that have done horrible things, they have wives, they have kids, they have families, they have mortgages. You know, and just to just fucking just Willy Nilly, oh, somebody just said this on Twitter. It has to be true and just pile on and blow on the ashes and try to turn it into fuck a fucking inferno.

Speaker 2:          00:25:20       MMM.

Speaker 4:          00:25:23       It's also not right.

Speaker 2:          00:25:26       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:25:29       And, uh, I feel really bad for my manager and what the hell he's going through right now. I really do.

Speaker 2:          00:25:35       MMM.

Speaker 4:          00:25:36       And I'm not going to be one of these fucking people and I hate how this, this whole fucking day and it don't say anything, man. It's not worth it. Don't say thing. So I'm just going to lead this guy who's been a friend to me for fucking 11 years, guided me through my career. My career went to the fucking stratosphere with this gun. I'm just going to leave them twisting in the wind. Go Fuck Yourself. They, Becky's a great guy.

Speaker 2:          00:25:57       MMM.

Speaker 4:          00:25:59       Anyways, plowing ahead. What do we got here? Uh, but blah, blah, blah. Let's read a little bit. Uh, no, I, you know what I missed? I missed the, I missed a formula one race in it sounded like it was amazing evidence. I don't know how Lewis Hamilton ended up, uh, starting in last place, but he worked his way all the way up to first, which I have never seen somebody must have crashed because, uh, I dunno the way Max for staffing was running during the last race. Once somebody gets out in front, you know, when they're driving through the clean air, there was that little thing I know about aerodynamics and racing. No one can never catch him, so,

Speaker 2:          00:26:39       okay.

Speaker 4:          00:26:39       They must have had a brilliant strategy plus like slash else that was plush plus and slash plash. Um, somebody's car must have broken down or uh, they must've been an accident or something. I have no idea. But, uh, can somebody say, I know you guys have sent me this link before. Can somebody try and find a, or send me the link to where, um, where I can rewatch the races. Um, the replay of him because Brazil is that brand. When did you see fucking the Mercedes Benz team got robbed at gunpoint? Lewis Hamilton wasn't there and, but he's quote was basically, this happens every time we come down here. How bad is that for tourism in Brazil? You know what I mean? Every time we come down here, the Illuminati sport gets fucking robbed.

Speaker 4:          00:27:35       Can we do something about security? Um, you know, thank God. Like, you know, if I was like the president of Brazil, I actually wouldn't be too nervous because Brazil has arguably the most beautiful women in the world down there. You know what I mean? And that will keep people coming despite the fact that even the Mercedes Benz Formula One team gets robbed at gunpoint and they weren't there on vacation. They came down there with the entire sport and somebody still finally got through. I guess when you got a a pistol, you don't really need a laminate. The, uh, can we see her credentials? Yeah. Yeah. Right here buddy. Okay. Lewis Hamilton's over there and I believe he's still has his diamond earring and have added, um, all right, let's read a, let's read some, uh, some advertising here for this week. Southie.

All right, so the f one of the other, uh, two reasons why I'm here in New York. Okay. Reasons. I

Speaker 1:          00:35:37       did the west side comedy club, Bam, a on Saturday night I did a Michael J. Fox is charity, the uh, the Fox Foundation. I did a benefit for them. One of the coolest gigs I've ever got to do in my life. I, uh, I show up, right? First of all, it's Michael J. Fox, right? I mean that guy's comedic timing. You know, like when they say somebody has like a perfect pitch when they go to sing or whatever. I always felt like, you know, grew up watching him on family ties and of course all the back to the future movies. Um, and I just piss, timing was just like, was impeccable. Right. And it may makes it really, really easy. But just as a fan of comedy and everything, I always loved the guy. So I, I realized I was going to get to meet him and I show up to the Gig and I'm always nervous whenever I have to do a benefit cause it's, you know, it's a benefit. People going to be in this, you know, they're going to be in a certain mindset or it's just like, you know, wow, I'm really lucky that you know, I'm healthy, I have my family Blahblahblahblahblah and other, these other people are going through this really difficult thing. These are, there's a sense of like guilt that you feel, um,

Speaker 4:          00:36:55       just all of that type. It just puts the crowd in a certain mood where then all of a sudden they go from laughing to everything that you say is just like, ah,

Speaker 5:          00:37:04       oh boom.

Speaker 4:          00:37:08       You know, those are the sounds. I usually hear it benefits. So I was, I'm always a little apprehensive and in my head I'm sitting there going like, all right,

Speaker 1:          00:37:17       how can I

Speaker 4:          00:37:18       navigate this situation? Cause there's what I want to talk about. And then there's what I should talk about just to get through this. Right? So I show up in the form of the first people I saw was Eugene Mirman who hadn't seen in a while and I was so relieved to see another comedian. I was just like, God, thank God. So we both would just sort of laugh and talking about how, all right, it's a benefit. How is this? What's going to happen? How's this one going to go down?

Speaker 1:          00:37:43       Hopefully this is going to be good. And as I was talking to him, I heard this amazing band playing in the background was like, it sounded so good. I'm like, is that live? That's unreal. But we were back in the green room. I was like, I got to check them out and raised. I went to go out. This guy comes walking up,

Speaker 4:          00:37:58       bye. Goes, hey bill burr. I don't, he was like, ah, you know, uh, you know, I've seen your stuff, man. You funny. I said, oh, thanks a lot. I appreciate it. I got look at you. You're all dressed all sharp. I'm like, are you going up tonight?

Speaker 1:          00:38:10       Uh, he goes, yeah. I go, what do you, what do you do? You

Speaker 4:          00:38:12       meeting? He goes, die. Cause I play a little guitar. You know, I love musicians. I'm like, Holy Shit Man. You play in a band. That's fucking great. Right? It turned out that guy was Brad Paisley. I'm old. I don't know who the kids are. Right. I have no fucking idea. He went on in the end and was one of the greatest annotators I've seen in a long fucking time. Absolutely. Goes, I play a little

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       guitar, right? Shreds. Absolutely shreds on guitar. Amazing voice. I said to him after, cause I felt like an asshole that I didn't know who he was, but I'm also, I'm old. You know what I mean? We 50 next year, right? I loved, and I'm loving turning 50 now. This is when you start to have excuses. I'm 50, I don't know things. Um, I said to him, I said, you know, I love about you country guys. All you guys, he can play. You know, I'm not into all the country music, but they can, they can fucking play and they can sing. And it reminds me of hair metal. As much as people trashed me for listening to that, those guys could play and they could sing. They could, they could do it live. We'll do it. Lie, fuck it. Right? So anyways, I'm hearing all this band.

Speaker 1:          00:39:21       So I, uh, I go, I gotta go check these guys out, right? I have to like the third song or it's, so I go to walk out there to see the, um, to see the band playing and I looked at it and I'm looking at the drummer, this is giant like, you know, banquet hall room and I'm just looking at the drama and I just fucking staring at him for like five seconds. It disbelief. And I look at the woman next to me who was working for the foundation. I was like, is that Steve Jordan? She goes, yeah. He's like really good. I'm like, really good. He's one of the greatest fucking drummers of all time. This is like a bucket list for me to ever see this guy play live. I can't believe I couldn't believe it. My jaw was on the ground. Like you got to understand like I, I been listening to Steve Jordan's since like, I guess when I first started watching Letterman and I didn't even realize at that point that he played on those blues brothers albums.

Speaker 1:          00:40:15       Then I discovered those, I even bought the second blues brothers album made in America. Then nobody bought. I have all of that shit. All of his Keith Richards, expensive wine. Oh Shit. I watched him on the leg with the Letterman band. Um, I go on youtube, there's a fusion album that he put out the fuck was the name of that band that you can't, I can't find the album anywhere where he's really young. Um, playing on, on that one a way busier than he plays on a lot of other stuff. Right. Through all the John Mayer stuff. And I was always thinking, okay, when John Mayer comes to town with his trio, I'm definitely gonna go see that. And I'll finally get to see Steve Jordan playing live, you know, switching out the snares and all of that, that whole, all that whole fits his whole thing that he does that it's just so incredible.

Speaker 1:          00:41:00       But every time John Mayor would come to la, I would always be on the road and I'd always miss it. So I actually got to see him play. And, um, so anyways, I'm sitting there and at the banquet thing and I meet Michael J. Fox and he's just like the nicest guy ever. Him and his wife, just a couple of sweethearts, you know. Well just one of those amazing couples too, you know, both good looking people and then they, they formed, when they get together they form an even more amazing person, you know? And I'm, I'm sitting there and like, I'm literally nervous. Like I'm a brand new comic. Whenever I get to one of, I do benefits, I get like that nervous cause like I've, I've had some that have not gone well. I've done some Christmas parties. The reason why I don't do Christmas parties, I don't do private gigs, you know, which are basically rich people or rich companies or something. Uh, get to yeah, gather and they will literally hire anyone from like fucking you too, all the way down to some no name comic. Like I was back when I used to do those fucking things and you would go up there and nobody would know that there was a show. And the last one I did.

Speaker 3:          00:42:12       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:42:13       Like they had me go up. It was in like a restaurant. These people had rented out the restaurant and everybody was eating and talking and I went up there and I was, no one was listening and I got defensive. So my already angry material back then. It was coming off even angrier and people just literally stopped eating or just sort of staring down at their plates. And um,

Speaker 1:          00:42:39       I tried every trick that I knew in the book to turn it around and I couldn't do it and I just fucking bombed. I ruined their dinner. I ruined, they're not at least that part of it. And I just walked out of there with my age and at the time, and God bless him, he had to listen to me, walked 12 blocks with them, with absolutely absolute Tourette's, just going like, I am never fucking doing one of those fucking things again. Who the fuck bring somebody up when everybody's fucking [inaudible] like I did that. I was going, Casey case him and I suppose to go on and talk about a fucker dog dying, right. I went into that mode, you know, but by the end, after 12 blocks, I, by the end of it, we were both laughing and I was just like, should we given them money back? You know, that was like, fuck, I feel bad, but this is a real reason why I was flipping out. You know, I was embarrassed. And then I also felt like I stole money cause I just wasn't, I wasn't the guy for that Gig. It should have been like somebody like a who was happy with themselves.

Speaker 1:          00:43:49       All right. So anyways, let's get on with the, uh, not off. I'll finish telling the story. So anyways, uh, fortunately the great Dennis leary was, was hosting this event and he went up and immediately turned it into a comedy show. You know, he was up there doing what he does and he dropped, you know, a couple of f bombs. And then with every joke he told, I got more and more and more and more relaxed. And I was like, ah, thank God. And then, uh, I went up on stage and I just, I just fucking went off and, uh, told all these, I just, I dunno, I, I did all those stories telling all those fucking stories of all the shit that women have done to me. And at first people didn't want to laugh and then they just started laugh. Cause you know, sexual misconduct, like I said to a guy, I'm, I'm, and I'm agreeing with this. It's kind of funny. It's not right, but it is, it's funny.

Speaker 2:          00:44:45       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:44:47       And at first they were like, what the fuck? And then they just sort of went with it and then all the rest of my shit just flowed. And I ended up having one of my favorite sets I've had in such a long time. And then in the end I got to watch, uh, this new great musician that I did, wasn't aware of Brad Paisley playing with Steve Jordan's band. And um, and then in the end they brought Michael J. Fox out and they all played Johnny be good. I mean, it was just, it was, I was, I was just standing there like going, how the fuck is this? My life was amazing. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:45:23       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:45:23       Then I just end up having, then it just turned out it was also the New York comedy festival. So all these guys were in town. I got to run into Brant. Brian Regan who just played Carnegie Hall hanging out with him. I just had like the best, I had the best fucking night and uh, and the Great New York run here continues where tomorrow I'm going to be on inside the NFL. I don't know what I'm going to be talking about. A God knows. I haven't watched nearly as much NFL football is, I would have liked this year. I just got so busy with the cartoon and my little acting Gig there. Oh, Bill, what do you think? You're an actor now. Every once in a while I am. Um, all right, my screen went dark here. Let's type in the fucking pass where the password. Uh, all right, let's, uh, let's read some of your questions here.

Speaker 1:          00:46:07       All right. Not enough women or gays at the cellar table. Oh boy. Here we go. Oh, read Dick, Billy. All that controversy in stand standup comedy. He goes, I was hoping to get your take on an article I came across on Facebook called tear down the boys club that protected Louis Ck. That's that witch hunt thing that I'm saying like we had fucking meetings every week. All right, what are we going to do here is, hey mom, I'm going to find rrr, you know, and how everybody else, the second that God, evidently everybody else on the other side, the second that Gawker, uh, article came out, you know, immediately took a criminal justice course and just became some gum shoe and went out and bought a giant magnifying glass and walked around looking for clues. All right. It's written by a gay comic who figures basically going after Louis wasn't enough. So he is trying to go after his peers also. Yeah, the witch hunt, uh, the author cries about a certain table at the comedy cellar where elite comics like Chris Rock and Jerry Seinfeld sit. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:47:10       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:47:11       Like when the table came about, by the way, Jerry Seinfeld was still doing Seinfeld, you know what I mean? I don't know if they actually had a place called the table. Uh, when I first started going to the comedy cellar, there wasn't a table. Comics just went upstairs and they sat all over the place. And I am convinced

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       that the reason why the table was started was because of Patrice, because portrays was so loud and so funny and he was just all over the upstairs. They were trying to somehow contain him. He was like, Jordan, you know, you're not going to stop him. Let's just see if we can contain them. So I think they just tried to get us all in, sit at, sit it in one seated in one area so they could at least be like, okay, sit down and fold your fucking hands and listen to the teacher. Right. Um, that's how I remember it. Anyway, so he goes, he also has never even tried to perform it. The Co at the cellar himself, it's kind of like a fourth grader crying to the teacher because the cool kids won't hang out with him. The article implies that by not speaking up about it, the seller comics were somehow protecting Louis even though they were just rumors until recently.

Speaker 4:          00:48:23       Also the owner of the cellar, where are we fucking scream at dark? Sorry, I'll see you on his salary. He had some great things to say in the comments. Here's the link to the article and go fuck yourself. Yeah, I read it. And um, you know, to be honest with you, considering this guy's also a fellow comedian, I feel bad that that was his perception. I feel filled up yet that that was his perception of what the table was because um, you know, the table was like, uh, I didn't even know how to explain it. Like that was something like the level of pounding that you had to take. You had to go there and just basically get ripped to shreds and then what everybody at the table wanted to do. And it wasn't even, it wasn't doing it to just be mean. It was just, I don't, it was just this comedian thing.

Speaker 4:          00:49:18       So you'd sit down and like you already, you'd sit down with like whatever you were hung up about with yourself and they would give another 40 things about you physically that you didn't even notice that you should also be self conscious about. However, in the end, all they wanted you to do was come back at them and trash them back. And if you did urn regardless, all right. And there was some epic fucking back and forths at that table. You know, people definitely got mad sometimes, but, uh, the table wasn't like what a lot of people who didn't go to it think it was like this big bullying thing. It was also this amazing thing where like, uh, I listened to Jewish people and Arab comics going at it, talking about the Middle East. I'd listened to Patrice and, uh, you know, Manny dorming, um, their debates, Colin Quinn was there and if I remember correctly, tough crowd came out of those conversations at the table. And if you watched tough crowd, it'd be these comedians talking about these deep issues trashing each other. And um, I always felt this, that the table was inclusive. As long as you are willing, you had to, he had to fucking walk the gauntlet. You just had to fucking do and you had to survive it.

Speaker 2:          00:50:42       MMM.

Speaker 4:          00:50:45       And then if you did, you actually became a better comedian because once you got in at the table, then there was this thing, you could not sit at the table. You'd come in and be, hey, bill, come when they wanted you to sit at the table because they wanted you to trash you. And then they also wanted you to trash him back. But you know, I wasn't even part of the elite crew. I wasn't funny enough, I just wasn't like the, the, the, as far as, this is just my, my perception of it was the table was Patrice Norton Voss, Keith Robinson, Collin Quinn,

Speaker 4:          00:51:23       and later on, Kevin Hart, Kevin Hart. Right. And even he was sort of like a, just like a rookie. But he also made it so fast. He didn't have time to fucking stay there. So, um, those were the, that was like the Mount Rushmore of the table and when you showed up and they will all there and somebody had something on you like that time, you know, I for 24 hours said I would do the stand up on a bus on the weight of a world series game to get a world series ticket. And I never even ended up doing the Gig. I took a headlining set pounding that is still legendary. They told the fucking story on Opie and Anthony, I believe Kevin Hart and them all told the story, man, I got fucking destroyed, destroyed. So this guy like suggesting that it was all, like everybody was like, there was this team of people, it wasn't, it was fucking cannibalistic. All right. Everything that they said, an opening, Anthea was 100% true except for the fact that I did the Gig because I didn't do the Gig. I actually gave the Gig to somebody else and I w with a vow of silence. I said, I will never tell anybody that you did this gig because I don't want you to go through what I just went through.

Speaker 2:          00:52:35       MMM.

Speaker 4:          00:52:38       I think the guy who did the Gig actually might've said that he was the one who did the Gig all these years later. But I still had them not saying shit who it was. So anyways, once you got in at the table, then you would go downstairs to go do your set and one night they, everybody at the table be like, you know what, we're watching your set tonight. And you'd be like, Oh fuck. And you would go downstairs, you'd go on stage and the crowd couldn't see all these fucking asshole comics. I remember they'd all be backlit standing in the hallway. Patrice is big, dumb, stupid head. And you'd have to go up there and like just commit to your jokes as they were all standing there making faces of disgust, heckling, making noises. And one time I told a joke and it went good. And as I was telling the joke, I had the nerve to actually try to say something.

Speaker 4:          00:53:27       Image, Joe and Patrice were just go, just do that fucking noise and then they would all crack up laughing. Then the crowd would laugh like what the fuck and get a sense of like other comics are laughing at this guy. Should we be laughing at him and not respect him as a human being? And then you would just start bombing and I never forget. I remember Kevin Hart went down stairs and he went up as a 20 year old comic and survived it and was barely affected. I mean, I know and then looking at all the stuff that he's doing now, like you really saw what he was made up. It was a great thing. The seller table is not what this person perceived it to be and I feel bad that that person, because having a fed Gig, I'd comic, that would have been great. They would've been a whole other angle. It was actually a really inclusive thing. It's just a lot of people weren't tough enough to get through it and that's the truth. And it took me, like I said, like a half dozen attempts because I was not a mentally strong person back then. And um, but if you see what came out of it, Colin Quinn's tough crowd, that was one of the most inclusive shows of all time as far as like, he gave

Speaker 4:          00:54:37       almost like two and a half generations of standup comics, a TV credit, a lot of them, their first TV credit. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:54:44       MMM.

Speaker 4:          00:54:46       So I dunno what, I'm not, what someone's going to sit down and watch tough probably who's mainly white males will blah, blah, blah, Blah and all that fucking shit. So I don't know that there's no way to win this type of stuff, but um, I can tell you that I, I don't agree with this person's perception of it, but I don't have any anger towards that person for writing that if that's what they feel, think it was. But, uh, it's a little melodramatic burn the table down like this, these meetings going on and we're all sitting there trying to hold back his, his career or whatever. I mean I don't, I don't fucking all I remember as far as like Trans Comics, I just remembered there was, I don't know what the proper term was, but there was a guy who dresses like a woman who went on stage and went by the name. She went by the name of Sharon needles.

Speaker 2:          00:55:33       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:55:33       And she used to go up at the Boston comedy club and she was fucking hilarious. And last time I looked her up, I believe she was still doing shows. I think she just got out of the standup scene. But nobody, I don't know. There's no comics going, girl, what the fuck is his fucking person doing here? Like this all comic, Oh, comedy is is if you're fucking funny. Other comics that are going to laugh and you get their respect and you're in.

Speaker 2:          00:55:59       MMM.

Speaker 4:          00:56:02       Uh, you know, everybody has a different fucking road, but everybody's just sitting there going like, just, I dunno what, what there, it's, everybody's looking out their own head and it becomes, their experience is fact in truth in anybody else's experience is bullshit or something like that. So all I'm doing here is I'm telling my of, that's how I perceived it. And, um, I just remember for the longest time, like we would, I'm a one night we fucking were outside the comedy cellar. We trashed each other for so fucking long. And it was so god damn funny, it was so late in the night that this woman in an apartment above the comedy cellar poured water down onto us to get us to shut the fuck up. And uh, going back, you know, like a lot of moments like that in life. I wish I could have, um,

Speaker 3:          00:57:01       yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:57:02       I wish I could have realized how amazing that was during that time. Cause that's as far as I was concerned, that table, this, this table that this guy wants to burn down that died. The table died when Manny died because he was the creator of it. And, um, he was the, one of the great conversationalists that I ever met and he was so God damn funny. And um,

Speaker 3:          00:57:31       okay.

Speaker 4:          00:57:32       And what I loved about him was he wasn't a malicious guy as much as I got, I used to fucking argue with that guy. You know what I mean? I was just, I was a young, angry man and I used to argue with that guy and, and he was always the next day it was always over. And I actually kind of learned from him, I learned from him and Bobby Kelly how to squash in argument where like how you'd be like the next day just, you know, cause I didn't grow up in a family like that. It was just basically you didn't talk about it and then you didn't talk for three days and then fucking four days later you say, hey, you see the soldiers giving was it was good, good. And then everything was lingering. Um, those two people, I learned how to have a functional end to an argument.

Speaker 4:          00:58:11       So, um, yeah, I don't know what that shits about, but it's unfortunate that that person feels that way about it, but you know, everybody's entitled to their opinion. All right. Uh, portrays a Billy Ray, no fun. Um, after hearing you along with so many other comics universe, three Lord Patrice, I finally watched elephant in the room special. Uh, within minutes he had me in stitches. It's so easy to see why he was so revered within the comedy community. I know you hold him both as a comedian, as a person, the person, and an incredibly high regard. I would love to hear some of your insight into him. I recently heard that he was permanently banned from performing at the stand in New York. What was that about? No, he was never banned from the stand. The stand, the stand came out or opened right around when Patrice got sick. Um, he wasn't banned from there anyways, really big fan of the show and we'd love to see come to Australia against soon. Um, yeah, know Patrice, Patrice was getting banned from comedy clubs all the time.

Speaker 4:          00:59:16       All the time, but he was so fucking good. They had to let them back get, uh, it reminds of when I read this, this miles Davis book, and he was talking about Charlie Parker and when he would party to much in pawn his horn and these clubs would kick him out, data eventually have to fucking bring them back in because he was the best and Patrice was the best and you know, as much as he would drive him nuts, you wanted them around, you wanted them around you. It's like the, like the comedy dropped by 40%, even with all the other comics still going there if he wasn't there and just the fun. And then they also knew that if they banned him that none of the comics were going to hang out at the clubs. We were all going to go to where he was. Um, yeah. So then they would let them back into the club.

Speaker 3:          01:00:06       Okay

Speaker 4:          01:00:06       then, then they created the table. That's, that's how I remember it. That's how I thought that they let's, we'll have 'em all these fucking lunatics just have him sit in the back at the goddamn table. So then we was sitting down and it's just, you know, it was just a bunch of dogs in a fucking pit. And then that's how the trash in the trash, it was already happening.

Speaker 3:          01:00:26       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:00:27       Ama One night, you know, after I took the pound in for fucking the bus Gig that I never even did. I remember when Bobby first shaved his head, he came in and I always respected him for this. He came in, he had like a hat on and he sat down right at the far end of the fat gay Guy Comic here, listen to this story. He didn't shy away from the table. He fucking walked right in, sat down, took his hat off and looked at everybody like, all right, give it to me. Let's hear it. And fucking everybody just, it was like a def jam. Betty took his hat off and everybody does. Ma, we went the fuck. He took this fucking pounding and everyone was getting him and he was just sitting there taking it, laughing and all that type of stuff. And I actually thought he looked good with a shaved head. Right. And, um, what's his face? Uh, I, Oh, who sent it? I think it was SDSD finally got him with one.

Speaker 4:          01:01:26       I think she said, you look like David Wells. I think that that's what she said. And everybody fucking died left. And Bobby literally just stood up and just walked out. And I remember thinking like, I didn't know you could do that. I don't know. You can block out. I saw Keith Robinson do that one time too. We would trash in his clothes, so fucking bed. It was gay. And he was trying to fight back and he was just feeling that way, was going to crash over him. He just fucking ran out the door, got in his car and drove home to Jersey. We kept texting him and calling him go, and you can't do that. You can't do that. He was like, Oh yeah. Well, I just did stupid. Fucking hung up on us, laughed and hung up on us. Um,

Speaker 4:          01:02:15       oh my God. I remember that fucking time Patrice. You know, somehow we found out he, he, he was home on a Saturday night. He just took like a night off. And, uh, Jim Norton fucking came in and said, you know what Patrice has right now? He said home on a Saturday night and they all call them up and on speakerphone, Patrice just picks up and he's like, hello. And Jim's like, what the fuck are you doing home on a Saturday night? You don't have any gigs? And Patrice just fucking roared laughing. And we all over speakerphone, trashed him. He was at home getting trashed at the table. And I just remember him lie. He loved every fucking second of it. It was at the tables. One of the great things ever. So, you know, don't listen to that guy. All right. I lied to my girlfriend. Um, all right.

Speaker 4:          01:03:05       I lied to my girlfriend. Hey Bill. I really could use some advice. Right now I'm an 18 year old male and I have been with this girl for seven months now. I really care about her and she makes me truly happy. About a year ago, I used to smoke weed and do some drugs, other drugs, a lot. Uh, I used to smoke about three or four times a week, but I quit a little under a year ago. My girlfriend is really against drug use and has told me that she would leave me if I ever did it again. Well, a couple of months ago, me and my girl were kind of on a break, not because we don't want to be with each other, but because of some other shit going on in our lives. All right. That's pretty vague. A while we were on this break, I smoked some weed with a buddy of mine.

Speaker 4:          01:03:46       Um, I really regret doing so because I know how this is, this means a lot to her. Um, she is later asked me when was the last time I did any drugs and I just lied and told her the last time was when I told her I quit. I can't stop thinking about this and I feel really bad about lying to her, but I am afraid she's going to leave me or stop trusting me if I tell her now, since I had already lied about it several times in the past. Um, all right. What do you do here? Uh, just to what you wanted to. All right. If you can't live with it, I would tell her, if not, I mean, you fucking smoke. You took a hit off a joint. If you're not going to, she really committed and you're not going to do it again.

Speaker 4:          01:04:31       Is it really worth putting you in her through this? It's kind of hard for me to give you advice here cause I don't know what you broke up for. I mean, you did it while you were broken up. It's not like you went out and you bang some other woman, you just went out and you just tuck your head and you didn't fucking do it again. Um, and you know, that's it. But at the end of the day, you know something, if you come clean and she's still breaks up with the over that, then you know what fucker she gives. She can't accept you. It's not like you went out and you started using heroin and you stole all the money out of her fucking purse. She can't handle one hit of a joint and then you feel bad about it. And he can't even lie to her about it without feeling terrible and that you have to tell her, but she did you tell her that the reason why you didn't tell her because you care about her and you didn't want to lose her. If she still leaves you after that, then you know she was going to find something. Right. Okay. Jim Girl, uh, you know something. I don't know if I have time to read all of these. I, I gotta I gotta fucking get Outta here. Here. Oh, do you? Okay. This is the worst thing ever. I'm going to try to read this quickly. I already read bad when I'm reading

Speaker 4:          01:05:36       at a normal pace here. Hey, Billy, cue ball. A couple of months back, I started going to another gym, a town over for a change of scenery. Uh, after a couple of weeks I've run into this tall athletic girl. She didn't talk to anyone and had that, I'm not trying to talk to anyone. Look going on because of this, me and virtually.

Speaker 3:          01:05:53       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:05:53       Because of what? Because of this and me virtually never cold approaching a girl before I left her alone over the next few weeks. I noticed she would be in my area a lot. And when moving between exercises, we would cross paths a lot. Uh, sounds like you're doing that fucking whatever that workout is. Crossfit. Well, you got to run down the street. You know, look at us, everybody, we're working out. Hey, look at us, you know, leaving your gym and running around and fucking seven 11 parking lot in coming back. We get it. You're working out. Jesus Christ. All right. Over the next few weeks I noticed she would be in my area a lot and when, all right, I already said that. Okay. Uh, we cross path. All right. So, um, I said fuck it. And started talking to her. We had a couple of good compost and I eventually got a number.

Speaker 4:          01:06:42       Look at you. You're in the game. We didn't text much, which is fine because I've learned that texting should be mainly for planning meetups. I still try to a couple of texts Convault's for some rapport since uh, I'd only seen it one to three times a week, sometimes just in passing. Now the issue is every time I messaged her, she randomly stops messaging. No, probably cause you're bugging her at that point, no matter how good the conversation was going or she's busy. Uh, I didn't see her for a week before I left for vacation for another two weeks and no contact. It's been a week since I've been back and I haven't seen her in the gym. Was marginally interested.

Speaker 4:          01:07:23       Well she marginally interested or did I not come on strong enough? Should I text her again? Oh, just move on and wait til I see her again. Well, if you're still into or just Texas, just say, Hey, I haven't seen yet the gym and with the voice, the harm in that, you know, in this day and age, you know, make sure there's a lawyer there when you're doing that because who knows with the, uh, the, the, what the next fucking thing is going to be. Um, yeah, I would just, I would text her and just say, hey, you know, back, you know, would you like to go out sometime? Gives a fuck, fuck her and our cold fucking vibe. Just say what you want to do. Anything she wants to do it. Go do it. If she doesn't move on, that's it. Easy one. All right. But I wouldn't question yourself, you know, fuck all that. Don't be in your head. Um, be like Jon Favreau in swingers. You know, that's what I always think. Just never get into that fucking mode.

Speaker 4:          01:08:21       Just, uh, you know, it's normal to be nervous. Both men and women when you're dating or whatever, men and men, women and women, everybody included. Um, whenever you get into that, I would say don't ever send a text when you were in that mode. I would sit down, relax, and just think, what do I want? I want to go on a date with this person. Well, that's what you ask them. I would love to take you out sometime. See me a minute. I'd love to take you out sometime. Right? That's it. What's she going to say? How dare you fucking ask me out. She's either going to say yes or no. Okay. And if she says no, who gives a fuck? You don't have any regret your asked, but if you don't ask, then you got to be like, all right, for some gone wrong. This is the last one and I'm done.

Speaker 4:          01:09:09       I recently visited my friend at his big time college for his schools. Right. School rivalry weekend. Um, I'm going big. Damn. That's what they said when I went to Notre Dame versus a USC and they were like big time college football. Uh, speaking of, uh, Notre Dame got a big Tam ass kicking against Miami. Holy Shit. The convicts kicking the shit out of the fucking, I like are they still called the Catholics and not the pedophiles? You know what I mean? I mean, not everybody at the University of Miami, you know, has gone to jail or been arrested. Okay. But if you're going to call him convicts and we got damaged, but you gotta go pedophile with Notre Dame. Right. Um, it was a great tam and his school was one school, one in at the last second and at the last second. So the atmosphere is crazy. Later that night, I attended a party at the fraternity. He is a member of a anyway, wage. We meet these two girls and decided to tell him we were actually real real life brothers and we somehow tricked slash convinced these girls into having a foursome. How do you tell them that you're related and that they want to do it?

Speaker 3:          01:10:21       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:10:21       Tricked is a very dangerous world word to use right now, buddy. Uh, all right, we all go into this room.

Speaker 4:          01:10:33       What do you mean trick? What do you do? Did you do the old quarter? Hey, we'll make a quarter disappear. Hey, where's the quarter as a blind you here? Here's my Dick. Uh, we all go into his room and start hooking up and since he had a large bed, we had girls on it and we're banging them side by side, doggy style after what seemed like a while, but was probably six minutes. I unfortunately released my champagne and victory. So now it's my buddy and both the girls in the bed and I'm just in the corner of the room. I really wanted to come back in there,

Speaker 4:          01:11:05       but I knew it would take a little bit of time to get back up. So I decided to look for something to use to start jerking off. Oh. I found out where it turned out to be my buddy's context solution and applied it and started tugging. After a few minutes, Olympic tugging, I started to feel movement and thought I'd be back in the game. Soup. You're like an injured player that went out for a play at that ball moment, my buddy and the two chicks, so he was nailing turn around and face me and catch me jerking off. From their perspective. They think of jerking off to them. Oh, now when in reality I'm jerking is so I can bang the second girl, one girl sort of freaks out.

Speaker 3:          01:11:47       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:11:48       I love that she freaks out if they have to fucking thinking that she's having a fucking force him with two brothers. One girl sort of freaks out and my buddy screams, what the hell are you doing?

Speaker 3:          01:11:59       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:11:59       At that point I didn't know what to say. So I ran out of the room naked and just stood outside the door until they finished. Eventually the girls left and my buddies let my buddy let me back into the room where he proceeded to ask why I was jerking off to him. Oh No. He goes, I tried to plead my case and give rash and give a rational explanation. But he's continuing to be persistent that I was jerking off to him and now he's being extremely distant from me and is told all of our friends who have constantly been berating me for jerking off while my buddy bank two chicks. Do you have any advice on how I can somehow spin this story? I mean, at the end of the day I did get laid to, um, all right, here's what's hilarious about on it that the woman gets offended. Like, what are you doing? It's like, what are you doing? You're having like a fucking force them with two people that you think are related. Uh, and secondly, I don't know how guys do that. I don't know how you could bang a woman with your buddy next to you. Oh, so banging, you know what I mean? Like how do you block out the sound of your friend? Like, Eh, right next to you. I mean, do you look at each other at any point and like how do you not start fucking laughing? I, I don't, I've never understood that. Uh, yeah, you probably should have gone into the bathroom.

Speaker 4:          01:13:19       You probably shouldn't have been looking at them. I mean, do what you have here is a fucking hilarious story. And I, you know, in the spirit of the table.

Speaker 3:          01:13:31       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:13:32       All right. When your friends are giving you shit, I would just laugh. You just have to learn to laugh at yourself and just be like, I swear to God, I was trying to get back in the fucking game. Just tell the story the way you just told it to me and think that it's fucking hilarious that this dude thinks she would jerk it off to him. I would just laugh it off. Um, which is how you get out of most shit. You know, it's how Donald Trump became president. He just, it's probably a bad guy to bring up who's out there grabbing pussies. It'd be like you said all this shit about women. No, I, I said it about Rosie O'donnell. Ah, well you said about other women too and he's like, yeah, you probably right. It ends it, it's when you keep fighting it. I would just fucking laugh it off.

Speaker 4:          01:14:20       I know it's tough at your age, but listen dude, if you have it in you to fucking fuck a woman right next to your friend, if you, if you have the focus to do that, I think he can get through this. Um, but dude, you got it. One hell of a goddamn story. That's a great story. Um, so anyways, all right, that's it. I have to, I've got to get on with my day here and thanks to everybody, uh, who's listened to the podcast. Thanks to the Fox Foundation, the west side comedy club. Please go. Please go out to the kind of club and thanks to everybody on front runner, uh, that, let me have a quick little part in that thing. I had such a great time. Oh, and by the way, guess what's out daddy's home part too. I was in part one. You got his part too, I heard is even better. Joe Barton, Nick Rosebowl tailgate legend told me he went to go see, they said, dude, I fucking laughed out loud like 25 times. Comedians don't laugh out loud ever. It's one of the, one of the fucking, I dunno, it's one of the prices you pay as a comedian. You stopped laughing. You just start going, oh, that was funny. But you never laugh. You never laugh again. So definitely go check that out. And uh, who knows? Who knows? Maybe you'll see a familiar face and there, all right, go fuck yourselves. I'll check in on you on Thursday.
