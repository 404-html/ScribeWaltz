Speaker 2:          00:03:34       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:03:35       Like an iPod. What were you supposed to call it?

Speaker 2:          00:03:38       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:39       A little stereo. I don't fucking know. Right. I understand those words. I just hate when new fucking words come around and then everybody just starts fucking saying them. It drives me up the fucking wall. Especially like on Twitter when there's the new uh, or Instagram.

Speaker 2:          00:03:59       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:00       And, and they just come when they go, remember the for a while, like when you posted something, someone will just go this, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:04:10       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:04:10       And then with what? Some other, that's stupid shit out there. I can't fucking stand. Just drives me up. It's so fucking under rich. I just had somebody give me shit saying something I tweeted wasn't funny and they used the Gif. It's, and I brought the guy back. At least I'm fucking right in my own jokes. You're fucking hack. Someone had to like fucking think of a funny response to my unfunny joke for you with a little video on it. And now you feel like you're clever. I just drives me. What the fuck, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:04:42       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:43       I just got back into working out. Right. Fucking if I hear one more fucking young, cause I got those, those TRX bands.

Speaker 2:          00:04:51       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:04:51       All right. If I hear one more dose, tell me that I'm engaging my core. He made working my abs. You fake Tan cunt.

Speaker 2:          00:05:01       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:05:02       And what's great about these is you're always a little off balance. You're always engaging your core, you know, board a plane anymore. You expedite the boarding process. Step back like you got to do great. You're fucking waitress. Um, do you guys get that? Put your jackets to the overhead required me to, we can expedite the boarding. Bragg says, do you want to sound like you have a fucking law degree? You're on here for one fucking reason only and that's cheap airfare. Stop acting like it was a dream. I like to travel.

Speaker 2:          00:05:40       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:05:40       I like to wear a uniform.

Speaker 2:          00:05:43       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:05:43       I like to expedite the boarding process while engaging my core. This.

Speaker 2:          00:05:49       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:05:50       Hashtag shaking my head yes. You fucking Twitter of question. How Times have you hashtag shaking my head and you actually were shaking your head.

Speaker 2:          00:06:05       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:06:06       Okay. I'm trying to think. Last time I fucking shook my head and I should probably do it a lot. It's fun when I try to keep my, my fucking cool. I'm driving is fucking guy. Oh my God. These fucking assholes out here on, on the highways. The way they pass you on the right hand side, it's unbelievable. You can get into the left lane doing like 40 miles an hour. You, you, you want to get off the highway, you got to be doing like 120 and you watch them pass, you can do an 80, and you look in their lane and there's a guy a quarter mile away and they're going to have to stop on the fucking brakes. I think it's just psychologically psychological outta here that, that, that there's so much traffic that you just think to yourself like, you know, anytime there's an open space, you're like, ah, you just fucking Florida. Well maybe I'm just that dose shoe has like the baby on board sign in his head. I have no idea. Um, but speaking of cars, my latest obsession, but I was going to buy a car right now. All right? If I was a single man, if I didn't have a child, if I had a full head of hair to flow in the breeze, I would get the Porsche Targa the fast one.

Speaker 1:          00:07:15       All right. In lava orange, she just liked my pubes. Um, because I am a child of the 70s, and she remember that Shit in Boogie nights when Philip Seymour Hoffman rest his soul, he's talking to mark Wahlberg's character. Any, any says how the corvette is in a competition? Orange. That was my favorite fucking detail.

Speaker 2:          00:07:41       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:07:41       Uh, seventies detail competition orange. Oh, he didn't wait. He didn't have one. He had the, he had a, uh, oh no. Mark Wahlberg's character got the corvette and competition orange and then Philip Seymour Hoffman showed up with like a Datsun two 40 z or something. Still a decent car. Right. Um, but it's, it's no corvette. Um, anyways, I got to see what that looks like is, I hope it's not a red orange. I'd want an orange, orange. You know, there's a lot of things right now it's just like, I don't know, everybody's got to start fucking with the colors, but that thing, and it's got the automatic fucking a rooftop. It was actually Porsche enthusiasts who are engaging their core when they press the fucking send button on the youtube comment. We're complaining actually complaining. The old one you did. You had to, you had to do it by hand and then fold up the cloth top and then put it in the bonnet is, they say overseas, put it under the fucking hood. Now this one, you just push a button.

Speaker 2:          00:08:52       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:53       The backend lifts up a little bit and then the top fucking goes down like the ED. It's, it's, it's a fucking work of art and there's all these cuts, right? And like, ah, leave it to the Germans to take something really simple and make it a fucking what? Make it fucking perfect.

Speaker 2:          00:09:07       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:09:08       Someone's like going, I would be concerned if I, there were so many could, but behind me, I mean, that comes a good two feet up behind the car. Well, they fucking pull up the tires, do one rotation and then push your button. I'm amazed that when they designed this, are you amazed the fuck are you ever designed? Oh, why am I in such a mood? You know what? I just, I had a bad night's sleep. I had this dream that I was, I was playing the Wilma theater in Boston, Massachusetts. One of my favorite promoters out there, Bill Bloom and Reich, he was in my dream and he was talking the way right.

Speaker 6:          00:09:51       Talks to him. Right Bro? I saw that article I wrote about your word. You, you're really shared some mean things about mers.

Speaker 1:          00:09:58       I was like, are we talking about, I would never say mean things about you. I love you.

Speaker 6:          00:10:01       No, just kind of car came off a little mean.

Speaker 1:          00:10:06       So I felt like an asshole. Like however I was joking about him, somebody it came off his fucking main site, apologized to him and then I go out on stage.

Speaker 2:          00:10:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:17       This was a stress dream cause I hadn't been on stage in like five fucking days. Uh, and I got this European tour coming up. So I just booked myself with the comedy store starting last night, right through Sunday. Just going to do as much stage time as I can. And I had a great set last night. I Dunno. It's just, I think, uh, you know, I just know I got a fucking, I needed to do all these nights and then I'll then I'll be fine when I go to Europe, but whatever.

Speaker 2:          00:10:44       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:10:45       So I go out on stage in my dream on the Wilbur theater and if for some reason it's like six stories in the air, six stories up, and there's people way down below who clearly can't see me. And I feel like I have to walk to the edge of the stage, but I don't want to fall down and I'm making fun of it and nobody's laughing. I'm just bombing. And for some reason I'm on eye level, um, with the six story balcony level and they're just staring at me and I'm not doing well.

Speaker 2:          00:11:18       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:11:18       And then halfway through my set and there's all these obstructions to like, I'm walking and all of a sudden I'm like behind some giant pole and nobody's laughing. And I'm like, oh my God, what the fuck am I doing? And at one point I was laying down on the stage crawling towards the edge because it was also really dark. And I couldn't see how deep it went down. I dropped the Mike down there, somebody turned on a record player and I shut it off. And it was just like, hey, slowed down. Wasn't that song? I don't know why I just picked that. Maybe cause I'm a dancing monkey on stage. I have no fucking idea. And then halfway through it, one of the few comics that I don't like in this business came fucking walking out like the selfish cunt that he or she is and picked up like a little square fridge that you'd have the when you lived in like a studio apartment.

Speaker 2:          00:12:10       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:11       And I was like, really? And the person was like, yeah, really? And they just fucking took and started walking out. And I said the person's name, I said from the bottom of my heart, I fucking hate you. And then I quickly shut up, cause I knew everybody in the crowd was going to film it. Um, and what's funny is, is I don't really hate this person in real life. I just fucking avoid him. You know? That's what a great thing about getting older is you stop hating people. You just sort of like, you avoid them. Even if you're sitting next to him, you just mentally avoid them. He just like, okay, I know who you are, I know how you act and this is what I expect, so I'm not going to get upset. I'm just fucking knocked gauging it, you know? And uh,

Speaker 2:          00:12:55       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:55       And then somewhere along the line they turned the lights on and I realized that I wasn't six stories in the air.

Speaker 2:          00:13:02       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:03       That the stage was still the same height it usually was. And then all of a sudden the microphone worked and I could start,

Speaker 2:          00:13:10       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:10       You know, doing my job and I started killing again. So maybe the dream was, Bill, you have an irrational fear about taking four or five days off from standup. I will tell you last night I fucking, uh, I went on stage and I got this new Bush, Michelle Obama bit that was bombing, you know, cause she's so fucking precious. You know what I mean? I don't, I don't know why, out of all the first ladies, every first lady has always been made fun of her for some fucking reason is like off limits. So you know, as a comedian something is off limits, you know, you kind of have to steer the ship towards it at one point just, just for the fun of it. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:13:50       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:51       So last night was the first night,

Speaker 2:          00:13:53       uh,

Speaker 1:          00:13:56       I started to get that started to get it to work and um, I tried a another bit, you know, about this, this gay kid, you know, parents didn't know she was gay and the parents were like fucking people that think he can pray away being gay. Um, what can you pray away? Oh, I went to church by the way. I got there late, you know, I felt bad. I got there, register fucking guy was starting his homily and I was like, ah, fuck. And then part of me was psyched because I didn't have to sit through the first two readings.

Speaker 2:          00:14:32       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:14:35       And uh, they really switched up the words a lot. The shit that you say, they switched it up a lot. I was like, is this like some west coast thing? My mother in law like Nah, they kind of changed it up. You know, he used to be peace, be with you and also with they like added a bunch of words like peace be with you. And I uh, I concur that also and would wish that upon use to sir. Slash Ma'am you've got to say all that before you should fucking shake hands with somebody. Um, I dunno, I haven't been to church in a while. I literally thought my suit was going to catch on fire when I walked in there. That's when you know you're a piece of shit. You know, you haven't been there in awhile. You just walk in and you're just thinking of all this shit God would be saying to you if he really exists and you just walking in and going, I know, I know. You know. And then after a while he gets stubborn and be like, well, you don't do, you know, technically you made me so whatever my fucking flaws are, I know you have this convenient excuse of the devil.

Speaker 1:          00:15:41       You know what I mean? I mean, what the fuck? Hey, you know, I made you perfect, but you listened to the devil. Well, did you make the devil toe?

Speaker 2:          00:15:52       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:15:52       Isn't all of this you're fucking grand scheme,

Speaker 2:          00:15:56       right?

Speaker 1:          00:15:58       I actually, when I look at God that way, right? If he exist, you know, and it is a he. Okay. Because at the end of the day, you know, when you really look at the world, most of the great things that were created were done by men.

Speaker 1:          00:16:11       And I don't know why I have to shy away from that and this progressive, but you know, ladies, why don't you put your fucking brains where your mouth though and fucking start inventing some shit. And I know you're going to come at me with this fucking list that, that is impressive to you. But I, what I also want you to Google my feminist little friends is what have men invented? And you watch that fucking there. It's fucking Dan Marino, 1984 48 touchdowns, 5,800 fucking yards when you could still beat the shit out of a wide receiver and a quarterback. Um, having said that, I uh, I respect, love it and I feel you're very brave at a time you put out your lab coat ad set out to make a new widget.

Speaker 2:          00:16:58       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:16:58       And it's so much harder for a woman to put on a lab coat. I'm just trying to make sure I have it all down. Um, just someday I would like to host an award show and I have to make sure that I'm the fucking Zombie that they're looking for. MMM,

Speaker 1:          00:17:17       I'll do, I'll come out and do a monologue just talking about how dumb men are and how we can't even figure out how to dress ourselves without women. You know, all of that shit and they'll just fucking eat it up. This is another thing I fucking hate. You know what I hate? I hate when a co a running back gets like fucking 40 caries and he has like 47 yards and then he finally breaks one for about 15 and then he gets up and he does that. I'm eating a bowl of oatmeal thing. It's like, buddy, we've been feeding you the fucking ball all God damn game. Once you go look at your fucking yardage average, you're 2.7 yards per carry cunt. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:51       Hey Bill, how about something positive? All right. I got something positive for you. I watched this fucking Celtics first of Philadelphia, 76, six, you know, fucking blew me away in that game. Was that Joelle, Joelle and beep. So you say his name. I'm not looking it up because I can't spell it. Um, evidently that guy played a soccer or football as they call it over the, over the fucking sees there. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:18:17       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:18:18       Until late in his life. I gotta tell you something. That guy is like a ridiculous factor when he's on the court and I know he's one of the guys in the league, but I don't, I don't think, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:18:28       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:18:29       I don't think he's getting the respect he deserves. That fucking guy is a problem.

Speaker 2:          00:18:33       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:18:34       On both ends of the court blocking shots, getting rebound scoring points. Fucking asis moves great for a big man. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:18:45       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:18:46       I am praying to the basketball gods. Look at me, I'm going to church and I'm fucking all about every God out there now.

Speaker 2:          00:18:54       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:18:55       Um, I can't, you feel the, the joy that's coming back into my life, my life. It's like the end of the Grinch, isn't it? Um, I am praying to the basketball gods that the, the, uh, that the Celtics in [inaudible] 76 is a gonna fucking play again. Um, I don't even care if we lose. That's how much I enjoy that playoff series. Some back in the day when I used to watch Andrew Tony and Dr Jay, Bobby Jones, Billy Cunningham, all his mother fuckers coming at town, Daryl Dawkins the first time through and then it was Moses.

Speaker 2:          00:19:31       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:19:33       Anyways, the fuck was I just going to talk about, oh, I remember. Oh, so I'm reading this book on Bob Cousy and uh, Bill Russell called the last pass. Does that really count as reading by the way, to read about sports? I don't think it does. It's like a long sports page as far as I'm concerned. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:19:52       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:19:52       I don't know if I brought this up already. I forget, but like for the longest time I thought,

Speaker 2:          00:19:57       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:19:57       That the first NBA basketball player with the sneaker deal was Michael Jordan. Now he might've had wait his name on the sneaker, but then I found out that those red and white converse, we're called the doctor J's, but the, I don't remember them having his name on it initially. So then, um, I'm reading this book.

Speaker 2:          00:20:24       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20:25       And I find out that Bob Cousy and likes 1962 or 63 had his own sneaker. He signed a deal with pf flyers and it looks like a bootleg chuck Taylor. And I found a pair on, on fucking Ebay for 155 bucks. I didn't buy him, but cause I'm not a sneaker head. Yo. Uh, Yo, you see the dude Jordan 48, um, what are they up to by the way? What are they up to? It is amazing that 30 years has gone by. He must have a new sneaker every year. I would say they're on the Jordan 32. So let's look this, well, let's finish this story. So Bob Cousy, that's the one that I want, you know, I'm kind of fascinated by that whole

Speaker 7:          00:21:10       mmm.

Speaker 1:          00:21:13       A sneaker culture as far as like,

Speaker 2:          00:21:16       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:21:17       you know, all the different, like do you get the Sundale three fours or whatever, you know, Jordan's 2019 let's see what they got coming up. What do they got in the, in the, in, in the fucking sneaker barrel. Air Jordan. One retro sample.

Speaker 2:          00:21:38       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:21:39       Oh, it was a sample. So that's not exactly what they came out with. And they want $4,000 for those. Are you fucking kidding me? What do you do? How do, what do you sneak hedge? So you put them on the wall so you feel like you're always in a footlocker. Uh, Air Jordan release 2018 all right, let's see. What are they up to here? Air Jordan. 12

Speaker 2:          00:22:00       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:22:00       How the fuck are they? Only on the 12th. All right. Air Jordan nine dude verse, he sent me a text the other day was fucking hilarious. He's like, dude, Jordan, three MOCHA fucking over. And it was the Jordan threes with this mocha color cement thing and I fucking died laughing. I mean, he's, he's like, he's like that fucking chick day with the thin head. Sarah Jessica Parker on sex in the city. So rather than talking about fucking high heels, he's talking about sneakers.

Speaker 7:          00:22:38       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:22:40       Anyway, so Bob Cousy, he had a pair of pf flyers and you know with a little circle is on the chuck Taylor was his face and it said Bob Cousy on it and they were black and they had a little green trim on them. So that's as far back for all you fucking sneaker heads there. I know Kareem Abdul Jabbar, he had his own, did he have his own sneaker? Ucla low top Adita I dunno, but w who was like the first guy actually he had like his name on it though because I think maybe the technically,

Speaker 2:          00:23:10       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:10       The doctor Jay Converse just said, um, we're just nicknamed the doctor J's, but they said converse on. He says, let me look that up, Doctor Jay. Conversely, this is why I like talking shit about things cause then I ended up getting into it like fucking the pro, the premier league.

Speaker 7:          00:23:31       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:23:33       All right, let's see here. Yeah, those are the classic classic converse all stars. I don't see his name on it. Oh. And then eventually they did. But the original one, one of the cleanest fucking shoes ever that for some reason I think the newer ones said when I was a kid, they didn't say dr j on him. And now I'm looking at a really old pair and those ones say dr j. So I think after a while they said doctor Jay and those things look like they came up before the year Jordan. But as far as I can tell the Bob fucking cozy.

Speaker 2:          00:24:05       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:24:06       The koozie ones do. There was somebody fucking way back to God coochie ones with a pork pie hat fucking over Shea. Um, all right. Let me look at some stuff here. Uh, I missed the last two Liverpool Games. I get all wrapped up in the holidays and I cannot fucking believe this. I don't know anything about the Wolverhampton Wanderers, but somehow we lost to them.

Speaker 2:          00:24:33       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:24:34       We beat new castle United four to nothing, but the fucking wolves means guys don't even look like they, they there. There's nothing premiere about their, their uniform, their fucking name or anything. What happened?

Speaker 2:          00:24:51       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:24:52       Mohammed Silo and virtual van Dutch struck to claim, oh no, they won.

Speaker 2:          00:24:57       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:24:58       Wait a minute. And that doesn't make any fucking sense. That doesn't make any fucking sense. Cause we beat Manchester United three to one and it says three to one.

Speaker 2:          00:25:14       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:25:15       And then it says Fuckin zero two.

Speaker 2:          00:25:18       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:25:19       So I guess they do that all cause that was an away game.

Speaker 2:          00:25:23       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:25:24       Ah, your cheeky cons. All right. I learned something else. That's how they do it. Okay. So they got arsenal one nil arsenal coming up. The only one, only Premier Li game, uh, I've ever been to. I told you they played Everton. It's fucking hilarious. And they went up one to nothing and they started singing one Neal arsenal in halfway through the fucking song ever written scored. And this little blue puff of smoke came up.

Speaker 2:          00:25:51       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:25:51       The 40 Everton fans, we're going fucking nuts. And all the arsenal people had to shut the fuck up. Uh, I love when that happens.

Speaker 2:          00:25:59       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:26:00       I was watching a ranger game earlier this year and fucking as always, Henrik Lundqvist was playing unbelievable and the whole garden is going and rig lug was Henrik Lundqvist or whatever. And as the chance that the other team fucking scored.

Speaker 2:          00:26:17       Uh Huh.

Speaker 1:          00:26:19       It's what you get. All right. Let's look at some Google news here. We'll start with the greatest country in America, the United States of America. All right? After Trump visits, Iraq, lawmakers demand US withdrawal. Finally, let's get the fuck outta their way. We're going bankrupt. Iraqi lawmakers demand withdraw Baghdad, Iraqi lawmakers. This is the greatest thing that could fucking happen to us if we combine it with solar power.

Speaker 2:          00:26:53       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:26:54       In electric cars. All right? You gotta hit them where it hurts. Just like the feminists do. The feminists go after the money. They go after the advertisers. This is what the fuck you got to do in the Middle East. All right.

Speaker 1:          00:27:11       Truly, the great thing though, as if we pull out, I believe they'll just go back. Unfortunately, because I don't have a problem with Middle Eastern people. I just have a problem with cunts. Okay. And cuts. They're everywhere. Right. Um, as long as you're not a client, I don't have a problem with you. So I think that they'll go back to trying to fucking, you know, deal with each other. Hopefully not in a violent way, but you know, it's going to be, but I always looked at it like the way when Russia withdrew from fucking Europe, everybody was like, okay, where were we? And they just picked up what their fights again. It's really se I, I, for the life of me, I'll never understand how war is legal.

Speaker 2:          00:27:53       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:27:55       You know, we're sitting here like working on gender neutral bathrooms while war is still legal. I mean it's just fucking nuts. You know what it is. I think it's cause they, they keep updating the war, the, uh, the weapons. So it seems modern, you know, but if you still went out there like the Braveheart days, and there was, you know, two people standing on opposing hills and then they just ran down the hill yelling,

Speaker 8:          00:28:20       oh,

Speaker 1:          00:28:22       just fucking met in the valley. And they had those sticks with the fucking, uh, the, the, the, the fucking cannon ball with the spikes coming out of it. You know, basically you're dressing a raider fan, except you can actually hurt somebody. You don't have the rubber points. You wouldn't want to put somebody's eye out when you're intimidating somebody. Raider fans. Um, all right. So politicians

Speaker 1:          00:28:49       from both blocks of Iraq's divided parliament called for a vote to expel US troops and promise to schedule an extraordinary session to the debate, the matter parlor. I think that they'd taken control of their country. Again, parliament must clearly an urgently express its view about the ongoing American violations of Iraq. Sovereignty. Said Salaam, I'll Shamira a lawmaker loyal to the populace cleric mock Tada Owl Satta through the fucking balls you have over there to be any sort of a leader of men. I mean, you're really, I mean, I hope what they're doing over there works because what we're doing is not stopping terrorism. Maybe it's stopping it from coming over here. I don't fucking know. But all I know is when I look at the ledger, uh, you know, we're, we're fucking bankrupt. We just keep raising our amount of debt. Why don't we fucking good back here? Get back here. Bring the fucking kids home. All right. Fucking get on. Get into this electrical shit. I didn't give a shit if it hurts the environment more just like so he can, we can pay this shit off. All right. With the money we make from exporting all the weed that we're growing,

Speaker 1:          00:30:04       the God damn it. If I can figure out how to solve the world's problems, kids, somebody in a suit and tie a, all right, let's see what's going on in Germany. That's my first stop. Germany army could recruit EU citizens. Ah, for fuck sakes. It just, Jeremy, they really doing this again.

Speaker 2:          00:30:24       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:30:25       All right. Slowly loading. Slowly, slowly loading. It is really bizarre how Europe, if they're not unified, they did. They just fucking, they will start a world war, you know? I know. Then what do we get? We get shit for border. What's the worst thing we did? We get fat. Is that all we're doing a Nobel, I think you're doing a little more than that in the world are right. All right. German army could recruit EU citizens seven years after Germany scrapped conscription, whatever the fuck that it, it's defense chief has said, employing EU citizens is an option to fill expert posts. Army general inspector Ybor hard Zorn.

Speaker 2:          00:31:11       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:31:11       Said the forces had to lock, handle, sorry. Lock look in all direction in times of lack of qualified personnel such as doctors and it specialists. Oh Wow. Have they outsourced all their shit in their country to the armed forces have been beset by years of underinvestment. Germany aims to increase its military by 21,000 personnel by 2025 well, what the fuck are they getting ready for? Ah, Jesus Christ. Oh Man. You know, this is why you don't read World News. This is why you just sit around and you try and find a new sport that you can get involved in.

How, what are you going to do with it? Huh? Are you going to make this the greatest Monday you'd like? Don't you hate when that goes. Fucking motivational speakers is sitting there. You're trying to get motivated to not be a negative con like myself, right? And then this guy comes out, you're getting, you're getting all excited to fucking have something positive be said to you. And what does the Guy Do? He keeps, he gets you all nervous with this fucking ridiculous, heightened sense of urgency for just a regular fucking day. This is Monday. Think about that. If you buddy, this is Monday, December 27th, 2010. Does anybody know what that means? Well, I mean there's no history. Don't you hit, that's the worst part too. When they start acting like somebody else. Talk to them. Well, John, there's no historical, uh, thingamajig for December 27th. This is just a regular day. Think about 10. If you buddy, it's just a regular day.

Speaker 4:          00:37:43       Is this just a regular shirt and my, just a regular person. Is that how I'm going to live my life right there. Fucking Bam. Blow his fucking brains out right there. See, it wasn't a regular Monday. You're fucking Douche. It was a Monday you died because no one wants to hear your current speech. All right. I think I've said 58 times already. Um, anyways, it's December 27th, two days up to Christmas. It's 72 motherfucking days. And to me not drinking, I can need five more days. No, four more days. And I break my record for uh, you know, being sober. I'm going for a hundred days and uh, it's good. It's going good. Oh yeah, I'm having a great fucking time. Uh, Jesus. Um, anyways. Did you guys have yourself a merry little Christmas? Do you have a good Christmas? Did you get the things that you wanted?

Speaker 4:          00:38:35       Um, I had a fucking awesome Christmas once I was able to finally relax cause uh, people out there who do the road truckers are the comedians, lounge singers actually lounge singers don't travel. That just stuck at that same fucking place. You know, like Jack Nicholson in the movie, the shining just slowly going fucking crazy. Playing handball off the wall of their red roof inn. Fucking sweet. Um, yeah, when you travel as much as I do, uh, your brain, I dunno, it can't slow down at the needs like four or five days to slow down. And uh, you can't sit down on a couch and a lay down on a bed for like, at least I can't feel like more than 10 minutes. Your brain is just fucking go and go and go and go and go. And, and uh, it took me like four or five days and then I was finally able to relax and in a, and enjoy the holiday.

Speaker 4:          00:39:37       I actually a, I was so wound up from doing the road. I actually wanted to be a, wanted to be alone. Don't, even though I didn't want to be alone, it's Christmas. I don't want to be alone, but I did. I just didn't want to deal with any sort of, uh, people. And I've discovered when you become an adult, truly become an adult is a Christmas is not about you anymore. It's about making sure everyone around you had a great Christmas. And then after all the frenzy is sitting back and your enjoyment is that everyone around you had a great Christmas. And I finally figured that out this year. And, uh, I became a jolly son of a bitch. I really enjoyed my Christmas, you know, and I got to admit, on December 26th yesterday I went out and bought something that I wanted. Um, um, gradually putting together a John Bonam fucking, uh, I don't know if I'm going at out as, as him on Halloween or a fun fucking, uh, gonna make a stupid youtube video. I don't know what, but I'm gradually putting together shit that looks like stuff that he wore. And a, I can grow a beard. I'll dye it brown. We'll see what happens. You know what I bought? I bought his Adidas sneakers that he wore at the, uh, the Seattle concert.

Speaker 4:          00:41:10       And you know, you're a fucking John Bonham freak for those of you weren't in a music. John Bonham is the greatest fucking drummer I ever heard, you know? Um, just as far as the shit that I like, I know you can say, oh, Max Roach and all those fucking guys. Who Buddy rich. I'm not trying to be a dick here. All right. But like, except for the kids who think Neil Peart is better than John Bonam. All right. And if you think that you

Speaker 9:          00:41:34       are a monotone jackass, um, all right. But anyways, yeah, if you go on youtube and you look up, uh, it's actually Moby Dick rare clip and it's him in Seattle. And at that point they weren't calling it Moby Dick Anymore. They will calling it, uh, I something, I guess over the top because Robert Plant Goes Joan Henry bottom over the top and then they got like this, this, this 1970s, uh, what is it fucking technology where it goes over the top, top, top weight. You know, it's supposed to be like blowing people's minds. And if you look at the arrogant way, Robert Plant walks away from the mic. You really want to throw something at the back of his bushy head. But, uh, if you watch John Bonam play, he's got a pair of I believe, uh, the Adidas dragons. Huh? Anybody old out there? Remember that deed is dragon's Adidas country, uh, the Adidas dragons.

Speaker 9:          00:42:29       So I have those and all I need is a pair of white fucking pants and they sell a replica. That tee shirt that he wore in the song remains the same. So right there I got the fucking outfit. Then I've got to do is just get a wig and I'm good to go. Uh, maybe I'll do that for you guys next year. I'll make a fucking off. You know, there'll be a riot. I should do that and not say it's me and I'll, I'll just put a youtube video up and it'll be John Bonam cover and I'll butcher it, one of his songs. And you guys can all laugh at how bad people trash for actually buying the entire outfit. I'm not above it, dude. I am a total fucking music geek like that. I will actually buy some. Speaking of that, I want to recommend a book here before I am.

Speaker 9:          00:43:12       I don't know if I've even said anything funny other than revealing how fucking pathetic my personal life is. Um, what do I got here? Um, out of all the led Zepplin books out there and there's a zillion of them and they're all fucking ridiculous for the most part. They always have them selling their soul to the devil and Jimmy Page muttering some sort of a cult bullshit walking away. Um, you know of them fucking sticking a flounder in some girls Twat, which probably happened in Seattle. I have no fucking idea. But, uh, the best book that I have found on it is a, it's called John Bonam, the powerhouse behind led Zeppelin and it's written by his brother, Mick bottom. And it says right on the back, or is it on the inside cover? Why he wrote the book? He basically says, if I can just paraphrase here, why don't I just, I'll read you a little excerpt about 10 years ago.

Speaker 9:          00:44:11       This is from his brother, um, after, oh actually, Linda Bonham wrote this about 10 years ago after reading yet another load of rubbish about his brother John. My husband mic turned to me and said, I should write a book about our kid, if only to tell Zoho John's daughter what a great bloke your dad was. And with that, the seeds of this book began to grow and it's fuck, it's just a killer book. It's very, very little of it is actually about, you know, all the bullshit that those other books are about, which is, you know, and then they went to this town and they drank this much and they did this and they did that. It's, it's really, uh, him growing up with John and John being home in between the tours and, uh, it's fucking awesome. I read it in like a day and a half, two days.

Speaker 9:          00:45:02       But when do you expect that considering I basically expose myself to be like that chick who whacks Selena. You know, you know that fucking psycho, uh, Jesus Christ's of John Bonham was alive. What I be stocking him. This is really getting creepy. All right, let's, let's fucking plow ahead yet, but I want to recommend that book. All right. In this big words and lots of pages, by big words, I mean big font, lots of pictures and um, yeah, definitely check it out. Definitely check it out. And a classic Englishman, I can tell you that about John Bonham in that like most Englishman, he looks like he never lifted a weight in his life. Got that awful fish and chip torso yet continued to wear tight shirts right through this career. Never understand that. You only see that you don't, you do not see that here in America, except with gay guys.

Speaker 9:          00:45:55       Gay guys will wear tight shirts no matter what shape the rent. That's not true. They will actually, if long as they got a little peck action going on, they don't give a fuck about this stomach. You know that as long as that chest is out a little bit further than the stomach, they wear tight shirts too. But I've been over to Europe and I'm telling you, I've never seen it. Like you can never did a pushup and their fucking lives, those types of bodies. You got that seventh grade chest and arms and then this fucking, I just drank a keg of beer stomach and uh, this, you know, this is like, you know what it is? This is like they, they made it big before Elvis fucking died in Elvis is the first behind the music as far as the rock star and all that to, I know every one guy, he stole all the music from the Blues and Gospel Black Dudes.

Speaker 9:          00:46:47       You know what? Go Fuck Yourself. So sick of that stupid ass fucking argument. He didn't, he was influenced by him, but because he's a different race, they said he stole it. It's such bullshit. You know, if you're black and you listen to a blues guy and you play blues, you're carrying on a tradition. But if you're white, you do it. You stealing. All right, in a black dude fucking a steel white music, they're sampling. It's bullshit. It's all bullshit. Nobody's stealing from anybody. You're year of being influenced so enough already with the fucking whining. I'm so sick of fucking people pitching that this unfair business is unfair. Yes. Show businesses on fair if life is unfair. Oh really? Did you write it and then you didn't get credit? Well, fucking welcome to the club. I never wrote anything that I need to get credit for it, but I can tell you right now, I have been a victim of some very creative math.

Speaker 9:          00:47:39       Yeah. You know what, Bill, here's your royalty checks. Uh, that's $4 and 98 cents. Yeah. We had a hundred grand worth of white out that we, and we had to buy a new typewriter that costs us 30 grand, you know, and all that comes out of your fucking pocket. Yeah. It's been going on forever. But the reason why I say, uh, Elvis is the original behind the music is because he's the first guy who got as far as I can tell, got lofted all the way up into the stratosphere. And uh, like everything he did now is just so fucking cliche, but he was the first guy doing it. So nobody could really see it, you know, and by the time he died as a drug drug addicted fat fuck on a toilet, that was 77, you know, at which point, you know, [inaudible] was approaching 30 years of age.

Speaker 9:          00:48:31       They were, it was already too late. Right. Does that make any fucking sense? I'm trying to, I'm trying to justify, and this is also before, like John Bonham never would have got that if he was living today. I, I can, I can't guarantee that he wouldn't be dead, but he definitely would have like a 95% chance and not being dead because someone would be like, you know, say you had a problem. That'd be an intervention. And then also when he got out of shape and he started getting the man tits there, they, they, they fucking, he would've got the ship teased out of him on youtube and just start a sheer fucking humiliation. Uh, I think you would have done some setups, but you never know. He is European and they just really don't seem to be into physical fitness over there.

Speaker 9:          00:49:14       This is coming from an American, they're not obese, but they are just some fleshy mushy sons of bitches over there. Not all of them. Not all. You get your occasional one, but they'll the occasional ones seems like the ones that are born that way. You know, like the dad was like a fucking ship builder and his dad was the, you know, fucking work with Thor or some shit. You know what I mean? On a fucking, now what? What am I talking about here? Really? People. Huh? 13 minutes of absolute shit. All right, let's, what, what are we going to talk about this week here? Um, oh, you guys want to hear a story? Because when his story here do you got, you have to, do you actually have to work right now? Does anybody know? Does anybody working right now? Does anybody have such a fucking Dick for a boss that he basically gave you new year's Eve off and then Christmas Day off and now it's Monday.

Speaker 9:          00:50:05       Now you're back to work. You know, this is a really, I don't know about you guys, but this is one of the most depressing weeks of the year, you know, is the week between Christmas and New Year's. Once Christmas is over, you know, it's like you see the buildup of the tree. First of all, you get your Christmas tree and if you're like me, everybody trashes the tree except for this guy here who writes me this letter. Hey Bill, fuck the haters. Fuck the haters. Your tree is awesome. Your tree is a noble fir, which is a far superior tree compared to those faggoty Douglas firs. I love of this guy made to leak just those trees are gay. Um, anyways, where the hell am I? Yes, they look a little sparse, but there is actually room to hang the ornaments. I like to joke that most people decorate their Christmas bushes by just throwing shit at them and hoping for the best ever.

Speaker 9:          00:50:58       Notice all the ends of the branches of Douglas Firs are freshly cut. A Douglas firs do not grow in a conical shape. That means Christmas tree shape. I guess they have to be trimmed in order to look like a tree because they normally look like a bush. Exactly. That's why I never liked those fucking trees. It looks like a shrub. I've never seen a fucking tree looked like a Christmas tree. That's why. And that's why I liked the tree that I bought because it looked like a fucking tree. Thank you sir. Um, he said, have you ever seen how they prune these trees on the farm before this ship to your local grocery store parking lot? A dude would dude with the hedge clipper tied to his back at an angle, goes up and down the roads of bushes and walks around each one, cutting it into a Christmas tree shape.

Speaker 9:          00:51:45       Nobles aren't artificially shaped at all and grow to be symmetrical and perfectly proportioned. There you go. So go fuck yourself. They also had somebody else write me a letter saying that fuck all those people by, uh, my sister or somebody is uh, ah, fuck, I wish I saved. This is in, in some sort of artistic design or something to like my Theresa. You know what? I'm a little ahead of the curve people you way, you know what's going to happen. One of these fucking emaciated celebrities is going to get one and then it's going to become all the rage thing. We wearing uggs with the fucking Santa Claus Thong, right? With the midriff showing be like Anna God. Like oh my God, this tree is like Anna God and they're going to be in US magazine and that's going to be it. Matthew mcconaughey will be naked playing bongos.

Speaker 9:          00:52:30       Um, and it'll all work out, but you will remember that you heard it here first. You heard it here first. I actually bought a fucking tree. You guys bought shrubs. All right, so fuck you and your holiday. Um, but anyways, yeah, it's a really depressing week. So anyways, you go out and you buy the God damn tree. So then you have the tree and as the excitement of the smell of the tree, it smells like Christmas. All my God, it's got to happen, right? It's that time of year. We're going to actually get off the wheel for a second. Joy, the people around us, hopefully, you know. And then what happened? And you decorate the tree, you put a little skirt around it, you dress up that little whore, right? You get even more excited that one app. But you come home for work and one of your family members of the person you live with has wrapped a couple of gifts putting in underneath. This is the buildup, right? This is Elvis, 1954 right? For 40 fucking hit. You know, and then what happens? A couple more gifts. So he puts on a fucking Christmas record. Your balls have filled up just waiting to fucking for Christmas Day. And then Christmas comes, alright, Elvis on the fucking Ed Sullivan show. Everybody's going fucking crazy people opening gifts is fucking bitches screaming outside your window.

Speaker 9:          00:53:53       You throw down a scarf at him, everything is fucking great. And then just like dad, it's over. It's fucking over. You know, you get drafted, send you over to Jeremy. I can't do this Elvis thing I don't fucking own saying here. You know what I mean? Dennis fucking over. They need looking at your tree. You know, it's still got the lights, it still has to skirt. But what happened? All the gifts, they're all God. You know, it was a couple of pieces of paper. It's like they peaked. It's like your favorite band. They had those three awesome albums in a row and now they're about ready to fucking spend their rest of their career, trying to recapture those, the, the, the, whatever the fuck they did in those three albums. Right.

Speaker 9:          00:54:35       And then that's it. So over to say goodbye to everybody. You start looking at your family members. You see him there a year older. She makes you feel older. Yeah. No, nothing's on TV. All the TV people are on vacation. This show in something on a loop. Mtvs finally showing fucking videos. He gets quiet. You sit back and reflect on what a nice Christmas it is, but you just can't get over this feeling of this wave of depression that's coming because you know it's about radius start all over again. Another fucking year with this fucking job, with that fucking Douche telling me what to do. My fucking by fan, he a fucking girlfriend or your wife or your husband. It's going to be another fucking year. You know the edge of fucking tree, just reminding you of your God damn mortality because you're not, you're not, you're not fucking water in it.

Speaker 9:          00:55:33       The way you watered it before Christmas. You skip a few days, branches start to droop, couple start to turn brown like the gray and your hair. Look at this artistic little, jot them on here, you know, and by the t and then what's the worst is then you start walking down the street, going out to your car and what happens to body start piling up out there. You see your first fucking Christmas tree, that Bah humbug Douche bag across the street. Who throws the fucking thing out at like one o'clock in the morning, December 26th and it's sitting out there, right laying on its side like a fucking victim at the beginning of the first 48 you know, just got one little piece of tensile blowing in the wind because the rest of it's shit got snatched off from around it's fucking neck. Just lay there. Dead is a fucking door. Doornail next day you come out, there's two more. Start driving down the work. And you just see them all over the place. Just being the positive, you know, like fucking former stars and boy bands just littering the fucking highway and it's fucking over this fucking over.

Speaker 9:          00:56:53       So what do you do then? He got what? You got New Year's eve coming up the worst fucking holiday of the year. You know, New Year's Eve is for young people. It's not for old people. You know, that's when you know, you've hit a level of maturity is when you can go to bed at like 10 o'clock, 10:00 PM on New Year's eve and you didn't go out. You didn't get drunk. He stayed away from those fucking morons. You know, I'd say what's a great weekend to go out as the weekend after New Year's eve and all those guys who, people are still fucking hung over and they're still fucking sick, you know, from their overindulgent cause they don't know how to drink and eat. Then you head out, like I'll tell you what's it, you know, it's gonna be a great night. Uh, what's, what's New Year's? He Friday night. You want to be a great night to go out drinking Monday night that my friends will be a great God damn night.

Speaker 9:          00:57:44       If you're an antisocial fucking prick like I am, that's, that's where you want to go. Um, oh hey. Speaking of which, listen to this shit. Me and Paul Versey, we're coming down to the wire here. We're actually tied. All right. As of right before this weekend, we are tight. All right. And I got to tell you something this week I had a breakthrough in my gambling. We picked four games a week. Whoever wins it in the end, it's only a hundred bucks, but it's, it's more just about the shit talk and during the year, um, so this year nobody has gone undefeated yet. All right, so you're talking 16 weeks ago gambling 32 weeks between the two of us, nobody has gone for no, we've had a, you know, a number of three in ones, but nobody has gone for an hour. And a Paul Versey actually did the impossible. What do we called the unthinkable and the unimaginable, the unimaginable is going for no, he did the unthinkable.

Speaker 9:          00:58:54       He went, oh and for so this week I don't know what I was talking to one, a knee, his uncles and uh, he was talking about going against public opinion and there was this whole new website and shit about going against public opinion with your gambling. And I decided to take a little bit of that. All right, cause this is, this is what I realized the reason why I could never break through three in one and get to foreign no, is because I kept picking people that I thought were going to win every fucking game. And I know that sounds crazy, but to gamblers, that makes sense. You know, when you don't have money on the game, you can actually sit there and fucking, you know, just say, you know what? Not only do I think this team's going to cover the spread. I think they're going to win the fucking game.

Speaker 9:          00:59:46       But all of a sudden when you put money on it, you alligator arm it and you, you just start, you know, you get too scared to take a fucking chance. At least I did. So this week I was like, fuck it. I'm taking a couple of chances here. All right. I went to safe. At first, I picked Tampa over Seattle and that dockers wearing fucking coaching staff with Pete Carroll. I said, fuck it. I'm going with Tampa now. That was one that I was, that was my plane. It's safe. Bet. And then I don't know, I was looking at Washington and Jacksonville and I was like, you know, it's in Jacksonville. Jacksonville's going to win that. You know they're going to win this game. They're going to get the running game going. They are going to fucking run over. They got fucking rex Grossman playing quarterback for Washington.

Speaker 9:          01:00:33       It's fucking over. But I don't know why. I got a feeling I got to feel and fucking Washington is going to win this game just because nobody thinks they're going to. So I said, fuck it. I've bet on Washington, you know? And then continuing that line of thought San Diego was going into Cincinnati. Cincinnati is shit, the bed the entire fucking year. San Diego always plays well in December. They're a heckle, a heckle and Jeckle. Oh, fucking a, what do you call it? Jekyll and Hyde. Fucking a team. And I said to hell with that, I don't give a shit. I'm going with Cincinnati. And Lo and behold, yours truly with three and Oh, yesterday three and Paul Versey went one and two. We had the Sunday night game, but it got fucking snowed out. I won game up on them. I'm sorry. We're not tied. I am one game up on him.

Speaker 9:          01:01:25       All right. So I went through, you know, yesterday he went one and two. So matter what happens tonight, you know, if I lose my game, he, he wins his game. I'm going to be up by two games with one week to go. All right? But if I win tonight and go foreign over four, no, I will have done the unimaginable. I'll, I'll done it. And who do you think I took tonight? Who would you take? The spread is two and a half falcons at home playing the saints. Who Do you like? Who Do you like? 12 and two is that what a, is that what the Falcons are Matty ice at home? Just given two and a half. It's their fucking year. I said fuck it.

Speaker 9:          01:02:14       I'm taking the saints. It took the saints and the points with drew Brees sticking with line of thought of going against the, playing it safe. I think a, I don't think the falcons had been tested yet this year and uh, I just think that, you know, this is just going to be one of those things that happens to a team like this. I still think they might be a year away from doing something huge. And this is one of these games where I just think they're going to get a wake up call. Like okay, we're good but we s we but like we're not like the saints that actually have gone through the whole thing on one of the super bowl. That's why I took the saints I'm looking to go for, no, Paul Versey has got the now Tuesday night game. He took the Minnesota Vikings getting 14 points and a, I'm telling you, if I go for no and he goes one and three, I'll pick up three games.

Speaker 9:          01:03:01       I'll be up for games with one week to go and we pick four games. All have to do is fucking win one game. It's a goddamn extra point. It's a chip shot and I will get bragging rights for the entire fucking year and I will really be excited about that. And with that, so they go for all of these though, all of you who are into the gambling aspects of my life and I with that, somebody actually came up with this awesome theory, um, about sports. Uh, this guy says, Bill, I have, I have a theory about sports that tends to piss people off, especially women, which makes me think I'm onto something. And it's got nothing to do with the unpredictability of sports. I think he's this, this, this, this theory is basically why people like sports. He said it mainly applies, um, to team sports. Some individual sports too. Okay. So here it is. It begins back in the day when armies were in the field waiting to go into battle and armies objective was essentially to conquer foreign lands and rape women in order to celebrate the glory of their race slash, culture and they would train for battles by making up games. These games were based around themes of land grabbing and raping.

Speaker 9:          01:04:17       In this theory, the ball, football, basketball, whatever represents the seed, the goals, either posts or a hoop or a net represents the opposing team's women symbolizing either their legs up in the air or their vantage or their womb, whatever. The opposing team represents the enemy army and the objective of the game is to get your seed past the opposition and impregnate their women. That's essentially the theory and it's a abridged version and it's why some sports are like cracked and some are just who gives a shit when a sport is put together. Right. It's a primal source of highly addictive goodness. Did you ever think somebody who would like basically compare sports to rape with then you know if you were going to do that, you wouldn't think that they would basically. Then just say yeah, and it's, you think that there would be trashing it.

Speaker 9:          01:05:14       Not saying that it's a, that it's a form of highly addictive goodness. So there you go. Actually look that theory. I believe in that. All that subliminal Shit, you know, and uh, yeah, I'll go with deck. What do you guys think about that dairy? My the worst. MERV Griffin ever. I have no studio audience. What do you guys think into the abyss? Um, am I really going to do another fucking, I got to, I got to be, uh, I gotta be balanced here, fair and balanced when it comes to the sports shit, as it's becoming too much sports. I got to, Oh, here's one for you. I, but I tell you, I was, I said I forgot. I was going to tell you a story here. Uh, I took cleo out. Uh, we went outside for a walk so she could do her business and I'm walking up the street and I went around the corner and Cleo is a, you know, she's going, number one, she's taken a piss.

Speaker 9:          01:06:09       So I'm standing there, right? And I, I looked and I see this guy as Cleo is beginning to do, her thing is walking to his SUV, like one of those little mini ones, like the Lexus sorta one. And I see him looking at me, I just sort of look back. I didn't think anything of it. And cleo is going in the bathroom and I'm going, that's a good girl. Good girl. She'll go grow. You go to a bat boy as you go girl, I'm doing that shit right. Slapping her on her fucking muscular thighs and you know, she finishes does a Little Harlem shake, you know, and then she fought, we start fucking uh, walking up the street and then I said, the guy down at the SUV, he all of a sudden you just say this, pick it up dude.

Speaker 9:          01:06:55       I'm like, what? This dude pick it up. I go and I realized he touched, he took his shit, which she didn't. I go, she went number one. I can't believe I said that, but I wonder when the argument, I would be like, she took a pith and when she went number one and then the guy just gets in his fucking car such that getting this, it is little SUV thing. I go, what? No, sorry. You Go. So I said sorry. Yeah, not as loud as you said that other shit. Then he got in his car and he fucking drove away. It's one thing I fucking hate about the west coast is the way they confront you. The confrontation out here. I don't know why they do it like back east. They would have been like, hey dude, fucking Nino. Pick up your shit. You know out here. And so he's like, I don't know what it is. They always calling you bro. Hey Bro, what's up dude? Pick it up. Deved just fucking annoys the shit out of me. It just fucking annoying. I don't know. That's the only time it really bugs me being out here is that that that surfer fucking way that they talk when they think they confront you, Bro. What a Douche. And you know, what kills me is that that affected,

Speaker 4:          01:08:17       that affected me the way I interacted with people, you know, for like the next four hours. I just had that playing in a loop in my head, pick it up. It was in my fucking head everywhere I went when paper or plastic, you know, just it's, you know, all he had pickup deed. I'm just fucking here that in my head. And uh, what did you know what I mean? The proper way to do that is just to be like, excuse me. Did, did your dog just, uh, go number two and then not all she went, number one, it'd be like, okay, I'm sorry. It's just lately people are leaving. Okay. That's the way you do it. You know, just go pick it up, dude. Fucking, ah, I wish I could train cleo. You know, for those of you new to my podcast, she is a pit bull to just do a mock charge. You know, they do that in the wild.

Speaker 4:          01:09:17       I just wished it just teeth or I just fucking run, just have that guide p his slacks a little bit. And then right to the point where he thought he was going to get his fucking balls ripped off, she just stops on a dime. It turns around and this fucking runs up the beautiful way that she runs. I should take a video of my dog running full speed. It's one of the most beautiful things you ever gonna to see. It's literally, you could make like one of those secretary movies, this fucking dog, she is shredded I and like she should, she's awesome. And the way she runs the level of power, first of all, when she runs, she gets like excited right before she does and she does this move where she sorta throws her head back a little bit and just throws her [inaudible]. It's like, it's like a fucking muscle car.

Speaker 4:          01:10:08       It's unbelievable. Absolutely loved watching her run. And if I could just somehow train her to run and scare the shit out of people who say pick it up, deed, that would really make me happy. So, uh, that's what happened this week. And then I went inside and that ended up getting into an argument with Nia cause I was just in a bad fucking mood. Uh, no did I, now she got mad at me about something else. She was really pissed at me this week. I don't what the fuck, you know, one of those deals. I think it was cause I was coming down off being off the on the road and she thought that I was going to be a dick. And, uh, no matter how many times I tell her that I have to, you know, I need a few days to unwind. Like I literally have the urge when I'm in the house to get up and just get in the car and just start driving around because I'm so in travel mode and go and go and go and go and go and that it, uh, it takes a fucking minute. So, uh, you know, I don't know. I don't know if I've got to do yoga or whatever. I have no fucking idea. It's definitely seems to be causing a rift. Um,

Speaker 9:          01:11:14       but anyways, I just remembered I was going to tell you, oh, I know last night I went and I saw the fighter starring Mark Wahlberg and a Christian Bale, and I can't recommend that movie highly enough. That movie was fucking awesome. It was a movie I wasn't going to see. I'm like, Oh God, here we go. Rocky all over again. But what saved it was, it was Micky ward. And, uh, I remember his fights and I'm embarrassed to said I didn't see that Arturo Gotti fight until years afterwards. I actually watched it on Youtube and I remember Colin Quinn coming into the cellar raving about that fight. Um, in fact, there's two fights that I remember that I was just like, I have to see this fight. It was the Micky ward, Arturo Gotti fight after hearing Colin Quinn Rave about it down at the comedy cellar. And, uh, the Diego Cora, uh, corrals, fights.

Speaker 9:          01:12:12       Uh, was it corrals? Casteel fight is, that's what was, yes. Diego, I can't fucking remember. She can tell. I dip in and out of boxing, but, uh, that's a crap corrals. Casteel their first fucking fight is unbelievable. And Charlie Murphy flipped out about that when he told me he almost broke his foot at the end of that fight. Well, one of them is just, you know, knocked out, gets up in this training, goes, you better fucking get inside now cause everything, I think I told this story before you guys, you better fucking get inside now when he put his mouthpiece in him and uh, he turned around, they continue the round, he fucking knocks. The other guy technically knocks out the other fucking guy. And I guess that got Charlie so fucking amped up. He, he stomped his foot down on the floor and woke up his whole family.

Speaker 9:          01:13:01       So those are the two fights. But anyway, so this fight, uh, this, this movie is about a Micky Ward's, uh, you know, ascension up to trying to win a championship. And, uh, I have to tell you, man, it is absolutely phenomenal. I was rooting for like the Mark Walberg character while he was fighting. It was fucking awesome. Maybe want to get in great shape. And I gotta tell you, I don't think I've ever seen a movie where they did the Boston accent better. You even just for that reason, even if you're not a sports fan, you got to go see there and see the five women that play his sister's stiff. They're fucking unbelievable. And it reminded me of this period in my life when I was underage and I used to go out to these dive bars in like Chelsea and all those awful m towns north of Boston, Malden, Medford reveal.

Speaker 9:          01:13:54       I used to go out to all of those places because they didn't give a fuck cause most of them were actually, you know, you know, people were doing coke, it was the 80s now some people was selling coke. So like alcohol just seemed like it was a joke. It's like somebody went up there and asked for some juice so I could actually get served my fucking 12 year old boy ish face. And um, those five women that you see, uh, in, in, in that movie that those are the kinds of girls that you ran into. They will like 21 years old. And they look like they were 40. They already had a kid and they were jaded. I can't explain it. And so fucked up was, it was a, it was like a 20, 25 minute ride from where I lived, which was a world away with no traffic. Of course with traffic, it took like a fucking hour to get there. But uh, yeah, I just remember shooting the shit with them and they'd be, oh, you like smash.

Speaker 9:          01:14:51       But anyways, those are my two recommendations for this week. Get up, get the book John Bonham, the powerhouse behind led Zeppelin by Mick Bonham and uh, go see the fighter. I'm going to see true grit this week and if someone's trying to talk me into going to see Toronto, but I, I just, I could give a shit about science fiction. I've never been into it. I never liked star trek. I, I liked star wars for maybe six months in my youth just because everybody else liked it and I wanted to fit in. So I kinda got into by just, I don't give a shit. I think those movies, they're gay, they're gay. All right there. I said it all right. You know, you've put on the afterburners, oh, I'm doing the best I can hit warp speed and this stupid fucking handshakes, Eh, and the, the aliens that they're friends with and the gay names of the fucking space ships that they ride around in.

Speaker 9:          01:15:49       And it's just, it's, it's, it's for nerds. It's for people who don't know how to get laid. I don't know. That's not true, but it just, the stereotype is true. And speaking of which, I wanted to read this, this overrated for this week when, um, it's just reminded me of this. Somebody wrote overrated Las Vegas. Somebody wrote a, I'm tired of everybody going to Las Vegas all the time. They throw that shit around. Like they're going like, they're getting a free trip to a space station. Like, Yo, anybody want to go to Vegas this weekend? Like, it's just the wildest, craziest place. It's not Vegas fucking stinks. It's really not that big a deal there. It's too hot. The drive sucks. How do they not widen out that 14? It's actually the 15 or whatever to be more than two lanes. Yeah, that's the highway. And when you come back on Sunday, it's a fucking nightmare.

Speaker 9:          01:16:41       Always flying to Vegas. Never drive unless you plan on leaving at two in the fucking morning. He said, uh, the other big thing I'm tired of with Vegas is the media perception that it's the craziest place on earth that you never know what kind of nutty shit is going on. And it's like that every day of the year. You should just go wild there. Go home with three strippers, party like crazy with your boys and wake up with the most insane story ever. It's like that the hangover. It's like that Song Waking Up in Vegas from Katy Perry. Woohoo. Yay. Let's go crazy. Um, well I'm sorry to burst your bubble. That doesn't really happen there folks. The 50s and 60s or over, not much that that's hip and happening goes on there. Uh, you don't see Sinatra and dean coming out to deal blackjack and drink with the common folk unless you're bringing in sick a six figure salary.

Speaker 9:          01:17:36       It's actually pretty mundane. It's mostly full of sad old people blowing their social security, her social security checks on slot machines and shit and lousy food and ugly tourists with their stupid kids placed the places like Disneyland with gambling and God help you. If you wake up with a hangover, it's generally 117 fucking degrees out. You walk out of Your Hotel and God, Vegas is not supposed to be. It's supposed to be this out of control party place. It's not. You want a story? Give Charles Manson a tab of acid and a meat cleaver and let them loose on the strip on a Friday night. You'll have a crazy Vegas story. Fuck that place. All right, well sir, I 100% agree and disagree all at the same time. See, what you did is you went there and you just looked at what you saw like I did the first time I went there.

Speaker 9:          01:18:30       I walked there and I was all dressed up to do my shows, like I was going to be in the fucking rat pack and I saw all these fucking fat tourists with their flip flops and going, wow, Vegas is dead. It isn't. You just don't know where to look. First of all, you ever see those pretty girls playing slots, you know, and you're like, why is that pretty girl all by herself playing slots? How come she doesn't have a boyfriend? That's because she's a hooker, sir. You want to have your crazy fucking day. You go right there. Did you like me? First Time I went to Vegas, I thought a hooker was, you know, standing on a street corner snapping her gum. Hey, like that was a hooker. All right. But no, they, they, they're not supposed to be in the casino, but they look the other way.

Speaker 9:          01:19:19       All right. And I was actually at a bar one time and Jimmy Dore told, and I'm sitting there hitting on this girl and Bill Jimmy finally came out and goes, Bill, what the fuck are you doing? I was like, what? This girl's hot. He goes, dude, you're hitting on a hooker. And I was like, she's a hooker. And he goes, yes. And then all of a sudden it was like the Matrix. I could see it. And then I went, oh, she's a hooker. There's a hooker, there's a regular girl, regular girl hooker. And you all of a sudden you could fucking see it. Your problem is you don't know how to see it yet. Put it this way. I just did a road gig with somebody and he told me his story. He went to Vegas, he won nine grand, walked up to one of those girls, said, hey, come here.

Speaker 9:          01:19:58       And she stopped playing slots, walked right over to him. He goes, I want another girl like you, uh, to uh, suck my dick. Come up to a whatever, 10 52. And they did. And they came up there and they were gorgeous and they sucked his dick and he came on their face and he won nine grand that night. So they, you go, it is a crazy, awesome fucking place where shit can happen if you indulge. All right. If you stand back like a fucking, you know, just shitting all over the place. The, yeah, you're not going to have a good fucking time. It is cheesy. It is awful. Um, there are a bunch of, you know, they got malls there now. They tried to appeal the families. All of that shit definitely goes on there, but believe me. All right. I mean, I don't think you can go to Fox woods and just go, hey, you and you, I mean, I give them probably do it, but they're going to be old ladies.

Speaker 9:          01:20:48       Um, it even there. I'm sure they have their hookers. All right. But of course they do. But I'm telling you, go there next time you go there. Alright, just look for those pretty girls playing slots and you will have an, all of a sudden Vegas will become, they just can't show. They can't show that in the commercial. You know what was that Fox? The Fox who was on that too bad. That baby does suck my fucking Dick. You remember that corner? I forget how it goes. That whole thing about being at Foxwoods, like it's this crazy thing. You can't show somebody when nine you can show that then winning nine grand, but you can't show that other part where he goes, hey, you find another one just like you who's dad didn't stick around. So now you suck Dick for living. Get another one of those.

Speaker 9:          01:21:39       Come back to my room and then end the commercial bang. Boom. Xiao was, he fucking comes on their faces. Okay, you're supposed to read between the lines. All right, so what I would do is I would stop going to Vegas with the fucking nerds that you're going to Vegas with. You know? I mean you're, you're going to Vegas, dude. You're trying to solve the transportation problem. You're talking about the highways. You, you, you're not looking at the right shit, you know? Yes. Frank and dean are not going to be dealing pope. Yeah, they're dead. They're dead. Okay. Yes. Move on. Ashton Kutcher is going to be there dressed like James Bond taking. I fucking hate those commercials. I envy that guy's career. You know, I really envy that guy's career. He's smart. Son of a bitch. Most people do a hit fucking sick, common, and that's it.

Speaker 9:          01:22:26       He got into producing very smart guy, but I hate those fucking commercials with him sitting there with the stupid cameras and everybody's just enamored with him. Look at the guy with the camera. Wait, we all have cameras and one in our phone. This really isn't that exciting. Um, so there you go. Surf. I know I trashed you, but go to Vegas again. Okay. Fucking pony up the fucking 70 bucks and fly out there on southwest. Go down to the strip. Okay, gamble. Hopefully you win. If you don't, you know, even if you don't, to save a little money and have a couple of girls blow your cum on their face and I'm guaranteeing you, you're going to go home with a smile, even if you have to sit in that traffic on the 15. Hey listen, I know there's a lot of people listening to this podcast and went to Vegas.

Speaker 9:          01:23:15       I want to hear some stories and don't make them up. All right? I want to get some actual goddamn stories, okay? And I'll see through the bullshit ones unless you're a really good storyteller. Okay. Because the truth is in the details. Uh, look at me talking shit like fucking Rex Ryan. Oh wait a minute. Did the jets loose again this week? Oh, isn't that funny? Isn't that funny? It's almost like exactly what I said was gonna happen. Fucking happened. You know, and I know a lot of you guys, you probably can't remember cause you know, you know, nobody can remember shit in this country. Like I used to do a bit about that Geico Lizard, how, you know, everybody loves that fucking thing. And I just look at that thing like that thing has no credibility whatsoever. When those commercials started out, he's like, no, I'm a Gecko. All right, get away from me. Fuck you. And your insurance company. Then all of a sudden he liked fucking sold out. Now he sells the insurance and no one calls him on the bullshit. Well this is my fucking a Geico Gecko lizard moment. Here's Rex Ryan. I'll play two clips. This is rex Ryan on hard knocks back in August. Let's hear what he has to say about his football team, which started my hatred of the fucking jets. Here we go, everybody. Let's turn up the volume. Here we go.

Speaker 10:         01:24:27       If we play at our best, we will be every team in this fucking league playing at their best. So who's it on? Whose shoulders as it? Bob.

Speaker 9:          01:24:39       There you go. Could you hear that? Sorry, I just fucked with the volume here. Ready to crank that up. All right. That's what he said. We will beat every team. He played up beds. We could beat every fucking team and his fucking league. You know the usual bullshit. Okay. For those of you forgot. All right. Now here's him yesterday when they backed into the fucking playoffs like they did last year. Here we go.

Speaker 10:         01:25:01       That's the way I think we're in class. God, dog. It ain't the way I wanted it, but I'll take it.

Speaker 9:          01:25:11       Hello? Hello? You fucking, yeah. What happened? Rex fucking dope. I swear to God was was I was. There's no reason for me to even bring it up, but I have to bring it up. Okay. That's the second major thing that I was right about in football this year, and as much as you fucking hate to admit it, you know I'm right. I told you Peyton manning was fucking overrated. I told you it was a regular season. Statistical Juggernaut. He threw a pick six the lose the fucking super bowl and he has yet to get shit for it yet to get shit for it. It's fucking volume is way too high. I'm sorry, let me bring this down here. He is yet to get shit for it. All right, and I told you I didn't, I didn't understand what the jets were talking about. I didn't understand why they felt like they were the shit.

Speaker 9:          01:25:59       You know, was it last year that they made the playoffs because the cult sat half their fucking team wasn't it? Wasn't it? That wasn't last year, isn't that how they got into the fucking playoffs then this year they come in just talking all this shit. Now look, I'm not saying that they couldn't go on any team in the NFL at this point. If you get hot in the end of December, you can actually go on a run and win the fucking super bowl like the giants did. All right, that's another fucking hilarious thing. The giants losing again this week and now they're questioning whether Tom Kauflin is worthy to coach that team, that team, that Amir two fucking years ago or three years ago beat an undefeated team. 14 point underdogs. What did the game suddenly pass Tom Kauflin by at two and a half fucking years. The York, this is a different story in New York and Boston.

Speaker 9:          01:26:47       Boston Jay is completely 100% negative and they'll give you a little bit of positive and the second they see negative, they're like, the curse is back. They're awful that way. But New York, they kind of do the ESPN thing with a hype shit through the roof and say this is going to be the greatest fucking thing ever. And then when it doesn't happen, then they go the exact opposite way and then it then and then just somebody is the worst fucking thing that ever happened in the Goddamn sport. And that's why mediocre guys like mark, Mark Sanchez, who never really did anything in fucking college foot. What did he do? He won the fucking Rose Bowl with that team that had won the national championship. I know there's a turnover of players, but give me a break. Matt Lionheart did more than that fucking guy and he's not even in football anymore. I think he's playing in like the fucking CFF CFL. Right.

Speaker 9:          01:27:40       So there you go. People, but I will tell you this, I uh, I do back Rex Ryan on his foot fetish video. I don't think there's anything fucking wrong with dad. He's got a foot fetish. He made a video. I totally agree with him. It is a private matter and uh, you know, the guy loves his wife. That's what I got out of it. I didn't think he was a Weirdo. I think that was just one of those classic fucking examples of every yet buddy out there throwing sticks and stones and all this fucking shit. When we all have these skeletons in our, in our closet. Does anybody else want to turn over their fucking hard drive, their computer hard drive and let the FBI go through it and look at all the fucked up shit that you've looked at on the internet. Give me a fucking break.

Speaker 9:          01:28:18       I'm a freak just like him. I'm not into feet. You know some of the horrific shit that I've looked at on the internet. I'm going to fucking judge this guy. Then the end they, he kissed, kept going. It's a personal matter. I'm not going to talk about it. You can ask me 16 ways to Sunday. It's a personal matter and I was like, that's exactly right, rex. It's exactly fucking right. It's your own fucking life. It's a personal matter. I'm not talking about it. Go fuck yourselves. I don't give a shit that it's on the Internet. It's none of your goddamn business. Watch the video if you want. I don't give a fuck. Then they go, can you please talk about your wife? And he goes, yeah, what can I say it then with the for 23 years, I love her. She's awesome. I was like, you know what?

Speaker 9:          01:28:55       This guy's a great dude. And I realized that I was wrong saying that he was going to make an attempt on his life one day because he has, because he has a great woman in his life and that's, that's what's holding that man together. And uh, told you, I told you once, psycho can spot another psycho from across the rumps that God blessed Rex Ryan and his fucking foot fetish, 23 years, he still fucking got the hots for his wife is making freaky videos about that. That was the shit gave me hope. That's what it did. It gave me hope. I don't think that guy's a freak at all. And that's like that tiger woods shit. And everybody sat there judging him. Eh? People are full of Shit. You know, just listen to that quiet voice in the back of your head that's calling you a hypocrite.

Speaker 9:          01:29:39       When, when you're at the dinner party trash and tiger woods, you know, when you think of some of the shit that you've, you know that you rubbed one out to your wife's sister, Huh? What if that ever got, I wonder if there was fucking video of that. You fucking fucking rub one out to your wife's fucking sister and we could see the fucking video that's playing in your God damn head. Really? You're going to judge this guy cause he's into feet. I don't judge him for that Shit. I do judge them for being a shit talking jackass who sounds like one of my moron buddies at a fucking sports bar. I will trash him for that. So with that, who do you guys think is going to win the Superbowl? Because I, for one have no fucking idea. I have no faith in my team.

Speaker 9:          01:30:20       I don't even know who they already more, they'll let my, my patriots, they like a drug addict, you know, are they clean? Are they cleaned this week? And they're going to play, they're gonna play fucking defense. Are they just gonna? Uh, I dunno. I Dunno. And I don't like that, that we basically showed a loss to the fucking packers. Uh, but Aaron Rodgers was out and even then, we still should have fucking loss, but they didn't manage the clock. Right. And, uh, you know, we lost to the jets once jets could come in and beat us, they could still come in and beat us in our own fucking place. I mean, that's still kind of way football is right now. So, which is why I don't understand the whole rex Ryan shit-talking that's what it was about. So there you go. Let's see. Let's move on to something else here.

Speaker 9:          01:31:05       Let's go with advice. Uh, Bill. Hey, I just want to write you and say I got let it go for Christmas. Um, I really needed it to, my girlfriend dumped me on Christmas Eve. Uh, so you know, my Christmas suck, but your DVD really helped me out a lot last night. I know what you say about breakups. Six weeks of pain and then it gets easier. I said we were together for nine months and out of the blue on Christmas Eve, she called me up and said she needed time for herself and her daughter. That makes it tough too. I got really close to her kid. Here's my question. What's the worst breakup you've ever had? And have you ever, have you ever been dumped over the holidays? All right, there's a number of things going on here, sir. First of all, uh, that's a real honest move on her part.

Speaker 9:          01:31:52       You know, that whole fucking thing where you just go through a Christmas cause you don't want to hurt somebody's feelings. You know, it's, there's no good time for a break. And she just could not go through the phoniness of celebrating Christmas with you when she knew she was going to fucking drop. The other shoe of that fucking expression goes. So I gotta give her props for being fucking honest. But uh, and then also, do you know, you can do better than hooking up with some chick already has a kid. And I hate to be mean. I'm not trying to trash women out there who have fucking kids in this single, in that type of shit. But I'm trying to give this guy something positive. All right? You know, it's like, yeah, you got it. You got it down to six weeks, it's going to suck.

Speaker 9:          01:32:33       This is what you want to do. Just go to the gym, go to the fucking shit. This is what women do. Women fucking cry it out with their friends. They get out of this system and then they go to the fucking gym and the next time you run into them, they want you to have that moment. Why the fuck did I dump? You went, guys, we never do that. What do we do? We get fucking drunk. Get a big fat fucking John Travolta head and then go out and try to bang some skank at three in the morning. Don't do that to yourself. All right? Just know it's going to hurt and fucking, you know, go for spoon with your pillow and cry it out and then go to the fucking gym. Put on some music that's gonna motivate you. Go see that movie the fighter.

Speaker 9:          01:33:15       All right, go get fucking motivated. We'll do that shit. And then, uh, then just go out and just start hitting on chicks at a completely way out of your fucking leak. And, uh, you know, just go talk some shit. And then he got the out. I'm not ready to be in a relationship. I got broken up with on Christmas fucking eve. I'm not even trying to talk to women. You do that. You fucking do the reverse sell you backing up, they're walking towards your Dick. That's how you do it. You know, you'll get a sympathy, blowjob or some just open your fucking mouth. Don't be negative. Keep them fucking laugh and spent a couple of plates. Something will happen for you. Next thing you know, he'd be like, Wow dad, that I almost get involved with the fuck. I almost was thinking about getting married to some woman already had a fucking kid, you know, who's never really gonna consider you her dad.

Speaker 9:          01:34:03       It's going to have a bunch of issues and a dad's not going to be around when, when her daughter goes through her her slot years, cause she's trying to find another father figure. You don't want to be around for that shit. You did. All right. So anyways, he said, here's my question. What's the worst breakup you've ever had and have you ever been dumped over the holidays? Uh, worst breakup I ever had was I broke up with this girl who then ended up stalking me. She told me she was pregnant. Uh, I believed her. I got back into her life. And then obviously I've realized, you know, when she was never showing that she wasn't pregnant. Yeah. I had one of those, just a complete fucking psycho with stock me at my day job and all that. She was a fucking nightmare. Um, had one those and have ever been dumped over the holidays. No, I haven't. I've mainly been the person, uh, that's dumped people. But I did get dumped, uh, the fuck did I get dumped? It was in September. Yeah. It was September. September. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          01:35:18       Yeah. And it was, it sucked. It was fucking brutal. And I did the dumb shit. I went out and I drank and um, I didn't that, that's, you know, something that's the basis of my advice that I give you guys when you, men are women when you go through a breakup, is just allow yourself to know that it's gonna suck. Yes. It's going to suck. Yes. You're gonna come home. The phone isn't going to ring and you're going to be sitting there trying to put the pieces back together going, what the fuck did I used to do with all this extra time and just go through that is the best thing that I can tell you in fucking embrace it and just know it's going to hurt. And uh, that's the best advice I can give you because I did not do that. The worst thing you want to do was go out, start booze and shot a bank, somebody else, and then go into a fucking rebound relationship.

Speaker 9:          01:36:10       I did that a couple of times. It's fucking brutal. It's not what the fuck you want to do. So, uh, I know we had a cup of questions. Somebody I keep getting questions about on the opiate Anthony show a Patrice O'Neal and a Kevin Hart talked about this detrashing that I took and uh, it was a long fucking time ago. I haven't listened to the audio yet. Uh, just look it up on Youtube. I'm sure they have the audio up, uh, without even listening to the audio. Whatever they said is more than truth. It was an epic 50 fucking minute trashing that I took. Um, what the fuck was his story? St at the comedy cellar. All right, how do I go to, where do we start to see the Yankees were playing the Braves in the fucking world series and I guess it was deuce. These groups of people from Atlanta wanted to, uh, we're going to take, that's right.

Speaker 9:          01:37:05       They were taking two buses to Yankee stadium to go to the game and they wanted a comedian to perform on the bus on the way to the stadium. All right. Which obviously is the most nightmare gig ever. They were going to pay you like 500 bucks and give you a world series ticket. All right? So that the Gig was offered to meet like SD was like, who's the two biggest sports fans I know we don't hear. And so she offered an, and actually don't have enough money in the bank will actually consider doing this. So she approached me and Jim Norton about the Gig. So me and Norton are just talking about it going through, this is going to be the worst fucking Gig ever. But you get to go to the world series and we were both thinking about it. So the next day over 24 hours Norton and just goes, fuck that.

Speaker 9:          01:37:51       I'm not doing it. So I was going to do it. I was like, fucking, I mean it's not gonna be that bad a gig. That's the thing about it. It wouldn't have been that bad a gig. I basically was going to get paid to go to a world series game and to get paid to do what the fuck I was going to do anyways, which is trashed the Yankees all the way up to Yankee stadium. That's the only part about the story. That's bullshit is them talking about what a horrific gig it would have been. It would have been a fucking cake walk compared to those college gigs I did where they didn't have a fucking microphone and they stand you in a hallway. It would be a bunch of drunk fans, excited to see their team that didn't have a shot in fucking hell.

Speaker 9:          01:38:31       A beating the Yankees and all I was going to do was tell him what a fag Jeter was for fucking 30 minutes, a half hour fucking set would have been a joke. All I would have to do is trashed the Yankees the whole fuck away up. I get 500 bucks and I get a world series ticket and the second I get off, I can screw. I can leave those guys and they get to go to a world series game and fucking Yankee Stadium. So I'm like, I'm going to fucking do it. Right. So I didn't know that Jim had said that he wasn't going to do it. So we're sitting down there at the table down at the cellar and it's starting up. Everybody's giving each other shit. So I start giving Norton Shit about whatever, about as chinless face, uh, his little ears or whatever, fucking awful hooded sweatshirt that he was wearing. And then I got him with a couple of jabs and he felt the overhand right come in and he needed to stop it. And he just goes, whatever, bus boy. And it was like ef Hutton. Everybody fucking stopped and went, what, why did you just call them busboy? And I immediately was like, he's going do it too.

Speaker 9:          01:39:35       And Somehow Jim got out of it and just, he literally threw me under the bus and then they found out I was doing the Gig. And it just so happened that night that all the fucking, the big boys where there was Patrice Norton was there, Kevin Hart, Rich Vos, Keith Robinson, right fucking there, the Tyson Holyfield, George Foreman, all of that. And I'm standing there like fucking a tex Cobb. And I took a 50 minute, I took a headlining set, killing, standing ovation set of shit for doing that Gig. And I was still going to do it. I was still going to do it even after the fucking trash. And cause I'm thinking I'm going to the fucking world series. I don't give a shit, you know. And Patrice was trashing me and I didn't give a fuck what he said. His advice I never would've listened to because Patrice was one of the biggest pussies when it came to performing hell gigs. Like when we used to do colleges, uh, this guy used to book us on colleges and it would be me, him and Robert Kelly or meet him in Norton or whatever. And this dude never wanted to go on first cause first sucks because you've got a warm up the crowd and he never wanted to go on last because you had to follow the other two acts. He

Speaker 4:          01:40:53       always wanted to go on second and he a and then he'd go on second and he would go over his fucking time like the selfish country is. And uh, so I was just thinking, Hey, you know this guy, this guy fucking a, this guy retires from comedy every two weeks when he sees a hack kill on stage. I don't give a fuck what he thinks. But it was, it wasn't until the end when he actually looked at me when the trashing was over and he said, Bill, he goes, I will stand in front of that bus. Don't do that Gig. I'll buy you a ticket to the world series. Don't do that. And then I was sitting there going like, wow, this is actually like, he's not even joking right now. He's trying to tell me for the love of God, have a little bit of self fucking worth. And he shit. That was the thing. After a 50 minute trashin isn't as embarrassing as that was, nothing was worse than the shame of him telling me that I could actually afford a world series ticket. At that point, I wasn't really even thinking that.

Speaker 4:          01:41:56       So I decided in that moment I decided not to do the Gig, which I don't think came out on the opiate Anthony show. They think I did the Gig. I never did the Gig. And I actually passed it off to another comedian who was further down the ladder than I was. And uh, he didn't even ask me, but I always made a promise that I would never say who did the Gig. And uh, I don't know. Next time I go on opion Anthony, I'll talk to the dude who actually did the Gig and see if he wants to call in and talk about the Gig. But that's the only, I haven't listened to the audio yet, but whatever jokes that they said, there was some classic ones. I remember Portree say, well, hey bill, when they bring you up, are you going to come out of the bathroom? Are you going to walk up up those little stairs?

Speaker 4:          01:42:43       That and then also me finishing my set. Go and hey, thanks a lot. And then I sit down in the bus seat and then look over my shoulder and shake everybody's hands as they go to get off the bus. Was I going to fucking hold the, uh, you know, the bus intercom thing, what I do it over that Yada, Yada, all that and fit and this will kill me. They had jokes for 50 fucking minutes. All that was true, but I never did the Gig. I never did the GIC and a, and I still maintain, it wouldn't have been that bad of a fucking Gig. It wouldn't have. But what have been a joke, bill? Get on a bus for a half an hour and trash the Yankees. Do you think he can do that? We'll give you 500 bucks in a world series ticket. Absolutely. I would have been drinking with them at anytime.

Speaker 4:          01:43:24       I ran out of shit to talk about the Yankees. He just look out the bus, hey look at the tits on that fucking whore and they'd all go nuts. All I had to do is support the south in the civil war. There was so many different ways that I could then what it would have been a fucking cakewalk of fucking cake walk. And I didn't end up doing it. I didn't end up doing it, which actually was better because the first time I went to a world series ended up being a, I went to game two with a 2004,

Speaker 9:          01:43:53       that boring ass world series. But it was exciting cause we finally won it. So they, he goes to that. That is the story. Yes. They trashed the shit out of me, but I never did the Gig. I was shamed out of doing it and I gave it to another comedian who will remain nameless. Actually, you know what, here, let me, let me do a little cross promotion here. Uh, I will reveal the name the next time I do the opie and Anthony Show. If they still give a fuck, if they still give a shit, if the story has legs as they say in the business. So a, so there you go. There's that fucking story. All right. And I'll try to remember the name of this podcast in case it gets so many, a couple of more questions about it and I'll just say refer to the podcast on December 27th.

Speaker 9:          01:44:33       Um, all right you two videos of the week. Um, these are all going to be on the [inaudible] podcast.com. You can watch all of these uh, the so called white man. Somebody sent a great video of somebody they do, didn't have a microphone but he was, he was talking about all how the white man, you know, is fucking with everybody the way he twisted up religion and all that shit, which is totally true. But in the end he goes, cause God is actually a black man. So basically it's like everything that white people just did. I am now going to do from my perspective, which is the one thing that I've learned when I being on the road that everybody is the same and it includes the bad shit.

Speaker 9:          01:45:15       You know that liberal thought that you know everybody is the thing, but it's only good shit. Everybody has the ability to be a scientist, to be a doctor. You know a fucking teacher. Everybody has. Yes, yes they do and they also have the ability to be a fucking CEO at Enron to be a rapist and to be a fucking serial killer and all the bad shit. Everything to be a war criminal, a fucking dictator, everybody that is not, that is not an exclusively white thing because white people get blamed for evil. Like we're the only evil ones in the planet. We are not. We are just the best at it. We are the Michael Jordans of evil. Everybody.

Speaker 9:          01:45:59       I challenge your race to top my race with the evilness, but you got it in you. You got to know that. All right. You got to know that you have in, in you the same way you have it in you to be a doctor or a lawyer or a teacher. You also have it in you to be a, a, a complete fucking sociopath. Uh, so there's, there's, there's my fucking 2 cents. All right. Clumsy report or knocks down. Uh, I don't even know how to say Jenga Tower and he wanted this leaning tower of Pisa. Uh, Fva tow rope fail. This is somebody towing their friend's car down the street with a rope and it doesn't go that well. Merry Christmas bitch. Need I say more Harvard sailing team. Boys will be girls and on from funny or die drunk history. And I think it, I think that's it for the podcast.

Speaker 9:          01:46:52       This has been a very long one. I Gift Card really quick. Let me read this gift card, Dude. What is your deal with gift certificates? This guy right here is the exact reason why I don't like gift certificates. Would you rather get some shitty sweater or boxer beast from your aunt or brother in law or a gift certificate from Amazon or best buy where you could buy something. You actually like, Hey, fuck head. Why don't you not go out and buy a shitty sweater? A boxer briefs. See you on creative content. Maybe you should give out a gift card. That's why I don't like it because you know, it's like you're out there and you buy somebody a great fucking gift and then they go, hey, you go shop for yourself. Fuck face. It's lazy. That's why. That's why I don't fucking like it. I don't mind it.

Speaker 9:          01:47:32       If I get, if we both agree to get each other gifts certificates, I don't mind that when I'm out there actually trying to buy you a fucking coolest gift and you come up with that, you just write me a check. You know like I'm some drunk whore going to say you fucking son raped somebody and you're running for Senate and you need the problem to go away. That's why I don't like it. So go fuck yourself. I'm all right. Revenge. I got to read this quickly here. Um, which is gonna cause all kinds of problems. Uh, all right. I went to a local junior college, oh wait a second, I jumped in too far. Uh, this may be more of a story of lashing out than revenge. I actually think this is a story of revenge and I like the story cause this is eyeball to eyeball even though it was a little off Samuelson here.

Speaker 9:          01:48:14       Uh, my senior year I dated a beautiful underclassmen. She was my first love and firstly we dated through the summer. After graduation I went on to a local junior college. Um, the next year, Jesus Christ shop class guy right here. All right. Uh, we were still dating when school started up the next year. I had a lot of friends that were still in high school and one of my friend's friends told me that he started seeing my girlfriend hanging out at school with another good friend of mine. Uh, my girlfriend was acting shady, so I knew something was up. Um, for years during the football season, a big group of guys would get together on Sundays and play a game of tackle football. Uh, this guy who was seen with my girlfriend was among the guys that showed up to play with me though to play with the, uh, everybody. Me and this guy, this other guy, you name it all names.

Speaker 9:          01:49:02       I'm trying to skip over the names here. Me and this other guy would normally play Qb, so we would be the two to pick teams each week. Um, the quarterback on the other team was also a good friend of mine. The friend of mine, all these fucking names here, the friend of mine who was messing with my girl didn't know that. I was aware that he and my girl had been flirting at school. So I asked my buddy, the QB on the other team to pick this Douche who's messing with my girl. And at some point during the game, send them in on a hard five. And in I, I don't know what that, is that like a postpaid, I guess that's a crossing pattern and lead them high. He's basically going over the middle. He's gonna throw them, throw the ball high and just out of his reach, leaving this guy completely exposed.

Speaker 9:          01:49:48       So anyways, he goes a few plays into the game. They come out of the huddle and my buddy, the QB on the other team gives me a look. He goes, I called a two one two defense. Jesus Christ, the most professional pickup football game ever. So I bring in the nickel defense. I had to call a timeout because we had too many men on the field. I call it a two one two defense and took the short ride zone. The ball was snapped and this douche bag who's flirting with my girl came off the line, took a hard left and in slow motion, ran into my zone. I delay one or two seconds and begin the path to the collision. My buddy let him perfect. So he had to pick up a little speed to get to the ball and he extended both arms to the sky. And of course he's looking back at the quarterback to Jesus Christ. The second the ball hit his hands. I bury my shoulder into his stomach. I grabbed the back of his knees and I pull up and drive them into the ground.

Speaker 9:          01:50:54       Now I can't define the word squelched, but he definitely let out a sound that old that I can only describe as squelched. Uh, yeah, it really that, that word makes it sound like you actually hit a really ripe melon. The entire field erupted with a holy shit. My little league coach would have given me two stars on my helmet for this fucking hit. I felt good about it for about three seconds and the than the remorse, and I feel bad to this day for setting this guy up the way I did. It took a few minutes for him to get up. Uh, but he was fine. I don't know about Karma, but a few weeks later, uh, this dude that he drilled into the ground was banging his ex girlfriend and I met my rebound that I dated for the next five years. She turned out to be the devil or herself.

Speaker 9:          01:51:43       I might not believe in God, but I've hooked up. I've looked the devil in her evil eye as I shot a load into her evil cunt. Jesus Christ. Um, I don't think Karma got you. I think, uh, he was going banger no matter what. And I think he got a nice shot in there. Um, it was a little cheesy that you had your friends set them up, but uh, but fuck him. That's what he gets. That's your girl. He shouldn't have been doing that. He was wrong. You were right. And uh, as far as Karma goes, I view Karma is like, uh, what's that shit where you look at the stars to see if you're going to get a chicken sandwich that day. What do you call it? Is it astrology? Astronomy is the study of stars. Astrology. Yeah. Like I don't believe in astrology. You know, and anybody who does, you go, okay, you believe in it. I, you just go, what's your sign? And I, and they tell you this sign and then read somebody else's horoscope. If they're a gem and I read a Taurus and the garden, how does that pertain to your life? The, okay. It means

Speaker 4:          01:52:46       this, this, and this. And Go. Yeah, see that was Taurus. So there you go. You can fucking, this is so vague. You can attribute it to anything. Something wonderful is going to happen today. Just be careful. You don't close it off or it won't happen. So then if something wonderful doesn't happen, yeah, then walk while I, I must've been closed off. I need to be more open and then they get off Scott free. Right? I feel the same way about Karma. Karma is something that if you, there's ups and downs in life, okay? And if you just, you're waiting for something bad to happen, something bad is going to fucking happen. No matter how good you are, something bad's going to fucking happen. You know, buy brand new pair of sneakers, someone's going to step on him. You know, you're like, why I starve a fucking, I starve.

Speaker 4:          01:53:30       I sponsor a starving child. I don't fuck around. I'm a good guy. Why did somebody step on my sneaker? Because the world is full of content. It's impossible not to run into him. You know, I think Karma exists if you believe in it. I think if you don't believe in Karma, like you never really, you don't really have any bad shit happen to you. There you go. That's what I think about Karma. I am an hour and 17 fucking minutes into this podcast. Ladies and gentlemen, I think it's time to watch to end the podcast here. I hope you enjoyed it. Hope you guys all had a very merry Christmas, a happy Kwanzaa, happy Hanukkah, or maybe it just said fuck it all. And I'm going to take a few days off and, uh, that is it. That's the podcast. Please, please. Oh, please. Well, the shows, they're all sold out.

Speaker 4:          01:54:15       So go scalp a ticket. I, speaking of Jim Norton, the man who threw me under the bus, and it took them 10 years to make up for it, actually made up for it when you put me on down and dirty and he hooked me up with opiate Anthony. Uh, but let's say I don't count those, you know, cause I'm into astrology. He hooked me up again with this awesome Gig, uh, that he does every year at the, uh, uh, fuck. I'm gonna screw this up down in Atlantic city. And this year he was like, you know what, why should I take it all for myself? Why don't I share it with some friends and I'm doing a show at the, the fucking casino down there and the Atlantic city. Why don't I know the name of it? Fucking internet doesn't work on my bedroom. Whatever. It's fucking sold out anyways, but it's me, Jim Norton, Jim Breuer and David Tell it's going to be a fucking unbelievable night at three shows.

Speaker 4:          01:55:03       If you can't make that, if you didn't get tickets, it's cause it's already sold out. Um, my next Gig is I'm going to be in Dallas, Texas on the final weekend in January, the week of the NFL pro bowl, the 27th, 28th, 29th, I believe. That weekend I'm going to be at the Improv in Dallas. I'm sorry, 28, 29 and 30 Improv in Dallas, Texas. Please come out. I got a brand new killer hour, uh, stuff. Uh, anything else? Oh, red sox fans are baseball fans and generally should check this out. Uh, Steve Gorman from the, uh, black Crowes has its own podcast. Of course, I don't have the fucking link because I'm an idiot. Steve Gorman sports sgs is the name of the podcast. Great podcast. He interviews Kevin Useless and uh, [inaudible] he just, he's got a great interview style where he just gets the other person to relax and he starts talking about just all kinds of cool shit.

And I am going to be stone fucking sober this year. I know you guys are all born right now cause you want to hear the happy drunk stories where I'm sick of being a drunk on that day. I would like to remember like I, I went to a game and Sanchez played the USC Penn State. I went to that game and I had never even heard of Sanchez. That's how drunk I was. So the thing that I could have been alive, booing that guy, I would've made a different seat. They still fucking killed the, uh, they still kill Penn state. All right? Whatever.
