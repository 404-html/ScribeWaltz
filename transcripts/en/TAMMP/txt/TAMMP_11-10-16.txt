Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's spill. Burn his time for the Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday, Monday morning podcast and Ah, I'm checking in on. Yeah, I'm just checking in on you. I really need to check in on you. At least half of you. A little less than half old jeans, shoes. Make sure you guys are right. There's a lot of crying going on out there. Jesus fucking Christ. I've never seen so many fucking adults crying in my life. What is with all the fucking crying? I get it. Your person didn't win, but Jesus Christ, you're making the left look horrible. Going to Canada. I love this shit where people like threatening like share, share goes, if Trump wins, I'm going to go to Canada. It's like, who gives a fuck? You know? I don't even know you were still here. Look, I'm not saying I'm happy. I wasn't happy with either one of these people. Right? Um, but the level of fucking arrogance of celebrities during all of this shit was just, it's such a, a whole other level. Do you realize how fucking arrogant you are that you're making this? You basically, you're threatening that if, if your candidate doesn't get in, your going to leave the country and your ego is so fucking big. You think somebody going like, well, I want to vote for Trump, but if he gets elected, we lose share.

Speaker 2:          00:01:38       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:01:38       I got you babe. The Fuck Outta here. Heard Barbara Streisand. Really? You're going to leave fucking Malibu to go live in Manitoba. Railey you fucking

Speaker 1:          00:01:53       go ahead and do it. I'll give you 40 bucks for your house. They don't only get yet that 9,000 fucking acres up there. Go ahead. Go, go, move up to yellow knife. The dumbest shit. But I literally think like that's the level of ego that you have to have as like an actor or a comedian or something like that. Literally too. I mean, I know, I guess I talk about it, but you know, I fuck around. I trashed replied now I told you guys who to vote for or whatever. I just trashed them both. I tried to evenly, but that fucking level that people take it to where they just start. Uh, you know, I kinda of was, I was on Conan last night, which was a, it was a really difficult show to do last night because, uh, you know, you know, people are like fucking stunned out here.

Speaker 1:          00:02:38       They can, they can't believe it, um, as, I can't believe it in San Francisco, Berkeley, fucking New York City and all that type of shit. Um, so it was kind of weird. I, it was like going on like right after a funeral. I felt so. Um, but, uh, I really think this is just my own opinion. What do you guys, what do you guys think about celebrities endorsing a, uh, a candidate? Because I think the candidates, they also kind of reach out to people a little bit. Like I, like, I, I've never understood that. Like, why would I be like, you know, who was some of the people, you know, some of the fucking people that have done it. Like I just, I just don't understand. It's, Oh you know I was going to vote this way. But the guy from my three kings told me to do all the other movie where he tries to get the sky miles. The Guy who did the movie about this guy getting the sky miles is telling me this should be the person to lead the free world. You know I got a lot of feelings are not gun control, but let me check in with Sean Penn first. See what he has to say.

Speaker 1:          00:03:45       The level of fucking arrogance

Speaker 3:          00:03:48       that you have to have. I don't know. It's a fine line cause it's like, all right, well it's good that they're involved politically, but like you know, there's a lot that once you're famous then they're actually going to put a camera on you, then you're going to start talking. You know, it's the same thing. It's when you become a huge fan of your team. You're, you're a big fan of your team, right? And you know, you're always sitting up in the nosebleeds and then all of a sudden you get a part on a Sitcom and then they got you sitting down there and then your team's doing well. And next thing you know, this sticking the microphone in the face of an actor, right? To be or not to be a, what do you think buffalo has to do here in the second half? Well, he took like to see you have your checking down a little bit. It's like,

Speaker 1:          00:04:31       I don't, I don't understand. I mean it's, you know what, in defense of celebrities, regular people do the same thing on the news and they get away with it cause you don't know what their names are. You see it all the time on these, uh, you know, when you watched the news, if he ever watched the news, they always go, yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:04:49       we went out on the street to ask people what they thought about this new target that's going on. I think it's going to take away jobs. You know what, just think to downtown area, we don't need that. There's always that fucker

Speaker 1:          00:05:01       Parson. Right. So maybe that's what it is. That's that person is no different than any of those other people. It's just, I don't know. I think once you get to a certain level, you kind of need to gracefully shut the fuck up.

Speaker 3:          00:05:16       All right. Having said that, has anybody explained to me why they're making such a big deal about the transition of power here is far as you know, we hope that it's going to be graceful and we hope that it's going to be the, when Obama came in, George Bush was very graceful, gracious. He was very blood. They all, they all were my entire life. I've never, you know, Reagan did knock on the White House door and Jimmy was just like, Hey, get the fuck out here.

Speaker 1:          00:05:49       There's literally camera's on. That's another thing too. There's cameras filming you as this transition happens. Everybody, everybody's always, you know, you're going to be grace gracious. They know we'll look, you know, they don't like each other. You know, this one's going to be particularly fucking weird, you know, considering the sizable overtly racist individuals that, you know, I don't know what the fuck they were here but they gravitated towards Trump. So considering, you know, Brock being the first black president to now let this guy into, I dunno, according to people I hear it. I don't, I mean fucking looked it up was endorsed by the client. This is just fucking nuts. Well that's it. That was the end. It's the end and now it's over and now everybody can fucking move on. And um, you know, I got, I, I did Conan last night. I think a, I think it went as well as it could have, have gone and then of course, you know, I get people giving me shit.

Speaker 1:          00:06:59       You know, I was trying to say, look, whoever is president, it's not really going to affect my fucking day to day. And then of course you, it's good you fucking white guy over there. It's like, yeah, I get it, I get it, I get it. But your day to day, your day to day, this is my, and this is supposed to be uplifting by the way. All right. Knowing full well that the world isn't fair. Okay. And that some people start Waif closer to the finish line than others. That's just how it is. All right. And there's advantages and disadvantages to that. You know, if you got to run further, you always think that other guy. Yeah, he's fucking, he's all he's got to do is just fucking go fright from there to there. Right? And you see all these fucking rich kids, they got drug fucking problems because they have no worries in life. That fucking right alerts and all that type of shit. Everybody wants to think if you filthy stinking fucking rich that you just skipped around and your life is fucking awesome. Um, I've done enough corporate gigs to see that there's not a lot of happiness over there.

Speaker 1:          00:08:01       They're fucking week really rich people. I got to tell you out in Malibu, you know, Neil always wants to go out to Malibu. She loves the fucking beach. And we go out there and his fucking, you know, the seaside restaurants and shit. You know, what's your cool, it's great. You're fucking watch people surfing. It's awesome. He go, you have a couple of crab legs and then you get the fuck out of there. But there's a mall over there. All right. The Malibu Mall, whatever the fuck. He go over there and I'm just telling you, the people over there, I cannot put my finger on it. They are fucking weird, really rich people. There's, there's some sort of fucking disconnect. I don't know what's going on with them. They just, I said to me, I go, what? What is, what the fuck is with these people? There's no vibe. There's no laughing, what's going on? And she just, she goes, the board.

Speaker 2:          00:08:49       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:49       That's what it is. I Dunno. I Dunno. I did gigs. Um, um,

Speaker 4:          00:08:55       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       Way Back in the day, I did some gigs out on the Hamptons, another place with like super rich people and they just fucking weird. They'd sit there and they all look at each other. They're looking you up and down. Like I showed up and immediately they would just like, all right, this guy's in here for the day is a day tripper. So look at his fucking sneakers. Uh, we'll get his fucking orange Afro. Nobody has red hair. Makes it in this world for them at Donald Trump on the fuck. Did he go from a Brunette to fucking look in like me in seventh grade? I don't understand it. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:09:27       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:09:28       Anyways, but yeah, you, you make your own fucking opportunity and I think, uh, it's depressing is that, is it, I always looked at that like a

Speaker 4:          00:09:39       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:09:40       I Dunno. I always try to see like what the fuck I can do. Um, I just can't believe the, all the names that I'm hearing now, if Jesus Christ, Newt Gingrich, Rudy Giuliani, these fucking guys are coming back. Jesus Christ, that's like that Stallone movie where he took all the fucking action heroes from back in the day Seagal and they all got to be level one last fucking thing. Unless it's a head that will make like three of them. What was that called though? Fucking last gladiator action. Hero to fucking, I dunno, drink your juice in the hood. I, what the fuck would they expendables. Yeah. This is like, he's bringing back, this is like the Republican expendables. He's bringing all these guys back trying to think of another classic name he's got to go for from way back in the day. Somebody didn't die, I dunno, whatever, but she knows something. It's over. Get on with your fucking lives. And uh, you know,

Speaker 4:          00:10:38       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:10:38       there's all these protests at colleges. I don't know what they're protesting. I don't quite get it. It's like there was an election. It was legal and your person lost. Um, I guess they're just voicing their displeasure with the fact that this guy's in there. I, dude, I cannot fucking believe that the host of the apprentice is now president of the United States and that people are this excited and hopeful. Half the country is excited and hopeful. You know what I mean?

Speaker 4:          00:11:05       Okay.

Oh, how much money is that gonna fucking cost? Who? The job that's going to create the fuck Outta here? That's a death. A government job. Do you know? Bet All of these fucking, you know something. That's

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       one thing that they'll never police, but that fucking bullshit. Where these contractors, they get these government jobs to build shit and they charge 10 times the amount that they should, and these politicians just throw the fucking money around and they don't give a fuck, or they have to do it. Whatever the deal is. You know, like the math on this whole thing. Do you realize like $7 billion was spent

Speaker 4:          00:12:19       okay

Speaker 1:          00:12:20       to get somebody a job that pays 500 grand a fucking year? You know why? Cause I bet it was, I bet it was a bunch of people that build forms, you know, foundations and shit. That's what, you know, they were like, oh man, I gotta get that. I gotta I gotta build the wall, man. You know, some go with the fucking rusted. I'll pick up truck, dude. If I get Jack Fuck a job, oh I love problems are going to be over. I'll be building that for the rest of my life. Um, what a fucking crazy God damn time. You know,

Speaker 1:          00:12:58       everybody wondering how the fuck this happened. I think you know what it is is people are still digging out of what happened in 2008 and it would have been nice if one of these fucking pussy politicians would have said something about the fucking bankers, you know? Um, I dunno. We will see what happens, but uh, yeah, boy. Oh boy. I'll tell you. You know, it was great though. It was when I went to go to the electors to vote I fucking head. I looked through all the fucking, uh, propositions, everything. I had all my, filled it all out, like a fucking old lady. And I went in there and I was just like, Bang, Bang, boom, boom, boom. I, I blew through the whole thing, knew exactly what I wanted to vote for, actually felt a mildly informed this time. Um, so he just showed up in his own fucking plank. This guy's a gangster. I'm literally, we shall see. You know what's funny is my wife had on MSNBC, by the way, you know what I was doing during the election. I just kept flipping back and forth to like, uh, who, if whoever was losing, I would start watching them. I would put on like CNN, you know, I put head on Fox at first in the beginning and once they started looking like they were winning and they were surprised, then I went over to a,

Speaker 1:          00:14:20       the CNN thing and then I went down to the comedy store and, uh, did Doug Stan hopes live podcast and a I, that was the most amazing election I've ever fucking seen. That it was like, it was riveting for hours. It never got boring. Um, and as much as I don't like Trump, I didn't like Hillary either. Uh, I have to say, watching people crying, um,

Speaker 1:          00:14:48       uh, white people, I wouldn't say white people. If I see somebody of crying, my God, Jesus, this is brutal, but just somebody white crying, it's like I'm still white in America. Um, there was just something funny about that to me, like people hugging and stuff. Um, blew my mind, blew my mind. How many people just still look at Hillary Clinton. Like she's not a complete dishonest piece of shit and like the best I could get anybody to say, he's like, yeah, but they're all like death. Um, all right. Are you guys done? I'm done enough with this shit. All right, let's watch the gracious, the Obamas, they, where they shook hands, they were very gracious. And this is what makes the United States, the United States, this, this peaceful passing of power. This is what makes the Americas, the United States of America.

Speaker 1:          00:15:44       I don't know why this is like such an amazing fucking thing. This is just like just a different head that's owned by the same what fucking 20 corporations out pill with your hacky conspiracy theory. But isn't it? Isn't that what it is? Well, isn't it? Um, anyways, let's move on everybody. Let's move on to a little bit of bread and circus there. Um, so this, guess what just went on sale? Everybody, um, as of yesterday, promoted it on, on the Conan show, uh, Conan O'brien show, um, the fifth annual Patrice O'Neal comedy benefit as always at the New York City Center. Uh, tickets are already on sale. Once we pay for the house. All the money goes to his, uh, his mother and his family. And, um, it's been such a great event that we do every year. And, um, and has had an amazing effect on, uh, on people's lives that he loved.

Speaker 1:          00:16:46       It's been a great thing. And, um, as I've said year after year, the reason why we do whatever years, cause I always hate when somebody, somebody passes and it's just like, you do like that one fucking benefit. Like, okay, here's a sack, a loot. I hope this will last you for the next 60 fucking years. Um, we all love poetry so much that we all decided that we were going to do it every year and um, make sure that, uh, we continued to take care of the people that he was taken care of and the people that he loved. So, um, it is, it is a great cause. It is 100% honest. It's something you can get behind. None of the comedians are going to be dressed in pink. None of that shit. You know, it'll be a, it'll be a great thing. And, um, I'm also doing a, the comp come home benefit with Denis Leary, Cam Neely, uh, this weekend and um, oh Jesus. Oh Jesus did fucking Billy red faced by some cigars. Holy fucking shit. I've never a smoked these before, but um, I'm not going to tell you where I got them. I'll see you.

And half of the country feels good about us. I can't fucking believe it. Uh, Jesus. You know what it is? It's just none of it is really that funny. It's just not funny. The whole thing was just how to fuck a on the right and the left people. How to fuck did we end up with those two? How did that happen? I just kept thinking back, but like all the fucking candidates just stunk. God, they stunk. That cutie pie in our camel hair coat. The fuck is she doing now? What are you talking about? I'm sorry, I got an MSNBC here. Where the hell is the God damn camera here? All right. There it is. There it is. Okay. It's Ah, fuck.

Um, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

Speaker 4:          00:19:13       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:19:14       Sorry. Sorry again.

It's like a fucking two hours smoke. I got a fucking box of those God damn things and bringing it to comics. Come home and I'm hoping there's going to be some cigar smokers there. Um, oh, it's going to be such a great event. Going to be a great event. So anyways, I have not been paying attention to shit, uh, been editing my new fucking special and a, I'm probably going to add another fucking standup date while I'm out here as I'm waiting for my kitchen to get done, which still has not done. It was supposed to be done by now, but then, you know, we ran into the cloth wiring, so, uh, you know, and then the place we were staying at the haunted fucking house, the person won't, it came back.

Speaker 1:          00:20:12       So now we're, we're in a hotel and uh, it has a little kitchen, right. So I keep saying the Nia, you know, it's fucking hilarious. It has this little kitchen and as pots and pans, but it has no spatula, had nothing that you could fucking cook with. It's hilarious. They just had like the pants and um, so I was like, oh, I see that fucking game plan. They're going to act like this, a kitchen and they're not going to give me any fucking shit. You know, they're gonna have a couple of props. It's looks like a Goddamn like sit-com kitchen. They've got a couple of glasses up front and then there's like nothing else. Even the cereal bowls I like so fucking shallow. It's like a, it's like a deep plate, you know, you pour a little bit of milk in. It's already going over the sides.

Speaker 1:          00:20:55       So I drove back to my house and got all my fucking tongs and spatulas and all that type of ship. And now I'm viewing it like, um, I'm going to try to beat them at their own game. Right. Because, you know, stay in the hotels. Fucking expensive, right?

Speaker 1:          00:31:00       You know what I mean? It's like you have a listen to led Zeppelin and then they did. They all just fucking, they're playing, they're playing. And then the song just stops and then they come back in again. And sometimes it's on time. Sometimes it isn't. And it's cause you know somebody just, yeah, it's a look that gives somebody look and then boom, you look at these fucking marine said they don't give each other a look. They still brought their fucking hand up at the same time. There's gotta be some sort of, some sort of marine, a little wiggle with an eyebrow. Granted we are like 40 yards away with the camera and then I'm sitting in a fucking hotel room.

Speaker 4:          00:31:31       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:31:41       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:31:43       it's gotta be some proud mom out there. That's my son. He's going to open the door. What was the last time a president with the toupee.

Speaker 4:          00:31:55       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:31:55       Was President. They've all had full heads of hair. All have full heads of hair. Hey ladies, who's going to be the next lady president? I mean, the next, the first one I should say. Do you think Hillary's done? Do you think she has enough pants? Suits for another run? You know, I dunno. I just hope she goes to a chiropractor and gets her fucking neck fixed because I dunno. She was like a baby, you know, I, you fucking, you know, babies can't hold their heads up. She kind of was fucking flopping all around. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:32:30       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:32:30       I love the pants suit though. You know what I mean? If I was a fucking chick of a certain age, you know what I mean? I had the kids already, you know, shut down

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       the park, if you know what I mean. You know, hot flashes, a rover, right? Wally world's closed for renovations, you know? Then you got to rock the fucking pants suit. You got to get the shorter fucking hair. Like, I don't give a shit anymore. You know, my husband's old. What's he going to do? He ain't going anywhere. And you go out, right? You get the Ellen degenerates haircut. He go out and you get a fucking pants suit walk around and some flatties for once in your life. You fucking concerned about your own comfort, you know? Ah Man. You know what? If I was Hillary, my next fucking move is what Johnny Carson had his own line of fucking sport coats. I would have my own line of fucking pants suits. Right? But you get people like Rihanna and people in the prime of their fucking life, they're like walking around half naked and they somehow, you know, they somehow turned the pants, suits. Who the fuck is is good looking enough in their twenties to make the fucking pants suit come back.

Speaker 4:          00:33:39       You know,

Speaker 3:          00:33:42       I, you know, I don't mind the pants suit when I was coming up the fucking, you know, Rhoda had them, Mary Tyler Moore had a, you know what I mean? And they will fucking young, broad sales sitting there as a little fucking fire, bald fucking freckled shirk off. And I would, why would watch all of those fucking Charlie's angels that they, we used to wear them for facet, killed the fuck a pantsuit, but the pantsuit back then was sorta like the diversion of the John Travolta suit. You know what I mean? It was just a bunch of ray on and no condoms in the 70s and that's, that's how we ended up where we're at. It's why the fucking Rhodes is so god damn filled up.

Speaker 4:          00:34:19       MMM.

Speaker 3:          00:34:21       Oh Jesus. To sound down on em, MSNBC right now, just looking at the looks on people's faces. I don't know why this shit is so funny to me because I am not thrilled with this guy being president. But seeing people disappointed and crying on television, you know, past, obviously if somebody they love died or something like that, I don't laugh at that shit. But like I told you, you guys way back in the day when the biggest loser was on

Speaker 3:          00:34:43       and those fat people would just start crying about how they could stop eating hamburgers and shit. It just fucking always, I mean, I wanted them to lose weight and shit, but this just something, this sump did fucking hilarious about. People cry, adults crying. I don't know why. It's probably me being a walled off, you know, I'm actually, I'm not that fucking walled up, walled off. Right. I can get choked up with the best of them, but if I did it, you know, I expect people to laugh at me. Um, this is when you know you have too much news coverage. I'm sitting here watching this marine opening and closing a door and these fucking nerd guys keep from the press. Keep walking in and out of the shot.

Speaker 4:          00:35:30       Okay,

Speaker 3:          00:35:30       look at this. There's a lady right now, she's backing up to take a picture with their cell phone of, I dunno what now the marines opening the door. She walks out.

Speaker 4:          00:35:41       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:35:41       You really, you know what? It was actually great that she was in there just to see.

Speaker 3:          00:35:50       Who the fuck just walked out of the place.

Speaker 4:          00:35:54       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:35:55       What was that like? His cousins or something.

Speaker 4:          00:35:59       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:35:59       That's such a weird gig. Does that mean you're a good marine?

Speaker 3:          00:36:05       But they make you like the fucking bell hop of the White House. I know. At the end of the day, I mean you went through all of that fucking trainee. You can snap somebody's neck, right? Can fucking shoot somebody from 200 yards away and then yeah. What? What should detail? You can open and close the back door at the White House and then what? Nah, that's it. You're going to be dressed in your formal, so you're going to have your whites on and you're just going to stand at fucking attention though. There's no way that anybody can do that. It's gotta be like two hours shifts. How long can you just stand there? That fucking straight. Yeah, but he's also got to be, if some lunatic comes fucking running up this, remember that guy jumped over the fucking fence and just ran up and he actually got into the fucking White House. That was unbelievable. That's when I really realized like how not important the president was. You know, once again, they don't even lock the door.

Speaker 4:          00:37:00       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:37:05       Do you understand that fucking ass all who jumped over that gate and ran up to the White House? Do you realize that that guy got further into the White House? Then he would've gotten into my house. My door is locked. Then he ran down the hall. He gave a head fake and he broke the ankles is some secret service guy. Right? Like I ever sent did the Jordan, when he first came into the league and he wouldn't rent the, he got like zigged instead of zagged. And that was the only reason why he didn't just fucking get in there.

Speaker 4:          00:37:38       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:37:38       It's really not funny, but you know, the fact that nothing happened, that's kind of fucking hilarious.

And just because you know your person didn't win, it doesn't mean you got to yell at other people. All right? You know, it'd be great is everybody, if everybody just sort of stop yelling at each other, okay. You know, maybe help each other out. You know, somebody actually said to me, you know, I'm a obamacare's going to go away. How to fuck am I going to pay for my meds? And that immediately made me think, wow, you know what? Why not regular people just pick up the slack, you know, I dunno how to fuck to do, it's what sets something up.

Speaker 3:          00:45:51       Or maybe you just help out one person where if you're in the prime of your life or your earning power or whatever, you know, and somebody down the street needs meds. You know what? If you booze a couple less times a fucking month and you hook them up with some money to get their meds, you save, you want and then you won't be as bloated, you won't be drinking as much booze. Why don't just regular people help each other out instead of waiting for these fucking people to do it because they don't get along with each other. Like when Obama went into office, evidently all the Republicans on the first fucking day in the house, the Senate or whatever, just basically said, we're just going to disagree with, we're not going to pass anything that this guy says, um, which is really fucking treasonous behavior.

Speaker 3:          00:46:39       I think. Not Saying you got to pass everything that guy said she'd, you do have to keep them in check, but to, before it even comes down the pipe, you saying, we're not going to fucking work with this guy. I Dunno. Um, so, but you can't ever expect these assholes to ever get along. They act like a bunch of fucking babies. They really are a bunch of babies the way that they behave. So, uh, but that doesn't mean you have to fucking behave like that. You know, you could be a, you can be that person who doesn't scream and yell. You can be that person that doesn't talk down to somebody because they don't live near an ocean. Or You could not judge somebody because they do live near the ocean for whatever fucking reason. The blue states are near the ocean. The other ones that fucking in the middle and everybody's screaming and yelling at each other.

Speaker 3:          00:47:26       I have gone to all 50 states and Goddammit, I've met great people out there. I really have great food, great fun. You know, quit fucking yelling at everybody and now you're going to be all right. Trump's gonna be president. For a lot of people, I guess it will be a good thing for other people. It's not going to be a good thing, but you know what? You're not going to die. Okay. Get out in front of it. Think something positive. At the end of the day, if you want to get your business going, you're still going to have to do it. Even if Obama was still in office, a Hillary got, they're a fucking newt Gingrich or Rudy Giuliani. The end of the day, your life facade you in life is not fair and people don't have the time to give a shit, you know? And that's how it is. It's unfortunate, but that is how it is. But the second you fucking address that, it's kind of empowering. Right? Oh fuck. I gotta handle this shit. You know, and this is coming from a privileged white male, so, oh, go fuck yourself. All right. That's the, that's it. Okay. Um, just trying to say shit positive. Yes.

Speaker 6:          00:48:32       Ooh.

Speaker 3:          00:48:35       All right. Well then quit. Quit moved to fuck Canada was sheriff. See if anybody gives a fuck. Um, anyways. Uh,

Speaker 4:          00:48:45       yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:48:45       yeah. It comes to music I guess is what happens now. And then we all get to listen to some greatest hits before the orange toupee guy was, he made possible even running for president. Who knows? Hey, who do you think he, you know, he should pick another reality TV show star for his fucking vice presidency. You know, he should get the guy from survivor, you know, who gets progressively angrier with every fucking season. I don't know if you guys have noticed that. I don't understand. Like I stopped watching it ears ago because of it. He just like, you know, red teeth

Speaker 6:          00:49:19       folly behind. They got to step it up.

Speaker 3:          00:49:22       Just started fucking yelling at him. He used to just be, they used to be more exciting, happy. I think he's just sick of being out on that island, watching people eating bugs. I don't know what his issue was, but he seems to be taking it out on the people there in the islands, you know, once they waste away. All right, I'm done. Babbling. Alright.

I was performing at Colorado State University and I was going to do the podcasts from there, but every time I went to call up I couldn't get service. So that's what happened. And right now I am in Indianapolis Cause I'm doing Bob and Tom Radio tomorrow morning to hype my Gig in Nashville. All right, so I'm on the road this week. In fact, earlier this week I heard that I already commercial, you know that Johnny Cash song where he's like, I've been to Tupelo stuff rattling off all these cities happen everywhere man. And I literally yelled, I said shut the fuck up Johnny Silva. So all right, so have a lot of fucking people and not to mention the fucking cities he mentioned in that song.

Speaker 8:          00:51:34       Oh just a bunch of cities you wouldn't want to go to anyways. Yeah, I haven't been to any everywhere you fucking redneck, you should have said I've been to Paris, London. You know what I'm saying? Rome places people want to go, not Tupelo, Toledo, Charlestown. Nobody gives a fuck. And what did you do that Johnny? Maybe that's why you were so fucking angry and that's why I'm so fucking angry cause I had been in those goddamn cities too, when you know what I like about them. Let's, let's turn it around here and make it a little more positive as I go on the 70 east trying to figure out where the fuck up. There we go. There we go. Um, you know, what I like about them is they're a, they don't have enough money to Redo that downtown areas. So you get to see what you know.

Speaker 8:          00:52:21       You know, America used to look like, like 50 years ago, and I'm not trying to be condescending here. I actually liked architecture was better, you know, stuff was made out of brick. Everything wasn't like a fucking cheesecake factory and an Applebee's. Anytime that's happened to me in my life, I've been on the road. Hey, good on the front desk. Do you have any place where I can get something healthy to eat? Um, we have an Applebee's that's a solution. He wants something. KLC. Um, what's healthy? Oh, you know what healthy is healthy is when they wrap the silverware in the Napkin. That means you're eating healthy and you, you know where they do that. They do it at an Applebee's. They do what? It's Shoney's. Shoney's. I've never, um, never eaten there and show me this certain rest fucking restaurant. You just go by those chains.

Speaker 8:          00:53:18       And for me anyways, let me not speak for you. I don't want to be arrogant here, but for me anyway, some certain restaurants, fast food chains, I literally just look at the sign and it gives me a stomach ache and I can never eat there. And Shoney's is one of them. Steak and shake is another one of the two of them. I Dunno, maybe I'm combining and they have like this orange fucking sign that just, it just reminds me of what I'm going to feel like after I eat that shit food. But I'm not always right cause I gotta tell Ya, I avoided the waffle house like the plague for like a decade on the road. How would you see that yellow sign with those? Just that regular type script. Waffle house and it just, you know, you could just drive, invite. You knew how sticky the fucking tables we're going to be, how toothless the waitress was going to be, how many felonies, how many convicted felons we're going to be.

Speaker 8:          00:54:20       It's just, it just wasn't worth it to get fucking waffle. Not to mention I have a great recipe for Waffles, but then, you know, when I did the rich bitch tour and the two guys I was on tour with on the Chappelle show one night to let's go to the waffle house and I went in there and uh, you know, wasn't that bad, although I got to admit that it's been so long since I'd been there. Whatever they have their home fries smothered, covered and all that stuff, it's fucking gross. You know, I don't like it. I don't mind you. You're punching up the food a little bit or kicking it up a notch is that, it's going to say Harold Carmichael. Why the fuck did his main pop? What's that guy's name? Emilio. Emilio Estevez. What's the name of that chef when he goes Bam, he throws the sugar and everybody goes fucking crazy.

Speaker 8:          00:55:11       Emilio Elios I think the cell phone is affecting my fucking memory. What is his name? Jesus Christ. Uh, Emeril. Yeah, we go Emeril Lagasse fuck the worst. You know, I was trying to remember the, the name screech yesterday from saved by the bell because I was talking about people being able to sell tickets. I couldn't fucking remember his name. I was like scratchy, skippy, Sebastian. I knew it began with an s, some sort of continent afterwards. Screech. Okay. What would you do if you are the parent of a child star? You know, besides steal his money before he turned 18 we'll put the fuck would you do? Especially if, I mean I'll, I'll give screeches parents a break. Okay. But I've got to say from here on out, if you put your kid into show business, first of all, you're fucked in the head. All right? You wanted to make it on some level. All right? And secondly, if the kid books to show and his characters, his character's name is like sippy. All right. You know, just something you would name a fucking ferric. If the, if that's what his character's name is or I call, you just know he's going to be a fuck up. I, why did I say Urkel? Cause he's not a fuck up. But you know what I'm saying? That point, you got to stick that kit and drug counseling. You know when he's still eight years old.

Speaker 8:          00:56:49       Oh my God. You know, it tells me a great fucking show. You could have a scared straight for a child stars. What you do is you have whoever the next fucking Hannah Montana is, right. That's another one. You fucking name rhymes. If finished, she couldn't be on coke on her knees in the bathroom of the viper room within three years. I'll wait a minute. But her dad's Billy Ray Cyrus, so he knows he's been there. He's the, I been there baby. Okay. You understand whether my eyes look and see the pain that is pain of, of having a mullet and singing a song called Achy breaky heart. I swear to God. No, it was not for five year olds. No it wasn't. It was for adults who was for adults and they fucking love it and they bought it and then one day they figured out it's stuffed and then they all acted lock.

Speaker 8:          00:57:42       They never bought it and no one ever come to my shows again. So I cut off my mode and I'm pregnant. Did your Mama and then we had you. Well now it's your fucking turn to continue the legacy of horrific fucking moments in show business. Um, oh, so this is the show. You basically have former child stars who've done drugs. That dude from the courtship of Eddie's father. Uh, yeah. You have the dude Michael Diamond. No. Michael Diamond. Either the Beastie boys. Dustin diamond. Yeah. Have him fucking in there. Yeah. You know, you have random Brady bunch, but they never really did anything fucking fags. They never really did anything other than linger around gaveled a boring cast. The people, um, whatever. You just take a bunch of child stars who fucked up, who haven't died yet, and then you bring them in there and you haven't just start screaming at whoever the next article is to make sure he's not on drugs.

Speaker 8:          00:58:48       And if I could some how smooth it out, I think I could, uh, I could sell that show at the VH one. All right. Stick a former rapper in there. Get some hoes and you've got to show. So you might be asking yourself, Bill, you know, you've been doing this podcast for quite a while. You've been driving for quite a, I don't shift your hotel yet. Uh, no, I'm not because, um, I dunno, I didn't want to spend the night in Indianapolis even though I have to do radio tomorrow at six in the morning. And I looked up, I saw that the red wings and playing the fucking, uh, Pittsburgh penguins up in Detroit, the best two teams in the NHL last year. I pick a fucking, I'll drive up the street. It can't be more than an hour and a half to Detroit. Well, turns out it's three hours and hours. He had a fucking car.

Speaker 8:          00:59:34       So joke's on me. This better be a good fucking game. Um, but anyways, I'm driving along here so I don't have the questions. I don't know if the question, so all I can do it just run my fucking mouth this week, which I have done for nine minutes and 51 seconds. What? That also includes the intro. I talk to that fucking machine every week. Um, all right, so this is a, there's a waffle house. Now I'm driving down the road and I'm trying to make the decision, the decision that Americans have to make every day in this country. How do I not become a fat fuck? I'm a tie. It's very difficult out here. It's very difficult. Where can I eat at here? There's a place called Joe's as a throwback. What is this place? Joe's Joe's crab shack. Oh yeah. That's what I do when I go to the middle of the country. Let me order some seafood show that's fresh. No fuck is wrong with you. I tell you know what we doing? Indianapolis. We I sushi. We love it. What do you have? What kind of Sushi? What do you have? Trout Sushi.

Speaker 8:          01:00:44       So sort of Fred. They have catfish Sushi out here. They go, oh, we've got to go down there. We just, can we just pull it out of the Crick? Why does every moron in my act have a southern accent? I really have to stop that. I'll tell you why. Because every time you get outside of a major city, everybody fucking talks like that. Everybody's got a little bit of a lazy, Lazy Way of speaking that was awful. Apartments every fucking one looking the same, but it's right near a manmade. Like I got to tell you one of the most depressing things ever for me. Oh that's nice. We just merged down to two lanes. Were there signs? Maybe if I wasn't doing the podcast, can you imagine if I actually caused one of those horrific highway accidents? You know, like anybody used to watch that show chips, remember that uh, Erik Estrada, Larry Wilcox

Speaker 8:          01:01:44       that then private down the street and their motorcycles and once you show they would literally have a 20 to 30 car pile up, which in all my years of being on the road, I have never fucking seen. And my favorite thing about those pileups right was they would last for like a good fucking, I dunno, one minute on television, which basically in real life is like a five minute catastrophe and everything. When everything was all said and done, there's like 25 cars upside down, twist it around, and it was always like an old oil tanker. And then it was always that guy. The last guy would always, somehow he'd get air off of cars rather than just plowing into them. He just defied, he would defy physics and he would somehow get air shoot up and over everybody. And if you listen to the audio, for some reason the guy would still be hitting the gas, these literacy in the air and his car's still going, Ra like he thinks he's gonna make it over.

Speaker 8:          01:02:47       I never understood that even as a little boy watching it. And I look at my dad and I would say, dad, why did he do that? And He'd be like, shut the fuck up. Just shut the fuck up. And the cat's in the cradle and the seat of a mood. Silver Spoon. There it is. I'm telling you, I think the fucking cell phone is affecting my memory. So anyways, let's talk conspiracy theory. Hey everybody. How about that $700 million bail outs? Is that autumn as an it made the country a lot better. He's fucking motherfuckers, you know? I realized after eight years, you know the outcast is, it's the Goddamn bankers, you know what I mean? Then more fucking terrorists than anybody. You sons of bitches, you know what they're doing with that money. Have they lowered interest rates so people can get alone talk? No.

Speaker 8:          01:03:37       GM is going under. You know what they're doing with the money for what I, I overheard on the radio is there a, they're using it to buy up other failing banks just inching us towards the one World Bank. That's what they're using it for and they have the audacity to raise the interest rates on credit cards to help pay for this mortgage mess. Then we just give you $700 billion to get you out of it. I didn't know you were going to keep it so you could buy more assets and then further, fuck me in the ass. It's up to 27% on some people's cards. Don't they have some sort of usury laws? Does anybody who's remotely, I want to say majored in economics because anybody who understands is at what point, what percentage is usury? There are up to 27% I mean, back in the day did the mob even do that?

Speaker 8:          01:04:40       They own everybody. That's what I realized when I really looked at the whole economy that broken everything down and I realized all the money I've made in this business, how much of it I've asked have I ever held in my hand? You know, I take out 100 bucks here, a hundred bucks there. I pay everything with the check. I get paid in checks, just numbers on a piece of paper and I kind of realized that even if I own shit, they can still be seized with the Patriot Act that can be arrested, not charged it fucking waterboarded. No, I realize I'm going to grow a mustache just in case everything waterboarding, you know? It's like there's still going to slowly draw me right to hate water going up my nose. It's going to grow one of those big fucking 1970 sex symbols, mustaches. You know, Burt Reynolds, you know, it's got the best mustache ever.

Speaker 8:          01:05:33       And of course, I don't know his name. He's a guy who was in the, uh, he was actually in the big Lebowski. He was the narrator. Sam Elliott. I mean, that guy's mustache. It's just, it's fucking ridiculous. Number one, a mustache wasn't cool for like 20 years, but he kept his, his was so fucking cool. You couldn't question his mustache. He had, that's like a man that's like a fucking panning for gold and the 1840 [inaudible]. Then when the gold rush was anybody listen to this from San Francisco and you went out there and he sang those awful fucking songs. Oh, Mandar when Omen Darlin Darlin Klamath time,

Speaker 8:          01:06:16       you got the worst fucking name in the world. You must be in a good bitch. Has there ever been a good looking woman named Clementine? You'll notice that there's like hot girl names like Natasha. I've never seen an ugly girl named Natasha yet. I've never seen a cool girl named Natasha. I always just see some hot girl who knows she's fucking hot at eight because their name is Natasha, which ends up making a B really, um, uh, con to be honest with you. Or is it more about me that I never had the courage to approach a girl named Natasha, Natasha. Fxe. Brooke. That's a good one. Brooke. Natasha,

Speaker 9:          01:06:57       uh,

Speaker 8:          01:06:59       not Melissa. Melissa's can kind of be down to earth.

Speaker 8:          01:07:04       Some sort of offshoot of Melissa and I always notice was what the fuck? I don't know Jesus Christ as if depressing out here it is absolutely overcast. I'll tell you, the Midwest Midwestern, the summertime when all the props, you know, waving in the air, you know, makes you proud to be an American. But when you're out here, the beginning of winter, you start to understand crystal meth. I get it now I understand the anger of slipknot. I never understood those guys. Like what the fuck are they so angry about? And then I was in Iowa in like February, and I was like, you know what? I get it. I get it. It's like a, I dunno it, it really fucking affects your mood. This is awful. But those guys look like for you guys in the side of the road, then that's why those guys you see on the side of the road, you're not picking up litter. You know, you're not mowing the grass. You're not waiting to give somebody a ticket, but you still got a little shine. A little fucking siren on top of your car. The neutral one though. That orange one.

Speaker 9:          01:08:14       It's

Speaker 8:          01:08:14       like the uh, it's like the Jen Brady of emergency vehicles. Oh, the dad is super eight motel with an indoor pool. Huh? Who says this country and Trump is in trouble. Why? They really, they really stepped it up. They finally living up to that name. Super Right. Never Super. When I went to it, there's a steak and shake. Next exit. Oh, this is this part of the country. For those of you who don't travel, this is steak and shake. Dairy Queen country heartland resort camping. Do you know I had, I had a chance to go skeet shooting in DC and I got so fucking drunk with Joe to Rosa the night before. I couldn't do it. Me and Joe to Rosa, the guy I do uninformed with, we are not good for each other. That's what I realized when I think when we're by ourselves, we can make good decisions, but when we are hanging out together, everyone else, you've got a friend like that. We're after a while, you know, you just have to kind of tap out. I'm not saying I'm not going to be friends with Joe to Rosie anymore. I just, I don't know if I don't think I can hang out with them anymore.

Speaker 8:          01:09:23       Why are you driving so fucking slow in the left lane with your high performance muffler? High performance mufflers. A ridiculous, didn't somebody sends something in about those being overrated? It's fool little Asian girls and to thinking that you have a fast car.

Speaker 9:          01:09:43       Bye.

Speaker 8:          01:09:43       You think it's an old guy with white hair or is that a baseball cap? It's basically a Honda civic, early nineties. They, uh, with the hatchback, it looks like he's got some sort of erector set. [inaudible] you remember that shit? Nobody erector set us back when they used to give you toys to try and make you smart to give like a chemistry set. Can you hear that? Can you hear his car?

Speaker 10:         01:10:11       Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, whoa.

Speaker 8:          01:10:15       Don't fucking 65. He sounds like a motorcycle off in the distance and he's literally fucking 30 yards in front of me. Some physics major out there doing the math right now to see if I'm not, if I'm following too closely behind.

Speaker 8:          01:10:29       All right, so we're up to 20 minutes. That's not bad. That's not bad. I, you know, I, this is how I used to do them. It was like an old school throwback talking throwback. Um, uh, I'm really going to be hating this drive when I come back. Do you realize that I'm such a mean? Why doesn't this guy have a side view mirror? Okay, here we go. And I'm driving by him and it is, uh, you know what? It was a younger kid and he had one of those, uh, you know, the goatee where you don't have the mustache, but then you have like the really long shit hanging off your Chin basically says, uh, you know, I'm not wearing a condom.

Speaker 8:          01:11:07       Um, I dunno. Anyways, let's, let's heighten my gigs upcoming this week. Okay. If you've enjoyed this podcast and you have a radio, I will be, uh, on the Bob and Tom Show tomorrow morning, all across this great country of ours, which is still great. If we could get rid of these motherfucking bankers. Um, and I'm going to be hyping my upcoming Gig, the next gig on the uninformed tour and uh, xannies and Nashville, Tennessee. Um, this Thursday, Friday and Saturday, me and Joe to Rosa two man show. We're going to be telling some jokes or whatever. And if you came and saw me last year, I wrote a whole new hour people in Nashville and listen to this. I want to go skeet. Shoot. I blew it in DC. I want to go. I want to learn how to shoot something that's my next puck and move as I plan for the new world order.

Speaker 8:          01:12:05       Um, so come on man. I'm going down to Nashville. I know it's the music city capital of the world, but God dammit, just outside of it. I know there's a bunch of people with guns and he got fields and I want to go up there and shoot a little plate just so why don't you hook me up? I got, I got it. Here you go. Anybody who hooks me up takes me out. Go skeet shooting gets a free three, three, three DVD. Say That 10 times fast for you. Your buddy you go hunting with and your best girlfriend with them. Daisy Dukes, motherfucker. I'm serious. I want to, I want to learn. Okay.

Speaker 8:          01:12:42       Hey, it's his, his, my latest fucking conspiracy that I know they're going to combine this country with fucking Mexico and with Canada. Aside from the fact that they've got that creepy commercial about how they have a new enhanced driver's license that'll make it easier to travel between the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Personally. I didn't know that was a problem. I don't know. There was people around ego and you know, I love this country, but I just wish it was easier to go to Canada. God Damn it. If I could just go to Mexico a little bit earlier, I mean easier.

Speaker 8:          01:13:16       This is, this is my big conspiracy. I've noticed lately I'm traveling in airports and all of a sudden there's this new software out there called a Rosetta stone, which is a damn it, I wish I looked it up. I know the Rosetta stone is some sort of, I don't even know what the fuck it is. It's something difficult. Is it to like the hope diamond? I don't know what it is, but basically they took that name and it is now it's software that teaches you a bunch of different languages. Okay. Which I always thought was cool. I want to learn another language, but nobody in America has ever given a fuck. Now all of a sudden they're selling these fucking things. I was just getting off at the airport. I can see if you're in New York, if you're in loss hung delays. We could actually speak Spanish every fucking three feet I get it.

Speaker 8:          01:14:02       Or maybe French or something like that. I don't know. But like I just got off at the airport here in Indianapolis and this selling the resent of stone software. Who the fuck in Indianapolis is climber and to learn a different language, you know something's going on, they're putting it in your head and I'm telling you if you stick around, stick it out in front of people long enough, they're going to this like Rubik's cubes when you really think about it. Was that thing fun? It was kind of like a toy that was fixed and you spun it three times and then it was broken and you can never get it fixed again unless you had an Asian friend too for some reason. Figured out how to do it. I don't know what it is about those guys. They just fucking smarter than us. Is that like reverse racist in a way?

Speaker 8:          01:14:51       Because I actually said something fucking you allowed to do that. I know you're not allowed to say something bad straight across about a race of people. Can I say something good? The politically correct police going to come at me. Now that's just as bad because that's offensive too. Stupid Asian people, it's going to make them feel even more retarded and we don't want that anyways. Wow. I am really out here in the heartland right now. You know something people always say that's the movement. Start a farm, start a farm, save your money and that type of shit. But as far as I can tell, these farmers are fucked too, cause they only grow one crop. So what are you going to do? What are you going to grow? Fucking corn, you know? All right, you grow corn, then everything goes down. You can't afford food. Even if you've got well water on you, on your fucking property, what do you eat? Corn every fucking day. Some point you got, I guess maybe you can go out and shoot a pheasant knows. Reminds me of a joke. I used to wait at the hall of fame. Any an Indiana basketball hall of fame. Get the fuck Outta here.

Speaker 8:          01:16:05       Jesus Christ. That's going to be the big biggest collection of white basketball players with booty shorts in the goddamn country. And you know, Larry Bird, he said Jesus, and I can't argue with them, Larry Bird. Now there is, it was, it wasn't awful mustache. He had a, I have a cleft palate mustache. Ah, Jesus, that was me. But you know what, I actually bought one of those kids in new smile, so I'm able to do that joke. Larry Bird had a fucking 14 year old white trash mustache when he was like 28. I don't think it ever filled in his entire career, that awful oval face. God Damn. And he could play. He could definitely place look at me trash and one of the icons of Boston who would have thought. Um, anyways, I'm going to end this podcast this week with uh, with the joke I used to do back in my college days.

Speaker 8:          01:17:02       It was back in college. This is what I do. All my college gigs, standup gigs back before I was doing mainly clubs. I used to land at the airport. I get around a car, you know, grab a couple of cds, possibly cassette tapes, depending on what point in my career. And I drive across, you know, the farm lands out here in the Midwest and I ended up getting a joke out of it and this was the joke that was like, you know, every time you see farmers on the news, you always see in pitching about how difficult farming is. You know what? I must've driven by 10,000 farms during my standup career. And you know what? I've never seen anybody doing shifts.

Speaker 9:          01:17:44       Okay?

Speaker 8:          01:17:44       Tractors always parked. Cows are standing around, there's absolutely no fucking activity whatsoever. And there's always a big satellite. This there were in there watching fucking ESPN. And then when the media comes by and he just smear a bunch of dirt on their face and they're like, oh my God, it was good. Try Food, jump on something like that. And you know what? Today is no different. I just drove by 45 I have not seen one fucking person. The lights aren't even on there. And then that happened.

Speaker 8:          01:18:15       Oh, I don't know what they do this time of year. All the crops had cut down. Who the fuck knows? But anyways, here's something off all the people on my space. I would really appreciate it if you would, uh, go on to my website [inaudible] dot com and sign up for my mailing list because, uh, I'm sort of inching my way over to that one more so than the mindspace. I'll still put shit up on my space, but, uh, I plan to start blogging and all that crap once I get done with this uninformed tour. A lot of, uh, putting some extras on there because, you know, I haven't joined Facebook yet and I just really don't feel like going over to Facebook and have to add the same 30,000 fucking people that I already have. So if you go out on my website, then, you know what I mean?

Speaker 8:          01:18:54       And I won't spam you. And plus you're also able to control what sort of, uh, emails you get from me. Like when I said I was going to Nashville, I just emailed people on my Nashville list. Okay. So you're not going to get a fucking updates from me every week is I have some sort of Zany picture trying to utilize the web. This is my one once a week thing that I do, which I think is a good thing. Okay? I usually do it on Mondays. I fuck around. I give you a fucking free audio show. All right? It's a lot more than, uh, some of these other cons out there doing right? All right, that's it. That's the Monday morning podcast on a Tuesday. I apologize. I didn't get any cell phone service. So, uh, God bless all ya. God bless the United States of America. Fuck the bankers.

Speaker 8:          01:19:43       Please go on the Internet and start reading about banking. Please read about it and just read what the fuck over it is. And uh, educate yourself with conspiracy theory that is based in Wikipedia and youtube videos. I just know it's not all bad, everybody. I don't like this. I'm telling you, man, I don't like Internet gets a bad rap. They only call the everything on the Internet's a lie. But TV's telling you the truth. Think about the insanity of that. Man. That's fucking ridiculous. It both full of Shit and it's all mine throwing. Fucking listen to me. I have a good week and please, if you live anywhere near Nashville, please come down, come out and see me. Um, and um, that is it. That's it. All right, everybody have a good week. I said that 15 times, God dammit. But, uh, I want you to know I really need it. I hope you have a great week. God bless. Take it easy.
