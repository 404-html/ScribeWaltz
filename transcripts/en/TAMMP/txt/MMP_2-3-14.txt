Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burr and it's the Monday morning podcast for Monday, Monday, uh, February 3rd, 2014. How the hell are you or how's it going? I'm a little bit handicapped this week because my internet isn't working. I Dunno why. I Dunno what happened. I hit the little reset button, you know, you'd take out the little pin and you stick it in the side. You do a little fucking five count and you sit there staring at the God damn lights, Blinky, blinky, blinky, and then what happens? So it's supposed to all be good. Well, not this week. I don't have any. So if you think my reading is bad when I'm reading it off a nice giant computer screen, whether you're here this week, when I'm reading off my fucking iPhone. Oh wait till you hear it.

Speaker 1:          00:00:52       Um, all right, well let's get down to it. How about that fucking Superbowl? Was that awesome or what? I'm speaking as a patriots fan by the way. Um, I gotta be honest. Like if Peyton Manning, he won his second super bowl and uh, then he had to, and Brady had three, then that's stupid ass debate is going to start again, which I have not heard since Peyton, uh, lost, or I should say the colts lost when they played the saints and I didn't want to fucking hear it. All right. And I love it. So all you wa Peyton manning fans for all these years who've been telling me that fucking Peyton's better than Brady. Look how many fucking October. Um, you know, it was a classic, a classic, uh, Peyton manning stat yesterday is despite the fact that they got the living shit kicked out of him, he still set the record for most completions in a Superbowl game, right?

Speaker 1:          00:01:58       He completed 33 passes, 33 passes. So you gotta be like Jesus Christ. What he throw for 500 yards, 400. At least 33 you don't need through for 280 yards. That's less than nine yards a catch. It was 8.7 yards a catch thinking it Dunkin down the damn field and he got half of those fucking yards in the, uh, the end of the third quarter when Seattle went to like a fucking prevent, just gave them the middle of the field and gave him those six fucking points, which pissed me off. I wanted them to shut them out. Right. It's embarrassing how much I root against Peyton cause I, it's like it has nothing to do with the guy. I think he's a great fucking quarterback was just what I really, I'm doing as I'm hating on Peyton is if I can be a am I have two white to use that expression as I dislike Peyton manning is I am.

Speaker 1:          00:02:52       Um, um, it's, it's really just all the sports fans that I've run into over the years who just with Peyton Manning, it was always individual stats and then blaming everybody around them. The coaching, the defense to ready engage, well, blah, blah, blah, blah. Paula fucking crap. Give me a God damn break. Give me a fucking break. Did you see that? Look on his face. About three quarters of the way through the first quarter in my family that is known as Peyton face. And that's when he starts pouting and he gets frustrated and he gets upset and he can't have your fucking later looking like that. Now nobody on ESPN is going to say it. None of them are going to fucking say that shit because they fucking dropped down at the stats God and suck it's Dick Everyday on fucking sports center. They don't watch the game. All right. None of those people on ESPN or even human beings, they walk in as human beings, right? And then something happens, they drill into their head and they stick a chip in there and then they just become like these, you know, like, I don't think, I only think like their lip should move. I think like their jaws should just open and close like one of those wooden puppets, you know, those ones that are dressed like those guards there and the nutcrackers

Speaker 2:          00:04:05       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:05       Right. That's what, that's what the one that ran credit rock got robbed. They should just be doing that shit. [inaudible]. Um, I can't even tell you. I had no idea how hard I was rooting for Seattle until the game

Speaker 1:          00:04:27       fucking started because I thought, you know, as you guys all know how much I hated that stupid 12th man and like, you know what have been a great drinking game was how many times Joe Buck said it is really loud here, right? With the stupid sound, a meter and all of that shit. And I actually got a lot of people on Twitter were given me shit going. Yeah. How, how dumb do you feel now? I never shit on Seattle. I never said they were bad team. If you listened to my podcast, you've dumb cunt. I said it was yours to lose. I bet on you guys to win it. But that doesn't change. And even your championship does not change that. That 12th man thing and everybody dressing up like characters and bring in fucking new year's whistles to the Goddamn game is not the dumbest thing that I've, embarrassing embarrassing ball washing thing I've ever seen in my fucking life. The 12th man stinks. You have nothing to do with the victory. Despite what the players and the owners are going to say. They all make millions because of your dumb ass. That's why they say a nice shit to you. All right.

Speaker 2:          00:05:41       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:05:41       Jesus fucking Christ. Jury think there's some running back and the other huddle as he's listening to the play going, you know, I'd really like to execute this play the way we have all week in practice, but golly, golly, is that crowd loud? Um, but congratulations to the true fans of the Seattle Seahawks. The real ones, the real ones, the ones who showed up when they suck too. The ones who when they got better, didn't go out and buy a bunch of shit and start dressing up like fucking a green Ben Franklin or whatever the fuck those people were doing in the stance. Um, I gotta ask you, be honest, Seattle Seahawk fans, now that you actually have something to crow about, pun intended, you know, don't, now that you actually have a Superbowl trophy, you guys are actually champions. You can actually sing champions. Now. Doesn't that loud things seem a little fucking ridiculous?

Speaker 1:          00:06:35       Didn't, that just kind of seem like, you know that mother that can admit that our kids not talented so they got to like somehow come up with everybody gets a trophy, everybody gets a ribbon. You know what you guys have created up there I hope is over. Not as far as like your run on on championships. I'd never wished that against you, but as far as that loud horseshit, um, if Kansas City next year tries to break the record again, if that whole fucking thing starts like who is the loudest crowd and I guarantee it it will. I can't say it guy. It wouldn't surprise me if it what? It is embarrassing. You have your Superbowl trophy for the love of fucking God. Please stop looking each other in the street going 12th man.

Speaker 3:          00:07:26       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:31       Was that really even a congratulations?

Speaker 3:          00:07:34       Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:07:36       I was losing my fucking mind watching that game. I absolute lot of people, I guess it didn't like the game or whatever. Thought it was boring. I fucking loved that game. That game was the biggest fucking beat down. I'm trying to think if it was as bad. This is bad for like Bronco fans. I'm not rubbing this in be this really has to disk goes back to the Patriots cults like 10 fucking years ago when Brady had three rings and Peyton had none and will

Speaker 4:          00:08:05       monetary about, you know, [inaudible] he's got the runes blow four, I got its start team. I got to pills in her own. Their stories got, Ooh, you bulls

Speaker 1:          00:08:15       right. These fucking losing every year and the first goddamn round.

Speaker 1:          00:08:23       Um, anyways, but last week I hope you got an outpour. Um, people who didn't give a fuck about the game. I hope you, um, you took my advice and you let the game go for 90 minutes. 90 minutes is the magic number. That is the magic number. If you want to avoid everything and actually watch the game and be on the edge of your fucking seat, provided if it's a good game is you let it go for 90 minutes, 90 minutes you're hanging outside, you'd drink it, bears, you're doing whatever the fuck you doing, hanging with like three, four other people tops who also into the game. All right. We come in, we sit down and we just start when everybody shut their phones off so we don't know anything, right? Press play. And then for the rest of the game, we didn't watch one commercial.

Speaker 1:          00:09:14       We didn't have to sit through one challenge flag. Anytime anybody got hurt. We fast forward to it. We fast forward through the entire fucking halftime show. Didn't see any of it. All we saw was the game. And the second it ended and the coaches were walking out and they'd go out. All right, well let out a little, we'll play catch shut. We shut the fucking game off. Didn't watch one second on ESPN. Nothing. I'm guaranteeing you. Everybody there was going, that's like one of the most enjoyable Superbowl experiences I ever had. It was fucking great. Anytime they cut down to Pam Oliver, that other chick, you just fast forward the whole fucking, it was tremendous. Absolutely tremendous. Um, but anyways, let's talk about the fucking game. So anyways, the rest of the world is 90 minutes ahead of us and we're still downstairs. Um, you know, out my back yard smoking a pork shoulder right? I made one of my famous apple pies. Law heads. Fucking kill it in on my grill. You want to talk about losing your man card? I had another man come over my house and smoke a pork shoulder on my grill. I couldn't believe I woke up this morning. My wife was still next to me.

Speaker 1:          00:10:37       Do you realize like in the south like I would legally be considered a homosexual if I did something like that? I know. I fucking know and ever since I'm telling you right now, I ain't no man who locked himself. The person foresee allows another man come on fucking smoke on his grip grilling. That's okay. Smoking. That's a whole other thing. You know what I'm saying? I wouldn't be surprised if not only if he's wanting them, them a a a homeo tack. Sexuals if fees also one of them terrorist, he's probably building a dirty bomb shape like a dick. That's all I'm saying.

Speaker 1:          00:11:21       Yeah. I just, you know, one of the keys to being successful in life is knowing what you suck at and then being able to find talent in that area and then delegating. That's what you do. But delegating, you have to be like, you gotta be careful though. You can't delegate so much of your job that you're just sitting in your office twiddling your thumbs, cause then you're fucking useless. There's a fine line between putting a team together and then just sitting in in a fucking room like a, uh, like a fucking goddamn mop. So I still made an apple pie. I put on an apron, took out some flour and some sugar. I don't give a fuck. I am, I'm good at making desserts. All right?

Speaker 1:          00:12:05       I don't know. It's embarrassing. But I, I like sweets and my mom always made great pies and when I moved out, I missed them. So I learned how to make a fucking show me. Um, oh Geez. I can't even look myself in the mirror after this fucking podcast. What do you want from me people? I'm flying blind here. All right. I don't have the Internet. I'm doing a podcast without the Internet. This is like a pilot flying at night without his instrument panel. Am I in a spin and my uh, my level with the horizon, I don't know my going up my going down, God, I wish I had a beverage so I could actually look at it to try to figure out which way I'm going. Isn't that what you do? You just put like a glass of water on the, on the airplanes dashboard and then you just, you just use that as your fucking horizon.

Speaker 1:          00:12:54       Come on man. That's pretty ingenious for a comedian who has zero hours up in the air. Um, anyways, so let's get back to the game. So the entire world is like 90 minutes ahead of us and there's something cool about that, right? Like they all got on the spaceship and they went to a better planet and we all sat back like, gag, go fuck yourself with toughing it out here. Non on cigars and shit pretending we know how to fight. Right? So we go upstairs and they finally like, you guys want to watch the game? Yeah, let's fucking watch it. All right, so we go upstairs, we put it on. I fast forward like, you know, get right to where it, right before the kicker is going to kick the ball. And I hit pause. You guys ready? Everybody, Jake? Yeah, we're ready. Let's go. Bomb fucking kicks the ball off. My Broncos get the ball and the very first play from scrimmage. All right. Peyton calls an audible the fucking Manny Ramirez, who I thought, you know, when you get kicked out of baseball, I didn't think that you could then just go play football. But once again, Jesus, what a fucking talent this man is Manny being Manny hikes the ball over Peytons fucking head

Speaker 1:          00:14:08       ended up God damn end zone, whatever the guy falls on it. They get as safety, very first play from scrimmage. And I'm not going to lie to you. I literally put my hand over my mouth and I was stunned, absolutely stunned because uh, you know, I'm not gonna lie to him. You know, you guys know what my prediction was last week. I thought that game was going to be a classic. I'm, I'm, I knew the AFC was weaker. I definitely kind of felt that Seattle 49 is, might've been the super bowl, but it's fucking Peyton manning. And I knew [inaudible] had a great defense and all that. I just thought it was going to be back and forth, um, through the first half. This is what I thought. And I thought it would maybe one one team where the yellow was going to be up by like two, three points, maybe four at the half.

Speaker 1:          00:14:58       And then in the second half I thought that the Broncos' defense was going to cave in, that Marshawn lynch was going to fucking run all over them. That obviously did not happen. I think the Broncos went in there are obviously we'll like, alright, we gotta stop, we gotta Stop Marshawn Lynch. And they did. They did. And they were like, well that Wilson guy is not playing well. If we're going to get beat by, our offense is going to be with that guys fuck it up. And other than a couple overly excited throws, you know where he overthrew that guy right out there and the flat. Other than that, that kid fucking settled down and had the game of his life. I thought he, he, he made some great fucking throws, had no picks, no fumbles, no nothing. He did not hurt the team. All he did was moving forward.

Speaker 1:          00:15:50       He played a great fucking game, dude. It was total 100% fucking domination. Let me think about that. They had two field goals. They had a safety. They had a touchdown or offensive touchdown. I think it was a run, right? Yeah. Marshawn Lynch. That was a run. That's 22 field goals at six fucking annoys me going through the whole game. That's 20 points now that it isn't, oh is oh here it is. A comedy be trying to add this up, right? Three and three is six plus seven is 13 plus two is 15 they had a kiss special teams kickoff return. That was fucking 22 what else did they, I don't fucking room. They had a pick six that's 29 points. Then they scored another 14 I don't even fucking remember

Speaker 1:          00:16:44       now telling you I'm, I mean, I might be wrong, but they could have shot them out. They went into the prevent and the at the end of the third quarter, which was fucking brilliant, just give up the middle of the field, let them burn out the rest of this fucking quarter and we're up. Even if they score a touchdown, we're still up by almost 30 points. There's no fucking way this scoring 30 and the fourth quarter it was over. I've never seen the starting quarterback get taken out of the game. Like, well, there's no sense risking you getting injured in a fucking Superbowl. I can't, I'm trying to think. Did they take Troy Aikman out that year when they, uh, they won like 50 something to whatever against buffalo or did they take Joe Montana out?

Speaker 3:          00:17:29       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:17:30       And that 55 to 10 game, I don't think Jim Mcmahon came out when they beat the shit out of the Patriots, that 46 to 10 game.

Speaker 1:          00:17:38       So this is what I'm doing during the game. This is how much of a psycho I am. Every time Seattle scored points, I stood up and I high fived each person I was watching the game with. Every time I'd go, Tom Brady, Tom Brady, Tom Brady, Tom Brady is, I was going around in the fucking room. I just look, I'm too dumb to follow politics. I'm not good at math. I don't understand science. So sports is all I have. So when I put on ESPN, it has been an absolute dream for me since 2010 to not listen to the who is better Payton or Tom Brady. And if he won yesterday, I was going to have to fucking listen to that again. So this is completely just selfish, totally selfish because I didn't give a fuck about Seattle either and there would've been nothing funnier then after all that screaming and yelling, if they didn't win it, the whole fucking thing.

Speaker 1:          00:18:43       I mean, I didn't give a fuck. It would have been hilarious. But the second the game started, like when Seattle started playing, well first I saw Peyton, right? And then there was the safety. And I was like, I was literally nervous at the beginning of the game going, Oh my God, is he going to just carve up this fucking unbelievable defense? And then this argument's gonna start again. I'm making this whole Superbowl about me. I realized this, this was all, this is all I gave a shit about. And then, um, and then Seattle started doing well and I started seeing, you know, Pete Carroll, very surprisingly, I don't think I saw him went, Woo, the whole game. I don't think I saw him do that once. But, uh, I got out and then I was looking at him like, ah, fucking Pete Carroll. I don't want to see this guy win. Like I was just fucking, I was like this little gargoyle in the corner just sitting there. Like, is there any way both teams could lose so I could be satisfied as a sports fan? I was just like one of the biggest clients that ever watched a fucking game. Um, and then I just realized that it was more, it was more about a,

Speaker 1:          00:19:47       Oh yeah. And not only that, first he picked the Broncos and I picked Seattle and that's a back to back years were Paul Versey has been dead fucking wrong. And uh, this is the thing about Paul and this is why you should never ever, and you can, you can call in Diversey effect if he has callers. And you could tell him I said this, don't ever, ever take gambling advice from that man. I'm not saying he's a good guy. I'm not saying he's not a standup guy. I'm not saying he's good on a great husband and father, not saying he's not a great comedian. I'm just talking about the gambling part of Paul versus New Jersey brain via New York. All right. That fucking guy

Speaker 1:          00:20:36       he's never going to learn. He is, that guy loves offense. It's a cliche at this point. The say defense wins championships. Paul just, he can't hear it. Paul's like that guy that's head fucking 19 beers and he's, and you're trying to go gimme your keys and he just will always think that he can drive. That's what he is. I hope he listens to this when it comes to be in a gambler. That fucking guy loves. He's flesh. He likes the Flash, he likes pinky rings. Offense, throw the bomb. That's his big thing. Aaron out scare the defense. He loves it. Waste to play. Just throw it. 70 fucking yards. He is, he's a time square fucking kind of guy. He likes the lights, he loves the fucking off fence. I on the other hand, am a miserable, middle-aged Andy, Andy Rooney cunt. So I of course love defense. I love it. 10 to seven game. I love it. I love it when people sit those so fucking boring. I absolutely love it. I love a pitcher's duel. I Dunno why.

Speaker 2:          00:21:58       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:21:58       I know why. Because I'm a Kinda guy that will watch the Superbowl and root for both teams, the loose. Um, so anyways, congratulations. In all seriousness, congratulations to the fans of Seattle lie. That's gotta be fits. Great guys. Haven't fucking won a championship. So when was it? Let's see. 77 was the bullets. No, 77 was Portland. 78 was the bullet. 79 I believe was, uh, the supersonics. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:22:30       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:22:30       The loudest fans, they are the loudest fans. Hey, us, Seattle Seahawks fans. Do you ever think if you cheered that loud for the sonics, they wouldn't have left?

Speaker 5:          00:22:40       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:22:42       Ah, it's just never going to get old teasing them. They don't give a fuck. They have a championship parade. So now they're actually talking because they're so young. I mean, dude, that was fucking, that was seriously, I know. I'm still breaking it balls just because it's fun. Um, that was seriously one of, I knew the afcs week, but I mean, there are only so weak. That was still Peyton manning with one of the most prolific offices in the history of the modern era. Fuck the whole game because the game has changed so much. But like, um, Jesus Christ, I mean, that game was over, over in like even I who never, I always say it's never over. It's never over. It's never over even, I mean, it was just, it was fucking over.

Speaker 2:          00:23:34       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:23:34       The fucking game was over. Joe Barton. Nick was sitting on my couch, just La. He started the laughing in the, uh, when the guy was ran the fucking ball back to start the second half,

Speaker 1:          00:23:52       cause he's sitting there going like, what did he say? He said, Bill, he goes, I'm glad you have money on this game because if you didn't I would be back outside drinking and I start laughing and then, you know, and as we're doing that, we're fast forward through all the fucking, you know, um, halftime show and as he's saying that, I'm laughing, we hit pause, everybody, you know, bathroom break and then we hit play. They kicked the ball off and the dude starts running back and, and partner has this high pitched laugh. I just, Sam, go ahead.

Speaker 1:          00:24:27       Once the fucking thing back, dude, it was an absolute beat. I have to think that everybody in Washington, the state of Washington has to have laryngitis like for fuck eat. Especially if you watched the game and you didn't miss any commercials, you, you just watched it like, like a nerd and just sat there like a good little fucking TV viewer. And you watched the whole halftime show. I mean, everybody in the state of Washington has to have laryngitis. I'm trying to think. The only disappointment you had was that you didn't shut them out. And even then it was just like that was, they did that on purpose. They just gave up the middle of the field. Jesus, Bill, how many fucking times are you going this week? Got It. They gave up the middle of the field. You can't, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:25:20       you know, who would've thought I'd be so fucking elated to see Pete Carroll Win a championship? I just ate just he party. There was a couple of fucking things this week. I didn't hear it, but I guess on Bill Simmons Podcast, he interviewed Larry Byrd and Larry Bird. They asked him who he would want to play with the most in today's NBA, and he said, Coby Bryant, Kobe Bryant. He just said, no, the guy plays hurt. He just fucking just went on and on about how awesome the guy was. So I have to retire trashing Coby Bryant. It took Larry Bird to let me know that I was wrong. But isn't that why you listened to the podcast? Doesn't it make you feel better about yourself? You know what's funny by himself? Fucking arrogant. I still don't think I'm wrong about that guy. Um, I can't get past my blind hatred of the fuck. Its not even the Lakers. That's their fucking stupid ass fans. God, they're dumb. They're so dumb. He just gives us this like 8% of them even remotely could even explain a pick and roll. I gotta tell you, if you're not from out here, you gotta come down here and go to a Laker game and just sit amongst them just to see how fucking dumb they are. God, they had dumped,

Speaker 1:          00:26:41       I mean I'm talking like not summer school. Dumb. I'm just talking about fucking learn a trade. Drive a truck. Dumb. Right. And I know there's people out there learning a trade right now and I know what you're thinking. What I just said was insulting and I don't care that you think that because I know you're too dumb to figure out where I where, where you can fucking find me doing stand up even though it's on my website. Get just too fucking stupid. I really shouldn't say shit like that cause there's always one dumb fuck who takes me seriously. Do you remember last week when I was saying how Hawaii part of this country, even though it is, I'm just saying it just nobody, nobody, um, black or white looks right on that island. You have to be Hawaiian or, or Asian and you look fine. But we, we, the rest of us do not look right on an island.

Speaker 1:          00:27:45       We just don't. And then the joke was, when I fucking come here, you know, well, I lean up against the tree. I looked like an American. Like you can't tell me that. And I said, I'm so sick of these native Americans complain and f I have to argue with one more Apache. It was completely ridiculous and over the top, and everybody, one fucking moron on Twitter, he said, Bill, the reason why you look normal as this country, he's because capital letters you would, you killed all the native Americans. It's just like, dude arguing with the Paches didn't give it away. There's always going to be that one fucking person. It just has to fucking take it seriously and ruin it for everybody else. All right. Am I done whining? What else did I do this week? Oh, um, what did I do this week? I thought I did something. Oh, you know what? I haven't drank. I haven't drank in a seven days. It's been a week. And I realize now that it is, um, okay

Speaker 1:          00:28:51       that basically I have to go once I go seven days and I go and I get past something like going to a Superbowl party and I don't drink, then at that point I can go a year. Like now I could, I could go a fucking, it's that first week. Well I haven't drank in two days. I haven't drank in three days and I just think, well if I drink I can start over again. I can easily go for days and beat my streak once personally. Once I get seven days in, now I got to hit in the street going, you know, I got the hot bat here. I don't want to end the streak. I don't want to start over again at one. So I got through the Superbowl and it was brutal trying to get through it. Um, oh man, we had such a fucking great time.

Speaker 1:          00:29:33       And then in the end, right, cause we smoking this pork shoulder and the last time we had we had the temperature too high. And by we, I mean La head. Um, this time we slashed Lawhead had it lower and it took a lot longer, which it was totally worth it. But we watched the game and like two fa there took us two hours to watch the game, just flew through the whole fucking thing. And then by the end of the game, the pork roast, uh, the w was ready and the pork shoulder I should say was ready. And we just sat there and fucking Chow down laughing that we missed all of the bullshit. Um, and it was funny. Nia comes home and she's like, what'd you think of the game? We were like, yeah, we just finished it and blah, blah, blah. And then she starts talking about Bruno Mars and all that. We like, yeah, we didn't see it. She's like, it is. Oh, we didn't see it. So then she goes and we recorded the game. She goes and she rewinds it.

Speaker 2:          00:30:35       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:30:36       Are Fast Forwards, whatever the fuck she had to do to get to it. I guess we want rewind. Yeah, cause we watched it yet. I hit stop. Yeah. So she had a rewind back there and she goes to put it on in law, had sitting in my living room and it comes on and there's this creepy fucking singing of children in like in there, like all, they're backlit. So he sees this silhouettes and they're singing like, whoa, whoa, Whoa, that fucking Grinch music. Whatever the fuck they was singing, sort of holy sort of creepy pedophile music. Oh, there's so innocent. Let's let them sing innocent, creepy fucking church music. Right. And I look over at La and I go, Hey Jay, this is what me miss. And Jay was over in the corner and he just fucking look up and he just made this face. He just goes, but I've got to tell you, um, I actually watched, I did, and I, then I watched it.

Speaker 1:          00:31:32       Now that the game was over, I didn't give a fuck. And I actually really like Bruno Mars. I watched it. And uh, oh, what a halftime show that was, that was a tremendous show. Came out with the DW green spot, played a fucking drum solo. Oh, he was tremendous. What an entertainer did. The James Brown dance, Gillette peppers came out their shirts off. I fucking called that a call that I called it on Conan. I did Colin this week. I said flee was going to catch a cold cause he wasn't gonna wear a shirt and he should be the only one complaining about the web. Um, so anyway, so it was, it was fucking absolutely phenomenal. Superbowl some a Sunday and I did not have one fucking drop of alcohol. And uh, I feel great when I got to be honest, you'd not drinking is, uh, it's really hard right around four o'clock in the afternoon till about two in the morning.

Speaker 1:          00:32:34       Those 10 hours are hard. The other 14 are easy, you know, eight them, I sleep, you know, and I just got to get through six hours. But those other 10 men, I got to tell you, those are fucking brutal. But I'm a nice little streak here, so I'm going to try to go until my Canadian tour. And then once, you know, the Canadian tour starts, I mean, they got Cuban cigars up there. They got, it's just gonna be, uh, it's going to be cold. Who wants a Heda? So whatever. So I'm to, you know, it's funny, as I overheard somebody who wasn't a doctor say that, um, that basically, uh, to cleanse your liver, it takes 42 days to cleanse your liver. So like an idiot, I just don't drink for 40 days, 42 days thinking I'm cleansing my liver as I'm putting in all these fucking, you know, I'll eat at Mcdonald's once or I'll fucking just be eating processed fucking food.

Speaker 1:          00:33:32       I'm not cleansing my liver, but at least I got the alcohol out of there. Right? I'll drink a little water with some lemon, you know, I do what I tried to do, but you know, um, anyway, let's, uh, let's get to some advertising this week, everybody.

I'm feeling 40 minutes. Oh, 39 19. The internal clock of a comedian. Um, all right. Los Angeles water shortage. Hey there, Billy water. Well I heard Los Angeles is going through a doubt drought. Um, but what are people doing about it? Are People shutting off sprinklers? No, they're not. My friend says they still run the sidewalks, sprinklers in his neighborhood every night unless it rains for a few nights straight. How does this area come back from something like this? How does a, how's your doomsday bunker coming along?

Speaker 1:          00:39:56       Um, all right, here we go. Um, yeah, well basically people will run their sprinklers until the government says, Hey, don't run them anymore. So we haven't gotten to that point in the drought where it's, you can't run your sprinklers. So that's why people are still running them. And uh, it rained yesterday, so, uh, I think we're going to be all right. But, uh, I would ask you the same question. How was your doomsday bunker coming along? Um, personally I don't have one and I take great comfort in knowing that I can only die once and that, um, just without water I'll be dead within three days. So I've had an unbelievable life. I have no desire to survive the apocalypse, you know, just at the, just at the very basic level, the lack of toilet paper, toothbrush and toothpaste, that alone, you know, watching my teeth, turning brown, having a slowly yank them out, you know what I mean? The loss of electricity in listening to you stereo, that alone, it's, it's just, it's not worth living anymore.

Speaker 1:          00:41:14       You gonna to go back to fucking live in, in a clan, some God damn cave or some shit. I guess the garages will be the new caves of the, uh, I guess of the millennium here. Do you know? Oh, you know what? After the, uh, after the Superbowl was over, we all sat around the dining room table. I told you neo hooked up to because I was too stupid to figure it out. And uh, we put on dark side of the moon, which I have not listened to wire to wire in years. I would arguably, that might be the greatest album of all time. Um, I don't think anything can touch

Speaker 1:          00:41:55       and you know something, I hope that you got the, can somebody out there tell me, and this is a vinyl question, I want to know on album, what is there a better album to put the headphones on, lay in there and the duck and just listening to that album. And if you're young right now and your whole life has been digital downloads and all that, I highly urge that you get a stereo and you buy that album and put the fucking lights out and put the headphones on. You got it. You have to experience it. Like that's, that's, you know, we watch it. It was a bunch of old people there, you know, my age and a little bit younger and older, whatever. And we were talking about how fucking great the album was because nobody had heard it in a while. And uh, someone that was just sitting there going like this, that's what she did.

Speaker 1:          00:42:44       Like back in the day, like your parents be like, where you going? I'm going upstairs to listen to music. Like you just, you just listened to music. You weren't on a fucking treadmill doing night. He just, I don't, I mean, I, it, you did listen to the radio in the car, whatever, but it was different. You didn't have like your whole fucking playlist and Bluetooth and talking on the phone. It was just like, it would really was, it was an activity like, hey man, I got the new whatever record you want to come over and listen to it. And everyone would sit on the floor and do some drugs, man. And you'd put on the fucking album. I miss that. I never had that level. I never did the drug thing. Um, but, uh, I know that I just made me think of Philip Seymour Hoffman, man. What a fucking tragedy that is. Huh? Jesus Christ. You know what? I actually saw him? Um, I was dating this wonderful girl and I fucked it up of course, because I'm an idiot. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:43:41       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:43:41       And liked in late 1990s and Phillip Seymour Hoffman and John C. Reilly did a play called true west and they would switch parks every other show. And, uh, I went down with the, the woman I was dating at the time, she said, you gotta go, we gotta go see this. And I was just like, I don't want to go see so much. He play right. I was too busy doing stand up. And she's like, no, you got to fucking see this thing. And uh, went down and um, and got to see both. Both of them of course were unbelievable. And uh, it just, it's just a fucking worst. It's the worst. If I've learned anything in this business as I've gained a respect for a addiction and just, I dunno just how fucking

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       powerful that is. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:44:35       You know, I actually in a way like with like, even like with the, with like booze.

Speaker 2:          00:44:41       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:44:41       Like I, I'm trying to think the last time, maybe like a November, I went longer than seven days, but even then I fucked up after 10 days. And uh, I was talking to draw all man. We went over to d Rose's house apartment the other night. Me, Keith Robinson, de rose. I'm naming a lot of names here. I usually don't do this shit, but we got into this fucking debate.

Speaker 2:          00:45:04       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:45:05       I don't want to do this because you guys are going to blow up Joe's fucking Twitter. And he gets all fucking of sensitive about that shit. But we, well, me and Joe gonna going to be doing an uninformed again. We have to have the debate. It was basically, it's centered around a certain artists or certain artists and his, uh, unbelievable young wife and whether or not this person was a creeper, not and, oh, did it get heated? Joe Actually got so mad. You know, like when you get so mad, you're standing up and you imitate the other person in the argument while you're doing a dump dance. Like, I know what you're going to say. Woo. Started doing this dance. And everyone started laughing at him. It was fucking, I mean, it started at 1:00 AM I finally had to leave. I was like, I have a dog. I got to go home. Okay. I gotta take my dog out. I think I left a little bit after too, and I guess it kept going. Um, and of course the next day we fucking laughed about it. But, uh, God dammit. Nother fucking great guy. What was the last time? Well, I guess sometimes somebody who stinks. Overdoses. That's it. You don't, you don't wanna fucking wish that on anybody, but uh,

Speaker 2:          00:46:19       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:46:20       Everybody's talking about Philip Seymour Hoffman is amazing movies to talk about how great he is. How about how awesome he wasn't twister. That guy was such a great actor. He was even, he was even great in twister. I remember the first time I saw him was incentive a woman and I don't, I don't, all I remember was like, who to, who is that actor when he was sitting at that table and they had the one of the council there for the school? I can't, I can never remember what the fuck and movies are about. It was all the shit that he was doing when he wasn't speaking.

Speaker 2:          00:46:54       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:46:54       Um, oh, like in Boogie nights

Speaker 1:          00:46:58       when, how subtly they let you on dead. His character was gay when he was holding on to that clipboard and he was biting on that pen. The total fallot fucking, you know, we came up with that shit. Then I also loved the way he was standing in one of those scenes. He had like his right arm was down and then his left arm was across his body grabbing onto like his right elbow or vice versa, which I remember like how many kids who are really insecure used to stand like, you know, when you were a kid, we would size kids up and I'm in one of our, I saw a kid standing like that. It'd be like, all right, I don't have to worry about that kid trying to fucking kick the shit out of me. Anybody who stands like that is the guard. I didn't know that it meant garden.

Speaker 1:          00:47:48       I just thought it meant like you were a pussy or something like that. But I never saw an act or make a choice. Even though I, I've seen a zillion human beings do that. I saw him do that and like a boogie nights of Grady wasn't big Lebowski, just everything. I've never even seen Kapolei I'm embarrassed to say that, but uh, it just sucks, man. He was on my favorite stuff. Fucking blows that, right. That isn't, that isn't funny, right? This isn't what this is about, this podcast, his podcast is supposed to be making you laugh. Get you a great start to your day. Um, all right, let's, let's continue on here. So in answer to your question, sir, I have no plans for, uh, for the dooms day. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:48:28       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:48:28       I'm going to get a bat. That's what I'm going to do. I get a gun, but you know, I'm going to shoot it without earplugs. My ears already ring from playing drums and um,

Speaker 1:          00:48:45       I, I, you know, then what? Then I win the battle and then my ears ring even more and I'm walking around with Tinnitus and there's no fucking hope for a cure. Forget tonight is I'm just praying for toothpaste. I mean, fuck that. I don't want to live. All right. Sochi, is that how you say it? No. Yoshi, uh, Billy SSR. Have you heard how much the Olympics have costs so far? 5 billion. That's more than the last 12 Olympics combined. What do you think all the extra money is going, or where do you think all the extra money's going? Um, do you have any Olympic predictions?

Speaker 3:          00:49:23       MMM,

Speaker 1:          00:49:26       what I think all no extra money while they got to make all that snow and that extra snow in case it doesn't snow.

Speaker 3:          00:49:33       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:49:34       I mean, just to cover a mountain and snow when it hasn't snowed. I mean, I figured that's got to cost at least 2 billion. Right? And you know, I know it does. And how fucking now, what do I think of when I think it's an unbelievably corrupt country, even more than one than the one that I live in. So I imagine all the scams that go on here go on over there because they are human beings just like us. And I think it's probably even fucking 10 times worse over there because of where their jump off point was. We at least had a nice phony jump off point in this country that all men are equal and everybody has the freedom of speech and everybody has the right to protest and a no taxation without representation. We had a great fuck. We had a way better lie than they had in Russia.

Speaker 3:          00:50:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:50:21       You know, Russia's was just say everybody gets the same amount of Meatloaf, man. Right. At least from day one, we knew that there was going to be people gorging off high on the hog and the rest of us were getting pig feet. We knew that shit, but as long as someone else was just getting the tail, we were happy in the middle class and that worked for a long fucking time. And now it's over up. Dude. How about like these fucking hype about how about these fucking three major bankers have killed themselves and the last week and if we can get past well, bad things happen in threes. Um, that scares the shit out of me. I'm not going to lie to you. Those guys were probably all making seven to eight figures I would think.

Speaker 2:          00:51:14       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:51:15       And they fucking off themselves and there's no sign that a woman was involved that broke their hearts or you know, I just, that that is scary where they going to go rogue and say what was really going on? Are they just looking at that Ponzi scheme and just thinking like, yeah, there's just, there's no way to fix it. The wolves are at the door.

Speaker 1:          00:51:38       I'm going to be the Oswald. I'm going to be the fall guy. So they fucking get mad. It's just insane. What are the odds? What are the odds of that? What was the last time like three major oil people all killed themselves within the same week for the love of God. Can I get some conspiracy theory on this one? I would love to hear your theories. I'd love to hear him. You know, because that's the kind of guy I am. Um, all right, where are we? Let's get onto the next thing here. Long distance hiking followup. All right, here we go. Hey Bill. A few weeks ago you asked for advice on how to deal with animals in the wilderness. Most people that get mauled either left food in there. Oh yeah. That's why I this massive fear about going into the woods and accident accidentally stumbling upon a, uh, a mamma bear with her cubs or a, a, a mountain line.

Speaker 1:          00:52:32       I'm always on a trail. And to the left or the right of me is a higher like, like cliff and the thing is just sitting there. You don't, you know when they sit there and they put their head down and they're fucking shoulder and back muscles go like fucking like if they were in a muscle competition, like that would be like the Schwartzenegger like stance. They put their head down. You know what I'm saying? Just waiting to pounce on me. And this is what the project says. Most people get mauled either. Uh, most people that get mauled either left food in their tent or tried to pose for a picture with the animal or did some other dumb shit you would never do. But yes, on very rare occasions and animal will attack somebody who did nothing wrong. Here is my advice. If that happens, first of all, you did do something wrong.

Speaker 1:          00:53:17       You've ventured out into the wilderness, you left the tribe, you put yourself at risk. All right? I mean, I guess if you're in your backyard and there's a bear there, but if there's a bear in your backyard, you, that's urban sprawl that when he's not in your backyard, you're in his front yard. There's no fucking reason a bear should be outside your house. You need to move back down towards the village. You're right, they're antisocial. Get a hobby. Say hello to somebody you know, have a couple of drinks. Get some alcohol, courage, India, and go walk up to the pretty girl. Say Hello. Okay. Stop trying to live with the fucking house. All right? Bears. If you're attacked by a bear, you should leave your backpack on to protect your back and use your hands to cover your neck. What about your face? Usually the bear will leave after a while, but if it starts to chew on you, that's when you need to fight back. Oh, really? What? What should I go with? Should I set up the, you know, the overhand right with a couple of jabs or should I try to kick him in his, uh, bear balls? What if it's a woman? What do I do? Do. I try to stick my toe when it's badge. Uh, it's bare Vage it's badge. Um, mount wines with mountain lions playing dead will not work. You need to fight back right away. Your best chance is to aim for the nose and eyes. Dude, this is fucking hilarious.

Speaker 1:          00:54:48       I mean, I, I think I would have, this is none of this shit work wouldn't work against Mike Tyson. Forget about a fucking bear or a mountain line. Wolves playing dead won't work in a wolf attack either. You can either climb a tree, put it in a headlock, or shove your fist down its throat. I'm not joking. Look it up. You know what? I always thought you could do a, I don't know about it. A Wolf I always thought against this was my,

Speaker 2:          00:55:18       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:55:18       Well, you know, when I'm laying in bed and I'm thinking about getting attacked by a fucking, you know, some rabid dog or whatever, if somebody was sick, that dog on me when I'm laying in bed, totally relaxed and have my wits about me and I don't have a urine running down, my leg is, I run towards my Prius, like I wouldn't real life. I um, my plan of attack was when the fucking dog is coming at you, you stick your forearm out and you just feed it to them. You just jam it right into his fucking mouth and right as it climbs down and it has you, you then take your other fucking forearm and you come up over the top, smashed down on the top of the things neck. As you push your forum up and you break its neck, do you go Bam, which is the sound of a broken neck flap. I'm sorry, I don't want to make the snap noise. I don't have a twig in here. That's, that was my game plan. Either that or just stick your arm in there and you just, you just fucking start stepping on the dog's feet because dogs are kind of pussies, man. They'll go after you, but the second you fucking do something back to you, do you know what it is? They don't have any shame. They don't mind going and then getting hit and then going like, they don't give a shit.

Speaker 1:          00:56:49       It's not like other dogs again. They can literally do that and then go on the other side of the block and get laid. There's like, no, and they don't even remember what just happened and less, there's still pain in their little dog paws. So, um, I don't fucking know. I don't even know what I'm talking about here. These, these are all like, these are all creepy fucking questions. I always felt if I was on a boat and I saw an alligator swimming towards one of my friends and it went by the boat or a shark, I would just try to time it where I jumped down and I just fucking land right on its head. And I just figured that that alone would so freak it out. They would leave or you know, the shark or alligators would be, uh, would be feasting on to people.

Speaker 1:          00:57:36       That's what I would be worried about after the show, after the shock, you know, when the sharks, like what the few motherfucker, when it's coming back, that's what I think. Like sharks, I think just leave alligators. I, they just seem fucking relentless to me. Um, all right, killer bees. Here we go with killer bees. Africanized honey bees. You're supposed to run away for at least half a mile. Now this I know, do not flail your arms and do not kill one. They will swarm you if you kill one. But honestly they, they look just like normal bs to me. So I don't know how to tell when you're in danger. Oh my God. Run for a half a mile for fucking half a mile. What's the fastest, fastest mile I ever ran was like a six, 18 like freshman year in high school when I weighed about 140 something pounds and now a buck 75. So I think I could run maybe a seven minute, even with the fear, just the pain is going to offset the adrenaline. That's going to be a long 15 minutes. People. Oh God. Can you imagine me? Balding Stung up. Fucking swollen redhead,

Speaker 1:          00:58:55       just coming over their health. Jesus Christ. What a site. All right. Spiders kill almost nobody. Most can be very dangerous if you catch them at the wrong time. Some snake bites obviously require immediate medical care, but I would be more afraid of lightening if I were you. So yes, it can get gruesome, but these attacks are very rare. Absolutely. I mean, I know shark attacks a very rare, but it's just like, I would love to try surfing, but just, you know, just the fact that, you know, you got to stand that surfing is a sport where you're risking getting eaten alive. I mean, it's just fucking, I mean, it's just not worth it. Goddammit. It looks like fun though, doesn't it? But all right.

Then I talked a little bit of Shit and then I fucked up a lot in the last one, but still much better than the, uh, than the past there. All right, let's continue on here. Um, all right. Basic travel advice. A good morning. To our fearless leader, sir. Billiard of bald. Uh, I am 24, I'm a 24 year old and me and the wife are taking a trip to Chicago. Wanted some advice on a couple of things. Neither of us has ever planned on a, has ever been on a plane before. You are a frequent flyer. So why don't want it to know exactly what we can expect at the airport, when to be there. What close to prepare to take off at what time, problems we will mostly raw, most likely run into et cetera. Jesus Christ. Dude. Um, all right, well go ahead and pack and then take a third of that stuff and throw it over your fucking shoulder cause you never gonna wear it.

Speaker 1:          01:04:29       Um, depending on how long you're leaving, if it's just a weekend, I would go with the carry on. If it isn't, I would check everything, walk onto the plane with a couple of magazines in order a drink and watch and just enjoy watching everybody else fighting, you know, for that overhead space. Fuck them. Um, that would be my advice. And also just know that your wife is going to bring half the fucking house and it's not worth telling her that she's not going to need it. All right. Um, the only thing worse than having to pay for extra bags is watching her cry that there's nothing to wear. And then having to go downstairs to the fucking lobby mall there and pay 10 times the price to get her a fucking dress. All right. Number two, best places to eat there. Best Burgers of pizza. A personal favorite too.

Speaker 1:          01:05:19       I would like to add than I am milk white and red headed like you. So place that is not in the stabby stabby Magee Magee part of town would be preferred. Really wanting some advice from an experienced vet. Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. Um, I don't know where the best places already eaten Chicago. Like I visit there and I just eat it the closest place and then I go and do my show according to Jim Croce. Uh, the south side, the south side of Chicago is the baddest part of town. MMM. But if you go down there, you better best be ware of a man named Leroy Brown. And um, I believe he has a custom continental and he has a Cadillac to, he got it. 32 gun in his pocket, full fun. He got raised up any shoe Ratto and he's bad, bad. Um, I don't know where to fucking eat there.

Speaker 1:          01:06:13       All I know is that a, what you should do, you can find all of that out on a website. One of those Foodie fucking websites. They'll tell you where to go. Um, so, but it's, those foody things can be wrong. A lot of the times what you want to do is ask a local whatever you stay, just find somebody who has a heavy Chicago accent and just say, listen, I'm a tourist. I don't want to go to the touristy place. Where do you go to get whatever the fuck you're looking for? You want a pizza? You want a burger? And that guy will tell you, all right, that's the way to do it. Okay, here we go. All right. Uh, oh, by the way, you know, I forgot to mention when I saw that drum clinic, the common thread one, there was a musician there, uh, drew of a band called drew of the drew. Um, if you like not mainstream music and you'd like to see somebody who's really trying to do something different, uh, check that guy out.

Speaker 2:          01:07:09       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:07:10       Um, I was, I was very, uh, very impressed. It made me feel old, like they would, they would draw in from shit that like, to me, I already considered like new music. Like all that Dj Dubstep Shit like to me is like came out in the last six months even though it's probably been around for fucking 20 years. Um, anyways, drew of the drew, check it out. Anyways, Jane. Oh, phobia. Maybe I'll, I'll put up, I'll put up a link actually. A Billy bobag. Baggins is it gain or phobia you afraid of the gynecologists a fucking, uh, I am a 28 year old college guy. Who has, was it Jane or Phobia? The fear of women? I've never heard of this. Uh, he said, when I was a kid, I used to get the shit kicked out of me, and girls would always spread rumors about me and it would really screw with my mind. Wait a minute, you didn't get along with men or women.

Speaker 1:          01:08:11       Well, what were you, what were you doing? You know what? That's the last thing needed to hear. Well, what's wrong with you? I'm sorry. Forgive me. I'm not a trained professional, so you know, you're asking more on and you know I'm going to behave accordingly. Here we go. As I grew up, I started to resent and hate all the people around me that my mother tells me about false rape accusations. And that makes, oh, and that makes females look even more scarier than they already were. See, guys, just kick the shit out of you. Females psychologically fuck you up bad and don't even have a tint of remorse or empathy. Jesus Christ. All right, dude. So your mother's a psycho and she put all these fears on you. Yeah, you gotta maybe I would seek some professional help before you turn it into Norman Bates. Uh, all right, let's continue this then. I hear about all the women raping men in the divorce courts and in general adding more fuel to the fear. Dude, you're over thinking this shit. I mean, you probably heard half of that from me, but I'm an idiot. Don't listen to me. He says, gotten to the point where when a female introduces herself to me, I just see her as a potential mind raping and prolonged exercise of getting verbally abused. So I just always say sorry, but I have somewhere to be right now. Goodbye.

Speaker 3:          01:09:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:09:38       And I walk away, sir, can I steal that from you? I want to use that next time they get pulled over. Yeah. License Reza. Sorry. When I have somewhere to be right now, goodbye. And you just, just act like the rain man and they'll fucking leave you alone. That's actually brilliant. Uh, he said they scare me so much, but I'm still attracted to them. Oh my God, Dude. You listen, you gotta you gotta you gotta get past this. Hopefully you're still young and this is early on, but this is something where you were, you know, everybody is trying to go towards the uh, late, we'll just call it a whatever planet live happily ever after. But if you're off by just one degree, you're not really going to notice when you're 22, 24, you know, but by the time you're 40, you're going to be about a million miles off course.

Speaker 1:          01:10:28       So let's try to get you some help. I would go see a therapist or, um, and I know I've been joking around, but I kind of have to do that because this is a podcast. But, um, well actually because it's a podcast, it's supposed to be funny. I'm not saying you can't have a series podcast. Um, yeah, I would go get some help quickly and I would get rid of all those fears. And I would say a lot of the fears are probably, uh, put into your head by your mom when you were really young and you need to try to get those out of there before they take any more route than they already do already have. Well, it's finished here. He said, my mind says, stay the fuck away while my Dick says do it. Do it. Fucking do it. Uh, but in this climate of unrestrained female

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       hypo agents, and what the fuck that mean? This shit that makes women invade male spaces, it makes them change everything to suit them. Dude, dude, you're taking your fucking fear of women. You're, yeah, you're, you're blowing by me. Listen, are you a great guy? If you're a great guy, there's a great woman out there for you and the, and it's a beautiful thing then not all like this. What you're doing is you're taking the worst of the worst of females and you're printing it with a broad brush. All right? Um, oh, Jesus Christ. I'm relating to this guy here. He said, I'd rather stay celibate for life. All right. Now I don't relate to that. I am a loner to a vast degree, but I got a loving family to back me up so I ain't on the fringe or anything. I plan on just working towards my career and it did. I write this like 20 years ago. Jesus Christ plan on just working towards my career in education. But either way I'll have to deal with women and it's been hard to do since lately too. So lately since my social skills tanked over the last nine months.

Speaker 2:          01:12:18       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:12:18       Trauma, Conga Line of horrific events happened and I am working on getting the confidence back through Brazilian Jujitsu already lost 11 pounds and I'm starting to feel a lot better. All right, well just don't go choke out any women. All right, I'll try to put them in the triangle. He said anyways, is there any way, but martial arts are a great way to uh, build self esteem from what I've heard anyways. Is there any, is there any way to get rid of the insane fear I have about women or is it just 15 years of hurt that'll take almost forever an undo. Thanks. And go fuck yourself six ways from Sunday and good luck with your standup. Um, all right, I'll see. You were only 15 is that what you're saying? All right dude. First of all, it's great you took up Brazilian Jujitsu. We should know how to defend yourself.

Speaker 1:          01:13:03       And a don't be a content about it. When you become a black belt, uh, use it to save nerds and protect yourself, but never be a bully. Um, and then as far as women, I would actually try and talk to somebody about this and I would try to have more of an open mind because right now if you're only 15 years old or even if you're young in your early twenties, mid twenties, you're basically, you got the lottery pick as far as women goes. All right. They're all available. All first round draft picks, bunch of first round draft picks just sitting there and you know, depending on when you open your mouth and start talking to one is when you pick in the draft, if you know what I mean. Sooner rather than later. But I would just talk to somebody about, um, about, about some of your issues. Maybe it's school, they got some free fucking therapy or something like that if you're too young to pay for it.

Speaker 2:          01:13:58       But, um,

Speaker 1:          01:14:01       I dunno, I would talk to somebody, I would talk to some of your guy friends about it. I would, you know what I would do, I would openly talk about your fear of women to, um, to friends. You know, and I would, I would sit down with your mother and just say, listen, I have major issues with women right now. And I think some of it stems from a lot of the negative things that you've said about them. And I need you to stop doing that because it's fucking with me. Don't, don't say that part, but say it in a nicer way. Um, but if she's, you know, I dunno.

Speaker 2:          01:14:38       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:14:38       That's the hardest fucking thing is because you are born into the religion of your parents ain't no and into all of their beliefs. And hopefully they have more good than bad, but they're human. So they're going to be wrong. And you know, when you're a little toddler all the way through like seven, eight years old, your parents are God. Like you just think they know everything and they have all the answers. They never look unsure. You do everything that they fucking say.

Speaker 2:          01:15:06       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:15:07       So a lot of that stuff just really takes deep root. Like, it's, it's law in your head and then he is a teenage years. Did you start breaking away? You realize some of his bullshit and let's win. Some anger can come out and that type of stuff. So I would say what you're going through is normal. It's just that you maybe had an extreme, a helping of some fucking anti woman shit, which I can relate to because I did too. When I had to fight through that shit. I mean it took me out and get married till I was 45. I had made your fucking issues. But uh, it's like anything, look, it, just use the martial arts thing as a, a metaphor or a simile, whatever the fuck you're supposed to. Whatever the right terminology is. Look at you. You did that. You stuck with that.

Speaker 1:          01:15:54       You lost 11 pounds. You work towards that. Look at, look at what you're, you're getting, you're getting positive results and it hasn't been easy. Right? But You keep showing up. You get positive results. I would do the same thing with your women issues. I would just start working on it. Um, you know, next time a woman comes up and says hello, don't say I have somewhere to go. Just say hello back and stay in the conversation for as long as you can. And when you feel like Bailey, just say, listen, I'm really shy around women and it's something that I'm trying to work on. Just put it out there. And you know what I guarantee 80% of them are going to say, oh, you know, when they do that, they're going to love it. And next thing you know, you're out there watching a romantic comedy with some lady having a good time.

Speaker 1:          01:16:40       But I would, I would address it sooner than later. I'm telling you, dude, it's you literally, it's, you think it's a mountain. It's, it's a fucking, it's stepping up onto the curb. It's all in your head. And that's totally normal because I would guess that your fears started when you were in your, my mom's godlike phase of your life. So you think, you think it's, uh, what's that fucking mountain everybody. Everest that everybody tries to climb up. It isn't. It isn't. Okay. It's a little fucking ant hill. And Don, you can do it. All right. I believe in you. Good luck, sir. There you go. Well, that's the podcast for this week. Congratulations to the, um, to the Seattle Seahawks. All right. You finally won. You fucking won the Superbowl and now I can't give you any more shit. Actually, I still will just stop doing that loudest crowd ever. Right? You got the fucking trophy. You been there now act like you've been there before. Do not disappoint me next year. You know, it's, you know, it's coming next year. You know, it is. There's going to be so many people dressed up like characters. You're going to make the raider fans, I don't even know what the expression is. I don't know what happened. Jesus Christ, whatever happened in that rate of fan base, that crushes me every time they panned to the end zone and everybody's out there. Somebody dressed like Fred Flintstone. It's like, what are you doing?

Speaker 1:          01:18:08       I'm all right. That's the podcast. Oh, by the way, and I forgot to, I have been watching our, actually, I watched a bunch of hockey this week because of, uh, you know, I didn't watch, watch any of the Superbowl hype, but Gee, Oh gee. [inaudible] with that Bruins performance against the Canadians. Jesus Christ. How do you not get up for a game against the Canadians? I know the Canadians have a good team, but Jesus Christ, we looked fucking horrific. Um, but it's good though. It's all good. Canadians have a good team, so hopefully we'll meet each other in the playoffs. Playoffs and a, we'll have another classic. That's what I'm hoping for. So, uh, all right. That's it. I'm at, where the hell am I? This week? I'm going to be in a casino in a outside of Minneapolis. It's already sold out, so thank you to everybody in Davenport and every other goddamn city out there in Minnesota. And I can't wait to get out there. Hopefully it doesn't fucking snow too bad. And I'm able to land without incident. All right, that's it. I'll talk to you next week. Go fuck yourselves.
