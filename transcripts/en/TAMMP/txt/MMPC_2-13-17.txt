Huh? Y'All, how you doing over there? Why is it, why is Friday the 13th on lucky and Monday the 13th all that's just fucking fuck. You know who was a pussy? You came up with that one.

You down their eyeball and one of the ladies, yeah, you come up to her, you tell her you like her striped shirt. Start bitching about the horrible day you had. You know, and she's a woman, so she'll listen to it.

Speaker 1:          00:00:56       She'll kick into that motherly instinct unless she already has kids and then she doesn't have time for it, you know? Then she looks at, just says, listen, I made sucking your Dick Guy. Right? So you get the fuck out of here and then you move on to something yoga. It's not how it goes. Why? What is so fucking unlucky? You know what? I didn't even know it was going to. I gotta look this up now. Why is Friday the 13th unlucky? Hang on his stomach. Hit pause for a second. All right, before I can, I just looked it up. I didn't read any. I just got, I just got to the Google thing where they got whatever it is on the first page. All right. Whose kid know with the Internet, whatever the fact is, the fact is whatever you look up within the first two fucking clicks on the first page becomes the truth. That's it. Okay, so that's what the fuck I'm looking at. You know if the right answer to any question is fucking beyond what you have to scroll down on the first page of any subject on a of the Internet, it's, it's over. No one's ever going to know the truth because it, who? Who the fuck ever goes to page 14

Speaker 1:          00:01:57       Not even journalists do that. They don't give a shit. I'm all right. I'm going to say it either has to do with, uh, it's gotta be religious. It's gotta be religious. Jesus did something. He always had bad Friday's, didn't he? No. He had a good Friday. Good. Today's Good Friday. What happened on Good Friday? Then the little rock roll back and he came walking out, you know, like one of those fucking movies where they thought they killed the guy and he didn't. And then he comes back step, not like Tom Sawyer fucking creep hanging out at his own funeral. I was done with that kid once he did. That shows that these kids are fucking Weirdo. I'm all right. Friday the 13th. Why is it unlucky and other facts about the worst day in the calendar? In the calendar, not on the calendar. We're in it. We're not in it. We're not on it. All right. Finally, 13th considered by many as one of the unluckiest days of the year is almost here again. This is from January, 2017. Uh Oh shit. January 13th well fuck. Nothing happened to us. If he's still alive. If you're worried about what's in storable Bababa, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. What the fuck in 2000 here's some of the fun facts.

Speaker 1:          00:03:12       When is the next Friday? The 13th and why? Stupid. All right, baby. We'll orange origins. All right. Course. It always goes back to the Bible. Oh, Jesus. His Dad's mad. Dad's coming home. He's not in a good fucking mood. He had a bad week, you know? Of course it's the kid's fault. Stupid cunt. He tried to build everything in six fucking days. Typical do it yourself job. Why didn't you farm it out to someone in know what the fuck they were doing? Built the thing up to code yet. Dope fucking stick in a steel beam in the middle of a fucking wood wall. Yeah. Everything above it is supported better. What about below it? Debt. What about below it? The fuck did this music come from? All right, let's read with this music on in the background. Superstition about this day is not to have, I can't do this. Start to have come about. All right. That's enough of that. During the Middle Ages in many have biblical origin. Some historians have claimed it was the day on which eve bit the apple from the tree of knowledge. Jesus Christ.

Speaker 2:          00:04:22       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:04:23       Hold it just scared the shit out of me. Nia. The lovely near everybody. Oh, with my beautiful daughter. Two lovely ladies. What's going on? Uh, I thought you were done. Sorry. No, I was watching the videos that people sent me this week. What's going on? Are you going to drop her off? No, I can't do the podcast the way I talk. That's why I was in here with the door closed. It's a pocket door, by the way. If you wonder why, just squeak. Like we live in a haunted house. No, I just found another, I just saw another place that uh, I want to show you that maybe you wanted to order from. Yeah, just order me something remotely healthy. Okay. Something to stave off the calories. I consume an alcohol. Okay. Would you like some sort of like a, a bowl with rice and Tofu and that sorta thing?

Speaker 1:          00:05:09       I hate Tofu. It's gotta be a real dead animal and vegetables. Okay. So you want, you want meat so I shouldn't order from a vegan place then I like I vegan. As long as there's none of that Tofu. I don't understand what that stuff is. That's like the type of shit that they seal capsule with some Tofu. Yeah. So liquid doesn't be good. It's not good for you. Tell us who is not good for you. No. Are you sure you're thinking until four or you when a TOEFL doesn't come from a tree, does it? There's no tofu trees. I thought Tofu was made from soybeans. Yeah, but isn't so bad for you. No. Always. I have no idea. Let me get your phone for you. I don't know. Just if you're going to order from a Vegan place, just get me vegetables. Shit that I, I, you know, I know what I know what it is. I Dunno what Tofu was. It's like fucking allergy or something. Okay. All right. Shuffles Nia. Do you know why Friday the 13th is unlucky? I Dunno either. I've been reading about it here. The new, and then they started to say that Eve fucking maybe bit the apple. Oh, they were in paradise. There was no calendar. What do they have to worry about? Snow bills. I, you have to go to work. Right. You know, what did they do in, in, in fucking eat off shit.

Speaker 3:          00:06:25       No salad though.

Speaker 1:          00:06:27       I was an honor to stand. Why? If it was paradise, why they had a fucking snake in there trying to fuck everything up.

Speaker 3:          00:06:34       The devil.

Speaker 1:          00:06:35       Yeah. But that's on God

Speaker 3:          00:06:38       to separate.

Speaker 1:          00:06:40       They're not to say if God made everything else made. He also made the comment of all cons. Did he not?

Speaker 3:          00:06:46       Oh No. But the devil was an Angela like cast out.

Speaker 1:          00:06:49       So the devil was basically a bad hire. Yes. It came back and tried to take his company down. All right. Yeah. Okay. Let me finish reading this. Okay. And the New Testament, um, I love, or they blame the woman. Like that's why everything's all fucked up. I mean, without a doubt, if you told a broad, did not go over there and eat the fucking apple, she's going to be intrigued.

Speaker 3:          00:07:10       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:07:11       You know, like a guy wouldn't. Whatever you did, that's still classic thing. Like it's substitute teaching. Whatever you do, don't laugh. Next person who labs gets to tension, that's it. You're done. You fucking squeeze in your nose doing that fucking little kid laugh. That's it. Next thing you know, you're missing a week of research, uh, recess. That's why you got all these fed fucking kids. The regular teacher takes the day off to substitute. Teacher creates the tension though. The one skinny kid starts laughing and then he's done. He's eating that fucking food down in the cafeteria that's got all the preservatives in it. Do you know if you fucking kill somebody younger and nobody figures it out, you're not in the clear for a good 40 years. That's how long the digging people up from 12 years ago in there. Then it's like they took a fucking nap.

Speaker 3:          00:07:56       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:56       Hey, I'll tell you these people, they're full of preservatives, you know? All right, and the New Testament.

Speaker 4:          00:15:18       What? It's absolutely absurd for you to not know when things are anymore. It's like you're a grown ass man and he's got all dressed to go to the, why is it always grown ass? Why can't you say you're a grown up? I can say whatever I want to say and I'm choosing to say that you're a grown ass man who can't seem to write anything and is that because you're a strong woman to the point where you're going to get all dressed up and be like, well, what am I going to wear? There's nothing the other, and then you come downstairs five minutes later like, well, it's next week with you. You need to get it together. It's not cute.

Speaker 2:          00:15:52       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:15:55       Yeah. That's like the first thing I've screwed up like that a long time. I have a bunch of events in my phone right in the calendar section we're getting when things are, you're always getting the dates wrong and it's frustrating. It's just annoying.

We'll stop acting like I'm in some shooting heroin in an alley acting like a shooting heroin in an alley, but you just need, I just don't understand why you can't ever get your schedules to, hey, you're always getting the dates wrong. Like, oh, it's tomorrow. Not Today. It's next week. Not this week. Like I don't, I don't get it.

Speaker 1:          00:16:31       Yeah, I'm busy and I don't have an assistant.

Check it out if he, if he, if feel like it, you like it, whatever. What are you going to do? Um,

Speaker 1:          00:22:30       anyways. All right, let's, uh, let's talk about the world of sports as I always do, as I eventually do, as I always make my way back to the old bread and circus here. Um, Bruce Cassidy, new coach of the Boston Bruins, former player, came up with the Blackhawks and like the eighties, and unfortunately I'd like three or four knee injuries. This is all I know about the guy. And then, um, he paid his fucking dues as a coach coming up. My favorite stopped that he had on the way up, he coached for the Jacksonville Lizard Kinks, which, you know, I'm throwing and I'm throwing my vote and that's one of the best, uh,

Speaker 3:          00:23:09       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:10       It's one of the best fucking names from minor league tema the Lizard kinks. It's a reference to the doors. They got a bunch of reptiles in Florida and fucking Jim Morrison got arrested in Florida for allegedly taking his dick out. Also known in some circles as you lizard and who doesn't want to be a king? You know, if you've got the Sacramento Kings, you got the La kings and he got the Jacksonville Lizard kinks. Um, anyways, he's undefeated so far, you know, granted, you know, we were playing their best hockey I felt to this season when I, when he took over. But uh, this is the new guy, you know, I got to a support there. Um, what's his face posture? Knock with the fucking, uh, with the game winner against the Vancouver Canucks after he made it very sketchy pass in the first period. He makes it up fucking unbelievable. K down the fucking left side, slammed on the brakes, just like I do it, pick up hockey except he actually stopped rather than continuing into the boards and hurting himself. Um, and then fucking little, whatever the fuck he did, he put it in. It was fantastic. Oh, it was tremendous. Um, but I got to tell you guys about the greatest sporting event I think I've been to since I went to the, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:24:29       New England patriots first Los Angeles Rams when we won our first super bowl and all I can tell you about Duke at Cameron indoor arena. It's like

Speaker 1:          00:24:42       how loud the crowd was with Vinod Terry kicked that field goal. It was that loud, the whole fucking game. I've never been to anything like it. And we sat in the low, he was sitting in center court. I thought we're going to be behind the bench. Sorry about that. We would send a court, um, not on the student's side across from them in the lower area. And Dude, I'll tell you, there's no fucking way to get out of there. There's no way to go to the bathroom. There's no way to fucking, there's nobody coming around a concessions. You are fucked. You are in there. And that is it. Old School. Fucking barn. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:25:23       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:25:23       You went in, it's so small. I guess it holds like 9,000 people, but you have, you felt like you were in there with like 200 people and we came in and it was already, uh, they were already shooting around before the game and uh, we finally got to our seats. Like you just don't think that you seats are even going to be there because everybody is so jammed in. And um, we didn't sit down for the whole fucking game. I guess I started sitting down during timeouts cause I'm old and I got to tell you, I've never, I've never seen an atmosphere like that ever. This beats everything. I've been to the NCAA. Uh, the championship game was in the fucking Georgia dome. So I mean that's a shitty place to watch a basketball game. Even if people go nuts, it just floats up to the top of the, the, the, the dom and you don't even hear it. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:26:14       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:26:15       I've just, I, I don't even know what, I didn't know where to begin. And then it was an unbelievable game, just back and forth, back and forth when it looked like you was going to pull away, Duke would come back. Then it looked like Duke was going to have the game on ice and then you wouldn't see, would come back. Somebody hit a three, someone else would hit a fucking three was unbelievable. And I was very impressed with both teams. I like that kid on UNC number 44. He doesn't rattle. He doesn't fucking act like he changed the game of basketball when he hits a shot he gave a fuck about was winning. He had some big three pointer and then they immediately called timeout and rather than thumping his own chest and acting like he's in Braveheart, he came back to the bench high fiber.

Speaker 1:          00:26:54       Do you see he was pissed because they just said just let up an easy bucket before he hit his three. And um, I don't know. I don't know shit about anything, but if I was a scout I would pay attention to that just as much as somebody's actually doing great things out on the court. And um, it was insane. Dude. Fucking coach k coming out. I just, I'm reminded me of when I, when I went to the king's game, when they wrapped it up one time to win a Stanley Cup and I saw them bring the Stanley Cup out. It was like that except it could walk around talking. So I want to thank, uh, I want to thank my call at the comedy zone in Charlotte for two awesome shows. And thank you so much for getting us in touch with a person that hooked us up with the tickets a me versus the bar, Nick. We're all sitting there going, I think that might've been the greatest sporting event I went to. Obviously seeing the Patriots win the super bowl was bigger, but um, the level of excitement. I, I just never been, never been to anything like that. And uh, if you ever get a fucking chance, um, that is definitely one worth stub. Hobbing

Speaker 3:          00:28:02       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:28:04       Oh, the college give fucking the students were crazy and they had all these funny chance and I'm sure everybody's going to say all they stole this from you. They stole this from this guy and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I don't fucking know. But it was making me laugh. You don't want anyone to introduce in the UNC players, I'll just use my name. They just say, yeah, play in fucking point guide number fucking zero bill burr. And then the whole student section just goes, hi bill, you suck. And they just did it through the whole thing. It was childish. It was fucking hilarious. They started chanting. I couldn't tell what they were chanting, and then I gradually figured it out. It was crazy towel guy. I was like, crazy. What the fuck are they saying? Crazy? What? And people start turning around looking at us, and then I realized, I look and be honest, and we look up and all of a sudden this fucking old guy gets up, starts whipping this towel around his head, this old fucking lunatic. I'm like, oh, I guess that's, I guess that's the crazy towel guy,

Speaker 3:          00:29:01       right?

Speaker 1:          00:29:03       So it's going back and forth, back and forth, all these crazy chance. You let your whole team down all of this shit. The next scene, oh, it's like halftime. We're sitting there going like, dude, what the fuck was that? That was 20 minutes of basketball. They felt like a minute.

Speaker 1:          00:29:17       My ears were ringing. Like I'd gone to a concert and there's still another half to play. Then all of a sudden this Asian lady comes out, this Asian lady coming out on like a fucking three story unicycle and she's doing that act where you, you're fucking, you flip the saucer Rania head. Okay. Which I had seen before. I've seen the act done before. I never seen it live, but was fucking hilarious. Versie and bar nick had never seen that, that saying I wasn't blown away. I was definitely blown away. So she, she goes to like flip it on. I had no, first of all, you know when you stop on a Unicycle, he can't just stop. You've got to do that front, back, front, back, front, back to, and now she's doing that with one foot on the fucking pedal. She's got a God damn soup bowl on one of our, the end of our feet on her toes.

Speaker 1:          00:30:06       You under your feet. A lot of people notice your toes, right? So everybody's sitting there, right? She fucking flips it. It does like a triple Lindy and lands on the top of her head and everybody, everybody's just like, ah, Shit. Right. So then she fucking what? The thing's still on her fucking head. A little soup kitchen. A Cup, dare, right. She rides down to another, the other corner of the basketball court. Now she puts two down. Now. First he starts going, no way, no fucking way. No fuck away air right there, Fred. It fucking lands whole crowd. Oh Shit. Then she goes to do three, so she's got one upright. The others upside down the other is upright, just going like right up her fucking Shin and she fucking landed that in forsee stood up. You ever see what black people go to church and when they call it catching the holy ghost, that's what looked like happened to Paul Versey.

Speaker 1:          00:31:02       Everybody was sitting down first. He stood up and applauded. I'm fucking dying laughing. She goes to four balls. Everybody's like, no shit. Four balls go on the air. Land right on the head. One, two, three, four, whole crop, right? Then she goes down, her closing bit, not one, not two, not three or four. She puts five fucking soup bowls. It's all the way up to her knee. Okay. Oh, I forgot to tell you this. This guy is like flipping the balls. So he flipped one tour and he fucking threw a too short and she dropped it and I was going, I fucking just jinxed her. He just fucked with their rhythm. It's like calling a timeout to ice the kicker. So she's got five flips him up in the fucking air. One, two, three, four and the fifth one bounced off my head. Everybody's like, ah, ah Jeez. There is no Santa Claus, right? You know what she said? She said, fuck that. Set them up again. Right? Teaching these kids, these fucking millennials or whatever the fuck you call these kids nowadays, these kids who grew up with knee pads, elbow pads and helmets, when they rode bicycles,

Speaker 1:          00:32:18       they had play dates. They, they weren't left alone in the company of adults that no one really knew who they were. These, these kids were sheltered. They don't know how to make a comeback. These kids get drunk. They Call Uber, right? Everything's just set up for, so they don't know how to fucking pull themselves off the mat, you know? Well, let me tell you something. This lady on this one fucking tired bicycle, she showed them how cause she said, hey, fuck head, I don't give a shit that you throw me five more. She set him up again, right. Flip them in the air. Landed all five fucking place goes nuts. Just as loud as the God damned. Almost as loud as the fucking game. There was no break. There was no break in the excitement. That fucking edge will look and go, what the fuck did we just say? An outcomes coach, k fucking Duke and UNC and it gets loud again. More and more singing, more fucking screaming

Speaker 1:          00:33:15       came all the way down. Duke finally put the game away with like a fucking minute left with a couple of foul shots. And, uh, I would just sat there in the last few seconds when I knew that Duke was going to win. And I just looked at, looked around, looked at everything I could look at, try to make as enough mental pictures as I could to take it in, because I knew I was just like, I don't know if I'll ever get back to, to seeing one of these again. But, um, I dunno if that didn't sell you, I'm fucking Gig. You got to do it. That is a dude. Fuck Madison Square Garden. It's a mecca. Fuck that place. You can go down there and see the fucking ice. Capades save your money. Go on stub hub. All right. Go on stub hub and, and just get yourself some tickets and go there. You will not be disappointed and you got to go. Well, coachK is still there.

Speaker 1:          00:41:20       Do we have anything else? Hey, what is all this attacking on fake news lately? I don't understand it. Why is the government getting so mad at fake news? It's so fucking hilarious watching them getting up, getting upset about that. Hey, don't read their fake news. Read our fake news. Read our version of the fucking, it's all fake fucking news. Have you ever gotten into a car accident? Little fender bender and the cop shows up. Are you a police officer? Have you ever heard two people tell you the exact same story? This fucking guy came out of fucking nowhere. Then you go over the other guy. What happened? I came out of fucking nowhere. I wasn't even looking. Never happens. It's all fake news. It's, it's all opinions, right? For the most part. Other than, you know, if somebody dies, this guy is fucking dead. Okay. You can agree on that. How he died. Why died? Who's, who's responsible? Oh, Jesus Christ belt. We get it. Okay. That's all I'm saying. That's all. That's all I'm really saying. All right, let's get to, well, let's get to the content here. Um, the read some, uh, some of your letters here. Alright, Yoko Ono makes Julian Lennon by letters he wrote to his dad at auction. All right, Bill, is there a worst woman in history? I hate to be happy. I know the Beatles days were numbered. It wasn't just her, but it didn't help. Yeah. But at the end of the day, John Shows her,

Speaker 1:          00:42:46       this is what happened. Something happened between John and his mom and she died, or she fucking, I dunno, she beat him with a wooden spoon. I forget how the fucking story went. All right. But whatever she did or if she died, it's not her fault. It left him with the psychological makeup to be susceptible to not trying to just find a mate. He also wanted a mom.

Speaker 2:          00:43:11       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:43:11       And all she had to do was make some cookies. All right. Make him some cookies on his fucking birthday, whatever the fuck he wanted. And then that was it. This guy was done, you know, I think he would eat all if he lived they somewhere in his mid forties he just would have been like, all right. You know what? What the fuck was that? Maybe you would've got out. Maybe. Maybe he liked it. I have no idea. But anyway, so let's continue. He said, then there's the video.

Speaker 2:          00:43:40       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:43:41       Will you call her out for screeching like a maniac during a powerful moment in history. Now she won't give her husband's son some paper he gave his dad 20 years earlier. This story might be a bit old, but it doesn't seem to make, but it doesn't make it any less true. I watched the clip, what it is, what she auctioned off a bunch of his shit is what it is. She's not making him pay for it. She sold it and Julian wants to get it back. But because Yoko sold it, um, he has to buy it back now I in defensive for what I would say is the cash cow died. It's not like Yoko could go out and fucking sell, take a records like a beetle. So all of a sudden she's gone like, Holy Fuck, how am I still going to be able to live in the, in the Dakota? So she selling all his shit or maybe her husband died. She wanted a fucking move on and didn't want to look at all his old shit. You know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          00:44:40       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:44:41       I have no idea. Um, but yeah, I watched a little of that video. Julian definitely goes hard on our end, says, uh, that you think, see, she's extremely manipulative and that, um, she knew what the fuck she was doing from day one and I can't remember did that's actually his mother. I Dunno. How is he related that you, who the fuck knows? I don't know. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:45:06       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:45:07       Is there a worst woman in history? Yeah, there's way worse women, those women that ran empires and had people killed, you know, for whatever fucking reason. You know, the, the, the story of scar face. The second one, the one that Pachino did was based on a, a, you know, there was the original movie, but the stories that they used in, in the, the second one, uh, we're based on a drug dealer of that time who actually was a woman. So, I mean, yeah, I would say if she was worse, you know, having people shot in the fucking street is probably worse than a sell on some postcards. But you know, it's all up to interpretation. You know, this is the new me, the new meditating bill, the mood more relaxed bill who's undoing the fucking knots of anxiety in his mind? I cannot say enough about the fucking meditating.

Speaker 5:          00:46:02       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:46:04       Now that I'm not trying to like get good at it, I'm just trying to do it.

Speaker 5:          00:46:08       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:46:10       I don't flip out to the level I used to like I think, you know, say like 10 is the worst flipping out. I think I used to walk around, just walk around on a good day. I was already at a six compared to how most people are when they're just like totally chill it out. So it was a very quick and easy trip up to 10. Now I feel like I walk around it like a three. I feel like I've cut it in half. So now when I flip out, I kind of just go to six, which is still totally unacceptable for most social situations. I still flip out and people look over their shoulders startled, but not with the level of, of what the fuck. You know what I mean? It reminds you this time I saw I was on like highway eight or something interstate eight, I think it was in Arizona and New Mexico. I know where the fuck was that and this bull, it's somehow

Speaker 1:          00:47:10       gotten free. I mean I was in the middle of fucking nowhere. I was and there was two cowboys right on horses and these are cowboys. They're trying to fucking rope a God damn bull, which I didn't know if he could do, I don't what the fuck they were doing. So one of them is trying to distract the bull is the other one is on a horse that is sneaking up behind it and, and the horse is sneaking up the way horses sneak up in a fucking cartoon and this bull at the last second figured it out and he fucking turned around. You know that look Bruce Willis always does when he looks over his shoulder and die hard. It's the same thing except it was a fucking bull. That's the look that people, when I would lose my shit prior to meditate, I would get that look. Everyone would fucking turn around. Like, you know, the skyscraper was on fire and it was just some fucking balding redhead flipping out because he couldn't figure out the new operating system on his, on his smartphone.

Speaker 1:          00:48:04       Completely unacceptable. So, uh, my temper is, has really reduced and um, I'm telling you if I can just not fucking do, I just made the statement out loud. It's like my daughter's not going to see me flipping out, you know, I'm not saying I want every way. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey. Hey. What? She's fucking drawn on the wall at some point, but uh, she's not going to see me yelling at computers. It's just not going to happen. Okay. And I say it out loud. When I say it out loud, that means it happens. Right?

Speaker 2:          00:48:32       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:48:32       I hope somebody with, I'm trying, fuck you guys. I'm trying. Anytime I talk about this too of my standup back, then I'm going to try to fix my temper. People just start laughing. They laugh and they point and they make me feel bad. Um, all right. Italy and the European Union pay their Capitol Hill Bill. I'm just a bill. Yes. I'm only a bill and I'm sitting here on Capital Hill and okay. I'm a political science professor from a school I won't name to keep with your policy of not naming names. Uh, having studied and taught the subject, it's fair to say I look at what goes on today from a much wider scope. A wider scope than who? Me. I would hope so. I would hope so wider than me. Um, all right. And that's not something that is only exclusive to receiving a master's in political science. Could you pat yourself on the back anymore, sir? Did you elbow patch fly off you fucking left arm of your sport coat when you reach back to that is all, I love this guy and that's not always something that is only exclusive to receiving a master's in political science. Sky should be wearing a scarf with a nice breeze going. Anyone can read

Speaker 1:          00:49:50       Solzhenitsyn. Thank you for fucking sound spelling that for me and others who have honestly captured an important perspective of history and have a much clearer understanding of how and why governments and social lights have evolved through history. Anyways, there was one thing that has flown under the radar now that I've gotten my resume out of the way, there's one thing has flown under the radar and I think it should scare the shit out of most European countries. All right. Let me start by saying in short that the European Union parentheses, which in my opinion is run by fascist self interest. Can I just stop here and say this is the most well-written fucking email I've ever received on the podcast.

Speaker 1:          00:50:36       This is incredible. Um, let me start by saying it's short to the European Union, which my opinion is run by fascist with interest, tried to take control of Italy's army for the sake of your time. I will spoil the ending. Italy did not vote to allow the EU to take over that move by the EU. Alarmed. Some of my peers who I in 20 plus years of knowing them have not seen them alarmed by anything in terms of government in the scheme of things, a banking institution, openly financing legislation that is trying to gain control of a foreign countries, foreign governments. Military is for the lack of a better term, really, really ballsy. Why do I feel like I missed some information here? Okay, so the the European Union tried to take over Italy's army. Okay. I see that Italy did not vote to allow the EU to take over. So when you joined the uh,

Speaker 2:          00:51:38       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:51:38       European Union, they took take over your army, is that what you're saying? Okay, so that move by the EU alarm. Some of my peers. What move. Oh, trying to take over the, okay, but you're jumping back and forth here. I can't tell what you're talking about. K to take control of Italy's army case. So I'm trying to take control of their army. Yeah. How would you do that?

Speaker 1:          00:52:02       Okay. The idea that, let me just finish this. The idea that certain globalist groups are trying to take control of the world is not an incredible idea among people who are versed in political economics or conspiracy theorists like myself, but you know something me, they just go, oh, where do you get your fucking 10 hat on? And a you, if you just started saying what the fuck you just said, you'd probably run into the same problem like you just, I just said it was the best written email ever and I got lost in it because I'm too fucking stupid. I understand what you're talking about, so it's gotta be hard, man. You just got to hang out with people with the fucking elbow patches on their sport coats, right?

Speaker 2:          00:52:41       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:52:41       Anyways, the idea that certain globalist groups are trying to take control of the world is not an incredible idea among people who are versed in political economics. I've heard you talk about stuff like this in the context of a conspiracy and so other than this possibly possibly being interesting to you, it's also too, it's also affirm that you are not out of your mind. I attached an article if you'd like to read further, I absolutely would look at this. How about dad? Everybody all, you can't say that I got a 10 add on tin foil hat on. Whatever the fuck that means. Half of you say that you don't even know what it means. You didn't get your tinfoil hat on. You know, I don't know what the fuck it means. Is that, is that like my antenna? If I'm doing some sort of pirate radio, tin foil hat meaning I know what it means. It means you're out of your fucking mind. But how did it come about? A tin foil hat is made from one or more sheets of aluminum foil. I didn't want the exact or a piece of conventional head gear lined with foil worn in the belief or hope that it shields the brain from threats such as electromagnetic fields, mine control in mind. Oh, I see. I see. Well, you know, that's some macgyver shit.

Speaker 2:          00:53:52       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:53:53       I can go with that. Right. Is that a bad thing? Anyway, so what were the fuck was it?

Speaker 5:          00:54:00       MMM,

Speaker 1:          00:54:01       I've attached. I, I wouldn't, I would actually, it's a to, how long is this? So, so something I can read, you know, I'll read about this and I'll give you my uninformed opinion, my Moronica opinion on the next podcast. How about that? Does that work for you? Does that grab you? Um, all right. Fat guys turns out to not be fat. Billy twinkle bows. This guy told, I was told by a doctor his whole life that he was fat. He had this huge frontal thing on going on that turned out to not be a giant belly, but 130 pound tumor. How many people do you know? We'll start using the tumor defense.

Speaker 5:          00:54:40       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:54:42       I actually looked this fucking thing up. The guy is fat. He's very fat. Even after the fucking tumor. I mean like he's laying in bed. Any has, it's like he has an inner tube of fat going around. I think like that's what his neck is.

Speaker 2:          00:54:59       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:54:59       This guy is so fucking fat. He had 130 pound to Marnie. Just thought it was part of his love handle. He is fat. Um, I'm glad they got it out of there. Jeez. How do you, how do you get that out of their hundred and 30 pounds? How the fuck Dee? I mean, you've got to take it out in sections 10 pounds at a time. You need to make 13 fucking incisions, Jesus Christ, and just thrown it over your shoulder, hitting the ground like a fucking bowling Jesus Christ. Do you know I knew a guy

Speaker 5:          00:55:37       dead. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:55:39       you know, everybody's talking about probiotics and they talk about the bacteria in your gut that know there's bacteria in your gut that's supposed to be there. They try to scare the shit out of you, but it's supposed to be there. It's there for when you die in, it begins to decomposing process provided you're not full of fucking preservatives and you just decompose because you not important and you just become part of the earth again. But we stick ups ourselves in these fancy fucking boxes because we think we're too good to be warm food for whatever fucking reason. But anyways, um, alcohol

Speaker 1:          00:56:15       eats away at the good shit, the good bacteria that you need while you're alive. Like you supposed to be balanced and you're supposed to have more of the good bacteria. Cause if you have more of the bad bacteria, you can actually enter your own fucking way. You're beginning to decompose while you still alive or in a short way you starting to die. This is the way this guy explained it to me. So he started getting a distended belly. They didn't know what the fuck was going on and he wouldn't go to the doctor. And then finally you found out, you know, somebody said maybe you got to tape worn and that freaked him the fuck out. They could have been something alive in them. And he went to the doctor and then they found out that that's what it was. And uh, they gave him some medicine and you know, Eddie Ed to shit it all out.

Speaker 1:          00:56:53       That's basically what happened. So, um, I dunno, even then, I always buy the Greek yogurt and it goes bad. I, we think like eight, I'll slam a couple of scotches and the next morning I have two spoonfuls of fucking Greek yogurt. You're going to, I'll be fine. I was happy in the life insurance. They sit down in a nice fucking easy, you know, heart rhythm. That was also meditating when they did it. You know, I was being totally present. I was listening to the sounds of the room. I slowed my breathing. I trick those fuckers. But I also had the Bruins game on in the background so I was trying not to react to what the fuck was going on cause we left this fucking country goal at the end of the second period with one second left. All right. Crazy Saddam story. Crazy. All right. Hey Bill thought I brighten your day with this crazy account of what went down in Iraq when Saddam took power, basically the gathered all government officials in one room, the current military leader gets brought out on stage. He clearly, he's clearly been beaten, he admits to having committed treason, but clearly he hasn't. They then start calling out officials one at a time, so everyone was scared shitless that they'd be called out and marched out into a courtyard with the others. Then after half of them were gone, the remaining officials were all taken out to the courtyard and told that if they didn't shoot the traders,

Speaker 3:          00:58:14       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:58:14       They and their families would be killed. That way they all had blood on their hands. Insane. Here's the whole account and to thank the u s still did business with sit down with them after that. Ha Ha Dude. As far as I know, we kind of put that guy in over there,

Speaker 3:          00:58:33       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:58:36       it, and we were cool with the guy until he fucking tried to go around us and start selling oil to other, I don't know what the fuck he did. We, you know,

Speaker 3:          00:58:46       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:58:46       You know what I mean? Saddam Hussein to the United States. He was like one of those fucking, a first round draft choices that, that's a bus. He was a bust for us, you know, in a very promising college career. And uh, you know, he just, he just didn't have the passion and actually he was a very passionate guy. He just wasn't passionate in the wrong, I don't know who the fuck knows. I mean it's all evil shit. That shit is just like,

Speaker 3:          00:59:12       mmm.

Speaker 1:          00:59:14       The most base level evil cause then I even trying to hide it, but I got to tell you when Trump was talking to that fucking guy there, I'm from Fox News, Bill O'reilly and Bill O'reilly's give him shit that he was friends with Putnam putting in or whatever his fucking name was. And he goes, the guys that he's a killer to have a fucking standing president go, well look at this country. Look [inaudible] we've done my jaw hit the fucking ground, Mike. Is he actually going to say this? You can't say this. Everybody knows it's true. But you can't fucking say this now. We only kill the bad evil the fuck out of here. It's all fucking evil. And that goes back to that fake news. That's why they need to take control of the fake news so they can spin it. You know what I mean? The Guy, he came out of fucking nowhere.

Speaker 1:          00:59:59       This Saddam Hussein, where we had a green light, he came out of fucking nowhere. Everybody does it. Everybody does it. You know what? And I fucking do it too. We're all spinning it. We're all spinning our own horse shit. We all think we're fine. I'm not going to speak for you guys, but I'm spinning my own bullshit, right? This is my favorite video anybody's sent me in a long fucking time. I'm, oh, by the way, if you want to watch that sit down thing, uh, I'll, I'll post all these videos. I don't know if I want to watch it. That stuff. I Dunno. I don't like watching shit like that.

Speaker 1:          01:00:32       All right. 109 year old guy smoked cigars and drinks whiskey. Dear Billy deer farm state bill, I know you have a life insurance policy tests, but I thought you might want to see this is 109 year old guy. Smoked cigars all day. Not Saying it's great for everyone, but figured you'd want to hear the title actually marginalized this guy's life. He's got a great attitude. He still drives. He's the oldest living World War II veteran. You'd really enjoy this. He talks about having a truck for a long time and they show his old school TV with the giant dials. He keeps it all cause it works and he likes it. Come to Boston. I fucking love this guy. He said at one point he smokes 12 cigars a day. He goes, I don't inhale. So inhale, he goes, you get in trouble. The bottom line is, you know, whatever's genetics are, this works for him because I know if I smoked 12 a day, I have, first of all, I couldn't physically fucking do it, but he, and it's like a 79 looks like a 78 or 79 Ford pickup truck. He had an old square TV that's still had the legs on it from like the 70s.

Speaker 5:          01:01:47       and um,

Speaker 1:          01:01:50       I've got to tell you, watching this guy watching his life is the life that I'm slowly moving towards. It's the life that I want.

Speaker 5:          01:01:59       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:02:01       After running around like a fucking lunatic, reacting to everything for the first fucking, you know, 40 something years of my life.

Speaker 5:          01:02:12       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:02:15       You know, I would like to slow down a little bit is far as being an, I mean, look, I'm still, I know all you guys are worried. I got God, he's going to slow down. He's not going to be fucking fun. I'm still going to completely fuck up. Still going to do dumb shit. I'm going to be fine, but I don't have to be walking or I basically walked around, stuck in fight or flight mode probably from the age of eight till now. And um, I dunno, it's a stupid west starts. It's funny to observe, but it really wears on the people around you and eventually it fucking wears you down. And it's just like the amount of fucking time that I have wasted arguing with people where they're not going to change their mind. I'm not going to change my mind. I've just, I, I've, uh, I've done a pass that point my fucking life and it feels fucking great. I just have to believe that I am.

Speaker 1:          01:03:47       I don't know. I tried to in the moment, I just tried to fucking like, this is funny thing that happens. Like when my daughter, uh, you don't need your diaper changed. It's like, you know, you hear him farting and everything. So you thinking like, okay, that's definitely a, you know, when you eat without getting into the gross details, just think you hear the Farc and you think that's the gun sounding the end of the game. And then when she get into it, you realize that wasn't a gun sounding the end of the game or even the end of the half. That was the sound of the fucking jets flying over the game, over the stadium right after the fucking national anthem and the game's about ready to begin.

Speaker 3:          01:04:26       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:04:28       I left pad save yesterday blocker cheese block, saved my wall, took it all on my shirt and all that. It's just like,

Speaker 3:          01:04:39       okay,

Speaker 1:          01:04:39       it's fucking unbelievable. And whenever that happens, like a couple of times I went like, Nia, she, why'd you tell me to come in? She's still going like she could tell.

Speaker 3:          01:04:49       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:04:49       Like does any way for my wife to know whether my daughter is done going to the bathroom or not. She's got no fucking idea. And I apologized, Eh, uh, I just addressed that I was angry and I, and I did it two more to fucking times and now, now I got it down. Now we just say something as I walk up to the changing table at three or four in the morning. And I just basically say, if she's not done, and you know, this is not anybody's fault, this is just part of having a kid don't flip out. And I, and I'll see how that works for me tonight. That's just base. I just, uh, before I just kept it all in my head

Speaker 1:          01:05:28       and then it becomes like, it isn't that it's sorta resort real, but isn't, I just find when I say it out loud, then I could fucking address it. And uh, so we'll see that. But, uh, I gotta tell you actually fucking really enjoy changing diapers and everything. We gave my daughter her first bath ever, right in the kitchen sink, old school style. I'm sure we've supposed to have like a fucking hazmat suit team come in and disinfect the sank and she's supposed to wear a helmet and some scuba gear. But uh, that's not how we're bringing her up. We go and we're going old school, I've been playing music for and everything, got this exercise ball and really just kind of puts her to sleep and I just play music and she just totally chills out. Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:06:22       What else has she been listed? Some of the pop stuff she really likes, I think they just like music in general. They just kind of like what the, what is that and a, I dunno, it's getting to that point. She's just starting to be able to look around and eat, kind of sit there going like, I think she's actually looking at me right now and then raise you make a guy contact. Like, Hey, are you fucking looking at me? Or I was just kind of drift away and look at something else. I'm like, all right, I guess I'm still like an acid trip when she looks at me.

Speaker 5:          01:06:49       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:06:51       But anyways, we're having a great time and, uh, even though I'm not getting any sleep, um, it's totally fucking worth it. And, uh, it's, it's, I'll tell you if you're, if you're an older dad, it's not as fucking hard. They tried to say, oh my God, you're old and going to try to do this. It's like, yeah, I'm old and I have a house. You know, I'm not some fucking struggling 20 something. You know what I mean? Fucking broke kid trying to pay off student loans and then you have a kid, people in their twenties, if they complain about having a kid, I, yeah, without a doubt. I'll listen to that.
