Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on? Is Bill burn his time for the Thursday afternoon? Just before Friday. Monday morning podcast and Ah,

Speaker 2:          00:00:08       ah,

Speaker 1:          00:00:11       I'm just checking in on you. I'm just checking in on you. Sorry, I'm just checking in on you to see now your week's going. Well, a half hour checking in. How are you doing? How are you doing? Okay. Fed fucking tastic. You know, it's funny, I'm always a day late and a dollar short to shit, so I fucking got a youtube page now. Um, we're doing all this animation, a fucking hiring people to do stuff. Try to get this fucking thing going to someday. I won't even have to leave my house. All I gotta do is just sit here and ramble on about crazy shit as I slip into fucking senility and I'll still be able to eat my apple sauce. I'll still be able to pay for some fucking apple sauce. All right? That is what that is what the old age is all about. Okay. You don't leave your house, but checks is still coming in.

Speaker 1:          00:00:59       Okay? You got a cupboard full of fucking apple sauce. Once you open them, you put them in the fridge, you know, even though it hurts your teeth. Oh right. Cause you got to look at fucking nerve involvement and all your fucking, all your teeth. Right? You go back to eating the same shit. You Steve as a baby. It's just, it's like apple sauce is Gerber food for fucking old people. Right? So you got that. What else do you have? You mixed a little Manet's in there. Anything you don't have to fucking shoe. Um, so I'm getting a youtube page going and then you know what these fucking constant youtube do. Now, if I can't even tell you, they got this thing where they decide if what the fuck happened on your thing is, is a little too offensive. Like they fucking decide and then you don't get any of the ad money.

Speaker 1:          00:01:39       And I'm like, but the ads still there. Who gets the money? Youtube keeps it fucking unbelievable. I'll tell you right fucking now the number one commandment broken it. I'm telling you, it's stealing. There's more stealing that goes on, on the legal side of business for everybody's always make. I'm fucking Scorsese. He's always doing it. You know, if I fuck him forever or whatever that fucking song is, so I could go from rags to riches. That's what the hell it is. Right? All that good fellas. Shit, fuck you pay me. Fuck you pay me all of that. Like that doesn't exist in the legal world. It's, it's even fucking worst and it's more overt. That is just straight up fucking stealing. So I don't know what I'm going to do with the youtube page. I'm actually thinking of what am I, why don't we just move it to my fucking website, right. I'll reach out to fucking Miller Miller high life. You want to fucking, uh, if you want to fucking just be on all my videos and I'll just do it on my page and I could do say whatever the fuck I want and not worry about somebody taking my fucking retirement. Apple sauce money.

Speaker 1:          00:02:43       It's not like I'm making any fucking money anyways. You've got to have like a billion hits, I think to make $7. Well, you know, you got to cure rate. You'd be as they're talking to you here, like a cash machine going off in the fucking background, whatever. Who gives a shit? All right. You know what? I am actually in a great mood here I am in a great mood. And um, despite that highway robbery, youtube, she call it your tube to your fucking bullshit. You're keeping all the fucking money, your cons, um, who gives a shit right at the end of the fucking day? Well, obviously you do bill, he wouldn't have brought it up. I don't fucking mind. Just, just fuck me over. Why can't you just fuck me over? Why can't you just come out and just say, listen, we're going to fuck you over. Why do you gotta to lie? Why do you to sit there and act like you're not going to do it and then you turn around and you do it. That's what upsets me. It's not that you're doing it, is it? You said you weren't going to do it.

Speaker 1:          00:03:38       All right. Anyways, uh, bread. Marshawn suspended for two games for stab and Jake Dodgson in the balls. So he got one game for each bulb, each ball that he fucking stabbed them. And, and uh, it makes sense. I know a lot of people like, well why didn't Sidney Crosby? Cause what Sydney did don't you see is he turned his fucking stick sideways and he gave him a little tap, little tap of the ball bag, like the same level, that one, you know, the doctor you go to get a physical, he as you cross your legs and you know, he hit you and you need goes up. Right. Just like that. He was just testing the guy's reflexes. So he gets no suspension or a penalty, you know, plus he has those big pouty lips and everybody feels bad for him. That's the genius. Sidney Crosby, Sidney Crosby has a look on his face, you know, like right before you make your girlfriend cry and then you're like, oh my God, she's going to cry.

Speaker 1:          00:04:27       So you just abandon your argument. Like that's what his face looks like. So I think that's why he's able to, that's why he's able to get away with what he gets away with. Plus, you know, he's a superstar and he makes everybody a ton of money. So Brad Marshawn, you know, you live by the sword, you die by the sword. I remember branded press, fucking stabbed him in the nuts, uh, when we will play in Vancouver a couple of years ago. And then what's funny is to listen to Jack Edwards when he sees Marshawn, he's such a fucking homer. He's just sitting. They go, oh, look at all that is Blake Lee out of the rules. That is a delicious video for the boys in New York. Hope you enjoy your day off. You're talking about definitely a suspension and uh, and then march tion way, you know, fucking just, I mean, he uppercutted this dude's nuts. His stick was not on the flat side. Like he was giving it a backhander, you know, he did an upper cut with the stick to the guys Taynton Ball area. And, um, like, you know, when your wife tells you to shovel the driveway and you're already pissed at you, you know how hard you throw those first two fucking scoops of snow over your shoulder. That's how hard he hit this guy in the fucking nuts.

Speaker 1:          00:05:36       And I got to tell you, as a Bruins fan, I thought I was like, oh my God, he just fucked us over cause he just got kicked out of the game. I think it was still zero to zero against the Tampa Bay lightning. And we were waiting to, um, you know, see if we were gonna make the playoffs. I'm like, oh my God, he just got to give right at the end of the first period. I'm like, he's going to get kicked out. That's gonna fucking, you know, give Tampa of little jumping, nailed their, their game. They're going to win this fucking game. He's going to be out for the rest of the season. And, um, and then we're going to, you know, I catastrophize in my head, what if we fucking, you know, don't make the playoffs because of that play off. But fortunately we ended up winning I think four to one or four to nothing.

Speaker 1:          00:06:16       And, um, if we beat Ottawa tonight, we can actually, uh, you know, we at the very least are going to be a wildcard. But I mean I don't, obviously I don't feel like playing fucking the capital's right now. They are looking like world beaters. But um, eventually you will have to play in, but it'd be nice to maybe have a chance to win a playoff series. We'll see how we do though. You never know. Golf tenders can get, they get hot at the right time of year. There's no telling how far you could go in the Stanley Cup playoffs. Um, I feel like for me, I just feel that um, that's actually become part of my vocabulary now. Cause every time Nia watches those fucking reality shows, people who just go for me or Tiki, I just feel, and now I've done it so much, now I'm doing it.

Speaker 1:          00:07:04       So I am officially bill Kardashians right now. All right. I'm not thinking about transitioning. I'm not going to die. What's left of my fucking, I got him. I got my head shape now, but my beard, I'm not going to dry diet. Fucking jet black, you know, but like the Kardashians, I did marry an African American, so I feel like I'm halfway there. I think I could actually say that I'm one of their cousins. I don't know. Oh, I see a Photoshop coming anyways to get back to uh, to the hockey. Um, uh, so yeah, so we're in the playoffs for the first time in a three fucking years. So it's great to be in there and hopefully we'll be thought of what tonight. And uh, I bet my Sean cost himself a little bit of fucking money there. You know, I would think in his contract that he gets a bonus if he gets 40 goals and the man was sitting on 39, we're going to play Ottawa tonight.

Speaker 1:          00:07:54       Forget about the rest of the game that he could have played in Tampa playing auto tonight. And according to the puck off podcast hosted by Joe Part Nick on the all things comedy network, he said that a auto has got a lot of injuries in their defense. Who knows? Who knows? So I guess what you take away from all of that is that if you're in the NHL, if you're going to fucking hit somebody ball bag, you do it with the flat side of the stick. All right? You get yourself, you know, some college and injections. India lips like a Kardashians. I don't know. Maybe they did it then. I Dunno. Um, you know, so you look like you're about ready to cry like Cindy Crosby and you will not get suspended. All right? But I guess she heard Crosby other night fucking slash somebody and almost took the end of his fucking like the guys into the guy's finger was hanging off.

Speaker 1:          00:08:40       You know, I'm going to go out on a limb and say that guy, he's going to have a, uh, there's not really like any of the goons anymore. These to have like that. That's like players like Crosby. Students just have like security, like back in the day in like the 80s, like the, the, the fucking tough guys back in the 80s where like they did everything but just have like blue blazers on an earpiece is standing next to the goal scores. If you went anywhere near them, they fucking murder you. And I'm, I'm trying to think of who, who the penguins have penguins never really had a goon. They had a bunch of fucking knee breakers. They were really into like, well, we're not going to fight you. We're just going to end your career. Blow out your fucking knee board. You and that type of ship filthy, filthy fucking franchise.

Speaker 1:          00:09:23       But you know, the penguin isn't dirty bird, isn't it? Sort of the pigeon of the Antarctic, isn't it? Did you guys hear their buildings on luxury condos down there? Luxury condos in Antarctica, you know, the people in Silicone Valley, they don't know where else to spend their money. They already bought up San Francisco. That's starting to come down here to la and a for a summer place because San Francisco is so fucking cold. Um, that the next thing that they're going to do, it can be down in Antarctica. You can look it up. It's true luxury condos in Antarctica and a la to Antarctica. They're going to have the first direct flight in July. All of that is true. I'm not making this up at all because I have a half hour to a to fill up here and I'm only 10 minutes in. I would never do that to you guys. Um, all right, let's talk about, oh, Billy beefcake care. All right. Fucking Dad Bod Magoo who, uh, after his European run last summer, whereas up to a fucking 190 pounds. And then I kind of started working out, getting ready for my special. I got down to like a buck 78 finished the special. And are they really specials anymore now that there's one coming out every week? It was just sort of bill talks for an hour.

Speaker 1:          00:10:36       I think the sense my special came out in January. There's been 97 other hour long specials. I think there's been out one out every day. Um, anyways, so I, uh, I got down to a buck 78, 79 ish and, uh, and then I was just like, all right, now I'm waiting to become a dad. You know, my wife was in the third trimester, so I'm going to try meth, so I'm going to fucking blame her a little bit, even though I don't always just drink it too much of everything. So I got up to like a backup to like a buck 85 buck 86. So now last week I got myself down to 180 pounds. This week I wanted to lose at least two pounds. All right. The way in is tomorrow, but uh, I'll just start doing them on Thursday. So I wanted to get down to one 78, maybe one 77. Got on the scale today. One 77.6.

Speaker 1:          00:11:24       All right. So I am, um, I got one day on a film coming up. Oh, aren't you fancy, Bill? Yes, I am. I got one day at a film. So ultimately, you know, I need to be, to not get too much shit on Twitter about being a big booze headed fucking bald headed red cunt. You know, which always fucking happens. All these fucking actress fucking bitch Moan and complaining like the Internet is only mean to them. I swear to God, fucking self involves of lunatics, right? Um, I got to get down to like my fight and win choosy about a buck 72 on camera. If I walk around a buck 75, you know, um, if you just see me coming down the street, I mean I look radiant. Okay. You're going to look at me like Jesus. Bill, are you expecting book at that? Look on your face.

Speaker 1:          00:12:11       I'm fucking with you. But I got to get on camera. I got to be down to a buck 72. All right. And every fucking actor knows what fucking wait you gotta be at. So you know, and you'll all get, oh, you just gauge it on social media feedback cause you're just going to get a ton of shit. The second you go a little power dude, you look like Vince Vaughn in the end of the fucking, uh, the breakup. You know, that was my favorite part of that fucking move. I love that fucking movie. I loved how Vince did the fucking, he had the, uh, not in a relationship fucking, you know, out there crushing ass. And then when he was in the relationship, he had that extra 10 to 15, you know, the Netflix, wait, let's sit here and you know, make some Mac and cheese and play footsie.

Speaker 1:          00:12:51       Um, I don't want to ruin the end of the movie, but, uh, that, that's one of the best, you know, and that was a chick flick to cause it was about a relationship. And that's one of my favorite things about it was it played out in a real way right down to the, you know, when he's not in a relationship, he's fucking, you know, he said his fighting weight, you know, I'm trying to attract somebody to fuck me again. Okay. You were a layup, so I had my layup extra 15 on, right. That's what I'm trying to lose right now. Oh Billy, lay up. Wait, so I'm down to one 77.6 so next week. The official way in is on Friday, but I'll do them on Thursday just to give a, just add a little excitement in your life because I'm so self involved and I feel like you guys actually give a shit.

Speaker 1:          00:13:32       So do a with me lose two pounds this week at least if not three. So I want to be down to about a buck 74, uh, by Friday next week and then we shoot the following week so I can actually be down to one 73. You know, if I puked behind a dumpster, you know, take the old fucking, you know, you know what route? I guess she can't even see. You can't even say bulemia without people freaking out unless you're like, it's one of the worst of the others. You can't even use it as a comedy reference. Are you allowed to, are you allowed to say, you know, use that as a reference. Like, I'll go, I'll go if I have to, if I have to, I will make myself fucking Yak for fucking a day to get down to the buck. 72 to till liver, my line and a half on this movie, Bill Burr, King of the line and a half.

Speaker 1:          00:14:20       If you've got a line and a half that you need to fucking be delivered by a tertiary character. Did I use that word correctly? I am your fucking man. I will show up on time in shape, ready to fucking work. I'll show up at my fighting weight of one 72 I will deliver that line. I'll even give you a look. All right to give me like a, a special and special appearance by Bill Burr, the opening credits, whatever the fuck that's called, I will actually throw in. I'll give you, I'll give you the rock, you know, with one of my invisible eyebrows that you can't really see. Um, yeah. So I'm going to get down to that. I'm going to get down to hopefully like a book, whatever,

Speaker 1:          00:14:56       72 whatever. Look at me. Sound like the fucking rain man. But that's the only way to do it. And then eventually I'd like to get down to one, a buck 68. Okay. And then not do what I always do to be like, oh, I'm a buck 68, you know, who wants some fucking cookies? Let's get a fucking 12 pack, you know? And then I slowly but surely go right back up and, uh, I, I have to make a lifestyle change. I just feel like for me, I'm going to be a lot happier if I cut out gluten and I still don't know what gluten is.

Speaker 1:          00:15:31       It's some sort of chemical that's in wheat, I believe in. Evidently it's not good for you, even though wheat is, is from the earth, but you know, there are poisonous plants or is gluten like some shit that's some fucking nerds made for psychopaths that have food companies that adds to the density or some shit and somehow they make more money? Is that what it is? They're always looking to do that shit. You know what I mean? You can't fucking satisfying these fucking lunatic, these fucking guys, the men at the top of these corporations. You know what they're like, they're like a bunch of fucking Brunch, you know what I mean? Like don't matter what they have then Emma fucking happy. You know you got straight hair now you want curly hair and now you want short hair. You know they ain't want to wear a crop top that you want to fucking, you know, have clam digger zone. I don't, I don't know what the fuck are they should do it. Could you just put on a fucking pair of sweatpants and just sit down for five fucking minutes? Do you know how hard my wife would be laughing at this shit right now? Cause I'm the one who I fucking

Speaker 1:          00:16:27       but don't look like this is supposed to be my relaxed energy right now and I'm still talking too fast. Whenever I listened back to my podcast and like, why? Why do I talk so fast? I thought it would, I thought I talked a lot slower. I need to have like cocktail party energy now. Even a cocktail party. You got to yell, you gotta Yell over people. Right?

Speaker 2:          00:16:49       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:16:50       I Dunno. Cocktail party, just call it what it is. We're getting away from our kids to get shit faced for a few hours. All right? And somebody's going to try to dominate the conversation. Somebody is going to fucking bring up politics. Someone's gonna get too drunk. Then there's going to be a fucking argument. Then this got to be apologies afterwards. Why doesn't everybody just pick a fucking corner of the room? Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:17:11       Okay. Stare at the carpet and just, just start drinking. Okay. That's it. Why else are we here? Is it some swingers party? We going to trade off here? Like what? What is going on? I don't, Maggie. I don't give a shit about your worldview. You don't hold public office. You do not have access to top secret documents in the Pentagon. So at the end of the day, what am I doing here on? I really listening to like a nurse trying to tell me how to fix a car. Isn't that kind of the same thing? Would you like to hear what I think about fucking the Middle East course? You wouldn't lot, right then finish your fucking drink.

Speaker 1:          00:17:49       Um, anyways. Uh, what else is going on this weekend? Oh, I'm going to be in, I'm going to be in San Antonio,

Speaker 4:          00:17:57       but not one show too.

Speaker 1:          00:18:01       Two shows at the majestic theater. Oh my God, it's so majestic. They added a second show. I want to be doing some morning radio tomorrow to hype. That second show. I'm doing that one show. I'm doing two shows like Brad Marshawn. Oh, I'm not going to fucking stab you in one ball. I'm stabbing it to not going to get suspended for one game. You're suspended for it. I'm going to do one show for every game. Brad Marshawn was suspended. Okay. Was unfairly targeted cause he in in a, in a moment of emotion, he used the shoveling, the snow fucking technique and he did not have the Sidney Crosby pouty lips for when he went to the board in New York. I think that's what's Crosby does. You know, he just, he doesn't even have to go to New York. They just fucking put him on Skype and he just sits there like, hi guys. I'm Shari. You know, it's just having a bad period. Oh, isn't it amazing how much I could talk without even knowing what the fuck I ain't know what I'm talking about here. Um, Hey, do you guys want to know how to change a shitty diaper properly? Are there any parents out there? Here's one to grow on. Here's one of my, here's a tip for you. All right. What happens is, is when you have a little base, yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:19:24       Say the word saint a Goddamn fucking hard. You're going to be okay. Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:19:29       if you have a baby, um, and you're breastfeeding it as opposed to giving it formula, I'm staying away from that shit. I just, I don't like that fucking name formula at that fucking name alone. I'm not giving my baby formula. You know, I was just picture like when those Frankenstein movies with the graduated cylinder cylinder and the dry out dry ice smoke coming out of the top of it. So anyway, so they bay, yeah, they got a liquid diet going on. So when you know, when the fucking backdoor comes off the hinges, as they say, uh, you know, this is the deal. The second you hear the fucking, you know, the rumblings and the grumblings, what you gotta do is you got to get your kid not horizontal if you got to have them upright, all right? Now this is the problem. When you take them down to the changing table, when you lay him back down again, okay?

Speaker 1:          00:20:23       And you're taken off the one Z, you got to elevate them a little bit. You know, as they say, shit runs downhill, okay? So what you want to do is you want to use gravity as a favor. This, it's a two person job. If you're going to save that fucking onesy, all right? Which you got to do is you have to have the baby fucking standing up on the changing table, all right? The other person on does the onesy lifts the ones z up over the fucking diaper, and then you take the diaper off, like you taking the transmission out of a car that's up on a lift, all right? Then he use gravity. Everything drops down. I'm trying to be as not graphic as humanly possible, okay? Then, you know, then you begin the fucking, uh, the restoration because I'm telling you right now, if you're home alone, all right, and you lay that kid down den, what? Shit runs downhill now? What's on the ones? You got to take it off. You've got to go over the kids fucking head and now you got shit on the fucking, I'm sorry. And this is what it is. I don't want to put shit on the kid's head.

Speaker 2:          00:21:33       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:21:33       I tell you, it's a rough one. You know, so fortunately that fucking happens is somebody else around. Uh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to get that graphic, but you know, people who are parents are telling you, just one person holds it up. The undo the ones that you dropped the diaper out, like a fucking trans mission, you know, do a little cleanup. Then you fucking set the kid down. Then you finish the fucking clean up. Bam. A new diaper. Actually, you don't even do that. You usually, we just bring her into the fucking shower and start all over again with a brand new squeaky clean fucking kid. And there you go. There's a little parenthesis, my first per unsolicited parental advice. Okay. I just felt like for me, I just felt like it needed to be sad. Is anybody watching that reality show? Black ink? Uh, my wife watches it all the time. There is a woman on there that makes my temper look like a fucking summer breeze. Good Lord. Does she lose her fucking shit? It's like she's possessed. Um, I actually just literally have to walk out the door, but I know I keep forgetting this show. I started the watch. I watched the first three episodes and I absolutely fucking loved it and I tweeted about it. It was a cartoon from Japan, I guess they're called anime, which I did know that, but I didn't realize it was such a divisive thing to say that you liked to show that was anime. I feel like it is animate like the emo of fucking cartoons.

Speaker 1:          00:23:01       Like I tweeted that, I liked this show called one punch man.

Speaker 2:          00:23:05       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:06       All right. And the fucking responses that I got, I got, dude, are you fucking drunk? Oh my God. You're in the animate. And then other people just like this. I just like to show I've watched enough for the same type of shit and I was scrolling through and I was like, what the fuck is this show? And I looked and it had five stars, four and a half, five stars, which is why I really hope Netflix doesn't go to thumbs up, thumbs down, like I said, because it's so fucking

Speaker 2:          00:23:36       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:37       You know, stubbing your toe, thumbs down, Adolf Hitler, thumbs down. I mean the thumbs down is this, there's a big gap between Hitler and you, you know, sub when you're fucking tope. Um, anyway, so I put this thing on and what I loved about the show,

Speaker 4:          00:23:53       mmm.

Speaker 1:          00:23:54       Aside from the fact that I really saw it, it was funny that you actually kind of got like a sense of what young people,

Speaker 4:          00:24:01       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:24:01       Feel like in Japan as far as their view of going into the corporate world was very similar to the empty feeling. Unless you're a fucking sociopath over here, I find like a very like common thread to that and to basically give the overall thing the superhero in it. He's not a soup. He doesn't want to be a superhero. All right? Any fucking trained really hard cause he wanted to be the strongest guy in the world. And in his training, he lost all his hair, which is hilarious. And he's really self conscious about it. But he ended up developing like this punch. And no matter what monster he runs into, he doesn't give a shit whether they kill him. He's just completely devoid of any like passion or emotion. Like what happens to you when you get shoved into a fucking cubicle and a, and he's got this one punch and he just fucking kid punched so hard that no matter how fucking bad ass the monster is, he gives him one, somebody said they should've called the show, the right they have Fred. He gives him the fucking fire in the fucking and, and end the face is Eddie Murphy says it the face, um, and their fucking head explodes. And the monsters that he fights, you also get more of an insight into where people's heads are at.

Speaker 4:          00:25:14       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:25:14       Uh, in Japan and it was like, you know, one of the monsters you fought with, some giant virus sent here by the Earth to get rid of the war, all the humans because of what we'd done to the planet. So there was environmental thing. Then my favorite one was this guy who was crab mad. He was half like up top and it was all a crab. And then the bottom he was, he was half a guide and he was in the bottom half. He's in his bare feet and tidy whities

Speaker 4:          00:25:39       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:25:39       And the guy's like, oh, I ate so much crab me that I became a fucking crab. And to me he represented the upper 1% corporate guys, you know, on some power lunch, just eating all the fucking Sushi and just take, take, take, take, take, nothing spiritual about them. So he gave him the old right there, Fred. And then he fought this fucking lie and she had command of all the mosquitoes and she'd sit the mosquitoes on everybody's suck all the blood out of you and all your fucking energy. And then it would make her stronger. And to me it's like all this is a gold digging, blood sucking whore. Right. And then once she got it to do it to all the animals and everybody there, she didn't need the mosquitoes anymore. She told all the mosquitoes to go fuck themselves. And I'm like slash this is also somebody who becomes successful and forgets where they come from and they look at everybody where they used to be. It's like a bunch of fucking pee on a bunch of little insignificant little mosquitoes. Right? It's a lot of levels to it. Or you can just get fucking high and watch this bald headed dude fucking punch half a crab in the head and want you to explode. I enjoyed it.

Quali um, anyways, let me get back to, sorry, I was just giving you guys a little behind the scenes on voiceovers. Did you like that? Did you feel like you were there? All right, let me wrap this up. Uh, this weekend I'm for the first time I think I'm going to watch an entire moto GP race. I believe it's in Argentina. It's somewhere down south. Oh, who? Yay. No further south than that. [inaudible] action.

Speaker 1:          00:35:22       Who the fuck I'm getting texts from right now? Oh my God, I don't remember that person a minute. All right. Anyways, Moto GP and then the Chinese Grand Prix. Um, this is, this is a very great weekend before the, the NFL and NBA playoffs start. If you would like to watch some alternative sports sports that are not as big as the big four here in the United States of American. Who, who's kidding, who are country matters the most? Therefore our sports matter the most. All right. People know our star athletes around the world. Nobody knows people in the premier league. You know, the only reason why we knew that one fled Beckam guys cause they made a movie about it and he was fucking one of the spice girls. All right? If he wasn't fucking some chicken, a girl band, nobody knew who that guy was. Okay. We mattered the most.

Speaker 1:          00:36:17       All right, let's, let's try to have a little more empathy as Americans here. Let's watch some fucking great sports from around the world. Moto GP, if you want to watch a bunch of lunatics driving about 180 miles an hour right next to each other, taking turns fucking maniacs. And he also the technology and that sport, do you know like those suits? Now? I don't know how they figure it out, but they figure out that the riders fallen off the bike and before he hits the pavement, pavement ideally like the, the, the, the suit that they wear has like an airbag that just fucking immediately inflates and protects all the vitals in theory. You know, obviously, I dunno if you fucking slam into a wall. I don't know what happens then. But, um, and then the Chinese Grand Prix, the second race, the second of 20 races, there's only 20 racists.

Speaker 1:          00:37:02       It's very easy to watch this and continue to watch all the other sports that you love. You can tape it, you can just fucking watch it. And uh, the Ferrari's one, the first one was Sebastian Vettel I believe. And uh, you know, I'm sorry. I'm sure fucking the fuck's his name. Lewis Hamilton is not happy about that shit. Um, and I was actually going to go to that tt race this year and the Isle of Man and ended up fucking falling apart. So, um, I got to go next year. I got to go next year before they make it fucking safe. I have to go. And if you've never seen that race, more people have died than years that they've had it. Um, the balls these people have, it's like fucking real life mad max type shit, except it's still running water and all that stuff. Um, anyways. All right, let me talk about my glutes.

Speaker 1:          00:37:45       Give me a, this is something I realized as I'm rehabbing all these injuries and my body is that through years of sitting on planes and sitting on cars, like I fucking, I have like no glute muscles whatsoever. Like beyond the usual fucking white guy, no ass type of shit. It's just like my fucking thighs do all the work. So I've been, I've been doing these squats where kind of push them from your heels and when I'm coming down and I'm trying to have most of my weight on my squat on my squad, so my heels with my torso like straight up and down, not leaning forward to counterbalance the lack of glute muscle that I have, I start to come down into a seating position. I have to do it like over my workout bench. Cause if I just tried to go, you know, mainly depending on my glutes, I will literally fall down like the first 30 degrees I'm okay.

Speaker 1:          00:38:34       And then I just fall down to the bench. So I got to get that going. Um, just what I've been doing, I just went on and I looked up the top 10 glued things. So I'll do an alternative leg lunges. I got an exercise ball up against the wall that I put on my back and I go all the way down to a deep squat pushing up through my heels. Then I do the one, um, well you lay on your back, your feet are planted on the ground and then you, you lift your hips up, you know, with the glutes sat way. It's almost like you're, you're, you're sort of thrusting up as if you were fucking somebody, you know what I mean? But way up, like they were lighter than air and you could actually possibly do that. So I do those and then I do the alternative fucking leg lunches.

Speaker 1:          00:39:17       That's what I'm doing so far. So, um, hopefully, I dunno, I had no idea my body was so god damn fucked up. But evidently it is. But I am one 77.6. I'm very excited about that. And, uh, do what we, everybody come on the summer's coming up, lose a couple pounds a week with me. Cut out the chips, the cookies, just fucking drink waters. Sign up for that blue apron shit. You know, have a robot come and delivered it to your house. Be done eating by five, six o'clock at night. And even if you get home later, just I always try to go like fucking at least 12 hours without eating when I'm trying to lose weight for like the last day. Like if I finish eating around seven, I'm not going to have breakfast to like fucking nine. Um, if you do have a day job, just have like, I don't know, have like a lighter breakfast or something like that.

Speaker 1:          00:39:58       I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. All I can tell you is what works for me. All right, that's the podcast. Uh, have a great weekend. Your cons, check out some of the outline. You know, what else was on this weekend? The fucking man, I'm the one golf tournament that I really try to watch every year. It starts today. So just, um, you know, if you don't want to watch the last couple of fucking games of hockey, you know, I know baseball's going in that type of stuff, but, uh, I don't know. This racing stuff's pretty fucking God. Damn cool. All right. That's it. Go fuck yourselves. We'll see on Monday.

Speaker 2:          00:41:03       Nice.

Speaker 1:          00:41:18       Marcy is completely addicted to skating now and he wants to get better at it. And, um, so we're fucking then, uh, Edmonton, the next morning we got to drive down to Calgary and Florence. He's going like this gotta be a place here to skate. So we find out they have, uh, they have a

Speaker 3:          00:41:33       skating rink at the mall and I only use it a mall. It's one of the most giant malls in North America. America, West Edmonton Mall rivaling. Uh, what's that one in Minnesota? Mall of America. All of America. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, which I've been to that one too, so we go to that one, but walking through there with a fucking skates to middle aged guys walking through this thing with fucking skates and we walk in, there's like this giant pirate ship. I mean like, yeah, you could say all the fucking ocean with this fucking thing. Yeah. It was a flicker of official and I look on the other side, it was really deep water and they took all this time to make it look like there was a ship or like Jesus Christ. I mean like you could fucking yell was monstrous man. Like Shaq could drown in this water if he didn't.

Speaker 3:          00:42:16       That's how fucking deep it was. Huge. And then we look on the other side and I'm like, Paul, I'm like, is that a fucking sea lion? They had sea lines at this thing and they're like thrown at fishing shit. Fishing. It was catching or was, it wasn't like people just walking by throwing shit from the food court. It was a trainer thrown it. And um, so we're just walking through the mall, walking through the mall. Endless fucking, well, they had a water park there. It was insane. I didn't look at any stores. I was too distracted by the shit in the middle. And then we finally get all the way to the ice palace. They called the Ice Palace and we got all excited and we're the only people were skates just walking through, holding a fucking dumb skates and we get all the way to the other side versus all excited.

Speaker 3:          00:42:56       Like, dude, I'm telling you, I'm gonna get better at this. You wait, I was getting, I was ready this summer. He's already talking shit. They were calling it right now. I'm going to be fucking skate backwards. You're going to be like, what the fuck happened? Versie right. And then we show up and uh, there's a big judo tournament where the ice rink is and they'd fucking put all this floor flooring all over. And maybe this isn't the rink. Maybe this, this dude, it says ice palace fall. This is it. They covered it up. This is it. I got upset though at the moment. I remember that girl, man, that really bothered me. We were walking through the food court and you know, we had a gyro. Great Gyro and yeah, yeah. At Great Gyro at this place called Jimmy the Greek, the one complaint. And you agreed a little too much white sauce in it was pasty. Yeah. Cause it wasn't. It wasn't, yeah, it was a little pace. He's just got one scoop. He went to one scoop lesson, a little hot sauce in it would have been hide it. You got excited? It would have been epic. Yeah, we got excited. So then I said to bill, you know, I like a little dessert after I eat. You know, I like a little candy bar. I like a little, you know, so I love sugar, new tank.

Speaker 3:          00:43:57       So I go bill Mann, it was the frozen yogurt place. I go, yeah, pink barriers. Some said go, let's go get frozen yogurt. See? All right, so we're walking by hate the pictures. So two middle aged men was skates and you keep saying I'm Middle Age, you are Middle Age, some 30 I just turned 35 35 times two is 70 most guys fucking drop when I call, I call it like I call middle late. Yeah, right. What, what would you call it? No, I guess you're right. I guess, you know, I always just, when I thought of it as a kid, I always felt, you know, it was now, I don't know, I just remember, dude, I, it's, I dunno, we'll just say 40 forties but I, you know, bored.

Tell you the way I'm eating and smoking, you know?

Speaker 3:          00:44:47       No. So, so we walked through and we're were like, where does that, where was that a frozen yogurt place? Let's go to that frozen yogurt place. So we too, we see two young women walk by and we figure, Hey, I looked at him and I'm like, these, these, these ladies, they're going to know where they're going to know where a pink barriers.

And then I looked at the other one and I go, yeah, like a pink berry.

Speaker 3:          00:45:23       And she kinda just like gives us shake off. Like how would I know? Like why are you and she fucking did. This is what she did. She did the classic pretty girl, you're clearly just asking me this because you want to talk to me thing. And I'm like, no bitch, I want some fucking yogurt. Okay, I want fucking, I want to fucking treat. You know, I just had lunch and, and it really bothered me, dude. And we were walking around and I wanted to find her. I wanted to find, walk past this again. They did the loop on the fight. I didn't know that, but I said to bill and we got to the car, I go, I wanted to find her, cause I would have just went up to and go, you know something, I found it and you're a mean jerk. And then you go, why would you do that? You're a mean jerk. That's terrible. What am I going to call her a cunt? Well, don't call her anything if you're going to go with me and jerk. I mean, you know I hate that you're a girl mentality. That pretty good. Say you're mean or you're a jerk if you want to stay clean. But if you go, you're a mean jerk. No, you're not. You're not. You're not pretty inside. You're not pretty inside. It doesn't give a fuck. She's the hot girl at the mall. Paul put yourself in her fucking pumps. All right?

Speaker 3:          00:46:20       With two fucking locker. Jackass is standing there with ice skates when there's a judo tournament down the way, asking if they know where the ice cream store is. Big looked at us the way they were suppose to I, you know what, dude? I like a sweetheart. I don't care how you, I would love to hear them tell the story and then they come and then it's just creepy. Guy Comes up like, yeah, but that's the way they're going to hear it. Paul. Paul, you ever watch those fucking prison shows? What he wants? Like the scared straight? No, not those ones where they, they talk about the worst prisons in the country and that type of ship. Oh yeah. I've seen a couple of, and you just sit there watching it going, how the fuck would I go in there and not get raped? What would my game plan? He gets scared watching it in your bedroom, right? Women have to walk out of the house worried about that. That somebody is going to, you know, do just imagine if, if, uh, did I had a winter hat on with a puffy ball on top of it, holding ice skates, asking for yogurt. If anything, she probably thought I was fucking gay.

Speaker 3:          00:47:21       You don't look gay, Paul. I know, but you're not, you're not, you're beards to terrorist that you need to get a little more metro and not to do that. We was, we had sweatpants on. Do we want a mess? Everybody in the fucking girl? Yeah. That's what you look my beard. My beard actually fucking says everybody on the fucking ground. No, but dude, I don't like the pretty girl who can't be approached with a question because Oh, this guy's hitting on me. It's, it's awful. And you know something that especially the blonde one who went like shook her head like what? She's going to be a nightmare. She's a fucking nightmare for some future guy. I'm telling you, she's a nightmare. She's already selfish. It's over. What if she just knows what she wants and we're not at, Oh this is the thing dude. You actually aloud like how old do you think they were?

Let her ruin like to do with driving down to Calgary. She ruined like got the rocky mountains on the right hand side of the car and you're just still calling. You're calling her a cunt the whole way down. It bothered the shit out of me. It was like, why are you, why would you ask me? How would I know? Dude? You realize how funny that is that they did that to us? Like what? Like yeah, they really made us feel like shit. That's fucking hilarious. If you look at it and father and the whole time is cause you wanted to get frozen yogurt dude. How funny would it be if we chased him down and I want to go frozen yogurt with sugar free gummy bears on it.

Speaker 3:          00:48:53       It was still all natural, no organic gummy. Because how great would it be if we chased him down and I just walked up to her and I go, you know something, you hurt my feelings. I just fucking broke down. You hurt my feelings. I just want a yogurt. Oh by the way, people listen in here. This is last week. You know, you know, just trying to kill, just trying to make jokes to not go out of your mind. Being on tour this fucking long is we were doing the Dangerfield. Everything. I'll tell you, I've got a friend of mine loves yogurt, you know, so we were doing that and once that went away, that got old. Somewhere along the line you started doing it. You started saying really sentimental shit to me and then pretending like you were crying and then that just became like the running joke and then you started laughing and then you were just like, you got to do that on stage, do that crime things. So now we'll just go up and like if we'll be like, hey man, I'm tired, but dude, you know what? Hang on, hang on. What you on the road has been great. You're the only one I could have done it with.

Speaker 3:          00:49:50       And then bill would come and tag it. That's the best thing. Bill would come and tag and I would just be like, oh, I was hoping you were going to say that. It's been, it's been fucking wonderful for my anger. I'm going to try to do that when I get home and telic 10 like I'm crying, man. It's fucking hilarious. So two stories. We go in to eat and we have this Filipino waiter, right? By the way, I like to play the Games where I sort of hell. Where were you? Was that Edmonton? Was that Calgary? That was Edmonton. Yeah, it was Edmonson. So I like to do this thing where sometimes I like to fuck with people, so I'll just get on a phone and I'll be like, Bill, go along with it and we'll be in an elevator and I'll go, what? No, that's horse shit.

Speaker 3:          00:50:27       Like bill, just look what happens. So like I said, like he had a parole officer called and he said, and bill goes, oh, they worked it up. And then instantly Burgos yeah, but what about that videotape? I go, Nah, Nah. They said it's insubmissible and like, am I the Guy? If there's just a stranger, they're right. Sometimes I break out laughing. So bill calls it, he gets a little emotional guy. So we, we turned this crying thing, we do it like this has been great, right? We turn, we turn that into doing it in public. So we have this Filipino waiter, right? And the old guy guy was great. He was talking to us and at the end I just go, he goes, here's your bill. And I go, I just want to say so. And I kept the dead straight face. And again, you've been a great way to her man.

Speaker 3:          00:51:05       And I put my hand on his fucking arm and I, you know, you bring him a waters and bill just looks at and goes, he gets a little, he gets a little emotional, you know what I mean? I know, but it's big. It means a lot. I didn't know what the guy had. No, cause he was so fucking polite and he was actually from the Philippines. So he's jumped right in. Perfectly good friend. He gets a little emotional like no, but bill, he'd bring the waters. I'll do, well, he was freaked out though. Oh that's the new game on the road. You have the best one. I've got to say, the best one was at the airport yesterday. We got to the airport yesterday and bill starts busting my balls about my laundry and he goes, Versie fucking 16 days and you're carrying, you know, dirty socks and underwear.

Speaker 3:          00:51:43       And I go, dude, I go, I bought new ones. You know, the dirty ones are tied up tight in a, in a plastic bag and bill just goes, just took your emotions. And Dude, I fucking could not walk. I couldn't walk and I had to stop pulling my fucking bag. I'd checked cause we were laughing so hard. And it works though. It makes it, it makes, it's fucking great. It's driving a tour manager nuts. Oh yeah. That's the one thing. Well because women don't want to see a guy getting emotional like that. It's just, well no, cause once somebody cries it's over. Yeah. Like when I go out afterwards and I'm taking pictures with people and stuff, I always come back. I was just saying, I got to tell you, you know, I've seen a lot of people do that, you know, doing the picture thing, but you gotta be one of the best wives.

Speaker 3:          00:52:27       She's going, would you stop doing that? Our wives are going to go nuts cause you know the first thing I want, I see stays and you see your wife, we're just going to go. It's been so long. I'm, it's just so much. No, you got it. You got to set it up with talking. Like you just got to start off normal white. You're going to say something really sentimental to them, so they're almost crying and then you cry, which ruins their crying. And I swear to God, you get slugged in the shoulder, which is all you really want. Oh Shit. 20 minutes. Then I'll tell you Paul, you know, time really flies with you on the porch. It's been so fun.

Speaker 3:          00:52:58       This is probably only funny to us, but I don't give a shit. Try it with your friends stuff. Fuck that. If people, the game is called, he gets emotional and just walk into a bar. Just have one of your friends started hitting on a woman and then the other friends got to go along. Yep. And then just starts welling up and then the other guy goes on. Sorry. He just gets emotional and you just got to let the other person to deal with it. Dude, you want it to fucking airport where you walked up to that lady at the con though? The little fucking I sell gum, whatever the hell it is. Excuse me. Do you have the, you have the, what are the biggest night I broke out? Yeah. I'll go. Hey ma'am, I need to, what are the biggest condoms you got there?

Speaker 3:          00:53:31       What's the biggest size condoms you have? I turned around and walked away and you turned around and walked away and I'm just staring at her and I'm biting my tongue as hard as I can to not laugh. And then I just burst out laughing at her. She said what? And then when you went to repeat it, you to try to point to it and I lost it. You lost it and had to walk away. Paul, we're punch drunk out here. You don't. One of my favorite things in this business was opie from the opiate Anthony show was he had this thing that he would do when guys would start crying when they would play audio. Yeah. Oh my God. It was fucking, his timing was perfect. Every time someone would be talking like retiring from a sport, like when Mike Schmidt retired, which is, you know, it's very difficult to watch these guys, you know, you know, he just was ending is like 38 years ago a little boy began a journey to play the wonderful game of baseball. And the pope, he would always go, oh boy,

Speaker 3:          00:54:25       what am I favorite? And it always, oh boy. It always meant, oh, nobody wants to see a man just completely do you know what it is? I can watch a guy cry if something terrible is happening. Just don't try to talk while you're crying. Yeah. That's the thing. The talking and then bursting out into Christ. Let your shoulders go. Yeah, let me shut fucking crying. But don't fall for the love of God a man. He's a man. Needs to cry in private. Yeah, you do that in the shower it, he's doing it in the shower. Like when my son was born, everyone's like, did you cry yet? And I'm like, no, what are you talking about? And then when my son was born, it all hit me later and I went home to go get stuff for my wife in the hospital and I sat on the couch and I didn't like weep.

Speaker 4:          00:55:08       Gotcha.

Speaker 3:          00:55:09       I didn't weep when I got emotional. But like just fixing you, sitting on the couch by yourself and just, you just go, that's stupid. It's just completely unexpected. You use your thankful for your podcast. Oh, that's unexplored. The effective, unacceptable dude on a completely the talk into it, right? Yeah. The talk into it. That's, that's what the funny thing about crying is, you know, it's like, you know, you always do this to me. You know, you always do this to me and I'm trying my best fucking over whenever my friends die, I've had so many of fuck it died. I just cry in the shower. Yes. What I do, I asked the girl, we asked a girl, right, cause you don't feel like you crying because there's all that water on your face anyway.

Speaker 3:          00:55:56       No. We asked the girl, we go, what would you do if you're a dude started crying. Like if it wasn't, if nobody died, if a dude and you were just [inaudible] he just had a bad day and he just had a bad day and you got into it and he broke down and cried. She goes, yeah, no. Over, over, over. Get the fuck away from me. You know what's funny? There's some women, they think that they want to see that part of you. They don't get what that is to them is that's their total conquest. Like you know when you bang a girl in the ass and you just like, yeah I got this shit. I'm fucking with you.

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       Their version. I was just like Jesus pill. No fuck we do. Their version of that is is if they can get you to be so vulnerable around them that you cry and then it's one of those things, it's almost like when the crowd screams out of joke, they already heard, they think they want to hear it again and then you tell it's like ah yeah it wasn't as good. Now it's the same thing. Is that, yeah. You said something, you said something about like if a burglar comes in, if you cry in front of a woman, all her mind is like, what if the burglar comes down at this fucking guy? Yeah, no it's over. You can't cry. You Strip a woman a security if you cry in front of her. I think, I don't think I've cried if I think my wife saw me. That's what it is. Yeah. You Strip her of her security. Cause now she's like, well I got this fucking, yeah, this foreign crisis, this baby sleeping next to you every night, you know? Yeah, it's, it's over. You know what I mean? I know you just, you might as well just have a pullover sweater on, you know, walking around and then she mocks you. What are you going to cry Bitch, you so me?

Speaker 3:          00:57:22       Yeah, it's fucking over dude. You can't have that if you have a car. Have you ever cried alone listening to a song or like get, not cried, but have you ever been like, oh no, I completely broken down and I've told three cars just weeping uncontrollably. I bought. Yeah, totally cry. No, no, I've definitely teared up. Listen, as an, as an artist, at some point you're going to have to go to those emotions you need. You need to be a, you need to meet to with your instrument. No, I have, I, what was the ones like I had this weird thing where I stopped crying at some point. I Dunno, when I stopped crying and got mad more when, when I got hurt on my brother, beat the shit out of me. Um, you know, most of the crying I'd be, it's just like at the end of it. But I wasn't, but I wasn't crying. I didn't cry one time.

Speaker 3:          00:58:18       My brother is bigger than me. My little brother's biggest thing. Right. Big Toe. Like, and I remember he, I said, I said, if you fucking take my clothes again, if you take my clothes that he did it every day he would go into my room, we take my delta would take my clothes and I'd come home and he gets in a boy band and I need to go, I need to go out, right. And I go, mom, if he does it again, I'm fucking hitting him. If my mom be like, oh, you know, he and he, and one time I need really needed a shirt and I'm fucking throwing shit through the house. And he gets out of his friend's car and he starts walking up and he's got it on and I fucking snapped. And my grandmother was there. And I jumped on him and I started punching him and he stood up and he just goes, well, you made your older brother cried on my younger brother. Oh, he's bigger than me. But he didn't know what to do. He got so upset that he just got, and he looked around, he just, he was so angry that something needed to come out. And he just goes, what did you feel bad? And you start laughing. Oh, I kinda just walked away. And you know, we laughed about it afterwards, but to now, now he's a, he's a fuck a big kid. But

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       you know, my mom had the opposite. I got a little brother mind. He's an animal, you know. No, my mom said she went to a, she went to a funeral once and everybody was there and everybody was crying and she was overwhelmed with emotion that they had to fucking drag her out. She said she had them. Uh, one of the most embarrassing things happen to her. What she said, she uncontrollably laughed because they said that that can happen sometimes. So she's sitting there, she's, she's sitting there and everybody's crying. And like she went up and she could not stop laughing and like she and I said, why? And she was like, Paul, I just don't know. She goes, I could not stop laughing and I had to walk me out and like as she just is your mom? Yeah. She said because the emotions or some bugs that they said that that could happen sometimes where it just, you just like, she didn't know what to do.

Speaker 3:          01:00:04       So instead of just breaking down, she went the other way and just couldn't, couldn't, yeah. Controller. Yeah. Not like humans like will protect you and a really like that's what they don't get sometimes when comics make fucking horrific jokes about some bad event. Make good jokes. Yeah. It's about a horrific event. So they go, that's so fucking mean. It's a defense mechanism. It's, my mom isn't, my mom was a sweetheart who felt bad and her emotions just went the other way and she goes, Paul, I felt so bad. I couldn't control myself should I couldn't control myself. I hate to say this because somebody lost somebody, but there was, if there was video of that. Oh my God. Yeah. Oh, I'm sorry. I was saying, so I stumbled around, I don't know, 10 or 11. I didn't cry for years. Years and years and years.

Speaker 3:          01:00:43       And I didn't, I didn't cry until a friend of mine killed himself. And even then I was sad and it's just, Oh, I went, uh, I was in the bathroom once again. Yeah. And it was in there. And I remember I started to cry and then I started thinking like, wow, I'm crying. I haven't cried in a long time. And then I stopped because I get out of it cause I stopped thinking about the Duke killed himself. Wow. Yeah. I went 10 years without a cry and then I had one. What was it? Over Yogurt? Gummy bears? No. Uh, I think, yeah, it might've been, it might've been one of my son was born, you know, it might've been on my second one. That's acceptable. I guess it's acceptable back in the day. Just stood out in the waiting room. Right.

Speaker 1:          01:02:31       I had a great time in Vegas other than when I went down to the pool because I go down to the pool, I'm down there to me, it's fucking j lie had, who's been killing it in front of me and uh, the lovely Niyyah and our cousins and were hanged. Any cousin, I mean, and we're hanging out down the pool and they're doing the usual shit, you know, if you're a red head and he'd go down to the pool, like you're just asking for people to all, you know, look how white you are. You know, like, I had never noticed. It's like I'm fucking around myself. I've been around myself since the 60s, the late sixties. I know how white I am and if I ever forget how white I am, there's always somebody there to remind me.

Speaker 4:          01:03:13       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:03:13       sorry. I don't know if you've noticed your skin tone. What am I meditating? Floating up out of my body. All right, so these people are with doe. Come on, come on in the poor and like, I don't want to go in the pool. I don't want to go on the fucking pool. You know, they're like, why? No, why don't you want to go in the pool? You know why? Because the fucking,

Speaker 4:          01:03:33       okay,

Speaker 1:          01:03:33       look at, look at these people. Look at them, look at them. And you're getting, you're getting you, you know, would you take a bath with all, with any one of the people that you see here, these fucking just masses of human beings. There's not enough chlorine in a fucking pool to kill whatever the fuck they're dragging in the pool. You know, it was like, I finally end up going to the pool. Then everybody made fun of how white my fucking alabaster chest was, a da that I had to stay in the shade of the fucking, the lifeguard's chair, you know, you know, I had a show to do, I'm being a professional, I can't come out stage later, half in the bag looking like, oh, lot stuff right now. I've got to do my little song and dance later on that night. So anyway, so I ended up getting in the fucking pool against my, what I wanted to do, you know?

Speaker 4:          01:04:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:04:27       And then I get out of the pool. Uh, first of all, for my age, I am an absolutely phenomenal top shelf shape. Alright, I got to tell you the fucking, just the deaf fuck the humanity that I saw poolside in Las Vegas, the fucking humanity.

Speaker 4:          01:04:52       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:04:53       Keyword manatee. Not this gap step on a Jim Gaffigan. I just realized he used to use that reference and I'm pretty sure he used it. I can't remember how the fuck he used it, but if he used it to describe a fat pale torso, not really pale border, whatever the fucking Shit I saw the side of the, he was dead on that. Oh my God. Is there anything worse than seeing a tattoo come of age? You know

Speaker 1:          01:05:29       Jesus Christ. If you get a tattoo, you better. You better just make the mental decision that you're going to pay 90 x for the rest of your fucking life. Cause when you don't do it, I saw this guy down at the pool. All right. He had like not only the worst tattoos you've ever seen in your life, like the worst placement, you know what I mean? Like you get one like on the side of your arm up by your shoulder, that looks good, right on the bicep. That looks good. You know Joe, somebody got gets one right over there. Voicebox like I don't give a fuck what you have surrounding that. That leads into that part of the, of the of the work or the piece, whatever they call it looks fucking horrible. Leg Tattoos, horrific, horrific. So this fucking jerk off. He has basically the exact sort of like tribal thing that the rock has except he doesn't look tribal.

Speaker 1:          01:06:24       He looks like an accountant, you know, and he doesn't work out. So just imagine if the rock was his pasty as I was and it never worked down in his life. But has that same tattoo that starts at the elbow, goes up the arm over the shoulder and covers one whole peck. But the way this guy had it done was it didn't cover his whole packet, came swinging in and went right above his, his man nipple. So now all of the, all of that is like colored in. So because of the pace genus of his torso, your eye is just drawn to his right nipple. Is he standing in the fucking pool? My neck was sore from shaking my head at people. It was, it was absolutely fucking horrific, right? So, so anyways, um, I go back up to the, uh, I go back up to the hotel room, right? You know, gotta make sure that I'm all ship shape for my God damn show and I put on the news and what are they end up doing a story about? They start doing a story about the amount of, uh, fecal matter found in public pools

Speaker 1:          01:07:44       right after I just got out of a God damn pool. You know? And I know people always think, oh, stay away from where the kids are. Stay away from the Kiddie Pool. Right? Stay away from that. They always blame the fucking kids will, ah, you know something after seeing what I saw a poolside, you know, there weren't a lot of kids in there, but I guarantee you somebody's got a cola. I know this is fucking disgusting. But people you've, you're basically bathing, you know what's even more fucked up is Vegas is just like, you know, people fly in all over the world. You taking a fucking aids bath, you know, with a shot of fucking, uh, what the hell is that shit that came out, but it killed people so fast that it just burned out. Everybody just ran into the woods. The fuck was that shit called.

Speaker 4:          01:08:31       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:08:32       Ah, Christ. I can't remember a bola. That's it with a shot of a bola.

Speaker 4:          01:08:39       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:08:39       Oh, whatever. Food poisoning. I don't know what it is. A salmon, Ellis shower, whatever the fuck you want to call it. I'm done with public pools. The only pool that I will ever swim in again is my pool. If I ever get one or the pool of some hot chick that I want to fucking bank, cause I have knee permission, that's the only way it's going to go down. Other than that, you know, I'll just go, I'll just go take a bath.

Speaker 1:          01:09:05       That way I'm out of the sun. You know, we'll take a couple of vitamin E pills, whatever the fuck it is. You get from the sun other than skin cancer, I'm done with it. You know what America needs to implement after years and years of calling the French people smelly. You know? That's Kinda like the thing when we went over to France and saved their ass for the second time last century. Oh wait, did we do it once? We did it one time, right? I can't fucking remember. So anyways, we've always made fun of the French filed. They smell, they smell. If you ever watched a bugs bunny growing up, man, you saw pepe Le Pew. If you noticed he had a French accent, you know, that's the kind of shit you couldn't get away with today because of political correctness. I guess they were basically saying that you know that they stuck. But I'll tell you one thing that the French have when it comes to hygiene over America. All right? Is the day. All right? I can guarantee you if I ever go swimming in a public pool again, it's going to be at Fred's Ellis

Speaker 1:          01:10:11       is a bunch of Americans. I know. I've been over to England. I never saw it, but day over there, you know, but day is basically a car wash for your asshole Ed. Uh, you know, it leaves you feeling refreshed, puts a fucking smile on your face, and evidently had France. She's so fucking happy. You forget to put on deodorant, but I'll tell you right now, you can jump in that pool. I bet they're not dead, but they're not talking about that shit over there,

Speaker 2:          01:10:37       right. [inaudible].
