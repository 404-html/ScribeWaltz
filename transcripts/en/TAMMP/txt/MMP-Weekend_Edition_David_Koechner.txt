Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burr and it's a very special Monday morning podcast that a, we're actually recording on a Friday and you'd probably be like, why you're doing something so special bill, because it's the holiday season. You know, I love you guys and a lot of you, a real country to me on, on, uh, didn't realize I was flying back from my big whirlwind tour of shaking my ass over there in Europe. So on, I mentioned in the podcast I was going to have one of my best friends here. Favorite people in the God damn business has a huge comedy movie that actually transcends the genre. It's better than any Meryl Streep drama from an Anchorman. Two please welcome the one and only Dave Kepner everyone or a sounding boom bill burr. What's going on man? Can kind, yeah. Uh, how am I? I'm psyched. I haven't seen them more.

Speaker 1:          00:00:57       There you go. That'll bounce around then your heads for a second. Folks. You got it. You got it out of the way. I'm here with bill burr. I cannot tell you how happy I am. Folks. I know you envy me. I envy me. No, they don't. My podcast listeners, once they heard me read out loud, all the magic of anything that I was doing went away. What do you mean read out loud? When I do, when I do the, uh, oh, the acidosis. Yeah. When I'm ready to make funny you, there's nothing. I think they actually feel bad for me. I'm, it's terrible. That's not true. This is what happened. I sucked at reading out loud and school and that. So like now I'm reading out loud again in the same thing happens where you're just trying to get to the end of it. So you start going faster and faster.

Speaker 1:          00:01:36       Like the amount of times that I mispronounced my own name, your own name. When I get to bill [inaudible] dot com. What do you say? Like bill burr. Oh yeah, it's embarrassing. I just start doing it now. Like it's a golf thing. Okay. And you know, I just realized how fucking hot it's going to get in this goddamn. So these were all things, comedy podcast studios here for the very first day interview. And, uh, so we're, we're, we're working out a lot of bugs. We've got, sorry, we've got some echo. I couldn't be happier. Here's what we got and that brought us some almonds. Yeah. Because I'm going to enjoy an Alma. No, they brought over a key here that ms, she bought a beer. Okay. For Bill and you also Brian Talents. Let's make sure we get this out just in case somebody lives under the rock.

Speaker 1:          00:02:18       Anchorman two, the legend of Ron Burgundy. It continues after fans for 10 years. We're asking when is it continuing? It's continuing right now when we, it, it was supposed to open today, but if they opened it Wednesday, two days early. Oh okay. Yup. That's why we scheduled this cause this was going to be the exclusive opening date podcast. Right. But only with a great bill. Burb so they, the paramount did the switch. It's okay. Didn't, they didn't clear it with Billy to dirt. It's a dirty business, dirty business fairly. So they knew what was going to happen over here and are unheated echoing studios. They didn't want to be with you. So, um, what I want to take your dose. So I, last time I ran into you. Yeah, I was over, over in Dublin and I sent, I send you a picture, right, for the listeners here.

Speaker 1:          00:03:03       I'm, I'm in Dublin sleepy, and I see a nice go by, back us up a little bit, rot me all you will back us up a little fucking cock. So I'm thinking, you know, I get a few tickets to the premiere. It's in New York City, uh, not in Los Angeles, which is typical. And I'm thinking, uh, bill was able to drop by the set when he came through Atlanta when we were shooting. And uh, you're so amazing and magnanimous and everybody in the cast like outdoors. We don't do this to that podcast. Too Bad you're going to take it. You're not going to give me shit. I'm not going to be shot. I'll fucking hype another comedy. You'd do it. So anyway, I still know what I thought. I saw it coming out. Bill has to be whatever the fuck it is. Bill burr has to be here.

Speaker 1:          00:03:40       So I invited bill and his wife and he goes, ah, I have a show in Iceland that night, which was last Sunday, the 15th. So that's all I know was like, Oh bill, it will be out of country. Uh, I didn't, I'm not, not unlike you guys. I don't regularly check bills blog. So I didn't know. Anyway, I'm in London, so I put all my dates on my blog write, I don't write, I'm in London, we're getting ready to do the premiere and I get this text message from Bill Blur. Yeah. Blow bar is I say [inaudible]. Yeah, it was coming from the uh, the airport and I saw a bus go by and it said at 10 we'll and all you guys on the side of it and uh, it's, you know, anchorman two, the legend Romberg and continues. So I took the picture and I sent it to Dave going, hey man, the hype in the cause they were billboards where everywhere.

Speaker 1:          00:04:29       I was like the hype and the Shit out of movie over here and the tablet like Dublin, you're in Dublin? Yeah, I'm in Dublin, Dublin. That and I are London. I was in Dublin, holy, shy, just fucking perfect. And I, and I ended up doing, and he goes, what? We got the, we got to premiere tonight. What time's your show? Em, we can go out and drink a couple of fucking Loggins put it. How crazy is that? You can't make the premiere because you're going somewhere else. You're in Dublin the same night where they're doing the premiere and you can't do it because you're doing your world tour of northern Europe, but we'll call it all towards sounds great. It's amazing. I'll get to the rest of the world is so we get was. So, uh, we do our little thing. Dance Bill does his song and dance.

Speaker 1:          00:05:12       What the what theater, where were you? I was at that, the Vic Vicar Street theater and I absolutely like so much of my childhood now make sense after that crowd? I can't explain it man. Just grown up outside of Boston. And uh, I think I told you those stories at night. I mentioned them last Monday on the podcasts. All kind of, just to paraphrase him, just not to bore the listeners, but like I've been doing this bit about, you know, hugging your children, saying, you know, if your hug them too much, they're pussies if you don't do enough to become psycho. So I always always weaving and go, you know, my mother didn't hug me that much when I was a kid and no one has ever reacted to that. And I'm like, literally like 15 20% of the Irish crowd just goes, aw, breaking my balls. Like fuck you, you need a hug you pussy now.

Speaker 1:          00:05:51       It was, but it was hilarious. And then at the end I'm talking about how I'm giving out a free DVD to everybody who showed up to hopefully, you know, by the carpet bomb my special over there. Smart. Yeah. Yeah. Well I guess I should've just put it on Spotify according to this internet chick, but a personal to have it. Yeah. So as I'm telling them, I'm giving you a free DVD that they're listening and just some guy in the back just goes out. Fuck off. What hilarious. Wow. Anything Nice. It was and it was, it was no, but they, they're doing it in a f yeah, breaking your balls. And I told them, I said, you guys have performed from a lot of and miserable people be you guys are the most miserable cons. And I didn't even get to the end of the sentence.

Speaker 1:          00:06:28       They were already dying laughing. Awesome. They were just like, uh, I can't explain it man. Like I just felt like these like I get it. I get like, why I can't take a compliment. Don't like fucking Nice Shit. If somebody breaks my balls, I literally, it will run through a wall for, I'm like the second they look at you when you think you lose your fucking shirt. I'm immediately like, my heart fills up like the fucking grand love. But if you actually sit there and pay you call, you were trying to do at the beginning of the podcast. No, I'll smash it. Elastic chair over here. Like, all right, that won't do, I won't do that till you're a big guy. When the guy from Missouri, yeah, but bill burn, I got to share a few pints, uh, in some seller, a bar of wherever we were staying in Dublin with where the nice joints I guess singing Christmas songs.

Speaker 1:          00:07:14       Yeah. So Your Cra and loud heal itself. Yeah. Um, here's my favorite part of Dublin. For me. We did this promotional thing, maybe of the folks have seen any promo, but we did all kinds of different ones. And then this particular one, there were some winners of some thing. There were three groups of 20 and they had gone on a pub crawl and at the end of the pub crawl was a surprise. And it was the four of us. It was, we'll Steve, Paul and myself. No Way. When this bar in Dublin called, uh, I think it's to lease or Tony's Tunies, it's one of the old bars. And uh, so we're down there and we get a pint of Guinness and we're like, ah, boy, this is so needed right now. This is perfect. We just traveled from New York that day. Ended up a bunch of press. Did the, uh, we, no, this is before the premiere. We're getting ready to go to do a premiere and uh, the owner of the place comes up to me and he grabs me by the shoulders straight on, right, right. Two on either side. And he goes, uh, you look like you enjoy a pint.

Speaker 1:          00:08:16       Tell me lad. Oh yeah, Irish. I said, well actually, yeah, my mom's side. He goes, I knew it. And to me that's where the greatest things that ever happened in my life because he's like, you know, this is the best pint of Guinness in all of Ireland. Right? It's voted the best paint in Dublin and knew what that means. Was there a better pilot than Dublin? And I was like, wow, I just went to heaven. I know it's its way to these these people. Then. Then they'd bring them in in groups of 20, we'd say, hi, hi. Hi. They all had to gather round is take one cup of white now they must freak the fuck out there. Let go. They're all bombed now because they've been on a pro pub crawl for you guys had that wasn't so bad because the security guys over there were amazing on the international tour.

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       They were like, okay, here's what you're doing and take a picture of boob. No more pictures. Boom. You can't do selfies. You can't do anything else. Get out next group. But it was, it was amazing. So we did I think three pints and a shot of a of Jamison. This is making me wish I was back there and yeah. And then we went to the premiere and this crowd was a mob in the greatest way. It's the greatest energy I've ever felt. And I asked will and those guys, have you ever been through a gauntlet like that? And they're like, no. That was the most intense thing we've ever been through. It was just love. Yeah. They give it up over there. Yeah, I would. You got to go to Scotland. Great. Yeah, that whole area, man. Great. Great Britain. Dare, dare, like, uh, you know what's funny as I've mentioned this, like they're all going to get mad if I actually say that people in London were call half the people in England are probably giving me shit, but they're deaf and they're like the w like each one of them has their own vibe, the way they're coming at you.

Speaker 1:          00:09:50       And all of them kind of reminded me of people that I like grew up with. Man. Such a great, like if you're going to Europe for the first time, like that's such a great place to start before you get oh yeah. You know, cause Ireland, you know, some people are like, I don't want to not know the language and shit. So that's a good way to, to break yourself had before then you start at zero and all these other great places. Um, I was gonna ask you, so like when, you know, I've done like the standup tours and that type of stuff and I'd done like radio tours and shit. Like what is, um, I mean, it sounds awesome. You get to go to all these places, but I know they like stick you in a room and, and you just kind of go. First of all, the hotels they put us in were amazing.

Speaker 1:          00:10:28       So and on this international thing, you don't even touch her bag. All that stuff. They pull the roll you up, they put you each in an individual car, which going back to what you know, the way you feel is like, no, no, we'll all write together. Yeah, you don't need to put me in one like, well there's a row row six cars with one person in it. It's like, come on. I'd rather write with my buddies. I know. So the eagles, I heard the eagles. So we do that. They pick you up right outside the plane. Like we don't even go to the regular deportation thing or not deportation, sorry, immigration thing. They pick us up outside the plane. They put us in these cars, they take us a special little room. They tenure retinas ideally right there. They get your passports and you wait in there.

Speaker 1:          00:11:13       You have a ta. If you want one or whatever, then you're like on your way, you don't even touch your bags, you just go to the hotel. Oh fuck. Did these movie stars Bitch about doing these press junkets? Like that difficult. That sounds fucking phenomenal. Then they're too jaded and they, they need to be brought down a peg and they need to go out on tour and doing standup at that little drink isn't fizzy enough. Wow. That's, I don't know how people get to that point. I don't know how people get to the point of bitching about convenience. So that was amazing. We go through all that stuff and then, you know, then you go get a, have a pint, a place like that. It was, it was great, but it was like that all over. It was, you know, uh, uh, Australia we did and then we did a Dublin, we did Sydney, Dublin in London first class all the way and yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:11:55       So you had to sit in one room. Oh wait, you went, you went to Sydney first and then, then you came back to la, back to la for Thanksgiving, then New York. I did Bristol did Sydney Sydney's Greater Sydney is great. You get a chance to look at the beaches and stuff. I know. Well I did climb some bridge. They have your climb, which I didn't get to do that, you know that is, yeah. Yeah, but pretty amazing. So then, but they take care of you all the way. I mean, I feel so bad about it. Like I need this suit pressed is said okay. If the pays for the suit because he's been the suitcase and so want you far of a deck, right. You've got to be an asshole. Got It. You got it. You got to add what is this into your repertoire, right. So then, uh, those first class all the way, it was amazing.

Speaker 1:          00:12:39       It's fucking awesome man. But anyway, Billy couldn't come to the premiere cause he's in Reykjavik, Iceland, correct? That night. The 15th last Sunday. Yeah. Crushing it and, or eating shit. I'm not sure which way it went now. I went good to the understand you're back now. Thank God they got bill burst humor. They went great. I love that it's sold out. I don't know, listeners sold out, there was enough people that is, that listened to, you don't know half. Oh, I can't lie. I mean I think, I think we did pretty good. I'm definitely going, definitely going to go back. But, uh, um, um, I've been such a huge fan of yours for as far as like the, that full on cactus site and I did a number of times and one of my favorite characters is the, as of Roy Roy, you know what I love about it is it's such a specific guy.

Speaker 1:          00:13:27       Like we're not, when I do like a gay guy, I do the hackey one that offends them, you know, like Jesus Christ. Guys, can we all just be frowned, which everybody has done. Uh, but on yours it's like the dude has like, he has an eating addiction, that one where he's, he's cheesecake and one ever. Ah, so Roy is at 350 pound gay man who has a boyfriend's name is Roy. He has two cats named Siegfried and Roy. So it's really confusing and I'm not sure which one's the most, the biggest tomcat in the house. It's my broil Dakar off. Okay guys. He's passive aggressive. He's aggressive, aggressive. He's made, he's meaning please a suite because he's hurt cause he wants to be loved and he isn't in excel. He lashes out. He doesn't mean that it's such a fucking like as opposed to my horse shit, one dimensional things.

Speaker 1:          00:14:20       This is a fully fleshed out thing like me and my wife needed neat. We watched this and we'd fucking laugh our asses off. And then recently that terrains like that, that crooked like bounty hunter one, I actually came across that, that I let creep along with like the comb over. Oh Gerald. Yeah. I'm not too familiar on him but that was the another one completely. Uh, he's a hillbilly cause he's, he's a drifter, a drifter and his best friends or Hobos and I mean real hobos. The guys that ride the trains has named Gerald [inaudible]. Hey, what's going on Bill Burr? It's cold in here. What does that, how do you, how do you cut it? You come up with that shit. That guy's kind of based on this. This roofer drifter they came through in my small town when I was 15 working at my uncle's gas station, beer joint restaurant.

Speaker 1:          00:15:06       And this is when you'd still pumped gas and this guy was or make somebody a steak. Yeah, I would. I swear to God. Here's what a typical day was. In fact, they're usually take someone's order. You go back, you get their soda or someone else has to get their beer. You start their burger. Ding, Ding. And remember the old days when you'd go to a gas station, ran over there, there'd be an air hose that that red that rang a bell inside the main summit. Go pump gas. Dang. Dang. So Burger, you don't flip it yet. You go out, pump gas, get their money, go give them their change. And this is when gas was under a dollar. This is 1977 under a dollar. So go back end. And then I dip my hands into the dish soap that's in the sink. That's it. There wasn't even a dishwasher dip 'em in you rent some a little bit and then turn that Burger, throw some cheese on it and go serve the God damn thing as it has.

Speaker 1:          00:15:57       His tank is filling up. Yeah. Dang. Dang. He's inside his car with the windows up smoking with the baby in the back. He doesn't know. Yeah. That's actually something, I bet if you brought that back, do you think as far as like a business model, if you brought back an old school gas station where it was service with service, it's a full service thing and you could actually get a burger. Um, would people be willing to do it? I know hipsters would. Yeah. And they would pull up and act like they didn't notice that this isn't what every gas station is like. Right. But like just for somebody, cause like for me, like I was basically came of age in the eighties but it was a kid in the seventies so I, I'm trying to think the lowest side. I think I remember 89 cents a gallon.

Speaker 1:          00:16:39       Wow. Lotus. I remember something like, uh, like the mid seventies or something, but, uh, I, I've always wondered like if I, that's, maybe that's just something because I grew up back then. I'm like, I would love if you could bring back the shit that I remember that when you go to New Jersey and you've got to wait for, when you go to New Jersey, you got to wait for somebody to pump. Your gas is kind of a pain in the ass now. Right now. I actually love that. You do. I love it. I love not getting out of the fucking car and I'll pay the extra whatever a gallon puts you, let love it. People and their eyes are bloodshot because they're huffing fumes all day long and you're like, Jesus, it's like a peel. The toll booth workers. I worry about them. Why aren't you wearing a, an oxygen mask?

Speaker 1:          00:17:15       What was it like when you, you're a Missouri Guy, right? Yeah. Growing up, um, out there. What you athlete football gloves. They'll look at me. What we have bullying? Nothing. No, no. I like six to 600 million, but I grew up in Atlanta. You put our bus driver and a full Nelson on. You don't remember that. Well then tiptoe while tipping over a fucking couch. I know you're in rare form. Well I had a few pints and I watched Bill Bernie turned into the hulk. Happy Pretty. She could put and then Paul Rudd, but for the record, for the record and drug me out of this. Right. And then rod put you in a full Nelson. But by the way, if everybody listening, it was all, it was all fucking around. Yeah, it was fucking round. Yeah. But then I apologize to bill via text the next day and bill said that couch had it in.

Speaker 1:          00:17:59       I was like, cause I was shit phase two and you kept tipping it over and pee. We kept picking it up and every time I look back you had tipped it over again. What an idiot. No, you're not. You're hilarious. You're not tipping over furniture. You're singing Christmas songs. You're a a few self. Oh Merry Little Christmas. That's all we need to know. We didn't know the end and have yourself a merry little Christmas day that we send it that we sent. What do we say? I think we're saying gay. Okay. We're acting like we couldn't remember it. So we'd throw a different word and every time I'm speaking to that, did you see a, well, I shouldn't bring that up cause everything's all controversial. Or was it just said Duck Dynasty guy? You know how long was it before anyway, there's going to figure it those guys out.

Speaker 1:          00:18:48       You give that guy enough. You know what? I don't understand. I'm going to talk about some state, so I don't want to run in the Bin, but just the fact that they keep coming after these guys who keep quoting that book, why don't you go up to the book? What's the book? The Bible. Oh boy. You know why that pockets at too deep. Yeah. So they go after Sunday. Got just some guy shooting pigeons on a boat. Yeah. Well that shit was pumped into his head when he, before he grew his first whisker. Yeah. You become like dementia. Every candidate. Well has he made, is he recanted his statement yet? Does he come out and said, this is mia culpa and go on. Sorry. It was my fault. Uh, uh, he'll, he'll, he'll go to some, there's just, I don't think it helps homophobia to make a guy loses his job.

Speaker 1:          00:19:33       And I think you have to come at somebody in a more understanding way as opposed to just like, uh, I don't know how far you go on your podcast, but I filmed him getting a Bj from a super queen. Okay. That's when he hit it. He hit her with his beard. So now he's trying to save face. I don't know what's going on. Why would I drag him into that? You're here. Why not? I don't, I don't, I shouldn't matter to me. I'm here to talk to Bill Berg. What do I care about? Um, but I don't care about that guy. Whatever. Uh, you know what? You learned your lesson. Hey, time to evolve. I think that's the lesson here. Like the Fox report is going to Santa Claus is white. My thing. How can I say? You know, there's Fox News shows said Santa Claus is white. Isn't he fun?

Speaker 1:          00:20:18       The Netherlands what? And Jesus is white too. Yeah. Then he, he ever happened? Yeah. I mean, I, I honestly selling clothes at react guy ever happened. Which one? Santa Claus or Jesus. Oh, Jesus. Santa Claus is real. He's in your heart is in your heart and your heart. Look, I don't give a shit what color he is. It comes down my chimney. He comes down, he still does. Gives me a couple of Cuban cigars, you know? Is that what your thing is? Cubans. Yeah. I Dunno. Listeners, I allegedly might've brought some entity. I enter the country in your luggage. Are you uh, that's not a cigar smoker. I can't do anymore. I used to be carry a pitching. I, uh, when I got to be about 45, I'd always have a cigar at the end of the night if I'm out with my buddies drinking. And um, which was every night.

Speaker 1:          00:21:03       But, uh, when I was about 45, uh, I had one deal, the nightmares, I was like, oh yeah, they can get you. If you get a strong one and get half of that in. I've done that and all send you start puking like you play in a Frat can't do it anymore. Yeah. Which is good. It's a good thing. Not as a good time anymore. I do it well. What I liked about it was when you smoke a cigar, this is feeling that of accomplishment and whether you did anything or not. So if you had a bad day, it's a great choice. You know? I mean it's, sure the health side effects is bad, but it, it's, it's a wonderful thing to do. You don't have to inhaler, which, you know, you just get mouth cancer and that lung cancer I guess. Oh is that right? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:21:39       So what happens? You're not inhaling, how do you get mouth cancer, but just it's just, it's damaging to the cells. I'm guessing. I don't know what it is, but it has less, probably less carcinogens than, than cigarettes. Cause they fill all that stuff with ammonia and everything else. Well, can somebody figure out like how many, you can have a month, cigarettes, cigars, not die. Can they hit you up on your, on your website and let you know somebody, there's a doctor out there that listens to you, who will give you advice. So any oncologists out there, I want to give builders when you buy them overseas, like they don't fuck around. I go over here, it says, you know, as surgeon general warning or did they have, they go smoking causes, um, mouth cancer and they show a picture of a guys cancerous mouth time. I was in, uh, recently I was in Toronto and I was buying some cigars and I was at the airport with a, I forget her, the one, another comic I was looking at, he was like, Jesus, like the first time you saw, I'm kind of immune to it because you've seen enough.

Speaker 1:          00:22:33       But I, at the first time I saw it I was like, oh my God. So I go through periods where I've cigar smoking. Obviously when I come back from overseas, like I'm going to do some damage. Okay, next. My you want as your wife feel about it. Uh, she's cool as hell. Dod Jordy, talk about your, your marriage and, and, uh, uh, what had happened and how it happened because I don't know this now. I didn't really, I didn't bring it up because, so what's the best service? No, I didn't do it. Yeah. Cause I wanted to just, uh, people, people know the name of my dog. They know, you know, my girlfriend at the time, they just knew a lot and I was just kind of, it was a, I just hit like they're not told them that you're married now. I mean when you go to my show is, I mean, I say I am, but I have, I guess I haven't said it on the podcast yet. Okay. I wanted to have something that was kind of like, you didn't have a big ceremony. No. Okay. Because I would have been hurt. We buy and we went out to a duck pond and we had a couple of homophobic guys in boats. Who Marius, no big American flag headbands on.

Speaker 1:          00:23:32       Um, so anyway, if you had a reception, what's the reception for your, for your nuptials like a big party. A celebration. Um, just say no cause you invite me. I think we had three. We had an engagement party. I think we had an old farm. Emmett, how are you doing dude? You're a fucking movie star. You're flying around. I didn't know you wanted to come to that. Like I looked at it like I didn't know you wanted to come to that or come on, I'm in love of Bill Brown. She says, here it is. I'm going to get shit. You should get shit. Listen, are you registered anywhere? My registered anywhere you register when you get married, you were registered places for people to buy you gifts with these questions. Can you tell who handled everything? Your wife? Yeah, I know I've done it. Yeah, he went through it.

Speaker 1:          00:24:18       It's good. And as long as you give her a Christmas card from us this year too. I've been, I leave won't be good at one of the Bro. I'm taking you off the list. Just so you know. That's all I'm saying. Well, this, I think that's a little challenge. Is it childish? Yeah. You won't invite a guy to or something. I felt like the staging point. You met him, you had this chip on your shoulder. So why don't we not agree now the way Aaron everything out. Why don't you just get it off your goddamn chest. The bag of almonds and smells.

Speaker 1:          00:24:53       Very nice. Um, sports affiliation. Sports are big on this podcast. They're gonna wanna know Kenzie g, some commie Pinko kindly you watch city chiefs tends to say cheese right here. I think they're gonna make the super bowl. How do you think he coached? Looks in the new red versus read. Doesn't look good. I me come on, but don't matter. I think he's lost a few weight. A few pounds. I think it's good. I think he, I knew he could hide when he's in Philly with that forest green. Yeah, we can't hide. You can't, you know, reading is not slumming. All I know is the dude is winning. He brought in 24 new coaches. He's changed the organization. They weren't, they won two games last year and now they've completely turned around. What? We weren't nine. Oh, okay. Uh, were the winning is captain, are you buying?

Speaker 1:          00:25:39       Are you selling? Oh, nice. That's good. This, this comedian, uh, for shall we were talking about that stupid segment that they have on one of those sports channels. He buy it, he'll sell it. Kansas city chiefs, the chiefs in the playoffs. You sitting there with the plastic helmet, two mugs of beer. You've already beaten half of your children, right? You're ready for game time. W what do you think if you get home field? Well, who is stopping the chiefs? Well, Denver's done it twice so they can't answer the third time. They can't yet. And one of the only say on ESPN, I'll tell you right now, and it's really difficult to be a t three types of one year. Not going to happen. I like it. But who are we going to wind up with patriots to the Paychex. I want it done in the playoffs.

Speaker 1:          00:26:21       Tom Brady. Tom Brady's haven't one of his best years and people are sitting to going has he fallen off? It's just like everybody's been injured. I, one of our best guys went to prison and we didn't get anything for him. When you got goes the president, you don't, yeah, you don't get draft picks. Okay. And then, and then our best guy at every level on defense is as either been out or is out for the season. Our Best Linebacker, I best down Lineman to week two of our best down lineman and keep to leave like the, our, our, our guy, you just ignore him on that side of the field when he's playing. He said he just had a hip injury. Um, it's been really a difficult year. And then somehow if we didn't lose last week, we were actually in the driver's seat. They have home field throughout the playoffs.

Speaker 1:          00:27:01       I mean him and bell check. It's insane what they've been doing this yet. But um, you can, you can fool people. And the regular season, I'm not going to name names, I'm not going to be a dick, but there's a lot of people that are absolute monsters, um, in, in the regular season. And you get to the playoffs, it's a different, it's a different, everybody has a good defense. Everybody has a good offense. You might get away with it for a week, but once you get into that second week and forget about the third week, so, you know, we've, you know, we beat some teams that aren't the greatest teams, padding our victories. But I know when we go to the playoffs, like I don't see us like beaten the ravens. I mean, I know Ray Lewis and those guys aren't there anymore, but I just, they, oh, they weren't with on there on the foot.

Speaker 1:          00:27:43       They want on their, on their, uh, the kicker last week. Who did, uh, the ravens. I did they, I mean, I've, I've laughed. I missed the last two weeks of a football. Oh, you've been traveling around the world. Wow. Remember that folks? Bill's been around the world. He's better than you. No, I haven't. I've just been better than you. Hi, I'm Bill Berg. As what? One thing you should know, I'm better than you feel better than you podcasts like that. No, I'm actually, what I've been telling them last week before you paint me with your broad brush over there is that she read, she's brush. I, yeah. I say how bad I did in high school. How much I fucked up in my life. That if I can get to this, you can do it too. There you go. You're right. Yeah. Huh? Have you, the fans heard your coaching bit?

Speaker 1:          00:28:24       Do you still do that one? Which one is that? The, uh, coaching you're talking about? The Rutgers coach. Oh, you know, that was a topical one, so I had to kind of sound good. Yeah. You know, a couple times I'm being on stage and I'll remember, I'd be like, that was really fun. So good. So good. And you know, do you don't do Schwartzenegger? No, I put that out on the last special. Well, I've had this run, you know, that thing. I did a little bit of the bit on on Conan and uh, I ripped some of it that I hadn't done. Um, which was the, the disgrace channel and all that. That was just something I literally thought of that night on the show and I was like, ah, that would have had a lot of legs. But once I do it on TV, it's like I can't do it.

Speaker 1:          00:29:05       But the bit that I've been doing it just interchanges with names. At first it was Paula Dean and then it became Riley Cooper. You did the panel when that night too and then it was somebody else. And then yeah, when I go on Conan and I always have some sort of topical kind of thing that I, I tried to do, um, I'm working my way up to have the courage to tell a story on those things. Cause um, you know, like I'm not you, I'm just, yeah, I'm, I'm getting my feet wet as far as doing panel, you guys are all experienced to him. I've only done them a few times. So when you, when you do a bit on national television, you never do it in your act anymore. That's it. No. Wow. Wow. Hmm. I shouldn't say that. Like if I, if I do a, like if I did stand up on where it's, uh, you know, give us five minutes.

Speaker 1:          00:29:48       Okay. And I do like a minute and a half condensed version of an eight minute idea, then yeah, I'll do it again. Um, or if I touch on it, if I'm doing panel and for, but I don't go out on panel, like going, I'm going to do bits. Right. It's more like I'm going to be having a conversation and it's sort of a free association. Right. And then it's like, if it comes up great, it goes well how about, how about the, uh, hardworking mom's bit that you did on Letterman? Did that go on? Especially, I know, but like the Steve Jobs thing, that was so good. The Steve Jobs thing that he did on native, too many stores. We, yeah, that isn't, but what I liked about that was they, they, um, they kept the whole piece of it. So what I like about that is, you know, I'm an old school music guy, B sides and stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:30:36       That's a cool thing where it's just like, oh, you can't get that. You have to go on Youtube, got to go find it and you got to go find it. And if people just start finding out my comedy, they see a special goal, I want to see more of this guy. Like if they'd just keep seeing different things. What's gotten you the most attention on Youtube? Philadelphia? Uh, Phil was probably, it was probably the first thing I know I want to try to tell people. Sherry's berries from a few weeks ago was another one that got along. When I tell people what they should check out, bill burr on, on Youtube, what should I say? I say watch the thing in Philadelphia, that's not his thing. He doesn't take on the audience, but it is so fucking beautiful that that will give you the full essence of what you have done as such.

Speaker 1:          00:31:21       Now. You know how it got out of that and all honesty was just knowing sports and, and I lucked out where it was, is this, all those teams are there. So I was just outside of Philly. And you had teams from DC and the Redskins hate the eagles. You had people from Jersey and the Redwings hate the flyers here. People from New York and the Rangers. But the next part, the plugin giants. Was it 15 minutes? How much? How much time did you have? It was 12 minutes. 12 how much longer? I'm during the fall. 12 yeah, I don't care. That was the best. Well gale force winds of ignorance blowing in your face. Don't know how much more time. All right, here we go. Look at you. You're fat. Fuck. I hope you have a fucking heart attack. Oh, I don't know if I would say it was of ignorance.

Speaker 1:          00:32:09       I would say it was more of a mirror that the reason why I do well in front of those drunk moron crowds is because that's basically what I am, what I am. That's who I hung around with. Like, and I don't mean like more and like seriously as I should have done, but you know those guys, when you go to a sporting event, being protective of your audience, don't just the guys who are, who are in your section and that Dick Day are drunk and that kind of scaring people, but they're making this section laugh. Those were the guys kind of guys that I hung out with. Those are the guys when I went to sporting events, I like them. So throughout the years, like it just becomes a part of you and then you do your act and then you attract that. So when, when they're yelling at me, I mean it just feels like, you know, the Boston Garden when they would old days when they would call offsides is some bullshit penalty against the Bruins and all of a sudden you feel like carry Frazier when you're down there.

Speaker 1:          00:32:57       But it's a familiar, more of a uh, uh, a familiar sound. What do you have club owners like you cause your, your crowd drinks. Absolutely. Mine does too. They go, oh, you bring a drinking crowd. No one. They love it. They like that. And then you know what's good too on the late show, if you really want to hook up, uh, the correct one to kiss ass to the comedy club, you tell the club owner and he said, all right, if I go a little bit longer, just put last call. And they love it. They'll push it a little bit, a little bit more. Yeah. You get them that extra round. He gets one extra round going all the way around the room. Do, do 15 minutes to do an hour when you want it to show. Uh, well at this fits theater is different than a club and the club, do you have, uh, if I, if I have an, uh, well I only got one guy in front of me and theaters.

Speaker 1:          00:33:41       If I've got two guys in front of me, I'll do like an hour. If I only have one guy in front, me, I do like an hour and 15. If I have to, if I only have one show, I'll go longer than that. So this, um, this hour that I've, I've written, you know, I kind of was working on a couple of standup skills that I figured out how to do them and then it wouldn't need to figured out how to do something new. Yeah. What Jack Lemmon, dude, come on man. You got to keep getting better. I like it. I liked that one. I liked I was Chang what Jack Lemmon is my guy, Jack Lemmon, 19 boy he did, he did the apartment and he, I think he was nominated for an Oscar. Okay. And that was like in the early sixties and in 19 early nineties when he did Glen Gary, Glen Ross, Jack Lemmon in the early nineties blew away Jack Lemmon and the in the early sixties.

Speaker 1:          00:34:28       And there was that thing where despite the fact that he was where he was at, he kept going in and like I think what, what uh, you got to watch out if you create for a living is when you do fill, you finally fill up a place and to get like, okay, can this license not even, or you just go, okay, this is my bag of tricks. This is what they want me to do. I don't want to divert from this because I might lose this. And uh, then then your creative life becomes like that movie groundhog day. So there was a couple of things I've been working on and what, what they did was they ended up making three minute fits, five minute pits in six minutes. It's nine minutes and I'm not gonna I'll say off the air what it is cause I don't, I don't want pull, you just said you just figured out some new standup thing.

Speaker 1:          00:35:14       Would you say some skills you said? Yeah. You just figured out new standup skills. Yeah. And when you mean is like you've been able to extend bits or what do you mean skills? I'll tell, I'll tell you. Well it's like, I'll compare it to athletics. Okay. Okay. Let's just say you know your, your, uh, you can't go to your left. Oh. So in one summer you just work on going to your left and then everybody in the leagues like, Hey man, he can't go to his left. So they're working on your right. You go to your left, you start scoring more points and it's like, fuck, he's doing this. And the next year, what do you do? You start clamping down on defense and you just keep working, working, working, working at that little subtle things. And, and then hopefully if people are watching your specials close enough, they're seeing the improvement.

Speaker 1:          00:35:57       And I've had people come up to me a few times and said, man, I've noticed some this special, you went from this to this and from this to this one. Like my last special was a transitional one. Um, there was things that I was trying to do in that one that I felt like I almost landed but didn't quite land and now and then those spy continued working on those skills. This is one after Fillmore? Yeah. This is the, um, the fuck was that one called was my last one called you people all the same people. Okay. Um, so that one was a transitional one. All right. Like, um, why do I do this too? To let it go? Was me learning how to do that and then I felt like I got it. I'll let it go. And then this one, the last one.

Speaker 1:          00:36:40       So I'm hoping not to put pressure on myself. Um, um, you know, but this is the, this is, this is like, um, what keeps me going and I'll write it in an hour. It becomes like this, not like this dreaded thing. Like, Oh fuck, how do I come up with another hour? You get excited. You're like, I'm going to go left. Yeah. I'm, I'm going to work on this thing that I suck at. So you feel like when you're going down they, even though your strips traveling, I just had to say it. I can't imagine what you think you suck at and no one else would think that. It's because I've learned over the years how to be struggling and make it look like I'm not, I'm not even bullshitting too. Like there's, there's, yeah, there's, there's all these fucking tricks, which I would tell the fans, but it would ruin them watching.

Speaker 1:          00:37:26       Sure. Like I'm not going to say what I'm working on. Oh, I don't want to them. Because then they stop listening and laughing. They start watching like, oh, that's the thing he's working on. Is he sweating? Does he look comfortable? So you know off air, I can do it. I know, I know. I can't figure you out anyway. To me it's all a dream, so I'm just like watching this thing. I don't know how, how you put it together. Then when you write, you write every day. No you don't. I don't. Right. Do you try and write all Tony v a long time ago, a comic out of Boston. I did this movie, the heat with him, he was in not the Brotherhood on showtime for some fucking reason. They left me hanging after the second season. It's still kills me. Um, you should definitely watch it, but it's such a buzz kill to get to the end.

Speaker 1:          00:38:05       Like they set this whole is based on the bolt yours. Yeah, White Whitey. And that was his other brother's name there, uh, Billy Ball jar. And it was literally the biggest gangster in the biggest like politician. And when you're like yt bolt, you're literally won the lottery. He won the fucking lottery. And, and uh, I don't know. The depart is based, but basically it was, guys are still so powerful that I heard that when they did this, uh, they made this movie, they switched from Boston, this series. I'm sorry. They moved it down to providence. So it was based on that relationship. We had one guy was, one brother was a politician and the other brother was a gangster and I absolutely fucking love the show. Anyways, Tony Memory was in that show. Yes. And Tony Vee was in it. And, um, like Tony Tony was the first guy, first comedian Tony view was the first comedian that I met, also another cigar smoker.

Speaker 1:          00:38:53       Um, so I love running into him. He was the first comedian that I met that did not write down any material really. And it blew my mind. And I was just like, and I was like, so how do you, how do you write? And he goes, well, I go up on stage, I just start talking about it. And I just asked him like two or three questions that he asked. I asked a bunch, but two or three there, I remembered the other one was, well, what do you do when you forget a joke? What about this great bit? Your hand, you and you just forget to do it? And he goes, well, that just means it's time to stop doing it. And through listening to guys like him and then starting off with a guy like Patrice O'Neil, rest his soul, who's the best comic ever saw.

Speaker 1:          00:39:37       Um, and he, he, he naturally knew that from day one, like Patrice, you still like he used to write in the shower and he used to joke him and Dan Cook. Dean was another one. Dan was another guy. He said I, I would think of shit in the shower. And they were joking one night to each other saying, because when you're in the shower, the water going over your head. Sounds like an applause break. Oh, that's so everything. It's all ego. So everything, no, they were joking, but say it just sounded like, you know, like you are killing on stage. So I I, that's interesting. I will tell you the best bit I've ever written was in the shower. Are you joking? He's not joking at all. Yeah, I'm not joking at all. It came to me, the shower. Yeah. I used to think as shit when I was in New York, I used to, when I used to walk, I used to walk around the city talking to myself at night after I did shows and that's when I came up with stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:40:24       And I used to be that guy. You need to, I need to write. And I would sit down with my notebook is before fucking laptops and shit. I'd sit down with the thing right. Or at least when laptops, we had like 40 pounds and then I would, um, and I just, one day it just dawned on me like I think a shit when I walk around. So I would just start going for walks, uh, in New York and go walk around New York at night. I mean, it's obviously a dangerous thing, but it's also a great thing. Um, you just, you just see the city in a different way and uh, you just start, it just, you start connecting stuff and then there becomes this thing where you can't write it down cause you're there and then, you know, cause you're not right cause you're walking around.

Speaker 1:          00:41:03       Um, and so, and then when you get down to the comedy club, if you can't fucking remember it, that it was worth you, you gotta let go of it. You have to, you have to, you've got to just think back when you were in high school and you will making kids laugh. He didn't have a fucking routine. You came to school every day and you improv. And if something funny happened to you, oh, on the weekend, you didn't rehearse it, you didn't do, you didn't go to a buck 20 other fucking high school cafeterias and try it out and then go out there. Hey guys, I love that I a wacky weekend. She just did it. You did it and you acted it out and you imitated people. Maybe you stood up and you just did all this shit because you are comfortable. Yeah. So it's, it's really, it gets you to that level of comfortableness that you had with, with your friends.

Speaker 1:          00:41:48       Yeah. So that's what, what you try to work towards where you're as comfortable offstage as you are on stage. And then you don't have to necessarily, like, I'm not gonna lie to you, man, if I come up with, write a line or I'll write a word, I usually do a word right. Like, like for this, this thing tonight, like, I'm gonna go fuck around with this thing tonight. I don't, I kind of know what I'm going to say. Um, where are you going up tonight? I'm going to go up, down to the comedy store. You go up how many times a week and when you're on tour? Yeah. Well, because it's like going to the gym if you don't, I don't want people coming out on tour to see me and see like three shows where I'm at. Can, he's shaking the rest of them.

Speaker 1:          00:42:25       That's not fair to them. And that's also a major, uh, uh, fuck over of yourself because they're not gonna, they're not gonna come see you again and they shouldn't. We went on a double date one night with bill and his now wife and uh, so we go out to dinner and didn't have plans for later and were like, oh, we're just going to go see a movie. Couple of this. It's a Saturday night. And Bill's like, Nah, I'm going to go do a set. And I was blown away. I was like, what? You don't have any really? That was amazing to me. Yeah. I just meant to me, it's like, wow, you're never going to get there kicking her whatnot. Well you also have you, you got like how many kids? You have like 19 five kids, but we were just going out I guess.

Speaker 1:          00:43:07       I see. Yeah. I need to go out. Well why we think the, although the amount of material that's at home but people don't want to hear about your kids. Yeah, they do. Yeah, they do. Guys come up to me go eh, too much kid stuff and I respect that because Ah, some drunk in Atlanta. Oh there you go. You know, I got to tell you where I've gotten in my business in this show, businesses, I, I've, I've based it all on some drunk guy in Atlanta. Oh. Like, like his, because I think that too is like, I wouldn't want to just sit around and just hear about your kids all night. When I used to watch Carson Cosby himself, fine. Is it, I have that. It's like a fucking hour and a half special. I put that right up there with, with Richard Pryor, the one he did out on long beach and with the red shirt I, those are the two best specials I, I've seen as far as like, you know, just totally freeform saying, you know, using all, we'll call the language and then work in clay.

Speaker 1:          00:44:02       That's, that's to me that is the whole comedy rainbow as far as working totally clean. A little bill says, Bill Cosby says a asshole one time. Big Deal. But like that is basically him talking about his family. And I saw that when I was like, I think 14, 13 when it first came out and I loved it. I watched it a zillion times. Okay. And uh, I'd say is a great, is a great standup thing to do. I did it accidentally on an airplane. Somebody next to me was watching bill Cosby himself and I couldn't hear the audio, watch it with the sound down. He's fucking unbelievable. Like you think he's just sitting there killing you don't realize all the shit he's doing because when he's taught, when you hear that voice and that thing that what he does, I mean that guy is and, and, and this is like the, and this was him like like 30 years ago.

Speaker 1:          00:44:49       Right. But he's got just a little, he had a whole attitude and just one eyebrow raise. Yeah, no. Did you ever see that? The Seinfeld documentary? Yeah. This is really getting comedy nerd here, but I thought, but people like, did you ever see the Seinfeld documentary comedian, comedian? Just so you know, Bill was hold a clutching, uh, the micro Mike Sand. He was likely to remember the name of it. He was holding the microphone stand. He was holding the cover of the DVD was, I am known for night. Okay. Remember what did I say earlier when I was trying to say, I know what you did last summer. I said, no, he did last Sunday. I'm the worst with those. Terrible. So my favorite part in that movie is when Seinfeld goes to meet bill Cosby and you see this guy, you see Seinfeld, first of all, he turns into like a little kid, you know, like you just see him hanging on his every word and caused me does this quick little thing where he talks about, I forget what it's something about like drying the crowd in are gone.

Speaker 1:          00:45:46       It just makes us, he makes this little movement with his face and either he the lean forward or came back and I was in the movie theater in my seat and I leaned forward to the scroll. I was just like, this guy is a Ninja. Like he's unbelievable. So getting back to what you said when you're going, like, you know, you're still working on stuff. I mean, I am like that guy, you know, I just got off the ground. Like that guy is in like, he's like fucking out there with those, uh, those cell phones, satellite fucking things going around the handles. Like so, um, and I think that there's so many unbelievably talented people out there and, uh, that you get sucked into doing other things like writing scripts and that type of stuff, which I'm not saying it's a bad thing, right? But there's just something about standup comedy that I like.

Speaker 1:          00:46:35       That's where all my goals like. So, uh, yeah. So I, I keep working on that and then any acting work I get, I just considered it as a, as a bonus. It should be in fan fence for years. You've promised me yes, that's, you are going to hook me up in all your movies. I was putting your hours, the guy and he said, listen, I'm doing this little stock car movie called uh, Talladega Nights. We didn't know each other. How do you, how do you look in a virus? Know each other then? And I, and I, I cried when that movie came out and you didn't put me in it. Okay. Well I taught year old virgin, by the way, when we did pay in that barrel, are well aware of you and they love you. Didn't put me in. Just so you know. And you take it, you fucking take this case said, yeah, Bill Burr might be the best out there right now.

Speaker 1:          00:47:17       So take it. Oh, he says he's too busy editing movies. Nope. He gets it. He knows a feral knows. They know. All right. Listen, this is about you, my friend. Let's stop with this. What I want to talk about is you. So there you go. That's of me. Well, have you seen, have you heard about Sherry's berries? I'll give them a shoutout. She did. They're chocolate covered strawberries. I do it. Yeah, for Christmas. Yeah. Kind of lost my shit when I was, I was trying to read because there's copy was, I couldn't figure out if it was homoerotic or homophobic. It just kept going. One, you know, you should see the size of our berries. So that was like homoerotic and then you get to their phone number and it was like call eight, six, six fruit. What? Fruit? It's like a homophobic, damn. It was just, it was fucking, he reminded me of that sketch.

Speaker 1:          00:48:07       Remember that? That Alec Baldwin, that's Schwetz what it all still, it was literally like, I thought it was a joke. So, and plus I was, I was jet lagged or whatever. So, uh, I think I, I'm going to see what that, when that one comes in, I'll see how many, I think I sold a lot. Yeah. Just by acting like Sherry, Sherry's berries. So I gave him, I gave him a free plug back. That's good. So, uh, yeah, what King Bucket, I'm going to go into press junket here. What can people look forward to seeing here with the new anchorman or not? I don't want to get away in India. Okay. And here's the deal. You've seen it yet? No, because I'm trying, I'm trying to, we can all, I'm trying to coordinate with like five people where we are the biggest anchorman nerds. That's awesome. And it's like I want to go with all of them.

Speaker 1:          00:48:53       I want to go during the day so there's not a, I want to be able to hear every joke and I personally, I want to see it a good three times before I buy it on laserdisc DVD. And all that. Dude, when we were doing that, when you saw us in Atlanta, we had, we, we wants to watch the movie like five fucking times. It's like our, uh, what's that? Mr. Smith goes to Washington. That's like our movie was me. Uh, Jason La had the duty hugged and Paul Versey, my buddy, uh, from New York, you got to meet him at great guy and a, um, a hilarious guy and we would just, we would just pop that thing in. Um, and it's just a good joke. Oh, that's not the second they get, you know, made Frank Sinatra look like a Hobo Nike. And we ended up in, in, in our pajamas watching him.

Speaker 1:          00:49:36       So I'm so fucking excited to see this movie. I'm so happy for you guys that, that they able, I remember asking for years on my planet the fuck are they doing another one? You were like, I'm going to be going, like, this script is written, the script is written and what, what, what is it? Because everybody download stuff now. Like why, why did it take so long? Oh No. Uh, for a couple of reasons. First of all, cause Adam and we'll weren't keen on doing sequels. Okay, I hear stand that and then the movie wasn't a hit. It only made 85 million domestically is a modest hit so that there was no demand from the studio. Like let's get more money. Well it made 85 box office, which is not huge. You know, it hits $100 million. Then you're like, okay, let's make another hundred million dollars cost to make that one costs 24 million.

Speaker 1:          00:50:18       And then you, they figure they've spent uh, 20 million of market. So that's 46 million. All right, let's, let's, let's, let's bring it to regular people. Regular people numbers. If somebody put 240 bucks yeah, down at the track and then they left with 850 bucks, they'd be pretty psyched. Right? They'd be buying drugs for people. But I would definitely say, hey, let's do this again. I liked the problem is they put down how much? 240 bucks, put it at 240 bucks. Then you made 241 that was more like it because what you only get half the revenue from the, from the uh, uh, you also spent, you put $48 down or have sold $44. That's $24 million to make the movie. Then grosses. Yes. Then $20 million to, to advertise the movie, not, it's $46 million you spent on this movie. Now the movie makes $85 million at box office. The student gets half of that.

Speaker 1:          00:51:13       Okay, so there's still in the, in the red, he still walked with 200 bucks, right? 200 bucks. Well, 200 and your world is 20 million. No, no, no that, none of that. They get half of the 85. So they only made 40, 42 43. So they're actually is only making 43 million backers. Then you broke even. That's all they did all with you have Italia. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You spent $20 million in advertising prints and advertising. So the real cost of the movie was $46 million or $44 million. So that wasn't, they didn't get a huge profit. So do you really just have to be a crook to somehow get over the bar? We'll know what happens. Is that making you money? If you, if you make a, if they make $100 million now they've made $25 million and a happy, so they are just looking to make their 25 million. Yeah, it's all a business.

Speaker 1:          00:52:01       Okay. Nobody cares about if it's good or not. Did I make money and I blame them? They're in a business. So I've always said that. What happened later then was DVD sales and cable reruns. It became a hugely popular movie and after about six years ago, it became this thing like wow, something's going on with this. When you saw the tee shirts and the quoting everywhere in pop culture, it went away. Now who got the money on that? Oh, paramount. So their property also, they made all the weight. So the guys, the guys that you're talking about didn't make any money. You're saying that's paramount. Didn't initially as part. Okay. Okay. All right. So then it was clearly there's something here. Then people were like, anytime I'd go on a press junket or Steve or will or Paul, they don't know how you're moving. What about anchorman two?

Speaker 1:          00:52:46       It became this cult phenomenon, which can became a pop culture phenomenon. I was like, you couldn't ignore, there's a big thirst for this picture. And then the studio picked up on it and then whatever it was two years ago, they weren't planning on doing it, but then they had something fall out of their schedule. And so Adam and we'll approach them again. They said, yeah, let's do it. Then there was a little haggling over the budget and then, uh, because they, so did you get to the fore? You ever get on the phone if there's as possible for way phone call? Was there any like, no, there was no hesitation. Kitty, can you fucking believe we're doing this? That only happened when we all met together in Atlanta when we were shooting the first, uh, last week of February one start to interview or this is what I should got to what?

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       So what, what was that stuff? We'll have to wait. They've got to fucking enjoyed bill burr. What, what, what is, so what was that like when you guys, you got the band back together? No, before that we got together to shoot that little teaser, a commercial, uh, after we'll had announced it on cone on county again with the flute. That was awesome. That was awesome. We met and did that teaser trailer, right. You know, coming in a year and a half your too. But that, that was so early. It was, but we did that so that they couldn't pull the plug. There's like, there's no way they can go back and we're going to announce that he announced it there. Now we're going to do this teaser. So here we go. So that was an offensive move. That wasn't like the studio going, hey, go put on your costume.

Speaker 1:          00:54:02       He was like, no, we've got to make sure that they're going to do, let's put one out. Let's, let's keep goosing this thing. And uh, but I'm sure pair my paid for that. So they were new, but we'll make the announcement so there's no going back. So the first day you were in Atlanta and you're shooting and the first day you go down, it's in a scene involves shooting off for you and your on. The first day that we got together was a day where we recorded some stuff in a um, looking at a picture here somewhere, recorded some stuff with the studio cause there's a song in the movie, there's a song we recorded for the movie that didn't make the movie, which is going to be out on DVD later. I'm such a big fan of actually downloaded the music already. No, I downloaded like what was that song off the first one?

Speaker 1:          00:54:41       Uh, afternoon. Oh yeah, yeah. Brandy. No. From San Francisco. What does nameless, I'll roll enough. The ships and here's what they had to say. Ride cab. I kept my head upon your mystery ship. We playing that on the bus man. After we finish clinic a Gig, the next morning we wake up, we start cranking that. I don't know why I took six years off this, this phone. I had a picture of us the first day we got together. Recorded. It was, it was nine years later. It was amazing. I'm sorry I can't find it, but you know Adam and, and Judd and a will, Paul, Steve and Christina and myself. And that was, that was like, wow, here it is again. That's nice. Finally, when it was getting at the first time, you guys were actually, we were dressed up in character and you at the cowboy the day that we shot that little teaser of does that thing where he doesn't move his arms straight down.

Speaker 1:          00:55:35       Right. That blew me away when I, when, when you let me come down that day, uh, just let people know I was doing a Gig in Atlanta. Right. And somehow you knew I was there and you say, hey, you want to come down to, I knew you were coming to Atlanta to do, do a show. Right. And you have to be in town that night too. That was unreal. We went down there, the set visit. So we go to, I'll tell it starts. So we go down to a t to the anchorman set and, and we're, we're sitting at already smiling going like, what the fuck is this going to be like? We don't, you know, we were ready to be like quiet like church mouse. It's like we'd go down there like, just don't get in the way. You don't piss anybody off. Don't step on any cable.

Speaker 1:          00:56:11       And we go down there and uh, and the first one we go to meet, we go up to your trailer and they knock on the door and you knew it was us in, in and Dave, you know, you fucking Barstow open the door and you start going like he's gesturing towards me the whole time. It's me and Jason Santana. He just goes, the man, the myth, the shouting across the parking lot, the legend. You'd had all these things and you start walking towards me like you're going to give me this big bear hug. And at the last second as I reached out to hug you, you make it, you, you've cut a hard right and just give a big bear hug to my buddy. Jason, you left me hugging air. I had fell for like one of the oldest comedy tricks in the book. Yeah. And then you give Jason this big bear hug, like he went to war bearings your face and his neck and he's laughing his ass off.

Speaker 1:          00:56:58       And then that was it. And then we started walking down to the set and then Paul Rudd comes out of the trailer, pulls a big fan of yours, totally dressed as Brian Fantana the whole fucking get up. But he's talking like him. He's like, oh hey man, what's going on? And I'm fucking saying hi. Like I was trying not to be that. And we went down to the set and that's what killed me when I went down there was the scene involved. All you guys, and I got to see you guys talking before. And then the second day you guys are getting ready. All of your body language changed. And you became those guys. You know, like when I say Steve Kerr, I was like, you know, talking. And then all of a sudden his arms just go straight down. And we were sitting there like, he's fucking brick, right?

Speaker 1:          00:57:34       He's being pro now, you know, and, and, uh, we'll was signing off doing something and he did some little, like that little pound on the desk, like he had done a good job, you know, like little that just the way I just, which was unlike any of the other characters that he's done. So just as a comedian, just watching that, that skill level, uh, uh, as, as an actor was just, it was, it was fun. And I gotta tell you when we, when we left, um, oh, and well was great. He's totally stayed in character and trashed. Jason. Um, I forget what he said. He just said, Oh yes, I've heard wonderful things about your talking to me and you're getting just points at Jason, but you just a litany of horrible, just one of those whole thing. And so we ended up, I'm smiling now.

Speaker 1:          00:58:15       We got an, we got into the cab and went back and we shot there just like ear to ear fucking grins. The whole I'm telling you to do. That was one of the coolest, uh, coolest fucking thing that's ever happened. So I, I'm so beyond sight that this, this thing's coming out. So, uh, how, how many days did it take you to shoot it? I think there were 55 days on this one and there were 45 class. And that is that relatively quick for something like that? A quick normal, normal. There's normal, uh, it's, you know, relative to budget you want 60 or something like that I think is 55. Um, the first one was 45 days, which was a long one for that kind of budget. It was all here in town. Um, so yeah. Oh you shot that first one here? Well yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:58:57       Is here and there like one or two days in San Pedro and then uh, or Piedro depending where you're from. And then I think they just did some exteriors in San Diego cause all the San Diego thinks it was shot there. Right, right, right. But it wasn't exactly exterior's only was the Jack Black scene, but it pumps the dial. Nope. When was that? That he was here somewhere. Some bridge, some bridge in La.
