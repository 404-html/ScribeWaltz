Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burr and it's the Monday morning podcast from Monday. Fuck in my day. Uh, September 23rd, 2030. What's going on? What's going on dog? What's up? See The fucking patch. You know, you didn't think they were that good. You're fucking three and oh now, now what do you think? So mmm, more on that later. I am a back in the continental United States. I just did a two wonderful shows up in Toronto, Ontario. It's the first time I've been up to Canada in a while. Had a great time. And uh, right before that I was in Pittsburgh. Had a lovely time there. Thanks to all the guys that uh, DVE Randy Bauman, uh, Bill Crawford, opening it up, killing, killing, killing it, the kick the Hines hall. And then before that I was down there. But uh, in West Virginia, another beautiful state did everybody shits all over. I'm telling you I'm going to retire and one of those fucking states, that is my game plan. The game plan is I'm going to somehow get these fucking banker counts off of me going to pay off this God damn house and then, you know, when I'm too fucking old hill, my hair's all white or yellow, whatever it happens to fucking red hair. And on top I got those freckles old age spots and my bald head, I'm just gonna fuck. Oh yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:01:40       And I'm going to sell this place and I will move to like, I dunno, West Virginia. Uh, I'd moved to Iowa, but like what the fuck? No, no, that was good. That was great. I really understand that topography now of Iowa with that vivid description. Thank you. I'm over here in Wales, England. Now I understand exactly what Iowa looks like. I'm sorry. I maybe will the, the Dakotas something along those lines. Um, I just going to move to the middle of fucking nowhere and by then maybe I'll have a pilot's license and I can go out like John Denver and I had just picked it. That would be a, a B, a w a lovely life. It would be a lovely life. Um, no, I have actually, you know, just been driving around seeing all the different parts of the country here. Man. I, I'm getting back into drive and does stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:02:37       In fact, by the way, last week I got a brutal email from somebody telling me what a piece of shit I am and all this type of stuff cause I had to cancel my Gig and El Paso and it's like I didn't cancel the fucking thing. It rained. And that's not my fault that you guys don't have a sewer system or whatever the fuck it is out there in El Paso. And I told you that I would rescore I fucking flew out there. I was sitting there, I had my show shirt, all iron. I was ready to go. But as promised I said we will reschedule the El Paso date as soon as possible. And I am a man of my fucking word. The El Paso date, the new date is October 2nd. All right. And instead of dude, I call it Versie. Uh, I'm actually bringing Rosebowl legend tailgate legend, Mr. Joe Barton.

Speaker 1:          00:03:34       Nick, everybody. Okay. A man who honed his skills in the San Francisco San Francisco scene, man. And uh, that's, that's a Wednesday. That's a great run. Wednesday is a, is El Paso. Thursday the third is a San Jose. Friday the fourth to Seattle. And then the 5th of October is a, I'm back down in Phoenix. And uh, so anyways, so if you, if you bought tickets already for El Paso, those things are totally honored. If you can't make October 2nd, your, your money will be refunded any more than that. I, there's nothing else I can, I can't control the fucking weather. So, um, anyways, I've been getting a have against slammed lately. There was some people in Seattle did not take kindly to my fucking by song that I sang Lexi. I get called like a faggot like 58 times on Twitter this week.

Speaker 1:          00:04:40       Um, yeah, people did not appreciate that song, although they did not refute it. No one ever said they didn't go out of their way to architecturally in awake, architecturally designed. How else would you do with bill? Huh? I also need to do it. I'm trying to think of another big word, but I don't have what I know I was gonna say geometrically what you probably need geometry and geometry for that shit. That's not a good one. Uh, peanut butter and Jelly Ectera t way and a fucking, anyways, you know what I love about then a couple, I guess a couple of people just wrote some of the blurb that I wrote to piss off all the Seahawk fans. Um, and uh, they left out the whole part where I set all the complimentary stuff and how they got a great team and how when I watched the Patriots play and then I see, you know, Seattle of Frisco Colts or whatever, watch those games. How it just looks like football on a whole other level and how Seattle has a great chance at winning the Superbowl and how I don't blame fucking Pete Carroll for what the fuck he did at USC because everybody does it yet all of that shit gets left out. Only thing that they had in there was we was me going, we someday people of Seattle fans of the Seattle Seahawks as mad as you are, that you have to use those homophobic slurs in your advanced city man.

Speaker 2:          00:06:06       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:06:08       You'll, you'll, you'll, you'll understand it one of these days, one of these days when you actually have something shiny and Yep. Cupboard until now, you're just screaming. That's all you're doing. And you know, that's another reason why you guys are so loud because of how empty your trophy cases, it causes an x

Speaker 2:          00:06:28       go.

Speaker 1:          00:06:33       You guys came into the League in 1977 along with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. And even those sad conch figured out a fucking way to win one by now. All right? So even if you have finally when one this year, I got two words for you. It's about fucking time. All right? And if you can't do the math on that, yeah, I'm just fucking around. All right. You Shit. Birds Relax. I'll be up there on the fourth. Do whatever the fuck you want. Boomi. I don't give a shit. They give me the check already. All right. It's actually not true, but I'm gonna act like it is. So anyways, plowing ahead here. Um, yeah, I was up in Toronto. One of the great things about going up to Canada aside from the fact that hockey is the first story, you know when it comes to sports, that's the big thing that's going on.

Speaker 1:          00:07:22       I watched like hockey night in Canada. I came home and I watched the replay, the shown preseason hockey up there. Like it's fucking march. Okay. And they're trying to figure out who's going to make the playoffs. Playoffs and a somebody actually uh, I watched a little bit of the Toronto Buffalo Games. Some of the a replay. No, no, I watched Edmonton. Vancouver. That's what I was watching. Somebody just sent me a link. Did this great broth. Um, I'll, I'll give you guys a video of it and, and all you guys who don't like hockey, just spare me your stupid great sport. What are they? Let him fight. This is a sport. This, I gotta be honest with you guys. That's music to my ears. I liked the people don't understand hockey that you can't see the puck for whatever fucking reason. I love it. I love it. Keep, keep pilot on and watching football and go down to your sports bar with your man tits and you're fucking football jersey.

Speaker 1:          00:08:15       I'm all about it. By all means. I'll sit over in the quiet part of the bar watching a hockey game. Same without you and your fucking Cheetos breath invading my shoulder area near my notes. You know, you shoulders, knee. And that was right. I was thinking, looking over my shoulder out, whatever. I don't need to explain my body parts. Do you people? All right. Um, so anyways, whatever. Two guys on the, one guy on Toronto, one Guy Buffalo, they get into a fight and the guy at Buffalo, his helmet comes off and uh, he fucking ended up whacking his head on the ice. And I guess buffalo took an exception to that. So this fucking big goof, Scott is big goof. That could beat the living shit out of me, but I'm safe here in the podcast. So I'll call him a goof knowing nothing about him.

Speaker 1:          00:09:03       I'm sure he's a wonderful well spoken human being, but he looked like a big goof cause he's standing next to Phil Kessel. Phil Kessel comes up to like, I dunno, maybe his hockey pants is a little short. Shorts is little sat in booty shorts, cities wherein Edd, I decided to take it out on him. He takes a swing at little folk castle. Little felt ever heard anybody just trying to score a goal. Some assess doesn't even go on the corner. He's not hurting anybody and I don't. I did. Phil Kessel lost his fucking Shit. I have a whole new found respect for that guy. This big dude punched him. So one of the other fucking maple leaf guys immediately grabbed Scott. If Phil castled takes a two hander, not once but twice to the back of Scott's like nine old lot of you guys go, well what the fuck?

Speaker 1:          00:09:51       He's tied up with somebody else. That's a cheap shot. Fuck you. All right. When you're two feet taller than a guy, when you have to punch down at the top of somebody's head at that point, you might want to pick a different dance partner. Right. But he didn't, so he fucking whacks him twice and then squares off with another guy in the sabers and actually wins the fight. Bloodies the guy up. They stop and then kessels he's going to skate off the ice. That big dude Scott is still tied up with somebody went over and he fucking spirit of trying to take out the guy's spleen. I was like, good for him. There you go. That's, that's good. Phil. You don't take no shit off. Nobody. He went all spider on. Why don't you go fuck yourself Tommy. It was great. It was great to see.

Speaker 1:          00:10:36       And um, I think the leafs, hopefully, I think they're going to be good this year. I like the leafs. I've always liked him. Um, and speaking of that, oh yeah, we're going to talk hockey here in September. And somebody sent me an, an article, uh, that said, um, you know, the, you know, you always got to have some sort of controversial title just to get people to read it. It says Montreal Canadians, the most overrated franchise in Nhl history. And they basically touched on some shit that I had brought it up, brightened that I had brought up, um, you know, through, of course not reading, just overhearing shit that saying that, you know, the Canadians dominated as 16 league and that they had first pick at all French born Canadian players, Yada, Yada, Yada. All of that. This is a really cool article because it actually explains that more and it makes me understand, but it makes me understand Montreal, Toronto better.

Speaker 1:          00:11:32       Um, so this is the points the guy's making. I don't, I don't agree with all of this stuff, but it says the original six teams, uh, carries an aura with them. Uh, the Montreal Canadian Baba, you know, the 60s all did battle each other. Um, so basically you had a 16.6, 7% chance of winning. So of course everybody's gonna argue. Well, so did the Bruins. So did the Black Hawks or the Redwings. So did everybody else. But here, here's the thing that's really interesting about this, unless you're not into a hockey then I, I don't know what to tell you is um, ah Christ, I don't even have it here with a fuck. Is it

Speaker 1:          00:12:10       basically this, this is how it work. Work Do, you couldn't like sign anybody back in the day. So the Canadians did not have first chance at all French born Canadian players. What they had back there was something I guess called the c form, which if you went out, you scouted people they had to sign if they signed it, that was an Iou that they were going to go and play for you. So Montreal was smart enough to go all over Canada. I try and sign these people like right before they turned 18 or right as they turned 18. But the big thing was was you had first chance at all players within basically a 50 mile radius of your city. This is really interesting. I never knew this. You had first chance at that. So, um,

Speaker 3:          00:12:56       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:57       Basically why that kind of tipped the scales was Montreal and Toronto had first chance at everybody and basically, you know, Quebec and Ontario where everybody's hockey crazy and comes out of the womb skating. And then you look at like the Bruins and we had first chance at trying to find a rocket Rashard in like New Hampshire or the, as they say here, the rangers trying to find the next best goalie in Newark, new or Hoboken, New Jersey. And it's really interesting because what he fails to bring up in this article was that Montreal didn't dominate a 16 league, um, both Montreal and Toronto up until 1967. The year of expansion. At that point, Montreal had 14 cups and uh, and, and the, the, uh, the maple leafs had 13. So the two of them, just by being up in Canada, I'm being around all of that talent and the fact that you only get to 16 fucking league, they bill, they were able to go on a run. But, um,

Speaker 1:          00:14:04       you know, and I wonder if that helped Detroit too because Detroit, they're 50 mile radius would actually get them into a Ontario a little bit where people gave a shit and love talky. But it was a really interesting article and I'm not sure here to shit on the Canadians, God knows I do that enough. But that very clarified misinformation that I was putting out there that that, I mean I was, I was looking at it like everything east of Montreal, they owned, you had to go play for the Canadians that I was like, what the fuck that be like if he had a whole all of new England or whatever to draft for a particular sport or something like that. So my apologies, you won't hear this often to the Montreal Canadiens franchise. I was wrong about that. And now I now understand why Montreal and Toronto, what kind of going tit for tat with that 50 mile radius thing was really interesting.

Speaker 1:          00:14:51       At the end of the day though, that thing that Montreal was going around trying to find all of this town, they did do the work. So you kinda got to give it up from on a on that level. So there you go. Look at that apologizing to the Canadians. But I'll have a link to that if you want to read it. If you're a sports nerd like me. Um, it's a great article all the way through. I wouldn't say that Montreal is overrated, but I was disappointed that the uh, that the writer of the article did not bring up the Toronto Maple leafs in why they were able to kind of go, you know, strive for strive there with the Canadians up till 67 it was basically in the 70s I think. Right. That's when the Canadians, they one six and they also want what they want and 68 and 69 I can't remember now. Yeah, I think they want 68 69 then broadens one's 70 than Montreal. [inaudible] 71 [inaudible] 72 then Montreal flyers, flyers, and then Montreal for the rest of the decade. That's how it went. All right. Jesus Christ is there one woman left listening to this podcast and with that, let's do some advertising. Great timing bill. Great timing. I get the fucking calendar out of the way here. Um, either way, hockey's coming back. I'm really excited about it. Oh, you know, when I was in Pittsburgh, um,

Speaker 1:          00:16:11       what the fuck was I just going to tell you? I was hanging out with uh, uh, Randy from DV and a bill Crawford and you know, they know Paula Steigerwald to help him saying his name right. Stagger walls. I always fuck up the pronunciations of anybody's last name if it has more than two syllables, but it was just so insane. They brought him along and uh, we kind of, you know, talked right after the, after the show and I've watched so much center rice just to hear his voice was insane. It just kept saying that till going like, dude, like this. It was be hilarious. He would start talking to me just talking about regular stuff. Paul Wood and I, everything I did could do to not start looking around for the hockey game on TV. Cause I felt like I was listening to like, Oh shit, there's a hockey game on.

Speaker 1:          00:17:02       I've just, I've, I basically, I've watched a ton of penguins games is what I'm trying to say. So, uh, that was a big thrill getting to hang out with him. But, um, anyway, so let's get to the, uh, let's get to the Goddamn, uh, where is it here? Let's get to the advertising for this week. All right, everybody.

All right. Continuing on. So this past week, everybody, um, I actually rented a motorcycle and live to tell about it. Um, I rented during a weekday, right? And I, uh, I just went to a party where I knew there was going to be no cars or anything like that and it was all these twists and turns in that type of thing. And it was, you know, it's just like was fun, man. It was a lot of fun, scraped the pegs a couple of times, scared the shit out of me. I didn't realize that they give, you know, so you won't fall down. That was definitely sent a jolt through my head. But um,

Speaker 1:          00:21:12       it was awesome, man.

Speaker 1:          00:21:14       I gotta tell you, I really, uh, I really enjoyed it. I don't know. It's like I said, it's still nothing compared to buy a motorcycle or anything like that. I just wanted to remember what I learned in the, in the, in the class. So I ride with a buddy of mine who's been riding forever and everything went great the entire fucking time. I said I did a great job for the amount of time that I've been riding. You know, I drove stick shifts my whole life. So it's the same concept of hardest things. You have to switch it, you know, with rather than shifting with your hand, you know, you're doing it with the afoot and rather moving the clutch with your foot, you do it with your hand. It's all that type of shit. But that motorcycle safety class that I took, I highly, highly, highly recommend taking one of those because um, they really, they help you with turns. And I mean, like, I like the shit you have to do on a motorcycle. When you go into a turn. It's not like a car, you know, you don't have to worry about a car tipping over

Speaker 1:          00:22:10       and you being launched out of it. Like what you have to do when a car, you'd have to be basically gone, I would think over 35 miles an hour, 40 miles an hour, and then just cut the wheel as hard as you could to the point you were skidding sideways, even just to go it on its side. But even then you're strapped in, you got metal all around you and airbags. Um, so anyways, we wrote,

Speaker 1:          00:22:33       I, I made him go down and pick up the bike. I did it as safely as I could possibly do it, and I had the time of my fucking life. So, and I got the confidence that I actually rode the bike back to my house, uh, before I went to bring it back. And I lived, I live on a, uh, I live on a hill that's on a turn. So I came down and I was just like, oh wait, well how the fuck do I do this? And I went down and I brought it up and I'm thinking like, what do I do with the kickstand? And then I kinda had it at the wrong angle and I swear to God, I tip the bike over at zero miles an hour.

Speaker 4:          00:23:08       Fucking

Speaker 1:          00:23:08       ass all do what I was writing for three hours around turns a whole fucking thing all the way up to fourth gear down shift and looking through the turns, the whole fucking thing did everything right and then it's zero miles an hour. I just was at the wrong angle where if I put the kickstand down, it was still going to tip over. And then I tried to overcompensate and the thing just tipped to the point of no return and you don't really feel the weight of the bike until it gets to that tipping point. I mean, I didn't slam it then I just basically dropped it down. It was so fucking embarrassing. And I bent the, uh, I bent the, uh, the front brake and I put some scratches on the fucking thing. So it ended up being an expensive day fucking asshole. I was so embarrassed.

Speaker 1:          00:24:01       It was a Harley too, so I brought it back down to the place and they're all, you know, they like, Nah, it happens, it happens or whatever. But I just, you know, I could not, if I should have just gone down there a little skirt with what's left of my hair in pigtails, they'd be like, Oh God, I tried to do is put the kickstand down. I was really, it's been a while since I've been that fucking embarrassed. Like I was, uh, I felt shame, but other than that, it was a great time. I was Billy bad ass for about a, I don't know, for a couple of hours and then, uh, I dunno, whatever the biggest pussy word you can come up with. The begins with B Billy blueberries and a fucking dumb. Anyways, white blueberries are bad. And if you stick them in a pie, I had the urge to make a pumpkin pie this week.

Speaker 1:          00:24:51       I want to practice before the holidays. Um, and I want to smoke a fucking Turkey this year. I'm throwing fucking down. You know, that's one of the things when the holidays come around, you've got to have something that you make, you know, you gotta have your staple and if you don't, you got to have some sort of hooch that you get from somewhere in the middle of fucking nowhere that you got to have something special. You just can't hit be another client that puts on some ugly sweater and just shows up and stands there, eat and everybody else's shit, drinking all their fucking booze. You know, you got to bring something with you. I think you know what they should, you should do. You should have like basically you should have a pre Thanksgiving party in the beginning of October, like a preseason game and then you invite like 30 people over knowing only 22 are going to make the fucking roster on thanksgiving.

Speaker 1:          00:25:48       But don't tell anybody. No, that's not fair for people. Trial for a team. They know they're trying out for a team to do that. There you go. Then you fucking where one those bill Bellacheck cutoff hoodies and you see what people show up with. Just a suggestion. No big deal. Um, all right, let's continue with the sports. Um, people have been firing off letters to me lately and uh, I never sent letters to people. I never do. I never like I'll read something and somebody annoys me. And I guess the reason why I don't do it is because I have the outlet of the podcast or doing standup. So I never really feel the need. Like, you know, I gotta I dunno, send this person like a fucking letter or something, but I actually sent a letter, an email, and I'm not going to name the name cause I don't, I don't want you guys to like, I know most of you won't, but some of you will find out who it is and then go you stupid cunt age and you know, the stupid, you know, write something racist that hour, whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:26:50       I just don't want to be a part of that. But basically this person was writing an article about this female goaltender, uh, Briana Scurrey. I hope I said her last name right. And, um, yeah, it was really just awful story. You know, like she was top of her game playing for the u s ladies soccer team, the late nineties. And uh, she went down to get to, to stop a routine, a routine save one of those ones. I think it's from the way it was described as like kind of rolling fast along the ground. She dove down to get it, scooped it up and had it and uh, someone on the other team went to basically try to kick it out of her hand real quick and then try to put it in the goal. But as they will run an over to do that, the other player's knee struck this woman Brianna right on the side of her head.

Speaker 1:          00:27:40       And uh, you know, so she kind of gave herself a standing eight count basically and stood up and continued on like all athletes do. She pushed through the pain. So, unfortunately after a few minutes, the back of our own player's jerseys, when she was looking at the numbers and the names started getting blurry, started getting fuzzy, then she started seeing more than one soccer ball out there and the team could tell that she was struggling. And at, and at the half they took a ride of the game, sound like a familiar story. She had, she had a brutal concussion and ended her career. And now, you know, she has to stay in like, you know, a dark apartment. And um, I don't know if she gets to bed, spins are getting nauseous, but the usual type of stuff. So I'm reading this thing and I was like, Oh God, another concussion stories. It's just, I didn't, you know, I haven't heard a lot of soccer players having this happened to him, you know, male or female. Um, so it was really an interesting article. And then all of a sudden, I don't know where this person writes. You know, it's one of the myths of the mainstream sports media that concussions belong only to men. Most of them football players like,

Speaker 3:          00:28:46       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:28:47       I don't even, I can't even wrap my head around that statement. It's like, I want to just, let me just continue reading this. In fact, studies show that women and girls are more likely than men and boys to suffer concussions in sports. They both play such as soccer, basketball and baseball, slash, softball. And in those cases they are also more likely to suffer and private of far cry from the attention NFL players command. Can you fucking believe that that was one of the most uninformed paragraphs I think I've ever read on. Like after I read that I was like, I don't think this paper USA Today, I don't think that they have a sports editor.

Speaker 1:          00:29:35       I don't even know where to begin with that. First of all, to make concussions like a gender issue. Like I'm not the smartest guy, but don't we both just have brains that sit in fluid in your head. A blow to the head is a blow to the head. So I don't know what she's trying to claim. And I, my, one of my favorite statements of all time studies show no footnote to the study studies show researchers have said, um, oh my God. So I actually, I, I, I'm not going to bore you and maybe I will, you want me to read the letter that I sent her? I, I wrote no disrespect because I wanted her to read, you know, get something to call their attention. I basically said to suggest that female athletes are more likely to suffer in private, a far cry from the attention NFL players command when it comes to suffering.

Speaker 1:          00:30:33       Concussions is astoundingly uninformed. The attention that NFL players command, I kept putting that in quotes. She made him sound like they would divas. Um, the attention NFL players command has everything to do with generations of former NFL players suffering and private after their careers were over in the last five years alone. Three NFL players have committed suicide by single gunshot to the chest in order to preserve their brains. The scientists can figure out more about the aftermath of playing professional football. The attention players command today was the result of over two decades of fighting tooth and nail with NFL owners. In the end, the only reason the owners gave in was the irrefutable evidence gained through examination of brains donated by dead NFL players that's suffered in private and then it brought up the class action suit, but blah, blah blah, blah blah. Um, Brian Scurry was taken out of that ramp.

Speaker 1:          00:31:25       Ryan, Briana Scurrey, sorry, was taken out of the second half of that soccer game because of all the suffering and private than NFL players have endured because of the knowledge gained by all of those concussed football players that were told to shake it off and get back in the game. This is a major issue in sport. To see it glossed over and actually turned into some gender issue is incredibly irresponsible. I'm not saying you're a bad person, but to take such a serious subject and not make it inclusive of all human beings and then suggest that one side has it worse than the other side and more like fodder for the newlywed game rather than a series metal. Does medical discussion. See that? I can be eloquent. I don't have to trash people. Well, I can trash them, but I don't have to write a all the curse words. You see that at a very tuxedo kind of vibe there, didn't I? Unlike this person who wrote to me. Oh, what a segue. Ginger scumbag bill. I've been a fan of yours for 15 years. Okay, so you guys got that. This guy has been a fan of mine for 15 years, so for 15 years this guy has been falling me enjoying things that I'm doing. All right? This guy's locked in for 15 years. The people that work hard every day

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       and spend their hard earned cash. That's kind of redundant, sir. If you work hard, then you have harder and cash. All right? If you've got an easy job, you know, and then you'd be spending your fucking teddy money right built. Just read the fucking email. All right? Just having fun. Bill, I've been a fan of yours for 15 years. The people that work hard every day and spend their hard earned cash to see you have been really disappointed. This is one of the classic things. When people complain rather than just complaining for themselves, they act like they're standing in front of like a zillion people and they go relax, attention everyone. I will send the email and we'll convey all of your feelings. Get on with your day. Relax. I will handle it. So evidently he has like, you know, all of these people are disappointed in me.

Speaker 1:          00:33:30       He said, the people that follow you and made you who you are, they made me people. I didn't work hard on stand up. I was just standing there and they all said, hey yo, we have decided to make you and who you are so sad it be said, so set it be done. He said, you have made dates all around the country and then cancelled them when Hollywood calls you to do a part. That's exactly what happened. I picked up the phone, I said hello. They said, this is Hollywood here. We're calling you to do a part. Say, uh, the people that go to your shows and made you, that made you aren't making a 10th of the money that you make, but they paid to see you. Hey, ginger boy.

Speaker 1:          00:34:14       Without these fans, you're illiterate. Ass would be working at Mcdonald's at best. Now, I take offense to that, sir. Okay? Without my fan base, I would not be working at Mcdonald's. You son of a bitch, I would be unloading trucks in a warehouse. Get it straight. He goes, you're a scumbag. Ba Gee, you're a scum Baije and I hope every fan realizes what you are and stops going to your shows. I will never listen to your shows or podcasts again and we'll tell everyone to do the same. You are the typical sellout to Hollywood fucking disappointment. I know you won't have the balls to read this on your podcast. Instead, you will read a letter from a 20 year old guy confused about his girlfriend's sex and sexuality. This is the best part here. You're a real cunt. Fuck you and everything you do as one of the greatest Sendik's, one of the greatest enemies to any email ever. Gut. You're a real cunt in the real deal. If you, if you tip over your country, you see the stamp of approval from the current factory and then it's just not fuck you. It's fuck you and everything you do. Even when I go to the grocery store. Yeah. That too. Fuck you when you're out apples.

Speaker 3:          00:35:39       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:35:41       Jesus Christ. Sir,

Speaker 1:          00:35:44       you made me, did I have anything to do? Did I do anything? Did I work? Did I not fucking go onstage and eat my balls? Learning how to do this? I guess you did I listen, I just want to thank you for making me without your hard work of going through. I mean, I can't imagine how many, uh, I mean, how many people live in this country? I just can't imagine when you're just going through the macbook trying to figure out who you've decided will become a professional comedian. That just is. And the fact that you also have a day job during the time where I guess you're grossly underpaid. I mean, that's just incredible to me, sir. What the fuck do you want from me? Let me ask you this, okay? If Hollywood called you and asked you to be in a movie, you're going to say no. You're going to say no.

Speaker 1:          00:36:37       All right. And like, like you told your mom, hey listen Ma, don't worry. I'll come over and I'll clean up your yard this Saturday. All right? And then all of a sudden Hollywood comes to Collins says, Hey, do you want to pretend you're a lot tougher than you are and getting to a gunfight and get shot by, I don't know, whoever your favorite actor is, you're going to say, no, I have to go. Uh, I got a stick. What? You've never broken a fucking, you know what? Fuck that. Even like a playoff game comes along. You've never fucking had to change a schedule, sir. I had to cancel some dates. I didn't cancel them. I rescheduled the fuck. Do you want from me? You want me to stay in the strip malls for my entire career telling jokes I did that. I'm trying to fucking, you know, and all, all, all these movies to do is make more people know who I am. So more people come out to my shows so I can keep writing more hours and having a good time. All right. I don't even know why I'm talking to you. You said you're never going to listen to my shit again, right? Are you a man of your word after you're saying, I'm not a man of my word. If you're actually listened to this, then you're a fucking hypocrite. All right. What's a matter?

Speaker 3:          00:37:48       Huh?

Speaker 1:          00:37:50       Jesus Christ. You fucking pissed on your sweat pants this week or I don't know what the fuck that was all about. You didn't even say what it was. You may dates all around the country and then cancelled them. The fuck are you talking about? I had one tour. I had to move around and I fucking did the first two dates. Then I've made up a one to 3 cents then and add an another one that wasn't even on that original tour, so go fuck yourself. All right. All the tickets are honored and if he can't make that date, you get it refunded

Speaker 1:          00:38:26       Jesus Christ. You know that that tour that I was going to do, I was just going to land in Boise, you know, jump on a bus and knock them all out in 10 days now because that whole thing blew up. Now I've got to get on it. You know, it's like an extra 10 airplane ride. You don't hear me bitching though. Yeah, you fucking cunt. You're a real cunt. Fuck you. And everything to do that was worth it. That was worth them getting mad. That's fucking tremendous, sir. You know what? As much as you do, you disappointed me. You're a real disappointment. You fucking jerk off. You've liked me for 15 years. One cancel fucking Gig and now you, now you're saying fuck me and everything I do. I make that Pumpkin pie this week. You save fuck the pie too. That's a part of it. You're saying fuck America. If you're saying fuck punk, punk a pie.

Speaker 2:          00:39:14       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:39:15       but I got here I am a real cunt. I, you know, I can't argue that.

Speaker 2:          00:39:20       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:39:25       uh, hit us up to somebody. Please put that on a tee shirt. You're a real cunt. Fuck you and everything you do. Just to have that just out there just written. That's really tremendous. Oh, by the way, if you guys want to read an unbelievable book, I told you I was reading that, uh, that book data Al Jourgensen from Ministry wrote, I just finished it, man. I'm telling you some of the most insane fucking stories you ever going to read. I'll give you one line, one descriptive line from one of the stories was basically he was talking about like these basically talking about three of the craziest people he's ever met. And he was talking about this one, a tick guy who met this lunar chick chick groupie. And the line was he, he brought her into the bathroom but fucked her and then flushed your closed down the toilet.

Speaker 1:          00:40:31       It was fucking insane thing I've ever heard in my life. So then she comes walking out of the bathroom, she's like, oh my God. Like what's with your friend? What am I supposed to wear? So they took a tablecloth of the table and they cut a hole in it and they made a dress out of it and then tied it off around the middle and then she was just went on tour with them, happy as a clam. Um, all right, that's me butchering that story. Just imagine 200 and what was it, 273 pages of that phenomenal, phenomenal fucking read. And it also exposed me to all this amazing music in the 80s that I completely missed on because, you know, I was 12 in 1980 so right around, you know, I don't know, you know, you don't listen to good music when you're in your teenage years unless you have really well informed older siblings.

Speaker 1:          00:41:27       Like the youngest kid in the family usually knows what to listen to. You know, if he has older brothers who were like eight, nine, 10 or sisters that are old, like eight years old. There was something that could usually hip his friends to, hey, you know, just some of the, the music that ministry was making. Right. And to think that I was arguing with people about whether, uh, you know, Motley Crue was better than poison, not shitting on those bands, but I'm just saying, cause I like both those beds for what they are. I like them, you know, I love Motley Crue and poison. It took me a while. I mean they came out with makeup and all the chicks liked him and you know, so it's, you, they were easily hateable so it was bon Jovi and all that aluminum. Oh my God, he's so dreamy.

Speaker 1:          00:42:12       You know who's going to consumed. Right. They just stuck to you when that shit, but if you just look at him, what the fuck they were doing, you know, it's all right. Right. But anyways, I had no idea. I had no fucking idea. And I still don't, if you guys actually, you know, you know a lot about that type of music or you've got some punk bands because I missed out on all of that shit. And um, I'd really like to go back and listen and work my way through that. Um, the road less traveled of eighties music because I didn't know any better. All right. Okay. Continuing on. What the fuck is this? Oh, this is from last week and of course I just reduced the damn thing and rather than a, is that the right word? Reduced it. And you're cooking here bill. Um, oh by the way, all things comedy has a, was starting to do a monthly show down at Largo, Largo on La Cienega and we have a show, um, this Tuesday night.

Speaker 1:          00:43:10       All things comedy. Um, the podcast is all the network. Me and Al Madrigal, we're going to be down there and knocking out another show. We had a great time. Um, last month show was one of the best standup shows I've been on in a long time. Just as far as not only the level of comedy, standup comedy, just the diverse, um, the d the, I don't know, just, it was a really great mix of comics that were on that one. So we're hoping we can do it again. And, uh, it's also a great, you know, if you see our diversity comedians are, so are the podcasts on all things comedy. And I really appreciate everybody that's already bought tickets to come on down. It's going to be eight o'clock on Tuesday night. Ra plowing ahead, plowing ahead. What else do we got here? Oh, you don't have to fucking bugs me.

Speaker 1:          00:43:53       I went to Toronto again, which is such a great city. They're all Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver. I just have a great time when I'm up there and I can't wait to run through that, that country up there. And, uh, March of next year is when we were shooting to a tour of that country. But, uh, every time I go to Toronto, I always go, I gotta go to the El Mocambo cause that's where Stevie Ray Vaughn, uh, he recorded that, uh, I guess live at the El Mocambo and I fucking still didn't get to do at this time, just didn't have enough God damn times and knowing. So anyways, let's plow ahead here. A Mother Teresa is what? This next one is called. Bill, you mentioned in your youtube tour of Boston, something to the effect of that someday someone is going to write a tell all about Mother Teresa. Yeah, I was just joking around.

Speaker 1:          00:44:41       He said someone did. Here's the link. Um, here's the link to the documentary based on the book. Quick summary. She was a cunt, had come on a 100%. She wasn't a, she wasn't helped some people out. Jesus Christ. Oh Way. You know what, if Mother Teresa can be called at current, I guess I should take the fact that I'm a real cunt. You're a real, can't you realize that? Um, all right. College stadium. Oh Hey. By the way, anybody, uh, anybody ever been to Italy? Um, I'm going to go there to get acclimated to the time before I do the European tour. I'm just going to, I just said fuck it. You know, why? Just go over there and bang out a bunch of shows. I never get to see anything. Um, other than the backs of comedy clubs. I want to go see some shit.

Speaker 1:          00:45:33       So I've decided that I'm going to go over, you know, a couple, two, three days over in Italy in a, I'm leaning towards going in Naples. Anybody, anybody at all, if you've ever been there, can you give me some places to go? I want to go see a fucking opera over there. Get all dressed up, bring a little handkerchief, cry like a little girl, you know, take the whole fucking thing in. You have some sketti and then I'm off. I'm off on my run. So if you guys have any suggestions I would really appreciate it. Um, Oh and speaking of which is really just a lot of announcements this week, uh, had a lot of shit happened. Thank you to whoever brought me the uh, Ken Burns the war on DVD. That was ridiculously generous of you did not have to do that and believe me, I will be watching that once again.

Speaker 1:          00:46:17       The second I get through all of Ken Burns is the rest of them because I've already seen that one. But I've done, I definitely want to watch it again cause it's like such a history lesson just as far as you can just see. Oh first we went here, then we went here. This is where this island is. This is where the battle of the bulge was really fucking fascinating. So thank you for that. Um, all right. College Stadium Bill. I am a group of my buddies and I, uh, want to take a trip somewhere random and catch a good college football game. Not necessarily just the game with a team, but also a great stadium. We're all in our mid twenties and live in Florida. Ben To plenty of gators and seminals games. I was going to say, Jesus Christ where you don't have to travel. You've got it right there.

Speaker 1:          00:46:58       Uh, which colleagues called stadium would you suggest we make our trip to somewhere that serves beer during the game would be a plus, but not a requirement. Um, I don't know about, I don't know that the NCAA, any of the, the college stadium serve beer. Um, I never noticed that they didn't at the rose bowl because I was so fucking shit faced that I didn't need any more alcohol. So I never tell, I'm usually trying to buy something to absorb all the booze that I've adjusted. Um, but uh, I don't think that you can, that's what my friends had been telling me. We were just in college station and um, they didn't sell it there. They didn't sell it at the Lsu game. So anyways, in other words, what's the Best College stadium atmosphere that you've been to that you would recommend visiting? Uh, love the podcast, blah, blah, blah. Go Fuck Yourself. Okay. Um, yeah, I liked it. You phrased it that way cause I'm only going by what I've done. Um, I got to tell you, Lsu, Alabama in Baton Rouge was, uh, even if you, you're not a fan of the sport, you realize that you're at something legendary and special. Just SCC football in general, like the level that's being played at there in another golden age of that conference. And I, and I'm blown away by how well behaved and polite the fans are. Because you know, the stereotype of southerners, you know, walk around.

Speaker 5:          00:48:23       Hello, what are you doing over here? Yeah. We don't walk your cat around here. No,

Speaker 1:          00:48:28       it's nothing like that. It's not the, most of that shit is just from watching Mississippi burning and Hollywood's version. I'm not saying that those guys don't exist. All right. It's kind of like a, that Ray Donovan character, like that character is supposed to represent like everybody on the east coast, basically the northeast, that that's how people are, you know, he come, he come Numa family again and I'll fucking kill you. You know that bullshit all the time. And like, like everybody down south is fucking playing a washboard. It's not like that all at all. I thought the two were raw, you know, they throw down the level in college station. They were amazing. Um, this is what I would do. I would pick, if you're a fan of any other team, go into a home game against one of their big rivals is awesome. It's, it's, it's fun to go to a game where you actually give a shit about the team.

Speaker 1:          00:49:29       Um, so you kind of have a dog in the fight or if you're going to go, uh, go see someone really special, you know, like some once in a generation kind of play like Johnny football comes around like, you know, like that guy is going to be a legend regardless of what he does in the football NFL, whether he makes it a nod, it's to be able to see and like I saw that guy in his sophomore year play against Alabama and a and a 49, 42 game. That's pretty cool. So if I was you just to look in, it's saving money and that type of shit, you really don't need to go anywhere. You're down there in SCC country anyways, I would go see Alabama. I go to the Alabama Auburn game even though Auburn's non not as good as they were. Uh, with Cam Newton, I go to one of those ones.

Speaker 1:          00:50:14       For some reason the Florida Georgia game in Jacksonville does not interest me because that it's an away game for everybody because they were worried about the behavior of people. I want to see their behavior. I like when does one team going into a hostel, a hostile environment. So you know, like I saw Texas, Oklahoma at the cotton bowl and that was awesome and it was great, legendary steam to go to, but there was definitely something missing. There was no, you know, you're in our house now. Vibe was not there. Um, so I dunno, Jesus, am I fucking meandering this week or what? So I, if I was you, I would either go to Tuscaloosa, I go to Baton Rouge, um, Tennessee for some reason it looks fucking insane to me. Tennessee I think would be insane just because that's in Knoxville is just the middle of fucking nowhere and there's nothing else to do. But to go absolutely ape shit at a Tennessee volunteers game and just watched them throwing down. I'm telling you half the fucking show is being outside the stadium and watching how hardcore these people party, um, or and cook and all that. I mean, they don't get drunk and belligerent like a, at least I haven't seen that yet. And it's probably a lot of people rolling their fucking ice. But uh,

Speaker 1:          00:51:34       you know, it seems like the violent fans are on the coasts. I Dunno. Like if we're going to get stomped or fucking stabbed or shot, especially out here in California, um, I don't know when, if you Mosey on up to somebody smoker, all you do, throw them a couple of compliments. Next thing you know, you've got something smoked sitting on a plate, they'll fucking hook you up. That they're great, they're great people south get the south gets such a bad fucking reputation. And I know there's the racism and there's all that fucking shit, but unfortunately, that racism is everywhere, at least as far as my travels. So, uh, the end of the day, those fuckers cook better than they do in the up north at a football game. Anyways, so there you go. There's my long winded fucking answer. Alright. Hey, Billy bets. Couple of weeks ago you said you don't want to see the coliseum because it's too touristy.

Speaker 1:          00:52:23       I implore you to change your mind. Oh, here it is. Uh, you yourself, you owe, you owe yourself. You left out the o what? You, you, you, yourself love to go to different arenas and stadiums in America. If I remember correctly, you said you wanted to go to every major sporting arena in the u u s yeah. You know this argument. I know what you mean. As well as major college stadiums to call a Siem is one of the oldest stadiums in the world and the most famous in history in the history of the world, 50,000 people could sit in it. It had a retractable roof, giant pieces of fabric that were controlled by men to block the sun out. Jesus correre and I'm sold. I'm going. And some historical texts claim that it was even filled with water in naval battles were reenacted for the public. Jesus Christ. You know what was, was that the greatest empire of all time? Wow. They put the gluttony even in it even, you know, I can only speak my country, but even like the level of big gulps and how fat people are now, even with that, we don't have puking rooms here. Like they had rooms. The Romans had rooms just for like after you've gorged yourself will, you just went in and yakked you know, and can you imagine the poor conquered people that had to clean that fucking thing out every couple of hours.

Speaker 2:          00:53:49       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:53:49       And An air condition. Puke Room. Wow. Jesus Christ. I'd fight a line in a second not to fucking have to do this, just get it over with. And he said yes, it is very a very touristy place to go, but it is the most famous arena and the history of the world. It was built nearly 2000 years ago and still stands today. I guarantee you that I saw in Dallas won't be standing in 2000 years. Ps, my girlfriend watched your episode of new girl and said it was the first time she ever saw you not yelling,

Speaker 1:          00:54:22       Jesus, I'm getting pounded this week, but I can't. I can't argue any of it. I am a real cut and I do scream a lot. Um, all right, well maybe, maybe I, I'll, I'll do that. Like, look, I have, I have plans of, uh, for the rest of my standup career of, of continuing to expand my tours through your, through Europe and uh, wherever else they'll have me, Australia and, and I want to see it, man. I'm only here once. I want to see it. And, uh, Italy, I don't plan on just going to one time, like there's all these different, so all these years of watching a Mario Batali who gets my vote is the coolest fucking redhead on TV. All right. Um, we just, his knowledge and passion for a, that country in their food and all the different places to go. Um, he's made me want to go to so many different parts of Italy, so I'm just starting with this one. I guess I should start with Rome, but it just seemed hacky to go there. So, uh, I dunno, I mean the game plan always was to tor and make a little bit of money and Europe and then blow all of it in some awesome country. So that's basically, and it probably won't be making that much money in Europe because people don't really know me at, uh, but you know how much this spaghetti costs.

Speaker 1:          00:55:48       Yeah. All right. How about a little advertising here? All right. He voice everyone. If you're an entrepreneur and a customer calls, do you want it to seem like you're in a high rise window view? Fancy pants office.

Speaker 1:          00:58:21       Bill, here's the dilemma. You're hanging out at your house wanting a snack. Your lady says she's going to bake you some cookies. What a sweetheart. Absolutely. What a champ. Uh, she brings the cookies out. And to your surprise, they are dick shaped cookies. Think Bachelorette party complete with sprinkles for pubes, et Cetera. You're hungry and the cookies are sure to be tasty, but they are shaped like dicks. Do you eat all the cookies? Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. Uh, you know what we have here, sir? That right there is a classic example of some Code Lotion. That right there is some fucking cold lotion. You said you're hungry, you want a snack, and your woman goes, oh, go make you some cookies. You're like, Holy Shit. I've finally found a woman that's still cooks. It doesn't feel like you're taken away her right to vote. If she goes out and does that for you, phenomenal.

Speaker 1:          00:59:21       She brings the cookies in. You're all excited and you look down and you've got a bowl of Cox. Um, do you eat the cookies? Um, well, do you plan to run for office? They sir, if you do, while I probably wouldn't work, I would say you should take a picture of yourself eating the bowl of dicks that way no one could ever say that you're homophobic, but somebody could run a smear campaign and say that your marriage was a sham and just have you get out and they picked the worst picture you with your eyes half closed and the most enjoyable ecstasy. Look on your face. Sugar rush as you stick in a dick in your mouth. I know that could go either way. Do you eat the cookies? Um, a listen man. A fucking cookie is a cookie. I need them if they tasted good. Um, hey, when those things get stale, does that mean they're kinda that he'd get like a wrecked? Sorry, that was a stupid Dick Jokes. Um, do you eat the cookies? I don't know about, you know what? I'd have to know what your, if your girlfriend did that to be fucking hilarious. Like, hey, you want some cookies? And that comes out with a bullet. Dicks Dick Cookies. That's fucking hilarious. At which point I'd eat all of them.

Speaker 3:          01:00:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:00:38       But, uh, yeah, there's no way she wasn't trying to be funny. You know what? You should laugh when you should eat. And with a big glass of milk, which a metaphorically is just color. If you get like the 0% fat, you should just go all out with it. Ah, that's fucking gross. I never liked sex jokes with food. Isn't that disgusting? That I grocery on? I apologize. I apologize to you on this wonderful Monday. Hey, by the way, everybody, I bet you sitting there going like, you know, fuck my life. I want to know what bill's doing this weekend. I know you're not, but let's just, just appease my ego. Appease the ego of a real cunt here. Um, I'm going to be at the Chicago, the legendary Chicago theater. This, uh, this Saturday night for not one, but two shows. Who am I bringing along? None other than master chef.

Speaker 1:          01:01:26       Slash Rosebowl tailgate lesson legend Jason Law head. Who's Cleveland browns one this week. All right, so check out law, head court, law heads court, his, uh, his podcasts. Um, you'll get to hear something that you haven't heard in a long time, which is probably a happy Cleveland browns fan. Um, I am a closet Cleveland browns fan cause I think they have one of the best fucking uniforms in the league. And uh, and they were great when I was a kid and the 80s, I love those browns teams, that fucking municipal stadium, just that it just was on NFL films, municipal stadium when it was overcast and it was cold and it may be snowed a little bit now. The field was muddy. They had just with, it was one of the last great football stadiums out there. Even though I know it was built for baseball was probably a terrible place to see a game and a lot of ways.

Speaker 1:          01:02:19       Um, I was a fan of Brian Sipe and the cardiac kids and all of that shit. So I always root for those fuckers. Um, so anyways, yeah, I'll be at the uh, the Chicago theater unfortunately, um, coming in and coming right back out, flying in the day of and then leaving. I wanted to try and maybe take it and I think Northwestern's at home, I know Notre Dame is at home. He's going to try to drive over there, but I think it's too long a fucking drive. But uh, anyways, if you guys have any suggestions on a great place to eat, I don't want to get deep dish pizza.

Speaker 1:          01:02:51       I don't want to do that. How about more like a steak place? That deep dish pizza man. Like you always order one. You like, I got this, I got this. And then it becomes like a man versus food moment. Um, it is, it is delicious. Do you know what? Fuck it. How about a steak place in a good place to get a deep dish? Pizza. You know what you guys should do? You guys should try to see how fucking fat you could make me just subtly, just all get together. Like that guy suggested like you're all in communication with each other, you know, and now that I've canceled those dates, why don't you guys try to get together and try to make me a fet? Freckled fuck. Alright, hater. Alright Billy tit. Rag. I don't even know what it, what is it? Tit Rec. Is that a worn out bra?

Speaker 1:          01:03:38       Um, I, I need some advice on a hater. Alright, I'm 20 years old. Hey, that guy called it check. That guy who called me a ginger scumbag, he called it. That's at least he called the age at somebody 20 years old was going to write it. I'm 20 years old and I've been pretty shy and self conscious for my entire life until recently. That's understandable. Surf. I was a well within the tortoise shell until I was 23. Um, he says, I've started to just say fuck it. It doesn't matter what anyone else thinks. That's a great thing. Good for you. You said it, it feels great, but it's hard though. Uh, I'm no expert. I got a lot. I've got a lot more confidence and now I ha I now have one of my first haters. Well, that's good. You know what most people hate?

Speaker 1:          01:04:26       Most people hate watching somebody enjoy themselves or be successful. So he must either he knew you or she knew you before when you were shy and now is seeing you start to come out, come into your own, and it's making that person feel left behind or, uh, they're just straight across the board. Anybody having a good time and enjoying themselves, they try to knock them down. Um, anyways, he says this kid goes to my college of 600 people. We go out as a big group most nights and he's always there. Once in a while he'll throw a comment my way and I just ignore it. Uh, last night I was talking to a girl and he comes up behind and puts my hood over my head. I turned around and stared at him for 10 seconds and he just looked away. This kid's pathetic. I've just been ignoring him and trying not to give a fuck that doesn't work with bullying, surf that doesn't. Um, he says, I definitely don't want to fight the kid and ruined my reputation, but I also don't want to look like a little bitch. I figured you might know what to say, seeing that you deal with hecklers all the time. Thanks. Um, first of all, hey, you don't have to hang out with this kid.

Speaker 2:          01:05:33       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:05:35       You know this, unfortunately, this is not the first one of these kinds of people that's going to be in your life. You have to,

Speaker 2:          01:05:42       mmm.

Speaker 1:          01:05:44       You got to pay attention, especially when you're younger, because you kind of wide open because you just, you know, you just started your parents' house, you starting to learn shit on your own. And a lot of times if you came from a dysfunctional home, you'll actually surround yourself with the same, kind of, can't see exact cut. Sweet. When you yelled at your parents and you walk out, you actually end up rebuilding that exact same structure. Now that's not my, that's obviously I've heard that, you know, from people who are intelligent and I actually went out and did that. So what you have to do, you've got to cut the cancer out. All right? You don't need to be around this guy. You having a good time. He coming into your own. You're talking to the ladies, you having a good time. So, uh, no. If he does something like that to you again, yeah. You got to, you have to, at some point you've got to step to the kid and just be like, dude, is there some sort of a problem here?

Speaker 2:          01:06:35       You know?

Speaker 1:          01:06:37       And considering you just stared at him and he looked away, I, I pretty much think he's going to back down. But, uh, you know, if you've got to do what you gotta do, if you've got to have a fight, you got to have a fight. It's not a bad thing, you know, it's just nowadays with lawsuits and all these youtube videos and shit, kids used to settle shit amongst themselves, so, uh, you might have to do that. I hope you don't.

Speaker 2:          01:07:01       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:07:04       But yeah, I, I would not ignore him.

Speaker 1:          01:07:07       I would not ignore him. I would, uh, you know, if you don't want to go to the physical route, I would just pick out something, um, that looks bad on him physically. And I would bring that up. I would go, I would go right for the fucking juggler with that kid. This is zillion different ways to do it and I'm afraid to tell you which way to do it because if it goes wrong, then you know the way everybody gets sued nowadays, just know I'm a fucking moron. But, um, I do know that if you're going to keep running into the same person and they're, they're, they're overstepping a boundary with you, ignoring them does not make them go away. You know, like that shit they say if you run into a black bear, just stand still and ignore it. It'll go away. They don't, okay. So you have to, uh, you got to address it. He could say anything, anything to whatever's name is, hey, what's up? You going to be in a country mood again this night?

Speaker 2:          01:07:58       You know,

Speaker 1:          01:08:00       can you do me a favor and maybe rub one out before you come over here with your frustrated fucking energy? Something like that. I don't know, except don't start it. When you say energy a energy. Um, I dunno. I Dunno if you know how to fight. If you know how to fight, uh, you know, I'm not saying to do it, but uh, there is a reason God allowed you to ball up your fist. Hey, if God didn't want us to punch anybody in the face, what did he have blessed us with fish. He's going amazing thing about your hand. Now we can correct somebody or fucking choke him to death. Just the options. That's why I don't think he's, he's going to judge it. You could fucking really do whatever you want. You know,

Speaker 1:          01:08:47       you're going to fucking just give people that. The, the, the, I've been doing a bit about this, how you going to give people freedom of choice and then you're going to get upset when they make the wrong choices. You're going to make them flawed and then you're going to get mad. I don't understand that. I really don't. All right. Anyways, that's the podcast for this week, everybody. I hope you had a good time. Ah, just to let you know this week, once again, I'm going to be in Chicago theater and then I have a after that and I could, I can tell you one guy who's not going to be there, that guy from earlier this week, I lost one.

I had such a good time driving from El Paso to San Antonio that I think I'm actually going to drive from La to El Paso.

Speaker 1:          01:10:12       It's a 12 hour drive, which is a, that's nothing, that's nothing to, uh, I've been doing the road for a long time.
