Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on? It's bill still and it's time for the Monday morning podcast from Monday, March six, 2017 what's going on everybody? I am in Phoenix, Arizona. Um, isn't that exciting? Phoenix, Arizona. Um, but actually gives man, I'm psyched. I'm working at standup live doing two shows tonight, two shows, Tuesday, two shows Wednesday. Um, um, you know, putting together my new hour and everything and I got a bunch of shit. I've actually been listening to my act. I always, you know, when I'm putting together a new hour, oh, I always record. I just never fucking listen. Well now I'm finally listening to my act. I figured it out when I can do it cause I, who the fuck wants to sit there and listen to yourself, but I'm doing is I'm a, I listened to it on the car ride home.

Speaker 2:          00:00:55       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:00:55       You know, if I had a decent set, if I had a shitty set, what's the fucking point? You know what I mean? It's Kinda like if you're always taping you,

Speaker 1:          00:01:03       your team, right. But you only watch if they win. You know? I know people who do that shit. They'd like know what the fuck happens before they watch and if they lose, they just don't even fucking watch. So I've actually been watching and that type of shit. And uh, speaking of which your team winning and losing all freckles came in last night and I went to the Phoenix Suns were playing, my boss did sell decks. So I decide, you know what, I'm going to go to that game, right? My hundred and 17th fucking franchise professional home team. I've spot ever professional sports team that I've seen a home game of hundred and fucking 17 of these mother fuckers. I got 10 more to go. I can't get out any 10 every time I get to 10 and I'm like, go one more team. I'll fucking, then I'll have nine left and somebody moves and how I got down to 10 I'm like, all right, the next one's going to get me down to nine and then the fucking ramp, the rams move back up to 11 right? So then I go see the thunder and I'm thinking, all right, look man, I'm down. I'm down to fucking, I'm down to nine and I'm like, wait a minute.

Speaker 2:          00:02:12       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:02:13       wait a minute.

Speaker 2:          00:02:15       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:15       I saw the New Jersey Nets. I never saw the Brooklyn Nets, so it's still 10 so I'm like, all right, next week, next week when I go see the sun's, I'll be down to 19th left. Right. So I'm sitting there watching the signs and I'm like, Z, I'm down to single digits. The Fan Slam is going down. One of the loneliest accomplishments ever, I guess if you went with a bunch of other people, I got to find the old pictures of me at these stadiums. I swear to God, they're all like disposable camera pictures held by a stranger. Um, you know, when I was doing all these fucking gigs in the middle of nowhere and shit. Yeah, I pass through the major cities. I would just go to a Goddamn game anyways. So last night I'm thinking, all right, I'm going to the sun's Celtics game. I'll have nine teams left. And I'm like, wait a minute, the fucking charger. It's just moved to Los Angeles. So

Speaker 2:          00:03:07       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:03:07       And then a month I'm working in San Antonio and I'm going to a spurs game, go on to the fucking spurs and then I think I'll finally be down to nine. You know, God forbid if the fucking Raiders don't move to Vegas after that. Um, but anyways, I uh, I went to the suns game, right?

Speaker 2:          00:03:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:27       So I show up immediately. Um, the club hooked us up with tickets, gave us great texts who was sitting two rows, find the fucking, one of the, uh, what do you call it in basketball? One of the nets, one of the goals, one of the back boards, right? Two, two rows back. So it's really three rows back cause I got all the fucking camera man, you know, but still it's a great seats. And I looked down on the right and is this guy just riding the reps in the, in the first quarter and he really gives a shit. So I'm looking at version and I'm just looking over going to look at this fucking, this guy's out of his mind. There's a guy who gives a shit. This is a hardcore season ticket holder, man. Would come at you. I'm laughing like he's just like, he knows the refs names. He's calling them out and all that shit and version. He starts going on. He goes, I bet that's the owner. I'm like, Nah, I'm on. The owner wouldn't be sitting down. He wouldn't be yelling like that if he was the owner. And he's like, well, Mark Cuban brides, the refs like, Dad, I gotta get the fuck out of here. So finally, you know, I go, I man, I'm going to look this guy up, right? So we, we look them up and it's the owner.

Speaker 1:          00:04:33       I got to tell you, Phoenix Suns, dude, you guys got a great fucking owner. Uh, Robert Sarver is his name meant we ended up talking to them at the end of the game because I tweeted a, I was making fun of 'em. What's his face? His shoes, his sneakers, the fucking worst sneakers I've ever fucking seen. Um, Kelly Olynyk, the big white goof, the seven foot fucking pylon out there, right? I don't, I, you know, Celtics love that guy. He got so many God, their meds. Maybe it's a road trip or whatever, but do this. He had these fucking sneakers on,

Speaker 1:          00:05:14       I think Garrow your premium warm in the, that fucking Superbowl against the Redskins when he fucked up the field goal too. They were like, they looked like black football cleats from the early seventies the ugliest fucking things ever seen. So of course I tweet about, that's why I get, so I tweeted about the thing and I guess the owner's son was watching. He goes, oh, he's probably sitting right next to you, blah blah blah. That's how I didn't meet the guy. But anyways, long story short, so I tweet about this fucking thanks. Making fun of the guy's sneakers thinking obviously these has to be the worst fucking sneakers. Without a doubt. Even with the Internet, even with Twitter, even with all of these fucking concept or on social media, nobody can argue with the thesis, the ugliest fucking sneakers ever. Right? They will low tops, fucking steel goal kicker cleats from the fucking early seventies right. And all these sneaker heads. So like you mean, you mean the Colby 11 I guess just to Coby Brian Seek. And what because it says Colby on it. All of a sudden the Colbys do do you mean the shack 14 I fucking hate sneaker heads of fucking can't stay at home with the 5,000 fucking pairs of sneakers, taking them out of the box, showing them off on MTV cribs and licking the soul. So it's like, you see, I never, I never even wore these joints before.

Speaker 1:          00:06:45       Yeah. I can tell from your fucking man tick she never worn before this sneakers. Why don't you go take a fucking walking him Bruce? He's a big sneaker head. I'll tell you, you know what? It is fucking overrated. It's so fucking overrated. Jordans.

You're going to score close to 80 points in a fucking NBA game cause you're wearing Colbys the Sundale three seven.

Speaker 2:          00:08:53       Okay.

Cause everything that he likes, it's like, it's, he likes what everybody likes, but then she's got this simplistic fucking great philosophy. We're who'd be like, Bill a bill. What's wrong? What's wrong with sweat pants? You know, you can't argue with them. I actually had, there's, there's nothing wrong with it. It's just, you know, the conversation. It's just like, it's just doesn't need to be, most of the conversation just doesn't even need to be had. Was there anything better than just walking around in sweatpants? Dude, you put on a pair of sweatpants with some Jordan threes over over to what is better than having on a hoodie and a pair of Kobe 11. [inaudible]. You go to a massage parlor and she's jerking your deck. I mean, am am I crazy? It's so it, it's, it's showing. It's a literally, it's a joke. All right. I'm sorry. Fuck all you sneaker heads out there. God bless you with your little fucking hobby. Uh, keeping your sneakers clean and you know, fucking walking on your heels anytime there's any sort of rubbish on the ground. Grown fucking man. Just walking like a God duck on the heels.

Speaker 2:          00:12:44       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:45       Hey Buddy, what the fuck are you do? I got on the seven, what is it? The first day of school, Dude, you know what I love? You know what I love? Is there anything better than when it snows on Christmas? That's the type of shit he says. It's like, no. Yeah, that's great. Paul. I think everybody's pretty much in agreement. I even the Jewish people, like if it snows on Christmas, you know what I mean? It probably adds to their Chinese food. I don't, where could, a fob doesn't like a fresh blanket of snow as long as it isn't a goddamn store. Do, do you know what I like amenities. Is there anything better than taking a steam? Uh, no. I mean, you know, that's also, that is a great thing that everyone is in agreement with. You know what I like, dude, I like fresh air. Is there anything better than like non polluted air when you breathe in? I mean, it's crazy. It's a g, it's literally, it's a joke. Um, Jesus, I went on a fucking tangent there.

Speaker 1:          00:14:00       Oh my God. For half a second. I thought the recorder wasn't recording. I forgot my fucking microphone. So this might sound a little bit, dude. He say anything better than just laying in your bed and just waking up and doing your podcast. I mean it's, it's literally, it's, it's, it's a joke. You know, I have to look up these fucking sneakers. How the Fuck Colby Bryant, one of the greatest fucking top of what two, three players of all time, individual players, teammate. He was a fucking nightmare. Um, you wait til that fucking confessional comes up. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:14:32       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:33       When you sit there, put in my password here.

Speaker 1:          00:14:37       Stupid Laker fans. So we chant MVP at the guy. I hate that Celtic fans are chanting MVP at Isaiah Thomas. By the way, it reminds me of Laker fans that were always, every time fucking Coby stepped on the court and did not pass the ball and scored 40 fucking points and they lose again and they have the bay. Um, did you see him dunk on that guy and then they lost? Oh my God, he's unbelievable. Maybe if we get 58 free agents in here and fucking Phil Jackson, they can win a title and VP. All right. Um, not what he's doing. He's wearing the Colby. So he's wearing the Colby loved. I have to look these fucking sneakers up. How ugly these God damn things are. And the fact that these pockets, sneaker heads, you mean the Colbys? I mean the rep sneakers, those fucking cleats just wearing, he looks like fucking Ken Stabler out there. Kobe 11. You cannot tell me that this fucking, the computer doesn't listen to you. Oh my, those are fucking dancing slippers. Jesus. At least he got the best. He got the best color. They come and pink becoming red and white. They got a Miami dolphin color.

Speaker 1:          00:15:52       Do those literally looked like women's sneakers? Like

Speaker 2:          00:15:56       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:15:56       you should have like the low cut socks with the little ball on the back if you were those fucking things. And I'm looking at, look, look at the 100 and $1,230 I bet. I bet if I went on youtube and this guy and I looked up Colby 11 I bet there's some fucking asshole sitting there licking the fuck. Who was a guy fat Joe did that and his MTV cribs and he got, he had like chick off. He's like the fucking Jordans. Six sixth and then he licked the bottom of them. It's like, do, do you realize the sweatshop? But those things were fucking Baden. Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:16:28       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:16:29       And you think those things didn't hit the ground in there and God knows they probably don't. They probably eat those people go to the bathroom at the fucking station and you're going to lick the bottom of those damn sneakers. They were in a hermetically sealed sneaker box. Dude. They were in a cardboard box and were shipped over here from the other side of the world. I think I'll put my tongue on them. All right. I'm going to look this up. I'm going to see if I can find that. I'm going to find a fucking video here. Coby 11th all right. I don't know why, but of the first video that came up said exploding poo and a guy had shit on his face. No, I didn't think they did that type of stuff on fucking

Speaker 2:          00:17:07       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:07       Coby 11 shoes. All right, and some asshole's going to do a fucking review.

Speaker 2:          00:17:13       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:17:13       Nike Colby 11 Performance Review through. These are the ugliest fucking sneakers I've ever seen in my life. These ones are actually worse. Coby Brian gives the Bron James his autograph shoes. Yeah. God. What the fuck did they talk about other than winning championships?

Speaker 2:          00:17:34       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:35       That'd be like listening to the fucking superman and like fucking Batman talking. All right. Colby gives away shoes to a fan. He was a shit all over the guy. He's like the nicest guy ever. Colby helps a bus load of sick children get to the staples center by towing it with his own body and his Colby 11th. All right, maybe I was wrong. Um, Nike, Kobe, I gotta get off this fucking subject. What am I listen to some guy do a fucking review of the sneakers. Nike Colby 11 performance overview. My initial thoughts. I fucking love Youtube. Well, it gives us, I guess you guys are listening to my thoughts, but I'm just being a fucking moron. Anyway, let's get back to the Goddamn game. All right, so Kelly, a Lennox out there and is Colby 11 do they will fucking crazy, dude. You get a seven foot white guy and Kobe 11 [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          00:18:26       It's all, it's all, I mean, the black guys is still going to go right around them and have their nuts in his face when they dunk on it, but I mean his, his feet from the ankles down, it's, it's, it's all, it's going to be a stitch of Joe. It's literally a joke. Um, all right. Anyways, so we got, we watched this game. The owner of the sons is a fucking riot. Um, totally just watching him ride in the referees, like old school guy, you know, right down there on the court watching the game and uh, you know, he's not about some luxury box or anything like that. Right. So anyway, so we're watching the game and the Celtics come out flat, which you knew they were Gunna, you knew they were Gunna, cause they just beat the Lakers anytime. I'm telling you this right now, gamblers, gamblers, anytime the any Boston team, right?

Speaker 1:          00:19:16       The why, well I'd say the Bruins are the fucking uh, Celtics going that west coast trip. Okay. If you want to make some money, bet against them the day after they play, either the clippers, the kings of the Lakers, cause they fucking go to la. And after the game they all go out. They Bang a bunch of fucking broads, a bunch of fucking actresses or whatever the fuck it is they do. And then the next game when they go to San Jose, down to Anaheim, out to Phoenix, up to Portland, whatever the fuck they go next, there's always a let down. So the Celtics come out flat, the fucking son's are all over him. Um, love of the guard was on the sons was just as fast it seems as Isaiah. So he was right up on them. Um, frustrating the hell out of them. And Isaiah had to think for files in the first half.

Speaker 1:          00:20:03       And um, so we're watching the game and I'm just going like, I fucking knew it. I'm so excited to finally see this team. I've been watching, seen almost every game of this year and they'd come out flat. I'm like, Oh man, am I really going to the fucking hangover game? Ah, what do I give a shit? I got three fucking tickets would still, you know, it's a bunch of Celtics fans there. They're all going fucking nuts and everything. We had like nothing to cheer about. I think we were down by like 10 after the first half. Um, and we just start chipping away, chipping away, chipping away. First half was ugly. I mean it was like a, it was like a first quarter score with like four minutes to go. It was like 32 27 it seemed, maybe it was like six minutes ago. So what the half, I think they were both didn't the forties. I don't even remember. And uh, and I said Paul Jokingly, I go, you watch the boats going to score over a hundred, they're going to eat up or whatever. So of course they come out and everybody starts hitting their shots. It turns into this great game. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:21:02       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:21:02       And then the fourth quarter comes and we start chipping away, chipping away, chipping away with down by like 10 or 11 and then went down by eight, then went down by five and then without my, for next thing you know, we're up by like two. So you guys all know how the fucking game ends, right?

Speaker 2:          00:21:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:21:18       We fucking missed what's his face? Uh, Brown ms, that foul shot and Isaiah, Mr. Foul shot that would have fucking ice tea and a, we let them hang around, hang around and fucking hang around. In the end. I came up with was tired and we were up by one. It all happened. So you know what? It happened so fucking fast. When you're at the game and you don't have an announcer holding your hand and you don't have something that you can actually look at, there's too much shit to look at. So we go to inbound. The fucking ball.

Speaker 2:          00:21:47       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:21:47       right. This guy goes around Jae Crowder, I think tied it up. We'll like SLAAC right. That's right. We were up by two instead of being up by three and force him to take a three and they probably would have missed a fucking thing. That's right. And the guy goes right around, Crowder lays it in, crowd's going nuts. There's like four seconds left to go high and they can try to get into I Isaiah Thomas. Let's see what happens. We fucking inbound the ball. Isaiah, one of the only times I've seen a mess up this year messed up the past. Who's kind of looking up court, you know, cause there's only four seconds left before he caught the ball. They kick it out to this fucking dude. What the hell was his name? I actually wrote it down so I would give him the respect he deserves. Tyler ulous, they kick it out to him and he hits a fucking three point or at the buzzer to beat the Celtics. And here's the thing, I had second row fucking seats. And guess what? I didn't even see the play. It happened on my end. You know why? Because the fucking assholes who are in the, they're in the front fucking row.

Speaker 1:          00:22:48       They inbound the ball and they could see that, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:22:53       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:22:53       Um, Thomas was, was fucking it up. They stand up. You read the Front fucking rob, what are you standing up for? There's nothing in front of you. You fucking cons. And all of a sudden I just saw the ball go to the net and everybody goes, and where the horn goes off, everybody goes nuts. I go, what the fuck does that count? Did that just go with what the fuck just happened? I had to go home to watch the replay to see what the fuck happened. I was sitting in the second row. I couldn't see it because he's fucking assholes stood up in front of me. Um, I don't, I don't understand standing up when nothing's in your weight. They haven't, you ever heard that expression?

Speaker 2:          00:23:30       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:31       Why Stan? When you could sit by, sit, when you can lay down. Why stand up when you were in the front fucking row and what is block and your God damned here anyways. All right, I'm done. Fucking bitch in here. I had a, I had a great time and evidently Kobe are fucking crazy man.

Speaker 2:          00:23:47       You know

Speaker 1:          00:23:52       dude, Chris Everett should wear that fucking sneaker. That's what it looks at. It looks like the one that different colored ones. I'd like, you know, do you know something that is a testament to how great Colby Bryant was. You know, it's almost like he's so fucking good. Nike was at the factory going like, how fucking ugly do you think we could make a sneaker if we put your name on it? These people that lick the bottom of the fucking sneaker, will they still buy these God damn things? You know what? Now that I'm looking at him cause I'm an old man. They don't look like you played basketball. Great. They look comfortable as hell as far as when they're in a different color, I guess.

Speaker 2:          00:24:30       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:24:30       They look like slippers. They is, the thing I want is, I want to fucking ask you. Colby had that horrific, uh, Achilles, um, injury. I swear to God, which is like, that was the end of anybody's career. That is like the classic old man basketball injury. As you go to take a step in your fucking Achilles goes right up the back of your leg. Um, I mean, I don't even think I obviously, I don't fucking play hoops at all, but I still fucking, I'm always stretching my fucking Achilles. I swear to God before I get out of bed. That's, I don't know what it is about that injury. I just know like five or six people that have had it and I want no part of it.

Speaker 2:          00:25:16       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:25:16       I want no fucking, you never walk right again. I mean, if he got Colbys money, you know, you can go to Germany and meet the grandsons of the Nazi fucking doctors and they'll spend your fucking blood in a centrifuge, whatever the fuck they do. And then you come back and you can still dunk or whatever, you know. But most people don't have Coby money. So what's going to happen is as you're going to go down to the veterinarian down the street and he's going to show that thing back and you're never going to, you're never going to be, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:25:42       that's it.

Speaker 1:          00:25:44       God help you. If you're ever in a situation where there's panic and the crowd starts running and it's a stampede and you've blown out your Achilles at some point in your life that you're going to get trampled,

Speaker 2:          00:25:58       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:26:00       you're going to be that zebra on the Serengeti that gets eaten by the fucking alligators. Basically what's going to happen. Um, but he, you know, he has the low tops. I wonder if that probably had nothing to do with it. I'm just surprised guys are wearing low top fucking sneakers again. Like, it's a

Speaker 2:          00:26:17       okay

Speaker 1:          00:26:17       cause it, you know, I don't pay attention to shit. I usually watch hockey right at first he's going like, no, no, no. Colby kind of brought the low tops back. Everybody's wearing. So I looked out on the court and I saw a number of people with low tops are people still had like these high top sneakers on, but the amount of ones like that, that they were like velcro. You don't like a little kid, he can't tie you sneakers. See, have they had like velcro high tops with like a fucking belt around your ankle? And I, I dunno,

Speaker 1:          00:26:46       I don't know about those either. You know what's hilarious? How arrogant I am that I actually think that the world cares what a 48 year old white guy thinks about fucking sneakers. Well, why don't you just get a pair of shell toes. Um, so anyways, we went to the Goddamn game and uh, we a great fucking time. Uh, Robert Sovereign, his family are great. We met, we met him briefly. Just talk to them. Just great people like that guy. Dude, if I was afraid expense, I would be very happy with that guy. As an owner, even though I know you guys are rebuilding that guy, fucking gloves, his team, there's a lot of owners, they don't give a shit. You know, they own a team so they can have hookers and blow up in a fucking sweet dude. That guy, he was, it looked like he, I was going to say, it's like he had money on the game and he does. He's paying the fucking players.

So I've been listening to a bunch of fucking old school country, not all the way back to Hank Williams, but like that outlaw shit, you know, right before the outlaw shit is George Jones considered outlaw, I dunno. But listening to him obviously, um, to all of these other fucking guys, right. And uh, I ended up list, I remember that this song, do you guys remember Johnny paycheck? Johnny paycheck was this country singer and he, I swear to God, he had a hit song called take this job and shove it.

Speaker 3:          00:37:31       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37:32       And it was such a fucking hit. It's so struck a chord with people that they actually turned it into a movie. There was actually a movie called take this job and shove it. It was just, it was about a fucking guy who was working in a job that he hated and he wanted to tell them, you know, basically tell him to go fuck themselves. But he didn't have the nerves. And I think it was because the lyric was, someday I'm going to get the nerve to say it. And everybody could relate to it being like, Hey, I also hate my fucking life and I want to make a change, but I don't know how to do it. You know what I mean? It's like the whole Donald Trump fucking phenomenon, not the informed people. You know what I mean? I'm talking about the, the, the mouth breather.

Speaker 1:          00:38:22       You know what I mean? Like put the Hillary Clinton, you had the informed person that wanted to vote for her and then you had the hissy fit. Fucking dope. This'll be great for women. Like your life was really going to fucking change. Um, I swear to God, I just don't, I don't, I don't understand adults who haven't fucking figured it out yet. That you're, you're on your own. Okay. Playtime is over. Nobody cares about you. Okay. I don't care what color their fucking tire they put their bra is. They don't the level of money that you have to have and then you have to give it to these people for you to even be on their radar. You have to be going to these 10,000 hundred thousand $50,000 fucking plate dinners with them, and then you'd have to stand in a line of people that all paid that money.

Speaker 1:          00:39:11       Okay? And you got to get up there with your fucking shape shifter, fucking lizard eyeballs, and you got to try to peer into their soul. I didn't think it talked to him. You just walk up with a Napkin that says how much money you're going to give to them and then you're on the fucking radar. Has nothing to do with your genitalia anyways, so all the, okay, so I'm getting off the rails here. So this fucking guy, Johnny paycheck, he's got this fucking Sean Song called take this job and shove it. It's the funniest fucking just, there's no way to listen to this song and not fuck it. Just be, I played it for Paul Versey. He was crying and laughing. He goes, this can't be a real song. I go, dude, not only is a real song, it was turned into a movie. Just the way he says shove it is voice drops way down. He goes, take this job and shove it. I work in here no more. My warm and dawn left. Took all the reasons why I was working for these are the actual lyrics you it or not tried to stand in my way because I'm walking out the door. You could take this job and shove it. I work in here no more than this stupid baseline comes on boob but do, do, do, do, do and it gets all like kind of trying to

Speaker 4:          00:40:29       quiet. You don't want to, red neck gets quiet, you know and starts talking, leans in. It's fucking scary. You know, nine whites even for white people. That's fucking scary. There is nothing scarier than a redneck lean and in at a bar thinking that you were, we're all on the same team. That's some fucked up shit cause you, you're immediately like, I don't want to do, I don't, I don't want any part of what you're about ready to tell me sir. And I want to try to get out of this conversation gracefully. How do I dismount out of this fucking conversation that the second they went on, a fucking redneck looks the opposite way of the conversation and then leans in. I'm telling you, they should be like a fucking, I'd inject her seat on your bar stool to get you the fuck out of. Where did it go? Did I get left behind? So I swear to God, somebody gets into the verse, right? It's like he's leaning in, have been working in this factory for now, 15 years all his time.

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       A watch my woman drowning in a pool of tears. You know, and I, when I love about all those old school country songs, is there a fucking women always leave? They're always crying or whatever, but these fucking assholes. They never say why. And whenever I listen to these songs, it's just like, dude, what the fuck were you doing? I get it. You're working at this factory. You don't like the job. Why is your woman drowning in a pool of tears? What? I mean, are you taking this fucking so you don't have the balls to try to get a better job? Tell your boss to fuck off. So what happens? You come home, you take it out on your wife. Is that what you're doing? I bet. Shit jobs. I've had law for the first fucking, I don't know how many years of being a comedian.

Speaker 2:          00:42:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:42:22       Was it a low paying job? I never had a girlfriend drowning in a pool of tears. I mean, I definitely made him cry, but that's cause I was an asshole. Had nothing to do with my fuck. I wouldn't blame my job. I've been featuring on the road for now on 16 years. One of these days. Anyways, he got, he just listen to the fucking song. You got to hear this song. You got Johnny paycheck. Um, I know I'm making fun of him, but I actually,

Speaker 2:          00:42:54       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:42:54       I don't know. There's something about this. I listened to this fucking song and it just gives me all kinds of ideas for characters and shit like that and movies and whatever. Um, but I'm in download, George Jones, George Jones, Tammy, why net? All of these fucking people and I swear to God,

How far down the fucking track before the race starts? Do you have to be Jesus fucking Christ? How the fuck are you complaining? I'm complaining. I'm not saying that white people should not complain.

Speaker 1:          00:52:08       I was like, what are you going to get into the fucking east? Get some Ash Wednesday flowers. Why are they advertising it? Because you know what, they probably had their maximum appeal. They probably hit their maximum fucking, I just realized it's probably somebody sleeping on the other side. I mean, I'm waking him up with my fucking Johnny paycheck saying, let me get over here. Um, anyways, so they're probably like, well, how can we get people to fucking buy flowers all year round? How can we create a need? Well, everybody's got an anniversary. Everybody's got a birthday. Her birthday. Right? Hey, I like the way you're thinking Carl. We could sell flowers the whole year round.

Click on the microphone@thetopofthehomepageandtypeinbirdthatstamps.com and tuber. Alright, I'm getting up against it here. You know what I'm doing today, by the way, I'm going to go see Oh cleo audio. I'm going to see my dog Cleo. Um, the, the people that ended up a rest getting her from us live out here. So, um, I'm actually gonna get to see her and visit her today and tomorrow and um, I can't wait to see her and everything. She's probably not even gonna give a shit because she's probably going to be so in love with the other people cause I kind of realized that going well.

Speaker 4:          00:54:54       She was in love with the people that had her before us and within a week she fucking loved us. I mean, dogs should they adapt, they just fucking adapt. So, um, I got another five minutes here and then I got to take off. So I got time for one question here. Let me see. Um, let me get, let me get a good one here. Uh, all righty, righty. A dictator bill. I'm 19 years old and I've been with my girlfriend, my Wallman dawn left. I'm with my girlfriend from now for two years. Uh, I know what you're thinking too young for all these silly problems. That's not what I'm thinking. I'm thinking good for you. Way To go where to go. Fell. Um, anyway, for the first year of our relationship, literally everything was perfect. I still love her just as much as I did then. I'm sure she loves me just as much. However, during the second year of our relationship relationship and overnight shift changed, um, and then we stopped having sex. It base, it's basically nonexistent and now and again, every couple of months it will happen. But I know she's not enjoying it. This is because she was on the implant contraception injection. At first I was questioning myself and if it was me that wasn't getting her in the mood anymore, but she promises me that it isn't because of the implant. She says it's that it, what the fuck is it? Contraception injection.

Speaker 4:          00:56:26       Oh, Jesus. I, I mean I've never heard of that shit. It's an injection so you won't get pregnant.

Speaker 2:          00:56:34       Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:56:35       dude, if you literally told me contraception actually meant it's Gunna get you pregnant, I would believe that too. That's like one of those fucking words that I just ignored my whole life. You know, like Soliloquy, like what the fuck does that mean? You know, contraception, implant official site. Get the facts. Fuck that. I don't want to fax someone pictures. Images. Okay. They're showing it that it's nice and small. For some reason they keep putting it up against their bicep. They stick it in your fucking arm. What? So say some fucking robot shit.

Speaker 2:          00:57:30       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:57:31       Okay. It's birth control implant. They stick a fucking toothpick in your arm and then you can't have a baby. I don't get it anyways. Well yeah, that's probably fucking annoying to have it in there. You know what I mean? She goes to hug you and the inside of her arm hurts. Anyways, apps. The first I was questioning myself, blah, blah. She says that it, that has caused her to completely lose her sex drive. She says she just had it removed and it's been a few weeks since then. Nothing has changed yet. I feel so much resentment towards her every day and what I can only describe as depression. As soon as I see her, most of the time I find myself being such an angry, short tempered person. Now when normally I'm usually happy and smiling, ah, Jesus might be time to get out of this relationship buddy. But you know something, if it really affected her like that, it depends on how long she had it in there.

Speaker 4:          00:58:18       Maybe she needs longer than two weeks. Um, but you know, if you're gonna be an angry lunatic, I mean if you don't leave eventually she's gonna. But you know what, you get yourself a song on a warm and Don port or to pick in or arm. Now she won't suck. My Dick won't have these days. I'm going to whip it out and wipe it on the wall. You can take my dick and shit. Um, Rodney and your fucking mouth, you whore. But do, do, do, do, do you, do you okay. I always try. I always seem to try and hide my need for sex and act like I don't ever want it. And tried to show disinterests but I never can. I guess it just must be more important to me than it is to her. I never thought sex was such a big deal, but the last year has taught me that when there's bad sex life in a relationship, it can really cause the whole thing to just break down.

Speaker 4:          00:59:08       It just got to the point now that I've said we need some space and a break, because the last thing I want is to ruin our relationship. Um, dude, you're fucking miserable man. And you have to, you have to, you know, it's, you got to be with somebody and like understand them and, and you know, be there when they're going through a tough time, but like, you know, if they're not understanding how fucking miserable you are, you just going to, you're just going to keep getting more miserable and then, you know, then they're going to be miserable. And then in the end they gonna fucking break up with you and you're gonna be like, what the fuck? I should have done that to them breaking up with somebody. It's not something you should do to them. It's something you should do for yourself. All right?

Speaker 4:          00:59:51       This is the deal, dude. You're not fucking happy. All right? You're not happy. It's great that you take in a fucking break. And I would go out and I'd fucking go try to win, join myself and meet somebody that doesn't have a fucking toothpick in their arm that doesn't want to touch my dick. You know what I mean? That's just get down to brass tacks here. That's what's going on. Right? They stuck that shit and her and Noah, you can't stick your shit and hurt. So I mean why you gotta get the fuck out? I get up young dog in 19. What are you gonna Merrier? What are you in the military? People in the military getting married when the 19 you know,

Speaker 4:          01:00:26       but warmer dawn left. Um, that's what you do. I, I, it's just sounds like a, you sound like you, you need like a long time away from each other the way that was red dude, that sounded like a fucking 40 year old guy wrote that. 19th. So that's kind of a good sign that maybe you should get the fuck out. Um, who knows? But I, I would not say anything mean I would not. And uh, I just, you know, you want to be able to see the person again and not get a glass to the head. You know what I mean? That's kind of what you're going for. So the art form is you just tell them how you're feeling.

Speaker 2:          01:01:02       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:01:03       You know, I'm just not happy. I'm sorry. That's just how I feel. I'm just not happy and I'm finding myself less and less happy and, um, it's affecting my moods. Everything you just said.

Speaker 2:          01:01:17       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:01:18       And I'm finding that I'm getting angry and I don't want to be angry around you and, and create any misery in your life. So as much as this is going to hurt you, I'm walking out the door. You can take this relationship. Um, that's it. They walk out the door, you know, and you'll probably walk out that door and you'd be sad a little bit.

Speaker 2:          01:01:41       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:01:41       And you walk a little more, then you start skipping and then you're running down the street. You know, it might be one of those breakups. Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:01:50       Or could be the one, oh, why did I do it? I don't fucking know. But you're 19. You don't, if you've got the whole, you got your whole fucking life ahead of you. You don't need to be in this. This sounds like you're fucking married. I get up. All right. That's it. Okay. And that's the fucking podcast for this week. Go fuck yourselves.
