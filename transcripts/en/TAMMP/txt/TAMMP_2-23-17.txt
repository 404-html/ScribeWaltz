Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's time for the Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday. Monday morning podcast.

Speaker 1:          00:00:14       Ah, just checking in on you. I get bogged down in the mud on that one. I didn't think I was going to pull myself up, but you know what? I reached down deep. Showed what? I had it on me in on me. She'll write head in me. Um, anyways. Yeah. You know what? It's nice to be here. It's nice to be back out here in sunny la after, uh, going back to New York. It was chilly fall Billy back there in the New York City getting soft out here. And you know what? I love it. I fucking love it. That's a big thing that east coast people are we saying when you go out west, hey, don't, don't lose your edge, Bro. Don't, don't be getting all Hollywood on the dove like dope.

Speaker 2:          00:00:58       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:00:59       Um, you basically telling me don't become happy. That's what you saying dope. Dope. And get to happy. What are you going to go do it? You're gonna walk around. You're going to get some sandals. Really? You fucking toes hanging out or whatever. Do where some fucking clam diggers.

Speaker 2:          00:01:18       MMM,

Speaker 1:          00:01:20       no, it's just nice. I went back there and I, uh, you know, I'm one of these fucking La people now. I don't really have a winter coat coat. I have a pea coat. Um, it was funny. This one was breaking my balls. Tell me it wasn't a real one because I didn't get it at the army navy store. It's like those fucking things that's like wearing thick pajamas. Pico doesn't work the second it's below like, you know, 40 degrees. It's one of those myths that, you know what, it's got a mid range jumper. That's what, that's all that fucking code has. You know what I mean? It can't run. The court doesn't play any fucking day. It's too fucking hot. You know, once you get to like 58 degrees, it's too fucking hot to wear that coat. Way Too hot. 55 write that code basically exists from about 39 degrees to maybe 51 you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:02:10       If you get a decent one, forget a decent one. Like I bought a diesel. Actually Nia bought me a decent one, but she used my money to do it. So you know what I mean? Technically, I mean, you know, she fucking use my money so I guess I bought it. You know, I guess I do have an assistant. It's my wife who has access to all my funds. You got to do that with your wife, you know what I mean? Just give her access to all your funds. It just gives you so much leverage in an argument. Just use that next time, you know? But the sheer ube you a to a, you were snoring. Just honey, honey, you have access to all of my funds. Do you understand that you have access to all my funds. I go to an airport in leave, leave you with access to. I don't. I don't want, I don't even know what I'm going to come back to it. Was there even going to be anything here now? What is the problem with the fucking glass that I didn't wash that always make me out? Like she's a Nag. She really isn't. She really isn't, but it's just, um,

Speaker 3:          00:03:15       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:03:15       I guess it's just a fear of, of, you know, being with somebody that can, they can take you for everything. You've got prenup doesn't mean shit out here in California. You know what I mean? You don't have a prenup is in California. That's like when there's a blitz in the fullback, misses the assignment. That's what the Prenup is. You think that fucker's going to pick up that, that fucking Lawrence Taylor wanted to be coming right around the outside. Ah, he must, he's sitting there with happy feet. Where is he? He's buying you and then you get the old right there, Fred. Right. Well, you're fucking Bacchae your helmet. It's the middle of your spine. As you head snaps back. That's what a fucking prenup is out here. So, um, anyways, I don't even want, I'm talking about here. Um, I just get back from New York City.

Speaker 1:          00:04:03       I had such a fucking great time going back there doing the fifth annual Patrice O'Neal benefit right out of the gate. Thank you to everyone that came down to this show. The show was unbelievable. I mean, I wasn't there last year because of the snow I got snowed in. But of the four that I've seen that might have been the strongest show that we've had, we've always had strong shows. But there was something about that show was like the perfect level of, um, of his friends of new guys that were influenced by him and just the ball break. And that was going on during the fucking show. Uh, Jesus Christ, Rich Vos making fun of Keith Robinson fucking

Speaker 1:          00:04:47       what's his face? I think Norton of course, no one had the best line. He was talking about how funny Keith was. He goes, you should have had a stroke 15 years ago. He goes, I don't understand how Keith had his stroke and he still talks. He still eat well, easier to understand than rich vos. Those are probably two of the best ones in Voss. Had like this stupid fucking, he had like this Paisley shirt from like the early nineties like every drum instructional video that I bought from the early nineties where they didn't have those jazz guys who are such good musicians, you know, you get so good that your music sucks. After a while they were playing like that. I'm 94 seven the way, hey, that's smooth jazz shit. You know he had one of those shirts and then he had like a fucking Justin Timberlake does fucking bing Crosby, one of those fucking hipster hats that even hipsters stop wearing those things like 10 years ago and it was blue on blue. So we were backstage, you know, all of us fucking jaded people are gone now. Rich, it looks good now you should wear it because he wasn't sure about it. And Pete Davidson, the new kid, right? New Kid. He's already on fucking SNL. It's how old I am. He's, he was actually telling rich going, you rich, you can't wear that. It looks terrible. And I was fine. Like page shut up.

Speaker 1:          00:06:08       The whole game is that we know it looks. Don't tell him that. And he just started laughing. Then he went along with it and I believe he took it off his head at the end, at the end of his set. We had such a great time and everybody fucking killed, um, right out of the gate. We had Dan soda went up first after Voss and, um, he went up there and absolutely just fucking murdered. It was like he, he'd been doing it in theaters his whole life. Keith Killed Pete Davidson destroyed, even though he did this whole bit about there's no excuse to go bald. That kind of bugged me, um, in this day and age saying there was enough medicine out there with something like that. Then Jim Norton crushed. Then it was David Tell and then Leslie Jones. And um, then, then I had to mop up in the end after all those guys fucking killing man. It was awesome. And thank you. Of course, to Maureen Taren, who's the real force behind the whole thing. She puts the whole thing together. She gets all as a d d comic somehow to show up at the same place at the right time every year.

Speaker 4:          00:07:13       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:07:14       She deals with all the finances of, of renting out the place. She deals with the whole fucking thing. I'm so special thanks to her and let, once again, everybody that came out, everybody at the stand, you know, Dave and Chris down at the stand for always hooking us up with the after party and all that shit. I'm just had a great fucking time and that's it. All right. Um, until we do it again next year.

Speaker 4:          00:07:39       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:07:41       It really is my phone. I gotta be honest. It's my favorite fucking Gig of the year. It's so much fucking fun cause I get none of these guys ever get to work with them now because they all headline now if I get to see him again, it's just such a fucking great time. Jim Florentine just came down to hang out. I'm trying to make sure I remember everybody, but it was, uh, it was great. And I was in New York for a couple of days and um, had a great time. Like the first night, Monday night, I just went out and I started hitting all these clubs that I used to. Uh, you know, I used to work out in, back in the day when I lived in New York, I went to Caroline's first.

Speaker 4:          00:08:14       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:15       And uh, jumped on this show and um, you know, I was waiting to go on and as always, you know, he was always end up seeing somebody funny comedian Carmen Lynch, who I've seen a bunch of times before, but I hadn't seen her in awhile. I'm not going to tell you the bit, but she did some bit that was fucking hilarious. And I believe she's going to be on Stephen Colbert this Friday night and she told me she was going to be doing the bit, the bit's basically about, um, people that can sleep through anything. Um, so anyways, I went up and I have, I just go on stage and I do the shit that I'm working on and some older shit that I'm bringing back. Then I'm putting a new spin on and it was just wire to wire this perfect fucking set. I was taping it.

Speaker 1:          00:08:57       You know, I have a 0.2% chance that we'll actually go back and listen to it. But the fact that I'm recording it makes me feel good. Right. And I was actually going to listen to it because I got these gigs coming up in Phoenix. Right. I gotta get my shit together and this set ends and for whatever fucking reason, I never touched the phone. It just shut off after like two minutes. I'm like, he gotta be fucking kidding me. So then I go up to the car, but I still felt great, you know? And um, I was like, oh, I remember, I remember the shit. So I got to the comic Strip, um, which was my home club when I first got to New York, way back in the day with Lucian, the late Great Lucian Holt, we would sit there and go sit there. You'd walk in and be like, hey yo, Aleutian neoma but comedian, I just moved down from Boston.

Speaker 5:          00:09:50       Yeah. I already have enough white guys.

Speaker 1:          00:09:54       He would literally say that

Speaker 5:          00:09:56       I already have enough void guys.

Speaker 1:          00:09:58       And I remember all these white guy comics would get so fucking mad. It'd be like, you see, you see, it's the same thing. There's fucking reverse facing me. It's like, no, it isn't. It isn't. You know what the fuck he's saying he has a million of you and if you're just going to be another fucking white guy that grew up in a fucking Culdesac, he already has it. It's like it's a grocery store. All right? And he's got, he's got fucking ears of corn stacked up to the fucking, you know, sailing and you come and you want to buy a Bushel. Now I don't, you got eat chickpeas. They're freckles. Right. So I knew what he meant when he said it. It's like, don't come in here and just be doing the, uh, what's the deal with shit. So I remember what he said that to me, I just was a little frustrated, but I just said to myself, I'll get in here.

Speaker 1:          00:10:42       I'll get in here eventually. But um, oh man, I remember there's so many fucking white dude comics would get so mad at that. Um, you could never say that to another fucking group of people. It's like, yeah, but it's white on white so he can get away with it. You know what I mean? Like black people can say fucked up shit to each other. It's, he can keep it in house. It's like your family. You can say whatever the fuck you want. You're still going to sit down for Thanksgiving together. You have to your family. You know what I mean? It's the same fucking thing. I remember exactly where I was. I just remember him smiling and nodding and he closed his eyes and I was like, oh my God, this guy is actually an open person. You know, I'd love to get a spot here and he's smiling, nodding. I'm like, here comes, maybe he's going to give me a phone number of seven.

Speaker 5:          00:11:25       I already have an old white guys.

Speaker 1:          00:11:30       I was sitting there with my stupid backpack just walking away. We used to always use the reference of bill Bixby at the end of the hulk. You know, when he would just be walking down the road. That sad piano music. That's how I left the club. But, um, I had my little positive fucking things that I would say to myself to, uh, to get me to, you know, to go over to the next club. Who the fuck was over at stand up York back in the day. He was a good dude. I remember he had a dead tooth, that's all I remember. And I would, I would go in there

Speaker 4:          00:12:01       and, um,

Speaker 1:          00:12:03       he didn't sugarcoat it. It off. When I walked up to him, I remember telling him that I was a new comic and the look of fucking pain on his see, just sort of looked up like I was talking to the side of his head and he just looked up and he just made this, this face, literally like he had a major operation then they were, this is the first time they were removing the bandages. That was the look on his face when I talked to him. I think I actually petered out through the sentence as like, Hey, uh, what was the name of, hey, so and so, uh, my name is Bill Berber community, just moved down from New York and I just want to, yeah. And then I just fucking walked away.

Speaker 1:          00:12:43       So all these years later to still be able to go back to New York and walk into these clubs and they still know who I am and they'll actually put me on stage. The thrill of that and the privilege of that is never fucking gone away. So anyways, so I go to, I go to, uh, the comic strip, you know, and now I'm feeling all cocky because I just had a great set. So, I mean, all the years that I've done this, I never see the bomb coming after that. You know, I'm feeling all fucking good about myself. I'm like, I'm gonna go up. We're going to do it. Just like I did it at Caroline's, it's going to come out perfectly. It's going to be fucking, you know, minted into my brain and this is going to be a nice cornerstone to start this next fucking hour. Right. And of course, I go in there, nobody's paying attention, small crowds, somebody ordering and, and, and I don't know what was going on.

Speaker 1:          00:13:36       It was this giant group of people right in the front. And they, I think they just, I basically deduced that they all just had the ideal childhood and they couldn't relate to anything I was saying. And I basically had to start over after every single joke. And of course, that was the, the show. One of my friends came out to see me and, um, I didn't bomb, but it was like, I just, it was, you know, you know, those days weren't just, nothing's going right. That's like what it was, except it was in 15 minutes set. You know, I tell a joke, it would work and then I try to build on that momentum and then someone would be ordering really loud and then I'd have to stop and then it start over. It was just a, it was just one thing after fucking nother. So it's like Jesus Christ. So then I get in a cab, and this is a great thing about New York. You can do like a zillion spots jumped in a cab and I went down to the New New York comedy club.

Speaker 4:          00:14:30       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:14:31       It used to be run by Al Martin and they redid the whole fucking thing. And, um, that was a place that I did not have any good memories of for the first fucking three years that I went there. Not Three years, but that, that place of all the places I went to his heart as the Boston Comedy Club, the new comedy club was the one that made me contemplate packing up my shit and going home. That fucking place was the land of the misfit toys fucking comedians. And that was one of those comedy clubs where you walked in and there was like a hundred headshots on the wall and none of not one picture was of anybody that made it. I just remember thinking shit like that. The punchline in Atlanta used to be like that Jamie Bendel runs it right. I used to say Jamie, for the love of fucking God, at least near when you walk on the stage, can you have some head shots here of people that actually were successful?

Speaker 4:          00:15:33       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:15:34       they had like the head shot of every fucking comedian, whoever tried to fucking make it and they left it up on the wall. I mean, some of them came, turned out to be big time writers and producers, but you don't know that. You only know the performers.

Speaker 4:          00:15:45       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:15:47       So the New York Comedy Club was like that times like fucking 30. And um, oh my God, did I have some brutal fucking sets in their brutal sets? That's the first place I saw Mike Machete. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:16:02       Oh man, that, that place. But anyway, so they did a whole facelift on that place. And like it was funny, like psychologically I went back to where I was when I first, um, was coming down in New York and I went in and I sort of recognize the place. It was still sorta the same floor plan and uh, it was a great club. They had, it was the lobby had happy, hopeful colors, painted on the walls and shit. And I went up and ended up having a great set there. Um, and then after that I went over to the stand and then after that I, I, I met up with Verdesian Derosa and some other people we hung out. And, uh, it was just, it was perfect. It was just like, I remember this, this is what fucking living in New York was aside from me being chilly.

Speaker 4:          00:16:48       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:16:49       It was perfect. And then early in the day I found a place where I could play drums at some rehearsal spot. So it was like, it was like the perfect fucking day and then like an Asshole,

Speaker 1:          00:17:00       I stayed out til like three, three 30 in the fucking morning drinking like an idiot, like a fucking idiot. Woke up the next day. I felt like shit I didn't eat for like the first 12 hours of the day. And then what do I have to start? I have a fucking burger and fries. I was trying to go my whole time not getting a slice of pizza in New York cause I always do that because all the pizza out here fucking sucks. Even the shit that's good sucks compared to a pizza on the east coast. And I finally gave in after the Patrice benefit and went to this place right next to the stand and I was like, I'm just going to get one slice. And then I walked in, I was like, oh, that one looks good too. And then I got to burn the shit out of the fucking roof of my mouth.

Speaker 1:          00:17:45       I remember sitting there just going like, Bill, just let him cool off. Just let him off. I'm like, well maybe I'll just, maybe we'll just take a little, you know when you try to go in like, you know you'd ever see like the runt of the litter trying to nurse off the mom just kind of, kind of, kind of going on. I was going in like that, I just still burn the shit out of my mouth and kept fucking shoving it down my pie hole. So anyways, I could not have had a better fucking time. And um,

Speaker 4:          00:18:12       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:18:12       I gotta tell you man that, that Patrice benefit, like we definitely have our work cut out for us.

Speaker 4:          00:18:18       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:18:20       For next year. We already have a couple of people in mind that we're going to try to get to it, um, to get on the show next year. So there you go. So that said, can you tell him typing in my password? Cause the whole fuck, I just start talking like half a mile an hour. And of course I didn't type it in. Right on. Sorry. The Mike sliding down my chest here. There we go. All right, let's move on here. Um, let me see here. Oh, for God's sakes, I already lost. I was going to try to hide my youtube page. I don't even know where the fucking link is anymore. Um, all right. Can I read a little bit of advertising here? Now that we're halfway through and after the advertising, I'm going to tell you, I called in a certain person's, um, radio. Should it die today? Radio show today or should a radio show today I called in coach k and Dave syms basketball and beyond show that's going to be airing tonight.

Speaker 4:          00:19:17       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:19:17       February 23rd at 6:00 PM on a Sirius XM channel 84. Uh, the Sirius Xm college channel.

Speaker 4:          00:19:28       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:19:29       But you know what's funny, I can't even fucking listen to it because I was driving my Jaguar Jackie as I call it, drives my wife nuts. The Beautiful Jackie driving her down the street. I did a spot at the store. This is before I went to New York. It's been raining like crazy out here and I was driving turned down Laci and ago.

Speaker 4:          00:19:50       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:19:50       And I'm cruising along and then I just hit him. Boom. Out of nowhere it felt like I drove over something metal and immediately the dashboard lights up, check air pressure in the car and at the front right tire and ended up pulling into the gas station down there. And I had a blown out the front fucking tire. I swear to God my Prius could have taken that hit, you know. But now I got the fucking sexy tires on the fucking Jaguar. Oh my God. Adversity, right? Totally just fucking implodes.

Speaker 4:          00:20:19       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:20:21       So then I was like, alright, you know, I had the locking lugs on it and shit and I'm like off fuck did did please tell me I got that thing in the glove box, which I did. I called AAA, you know, I got the spare out and everything and I was looking at the Jack and all that type of shit. And it just, I was too afraid to, things I paid for AAA, so I'm going to have someone change a tire. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:20:44       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20:45       And then secondly, I was too afraid to because the car is low to the ground. I didn't want to stick it underneath the fucking car and God forbid if I fucking miss the a frame, you know, which I did a long time ago. Granted I was absolutely shit faced as with a friend of mine was the 80s, you know, we were drinking and driving and um, broad daylight. He gets a fucking flat and I went to Jack it up and I put the Jack underneath basically the floorboards and just put it right through the car. Um, so anyways, they ended up changing the tire and everything. So I had that awful spare tire and now my car is getting fixed. I took it over there cause I want to make sure I didn't fuck up to spit suspension because I ran over the crater with my back right tire too.

Speaker 1:          00:21:31       So, um, long story short, I came home that night. My wife fucking gave me the little emasculating shot. She's like, I can't believe you didn't do it yourself. And I was like, oh, well, you know, I mean, I mean I could if I wanted to. I mean, I have, you know, I just, you know, I got AAA. So I mean, you know, back in the day I used to, uh, I used to change tires. You know, I, I'll never forget this day, started telling this story about how I change the tire on my fucking Ford Ranger on the driver's side, on the side of route one 28 at three in the morning and how I fucking jacked it up and I forgot to loosen the lug. So I had to bring it back down again to take it off. And, uh, and I realized the entire time I was telling her that it was because I was embarrassed that I felt like she questioned my man who, like, I was some pussy that I called Aaa.

Speaker 1:          00:22:15       But I do have to tell you this, I actually, um, even if I knew exactly what the fuck I was doing, all I had was that little right angle fucking, you know, thing to take the lugs off. And I just assumed that they had overtalked the fucking thing. And then there was no way I was going to get that off unless they had another piece of pipe to get the leverage, which is what I learned back in the day with the old lady three Ford Ranger. But the guy showed up, he goes, no, he goes, they tighten these by hand now, or at least to do a Jaguar. And he just took it off like butter. And I was just like, oh Jesus, maybe I could've done this. So now I'm obsessed with the fucking weird as Jack that's in the trunk of my car. I should probably know how to do that.

Speaker 1:          00:22:57       You know? Hey, you know what? Maybe my wife was right. Maybe I am a pussy. I Dunno. Let's fucking, uh, you can't change your own tie. Your fucking Mary. All right.

Speaker 1:          00:25:10       You know about left, right? It's the APP that gets you a riding two minutes on demand 24, seven for less than the cost of a cab. Please include all of the following points during your read. Well, of course I'm going to you fucking put them here. I can say saint, don't skip any. Um, if you tried Lyft, you know what I mean? With Lyft, you can just download the APP request to drive driver and they show up in three and a half minutes. On average. That's really fast. He just fucking said two minutes. They have to get you right. Oh, he said in minutes. Not two minutes. Sorry. My apologies to everybody had lift.

Speaker 1:          00:25:50       Every Lyft driver is fully vetted through that 10 point safety standard, including criminal in DMV background checks. You'll know you'll get around quickly and safely, safely, unlike at that other one that rhymes with boober. They don't give a shit as long as you have a face and a fucking car. Right? Well, you need hands and feet basically that if you have the basics of being a human being, they don't give a shit stand there with a bloody ax. When he got a hatchback, right. Lift drivers are rated after every ride. It's the only the best stick around. That's hilarious. I just picture people getting cut in August before the football season. I'm sorry man. I'm sure. I'm sure you'll catch up. You'll catch on over at Uber. Uh, you don't have to worry about getting into a filthy car with some creepy dude with Lyft.

Speaker 1:          00:26:39       You can tip in the APP, which is obviously leads to happier drivers. I mean, nine out of 10 Lyft rides get a perfect five star rating from the passengers. It's just a better all around experience. Plus there's a lot of people that are just too mean to not do that. You know what I mean? I think four is more legit than a five. You know what I mean? Five is just like, hey, you know what I mean? You got me, they're good for you. A I'll do you a solid, give you a five. You know what I mean? Five would you get a fucking hand job there? He must have hit the bucket seats right? Um, it can reach back and give you a little fucking a little helper. What's with you tonight? You're so relaxed. I'll tell you I'm loving left. Um, bigger isn't always better.

Speaker 1:          00:27:24       Lift isn't the biggest ride sharing app, but it's the fastest growing in the highest rating. One, I'm talking quality over quantity. Thanks to lift. You got an easy way to avoid drunk driving. You never have to bum a ride. You never have to worry about parking. A lot of people are actually getting ride a ride, getting rid of their car, sorry. And relying on Lyft to get around. Are a lot of people doing that? What exactly is that number of percentage? That's a word I use in a fucking argument. Who said that? A lot of people, and you know what? I don't blame them evidently. Uh, right now Lyft is offering our listeners a special deal. Get three free rides, up to $10 each. That's up to a $30 value when you enter my Promo Code Bill Burr. Just download the free Lyft APP and enter Promo Code Bill Burr in the payment section.

Speaker 1:          00:35:17       All right? Then he'd be right up fucking against the chain link fence, right his nose poking through one of the holes and you've got to hand him the script and then he'd be like, I'm sorry you gotta go through the proper channels. It's just the way it works. Okay, so now you're on your way over to Scientology won't go and Cook Donk Donk. Donk. Donk, donk, donk, donk. Right. You fucking Paul and Dave tether too. Right?

Greg, you know something like, Dad, look at that. I gave you a fucking idea from will be, I told you who to sell it to. Oh Shit. Call it into the podcast. A Paul Versey, you're on the Monday morning podcast. I got you on speaker. It's Thursday. Was it Thursday afternoon? Just before Friday. Monday morning. Podcast, podcast listeners. And yet guess what Paula, just checking in on you. Oh Nice. Nice. How's it going up there? It's going great, Paul. I got to talk to coach k today.

Speaker 7:          00:36:40       I do. I says, fucking nuts. So did you, did he say anything about that loss last night?

Speaker 1:          00:36:47       Uh, I asked him really quickly, I said, what's it like as a coach to lose a game on a last second bank in three point shot, like fucking 10 feet behind the arc. I go, does that kill you as a coach? And he said, no. He said, no. You know what kills me is having six fast breaks in the first half and not, not getting any points on those. And it's a classic. Afterwards I thought about it. It's just like, yeah, he doesn't sweat the stuff he can't control, but it's stuff that you can control that you should follow through on so that the Eagle people, there's a little teaser if you want to listen tonight. Oh, an ex Sirius XM channel 84 at 6:00 PM.

Speaker 7:          00:37:29       That's fucking awesome. Jelly. She didn't ask us something stupid. I would have asked him something stupid. I would've been like, what was it like coaching, like acting like the kids are bigger than him. I was like, what? You like coaching Christian later? Uh, that's so cool. Was He cool though?

Speaker 1:          00:37:45       Yeah. No, he didn't talk. He was totally cool. I have an idea of if I ever get him on the podcast, I know how I'm going to interview him, but that, that I'm not going to give away. I'm, I'll tell you afterwards. I got a great idea on how to interview him because I figured he's been asked the same thousand basketball questions a million times over and I met, my goal would be to do an interview and try to see, you know, just

Speaker 7:          00:38:08       ask you to know it. Yeah, I know you're going to be like us. So what do you think of cars? You start making it right.

Speaker 1:          00:38:14       It'd be a little more involved in that. I wouldn't have them know. What do you think? A car is he going? I don't know. I take one of the fucking venue. You idiot. I drive white. Yeah. I drive one at drive one all the time. Hey Dude, I got to a, I gotta I gotta call you right back because I need to wrap this podcast up and then I got to go, uh, be daddy daycare. All right. Hey Paul. That's exactly what I'm going to do. Okay. It's a pleasure. Always a pleasure, Paul. Especially since we're across the country, Bill. Oh, you know, God bless you. God bless you and everything that is that you do.

Speaker 1:          00:38:44       I'll see. Um, anyways, so there you go. Hey, look at that. The first fucking call and see I had the technology, everybody tries to get these fucking DSL lines of whatever the fuck they are. UPS Shit. Oh, you do is you just put your iPhone on speaker and you hold it up to the mic. I think it gives it more of a quality sound. You know, all these fucking shows. They try to make it sound like the person's in the room. They're not in the room. They're calling me on a cell phone. A God damn it. That's what it's going to sound like. Bunk call, call, call, call. Um, all right. So there you go. Somebody fucking right. Then somebody write that movie and go make a bunch of, go make a bunch of money. Go loiter around an airport Cli. You can fucking do that.

Speaker 1:          00:39:27       Um, all right, I think that's it right? Oh, so this is what I learned the second, third, third time I was on stage. It's The New York comedy club. I forgot to tell you. I'm fucking doing my set and now it's going great. I'm having a great set. By the way, I didn't have a good senate, the comic strip, and of course the recorded in shut off. I'm having a great fucking Senate in New York and I looked down and Paul verse, he's calling me, I'm like, oh, what the fuck? Then I go, wait a minute. I go, does the fucking recorder shut off? If somebody calls millennials, can you help me out? And they were all like, yes, it shuts off. And I go, does it come back on after the call? And somebody said, yes. Well guess what? It doesn't. It shuts off. So to all you comedians out there, if you take an ascent, if you feel in it, you know, you might want to reach over and fucking put it in airplane mode in case your mother calls, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:40:19       Then you got to give a shit. You know? Thanks a lot Ma. You ruined my new Dick. Joke. Um, all right, that's the podcast for this week. Um, not the podcast. Just me checking in on you. Enjoy the music. Now you've got another half hour. Is Shit coming your way? That's a, I dunno. It's, it's, it's some greatest hits stuff from a podcast, from a, I don't know, a time gone by. So when I say, and here's my youtube channel, by the way. Um, let's see here. It's youtube.com/user/monday morning podcast. And guess what? I'm going to start making fucking videos and I'm going to upload it. I finally, you know, I never videotaped the fucking podcast. I'm going to start making videos, putting it up there, starting when I go to Phoenix, I'm going to start doing the tours of the cities again. Um, I got some other ideas of some shit that I can do, um, to add to the channel and finally try and build that stuff up. Um, so that's it. Once again, thank you to everybody who did the Patrice benefit. Rich Foss, Dan Soder, Keith Robinson, Pete Davidson, Jim Norton, David Towl, Leslie Jones, and Maureen Taren for putting the whole fucking thing together. And uh, thank you to everybody who came out. We will do it again next year and I think I already know who I'm going to

Speaker 7:          00:41:34       reach out to to try to get on the show. That's it. Go fuck yourselves. I'll talk to you on Monday.

Speaker 2:          00:42:10       [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          00:42:31       Hey, what's up man? It's the Monday morning podcast and I'm going to be multitasking this week. How right in fuck it. Heating up some pizza and that's what I'm having for breakfast. I know he's supposed to have it cold like those douchebags on ESPN. Um, but I'm not gonna actually in our area ball oatmeal and now I'm fucking hungry so I'm going to have some teacher. Isn't that interesting? If it like that website that you guys are all going on a fucking a kitty fuck.com. What can they do? That thing where you, where you, uh, celebrities go on there and they, uh, what the hell they do. You know, they type in a, you know, 1:48 PM just tied my left sneaker. Is that, what the fuck are they giving ends with a t how many shut me a, uh, an email the other day about that type of shit.

Speaker 7:          00:43:28       You know, seeing if I wanted to join their, uh, their, their website about whatever that stuff is, you know, it wouldn't really help if I actually had the name of the website, which I don't, of course, which I don't. Um, but anyways, this is the Monday morning podcast. Does that make any sense? Does it ever make any sense? You know, a lot about this podcast is, it's fucking free, so you can never complain about it. Although people don't people to bitch about the podcast and, uh, people take it seriously sometimes. It's amazing. I'll do like 50 minutes a shit say, and some of the most ignorant stuff you're probably gonna hear all day, if not the whole week. You know, if you hang out with really smart people and people, they send me emails, like really taking me, I've got a lot of like condescending emails this week.

Speaker 7:          00:44:17       Uh, that were really just, I dunno, people haven't bummed or I guess I'm really coming off like a moron, you know, which I openly admit that I am. And also that, you know, I'm just fucking joking around. Some people, they, they, they, they take it real seriously. I'm really trying to fucking scroll down to this. I actually have, you know, which, uh, actually because of it has made me create a, a, a new part of the podcast. You know, at this point, if you're new to my podcast, what I do is I, uh, people send me questions every week. I try to answer them to the best of my ability. We have the overrated, underrated lists, people's lists of things in life. Either of, I dunno, entertainers or ra can openers, whatever the fuck you want. Anything that you think is overrated, underrated, and a, I got an movie reviews.

Speaker 7:          00:45:06       That's something else. Then we got something else. Here's the new thing. Douche bag of the week. All right. This guy sent me a, uh, an email last week. I was talking about nature out here and the seasons and the fires and all that type of shit. Just bullshitting, just trying to fill up 50 minutes, you know, trying to help somebody out, sitting in a cubicle or some fucking job that they don't want, that they're on their way out. And this fucking asshole decides to take me seriously. Right. I says, what are your rights deer farmer bill listening to you talk about nature soil in Los Angeles. Los Angeles is seasonal fires made me put your intelligence on the overrated list. Fires don't just happen. Are you banking your whole argument on the theory of spontaneous combustion? Some Douche flicks a lit cigarette out the window and there you go. Yeah, the trees and the foliage gets brown and dry out, but they don't just explode.

Speaker 7:          00:46:05       Do you actually think we should just let the fire burn? Can you believe all this fucking guy? Like I think trees just explode. Like I really think that they should just let the fucking hills burn and have people's houses burned down and that the, you know, they're rich people. So who gives a fuck? I mean there's a guy have any sort of concept that in comedy, if you just say something that's really fucking ridiculous and over the top, the shock of it. What the very least bring a smile to somebody's face unless you take it fucking seriously. Jesus Christ. That's one of my favorite lines ever. Fires don't just happen. Really? I just thought they just happened. Trees don't just spontaneously combust. You know what a con, you know what I'm saying? Oh look at my pizza done all that was fucking quick. You know what?

Speaker 7:          00:46:58       I didn't stick it in the microwave. I don't like the microwave because it's something Keith Richards set a fucking funny as that. One time I read a quote where Keith Richards says, I don't use, I don't use cell phones cause you, you know you might as well stick your head in a microphone, a microwave. And that kind of killed two pieces of technology for me. But I need my cell phone so I still use that. So I try not to use the fucking microwave. When you think about it, there's something just not right about it, you know? So I'm using the old thing. I used the fire in the stove that just happened. You know, it just so happened that when I put my pizza in there, that might stove, you know, spontaneously combusted Jesus fucking Christ people when you listen to these podcasts, no, that I don't read and know that when I really say something stupid that I'm just joking.

Speaker 7:          00:47:50       Just fucking around. You don't need to waste 10 minutes of your day trying to show me how fucking intelligent you are about how you understand how fires are started. I like how you went with the hacky lit cigarette out the window. Oh, maybe he's just making fun of my intelligence there. No wait. He thought I thought things spontaneously combust. I don't fucking know. But he gets douche bag of the week. Okay. All right. I don't mind when I do standup on TV. If somebody you know, sends me an email and says, you know, I just thought your comments about rescue dogs, but completely ridiculous. I wish abortion was retroactive. You know, just kind of shut up emails I've gotten. I understand that because those people are fans of mine. They don't know what it is that I do, but I figure if it listened to my podcast, you realize, did I say a lot of over the top stupid shit?

Speaker 7:          00:48:41       And I don't mean any of it. All right? So you don't really need to fucking send me emails. Just, you know, what I'm really trying to do is save your time. I'm actually thinking about you. Look at me. Be in the modern. Uh Huh. Just like Mother Teresa was actually talking to this comedian yesterday. This Guy Doug Davidoff. He's fucking hilarious. If you ever get a chance to see him. Uh, he was talking to some how would keep came around and we'd talking about Mother Teresa and he said to me that evidently one at a time, she was talking about poverty in the world and she said something to the effect of, uh, the worst poverty she's ever seen was, I think in India. And the second worst was actually right here in America and was basically saying that, um, the poverty of the spirit in America is staggering. And you know, which really made me wish she was still alive. So I could just slap that fucking none head. Right. But none hat right off her fucking head.

Speaker 7:          00:49:44       I am so sick of fucking people trashing America, you know, acting like where they live is this fucking great place. Okay. Now I haven't hit all the countries. All right? But I've been to Australia, I've been to Canada. This is pathetic. I've, I went to Ireland. They're the same fucking people. They, they, they haven't figured out what life is all about. I went into fucking Ireland. It's a Wednesday night in the pub is packed with fucking people. Okay. Those, that's people's dads in there who should be at home tossing a machete lately or whatever the fuck they supposed to do as a dad over there and then not fucking there. So if they really understood, you know, what makes you happy in life? Oh my God. Did my computer just fucking crash?

Speaker 7:          00:50:36       Oh fuck. This is the day that I've been dreading. This is the day that I, I kept putting off, I'll buy a laptop next month. I buy one next month. Don't do this to me, baby. Come on. We've been through too much. Wow. To anybody out there go to computers. My screen just went, I'd sort of a blue black and all the typing is now in yellow. I can still read it. Oh, what do I do? I hold the power button down. We try to reboot it. Fucking is getting cold. This is just a cluster fuck whatever. I don't, I don't need the fucking questions. I'll just keep going. You know what I mean? Because sometimes in life that's what you want me to get back to mother Theresa. You know what I to fucking candy. You know what I mean? Yeah. And I know that sac religious to say that shit, but you know, she did too much shit when everyone else was looking. You know what I mean? That's why I never liked about her say when don't they have that saying in the Bible there's another book I never read. I tried to, it's just fucking, you know, it's like update the language already, you know? And these set it to thou, I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. I just, you just really, I'm sick of fucking people acting like people in Canada are happier than people in America or England. Those miserable motherfuckers. They can't even go to a soccer game without killing each other.

Speaker 7:          00:52:11       Fucking Mother Teresa and she just, you know, did you sue big live spiritually? Jesus Christ? I'd just like to take a fucking pie and throw right in her face. I wish I was the one to interviewing her when she said, that's right. You know what might you go fucking hang out with a leper so we can see how fucking great you are. Fucking what a downer. You mentioned she showed up at your party and just sitting there looking at everybody just judging everyone how fucking holy she is. I wonder where she ended up in the afterlife. You know, just harder sell out or what a great fucking person she was. I gotta tell you, man, I don't buy it.

Speaker 7:          00:52:57       I don't fucking buy it. Everybody's got something. All right. Hanging out with lepers and all sudden you can fucking trash America. You can jump on that Fucking Bandwagon, Huh? Why don't you go make somebody some cookies. Do what old women are supposed to be doing. All right? They're making cookies with bill, with his grandma's hands playing in the background. Okay, and until then, shut in your face. This is the way I like to do on my podcast. I like to trash dead saints. Is she a sanctuary? She'll become a saint. That's what the fuck she was trying to do. You know what it really was? She was a psycho who couldn't fucking, she couldn't sustain a relationship. That's what it was. And she basically, you know, just being famous, which is what most Americans want, wasn't enough for her. She wanted to be fucking world famous.

Speaker 7:          00:53:50       So she traveled all around the world. Ooh, look at me. Look at me. Oh, there's some kids stuck in a mud puddle. I'm pulling them out. I don't even care if my none gown gets dirty. That's how fucking holy I am. Wait, did you run out of tape? Did you run a tape and the camera? Let me, let me pause and wait for you to film that. Put the kid back in the puddle spiritually fucking bankrupt. You know? First of all, I don't need you to fucking tell me that Mother Teresa. I know how fucked in the head I am. Okay. Sitting there racking like you're tapped into some sort of higher fucking power. He got a lot of fucking balls, a lot of fucking balls. All right. Now that I'm down to the crust on my pizza, let me see, um, see if I can reboot this fucking thing. You know what sucks? Is there so many fucking great questions this week? So many great fucking emails while this thing is not even responding, this is just flat lining.

Speaker 7:          00:54:49       You fucking cunt. Don't do this to me. Don't do this to me. Higher cubs, it's coming back up. I know there's a lot of religious people listening to this shit going while you just trashed mother Theresa. The fuck was that. Okay? Oh, here we go. See that now by the trees were so fucking holy. The way I just trashed, or Mike, my computer went to reboot it or maybe she's just be in the moderate again. She's up in heaven. She's going, no, it's okay. It's okay. Let us computer work. I don't need, I don't need you to fucking help Terry.

Speaker 7:          00:55:28       All right. I know I'm eating. This is fucking really rude, but you know I have to carb up before I do. These podcasts are so fucking long at this point. Um, all right, whatever. Oh, here's one that someone actually sent me that I remember. You know, you know every week when I go on and on about how you should shop at mom and pop store, just go blow out this great fucking point when she's like, you know what? I've tried to go into those mom and pop places and a lot of times I, you know, I can, I can't even do this. I'm not going to paraphrase it because it's such a fucking great slam on what the hell. I said, I don't want to row. I don't want to ruin it. All right? What can I talk to you guys about is I wait for my fucking ancient computer to boot up.

Speaker 7:          00:56:11       Oh, here we go. Oh, this is getting exciting. Mac Os 10 that's my operating system. You're still using that man. I had it. And like the fourth grade, you're still a loser. All right. What do think about that? What are you fucking base your entire existence on your fucking operating system? You don't even have a camera on your computer now. I don't. Yeah, you jerk off on the Internet. Okay. And someone in the Pentagon watched it. So now you can never be president. What do you think about that? Cause they have that clip and if you do become president, you got to do everything that they say. Oh, we're going gonna take out a fucking video. Uh, you snapping at at 23 years of age.

Speaker 7:          00:56:50       All right, come on. I really, you know, I don't know how long I can sustain this false anger as I wait for the shit. Have I seen any good movies? Oh, it was in Ogden, Utah, this, uh, this weekend and I want to thank everybody who came out to wife, guys and Ogden, Utah. Um, I had a great time and it was one of the most beautiful, a beautiful cities I've ever been to in my life. Just unbelief. I got up in the morning to go down and go do the radio and I'm literally driving down the highway on the entire left hand side as I guess the rocky mountains, but they're like, they're like right there and the sun is just coming up. It's on the other side of the mountain. So there's this orange glow outlining the top of the mountains, which have snow on them.

Speaker 7:          00:57:41       And then below at the foot of the mountains is the city with the lights of the city. I look like a fucking postcard was unreal. Um, you know, see that. I appreciated that. Mother. Teresa, how are you going to criticize that you shouldn't have to about hubs in light of this city. That city is humans. It's dirty. It should just talked about nature. Is that what she sounded like? Did she ever even talk or did you sit there looking sad and judging the fucking media who were filming her? She laid next to somebody with Lupus. Um, all right, here we go. Podcast questions. I think I've trashed Mother Teresa Long enough. I'm glad I did that. You know, I think it was long overdue. Okay. Um, all right. Eventually I'll get to that. Ladies when move. You know what? Why don't I just do the fucking questions here.

Speaker 7:          00:58:33       All right. Oh, you know what? Here's one for you. I was fucking coming out of the airport in Ogden, Utah, which is brutal this time a year, by the way. Okay. And I want to show you guys that I, that I am not afraid of technology, which people start start, I've really started to suggest because I'm so against those automated machines at the, uh, at the supermarkets. But, um, I don't mind him at the airport. I'm not going to lie to you. I really don't. Especially when you're in ski season and Ogun fucking Utah and everybody in front of you is standing in with their fucking skis and an overnight bag. So, you know, when I saw him when I was there, as I take another bite of pizza rudely, hey, you know, why don't you go pay for a podcast? All right? When you think about that, go pay for a fucking podcast.

Speaker 7:          00:59:23       I'm sure the host won't be eating. Don't get indignant with me. All right. I'm fucking hang up on you right now. I'll leave you alone in your cubicle then what are you gonna do? Huh? That's right. Back to the spreadsheet, isn't it? All right then you think about that anyways, sorry. Just had to give a shit at that. Finish that bite. Um, so I'm going through the airport in Ogden, Utah, big long fucking line. All these push. Why I cannot even begin to tell you how fucking white Utah is. It's, it's unreal. Like I was, you know, here like my black friends with, you know, telling Shit, you know, a couple of times had gone, you know, a few of them going back to APP. You know what? They've never said that. And I'm actually thinking of a Richard Pryor bit if I do that. Your Dad was one of a friend of mine.

Speaker 7:          01:00:07       Oh wait a minute with someone famous who said that Richard Pryor did that bit about like, you know, going back to Africa, how all of a sudden was all black people and it was beautiful and all this type of stuff. Like, you know, I was always, I don't want that thinks like, you know what, if you're white goatee, Utah, you'll get that experience. It's fucking unbelievable. It's just, it's, it's awesome. It's just fucking wall wall. Yt it just, you know, and you feel real safe. And then you realize half of them are named Luke and mark and John, all those biblical names. And then you're like, okay, I'm out of here. You know, when you guys get 10% of your income to the Mormon church, you know, I ask those people like, who's the most famous Mormon who is the most, you know, the top Mormon out there?

Speaker 7:          01:00:45       And somebody yelled out to Steve Young, I thought that was fucking hilarious and entire relationship, relationship, entire religion. You know what I mean? You'd think that they would pick somebody who, I dunno, did the Mother Teresa Shit and when they'd pick the fucking, uh, the stand in for Joe Montana got fucking, it annoys me. I don't like Steve Young either. He went on and on about the Patriots fucking cheating. I love that. I think they keep quiet, you know, people question the Patriots. Super Bowl victories because of that video tape thing, which I totally understand, but nobody's questioning the New York Yankees there. Last two fucking world series victory. You know when like three guys were on fucking roids remember Roger Clemens? How fucking roided up with that guy? He threw a ball through. Mike Piazza is bat, the fucking bat end of it comes flying out. I'm like 80 miles an hour.

Speaker 7:          01:01:36       He catches it bare handed and then throws it and he was like the hulk and people are, he's amped up for the game. He was roided out of his fucking tree telling you one of these days I'm going to climb up on New York, the Yankee Stadium. I'm going to fucking erase those last two championships and then they'll only have 24 it'd be still 200 and ahead of the red sox. All right, sorry, I'm just killing time here. All right. Uh, oh. Anyway, so I'm going to the fucking airport and is what they ended up. So there's this big long line of a bunch of Lawrence Welk looking white people. Everybody looks like they play like the trombone or some shit. Right? Um, and uh, so they got this thing on the side. If you want to bypass this is the new thing that they have in airports. Okay. If you want to bypass the long lines and security, you know, if you're not flying first class, if you just some regular Joe who can't afford a first class fucking ticket and you don't want to stand in line, they got this great new piece of technology. We're, all you gotta do is just get fingerprinted and have your retina scan and you can go right by everybody.

Speaker 7:          01:02:43       You know what I love about that and see this one lady in front of me is like, wow, is that how that God, if that how I've found, that's great. That's great. You fucking idiot. Yeah, that's great. Yeah. And then everybody does it, right? And then you standing in the fucking line again and what's it going to be? How it's going to be a little bit quicker and now they have your fucking fingerprint, the fingerprinted, like you committed a felon, whatever. What are you going to do or people be able to, there's going to give into it and then I'll be the last guy not to give into it and then you know what? I'll be standing and the old school life by myself, you know, then I'll be going quicker. No, it's not going to work out. It's kind of like the easy pass. Everybody eventually got the fucking easy pass and then, and then like nine out of 10 lines and now all easy pass. And now I'm fucking sitting there with like nine guys and people don't get your fucking fingerprints taken to get on a God damn plane and get your fucking retina scan. Okay.

Speaker 7:          01:03:41       Jesus fucking Christ. Well, if you're not doing anything wrong, I don't understand what the problem is. I'll see you in the FEMA camp. All right, question bill. Hey Bill. How difficult was it to tell people you wanted to become a comedian when you first started? Um, what were some of the reactions? For me it was like telling them you want it, you want it to be a superhero was at the same for you. I got to tell you something. I did not even a, I never told anybody anybody that I was going to be a comedian. Um, I didn't tell anybody I was even doing it and I didn't let anybody even come and see me until I've been doing it for well over a year. Like it's always amazed me, the people who have the fucking balls the first time they go on stage to do stand up setting yourself up for quite possibly one of the most humiliating things that could ever happen to you other than a fucking prison rape, which is basically to stand in front of a bunch of people and get booed off stage like their first time on stage. Like they would bring the entire office that the people that they work with to come down and see him. It's like how you, you, you can't see the possibilities. It's like dude, they didn't ever think like what if I fucking bomb and then I have to go back to work on Monday and look and no one's going to look me in the eye.

Speaker 7:          01:05:06       You actually going to ruin all their weekends cause they're going to be sitting there worrying what the fuck they're going to say to you on Monday when they come in. But to answer your question, um, yeah, it's, it's a very, uh, it's very hard thing to do in a weird way. You know, it's sort of like a sort of like coming out telling people you're gay I guess can be fucking sense. I'm just know you just kind of like, how am I going to tell my parents that, uh, you know, all that money was spent on college education and now I'm going to go on stage and talk about my Dick.

Speaker 7:          01:05:42       Um, yeah, it was very difficult, but I was, my parents were unbelievably supportive. Thank God. And then maybe I think I in within the first year, I told one of my close friends that I was doing it and I, but I did not, I didn't tell anybody else because I knew what they were. You going to come out and see, you know, you're not doing that. You're not doing that because I bomb horrifically, you know, one out of every four times at this point and I that's just too high a ratio. Some, yeah, I waited a good year. Um, and even then it was just a couple of people shell. Oh, is that a good bite of pizza? Which is really annoying. I'm sorry, I went with the quattro for Romaji so I can have a, that'd be great if I had a fucking heart attack right there in the middle of this podcast, would you guys even know who to call?

Speaker 7:          01:06:37       Would you help me out? You probably wouldn't. You'd probably save it and trying to put it on your website to be the first one. Comedian dies during free podcast. While it'll be hilarious and I die in the first person I see his mother Teresa, just looking at me. Um, all right, Bill, next question. Um, this is such a great question. So is my ex girlfriend, the only con that assumes a breakup is an opportunity to make a fucking pen pal. She writes once a month to let me know what's going on and ask how I'm doing. It's garbage. Who told this bitch that small talk via email starts when the fucking ends. The only note I want to see from this Twat is a suicide note.

Speaker 7:          01:07:26       Ah, God damn it. That fucking email me made me laugh when I read that. Read it late last night. You guys, I'm telling you everything, everybody stepping up their game there, the questions are getting better. You guys are learning how to write. It'll be out of a fucking job here. Um, I'll dude, you don't have to answer the emails. Um, you sound like you're almost as angry as I am. So I'm going to try to go easy here and talk you off the ledge. Um, it's not a bad thing. I mean it, that's kind of, seems like you had a good breakup and she still wants to be friends with Dan. If you can kind of still be friends with them.

Speaker 7:          01:08:04       Um, and you always got to watch out with women. Now you go, he's got to watch out because you know, she might just be staying in contact with you so she can, you know, as she's asking how you're doing subtly, you know, push those buttons in your head that she still remembers the combination too and you know, subtly let you know how good her life is going with the airline pilot that she's fucking now dating or something. You got to watch out for that shit. But if she's just being cool, she sounds like a cool person who maybe every once in a while you could, uh, you know, maybe get a fucking hand job out of. All right, underrated. Um, van Halen is running with the devil. This is the same guy. Uh, he says underrated van Halen running with the devil. When I get my born again, brothers answering machine, I always screamed, Jesus fucking Christ Ansia Goddamn phone.

Speaker 7:          01:08:53       Then I sing running with the devil and laugh. Ah, Jesus. You know, there's not enough people like this guy in the world that's really fucking funny and I can't even read is overrated because he's trashing a comedian. I don't do that on here, but it was, it's fucking hilarious. Um, see what I did there. I probably shouldn't even said that. Now look and read it and I go fuck yourself. I'm not doing that. Might get involved in that biggie. Tupac Shit. All right. Uh, Bill, what's your best relationship? What, what was your best relationship? What was your worst? Jesus Christ. It wasn't my best relationship. Um, probably the one I'm in now because we can have knock down, drag out fights and then the end will end up laughing occasionally. I would say that is the best one because when you're younger, you don't know how to be in a fucking relationship.

Speaker 7:          01:09:44       You know what I'm saying? He just sit there and, yeah, yeah. You know, for me anyways, you let the other person walk all over you and in your head you're like, I don't want to fucking do that. But then you're like, oh, keep it happy or it won't fuck me. And then you just continue to lose ground. And, uh, I had met, I had an argument the other day that it should have been recorded and transcribed and put into every men's magazine out there. It was just one of those fucking arguments. You know, where your girlfriend is in a bad fucking mood and or whatever, thinks you did some shit and she's not thinking about the situation you're in. So she starts giving you shit. And you know, for the first few minutes I took it like, what do I do? Typical Moron guy before I finally flipped out, I seem distant.

Speaker 7:          01:10:32       Yeah. I'm in the middle of fucking nowhere. I mean, you've talked upon for a fucking God damn rednecks out here. Okay. I got up at eight in the fucking morning driving along these fucking mountains. Yeah, I'm a little distance. Okay. Fuck is wrong with you. The fuck is wrong with you. Get leave me alone. Leave me alone. You're being a jerk. I'm watching the bill Maher show talk to you tomorrow and hung up on it. That was it. Was it? Um, you know what? I actually started to tell that argument. I just sort of fucking bailed on it cause that's a little too personal. Um, all right. Well I recently moved from Michigan to go to Grad school at Ucla. I like to see me. This is another fucking quite one. Here we go. Um, I recently moved from Michigan to go to Grad school at Ucla.

Speaker 7:          01:11:26       I haven't met one person that is worth my time in la. Everyone is so fucking fake and thinks that I give a shit about how many calories they've eaten this week. I can't enjoy myself in the nice weather cause I carry these wonderful Midwestern man boobs around with me while even the people that work at Mcdonald's have their shirts off showing off their abs. Are there any cool places to go around La? This is such a great email because this is what it feels like when you first move out to la. Okay? You go with the usual criticism. Oh my God, everybody's still plastic. Everybody's so fight. Everybody's so fake. But the reality is if you really read between the fucking lines, I didn't think you have to with this email is when you move out here, you realize everybody isn't, you know, not everybody, but there's a lot of people who are in great fucking shape and you know you're going to be a fat fuck in Michigan and not even realize it.

Speaker 7:          01:12:24       You know what I mean? Cause he just didn't hurt you. Just a bunch of buffaloes walking across the plane. You don't know. Everybody thinks and then you get out there, you know you get so fucking freaked when you first get that to you actually invent shit. That didn't happen. You know, everyone thinks I give a shit about how many calories they've eaten this week. I love that line because obviously no one came up and said, do you know I've had only 1200 calories this week. It's just you start creating shit in your head, you know, and like the people in Mcdonald's are in such good shape that, you know, to make the point you actually have to act like they took their shirts off. You know, which I know, obviously you're exaggerating for effect, unlike that Douche bag who sent me the fucking thing about the fires out here.

Speaker 7:          01:13:07       Um, relax dude. What's going to happen is you're going to join a gym, okay? You're going to let go of that. You know, it's not minus 3000 degrees out. So, um, actually somehow not living a full life. Relax. You join a gym, you get in better shape, you learn about nutrition and all of a sudden you start feeling better. And then one day it's January and it's fucking 70 degrees out. And you, when your buddies calls from fucking back east and he disliked, you want to be like, dude, you know, you don't have to live like that. You really don't. So there's plenty of cool places to go around Hollywood. Now if you want to, you don't go. You know, if you're in Hollywood on fucking sunset, you might as well be in Times Square in New York City. So, uh, there's plenty of cool places to go to out in la.

Speaker 7:          01:13:55       A lot of outdoor stuff. You could literally take up surfing the fucking beaches. This shit. They got all these mountains around here where you can go hiking. You got all that outdoor stuff, we'll, we'll just melt away those man boobs. Not to mention they got a bunch of hot broads out here. Yeah, there are a little plastic and fake down, but go down to like Hermosa beach. Doesn't that just gorgeous. And they're not trying to be an actress and they got fucking tell me, just, just go to go down there. Okay. Do you get out of the usual fucking Moron riff Raff when you go down there on the beach? That definitely the pit bull guys and the, the Douche bags with their motorcycles and stuff. But believe me, you know, I've seen Detroit, so you really shouldn't be bitching. Um, I guess you wanted literally a list of cool places.

Speaker 7:          01:14:35       Um, I don't know if you've noticed the way I've dressed, I'm not exactly a trendsetter. Um, and I know where there's some cool bars, but I'm not going to say them over my podcast because, um, I don't need 11 of my 14 listeners showing up ruining me, drowning my sorrows in my whiskey. Okay. All right, next one. Bill. Love the podcast. Love you. Stand up. I've decided to follow your lead in the self checkout crusade. I no longer use them anymore because you said because what you said makes sense to me. Jesus. Thank God I only got to some person. I'd like to offer you a deal though. Since I've given up self checkout lanes at grocery stores, all I ask is that you look deeper into paying bills online. I've done it for years with no problems. I love it. I understand your concerns about it, so that's why I merely look.

Speaker 7:          01:15:21       I say merely look into what into it with your bag. It's okay to be skeptical of technology, but don't be skeptical because it's technology. Have a great day. All right, well that was my point earlier. I'm not, you know, I'm not a hundred percent against technology. Obviously. I'm a big fan of penicillin loving the airplane. I'm not. I'm just like, my thing is I don't like technology where you know, they're acting like it's making it easier and what they're really doing is getting a ridiculous amount of personal information on me that they can then use for God knows what, like fingerprinting me and scanning my retina at the fucking airport so I can get on a Goddamn plane, I think goes above and beyond. It goes above and beyond and I know it can easily be explained away by the fucking tour to emails and I'm going to get, you know, and they're all going to be of the same ilk of trusting the psychopaths at the top of the heap.

Speaker 7:          01:16:23       And I just don't, that's it. And as far as, uh, you know, paying your bills online, I mean, the only safety you have is that you, that a bunch of people do it and you're, you're stuck and know you're in the middle of the herd, you know. But if you get to the outside of the hurt and you have that little fucking deer limping or that baby deer, okay, these, you know, I don't know. You can do it. Do it if you want to do it. I'm just saying I don't fucking trust it. I'm not going to put my bank account numbers on. I was mainly talking about banking. I wasn't necessarily talking about paying bills, but even that shit, I just don't like doing it. You know? I don't like doing it. You can do it. Go for it. It's all for you. I don't know.

Speaker 7:          01:17:07       I like the old school, you know, I take out my checkbook. Nobody sees my account numbers. I put it in an envelope, some guy at the post office fucking when no one's looking at opens it up, then he looks at it. Then he's got to do a whole bunch, you know? You know what I'm saying? All I got to worry about, it's the people at the post office. I, you know something, I actually did a little research on this after buddy of mine who was a lawyer and I asked him, what is the number one way people get their identity stolen? And he said, uh, people stealing your mail. And uh, what did he move on? Why did he put it? Miss Miss, miss guided trust or something like that. Basically you try, you know, you're dating some chick and she fucking, you know, you know, you think that she's enjoying you as much as you're enjoying her and she's really just say, oh, whatever.

Speaker 7:          01:17:53       You know what I mean? Somebody at work, you leave your purse there or your wallet. We know what misguided trust means. You don't need to explain it. I am sorry. So I, I, you know, I get worried about that type of stuff. And I also, you know, the thing about doing banking online is I realized that every account is insured up to 100 grand. And I've heard rumors that they're going to bump it up. Somebody sent me an email that they're going to push it up to two 50. But, uh, I don't know about you guys, but the last five years looking at how insurance companies handle claims and bankers, those are like two of the most corrupt fucking people out there. Insurance companies and bankers. And I'm not putting my, uh, I'm not putting my faith in them. You know, I don't understand why people are still doing that.

Speaker 7:          01:18:36       Like I said before, I don't know. I'm a paranoid psychopaths and sometimes it hurts me in life, but a lot of times it helps me and I think this is going to help me. I'm not fucking banking online. You guys can do what you want to pay your bills online. You can do it. I'm not doing that either. And uh, I'm not getting my fucking, I'm not getting fingerprinted and my retina scan to get on a fucking airplane. I'm not doing that either. And I'm not going to the grocery store scan in my own fucking food and bagging my own groceries under the guise that it's quicker and easier. It isn't. It's a lot easier for me to just stand there with my hands and my fucking pocket and have someone else do it for free.

Speaker 7:          01:19:14       All right. That's all I'm saying. So I'm sick of arguing this point. If you want to use the automated fucking grocery store thing, by all means go ahead and do it. If you want to bank online, pay your bills, by all means go ahead and do it. If you want to get your fucking retina scan, it'd be fingerprinted. I'm not saying don't do this shit. I'm saying, I guess I do say don't do it, but I think I say please don't, I, I dunno. Whatever you want to do it, go ahead and fucking do it. You know, just know that I'll be sitting there thinking that you're a moron. Okay. And if you can handle that, then that's a, that's a great, that's, you know, you'll be building yourself up spiritually. Why should you care what I think? All right. A long time ago I, uh, talked about what was the sweet spot in history, you know what I mean?

Speaker 7:          01:19:57       Like living in this country, like what was perfect, you know, I'm looking at, you know, some people who are really old, you know, if you're in your 80s or 90s, it's still had to live through the fucking depression, the dust bowl, all the wars. And I was trying to think what, what the sweet spot was. And I don't know, I was trying to think, you know, maybe if you, if you just Miss World War II, she had flat feet, you didn't have to go to Korea and then you were too old to Vietnam. I don't know. I look at a lot of it like, uh, like a cars and sports. So I want to be, I would want to be alive when sports weren't segregated, you know, so I could see the Lebrons and that type of shit. But I also want to live when the fucking cars with a shit.

Speaker 7:          01:20:45       And for me that's the forties, 50s and 60s. So, uh, I guess the, the first year I would have to sit through, you know, all white people playing all sports. But as long as I didn't know what black people look like playing sports, what I know that it sucked. You know what I mean? It's kind of like when I first was a kid, I used to listen to Mitch Miller records. I didn't know any better. I didn't know led Zeppelin existed. And then I find out they stole their first two albums. Okay. We're going to get into that again, built to shut the fuck up. All right, so this is, this person is basically weighing in what they think is the best period. Uh, the sweet spot where you could come up, come of age, live a good life, have a nice car, and not have to deal with these scary fucking times that we're living in right now.

Speaker 7:          01:21:29       Uh, hey bill, about six months ago you were talking about the sweet spot in America, blah, blah, blah, blah, because I couldn't decide on when are you couldn't, um, you said, well today I was watching dazed and confused. You know that movie there and I think it's, I think the sweet spot is a senior in high school in the 1970s when the meatball, Mike Lowell over the green monster sweet spot on the bat of American. Oh, I'm read that wrong of course, because I suck at reading. He said, I think, um, I think it's senior in the 1970s was the meatball Mike Lowell over the green monster sweet spot on the bat of American history here, out of wars and all, all that. But all that bullshit, but it's before global warming, population crisis, crystal Meth, hyperinflation, steroids, and George Bush share. We don't, we wouldn't have toys like the Internet and the Ipod, but I'm 20 now and I'll gladly give up all the achievements to go back.

Speaker 7:          01:22:27       Uh, I just fucking lost warning. It wasn't this, I'm such a bad out loud reader. Uh, all the achievements to go back to the seventies rock and a mullet speeding around in a caprice, not giving a fuck unaware that fossil fuels are exhaustible smoking weed out of those Cheech and Chong Polak poorly rolled joints back when we'd wasn't a laced with amphetamines and h and habit forming. Uh, well, I mean they didn't have a gas crisis in the early seventies, but uh, yeah, I know what you mean. That is a great fucking time. Yeah. Not wearing a condom. That's another great point. Morning after pills and penicillin. Have a nice day. These guys here. You guys, you guys are all making great points this week. It's really well written. If I could just fucking read it. Um, I'd have to agree with that because then, you know what's else is great is if you came with New York in the 70, if you were a senior in the 70s, you could also pick up a muscle car at that point, you know, be 10 years old.

Speaker 7:          01:23:24       He could probably get it for nothing. You know, because people didn't realize that fucking all these Goddamn nerds, we're going to come around and ruin it. Bloody wrath restoration, all original. It's got the original radio. Yeah. It's $170,000. And he had said that you haven't seen those fucking those, you know, I think those are bailing want to go to for those as a banker, right. Dr Assumption who can afford to fucking pay $150,000 for God their Mustang I Omega Mike gets anymore. Um, alright. Douche bag of the week. I already did this. Would you like to hear my snarky email back to him? Why? Yes. I actually do believe the trees just explode and fires only burned brown shit. I've never heard of this cigarette lit cigarette phenomenon that you speak of. Could you elaborate? That's what a, that was a tone I took with them. God, I'm so stupid.

Speaker 7:          01:24:20       Thank you for putting me in my place. It's amazing that you caught that. I record 50 minutes of ridiculous statements last week, none of which were meant to be taken seriously except for the part about the fires. I was by no means deliberately saying ignorant things in order to give someone a laugh. I truly believed every word of the fire state of the Union address. Thank God you let me know. Both the serious, serious nature and the cause of fire. Fire's just don't happen. I've got to commit that to memory. I will make sure to detract my statements next week, which I didn't. I actually just created Douche bag of the week, but for all I know that person was just trying to be sarcastic back to me and I misread it. Maybe that's what it was. Um, all right, and here's some information. Um, you know, I say a lot of shit that, you know, evidently I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. I was just bitching about muscle cars being overpriced. I always talk about vintage guitars, you know, they have some fender strat with Johnny Rotten snot on the fucking fret board and it gets 50 grand now and this guy is saying you're complaining about the cost of finches guitar guitars is largely unfounded. I'm going to stop right there sir and let you know that most of my opinions are largely unfounded.

Speaker 7:          01:25:32       That should be the name of my next next special, largely unfounded specialize specifically in the case of both, uh, fender and Gibson, the two companies you cited in your rant, um, where the quality of the, their production line took a huge nosedive from the mid eighties up until the last two years or so. Switching to oversee workers for the bulk of their production using cheaper wood paint, electronics, overall craft, craftmanship, et Cetera, have all added to the embarrassingly low quality. Most instruments on the market today. I'm definitely with you on muscle cars being overrated, but any Gibson or fender model made before 1978 as well worth a decent chunk of change. Alright, great fucking points putting me in my place. Yeah, it's like bid my, my thoughts on that away beyond largely unfounded. I really don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. The, I'm just equating it to like the housing market where if you bought a house 10 years ago, that was a great thing to do.

Speaker 7:          01:26:33       But if you bought one fucking three years ago or in an apartment like I did, you're a fucking moron. And when I'm saying right now is I think once everybody is aware that how much something is worth and that it's going to be, you know, worth a lot of money in the future, I really feel like nine times out of 10 once it's exposed like you want to be buying those guitars 2010 20 years ago when nobody realized no one really thought about how much they were going to be worth. Cause then you could get them for nothing. You know what I mean? But now you're paying top dollar. I mean you're paying 50 grand for offender fucking strat. I mean if they're going to be what, the hundred and three year, I mean I don't, I don't know. I don't, I don't understand that.

Speaker 7:          01:27:20       And it's Kinda like houses, right? I bought mine, I bought an apartment at the peak of this shift. I bet it's not even worth two thirds of what the fuck I paid for it. And now it's all coming down. That's all I'm saying. I think that's what I'm saying. Maybe I'm trying to warm out of it because you told so totally fucking nailed me to the floor on that one. All right. You know what? I can't argue. All you guys, at some point, I have to admit, I don't know what the fuck I'm talking. I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. I'm goddamn comedian. I just looked at a guitar and I'm like, yeah, it sounds good. But you know, it's fucking, it's kind of scuffed up, you know, you'd think for fucking the 50 grand, it wouldn't be so scuffy that's all I'm saying.

Speaker 7:          01:28:01       I'm speaking of which, this is the last thing I'm gonna say. And then I've got to wrap up this podcast at 45 minutes is uh, I went to a, I took a drive down the street the other day and I swear to God yesterday, Sunday out here in la and he three miles stretch driving over to the highway. Um, I saw 14 open houses. Um, I've never seen anything like this in my fucking life. And uh, I don't know. And if for some reason you can also get, can somebody explain this to me? Why there's all these houses for sale. I understand why all the houses for sale, I get that. Okay. But what I don't understand is why you can also get a great deal on rent out here. I would think that all those people, obviously they're leaving their houses that would cause the rental, the amount of rental units to go down because people who are living in houses that they air, quote owned would then be now looking to rent and then rents would be going up.

Speaker 7:          01:29:00       But it's the reverse out here. So the only thing I can guess is that people are leaving Los Angeles. They just saying fuck it, you know, I don't know. I don't fucking know. Is that, is it like that where you guys are rent or there were a bunch of open houses? I mean it did. It's, this guy told me, uh, yesterday was trying to say that they're out here. They're giving you first he fell, he found a place they're giving the first month for free and you get in a fucking iPod. And I actually thought like, that's a great deal. I'm going to go do that. And I'm like, wait a minute, it's going to cost me twice that to fucking pack all my shit up and move. Why don't I just go buy an iPod and stay where I'm at? See that I'm not always a moron.

Speaker 7:          01:29:43       Right. All right. This was a really weird podcast. I understand that. But um, Oh, before I, before I a step away here from the phone and get on with my God Damn Day, um, I want to let you guys know that the contest winners, the, uh, the birds are away. I send out the DVDs so I don't have to worry about being called the eight wastes. I sent two out of three of them. One person, I'm still waiting for you to email me back and you know who you are. You're the guy who drove up to me when I was in Houston, Texas outside the bar. Freaked me out and handed your prostate exam manuscripts. I still need your, uh, your address so I can send you a DVD. All right. And uh, and that's basically it. And uh, what have I got going on this week, this week?

Speaker 7:          01:30:27       Uh, for all you people in lots of Hong delays. I'm going to be doing a benefit down at the comedy store tomorrow night, uh, Tuesday, February, uh, 24th, I think. I got the flyer right here on my desk and when I got here, wait, no, wait, it's on the 26th c then almost hyped the wrong date. I'm a fun way am, and then I canceled that other gig. I could have done the other gig. All right. February 26th I'm going to be at the comedy store and it's a benefit for world hunger. It's going to be me, Kevin Nealon, Jeff Richards, and a bunch of other hilarious fucking people. Look, I've built myself first there, the EGOMANIAC than I am. Why? When I say Kevin Nealon Farsi is actually famous in his own. That great break. Show the weeds. I just fucking Bang my head on this. Goddamn. I got this room and my fucking apartment where you're supposed to have like they had this, this, this goddamn iron chandelier.

Speaker 7:          01:31:28       Alright, that's hanging from the ceiling and I don't know what it is. I'm about five [inaudible] 10 and this thing hits me right in the center of my forehead. So it's probably hanging about five foot eight. I, I'm supposed to have a table underneath it and I'm supposed to sit at either end of it, you know, I guess can you please pass the peas? But I don't, I use this as a fucking room. I got my desk up against the wall and I have this fucking light, ah, fucking three days. I Bang my forehead on it and have a forehead like superfly snuck off. All right. Um, that really hurt. That's one of those ones where you hit your head. So Hi.
