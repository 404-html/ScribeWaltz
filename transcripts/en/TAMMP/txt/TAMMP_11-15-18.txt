Hey, he's dropping pounds right in, left because he's not up there eating from a chef. He's Billy. He's losing his freckles. Sorry. Um, I'm excited to be home with my wife and kid. And speaking of which I last week, last Monday. Can you guys remember back to November 12th? Remember that Trump was still president? He's still president anyways. Uh, what was I gonna say? Um, I read a question. Best friend's wife from a lady and felt that Nia needed to chime in. So what did I do? I got in touch with my wife's people to try and see if I could put her on the podcast and she was nice enough to take time out of her busy, beautiful schedule as being the greatest mother ever. Um, welcome back to the program.

Speaker 1:          00:01:12       Thank you Nia hill. Thank you so much. Thank you for having me. Oh, well what was it like to work with Tom Cruise? Oh my God, he is so amazing. He is just so generous and do his own stunts. He did his own stunts. So he really banged you in that scene, right? Oh my God. It was great. He didn't let it stop me do it. No, no. He'd stand commitment. He stabbed me in the eyes the entire time. Real. It's like wow. It's like we're in a real relationship. After he got to the Invisalign, you fixed that snaggle tooth. I just felt like it all just went to another level. His commitment to the craft. Yeah. Excuse me, ma'am. We're trying to do a podcast over here.

Speaker 1:          00:01:53       I got the little one out here too. When she has her favorite show on the one created by Harland Williams. I can't say the name of it or she's going to freak out cause she's kind of looking at it like, why is there no sound? It's almost the 2000 twenties not the 1920s then once you have some old lady playing a piano when the corner. All right, Neil. I know you have a lot of stuff to do. We're going to do a little Bang Bang here. Going right into it. All right, great. All right. Best friend's wife from a best friend's wife. All right. Hello, Billy Baldwin. Oh, hey. I like it. Yeah, but I went in that I liked that I win. Yeah, that's bald. And I, when do I, I don't think so recently. I must saying, hey honey, speaking to the mic. He rather than chime in.

Speaker 1:          00:02:44       All right. Yes. Oh, you're talking about, yeah, me. All right. Uh, recently I've been posting pictures and videos on my Instagram that are not slutty.dot, dot. Not slutty, but I wouldn't show my parents either. Ah, period. Now, where it now, where, where would you call if you had to rate that as a movie? Where is she? What do you mean? Like some movie PG, PG 13 are, it's not NC 17, but it's not me. If she's showing nip and booty. So then you would say PG, PG 13, now somebody's, oh, um, I am 26 years old. Prime of your life. And I've been feeling very confident about myself. Wow. Add Up Bay Vida. Show it off girl.

Speaker 1:          00:03:38       I want to bring that back. What happened to [inaudible]? Me Guys don't dance anymore. Bring what back burlesque. The old stripper song. Yeah. Dita von Teese does it not in the club. What do you mean in the club? The in duck club Da. No, not we're black duck club. No, that was never our, are you going down? Um, and I've been feeling very confident about myself and my body. I'm single with no boyfriend or even dating anyways, my friend, sorry, since I was 16, has told me that his wife has been uncomfortable with us talking because she's seen my pictures. So they'd been friends since camp. So what happens at camp stays at camp. That's right. She, she's told him, uh, she feels insecure and sees my pictures even before he does. Uh, he has the following here. Yes. She's watching you. Private eyes. He has expressed that he may not be my friend anymore because of this.

Speaker 1:          00:04:42       And this is not the first time I've been blocked by male friends because their female counterparts, our social media stalking me and claiming I'm trying to get their men, first of all, nobody's stocking you. You're on social media. If you are hanging these up in your house and you looked and she was staring into your window, you can let go and just be like really looking through someone's feed and just be like every time they pose looking and not only looking at the picture and see who's liking the picture and the tag, like all that kind of stuff. All of that is all out in the open. I know, but like you can pay like a, just a little bit more attention to it then a normal just scrolling through. Oh, like, like, like it's like a little kid playing hide and go seek. The first time they hide, they lie down on the floor, face down and cover their eyes. I'm hiding. You're not hiding. You're putting this out for the world to see. And judge, I've been told uh, to maybe tone it to tone down my post or not. Right. How I feel because the girls take it personally and take it out on my friends. Uh, and these, are these my real friends or do their girls have legit reasons to be upset? Yours truly a huge fan and love to Nia and the baby. Oh,

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       um, well first of all I had to say, I don't know why you're surprised at this reaction because you're out there thirst trapping and these girls don't want their men to get caught in your trap. So even though you may not be trying to break that down for the white audience, what, what thirst trapping? She's out there. Thirst trap trapping means like you post photos that are intentionally like sexy or provocative cause you're trying to get legs. You're trying to get out of this. Pretend that they're not, you're just, Oh, this is just me eating cornflakes with most of my breasts to sit down. No, I don't think that you're necessarily acting like it's not, but you know that there's just like certain photos that are going to get like the IEA reaction as opposed to the like, Aye Yai Yai. Is there any, uh, d going on here?

Speaker 4:          00:06:46       Teas, D, teas,

Speaker 3:          00:06:50       Dixie, you, it's the kids here. Oh, a vibrator. Uh, I don't know that it's a Dt, but it's definitely like showing you what your life could be. Yeah. What you could be throwing around the bedroom for sure. So I don't, I mean it's not surprising that their, their girlfriends and wives or whatever are going to be like feeling some type of way if they're liking your pictures. So, um, I don't know. I don't think that you're doing anything wrong, but I didn't write this. I don't think that, um, there are necessarily wrong either. But here's the thing. I feel like they were going back to one of my earlier, my earliest appearances on the podcast. The only thing is she's been friends with this kid since she was 16, so that's, they're fine. But I also noticed in her letter that she said that like all of her male friends are most of her male friends.

Speaker 3:          00:07:42       So it was this another situation where you've got a girl who's got a lot of male friends, nothing wrong, no friends involved, male friends. And it's, Oh my God, there's stalking me on Instagram and Oh my God, there's such haters and my are these men. Really? My friends, it's like, listen, you just have to understand like you have to kind of be a grown up about this. Like it's one thing for you. Like I said, the Post thirst trapping pictures, all your girlfriends are going to be like, yes. Oh my God, you're giving me live. You're so a hard look at you, Bam. All that kind of stuff. That's what your girlfriends and like your gay friends are for what? His thirst trapping me. I just told you what it was earlier. Yeah. I said, when you're posting a picture that's intentionally provocative or sexy to get likes, that's like a thirst trap. In other words, you're not really going to hook up with anybody. No, you're just, you just saw all these postings, a sexy photo. But Steve, for women, lady, uh, guys are showing thirsty for attention that Oh, that's right. Sorry. Sorry. I'm the White Cup on Sanford and son. I'm rapping. So I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm just not surprised that they're there. What should she do so she stepped away from these people. I mean step away. How far away from the car with your hands? No. Do you have

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       to understand that if you start to move into this space where you're posting sexy photos, your viewership and the way people look at you is going to change. Huge point. If you're okay with that, then keep doing what you're doing, but if you have a problem with it, then maybe you want to pull back a little bit, but yes, people are gonna look at you some type of way. Women are gonna look at you differently. Men certainly are going to start to look at you differently and certainly, but go ahead. What comes with that territory is that women are going to be like, oh, I saw you liked her photo when she was like, you know, bent over being like, you know, I actually, if I could just meet cute or whatever, I don't know what people are here. They're both, certainly you're not going to insert anything. That's, that's what I know.

Speaker 1:          00:09:41       It's a rough one. Both men and women equally are going to look at it differently. Right. Okay. So let's not, let's not turn this into yet another, that's what I said. You said women are going to look at you differently. Men are certainly gonna get your differently. Yeah. Well, okay, so just say what you're saying. Just don't, don't, yeah. Well, okay, me just, yeah. I mean I stand by what I said. You think that, well, why can't you say that so we can discuss it? I've been doing that. Yeah. Well, okay. If Lola wasn't here, I right now, I would transcribe what you just said to me. What's his, what? Huh? I can't, there's too many f words in it. That was, that was like, if you put a bunch of f words into a shotgun. Right. Well, um, so I, women know what other women are doing.

Speaker 1:          00:10:35       I think you have to expect that. You know, if these women are already uncomfortable with your presence in their man's life, if you start posting booty shots and all this other kind of stuff and they see that they're dudes liking it, they're going to be like, she didn't say that she was bending over and or any of that type of stuff. She just said, this is some stuff that, you know, it's a little more risque, but I wouldn't show my parents. Right, exactly. Meaning it's, yeah, it's, you know, your parents or your knees get back in house. Priest, I think you should post whatever you can. The Catholic church, if you're feeling good about yourself and about your body, you should post all the live long day. Just know that it's not going to be this perfect scenario where you can just post and no one's gonna look at you differently.

Speaker 1:          00:11:21       I disagree, fortunately. Unfortunately. That's just the way that it is. I disagree with that. With what? With it. You should go and post all these sexy photos of yourself and put them on social media. Women can not be doing that. Why? Why are you telling women what they should be doing with their bodies? It is. There it is. Yeah, exactly. There it is. Yeah. And there it is from you to tell it like it. I don't think women should post the like who are you? You don't get to decide what people do with their body. Please not say that expression. You don't get to just whatever. I want to say everything in her dot trying to police my words. You haven't even heard what my point is. What's your plan? Okay. My, my point is bad. I don't want to hear it.

Speaker 1:          00:12:06       You have the way you wish the world was and the way it really is. Okay. Okay. So to go out there and do all of that stuff and be all provocative and get all these people hot and bothered, there were so many fricking cycles. That's the same reason why you don't go out there and as a celebrity sit there and, and uh, you know, tree stump or whatever the hell you call it for, for a, for a candidate, all you're doing is just going out there and getting that lunatic in the white van with the two seats that wants to make a pipe bomb and stick it in your mailbox. You doing stuff like that, you're a good looking person. People are going to know you're good looking. Like the, literally social media has been around so long that that people aren't even understanding that there's no perspective on it anymore.

Speaker 1:          00:12:52       Half of these, so many of these photos that are on Instagram and all that type of stuff, those were like the kind of photos that were in the beginning of a magazine at a truck stop like 20 years ago and these are just regular women up. But back then you didn't know where these women were. You couldn't find them on the Internet. There wasn't cvs taken. Everybody's, uh, information and you can go on and find everybody's address out there and you're going to go out there thirst trapping or whatever the hell you calling it, showing your goods and you're just, you're playing. There's not a person in law enforcement that the would not 100% agree with what I'm saying. This has nothing to do with a guy telling you to do what you should be doing with your body. And it has to do with somebody looking out for your own personal safety.

Speaker 1:          00:13:32       And the doing that is no different than these f and morons. You see out there riding a bicycle in la on busy streets allegedly in this bike lane that's not even painted and they have their headphones on. You have you, you have completely no responsibility for your own personal safety. And then when something happens to you, this is this a hundred percent looked at that you're a victim, you are a victim, but there's nothing looking at like some preventative measures. Like why would you go on the Internet and do that? Just post a picture yourself smiling. You're a good looking person and you'll attract the kind of person you want to meet. You're going to go out there and show your booty crack and you and you in your, your your, your ass cleavage there. I mean, what do you, what do you, what do you like you even said that if you're going to start showing that everybody is going to look at you differently.

Speaker 1:          00:14:16       Certainly guys, now all they're going to think is really one of the Fq, right? That's all they're thinking. That's the best you're going to get, right? That is the best you're going to get with those photos and the worst you're going to get is an Effient stalker. Right? Okay, so that's what I was saying. I wasn't trying to get in your world. I wasn't over here man spreading. I'm just saying doing that, it's literally like becoming a comedian, posting something on the Internet and then you're going to get upset when someone just tears the hell out of it and says you absolutely stink. And it's just like, well, you know, you're not a victim here. You're the guy who posted your, you're the person who decided to get up on stage and people are going to judge you. That's all I'm saying. And I think that women that do that type of stuff, I don't think because there's so young, I don't think they understand the level of f and lunatic that is out there. I don't even understand that because women get it way worse. So to go out there and sit there, I mean that's like when you order the frigging alligator farm and the dangling those frigging chickens over the thing and all the crops go in the water. You're out of your mind.

Speaker 3:          00:15:17       Uh, well I understand your points, but I still think that people should post what they want to post. It's their license

Speaker 1:          00:15:26       roll the dice that you were in the herd of people showing most of their boobs. I,

Speaker 3:          00:15:31       I mean, you're not going to get flipped peoples. Yeah, I do. Because I don't think that you should be living your life and in fear of what could happen or what might happen because of that was the case. I wouldn't leave the house. I'm not talking about going after a dream. I'm talking about keeping your ass crack and your pants. Well, I respectfully disagree, but the thing is,

Speaker 1:          00:15:55       oh, we're going to have a problem when so and so gets to be a certain age. You don't, you dare tell her that that's going to be okay. We'll see that without it. No, no, I, no, it's your daughter now. It's not okay.

Speaker 3:          00:16:06       I recognize the hypocrisy in this, but I would be like, please don't post that type of stuff on there, but I also know that I, at a certain point I'm not going to be able to control what she does. She's not going to be sitting here watching cartoons. What do you mean? What does that mean?

Speaker 1:          00:16:26       You know, beyond a certain point. I mean, what, what, what, what age is that? What are we talking about here?

Speaker 3:          00:16:31       When she's 80 and she's an adult, I'm not going to just, he isn't.

Speaker 1:          00:16:37       If we could what you thought your, your 18 hours, the logos, you're not an adult, right? Oh, you're not okay. You and I get a divorce and I'm with an 18 year old. What? She's an adult. You're going to be like, she's a shy. Oh my God, I would kill you. I kill myself. But yeah, just because I lost you. Oh God. Oh, say that no more romantic. Little enough. Sweet nothings. I don't even know how to be romantic, do I not to be romantic?

Speaker 3:          00:17:04       Um, Oh, you know what romance is? You're not, you're like a generous like sweetheart, but like romantic. No, I wouldn't say that your romantic, but I wouldn't argue with that. You like romantic things you like like music, like dancing, like in the middle of the house. Like you like to do stuff like that. I want to take you to Frankie valley out here in La. Marque first. Yeah. Oh boy.

Speaker 1:          00:17:35       Can I have a jersey boy and I have a date mistress. Someone that totally platonic. Just somebody that I bring to all the stuff that I want to go. You want to find like a 50 year old white woman to take to stuff like that. Why you got to bring race into it? Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       because I mean they'll go see Fall Frankie Valli heavy. C'Mon lets me, are you kidding me? I maybe my mom would go, where'd she go? I take her. You wouldn't take my mom. I wouldn't go. I love you mom. I'll go in a minute. You got some probably have a really nice time. You know, just too good to be true. You don't want to see that dude. He's in his eighties he's still kills it, right? Yeah. That's the guy from Jersey Boys, right?

Speaker 3:          00:18:20       Georgia. Even though what? On never laid a hand on you as the door. So anyway, back to the question. 1 million module, my Neil's perspective, my Neil's perspective isn't that, is that you're not doing anything wrong by thirst trapping on Instagram, but you should know that that's going to come with a change in how you're perceived. And yes, they are. Here's the thing. If I had a girlfriend who was hot single and she was feeling really good about herself and she was posting, you know, sexy photos, I would be one of the first ones being like, yes, bitch, get it. Oh my God. Amazing what? Get it. Get your life. Just get everything. What is that? That, yes girl show you. But if bill, are you doing, if I saw that bill was lacking all of her photos, I might be like, now wait just a minute. So that's just the reality. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:19:17       All right. Let's see. I've, I've finally got my abs. Like I finally, I didn't have to go on the road for, you know, and just ruin everything that I got. I get my abs back and I start, I start posting shirtless photos cause I feel good about my,

Speaker 3:          00:19:29       I'd be like, yes, yes, yes. Yeah I would, but yeah, and when I have a problem with women, but women already like

Speaker 1:          00:19:39       are looking for you and trying to like put it out there. I've seen it. I see your comments ladies. My remarks. That's one of the funniest things you've ever said. Just no, I'm watching it. I've never had that attention ever. Uh, it's been happening. Perhaps you have a notice it, but it happens. It doesn't count when you get to where I'm at now. What do you mean it doesn't count? It counts when you nobody. That means you good looking above a sudden you start selling tickets.

Speaker 3:          00:20:03       Hey Baby. Hey Baby.

Speaker 1:          00:20:08       I was just like, that doesn't mean anything. Look how good she's been. You liked me when I was broke. I did. I fell in love with you when you were broke. It was a great time. You know. I got you. I was thirst trapping.

Speaker 3:          00:20:24       That was going to say something else. Oh nanny. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:20:32       all right, well I'll agree to disagree on those photos. I mean I think you know what people are. Yeah, it's just like you were in inviting like I would love this gotta be something up there. Somebody in law enforcement and stories and all of that. This stuff that dude, these people are, I like, people are lunatics now. Like people will already nuts but this like this computer with all of this stuff that you can look at like you couldn't do like, you know what I mean? Like down the look back in the day, Nia, if you had like a crush it somebody on work. I mean, you needed your imagination when you went home to conjure up some sort of fit. Now you just go to their Instagram page and just sit there like an absolute void or it's not even considered voyeurism anymore. Right. And you just sit there, it's weird.

Speaker 1:          00:21:18       The whole thing is weird. And he'd go further down and then their pictures out enough and then you need video. And then the video like God, he's just some weird thing the way she like cracks and egg when she's just showing you how to make uh, uh, uh, over easy egg or something and you get all of this psycho world and then what happens is you get so into that virtual world that if you ever asked her out and she actually approached you, you then have a performance, a prob problem because it's, it's too intimate. Cause he used to this stuff, this thing, there is a disease and you know, I, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm not judging anybody cause I felt the ramifications of it, you know what I mean? Trying to lay off the, uh, the, the, the, the, the bad stuff on there. If you know what yeah, it's, you know, it's, yeah, it's just too easy. So I'm just saying, I don't know. You know, you don't mean yet. I'm liberal and conservative. I'm conservative when it comes to this. You are conservative when a car is, you know, last call at a bar. I get a little liberal and that hasn't, what do you, what is ty man? Like? What is to a, um, do you realize that it's, it's 12 noon in Japan right now, man. Oh, Jesus. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37:32       Ex girlfriend's sister. He Billy Birkenstocks stocks. Uh, I'm 26. Um, and still in love with my high school sweetheart. We've been on and off again for 10 years and I've gone through a lot to say the least. Jesus Christ. Yes. I just got back from a two week vacation with her where everything was perfect and we had the time of our lives. This is the woman I want to start a family with and it became more and more apparent on this trip. Congratulations. What could go wrong? Um, here's the thing.

Speaker 1:          00:38:07       I slept with her sister on a drunken blacked out night three years ago while me and her, we're not together and we're on bad terms. Oh boy. Who? Billy. My heart was broken and I had a lot of resentment. I was 23 drunk week. If shut the fuck up dude, you had a dick. You fucking jerked off to her while you were dating her other sit. Stick. Get the fuck Outta here. Don't fucking come at me. I got a dick too. All right. Don't fuck. And our younger sister came on to me. Oh my God, you victim. Things were different then and I was a mess. Listen, I'm not saying you weren't fucking heartbroken. You A, yeah, you were fucking psych the next day. There you go. You know what? You just got to check off a whole family. Well, you got to love to do is bang their mother. Um,

Speaker 7:          00:39:01       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:39:02       That's got to be called something like the Grand Slam. You know, like when tiger woods won four in a row and they were saying he won the grand state, you won, you won. All four majors would be if you bang the mother and all the daughters, that would be the Grand Slam. Uh, the amount of guys. Laughter right now. Why the women are pissed. Uh, well a year or so later, me and my high school sweet, he started talking again and started to become close leading up to where it is now. I had an unbelievable guilt for what I did with their sister. The, the closer me and this girl got years later. It is the only thing that I haven't been honest with her about and I had to tell her, you fucking idiot. No you didn't. You should have talked to your sister. And just, there'd been like, look, what are we gonna do here?

Speaker 7:          00:39:42       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:39:44       is it, is it good? How does it make things better that you told her that's such as [inaudible] and then like for the rest of their fucking lives, that's going to be a problem between the two of them. Ah, Jesus, you shouldn't have said Shit and just waited till 20 years later when the sister who never got married gets fucking hammered and yeah, yeah. Well I fuck jasmine. 25 years ago. And at that point, you know, what are you going to do? He'd be like, yeah, it was, dude, I was in the fucking two thousands. What do you want from me anyways?

Speaker 7:          00:40:18       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:40:19       He goes, uh, well a year or so later me and in the high school, sweet start talking again, blah, blah, blah, blah. I had an unbelievable guilt.

Speaker 7:          00:40:27       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:40:28       So I had to test sold the last night of our vacation.

Speaker 7:          00:40:32       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:40:32       Oh my God. We were laying in bed and I told her everything.

Speaker 7:          00:40:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:40:37       I took a slap. She was crying for hours and it was his ugly. As you can imagine. Well, you know what dude, I commend you. You got it off your fucking chest. He goes, I feel terrible. And I'm torn on if it was the right decision to tell her, my friends are giving me mixed answers and I would like an outside perspective from someone who I respect greatly.

Speaker 7:          00:41:01       Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:41:01       oh Jesus Christ. I appreciate the respect me. Um,

Speaker 7:          00:41:05       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:41:05       I don't know. Do you know if it was really bugging you and you felt like you had to tell a good good? You told her,

Speaker 7:          00:41:10       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:41:11       now you don't have to worry about that fucking thing coming out of nowhere. He goes, it is still fresh and everything is confusing. On what is next. We love each other very much, but obviously I fucked up big time. Do you think this relationship stands a chance? I really hope it does, but I'm worried I ruined it. She seems to be getting through it better than I thought after her first reaction. She me, she loves me, but

Speaker 7:          00:41:34       I really harder and she needs some space because when I'm, well, she needs some space. I hope you don't have a brother. Right?

Speaker 1:          00:41:43       Because when I'm with her,

Speaker 5:          00:41:46       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:41:47       okay. She told me she loves me, but I really hurt her and she needs some space because when I'm with her, she can't be mad at me. I'm not a scumbag and this is completely out of character for me to do. I just made a terrible mistake. Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. I will say the fact that you actually feel this level of guilt, um, uh, you're a better man than me cause I wouldn't have said Shit. I just would've just been like, well, I hope this doesn't fucking come out someday. Well, we're having a pumpkin pie over thanksgiving. Uh, and I bet there's a lot of people out there that live with that secret. My thing is not only the cowardly self preservation that I would try to have, I would also, I'm also thinking like this is, I, I would have handled that situation. I either wouldn't have said shit or I would just break up with her and just walk away from it because I wouldn't say, Hey, by the way, I banged your sister and then for the rest of their life, they have to fucking deal with that. Um,

Speaker 5:          00:42:48       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:42:49       When I'm the piece of shit that did it. But I have to commend you that you actually felt that level of guilt and said something, uh, because I, I don't know. So it sounds to me that you're going to get past it. So the good thing is that now you don't have to worry about that fucking grand piano fall crashing down on your fucking life someday. So that's the upside.

Speaker 5:          00:43:15       Okay.

Speaker 7:          00:43:17       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:43:18       Maybe there's an upside that you told her where she'll have faith in you that like, wow, this guy actually feels guilt about stuff like that. So I can't trust them. We were broken up while it happened. Um, you know, let me see if I can get Nia in here for this one. Hang on a second. All right. The magic of the pause button again. The lovely Nia is here.

Speaker 3:          00:43:42       Hi. Hey, how you doing? Right?

Speaker 1:          00:43:44       Ex girlfriend's sister. Oh, Jesus. All right. Really quickly, this guy. All right. I'll give the abridged version A. I've been on and off again for 10 years. Just got back from a two week vacation with her. Everything was perfect. We had the time of our lives. This is the woman I want to start a family with. A, here's the thing. I slept with a sister and a drunk and blacked out night three years ago while we met, while, uh, while we, me and her were not together and we're on bad terms. My heart was broken. I had a lot of resentment. I was 23 drunk week and her youngest sister came on to me.

Speaker 3:          00:44:17       Oh no, that's right. That's a rough one. Was a real rough. You like how he makes himself the victim. She came onto me. Okay. I said, really? I said, dude, I have a dick too fucking lie to me. Exactly. I stopped it.

Speaker 1:          00:44:31       I said, you rubbed one out to her before you fucking

Speaker 3:          00:44:34       yes. The seeds of implanted for a while that you've been whining a fuck. The sister don't try to act like, oh, I was so heartbroken. You and the sister are both dirty.

Speaker 1:          00:44:43       Okay, so here's the deal. He goes, he felt hard, terrible. The last night of the vacation. He couldn't deal with the guilt, so he told her, he goes, I tell, he goes, I took a slap. She was crying for hours and it was ugly, as you can imagine. All right. She told me she loves me, but I really hurt her and she needs some space because when I'm with with her, she can't be mad at me. I'm not a scumbag and this is completely out of character for me to do. I just made a terrible mistake. So he's basically saying, do you think the relationship stands a chance? I really hope it does, but I'm worried I ruined it. She seems to be getting through it better than I thought. After a first reaction, what do you think? It's not going to happen. You fucked her sister. It's over. That's anything. So

Speaker 3:          00:45:30       yeah, because I mean maybe, maybe there are some people who are more emotionally evolved than I am, but I couldn't get that. Like that's her sister. Like her sister is not going anywhere and like how's it going to be at like Thanksgiving and Christmas and like all that kind of stuff. Like you're just going to avoid each other or just kind of like, it's weird. I mean maybe the three of them can have a threesome. No, what I was thinking you can't, you can't have a threesome with your sister. That's disgusting. That's gross. I would never want to see each other on these bond. Yeah. Talking to each other. Hey, I know we went to a waterpark. Oh No, stop. Unless the three of them sit down and both the guy and the sister are so repentant and so whatever, but like you, you'd never be able to trust them. You'd never know. He like, Oh yeah, can you guys run out and like, you know, get some extra sugar and more groceries.

Speaker 3:          00:46:36       Exactly. So, and that's the thing. She might be okay with him now, but in the end she's going to choose her sister like that no matter how her sister betrayed her. That's the sister. So you are disposable. You're just like the dude that's her family. So if you think that you really like the hands on to her and the sister, yes, sister will probably get past it. Like I have a long, long ways from now and it'll probably always still be there, but because their family family betrays each other all the time, you know? No.

Speaker 1:          00:47:08       Here's the thing. I think what she did was worse than what he did, the sister. Oh definitely. If we're going to like put them on, who was the worst person? That situation? The sister 100% here's what I learned. You never do that if you're with a woman. Okay, okay, you guys break up and blah blah blah. If her sister comes on you like

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       you are effectively ending that relationship forever. Yeah. Yeah. And what do you think he should, they told her, her and the relationship. You think he should have told her? The thing about it is, is that he told her because he felt guilty. So it was to unburden his own conscious because it wasn't real because there's nothing in telling her that would make her feel better and oh my God, thank you so much for being honest with me. That's the sister. So I don't know. I don't really know nothing, nothing compatible that he had such guilt that he had to tell her. Not really, because people are bored with shielding all the time and they like, oh, I just had to get it off my chest. And it's like, great, congratulations. It's off your chest. And now I feel shitty. So was that really for me or was that for you?

Speaker 3:          00:48:22       Near Renee Hill coming in and bringing the law? Yeah, I, I don't, I don't, I'm not with that whole like, well, at least he was honest with you. It's like, for what? For me now that was all for him to, I never looked at it that way. Wow. Yeah. Not that I don't think apologies are worthwhile or I don't, I, it's not like, I don't think that you should apologize for something you did wrong, but I just feel like you really need to question. That's what you were saying. Yeah. You really need to question your motivations for confessing something of this level. You know what I mean? It's like what are you really trying to do? A lot of times people are just trying to unburden themselves. Well that's what I was saying, that the best thing now is he got it out there so he doesn't have to worry about that grand piano coming crashing down into his life someday.

Speaker 3:          00:49:10       Like get the same way they haven't like fucking Thanksgiving dinner. What I want to know is what is going on between the girl and the sister? Cause obviously that's no sister. That's no real. I don't know. That's what I'm working on. Something else. Why that's fucked up is because now you know that the parents know. You know, you think she would have told the parents like mom, what if they know? Yeah. And then they got to be like, oh my God, we raised a whore and I don't think that she's a whore. She's at a horse person. But you will make mistakes. But that's really, yeah, that's issued. No, no, that's, that's beyond, that's a power thing yet it is total power. It is. I wonder if this was a younger sister and I wonder like who knows? But that's what I'm more intrigued about now. It's like what's going to happen with these sisters? You know, that's like, that's some deep shit right there. So I don't know. That's like a power thing on her thing saying like, you know, as much as you're into her, you still can't fucking resist me. What is it? Yeah, maybe so because who does that? Who goes after the lettuce into the female mind? I can't let you in on that. That's not a female thing. That's like a dirty ass ho bitch, nasty person. I

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       don't know what that's like. I would never go after, uh, relatives like significant other. So where do you draw the line? What do you mean coworker?

Speaker 3:          00:50:38       So you're not just so the people know because you really have strong opinions on this. So I want to know too. So family obviously. Yeah. No, you don't do that. No fee. If the person that is clearly in a relationship with somebody else and you know that all of that together, I want to know

Speaker 1:          00:50:59       no where you draw the line coworker. Okay. You guys occasionally have lunch together with the sisters. Coworker. Yeah. And there's something the guy's got like, he does like the, the Paisley tie with the suspenders. You know that you guys always go nuts about that. No belts. Yeah. Well if you have suspenders, you don't need a belt. So, but anyway, um, what if he has both suspenders and a belt and then you think like what it is that you're trying to do? Well, maybe how would you have both when that, when that like get that thing, that female thing would like, you'd feel safe. Like this guy's really going to have, like he's going to have an alarm system and a gun.

Speaker 3:          00:51:38       Yeah. I'm not a sword. And where to condoms. Yeah. No, I dunno about that. Yeah, no, I mean if they're not involved, if they're not like in a real relationship neighbors.

Speaker 1:          00:51:50       Yeah, Babe, would you bang a neighbor when I Bang like my sister's neighbor. Oh, not your sisters. Now we've taken family out of it. I'm saying where, where is the line where it's just like, well whatever bitch, you know, is it that you guys say you put the hand up, whatever bitch, what are you talking about? I'm saying, cause you're saying like that's family. You can't fucking do that. I was just trying to find a comedic angle here. No, I see what you mean. I mean neighbor two streets over. Your neighbor knew them, invited you over and you went over there.

Speaker 3:          00:52:23       You know what? I have a real life example of the guy. The guy was an architect. Okay. All right, I got it. Um, I have a real life example of this. During, yeah, during my prom I went my senior prom. I love somebody else already. Yup. Wait a minute. I went with somebody who was just a friend. Okay. But my friend has biz Markie he was just threat. Um, but my friend went to the prom with this guy that she had just met and they were set up by another friend. He went to a different school. So they didn't really like know each other. The job was the day of justification.

Speaker 3:          00:53:04       They was set up by friends. So I'm totally innocent. So when you say really we really connected during prom and like as you know, that was not what happened. As you know, my prom did not end that great. My parents like came and like took me from this house and I was in, cause I was dumbing up, wait to tell them the truth. I called my parents because I was supposed to spend the night at a girlfriend's house, but instead we're going to be hanging out at this boy's house. His older sister was there. There was a whole bunch of us were hanging out. I was having such a great time that I called my parents and I said, hey, just so you know, I'm staying here. My mom completely flipped out and she and my step father came and like extracted me from the homes.

Speaker 3:          00:53:47       That's how my prom ended. Exactly. So it didn't end on any, it was a very traumatic, but ultimately they did the right thing. Um, but anyway, he, me and this guy ended up connecting and we ended up like dating afterwards, so you know, um, oh that's different. I thought you were saying that, you know, like I, we went in the bathroom, went to the front part of the Limo and put the window up. No, no, no, no. But it wasn't her boyfriend. They had just met. I think she definitely felt some type of way about it. You know, I'll leave because he chose you over her. Exactly. You guys didn't have any sorta like friendship, friendship? No. She and I were really good friends. Yeah. That yet. No, no, that's not good.

Speaker 8:          00:54:32       Oh, that's a rough one. But it wasn't a lot of rough, rough one.

Speaker 3:          00:54:37       And we dated for a while. We dated up until, you know, like I went to college basically. And that was, that was the end of that. So it wasn't like this law of the term, you know, Torrid affair. It wasn't like he was my first love or anything. He was just really cute and a football player and lights Bob Marley, you know. Hey, what can I say?

Speaker 8:          00:54:57       SORTA sordid details here. All right, well that's the podcast for this week. Um, need, he came hard this week. You came hard. You're really fucking just put that guy. He just said, you know what, that and that's it. It's a fucking rap. And you know what? I think you're right. I think you're right. I can say that. Yeah. As I said to him, like thank you. Yes. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:55:27       Hey, what's going on? It's Belper and it is the Monday morning podcasts for Monday, November 15th, 2010. And a, I'm doing this one really, really, really fucking late. Uh, had to fly back from Columbus this weekend. Columbus, Ohio. And uh, before I start the podcast, I want to thank everyone who came out to my shows. I had six phenomenal shows out there. Every damn one of them sold out, people smiling and waving. I was shaking hands and kissing babies after shows. Everything was great. So I want to thank everyone who came out. Uh, seriously, man, that was amazing. The, uh, Sun, even the Sunday shows sold out. So, uh, yeah, definitely. Um, definitely going to be back, you know, cause that's how I do it. If you show up to my shows, then I come back to your town. Yeah, no, the fuck you think I'm doing this for free.

Speaker 6:          00:56:23       Paypal only the podcast is free. Um, but even that, if anything free, there's a price to pay for everything. My girl is fucking pissed at me right now because my apartment was so god damn quiet until I came home and she was praying to God that I had already done the podcast and she was asking me, did you have, did you already do it? They should do it. And I said, no, I have to do the podcast. And she was just like, gosh, it's just so nice and quiet. So what I'm gonna do is I'm going to do a more subdued podcasts this week. I'm just fucking with you. I live to irritate people. All right. So I'm going to be doing it. All right. What the fuck am I talking about? I just got off the plane. All right. Back from Columbus. What the fuck do I want to talk about?

Speaker 6:          00:57:13       I don't fucking know. I'm starting to take pictures of people sleeping in airports and just some of the fucking faces, you know, especially on the planes, when people don't bring those neck braces, you know those people like they're fucking sue happy people during the day and at night they fly in planes and they have those little neck braces when, when people don't have those, just watching people's heads, Bob and all around, you know that's a good time to be obese because he got like that built in neckbrace big neck brace of fat. You know, you want a pillow. All you do is just lean your head 45 degrees to the right of the left. You're all good. I bet they never have any neck pain, you know? But what do they do every fucking week on the biggest loser sitting there, bitch, Moan and complain it.

Speaker 6:          00:58:03       Oh, it's so fucking hard. Really? You have a body temperature pillow on all four sides of your neck. I know it's round, but my world, you still have sites. So there you go. Fatties fat people. I know. And I know I tease you a lot because you know what? I'm sick of you. I'm citizens that you know, there's enough fucking groups out there that I got to watch what I say that I got to tippy toe around. Okay? I'm not tick, I'm not fucking add in another one. All right. I've added up to here with the fucking tippy toe and God damn bastards lay off the fudge. Um, I first realized though, I thought of control when I went to fall asleep on the plane and I felt like I was laying on a cloud and I realized it was part of my neck. Jesus, how fucking cranky am I when I get off a God damn plane?

Speaker 6:          00:59:03       Um, anyways, I was a good boy out in Columbus as far as boozing goes. I did not booze as far as eating goes. I did all right. You know, you know so fucking funny is when you go to the Goddamn Midwest and you try to ask people, where can I get something healthy to eat like that? There's no such thing as healthy food in the Midwest. They don't even fucking understand it. You know, all they know how to do is to have some big block headed fucking blonde haired kid come out of that Goddamn wife's fucking Twat, right? They don't even raise them. They just send them out in a fucking cornfields and just, just have the kid, the kid grazes until these fucking 16 all right? Then they signed them up for pop Warner fucking football. They can't even find a helmet to fit his big fucking big 10 goddamn put your block of a fucking head.

Speaker 6:          00:59:58       Right? And then what happens? Some piece of shit can't beat him. So what do they do? They fucking crack one of the crack back block, whatever the fuck they take. His fucking needs out. All right. His dreams over. He's not going to block for Jim Plunkett. It's fucking over. So then what? He gets a job at a fucking hotel desk and here I come walking in, you know the fucking Pussy, California boy now going, oh, excuse me, is there a place to get something healthy? And these fucking people there, their eyes cross. I said, this all, I says, you know, I'm really craving a stake does. Is there a place to get a steak? And I don't mean like an Applebees steak, you know what I mean? I'm talking cloth Napkins. I'm talking, you know, somebody related to a Rockefeller sitting at the bar sipping on some God damn old booze talking to a broad 70 years younger than him.

Speaker 6:          01:00:53       That's, that's the kind of fucking place I want to go to. All right, that's what I want to go to. And you know what? This fucking God damn idiot sends. He sends me to some fucking barbecue shack. I walking towards it like, you know, I don't have a car. So I'm walking around the hotel and as I'm walking towards the complex, he told me to go to one of the first red flags I saw was a neon sign. All right. We got any steak eaters out there who listened to this fucking podcast? Yeah, the like a quality steak. Do you like going to a quality place? Exactly. Now, have you ever seen a fucking neon sign? Neon signage? Does Peter Luger's have neon signage? I don't think so. Huh? Smith and Wollensky now it's always supposed to look stuffy. It's supposed to look like this. Politicians in there doing fucking dirty backdoor deals for fucking defense contracts. That's what it's supposed to look like. All right.

Speaker 6:          01:01:55       Fucking guys in suits. That's what it's supposed to look like. And I come walking into this and you know, I don't have enough time before the show, so I just say fuck it. And I go over there, right? And I walk into this barbecue joint and if you guys have listened to this podcast before, you realize I fucking hate barbecue. I don't like it. It doesn't taste good. I think the sauce is just their way of, of, of covering up the fact that you're eating a very poor cut of meat. You know, eating the fucking Cartlidge out of a Goddamn oxen or whatever the hell they do. The piggers sandwich is it really did you get all the cartilage in there? You fucking moron. No wonder you got to slather it with all that smoked Hickory, whatever the fire it actually, isn't that what you cook it with?

Speaker 6:          01:02:41       Whatever, with all the barbecue sauce. So I go in there, you know, and I'm fucking grumbling like the Goddamn fucking old man I am. So I open up the menu and I just, you know, something just pops out at me. It's says pulled pork. They got some uh, some Broccoli and some beans and I say, fuck it. You know, he's cute girl comes over, right? Like the round is tits I've seen in a long time. It was fucking perfectly fucking round and they weren't fake. And I was just kept looking at him going, how are they so fucking round? And I was like, you know what? She probably has on one of those fucking Hocus pocus bras. That's what it is. She's probably got an eight cup, possibly a B Cup. And I don't know what the fuck did doing the padded, but you know, still it was fun to look at.

Speaker 6:          01:03:28       She, she had one of those bras that I think Doug Henning made and master of illusion, Doug Henning. Um, he's a magician. Everybody the big space in between his teeth, like that fucking guy used to play for the giants who's now on television, who had a failed Sitcom and I can never remember his fucking name. Yeah, you haven't had something like that. You just can't remember the fucking name and the same facial hair as Rosey Greer. The fuck is his name. One of the great defensive ends of all time broke the sack record. Remember that when fucking Brett Farve curled up into the fetal position because they were friends. The fuck is his name. He plays for the goddamn giants.

Speaker 6:          01:04:13       Ah, Shit. I keep thinking Richard Seymour. I know that's the guy that Patriot shouldn't have traded the fuck is his name. Begins with an s. There's an s in there somewhere. That guy could fucking, he could spit a walnut at you between his two front teeth that even open in his God damn mouth. Um, anyway, so I go in there and I fucking order that shit and I'm just looking at this girl with their round tits, right? And she brings this stuff over and they got this little, you know, they got the Kansas City, which is a sweet, that's a sweet, sweet or one. And then you got Carolina's more vinegar base. And then we got, we got the fucking Mexican one that's going to make your eyes water and you nose run. And then they had one other one, the Pussy one, right? So I go with the kids, a city one, and I got to tell you, it was one of the best fucking meals I've had in a long time. It was absent. The pork was absolutely delicious. I loved it. The beans were phenomenal. The Broccoli, of course, had been steaming since they opened the place because nobody in the Midwest eats vegetables. They're horrible people, man. They all got big heads and block Colin's, you know, that's why they play that smash mouth football. They're not going to use a spread offense. They're all fucking clogged up.

Speaker 6:          01:05:35       Ah, just fucking around people. I'm just fucking around. I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm going on adrenaline here. All right. I'm going on adrenaline. That's all I got. It's all I got this week. So I actually, I, I, that's the one time when I didn't eat well and, uh, we're going to talk about food this week. I went to fucking [inaudible], Panorama, Panorama, fucking Panera bread, whatever the fuck you call it. Went in there and I got a breakfast sandwich. Um, hi. Sarah can help you down here, sir. Yes, thank you sir. Come down to this registered, sir. Thank you sir. Hi Sarah. Can I help you sir? One of those places where it's like, did somebody drug you, you know, did Alec Baldwin of Panera bread come in and scream, fuck you at you? You know the whole Glen Gary, Glen Ross, and now you're out here with, you know, just trying to be all fucking happy.

Speaker 6:          01:06:24       Stop being, you're not that happy. So anyway, Sarah, can I help you Sarah? It's Sarah can help you down here. Can help the next person down here. Sir, can you down? Come down here sir. So I go down. There I go. Let me get a, let me get a breakfast sandwich. Okay. We have our choice between egg and cheese, egg, cheese and sausage or egg, cheese and bacon. I got, let me get the egg and cheese. What kind of bread kind of bread do you got? What did you get the hickory smoke. We got the salmon flat. Fuck it. Just gimme week. Okay. Third, there's no reason to curse, right? So I get the wheat and uh, they just microwave this shit. I don't know. It was one of the most, uh, it was almost like a, a joke sandwich, like a prop sandwich, like the kind of thing that would be sitting on a plate in the background and that old show.

Speaker 6:          01:07:04       Uh, what was it? Peewee's playhouse. Peewees fun house. Peewees uh, let's give some kids some acid and invite a pedophile over whatever the fuck his show was called. I Dunno. See, adrenaline doesn't always work. That was a, that was a shit sandwich and the story was even shittier. But anyways, this is the fucking podcast for this week. I need help from you guys. All right. Uh, I went out and I bought some Ram for my computer. My whole do it yourself kick. All right. I know I could've gone down to the apple store and had one of those fucking nerds that God damn body odor walking around with the nerve to have, you know, genius written on this shirt. All right. With their buddy Holly glasses and that type of shit. And I'm like, how fucking hard can it be to put ram in a computer?

Speaker 6:          01:07:58       That sounds pretty intimidating, doesn't it? Well, you know what, I went on Youtube and evidently it's pretty fucking easy. Take a Goddamn Nicoletta your pocket, right? You unscrew the fucking battery for some reason you, you a, you turn right to loosen it, you know lefty Loosey righty tighty you have just go right pop out the fucking battery and there's like two screws. You remove a band and then there's two switches and the things pop out like toast. You take out the old one, you put in the higher one. He slammed that fucker back in. He used to the reverse process and you're done. But this is the problem. You need special screwdrivers. All right? You need precision screwdrivers. And I went down to fucking home depot and they don't have any small enough. So now that I have insulted all the tech nerds out there, where the fuck can I get these screwdrivers?

Speaker 6:          01:08:47       I have a Mac. Oh, s x or is that 10 I have no idea. Version 10.5 0.8 I need some precision screwdrivers to unscrew fucking three four bolts. You know, I feel like I'm going to, I'm going to put a fucking heavy in my laptop. It's a joke. You guys should go on Youtube, go on youtube and check or go on the FM podcast cause we'll have this v.com mm podcast.com we'll have that video up there. Just look up youtube videos, how to add ram to your Mac. And this guy will show you how to do the whole fucking thing. It's a joke. All right. This is my new kick. I'm sick of these fucking guys with their Dickies. Come walking into my apartment, charge me all this God damn money and not one of them. Seems like there are any smarter than I am. So basically they just have information, information. Who are the new number two? Who is number one? You are number six. I am not a number. I am a free man. Uh sorry. Iron maiden flashback. Um, yeah, I'm sick of these guys coming in here. Charge me all this fucking money. I want to learn how to do shit myself. I'm still trying to get the balls up to replace the trim on my doors. I've gotten to the point where I've watched enough youtube videos where I definitely know how to get the shit off.

Speaker 6:          01:10:11       Like most weekend warriors. Oh, I can start the fucking job, but bringing it on home, you know it's going to be hilarious and or great for my act is when I actually try to do this shit and fail and then I have to call another guy over to finish it because I wasn't man enough to figure it out myself and it'll be emasculating. But you know what? I'll learn. I'll stay. I don't give a fuck. I don't have any God damned pride at this point. I'll, I'll, I'll stand right there and figure out, look over shoulder. I'll be that annoying guy. Huh? Oh you blue collar guys out there who fix shit. I did that for a minute. I used to finish basements. You know in the fucking worst job you could ever do is you go into somebody's fucking house did go in to finish their basement and the fucking cunt would be sitting down there in the basement watching you do the entire project.

Speaker 6:          01:11:07       So anytime you made a bad cut, anytime you know all you know all the bullshit that's behind the walls, there's a lot of knee and elbow work and they sitting there freaking out. What does that is as that going to be a pro? Like when you go to put the fucking installation and you know what? I can't remember the fucking measurements. I was, I was a grunt. I just handed the dude to shit and I remember that like the, the, the fucking installation would go like 80% up the wall and then you just reach over and break off some more insulation and stuff it in there and the fucking Goddamn broads would get so pissed. Why? What about that little space in between? It's not gonna matter.

Speaker 6:          01:11:45       Why are you here? Do you think we're going to steal your fucking laundry? Get outta here. The Fuck Outta here. That was a bit late then. You know what's funny is you just sit there and, and the, the fucking shit that would go on between me and the other person I was finishing the basement with, you know, when we realize the person wasn't leaving do they do, would just be like, yeah, hey me the nail gun. And you know you do that shit where, where like the Douche is behind you, right? It's basically he's talking to me. I can see his face and over his shoulder I see the person who owns the fucking house and he turned to him and he'd be like, hey me that nail gun. And you know, his eyes would be wide and his eyebrows to be down, you know, that look like fuck shit.

Speaker 6:          01:12:30       Um, so anyways, that's probably what's going to end up happening to me. So this is the Monday morning podcast. If the subdued version of the Monday morning podcasts for November 15th and guess what? Guess what everybody does? I stuttered through this fucking thing. It is November 15th and old Billy boy here has got 30 days and no Busan, no booths, not a drop of fucking booze. How do you like that for fucking willpower? It's not that impressive as well. Fucking means a lot to me. I was actually on the plane reading, rolling stone. M and M is on the cover and he was talking about two and a half years of being sober. And I was thinking, that's pretty fucking amazing considering the most I've been able to go 75 days. You know, I, granted I don't feel like I have an addictive personality. I just don't want to have a huge fat head.

Speaker 6:          01:13:28       Although I could use the side of my neck for a pillow when I get on the God damn plane. Um, so anyways, this is the podcast for this week. Uh, last week I actually began a new segment here on the podcast a inadvertently, uh, when I, when I brought up that movie over the edge and when those kids right in the school and they locked the police and the parents and the teachers because they were having that meeting in the cafeteria, they lock them in the fucking cafeteria and then they start vandalizing the school and the cop runs up and he's tugging on the fucking chain link fence or whatever the fuck they put up. And he can't get out. And this chick, big chick, like six foot two comes running by with this giant globe. She runs by the camera and then comes running back, looks at the cop and goes, ate it.

Speaker 6:          01:14:21       You stick in pig. What are the, what are the most fucking horrific lines I've ever seen in a fucking movie? And that ended up inadvertently creating a new segment, best lines in awful movies. And uh, I got one for Ya. Uh, it is called shark attack. Uh, I can't tell you what the line is. You have to watch somebody sent this in. I should say it's a shark attack. Three just, just search. We're going to have all of these, all of the ship shit. Sorry up on. I'm actually apologizing cause I didn't curse. Sorry. I said ship instead of shit. Um, we're gonna have all these videos up on the FM podcast.com. All right. But for some reason, if you want to look it up yourself, if you're a control freak, I understand that. Go ahead. Make your life harder. I don't give a fuck.

Speaker 6:          01:15:13       Go on Youtube and look up shark attack. Three famous line and I challenge you to be silent after you fucking hear what this guy says. I think I just said what it just, it's the most, one of the most fucked up lines I've ever heard in a movie. And you know that that's the challenge. Give me a line worst than this fucking line in shark attack. Three famous line. And also I was kind of surfing. I started surfing bad movies cause I got into that part on Youtube and a a definitely must rent, but definite rental for me. I'm taking a month off here, coming up around Christmas is a silent night, deadly night, part five. I have to watch that fucking movie. Um, there's another great one. Just just go on Youtube and fucking just look at the movie. Just look at the trailer for that fucking movie.

Speaker 6:          01:16:13       You know, somebody asked me the other day, he's like, you know, as an actor, when you're in a bad movie, do you think you realize it? You know, and I think on a movie like that, you'd do. But the scary thing is, is I think on anything else you'd doubt because you're so at the fucking mercy of the music, of the edits and all that type of shit. You just pray to God. You got somebody good. That's what I learned in date night when I delivered eight fucking lines. Listen to me talking like I'm in an inside the actor's fucking studio. I had eight lines more than a goddamn extra. And here I am talking like I'm a fucking professional. Why do I have the hiccups? Um, so anyways, there you go. People. There's 21 minutes where I didn't talk about sports. All right, so be prepared to roll your fucking ice.

Speaker 6:          01:17:00       All right, let's talk NFL football real quick here. I went one in three this week, betting against the spread. I got my fucking ass handed the fucking ass handed to me. I knew the second. Yeah. You know, gamblers out day. You know like those certain weeks where you just, you just can't see a winner. Some weeks you get excited, you're like, oh fuck. This is easy, man. Like that, that they'll definitely cover. They're definitely covered. Course half of them don't, but I'm not even talking about whether you win or you lose, but you have that excitement like, yeah, I can fucking see it. Right. You know you liked that the black dude who's, who's constantly shaving his head and Predator. I see you over there and then trees, right. You're looking at it like that. This week I was more like Tom Cruise in top gun. You know, when he loses his edge and he's going, yeah, Nah, it's no good.

Speaker 6:          01:17:49       It's no good. You know, turn the fucking playing around you fucking fag. What are you doing? All right. And he says, it's no good. It's not good. I can't, I can't see anything that, that's how I was this week. I just, you know, I looked at the bills and lines and I just didn't like it. Hated that fucking game. You know, those two Goddamn Jekyll and Hyde teams, who the fuck's gonna show up? You know? So I stayed away from that one. I looked at fucking Miami and the Ravens and something was telling me Chad Pennington, Chad Pennington, but I was like against Ray Lewis and fucking Ralph Nader, whatever the fuck the name of this quarterback is. If for some reason I can't remember, Edie Falco, ed Falco, what the fuck is his name? Flaco Joe Flacco. Um, soil. My Gut told me Miami, but I didn't have the balls. I didn't have the balls to pull the trigger.

Speaker 6:          01:18:43       So I said, fuck that one. All right, so I bet Tampa Bay, because they've been working for me and they covered. And then I just picked two games where I just couldn't, I couldn't see a fucking winner. I bet that, uh, the Houston Texans against Jacksonville, I was getting a point and a half. I said, uh, God damn Jekyll and Hyde, Jacksonville, who's going to show up? Texans have been consistent. Fuck it. They beat the colts. I'm going with the Texas. All right. Lose that Goddamn fucking bet on that Hail Mary Pass. All right. But that happens. And then I looked at the Arizona Seattle game and I picked Arizona and I said, no, wait, Seattle, Seattle. I say, yeah, Pete Carol is not a fucking NFL coach. And I picked Arizona as I was saying, no, not Seattle. So I fucking lose that one. And this was the worst one.

Speaker 6:          01:19:36       Pittsburgh plays my fucking New England patriots, and I was so god damn fucking depressed. After that Brown's loss, the Steelers are at home and they're only given fucking four and a half. They got that great defense. They got Ben Roethlisberger, Joe fucking cool won two super bowls that held a lot of water with me. So I said, fuck it. I'm taking the Goddamn steel is I bet against my own fucking team. And I lost that one. I was my Sunday night show, um, at, at the funny bone in Columbus and I get off stage and I'm going, it's going to be like 17, three or 17 to nine or something. Pittsburgh and I get off stage and it's fucking 10 to nothing patriots. And I was like, you gotta be shitting me. Right. You know that sinking feeling. You're like, you gotta be kidding me. Really, really. I lost faith in my own fucking team on running, be able to enjoy this.

Speaker 6:          01:20:32       Actually, I still did enjoy it. It's kind of a win win for me. Either the Patriots get to fucking asses kicked, right? But it helps my gambling record or they go out and win. But the thing is, is I didn't bet on the patriots, so I can't brag this week. I can't even bring up the fact that we fucking own the Pittsburgh Steelers. We are seven and two against those motherfuckers. The last nine games, the six time world champion that the fucking Yankees of the NFL, the Boston Celtics of the NFL, the Montreal Canadians, the ones with the most fucking titles. We have seven and two. And I, for the life of me, I can't figure out why. I remember a few, like a month ago when all the jet fans had this stupid green chest hairs standing at attention, and I was saying that Rothenberger hadn't come back yet. And that's the team that's going to kick the shit out of you or until you beat that fucking team that, that's the team that I believed in.

Speaker 6:          01:21:28       What the fuck happened? I Dunno. So anyways, and uh, being in Columbus, I actually got to watch the browns and the jets game and uh, you know what? I don't fucking Wa the Browns, like Cleveland fans. I don't know what the fuck you guys did to the sports gods. That's another one of those fucking towns. It's just like they just can't lose a game. They have to fuck it up. You know? By the way, can I get any credit on this podcast for that stat that I created? Remember I told you, I said Mark, uh, fucking Sanchez leads the League in drop inner dropped interceptions. Any fantasy football nerds want to start keeping track of that. I've never seen anything like it. It's like he's got a little remote control in the football that went defenders catch it with both hands. It's, I don't know what he does.

Speaker 6:          01:22:24       Like he's, he's got like, he turns it into a knuckle ball, that fucking piece of shit. No, I'm joking. He's actually a good quarterback. That fucking guy, he threw a pick. He throws a pic. I could've caught the ball. It hit this dude in both fucking hands, but because Sanchez throws it, the dude just goes Wallay he took it like, Yo, that it was a hot potato. It just sort of throw it past himself and then he's like, Whoa, no wait, I think I want to catch it now. And at that point the jet def a wide receiver wisely slapped it to the fucking ground.

Speaker 6:          01:23:02       You know, I don't in defense of the jets, I mean they did miss three fucking field goals so they should have won it regulation, but Jesus Christ, they opened the fucking door. That's what scaring me about the jets is they fucking lose games and they still, when they got luck be a lady to night. They got that on their side. And you know what Chet fans, cause I know you have no idea what it's like to win a championship. All right? That's what you need when you start seeing shit like that. That's the kind of shit that should get you excited and scares the shit out of me. Because if you mother fuckers are actually going to be a halfway decent team and the people are going to drop interceptions, I mean how do you stop the, even when they're trying to lose a fucking game, there's still winning games but jet fan, she got to admit how fucking insane is that running back. I told you that guy who was, I keep forgetting his name, the guy with the dodge ram grill on the front of his fucking helmet.

Speaker 6:          01:24:01       Who the fuck was talking about? His arms was saying that's why he fumbled the ball. Oh, that motherfucker, they will write in field goal. Just step out of bounds, protect the fucking ball, whatever. Here's my prediction. I think Cleveland very quickly is going to get over Lebron leaving and they're going to become a football town once again. And uh, I am all for it because I fucking loved the Cleveland browns in the 80s. I loved those teams. Brian Sipe, Bernie Kosar. Ah, that fucking orange helmet used to play in municipal stadium and it was always like fucking minus 60 degrees, uh, those games with a shit, those games with a fucking shit, um, cardiac kids. Right. I Dunno. You know what? I actually get excited when a team that that's been bad for a long time, but actually used to have a winning tradition. Like the browns were the shit in the 50s, right through the 60s.

Speaker 6:          01:25:01       You know, that's something I should have looked up. I should have looked up. Uh, how many NFL titles that they, uh, that they want. Isn't that fucked up at that? They don't count those. You know what I mean? Like how the Pittsburgh Steelers are a top the league with a measly six championships. It's not a measly because they've won in the last 40 something years, but like six championships is all it takes for you to get to the top of the league. You know, it's fucking 27 in baseball, 17 in basketball. I always forget what the Canadians got. The Canadians got like fucking, uh, they got at least 22, something like that. Jesus Christ, some fucking French do. She's going to correct me on that one. All in capital letters, um, squiggly lines over different vowels. Yeah, I don't why? Why don't they see anybody know why? Why don't they count those titles? You know, why don't they count like a mean, would it be nice if eagle fans could actually have like 1960 or whatever the fuck they had? At least some sort of championship banner hanging on top of the fucking a Blimpie subway, sandwich.com stadium, whatever. Wherever the fuck they play.

Speaker 6:          01:26:16       Why don't they, why don't they count those? Does anybody know? Is this even fucking remotely interesting? Let's get to the the obscure sports stat of the week. Somebody sent this shit in, you know last week I started this topic by saying how the last time sports teams in St Louis lost the world series last. The Stanley Cup final lost a super bowl and an NBA title way back when they had the Saint Louis Hawks before they moved to Atlanta the last four times they've lost in the finals. Last Times they've lost in the finals and all four sports is what I'm trying to say. We're all from teams all at the hands of teams from Boston.

Speaker 6:          01:26:57       There's your obscure staff from last week and this is the one from this week. All right. This is the most fucked up thing I've seen in awhile. Evidently back in 1973 all right. The glam rock was going on, right? Let's give you a little historical perspective. I think this is right during Watergate. What did Nixon get bounced out? Like 74 that's right cause he wanted 72 and then the fallout was in 73 and then he was gone. What else happened? We got out of Vietnam is a year before we got out of Vietnam. And uh, I know chicks are pretty hot back then. You know that whole Mary Tyler Moore look, and that was never in the Mary Tyler Moore. She looked better on that show at that skinny drunk. He used to fall over the Ottoman. But Dick Van Dyke, um, was the other ones, the ones that did the guest stars and they had, they had the fucking mini skirts, mini skirts, you know, barely hanging over those fucking Harry muffs.

Speaker 6:          01:28:02       Um, anyways, there's your historical perspective, uh, to Yankee pitchers in 1973 I never heard of this traded their wives and kids, they just switched off families. And this is the story. According to the Daily News, 1973, um, Fort Lauderdale, Florida. March, March, March 5th, Yankee Pitcher, they call by their last names here because I guess, you know, people knew who the fuck they were. Kekich K, I. E. K. I, c h and Marilyn disclosed today that they had exchanged families several months ago. Peterson moving in with Susan Keck, rich and her two daughters and Keck rich moving in with Marilyn Peterson and her two sons. The pitchers in separate talks said they decided to reveal the arrangement because too many people knew about it. Evidently everybody in baseball, I mean can't really keep a story like that quiet I guess all around the fucking spring training. Everybody was talking about this shit. So they finally just went public with it.

Speaker 6:          01:29:10       So, um, they thought it was time to clear the air and the 31 year old Peterson confided that they hope that you won't make anything sorted out of this according to Kekich. I'm sure I'm saying that wrong. Unless people know the full details that could turn out to be a nasty type thing. Don't say this was wipe swapping his wife swapping because it wasn't, we didn't swap wives. We swapped lives. Ah, Jesus Christ. Look at this guy. Fucking sprinkle in a bunch of sugar over it. Um, I guess technically he is right dude. How fucked up or their children Keck it. Your Dad just taps out. Yeah, I'm Outta here. I don't want to be with you mom anymore. And you know, you know my best buddy, he was always over here drinking beers. Yeah, he's going to be your dad now. He's going to be banging your mom when you hear that Moan and just, no, that's not me doing that work or right kids and uh, I'm Outta here and uh, I'm going to go fuck his wife and go raise his children.

Speaker 6:          01:30:13       Okay. How does that sit with you? Jesus Christ. You want to talk to them? If they had daughters, you want to talk about the easiest chicks to lose your fucking virginity to, then they go right there. There they are. Well them up fellas. All right. New Jersey where the forehead resided for four years requires simply that the parties proved separation for a year in order to file for divorce. It's a no fault rule, meaning no grounds are required. You know what's amazing about this fucking story is how like that you could actually keep something like this quiet for a, for a couple of months. Because if you ever tried to do any bullshit like this, uh, today, I mean Jesus Christ, three different 24 hour sports networks and ESPN alone. The first is network. I mean then you get, TMZ would jump on that would just TMZ late night talk shows. They got like 58 of them now.

Speaker 6:          01:31:11       Oh my God, it'd be over manager. Ralph Houk said it was a situation that he could live with a, that it would not rip apart his team and that it still had its best chance of winning a pennant since 1964. I always like Ralph Elk fucking kept it positive and just for the record, they went 80 and 80 to two games of under 500 Jesus fucking Christ. Jesus Christ. How the fuck he is the top, that obscure stat. Has Anybody noticed that? I've been stuttering more and more as this fucking podcast goes along, the sun is gradually going down. It got 36 stutter and fucking minutes in here. Hang on a second. I've got to turn the light on so I can read here. Hold on. Just stay there. Don't freak out. I'm not leaving you for somebody else's wife and family across the street.

Speaker 6:          01:32:02       How to fuck men talk. That was like the fallout of the, the, the free love man society's rules, man. What does it mean? You know what's funny is they, they really, um, I saw a great documentary on, on hippies because literally called hippies and it was awesome because one of the former, a hippy dudes was really honest where he just said he didn't like what was going on and he rebelled against it, which I totally fucking related to, but he talked about living in those communes, you know, where they were going to start their own fucking churches and their own education and everything. And everybody shared everything. And He came to the same conclusion that we all come to is that basically other people are fucking irritating and you want to get away from him. And that's basically what happened at the commune, at least for this guy.

Speaker 6:          01:33:04       Like he was hanging out and have free love and all this type of shit. And after awhile you just like, oh my God, I gotta, I gotta get, I gotta get the fuck away from these people. You know? So you really gotta hand it to the native Americans how they were able to live like that. It's somehow, uh, you know why that is, of course is because they didn't realize they didn't understand the concept of having an apartment much less a fucking door. Um, that right. That was pretty ignorant. That's plow ahead. Oh, by the way, I've really pissed off a lot of potheads evidently on my podcast. They think that I, I am against smoking weed and then I'm trashing that whole fucking lifestyle. Why don't you guys go take another hit off your fucking blunt and fucking relax. All right? Just because I, I trashed that guy who was a pot smoker.

Speaker 6:          01:33:53       I wasn't saying that weed was a bad thing. All right. At this point, with those vaporizers that they have, it's probably fucking 10 times healthier than sitting around drinking a six pack. I don't have a fucking problem. I wasn't talking about smoking weed. I was, I wasn't. I was making fun of a loser. I was telling that woman that she was dating a fucking loser. All right? As a man, your job is to go out and fucking provide, you know, and when somebody breaks into your house not to shit yourself and to grab the nearest blunt object and fucking go brave hard on him, that's what you supposed to do. You know me, I would shit myself, lock myself in the bathroom and called nine one one of course, but I can provide God dammit. That's when he got to fit fucking pit bull for.

Speaker 6:          01:34:44       Um, speaking of that, I watched no country for old men again, man. What a fucking awesome movie that is. That is just absolutely phenomenal fucking movie. It actually made me sad that we were in descent. That's how good that goddamn movie is. Um, but anyways, so I just know that potheads I'm not making fun. You know, if I make fun of some guy who's a booze bag, booze bag, fucking losers sitting around drinking beer all day on the couch, that doesn't mean that I don't think that anybody should drink. All right, so fucking relax. Jesus Christ, that touchy got mellow when you smoke weed. Um, anyways, let's plow ahead. Hey Edge. Can you guys basically just admit that you want weed to be free just so you can just sit around, smoke it, and not have to worry about anybody hassle and Ya, you know, to use a classic Hippie word, why can't you just admit that and stopped telling me about, you know, how the fucking declaration of independence was written on hemp and all, all these, you know, I mean, Jesus Christ, you can make a potted plant out of a 40 in empty 40 ounce.

Speaker 6:          01:35:58       I'm not going to sit there and act like I don't wish that I want to drink in public, right? Dude, my brain shut down seven minutes ago. I don't even, what the fuck I'm talking about? I need to start reading again. Overrated. Underrated for this week. Everybody. Um, all right. This guy said underrated banana pancake. Damn. I made a simple pancake with bananas in it and I had some, uh, some great real maple syrup from New Zealand and it was fucking amazing. I couldn't believe how great it tasted a, it never was a pancake guy and when I used to go to, and it was never a pancake guy when he used to go to diners back in Jersey, it was delicious but overrated to banana pancakes. All right. I got greedy. I thought the first one was so good. I went back, I made a second one man, was I wrong?

Speaker 6:          01:36:49       I ate it and felt like a gluttonous pig. I should have known, but I at least for temporary temporarily forgot. Happiness comes in spurts and too much of anything can be bad. I hate to relate life to a couple of pancakes, but it's true. I overdid it and ruin the great single pancake experience. A one and it was great. I ate a second and I felt like shit. Yeah, they go, dude, dude, batter. Pancake batter is a edible cement. That's what it is. All right. I told those stories before for all you struggling comedians out there, you don't want to blow a bunch of cash on food. Go down to Denny's or an I hop and about nine 30 in the morning, get the fucking full stack of pancakes and force. I don't even know if they make them anymore with all this talking about nutrition, I don't even think back in the day they give you a five and you just, I just like man versus food.

Speaker 6:          01:37:47       I just shoved that. She'd be sweating by the time he got to the third one, all that syrup and all that butter. And then you'd suck down your water and the Oj and I swear to God you weren't hungry again to like 10 o'clock at night. So you got to skip at least one fucking mail. You know, just a tip. Just a tip for you. Let's wind this podcast down. Let's go short and sweet this week shall we, uh, youtube videos for this week. And I'm going to tell you right now, I think these are arguably the best fucking youtube videos, the best cluster of youtube videos that, um, that you guys have suggested since I've been doing this topic because you guys have, are now actually going outside the realm of Youtube. And finding some really obscure shit. So for all of you, they're listening at home.

Speaker 6:          01:38:32       Just go to the FM podcast.com and uh, we'll have all of these lined up for you to watch. All right, here we go. First a youtube video. And this one right here is an instant fucking classic. I absolutely love this guy. Uh, this youtube video is called man is tased mocks cops and still gets away. I want you guys to watch this because not only is it fucking hilarious, but this guy really shows why it's so important to know what your rights are as a citizen. I'm not saying the cops aren't still gonna kick the shit out of you, but just to watch this guy, he's actually stumping the cops on a certain level because they can't answer his questions. They got pinned on the ground and they said, go and sir, you're underneath the rest. You're, yeah. Do you realize you aren't ya? You're aware that you're under arrest?

Speaker 6:          01:39:23       And he goes, no. He goes, what's the charge? What is the charge? And they just kept going, sir, are you aware that you're under arrest? He's like, I don't speak the language. I'm not in your king. I'm not a subjective your kingdom. Right, and for the first minute and 20 seconds, this guy's fucking hilarious. Then he gets all religious, oh gee. And then it gets funny, looks like a freak and then he just starts singing this fucking song and they're trying to handcuff him and he is doing the most simple fucking move with his elbow. Really look to see it. The cop keeps going over the risks go under the risk over the wrist, under the wrist, and he just keeps moving his fucking elbow. It's literally a two inch move. He's moving it up to inches and down to witches in this fucking cop cannot get the God damn handcuffs on him and the whole time he's doing this, he's singing this fucking song.

Speaker 6:          01:40:17       He's like a poet or something like that. Then they tased him and as they're tasing him he standing up and he's, he's presenting his case because his wife is filming it. As he's getting taste, he's standing up going, I defending myself. I am defending myself from this unjust hazing. And then he runs away one of the greatest youtube fucking videos ever. This guy is, is my fucking hero. I love him. All right, and let's stick with the arresting this week. Uh, another one is a funny arrest and this is black dude getting arrested for drinking and driving. And this guy is absolutely fucking hilarious. He is adamant that he was not. He goes, I haven't been drinking, but I wasn't driving. I Sat, I was drinking, I wasn't bribing. You gotta see this guy, I'm shoving it in multiple. I will take no motherfucker test. And then they, and as he was yelling, the lady would be like, sir.

Speaker 6:          01:41:13       And he just go, Yo, why am I trying to reenact these? These are all fucking hilarious and um, be fair and balanced. We've got a drunk black guy. Now we got a drunk fucking white dude, uh, drunk redneck arrest and this guy isn't drunk. I guess he is drunk, but he's fucking, he's one of the angry as he says, the mean is shit ever. The cops going to arrest him. Um, I'll just give you a little quick little youtube trailers. They go to a rest of the guy and they already got them fucking handcuffs in the cops going, listen, now, c'mon man. We don't want to have, we don't want to have to hurt you. And guys like, I know, I don't want to have to hurt you either. Break your fucking neck. Oh fuck it. I can't make up funny. Just go watch them.

Speaker 6:          01:41:59       Um, oh. Silent night. Deadly night, part five. Watch that movie trailer. Um, for those of weak of stomach, do not watch this reporter Shit herself during interview. She has on white pants too. Just to warn you. Um, and what is the last one? Oh, the last one for all the drummers out there, I had a bunch of musicians, uh, specifically drummers send me all these, uh, all these emails this week. I had no idea the amount of musicians and the amount of drummers in particular who listened to my podcast. Everybody, yeah, you got check out Stewart Copeland, Danny carry all these fucking people actually read something. Rolling Stone about Phil Collins Today and, uh, for as much shit music as he made in the 80s, like that guy's a fucking a fucking beast of a drummer. Left handed drummer, still plays those concert toms with the no bottom, no bottom heads.

Speaker 6:          01:42:55       This guy, I'm telling you, there's not enough. If anybody's got a great youtube video that just has him just playing, I don't want to hear him solo in with Chester Thompson who was another great drummer. I just want to hear him by himself. That guy is a fucking beast. And the sad thing is he stepped out behind the kit and it was good in the beginning and then the end, it was just, you can't hurry love since since studio. Just some of the worst fucking music ever made. Um, and they're actually actually check out rolling stone. He has this whole article with it. He's talking about how, you know, he became the antichrist and he's actually confused as to why that happened. So I kind of felt bad for him as an artist, but it's like, you know, look back on that music filled. Do you really think that fucking holds up?

Speaker 6:          01:43:50       She seemed to have at a vigil, both Todd, Oh, oh Jeez. Terrible music. Um, anyways, so checked. So somebody, everybody was sending me these videos of drummers telling me all this shit that I should check out. And uh, this was the, this was the drum video that really stood out for me. Um, two things. One, this is a video I already knew about. If you guys are into like drum and bass music or if you're drummers out there and you wonder where that fucking music came from. This is video that explains, says a video video, explains the world's most underrate, most important six second drum loop. And it's, um, it's basically this, this song from a sort of obscure, I guess rnb group called the Winstons. And uh, they had this song called amen brother, which was actually a B side and it had like this, uh, I don't know what it was.

Speaker 6:          01:44:46       It was like, I don't know musically how to say it was like a fucking two bar drum break that these, uh, I don't know if people used to rap over it or what. They explained the whole fucking thing and basically how Dj's took that toolbar drum brake and isolated every sound of, of, of the recording, every like, I don't know how to musically, like if you could cut it down to like 32nd notes, they just isolated everything, the sound of the ride cymbal, the sound of the bass drum, everything and the sign of all of it together and just splice the whole fucking thing up and then re edited it in different, in a different order and then sped the whole fucking thing up. Created all these new drum beats and car and sped the whole fucking thing up past the point where human beings could actually play drums at that point.

Speaker 6:          01:45:38       But what's great about fucking human beings is I like to believe is that we're better than fucking machines. So the great dramas of the world's figured out how to fucking play that fast. That's a whole nother thing guys. Like Joe, Joe Mayor actually through fucking cause these different techniques to play in molar method, push pull and all that. They figured out how to fucking play at that level. But this video explains basically how all that drum and Bass Shit Kinda came about. And a checkout, Joe, Joe Mayor, it's another drum video we'll have up on the MN podcast. If you're interested in that shit, how, how fucking fast this guy can play and single bass drum players. I got to show you this fucking video. This guy can get three and four bass drum hits in a row, like broke, broke, broke, like doing like that heel toe shit.

Speaker 6:          01:46:29       It's fucking unbelievable. It's unfucking believable how this guy can do that. Um, anyways, I know I'm born in a lot of this is, this is even more fucking obscure than sports. But anyways, that all the drum videos you guys sent me, a lot of them I knew. And one, this is the one that I was the least familiar with because I figured everybody knows Danny carry in a tool and all those major bands. But, uh, this, this band called Russian circles, which I had never heard of. Um, and they have a drummer called Harper Louis and there's a, there's a youtube video called Russian Russian circles. Harper Louis a live at wicker park fest oh seven. And it just starts off with, you know, he just, this fucking guy, if I could play drums at this guy's level, this dude's basically, you know, as much as you want to be the guy hitting fucking 8 million drums and smashing a gong that's on fire, when it really comes down to what you want to be able to fucking be this God damn bad ass and still be playing for the song.

Speaker 6:          01:47:31       It's like, it's kind of like that David growth thing. He's another fake, the drama that David Grohl did on Queens of the Stone Age. It's like, it kind of reminds me of that. It's like he just, Ah, it's fucking unreal. The whole, it's all there. It's all fucking there. The dynamics, the building, the excitement plane, not getting in the way of anybody else he's playing with. He sees the fucking shit. Um, and I got to download some of this shit. So if anybody knows what their best album is, Russian circles, please let me know when I'm downloading that shit this week. Cause uh, I fucking the drummer alone, I got, I got to listen to more of this stuff. All right. I know I'm babbling on here. I'll, we'll end with this this week. All right, a little bit of advice here. Listen to this fucking situation. This guy got himself into, um, all right, Bill. My girlfriend is 10 years older than me. Oh, Jesus. She has two kids. Oh Jesus. And has been married and divorced twice. Dude, what the fuck? I'm 26. Jesus Christ college graduate. Has any of this made any sense to any of you? Would anybody else be out there? 26 college fucking graduate. Have a girlfriend 10 years older than you with two kids who's been married and divorced twice. Good God man. He goes, I consider myself somewhat intelligent.

Speaker 6:          01:49:03       I'm sure you are, but not in this area. Um, by that I mean you should have no problem understanding this email. Well, yeah, I know everybody trashes me. I know, I know I'm the worst when it comes to reading this shit. So anyways, here we go. He says, four weeks ago I found text messages to some dude on my girlfriend's phone that although innocent enough made it clear that whoever she was texting was on more familiar grounds than just some work colleague or a friend, Jesus Christ. Dude, is that going to be a happy ending here? I confronted her about it and it predictably led to a lot of finger pointing. We went back and forth and if and uh, for a few days and air it out our grievances, but it seemed agreeable. Now he bakes I guess point number two, two oh two more weeks passed by and Lo and behold, I find more text messages from the same fucking guy.

Speaker 6:          01:50:03       At first I tell myself, okay, maybe she can't break things off with this dude so quickly, Jesus Christ, who you know, sometimes liberal thought is a, is a great thing. Like let's have a fair fucking trial for somebody before we hang them from the nearest tree. But then this times it's fucking stupid. This is just liberal thought to the, I mean, how much of a benefit of the doubt can you give somebody, you know? So he goes, so I confront her about it and this leads to another round of finger pointing. At which point she tells me to pack my shit and leave. I'll do it. I'm gonna tell you right now before I read the rest of it, that's fucking great. You didn't have to do any dirty work. You're out. You fucking out. So anyways, he goes, were separated for a week when she asked me to come back and move in.

Speaker 6:          01:50:51       Dude, this chick is a fucking psycho. Here we go. We talk about our future together. How, sorry she is to have done that to me, et Cetera, et cetera. For Fuck Sakes. We even talking about getting married when things finally fucking evened out. I was full of piss and vinegar and felt vindicated. Vindicated that I was the one wronged in the whole situation and that she was actually making good by taking responsibility for what she had done through taking responsibility would have been fucking after he do the second you see those weird texts, just get, I'm telling you right now, just get out of the relationship. There isn't, oh, sorry. Sorry about that. Now that that's it. It's over. It's fucking over. Um, but whatever, you're 26, I guess you still haven't learned. I was dumb in my 20 self. Here we go. Let's read the rest of this.

Speaker 6:          01:51:45       Um, all was well and good until she didn't come home this Thursday night, November 11th. She came in Friday morning with no explanation, no apology, no nothing. She asked me to give her some more time, but I decided to cut bait and just get the fuck out of this situation. Hang on a second, everybody. Sorry. I had to give him a little applause. Break there. Of course, now I'm wracked with guilt of leaving the woman I loved and live with for the past five fucking year. You got what her when you were 21 dude, she was 31. Wait, let's do the math. She was 31. You were 21. She was already married twice. All right. This chick's is psycho and you know what that means? She's fucking great and bed. You were 21. She fucking devastated you with fucking her pussy, right? Best blowjob. You have a had.

Speaker 6:          01:52:34       Isn't that what happened? And next thing you know, you have to fucking too young and dumb me. The of you fell for Jesus Christ. He stayed there for five fucking years. So anyway, I guess just check, still calling them. Tell him she still wants to get back together. I feel like every time I sack up and do what I think is best for me, she wants me back. And every time what I do, what's best for us as a couple, she uses that as an opportunity to fuck with me all over again. Yes. Yes, you're absolutely right. Listen to your gut. This guy, see, he knows the fucking answers. He's listening to his gut. Good fucking man. Um, is this, is it just that chicks can handle a guy that is emotionally invested or do I just happen to be dealing with one of those sociopath's that doesn't give a fuck what she does so long as it suits her in the moment.

Speaker 6:          01:53:28       Yes. This plenty of fucking good women. That was not plenty. Goodwin's there's good women out there. All right? Just like good. A good man's hard to find this. Finding a good woman's also difficult. All right. But no, you happen to be dealing with an absolute fucking sociopath. All right. She had a fucked up childhood. Something happened to her. She got touched. Her fucking dad took off. I don't know. Or She just got the fucking, she got one of those bad brains. You know, I began to tell you guys my theory on that, the a brain, the bee brain and the sea brain, the brain is the genius to be brain is the uh, oh, he's a good fucking shit. You know? Fitzy and then the sea brain is your fucking mouth breathing moron. All right. And when it comes to being a sociopath, that's like just a, that's just like getting an option on the car.

Speaker 6:          01:54:16       All brains come with that option. It's all available like satellite radio, you know, you get satellite radio in a fucking Bentley. You can also get it my fucking Prius. All right, so did that make any fucking sense? You got a sociopath with the fucking, she could even have the a brain. That's the sad thing about having a fucked up childhood. She could actually be a fucking genius, but she's got the sociopath shit. So tell her go call fucking doctor drew. All right? And you get the fuck out of the relationship. So anyways, he say, I'd imagine you'd agree that I did the right thing. Uh, but it always helps to get a little bit of press, better perspective on it. Dude, I totally understand. You've been in a five year relationship, you're emotionally invested in this shit. So you know what the right thing to do is, but your emotions keep fucking with you.

Speaker 6:          01:55:06       All right? So what you got to know is just look, going through a breakup is painful. All right? It's not going to not be painful, but just because it's painful doesn't mean that it's not the right thing to do. You are 100 fucking percent doing the right fucking thing. Your 26 year old years old, you're in the prime of your fucking life. All right? Get out of that situation. Okay. She's 10 years older than you. By the time you're 29, she's going to be hitting fucking menopause, all right? Or something like that. Whatever. Sliding into it. I have no fucking idea what she's going to be doing. She's to be wearing those mom jeans at that point if she's not already, which I don't think she is. She's probably that fucking, you know that, uh, that anorexic cougar look, you know where they got a varicose vein in between their fucking, you can see their breast plate, uh, Jesus Christ will stay on topic.

Speaker 6:          01:56:03       Yeah. So to just get out of that, hang out with your fucking Fellas, you know, hang out with your buddies. Go out and fucking have some beers. Join a gym, get fucking shredded. Go Out, start talking shit when you're ready. But don't go back to that man. You dodged a fucking bullet. The fact that you were with her for five years and you didn't knock her up and you got out of it, and even after five years, you're only 26 years old, you made the best fucking move you're going to make. All right. And now this is what you need to do. You've been in a relationship for five years. You need to be single for at least a fucking year and a half. And I don't mean just be single and fucking booze. Figure out what the fuck you looking for. All right? And when you meet a girl, if she doesn't have it, just walk a banger and leaf.

Speaker 6:          01:56:49       You know, there's nothing wrong with having a good fucking time, but do not get sucked into another fucking relationship because you're going to, cause you're going to have to go through this shit again. You know? Well, you just sit there and you know what's fucking wrong, but you don't want to go through the fucking pain of it and you keep coming back. It's a fucking nightmare. It's a fucking nightmare. Good for you, sir. I'm fucking proud of you. He did the right thing. You sorta a fucking wavering cause you're going through the motions. You're only 26. She got with her when you were 21 is probably your first major fucking break up. So it's acceptable that you fucked up and went back that second time. But do not go back again and if any your fucking friends are listening to this. Don't let them do that shit.

Speaker 6:          01:57:29       All right. Time to a fucking bar stool and start throwing drinks down his throat. Ah, that's it. That's the Monday morning podcast for this week. Uh, anything else? Where am I going to be this week? Oh, this week I'm going to be at the uh, the listener theater in Washington DC. There's only a, I believe, oh, under a hundred tickets left.
