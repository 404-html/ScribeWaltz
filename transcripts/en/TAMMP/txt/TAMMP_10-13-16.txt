Speaker 3:          00:02:52       we had joy. We had fun. We had seasons in the sun, but the hills that we climbed, we're just seasons.

Speaker 1:          00:02:57       Hi, good pot. Goodbye Papa. Please pray for me. I was the black sheep of the family. I was a drug user. He tried to teach me right from wrong. Too much wine and too much song. Oh yeah, he's partying. I wonder how I got along. Good bipap. It's hard to die out. Jesus Christ shut the fuck you know, at. This guy's not dying. He just wants attention. You're not fuck that song. And I'm sorry, I brought it up. How are you everybody? How's it going on this Thursday afternoon? Oh, Jesus. What happened last night? Well, the, uh, the, the national hockey league started their season.

Speaker 2:          00:03:35       Not [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:03:40       do what? A fucking game. Austin Matthews, Austin Matthews, Austin Matthews, one more time, but the amount of goals he scored Austin fucking Matthews for goals and his debut in the NHL was so fucking cool as his parents were in the crowd. It's a mother started crying after the hat trick. And, uh, you know, no one knows who he is. Nobody's paying attention. Then all of a sudden it was just like, whoa, Whoa, whoa. Hey. Right. Next thing you know, you guys got four fucking goals. So immediately after the game, of course, they going like, do you feel a pressure now that you're going to have to score four goals every game? Um, you know what it is? It's his second goal.

Speaker 5:          00:04:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:21       There was just too many moves to many people's fucking legs. He went around, it's put the puck through, lifted the fucking stick, and then there was like half an inch between the goalie and the post. He somehow found it. I mean, it was just fucking amazing game. So I bet everybody Toronto has to be really excited about that. And my Boston Bruins start tonight. See what they got. I don't even know. I just know they start tonight. Boston Bruins. Hey, we go, bro Wins. Here we go. Jesus the Columbus Blue Jackets. Why does Columbus have a team and why did they name it the blue jackets? Well, you know, it's named after the union soldiers is civil war. Oh, is it? Is? Is that what it is? You know, I believe a long time ago you guys had a fucking team. Then they had a fucking team and the Cleveland something or others and then they fucking ice. I know that name. But Cleveland barons of something and the whole fucking thing. Uh,

Speaker 5:          00:05:19       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:05:20       It like, it didn't even move to another city. It just died.

Speaker 5:          00:05:25       Alright.

Speaker 1:          00:05:26       Cleveland Barons yet the Cleveland Barons were professional hockey team in the National Hockey League from 1976 to 1978 that's all. That's all. That's all the love. Click. Cleveland's a big 10 fucking state and then professional sports. All right. How state's been around longer than any of those people? All right. There was a relocation of the California, all the Real California golden seals. That's right. Moved. Um, which you played in Oakland since 1967 then they moved. They basically can't blame Ohio for that. They died in California. Man. Talk about it. Out of the frying pan into the fire, they moved from Oakland to Cleveland.

Speaker 3:          00:06:07       Had the owner of that team ever watched hockey and kind of got it's, I mean, I guess it is a cold weather state, but Jesus Christ, after only two s two seasons, the team merged with the Minnesota north stars. Now Dallas Stars. Oh, they merged. I thought they just thought they just folded as a result. The NHL field, it only 17 stirring 17 teams during the 78 79 season as a 2016 the barons remained the last franchise in the four major North American sports leagues to cease

Speaker 1:          00:06:37       variation. Ohio did not have another NHL team until the Columbus blue jackets join the league in the, in the year 2000. Um, so there's that, there you go. Now. Now, now you know what that's about. Um, all right, so I am chomping at the fucking bit. Everybody. You probably wondering why. Bill, what, what, what's, what's different about this day than any other day in your life? Um, I'm taping my next standup special standup special number five, I believe. Right? Why do I do this? Let it go. You people are all the same. I'm sorry you feel that way. I don't have a name for this one yet.

Speaker 1:          00:07:19       How about old freckles? You've done it again. Oh, Magoo. You've done. Oh, freckles. He have done it again. Um, yeah, but I am a, I've been doing some spots around town last night. I have not been drinking. I've been fucking working out, you know, trying to get fucking into HD shape. You know what I mean? That's the thing about all these broads bitching about here in Hollywood. Hollywood creates these body images. It happens to everybody. Nobody wants to be a fat fuck on television. Forget about this. The, the new HD shit, we can literally see the cartilage and somebody fucking nose. I mean, you can't go. You can't be boozy. You can't be anything. Everybody though. What the fuck happened to you, right?

Speaker 3:          00:08:04       You gotta go out there and shape. All right ladies. So put your fucking whining, get on the God damn treadmill like everybody else. Um, it's just hard. It's harder for women to lose weight again. Yeah. It is definitely harder for women to lose weight with all those free fucking drink she gets.

Speaker 6:          00:08:25       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:08:25       You know, those are empty calories. You know what I mean? Think about being a manager. You have to pay for your empty calories and the fucking person you brought in a lot of the times. Um, or who knows? Maybe these new, the millennials now, now that they're, they're more progressive than I've, I've just sort of left the herd now and now I'm the old guy spouting crazy shit from yesteryear. Maybe the ladies go in now

Speaker 1:          00:08:48       and they just walk up and they say, hey, good looking.

Speaker 3:          00:08:51       I like your stubble and your suspenders. Uh, would you like a, what'd

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       you do? What do they call a micro brew? What do they call it? Do they call? Those fucking things does ridiculously stupid fucking beers that all tastes the goddamn same. They all have way too many hops in them. You know, they're heavy as shit. Every fucking wonderful brewed right down the street. Yeah. It tastes like it. To do it in your bathtub. Um, Mike, not micro brewery. They call those fucking does. Not Micro Bruce. It is that, but they got a new name for it. Ah, you know, it's amazing. I know this is going to surprise you, but, but the name escapes me. So anyways, I'm going to be warming up for my, uh, my special starting Saturday night in Washington DC, our nation's capitol.

Speaker 7:          00:09:38       Okay. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:09:42       I'm just going to walk around to anybody who's in government, right. And I'm just going to scream really in their face. That's, that's my goal during the wickets, walked down the street, just saying that to everybody. I'm just blaming them because my choices are Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. That's, that's just what I'm doing. Anybody with the fucking blue blazer and a red or a blue tie, I'm grabbing them by the shoulders. You're not going to do that. But I would love to do it. I would like to do it, but you know, post nine 11,

Speaker 1:          00:10:14       you can't walk around doing shit like that and he and I don't want to get no fight. I'm an old man, you know, I going to tell you that time I went down and I looked at the Pentagon like a couple, about six months after nine 11. I must've told you that story. Right? By the way, I met the national theater. I forgot to say that. Uh, there are still tickets left cause I'm kind of doing this weird run in this theater that usually has like the lion king. Um, and I'm also doing like a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and there Saturday and a Wednesday. So it's kind of weird. A lot of school nights shit. So, uh, you know, she want to come down to watch me fucking do the, my pregame analysis on my fucking standup set. I'm going crazy cause I got to tape this fucking thing because, uh, I have all this other new shift that wants to come out and I feel like I'm stuck in time here so it has to happen. Um, but anyways, post nine 11. All right. I was in New York on nine 11. I was on the upper east side, the 70s all the way by the East River. And uh,

Speaker 1:          00:11:18       you know, there's a lot of like old wives tales told by people who lived in New York during that time. Dude, you wouldn't have known anything was going on. It was a fucking beautiful day. And even as it went down as a collapsed and all that, when I walked outside, I didn't see anything in the air. And if they mean that was like a couple of miles away and if it wasn't on television, I never would have even known that it happened. All I remember was walking around the upper east side

Speaker 1:          00:11:43       trying to block out what the fuck just happened. Like a typical Irish, German, Irish Catholic. I'm sad feelings, block them out, act like nothing's happening. And uh, I just remember walking around up there and like the fucking, there was people, it was so weird to me cause upper east side, they're a bunch of people who actually could afford to buy an apartment. You know, a lot of them came from fucking money or what? I don't know what the hell they did, but they were, I remember them sitting outside on a beautiful sunny day with that horror was going down there and they were eating, uh, know breakfast and shit. And everybody felt it had that weird sort of like, I feel like I should be doing something, but what can I get the theremin on the eggs benedict? Um, I remember one time when I went to a fucking wedding, this asshole, it's rich cunt. I told me, I said, yeah, I just moved to New York City. He goes, where do you live? And I was like, I lived on 97th, between third and Lex. And he goes, Oh yeah, what building? I remember thinking like, what do you mean, what building can I told him the address?

Speaker 1:          00:12:48       And I didn't realize what a fucking conti rich person question that is. Cause you know, when those giant high rises, they always have to have a name like the Gotham, you know, the Bilderberg or whatever. But if you just, you know, that's like a big thing in New York. It's a doorman elevator building. Uh, you know, a ridiculous amount of square footage with the fucking view. Or you had what I had on the upper east side, which I actually, I mean the only thing I hate to, I lived on 79th and York, if you live in New York, there's a cluster of buildings over there near that park where they have that pool. Um, it's great fucking park. And they had like pull up bars and shit. I don't know. I hope they still have him. He's to go over there all the fucking time. And occasionally when I go to New York I still go to that park if I'm in the area, cause most gyms first whatever reasons don't have pull up ours, they'd like monkey bars placed to do dips.

Speaker 1:          00:13:48       Um, and then they had this pool and they had like a time and shit. It was fucking great. So he could swim laps with all these other old people. It was awesome. But it was this cluster of old buildings and um, I think they would like six floor walk ups and I lived on the fifth floor and you had to like fucking walk like city blocks. I had to walk up to York over to first, second, third and then was at Lexington was next and then down two blocks to 77th street. Which prop four months of the year. It wasn't bad. It was actually a nice walk, but all the rest of it, either the humidity or how cold it was. It was a motherfucker. I used to wait for the cross town bus just to stay out of it, just to have a little bit of air conditioning or a little bit of heat. Um, except when the kids got out of school, I don't know what the fuck it is about New York City kids, but they are fucking lunatics. They have fucking lunatics. I don't know if it's because they see too much or whatever, but they had just completely fucking out of control.

Speaker 7:          00:14:52       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       Like their behavior is just fucking, I just remember just sitting there like, none of these kids have ever gotten spanked.

Speaker 7:          00:14:59       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:15:00       Or something. Jesus. I mean, I just would be sitting there just like, I want to beat the shit out of every fucking kid on this bus. The girls too. So anyways, I'm fucking digressing here. So,

Speaker 7:          00:15:17       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:15:19       I went down and I saw like after nine 11 one or that one piece of, of the world trade was standing up, I went down, I saw that. And uh, I remember down the comedy cellar for months app, like a month after it was still burning. I'll never forget that smell. So on went down to DC. I mean, I knew that by then you knew that this was a changing moment in history and it was just like, you know, I wanted to see like a,

Speaker 7:          00:15:40       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:15:41       you know, go over the Pentagon and see how bad the damage was. So I didn't realize I was such an idiot. I didn't realize that the Pentagon is like the Pentagon. I thought the Pentagon was also kind of like the Lincoln Memorial. Like you could just kind of go to it as a tourist, which she can, but I just, there's like a subway stop and you just get off at the Pentagon and I'm walking around, there's all these people and like playing close and then you'd see people in like air force outfits over marine outfits. And so I was thinking all right, they work here. But everybody else in plain clothes is like me. I didn't realize that they all kind of fucking work there and nobody gives like an office. It's a giant fucking office building and the shape of a Pentagon. So I start looking around.

Speaker 1:          00:16:20       I mean it's basically a circle with, with points on it, right? That's what a what a what a Pentagon is. How many sides to a Pentagon bill? Oh, I don't, I don't know. It's more than five. It's a triangle. Then there's a hexagon and then there's a pro Plexxikon. I don't know what the fuck it is. You do? Didn't know what I knew when I had to know it for the test and that's never come up in my life. You know what I mean? You've got a quartet, you got a quintet that's jazz, Mata, math. I'm into jazz, but isn't music just numbers put together beautifully. Sorry. So I'm like, I'm standing there and this point he fucking circle going. Do I go to the ride too? I go to laughed. I kind of go laugh, then I go right. Then I started walking back left and then I'm just fucking start walking around this thing.

Speaker 1:          00:17:03       I'm trying to peek around the corner and they go, maybe it should have gone the other way and are basically not realizing it. I'm looking shifty as hell. And of course there's like 50 fucking cameras on me. Like what the fuck is this dude doing? Right? And I'm walking, I'm looking around where all of a sudden this fucking, was it a jeep or a golf cart? I Dunno what she says. Ooh. Pulls up next to me in this. Fuck. This fucking guy gets out. Like he, you know when powers booth ever plays a military guy, he was like that with a baret. Like that's how much he was decorated, it seemed, no, no, no, he didn't have all that shit. But he had some shit on his fucking shirt. All right. And he had the bra and I remember he got out and he was like doing thing, you know when someone's a Bowery to snap your neck and they're smiling at the same time.

Speaker 1:          00:17:53       Like that was the look on his face. Like he was showing me his teeth smiling, but everything else just basically said is I'm going to pull you fucking thrown out like macgruber. And um, he came up and he's just like, hey buddy, what are you doing? And he was like looking through to the back of my head. And immediately I was just like, Oh, you know, I was just, and I was just, then I didn't know what to say and I was like, oh my God, what if he knew one of the people that died here and an ah, just go. It was just a, you know, a comedian. I'm in town playing Teddy's house, a comedy, and just then he fucking took my name and then it, then it dawned on me why they were coming up to me. And the whole thing just made sense.

Speaker 1:          00:18:35       Like, oh, this is like a military building built. This isn't the Jefferson Memorial. Um, you're walking around one of the most top secret fucking places and you're looking around and you look like a crazy white guy. Right. So then it just struck me as funny and then all I was trying to hold back a laugh, right? Classic White Privilege here. Right. I could actually have this guy come up to me outside the Pentagon and I can still find the humor in it because I know I'm not going to get arrested. Right. Is that what white privilege is? I don't know. I'm stuck in this wonderful fucking position. I'm just going to stare into that now and people just say white privilege. I'd be like, Oh yeah, it's unbelievable.

Speaker 7:          00:19:16       Wow.

Speaker 1:          00:19:20       Ah. Anyways, what was I saying? Okay, so the fucking guy, um, he's taken down my name and then I kind of have like this shit eating grin on my face. Cause you know, at that point they both, they all kind of, cause it was the guy who drove the jeep who is like fucking Tom Cruise and taps. He just couldn't let it go. Right. So I kind of feel him staring at me like a fucking lunatic. And I'm like, well, if this guy here with all this shit on his shirt, I can feel him letting me go. You're not going to arrest me, the driver of the jeep, join the military to be a fucking show for go fuck yourself. So now the comic in me is starting to come up and I want to irritate this guy, so I really start fucking smiling or what I was again, man, sorry.

Speaker 1:          00:20:01       I go, hey man, you want to come out to the show and blah, blah blah. And the guy see, you know, he's, he's Kinda gone down from, I'm going to fucking rip your throat out to kind of like, I'll, maybe I'll just, you know, I don't know what stick a bayonet and your side, he's, he's Kinda down to that. Is that less? I don't know. Whatever the fuck it is. A, I'll just waterboard you, he sees, sees is look as craziness is, I'm just gonna waterboard you now. And um, I get to the end and he's that guy, right? And he gets in the jeep and the other guy was just stare and fucking, uh, like daggers at me, the jeep. And I was just looking right at him smiling and he goes, no, he goes, you're free to keep walking around this thing, you know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

Speaker 1:          00:20:40       And I was just like, Nah, man, I'm cool. I'm cool. I can only nobody else driving up to the fucking jeep. So they go to away and as he would drive away, I remember the Chi in the jeep, the guy drive and like yelled, I think he was trying to make me jump, like it drove wearing just like that. And I didn't jump. And I just sort of, without like looking back, I just put my hand up and waved at him. And, uh, and that's my fucking Pentagon story. So anyways, I'm going to, uh, I'm going to DC and, um, this is the greatest thing flying in Friday. This is the greatest fucking thing. Every mother fucking time I fly into DC like an asshole. I forget that Washington Dulles airport is like 30 fucking miles. I don't know. I don't even know where it is.

Speaker 1:          00:21:27       North, south west of DC. I don't know what I just know. It's 30 fucking miles away. All right. And if I leave here at like nine in the morning, by the time I get out there, it's going to be right in the middle of rush hour and it absolutely fucking sucks. And every time I do it, I always go, ah, fuck. I should have flown into Reagan Reagan's right downtown. Every city has a cute little mom and pop airport like Dallas. You don't fly into the fucking Bingo. Bango one. You go to love field. Just like John Kennedy did way back in 1963 you're flying into that one. That's where you want to go. You don't want to go to the big ones. You fucking get in. You get out. It's lovely. Lovely. It's cute little fucking airport. So I'm not that. Reagan said small. I mean, it was a fucking, was a giant airport back in the day and age.

Speaker 1:          00:22:18       I think they just, I don't know the population or was too close to the White House, have no focus, kind of a fucking watch list. Am I going to be on, on this podcast, all these buzzwords, nine 11 twin towers. I said Pentagon, Pentagon, and White House, and I named both candidates that are running for president and I'm going to the nation's capitol. All right. You might not want to want to go to Saturday show. You might want to wait until I get out of fucking being detained. God knows that guy driving in the chief's probably worked his way up, you know, probably motivated them. You know, like Obama motivated fucking Trump. You know, when he trashed him at that fucking rich person breakfast or whatever the fuck it was. Fuck, I gotta take this phone call. Hang on one second. Hang on. Hang on. Okay, I'm back.

Speaker 1:          00:23:06       So anyways, yeah. Obama made flake when Obama made fun of fucking Trump at that senior breakfast, whatever the fuck it was. And I think that that, like there's theories that that's what motivated him to run for president, which, you know, as much as I don't like the gun, it's pretty fucking awesome that he was like, you know what? Fuck this. I'm going to take that guys who didn't fucking just sit there and think something like that and then to actually do it, even if you are a Trump, that's fucking amazing.

Speaker 5:          00:37:50       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:37:51       I have not flipped out a technology. I've had a couple of issues. I relaxed. I tried to figure it out. I was actually able to figure out how to, uh, you know, just when I download some music, how to have it automatically go to my phone. You know, cause sometimes it would do it. Sometimes it wouldn't. If I was on Wifi, I didn't know how to do it. I was like, how can I get it to automatically do it? And I just, I, I just googled it like a normal person

Speaker 1:          00:38:17       found out the fucking answer, like a normal person. And it all went to my phone and I said, well, I got to give this a try. I want to download that new green day album. I want to see what's going on with that fucking thing. Right. What's his face? Trey cools on the cover. I don't know if it's modern drummer drum. Um, we were in a hounds tooth fucking so, right. And I'm like, that's right. They got a new album out. This advertising is working. So I went and I downloaded the thing and boom, went right to my phone, you know, and then I sinked up my address books and now my fit, my numbers are all floating back and forth. I now know that I could scroll down and see how many contacts I have, not only on my fucking phone, but also on my computer.

Speaker 1:          00:39:04       But now I can't figure this out. Why is this doing this? Oh, see that. I just figured something else out. You hit the little x thing. I have 193 cards people, I gotta tell you something. Um, overrated. Alright. The panic of losing all your phone numbers and all your contacts. Here's the deal. Within 10 days, anybody who's in your life is going to text you like, hey man, I haven't heard from you. What's going on? Then you get them through them. You just get the, you know, you get everybody else. I have 193, sorry, my eyes are going, it's not one 98, one 93. Um, and after today that'll be up over 200. And uh, you know, I still haven't turned on my other phone yet. I'm going to wait until it just completely fucking dries out. I mean, what's the point? I have all the numbers that I really need and I was able to get a few that I didn't think I was going to get.

Speaker 1:          00:39:49       Um, and like I said, if you know me and I haven't texted you when you listen to this podcast for whatever reason, texts me cause I don't have your number anymore. All right. And I've actually had like three or four people going, hey man, listen to your podcast. I heard that you lost all your numbers. Just reaching out man. I was like, Hey, thanks. I really appreciate it. Do you have so and so's so and so's and so and so's? And then I just, I just build it up. You had built, we get it. You basically doing exactly what anybody else would be doing and your situation. You're, you're talking about yourself, like you're doing something groundbreaking. Okay. You got me. All right. Let's end with this. Um, I told you I went down to fucking iron maiden rabbit hole for some reason. Right now I'm listening to James Brown in early iron maiden.

Speaker 1:          00:40:32       I don't know why. And I'm playing drums along with it and I'm having the fucking time of my life. And, uh, I've been playing to the prisoner. I still can't do that popup a bat with a fucking Bass Drum. How fast Clive bird's foot was. I can get it up to speed though. Um, I've been fucking with that. And then of course, um, where eagles dare, which is just fucking ridiculous. But that's the great thing about youtube. You know, everybody breaks everything down and then you don't even have to fucking develop your years as a musician. So then you learn how to play shift that you didn't really figure out some, he gave you the answers to the test. Every, he's like, wow, man, you're really fucking good. And then all of a sudden, Sunday somebody writes an original song and they say, Hey, come up with some drums to this and you have nowhere to search. And then they go, oh, that's who you really are. Um, all right, that's the podcast here. Lay Ladies and gentlemen. That's the Thursday afternoon podcasts. I was just checking in on you. I hope your, uh, your, your, your, your week's been going good. Even if it isn't, it's already Thursday. Look at that. Look at you. Get Your paycheck

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       today. You cash it. You have a couple, two or three. You know, you put on your fucking me undies. You know, you go out, you get hammered, you bang the chick down the fucking way. Right? Next day she comes in, she fucking Rad. Shout you get fired. And then your boss goes to zip the recruiter and he fucking advertises a position. He gets somebody better than you with more me undies. Right? But he's got clubbed Debbie, your breath. So they got to get rid of him. Gone call back to all the fucking things, you know, and they kick him right in the ass if it's distilled James. All right. And then that's it. I think that's it. They mail his ass home through stamps.com. All right,

Speaker 1:          00:42:12       go fuck yourselves. Have a great weekend. You can't enjoy the music. As we sort of segue into, uh, some Monday morning podcast greatest hits from a podcast from a different time in a year going by or maybe earlier this year depending on how funny it was. I had no fucking idea. I'll see you

Speaker 8:          00:42:52       exactly that. This reality grinding to a memory of a time.

Speaker 9:          00:43:10       I want to do that ted.com just look up robots and try to find the one with, uh, with this, this, this lady is sitting there. She's fucking talking about, you know, having robots around the house.

Speaker 8:          00:43:25       Okay.

Speaker 9:          00:43:25       You know what I mean? It is the stupidest thing. Okay? First of all, she's whoring it up for no particular reason in the beginning. I don't know why she's wearing like these hooker boots. She sitting there talking about robots to a bunch of egg head nerds and she's still got a horror it up. It's like, can't you just stand on the merit of the fucking speech that you wrote? Do you really got to get people's Dicks half full? Just so they'll keep listening to you? How fucking insecure are you? You're talking about robots in the house, walking down the hallway. What's up? Fucking high five and a God damn robot. That right. It's not like it's a movie. It's fucking real. That's not compelling enough of a subject. You can't hold the audience's interest. You still have to put on your street walker boots.

Speaker 8:          00:44:15       Okay.

Speaker 9:          00:44:16       It's weird. She has on street walker boots, but she has on a modest skirt. It comes down a little or maybe cause the boots go up so fucking high.

Speaker 8:          00:44:25       Okay.

Speaker 9:          00:44:25       You know what I mean? I mean the, isn't that basically a rule? If you're going to wear the fucking thigh high boots, you basically have to have on a mini skirt. All right, so she starts her speech, right? Not a whore, just dressed like a whore. Like she put on half of our call and Wean costume and then, oh wait a minute, I have to give a speech. So she goes down there and she's just like, she actually sounds, what she's talking about is smart, but she doesn't sound that smart. So I don't know if some nerd wrote the fucking speech for her and got like, I dunno fucking broke out in hives right before the speech. So they sent her out instead. But she's just up there like, you know what, I always allow Gol I remember just seeing star wars and seeing thethey po going, wouldn't that just be awesome to have like a robot? And that's like two jobs that just to like kind of talk to and like joke around with. And she starts talking about how she feels that robots should be in the fucking house because she wants her own c three Po my saying that right. Am I pausing at the wrong time? I go into the c three p o c three Po c three p o

Speaker 9:          00:45:38       don't know, whatever. That's such a stupid fucking movie because one of the most overrated fucking Goddamn motherfucking movies, a vault. I would rather watch muppets take Manhattan. I think that that holds up better because at least there's adult humor in there, you know, you know, totally ripped off. Use the force, Joel Olsteen that fucking skinny dad gay. When you were in a tee shirt cheese, won't she a half a t shirt? Just think about it. It's going to happen. He totally stole that whole vibe. I don't even know what that makes sense. So you're not, furthermore, I don't care. Plowing ahead to this lady sitting there, lady sitting there talking about these fucking robots. You got to watch the video and about, I don't know, 10 11 minutes in, I can't remember where the fuck it is. They cut to somebody shooting the shit with a robot and it looks like it's basically a head coming out of a giant VCR

Speaker 9:          00:46:31       and he's like sitting there like it's be like if you had a VCR, their head coming out of it but like a robot head like bolts for eyes and shit. But it has like eyelashes for some stupid reason like blinking. Like it needs to blink. Right. And he's sitting at it like he's at his desk, like almost face to face with the thing. He's just like, Hey fucking r two d two look up. My girlfriend bought me and he showed some sort of fucking, I dunno what the hell. At some macho chain of a watch. I can't remember what the fuck it was. And then the robot is just like, oh my God, that's real. A actress thing, dead shape and it's movement. It's fucking head. Can I ask either, this might be the dumbest question ever or just painfully obvious. Why the fuck would I need that? Well, why would I need that? Like why? Why won't I just to my friend, you know what I'm saying? It was, it's like the baseball kid from way back in the day. Remember that Shit. I talked about it here when the podcast, one of these Mondays,

Speaker 9:          00:47:38       these have the baseball kid, it's called baseball kid, the baseball kid, a baseball, his work, you're willing to do baseball, cable, Phd and it was a cardboard cutout of a friend basically that you don't have throwing a fucking baseball to you. You know? It was basically for the kid with no friends. So now they've upgraded that to the person who has no fucking friends. You. What's great is that I bet that guy didn't even have a girlfriend. I bet he bought the watch for himself. And now he's now part of the sickness is he just fucking lies to this robot about this life that he doesn't have. And you know, once you start doing that, it's an inevitable, it's an inevitability. It's a fucking a cirrhosis of the liver that that guy's eventually going to stick his fucking human dick in that robot mouth in the second dead fucking happens. That's it.

Speaker 5:          00:48:31       Okay.

Speaker 9:          00:48:32       It's the end of the fucking human rights. I'll tell you right now, this fucking, the scientists out there fucking robots right now, they're out there banging robots, you know, under the whole platform of fucking research. It's actually really scary. Like, cool, go watch this shit on ted.com. They've got another one showing how we're fighting wars now. And like these guys sit in Arizona, they go to basically go to work, they go to war and then they come home after fucking blowing up some bad guys. Uh, hopefully bad guys, right? And then they fucking go and they sit down and hang out with their kids and they're sitting there talking about how, uh,

Speaker 5:          00:49:11       okay,

Speaker 9:          00:49:11       you know, now the bad guys are getting the robots and blah, blah, blah. It's just, it's fucking inevitable. All those drones, they're basically eventually all this shit. They use it over there. I think eventually they're going to use over here.

Speaker 5:          00:49:25       Yeah.

Speaker 9:          00:49:25       You know?

Speaker 5:          00:49:26       Okay.

Speaker 9:          00:49:26       In the future there'll be no more skipping jury duty.

Speaker 5:          00:49:30       Okay.

Speaker 9:          00:49:31       The second you skip it, you're going to wake up in the morning, peek out the window, and there's going to be a fucking drone just hovering there. You have seven x to get to court or you will be vaporized. It's going to be one of those fucking things. Is this the least interesting thing you ever heard in your life? I mean it didn't. I just basically do every science fiction movie. Has there ever been a science fiction movie where they predict something great? That's what I'm going to do. I want to be original here for once in my fucking life. Let's go the other way.

Speaker 5:          00:50:00       Okay.

Speaker 9:          00:50:01       It's going to be a friendly drone.

Speaker 9:          00:50:04       It's going to be outside that window. Go back to sleep. It's okay. We shut your cloud to go down to the Jerry Dodi it now. We don't need you, so you will be vaporized. You will be vaporized. That's the way to do it. I think that that's, that's gonna be the, the, that that's going to be the funeral in 2020 I think by 2020 we're going to know definitely where you go when you die and if it's anywhere other than here, people are just going to choose to tap out. You know, it's going to be like getting a vasectomy. Just getting fucking vaporized. Still an intense fucking procedure that, that needs a serious talking before you do it. But you know, Eh, you know, I'm just getting 70 to change. You know, like when people on the east coast moved to like Minnesota or fucking San Diego just needed a change. That's what's going to happen. People just going to get vaporized here in the future. It's fucking true. You know, I know you guys are rolling your eyes right now, but you don't have access to the information that I do. Okay. So please reserve your judgment or whatever, whatever. Temper your judgment. Don't be hasty with you, judge. Whatever that point. Yeah.

Speaker 8:          00:51:19       Can expression is human caused by the stars in the sky. Okay.

Speaker 10:         00:51:58       Hey, what's going on? It's still bear. It is the Monday morning podcast that I'm doing at eight 30 at night Pacific coast time. I uh, apologize for the late recording this week. I had a, I had a really busy Monday and uh, I had one window where I could have a, I could have recorded, but I was so fucking pissed at my health insurance people that I just didn't want to, I didn't want to go on screaming for the weekend, trying to be more mellow. I don't even know what the fuck that word means. But anyway, this is the Monday morning podcast. I do one of these every God damn week can still, I'm still a little pissed, you know, people send me questions and if you have any questions for me, just send them to bill at [inaudible] dot com or you can go on my myspace page and send them there.

Speaker 10:         00:52:47       Any questions you have, I'll answer them. If you have a list of stuff that you feel is overrated or underrated, I will read that. And if I say something you think is stupid during the podcast and you need to correct me, you can correct me. Like this feller last week I was talking about that creepy commercial, you know that commercial where they got the mothers did their advertising batteries and they've got the mother and the park and she can't find her kid. She's like Michael and uh, you know, well since she takes out this little device that the doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, all of a sudden a kid comes over the fucking hill and they don't show wearing any bracelet or any sort of hat with an antenna on it. And I'm like, they're getting you ready? You ready for the future where they're going to want to put microchips and your kids.

Speaker 10:         00:53:34       Okay, so this guy says, you know what bill, I was listening to your podcast and I actually looked up that commercial to see what the deal was. And it's actually the brick house locator. It doesn't use it ship, sorry to shoot down your dreams of the future. Instead it has a key chain type receiver that the parents clipped to your children's shoes, jacket or backpack. And it's a homing device to let you know their location in second. Okay. Well, you know what, I wasn't saying that there was a chip in the kid and what I was saying is that they don't show that he has the clip and it's very subtly getting you ready for them to put a chip in you in the future. And uh, I don't know why, I don't even thought you're arguing with me on this point, but you're being a little company.

Speaker 10:         00:54:21       You know, I realized that the kid didn't have a chip in it, but haven't you seen the stories on the news where these people who work at corporations are like, yes, my company put a chip in the and I don't have a problem to it. I with it. I have access to very sensitive materials. I happened to know the secret formula to a Kentucky Fried Chicken, so I need to have them in bed, a fucking code in my fucking microchip in my og. Really? You know, Colonel Sanders knew the fucking recipe. They didn't have to put a chip in. It's fucking goatee. Did they?

Speaker 10:         00:54:57       You know something. This is just, I'm not going to make it. I'm not going to make it in the future. When they become more and more of a fucking police state and they're doing this shit, I swear to God. If people just line up like fucking sheep, I don't know what I'm going to do and I swear to God, they're going to be like, well, he ain't doing nothing wrong. You shouldn't have a problem with it. You know that, that fucking argument about how the government can listen to your phone calls now. And that was people's big argument. They would just like, well, dude, if you're not doing anything, then why would you, could you please wrap the cord around your throat and choke yourself? Read a little bit of history before you open your fucking mouth. You Moron. Every fucking period in history just has horrific events of maniacs with too much power.

Speaker 10:         00:55:49       Putting people to death constantly happens. It's happening right now. Genocide. Has genocide ever took any even taking a weekend off? It's unreal. It's not happening over in fucking Europe or over here. People just, you know, am I getting preachy? I'm going to shut the fuck up. All right, let's move on to the next thing. Um, oh, is a question. Hey Bill. Uh, will you be on the Jim Norton Hbo Show? Why? Yes. Yes, I will. Um, I had the privilege of performing with little Jimmy Norton in May. We taped it and it's going to be airing October 23rd Friday night at midnight. So, uh, set your Tivo because I imagined you guys all have lives. You all be out there partying and up come home, shit faced and watch it. And I, speaking of which, let's plug little Jimmy show a down and dirty with Jim Norton is on every Friday night, HBO at midnight and a, I got to tell you, I was really impressed with the level of a comedian that they had.

Speaker 10:         00:56:49       There was a lot of guys I didn't know and I had to gone go on after this dude Sean rouse, who I had worked with before and I thought it was hilarious, but when I saw him, when I had to go on after him, I was literally standing in the wings going like, I don't think I could follow this guy because, uh, I dunno. Absolutely fucking brilliant comedian Sean routes. I think it's s e a n r O. U. Sfe. I Dunno, he opens for Doug. Stan hope a lot. So go over to Doug Stan hopes web website. I'm sure he's got something on their own link over there or check Doug. Stan hope. Look at me hyping other comedians. There's three fuck fucking hilarious people that you should go see, but not this weekend actually go see him this weekend unless you're an Austin, Texas, because that's where I'm going to be at the cap city comedy club, goddammit.

Speaker 10:         00:57:42       And uh, I'm really, really excited to do this Gig and uh, but a little disappointed. I kind of asked some sad news. Well, let's give you the good news first. The good news is I'll be working with my good friend Joe to Rosa, who I do a uninformed with my XM radio show, our XM radio show, and he'll be opening up for me too, man show and uh, Joe fucking hilarious. Um, it's going to be a great night of comedy this Thursday, Friday and saturday@capcitycomedyclub.com. You can get all the information. Now. The reason I booked myself in Austin this weekend was because the longhorns had a home game and I've always wanted to go to a, I always wanted to go to a game there since way, way the fuck back. I watched the longhorns game and for some reason I like, I think the guy's name was cherry gray or something like that.

Speaker 10:         00:58:36       He's one of their defensive backs and either the late seventies, early eighties, must've been early eighties, because Earl Campbell wasn't playing for him at that point. So anyways, I always wanted to go to a game there. I'm a big time sports geek. And uh, in fact when we were booking the show that the cap city people, we're talking to my agent going, I don't know if he wants to come down here that weekend because there's a longhorn home game and people really go nuts for those games. And uh, we don't want it to affect his numbers. So I was like, well, I want to go to the game so I don't give a fuck. I'll, I'll make less money so I can go to the game. So this is what ends up happening, the longhorns and up, uh, being undefeated, kicking the shit out of people and everybody else starts fucking losing. And next thing you know. Then the number one team in the country, and I swear to God, earlier this year, the fucking game was going to be on in the afternoon and now I believe they call it the flex schedule. They've moved the game time. They pushed it back to 7:00 PM and my show's at 8:00 PM so I don't know what the fuck I'm going to do now. Does that mean nobody's going to come to my show and I don't get to go to the football game?

Speaker 10:         00:59:53       I'm such a fucking, this is why I can't even talk. I'm such as Sports Geek that I'm actually considering. You know what? There's a dog. I'm sitting in my car right now. There's a fucking dog looking out at the window looking right at me. I got the windows up, that son of a bitches behind the window. It's like he can hear everything that I'm saying.

Speaker 11:         01:00:14       Cody. Yes. God, yes.

Speaker 10:         01:00:21       You just fucking staring him. Maybe you know I was using some hacky command. Oh, he left. He left. He left his, then another person come up to the window. Right now. I look like a freak. Okay. The fuck was I talking about? I'm actually such a sports geek and I'm actually considering going there tailgating and watching like literally the first hour of the game because then I'll be on until eight 45 and that, you know what? Fuck that I'm doing it. I'm going to the Goddamn game. If I just see the first fucking quarter, I don't give a shit. God Damn it. That pisses me off the whole fucking weekend screwed up. Now you know, I was driving up, I was going to go up to Houston because I was going to go to south park guitars. It's as they got nothing but lefty guitars out there and I'm Jonesing to buy this, this new reissue gold top Les Paul Because uh, I don't know.

Speaker 10:         01:01:16       I played drums and guitar. I'm done. My life is ridiculous. I'm like a fucking 12 year old. I'm not married. I don't have any kids. I go to sporting events, I played drums and guitars and I babbled for a half hour on Monday and I tell shit jokes on the weekend. It's like sometimes I wake up feeling guilty. How fucking great my life is. It's just, I can't lie to you. It's fucking awesome. I just, this is what fucking level of sports nerd I am. This is just for my podcast listeners up in Canada. I've always wanted to go to cocky games up in Canada and I never, you know, I always want to get booked up there, but you know, my fucking bookers always like, oh, the money isn't good, blah, blah, blah, blah. Blahs is back when the dollar was worth more than my fucking shoe laces, so I'd never get booked up there.

Speaker 10:         01:02:03       So this year, in December, you know, the industry shuts down. I said, you know what? Fuck this. I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna take a hockey trip up to Canada. Three Day weekend. I fly up Friday, Friday night I go to a Calgary game. Then Saturday I drive up to Edmonton. I go to an Edmonton, Vancouver Canucks game in Edmonton. And then a Sunday morning I fly over to Vancouver and I go to a Vancouver Canucks game. That is my fucking weekend. And I know there's a lot of, you know what, and I bet I'm just dividing you guys right now. 50, 50. There was some people right now going, dude, that is the stupidest fucking, most moronic waste of Goddamn money I've ever heard in my life. And then there's other people who either they get it or they'd suffered the same sickness. I don't know how to categorize it. I like, dude, that's the shit.

Speaker 10:         01:03:02       I Dunno. It's ridiculous. And I'm like geeking like I'm fucking site the Gulf. So you guys, we know what, why don't you let me know next week, okay? And don't be on the fence. And I'll be like, you know, I'm not into it, but if you're into it, I want you to go one way or the other. I want you need to say, Bill, that's the greatest shit ever. Defend that. I totally get what you're doing. Or just call me the biggest douche bag ever. And I'll read out all the funniest ones. I'll read next week. There you go. That's your homework assignment for the week. So with that, let's, let's get to some overrated, underrated stuff. Um, all right, overrated. Uh, I got a new job in Everett Washington, so this past week I drove cross country from Worcester, Massachusetts. I don't know if you've ever had the desire when you were a kid in high school to drive across the country, but I can honestly say I didn't really like it and it's hilarious to this guy saying driving across the fucking country is overrated.

Speaker 10:         01:04:00       Anyways. He says driving west is a constant uphill battle. I had no idea. I figured once you were out of the Appalachian mountains that it would be flat. It is flat, but not level. You are constantly driving up no matter what going through the plains states suck too. I was driving through somewhere in Minnesota at night and I slammed into a deer standing in the road. My truck was tall enough that it didn't get too fucked up, but still a wow. That's hilarious. This guy, so you know what? I bet you'll never listen to those American songs the same way you get, like they get annoyed when people sing. God bless America or what is the, what's the one for Purple Mountain's majesty page? He's going to be like, yeah, dude. Yeah, it fucking sucks. So are you from those corporations? If you get it, here's one for you and you can look this up.

Speaker 10:         01:04:57       The same guy I looked up the uh, the microchip commercial, they actually got a machine now that rather than digging into a mountain and they'd take the coal out, they actually, it's as big as a school. They, I don't know how the fuck they get it up there. They get it basically to the top of the mountain and they just filed a mountain all the way down to the ground. I know that sounds crazy saying you're out of your fucking mind. I saw it on 60 minutes. This wasn't one of those youtube or Wikipedia crazy things that I've seen. So sir, with any luck corporations, we'll get rid of all the fucking mountains.

Speaker 10:         01:05:35       Can you imagine if they do that? Can you imagine the fucking hurricanes that were going to have absolutely nothing to twisters? It's just going to be a, I'm telling you, I really think the second half of my life is going to be like a fucking will Smith movie. Except will's not going to show up cause he's just an actor. All right. Underrated. Um, oh I didn't even answer the question. Yeah, I've actually driven cross country. The first time I moved back from La and I decided I wanted to get back into being a comedian because I wasn't ready to be in la and I packed up all my shit and I drove from La to New York City and a three and a half days if that, like three days I drove like a fucking maniac. I drove like 16 hour days at 80 miles an hour, like a fucking maniac.

Speaker 10:         01:06:24       No radar detector, La all the way into New Jersey did not get pulled over. And I forget how I did this. I was trying to go around some traffic. I did a fucked up, you turn and I got pulled over right before the George Washington bridge and I'm thinking, isn't this ironic? Maybe the police officer will share in my seeing this as a comedic, ironic moment and he didn't give a fuck. It was one of those deals where he was Dudley do, right. He was like, whatever you did was so douchey. I'm not even gonna say anything other than license and registration came up to window licensing, registration. Oh, like, you know, this is me as I'm handing the stuff to them. You know, it's amazing. I drove all the way from La and I did and he just snatched it and walked back to his car and I was like, Alrighty then.

Speaker 10:         01:07:11       Yes, I'm getting a ticket. All right. Anyways, let's get to underrate year. Underrated a good mechanics. There are a few shops out there that give a, there are a few shops out there that give the good guys the bad rep of few. No, there's a ton that's like me saying, you know, there's a couple of comedians out there that give comedians a bad name. Now there's a ton of us standing on stage go and what's the deal? Men and women has this crazy, yes. Smell your own farm and to do that, look at this guy over here. He knows what I'm talking about. Um, speaking of which, yeah, you know what a good honest mechanic is underrated and actually found one out here. It's a good fucking guy. Uh, what do we got a couple more? I'm actually speaking of farts. Overrated. Your farts. Underrated. My farts.

Speaker 10:         01:08:04       All right. A little myopic, but I get it. I get it and want to say there was something else for that. Oh, and he had a movie review bill. Whatever you do, don't watch Cloverfield. Jj Abrams should be beaten for this monster shit bomb. You know, I heard that movie sucked. I'm going to steer clear of it. Um, all right. So when he was, let's start wrapping this thing up here. That's the flats. You just spend like the inner goddess Devita is a fucking podcast. Um, I do have to get to a couple of things that people, last week I said Japanese ballplayers are overrated and I want to, I want to retract that statement. Um, I dunno, I just watched a couple of the guys that the Yankees got in dice k for the red sox drives me fucking nuts. And it wasn't until game two, I think was the game to know game one of the devil race series that I, I understood the guy.

Speaker 10:         01:09:03       It's like I get this guy, he went, he loads up the faces and there's nobody out. Then he has the other team right where he wants them. He doesn't give a fuck until the whole thing could go down the shitter. So I actually was able to relax that first game when I watched him pitch. So maybe I was a little bit harsh and I think I was hard, harsh to white guys cause this guy says, your comment about white guys can't play baseball pretty untrue. If I were to field an all white baseball team, uh, that might give any all whatever, all star team a run for their money, you know what, that'd be a great fucking idea. It really would add to a lot of racism. They should have the all Dominican team, first of all, Japanese team, you know, or versus the all white team, whatever.

Speaker 10:         01:09:51       You know what the winner of the all white teams should all white versus the all Japanese team. She played the ultimate and cut team and each team is allowed to have two Puerto Ricans. Um, anyways, CNC, his, his, uh, his is all white team. I'm not reading all these fucking names. Lance Berkman, chase Utley chipper Jones, chipper Jones like 98 years old. You can say next. Uh, who the fuck was that? Ah, Geez. I just went blank. Who the fuck was the guy we used to play center field for the Braves. Keep Thinking Darryl Dale Evans. Dale Evans. Wasn't she fucking Cowgirl Bill Murphy? You're going to go back that far? I'll wait. Josh Hamilton. Okay. That's a good one. Uh, might be seen it right there, right? There's some guys. Yeah. Okay. I mean there's no Manny Ramirez there. You know Josh Hamilton could be all right. You're right. You're right. I was just trying to be funny.

Speaker 10:         01:10:53       If you price going to defend the white man anyways. Okay, let's go. What are we doing here? What does the left anything? Oh, the op Ed piece. Last week some girl did some rant that she can't find a good guy anymore. She's saying that all guys were pussy fide. And is that because of rights and all that type of shit? So here's your rebuttal, man. This guy has some advice for you. For the woman who said, there's no good guys out there. There's no good guys that you can find. They've all pussies. Whereof all the real men gone. Okay. All right, so here, first of all, he starts off with his explanation as to why so many guys are pussies. He says, well, most guys are just trying to get laid seriously. They will do anything. They are varying techniques for this. Some work better than others.

Speaker 10:         01:11:42       Um, first you have the manly men, a men. This girl was talking about, they act like complete fucking assholes. They're abusive emotionally and even physically. Sometimes girls fucking love asshole guys. Not all, but an overwhelming majority of the female population population definitely gravitates towards these fucking Douche bag men and the drama created by they're being assholes. I got to admit, when I started being a Dick, I definitely, uh, did I get more women? I just think I got, I got a higher quality woman as far as looks anyways, but they all ended up being psychos. Um, all right. There's another one. Most women like asshole guys because it provides them with an infinite amount of bullshit to whine about. Okay, I'll be getting some responses to this also. They love the whole, Oh, you don't know him? Like I know him. He's different when we're alone.

Speaker 10:         01:12:39       Shit, that's fucking funny. Uh, it makes them feel special. These guys know this and they get tons of girls is fucking works. I got to admit, being an asshole doesn't work. Not Literally being an Asshole, but if you just act like you don't give a fuck, it gives him something to work at. I can't even explain it. It's basically, I think I did that joke in my, on my special, which is basically in the beginning you actually know what to say, but your brain keeps saying, don't say it because you don't want to offend him. It's when you shut that, that like sensor thing off and you just start saying, you know what I mean? I give them with the girl and you just want to fuck her, but you make the mistake of acting like you like her. So now you've, you're taking her out to dinner and it's like Ben never had to happen because believe it or not, some women you know actually just want to fuck too.

Speaker 10:         01:13:35       So if you kind of thrown out there and all you want to do is fuck a lot of times that takes a lot of that bullshit away. So you stop acting like a nice guy and they stopped backing. Like they don't want to jump on a cock and a, you can have a good time anyway. You know what? I don't even know what the fuck I'm talking about this. I'm sitting in my car with the windows up cause I don't want to wake the neighbors here and it's starting to get hot in here. So, uh, I don't really stand by anything else that I saved the red. Why don't I just read the rest of the shit that this guy wrote without commenting on it? All right. Second is a second group of people. You have sensitive artsy guys. The guys that movies and television have trained to be timid and understanding guys like this, guys like this at first, but after a while becomes thought that girl, sorry girls like the sensitive guys at first, but after awhile it becomes boring and this guy inevitably falls into the friend zone.

Speaker 10:         01:14:31       The guy musters up the courage to tell the girl how he feels and he gets the I really like you but just as a friend shit. Then he goes home and hangs himself. This strategy doesn't work as well as the asshole method. All right. I guess this is a final one. Then there's the guys were above the whole macho, territorial pissing shit and our email pussies either these guys never get laid in high school because they usually don't deal with these fucking stupid girls that are gawking at the asshole upperclassmen with cars and roid rage sky something has got some unresolved high school issues. Um, anyways, they go up to girls but like idiots as themselves, they almost always get passed over for asshole job guys, I dunno, basically wraps it up. So I don't think this girl's looking hard enough. There are macho assholes everywhere.

Speaker 10:         01:15:19       It's the dominant strategy for getting laid that I've noticed if she's looking for an actual relationship and doesn't want to just get boned by tons of insensitive pricks, then maybe she should rethink what she means by saying men are pussies. Well, there you go sweetheart. In your face. What do you think about that? It is going to sit there and not type something. I like both of those things because they all touched on truth and they also were unbelievably generic and you also kind of learned a little bit about both people, you know, and I think they both have some anger towards the other sex, which I think is healthy. You know what? I think I should arrange a meeting where you guys can both get together and hate fuck each other. What are you think about that? He's screaming at you different points I think.

Speaker 10:         01:16:07       I think that would be awesome. It just allow me to videotape it. I'll fucking squiggle out and he sort of private parts and I'll do that black line across your eyes so no one can recognize you. Like on the ACBC dirty deeds, done dirt cheap album, speaking of which, I'm going to see ACBC December 6th at the La Forum. Anybody else? Anybody else? Um, all right, what's that worth at? That is a, you hear that beep. That means my car just started up and that is the end of the Monday morning podcast. Sorry it took so long for me to put it out there. I really try to get them done in the morning cause I know I'm on west coast time and uh, and I really appreciate it. Everybody who listens to these things every week, please keep the questions coming and uh, and that, that isn't everybody. Have a good week as a congratulations to the devil rays.

Speaker 10:         01:16:57       Man. You're up two games to one. You bastard. You got a great fucking team. And uh, I dunno, I kinda like all the teams that I left, I'm actually driving right now, which is illegal out here. I actually, with my lights off on a fucking moron. Okay. There we go. Actually like all the teams that I left, I can't figure out who I want to, who I want to win out in the West. I really liked the Dodgers because they got a bunch of old red sox. No Ma, Manny, uh, Derek Lowe. And I liked Joe Torry. You know, I hated the Yankees, you know, still hate the Yankees, but you know, you got to respect Joe Torry and you've got to admit the Dodgers and making the red sox and the Yankees looking a little stupid, you know, red Sox, obviously getting rid of Manny's, he's too much to deal with and look at the fuck he's doing out there.

Speaker 10:         01:17:48       And then what's the ama pain is fucking salary. Jesus Christ. But then you got, what's his face? Uh, Joe Torry, the Yankees were like, you know what, we're so sick of going to the playoffs for the love of God. We need to take a year off from the playoffs, so we're going to get rid of you. And, uh, what's the name of the Dodgers? Because they haven't been there in while and then the Phillies, I don't know. I, uh, I like the Phillies. I liked that team. I liked the new stadium. And I know everybody talks about that youtube video. I could really give a shit about Philly, like I don't hate them or whatever. But, uh, I dunno. I Dunno. You know what? I think I might want to see the Dodgers.

Speaker 10:         01:18:34       I wouldn't mind if the Dodgers, the Dodgers were playing the Red Sox, then I'll root for the Dodgers. All right. That's it. That's it. So right now my red sox is still in until I got to root for the Phillies. They are thrown down. All right. And not being wishy washy. I'm rooting for the fucking fillies. And uh, obviously the red sox, but I can't get mad at the devil rays. You got to love it. Not spending money. Got All these fucking stuff's coming up. They're kicking the shit out of a pitching. But, uh, oh, and I want to thank everybody who's trashing my patriots right now. You know, you punch your pussies. How we come in, they're limping into your town. Everybody's injured, and now you're going to talk all your shit. You bunch of fags, you know what I mean? I'll tell, you know, my favorite team is for fucking talking shit has to be the San Diego chargers.

Speaker 10:         01:19:21       I've never seen a team celebrate more than they do. You would think that they had actually won a championship rather than they just want a regular fees and game in the middle of October. Those mother fuckers, they gain like they stopped a guy for a four yard gain on first down and they all start line dancing. Remember that a couple of years ago when the Patriots beat him again in the playoffs and they all did Shawne Merriman dance right there on the 50 yard line. Remember that? And then lt got all upset saying that we didn't have any class. I could just made no sense to me. It's like really your guy has been doing that the entire game he's getting in everybody's face. Every time he makes a play, he's doing that stupid, uh, started motorcycle dance that he does live by the sword, die by the sword. You're going to be a con.

Speaker 10:         01:20:14       People going to be a cunt to you. And now, look this week we come limping into town. They kicked the shit out of us to look at lt at the end of the game. He's all smiling. Hey, good game, good game. Slapping everybody on the ass. He's got no problem with all the dancing at his teammates were doing. I'm telling you, I don't like that. I don't like that. You know what I mean? That's uh, that's really annoying. And you know what? I think it starts with the coach. My really talking shit to LTE right now. Like you can't kick the shit out of me or that he even listens to this fucking podcast. Um, I dunno. I was still sticking by it. The Patriots are going to win the AFC east. Go Fuck Yourself. I'm not reading any of the emails to trash me all you want. They're going to win it. All right. That's it. That's it for the podcast. I'm going to go buy some fucking Cheerios, have a good week everybody. And uh,

Speaker 8:          01:21:07       and that's it. Keep the questions coming. I'll talk to you later. Bye. I felt my heart light. I expanded. It was just the shadows. Then a voice spoke in mine. She said, dark is not the APPS.
