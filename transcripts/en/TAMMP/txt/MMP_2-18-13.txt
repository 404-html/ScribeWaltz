Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burr and it's the Monday morning podcast for Monday, February 18th, 2013 and a right off the bat you should be going like, well, this sounds a lot different than all the other ones. Yes it does. Um, there's a reason for that. The reason for it is because the handy recorder, h four n r by zoom, the zoom h four n handy recorder is a fucking diva hunk of shit. Fuck that recorder. And it's nonexistent. Digital ass. I've had more Goddamn fucking problems with this thing. First of all, they give you a fucking memory card. We can record like just over a podcast. So every fucking God damn week I start the podcast. If I forgot your race, the last one, I have a problem. And I know what you guys are thinking. Well Bill, why don't you buy a new fucking memory card while I'm an asshole? Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:01:04       Committedly I'm an asshole. But you know what I did? You know what I did? People get swirl. Fucking Billy red faced went the other day. Well, I went to the wrong place first, but then they told me where to go. And then I went and I bought a fucking memory card, some 60 fucking four gig memory card. I stick it in. This thing's fucking little slot there. Turned it on. It says, do you want to format the card? Why? Yes, I would. Handy fucking recorder of h four n Zoom Douche, right? How child does, she says right now, try not to be mad at an inanimate object as Joe de Rosa says. Um, but I am. So I put it in there and it says error can't do it. And then I go on the internet wasting more fucking time of my life. Oh, you technology douche bags out there. Who just think that this stuff makes your life easier. It doesn't, it doesn't cause it's constantly fucking breaking down. And then I got to go on the Internet and I got to try and figure out what the hell's going on, do you know, shifting through all this, this horse shit. And, uh, I found something and I followed it to the t and it still says it's, it's that there's a problem. So what do I have to do? I'm in New York City right now, by the way, I'm going to have to somehow get in touch with Bobby Kelly and I'm going to flip the fuck out

Speaker 2:          00:02:28       screaming about tech. This is what happens. Is this help Bobby Kelly helps you with technology. I call him up. I immediately go on a rant about technology and the banking system. He sits back and relaxes, you know, probably has the phone like 20 feet from his ear. And when I'm done ranting, you know, he'll just sit there and be like, I did what's a product game? But what do you, what do you have? And I'll make this fucking piece of shit, so fuck if it did do, is that a piece of shit? Dude is actually, I've had that thing is fucking great. I

Speaker 1:          00:03:00       get the new one, it's fucking wireless. Um, and then he talks to me, fucking throw it, you know? And what kills me is I like to think that I'm just as smart as Robert Kelly, but evidently I'm not, he never comes to me for help, but I think that's cause he's, he's afraid. He's afraid of the feelings that he has for me. So anyways, I don't even know how to adjust these levels. I hope I'm not blowing out you fucking ear drums here.

Speaker 3:          00:03:28       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:03:30       Anyways, you know what was funny about all of this once I was going to make fun of this kid who was having problems downloading my special, you know, and this is basically, you know, fortunately I've had a nice steady stream of people downloading my special and I'm, I swear to God for every like 50 75 people that downloaded successfully, there'll be one person that has a problem. I get right back to them. You know, usually that day, if not within two to three days, I get back to them as soon as I can. We get them a new link and they get the special. All right. And I've actually learned a lot about myself reading some of these emails because the amount of people who immediately assume that they're getting fucked let basically that I'm fucking them over. Which you know, like I, I basic, I announced that I have this special to download for $5 and once I get your $5, my game plan is there really is no link.

Speaker 4:          00:04:36       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:36       Like how long can I realistically get away with that? Maybe for a week before all you guys talk to each other, just like there's no link. He's just stealing $5 from us. At which point I would become the biggest douche on the Internet and no one would come to my shows and I would go back to sleeping on a futon. So why would I do that? But what cracks me up is I understand the anger as you can tell. I'm sure there's somebody out there who has a zoom h four n handy recorder and knows exactly, you know what to fucking buttons to hit. And my whole world would be perfect.

Speaker 3:          00:05:13       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:05:14       I have to tell you, it is an unbelievably confusing fucking device. This is definitely, this has to be some pro level shit cause they did not dumb it down for someone like myself. So anyways, getting back to the, um, getting back to the, uh, the downloads. Okay. If you are having problems, okay, the link does work. Okay. Admittedly, a couple times there has been a glitch on our end and we go out, we fix it immediately. You will get a link. I'm not trying to fuck you over if you for, if you are just like, well it didn't work the first time and I don't feel like waiting. I want my $5 back. I will, I will absolutely refund your money. You're not going to get fucked. Okay. You're not going to get fucked out of your money. You, they're going to get the special. Are you going to get your $5 back? So,

Speaker 3:          00:06:01       mmm.

Speaker 1:          00:06:04       I Dunno. But I've actually learned a lot about myself watching people having meltdowns about these things. This one kid wrote me today, he goes, I would like my money back from my purchase of your special on January 25th, 2013. I never had a chance to see this special and I am deeply outraged by the horrible quality of your customer service. Please return my $5 to my checking account. Immediately sound like Jesus Christ did I miss this guy. So I look up his email. It's fucking hilarious. I've already talked to the guy three times. He got the initial link and we sent them to more links and he hasn't been able to download it. Okay. I got back to him every time, either that day or within 24 hours and now he asked for his $5 back and I gave it back to him within like 45 minutes to him asking for, all right, I understand you're upset or dude, but how was that horrible customer service?

Speaker 1:          00:07:00       Now if you want to say it's a horrible link, you know, that's one thing. My customer service, I'm going to pat myself on the backyard. I think it's pretty fucking good. I wouldn't say it's outstanding. All right. I'm not trying to get trashed by other consumers are going to send me emails, but I'm just saying all right. Sometimes it does take me like three days to get back to you. But you know, I've running a mom and pop operation here. I got to fly to fucking uh, east bumped fucks to do is show, you know, that day, maybe I'm not looking at my emails, but I will get back to all right? And then a whole, there's been thousands of people, thank God who downloaded my special successfully. So the link is fine. All right. I sent the guy let it back. I told him, I said, till we got back to you every time you emailed us and I just gave you $5 back. How was that horrible customer service? I don't know what to tell you. What more am I supposed to do? Fly to where you live and stare at your computer with your, God knows I can't figure it out. This guys deeply outraged over $5. Thank God my special wasn't 20 bucks. Like I wasn't selling like a hard copy of it. This guy probably hunt me down and shoot me.

Speaker 1:          00:08:09       Oh, speaking of shooting people, how about that fucking Cyborg allegedly shot his woman through the fucking bathroom door.

Speaker 1:          00:08:21       Jesus Christ. Huh? What a fucking creepy story that is. You know, it's funny, as I was sitting here today flipping out about the zoom h four, this is like the anti commercial for this thing, h four and recorder, if you're stupid, please do not buy this thing because you'll end up like me. And I'm really trying to, uh, it's rosy used to have this joke about him flipping out at a laptop and somebody saw him and said, hey, that's an inanimate object. You're better than that. But Bob, blah, blah blah. So I, I, for some last night I was flipping about stepping out about how my internet sucks in New York and how, because I was so mad at the Internet connection, I actually had the urge to grab my laptop, a completely innocent bystander and just fucking like sort of like a combination of a Frisbee in a disgust and I wanted to throw it through my window

Speaker 4:          00:09:19       rather than using my brain and sitting down, um, or maybe, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:09:26       just solving the problem. Maybe just calling up and canceling the wireless service and getting that little fucking, uh, what do you call it? The Internet stokey that you can stick into the side of your computer. So you have internet everywhere. That Bobby Kelly shit dead like an internet everywhere. I stick the stick in. I put on my little ear piece, dude, it's all fucking wireless. It orders me a sandwich.

Speaker 4:          00:09:52       Yeah. Um, anyways,

Speaker 1:          00:09:58       the fuck was I talking about, you know that guy actually I, I made, I made a bad move the other day. I asked, I called Bobby Kelly up and I told them I needed a new printer and you kick someone like me cannot talk to a guy like on Bobby Kelly's level of technology. Okay. Because all of my shit is from like, you know, three presidents ago. All right. I don't like technology. Um, as far as I don't like new technology. Okay. I would be happy. I was happy with, my life was in the 80s and I didn't have a laptop or cell phone. I was fine. I don't know about you guys, but I was eating three times a day. I had a roof over my head,

Speaker 4:          00:10:42       you know, I had a carburetor,

Speaker 1:          00:10:46       I had no fuel injection and I was fine. My car couldn't talk to me. I didn't have any GPS Cya. Oh, I had a map. It's not like an old man here, but my life was fine when I say I don't like technologies for all the Douche bags already firing up your email. Really would you like to go back to the caveman days? You know what I'm saying? Past a certain point, the shit hasn't been helping me.

Speaker 4:          00:11:12       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:14       Right up to cure polio and penicillin right there. We should have, we should just walked away from the Black Jack Table. We should have left it at that, you know, and then all we would have had to have done is just dealt with the population problem in that you just keep it in check. Okay. You get one of these mathematical fucking nerds, God bless him. And we just have a number of that. We will not go beyond. Okay. And, and you know, in a, in an imperfect world, um, everybody could join hands and we would all work together and there would be no countries, but that's not the way it is because the sociopath hungry sociopaths and fucking religious psychopaths.

Speaker 4:          00:12:00       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:12:00       Okay. If you could eliminate those two people, those two groups of people, you know, people who take the Hocus pocus shit too seriously and then those, those fucking,

Speaker 4:          00:12:13       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:12:14       those, those people who will do anything. We'll fucking do anything. You know, the only feeling they feel as the Russia of putting their foot on somebody's neck. If you could just get rid of those two people. I was kid who we'd look at us, look at us on the Internet. There's a wave of trash. Each other probably still wouldn't work, but whatever. This is my utopia. I think we should have tapped out somewhere around like, um, I dunno, when did the first Atari come out? You've got to have video games, right? Asteroids with spray and you guys, whatever, you get bored with it. But yeah, they'd come up with a new asteroids maybe that maybe the, the, the ship would be shaped like a square.

Speaker 1:          00:12:57       Maybe the rocks were like hexagon. No rocks where hexagons. Well you just make the space spaceship, the shape of the asteroids and then the asteroids, the shape of the space ship, new spaceship shaped asteroids and we all, we all would have been excited cause we didn't know any better because we didn't know there was a bad, a battlefield earth part for whatever the fuck it's called. Have you video guys are doing there? I don't even want to say it's one even so Bobby tells me to get this fucking, I call up Bobby Kelly who Bobby is like, you know when I go to Bob's pops apartment or whatever, it's like walking in my world. It's like walking like nine years into the future. You don't remember when it Yankee Stadium first came out and they were all arrogant going, we have 2013 technology in 2009 and when they said that shit, which really was the dumbest thing ever, it's like no. If you had, you have 2009 technology that is not going to be available to a nerd like me. Not a nerd, a loser like me until 2013 you're really just sort of rubbing it in my face.

Speaker 4:          00:14:03       All right.

Speaker 1:          00:14:05       Of course I'll Yankee fans safe, but oh, they got tech doll with chief problem of future Derek Jeter,

Speaker 4:          00:14:15       right?

Speaker 1:          00:14:20       Oh, it's your fucking Yankee Jersey that you can't button anymore.

Speaker 4:          00:14:25       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:14:27       Anyways, what am I talking about here? Oh, so Bobby, Bobby's like nine years in the future compared to me. So he gets me this. I get this fucking thing right?

Speaker 5:          00:14:35       Fucking wireless did everything. Bobby has has to be wireless, you know, it's fucking where they stayed. I think I can drive in a cat, dude. And I just think of something. It's, it's wired into my brain. A little heavy. It prints it out, dude. Um, so I get this thing, of course, this fucking goddamn thing. I've probably used it 20 times, 17 times. I've had a fucking problem with it. One time for no reason. I would, I would hit print and it would go through the entire stack of paper that I had printing, nothing, just printing hell high. He had whole hat, he had whole hat and I'm going, what the fuck's going on? [inaudible] he had. Right. And then finally the last two pages, it would just print a bunch of code. And you know, I don't give a fuck. Just at some point in that five minute exercise, fucking print when I've tried to print, never does it. So then I got called Bobby up. Bob, this fucking predecessor did. It doesn't set date. What's, just tell me what, go into properties or whatever. Click on the apple gate.

Speaker 6:          00:15:52       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:15:53       And I'm on the phone for like 45 minutes. I liked my old printer.

Speaker 5:          00:16:00       It had a wire, it was tethered to reality and I plugged it into my fucking laptop. You know, I like that real shit. And I'm like, it's in the air, man. I don't know what's going on. I can't figure that shit out. So anyways, I don't know what the fuck are we even talking about here? I wonder what am I really saying? Why can't it stuff be easy? Why can't stuff, what I really want is for nothing to change so I don't have to learn anything new. I think that's what I'm really trying to say here. MMM.

Speaker 5:          00:16:32       I don't know. I'm going to talk about New York City here in second. Yeah. Once I, uh, let's do a couple of advertisements really quickly. I can get Jesus.

Speaker 5:          00:18:24       And I came in in New York and uh, you know, I actually really fucking enjoy cold weather. And, um, the only thing that sucks was it snowed like five days ago. So when it first snows, it's, it's beautiful. It's like a newborn baby. Just gorgeous. Everywhere you go, looks like a postcard, but you know, three, four days later it's just a, you know, you think you're, you're an eastern fucking Europe and that's what it looks like right now. Uh, it's kind of a nice sunny day, but I gotta be honest with you. Um, if you're past the age of 40 and you're still dealing with winters, I just want you to know that there are options. You know what? No, no. You know what, keep, keep living in the last thing when he was more fucking people. Ellen, it's great. You know, you get the four seasons, you know, one and a half of them are nice.

Speaker 5:          00:19:18       I like it. You know what I like to change of seasons. Do you have any idea what it's like to just fucking just wake up every day and the weather is awesome. It's awesome. And I know what he's [inaudible], dude, you've got to lose your edge. That's how fucked up east coast people are. We're afraid that we're going to lose our anger. Hey, you're going to lose your edge. He ate. But be careful. You might end up being happy. You might end up, uh, you know, enjoying your life. Go easy. Now. I mean, when I first moved out to la the first time I was out there when I hated it and this didn't seem right and I fought it so hard to not to try and not enjoy it, but I did. I played a roller hockey on the day of the Superbowl in shorts and a tee shirt in this parking garage. It's the 90s. Okay, let's go fuck yourself. And it was roller hockey. I wasn't skating down the boardwalk in a fanny pack, but, uh, if footage of me doing that does surface, I would love to say that it was somehow Photoshop for the record. I never had a fanny pack, but not because, um, I didn't like him. I just found I just,

Speaker 6:          00:20:40       okay.

Speaker 5:          00:20:41       I wanted pockets. I just, I don't like shit on me, you know what I mean? I just, I don't like it. Then it makes you a waste sweaty that wherever the fanny is fanny pack a pack is on the fanny pack that's going to get all sweaty. I don't fucking like, you know, I used to put the money in my sock and then my keys and my other songs. I used to be that guy, you know. Anyways, so I'm playing roller hockey at the top of his fucking uh, uh, parking garage. The houses, me, Dane Cook, Rick Dolly and Pete coming right for two, one, two fucking psycho gay. We had where it was like zero to zero and we were all such competitive maniacs. This is back before Tiva. We almost missed the beginning of the Superbowl because we had to play until somebody one or maybe it was one to one.

Speaker 5:          00:21:36       You know, when you don't have that official clock or anything, it was foods, the fucking shit. And we will laugh and just go like, my buddy was going, who loved La. I was like, dude, we're gonna watch the Superbowl. How nuts is this? Everybody back east is freezing their fucking balls off route here in the sun. Play roller hockey on top of this parking structure, hoping the security doesn't come up here. And I was buying into that whole, um, and losing my edge. Man, I'm not going to be funny, but meanwhile la is one of the most difficult cities I've ever had to live in just as far as getting from point a to point B and also trying to keep you your head screwed on because um, it's a fun place when you're working. That's all I can tell you when you're not working.

Speaker 5:          00:22:20       Uh, and if you are out there right now and you're struggling, I definitely don't be afraid to have a hobby. Don't be afraid to have something that you can actually fucking look forward to that will actually help you. You know, some of these psychos out there that 24, seven, I gotta be about the business. Hey, you want to a, hey, here's a free cupcake. Would you like a cupcake? And I am like, can I expect him? You got to get the skip them. Who turns down a free cupcake has kind of greed when man to another man. Huh? Um, anyway, so I'm back here in New York and uh, I dunno, it's weird. I love New York, but I just don't miss it. I always thought I would miss it, but I don't miss it. I woke up a fucking, God knows what time this morning, a holiday, backyard area.

Speaker 5:          00:23:06       It is president's Day of some shit and some assholes. It's got his fucking stereo on like two floors down. One of those Douche bags. Um, status is probably, music is my life. Music is the air. I believe. Something trite that they're trying to make original and whatever the fuck it is. Um, life equals music is fucking play in his God. Damn. I'm going to say stereo because I don't know what the kids call into explaining his fucking stereo from two floors down. I'm hearing this guy the baseline of his ship and you know, I just, I just don't miss it.

Speaker 5:          00:23:46       This is basically, I live in a big house with like, you know, 700 strangers. I got a smelly a food. I got to hear their arguments. You know, you always got some sorta is always somebody you know, some old person who's been living there since like the fucking sixties who's paid $3 a month in rent and you walk by their fucking place. Everybody's making some sort of Goulash and the combination of that and the fucking heater that they can adjust for some reason and it's 9,000 degrees. He combination of that and smelling that Goulash and had douche play his stereo. I just, I don't fucking miss it. Then I got to walk out, look at dirty snow. I've had it. I was like, Oh yeah, I remember this. And then there's that when it's getting spring in New York was beautiful. Fall in New York is great summers. Cool for about two seconds before the humidity comes in. All the fucking crooked, rich [inaudible] slash. Celebrities, they all go out to the Hamptons to go fucking air off their balls and we got to sit here taking the goddamned subway and all office. It's the worst, the fucking worst. So, um, uh, I think I'm just grumpy. I still liked New York, but it was kind of disturbing how much I'm sitting here going like, hey, this is a, this is really no way to live.

Speaker 5:          00:25:03       You know, I said this before in New York. It's for young people, you know, up to about 35, 36. You can have a great fucking time. Those last four years is just sliding into 40. Don't fight that feeling that says, hey, why don't we get out of here and live like a human being, you know, fuck the two, one, two area code. You can visit it, drop in and visit it. Go out to jersey, go to upstate New York, whatever the fuck in Westchester. It yourself, a house and a driveway. All right. The only time you smelled Goulash, if yours is, if you're making it, you're human being deserve to live like one, uh, anyways, plowing ahead here. Uh, on the podcast, where am I up to here? This is oddly cruising right along, but I can't find the numbers for 25 minutes. Was it wrong? Um, I had a great week this week, this past week.

Speaker 5:          00:25:57       I've got to do the Conan O'brien show. We'll have the link for that up on, uh, up on a Monday morning podcast page. Um, Conan's great. You know, when you get going, he chimes in and once you get going and just let you go. He's totally old school and if he thinks you're funny, he laughs. It's a, it really is that old school Johnny Carson style. And uh, I'm getting more and more comfortable doing those panel things and I get a real kick out of doing it because that was sort of, that was, that's sort of a lost art amongst comedians just for the simple fact that we haven't gotten the opportunities to do it. Where back in the day, I guess there was less opportunities. Maybe it balances out the fact of the day. Johnny Carson, you know, he had his go to, he would have comics on and they, they weren't promoting anything. He would just have them on because they were, they were a great guest. They come on and he knew that they were going to hit a home run.

Speaker 7:          00:26:57       MMM.

Speaker 5:          00:26:59       And I used to grow up watching these guys, David Brenner, George Gobel, um, all these guys. And I would, I would be psyched when they were on and they'd come on Buddy Hackett, they just come on and tell stories. They weren't promoting anything. They were just hilarious. And he'd watched Johnny laughing his ass off and it went right through Letterman. Leno, uh, are some of the other guys I saw. But then, I dunno, once this talk show stuff became so well back then, he was the only game in town. So there wasn't, it's not the way it is now where there's like 20 shows. I'll try and get this tape a piece of the same pie. But anyways,

Speaker 7:          00:27:39       uh,

Speaker 5:          00:27:41       there was something, I always wanted him to get good at it. So I was really sucked at my, it went well, uh, this past Monday. It's just something that I, I want to get better at. And, uh, I just, I dunno, it was just like the cool thing that for awhile comics just really weren't getting that opportunity or not enough of them. We're getting that opportunity and it was frustrating. I'm not saying it's all actors and all guests, but to sit there at home and watch people coming out, we put and tell the fucking story. But they had a giant movie, which I understand they got to promote the giant movie. I Dunno. I just would always look at that and be like, you know, it would be great right now. Now that that person Kinda did only okay. And the hosts had to work their ass off to help them through the segment. If you just had a comment, come on, tell some stories, and the host could take a little fucking breather. Uh, it's just great. I Dunno. It's just great that Conan is doing that type of thing.

Speaker 7:          00:28:43       MMM.

Speaker 5:          00:28:45       And you know, it was funny. As a comic you always like, man, I want to do those things, those five minutes sets. It's like playing Russian roulette. I'd rather just go out and you just to watch somebody do panel and you think it's fucking easy and then all of a sudden you had have to do panel and you're like, oh my God, what if I'm sitting there bombing? Uh, I had a nice panic attack before it went out there right before when I was standing behind the curtain. I was just like that, why am I here? I have nothing to talk about. Blah Blah Blah. But uh, fortunately it worked out. I did that. And then I have an episode of that show, the new girl coming up, I'll let you guys know. I finally decided I'm actually going to tell you what I'm doing as opposed to keep, I think I've worn out that a bleed joke at this point.

Speaker 5:          00:29:28       And I actually got to work with Nick Kroll, who I tell you, that guy was one of the silliest, funniest motherfuckers I ever worked with. The whole cast was awesome. And, but nit for all that dude is out of his fucking mind. And uh, I don't think I've laughed that hard. You know, it's a one camera shoot. So you're doing like 12 hour days and it's like, uh, you like a Zombie. You know? I actually still like doing those things. I started to understand why my dog sleeps all day, you know? And it's basically because he has nothing to fucking do. She has nothing to do. And if you have nothing to do with your brain's just like okay, we don't have to think we're just going to shut this down and you fall asleep. And that's what was happening to me. I was nodding off. Cause like when you're shooting it, it's the most exciting fucking thing ever.

Speaker 5:          00:30:19       And you feel like you could run a marathon then I would turn it around or you're not in this next one, you just sit down, there's nothing to do. Everything else is being handled and you're just sitting there waiting for that to tell you where to stand to say the stuff that they wrote. Right. And in that time you just fucking not off like a fucking dog. Um, but anyways, I'm telling you man, check out the Kroll show. I got to hear and what I really want to hide this show because I, I think this guys, I think he's absolutely fucking brilliant. Um, come on. I'm the worst. I think it's on Wednesdays. What happened? Oh, I know what happened. I had it up there and then my fucking piece of shit reported in work or another reality that recorded that works. But I can't figure out how it works on a separate row show you go call me central.com. Nick Kroll show is new episodes Wednesday at 10 39 30 central on, uh, on a comedy central. He's absolutely fucking hilarious. Uh, and I really hope that show continues to be a hit. Anyways. All right, there's the, there's the hype to the week. Let's get back to the podcast.

Speaker 5:          00:31:45       Hell that I want to talk about. Oh, that meteor. I'll fuck you. Do you guys see some of the footage? People got that thing just appearing out of the sky. Now there's somebody, somebody's going to give me shit about technology. There were back in the day, you had no idea it was even coming and you would just out there a little fucked up a date, but the, but dab that through doing whatever the fuck he did back then. Right. And all of a sudden this thing just comes out of the sky. I mean, honestly, if that thing falls into your house, she had dead. But I was amazed at the amount of people, right. Who are out driving around. Um, I was driving around, I would've looked like ray Liotta in the second half of good fellas when he's all coked up looking for that helicopter. That would have been me trying to get my ass to a shelter. Uh, is it, is it agreed upon at this point that that's how the dinosaurs died off? Was that a giant media or is that still just a theory? Even though they probably found the crater and proved it, but the fucking old, the AVH people refuse to believe it because somehow that fucks with the Adam and Eve story. How exactly has the church worked in dinosaurs and all that.

Speaker 5:          00:33:00       Adam and eve, they were together and they were living in a paradise and uh, they started the human race. Forget about the incestuous consequences of that math. We'll just say it was those two and they were both white yet somehow they was all these different races of people. Uh, I don't even know if that even makes sense. How do different races and people come about? You know what's funny that's like, that's a great question to ask when you're in a bar with someone with no scientific or is it genetics? Is that the word? Maybe it just ask someone as dumb as me. People are like, Oh, you know, uh, it's just shit. I heard in bars like when I was growing up that like people in Africa were, uh, or Africans, I guess, if that's an easier way to say it. I went, people in Africa instead of say Africans the same way. Everybody who plays basketball now says the game of basketball rather than just saying basketball,

Speaker 5:          00:33:59       you know what, I'm out there playing the game of basketball. You know, we started that Michael Jordan. Somebody said it to him and he liked it as far as I can tell them as far as my, by watching ESPN and the NBA on Chibe Ash, I think he was the first guy. He's the guy who made it cool to say that the game of basketball and these guys all grow up watching Michael Jordan and they keep saying, hearing him say the game of basketball. Now all these motherfuckers, they keep saying the game of basketball. It's like this Yoda ship. You know? I mean I, I really don't, I can't really do a reference to Yoda cause I don't see that movie a couple of times. But I've seen a zillion comic Stewart where you put the shift that usually comes last first. You know, I don't fucking know, but I'm really sick of hearing people talk about the game of basketball.

Speaker 5:          00:34:46       But I am loving Lebron James saying that he has the ability to become the best ever. You know, I am loving that he's saying that it's just great to hear a guy who's going to try and go for that type of thing. And just the fact that he kind of used to get a little tight at the end of the game. He's got, he's all the broadsoft grown up, you know? And plus, because I hate Laker fans and I hate Coby Bryant. I don't hate him personally, but you know, I just hate all the Oh, by the way, how's that whole Magic Bryant Shit work it out for you. Huh? It's he still passing the ball. How many times you, you fucking Laker fans going to fall for that shit. He's turned over a new leaf. He's actually going to work with the rest of the teeth.

Speaker 5:          00:35:27       You know, you guys keep coming back like a battered fucking wife though. Maybe it won't hit me this time. What? Quack? Uh, anyways, there's nothing more a Celtic fans enjoys more than watching Colby try and go for 60 points. Keeps you from Colby. Three guys on you. You got it. Turn around jumper, take it, get your 40 to get your 42 points. Colby all day, all day. Um, anyways, fuck. Am I going here? Uh, sh now getting all fucking freaked out about this stupid thing. Did I put that I put the wrong car then and then I messed up that I, if you put the wrong party and the thing does that, does that mess up the uh, the brain on the thing? Is that too technical a question? Hey, you know, it's funny, I sent out a tweet for, uh, this guy and I was really only for guitar players only, but, um, just how, I don't know the names of Shit.

Speaker 5:          00:36:36       This guy is going off on people who don't know the different names of good, good people, but what do you have a maple neck or a rosewood neck? Hey, the guy's going to be dumb motherfucker. It, everybody's got a maple neck. Oh, both these next or maple. The fretboard fret board is Rosewood. You've got to Rosewood Fret board, not a neck. You dumb mother fucker. And he's just sitting here going off and he ends with the greatest. He goes, you know, half the people, if you just played, you could tar half as much as you bitch. You might be worth a fuck on the guitar.

Speaker 5:          00:37:14       I Dunno. It's tremendous. So anyways, you probably like go. Hey Bill, what are you doing? What are you doing back in, uh, in, uh, New York City. I am a, I am back here. I'm doing a couple of benefits tonight. I'm at bananas in Hasbrouck Heights, uh, doing a benefit for a buddy of mine's wife, uh, who's sick right now, but he's turning the corner and then Tuesday night we're going to have the, uh, the big Patrice O'Neil benefit slash sendoff. We're finally going to send them off, right man. Like if this thing has been a long time coming, it's going to be an insane night. And uh, I'm really psyched to see all the guys who are going to be there and uh, it's definitely a good thing. And a, there you go. That's why I'm here. And then I'm going to go up to Boston on Wednesday, going up to the Wilbur, my big, uh, of course the Bruins are out of town.

Speaker 5:          00:38:10       They weren't in town. I've been watching fucking show, but um, all right. Is it me or is it the podcast kind of fucking went downhill, hasn't it? It's Kinda, it's Kinda dipped a little, let's, let's get this back to get this back on track. So fucking Versie knows. And I'm going to be in Hasbrouck heights than nights. So you know what he tells me he wants to go to white castle. All right? You get a bunch of little white castle burgers in a vanilla shake. It goes, it's going to be epic. And I'm not going to lie to you, I'm not gonna to say that that is a great, but the fact that verse, He makes fun of New Jersey, you know, and this and this, you know, going to white castle and getting a vanilla shake is his idea of a great night out. I mean, Paul Versey, he's so jersey, his last name rhymes with it.

Speaker 7:          00:39:01       You know,

Speaker 5:          00:39:03       he's talking about going to this place, like it's going to be a steakhouse. And this is the thing, I'm white trash too because I'm beyond excited to, I want to fire down as many of those burgers is quickly as I can. And the key is you got to eat them really fast before your body ruins the fun telling you to please stop doing it. So if you're coming out to bananas, Hasbrouck Heights tonight, and about eight, nine minutes into my set, despite the fact I'm leading on the mic stand, but I'm inexplicably sweating, it's not because I'm nervous, it's going to be my body. Trying to is beginning to eliminate the 9,000 calories of a trans fats. I just put my body, you know, every once in a while you get, you've got to keep your body honest. You know, I'm starting off great today. I had a banana for breakfast.

Speaker 5:          00:39:53       I'm going to have an apple as a snack and amount of a giant fucking salad, old twinkle toes here, um, for lunch. And then I'm throwing down. That's how I do it. That's my balanced diet. All right? I eat like I teach yoga for the first half of the day, and John Wayne from five o'clock on, hey, it's better than what I used to do. I used to start off, you know, bacon and eggs and all that type of stuff. Uh, I know there's gonna be some people out there going, hey, you know, there's nothing wrong with bacon and eggs. I'm not saying there is all right, but you know, listen for all you guys out there who eat red meat and you want to say how you know all the, the, the good things about it and everything, but I'm right there with you. I love eating a fucking steak, okay? I drive by a pasture and I have all I can do to not get out of the car and start nine on some cow's neck. All right? Fucking disgusting. But it's true.

Speaker 7:          00:40:52       But look,

Speaker 5:          00:40:54       fuck all these diet books. Go out and eat a giant goddamn salad. Don't drown in addressing. All right? Go with the Balsamic vinegarette do that three days in a row and you watch how well your body operates, okay?

Speaker 5:          00:41:11       You will be a finely tuned machine and you can continue with your fucking chops and all that crap. Just eating one giant leafy Greens. Valid a day. I'm telling you talent. And not only that, it kind of, you know, quells that sugar salt fucking arm wrestle thing that you're doing the whole day. It's really been helping me out and I don't have to work out as much and I think that that's uh, that's really the game plan, isn't it? Don't you want to be in shape and not really have to work out? Right. Did I just become some sort of a, I should have a headset on right now and like doing that, that little warmup side decide to step that they do. Okay. Everybody, thanks for coming out here.

Go fucked up world uncle bill for Elica you guys every week people, you guys are coming up with new different ways to say my name. Billion. Belford it'll be red face. They'll be fat face dilly bag of donuts.

Speaker 5:          00:43:45       Anyways, why don't we all, when are we all going to vote? A Joe Schmoe in as president. Just any other guy than someone who's got this is like classic ballroom talk. Just any other, any guy other than someone who's got a payback, some corporation of bank that got them there in the first place. I understand you usually tackle relationship advice in a way this pertains to our relationship with this, with our country. No Dude, I would love to, I would love to answer conspiracy theory shit. The only reason why I, you know, what it is, is people listen every week and they start, I should start throwing out more topics through conspiracy theory. I'll always do the relationship stuff. You want to talk sports, anything you want to talk about. Um, I will answer the questions and all you guys have to realize is I am not a fucking expert and I do not know what I'm talking about.

Speaker 5:          00:44:34       All I'm trying to do is make you laugh and make you drive to work a little shorter. That's all I'm doing here. All right. Anyways, he says, in a way, this pertains to our relationship with our country. Every day we hear our bags and governments getting away with crazy shit. It's exhausting. I want to shut down, ignore and ignore it all, but that's what they want. Am I stopped and I am a stubborn cunt, so fuck them. What do we do? Thanks. Frustrated the son of a bitch. Um, all right. When are we going? When are we going to vote a Joe Schmo in for president? That's never going to happen. It's impossible to do. We would all have to get organized and the organ to organization to be able to do that. Um, they would figure out that we were doing it and then they would figure out who was leading it and then that person would, um, somehow get shot by a lone gunman alone, crazed gunman, acer hand, Sir hand and Eddie, Eddie, you know, somebody with a crazy fucking name, you know.

Speaker 5:          00:45:35       Um, and let's just say for the, for the sake of argument that we actually all got together secretively and nobody found out and we actually voted a Joe Schmo and for president, uh, nobody would work with them. No one would work with them. And He, and it would be in every politician's best interest to have that guy have the worst presidency ever. So they could all look at the American people and be like, see what happens with the adult vote Democrat or Republican? They would just do that. I mean, they don't even work with each other. If a republican gets in as president and the house, Ooh, I'm getting in over my head house, is that what it's called? If that's democratic, they won't work with that guy. They spend every waking moment trying to fuck over whatever that guy's trying to do. It's childish and vice versa if I see versus are there. So they don't even work with each other. Forget about some Joe Schmo coming in as president. Um, I would say what you have to do is a ground up thing. I would try to vote for the most honest person you could as a local town. Selectman is a regional, one of the, then they have like sort of regional senators and then state senators and then like senators at a federal level. I don't think, I honestly don't think that there is a way.

Speaker 7:          00:46:58       Uh,

Speaker 5:          00:47:00       you know what it'd be like. It's like you have a leaky faucet. It all you're trying to do is buy more paper towels and keep wiping up the water and you're never dealing with the leaky faucet. Okay. This shit is, it's how do I, how do I, how do I put this in my own moronic way?

Speaker 7:          00:47:20       All right.

Speaker 5:          00:47:22       I've done a lot of people's shows, you know, little acting thing here or a fucking podcast here, a big time shows at this point. I've done that stuff and this is what I've found. If the person at the top is a good shit, everybody, everybody's a good shit. Everybody's a good, you know, if the person at the top is not an egomaniac and not acting like an asshole, a fucking diva, everybody falls in line because you can't act like an asshole. It's like, well, this guy is making more money than all of us and he's, he's treating people well. You know, if I start acting like a dick, then it's just going to expose me as being a dick. All right? But if the person at the top is a cunt, it, you know, and it's just been an unbelievable pain in the ass. You know, it's that leadership thing. It just rolls downhill and everybody acts that way. The problem

Speaker 3:          00:48:15       okay

Speaker 2:          00:48:16       with the world is it's a fuck or be fucked system that we have.

Speaker 3:          00:48:23       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:48:24       All right. And it's like it starts at the top with the fuck over and they pass that on to the next level and it's hot potato. You're trying to pass the fuck over

Speaker 3:          00:48:35       on,

Speaker 2:          00:48:37       you know what I mean? And once you get in the game, you end up just doing shit. You don't even want to do. You just have to do it because that's how the game is played. It's the whole bringing a knife to a gunfight. You can't do it. It's a gun fight. You got to get a gun. And I don't know how, I don't, I honestly don't think the only way to change it is for basically one of these asteroids has to hit the earth and we have to be wiped out like the fucking dinosaurs and it has to start over again. You know, because we are flawed. That's all I can say. Yeah, we're flawed just in general. Even if you, even if you weren't able to eliminate sociopath, just in general, we're jealous or envious where conty and, uh, and we do not handle power, wealth, generally speaking, fizzy, occasional fucking Gandhi.

Speaker 3:          00:49:35       Um, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:49:36       Ralph Nader, a Jimmy Carter. Now, of course I got named somebody on the rights of people don't get all comfy. There's like this just,

Speaker 3:          00:49:44       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:49:45       I don't, I don't know enough fucking people. I'm just saying it's very rare. Okay. And you know what the fuck is my phone? What the hell is it? I hear it positive. Can you hear it? Is it on the floor? Where is it? Am I going to get mad at this thing? Oh, there it is right there. Right in front of me. Oh, that's Versie. Or is he, he's probably be fucking mouth already watering.

Speaker 3:          00:50:10       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:50:12       Yeah. So you said, well, what do you, what do you do about it? I would, uh, I don't know. I would just listen to people. If they sound honest, I would vote for them. That's basically all you can do, short of starting of revolution, at which point you're going to have to, uh, you know, be it the, the,

Speaker 6:          00:50:31       yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:50:32       I don't know if the forefront of, uh, a lot of murder or, you know, you can just, you know, find love and get it to get yourself a dog, Eh, uh, you know, tell some jokes. I Dunno. I, I didn't look, I try not to think about it. It's, it's, um,

Speaker 2:          00:50:56       know the way I look at it now is just like good. Yeah. When I see shit that's, I mean, this is, this is, this is how I deal with the depression of it is I just say, oh good. When I see us doing something fucked up. Good. Oh, that's great. You know, there we go. That will hasten our demise and maybe we can, uh, maybe something else will come along. You don't, it was the dinosaurs were just, I dunno, I'm not going to say they would dump, but they were kind of just taking up space and then when we came along, you know, the astroid I, you asteroid comes into web is running shit, whatever you believe is like, all right, let's start over again. And it was just like an overcorrection much in the way, like feminism was an overcorrection. No, it wasn't. Feminism wasn't another correction. What it really was was a bunch of pussy guys who didn't, who never said, I'll write a write that needed to be said somewhere in the last 20 years. They should have been a giant. All right.

Speaker 6:          00:51:57       You know,

Speaker 2:          00:51:59       and I'll tell you right now, believe it or not, that's what every God damn brought out their needs, especially the good looking ones. All right? And if you are an honest woman, you know what I'm saying?

Speaker 6:          00:52:13       You need

Speaker 2:          00:52:15       a man in your life or if you gay, you need a woman in your life to be like, oh right. Oh right enough. Which is what we're fucking in. Guys are the same way. We like these big fucking kids and if we don't, the same way, if you have a kid, and I can speak for this because I've never had one,

Speaker 2:          00:52:41       do you have a fucking kid and the kid has no boundaries. It's going to be bouncing off the fucking walls, acting like an asshole. And guys like me are going to be looking at a kid and actually having the intrusive thought of what if I just gave that toddler an upper cut. You know, like that's how bad the kids behave. Like adults are the same way if we don't have any boundaries. That's why so many of these fucking, these rich cons, they got all the money in the world to get everything they need and they still fucked their lives. I hope it's because, because they did. Nobody can keep them in check. It's kind of like when Russia fell, when Russia fell, that was one of the worst things that ever happened in this country. Russia kept us in check in that, you know, we were sitting at grappling, you know, we moved three feet that way. They push us back four feet, then we'd move five feet. We just doing that shit. Then once they fell down and it was that wide open space. Yeah, we did all the shit that we've been doing at a, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:53:45       people are kind of looking at us like we're a bunch of cops now, aren't they? Alright. There you go. There. Then I tied a asteroids. Dinosaurs are in our foreign policy without ever reading a goddamn thing about. How'd you like that everybody? I think I hit new heights of ignorant. Um,

Speaker 6:          00:54:02       yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:54:03       I'm too stupid. Even. I don't know what word comes next after that. All right. What do we got here? Alright. What the fuck is an excellent bill? Our family friend, our friend of the family and investment banker from Yale Business School, extremely successful, was married about five years ago. He was married to a bitch who went to Harvard law school and worked as a very successful lawyer even when they were married. Okay. So he's an investment banker. She, okay. It sounds like an arranged marriage. This is one of those things where every day somebody in their life has on a blue blazer anyways. He says by themselves, they made more money in a year than most people make in 10 years. That's not their fault. They also studied hard enough to get into Yale and Harvard or were born into it. At which point good for them. They got lucky.

Speaker 2:          00:54:51       Um, you know, you can't get mad at people who get who, who were born into going to Yale and Harvard. You can't get mad at that shit unless you are helping out people who were born into sweatshop labor. If you were actually helping them get out of that, then you can get mad at that shit. But if you're just sitting in the middle wearing sweat shop, labor clothes and not giving a fuck, and you weren't born into sweatshop labor, I don't think, personally, I don't think he'd get mad at someone who's born at that blue blood shit. See that? There's another fucking Barbara of logic for you there anyways, by themselves. They made more money in a year that most people make in 10 years when they got divorced, the husband got custody of the kids, but the wife got the house and half of every penny of the husband would ever make for the rest of his life.

Speaker 2:          00:55:35       That doesn't make sense. Let's say came, drew that up. Not only could she now easily support herself. She remarried another lawyer that may just as much as her but continues to spend the original husband's money. But as far as I know, when she gets remarried, the alimony stops. Yeah. Says the child support I believe, unless he doesn't legally adopt them, I don't know. It's weird. And it also goes from state to state and I've also never read up on those laws. People just told me about him. Um, anyways, she has no kids to take care of or anything, but she's still got everything. We live in Massachusetts, which means the divorce laws heavily favor females, but still, what the fuck? Yeah, it's brutal. I think eventually they will be reform, uh, reformed, uh, reformed or reformed. They will be reformed in another shape. They'll be reformed.

Speaker 2:          00:56:26       What, you know, guys, if you're still listening to this fucking podcast, I mean, other than beyond to just listen how fucking stupid I am to make yourself feel better, please don't listen to me. Uh, yeah. I mean, they are what? They are divorced. Lars are what they are. And, um, I'm done bitching about him because I'm not doing anything. I'm not starting a movement to try and change him. Um, I'm a lazy fuck. I like to sit around and complain. But, um, if you have a petition, I'm all about it. I'll sign it. I'll definitely sign it. Uh, in fairness, um, when the woman makes more money, a guy can do that too or too. Uh, but the way the world is set up, the guys make most of the fucking money. So I guess that's one of the trade offs. So in the words of Mr Hand, get a good one. Fast Times at Ridgemont high referenced to you all the people out there. Get a good one. Get yourself a good woman.

Speaker 2:          00:57:24       Um, if I ever got divorced firing, get married and if I ever get divorced, I'm going to tell you right now, I am going to go into such as zen space. I already know what the fuck I'm going to do. I'm going to get a one bedroom apartment. I'm going to get an electronic drum kit and we're gonna have a one fucking bowl, one plate, one fork, one spoon, one knife. I'm going to have a fucking TV and have all the sports packages and I'm going to dress like Malcolm Young, which is fucking jeans, t shirt. No belt. That's it. I'm going to ride a bicycle and I'm just gonna. I'm just, I'm tapping out. I'm never going to best buy again. I'm never going to target other than after I get my bulk. Can you buy one ball? I didn't think he can't.

Speaker 4:          00:58:12       You know

Speaker 2:          00:58:13       I'm going to. I will. I will. I want you to have a vacuum cleaner. I'll have a little broom and a dust pan and I'm going to live like a fucking monk. That's it. Then I'll give her all my fucking money. I'll keep telling jokes. I don't give a shit. I'll give her all the fucking money. Hey, you want it? Is this gonna make you happy? Go ahead. Fuck it. Fuck it. Fuck. Do I care? You're not when it rains. Do I get wet now? I don't am I eating everyday? Fine. I'm going to get into that mindset and I'll send her that alimony and child support check and I will draw a big maniacal fucking smiley face on it and uh, that's it. And I will show up. You know what I'm going to buy? I would, I buy a Chevy citation with the sideways radio and I would redo that fucker.

Speaker 2:          00:59:09       I'd have the ugliest fucking car on top and underneath would be sweet. I teach myself how to do all of that Shit, you know? That's what I would do. That's I was, I already have the game plan. Do you know this is what society successful. You've got to, you got to have everything all mapped out. I'm not even married yet and I'm still fucking, I, I already have a plan if I get divorced. Okay. People, you got to think ahead. All right friends, ugly chick, uncle Billy. Boy, if you're a fucking divorce right now, you want to do that rather than trying to get all your shit back. How about this? How about fuck heaven. Shit not, there you go. It's about the stupidest thing you ever heard. But think about it. This is a brilliance in it. Fuck it.

Speaker 2:          00:59:53       Why do you need to have them? You don't need a man cave, you know? Then something's going to break down and some, you know, whatever the fuck that geek squads got to come over there. You don't want to deal with that shit. I would keep it as simple to have a banana for breakfast. You know, take some NHL Games, but some NBA, whatever the fuck you went to, sit there and read the paper. You know, I think I'm onto something here, right? Fuck iPods. Get a stereo. Let's do a record. Start churning butter. Just go, go the other way. Don't let her win you go the other way. Start making your own clothes. All right. You don't gotta go that far, but you don't what I'm saying? Um, anyways, friends, ugly chick. Take a pasta, making class, um, friends, ugly chick, Jesus. This is going to be mean uncle Billy boy.

Speaker 2:          01:00:50       My friend recently got us into his first real relationship. This fucking broad is a real cunt to start. Uh, she doesn't want him hanging out with any of his friends and basically it doesn't let him leave the house. Now I got to tell you something that's complete bullshit, okay? Okay. I agree with she doesn't want him to hang out with any of his friends. She could be like controlling and to, but to say she doesn't let him leave the house. Is this guy literally trying to leave the house and she's fucking putting them in a headlock. You know, putting them in a chicken wing or some shit. Figure four leg lock. No. Your friend is a pussy with a capital p Dash. See, this is what now he's he, he should be laying down the law. He needs to be, hey, hey, hey enough. Settle down.

Speaker 2:          01:01:45       Settle down. I'm with you, but I'm living a balanced life here. Let me draw a circle here. This is the time of spending with you. This is the time I'm spending with my friends. This is my alone time. This is my drink and bear time. All right. The whole circle has to be filled with different shit sweetheart or I'm not going to be happy. Are you telling me you want me to be miserable? If you are, I am leaving for good. If you're not, then fucking work with me. All right? That's what your friend needs to say before I even get through all this. Anyways, goes living in Buffalo, Buffalo. It is rather customer to go out once a week for chicken wings, beer and watch some good guts watching some goddamn hockey. Oh, by the way, shout out to this. Say both. They fucking own the Bruins.

Speaker 2:          01:02:33       It is just a regular season. I'm not trying to jinx you guys, but you guys, uh, you, you're kicking our ass. I, you what sucks is I taped the last game. I'm not trying to avoid an ass kicking, but you know, for some reason I take it and I came home and the screen was blank. I think it was actually on the NHL network. I take the wrong, um, I take the wrong one, so I actually missed it. Um, I did read the box scores and all that type of stuff. Uh, you know what I love? I love how you guys keep, I keep forgetting the guy's name, your big six foot eight inch goon. How you guys keep giving Bruins fan shit that Milan Lou, Lou Cheech won't fight. Was it John Scott? Whatever his fucking name. What, why would, why the fuck would you do that?

Speaker 2:          01:03:16       Hey, let's have one of our best players, one of the best power forwards in the league. Fight a guy six foot taller than him who weighs 50 more pounds than he does. Six inches taller than him when a five, six inches taller outweighs and by 40 50 pounds. And who's an absolute guru? There's a great trade off and that we'll have Lou Cheech who can score goals and actually play the game. Sit down for five minutes and all you guys do is lose a goon. Why would we do that? And we'll risking having one of our best players get hurt. Why would we do that? That was like back in the day of Montreal. Canadien fans would get pissed at that. He wouldn't fight George La Rock, you know, because he'd beat up one of their fucking, uh, I don't know where the fuck he beat up. Some guy.

Speaker 2:          01:04:03       It's, I don't know. Someone was going to Lou Cheech never fights anybody his size. I click up Blue Cheech, uh, on youtube by searching the first guy he's fighting as a guy his size who actually waste more than 15 pounds. Then him, I'll get some guy in Toronto and he beats the shit out of him. Okay. Who Cheech could be your guy up, your fucking family up and a in something else to make three. Alright. Stop questioning his toughness. You can do it all you want, but I'm not buying into it. Hey, how come your best guy is in fighting the guy that we have that can't even play?

Speaker 2:          01:04:37       Um, anyway, so let's, let's continue on here. Hey, by the way, you got to go to buffalo. Fuck Niagara Falls. You got to go to Wa. Was it Duffy's or anchor bar? I never, I went to anchor bar like the one time in history they ran out of wings. I was at first, he again, we went to anchor bar first the first night and then in the second day we would go to a sabers game. We went to Ankara Barn. Uh, and they, they ran out of fucking links. So, uh, and I got to tell you, man, they, they make up like nobody else in the goddamn country. Um, so anyways, he goes, this broad won't even let them out of the house. I won't even let about out once a week for that. She has wrapped brains so badly, warped his brains so badly that he now thinks she's right in saying we are a bad influence on him. We've all been friends since early elementary school for Christ's sake, and she's only known him a couple of months. Here's where it gets fucked up. He's by no means a bad looking guy and she looks like she got bum rushed and was beaten in the face with the club and for the Cherry on top, on top, she has her peace. Now, how do you know that unless that guy got up and told you, bill, what the fuck do I do to wake him up?

Speaker 2:          01:05:53       Uh, there's nothing you can do it. There's nothing you could do. Come on man. This like that guy is either wired to be submissive or he wasn't raised right.

Speaker 4:          01:06:09       You know,

Speaker 2:          01:06:11       I think a big thing, you know, with the kid that I don't have, the way I try to raise my kid that I don't have is a, I just realized I've been leaning back and sitting forward. So I'm sure the volume is all over the place. I apologize. Uh, one of the biggest things you got to do with kids did, you got to get them out of this shell? You know what I mean? Um, like I had, uh, you know, uh, who the hell is,

Speaker 2:          01:06:42       who was it? One of my friends, um, I'm trying to do this dad, I don't like talking about people in my life. Whatever. Somebody I knew came down. They were wholly in the, in there, uh, I guess right around the high school age and they came down to New York and I immediately, first thing I did, I made, made him like hail a cab, walk into a Bodega. I shown him out of work, if you fucking get a paper, you don't have to stand in line. Just put a quarter down and just hold it up and say post or whatever. Daily News, you know, just, and got them immediately acclimated into speaking up in interacting with the fucking city and the person within like, you know, two days had that shit down and was like, Oh man, I feel like a New Yorker. And like that, that's what you have to do with kids.

Speaker 2:          01:07:26       You've got to get them. Um, you can't have those kids that hide behind your fucking leg would when, um, that, you know, you're meeting someone, this is Mr so and so, and they're hiding behind your leg. You can't have that. You got it from fucking day one. Get them out there, shake hands, look people in the eye talk and you've, I don't know how to do it. Does that never had a kid. But I think it's really important to have to get your kid in tune with what he or she is thinking and what he or she wants. Nobody wants that situation.

Speaker 4:          01:08:00       MMM.

Speaker 2:          01:08:02       And if this woman is the way you're painting her out to be, this is the only type of person because she's so fucking insecure that she can actually be with, does she have to find somebody so weak that mmm, that person is going to allow them to just completely take over their lives. And I'll tell you what's funny is after a while, these controlling type of fucking people, they ended up hating the person that they're with. They do because they just don't respect them after a while. You know what I mean? They finally got exactly what they wanted. This person that they can use like a fucking robot and in the end they don't respect them. So,

Speaker 3:          01:08:38       mmm.

Speaker 2:          01:08:42       I Dunno what I would, um, you know what dude, this is a childhood friend. I could tell you really wanted to guide back. He take a shot taking it back.

Speaker 3:          01:08:52       MMM.

Speaker 2:          01:08:54       Don't say that she's ugly. Don't mention her herpes. It's just be like, I mean dude, you're literally trying to undo this guy's hard drive at this point. If this guy, his self esteem is his fucking low, this is, you know, this is like, wait, why the doctor Phil show sucks. It's because somebody is going to come in here and now this is like you're talking about this guy. I'm guessing it's at least in 25 years old. You're talking about a quarter of a century of thinking one way and then you watch doctor Phil. I'd be like, you got to stick up for yourself if you want to go out with your friends, you got a tailor. All right, we're going to commercial. And like it doesn't work like that. And also on Doctor Phil Show, he would never do that because he would actually be supporting the fucking guy. Okay. And at the end of the day it's a God damn business and who watches that show but a bunch of broads, um, yet you somehow know something about it, don't you bill? Well, I live with a woman. She doesn't watch him anymore. I just can't make funding. Make it kept making fun of how Dr Phil looks like a crooked cop.

Speaker 3:          01:09:55       MMM.

Speaker 2:          01:09:56       I don't know. He just like, I just not look trustworthy to be at all. Yeah, I mean, you know, I'm just judging them. You don't have the same way people judge me. It's all fair. It's all fair in love and war. All right. That's the podcast for this week. Everybody,

Speaker 3:          01:10:09       uh,

Speaker 2:          01:10:10       I'm actually going to go to a sports bar here and watch the island or some becoming a fucking island is fan. I've been watching him lately. Leader turning the corner. I hated them when they were a kid just because they were awesome. And every time the Bruins would get the w the one tank and we never got past the Canadians back in the day that if we somehow lucked out and somebody else beat the Canadians. This is pre 1988 we basically owned the fucking Canadians since 1988. I hope you guys really realize that in Montreal. You guys have not been a fucking factor in our lives since 1988. It's been great. It's been a wonderful 25 years. I know what you guys are saying. Oh, we beat you in this playoff series beating in that playoff series. Hey, that shit's going to happen. We used to never beat you. All right, good luck with your rebuilding. I'm just fucking with you actually like what you guys are doing up there. Uh, okay. What am I talking about here? That's the podcast for this week.

Speaker 3:          01:11:04       Uh,

Speaker 2:          01:11:06       anything I have to announce, I'm at the Wilbur theater this weekend. Thank you everybody for buying the tickets. I'm going to try and give you a heck of a show. Go yourselves. Don't take any shit. And if you're in a relationship like that last guy, you need to get out of it, you should be allowed to have friends and go out and see the meteors crashing into earth. All right. See you next week.
