Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on is bill burn? It's the Monday morning podcast from Monday, June 24th, 2013. How are Ya? How's it going? I know it's Tuesday morning. Had to do the math there on the date. I apologize for not doing the podcast earlier. I was a, I was in New York this weekend. Being a fancy man is Jimmy Norton would say I was at the, uh, the, the premiere of this movie that I have a really small rolling, it's called the heat. It stars Sandra Bullock and Melissa Muck and uh, Michael Rappaport. Now all these, all these people, all these people are in it and a yours truly bill Billy red faces in it for a couple of seconds. Don't blink or you will miss me. But that movie comes out this weekend. Um, this upcoming weekend I should say. So, uh, do me a solid day. Had to go out and check it out if you can. I'd really appreciate it's very funny movie and uh, I got to do the whole Hollywood thing. Went back to New York, walk the fuck and red carpet. You know, it answered a couple, two or three questions. I went in, I saw the movie, I enjoyed it. And then I got drunk with Joe to Rosa and Paul Versey. You know, what else could you ask for in the weekend? I know what she could ask for. Yeah. Victory.

Speaker 1:          00:01:27       Send it to fucking gave seven back in Chicago. That's something I could have asked for. I could ask for the hockey gods to be just, how about we get a fucking lucky bounce. How about one of our shots goes off the boards and bounces in a weird way and record Shay's off five fucking guys and goes in the neck. Can we get one of those? Just one. And you know what, it was not meant to be. Hats off to the, uh, Stanley Cup champions. Chicago Blackhawks say, or definitely without a doubt, the best team, uh, this year. And um, you know, they would just say what is better? It's all I can say they were better. Uh, one goal better every fucking game it's saved. But, um, I got to admit, I, I, you know, there's no one on their team. I hate and that says something after watching them for six games, it's like nobody on their teams a cunt, you know, they got one, they got, they have one pest. That's it. Other than that, you know, we've got a pest and Marshawn, so I will tell you that. What's fucking annoyed me though is I dunno what this white hair dude's name is, but I'm watching on nhl.com how do you mispronounced Charisse name?

Speaker 1:          00:02:42       You know, he kept calling Chera. Well abroad's Gadda they got chair a bat there. Eight and Burley. Yay. It's like he just got brought up from the fucking minors. Guys want to Norris trophy. You can't pronounce this fucking name correctly. Um, anyways, Jesus Christ, you want to talk about a fucking, just taking the wind out of his sails, sitting there on the edge of your seat thinking, okay, just hold on. Hold on, hold on. Don't let them tie it up and he fucking tie it up and then they score another one. What was it? 17 seconds later. The first one I'll go with, but you just, you can't let that other one happened. But uh,

Speaker 2:          00:03:22       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:23       I don't know. Fucking Dave Bollen guys, just a great hockey player. I don't know how the fuck that happen. How does it happen? You know, it kills me, fucking kills me. But, um, it was a great series and an original 61 and I actually still like the Black Hawks and I think they have fucking great uniforms and a God dammit. God fucking damn. What the fuck to goals? I mean, we literally went from, okay. I mean, I'm like,

Speaker 2:          00:03:53       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:03:54       thinking in my head. All right, game seven can, do you think they can do it again? As I'm freaking out. Hold on, hold on, hold on. And then they fucking tie it up. And I was like, Oh God, another fucking over time. You're killing me.

Speaker 2:          00:04:07       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:08       Can I fucking mentally make it through another fucking overtime as I sit here having no effect on the game for some reason stressing out. Could I make it through it? Oh, right day, I guess. I guess we don't have to go to overtime. Thank you day Boleyn for just a fucking end in that real quick. Um, but I got to tell you, um, I was blown away by what the Bruins were able to do this season that, you know, actually, you know, game one and game six was kind of the Bruins team that I saw years where they would get up to one, three, one and they had problems holding onto a lead. So I actually thought, I didn't even think they were going to make it out of the first round. So I can't say I was psyched that that happened. Whatever, we got a great core base. We can, we come back, bring up fucking Douggie Hamilton. He got a lot of experience. The blood, the blue. Uh, the only good thing about the hawks winning it in Boston was I didn't have to listen to that stupid

Speaker 3:          00:05:02       Dota.

Speaker 1:          00:05:05       Just when you think nothing could be more annoying than Oh, whatever. After that, after a goal, that fucking mindless song and looking at those fat fucking brought Eaton Chicago Fed back dumb mustaches. They even have on my, just thinking of a fucking SNL sketch at that fucking song,

Speaker 1:          00:05:29       you mine as well be. You might as well. What does that fucking Song I get knocked down, but I get up go and like those are songs that should only be played. You know, when you're on a cruise ship and you've just signed up for the aerobics class, you know what I mean? Nobody listens to those fucking songs. She really got to get rid of that. Other than that top to bottom. I think Chicago is a great organization, but uh, you know, they always got to have something fucking Douchey to either appeal to kids or just get mindless fiddle. Faddle eat and fucking morons. The buy tickets. Yeah, I did say fiddle. Faddle it's still exists. Um, goddammit. That shit was good when you were a kid. Send it right through the fucking roof with the sugar and they always got to have something like that.

Speaker 1:          00:06:19       You know, like the Red Sox, Wally, really Wally, how many women were in the room when that came up? That fucking name Gail. Hey God, that's cute. You know what? I'm not going to blame women. This is not a sex, a battle of the sexiest topic. This is just a fucking dose shills topic. And you, you can file all of that. Let's say I told, you know what I mean? Now I'm being honest about my teams. Why don't we do that next week for a topic? Write in something, you know of your home team that they do that they just really, that's just such a blatant fucking reach out to try to grab non sports fans. Um, you know what's creepy about Wally with the Boston Red Sox is that's really like, I mean, the team is basically like a religion. So you're trying to get them when they're young. So it's, it's like you giving them candy, you know, it's just something creepy about it.

Speaker 1:          00:07:20       We'll have a fucking adult come walking up in some big furry fucking outfit or whatever the hell the guide, they have thing where's right. Be like on a mission to be friendly to kids, not because it's the right thing to do, not because you love kids, because you know, someday that kid is going to have some sort of alcohol problem and want to hopefully want to get hammered at your ballpark and you want his booze money in your fucking pocket. Right. All done under the guise or dressing up like a fucking woolly mammoth, you know. Oh, that's right. People. I'm polling. Um, well I'm looking behind the curtain to mascot mascots this week. I'm pulling back that curtain. I'm showing you the ugly fucking truth. Um, oh, it's going to be a while. It's going to be a while before I get over the kick in the balls that, that last fucking minute and 10 seconds was it was, I think they kicked my left ball first and then the Dave Bolan was the fucking right ball.

Speaker 1:          00:08:28       Uh, not only did they knock the Bruins out of the playoffs, not only do we not win the cup, but now simultaneously hockey is over and I have to wait for the Nhl all the way until October. So you know what, you know I'm going to get over this Bruins loss. I'm going to watch the day game. There's nothing better than watching a day game, a Dodgers game out here. You just sit there by yourself sipping on a fucking login and you listened to Vince Scully. It's great. It takes a second though. Like I think how deep into the, uh, the summer, obviously there was a strike this year, but how deep into the, into the summer that basketball and the NHL goes and like how up tempo and high scoring and all that while hockey's not really high scoring, but whatever, um, just how the energy level to go from that to then settle into a great day for a ball game. Uh, we got a couple of, it's going to be a pitcher's duel here at commits Geek.

Speaker 1:          00:09:43       That's ball one. Yep. Yep, Yep, Yep. Don't even play that as fast, but that they've just fucking, you gotta settle into it. You have to settle into baseball. You know what I mean? It's like you haven't been driving like a fucking maniac and then your girl looks at you and just like you're scaring me to have it right. And then you have to fucking mentally bring yourself down from that play off energy that you will fucking drive and with and you've got to somehow calm yourself down and then literally waves somebody into your lane. That's what it's like to go from the Stanley Cup finals or even the NBA finals. NBA Finals are great. That was another heartbreaker watching the spurs lose that one. And um, and my frustration continues with these pile on fucking teams. I've come to the, uh, the acceptance that it is a new fucking error I guess.

Speaker 1:          00:10:39       So I'm going to quit whining about it and obviously all of those guys who won on Miami could have one in any era, but it's just, I hate it cause I don't know how to compare him to bird magic and all those other guys because uh, you know, cause bird magic and Moses Malone never hung out on p Diddy's yacht right there on line of flip flops or whatever the fuck they would have had back then if it was like today and uh, decided that they were all going to go join the fucking Milwaukee Bucks or something. So I dunno. So congratulations also to the Miami Heat. I don't hate the heat the way, uh, most Celtics fans to um, or hate ray Allen. I mean, Ray Allen wasn't ours the way Miami got them. It's the same way we got them. So I don't know what you crying about. And as far as the Miami heat go, hey, good on them. I mean there, there are always going to be a fucking expansion franchise to me. All right, put that little single digits. Fucking championships. What are they got three.

Speaker 4:          00:11:42       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:43       They got three. Is that what they get? How many they got? I don't fucking know. Yeah, they got three and a, they might be the next Lakers cause they bought all three of them. All right. Enough of my fucking bitch moaning and complaining and whining. Um, oh by the way, I did last night. I don't know if he's posted it yet, which would be classic Jay more to post it and then give me shit for not re tweeting about it. Um, I did Jay Morris podcast. We had a great time, uh, about 10, 15 minutes in. I tried to take them to task about his it fucking or how I read is a flip and text message and he fucking took my, he took my legs out by immediately apologizing. Just kind of ended the whole fucking thing. But uh, you know, it was still, we still at a great time.

Speaker 1:          00:12:32       Um, so anyways, what a, what a fucking week in the world of sports, especially in Boston. The Bruins loser had Greek. Yeah. Um, doc rivers signs with the fucking clippers. Um, I'm, I'm going to believe in Danny Ainge on this one. And I'm going to go with the philosophy that you don't want to pay a coach $7 million a year when he has no chance to win because you're going to just start from scratch. But I got to tell you, like eventually you're going to need a doc rivers to take you to the promised land. You know, the guy knows how to fucking win.

Speaker 4:          00:13:12       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:13:14       I Dunno. It sounded like, I don't know. From the couple things that I saw, it sounded like doc didn't want to go through a rebuilding thing and the Celtics wanted to rebuild so they let him out of his contract. So thanks to doc rivers and everything he did for bringing the fuck and shelter x back. And, uh, I'm going to believe in Danny angels. We go through the rebuilding process, although I hate getting rid of fucking proven people for draft picks. I was actually watching it this morning. I couldn't sleep. I was so fucking upset about that loss last night. And, uh, I put it on the NBA channel and I was watching the 2001 draft. And, you know, it's not the guys that make it. It's the guys that don't, that fucking, it just, I forget who the 76 is picked in 2001, but he was some 20 year old kid, you know, supposed to be this shot, block and phenom. And I, I never even heard of the guy, not like I'm the biggest NBA Fan, but uh, so that's what makes me nervous about that shit. So, uh, other than that, what else happened in Boston sports? Aaron Hernandez. That story gets sadder and creepier by the fucking day. Did you see the guy's house

Speaker 1:          00:14:26       fucking house? That's it. You made it, you kept that house at 20 fucking three. I would just think he's just sitting in that house just wishing he could just rewind his life fucking six days, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:14:39       and just stay home and watch fucking Beethoven part three. You have to be thinking that unless you just a complete psycho. But uh, all this shit is a legend at this point. But all of his fucking actions, he's gotta be neck deep in this shit. Then you turn in your cell phone and it comes in you like you drove over it with the fucking car, you clean your house and then you have a bunch of people come in and reclean it. By the way, any cops out there? Any cops out there? Hey, you know what, let's let's go against the grain here. Um, I actually, long time ago when I was doing the uninformed show with the, uh, the teen idol sensation, Joe to Rosa, we actually had a, this police officer come in that we knew through a Gotham comedy club and he came in and the big thing was, uh, me and Joe are going to try both of us individually, individually.

Speaker 1:          00:15:30       We're going to try to come up with the perfect murder. So we come up with our scenarios where we bring the cop in and I go to pitch mine, and this is, this is how far I got in mind. I go, all right, so me and a friend of mine, and then he goes up. That's it. He goes, you're already caught. And I'm like, what do you mean I'm already caught? He goes to second, you involve somebody else. He goes, the chances of getting caught, it's, it's, if, if mathematically it was possible to go beyond 100%, um, that's what you're doing with that because now you got, you had just have twice the chances of somebody rolling over. Somebody's getting paranoid, somebody saying the wrong fucking thing, somebody's feeling guilty. Somebody leaving some hay is at the crime scene, the whole fucking thing. His, his basic thing was if you have no priors and you just go out and kill somebody that you have no connection to, no connection to and nobody fucking saw it, you know, how are they going to catch you?

Speaker 1:          00:16:33       And then the other thing he says is, do not move the body. He goes, just leave it there. He talked, told me a story about somebody fucking killed somebody. It felt bad for the dog. So we took the dog with them or something like that. And that's how they ended up connecting them to the crime scene was the dog hairs. He took the dog and let it go. Hoping someone would fucking rescue it. I don't know what, but they found this, the dead dudes dog hairs in his fucking car is, it's over. You know what I mean? It's fucking over. How did I get on this subject? It was just a fucking creepy ass week. And it Paula Deen running around dropping the fucking end word ever dental. He is, she's making a fucking souffle. You know I actually met her one time when I was in Atlanta. She seemed like a sweetheart. I told her, I go, you know what? I go, you cook like my mom. And she's like, you know what? That's like the nicest thing anybody could say.

Speaker 1:          00:17:31       I don't know what, what do you do? So now what? So now your fire and does that make her less ignorant? Does that help her say the n word less when she's baking cookies? I don't know. Then you know what? I think each race should have like an ambassador. Right? And when somebody does some shit, like, like the ambassador just, they just go out and they go fishing for a weekend, you know, and they just sort of talk it out and you give that person of frame of reference. So anytime they think it's some ignorant shit, they go, oh wait, now what about so and so I went fishing with, you know, it's not all bad. Right. Or that guy in ESPN when he said the stuff about gay people, you know, God go send them to a musical and I'll fucking now, I dunno, but I don't know if the, the firing thing at Jesus Christ.

Speaker 1:          00:18:22       Oh, speaking of Jesus. No, Jj. Did you guys, uh, did you guys see that fucking dude walk on that? Why all the way across the Grand Canyon? Did you see that shit? That was one of the most incredible fucking things I've ever seen in my life, in my life. I always have to repeat that twice when I say in my life. And you know why that is? Because I saw, I watched wife swap a long time ago and this one family, they will live in like pirates if anybody can find this clip for me. It's one of my favorite clips. This guy just decided, he, we were all, his whole family was going to live like pirates and they dressed like pirates and arc and they just walked around. They had no fucking responsibility. The guy was totally avoiding being like an adult. So he worked from home or whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:19:15       So they'd swap wives. So his pirate wife leaves and then incomes like some fucking totally conservative Nancy Reagan business suit wearing woman. And she's just like, no dude, you need to go get a job or whatever. So he goes and he does some job filing and he comes home that day right after living like a pirate, he has to put on this monkey suit and go down and fucking earn a living. And he comes home and she just goes, so how was it? And he goes, that was the worst day of my life. And she goes, well, you know, and he goes off my, he screamed at again.

Speaker 1:          00:19:57       It's fucking great. So anyways, getting back to the fuck and ginger who walked across the wire, dude, I watched it after cause everybody kept tweeting me gone bill, Hey, I'm really rooting for you. You put on some weight, but I'm really rooting for you to walk across the grandkid. You'd so I kind of heard about it. So I was already laughing going, all right, this guy must look like me a little bit. But anyways, when I was flying back from New York City, I watched it and I was, I was like, my palms were sweating watching this fucking guy, 1500 fucking feet in the air with no net, no lifeline, know anything. And he's walking across the wire and he every step is a thank you Jesus. Oh, thank you God lord you, Lord, thank you for getting rid of the wind. Like this fucking 30 mile an hour wind. This guy is, and then he's got his douchebag. Father going, okay, you're uh, you're one minute and six seconds and the journey your one minute and 36 seconds. He led his dad do this until about minute 18. And he just finally just goes, Dad, dad, I don't need you to tell me how long I've been out here. Like it's fucking arms, a tired as hell. It was like slanders getting mad. Like he couldn't be like dad, but if I was on the wire back down his truck.

Speaker 1:          00:21:23       All right, what difference does it make a fucking long. I'm out here. What am I going to punch a clock and fucking go to sleep and come back tomorrow? You asshole trying to walk across a wire, right?

Speaker 2:          00:21:36       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:21:37       This fucking guy, he's just sitting there, that's sitting here. He's walking across doing like this little slide step. You know how you would sort of like insert yourself into a photo to photo bomb somebody at this. Do you know that little slide step you do? He's doing that with these little ballet slippers on and I gotta tell you I was interested that he didn't have those shoes with the little toes on them. You know, there's creepy fucking things that just makes you want to just, you know, it makes your teeth hurt to look at them. Surprise. He didn't have those. Maybe it's his case. He had a prom. Make your luck. His big toe with the, uh, the index finger or toe. Right. Hang on like a fucking monkey. So anyways, he sit in his stepping across it going, thank you. Fine. Thank you. Jesus. Jesus. Oh, glory to you. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. Away.

Speaker 1:          00:22:29       At one point he actually sounded like he was having sex. He was going, yes. Jesus. Oh Jesus. Right. I know it was bugging people who aren't religious. Uh, it didn't bug me at all. I thought that guy was the shit. And if you think I wouldn't be out there talking to every God that I had ever heard of, I would have. Except that would've been, I would've been cursing at the same time. I would have been. Oh, thank you. God. You mother fucker. I would've been doing that. The whole fucking work. Thank you. God, you all of Fargo. I would be doing that way at some point. I were to crouch down, let go of that balancing thing and I just would have been hanging on to the fucking wire crying. But what, what would you do? Do this no fucking way you could ever get me to do what that guy is like.

Speaker 1:          00:23:28       That guy is the shit. I don't even know his name. I don't even know if his name, if he's listening for listening to this, please pray for me. Um, dude, how is time flying by this fast? 23 minutes in 23 minutes in on your Tuesday. Um, all right, let's do us read a of ads for this week. Everybody. Dude, I would have been praying everybody, oh, Buddha, Buddha, you fat motherfucker just can't meet across this. I'd want boulder to be laying down in the Canon in case I feel like Atlanta on his fucking stomach. Do that guy had to deal with like, I guess if, if, if you, uh, if you're walking in a rhythm, which you know is basically, if you have a consistent gate to how you're walking, when you're on a wire, it starts to bounce up and down. So every once in a while, I guess you either have to slow it down, switch it up, or crouched down.

Speaker 1:          00:24:24       Like this guy was, he paid, he took a fucking knee. How you do that on a fucking cable? I don't know. Um, I'm actually predicting this that they're going to start setting up fucking a little tight ropes at gyms because it's good for core strength. You know, somebody will sell out, analyze that and they'll put it like literally two feet off the ground with a bunch of AMF mats all around it. And you've got to wear a helmet and a fucking harness and all this shits and nobody gets sued. You know, they always do that. Like somebody does some really like manly takes balls the size of the Grand Canyon Shit. And then somebody turns it into like a workout, like the boxing workout. They have like the UFC workout, we'd do the fucking rope thing, you know, when you shaken out those fucking ropes, doing all this, the same shit those guys do, you do everything except fucking get the balls up to go fight another man, you know, or woman.

Speaker 1:          00:25:20       Um, so anyways, you know, I just realized, you know, that you ever see that, that that bully beat down thing, which is really an, it's, it's a terrible show because the cowards, they still don't stand up to them. There's usually two pussies that the dude's picking on. So it's like, why don't you teach them how to fight? They joined forces and then they go in the ring and they fight the bully. Right? Why are you sitting there having them outsourced? They're nuts. They lack of nuts. You know what I mean? Download to somebody else's balls is more, is more, uh, what they're doing and then he goes in and he kicks the shit out of them to make it a little fair. You know, it'd be great. They should take those, those, uh, the female ultimate fighters and bring him into the ring because they can knock out the average bully.

Speaker 1:          00:26:10       No problem. And then what's funny, that's extra humiliated. All right. That's just an industry note for that show.

All right, back to the podcast. Everybody. Um, oh, you know what I've been doing here? I didn't, I didn't mention this to you guys. I've been trying to become a little more worldly. I'm trying to, I'm trying to learn all the, all the countries in the capitals. Oh Jesus. Um, I got, I can do the Middle East and all of Europe. Europe's a motherfucker when you get to the, uh, when you get to Eastern Europe, cause once checklists of Aki and Yugoslavia splintered into like seven or eight different fucking countries, you know what I mean? Just Shit. You never really hear about like, uh, what are some of the ones over that? I'll fucking enough. I don't even have it in front of me. I'm still trying to memorize them. But what I did learn there was some, I was just like, what the fuck is San Marino?

Speaker 1:          00:30:10       San Marino, capitol San Marino. And then you had like VAD, VAD, dues, Lichtenstein, and everybody over here. It makes fun of Lichtenstein. I remember growing up everybody, cause it's, it was like Beavis and butthead shit. Like as the word lick is in there, what are you doing? Their fucking liquid shy, you know, stupid shit like that. Um, evidently there's like five sovereign states in the world, uh, or cities, whatever the fuck you call them. And they kind of exist as their own little entities.

Speaker 2:          00:30:45       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:30:45       And uh, that sounds, if you got the money to live there, they're great. The tax rate is low. It's like Vatican City. Liechtenstein Monaco, I think Singapore and then something else that begins with an m.

Speaker 2:          00:31:02       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:31:03       I don't know if it's Malta, I don't know this, this, this five of them.

Speaker 2:          00:31:06       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:31:07       And I got to tell you like I would love if they have, if they ever came up with this show called, uh, the money trail or blood money or something. I can't imagine how much is oozing out of those fucking places. Vatican city goes without saying. All right. That just goes without fucking saying. You can't imagine what goes on in that city. Right. Considering the pope quit, even when the pope's just like, listen guys, I can't be the spokesperson for this shit anymore. Um, and interestingly enough, you never hear anything about Lichtenstein. You never hear anything about fucking Monaco other than the fucking Grand Prix. And it's just a bunch of rich countries over there tagging fucking top shelf ass.

Speaker 2:          00:31:50       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:31:50       Like fucking a third of their goddamn age. You know, how do I get into that party? That's what I want to know. Hey, by the way, did you guys see shit is heating up between China and Japan? They're going to, maybe they're going to go at it over some islands and you know, it would be great as a citizen of the United States here, you don't have to be phenomenal. If we just stayed the fuck out of it,

Speaker 1:          00:32:17       you know, we just stayed the fuck out of it and he just just got to watch this renewed rivalry. Oh rivalry. That goes way back to the beginning of time. All kinds of great fucking games they add back in the day, you know, Japan ran up the score and Nan King, right? The rape and Nan King, there's a of bad blood between the two of them. This is like when the Celtics and Lakers, like rivalry went dormant throughout the 90s and then it came back with a vengeance. So I think from what I've, the looks like eventually giant in Japan, China, which is just a fucking environmental disaster. The biggest mistake they fucking make, they would just like, look, we're going to have so many God damn people. If you ever decide to attack this country, there's just gonna be wave after wave after wave of fucking human beings coming over the fucking hell. Right.

Speaker 1:          00:33:18       Did they not know about nuclear weapons? You know, you just were one person can just kind of end the world. I mean, why, why didn't they just go that route? This part of the podcast is called in way over his head, Bill Byrd discussing world events without really reading up on him. Everyone. Um, so anyways, yeah, I can do all the capitals or the Middle East. It's great. Then you'll hear world knows you kind of know where shit is. You know, like I didn't know that the Czech Republic was tucked right in between that like a Poland and Germany, like West Virginia, between Ohio and Pennsylvania. You see that I use something normal, something that I could relate to. Hey Bill, why don't you shut the fuck up and read a question for this week? Okay, I could do that. Oh, by the way, the email is bill@themmpodcast.com. If you want to send it in an email, let me know.

Speaker 1:          00:34:12       What's the most embarrassing thing that one of your home teams does that makes you uh, wanna either choke somebody in the front office or punch the fan next to you cause they're participating. I'd love to hear it. All right. Butte, Montana, Billy boy. Uh, when, when you were on your red state tour, stop and check out Butte, Montana. Um, I'm excited for your upcoming show in Bozeman, Montana. I happened to live about an hour west of Bozeman in Butte. That's just a great fucking, that's a perfect name for a city in Montana. Butte, Montana. Beaut. Where are y'all from? Butte. Butte won't panel.

Speaker 1:          00:34:55       I ain't got time for two syllables. I gotta go man. The fence. You'll always a southern accent if the fucking most northern part of the country actually may not. I'm sorry. Alaska is all right. You're fucking geographical cut there. Uh, when you're making the drive from Boise to Bozeman, you will have to drive through Butte, Butte, Montana. You're, uh, you're driving through at a great time to stop for the afternoon and check it out. We have a beauty. We have beautiful old architecture in old and new giant minds. Older new giant minds. You're mining for giants. The fuck does that mean huge minds? I don't know anything about mine. Sorry sir. Talking shop there and he goes, and the day of your show, it will be evil Knievel day.

Speaker 1:          00:35:44       I gotta go. Well, the day of the show might be cutting it a little bit close. We got to stop in. Anybody can get a picture with an Elvis impersonator. I've never seen an even evil Knievel. Putin Personator I want I wanna. You know what sir? I might, I might, uh, I might check that out. Why am I saying everything fucking twice. Get the papers, get the papers. I might, I might, I might check it out there. They're the up, uh, the uptown. I've got to do it again now. My fucking myself. The uptown is filled with daredevil stunts, booze, good food and crazies. Something I thought you guys might like to check out. Probably get a good story out of it. At least. Can't wait for the show. Fucking and I gotta tell you I love those kinds of places. I love going to these places that are considered the middle of fucking nowhere and checking out, uh, you know, the architect texture here in all the fucking, uh, history of the places, seen what they do for fun.

Speaker 1:          00:36:41       I've never heard of an evil Knievel day. I'm assuming he's from that area. Beer, Butte, Montana, evil Knievel, the size of balls he had, he would have fucking g would have driven his fucking motorcycle. They weighed like 10,000 fucking pounds in the early seventies he would have driven it right across that wire, you know, with some sort of shoot that came out too early. Knock that Jesus freak right off the fucking wire. Oh, thank you Jesus. Oh that step was in your name. Oh, glory to you, God for making these dancing slippers. Marrying too young. Doris billing. Billing's worth the Reddington. I liked that one. I would have just gone with Billingsworth Redington you know what? If I ever moved to Lichtenstein, that's going to be my name, my fake name. When I tried to hide my blood money,

Speaker 2:          00:37:32       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:37:34       because one day I go to a show and I sell the DVDs and I take pictures first and I take the door and they take all the fucking march money and then I just don't do a show. And then I'm going to relocate to Lichtenstein and I'm going to go buy Billingsworth Reddit, Billingsworth Reddington and I'm going to have a fucking pocket watch. And a, and a little spectacle spectacle. What do you call that? A little fucking, not a gargoyle. What do you call that thing? A cyclops. What do you call it? Thing when you gotta you gotta fucking a bifocal now by means to not a trifocal, uh, sing a unit. Unifocal I'm going bicycle here. Hey, how many more wing walkers are going to die? I didn't know people were, were fucking wing walking. I didn't know that. Still fucking existed in like three of them died.

Speaker 1:          00:38:16       See bad things happening. Trade. Now you start over at three. Keep counting them. I bet thousands of wing walkers have died. Bad things happen when you walk out on a wing. You superstitious. Cons. Um, eight bill, am I getting married too young? Well, never gotten married, so I don't know. I don't know what to tell you. Uh, but I will read this. I'm 25 and live with my girlfriend. She's great. Pretty and things are going very well. I've dated her for four years and she's by far the longest relationship I've ever had. She's from a somewhat traditional family where people get hitched and their early twenties. Dude, where the fuck do you live that you're 25 and you use the word hitched from Butte? Me and my girl getting hitched going to have the wedding out there in the barn. You know, figured, figured we'd she could get dressed up there in the loft. I'd stay down here next to the horses. You know, we ain't gonna have no mute a music. Don't want to spook anybody in any animals here in a barn. Right. And they're not consummate the relationship over there and that stack of shit

Speaker 1:          00:39:30       just fucking knock her out right over there.

Speaker 2:          00:39:33       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:39:34       Um, God, just go there. Cornhusker sorry. Let's, let's stick with the fucking letter here. I'm in Dayton for her for four years. Uh, but, but Bob, people usually get hitched. Where the hell am I? Um, and because we dated for a while and I lived together, I already feel pressure from her and her family to pop the question. Oh, Jesus. Yeah, yeah. You know,

Speaker 1:          00:39:55       you're fucking, you've been with her for four years in the middle of nowhere where they say hitched surprise, they're not coming down there to have some sort of exorcism. Anyways, he says, I'm conflicted as I totally agree with you on the whole drafting and the first round idea. Oh that's my whole theory. You don't want to wait to get married too long or else you're going to fucking, you know, all the good, all the good draft picks had gone. Um, or what you do is you, you, you pick up someone who's proven like, but has had a problem like a Randy Moss type of chick, you know. Well, you know, it's going to be good for a couple of seasons before she fucking tries to run over the mailman with the car or something. I Dunno. He goes, I've had a great time with her family and she does with mine.

Speaker 1:          00:40:39       Do, do you love this girl? He goes, hello. Marriage is a scary concept to a young guy. It's not much more than what the situation I'm currently living in with her. I probably have a Peyton manning on my hands and I can see my single friends holding out for a Shannon shap or a Tom Brady in the sixth or seventh rounds and it seems too risky. I see them chasing mediocre girls around while I'm going scuba diving and biking with my girl. However, I'm still a young guy. I haven't dated that many girls in. It seems like it would be fun to have random sex with some pretty ladies and my city. My girl is awesome, but I have a penis. Thus the conflict, that's one of the truest things you'll ever hear. He goes, all right, I look forward here. And your advice saw you kill it up in Boston and you have more hair in your head. Then you think you do. Ah, that Nice. It's fallen out by the day by the second. Um, all right, let's go back here. What does he say here? Uh, you know what sir? You say a bunch of Nice things about it, but I never hear you say that you're crazy about her or that you love her.

Speaker 4:          00:41:41       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:41:43       I think that that was the biggest thing. I think maybe that's why you'd have more of a wandering eye rather than the fact that you just have a dick. Um, if you love this girl, I would get married sooner rather than later.

Speaker 4:          00:41:57       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:41:58       every guy that I know that ever got married and married the right one always said it's the smartest thing I ever did. All right. You don't want to grow up like me. All right? You don't want to still be out there drinking fucking whiskey, you know, looking like the owner of the bar rather than a patron.

Speaker 2:          00:42:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:42:17       MMM. Yeah. The like, look, you're asking me one of the most important decisions in your life. Who Do I marry? Should I marry this person? Um, I would ask myself these questions. Uh, does all right, are you in love with this girl? This is,

Speaker 1:          00:42:38       is this the one? Is this the mother your kids? If, if the answer's yes, then by all means get on with it. If the answer's no, then man up break up with her by a fucking year supply with the condoms and uh, go have some fun. That's my advice. How was that sir? I'm fluoride conspiracy. William, I just listened to you and to Rosa on uninformed. Oh, our old talk show comes up again. Talk about fluoride in the drinking water. I've reached, I've researched this for some time along with the other conspiracies and it's true fact is there are independent researchers from all around the globe that I've done study after study on sodium fluoride. Now they all found the same thing. Sodium fluoride damages, soft tissue including brain cells. Well, you know what I've learned with all this shit after years of being a conspiracy theorist is you have to, you have to then research the researchers and it just becomes way too much fucking work. And I just, after a while, just put my head down and go as just gimme a bacon, egg and cheese and just get off my fucking day here. Um, that's like somebody tweeted me, said, uh, some scientists, sometimes some sciences say that redheads are going to be extinct by 2060. I love that. Some scientists say, what scientist, what else did they say? My buddy just had a red headed lady. Now I had already had a baby. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:44:10       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:44:11       what last year in 2012 so in 2060, that baby God willing, we'll be 48 years old. So like I've said, unless you people who keep sending me this shit about the, the complete extinction, um, the final solution for fucking redheads by, you know, within 40 fucking years essentially, uh, you might want to look into your research a little more. You might want to research the researchers unless you have some sort of plan that I don't fucking know about. All right. Yeah. Jesus. I just pictured myself hiding with a bunch of other red heads with some fucking brunettes sympathizer, you know, sitting in the wall like some old Anne Frank. Um, anyways, what are we talking about here? Sodium fluoride. All right. As well as bone. It doesn't really matter if you switch toothpaste and buy bottled water because sodium fluoride can be absorbed topically. One study stated that dental fluorosis, which is slowly sodium fluoride, was proposed by the u s government to reduce reduced what? Brag, I'm guessing cavities. You left that out, uh, is in fact up to a lot higher in Florida. A water supply areas. What happened there? What happened with this whole point? One study stated that dental fluorosis is in fact up to a lot higher in fluoridated water supply areas.

Speaker 2:          00:45:44       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:45:44       that's a fragment sir, isn't it? Or is it the way I'm reading it? What am I, what word people am I not emphasizing that's making this sentence makes sense in my head as I hear it. Um, keep in mind that they get the sodium fluoride from smokestacks, scrub it and acid then sell it to the municipal water supply companies. They haven't produced one studies to suggest it does anything remotely close to what they claim. It does not even a study to combat the other studies that are done almost every year by various independent researchers from around the world. Um, yeah, I mean, I dunno. I don't fucking, I don't even know what's sodium fluoride is. I don't fucking know what it is. Do I want the scum from inside of a fucking smokestack on my teeth? I probably don't. I'd be willing to say that that does more harm than good.

Speaker 1:          00:46:40       You know what, sir? Why don't you take that fucking email and send it to a smart podcast to a podcast that's fucking smart. Why don't you do that? Is there a science one couple of guys in lab coats sweating in their lab coats, podcasting. I don't know. Fucking it. Here we go. William Burp. How do I come to terms with being average? Well, let me tell you, sir, you're asking the right guy. Um, love everything you do. Coming to see your show on August 23rd at the MGM. That's right. I'm going to be at the MGM and Foxwoods, Connecticut on August 23rd all in, by the way, I have a super secret, very special show that I'm going to be doing at the end of August. All right. I'm teasing it right now with another comedian

Speaker 1:          00:47:35       that is way beyond me or my abilities and I've always wanted to work with them and I reached out to them and we're going to do a co headlining show where you ask, I'm not saying shit until tickets go on sale. When you ask, I told you towards the end of August why bill? Why are you doing this? You Ass? Because I'm learning from other radio guy ship kind of put half the information out there. You get everybody at the end edge of their seats and then the fucking Black Hawk score two goals on you and it's over. Sorry. How do I come to terms that I just won't be financially successful to the point where money is not an issue. Jesus Christ. Dude, that that just made me feel sad. Why would you, why would you think that? All right. I guess going to go into detail as to why he goes, I'm 30 held many technical positions in the corporate ladder at a few big companies. It is everything office space made it out to be, which has driven me to file patents or ideas and improvements as well as start a few side businesses that didn't seem to really take flight. Well, there you go, sir.

Speaker 2:          00:48:46       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:48:46       you know you're, you're, you're, you're basing your self worth on other people employing you. All right. God knows I got enough shit on my podcast. He voice legal zoom, stamps.com all of that shit for you to run a fucking side business while you're holding down your job at this corporate nightmare that you don't want to be and believe in your talents. Dude, you think I just walked on stage and tried three fucking jokes and then it worked. I bombed for fucking years. For years and years and years, like almost the first 11 years of my career, I swear to God. Every time I went on stage it was a crapshoot whether it was going to go well or not. It was even longer than that. It's basically once you start selling tickets and people come out to your show that the bombing goes way down and it also makes you softer as a comic because people are coming out to see you. They give you a giant ovation as you go out there, they're already on your side. It's a home game. All right? Before you sell tickets as a comedian, every night is a fucking away game and it's a rivalry game and they fucking hate you. All right?

Speaker 2:          00:49:58       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:49:58       so I think you're a really talented guy. I think you know what? A lot of smart people, slightly depressed, which is what the, how this is reading and dude, you just got to get yourself, force yourself to pick yourself up off the mat and throw yourself against the wall. All right? That's what not yourself. Sorry. Stupid idea. Don't myself against the wall. Whatever idea you got, just keep putting it out there. All right? And you pat and all those fucking things and you get yourself a goddamn lawyer. So when these corporate come sniffing around and they want to dangle some carrot in front of you, you make sure you get as much as that carried as humanly fucking possible. All right. Is it donkey really that dumb that it just keeps walking towards that carrot? Is it looking at it like it's a mountain? Like wow, it's just way off in the distance, you know? Is the donkey sitting there praying to it's God as it just keeps [inaudible] thank you. What? What? What the fuck would that God be? Can't say Jesus off. Piss them off. Yeah. So we told me that day. Why don't you make fun of Muslims? You Pussy. Right?

Speaker 4:          00:51:03       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:51:03       I made fun of my own fucking religion. All right. I stay within my wheelhouse. I make fun of what the fuck. I know you heard me try to talk about Eastern Europe. I don't know shit about it embarrasses me. I know anything about Muslims other than, than they throw down the yoga mat every day around four o'clock when all the stoners start getting baked, they're actually talking to their higher power, which is my hour pi or power. And it's your higher, we're all praying to the same fucking vibe, that same spirit, you know, so fucking ridiculous. And everybody's got to do it their own way. Now you've got to fucking tap your elbows twice before you did it and you didn't do that. So now I'm going to saw your fucking head off. Yeah. In payable, people still show up and give it money and put on a silly hat. Right. Who's getting home? Anytime I think I'm going to die, I always start praying and I pray to the God that I was told, you know, I say a prayer, I say a prayer every time my plane takes off and ripped Fort Lance every fucking time, say a prayer that it doesn't fucking crash. You know? And when I think about it crashing, I know exactly what I would say to a higher power. I'm sorry.

Speaker 2:          00:52:16       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:52:17       All right. And then it'll be like, when I die and I go and get judged and he's like, sorry for what? And it just fits. You know what your way Lord Buddha, whatever the hell you are. A just straight as straight across the board. Sorry for Dell. Dell. Yeah. All of it. The whole fucking kitten caboodle, other than 8% of it, the other 92%. I'm just sorry. I knew it was wrong. I know what I was doing. I tried to pull myself out of the muck and I just, I was too weak a person, you know, which baby that's on you because you didn't fucking, you know, you put a four cylinder in me, you know, instead of giving me enough fucking horsepower mentally to pull myself out of the ditch. Yeah. Yeah. Blaming. You want some way? Get Out. You made me, you know the fuck.

Speaker 1:          00:53:04       If I made a car and it didn't run, I'm going to blame the car. Ah, Dad, do what you gotta do. Whatever. Sorry. Anyways, back to this year. Um, he goes, I work 50 to 60 hours a week, feeling burnt while trying my last side business, uh, with no time but work. I'm about to realize, fuck it. Don't, don't, don't quit. Do not quit.

Let me, let me see you just improvise. Taking the fall. We're going to throw out a couple of scenarios. All right. Just relax. Yeah, we got, we got a glass of water up there. You have a drink or generic. Okay. All right. First scenario. Um, fucking Sheryl crow somehow gets behind some can't that figures out that we have three year olds, uh, making the pampers down there in Honduras. All right. We need you to take the fall. Go. Ah, yeah. Um, okay. Uh, it's come to our attention that some of our, uh, practices in the a undergarment infant under garment industry have come into question. Um, we are looking into it. I accept full responsibility. The buck stops with me.

Speaker 2:          00:56:01       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:56:01       A Dye. I'm the head of that division. I don't like babies. I, I'm sorry. I don't, I don't know where to go. I have fuck it. Fuck you. And you're like, that isn't good. That was bad. And we could see a sweat from over here. Go back to your cubicle.

Speaker 2:          00:56:17       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:56:18       that's like parole. That's like a parole hearing in a corporate office. You don't, they bring in once every seven years and they see how good you are lying. And if you're not fucking good at it, they send you back to the whole back. Gee, a cubicle. It's like reverse Shawshank. Um, anyways, let's plow ahead here. So this disguise depressed in the shit out of me. He's given up on his dream and he wants young bitches on his fucking arm. I don't know what to do with this guy. He goes, I'm starting to think I need to accept the corporate grind for the next 35 years or the whole life is going to pass me by spending all my free time trying to start something. Your thoughts, it wouldn't be right unless I n ended this way. Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. All right. I don't think you're that bad a guy, sir. I'm just fucking with you. Uh, all right. Don't quit. All right. Don't quit it. You could. If you quit on yourself, nobody's going to believe in you. It's going affect your entire fucking life. You can't fucking quit ever. You never quit unless you wrong. You know if you fucking rock, but then what you do is you just go in another direction. That's all

Speaker 2:          00:57:28       right.

Speaker 1:          00:57:30       Like, let's say you always wanted to be a singer, but he's saying like me at some point, you got to have that honest moment and be like, I have a fucking stick at this. But it, who's to say that you're, you're not a good producer. You couldn't record singers, you know, or you couldn't manage singers or you couldn't go down to the church choir and just lip sync and act like you were singing, right? I'll get a sex change, right? And turn yourself in some hot piece of ass and be, get to the top of the pop charts.

Speaker 1:          00:57:56       There's always a way, sir. And I'm not saying to get a sex change. I'm not saying not to get one. All right? Just listen to me here. Just fucking keep. Don't fucking give up on that shit. That's, you know what it is. That's your passion. Your passion is what you're doing when you're not working 50 to 60 hours a week. All right? And the reason why this is coming off so depressing is because your heart is in that. And this voice is getting louder every day saying you don't have what it takes and you need to quit. I'd been there as a fucking comic. It's the fucking worse. It hits you, hits you right in the chest. All right? You got to push through that. All right. What I do is I come up with new jokes and I go even harder the next show. So that's what you gotta do. You gotta come up with a new Flowbee, a new George Foreman Grill, a new fucking iPad. Whatever the hell you're working on, you got to go even harder, right? And someday you'll have a podcast and you'll repeat shit nine times in a row and you'll mispronounced stuff,

Speaker 2:          00:58:57       right?

Speaker 1:          00:58:58       And you'll have a house by a lake. I don't have a house by a lake, but I had one come through my fucking rough three months ago. Sorry. All right, sir. Don't quit. That will crush me. No one that you quit. There's your halftime speech. Do not ever fucking give up on yourself. All right. What I would do if I was in your fucking situation. I would quit the corporate job first. I would, I would downsize my life.

Speaker 2:          00:59:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:59:28       All right. You got to make the sacrifices. Downsize your fucking life. Take a job that pays less with less hours. Live with less. Do you need all those fucking tee shirts? Do you need all that shit?

Speaker 2:          00:59:41       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:59:41       Do you need a laptop? Do you need an iPad to do you need a mini iPad? Do you need every new fucking cell phone yet? Don't you don't. How many fucking glasses can you drink out of at once? One baby toe. If you joined in a Frat, right? You drink out of one reality is sue. I'll eat one bowl. One plate, one fork, one knife, one spo. You know you could have all your shit. Yeah, you need a fucking, you need a bed. You need a to, you need a TV. You gotta see you gotta stay in touch, right? Cause you've got to see what's out there. What they're selling for 1995 but other, other than that, what do you, what do you mean

Speaker 2:          01:00:20       nothing?

Speaker 1:          01:00:23       You don't need shit. So downsides, you fucking life have a fucking yard sale, sir. And with that money, you know, go by whatever the fuck it is you need to buy to invent some shits you can get out of there. All right? But by all means, do not accept this as your faith. It isn't you just, you're doing your open mics like I did. And you know what? A lot of people fucking quit. I don't know what they're doing. Okay, but are they doing standup in a parking lot in an air condition tent, Rhode Island next month like I am? No, they are not. All right. You know what I'm saying? Man, I hope that that fucking pumped you up. Don't fucking quit or raw that don't make me sad. You want to make me sad? You fucking cunt. I don't even know you and you're making me sad. Stop it. All right. Smoking problems. Hey Bill. What's up? Nothing much. What's up? Yo Dope. Uh, my husband, yes, I'm a lady. Oh, I love when a woman writes in. Finally, maybe if I wasn't such a Dick Moore would write in my husband. Yes, I'm a lady introduced me to your podcast last year and we both think you're awesome. Well that's great. Uh, we've been together for nearly 17 years and have two young children together. I'm hoping that you can do something using your unique sense of humor and perspective that I um,

Speaker 1:          01:01:43       all right. Did I have been unable to do after years of nagging and that is to try and convince him to quit smoking. Uh, you know something. I don't consider that naggy. You're trying to save his fucking life.

Speaker 2:          01:01:58       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:01:58       All right. She says, I know you, you like to look after your health and he really respects what you have to say. I want them to be healthy, not just for his own sake, but so he's around for a long time for myself and the kids when we retire in 30 years or so, I want us to have health and money to travel the world and enjoy ourselves after a lifetime of working. Okay. Cigarettes are

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       incredibly expensive in Australia, around $20 a pack and are only set to get more expensive. This happens costs thousands every year. Thanks for your help. Bill. Please never stop doing it. You're doing, oh, that's nice. You're welcome. Um, oh, she says Australia next. Come to new castle just north of Sydney. Go Fuck Yourself. Uh, well listen, if I'm jumping on a 14 hour flight, you can't come one down, one fucking city south for me. Listen, next year I'm doing Perth to Sydney. All right. I guarantee it. Or else I'll go on youtube and I apologize. Like Paula Dane. Um, I, I'm sorry that are never came out to Australia. Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:03:03       Uh, all right. You guys sound like you're pretty young still, and that's just the thing. You think you've got to fucking live forever. And I'll tell you what I have learned now that I'm in my forties, unfortunately, is once you hit 40, it's no joke. All right? When you hit 40, whatever you've, whatever you've been doing.

Speaker 2:          01:03:24       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:03:25       Since you started being a knucklehead in your teenage years, starts to take, not even take root, it starts to blossom. It comes to fruition, if you will. All right? If you've kept yourself in shape,

Speaker 2:          01:03:39       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:03:39       And any Vieten healthy, you know, you go back to your high school reunion and people tell you how great you look. All right. If you've been eating like a fucking maniac and smoking and all that type of shit in your forties, unfortunately I've learned the hard way is when people start to die. You know, there's nothing funny about this shit. Look at, look at, uh, uh, James Gandolfini.

Speaker 2:          01:04:08       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:04:08       You know, that fucking guy was doing what I've done, but he was just doing it too much. You don't want we all doing over and indulging. Everybody does that. I mean, I shouldn't say this like I fucking know, but like,

Speaker 2:          01:04:23       okay,

Speaker 1:          01:04:24       you know, I've lost way too many fucking friends, way too many friends in the business and outside the business. I'm telling you when, you know, and this isn't to tell your husband to wait till these 40.

Speaker 2:          01:04:37       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:04:38       Uh, basically from what I've read is your body is designed to go 150 years. That's how great your body is. And that's how fucked up the environment is. And the amount of shit that you're going to encounter, that it has to start counting down to one 50 just so you can make it to 70 or 80. All right? And there's already enough shit, enough wear and tear enough crap. Forget about all the manmade radiation, fucking radio waves and all this shit. What the fuck we're putting in our food? There's already enough shit out there that can get you and you're just, you're basically, you're in the fast lane and you're gonna die. You are basically, you're going to die or you're going to have fucking emphysema. This is what got me to never fucking smoke. When I was in fifth grade, this guy came to the school and he said, if you want to know what it's like to have emphysema, he goes, make a fist. So you make a fist and you,

Speaker 4:          01:05:33       oh shit.

Speaker 1:          01:05:34       What did I just do there? Huh?

Speaker 4:          01:05:37       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:05:37       I turned down the fucking volume. Sorry about that. I just stepped on my mixer. Um, he basically said, he said, make a fist. All right, this is hilarious. This is what you're, tell your husband. Just say and this just say, hey honey, do me a favor. Make it like you're going to mind like you're sucking a dick.

Speaker 4:          01:06:03       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:06:03       that's what you do. You know what's funny is the amount of people who are in cubicles right now looking over their shoulder because they want to see the emphysema thing. Bring it right up to your mouth. Now that I did the Dick thing, every guy stopped. But they'll do it when they're home alone tonight. You know, they'll turn up the TV and bring down the curtains and we'll try. Basically you try to breathe into your fist,

Speaker 1:          01:06:22       try to draw it in through your mouth, through your fist. That's according to this guy what it was like to have emphysema and that's which that's what you're headed towards. I don't know if you guys have a daughter. I mean what if, what if you're not around to make sure she doesn't marry some Douche bag? What if the guy is a dick? But you're so frail at that fucking point cause you can't do a pull up anymore and you got that little fucking wheelie walker thing and you're coming in with the oxygen tank and the shit up you fucking nose.

Speaker 4:          01:06:48       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:06:48       You know, I'm telling you all of that shit. People start getting those a gin blossoms on their nose right around 40 all of it, all of it. Fucking comes, comes to a head at 40 but if you take care of yourself, if you keep yourself in shape in your twenties and your thirties and that type of thing, it it, it, it pays off fucking 10 fold and considering you have kids, man, you, you, you, you, you owe it to them, you owe it to them. All right? Jesus wasn't this just sort of a feel good podcast. You'd think I'd be more of a concept and my team lost.

Speaker 4:          01:07:24       Yeah.
