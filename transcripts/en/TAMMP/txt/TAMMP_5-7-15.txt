Speaker 1:          00:01          Hey, what's going on? It's build bar and a jet.

Speaker 2:          00:07          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:11          On a Thursday afternoon. What's going on? How White? I am a, as you're listening to this, I'm probably already on an airplane. [inaudible] fade you think is my aero plane.

Speaker 2:          00:25          Ooh.

Speaker 1:          00:28          Is that the fucking album that uh, the chili peppers, they don't like. I liked that album. I'm a little pee. I love this guys and the tree, I like it right until he goes, you're homophobic reggae leg kick. And then he just sounds like he should be beaten with his base. And I liked fleet, but that's one of the lines. I was with them right up until then. And then I was just kinda like, you know, fleet maybe just maybe, do you ever think maybe you're bringing it on yourself just a little bit. MMM. Anyways, so this is the Thursday afternoon podcasts. It's just a quickie, just a little half hour, just to half hour on payday. At least old school pay day, pay day. When I was a kid, I think before me, you know, all those people used to sell their own pants together. They used to get paid in like lambs and sheep and shit whenever, and then after them, then people got those little Buller caps, those fucking clockwork orange things.

Speaker 1:          01:28          And then they got paid on Fridays and then some point and moved to Thursday. And that's when all freckles came down the pike. Oh. I've looked on loads of trucks. Right. Next thing you know, I'm getting paid on a Thursday. So I assumed that that's the way it was going to be. Um, but unfortunately they moved it back to Friday. I don't fucking know why. I have no idea. God knows. God knows it wasn't for the working man right there where we just fuck it over to work in men, every guide, da Da. I don't know nothing about real wobbly. MMM.

And that's it. You just submit the, and you immediately know that you're out of line.

Speaker 1:          05:50          But if you're a sweetheart and he doesn't need to do that, the guy will treat you like a fucking king. So, um, please go down and check out that show if you can. All right enough with the horn it out. Let's get into what the fuck we want it. I want to talk about this week. All right. As I keep an eye on game. Three of the Canadians, Tampa Bay taping this on a Wednesday first period has ended Canadian zero lightning one huge game. Huge game. Does Tampa Bank put their foot right on the throat? Oh, those silly software and Montreal Canadians or Canadian crawl back into this series reaching back into time when they used to be successful to draw some inspiration. But to fuck the Iq. I don't have a dog in the fight. I'm actually enjoying. Um, I'm actually a join all the hockey that had been watching.

Speaker 1:          06:43          I can't even like watch a Canadians and hate him right now cause we're not even in the fucking when I'm in in it. So, um, I'm actually watching the game. I'll see PK do something. I go and I'll just inadvertently be like nice play. Like what am I doing? Um, so anyways, fuck the world of sports for a second. Let's get into the world of nothing that actually includes the world of sports today. So have a deadly, there was still investigating, um, the under inflated balls. Where would that game, the Patriots won like fucking nine years ago. Way Back in January. Do you remember that? Let me refresh your memory. They one 45 to seven okay. And at the end of the game, Jimmer say said, okay,

Speaker 1:          07:36          that's what he said. A grown man shed that at the end of the game, he had the nerve to say that we cheated a man who sits on the rules committee of the NFL and on numerous occasion has changed rules that were advantageous for rezone fucking team because he couldn't beat those patriots, right? New England, he did that fucking 10 years ago. They changed it. They were covering our receivers to horde. Him and Peyton manning made a fucking tape. They whined about that after the game. They whined about it during the super bowl. They whined about it at the fucking pro bowl, paid madding brought that shit up. And then at the draft they was still crying about it. And next thing you know, this is new fucking rule saying that all you can do as escort people down the fucking Goddamn turf. And next thing you know, all of Dan Marino's records are falling left and right.

Speaker 1:          08:29          And Lo and behold, the cults finally beat compatriots and when a God damn Superbowl, that's what old freckles here said. Wait a minute, why the fuck did they change that to have what kind of fucking pull does this guy have? One fucking owner complaints. They make a tape, they wind for a couple of months and all of a sudden the entire game of covering a receiver gets changed. Who sits on this rural committee and one name stuck out like that? Fucking Oliver Stone's movie who's sitting there dressed in drag with a powdered fucking wig talking to Joe Pesci with lipstick on his fucking lips. Ah, old gym. Or say this fucking jerk off is sitting here whining about the New England patriots. First of all, the ball. Okay. If they were under inflated, right? Like they're suggesting, I don't even know what they're saying because they keep going like Tom Brady. He could know he could possibly, there's no proof, but we think he might have done it.

Speaker 1:          09:27          Do you know how fast you would get laughed out of court if that was your opening argument? Yeah, you're on air on the night in question. We are, uh, we are proliferating that the defendant in the proximity over there that wasn't table could possibly have been involved in something that he didn't do but maybe know about. And we would like to press forward with this trial and waste more fucking time and money. Now granted, having absolutely no fucking proof what's so fucking ever whatsoever fucking ever has never stopped sports talk radio or ESPN from marching ahead. They'll be like, there's no proof. We can't say it. But having said that, yeah, if they'll sell stro one is this, say, what does, what does this say? Sorry thing turned out. What does it say about his legacy? What does this say above the game about competition? What does it say? What does this got to do? What does the sake of the children is how you do sports talk radio. And all they're doing is staring at the phone lines to try to get it lit up. And the more it doesn't light up, the bigger they go. What does it say, uh, about, uh, how we conduct our foreign affairs with Isis? I'm a, I'll be enough fuel if you can, if you can have a ball. That was his bills fully a floater.

Speaker 3:          10:56          Okay.

Speaker 1:          10:56          What's to say that Isis isn't right off little shore and a sub that they bought?

Speaker 3:          11:03          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          11:04          Awful. The Russians were second calls right now. One 800. Who gives a fuck here on Fox sports? West first caller, Michael from Indianapolis. Every dirty joke about Derek. Oh wait my pigs. I already knew about it. You'll do, you'll do like he knew about it and that. Oh whoa, whoa, whoa. Do you have any sort of football background beyond watching your pig fucking a chicken. Is there any sort of sports professional or, or possibly just down at the y? No, I played terribly wake up on time. I like playing corn hole and uh, you know, play horse shoes every once in a while we got Tom, you know, but you know, the banks were really trying to foreclose on my property here, so I don't know, man. I'm just Kinda mad my team whilst in or if there's any fucking excuse I can make six later I made shit.

Speaker 1:          11:54          I'll call it shit man. I'll throw some buck. I'm manure on that fire. I'll do it. Bucket. We're taking them all calls here. That's all they're going to fucking do. This absolutely fucking, there's nothing going on here. It's over. You know, I think know I want to tip my cap here that I'm not wearing to fucking Seattle for just saying, Hey, great game. You know we throw it to him. Malcolm Butler fucking jumped around and yeah, and you beat us. You know what? But you know what? We're going to come back next year and we're going to try to kick your fucking ass. So I hope you guys, you'll help you work out this weekend, this fucking off season. You know that's what a team of men does. Okay. That's what they do. But when you fucking owner is up there with the God damn wearing adult diapers and has a rattle, that's what they did.

Speaker 1:          12:38          Underinflated fucking ball. This is a funny thing too, cause they said, well, we noticed it by the half and then we had the fully inflated balls and we scored even more points and kicked their ass even worse. I don't, I got to tell you something, man. I don't know what, I don't know what the Patriots have done. I don't know what the fuck they did to these people. Okay. And it's really only two people. It's fucking gym or say, and it's fucking, what's his face there? Uh, Tony, uh, uh, main genie, man. Jeannie, who by the way, you notice is completely out of football. Completely out of fucking football. Did you see when he tried to commentate about it on ESPN, he sounded dumber than I did in this guy actually coached a team. Who the fuck would hire him as a head coach? That j e t s just jet jet's.

Speaker 1:          13:23          Um, anyways, you know, give me a fucking break. Okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. We want again. And by we, I mean the Patriots. I don't have a dog in this fucking fight, but um, have added all you guys on Twitter and all you people in sports bars. If you want to say what you say, I don't give a fuck. He's got the rings. If you want to whine about some underinflated fucking balls, if you want a bitch, I mean, you know what's the dumbest thing ever is that don't film the teams on the sidelines, but there's nothing to say. You can't do it up in the booth. There's no rule against that. I hope you guys realize that there isn't, as far as I know, as far as what I've overheard in sports bar series, and I remember when that shit was going on, I would did it.

Speaker 1:          14:07          I went to a football game in Georgia and I met somebody that used to play for one of the teams. I'm not saying Georgia, the other team not trying to get anybody in trouble and he laughed. He goes, do we used do that shit all the fucking time? I love what people just think like, oh, you got to do is just filmed somebody. You're going to win four Superbowls just under inflate the fucking ball. Do do you realize if that was a guaranteed victory, let's just say under inflating the ball in an AFC championship game or just in a professional football game in general would cause you to beat a better team? 45 to seven what the fuck do you think they would be doing every game? You know when the fucking coach, when he runs during halftime as he was sitting there talking to the reporter, you know, you know they always have the fucking, the little lady out there, coach, you know your dad by 17 points you haven't scarred.

Speaker 1:          15:02          You've punted every play that you didn't. You didn't turn the ball over. What would you like to do? And the second I have, well you know, we'd probably like to stop doing that Shit and put some points on the board. They're fucking cutie pie. All right. And in the meanwhile you'd hear in the background. Yeah, they would just be letting you know. I know we're going to do on the second half. We're going to go with, we're going to let a half a fucking cunt hair out of the ball and all of a sudden our fuck, we're going to beat these guys. We're going to score 45 points to this seven. Give me a fucking break. All right.

Speaker 4:          15:31          Okay.

Speaker 1:          15:31          Jesus Christ. You know, we can't really prove that, that, that he did it. Um, this Eric Walden coat cults, linebacker, I told TMZ that it's gross that Tom Brady would resort to cheating. He hasn't been there. There's nothing that proves that he did anything.

Speaker 4:          15:52          Okay.

Speaker 1:          15:53          Well, his report stated it was more probable.

Speaker 4:          15:57          Okay.

Speaker 1:          15:57          They're not that the Patriots quarterback was at least generally aware of the inappropriate activities do. This is the most vague horse shit ever. It's unfortunate that they did this, but there's still the chance. What a fucking good Lord. You got to give them credit. They did it and they got away with it and they won the Superbowl. It's this fucking Walden guy. Serious. You lost 45 to fucking seven. Wow. I, I can, I can I actually, uh, how about you guys? Can you guys, you guys who aren't colts fans or a patriots haters. Can you guys maybe a update the patriot, the colts logo two, I don't know. Maybe put like one of those little baby bonnets on it and a fucking rattle.

Speaker 4:          16:41          Okay.

Speaker 1:          16:41          Yeah, that's what it is. Everybody. Wow. They've been under under a deflating balls for the last 15 years and he finally got caught because Tom Brady is actually, he really is a six round pick. Any absolutely stinks. And all those throws that you saw make, you know what most of the people in the stand could make them if you just under inflated it just a little bit. It's incredible. It's absolutely incredible. And then, uh, Andrew luck who had the disadvantage of playing with the ball that weighed the same as every other ball he's ever thrown in his fucking professional career. You know, because it was the right weight that caused him to throw, pick sixes and incomplete passes and all of that. It's because of the weight of the ball. See a lot of people don't know that it really has nothing to do with athletic ability.

Speaker 1:          17:25          What it really has to do is what the ball ways and all you need to do is just take a little bit of air out of it and all of a sudden you'll beat the cult so bad that you actually beat Seattle. Isn't that incredible? That's what, that's the level of cheating that's going on here right now. In fact, what I'm going to do during my run of dates here is a, I'm going a little blood, a little bit of air out of the theater so people get a little lightheaded and I'll see him. They'll get a little high and I'll see me even funnier. Meanwhile, I'll secretly have, you know, pure oxygen going up my fucking nose. So what I'm going to do this weekend, you know, and then maybe someday, uh, Nick's comedy stop across the street. We'll investigate it. All right, let's get off this dumps subject.

Speaker 1:          18:14          By the way, I am playing the Wilbur theater. And what's great about that is, uh, doing this whole run of dates is my comedy career started right across the street on warrants and street. Nick's comedy stop March 2nd, 1992. Sorry about the phone there. 1992. And uh, to be right across streets. Pretty cool. I swear to God, if there was a show at Nick's comedy stop, you know that I can run over and do a quick five minutes, I'm going to try to do it. Um, but anyways, I want to thank everybody that's come out and uh, that's actually, you know, bottle these tickets and everything. It's really insane. And I'm, Oh, I'm coming with a poster. Oh, you know, I am and I'm bringing my fucking a game. It'd be nice to be around some patriots fans who actually fucking, there's, I can't say the only patriots fans, cause there's so many sports fans that I know just sitting there going, dude, this is fucking ridiculous.

Speaker 1:          19:04          But I know people hate the Patriots, so they'll try to say that's why they won. Yeah. So all you guys out in the West who can't beat Seattle these last two years, what you want to do is right before you play him, deflate the ball a little bit in the first half when 45 to seven against an incredible opponent and then somehow you'll beat Seattle. That's all you have to do. And then you to, you will have a ring. And I want to commend the colts for, uh, you know, for never cheating on any level, no gamesmanship whatsoever. They've always been on the up and up over there and, uh, you know, I'm surprised they don't have those little girl scouts sashes going across them. I mean, they just sell on the up and up and wholesome Indianapolis, Indiana, Indiana in general. What it, what a great state, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          19:51          Still keeping the clan alive despite the fact that they are up north. I mean, that's, that's, that's a special kind of hatred. Um, all right. Anyways, you know, one of the cool things about traveling and meeting other people is, uh, is, uh, just, I dunno, I, I grabbed like newspapers and shit like that. I got to find this fucking thing. I was sitting there reading like, you know, I'm one of these fucking liberal comes out here. I'm not really, I thought it was liberal til I moved out here, but I'm, I'm sort of a, uh, no, j law had, I'm not going to say when he calls himself because I don't want get them in trouble, but like liberal is in there. But it's actually a funny way he defines himself. But, um, I don't, I'm one of those guys where I said, you know, I call people cons, but you know, I'm also interested in having chickens in my backyard, you know, growing my own food, right?

Speaker 1:          20:44          I don't fucking know. I Like v eight engines, but I also drive a, I'm a fucking Weirdo, man. I'm all over. I'm all over the fucking map. Um, so anyways, so I saw this thing says mother hen raising backyard chickens teaches life lessons. And this was at the Hamburg journal and I can't remember if I got this. And, Oh, I got in Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, uh, where I had the great time or the seersucker suit had a awesome fucking show and they really treated us right out there. So I'm reading this thing and this woman, this lady, she did what I did. She watched one of these, uh, you are what you weed or fucking food inc and you know, basically bought into it the way I did where I saw, I was like, Holy Shit, I got to make sure I go down to a farmers Ma.

Speaker 5:          21:27          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          21:29          And um, get myself, you know, some shit that doesn't have a little bit of cancer spray on it, which I get, I mean, I kind of get with it do when you got to feed 7 billion people, I mean, you've got to take out some bug spray. It's just how it works. But I'm trying to lessen the bug spray. So I did that maybe for about three days and it was, it was really hard. It was really hard. And I quit. You know, you know, like a lot of these women who consider themselves feminists like, oh my God, I'm a feminist. No, no. You know what you really did? Life was hard and you quit and now you're looking for a scapegoat. I'm not saying all of them, but I'm talking about the bottom feeders. You know the ones I'm talking about, right? The ones that want the world to buy him a drink and then give them the credit.

Speaker 1:          22:08          Those ones, you know, the ones who don't think that, they just think being a guy is easy and you don't have to work for anything. You just walk in and gum drops fall from the fucking ceiling. Oh, you got a dick. What dream would you like to have come true today? Right. Anyways, so this woman actually was like, she went the whole fucking, which she actually planted a garden. Granted she had a fucking yard. Um, she planted a garden but still raised all, you know, raised all this, grew all his fucking food. The kids loved it and all that. So then at one point she's just like, all right, fuck it. I'm going to get chickens and uh, you know, the chickens lay the eggs and they started selling to the neighbors and all that type of shit. And here's something I did not realize because I actually was thinking like, you know, facts.

Speaker 1:          22:51          He had the space or something. I'd love to have some fucking chickens running around a goddamn goat. You know, you fucking bend over to pick up the morning paper. He comes in and you across the yard and exhale your flock and wrestling with it. Huh? Sweeping. It's four legs and having a great time. Little farm action in the city. Um, this is something I didn't know is that chickens after a while can't lay any more eggs. Right? Like they went through menopause or something. Sorry ladies. I'm just, you know, whatever. I'm, I'm, you know, I never took any of those fucking biology classes help me out here. So, um, anyways, their kids love the chickens and everything. So what happens is, is once the chicken can't lay eggs anymore, that's when you gotta make a decision. What am I going to do with this fucking thing?

Speaker 1:          23:38          Right. Does it come and TV sit next to me and asked me for the fucking collect or do I take this thing up? Um, so let me just read a little, as she said, she goes, this is the middle of this story. She said, uh, my daughter does her part too. It's her job to pick through the leftovers and food scraps and tossed them out to the chickens. Soon after I signed her that jobs, the chicken learned to come running whenever they saw because they knew she had something for them. Uh, but blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. She wants to treat them as pets though I Warner that chickens are for making food first eggs and then one day meet because hen stop laying at some point and I'm not running a chicken retirement home. This is so refreshing to read because I would never read this in La. This person would get tarred and feathered.

Speaker 1:          24:25          This woman's like you that pets, they're fucking food. Make me some goddamn eggs. And when they'd done, I'm lobbing your fucking head off and where it happens, where I'm a chicken dinner. So anyways, she goes, I've only had to kill one chicken from me before too. I killed because they were suffering from in injuries. And it was kinder. Uh, that chicken was death beak. That's what she named him. So named by my husband because she was jet black with BD red eyes and look like trouble from the get go, uh, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Let me get to this stuff. Um, so anyways, she could've paid. So anyway, so the moment of truth comes, it's fucking, thing's not laying any more eggs and she's got to take it out. Right. She's got to stick an ice pick in the back of his head. I thought I'd never shut up. Um, so she goes, I could have hired a guy to do it for me for five bucks. All right. But that roll around your fucking head for a second. There's somebody in Lexington, Kentucky who's five bucks a head, just goes array, makes five bucks to kill a chicken every day. You know what I mean? That's like when that's in Kentucky, that's like an Uber driver.

Speaker 1:          25:33          Your work. I work whenever I want. You know, I just fucking turn on the APP and they tell me to come out and go kill a couple of chicken. Five, 10, 15, 23rd, I'm at one day I made a horror and $27. I've got a $2 tip and I ain't telling you for what, but I'll tell you right now, I still rub one out to it. Um, so anyways, she goes, I could have hired a guy to do it for me for five bucks. She goes, but I'm not squeamish. So I decided to do it myself. The kind of thing that made this country great, right? You Get up, you put your pants on one leg at a time, you go out and you murdered somebody else that's in the way. You don't hire somebody else to do your dirty work. Right. Uh, my grandfather left.

Speaker 1:          26:15          My grandmother laughed yourself sick when I confessed that I had learned how to do the deed, basically killed the chicken from an ultra ultra crunchy youtube video called respectful chicken harvest. And yes, we will have a link. Um, but it did, uh, it did at least show me the ropes. When I announced to that death peak was about to meet her doom. The kids were appalled for about a hot minute. Then they remembered how mean she was and weren't so sad after that. This isn't fucking regular publication. They insisted on sticking around to watch when I wasn't trying to avoid getting clawed in the face by a chicken's death throes. I watched the kids faces to basically, when she's holding this fucker down lopping it's God damn head off or choking it out, whatever she's doing, passing its guard. As far as I can tell, she's occasionally glancing over at a kid. So this is like some fucking, uh, what's that show about? The castle and the little cunty kid runs it and he puts people to death.

Speaker 4:          27:14          Okay.

Speaker 1:          27:14          Ah, fuck. What's it called? Lord of the flies. Lies gimme back my crown.

Speaker 4:          27:21          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          27:21          Duty. You're watching. Are you watching Lord of the Rinat Lord of the rings. What does it call come on and everybody fucking loves that show. Uganda and Queen, I can't remember what it's called. I want to watch it medieval times. You don't what it is. It's on fucking cable. They're there. They're in their last scene, right? There's a dragon or some shit, I think. Anyways. Uh, she thought,

Speaker 4:          27:43          okay,

Speaker 1:          27:43          can't, he's got the, the little fellow there, Fox, all the women crushing it. Full head of hair. He's got that fucking Eddie Rabbitt beard. I love a rainy night. Who Do? Ooh. Why do I keep thinking Lord of the Rings? I can't get it out of my head. Fuck. All right. Anyways, she said, I asked her if she wanted to stop eating meat.

Speaker 1:          28:10          Oh, wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Sorry. I missed this thing. I looked at the kids' faces. I could see how deeply it affected my daughter in particular. Yes. You fucking murderer in this chicken. Uh, she had never seen an animal die before. She never saw you kill one either. I could see the awareness of mortality, mortality, shadowing across her face. She cried at bedtime and said she hated that death beak had to die. All right. The death die. Got to give it a more sympathetic name. I asked her if she wanted to stop eating meat because all meat comes from animals who must die for us to eat. She thought carefully and said she's still wanting to eat meat, so we lay there late into the night and talked about the food chain and informed choices. My son was far more practical about it when I interviewed him for this story, he shrugged and said, Eh, at first I was sad, but then I was okay because that was some good chicken and dumplings. So you're right there. Isn't that great. That's why you travel around. I swear to God, man, if anybody out here in Hollywood,

Speaker 4:          29:10          yeah,

Speaker 1:          29:11          fucking ever did that with a chicken, held the fucking thing down. It's it's fucking leg fucking freaking out and you got your kids watching it. You probably get arrested, at least down here in Los Angeles. You get a little bit north to Bakersfield in between San Francisco and Los Angeles, Reagan country where they're growing the food and they're actually dealing with the fucking drought as opposed to the conch down here, myself included.

Speaker 4:          29:38          Okay.

Speaker 1:          29:39          Trying to take a shower. Can, can we get Fiji water polo into our in shower? Um, anyways, I just thought that that was interesting. Like just to read it. And um, do you think you could do it? Huh? Did you get killed a chicken? I could fucking kill a chicken. I just take out a meat cleaver. I would, you got to get like those fucking psycho gloves. Like I'm picking up something crazy that could scratch me.

Speaker 1:          30:09          You just got fucking boom Bam really quick. I would think. You know what? I'm going to watch that fucking video anyways. Whatever the fuck do you want from me? You know, I was just checking in on me. I had a great day today. Everybody, I took the, I'm getting ready to get my pilot's license here and I, today I had the written examination, the one I've been studying for, for like the last month, 600 questions of which they snagged 60. And, uh, you know, you got to get a 70 or better, you know, sounds a little bit easier than it is, but there's all kinds of math and charts and all this fucking density altitude, that fucking wind correction angle and all of this shit. And you know me. Okay? You guys have heard me read out loud, read out loud, read out loud right there, right there.

Speaker 1:          30:50          You know how hard I was struggling with this shit. So I studied, you know, for the last couple of weeks. And uh, even on the bus tour, I'd go in the back of the bus and I would just go, I gotta I gotta put my two hours in and I took it today and obviously I passed or I wouldn't have fucking brought it up. So I'm psyched. Although the couple things, I got an 85, I wanted to get the 90. I got an 85 and I fucked up a couple of those. I'm not good at that. Uh, you know, taking out the little fucking slide rule and graph and shit. I, I, you know, I just blew it off. It was on my computer screen. I'm like, yeah, I wouldn't have lasted me like one or two of those. And it was like fucking three of them.

Speaker 4:          31:25          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          31:25          Um, anyway, so I passed that. So the next thing I got to do is I gotta I gotta talk to uh, one of the representatives from the FAA and he grills me for an hour and if I pass that then I go out and fly and that happens on the same day. And if I do that Bing Bang, boom, I got it. So that's what the fuck I'm up to after my show. So that's what I'll be doing during the day when I'm in Boston. You can eat the food. No, I'll be studying my fucking ass off and saying the shit out loud. So it sounds like I know what I'm talking about. You know what I mean? Um, as opposed to being like, ah, yeah. Um, wait, that's a translational lift when the coming out of a horror, I don't sound like a fucking moron. I just want to be like

Speaker 1:          32:11          you. What kills me is when I'm taking this thing is they have so many students from China. They opened up something over there where I guess they wouldn't let people fly. Now anybody, not anybody, but you know, way more people can do it. And they had an overflow of people in their schools couldn't handle it. So these kids flight all the way over to Los Angeles and in a second language, not only learn how to fly a helicopter, but sit down across from some hard nosed person from the FAA that's going to put you in the air if you don't pass the test. They do this in a second language. And every time I see him, like I just feel like such a pussy. I'm just like, could I go to chuck? Can I go to Beijing? Right. You know what I mean? Not Hong Kong where they actually speak English, you know, a lot. Um, can I go into mainland China?

Speaker 6:          32:57          Okay.

Speaker 1:          32:58          And fucking learn how to fly a helicopter. He fucking unreal. You know, the instructors are amazing. I was like, some of them can't even speak English that well. I'm like, so

Speaker 6:          33:08          okay,

Speaker 1:          33:09          if they can't understand you, like how do you communicate? And this one guy goes, they understand tone. It fucking killed me because I know God damn well if I was in China and the fucking dude's talking to me, I can understand them and all of a sudden he goes, I know. It'd be like, Hey, you got controls buddy. Well, the terrifying thing is it's like, I know I'm doing something wrong, but what?

Speaker 6:          33:39          Fuck,

Speaker 1:          33:42          you'd have to immediately learn. No, stop.

Speaker 1:          33:46          Oh my God. What the fuck does the first four express? If I was learning how to fly a helicopter in China, those are the first four things that I would learn how they say that. And if anybody who's speaks Chinese could tell me, spell it out phonetically, I would love to learn it. I would love to fucking learn it. Just, I don't know for what it'll, it'll come up at some point. At some point you're going to need to say that. Right? Um, you know, next time you're in China or fucking Chinese food, it's taken a while.

Speaker 6:          34:16          Okay.

Speaker 1:          34:16          He'd be like, oh my God, what the fuck?

Speaker 1:          34:20          After you just ordered an English, you could hit them with that and Chinese, they can't tell me not getting a laugh there. Anyways. All right. Um, before I get Outta here, uh, Bombas socks, everybody chances or if you have some fucking feed you like to wear, nice saw half socks and face it, it says, chances are if you have feet, sorry, I want a little Johnny Mathis there and face it. Socks haven't changed since they were invented. They fall down, they wear out and they always, and there's always that toe scene that's never in the right place. Our new fucking spots of Bombus has changed. All of that. Bob has dedicated two years to engineering socks engineer's socks said, stay up and last forever and feel amazing on your feet. I have a pair of bombers and you know what? They feel great. You know, I like to do, I like to wiggle my toes in them.

Speaker 6:          35:13          Okay.

Speaker 1:          35:13          Going off of that and a Goodfellas, ah, CIBC. I do that when I put on my bombs in the shower, if my feet all wet, the prima cotton they use is so soft. It's amazing to know what I'm talking about. You really need to try a pair for yourself. Come on, man. You put on a pair of socks, you feel like a winner. You got a spring in your step. You'll have a smile on your when you get fired. I don't care. I'm going to click my heels as I walk out of here grabbing Mog deck. But listen, Bob has doesn't stop with your comfort with every pair of socks. Bomba sells. A pair is donated to someone in need because socks is, it turns out and the number one requested item at homeless shelters. So I helped us it some over to India after that earthquake.

Speaker 1:          35:56          Speaking of which, I'm doing a benefit tonight. Hang on one second. Right now for all, and for a limited time, Bombas is offering my listeners 20% off their first order and free shipping. Just go to [inaudible] dot com slash burr all lowercases do it now. Do it now for 20% off the most comfortable socks on the planet. And a pair for someone in need. Go to [inaudible] dot com slash bar that's bombas.com B o m B a s.com/burr or you know, they could pick up somebody homeless here. I think a lot of times we're always thinking about people in other countries, but you know what, I had such a great time and a Mumbai, India and uh, you know, it was awful to see what happened over there as always. So a Judd Apatow put together a benefit tonight at Largo and a actually by the time you hear this is going to be over, but, uh, it's sold out.

Speaker 1:          36:45          We made a bunch of money. You know, we made some money. I can't say a bunch of money, the amount of money that's going to take to fix that, but uh, I had a great time and they really treated me right over there and met a bunch of great comics. So, uh, it's good to be able to do something. All right. That is it. That's the podcast for this week, not the podcast for this week. I'm just checking in on you. All right guys. Have a nice fucking weekend. You can't, Eh, uh, here's a little throwback from back in the day. Back when I was like,

Speaker 4:          37:13          cool, younger, smarter, had a little more flows on top of mind. I don't know.

Speaker 1:          38:06          You know what? This podcast fucking sucks. I'm going to call it out before you guys. This is a podcast is just sucked this week. All right. I'm all over the fucking place. I'm fucking exhausted. It's a Goddamn holiday weekend. You can you guys, everybody, how hard are you working this week? You know, has it, somebody's gone come in and brought a pie in. Somebody is wearing an awful brown and orange Thanksgiving sweater. You know, maybe it's your manager to show that he has a human side, you know, he's not the worst when you hate your boss. And then around the holidays, all of a sudden he just lets up a little bit and tries to act nice, you know? Or it's a female. She gets a little bit nicer and you know, and the whole time she's sitting there wishing you a happy thanksgiving. You just want to fucking kicker right in the box.

Speaker 7:          38:50          You know, but you can't you fucking chance.

Speaker 6:          38:54          Okay,

Speaker 1:          38:56          well that was sad. What the fuck is it? It's one to one 1515 minutes left in the third period. You don't, one of the hardest things to do I think is to be an announcer for hockey now that they took, I've taken out the red line, the fucking game you breaking next, sitting there watching the fucking game. That's why I like it. Watching it on TVs cause I don't have to keep turning my head. The camera, it's a camera

Speaker 7:          39:17          moves for me. It does all the work. What I'm literally out of Shit to say, you know, I feel like

Speaker 1:          39:23          right now this how bad this podcast is when you bomb is a comedian is that works. When, when, when shit is going great, when everything is saying is killing, when you're on stage, basically what happens is, is you've done about 20 minutes of material and you look down at your watch and you watch says you've been up there for 55 minutes. That's when you know that you're fucking killing. And conversely, when you're bombing, you will do an hour's worth of material and 17 minutes and all you have left is your closing bit. And you look down at your watch and you realize that you've been on stage for just under 20 minutes and you're like, wow, now what the fuck am I doing? You know your mouth gets dry. That's when you start going into the crowd.

Speaker 7:          40:07          Hey Z. You know, so what's there to do around here and a Raleigh, North Carolina. Huh? Look at this guy over here. Huh? What do you do sir?

Speaker 6:          40:18          Okay.

Speaker 7:          40:18          Oh, you're a plumber. Really? Oh, so a, I bet your butt crack is always show a fucking kill me. You know, and you just, you just fucked. Hey, how about a round of applause for the wait staff? You know, keep it going for him. You know, and I just want to thank all you guys for showing up. I know it's a recession and I appreciate, uh, you know how bad I am for the tropes. You know, you know, whether you support going to war or not, you know, these kids are out there that laying down their lives and they're away from their families in thanksgivings this week. I think we should all sit back and give thanks and be appreciative of that. I've already done an hours worth of fucking jokes and you conserve and left in anything. So now I'm technically in overtime even though contractually I already, I owe you like another 40 minutes of fucking comedy,

Speaker 6:          41:08          you know,

Speaker 7:          41:09          and let's not forget all the people who have died in boating accidents this year. You know, a lot of people don't know that boating accidents is one of the leading, leading causes of death when human beings are out in the ocean.

Speaker 6:          41:23          Okay.

Speaker 1:          41:26          Start remembering jokes from the early party or act and you start telling him, you know,

Speaker 7:          41:32          yeah, they did a study

Speaker 6:          41:34          the other day. They said, you know, 90% of shark attacks actually happened in shallow water. No Shit. That's where the people are. It's called the fucking beach. Oh, one of their people swimming to Europe. Let's go to France. You pussies. Ah, you like that joke. That's a joke for my act in 2001 I'm do fucking old jokes in my act. What else did I used to fucking do? Okay,

Speaker 7:          41:59          I already did one of my original jokes. You guys see these uh, rap group. Criss Cross. What would up Chris? Warm it up, Chris. Hey, go to bed. Chris. What do you like nine years old. Oh. Oh my God. I had horrible jokes. He's do jokes about working in a dental office. A people. I got news for you. Six years. Neglect is not cured by a tic tac in the waiting room. Hey. Ah, you guys ready for your next deck? Too Bad. I still got another 30 minutes to do.

Speaker 6:          42:35          Yeah,

Speaker 7:          42:36          ladies back me up. Guys are crazy rise. I mean, you know, where are we? We don't give a shit that's going to be searching for shit to say what, but I'm here. It's great to be here in Raleigh. You know what I mean?

Speaker 6:          42:56          Okay.

Speaker 7:          42:56          It's scary. You know, you come out here to Raleigh, you know they got a, he got a mall. All right folks, I'm not gonna lie to you. I'm out of jokes. I wish you could just do that and just fucking become honest. I'm a, I'm not a fucking material. I don't know what the fuck you guys want.

Speaker 6:          43:24          I've actually been talking about this shit on stage. I don't give a fuck luck

Speaker 7:          43:29          because it's such a topical bit. I don't even know if people are gonna think it's funny in a month. But, uh, can we please talk about fucking Bill O'reilly going on the view? Um, I gotta I gotta tell you something right now. I don't like that guy's politics. I don't like his face. He has, he has that racist face. You know his, when he gets mad, his fucking, his face gets pointy. He just looks evil. He's just not a pleasant human being whatsoever. But I gotta tell you, he fucking destroyed on the view, you know, and I, somewhere in there was a victory for men because he took on for fucking women. They were all yelling and he got two of them to walk off their own fucking show. How do you do that?

Speaker 7:          44:29          I as a comedian, I was embarrassed to, to stand up. Comic comics just quit, which is why I'm nominating Joy Bay Har and Whoopi Goldberg is Douche bags of the week. What, what did you think was going to, do you think he was going to go? No, wait, don't leave. That's exactly what the fuck he wanted you to do. I was actually hoping at that point that the other two women were going to leave and then he could just start hosting the O'Reilly factor on the view. That would have been, he just totally 100% dominated at the very least, that segment, because I don't, I don't watch that fucking show, but just, he just came on. First of all, he sits down and he's got on that shiny fucking, uh, Joe Pesci shoot Joe Pesci Peshy suit. It's difficult to say Joe Peshy suit and he's got his fucking leg spread like a with his ball bag, hang his shiny ball bag.

Speaker 7:          45:26          He locally, if you ever see like, uh, when Kennedy debated Nixon, how, if you listen to it on the radio, how everybody said Nixon won. But if you watched it on TV, Nixon was all tanned up. He had his legs crossed, he looked like a winter and Nixon sat there with his fucking legs splayed and cross like underneath the chair. He looked like a fucking moron. That's what bill O'Reilly looked like. And he, he just, he still dominated. I love when he turned to joy and was just whatever I, I'm paraphrasing here, but he was just like, be quiet and learned that she had nothing, a fucking standup comic. She had nothing. The whole segment was fucking hilarious. And when he goes, uh, another gem of a moment was when he goes, you know, a lot of people don't realize this, but 70% of Americans don't want a mosque at ground zero.

Speaker 7:          46:23          And joy goes. She goes, well, I'd like to see that, that poll or something like, and as she sang that the crowd is applauding what bill O'Reilly just said. So you really don't need to see the pole at that point. And, and getting beyond that, what he really should have said was 70% of Americans don't realize that they're not building a mosque at ground zero still, that they're actually making a rec room with a ping pong table and an area to pray kind of like they have an area to pray it every fucking airport, you know, three, four blocks up the street at a God damn coat factory is where it's actually being built. But the fact that he said that they're still building a mosque and that he got an applause break, joy is so wrapped up into her own fucking opinion that she doesn't even hear her own studio audience backup the guy that she's trying to shit on.

Speaker 7:          47:18          And the fact that this fucking guy is still putting out inaccurate information, that people are still back in Abbott. It just was fucking awesome on all of those levels. And a, I liked how Barbara Walters was old school. Cool. And she didn't walk off. She gave those two Douche bags of the week shit for walking off their own show. And then she got him with a nice little classy Zinger. He said, Bill O'reilly's on here this week. Uh, when we come back we're going to talk, um, or he's on the show today. We're going to, when we come back, he's going to talk about his new book called pinheads and Patriots. And then she looked at bill and she goes, at this point I, uh, I'm not sure what you are or something like that. It was a great little zinger, but she wasn't like judging the guy.

Speaker 7:          48:06          I Dunno. The, the whole thing was funny and just how bill O'Reilly is, is, is viewed as this intolerant person. And then he comes on the show of a, I guess mostly liberals and then they show absolutely no tolerance for him and then throw a fucking temper tantrum and walk off their own God damn show. I mean, you can't tell me. Everybody over at at Fox News wasn't literally jerking off to that moment. I, Bill O'reilly Bomas became a fucking rock star in that moment. That was, that was like a standup comic moment that he did to two comedians, which blew my mind.

Speaker 4:          48:41          Okay.

Speaker 7:          48:42          You know, and I know I'm always trashing the brides on this show, but that really was a chick way of handling, losing an argument. Like, I'm just going to get off up in store, Ma. He is so used to people paying for your drinks and holding the Goddamn door for you. You actually thought that as an adult that you were just going to walk off the shell and this was going to be this big moment and he was going to be like, oh, wait a minute, let me stop.

Speaker 4:          49:11          Okay.

Speaker 7:          49:12          I loved it. He was like, go ahead and leave. I don't give a fuck. I'll continue. I'll take over your fucking show. Um, so anyways, there you go. Douche bags of the week. Joe Bay Harbor and Whoopi Goldberg for walking off your own fucking show when his shiny suit fucking I, I can't say he's a moron because he, he does. No, I mean, I look, he, he, he's very red up

Speaker 7:          49:44          on that. Yeah. I don't know. I am too stupid. This is why I would, this is right here. Why I would never engage as much as I disagree with his opinions. I don't fucking pay attention to politics at all. I don't, I find it frustrating. I find it to be it just a rig fucking gay. I don't give a fuck, you know, and I, so I would never try to, as much as I disagree with Bill O'reilly, I would never go on his show and try to fucking one up the guy and think I'm going to, uh, beat the guy in an argument about politics. It's like he, he's paying attention to these politicians the way I give a fuck about football. I'm not gonna, I'm not going to win that argument. I mean, why don't I bring fucking Roy Jones Jr and start debating him in about boxing.
