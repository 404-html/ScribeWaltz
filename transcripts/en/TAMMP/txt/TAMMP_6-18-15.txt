Speaker 1:          00:03          Hey, how are you? It's bill burr on a Thursday afternoon and

Speaker 2:          00:09          yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:12          I'm just checking in on your hair on a Thursday afternoon, Monday morning podcast just before Friday just to see how your week's going. Quick little 30 minute, you know, just opening the door, sticking my head in. See now you're doing everything okay. Everything okay over there and your cubicle. Maybe you drive home. Huh? You got your hands 10 and two on the fucking wheel like you supposed to.

Speaker 1:          00:35          Driving like a fucking nervous Nelly. Who is, have you ever been comfortable in a car when someone who had their hands 10 and two on the fucking wheel or whatever, nine and three whatever you supposed to do and now six 30 and fucking 1123 whatever the latest thing is. New Studies have shown about the way the collarbone, Rachel's the shelter. Well, the most affective lane and all of the Stanley. I was actually at nine 20 say, shut the fuck up, right? We sit a zillion dollars on that study. You know not to get going about that. Fucking James Worthy again, fucking driving off the road. They're female, James Worthy, right? So, uh,

Speaker 1:          01:14          anyways, I'm out here. I am in a, I'm in Portland, Oregon. I'm going to say, well, have you ever been fucking comfortable? Have you ever been fucking comfortable with so much sitting there with you when you're riding in a car? All that says is I am brand new at driving, or I am lost, or I am currently being abducted and being forced to drive this car. That's what having your hands get fucking tenant to system me as a passenger by see somebody up there, you know, they fucking lean to the, you know, leaning on the door, even if it's unlocked, I don't give a shit that drive like two fingers. I'm like, all right, this person, he or she, you know, they got this. I see somebody fucking, you know, tended to when then you start moving your head towards the windshield, forget it. It's fucking over.

Speaker 1:          01:57          Um, that's like, is that a media, you know, I just have one of the greatest cab drivers I've ever had. Now being up here in Portland, Oregon at the beginning of my, uh, my tour here as fu, basically Oregon, um, California. Um, it's mostly California and Oregon, by the way. Not Oregon. All right? They don't like that up here. They don't like that. They don't like deodorant, right? They don't like not dressing like you're on little house on the prairie is all kinds of things that they don't like up here, but they, they liked their food fresh. They like to keep it weird or whatever the hell they doing up here. If they're keeping it weird with a fucking Chase Manhattan Bank right downtown. Oh, they're keeping it weird out here in Portland. Is that a men's warehouse? God, it, this place is weird. Corporations will always eat your way in.

Speaker 1:          02:55          I swear to God, everybody joined a fucking cult and left civilization within fucking 20 minutes. These corporate clients would figure it out and they'd figured out how to get a fucking a cult look at best buy in there. They disguise it, right? They make this sign, the color, a corn and grass sprinkled little fucking, you know, sprays out like Pachulia Isam, Shit. They'd figure out how to do it. But anyways, they had this great, uh, cab driver, um, and the way from the airport over to the hotel, you know, he's talking, he had a thick accent. So I asked him where he was from and he was Armenian and he was from Russia. So, uh, I always, you know, anybody could speak a different language. Um, I'm fascinated by, so I just start talking to the guy and somehow we started talking about cursing and our own languages and this guy was fucking hilarious.

Speaker 1:          03:46          Like he was talking to him, he said, he's like, oh shit, it's more, it's more like, I said, how do you say, go fuck yourself. He goes, what does the, it's not like you say, go fuck yourself, and he was a good America. It's all about fuck fucking and everything. You know, fuck you. Fuck you, go fuck yourself. What the fuck is that? He was saying all that shit where he says in Russia it's more like, do I sound like Yakov Smirnoff in an Asha? Um, it's more, um, like they act, they don't say go fuck yourself. They say go sit on deck.

Speaker 1:          04:21          Which I like, that sounds very rushing. Go sit on Dick. I must break. You have to sit on Dick. Right? Then they have another one a instead of say, what the fuck is that? Their translation is, what kind of deck is this? Like basically, you know, I know I'm getting fucked. What's going down here? And they don't, they don't call anybody a motherfucker or, and they don't say, go fuck your mother. They will say fuck his mother. But it basically means it's not like saying, you know, somebody goes and has sex with his mother. What it really means is fuck his mother for doing such a horrible job raising this fucking asshole that we all have to deal with, which I think is actually a little more intellectual then have fuck your mother. You know, like imagine somebody banging your mom. I mean, that's definitely disgusting.

Speaker 1:          05:12          But to say, fuck his mother, like because she did such a horrific job, you know, fuck your mother for raising you. It's such a horrible way, that net, we're now having this conversation or you're doing this to me. I thought that was one of my favorites that I've heard. Uh, that was one of my favorites. Um, so anyways, I am up here and he had all these fucking, he was fascinating like, well, just to listen to him talking like he grew up in Russia, so he's not into the whole democracy thing. Like he, I was like, well, do you think what to free over here? And he was like, yeah, I can't do his accent. He basically said we were too free and that there's fucking chaos over here. And he started, he goes the other day and he's here in Portland. He goes, they see this, this man 28 years old and he's dressed like a five year old child and the 1920s, you know, he's like, this man is not a leader of this man's not a head of a household.

Speaker 1:          06:06          And I'm dying, laughing, going, I'm going, you mean hipsters? And he's like, yeah. And he was just saying how the kid was, was not fit to run anything to run the country to be in a business or when it was the one of the funniest fucking takes. I've heard on hipsters, you know, not saying it was right, but just his perception of it. And he said that coming from where he came from, he likes having a king. You know that someone has the balls. Jesus do you know, to lead people. And he actually liked George W. Bush. She said he wasn't the smartest guys, but he had balls. He was like, fuck you, I'm doing this. Which I couldn't argue. I was not a fan of George W. Bush, but I always had to respect the fact that that guy did not give a shit. He's not on. Now we're going to do it. Getting there. We can fight tear. It's like, dude, you really don't, uh, I don't know. You don't really have an exit strategy. I don't give a fuck. I'm fucking going in there. Right. Um,

Speaker 3:          06:59          okay.

Speaker 1:          07:00          But anyways, this guy was actually into a having a king and all of that type of shit and that it just, I don't know, fucking blew my mind listening to that. I've never heard anybody saying, you know what, we're to free. It's really weird and I don't want to do that. I probably shouldn't have said that. He was, it was actually Armenian living in Russia. I don't want to fucking get everybody all going again. You know about the whole fucking USA Russia thing. Did that end than the and already or does it start back up again? I don't fucking know. All I know is I'm important Portland, Oregon, and I'm, you know, this morning I had a hole, I had a screw up with my itinerary. I thought I was going to lax at like fucking, you know, one o'clock in the afternoon and it turned out I was flying out of Burbank at nine 30. I discovered this. It's 757 in the morning about ready to do the Thursday afternoon podcast here. And uh,

Speaker 3:          07:54          okay.

Speaker 1:          07:55          So I fucking, that's why I don't have a microphone cause I threw all my podcast shit and I forgot to put the microphone in. So I apologize for the bad quality. I'm going to try to stop off at a good task.

Speaker 3:          08:06          Okay.

Speaker 1:          08:06          And buy one. If I can find a local mom and pop music store, I would do that. I just tried to find one within walking distance and it was close for good, it said so. But anyways, so, um, even with that driving over to Burbank and fucking rushing through the airport and everything, I'm beyond excited to, uh, to go on this tour and it made me Amy site, you know, then I, you know, if you have a shit day and you're still excited to go to work, you, you, you're doing the right job I think. Anyways, but, um, so anyways, what the fuck am I rambling? A buff.

Speaker 3:          08:40          Okay.

Speaker 1:          08:41          I Dunno. I'm a

Speaker 3:          08:43          okay.

Speaker 1:          08:45          What the fuck is with my brain tape? My brain is all over the place. What they, I want to talk about Donald Trump. There we go. I don't have my list in front of you and you've got a couple of subjects to keep me rolling here. Um, did you guys see Donald Trump talking about how that he wanted to, when he's going to run for a run for office here, president, the United States. How fucking stupid was that announcement? The way he drew it out like everyone was going to be excited. So I am announcing my candidacy for the president of the United States or mistake. We got it Donald. We got it. We got it. Okay, we understand. All right, you're going to be running like this is like a good thing. I've seen guys like this run my entire life, these guys who were just like, oh I got a ton of fucking money and I'm just going to go in there and it's like, no dude, you're going to get the shit kicked out of you.

Speaker 1:          09:37          You're going to get the shit kicked out of you because you're going to be going up a venture, a bunch of guys Smiley's that are already bought and paid for and those are the guys that are going to get in. But just listening to him talk, like he went on the O'Reilly factor and Bill O'reilly's going like, how are you going to stop isis? Which of course is always the big question in this country. How are we going to stop isis? Fuck these people that you know are fucking with our food supply right here in the United States. Fuck these people that are, you know, want a private taze wider. Yeah. Those guys aren't that big a threat. Let's go after these clients all the way over here, right. That are bankrupting us. So anyways, sorry for the politics. So right. This is just my own ignorant point of view.

Speaker 1:          10:17          All right. And I finally found someone of some dumber than me, which is fucking Donald Trump. So they ask him was, he goes, so how are you going to get him? He goes, I would hit them so hard. It would egos. I would find the right general, I would find my patent or Eisenhower and I would hit them so hard. It would make your head spin. Right. He just sounds like somebody at a bar. Like, I hope he hangs in there long enough or get a good six months side of this shit. Right? And they, so bill O'Reilly's going like, so you're going to send in ground troops and he, is that what you're telling me? And Donald Goes, I'm not going to tell you what I'm going to do. I got to keep it a secret. Right. Which I'm like, Eh, it wasn't a bad answer and that he, O'Reilly keeps pressing him. He goes, so eat. So you're going to, but some point you'd have to send in ground troops, right? You will be sending in ground troops and it finally just caves. He goes, no, I wouldn't. And then a writer was like, well, what would you do? He goes, I bombed the hell out of him.

Speaker 1:          11:11          I got to tell you something. Once again, Donald Trump has proven that you have to be literally out of your fucking mind to either want to be president, run for president, anything at all for him to just so just casually, just Sam, I'm going to bomb the hell out of them. You know? I would think that that would be like, even if you knew that that's what she had to do, that, that that's a hell of a fucking thing to have to say. You know, cause you know, not all of those bombs are going to land on the people you're trying to hit someone we're going to land on some mother feeding a baby in the end that's going to be on your conscience for the rest of your fucking life, even if it was the right thing to fucking do. So you, you try to like, I dunno, I guess choose your words more carefully or maybe it's refreshing that he just had bombed the hell out of him. You know, he should literally just been stuff on a sandwich in his fucking mouth as he's taught, not Fucko. I kick the shit out of him. I didn't really know fucking balls, just speaking in like, just total generality. I mean, he sounded like he was doing a podcast. He didn't, you know, he sounded like me.

Speaker 4:          12:18          MMM.

Speaker 1:          12:19          I Dunno. But you know, he did all right in the hair plug department. Remember when he was doing that? Psycho fucking flock of sea gulls comb over that he was doing that thing has disappeared. Let's give it up to the people who make hair plugs. They're really doing a hell of a job. You know, they started off horrifically

Speaker 4:          12:37          mmm.

Speaker 1:          12:39          Or whatever. The hair transplant. I think Elton John got like the first one. He's been wearing wigs ever since. Like his top of his head looked like Bobby. Yours. Nice. By the time they were done with it. And um, so now you said the where that little pageboy haircut. Yeah. For the rest of the time, you know, poor fella, all he wanted was hair. You know, now he's got to have that little little fucking, yeah, we're gone. Just goes a little stubby fucking fingers trying to reach those keys. Got a little fat, you know. So a lot to feel bad about when you look it out. John, poor guy, you know, they're a little too much coke, right? One on one on MTV unplugged, a little coked up in a very unfortunate fucking a running suit. Why am I talking about him? Oh, let's get back to Donald Trump case. So the 90s right. Then they went with the fucking ant leg. Once you remember though at the insect like ones where you just couldn't stop looking at it, it was literally like sewn into your fucking head. People used to call it doll hair.

Speaker 4:          13:43          MMM.

Speaker 1:          13:45          And now they've gotten to the point where they just sort of, they sort of sprinkle it in. I think they take it off the back, the vacuum mount out of the back and then they put it on a tray and then like a fairy comes by and just takes the tray and skips around your head going Chareau la La. And they drop it in and it looks very natural evidently. But then what happens is, is those ones I guess can survive whatever hell is going on beneath the scalp. But the other ones that weren't built for it, they still fall out. So then you got it. You got to think you've got to get receipted again.

Speaker 4:          14:18          I Dunno,

Speaker 1:          14:19          I'm still holding out for the fucking pill until then. I'm going to keep buzzing my head. That'd be fucking hilarious. It's like eight years. They come out with a pill, right to cure baldness and all of a sudden guys like me, we come back from for the fucking Mr Clean look to come back looking like we're in the bgs. Right. Ah, that'd be fucking hilarious. I would actually be willing to take the risk on that one, which is really fucked up cause you know that it would do some sort of unbelievable damage to your liver. There's no, there's no fucking way. I mean, you fucker with Mother Nature, aren't you? I mean you can't. That's the fucked up thing about plastic surgery and everything is your really, your, your face, your hairline becomes a lie. You know, if you're young enough, especially, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          15:11          And people looking at you like, and they are attracted to who you aren't. You don't what I mean? Like what if it's the nose that just gets the person go and then that's not your real nose. Then you bang and you have a kid. You're like, what the fuck happened to that kid's nose? Did you cheat on me? Hey [inaudible] your fucking whore. And then she takes out a fucking high school year book was like, no, this is what I really look like. You know? And every time your kid starts walking towards you, what? That's crooked nose. You can be thinking like fucking bitch lied to me, you know, which will affect your child rearing. One of the weirdest fucking words ever. It's just, I don't know. Was that before they realize that pedophiles existed, that somebody came up with a, what's a good word for raising your child? I Dunno. Rearing. Um, anyways. Oh, in the world of Sports, Sports, Sports, sports, sport, congratulations to the Chicago Blackhawks and the, uh, golden state or Sacramento is, I call them golden state warriors on their championships. A opposite things. There. One

Speaker 1:          16:22          was a so called dynasty, which it isn't, which it isn't. All right. And then the other was the, uh, a team that hadn't won in like a 37 years. Is that what they said? I should know this Celtics one in 74 and 76. So the warriors one in 75, 40 fucking years. 41 seasons maybe. Is that what it, is that how it works out? I don't fucking know. Um, oh, basketballs hard. By the way. 74 was the Celtics. 75 was a warrior is 76 was a Celtics. 77 was Portland. 78 was the bullets. 79 was Seattle supersonics with the young Dennis Johnson. Rest his soul. 1980 was the Lakers. 81 was the Celtics. 82

Speaker 1:          17:14          it was the Lakers. 83 was the 70 sixers. 84 was the Celtics. 85 was the Lakers. All that when killed when Kareem sank that Skyhawk any, any fucking, you know, he did that double fist thing as he was running down the court and they were going to beat the Celtics and there and they were going to drink champagne in the Boston garden, which had never been done. Uh Oh my God, that was brutal. 86 was a Celtics. 87 80 it was the Lakers ain't no weight. 87 was Lakers. Then it went back to back and then Detroit went back to back and then it was the Michael Jordan shelf for three years and then Houston for two. Then Jordan for three and then the spurs and I think fucking Lakers, one three. I don't fucking remember. Anyways, sorry. Got sidetracked there. By the way, Black Hawks, you don't have a fucking dynasty.

Speaker 1:          18:05          Okay. How much more lax or are we going to get with the term dynasty? When I was a kid, when I was a lad, when I had a full eto, orange hair, um, a dynasty was winning three in a row. The early seventies. Oakland ace was a dynasty, the late seventies, Montreal Canadians, the early eighties islanders was a dynasty. All right. I'm trying to think. Nobody is ever, but the Steelers when in four and six years, that was considered a dynasty too. So I dunno then I'm remember when the Patriots won that we won three and four years and people will go, well, it's a dynasty because of the salary cap and the boob tube. And I still didn't buy into that, but, and so then three and four years became a dynasty when you had to win three in a row or four at a six to now, just three and four. And now 10 years after that.

Speaker 1:          19:01          Now if you win three and six years, you're considered a dynasty, which is so fucking stupid. All right? And I'll tell you why, because the kings have one two times. So they want to, when the Black Hawks have three, I mean the dynasty is you have 1:00 AM all three years in a row and everybody else has got a fucking goose egg. That's how I look at it. All right? I'm just a freckled old man here though. I still believe that. I'm not trying to take anything away from the Blackhawks, what they've done with the free agency and all that, you know, without a doubt. It's fucking amazing. And I love the Blackhawks, even though they fucking crushed me. If he'd couple of years ago when they beat the Bruins. All right? But you know, come on, three and six fucking years. Why don't you just, what? When we get to the point of, hey, you're one three, that's a fucking dynasty.

Speaker 1:          19:51          It isn't not a dynasty. All right? You got something going on called you got to, you got a horrible case of the every others. All right? You want it in 2010 on Oh yeah. Every others is the giants. Baseball giants. They wanted 10 12 and 14 isn't that what they did? Yeah, they got a horrible case of the every others. All right. Which can only be cured by when in fucking three in a row and shutting jackasses like me. Right. The fuck up. All right. But I don't think, I don't think three and six years as a dynasty, even with free agency and all of that fucking horse shit. I don't, I think he got to win. You got to win three in a row or we'll give you the asterix three and four years. Or if he won four and six years, like the Steelers, I'll give it to you, but three and six years when someone else want to like now what happens if the fucking kings when it next year and then they want three, right. And then is it overlapping dynasties

Speaker 5:          20:48          that occurred at the same fucking time? You see what I'm saying? This is like that movie faceoff well you don't know who's nick cage and who's John Travolta at that point. You can't have that. All right. And who else want during that time? The fucking Bro. That's right. The Boston Bruins won a Stanley Cup. You know what I love about them winning the Stanley Cup? Is everyone in Boston just about except for newborn babies knows what it's feel. Feels like. Dab your team, win a Stanley Cup in. Meanwhile, up in Montreal, despite all of this success, there's an entire generation and a half has no fucking idea what that's like and that I swear to God makes me smile every day. Um, I'm fucking with you. Montreal. He a bunch of sensitive conch. All right. I like your language and I'm going to learn how to fucking, I'm gonna go and do a lingo.

Speaker 5:          21:42          Maybe I'll fuck with that over the next couple, a couple of hours before my show up here in Portland, Oregon. Jesus. Bill, can you tell us a little bit more about your tour? Well, I would love to, after I read out loud with these, with the following message, this fucking Internet would work. Here we go. All right. All right. Right out of the bat. This sounds fucking creepy to me. Video Doorbell. Uh, we'll insert dinging sound. What does that mean? I was supposed to fucking insert ding. Dongs. All right, let's do it again. Uh, I can do this. Here we go. Doorbell.

Speaker 4:          22:21          Yeah.

I'll see if I can do this correctly. All right. Hey everybody. Video Doorbell. Let's do that again. Oh, I'm at and all kinds of layers to the podcast here. Hang on a second. It's got a fucking, uh, it's gotta reload here. Hey everybody. I'd like to take a little bit of time to talk about, yeah, video doorbell. What is really odd? I was the shit video doorbell. This is the sound of a package being delivered or friends coming over for dinner. But it's also the sound of summing plants. Someone planning to rob you blind. Jesus Christ. I took a left turn then it over 90, 95% of home breakins happened during the day and I write the way. Is it, what's going on here? Oh, I think I'm stuck in one of those youtube loops where they just keep playing the fucking the doorbell. Well, I think it works with the copy. I'm going to keep it anyways, and burglars always almost always start by ringing the doorbell to see if someone's home before pillaging your possessions.

Speaker 5:          23:42          I guess that's a fancier doorbell. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          23:45          I like this

Speaker 5:          23:46          music too with ring video doorbell. You can see and talk to anyone from anywhere in the world using your smartphone. Hi, I'm bill per, what's happening? It's just a DJ party.

Speaker 5:          24:09          okay. I think we're having a fire alert here. Back to the copy rings. Advanced motion detection alerts you, even if someone doesn't ring the doorbell, it's like a caller id for your home. You know, millions of people suffer every year and they don't have a video doorbell. Please share a personal story how this could help you or someone you love. Hey, will you share a pocket person's story? You content isn't enough. I'm reading your copy. I don't know anybody who has a video of fucking doorbells. How does that work for you? Then she's story. You look at another one, I'm sorry.

I'll tell you what will happen, Huh? Bunch of drugs will be taken. Um, how much can I freak out people that one of those rapes, if you just had the DJ and he's clean, all this mellow shit, then all of a sudden out of nowhere I just started coming out with a mouse head screaming Khan to over and over again.

Speaker 4:          26:19          Okay.

Speaker 5:          26:20          I would love to have an overhead shot of that, you know, maybe using one of those drones and just watching them all scatter like fucking roaches all across the desert. Stepping on side. Winders um, anyways, what else did I want to talk about? Oh, an ant, ant man, Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam. I got my truck back. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          26:44          I got my fucking truck back. Sorry. Sorry for the big intro there. Um, my truck a, I had some fucking issues with it and I finally just decided to have him pull the engine and Redo the whole fucking thing. It runs on unleaded gas. I don't have to do any additive anymore and it's running a fucking like a bastard. You in Boston there, it's running fucking strong as shit. And um, we ordered the air conditioning and the power steering. It's going to be my fucking daily driver because right now I don't know if you've ever fucking tried to turn the wheel when there's no power steering, you do that. And like a fucking 83 toilets herself, which is the last one I ever drove that didn't have power steering. Um, that's a bitch. This fucking f 100. I'm literally out of breath and when I try to parallel park and then the anxiety, you have somebody behind me, it takes like fucking, I swear to God it takes me like seven minutes to park the fucking thing.

Speaker 1:          27:32          So, um, I was going to be one of those purists where I was like, I'm going to keep it the way it was when it rolled off the assembly line in 1968 and then I just realized like, you know what? It was meant to be on a farm. It's now in Los Angeles. Okay. I already added, um, you know, put some disc brakes on the front. I am a guide and make this thing safe. I fucking love it though, man. I got to tell you the suspension that was fucked up. You go over a bump on that thing, you know, it's like, it just starts rocking. And you know, if you don't have your seat belt on, you literally hit your head. And I was talking to, um, the guy worked on my truck about possibly putting in an updated suspension and he was saying, well, I'd have to lower it like two or three inches.

Speaker 1:          28:14          And I, I, I fucking hate that man. I don't like those trucks that are lower down, man. I, I like, I like it that it rides up a little high. Um, so I'm willing, I only have three gears on in any way. So how fast am I going to be driving? So I think, um, I think I'm done messing with it, but, uh, I got a couple more things I have to get done on it. I don't have my direction most right now, but once I get the power steering and then the air conditioning, I think gold daddy is going to move on to trying to find a 65 galaxy that's a, got a straight body and everything else is fucked up on it. And, uh, and I'm actually going to get that thing with automatic transmission. I was thinking about having a, a, a stick in it. I've always liked driving a standard. I just think it's cool man. You feel like you're driving the fucking car, you know?

Speaker 4:          29:05          Okay.

Speaker 1:          29:05          I Dunno. I'm just sad, grumpy go. I'm not dumb. Just like grumpy old man. Like now the cars are going to drive themselves. It's like why the fuck would you want to do that?

Speaker 1:          29:15          And then you know what? You don't, what's going to happen? Everybody's going to be on their fucking iPhones and reading and stuff. And Are you going to see going down the street is people hanging their heads out of these cars in the drive to they're not driving puking out decide cause everybody's car sick. That'll be the next thing that somebody will sell for 1995. It will be like these fucking, you know, one size fits all curtains that you can fucking wrap all the way around the inside your car so you can read while it's driving and not get sick or fucking jerk off of our have sex with somebody.

Speaker 5:          29:47          Right. What the fuck do you care? You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          29:52          You know what's funny about that is the, the liability that the automakers will somehow get off of themselves. It'll somehow still be your fucking fault. And the insurance companies still won't pay you when the car that was supposed to drive by itself just stops working. Dude. How many times a week does your, does your laptop crash?

Speaker 1:          30:14          How good are these computers are going to be that I'm just going to just get in this fucking thing that has no conductor, no pilot, no nothing. I'm just sitting in this fucking thing. The cars going 40 miles an hour and so's my brain in my skull physics. It's going as fast as the car and when the car smashes into the tree, that's what my brain does to the front of my skull and goes back again. And then what happens? Huh? What happens? Like a good neighbor? I go fuck yourself. That's what, that's what the insurance covers companies

Speaker 5:          30:45          will do. Um, I'm not into that at all, man. I am into, my phone is ringing here. The fuck is this. Well, I don't know who that is because you don't have a phone. No Id. I don't pick up. Um, I'm actually bullshit and I'll pick it up after this. Uh, what's this podcast is over. So anyways, um, I'm so fucking excited to do this guide down tour. I'm going to so many cities that have never been to before. I've been to Portland before a bunch of times. Actually back in the day I used to work Harvey's um, comedy club and a, and the last time I was here I worked helium. Um, I did a bunch of colleges up here before he used to do cuse bay, like every other year I would go down there, um, and after I do Portland and I just, I just blow all the way through fucking California and all these places.

Speaker 5:          31:36          I never been to Sacramento. I've been there before. I'm there on the 19th, and I go to Reno, which had been there before. I'm going to go to bizarre guitar and gunshop. Um, and then I'm back to California and I play Santa Rosa. Never been there doing two shows there. And according to the people, that's the last place George Carlin performed at before. Unfortunately he passed away. Well I'm doing one show, sorry, one show that um, on June 21st, so that's going to be a, an unbelievable night. Then on the 20 seconds I'm in San Jose. Then when Fresno never been to Fresno at the Warners theater though, I said the warriors theater, I was like that, that's a cool fucking name. Uh, then I'm in Bakersfield. Never been there. I've driven through it. He stopped and got gas, never fucking hung out there. And then I'm in a Highland California on the 25th for two shows, Denim in Vegas at the Mirage.

Speaker 5:          32:27          And then I'm in Tucson. I mean it's just going to be a fucking awesome talk at a really bad ass poster. Once again, kind of making fun of the drought out here. I too actually retweeted a copy of it. Um, and, um, I'm just really looking forward to this, getting this fucking hour up to speed so I can murder with it, you know, cause, uh, this time last year I, I taped, uh, I'm sorry you feel that way. So Marty, uh, the clock is ticking. Sometime next year I will tape another special and um, it's what I plan on doing for the rest of my career because a, I don't know why I still love doing this shit 23 years in. I should not be excited to be going to Fresno and Bakersfield, but I am because I've traveled enough to know that I'm going to meet some people out there and they're going to tell me some places to eat, like people make fun of Reno and then you go there.

Speaker 5:          33:17          And that bizarre guitar and gunshot thing just fucking blew me away. And that's only one thing that I saw there. And then I drove over to the, what's that fucking lakes that's over there? You know, where Michael Coler Corleone had frayed a whacked, I went over there and got a great burger. Was it Lake Tahoe? Um, I'm really fascinated with that part of the country and, um, I know that I said I was going to do Eureka in and end up falling through, but I'm definitely going to come back up. I might even just come up for the day and fly my lovely wife up. And um, then I was thinking and drive him back down, checking out the redwood forest, going to maybe wine country is some shit like that. Um, but uh, you know, it's a beautiful state. Fortunately there's not a lot of water out here, but uh, you know, who knows, it might fall into the ocean.

Speaker 5:          34:03          One day I might be on the road and I won't die with the state and I can tell people when I got older, I remember I tore down whole stack and kids will sit there wide eyed is, I described places like Fresno and San Jose, Sacramento, right. Taking all of them for granted. I could tell him that I went there, I went there and I went to the FDF fucking uh, uh, what is that fucking Mexican restaurant at a Mcdonald's zones. You know, they got the burrito bowls, so was trying to pick something mainstream and not do the usual Wendy's and Mcdonald's. I Love Mcdonald's is now freaking out. If they're actually using real meat. It's like, really, what the fuck were you using before? They'll never answer that question. Um, all right. This was the Thursday afternoon podcast just before Monday, just before Friday. Sorry, the judge [inaudible] podcast.

Speaker 5:          34:54          I want to thank all you guys for listening. Um, there's gonna be another 30 minutes here. It's some throwbacks to some classic Horse Shit that I talked way back in the day. Um, thank you to everybody before even do this tour. Everybody who shows up, um, I can't fucking wait and I'm, and I'm working with Joe Barton. Nick, I never did a bus tour with Joe Voir. Nick, um, one of my favorite people on stage and off. We're going to have a great time and a hey, as weak as we roll through your cities and stuff, let us know some cool places to get dinner or lunch, a good place to go grab a drink or something. Um, or whatever. If you've got something weird that we got to go see, like I know in Tucson, Arizona, I want to visit that, that, that, uh, airplane graveyard that they have.

Speaker 5:          35:39          I got a fucking hit that, um, I want to see some crazy shit like that. I don't want to go to some fucking malls or Cineplex horseshit that I can do in my own town. So tell me something unique, something fucking weird. If you know a bartender with the fucked up by or a weird way of clearing his throat, just something unique about where you live, please let us know and we'll try to hit as many as we can. All right. That's it. Have a great weekend. And uh, that's it. Yeah. Have a good weekend. Your constant,

Speaker 7:          36:05          let's see.

Speaker 7:          36:22          I'll get some advice. Somebody wants a bill. My girlfriend looks like a centerfold. Good for you. She's blind. She has a beautiful face, a tiny waist and giant cans. I have outdone myself. What, what the fuck, man, don't sell yourself short. Maybe you're, maybe you're a, you're a stud. So he says, however, having a girlfriend of such caliber, as you might imagine, comes with its share of problems. Ooh, Jesus. Here we go. Like, uh, like your good self. I battle my battle, keeping my temper under control at times and particularly struggle when my girlfriend and I go out in public together. In short, the amount of male attention she gets is ridiculous and at times it's infuriating. Have you ever found you found yourself out with a girl and notice that every man within a three mile radius from the sweaty 22 year old walking boner to the porky, sexually frustrated father of three is blatantly staring at her tits in her ass?

Speaker 7:          37:25          Um, I've always been of the opinion that if a girl is obviously with a guy, whether you know him or not, it's a gentleman's code not to have a staring contest with their, with her, with their ring piece. I don't know what that means. What does that look into her pussy? I have no idea. This guys from Australia. Um, if a girl there's alone or with girlfriends, sure. Objectify the shit out of her. But I think if a girl is holding hands with their boyfriend and you make it obvious that your helmet is pressing against the inside of your front Zipper, then you're a cunt. Um, nothing serious has happened yet, but the weather is getting warmer. The outfits are getting smaller and I'm concerned I'm going to wind up with, I'm going to wind up with some perverts blood and quite possibly come on my hands all for now. Um, all right. All right. This is a tricky situation, sir. You know, it's a very tricky situation. You know, there's a price you pay for everything. All right? You're the one who, who has the center fold fucking girlfriend with a great ass, nice set of fucking tits and a, you just, you just have to,

Speaker 6:          38:40          okay,

Speaker 7:          38:41          this, this, this is, this is how I look at this shit.

Speaker 7:          38:46          As long as you're, a woman isn't going around trying to get attention if she's just fucking standing there and she's so goddamn stunning that men are looking at her, but you know, she's not, oh, I dropped my lipstick and then slowly bending over at the waist while looking over her shoulder. Um, if she's doing that, I can tell you right now a banger another couple of times and then fucking dumper because she's going to be an absolute fucking nightmare. And a, you don't need that in your life. Okay. But if she's just a stunning league, gorgeous woman, um, you, that kind of comes with it. And, uh, if you lose your fucking temper and you start acting like a maniac, that's a great way to eventually annoy the shit out of her. And because she can't help it. Like I said, if she's not trying to get attention, she can't help it, that she's gorgeous. And, uh, if you then, it's in this weird way, you're giving her shit for being herself, which is not fun for anybody, and then you're going to have a problem. So.

Speaker 6:          39:54          Okay.

Speaker 7:          39:55          Um, I don't know how to it. You know what it's like. It's like a, it's like when I whore myself out at the end of my shows and I sell DVDs. All right? I don't have to do that, but I choose to do it and I'm standing as a choice. I fucking made. And then I stand there and what's going to happen? I answered this. Yeah. This is one of these podcasts questions. All right. Eventually somebody is going to come up and they're going to fucking insult me. He's telling me they didn't like my act. Tell me. Uh, they didn't think I was as funny as when he saw me on TV and I can't get mad because it's my fucking fault for standing there like an asshole. Just, you know, I, I put myself on the Dunkin stool and I got to admit, sir, if, if you're, if this, if your girl is the way that you describe her, you just have to accept that it's, it's par for the course and, uh, just give yourself a little halftime speech before you go out. You know, I'm not going to lose my shit. Um, but

Speaker 7:          40:51          if it is overt, uh, that has to be a way that you can fucking address it without pissing her off, without you. And you also don't want to get into a fucking fight. Um, I dunno. Just say, hey buddy, can, can you limit it to like, you know, five second shifts of staring at her tea and I can't say tits.

Speaker 6:          41:14          Okay.

Speaker 7:          41:16          I don't know what you do too. That's, that's a rough one. That's a rough run. The man that takes me back to being a,

Speaker 6:          41:22          okay.

Speaker 7:          41:23          Jesus Christ. I was like 21 years old. I went on this, I went out on a date with this girl who was well out of my fucking league just because I didn't have the confidence to fucking be with her, you know, I mean, um, beautiful girl. And I went out with her and I noticed she just kept looking around the restaurant to see who was looking at her. And I remembered it annoyed the shit out of me, but I, I didn't have any experience with beautiful women, so I just sort of accepted it. And, um, but I never went out with her again. It just, it drove it. I, it, I tapped out somewhere through the fucking dinner. Even back then I was an angry son of a bitch. I was like, let me get this straight. I'm buying you fucking dinner and you're looking around to see who's Elsa staring at your tits. Um, yeah, you're a cunt. Good looking cunt. But uh, nonetheless, someday those looks are going to be gone and I'm just going to be left with the cunt. You know who's going to be a psycho cunt because you're an attention whore and when the attention goes away, you're going to be like some celebrity who fell off the fucking math, fucked his bitch. Fuck this. You know? And that was the end. [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          42:29          Shit. That's probably cases fucking all right.

Speaker 7:          42:53          Question out there about, you know, things that happen within society, especially, this is something that I think a lot of white people need because not because we're more racist than anybody else, we just get just the, the consequences of us fucking up is so much harsher than other people because, you know, we are the gold standard when it comes to racist. We are in the driver's seat right now. We have been in the driver's seat for awhile, basically beating that. If we are ignorant ass holes, it has way more effect than when other people are. You know, back in the day when other people were running shit. That's the thing. Whoever's on top, if you thinking ignorant, uh, that's what, that's why, you know, if you're on top and you're thinking ignorant shit, you have to be called on it because, uh, just cause he cause the effect that you can have. You know what I mean?

Speaker 3:          43:49          Okay.

Speaker 7:          43:49          Like if somebody from Bangladesh fucking hates me, that's such a stupid example. Okay. That, that's not a race of people. I don't even know what Bangladesh's and I gotta be honest with you. I don't even know if that's a city or a country. Bangladesh have ever seen that on the prices, right?

Speaker 7:          44:08          Yeah. I want to showcase showdown with selling yet a Bangladesh and some white trash person like myself to sit with a confused look on their face. Like yeah, I don't know where that is. Is that where the terrorists are? I don't want to go there. Whatever, like a Filipino people fucking hate me. That doesn't affect my life. It doesn't, I'm not going to go and do a job interview at, at Walmart is not run by Filipinos. So you know what I mean? You know, not saying there's anything wrong with Filipinos. All right. See, we'll see what I have to do with there's white person. They'll say, I'm saying I do bad about Filipino because we clear hair. I, I've never had issues. I've got to have a valve of Catherine. I'll fucking all that shit. You got to go to the Jerry Lewis voice there lady.

Speaker 7:          44:50          Um, so yeah, people have questions. So here we go. And I think all racist should shy men. The questions that you have, if you have feelings about a different race of people and you just think about, you're thinking something funny, there's nothing malicious, but is this offensive? Is it racist? This is, this is the new topic. Okay. And if you feel that I answered these questions like the ignorant white man that I am, uh, call me out on it. I'm here. So here we go. This first one, Bill, is it racist to call Indians, Dibble Dab. And I'm talking about the Asian ones, not native Americans, I'm guessing by Dib and Dab as you mean Dubai Dhabi or Dubai. October to move it the, but you're saying like that debit Dabu um, is it racist? Probably, but it's fucking funny. So that knocks it down a little bit.

Speaker 7:          45:44          This is what I feel that makes something like racist. It's like, like the reason why, uh, that one isn't as offensive is because we haven't, we never enslaved them. That's the reason why white and black should, is so sensitive is because of the shift that we did to him. But we haven't really fuck with those people. You know? So if the black version of that was, is it, is it offensive to black people? Hey man, mother fucker or whatever. Yes. That would be offensive if you did some sort of mocking of the way they spoke. Yes. That would be, that would be offensive if some CEO was giving a speech and I was driving, uh, actually I was having someone else drive my town car and we drove by a group of a y'all mother fuckers and uh, they proceeded to walk towards the gas. You'd have to apologize. So I guess, yeah, I guess technically Duma Dabo like that would be, that would be offensive. Is it racist?

Speaker 7:          46:49          Um, this is what I, I really, I really, it's hard for me to say because it had, it's what's in your heart, you know, cause I make fuck I really, I make fun of, of everybody, you know, I mean, I play a game out here, uh, when someone is make, let me ask you, I've got a question for you. Is this racist? I have a game out here when I ride around with Nia and she does not approve of this to keep her in the clear, she does not approve this. When somebody makes a more ronic move in front of me, you know, driving, you know, just makes a fucking horrific move. I play a game called old or Asian and you have to guess why cause I'm going to pass the person cause I got to see what they look like. You know, whenever somebody does something fucked up, some committees do a great joke about that.

Speaker 7:          47:39          You just want to see what the fuck they look like. Right. Uh, that's the game. Older Asian. So as I speed up my little hybrid to try to pull parallel to them, I always say, what do you say, Nia? What are you going with all the regime? What do you got? Older Asian. She goes, I'm not playing this game. That's mean. And then I was going, I'm going to go with the old and then I pull up, oh it's fucking Asian, you know? Or Oh I nailed it. It was an old guy. So, um, is that racist? I'm sure it's offensive, but within the context of my own car, you know, I'm not yelling at anybody and I got to admit, you know, there's a lot of truth in the fucking game, not Jesus. I'm going to have to apologize next week on the podcast. So I would say that, uh, uh, Indian people, why don't you chime in? I would say that, yeah, that they would find that they would find that offensive. Um, is it racist? Let me see if I can use it in a sentence here. Hey, uh, you know, I called up customer service, said, uh, you know, one of those blue bird dog was answered and tried to tell me that his name was Steve and act like he was in Kentucky. But I, I know that he was actually an India, cause what he talked, he was going Dubak Dabo Woods, how can I help you? Um,

Speaker 7:          48:58          is it racist? Probably. You know what, something bad has to happen between white culture and uh, or, or western culture in Indians. So, you know what I mean? It's like a, it's like you're playing a team and there's no rivalry

Speaker 7:          49:18          like patriots versus jets. This year was like a whites and blacks. It was bad. It was a lot of hate, you know, but like patriots verse, like the Fucking Lions, you know? Yeah. And there's gotta be some shit targets. It's knocked out, but it still hurts if somebody says something mean. I don't, I really don't. What the fuck I'm talking about? All right, let's move to the next one. The next one on the new controversial topic on the Monday morning podcast. Is it racist? All right, here we go. Um, Bill, I had an interesting experience today apparently involving me as a racist. I was walking with two of my coworkers who are both black. Oh, Jesus. Here we go. Um, we were going to go get some lunch. One of my coworkers who are most of friends with, uh, did a little high five fist bump shuffle with one of the female sex security guards at the front desk.

Speaker 7:          50:22          Knowing both of them and how they interact with one another. I kind of made a passing comment to the tune of, man, you guys in your handshakes while obviously laughing, laughing while obviously laughing at just how choreographed it was in more or less picturing them in a studio or something, working out the logistics to get the fucking handshake. Perfect. Anyways, we all laughed and moved on and we got our lunch. All right, so nothing wrong yet. So you're cool with these people. You made a joke and everybody laughed. No problems, no problems so far. Um, however, after coming back through, secure back through security, I noticed the security guard stopped me and Kinda had a scowl on her face. I thought she was mad at me for something, but it turned out she was mad at this other lady who was black because she overheard my comment and was telling, uh, that security guard that she couldn't believe I had the nerve to say something like that.

Speaker 7:          51:27          And I should be ashamed also to the point where she could, um, almost to the point where she could actually go complain to the human resource people because she was offended, um, et cetera without even considering that. Maybe just maybe I was talking about the security guard and my coworker and not all black people now. It being corporate America in all I'm sure rather than even face the pos possibility of any bad press, they'd rather just sweep me out the door and completely ruined my re any reputation I may or may not hold at the company just to save their own assets. I feel I did nothing wrong and they had no intentions of ever doing anything wrong. Anything wrong, I'm not going to go on and on about how I kiss black babies and trying to rehabilitate inner city schools because I don't, but I'm certainly not some corn fed rebel flag waving ignorant product of what might be incest.

Speaker 7:          52:23          I guess my question is do we really have to walk on eggshells when we are just making casual conversation that just any that just any cunt can pick apart, select the context that they might think it is in and then start crying foul. Basically. I would have liked to call that woman a cunt and told her to go fuck herself. But let's just say I was already kind of worried about my job. All right, let's see. Um, yeah, I think this is, this is the classic one where you were fucking around. The other two people knew you were fucking around, but they're one person decides to get offended and then you have to go on TV and apologize. Which personally I think is the wrong move because when you apologize now it's like you're, you're admitting that you meant it in a bad way. I mean the apology, I would do that and say, look, you know, I'm sorry that you didn't understand that I was joking, but I'm not going to sit here and apologize like I have any, any sort of ill will come in way, you know, but I, but just to avoid the problem in the future, uh, white people do not use the expression you guys or you people when talking about black people, that's just it.

Speaker 7:          53:40          It's just not going to, you're, you're setting yourself up for someone to get offended. And, um, there's a weird sort of a push pull going on with that whole, uh, you guys and you people thing where, um,

Speaker 7:          53:57          with somebody white says that there becomes this concern of, um, that you're separating. You're separating like, yeah, you know, you people over there with how you live your lives and where over here, black people have that weird relationship with white people where they're like, you know, can you stop stealing our fucking music and our culture? And, but then like, if something, you know, hey, let's pave the streets, you know, well, make sure you do it in our neighborhood. We're all in this together, right. All of us together. You know what I mean? So that's that weird sort of fucking push pull thing going on. So yeah, just avoid, uh, avoid the whole fucking, um, yeah, you fucked up. You didn't fuck up, but you, you left yourself open for a sucker punched by saying you guys,

Speaker 7:          54:50          you know, uh, I guess that that's what it is. I don't know. That's, that's, that's my, I basically a white guy telling a white guy how he fucked up. So black people feel listening to this think, uh, please, please help me out here. Did I basically get it right? Is that essentially it? And I know most people wouldn't get offended at all. Right? So there you go. That's the new, that's the new topic. Is it racist? And I would love to hear, um, some honest comments from a non white people about their thoughts. You know, the fucked up ones too. Okay. Cause I've watched enough spike Lee movies to think that evidently it's just us, but I've hung around enough people from different races to realize, oh yeah,

Speaker 3:          55:33          everybody's like, [inaudible] so.
