Um, why didn't I pick, why did I pick John Rosell? Because his birthday's coming up. Everybody wished Joe to Rosa. Happy Birthday on Sunday. All right. On Twitter

Speaker 1:          00:00:39       you call them twinkle toes. You call them whatever you want, but just, just, just wishing me happy birthday. Anyways. Um, what am I talking about here? Uh, it's a sad day in stand up comedy because, uh, that fucking Scaramucci guy got fired. I know it happened a few days ago, but I don't pay attention and I'll do a podcast every couple of days. What do you want from me? Well Bill, you know, we'd like it though, you know, you know some Douche sent me something on Twitter. He goes, hey bill, please read the news before you do your podcast on North Korea. Shot off a nuclear warhead or a missile or something, and I'm tilting my head to go, there wasn't no killer was some sort of ballistic, whatever the fuck that means. It's a giant mad that could make it to Chicago. That's the way I heard it. And I looked it up and it wasn't nuclear, so I wrote him back.

Speaker 1:          00:01:25       I said, it wasn't no Kyla, you fucking dope. Stop acting like you're too smart to listen to my podcast. I Dunno. And then, and whenever I call people out on it, they go, oh, she was looking for reaction. Oh, where are you? Oh yeah, yeah. Take your comment and fucking go home. Right. You're not in the sandbox anymore. He's gonna to run away. Huh? You're going to go down there and hide under this skirty Yamada. Huh? Um, SCARAMUCCI got fired. Fucking sucks. Everybody says they want somebody honest. And this guy goes in and he literally just says what he's thinking. I didn't know how to say that. Guy Rents. He reacts. R. E. I. N. C. E. Tell me what it means to me. Um, rents. He says he's a fucking paranoid schizophrenia.

Speaker 2:          00:02:15       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:02:16       Uh, paranoiacs whatever the hell that means. And he goes, I'm not sure, like Steve Bannon. I'm not trying to suck my old cock. I'm not trying to build my own brand. I'm here to serve the country. I mean, Jesus Christ. What more do you want from somebody in the White House? Is it, cause he said Cock, is it, cause he said fucking like these people who go in there like Obama who speak eloquently and, and just fucking, you know, we hit a jump shot every fucking once in a while. Now. My God, he's so cool. I don't, I really don't under, I, I fucking given up on people. You know, that's how people are. And when, when, when fucking, uh, what George Carlin died and what's his face? The guy there who fucking was always grabbing a whatever the hell was doing, kept settling out of court, you know, like led Zepplin. Yeah, he does his tribute to George Carlin. It's him to sit in as shitting on him for fucking curse too much. Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:03:16       I Dunno.

Speaker 1:          00:03:19       That's a fucking shame, man. That is a, uh, that is a real fucking shame at that guy is gone yet. L So what did we get it? We're going to have somebody who we're gonna have a clean comic go in there who still lies his ass off. But where's the sweater? I mean, if you can get past cock and fucking, he basically said, I'm not here for my own needs. I'm not here to, to advance myself. Actually, you know, that's a lie. No, right. He's a liar too. But he was a fun liar. Come on, people leave. Fuck the guy was fun.

Speaker 3:          00:03:54       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:03:55       He goes, I'm not a backstabber. I'm more of a front stabber. I mean, this, this was like, it's like what if, what a fucking, somebody who watched Goodfellas too much got to be in the office. Right. And he never took it to debate in class and no one ever told them not to curse and to the microphone. I mean, is it this one? I mean, isn't that what the Internet is all about? Isn't that why the Internet blew up at the end of the fucking day? Isn't that why it blew up? It's not because you want it to go on there and research how fucking seagulls fly from one side of the beach to the other and all those other fun filled facts you can find on a website you went on cause you wanted to see Teddy's, you wanted to see some pussy and you wanted some uncensored language. Isn't that what you wanted? And look how much better society is now because of the Internet.

Speaker 1:          00:04:43       Uh, you know something, if I was ever on the debating team, there wouldn't need to be another person there. Okay. First of all, because I'm not good at debating. And second of all, I end up undoing all of my points during my argument. You know, like if you ever debated me like the worst, the most apprehensive you'd get is you bring your eyebrows up like half. Like, oh, okay, they come back then, okay, he just fucked the whole thing up. He just fucked it all up like Scaramucci did they, aren't you going them all? Look who's here. Hey, I know you're doing your podcast and then leaving. So what are you guys going? Wow. You got oatmeal on your forearm to clean up and get ready to start the day. Okay. Kiss Goodbye. Little princess you. Huh? You eating oatmeal and banana? It's just like Yo man now. Huh? You got to, we got a mushroom up pretty good. This is called the podcast sweetheart.

Speaker 3:          00:05:39       Woo.

Speaker 1:          00:05:41       No, Hey, I'm talking about SCARAMUCCI. So mooch, Scaramucci audios will catch the daily news. Addie. Oh, smooth Chacha and then the other ones, a Henry and our writings riding. When Henry Good milk came up with a MOOC. There it is. Okay. That's what he would have had for the fucking great. Okay. All right ladies. Okay, I'll go to work. Why those before you leave, right? Yeah, but you know something. Parenting is entered a new scary phase. This is where she's mobile. She's going mobile and I don't give a shit. Like if there was a cobra on the floor, she'd grab it by its neck and try to stick it into her mouth. I mean, I hit her on the floor the other day. I thought I had everything all cleaned up and I got one of these casino rugs. Basically you're the ones with all the different colors on it.

Speaker 1:          00:06:40       You're like, oh my God. Is that from the Orient? No, it's from fucking leash. Right. And uh, it's fucking, you know, you can't see stuff. So I remember I was stretching before I worked out like an old man. I got a stretch right. And I saw one of those spongy earplugs on, on the ground and I was like note to self pick that up. And I was just, you know, being a neat freak, cause I've never had a baby crawling around. So long story short, I'm hanging out here with my lovely wife. My daughter's crawling on the floor and I see her in a tongue, looks like it's purple and I'm like, what says enter tongue? What the fuck's going over the tongue? And then she kinda was moving it around a guy. I guess it's all right cause the earplug was purple by the way.

Speaker 1:          00:07:20       She wasn't like losing oxygen and then Diego's yeah, no, she's looking down. She's fine. Jesus Christ. I can pull that out and I can't even begin to tell you like the, when something like hap that happens to you, to your kid, when you drive to work, you get in a cab and you're going to see in the subway however the fuck you get to work, you ride a tricycle with the giant front wheel, however you get to work, you're not even paying attention to what you're doing. All it's going on is a fucking movie in your head. That would make Stanley Kubrick fucking, I dunno what Steven came one of those fucking guys freak out. Like just the stuff I was thinking about like you know the worst case scenario of all of that and now so now there is nothing on the fucking ground. All right, we got those things. You stick on the tables on the corner so you know, so you don't hit the corner with their head. Evidently it's okay. The rest of it they fucking give themself a face rub along the fucking Tasha. What does the Dasher most of you are going to ask? Cause you're not hockey fans. That's a little ledge that goes around the boards, the fucking board.

Speaker 1:          00:08:31       So anyways, we're doing the table read today for episode three Oh three three three three episode three Oh three. We're moving along. We're doing an episode three Oh four next week we'll have five of them done by the end of the month and half way there. Halfway there to writing and then rewriting and then the rewriting starts. Um, but it's, I think, I feel like everybody knows the characters this year and we're cruising along. Knock on wood, knock on wood. So I think this'll be a nice table read. But Oh my God. Every once in a while a nice fucking lay up comes in. He needed that guy. You needed scare a mulch to fucking balance out Trump. Cause everybody's doing Trump jokes enough with the fucking Trump jokes. Jesus fucking Christ. Oh my God. What's going to happen? The same fucking thing that happened when Obama was in office. You're morons. The exact same fucking thing. Watch.

Speaker 1:          00:09:28       Just watch. Watch how much our foreign policy to watch. How much in fucking corporations have to pay attention to the environment. Watch how much bankers go to jail. It's going to be the exact same fucking thing. And I'm not talking about minorities, I'm not talking about illegal aliens. It's white people. Stop acting like you fucking life is gonna Change. Like somebody is going to come in and take your fucking SUV, your little fucking bran muffin or whatever the fuck else she got at Starbucks. All of these fucking assholes freaking the fuck out, which I understand, but where was this for the last fucking eight years and the eight years before they had the AP eight all the way back to Jimmy Carter. Jimmy Carter was the last fucking real man that was in the God damn office. Look at him out there. He's not out there fucking doing Payton's waiting for his library to be built is out there building houses. I could, Goddamn man, it's put his fucking hammer where his mouth this, these other fucking guys just sitting around waiting for their library. But yet, you know, there's a Roman, all those presidential libraries that you go in there for the rest of your life and there's a group, he just standing there, right? And she just blows you the second you walk in and the whole time she does,

Speaker 1:          00:10:38       it's fucking true. All right. If you don't think that's true, then you need to get on the Goddamn Internet. Um, anyways, plowing ahead here.

Speaker 4:          00:10:49       But he had a blue tie.

Speaker 1:          00:10:55       Um, anyways, people, I don't, I don't pay attention to politics. I don't, I just do all of this shit. So then people can air quote correct me on the fucking, on Twitter with their own misinformation. It's a little game I like to call. I don't have a name for it. Um, anyway. Scaramucci God dammit,

Speaker 1:          00:11:16       that guy should have his own fucking podcast. I would listen to that every fucking week. Isn't that what you do now? I love how everybody, when they get fucking, when they totally ruined their career, their first fucking option is what I do. They did. They start doing, stand up. Remember Charlie Shanie fucking two guys, a girl and a fucking pizza place. He was on that whatever the fuck his thing was. Hey, there's two guys in there as a kid and there's no check. I know you know exactly what you're gonna do. 200 fucking episodes and make it to syndication. Let me guess. Do you got two dates in the same fucking night? Now what are going to do? But up, but up up is the story. No wonder he ended up doing all those fucking drug. So would I. How many fucking times can you just sit there doing another episode?

Speaker 1:          00:12:02       Those poor people on those fucking sick comp Smith. Once you get up to like episode 80, 90, and just like, and you know that you don't care anymore, you know, it's bad enough when you don't care. Just the cruise there. I just can't imagine walking out in front of that fucking studio audience. You know, you guys missed it. I was actually, I was in Hollywood during the fucking heyday of that shit. And uh, used to always hear these stories about all of these fucking shows. The stay would be in like the, uh, they were in the seventh season and they'd be like, dude, they, I heard they don't come in until Thursday. You know, most of them don't even show up to the table read. Then they would blow off for her. So Tuesday and Wednesday, they wouldn't even fucking come in Thursday. They just do the block and cause they have, it's so down,

Speaker 3:          00:12:51       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:12:52       I know I go sit on it, Richie, and then I jumped in the air, cross my legs and sit and Howard Cunningham's chair. I got it. How many of these fucking episodes do we got to do? Right. They'd show up for the camera blocking, which is basically, so you know where you stand. So you're going to be on camera, you won't block anybody else. And then the next day they do the taping and then that was it. Yeah. Um, anyway, so these mother fuckers, he's, I bet he does a podcast. You know, they should start a podcast network. Just the outcasts. Right. And it should be like fucking Paula Deen. Um, uh, who's that guy who was like fed fucking really weird guy. Glenn Beck dead. That guy. Jesus Christ. You know, I used to watch him just to feel emotionally stable. He was like a character on a wrestling like Kinda like a, a fucking, I dunno like one of those high pitched, uh, who's that high pitch guy who had the megaphone?

Speaker 1:          00:13:54       It was like Bret Hart. Giuseppe was built like that guy from gladiator gladiator. I forget what that movie was called. Um, anyways, they should have them. Bill O'reilly. Should you just stick them all on the same network and they just sell them like, you know, the main stream couldn't handle us. It couldn't handle our truth. We went out day or shade it lag. [inaudible] everybody is, that's what I do. You know our American playboy can't hate on me because I tell it like it is. That's the male version of when a woman goes like, guides are like intimidated by me. Now you're a cunt and you sir are a racist moron. Okay. You're not telling it how it is. Okay. You're telling it how you're fucking racist. Parents told you how it is and then you never left your town and then somehow you got on television and then you started saying the shit that you heard at the local diner. Right. And then everybody else with dirty boots are like, right.

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       That's how it was. So it was people, I don't know what I'm talking about right now, you know? I have no idea. Oh Man. Oh Jesus. I'll tell you, me and my wife all, we almost got into it. Oh, he almost got into it this morning, you know, fucking unreal. I had to work out this morning to keep my figure in shape. Okay, I've got to do this fucking podcast. Then I got to go over the script and then I have to go do a table read. I got to do all of that before 10 o'clock in the morning and I forget whatever the fucking branch of the armed serve we do more before booking Millenium oh yeah, you got a table read. What do you deal? You march around and sing dirty limericks

Speaker 5:          00:15:31       wait up

Speaker 1:          00:15:35       Hashtag,

Speaker 5:          00:15:42       Huh?

Speaker 1:          00:15:43       Oh right. That's what the fuck you do. And then you do some pull ups and all of a sudden I'm supposed to fucking sit there and feel like I haven't done anything. I got to do what those guys that doing. I've always wanted another adult with more lines on the side of his sleeve screaming at me. How can I sign up for that? You know, if I was a gun nut, I joined the fucking military that, that, that's what you want to do, right? You know, you know what the deal is. You start off with tin cans, then you move up to squirrels, then you shoot a bird, right? And then eventually you get in the fucking board. Cause at the end of the day, no matter how difficult it is, they matter how much deer urine you've got to put on yourself. You shooting something dumber than you.

Speaker 1:          00:16:23       At some point you want to go after the ultimate brain, okay? You've watched Jurassic Park too many times. You realize there's no real Velo Rasa, [inaudible], whatever the fuck they they, God damn thinks where you realize there aren't enough of those. You'd like, I'm joining the God damn military. Right. That's what you do. I wonder how many psychos did that, you know, they always say that they're doing it for your freedom. Right? I joined, I show a sharp don't happen. And I was like, I'm not done. Then there are those people, come on, somebody write me an anonymous, what branch of the service or you went, Huh? Are you in the coast guard? Yeah. We get to sense what are the people you're working with? Joy. Just because they wanted to see someone half eaten by shark pull 'em out of the water just to see what it looks like.

Speaker 1:          00:17:08       You know, I think the coast guard, that's, that's like the worst fucking like out of all the jobs, because the war never ends. It never ends. You know, hopefully at some point this shit will end over in the Middle East, you know? Um, I don't know how it ends, but who the fuck knows? But anyways, um, the coast guard, it never fucking, and that right there, I mean, can you get the metal of, they should have a civilian saving a dumb civilian medal of honor for the fucking coast guard. Do you realize every time there's like a bad storm coming and that telling everybody to stay inside and you get like, oh you get excited. You know, cause all they sent me home from work early, all we get to light a fire in the fireplace, you know, let's watch raising Arizona, get the kids together, all wrap up in a blanket and you have a great fucking time.

Speaker 1:          00:18:03       Oh Beg some smarts. That's why I love you lady. Right? You're getting ready. You know what the fuck they're doing. And the coast guard, they have fucking palms are sweating. Their stomach is in a knot because they know some stupid fuck is going to get in his God damn boat around his fucking surfboard or his boogie board or some dumb shit is gonna go on a fucking hike. All right. And he's going to Alton, you gotta come get me. And these people who are completely safe got to get in there. Fucking got to get in a fucking helicopter, fly out the middle of a fucking hurricane, defy some fucking dope in his silly named yacht who had to take the fucking thing out, right. Had to show off in front of his trophy fucking wipe and now they got to go out there. It's some poor bastard. He's got a fucking jump out of a helicopter in a hurricane into the fucking ocean to try to get these fucking dopes out of there, back to the land. So what they can breed and make more stupid people. So the people at the top of the coast guard can keep making their fucking blood money. We're taking college.

Speaker 2:          00:19:16       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:19:16       That right there is the scariest fucking job. I am terrified to the fucking ocean. Okay. You would not want to have a bunch of mes in the Coast Guard. Okay. Those fucking boats would just be sitting there in the sun and on the day will be yet that would be it. I would fucking, I would be, we would be on the dock. I'd be on the boat with a life jacket on playing cards and I would get like this distress car. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:19:40       Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:19:43       Good. I'd be like, Hey Roger Dad. Well what the fuck are you doing out there?

Speaker 6:          00:19:48       Well, I don't, what the fuck, what the fuck?

Speaker 1:          00:19:59       That would be me, I would have that meltdown every dime and then I would do the job because basically at the end of the day, if I was in the coast guard, that's how I have to fucking make my limit. And now I have to go out there and fish some fucking dope out there. Is Anybody in the Coast Guard listening to this? Can you please tell me there's no way when you phish somebody out of the ocean. Okay. And then they, you got to fucking go last.

Speaker 2:          00:20:26       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20:26       And then they send that fucking hook down again. Right? It's just sitting there and 40 foot waves are going up and down.

Speaker 1:          00:20:39       When they wrote, when they fucking crank you back up in that Goddamn helicopter, there is no fucking way, you know, talk some shit to that guy is he's sitting there with that fucking, I almost got swallowed by the ocean. Look on his face. Whatever the fuck that looks like. He knows he's fucking dumb. Right? Do you must look them right in the heg take fuck head. Next time he take your boat out, why don't you make sure the fucking sun's out and it's not a fucking whatever. Well, how are they rate a hurricane? Fucking got goddamn five or a cake. It's unbelievable. You know what I always think that they fucking look like? I mean, you just, I would be so fucking embarrassed if I ever did some dumb shit like that and somebody had to go out wrist. If fucking life fly a fucking helicopter. You're not supposed to fly. And turbulence with helicopters. As far as Mike, my little knowledge of it and these fucking guys got to go fly out and then that shit unfucking believable. They ever make a movie about the Coast Guard, Huh? Well, I didn't say it. I'm fucking making movies about, made a whole TV show about a fucking dolphin saving people. They call him flipper. He can pray. You can hold his breath and then it comes up I think if supposed to be there. All right,

Speaker 1:          00:22:01       let me make a fucking TV show about a of of a guy saving fish. You know that f beached themselves and you throw it pay and maybe they did. Was it free willy? We actually, we captured that one. I don't know if I think I probably owe coast guard ever fishes me out of the fucking ocean. You know what the look I'm going to have on my face. Do you remember when Oj got arrested the second time and he knew he was fucked, but he was trying to smile. Remember that fucking that's the fucking look I would have on my face. I just forgot. I know. I know. You don't have to say is that they do, you shouldn't say a fucking word to those people after you pull them out of the water. Even the gold digging whores, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:22:38       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:22:39       Just talk to her. Yeah. He had enough heavy, had enough rich old caulk at this point.

I don't know what Muhammad did. I don't even want to get into Buddha. But as far as me as a white male, white male, Christian, there's no holiday this month. Okay, so you're probably sitting there going, why the fuck would I get her flowers?

He's going to be ready. Wow. Come October. Uh, what you gonna do when? Oh, Jane comes running wild on you. I've had a pretty nonconfrontational life. Yes, you did. Oj. Except for that night. He killed two people. Other than that. That was it. You ever see that fucking documentary about how we got fucking arrested the second time when he went down there to go get his shit, you know, and then he had his buddy take out his gun and then they didn't have his memorabilia that he thought. So then these other fucking assholes started grabbing autograph Pete Rose Baseballs, and then they took the guy's cell phone and then it became an armed robbery. I mean, I would assume also think, depending on how that got got the memorabilia, I don't really remember. All I know is it's like, dude, I can tell you this man. Okay. If I was a black guy who got away with killing two white people and I would not leave the fucking house for the rest in me, it's what the fucking guy, I don't know what he's thinking. You know, you run for 2000 yards in a 14 game season and then all of a sudden you think you're invincible.

Speaker 1:          00:33:38       That fucking look on his face when he gets arrested the second time where he knows he's fucked and yet he's trying to smile. I was talking about that yesterday in the writer's room. It's one of the funniest fucking things I've ever seen. It's like that, and there's one of ric flair with somebody's interviewing him and they're asking him, what was it like the last time you went to Japan and you see his love for wrestling, and he knew it was his last day, said, look at this picture. What was going on? And he was like, this was, I knew this was my last time I was going to Japan and he starts to fucking cry and he doesn't want to cry, you know, cause he's the nature boy and he's trying not to cry. So he's smiling while he's trying. I can try not to cry.

Speaker 1:          00:34:21       I've never seen an actor do that in a seat because of an actor's starts to cry, they can't help it. They're like, oh good, I'm crying. This is what the director wants. Crying equals good acting. I'm going to get an award. All right, Denzel gets one with one tier. I got to tears coming down that aren't, I mean, die. Get a Golden Globe and a fucking Oscar. Right. All right, that's the podcast. Please listen to this wonderful music. Oh, by the way, you know what am I finally fucking got into? And I, I used to trash them all the time. Joe Rosa was right about Frank Zappa. I could never get into a, granted I was listening to fucking hair metal. It was two. And I always, people always said Joe's garage. Every time I read a fucking drummer magazine for fucking 15 years, every drum was trying to get Vinnie Callie, you as high hat sound and Geogebra Joe's garage.

Speaker 1:          00:35:11       That's what they always said. You know, I wanted to get that Vinny call you to high hats and Joe's garage. And I always got to put on and I was like, what the fuck is this? I don't even know what's going on. Is, is frank mocking music is easy trying to take what I just, it was so far beyond anything. I was listening to it. It didn't sound good, if you can believe that. And, um, I finally just put it on in the car and I also fucking had another 15 years of listening to music and actually trying to expand my horizons from top 40 Horse Shit that I had been listening to. And, uh, it's fucking unbelievable album. It's fucking unbelievable. So, uh, Joe de Rosa, I trashed him so many goddamn times about Frank Zappa so many times. And I was like, Joe, you're contrarian. You just like it cause it's different djs.

Speaker 1:          00:35:57       I swear to God, if everybody liked Frank Zappa, you wouldn't fucking like him. And he goes, that is a true bill. I, I, I'd hate you and your freckled face. And we would go back and forth, back and forth as we drank the fucking the brown devil then that's what we would do. Okay. And Joe Rosa, I'll tell you right now, and I'm going to tell him his son, his birthday, he was never more right about Frank Zappa and he was never more, he was right about the brown album with Primus. And he was right about the, the fucking golden girls. Okay. I saw the golden girls. I saw four old ladies, Joe, to Rosa saw comedy gold. I didn't see it the other night I was sitting and they weren't on, they were having a marathon. I was trying to get my daughter to go to sleep and I'm watching the shit that's like 30 years old and I'm laughing my ass off.

Speaker 1:          00:36:38       I fucking love that show now. You know. So my apologies to the great Joe to Rosa and happy birthday to him and oh by the way, if you guys would like to do me the biggest fucking favor you could ever do, there's a few fucking tickets left for Paul Versey standup special, his first one, his first hour, then me, Pete Davidson, Al Madrigal and all things comedy. We'll be producing our first standup special. We would love to sell this place out. Okay. Was So fucking close. We could lie to Paul and say this is sold out. We just want to sell these last few tickets. If he could do it, if he can make it down. Okay. It's at the Tarrytown theater in beautiful Tarrytown, New York. I mean, this is like one of the, the beginning of a Tom Hanks movie, when he has the perfect life before he decides to fucking go out there and it gets stuck on a Goddamn island talking to a volleyball, right? This is where they would start maybe his neighborhood. And like big when he was riding the fucking ball with a little kid was riding the bike. That's what this place looks like. He could bring you lady up, you can have a nice fucking dinner. Me and Pete Davidson are going to go on stage and fuck around at the same time trying out new bits, getting you guys warmed up. And then Paul [inaudible], he's going to absolutely fucking crush it. All right. And all things,

Speaker 7:          00:37:50       but he is producing it and it's going to be great. So please come down if you can. I'll be hanging out in between shows. You want to get a picture? I'll sign shit. Whatever the fuck I gotta do to get you into the goddamn building. Um, that's it. I'll be tweeting out a link. Uh, let's make it happen. Okay. That's it. Enjoy the music and we'll be playing some a greatest hits of a Thursday afternoon just before Monday morning, Friday, fucking whatever the hell he called this thing on the Thursday gone by and another year.

Speaker 2:          00:38:17       Awesome. Alright, go fuck yourselves. Have a great weekend consent. I'll talk to you.

Speaker 6:          00:38:37       Okay. Hey Mom.

Speaker 8:          00:40:09       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burr and it is the Monday morning podcast for Monday, August the third 2009 why the fuck does it say November? You know what? I thought I finally had it. I was going to be like, it's 77 degrees out. Chance of a high of 83 and now I'm looking at says fucking November. Why is that?

Speaker 8:          00:40:35       I Dunno. Why the fuck it does it? That does to meet every God damn week. I'll gives a shit, whatever. It's August 3rd all right. Another year flying by Jesus Christ. Where is the summer going? Huh? How many people have said that to you already? Everybody always says that. Where is the summer go egg every year. It just seems to go by even faster. I'd say it's amazing like the first 20 years of my life, it just seemed like it took forever about today. Once she had 30 those years, they just, they just, they fly by. Oh, and if you have a kid, forget about it. Just for fun. Yeah. I mean, I don't, I don't even remember 35 to 46 nobody cares, lady. Nobody cares. You're, you're saying the same shit. We got it. Life goes by fast. Okay. Where is the time going? I don't know. I'm wasting a lot right now listening to you, going on your big, long fucking seemingly philosophical little rant about where the fucking time is going.

Speaker 8:          00:41:37       While you're not really being, you're not presenting any what? A philosophical shit. Now you like that people, this is going to be a hybrid of podcasts where I hit you with terms like philosophical shit. All right? So I'll be coming at me acting like I'm, I'm getting all upper crust here. That's your own insecurity because you get nervous when I, when I use terms like that. All right? That's not my fault. You went to a community college, you know, and you didn't have great teachers to teach you about philosophical shit. All right, whatever. This is the Monday morning podcast. I do one of these every single week and um, I really enjoy doing them. Um, I don't know why cause you know why? Cause I walk around my apartment and I talked to myself anyways and when I have, um, when I have headphones on and I have talking into a microphone, I don't feel as crazy while my dog is already asleep.

Speaker 8:          00:42:33       She's in heat right now. Jesus Christ walking around with the fucking swollen pussy. That's what I got. Huh? How is that? Yeah. I hope you were eating when I just said that as disgusting as one of the most disgusting things I've ever said. But anyways, this is really going off the rails quick this week. People brand new conductor here. Um, all right, let's, let's get down to some shit here that I want to talk about. First of all, I have some homework for all of you guys, everyone who's listening to this podcast and um, I got to admit my podcast. I think it's finally taking off because in the last couple of weeks I've learned that I don't have enough bandwidth on iTunes for the amount of people downloading it. So I appreciate all the new listeners. I got a computer nerd friend around the corner who hopefully will solve the problem tomorrow.

Speaker 8:          00:43:27       You know, teach me how to get some more bandwidth or whatever, so more people can listen to it. I get a ton of questions. So anyway, so I feel like I'm starting to build a force here. All right? So maybe I can use this force for, for like my own wishes. You know that Jesus Christ at the, even for my own wishes, for, for my own desires. There we go. So this is the required homework for all of you this week. All of you have to go out and you got, you have to go see the movie, the orphan. All right? It is required because I want to talk about that movie for a good 10, 15 minutes. I want to talk about that movie. Um, but I don't want to ruin it for people. All right? You have to go see that movie. That movie is a throwback to classic, I would say mid maybe late eighties horror films where, um, they just kind of went off the rails and they building suspense.

Speaker 8:          00:44:32       So the whole thing just became funny cause it was inadvertently a fucking hilarious movie. And uh, I dunno. Ah, Shit. I want to talk about this. I'm giving you guys one fucking week next week I'm talking about that movie because it was so, uh, it was so ridiculous. You know, this is how I know it's a good horror movie is if I go and see it and then when I get home and I'm turning the lights out, you know, I'm creeped out in my own apartment. You know, as I walked by a hallway and there's no light on, you know, like to this day, to this day, when I'm on the road and I go back to my hotel room, every once in a while I'll put the fucking lights out and I'll expect like the TV to come on and see the girl crawling out of the well or to hear the phone ring.

Speaker 8:          00:45:21       And I pick it up and it's going to go seven days, you know, because that movie, I don't know what it was about the ring, that one stayed with me, the Blair witch, which was really a polarizing movie where a lot of people look to those fucking stupid. I won't fucking scared at all. I was just fucking laughing. You know those people, those people who go to scary movies and they got to talk about how it didn't scare them and how they laughed the whole time as if that means if they were actually confronted by a psycho on the street, they would have a better chance of, uh, you know, of surviving because they laughed in a movie theater. I mean, anybody can sit in a fucking movie and just take themselves out of the movie and just fell. It's just an actor. Oh, it's fake blood.

Speaker 8:          00:46:02       You can do that. You know, I dunno. Maybe this is me just getting fucking defensive because the Blair witch scared the shit out of me. You know, I fucking bought that movie hook, line and sinker and the end when that dude was standing there facing the fucking corner, it was just creepy. I like when I can't see the monster. That's my thing. Is that your thing bill? I don't remember asking you what your thing is. Well then don't fucking listen. Sorry. I'm going to, I'm kind of in a mood right now. There's a lot. I had a lot of devastating shit happened to me this week. And not only that, I was driving, uh, down the street out here and I saw some lady had a, a, a sign on, on the back of her, her as Suzu trooper, everybody 1988, Isuzu Trooper Zuzu however the fuck you say it.

Speaker 8:          00:46:50       And it says, uh, I might be slow, but I'm in front of you. You know, and that's the kind of person, if someone dragged them out of the car and started beating them repeatedly about the head and neck, as much as I would feel bad for the person who's driving the zoo, trooper [inaudible] kind of be kind of asking for it, you know, why are you baiting people to beat the shit? That's what you're doing right there. That's like Nananana ass shit. And uh, you know, it's like, uh, I don't know. That would be like me a, I don't know, in the 60s when the race riots were going on, you know, and having some fucking racial shit on my isn't really bill, is it really to that level? Now? You're right, it is. And I don't even go down a fucking robot, a moron. Um, but anyway, speaking of the, in the 1988 Zuzu trooper, and that's kind of been a new thing that I have on my, uh, my myspace page is I'm taking pictures of random vehicles out here in Los Angeles.

Speaker 8:          00:47:52       Um, because I, I just, you can't believe how long, if you're from the east coast, you cannot believe how long cars last out here. Some of the cars that like, oh, you have a hang out with your friends, you know, some high school buddies, you know, you haven't seen in awhile. And then they bring up some kid who moved in the second grade, you know, hey, remember John Sarno everything and you were like, holy fuck, I have not thought about that kid since 1982 dad is what it's like walking, driving around out here. I don't know if I told you this a couple of months back, I saw a Pontiac t 1000 in good condition out here. Chocolate, Brown, Pontiac t 1000. And for those of you who aren't in the car, you probably think, oh, teen 1000 probably had some bulls. You know, you could probably do a burnout or whatever fucking stupid thing those gearheads do.

Speaker 8:          00:48:52       Um, that I'm jealous of because I don't know how to fix a car myself. Um, Pontiac team 1000 was actually the Pontiac's answer to the shoe. A Chevy Chevette, which was a hatchback Chevy Chevette and was also a very, um, on its way to becoming a hugely hacky joke. When I first started in stand up, one of the classic hacky jokes when I first started was, uh, people get on stage and be like, Hey, I'm doing pretty good. You know, you see my car outside? Yeah, I got, the vet has Chevette and I'd be like, yeah,

Speaker 9:          00:49:30       Oh shit. I thought he was Doug about it, love it.

Speaker 8:          00:49:33       And then the guy and his, everyone's laughing. The guy would be adjusted his sport coat sleeves to make sure that they were three quarters of the way down his forearms to let you know that he wasn't in an office. You know, that's why he had the pastel colored tee shirt underneath his sport coat to let you know that he was, he was off the grid. He was out of the Matrix. He found a way to find your daily grind uniform, a fucking edgy. That might be one of the worst periods of fucking dress ever. The late eighties, standup comedian, remember that with this skinny ties or the fuck he's just, it's just in the, and the, the, the was basically the feathered mullet. It was like Farrah Fawcett met. Uh, I don't know, Billy Ray Cyrus. I got, I got fucking nothing on that one. But speaking of which, let, let's, let's plow ahead.

Speaker 8:          00:50:30       So anyways, I, I have, uh, I've been taking some pictures of some pretty random fucking vehicles, one of which I don't even know what it was. It looks like a big RV. I thought it was a Volkswagen. It's missing the bumpers. It literally looks like it's made out of Styrofoam Styrofoam and I'm convinced someone's living in it. Um, but anyways, check those out on my myspace page if you're bored. But, hey, bill, why don't you get back to the podcast? Fine. I will. And I will, you're probably wondering, you know, a couple of minutes ago I said I kind of had a devastating week. Um, how do I get into this? All right. Once again, going back about a month ago when the subject of, uh, steroids in baseball came up. I did not name a name, but I said if one particular person were to some for some reason get busted, I guess it wasn't roids it was HGH, but whatever was HDH whatever the fuck it is. If they were to get busted debt, I was going to be done with baseball and, uh, the person got busted and, uh, that's it. I'm out. I'm out.

Speaker 10:         00:51:38       Okay,

Speaker 8:          00:51:39       I'm out. Fuck baseball. I don't know if I'm going to be out forever, but fuck it. I did catch myself for half a second watching a Dodgers. I think they're playing the cardinals. I can't watch it. I watch for like three seconds. And then Manny Ramirez came up and I was like, Oh, here we go again. I'm done. I'm fucking done with, you know, what bugs me the most about all of this shit. And um, you know, I got, I got emails from a couple of Yankee fans going on, right? Gold. Now what now what you say [inaudible] you know what a yeah, you're right. You're absolutely right. But I'll tell you, us against you is even roids verse Roids and Europe where you're actually still a couple ahead of us. But no, it's roids verse Roids. All right, if you want to argue the 2004 championship, because I can't really think of a cardinal that got caught. Uh, I would have that argument with somebody from St Louis. But as far as Yankee fans go, I mean, come on dude. All right. We, we, we, you know, you guys did everything but send a fucking center up to the plate.

Speaker 8:          00:52:43       You know what? That's what the Yankees and red sox should be right now. They should just have half men, half horses and they just go up to the plate, you know, and they got to put on a jersey, cause you can't look at that little fucking, uh, you can't look at that. You know, you know what it is when they come up to bat, they're good. They're going to need a shirt cause they're going to need a little pocket to put that little fucking pan flute in when they come up. I think that that's what they should do. So I gotta be honest with you, I don't know what is going on at baseball, but uh, I'm not even mad at the players anymore. What's really pissing me off at this point is how the owners made all that money and they're not being held accountable on any level. I really think like the last 10 years of baseball was just a big marketing

Speaker 2:          00:53:33       okay.

Speaker 8:          00:53:33       Like scheme to get everybody, like how insane is this country into baseball now, I don't know if you guys remember, but back in the early mid nineties, it was really going downhill even before the strike and all that. Basically all you had was cal Ripkin was going to break Lou Gehrig's record record record record and um,

Speaker 2:          00:53:56       yeah,

Speaker 8:          00:53:56       he was like this throwback guy and he was doing something that was really respectable. W uh, you know, it was a record that, okay, how much, I can't even talk. What the fuck is wrong with me? It's like Lou Gehrig went back to an era that was considered, you know, a golden age during America as far as hard work and World War II when segregation and water fountains and all that other fucked up shit that they don't really see. You ever noticed that when they go back in time, you know when they talk about the golden years, they, they or they talk about racism. They never tell those two stories at the same time. You know, America, we made all this, you know, made steel, steel workers. I don't know all this type of shit in the American car and all that type of stuff. But they always, and then if they're going to tell the racism story, they just tell that one separately, you know?

Speaker 8:          00:54:40       All right, you could, you could beat your, your wife. The rule of thumb, you know, what was the rule of thumb? You could, you could, you could beat your wife with a stick no bigger than your thumb. You know, you can't tell me girls weren't looking at guys. Thumbs on first dates back then, those little five foot, six inches do with little fucking little sausage fingers so that Jesus could I take the beat down from this guy and I don't think I could, you know, but then again, the women back then, it was like big milkmaids, you know, they were all doughy.

Speaker 2:          00:55:11       Okay.

Speaker 8:          00:55:11       You ever see like the paintings from way back in the day of like sexy women? You know, they were raw. They were definitely healthy. So healthy fucking women. All right, I'm getting off the track here. All right, so let's get back to baseball. So you fucking, so basically what they did was, I think basketball and football were overtaking him. I mean, that's what I was watching. Bird Magic, Jordan, Isaiah Thomas, all those great teams, Dominique Wilkins, all that stuff was going on. Then in football, I mean, I went from the late seventies Roger Staubach beaten the Denver Broncos. That was the first Superbowl I watched. And I went right through, you know, the last two Terry Bradshaw's Steeler championships into Joe Montana, Dan Marino, John Elway, right on through, right on, through, right up til like, uh, I would say the end was maybe a cowboys dynasty.

Speaker 2:          00:56:11       Okay.

Speaker 8:          00:56:12       That year with the fuck happened when the 40 niners played the, the chargers in the super bowl. That's, that's when, that's when the golden age ended. That was a bad one. Um, anyways, but whatever. So no one was fucking watching baseball son. And they just want, they want, they, they juiced up the ball, they made the ballpark smaller, and then they just look the other way as these fucking roided out dudes came up and hit like 80 home runs as a third baseman and they all made a shit load of money and now they're leaving the players to hold the fucking bag. Uh, I don't know. I think it's bullshit. So because of that, I actually, I'm beginning to try to find a different sport that I can watch in the summertime. And, uh, I went to the x games in Carson, California on Saturday and I watched a little motorcross man.

Speaker 8:          00:57:01       It was, that was definitely, it was cool. But I, I've never felt so old in my life going down to that thing. And I also did not fit in. If you've never been to the x games, a motorcross SORTA skateboard, all that type of shit to describe the crowd. It's Sorta if Travis Barker and dog, the bounty hunter had children, that's what the crowd would fucking live. Somehow they had 30,000 children. That's what the fucking crowd would look like. It was very, uh, everybody there, it looked like they had at least one felony, you know, and I'm dirty, filthy, filthy, Skanky fucking women just, you know, I, you know, it's, it's, it, it's getting a tattoo. Is that out yet? Is that it? Has that gone the way of the bell bottom? There is nothing more skanky or then just fucking, just tattoos on a woman.

Speaker 8:          00:57:54       It's just, you know, I don't know. I remember there was a period where they were kind of cute or whatever and then, I dunno, it jumped the shark when whoever coined the term the tramp stamp. And if you live under a fucking log, that's basically the tattoo when the small of a woman's back that just really just says that, you know, I fucked a lot of guys in my sorority. That's another major red flag. When you see a girl who has like a sorority tattoo down around her ankle that yeah. Um, I dunno, I'm not saying don't marry her, I'm just saying don't go to any of her high school or college reunions because there's going to be a lot of guys going up shaking your hand with that look on their face. Like does this guy know that me and my buddy fucking double teamed his fucking wife, the mother of his children and I know a lot of females right now.

Speaker 8:          00:58:46       What you saying right now? That's the double Sandra. That's as I was saying, how can we as a come a guy can go out and blah, blah blah. And if a woman does it, she's a whore. I'll tell you why. This is actually a bit for my act. I'm going to burn in my podcast. I'll tell you why. Because for a woman to get laid is absolutely, there's no fucking skill involved. All right. You getting laid is like me trying to get a fat kid eat ice cream. You know, it's really, there's not a lot of, you know, I guess, see what it is is a guy, his men have to make women want to fuck us. We have come up, we have to dazzle. We got to put on a show. We got to come up with some sort of fucking angle to get someone of the opposite sex to touch us. You guys can, you can just fucking lay down in a pool table. You could bang everybody fucking bar. There's no skill. It's gluttonous. That's what it is. It's gluttonous. It's like watching a fat guy eat ice cream in public and listen

Speaker 11:         00:59:43       [inaudible] nobody gives a shit. But when I do do a Google would've figured fuck

Speaker 8:          00:59:49       because you're a fat fuck. That's why. So getting back to the woman thing, no respect, no respect for your numbers. Because you have a vagina. All right. There we go. Jesus Christ. Bill, you went a long way on that one. Eric. We're 20 minutes in and I don't think I've ever felt more ignorant. Um, all right, continuing on. Here's something that I wanted to, uh, and I just realized the record levels are kind of high here. I hope I'm not my screaming into this thing. Um, anyways, whenever it gives a fuck, uh, this is what you get. This is what you get. What did they want to say this week? Oh, I know. This is something I would like, if anybody out there, does anybody out there have a VHS copy of the Superbowl with the rams? Beat the titans? I've never seen that. Superbowl and it bugs me. It's the only Superbowl since 1978 Broncos, cowboys. It's the only one that I missed. And when I say I missed it, I missed the whole fucking thing. Um, and why was that? I was dating some girl and she wasn't into it.

Speaker 8:          01:01:08       Are you seeing my dog here? Just go. Sometimes I feel like I'm telling a story and she's actually board. Um, anyway, she wasn't into it and uh, yeah, so I ended up fucking hanging out with her and stead. Wow. Was that embarrassing? And an end up being course ended up being one of the greatest Superbowls fucking ever and I've never seen it. So if anybody has a copy of it, please can you make me a copy? Send me an email and send it my way. I'll trade you. I'll trade you a fucking DVD for a VHS copy of that. Um, all right. There we go. That was, it was a really fucking long way to go. All right, let's throw it to get this thing back on track. She can tell you can't you guys always tell when I'm searching on my computer and my sentences become more choppy?

Speaker 8:          01:01:52       All right. Hey, Bill. Uh, you talked about inadvertent racism on your July 27th podcasts and I see what you're saying. Uh, simply recognizing that certain dialects can be found in whites, blacks, Asians, et Cetera, isn't really racist. But the woman who emailed you about shiny suits on Conan called you working class or blue collar or some shit, presumably based on your Boston accent and you seem to take offense to it. Just thought you'd want to know. Uh, you're talking out of two sides of your mouse here, miles here. And I am emailed her back and told her that basically my entire act and the podcast are based on talking out of both sides of my mouth. So I found that email hilarious. But my point, and I'm not going to stop blaming people for not getting my point because I understand how my complete inability to present my points. Clearly. My point is that, you know, each race does have an accent.

Speaker 6:          01:02:52       Okay.

Speaker 8:          01:02:52       So if you were to say that sounds sounded like an Asian dude. Oh, that sounded like a black dude. It's not racist. You know, it isn't,

Speaker 8:          01:03:05       I still can't fucking explain this without sounding like a dick. I look if, if, if some, if you were talking to some guy on the phone and he's like, oh, hello, I be over there. Very, very sure. And again, it comes over and it was a black guy, wouldn't you be in the back? He had like Jesus Christ, this guy, he sounded like like a fucking Asian dude. Now I'm not saying that all Asian guys sound like that, but if somebody sounds like that, they are going to sound like they're Asian and I'm also not a master of dialects, so I am going to be doing an exaggerated version of your people. That's it. The same way def jam comic go on TV and imitate. White Guy's gone. Oh Gee, I got to go do my taxes. Holy Heck Gee. Willikers Jimmy, do you have any cricket? I mean, nobody knows anyone who talks like that, but you know what this say plus it's comedy.

Speaker 8:          01:03:55       It's a fucking joke, right? That's all I'm saying. Okay, so way back in the day, the Oj trial, when a neighbor heard a voice and it said is sounded like a black guy, and they tried to sit there and make that unbelievable, the most racist thing ever. It wasn't, you know, believe in an like, let's look at gay guys. One of the most fascinating accents ever. Here's another bit I used to do on my act. How gay guys come from all over the country, all over the world. Let's just stick with this country. They come from all 50 states, yet there is a gay accent.

Speaker 8:          01:04:33       Hi, how are you doing? Yes, Jesus, right? Hacky, absolutely. But a hundred percent not true. You can't say that. And that fascinates me because I think if you're a gay guy from down south, you should be like, hey buddy, I know and I want to suck your fucking Dick. What do you think about that? You really got a nice bump there, buddy. You know what I mean? Ah. It gives a fuck. I'm so sick of trying to explain my uninformed fucking views. Whatever. It's a podcast. Don't take it seriously. Some people take it seriously. Yeah, it gives a shit. Yeah. Just get to no, they take it seriously. Then it gives me something to read. So please, for the love of God, keep uh, keep taking this shit seriously. Um, all right, here's another one for you. We're going to be dealing a lot with racist week evidently.

Speaker 8:          01:05:23       Here's a very, uh, he's a very, some of these emails, they're getting a little serious here. Here's one for you. Hey Bill, I'm an, I'm an 18 age old black man. You know, do you guys proof read these things? And I've always wanted to interracially date since middle school. I'm sorry. Just had some fucking weed checks. So that literally sounded like I was getting choked up. I've always wanted the interracially dates. It's middle school. Um, but there is one short five 11 guy that is always there and a mess up. Something good. My Dad, my dad is what you would call a buzzkill. I'm a photographer for my school and there was a girl that I've been friends with for awhile and uh, almost every halftime at the football games we would talk one time she said, hey, can I take a picture with you?

Speaker 8:          01:06:16       I was not going to say no because the more you please women, you went a little closer to her pleasing you. Oh God. Is that hilarious? That's how a young man thinks. That's a whole nother subject. You know what, you actually want to be going in the opposite direction a lot of the times. But if she's a nice girl, yes. Be Nice to wear anyways. Um, so anyways, years she gets close to pleasing you. But uh, as she climbed out of the stands, I was running through my, it was running through my head what my old man would say because he makes me show him the photos to see my progress. I guess as a photographer, um, we had someone snapped the photo of us and when I got home and put the photos up for my old man, I tried to skip it, but he saw that I had to sit there for an hour in 45 minutes and listen to how white people did US wrong for 400 years. And if you, if you start liking them, it's because you want to be them. Bill A, that's just the light version. A couple of weeks ago we were at our family reunion and we were watching tiger woods. I said, the tiger woods had a hot wife.

Speaker 8:          01:07:22       I really wish you recorded all of this. And my dad butted in and said, is she hot? Is she hot because she's white. Bill, I tried to tell this shit head that I love all women no matter what race. Um, one, no matter what the race is, my old man flew off the handle. I had to sit for three hours and listen to him rant about the same shit I've heard since I was 13. Stuff like, you just hate black women, don't you? You just want mud kids, don't you? Jesus Christ. If you do marry them, you'll just be a dog to them. And I always know and I always knew that that yellow Skinner, yours would go to your head. Uh, I guess that's light skin. It's like a whole nother fucking thing. Ah, high yella. Doesn't that mean light skinned? Anybody out there of a African persuasion that can explain that to white people? Red Boned and all that shit. Um, anyways, uh, so whatever. More light skinned. So thinks he's a cut above. Can't hang out. So what does your dad, does your dad look like? Keith Robinson. All right, that's for standup fans anyways. Uh, where are we going? What am I going with this? I just lost my fucking plates.

Speaker 8:          01:08:40       Mud kids, yellow skin. Jesus, one of them fucking ugliest emails ever. Um, Bill, this is, uh, Bill, this is just I short on me. I don't know what you're writing here. I'm six. One love Jennifer. Love Hewitt, Vanessa and Hughes Riana.

Speaker 8:          01:09:03       Oh Jesus Christ. What the fuck? And I always, and I always that that Chris Brown would backfire. I always knew that that Chris Brown would backfire and that Asian girls from the beat and that age girl from the beginning of true lies a girl is a girl. And when you're, and when you are hungry like a wolf, this kid hilarious. You do not want to settle for just one kind of food. This guy basically. Yeah, he's 18. He wants to fuck on every continent. He wants to bang a girl from every racist is total normal behavior. Bill, I've hated my family.

Speaker 8:          01:09:45       This is really become a doctor Phil here. Bill, I have hated my family for fucking up my life from birth with their divorce and my mom died when I was 14. She us iron man. I forgot about that part. I would have been laughing here, but I hated her like m and m hated his mom. I'm living with my dad now for now because I'm about to head to college and that same girl is going to the same college and she wants to hook up. Bill helped me find an easy way to tell my dad the fuck off while do, I dunno if you've been listening to my podcast, but do you really think I'm qualified on any level to address the shit that's going on here? Do this is like, this is like the perfect storm of stuff. All right. All right. The first of all, the mistake your dad's making is by ranting and raving at you for an hour and 45 minutes about what he doesn't want you to do is the quickest way to make you run out and go do it. All right. And from what I, I've my experience as a kid, obviously I don't have any kids and uh, yeah, he should be able to date whoever you want to date. I will say this, you're 18, don't get a girlfriend.

Speaker 8:          01:11:00       All right? Stay single. Get out there, figure out what you want. And as you're going around fucking the, uh, entire rainbow of color out there, be making a mental list. What you're looking for in somebody to, uh, to settle down with. This is the shit that, this is all the shit that I didn't do is I rudderlessly just bounced from one fucking chick to another. Um,

Speaker 2:          01:11:30       okay.

Speaker 8:          01:11:31       Nice way to tell you I, and easy way to tell you dad to fuck off. Uh, you know what, why don't you try agreeing with them?

Speaker 8:          01:11:38       You know, when he goes, yeah, I knew that yellow skin would go to your head and be like, you're absolutely right. Data. I can't even believe that I'm talking to you. In fact, when we walk in public, is there any way that you could kind of walk like 40 feet behind me so people don't know that we're together? You can, I don't mean, I don't know if your dad gets physical and you starts fucking slapping you around like some lifetime movie. But, uh, I've used this technique on, uh, a number of people after a while, when you just get sick, you have to get somebody, they just get, they just get, I dunno, they, they get, they get pissed cause they know you're going to go out and possibly enjoy life more than they have. You know, like I had a couple people, uh, you know, when I moved down in New York, I had friends given me shit like a, you know, hey I got a new apartment here but it's not New York City.

Speaker 8:          01:12:24       And then I'd always find myself having to knock living in New York City, like tone down my shit so they could feel better about where the hell they lived. And after a while I was just like, yeah, I just start agreeing with them. Yeah, you're right. It isn't New York. New York is the shit. It's the Paris of America. You know. It's too bad you don't live there cause it's fucking awesome. You just, you just agree with them. Oh you think you're the shit now could you live down there? Yeah, I know. It's unbelievable. My Ego is completely out of control and you know, just, I dunno.

Speaker 2:          01:12:55       Okay.

Speaker 8:          01:12:56       I don't know what to tell you, dude. That that's, that's a really tough one because no matter what, you're always going to want your dad's approval. Um, but just watch out for the anger that's building up in you and just make sure that you don't start making spiteful decisions towards him about your own life and the path you want to go down because, uh, then you get, you're going to end up in some miserable play. Yeah, you'll start, you'll literally start dating someone just to piss him off. I'm not saying you might, you'll do. Maybe you will. I don't know. Um,

Speaker 8:          01:13:32       I dunno dude, that there's, there's a lot of shit going on there, but you know, I'm glad you brought all of this stuff up because you remember that bit I was doing that. Get out of the pool, make it fun of those movies where they show like racist white people. And this right here is the point of that bit, which is they've made 80 million movies about white people being racist. And I was laughing that that started off with slavery. One of the most horrific things that's ever happened in this country other than I guess the straight up genocide of the the Indians, native Americans are the fuck he supposed to call them and there's been so many movies made about that shit that now it's all the way down to like swimming. That was the joke and I know I like, I stopped doing the jokes wants they're on TV, but I know I said at some point are white people the only ones who think evil shit.

Speaker 8:          01:14:25       I came, remember how the joke when isn't there some Mexican guy making fun of an Asian dude or whatever. This is what the fuck I'm talking about. This is what I'm talking about and it just gets annoying after a while that you take a movie like guess who's coming to dinner when it's, when it's the white girl bringing home the Black Guy, the original movie. Then it's this drama and it's this really serious fucking thing that needs to be addressed. But when you flip it and it's a black girl, bring an Ashton Kutcher, all of a sudden now, now it's a comedy. And, and what's his face? The Dad there, you know, not wanting her to bring home a white dude. Now it's fucking hilarious. I mean, I guess I get it because of a, on some level, because it's not like black people and slave white people.

Speaker 8:          01:15:13       So though the rules are fucking different, but you know what I'm saying? Something I'm just saying, I'm just, I don't fucking know. I don't want him, you know what I mean? You know what the fuck. I mean, I'm just saying it's like I got it. I understand. You know, there's 80,000 fucking movies about white people being racist. How about we switch it up every once in awhile and make a movie about Mexicans stabbing Puerto Ricans after a boxing match. How about that? You know, we ever see that like whenever a Mexican fire fights a Puerto Rican fighter, guaranteed somebody getting stabbed in the Bronx, that's all I'm saying. I mean, maybe that's not a movie. Maybe that's more of a, uh, a short, but a, you know, he could have the hackey characters in there. Right. And what the fuck I'm talking about. Anyways, that's a move on here.

Speaker 8:          01:15:56       Let's recommend, so my youtube videos for the week. Um, here we go. Here's ones that you guys can search. I don't have time to fucking look. I watch all of these, but this is just becoming way too big to try to watch all of these and try to come up with the greatest one ever. My, my, my youtube video of the year is tough. A tough talk in college, Girl. That one. Um, here's some other ones that people are also suggesting. If you're at work and you don't want to work, um, go on Youtube and search killer dwarf, midget Muay Thai fighting. And if you don't wanna watch that and you want something a little cuter, watch a search, Charlie bit my finger, which literally has 90 million views. So if you haven't seen it yet, you're one of those people who not only does not watch TV, but you don't have a computer.

Speaker 8:          01:16:42       Uh, this is a weird one. Dog Malfunction. I went to show that to my girlfriend and she was just like, is he going to shit himself? Like shit all over the place? It's like, no, it's something different. A guy with gun confront skateboarder, I can't remember if I told you that one last week, but that's a decent, that's actually a really good one. And a here's a really good one. A boxer beats up two guys. I love this video because the box or dude is basically what every man wants to be in this video. Basically two guys do something fucked up to his girl and without even without even a moment's hesitation, he fucks up these two. This guy is like, you know who all those guys and like the action movies pretend to be. This guy's the guy in real life. Um, all right, well getting up here in time, aren't we? 37 minutes. Okay, we got to start winding down here.

Speaker 3:          01:17:36       MMM.

Speaker 8:          01:17:38       All right. Here's something sneaky corporations. All right. And I know I keep saying that. I'm done trying to tell people not to use those automated machines at the grocery store. I had another guy telling me how much easy there. Oh yeah. I'm in and out of there in two minutes. Really? You scan a week's worth of groceries and you have them in a bag and you're in and out of there in two minutes. Oh yeah. I'm sure. I'm sure it's, I'm sure it's way easier than having someone who's trained to do it. Do it for you and stick it in a bag as you sit there rubbing your balls, doing nothing. I'm sure it's way fucking easier. Ah, idiots. Idiots who want to work for free. Have Fun. Um, anyways, there's another one sneaky corporation thing. Um, Bill, I share your and Bubba, Bubba, bubba.

Speaker 3:          01:18:21       MMM.

Speaker 8:          01:18:23       Here's an article you should check out. I'll sum up the basic idea of the article. Essentially, here's one for you. Starbucks opened a coffee shop in Seattle called 15th Avenue Coffee and tea.

Speaker 8:          01:18:36       They have nothing blatant to indicate that they are a Starbucks. They've gone out of their way to disguise their company as an independent coffee shop. They even sent scouts to check out independently owned coffee shop. I'm assuming to better emulate them. 50th Avenue coffee and tea will serve beers and wines. It will have cheese platters and entertainment at night. I think this is a new direction that corporations go into these days. They create new brands and new images to trick people into supporting their company. And you can't tell who owns what anymore. So for overrated, underrated, I say overrated. The 15th Avenue Coffee and tea, Aka Starbucks and disguise. How fucking creepy is that? You know what? I Bet I've gone in and spent money to place like that. I was go out there and as long as it's not a, as long as it's not like a, uh, a chain name that I recognize.

Speaker 3:          01:19:35       Okay,

Speaker 8:          01:19:35       I know some of this shit, like I know like, uh, but this is a chain anyway, so I wouldn't eat there with see that chipolte Lei is actually owned by Mcdonald's. But anyways, they, I fucking hate your post lay. I don't know if you've noticed, you haven't noticed. They always open right across the street from like a really good a Mexican food restaurant. That's how they didn't just fucking put those guys out of business. I tried to, I tried to stay away from those, but I'll have to, I'll have to, I gotta be honest with you. I didn't even read the article. You know, that's what I do. Somebody just tells something that's all you gotta do is just tell me something and it becomes here because I'm not going to look at it. I'm on bullshit and I'm actually going to read it. All right.

Speaker 8:          01:20:11       Um, horror films. Bill, after hearing your story about the movie curtains, it brought back memories of a movie that I saw when I was young. It was called the unseen. All right. You guys get to hear the description of this movie and just to let you know, he ruins the ending, but I still have to see this. This is a fucking classic. He goes, I haven't seen it since I was a kid back in the 80s but being six and seeing this one did a number on me for a while. Pretty much. The movie is about three chicks who can't find a hotel to stay in. So they end up at a bed and breakfast type place. Jesus, there's an original beginning to a horror movie. Um, so there's some quote, there's some quote unquote thing that attacks these people that stay there. The part that screwed me up is that the thing that attack them, um, would attack through the oversized air vents in the walls and floors, pulling them through and killing them.

Speaker 8:          01:21:04       So after watching it, I was terrified to go into the bathroom because all of our bathrooms in our house had Vince right behind me. As I took a piss for the longest time, I would have to use the bathroom with the door open in case something would try to get me. I look back at it now and think to myself, what a pussy I was. But Hey, I guess that's why six year olds shouldn't watch horror flicks. Here's to four months of pissing with the door open. All right, now here's the spoiler alert. Everybody. Here's a, if you're going to rent curtains, you don't want to hear, uh, you don't want to hear this last part. Um, and of course, okay. By the way, the thing in the movie turns out to be a retarded kid, that the parents kept locked in the basement and all he wanted to do was play with people. Apparently his play was a little rough. How many of those horror movies are basically,

Speaker 7:          01:22:03       it always comes down to some, somebody being shunned as a kid, I swear to God. I think most of those, most of those horror movies have something to do with the person who wrote the movie, their childhood. A lot of writers, they're fucking nerds. So they had these awful childhoods and then they had like these fucking fantasies of what the, what they wanted to do to people and then they just move it a little to the left and they turn it rather from, you know, just some kid having some murderous fantasy. They turned it into a fucking monster star

Speaker 8:          01:22:33       and then you got to goddamn movie. Does that make any sense? That I just say that retarded people are writing movie scripts. I think I did. I think that's how the math works out on that one. Wow. Let's blow by that. All right, bill question. I love your calm. This is the questions for the week and then I'm done. Let me hype what I got going on this week. I'm going to be at the comedy connection in Providence, Rhode Island on Friday and Saturday of this week. That would be a, what's today? The third Friday is four days a seventh and the eighth. All right. I'm going to be back there doing two shows both nights. He can go on my website, [inaudible] dot com and just click to the link. Please show up and uh, watch my new hour of hilarity. And the following week I'm going to be at the punchline in, um, Atlanta, Georgia and I believe I have the dates wrong. I'm going to be there Thursday, Friday, Saturday. I have it down as Friday, Saturday, Sunday. I have to change that and hopefully by the time you listen to this I have, um, and other than that, I'm going to be in Stockholm, Sweden at the end of the month and that's going to be end of my summer and I'll be enjoying being in Stockholm, Sweden cause I'm not going to be missing baseball. I will not because I am done. I'm fucking, I don't know if I'm done forever, but I'm taking a break. I've had it. I don't give a fuck anymore.

Speaker 2:          01:23:51       Okay.

Speaker 8:          01:23:51       I think what that guy in the white sox said, the coach there was true. He's just like for the love of God, just release, just released the list, you know, so you can just get on with it. You know, I don't understand about these guys. They get on roids and then they get off roids and now they're clean and they're still the same size that they were. The only guy, like I said, the only tie guy ever saw gets smaller was uh, Jason Giambi. That's the only fucking guy. All the rest of them, they look the exact same. So I don't know. I have. Fuck it. I feel like a dope getting all excited the last 10 years, boy. Oh boy. Did you see that? A home run all boil pool. It's all bullshit. All right. Questions. Hey Bill. Uh, let the comedy podcasts I read recently started working at a retail store. And during the hiring process they gave me a choice between direct deposit or a debit card that they provided.

Speaker 2:          01:24:47       Yeah.

Speaker 8:          01:24:47       Basically saying, um, I wouldn't be getting a physical check every other week. I asked why they did that and the lady said, that's just the way we, they do it. Isn't that how you, isn't that the response you always get from corporations?

Speaker 2:          01:25:00       Yeah.

Speaker 8:          01:25:01       You know what, why, why do I have to do it? Oh, that's stay just they make us. That's just, that's just how they do it. So anyways, like every other person I said, oh, all right. And even though that's the way they do it, didn't answer my question. So I guess my question to you is, do you think that this is just a way for paper money to be turned into numbers on a computer? Is it really easier to have my money directly deposited in a bank or say, or on some debit card rather than me going to the bank and physically getting my money. If I may use your reference about it, um, about if your iPod crashes and all your songs are gone, but if you physically had the cds back to back it up, then you will be okay.

Speaker 2:          01:25:44       Okay.

Speaker 8:          01:25:44       Uh, did any of that makes sense? Not The way I'm reading it. No, I'm just saying I would rather get the physical checks than to be doing things online, but I guess that's just the way they do it. Yeah, dude, that's brutal. That's fucking brutal. See what they're doing is they're forcing the herd into a direction. So when guys like me don't play ball with that, just out of, I'm going to have to play ball the same way with those automated machines. Everyone's going to start using them and then there aren't going to be any cashier people and then I'm going to be fucked, you know? So, um,

Speaker 8:          01:26:17       yeah, that, that's what they're doing is they're phasing out cash. So anybody who has any cash hidden in their walls are in their bed or any of that type of shit. Um, that stuff eventually will become obsolete unless you take it out and then you give it to them and then there'll be like, well, where the fuck did you get this? And then they'll tax the shit out of you. Um, and I know a lot of you right now going, well, you should have fucking reported the money anyways and all this type of stuff. And if you really read about the Federal Reserve and all and how fucking corrupt it is there, there's a link on the Internet right now where it's where some guy used to work at the Federal Reserve just called it a Ponzi scheme on television, on CNBC said it's basically nothing more than a Ponzi scheme. I don't know if the guy, actually, let me, let me get, let me get that link for you. Um, if you really want to check this shit out, go, uh, it's called the daily bail.com

Speaker 8:          01:27:17       and all this is, this is when they have the, oh, that's a woman testifying for the Federal Reserve. When they've asked if they have any, you know, they put it, give them $1 trillion and there was no record of where it went or who took it. And they just keep talking in circles while we have a person that is looking into that. But right now I can't give you an answer on that. Like that's the way they answered everything. Do the whole thing's a fucking scam. It's all a scam. What they're trying to do is they're trying to phase out cash.

Speaker 8:          01:27:54       So there'll be no way for you to ever, like everything you do will have to be reported. They'll know where all your money is at all times. And then not only that, they're going to have all your money at all times. It's, I don't know how, how do you know how to, it's so fucking huge. I never know where to begin to try to explain what, how little that I understand about this is just, just, let me put it this way. The amount of money that you've made in your life, how much of it have you actually held in your hand? How many times have you gone out and you work all week and then they just typed some numbers on a piece of paper and then you, you know the check and then you just go down to the bank and then it just becomes this number on a computer screen. The amount of number, that's money, money that's out there versus the amount of money that's actually printed first. The amount of money that actually has gold behind it, it's fucking terrifying. It's a, it's the biggest fucking scam I think in the history of the world.

Speaker 2:          01:28:56       Okay.

Speaker 8:          01:28:57       It's the biggest fucking scam. And when you get a mortgage like I have, and I'm sitting here trying to figure out how to get

Speaker 7:          01:29:02       out from underneath that debt and meet, realizing that me getting out from underneath the debt will actually cost me an extra four grand a year in taxes.

Speaker 2:          01:29:12       Okay.

Speaker 7:          01:29:13       If not even more, I think all the way I worked it out. Yeah. It would cost me, I pay about 24 grand a year in taxes or something like that, and we go up to 28 I can't even remember. I tried to work all of this shit out, but basically my best move was

Speaker 2:          01:29:29       to just

Speaker 7:          01:29:31       take 30 years to pay off a mortgage.

Speaker 2:          01:29:34       Okay.

Speaker 7:          01:29:34       To basically pay 200% interest on six figures.

Speaker 8:          01:29:39       I Dunno. You know what? I can't even explain it. I'm probably sounded like a moron right now. Just, just, I dunno. Read up on this stuff. It's fuck. It's brutal. It's just fucking brutal. I can't even, I don't know. I'm, I'm coming off like a moron. I wasn't prepared to discuss this and what little I knew about it. Now you guys are probably gone. This guy's just a fucking idiot.

Speaker 2:          01:30:01       Okay.

Speaker 8:          01:30:02       I don't know where the fuck do you begin to try to explain this? It's actually funny. Like I'm really stammering right now. I feel like I committed a murder right now and I'm trying to say that I didn't and I didn't take time to fucking come up with a, with an alibi.

Speaker 2:          01:30:14       Okay.

Speaker 8:          01:30:15       Um, I don't think that you should put your money in the bank is basic. What I'm saying, you know these guys fucking, you'd take your money. Okay. He put it in a bank.

Speaker 2:          01:30:26       Okay.

Speaker 8:          01:30:26       All right. They give you like fucking 0.5% interest on it and then they take your money and then they turn around and they loan it back to you with everybody else's money at some ridiculous fucking interest rate.

Speaker 8:          01:30:41       And then on top of that, they come up with these fucking loans that make homeless people qualified to get homes, which drives the price, artificially drives the prices of houses up. If it comes like Superbowl tickets, everybody wants to go. So now a fourth thing, something that's worth $400 face value now becomes worth four grand. It's not fucking worth for grants. So then you go out and you pay like a couple hundred grand more than your fucking places actually worth and you're paying interest on it. And who? Who drove the price up? The bank. And how does a bank make money on interest?

Speaker 2:          01:31:19       Okay,

Speaker 8:          01:31:19       so they dig, just basically created loan so they can make houses more fucking expenses. So expensive so they can make even more money. The whole thing was, was bullshit. It was completely criminal

Speaker 7:          01:31:31       actually. You know what? It wasn't criminal. That was a great thing. It was actually legal, what they were doing. That's how much fucking power they have. And then when the whole thing fucking topples, they make us fucking pay for it. We pay for it and they keep the fucking money. They're beyond fucking corrupt. It's the most corrupt bullshit on the planet. I think it's worse. It's worse than than anything that's going on in the planet right now. It's right up there with genocide. What

Speaker 8:          01:32:00       the fuck they're doing is because basically they're in slaving the entire planet and right now they rather you know it or not. You are financially enslaved. You're fucking indentured, sir. I really sound like a fucking crazy. I'm serious. You're, you're fucking year and a dent might my own guy who invest my money when I was trying to figure out how to get out of this bullshit, he said it to me. This is a guy who actually could probably obviously and a much more intelligent way explain this fucking game. He said, Bill, face it. We're all indentured servants to the banks. Um, I dunno dude. I Dunno. What the fuck happened back in the day when you moved to town. We went from having a house raising party to having a 30 year fucking mortgage. Will you pay 200% interest on the fucking money that you were loaned? And by the time you pay it off, you in a fucking wheelchair?

Speaker 2:          01:32:50       Yeah,

Speaker 8:          01:32:50       there has to be a happy medium. I don't want to live in a log cabin. I don't want to live in a cave. But, um, if you think that the government is above the banks, you're out of your fucking mind. And a great example is when the president tells bankers after they fucked up the economy not to take a bonus, and they basically say, hey, go fuck yourself with taking a bonus anyways. And then he just says, oh, okay.

Speaker 8:          01:33:15       I think that should basically tell you, you know who the fuck is running stuff. So I know that came off as completely ignorant, but read up on it. Okay, I can't, I'm just a fucking comedian. I really shouldn't get into this type of shit. But that fucking question really set me off. It's a, I dunno, it's frightening. It's frightening. It's why I'm trying to pay off my apartment as quickly as I can. I don't think I'm going to make it because of the end of it. I want to have something of some sort of fucking value that I can go out and get a sandwich with. You know, maybe I can rent out a part of my apartment because I don't think money is going to be worth anything if they just keep printing it. They're phasing the shit out.

Speaker 2:          01:33:55       Okay.

Speaker 8:          01:33:55       It's, it's bad. It's bad. People don't do that. Don't get direct deposit. Don't do that. Don't do your fucking banking on the Internet. It's the level of faith you, you're, you're, you're an idiot. If you're doing that, you think you're the only guy looking at that shit. I'll tell you what pisses me off with someone sent me an email said, even if you don't do banking on, on the Internet, all your information is up there anyways just in case.

Speaker 2:          01:34:24       Yeah.

Speaker 8:          01:34:24       Just in case you want to go online now, I don't think that they should have the right to do it. It's my money. I should be the one who tells him, listen, I don't want my information out there like that, but they can do whatever the fuck they wanted. It's just, it's all, it's not your money, everybody. It's not your money. They give you money, you and your job is to go out and get into as much debt as you possibly can sustain. And if you don't, then they just take it from you so you can never become rich and they keep getting fucking richer. That's what the fuck is going on. And this has nothing to do with Republican or Democrat. This just has to do with a select few group of evil people at the fucking top who are running everything. I know I sound like a motto, my fucking mind and I probably am. Um, but I welcome the debate. Anybody who is an economics or whatever who majored in that Shit and you want it, you want to email me and you want to explain to me,

Speaker 2:          01:35:18       okay?

Speaker 8:          01:35:18       I mean, am I wrong thinking that the Federal Reserve is a private corporation that does not have to answer to the u s government that has never been audited. Am I wrong?

Speaker 2:          01:35:28       Okay.

Speaker 8:          01:35:29       Aren't they in charge? I know the treasury physically prints the money. Am I wrong? I'm just asking am I wrong when I say that they are the ones that are in charge of how much gets printed and when and that the u s government or the banks then take that money and have to pay interest on it. And that creates this debt that we can never fucking get out of. And isn't that what happened over in Europe and isn't that why they are now on the fucking euro and are we now moving towards the Amera?

Speaker 2:          01:36:00       Huh?

Speaker 8:          01:36:01       This is me just regurgitating all my Wikipedia youtube shit. That even sounded dumb to me, but I dunno. That's the general, you know what I mean? Um, you know what I'm like right now I'm a guy who just started watching, like it'd be like me trying to intelligently talk about the x games. Then when I went to the x games once and I'm like, you do the backside. Fakey all right, whatever. Let's plow ahead. Hey Bill, I love the, uh, the podcast here. Okay. Bill Hill. Bill, have you ever been offered to do, to be on the show, last comic standing, um, offered to be on it? No, I did. I could audition for it, but I didn't. Um, I just thought it was, I thought it was good for Comedians at a certain level and I thought I was beyond the level where it was good and I would have just looked cheesy on there, you know what I mean?

Speaker 8:          01:36:51       Plus I to, I knew myself, I wouldn't have done any of the competitions. I just would have been, well, no, I'm not fucking doing that. Just challenged me and I'll go up and I'll do three minutes and if you beat me, then I don't have to live in a house with seven other comedians, which would be kind of enjoyable. In other words, I wouldn't have been good on the show. So now I never, uh, I never got offered, but I, I could've auditioned and I didn't think it was for me. All right, Bill. Hey, love your comedy, uh, on the podcast. Thank you. I have a question for you. I need your advice. My brother passed away two weeks ago at 34 years old. All right. This is kind of a fucked up one to end on, but I'm gonna um, needless to say, I'm crushed.

Speaker 8:          01:37:29       Sorry to hear that, man. That's really a brutal solve my condolences. Um, here's the issue. My inlaws haven't said anything to me. No phone call, no cards, nothing. I'm devastated. You would think that them being parents themselves, um, that they may care about me since I am married to their daughter. Um, they will, they would have said something. Um, they didn't say anything. I don't really want anything to do with them now. I relationship was fine before this as good as you can be within laws. I'm just not feeling much like seeing them. It hasn't come up yet with my wife, but she is really close with them and likes for us to go over, um, likes to go over there to hang out. What should I do? Should I just drop it and pretend like they couldn't have cared less that my brother died or do I stand my ground and fuse to go over to any functions until I hear something? Obviously the latter choice would cause friction at home. I'm the first choice would kill me inside the one being to go over there. What do you think? Uh, you know what this podcast is? This, it should just be, Bill just talks about shit that he's not qualified to talk about. Okay. And uh, that includes all that banking stuff. Even though I know on my gut level, somewhere in there I'm right. Um,

Speaker 2:          01:38:47       okay.

Speaker 8:          01:38:48       All right. My Gut is telling me, uh,

Speaker 2:          01:38:52       okay.

Speaker 8:          01:38:52       You're obviously, you're, you're angry right now and uh, you have to go through that stuff. I think the move here is it's a bad move.

Speaker 2:          01:39:04       Okay.

Speaker 8:          01:39:05       To, um, you know,

Speaker 8:          01:39:09       basically you going to be married to your wife for the rest of your life. You don't need the fucking not getting along with the in laws to make it a miserable situation. Um, I don't know anything about your in laws. I don't know if they're not good with emotions. I don't know if they're like, he, I don't know what to say. I mean, I don't know how old they are. I mean, a lot of these people who come from the pre Oprah fucking Winfrey show, especially guys and a lot of women, they don't, you know, they don't know how to express shit like the, when stuff like this comes up, they don't know what to do. So the move is right now is you have to talk to your wife and you have to tell her how devastated you are that your in laws haven't expressed any sort of condolences.

Speaker 8:          01:39:49       And you have to tell her that it's making you not want to do anything with them ever again. And just say that you're putting it. You really have to communicate that to your wife because what you're doing right now is you're already gone through something devastating and you could possibly, through your grief, make your own personal life, which I'm guessing was happy up to this point. Even worse because you're gonna, you're gonna push away your in laws and then push away your wife at the same time. So what you have to do, you have to go to her and in a calm way, just tell how hurt you are that they didn't, that they didn't. Um, they didn't, you know, send a car to flowers or anything like that. Um, some ways I know, ask somebody about this. And they actually brought up a great point that they had some, a friend of theirs pass away and there was so many flowers at the funeral and people were coming up going, hey, did you get the flowers?

Speaker 8:          01:40:37       Did you get the flowers I sent? And it's like, you know, they're dealing with, you know, the, the funeral stuff that they got to take care of, picking out the coffin and all that awful stuff so they don't get a chance to look at all the flowers. So for all, you know, they might've sent some flowers. So the first, Oh, there you go dude. There's your jump off point. You have to say to your wife that, listen, I need to talk to you about something. And you just say, obviously you know what happened. And as far as I know, uh, you know, has your, have your parents sent a card or any flowers that I didn't get? Let her answer that. And if she says she doesn't know, then that's when you go and say, look, you know, obviously this is a big thing to me. And they haven't expressed any condolences and this is making me want to do x, y, and z. That's how you do it. So just use the jump off point, you know, with that question, that's something I've learned in my life was shit a lot less devastating, which is basically the first thing you do is you have to find out if what you're thinking is correct before you go off on somebody. Going off is step two. All right? I can't tell you how many times in my life someone comes up and says, hey, so and so says this, and then I just take that as law rather than going up to the person going, hey, you know, I'm not saying you did this, but somebody,

Speaker 7:          01:42:00       somebody saying that you said this shit, and then you're supposed to do it that way rather than just

Speaker 8:          01:42:05       flipping out. Because

Speaker 7:          01:42:07       if you flip out and they actually sent flowers, you're, you're, you're really going to look bad and then you made already a, a brutal situation. Even worse. Alright, there you go. I'm done. Babylon for a week. Dude, I'm sorry to hear about [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          01:42:17       your loss. I hope, uh, you know, I hope,

Speaker 7:          01:42:21       I hope shit works out for you with your in laws and all that type of stuff. All right. Ah, that's a devastating way to end this podcast. And it's over an hour. These things are getting way too fucking long. And I apologize for all my babbling this weekend. Yes, I know. I am a moron. So I would love to hear from all you economic majors out there.

Speaker 8:          01:42:38       MMM.

Speaker 7:          01:42:40       Or someone who is even in banking. Please. Somebody for the love of God. If you're in banking, please defend it because I got to tell you, I'm not one of these psycho conspiracy theorists who thinks he's 100% right. I want to be fucking wrong on all of this shit. I want to be wrong on the automated cashier things. I want to be wrong and all I want to say that they're actually sitting there going, how can we make less money and pass savings on to the fucking customer? How come I yacht be smaller? All right, that's it. Um, I should like, I should have lost a lot of credibility on that one. I really stammered my way through that banking thing and I'd be lying to you if I wasn't embarrassed. All right. And then is it, that is a podcast for this week. Thanks for listening everybody. I'm gonna try to get the bandwidth up so more people can enjoy my completely uninformed

Speaker 6:          01:43:25       means every week. Alright. God bless you, boss. Yeah.
