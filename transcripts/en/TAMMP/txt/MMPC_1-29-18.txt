Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill bird. It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday, January 29th, 2018 what's going on? Our y? Yeah. Um, all right. Well this was a board, this would have been a boring Sunday because there was, you know, there's no football, right? They got a, you got the week off in between the, between the Super Bowl and the championship games. They had the pro bowl today, which was kind of cool. Look like football in the future where they would, you know, they'd start to tackle somebody and they're like, all right. All right. All right. All right. All right. You know, I don't know if that's the concussion thing or the me too. I don't know what it is. He does not want you touching him. Do not throw him to the ground. I have a special guest to liven up my Sunday there. Uh, uh, Jesus sue one and only two I'd rigs for Christ's sake.

Speaker 1:          00:00:53       Todd, you are one of my favorite fucking people in this business and you are one of my favorite comedians. So is all Azure. Do the appeal. The, the feeling is mutual vendor or you don't have to compliment me on this one of my idols. Dude, you are. You are the silliest fucking dude. You make me feel mature. That's what I like about you, Todd. Rex, okay. Yes. Todd Rex who checks off a lot of boxes in this day of caring. That's right. You do. I don't even know what that means. I don't know what it means either. I'm just trying to be progressive. You would think that somebody would come his fucking way and finally tapped a magic wand on his head and make something happen and say, Todd, you've been destroying it at least three times as hard as 10 times of the fucking order or whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:01:36       The math is all the fucking comics out there. I love working with you, but I hate following you. He was a fucking murderer. Finally, this fucking asshole. He got himself a special that he's taping and it needs some people to come down and then you can, you know, go on and I can open for you can make me sweat a little there. No, no, not at all. Right. He's going to be at the satellite theater in silver lake. Uh, the satellite la.com for tickets. That's all right. Uh, February 11th, uh, you're going to be doing the show. It's a Sunday, but usually come out Dave, which support the all right. Sunday, which is a week after, uh, the Superbowl. Right. So everybody knows that was seven 30 and nine 32 shows, two shows, two shows to show. So you're going to go out there. You fucking, you knocked the first one out eagle.

Speaker 1:          00:02:25       All right, I got it. And then the next one you just go off Cruze. Is that what you do? What you do yours? He like dude, be button of the first ones tightened up. And then I spend the whole night trying to forget that I'm taping one real and stop trying to think like, oh my God, I missed that tag. Fuck. That needed to be documented in the comedy universe. I just try to look at it like, all right, this is just, I'm just documenting where my hour was on this night and this is how it came up. And I want you to do that because every night when you go up there, I don't know about you but I mean I'm constantly fucking up. Jokes are constantly leaving shit out and then it adds to something else and I never think of it. Never think about it.

Speaker 1:          00:03:06       Like I never thought to get you a glass of water before you sat here for fucking hours. What an idiot. I'm going to have to hit pause here in a minute. But um, that's just how uh, I had to do it that way just because I want him to think about your, I wanted to ask you about your thought process cause I was curious. Um, like I know that the night before I'm going to be a wreck, you know, just thinking about it and all the funny guys, worry hacks, don't worry. Acts are already fucking working on their next hacky hour. Yeah. They not even fucking nervous to just, and they'll go off stage with this shitty material and be like, dude, I fucking crushed, crushed in every funny guys. Like who is it? Good did, it was terrible. I do that every, every time.

Speaker 1:          00:03:47       I just really in a round about way compliment to myself, I know him. Um, I, you know, I got a waste to go. People like, I don't know. She used to, you're one of them. Did Beasts. Um, yeah, so I, I uh, someone told me, I think Louis C k told me, and I think you've heard this from fucking bill Cosby. How funny is that? Uh, you heard that, uh, you worked this hard to get there. Um, uh, don't forget to have fun, right? So make sure, yeah. Cause if you don't, haven't fun, that's going to be, you're going to feel better about it afterwards. If you have someone who nitpicks at himself, there's no way you're going to be happy at the end of it. So just be forgiving. Just be the fucking silly fucking hilarious guy you while you'll be fine. Yeah. I'm not really too worried about it, but I just want to make sure that I already can tell you, worry about it.

Speaker 1:          00:04:30       You see, you seem tighter than usual cheese will. I'm doing your podcast. It's kind of a big deal for me too. I feel like it didn't the whole thing. Now that you've peeked behind the curtain, it's just me with a fucking $99 mixer from good test ana. We're sitting here on the counseling, Ernie and Bert, the all I did to prepare for you as I turned on the AC and I squirted some breeze. That's it. I know everybody has these fancy fucking studios. I just did a, I did your mom's house, uh, with a Thompson girl and Christina presents key. I just did theirs and they have this whole fucking studio. Rogan has like literally like a stern level studio. She's and um, I should step it up at some point. Yeah, it was, her house was dope. I don't know. No one can see it.

Speaker 1:          00:05:18       But your house is dope. Oh, thank you. It wasn't when I bought it, but now that I've dumped all this money into it and I could never get my money back. Yeah, this is pretty good. I I, this house was like almost a hundred years old when I got it. Almost 90 years old, I should say. Cool. People live in here before though, right? Uh, yeah. I don't want to talk about that though because then people will fucking figure out where I live. I already have to fucking edit out one of the comments you made earlier. That will fuck. Do people have fucking lunatics? And that's what I'll tell you later. It was just enough of something to make some psycho just turn around and faces speaker and start writing down information. But I'm a paranoid dude. Um, yeah. Anyways. Um, what was I talking about? What the fuck are we just talking about?

Speaker 1:          00:06:00       My add? I don't know. I have no idea. You've been watching any hockey. Did you see my Sean's elbow not to. I was a thing of beauty. It was a thing. It was so, it was perfect. Filthy. He, he's, he got to trip. I know Eddie, he's the size of Barney rubble, so nobody paid. He's not going to get called out like all foods. Probably one of the worst. But dude, he was, and I loved Marshawn and I love the fucking Bruins, but I love him. Come on. He's, but the thing is, I don't like that aspect, like doing that shit. Did you see when a man destroy them? Oh Dude, my God. Ah, that was a brutal hit. Oh, I thought he had like internal bleeding after that cause he kept, he kept skating but he kept skating. Yeah. And he was just going like, it seemed like beyond the wit.

Speaker 1:          00:06:49       The thing about PK and, well, I'm so glad he placed her Nashville not from Montreal anymore. It was, he just as best as he used to. He used to get us all the time and everybody knew that was his move. And I don't know why no one could see, just knew exactly when your head was down for a second. It was two crossovers. He was inside and then all of a sudden he was just in front of you. Right. And he just ended your fucking life for like, I dunno, like two shifts, but um, yeah, I'm, I'm, uh, I always liked that guy. I never take it to the, to the point if there's a guy on a team that I don't like, you know, like when Derek Jeter played for the Yankees, I couldn't, I couldn't get myself to, to get to the point of like actually hating them. It's like the guy is great. Right? It is good. Yeah. All you're saying is, I wish this guy was on my team.

Speaker 1:          00:07:36       You have to watch some hockey watching my son play hockey. He was a beast. Of course. I know you showed me all the, uh, the video of them and he like picked it up in to see who's like playing drums or something. Right. They also play the drums too and he plays drums. Any place hawk, he chooses the kid's gonna be crushing it. Would it get more legs than I am? You're going to be a fucking grandfather by the time this special comes out. Jeez. Where you've been working to uh, adjust. Uh, I just flew back today from Phoenix. I was with Craig Craig Robinson, you know, been totally anthem for like a couple of years now when he's not shooting television shows, which is all the fucking time that got works. Um, so yeah. Uh, where were you guys working? We were working at standup live in Phoenix. Oh, okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:20       I know that place. Five sold out shows. It was fantastic. Had a ball. I did the uh, you know what's fucking, that's fucking nuts as far as like that downtown area, how lively it is if there's something going on. But the second, the workday ends like during the week if you're there like at five o'clock. Yeah. It's fucking creepy. If the sons don't have a game, it's over. Yeah. I love it though. I mean, I couldn't live there, I don't think, but I have a really good time there. Um, I had a good time traveling with you though when we went down south. I was just like reading some comments about the key, give me the keys. Just give us the keys. Oh yeah, yeah. That lady, I thought about that the other day. We went to check in that hotel and that lady was just fucking with the instructions are, Jim is on the fourth floor.

Speaker 1:          00:09:03       It's open from nine to nine. We, it's a continental breakfast, blah, blah, blah, blah. And I'm sitting there going like, oh my God, how long is this going to take? And she's in the middle of to go. Did you just choose the key? She got like offended. She was bad for real dude. I fucking was laughing like I was in high school, man, it was one of those labs. So I was just like, oh. Cause what it was was the fact that she didn't find it funny. It was already hilarious, but the fact that she didn't find it funny, it hurt her feelings. She didn't have to deal with it. And then she got mad all in like fucking like half a second. Then I felt like I was in class again where it's like, oh my God, don't start fucking laughing. Or you're gonna, you're gonna get like the tension or something.

Speaker 1:          00:09:45       Yeah. You also took me to that. That fucking, uh, was at that barbecue place to something. Oh yeah. What does it call it was it, don't say the name of it cause it was terrible. Well what the first ones we went through, then we went to the, when we went to that, we went to that one where it was a giant fucking place and they had like 40 fried murder chickens that you can see. You don't remember that place? It was gigantic. You know all my God, this place is fucking unbelievable. That the place where you ate. And then we went to the Nascar track and then you were like TRX wishing you had a salad. Oh was that in a Charlotte? That was Charlotte. Okay. And we did the Nascar experience. That was very cool though. So let's talk about crossing it. That dude who was driving us around is 20 years old named Dylan.

Speaker 1:          00:10:32       I know anyways as much as a jockey because he doesn't want to slow the car down. I couldn't believe what like what a piece of shit or race car it looks like when you walk up to it. I've seen formula one cars up close. They look like absolute like it looks like if you stepped on it the whole thing would fall apart cause all it is, it's just, it's just an engine suspension and tires and everything else is just the lightest. Did you see the uh, the, the gas pedal, we shouldn't have like a stick. It was like a bent coat hanger. It's like real, it would have like if you had like that just the floor thing, whatever that the pedal is to rest your foot on it, we'll be able to have that in there. That's the difference between you like guess winning the race or a coming in like third row because that fucking thing sitting there with a piece of rubber that's in the way that race that actually there um, NASCAR is not doing well it's not, the numbers are down.

Speaker 1:          00:11:23       No. When I went to the Daytona 500, they'd, they'd painted the seats like every other seat. Like they had like three colors and they would paint them the big it look like this people in the season. Yeah. Well, cameras flying by and you know, used to have it like that was the Minnesota north stars used to have seats like that and I thought it was cool and now I'm thinking well maybe cause nobody showed up for the game and maybe that's why they moved to Dallas. So when I hear all those Minnesota North Star fans still complaining that their team left, I mean if there was people that well there was people there I wouldn't have noticed. Right, right, exactly. You would've been able

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       to see the season. I don't even know how to skate. None thousand lakes say you watching either football, was that, do you watch any of the football? I haven't been, I haven't Washington the football, the only thing that I like of the Washington Redskins and they're terrible number one on the street from Baltimore hosts. How'd you become a Redskins fan? On and off from silver spring, Maryland, right over the DC line and let people are thinking bout, okay, but you know I had grass and it shouldn't my yard and two cars. Both parents or I'm not saying that that's not available at Baltimore. What people think of the wire and the corner when they think about Baltimore. But that's not where I lived.

Speaker 1:          00:12:28       That's why, cause that's where I met you. I met yet the Baltimore Improv with that fucking debt long. He had walked down like that three quarters of a mile hallway, the last mile or whatever. Yeah. That was the worst location ever for a, uh, for a, for a fucking comedy club when he club there, I was all thrilled they'd let me come down there and they asked me if I wanted to close out the Sunday one time because somebody canceled and that was all fucking excited. And I drove there from New York City to do it and I was like, I'm going to get in with the Improv. And I showed up and there was like 10 people there and the owner talk was talking to the broker, never talked to me and then walked out while I was on stage. And I remember being on stage.

Speaker 1:          00:13:11       I think I knew when I was on stage cause I was kind of glancing over like, okay, well it's, that works at Sonic Burger. Um, man, it was deaf. It's really fucking annoying. I don't know why anybody who ran a club, why the fuck you would ever do that? Because you don't know who's coming down. Right. And for all you know, they're going to go on, you know, and, and do something. The fact that she would, I was driving down from me, he didn't even say thanks. Classic fucking club managers, the fat, big 50 inch fucking waste, you know what I mean? But those slacks, that giant fucking belt,

Speaker 2:          00:13:44       well, the Gaberdine, whatever they're called. What are those flags? Call action slacks.

Speaker 1:          00:13:50       Yeah, the action slacks. He uh, yeah, I ran into a number of those fucking people. That's my big thing though. This should I, do you know what? I'm turning 50. Are you really turned it five zero to 49 in May. You do all right. They're young stuff. You want to know what the next year you life's going to be like? I, uh, hopefully it's going to be something like yours. No. Well, I've decided that I'm going to, uh, I'm going to fucking get myself that. Like, rather than looking at 50 would dread, which I'm really not considering it. I, you know, so many of my friends and fucking died then even make itself. I was, you know, they'll record it in DC. Don't tell me he died. I swear to God. No, we didn't see did it last weekend. Last Linda, he fucking died. What?

Speaker 2:          00:14:37       Um, there was like some Carter cardiac event. What are those friends was like coming from Connecticut going down to Florida. Hadn't seen Joe in like 15 years. Stopped by his house and they were going to go to the Improv to watch, uh, Lavelle Crawford and Joe said he had a headache and one upstairs or take something like aspirin or whatever it was. I sat on the bed and like laid back and crows while his buddy was there. That he hadn't seen it. 15 years.

Speaker 1:          00:15:00       Yeah. Isn't that crazy? Oh my to that guy had one of my favorite fucking jokes were about the current food. No, the jokey did when he was having unprotected sex with a woman. And you know, he goes, I'm doing my thing and I'm doing my thing. She goes, Joe, don't you come and me, don't you come and meet y'all job. Goddamn you don't come at me. And he goes, I blocks all that out.

Speaker 3:          00:15:24       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:15:25       Zola's hilarious. I haven't seen him in fucking, I haven't seen him in like 15 years. There's going to be a GS. Ah, fuck

Speaker 2:          00:15:37       yeah. What we're getting at that age where people are just dying. And I was like, you know what's really fucked up is I know you want to do. Since the time that I don't, it's not even like shocking to me anymore. Yeah. I mean like what I hear now, I used to be like, oh my God. But I was at my son's hockey game when someone called me and he was like, Yo, Joe record died. I was like, you serious? And he's like, yeah, I want to know how. And he's like, I don't know. I'll find out. And I was like, all right, call me back. I'm on my son's hockey game. Well have years ago,

Speaker 1:          00:16:02       I know what it is, is the first wave that goes is, it's usually a be bad genetics, bad luck or bad diet. And then after that it's like if you had half a bad diet, half bad genetics, just literally like when the grim reaper is going to get you. So speaking of that, becoming a dad at this point, like I was fucking old as I am. I got it. You know, I've cut back on the booze and, and uh, so I'm, I'm trying to get myself down to my fucking, uh, to my fight and wait and actually maybe get a personally you look fit. Yeah. I, I, I, I took four months off of booze and then for the last month I've been drinking like lightly, but I dunno, I think I'm just too old now because I took those fucking four months off and now going back to it, just, I get to, and then I drink too and I'm just like bagged up the next day. Um, so, I dunno, I think I'm going to go, I was joking that I'm going to go, I'm going to be like staying in my 50 just to like fucking pilates and yoga and tantric sex. Try to learn how to come for 40 minutes.

Speaker 1:          00:17:10       That's how a lot of his music is. His recorded blood. People don't know that when a, it's actually him coming in the beginning of a synchronicity. Is that it?

Speaker 3:          00:17:20       Whoa. Whoa.

Speaker 1:          00:17:24       That's him. That's him. Record them. And I recorded my favorite corner bag and his wife. Right. For the first 40 minutes. Then the last five minutes he just sings this song and right as he comes, that's the, okay.

Speaker 3:          00:17:39       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:17:40       Gordon Gordon. So Gordon Commoner there, Jeez. I saw him at a, I saw him at the Hollywood bowl with Elma, said Gaylord Perry. It's a WHO's the guy from genesis that sank? Sledgehammer. Peter Gabriel. They're real. Yes. Yeah, they both were fucking awesome. And they had like an, I was like, all right, who's gonna? Who's gonna open, who's going to fucking clothes? And they just, one would sing a song and then the next one come out and sing a song and then they would just bolt out there and if there was the other person saw and they would just sync back up. Oh yeah, that's still Peter Gabriel had like synchronized dance moves and shit. It was fucking Vin and then they were bad. But that was part of the joke. But you just see was he didn't give a fuck late. It was like two guys like daughter plays with them too sometimes.

Speaker 1:          00:18:22       Is that right? There's like the violin and she comes out and crosses on the violin. I'm trying to remember if he had a violinist. I just know that he was just like the guy just aged and said fuck it. Or I was staying was you know, still in shape and shit. So pdf data look terrible now dude. He came out looking like that headline headliner that didn't make it. It just doesn't give a fuck anymore. Comes out with like wearing like the same sweat suit he was wearing when you pick them up at the airport, just walks on stage. Maybe you put a hat on.

Speaker 1:          00:18:51       He had to be at a but big ones that you on staying always has one of those fucking those clothes that looks like he's going to do a, what was that movie he did with the Tina Turner where she shaved the side of her head. Oh, my Thunderdome. Thunderdome. I feel like he got a bunch of clothes from that movie that still fit them right. He still has the trailer, the wardrobe trailer, all that Mesh, Spiderman looking shit, flashy underwear peeking out of the back. Shane Shane Mill cert. Well, I saw those guys. They fucking, they absolutely killed it here. I've got to make sure what, 20 minutes. Then at some point I do have to read a little bit advertising, but um, through who's just fucking Internet provider ATNT mine is just, it's just not happening for me here. I think I might, I don't even know who I have.

Speaker 1:          00:19:40       Nia handles that and it's, it's just been on the Fritz. I gotta drive on the, Fritz has been on the Fritz. I've got to drive over to Starbucks, buy something, stomachs. I don't drink coffee. All right. I mean I, I guess stick the coffee has to be amazing line strong as it is it because you don't need to be cafe. Oh, I know. I don't know. Worse wired is all I'm the worst dude. I, I need like the reverse of that. But you go into all of that food, just socks, all of their food just fucking sucks. All right, let me, let me read a little advertising here. Um, how much, how much, how much time are you going to do when you special? I'm doing an hour. Hour. That's it. Do you know, maybe a little longer so we can cut it down. All do as little as I would do like whatever you, you want it to be.

Speaker 1:          00:20:26       I would only do a little bit more than that. Yeah. Cause yeah, it makes your life so much easier for you. If you want to do an hour special, dueling an hour and 10 or then usually just lift a bit or to the same guys that are uh, shooting want special shot on the Evans special. That is, uh, they said that, uh, the owner, they're like an hour and 20 minutes and that they wanted to cut it down to an, because showtime wasn't buying an hour, 20 minute specials. They were just buying our semester. Then you've got to start killing your babies. That's the worst. But he refused to cut it and so they just took it as an hour and 20. So if you watched the special, this on right now is on showtime right now. It's an hour and 20 minutes. Jesus on yams telling the business which way it's going. Wow. Call this. I would have been like, all right, I'll cut it down. All right. Oh look, all zip.

So that's a nine years. Oh by all right. It took me what it was, dude, it took me nine years to really the fuck. Yeah. Yeah. Stupid. I knew in nine months, but I was just like, I don't know. Right. And then also my wife was a little bit of a commitment phobe we're both like commitment phobes yet totally relationship people. So it totally worked. You know what I mean? Right. So He'd lived there, her whole sid and Nancy fucking lifestyle for a while, you know, not married, no kids party. And had a great time. We did that for a while when it hit all the water parks, the matching t shirts. Oh yeah. Matching me undies.

Speaker 2:          00:27:03       It took me forever to propose to her, but I tell you why it, why it happened. I went to a party with friends of mine one night and I ended up spending an ad out in Virginia and I was on my way back the next day, like 10:00 AM. Uh, my wife was furious. She was my girlfriend at the time. We were living together and she was furious and she called me. She already left me a message and I checked the message and then she called me again when we were driving home. And so when I picked up the phone and say, Hey, I was just was out here thinking with my friends. The reason I was like, I'm out here with my friends and spending the night. It's like I was talking to a man, I think, uh, I think I'm ready to settle down in Mariya.

Speaker 1:          00:27:35       Wow. Was she that you had to come up with that? She know that she better because, well, she will now when she listens to this. No Way, dude, I want to get you in trouble. So what did she do? Was that she was like really

Speaker 2:          00:27:52       good. I did want to have a fight when I got home for, for spending the night out. So yeah. So that defused the whole like fight those coming up

Speaker 1:          00:27:59       and set you up for another thousand more in the next year there. Um, I, I just want to fuck did I do and I finally just realized, uh, I just knew she was gonna leave it Sundays off the pot. No, it was some days when I was mad at her. I would fantasize about breaking up, but even in the fantasy of her breaking up when she would walk out, even in the fantasy of that, I would still go, no, no, no, no, no, no. It sounds like all right. I got to make, oh yeah, that's, that's, that was the, Paul Versey helped me get through that. Paul Versey has actually helped a number of comedians get over that. Like, uh, that's, that's thing, you know, you think it's a mountainous, you just stepping up on the curb, which just like, dude, where are you going? Right? What do you do? You know, she's going to be so happy. You're going to be happy once you get through the fucking vows and all of that bullshit. Then you just said a party with all your friends and is fucking great. He was, he was 100% 100% fucking right. So, um, I was gonna ask you, do you guys go out on Valentine's Day and now we don't really sell it?

Speaker 2:          00:29:07       [inaudible] I'm going to chocolates and I'm like that or carbs, you know, we might, you know, we have the kids, so a lot of the times we're just a, we'll wait till the kids go to sleep and then we'll have a bottle of wine and watch a movie or something downstairs. Some corny like that. That's way better. We're going out and go out to dinner. Like, dude, we're so old now. Sometimes it feels like a, we want to go out and have a good time. So we're gonna like we're gonna go out to dinner and then go into Hollywood and get some drinks and maybe go to a dance club or whatever that by the time we're done eating dinner late, do you want us to go home? Uh, and it's a how to you when the other person says that there's this like, yes, yes, I do. Just want to go, I don't want to go to Hollywood right now. Yeah. Like I,

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       I for years would rather drink at home. I got better stuff here. Then they got out at the bar. They always have some shit stuff and another rape you or the praise also. Yeah. And once you're with the person you're going to be with that, they got the worst booze. I'm not interested in meeting anybody. Right. So all I'm going to do is go out there and then I got to deal with like, how am I getting fucking home? This is before like Uber and all that Shit. I been, I been drinking at home the for, for years or something. He was like, yeah, we have what? Bourbon or I have bourbon, whiskey, Tequila. Yeah. There's really smokey I think whiskey, one time I was here, that was probably a scotch. Scotch. Yeah, it was good. Yeah, it was good. Oh, did we smoke cigars?

Speaker 1:          00:30:25       Uh Oh no, no, I don't think we did because that's how I was thinking. My daughter just had her first birthday and I was looking at, at the house that do that, we had like 16 kids over here. Really all, I have friends who had kids and that, cause you know, once you have a kid, all your friends who don't have kids, it's just like they keep live in their rock star life and you're like, you just, you get like six more calls like I, and to watch the kid. And he did. He just, he just fade out and started, you know, they start disappearing. Horizon, you just fade out. Uh, like that band member who's on the first album and he was like, whatever fucking happen that can, and then they, you know, they never see that guy until like the VH one behind the music.

Speaker 1:          00:31:01       He's just so, oh, I am. I even know it. Putting out a second album. They just didn't have a call me and all of a sudden I was just like, all right, get some out. Um, yeah. So I was looking around the living room and we had like, like 16 little kids and their ages. The forward encounter it. Yeah. And just like toys Galore, just shit all over the place. And I was just looking, thinking like, you know, 18 months ago this would have been five of my friends. We would have been getting shit faced watching the game and smoking cigars and just how, like how much it changes in a good way. Like we went to the, went to the park today for the first time I went over, I put, I put her on the swing and shit. She loved it. Oh yes.

Speaker 1:          00:31:44       Squeeze mentally greatest clex was a video of that man because I know it goes by so fast and you'll look back at those pictures with a tear in your eye. Oh, I know. No, I'm already doing it. I'm already like this a part of me that's like uh, uh, as psyched as I am to be a dad there, there was a mild depression with her turning one row going like, ah, she's not a baby anymore man. She's a tod of next year. She turns to her age have doubled in a year. Yeah. She's all, but I see why people keep having babies cause you just want to keep hitting reset. Right. Cause it's so fucking awesome. And I like talking in a positive way about it because when my wife got pregnant just so many people said all this negative shit and like all dual, you know boys league.

Speaker 1:          00:32:23       It's over for you. Yeah. No more getting low cause he blood. No, we'll going to Thailand seeing what's up over there. Like I'll this degenerate shit. And I was just like, yeah, this is way better than that shit though. Yes, no. Today we were over there and I was just like, uh, I was having the best time and I, you know, it was, yeah, it was quite good. Clean Fun is actually getting a little bit of exercise, um, clean. And she kind of took her first step in the park, which was cool. And uh, so yeah. So now have you figured out what the motivation tactic was to get it going through it? I see. I'll tell you what's fucked up though, was Imani, that is the definition of organic in the deaf in the dictionary versus the definition of organic within the food industry. Like they literally changed it like with law, what organic means.

Speaker 1:          00:33:13       Cause I know when, when we're given her like poison shit cause she's fucking so excited to eat it. Like no, no, no, no, no. The shit that they call it organic, but it's really got like fucking this, like, like they try to get you addicted to it, like cigarettes, the same fucking thing. So we had these little puffs that said organic on them and uh, I just noticed that like, we would have like really good food and she would start pointing at the yellow ones, like a lab rat. And then one time I went to reach, just reached for the can and she started like hopping up like, yeah man, give me a hit. So yeah. So, um, yeah, we phased those out. I'm actually, that's not true. We have, we have one more can down, so we're going to wean her off and then, you know, she's a kid, so like she doesn't see it. She's not going to be thinking of them. But, um, I, that's the thing that's, uh, that can also drive you nuts is uh, that type of shit. And then if you have any sort of a friend with a kid in your life that is totally up on all these issues, and then they just, they just come to you. It's like a fucking, it's like this cloud of fear that they just dump on. You go to this website, you have to fucking,

Speaker 2:          00:34:28       but we have friends like that, or at least a couple in, they're fucking annoying. And it's like, and even though our kid likes their kid, we have to like cut them back a little bit. I'm like, my daughter was like, well, what did she coming over? And I'm like, if the kid comes over that's fine, but I can't have the parents come over here to like, did you get your kids vaccinated?

Speaker 1:          00:34:44       How do you handle that? Because that's what I realize now is that you can have like you can be friends with people, like a couple of you and your wife are friends with a couple and then all of a sudden, and they have kids but you don't have kids so you're not dealing with them on that level. But then when you have a kid, the relationship changes now you not only do you guys have to like get along socially when you go out, you know, you both vibe, you got to kind of on site, they gotta be within your wheel house of how they raised their fucking kid. And if the kid comes over and he's a fucking lunatic, like brighten the dog and shit, like going to what? What is this caveman? You got to kind of be like, I don't want my kid acting like that.

Speaker 2:          00:35:21       Right. No, we have a, I'm not saying any names cause I don't want to alienate any people that might be listening to this, but we have one family who has a kid that's just fucking rude and I can't have it and I just, I cannot stand. But my, my kid wants this kid to come over and always like, Jesus Christ, should we let just fucking kid come over and then like maybe they changed over the last six months and they come spend the night and it's a fucking nightmare. What are the rules

Speaker 1:          00:35:47       if a kid comes over and he's rude, like what can you say now to a fucking kid?

Speaker 2:          00:35:52       Did I started just getting serious with all I do. Go back to bed. Go back to bed. So fucking waking up every 10 minutes and calling for your mommy and then I'm gonna call your mommy. No, no, don't call my mom. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm like, then do, what the fuck are you doing? I don't call him say fuck no, no, cause I don't know how I'm not going to be, I mean lending shut the fuck up. You being a fucking asshole. Right. So being a little asshole. No, I'm just, I told my wife, am I doing, he gets up one more time. I'm not talking to him. You've got to talk to him cause I'm gonna Start Getting Mad.

Speaker 1:          00:36:22       Do you remember back in the day, like if your friend's Dad said anything you will

Speaker 2:          00:36:27       afraid of, right? Yeah. Hell yeah. Go back to the room and go to bed. Like, Oh shit, this motherfucker serious and it needs to come down. I hate that they call me by my first name tied. No, they don't said Todd, I'm scared. Can you call my mommy? I'm old school. I'm old speech. He had called me mister, right. That it let me fuck a bill. Bill.

Speaker 1:          00:36:51       You got wait, what's to eat here? Right, right. No Dude. I would literally be like, what the fuck did you say to me? You Little Shit. I won't say that, but that's what I'll be thinking. So that course, as I say, please address me as Mr Bur the subutex he will hear is what the fuck did you say to me? You Little Shit. And then he'll say to his mother and yeah, you

Speaker 2:          00:37:10       right. Yeah this one get a little girl comes over to our house and she was like, she'll come downstairs, I sleep in all morning and then come down to the kids who were my wife and I are, my daughter's still asleep and she'll come downstairs before everybody and she be like, what? What's for breakfast? And my wife was like, well you know pancakes and sausage. She was like, yeah, I don't like that stuff. What else is there? And my wife just looks at me and he's like, this is a bit serious right now. Like go the fuck back upstairs.

Speaker 1:          00:37:34       Yeah. What the fuck out? Oh I would love to hear a kid now he's saying to my mother, my mother would just be, well that's all there is. I guess. You know, I'll talk to you at lunch.

Speaker 2:          00:37:43       My wife's, the boss says, I guess he'll just be hungry then cause that's what we're having. And if you're in, if you don't either, just going to be hungry. It's amazing. I would like, some of these kids are rude to sit and you say something to the parents were like, yeah, she's a little crazy. She's like, no,

Speaker 1:          00:37:57       now that's, that's like when people have a dog that's fucking nuts. Like I did, but I, I quarantine the thing when people would come over except one time I got a little confident and watch to me the dog. Whisperers and then my friend had getting bit j law had got bit by my dog, bit him on his calf GIM a nip. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:38:14       yeah, that dog scared the living shit out of me. One time we were downstairs, she was in a cage. Oh yeah. That doesn't notice. He was a nerd. I was like walking past, not the case with the battle of the cage will scare the fucking piss out of the whole point. God cage of the Darby shredded right now.

Speaker 1:          00:38:30       Yeah. She was a, an adorable hell hound. She loved the hell out of me and about six people and everybody else. She treated as a fucking intruder. And, uh, I would just, you know, it was the smartest, most painful, uh, decision I ever made, but I didn't understand, uh, that I was still going, like I saw, you know, the last two days in a row, she's in town. Uh, it's good that you keep it, like you've kind of still take care of her in a way, right? Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah, definitely. It's kind of like, and I get pictures of her all the time and when, like once every two months she'll come to town and I just take for, for a hike every single day like this. You remember your legs the opposite way? She did. And she does. She does. And, uh, if, when I, when I go out to where the guy lives, if I show up, she's kind of look, cause she's not used to seeing me down.

Speaker 1:          00:39:20       You know, first they see the shape and it's the smell, like the whole way the dog brainworks or whatever. And then, um, then, you know, then she's all back to normal and everything. But I gotta tell you, I was nervous meeting her because of the way she was, because I knew at that point she had bonded with the new person and it might view me as like a threat. I mean the dog was like, dude, that dog it, my buddy said that there, uh, as cleo forsee yeah. Verse he goes to, this should be a 30 for 30 on that dog, that dog's life. Like how it was abandoned by the La River. I mean, so many times this thing should have just been like, you know, like whenever the Olympics come around, they always have like those crazy stories that make you tear up all the shit that they went through.

Speaker 1:          00:39:58       Like he could do that. Yeah. And Dyke as a pitbull be in that big of a pain in the ass like that, those things, if those things sneeze, they get put down, it's fucking terrible. But, um, the fact that she's still like living this awesome life, uh, makes me feel good. And every time I see her, like, um, you know, the dude of God, it was my former trainer. So, uh, and he, he just like, she has her first dog friend now. Every dog, she tried to murder. Now she's like friends with the dog, but like they needed like his level talent, like as he says, jokingly said, yeah, I've, I've been slow cooking her. She's not someone that you like, okay, this is how it is. And then boom to that and it's just been this year long thing that she's now finally ready to just end.

Speaker 1:          00:40:41       Even when he started hanging, she started hanging out with another dog. There was this whole fucking process that he had to go through and, and totally keep an eye on my dog because my dog does this shit where like when she's going to attack, she's in the cage. Wow. She did that shit, but she was out in the open. Um, she just made the decision. There was no ground. There was no warnings going wrong. She just did it. She just, she had, she would just fucking do it. Let me read 'em let me read some of the questions here. All right. Um, taught by the way, you're gonna you're kind of fucking, I can already tell, Dude, you're already wound up about this thing. You're going to fucking murder dude. Thank you.

Speaker 5:          00:41:18       I'm excited about it. I really am. Yeah. I feel like this is like, you know, I've been doing this shit for so long and I'm at the age right now. Like if it doesn't fucking pop for me right now, it's not going to fucking happen.

Speaker 1:          00:41:27       Nah, that's, that's the old dude. That's the old way of thinking. You're totally in control, right? I do this business like it's a giant mall. Okay. And I have my little store in the mall and you walk into my store, hey, how you doing? I tell jokes, I do a podcast kind of cartoon. See anything you like. That's what I'm selling. If you don't fucking like it, I get it. See you later. But when I first got into this business, I would, you know, it's like you're walking around the mall. Oh, we've to this selling shirts. I got to sell shirts. Oh Fuck Day. They get sneakers I got to be doing. You try to like do whatever with the Joneses. Yeah. Fuck that too. Just the way your cartoon is fucking Hilarious, man. Oh, thank you. Frank Murphy and a and vicar. My two very guys. Oh yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:42:11       You went to the UAE to see you wait for the third season where we're editing, editing like feeds. It's going to be out later on this year. I'm not allowed to say exactly when, I don't have an exact date either, but like Netflix has like, you know, they don't like the fucking geniuses of this new thing as they, they, I remember the last time like, well last time, uh, when I had a special coming out there, they wanted me to come in to meet with them to like talk about, discuss promoting it. And I'm thinking like, what the fuck are we going to discus? Throw up a couple of billboards. I'll talk about my podcast, do it. I went in there, it was like bill Belicheck shit.

Speaker 1:          00:42:46       I can't even, I can't even explain it. Like I went in there going like, this is ridiculous that this is just an idiot like me with a bunch of Dick Jokes. And then I just, I, I watched them breaking down to how they were going about promoting it. Like two people who are watching Netflix and they're fucking algorithm and all of that shit judged by what you watched and all that shit. Not saying it's a perfect system. It, it blew my mind. Fucking blew my mind. They didn't know it doesn't do, there's a reason why they're global right now. Uh, and it's not from hanging out with me then. Alright. A peach cobbler recipe. Hey Billy crust king. I like to bake by the way. Really? Yeah. I mean my daughter, he told me that before I made my daughter a birthday cake. I'm doing that every year of a life. Are you doing the non GMO with the no gluten than non tasty for Austin? Oh No. There was a bunch of sugar and fucking cell phone talk yet. Baby seals in it.

Speaker 1:          00:43:42       That's a big politically incorrect cake. Um, all right, dear Billy, Chris King, I'm invited to a Superbowl party. By the way, you know the Patriots are in it again this year. Do you realize if Tom Brady w gets another ring? Jesus Christ, him and Bill Belicheck we'll have more rings than every franchise in the NFL except for the Pittsburgh Steelers. There'll be tied. Wow. And then their entire 50 years, 50 something years of every franchise trying to win one. Did Brady doesn't lose though, just letting you know that, right? No. Uh, yeah, he does. He loves twice to the giants. I think this is going to be it. Just give him the rig. No, no, no, no, no. That talk makes me nervous through the eagles. The Eagles got gotta fucking horrific, horrifically terrifying fucking running game. And uh, nick folds is not a backup quarterback that as a starting quarterback who lost his fucking job and he's coming back like a fucking revenge movie.

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       Did Defense looks, looks fucking great. And I don't think we would have done to the vikings what they did. So, yeah, I dunno. I would say take the, just trying to be humbled at how to keep the gods happy. Take the eagles and the points. That's what, that's what I would do with my money. I'm not doing it. I Edelman's out Gronk out a concussion. Um, m and Dola had the game of his fucking life. Did you hear that song? The amygdala song? It's like that song, Lola. Real. Oh Dude. It's fucking Dijo la though. Now they're playing nick fold in the Super Bowl. That's fine. It may not show or, all right. Hey, Billy, Chris King. I'm invited to a Superbowl party. Don't worry. Just dude's and nobody interested in commercials or halftime shows. Thank God and I am the designated dessert maker. Uh, you were talking about peach cobbler on a Monday morning podcast, but I can't quite remember if it was a recent one or an old one.

Speaker 1:          00:45:34       Anyway, would you mind sharing your recipe with me? Because I want to have the real deal. I'm from Germany and can't figure out if the recipes I find here. Any good hope to hear from you and go fuck yourself. I just googled and looked at pictures and then I found one that looked good was this, this is what I would say. I would say, uh, I would say if the cinnamon, nutmeg, whatever they tell you to fucking put in, add more because they'll always be like an eighth of a teaspoon a court. They're going to make it taste good, but they're not going to make it taste great. So definitely be tasting. You're filling that. Don't be afraid to get a little, a little heavy handed with some of the spices, especially the cinnamon sugar. A little bit of some butter in there. And then I give it a little Dustin before I closed the Pi of the Oh yeah, you gotta it's gotta be a big fucking delicious gooey mess.

Speaker 1:          00:46:27       Um, that's how I do it, dude. Everything's gonna be all fucking baking. I'm trying to get you all right. Political relationship advice. Oh God. Here we go. All right, let me, I want to hear this one. I literally unfollow people on Twitter if all they do is talk politics, unless you rationally kind of trash on both sides. But like, you know, if it's going to be like, you know, so, uh, Trump just did this. It's just say, all right. I will tell you that. Well, I mean, yeah, I mean, trauma slotted, Conan, Conan O'Brien and the funniest fucking joke about Trump. They go, how do you, uh, Andall the whole Trump says, what's the hardest part about the Trump situation right now? He goes, he goes trying to write a joke that's more absurd than what's actually happening.

Speaker 1:          00:47:10       I like OEM Twitter, like Trump on Twitter just is, it's just considered normal now that like a president has the time to, I don't even like people shit on me all the time. I don't even get back to them watching the quote leader of the free world or just so, you know, that wasn't a stain on my tie. That was actually a presidential seal there. All right. Political relationship advice. Hey Billy Willy Concoct, I dunno what that means. That's an, you know, one with a little bit of alliteration to pair. Love the podcast and of course the standup. Thank you. You're the only comic that actually makes me bust out laughing. Well, I'll wait till you see Todd special. So I'm a 21 year old guy and I've been seeing this girl now for about nine months. She's great. Treats me good, loyal, and is pretty, all of these relationship things.

Speaker 1:          00:48:02       They, we start off like a horror movie where that was all sunshine and everything. I'm 21 prime of my life, I think a darker ship. Everything's going great. All right. The main problem I have though is she is a big democrat. Big Democratic problem is she's a big democratic and he's a super conservative. Uh, she's black and I'm almost as white as you. Oh God. This is like a fucking bad porno. She gets upset when I post political stuff on Facebook, like pro a pro video of Trump, but yet she posts all this stuff about kneeling for flags and Obama is all that, uh, yeah, dude, this, this relationship's not going to fucking less. Uh, she wouldn't even talk to me when I wore a Trump shirt. Oh my God. Yeah. It's like, dude, like this, this is a guy who like sort of saw how the Nazis were baited into running over somebody with a car going, well, you know, this hatred on both sides. Um, dude, I really wanted to side with you, but you know, this is, this is like astoundingly fucking like I respect the fact that you like Trump and all of that shit. You want to wear his tee shirts, but your confusion that she gets upset is a little fucking weird. Pisses me off. But I don't want to ruin the whole relationship over something as dumb as politics that's too late. So since you are already in an interracial relationship and for, and for a lot longer than me, period. What's your advice? Question Mark?

Speaker 1:          00:49:37       The lovely mia. It's Nia with an end. Um, can tell me her 2 cents as well, even though she'll just side with the chick. Just kidding. Thanks. And is always go fuck yourself. Ps, Tom Brady's the greatest of all time. Uh, sir. Um, I gotta be honest with you, like, if you don't understand why she is upset, um, you'd have to try to put yourself in her position and then read some of this shit in some of his opinions, I guess would be the best way to do it. But I'm like, you're not just a conservative if you'll be like rocking the t shirt, like you're all in. You know what I mean? Like a bunch of words. Girlfriend hates when I wear my swastika tee shirt. Yeah. Not Nicki. Do you think that's, it's that bad? I mean, he has, he hasn't run like, I mean, no, I mean, no. Is he like, is he like a Trump Hitler light?

Speaker 2:          00:50:34       What kind of booze would hit

Speaker 1:          00:50:35       was that at least gotta be like Moonshine. So where's Trump Jaeger? Jaeger bomb.

Speaker 2:          00:50:47       That's shitty. Bourbon going Schlog. Yeah, he's like God, Lulu flakes instead of gold flakes. Yeah. Johnny Walker red. And there's, there's no, there's no, yeah, there's no,

Speaker 1:          00:50:59       and uh, I have a soft rake to fucking mix with it. What's the worst when you were broken? So what's the worst period of ahead? Yeah, college age.

Speaker 2:          00:51:11       Uh, Milwaukee's best now worn that or natty Boh national Bohemian was pretty damn bed.

Speaker 1:          00:51:17       Oh, you know what I always hated was fucking a Bush light Bush light, which I think Bush itself was just, yeah, that was just like, yeah, it was like water and then they wanted that town. We used to east, I never, you know, something I never got into Pabst blue ribbon because I resented the hipsters that we're drinking them because it used to be this blue collar beer that all these fucking townies drank. And then all these hipster people wearing their a flannel shirts. Well, you know those shirts for a while when they were wearing like the gas station shirt that had somebody else's name on it, where they actually had to do the fucking job and they funded some thrift shop. Like my fantasy was that they ran into the guy who owned the shirt. They just walked up like, Hey, I'm Jim, you know, as much. Oh, I just feel ah, needed to shirt and then he gets the shit kicked out of them. But most of my fantasies are violent. Um, my advice is, uh, to, I dunno, get a bunch of empathy. Uh, I don't know. I don't, I don't see this thing working. I just don't see it working. That's going to be like the kids you guys are, so if you're that far away from each other, you're not going to get married and have kids.

Speaker 2:          00:52:33       Yeah. That's like you'd be fighting over them politically too. Like, so what? They're going to be Democrats or conservatives when they grow up. So that's a whole nother can of worms.

Speaker 1:          00:52:42       Yeah. So enjoy banging her and uh, I wasn't bossy lets you, while she likes you and then I would fucking, yeah, I would just be like, yeah, but he's also 21. He doesn't know. He genuinely seems like he doesn't understand unless that was just, you know, sometimes people just lie and they write and crazy shit. All right. Girlfriend drinks too much. Uh, dear bill, I was hoping you get to help me out with a problem I've been having. I've been living with my girlfriend for almost a year now. We are in our mid to late twenties, just for some background. Everything's going great except for one thing, we worked regular nine to five type jobs, which means most of the fun we have is on the weekend. And like most people we tend to lube up on the liquor while we're out and about or even just stay in and, well I don't think anything wrong with drinking.

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       My girlfriend doesn't know her limits. Often. She will drink way too much, too early and ended up passing out or throwing up though commonly both will occur. Wow. Yeah. She doesn't know how to drink. You got to pace yourself out there. A few examples, uh, she will insist on watching a movie after we've had a few drinks. We finally decide, uh, we'll put it on and then after 15 minutes she passes out. Then I'll have to stop because of course I can't watch it without her. Yeah. Well the teacher lesson watched the whole movie and be like, you missed a great one and in the end the Butler did it. It's a lay off the booze cause I'm going to start fucking doing that to you. Um, number two, we went to a hockey game a few weeks ago and when we got to the arena, she ordered me a beer and herself to double gin and tonics.

Speaker 1:          00:54:16       Oh my God, she has a problem. We had already had a couple before arriving. She then proceeded to down both of them and 10 minutes before the puck drop and passed out soon after at a hockey game by God. That's the fucking problem. I had to drag her up to stand for the anthem and again when they were honoring the troops. This is fucking, this is like a Kristen Wiig character. Uh, she then left for the washroom. That's been one of my favorite scenes though when she gets fucking wasted on the plane and bridesmaids and she just, when she goes, man, the fuck is, and as he's walking out, uh, I see then left for the washroom, but came back with two more doubled gins, a hotdog and a bag of popcorn, which she spilled and blamed it on me. Oh my God. That sounds like a episode of intervention.

Speaker 1:          00:55:06       Even if I did do it, the first thing you're going to do as snitch on me. All right. That just took a left turn. Uh, get the fuck outta here. What's supposed to be a team, but I digress. Sorry for the rent. Uh, last weekend. My God, these are all like bullet pointed. By the way, in the Uber ride home, she per preached, she proceeded to whip out her tit to try and seduce me. I told her to put it away because she was in no condition and I didn't want to fuck up my Uber rating passes out. Wait what? The passenger gets an Uber rainy pass was getting ready to for the driver that might have actually boosted is ready. If the driver will look back and saw as little sloppy today, we fucking gin and tonic on it. Uh, anyways, I'm going to fuck up my Uber.

Speaker 1:          00:55:55       A pet, she passes out 30 seconds later in pukes in the elevator on the way up to the apartment. It didn't make it a lot. It didn't make a lot of a mess as she was able to hold it back before I got her to the toilet. Oh my. This guys just truncate the piece de resistance. Uh, she passed out during the bill burrs show at the Sony Center. Uh, how do you pass out for that create man who just came in to entertain us? Uh, just a pre face. I had an allergic reaction that was toast. Had a little bit of weed before the show and I was able to be fully alert. But yet you are the one that's falling asleep. Jesus Christ. This is like the fucking war and peace. This is like Barfly, uh, saying all this. However, I have to admit that I'm no saint either. I arguably drank much more than I or liquid drink, much more than she does, but I hold my boobs a little better than she does. I probably made her sound worse than she actually is. He,

Speaker 2:          00:56:52       you get to take it all away, down, raring to go back a little. Now. You already been going to look like a drunken mess.

Speaker 1:          00:56:57       Yeah, but in truth, she's a wonderful girlfriend who cooks with Matt for me. Leads to me is very beautiful. Well in fucking live happily ever after, which he's got three seats. She's that puking on the sheets and as you can tell, is willing to come to a hockey game with me. And yes, she did buy me bill bird tickets for my birthday. She's a truly amazing person and I planned to marry or someday, but this is just getting out of hand and I want my weekends back. Can you do me a favor and turn that light on my fucking eyes or a shot here? The Sun's going down here. I'm not trying to have a romantic podcast with you. Um, uh, let's see here. I've had conversations with her before and when she, she's sober, she gets it, but it doesn't stop her when she's drunk.

Speaker 1:          00:57:45       And she would get angry at me when I tell her she's had enough and I can't stop her from sneaking off to get secret drinks with my money. She feels bad and I honestly feel guilty writing this. You and she is truly amazing. I feel like he wrote the first half and then she walked into the room and is looking over his shoulder. Um, but it's tough not only for me, but I know this is not easy on her, but some to her body sometimes as well. I just wanted her to be all right and for us to be able to have a good healthy time. I'm not quite sure what to do here. Am I right to tell her that she's got to take it easy, particularly when we go out because it seems to be working the way, have to set a better example and drink less, if at all. Yeah. I mean, if she's a fucking booze hound, maybe, uh, maybe both. Maybe it both try to, uh, drink a little bit less. She might be one of those people, you know, where once she has a kid, she'll just fucking knock all that shit off. Or

Speaker 2:          00:58:41       Oh God, I could just drive around with those completely where she's a state has hammered all the time.

Speaker 1:          00:58:45       Yeah. You'll have a drunken baby, you know, coming out, fucking stop emailing and Bill Byrd started emailing, drew Pinsky kid comes out dressed like foster,

Speaker 2:          00:58:59       um, use it to do a fucking, I love positive Brooks run the city limits drunk comedian. Oh yeah. It was fucking hilarious. Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:59:09       And he uh, and he never really drank. Yeah. The way I know he had it down to like to that that's back when like being an alcoholic was like, funny, this is how much I have to be careful though is talking about all that drinking made me want to drink. Like I love it. I fucking, I hate how it makes me feel though now. So I kind of, I just lay off it.

Speaker 2:          00:59:36       That would, Craig Craig Robinson didn't drink for a year and then we just had drinks and Arizona this past weekend. We felt like trashed both mornings that we drink. Oh yeah. And so he was like, yeah, I thought I was back after taking a year off. I thought I was back when I'm a good old drinking I think. And I was like, yeah, man, I don't feel good either. I had a headache every day.

Speaker 1:          00:59:55       It's an age thing, like it's really, it's a young person thing. Like it, it, it like,

Speaker 2:          01:00:00       but we had fun. We were down to like, we would do those shows, those theater shows and we would go to like the cigar bars have a drink with cigars.

Speaker 1:          01:00:08       Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I still like, I think what I'm, I, my drinking maybe we'll be, is like a, this year when I go on the road, I think like if I go off for three days, like that Middle Day, not the first night, because I traveled and not the, not the night before, I have to go to the airport, but just that middle one, finding a good place. Um, I dunno that, that might be the, uh, that might be the way I'll do, do you know what I went to last night? Oh my God, I went to this fucking, this eighties, like, uh, all these bands, this crazy fucking lineup was, or the, the real bells was attribute Viv? No, it was like two, two was, uh, what was it? Uh, like drama Rama and with them? Holy Shit. I think I can remember the song they said, flock of seagulls, the Romantics, they were all really their tone.

Speaker 1:          01:01:01       Loke oh my God. Fucking the violent femmes Melly Mel and the furious five for his file. Uh, and boy George closed. No way, dude. It was fucking, it was, there was this, this was at, uh, the Microsoft theater, which used to be the Nokia. Me and Neil went down there and, um, I, it was fucking awesome, but I learned a lot about show business watching those p you could tell like who is sick of singing their hits and who was also like, fuck this, I'm bringing it. And then I also learned, you know, watching, you know, he got to take care of yourself. I have a story about that because I swear to God, Dude, if you see a band that let themselves go, it's like depressing like us because you love them and they look like shit. And then all you're thinking, it's like, oh my God, I'm all, I'm fucking 20 years older than he was when he put that song out.

Speaker 1:          01:02:02       A fuck. We're all gonna die. But when you just see a band come out and they kept themselves in shape and the fucking killing it as much as they older, it's, it's like, uh, like, I'm not gonna name names, but I, I saw one band that made me think like, dude, I'm never drinking again. And then I saw when I, the violent femmes like, dude, they just came out and we're just a fucking tight sick aspen. Like I watched them, I was like, man, I want to go play drums. I want to practice. I want to get better. Like there was nothing like negative about watching the big just came out and find, they flew, they went on up to uh, uh, uh, Melly Mel and, and uh, through his first five who fucking killed. And you couldn't be more of a different band. Polar opposites like literally at the stage would just turn

Speaker 2:          01:02:49       oh yeah, that's bad. As I did that, the I heart radio music festival thing, they have like the bandwidth, the stages of rotate one 80, and then they'd have the band and then they'd do the set dressing behind and then it would keep turning.

Speaker 1:          01:03:00       I this, I loved it. I loved it. They get like a down in Anaheim, they had it and like salt and pepper was on in a couple of people do is fucking nuts. It was you just knocked out like 10 of the bands that I should have seen back then. And uh, you know, they all sounded great though. It was just, well I'll tell you off. It was just one person that I looked at and it was just like my God, but he was still singing great. But it's just like, fuck dude.

Speaker 2:          01:03:25       So we saw cameo like six months ago. Uh, I can't remember what it was like by the water somewhere here in La and Roger Troutman. I remember Roger Blackmun, wasn't it? Yeah. What songs does he say? Um, she's on a brick. Oh yeah, house. Okay. Uh, all those dude, he can't, you know, cause he used to come out and like leather chaps and a cup, you know, it's like the coke spoon around his neck to do it. He's still doing this. Like he, he out with the belly. Oh, not bad. Hips and knees. And he's still wearing a company. He was like his leather pants in the back of look like a diaper and it, and it would come out and he does like, dude was a little, I try to be sexy in a row, swivel his hips up. My wife has died lab and she was like, he needs to fucking stop. Stop, stop doing that. And companies, even when you keep yourself in shape, and he was not going, he was,

Speaker 1:          01:04:19       but you got it. You can't do that sexy shit. I'm telling you. That is a self-involved baby boomer thing that is being passed down like to Madonna isn't un-fucking-believable shame for her fucking age, but when she starts twerking, it's just,

Speaker 2:          01:04:34       ah Ha, what are you doing? Right?

Speaker 1:          01:04:39       Yeah. And then it's like the older guy, which you've got to do is you got to like a isoc to Derosa about this. You know, you got to dress like Dana white when you get older, right? Like Dana White is roughly my age. Dana White, you know, he was a suit. He wears to college. Shirt doesn't have the title, it's a title rather than, so he's a little bit relaxed, but he's dressed like he doesn't look like a creek, you know what I mean? But if he was to show up, you know what I mean? I'm not just putting it on him, just saying that, that fucking look, just so you take a guy the same age, my fucking age, and you're going to try to fucking pull off like a tank top. Like even like when you watch these, these, those P90x things, right. And the old guys are working at the 58 year old guys with the ABS. It's like, dude, amazing putting your fucking shirt on because there's nothing they can do for the loss of elasticity in your fucking skin. Yeah. You're decomposing in front of me with Avocado.

Speaker 1:          01:05:37       They said you'd be sitting in a giant fruit ball, a little, little fruit flies flying around you. So I learned a lot like guy watched, uh, those bands. And it was the people that we're comfortable with their age and kept themselves in shape and came out. And what having a good fucking time. It was just like, ah man, this is fucking granular. Would like you just were really excited. But if they came out like you know, they'd fucking this, this still fucking party and like you know, Keith Richards back in the day and then they come in and you're going to still wear like leather and shit. Um, HD net have this concert series a couple of years ago and there were, so these commercials for the concert series and they would show, they showed Steppenwolf, right. You don't know, you can, God you love me. Then again, and then that middle section that goes on for fucking ever maybe used to work in a warehouse, that whole fucking the psychedelic part, it goes on for two.

Speaker 1:          01:06:38       Sorry I interrupted your story, but there was so like them playing concerts back in like the seventies and there'll be jam packed arena and people going crazy, the crowd and then they show him now like it was smashed cup from then to now. Oh, now they're playing, I'm like an outdoor stage and tire audience. Only about 300 people are sitting on this lawn like lawn chairs. And I'm like, I know cause we're all too well. Yeah. All the people that love it back then are all now too. So I'm just like watching people perform at like the Eggers retirement community. I know, but those guys have like 70 I know it's fucking, I'm sure that guide, the band still sounds great and everything, but then it's gotta be weird having fun with it. Just like fuck, we still have to make money. I'm like, yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:07:20       Well in a lot of those guys they got, they got so stolen from just completely ripped off and then you add that if somebody got divorced and shit, yeah, you're going to be singing that song. I just realized it cross my legs wearing slippers in front of you. I'm sorry. Those are greats liberal. They are great slippers. No, I finally bought some new socks and I just want to, I want him to try to keep a white full one thing for you. I bought it. That's why we're a black socks all that. Well I can't wear black socks if I have on like dark sneakers. Why not? I mean, I can't wear white socks with dark sneakers now. I if I'm sorry if I'm white sneakers, I need white socks. Really? Yeah, I guess, yeah, I have mostly white sneakers. No offense.

Speaker 1:          01:08:02       Um, no, but I think a lot of those guys that, that's what ends up happening. So I think the way to do it is, and I haven't figured out how to get into the game yet, is you get to a certain point when you're at the height of your, your earning power, I think you should already be planning your graceful exit from this business because it's so good. So I think rather than going out and buying flashy shit, fucking hovercraft and all the dumb shit that, that artists by, by stuck buying rent, those man rental units, I'm not buying a helicopter. I'd love to, but I, I can't, uh, I can't justify maintaining it to fucking play this. I got a kid now, man, I can't run smash cut. Uh, thought that at the, you know, what's cool is I'm doing Irvine on Tuesday and Wednesday.

Speaker 1:          01:08:52       You know, that's like one of the other, you know, it's like two hours of traffic. Oh to, yeah, I'm renting a little 22 [inaudible] Bob, uh, Bob go right over it and like 20 minutes. That was fucking awesome. It is. Yeah. Oh my God, Dude. Fuck five. I did my time. I did my time. Not fucking do what it might be yet. Another comedian talking about how horrific the traffic was during the first 10 minutes. How about I go up there and be the comic who's in a good mood, right? That's what people will come and outflows. 10 minute helicopter ride. Oh yeah. That's fantastic. I'll write up it fucking over it. And this is the thing like to look at the parking structure. My land right on the roof of the Improv now, um, we're trying to find, you got to call up. It's like I'm learning.

Speaker 1:          01:09:36       Every time you fly you learned something. So I'm learning this time is like they'll have this, all these helipads so you can even go beyond the airports. Cause I was thinking like John Wayne, he's, he's close by. But then there's another one that's even closer, but then there's like these hella pads on top of buildings and all work. I'll just all around you. But you have to, you just have to call him and tell him you go fly down to the solo. No, no, no, no, no. I don't have confidence to fly at night. I fly solo during the day, but at night it's just a whole different ball game. And I'll never forget one night doing a night flight. I was with an instructor. And how you transitioned, uh, the airspace at lax is he, that you fly under, you're not underneath it, but you, you're, you're along the coastline or the plant like a hundred feet off the water, which is awesome and scary shit.

Speaker 1:          01:10:24       Um, and, or you fly over [inaudible] over like those glow stick things at like, you know, I think it's like a 2000, I'm only done it once, like 2000 feet or above. So at night we flew over us over the supple, that a one and you know, it's fucking freaky because there's all these jets coming in that if you're at the same altitude altitude with t bone, you said we're flying. I go, yeah man, I go the cop a pig, that endpoint, this is crazy. And how big these planes are landing here? And he just goes, yeah, there's one right there. And it was like almost underneath us. But because when you're looking down and there's not a lot of streetlights and you just see the lights from the city, I didn't see like a fucking, you know, Ho seven 49, seven 40 said whatever the fuck they fly now I don't even know what the numbers are anymore.

Speaker 1:          01:11:09       It was like going right underneath us and I was just like, wow, you didn't see that? No, but he did this the right, this was when I was getting my license. So I didn't know how to, to look for Shit and everything. So night flying isn't entirely, entirely different games. So, uh, I'll be flying down, um, with one of my instructors. So, but if it was, if it was like the, uh, if it was the fucking summer time though, but every time, every time it's going to, by the end of the show it's going to be dark out. But that is a goal of mine who I would love to fly solo. Let me ask you this, how much does it cost? It cost you to do that? We'll fly down to, because you have to have like rent the vehicle and pay it. It's like 300 bucks.

Speaker 1:          01:11:52       I mean it's a, it's a decent amount of money, but it's also like, it's not that bad though. I use cover crops. We grow, but no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, nothing like that. It's like 300 bucks. And then, uh, and it's fun and then I get another, like I'll get like another, I'm going to get another two hours under my belt flying at night. And, uh, I got this killer fucking instructor right now. My auto rotations are the best they've ever been where they basically, so, uh, we'll, we'll fly around now and he just sorta like, he'll just, I don't know what go, you know, engine failure and then you just have to tick a fucking spot and you know, you just, I mean, we don't take it all way down to the ground and I land on somebody's fucking front yard, but, um, I've learned so much.

Speaker 1:          01:12:39       I always had great instructors, but this guy that I have now is, it's really got my confidence back up again where, um, for me to go solo and everything would be, you know, I would have the confidence to do it, but I like, but what's good is I, I'm super fucking cautious. I'm not one of those people, you know, we're with the fucking nine oh two one oh look on my face, you know, show up with like a fucking scarf jurors. No, but there's a lot of people that get, they get their, they get their license and once they get the license, they stopped the training. And because it got it well cause they know how to fly and then you know, and then it just, they just start flying around. Oh right. So did you fly your parents? Yeah. Then when they came out here and visit it.

Speaker 1:          01:13:19       But I also did that with like an instructor and that was a, well the impress their parents blown away that uh, they definitely day had a good time and they're very conservative people. So, you know, sometimes you don't necessarily know what they're thinking or going crazy. They won't go crazy. They would just like, that was nice. It was very, uh, very in trouble. I was exhilarated. I heart is beating out of my chest right now. Um, no, my, my dad, uh, had a pilot's license has a policy letter cause once you get it, so like he held cover and no, he had fixed wing. So he knew a lot of the shit that was going on. So, uh, you know, but my mother thought it was awesome. She loved it and wasn't scared at all. My Dad, I think because he had a license, understood the probably more the danger of it and that type of shit.

Speaker 1:          01:14:08       So he probably thought it was a little squirrely when we were a hundred feet off the fucking water flying on any, do you know, the Jetson, whatever. But uh, I tell you one of the great things that I've done in my fucking adult life and um, I don't know, but we're not here to talk about make, we had to talk about you. We've already done an hour and 15 minutes just like that. Uh, I can I, can I come down the 90th day dude or want nothing more than, okay, cool. All right. Well some people, you know, like me, I'd be like, no, I don't want anybody to, nobody had fucking know. So it's just one more thing we're going to do.

That was, that was fucking amazing. Oh yeah, that was great. A lot of the best. They're the best. Hey, so I'll, uh, I'll tell you this, when you do sound check, just make sure, speaking of Patrice, cause I mean one time he, he did some taping and the sound wasn't right and when it came time for him to do his taping, you know, they thought he was a pain in the ass, but he was like, the sound isn't right.

Speaker 1:          01:15:38       And he was like, I want to be the loudest thing in the room, so make sure your monitors, so you know, you got to just make sure that is right. That's fucking right.
