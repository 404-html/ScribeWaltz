Friday, just before Friday. Fucking Monday morning podcast. Just checking. Oh, Narnia. What's going on? You're like, dad, that was a little siren version for you. You know, it's the little things that make your day.

Speaker 2:          00:00:30       Um, all right. How's it going? I haven't done shit. Why does it sound weird? People are going to trash me again. Sorry about last week because a on Monday I didn't have it plugged in all the way and it came out like a fucking 1940s Benny Goodman. It wasn't a stereo is what I'm trying to say. There was no stereo, no stereo for you. But look at Thursday, Huh? Oh, you know, it was, I was, it was a metaphor. It was a metaphor for a Monday. You know what I mean? That everything just seems bleak and there's no way to go, you know? So you don't get stereo on Monday on Thursday, right. Why? What happened? What do you have on Thursday? What do you got? Uh, you got your fucking paycheck. He got money in hand. You can see the light at the end of the tunnel. That broad came in wearing that little outfit

Speaker 1:          00:01:15       fit your Dick's going dough, cheese wearing it for yo man. She's wearing it for you and make a move. Right? So you get Stereo Stereo on Thursdays. Sorry, this still sounds like I'm inside of a fucking 10 can. And I know a lot of guys are saying, well bill, why don't you get a producer? And I just say, why don't you go fuck yourself?

Speaker 2:          00:01:36       I don't do this to have a job. I turned it on. I do the best I can. All right. You know, most of you guys are probably not even saying this and I'm just yelling at you. I don't know why I'm yelling at you. I'm on fucking vacation. I'm psyched. It's two 30 out here in la, which means in an hour and a half, uh, I'm going to watch my Boston Bruins take on the Minnesota north stars or the wild as the kids call them after we fucking lost a San Jose. We're just, we just, you know what it is? It's like we play one period and you're like, you know what? They could be as 16 and then the next period. Yeah. I don't know what happens. It's just up and down and it's frustrating. But, uh, I'm still, I know the fuck. I'm going to watch them. I think they're going to turn it around called Julian's too good at coach. We've got too many pieces leftover from our Stanley Cup. They're going to whip these guys into shape or they're going to fucking dig. Going to send a few people a next thing you know, freckles here might get to try out. I could be a good grinder on a fourth line. Right? Get out there on the penny penalty kill skate nor all around my face is red as a fucking tomato. I do it. Um, yeah, I don't think you could do that. Uh, who the fuck does a, who the fuck is on a

Speaker 2:          00:02:52       Minnesota is where they get it? They got Zach per Reezy who's on their lines. You know who's at first line? Who says second line? Oh, that's right. I'll go to fucking daily face off.com. You know these kinds of, to throw me a fucking hot dog or something, man. I hype the shit out of this. Where am I going here? Minnesota wild. You Click right there and then all of a sudden the lines are looking at him right there. Thomas Vanek, the former fucking save. All right. Did he go to the islanders and that fuck another trade or something? I don't know any of these guys. Mikael Granlund. Jason Palmerville.

Speaker 3:          00:03:28       Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:03:28       Jason. Hey, wait a minute. Where's Zack for easy. Did you get traded? Is he injured? Is He, he is nice. I don't wish ill will on anybody. I hope we just twisted his fuck. Maybe he's got a hangnail you don't. Every time he puts his gloves on it hurts and he goes, oh

Speaker 3:          00:03:46       yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:03:46       try it again, Zach. Oh, ah. You Know Jack, you could shut it out tonight. Maybe we'll get a win. Oh, look at that guy. The fucking right wing on the second line. NATO. NATO. NATO Renner.

Speaker 3:          00:04:01       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:04:02       Yeah. Jason. Um, anyways, let's get skip back to the podcast here. So, uh, I have been not doing shit. I slept for like two straight fucking days. It's all I did. I put on my old PJ's all Billy PJ's, I didn't do fucking shit for two days. I haven't drank, I haven't smoked. I haven't left the fucking house other than a walk my dog and I'm still exhausted. I think that last, uh, the last, you know, you go hard for a month, people, you know, when you're 47 and, and basically a half, if I can say my age, like a little kid, I'm 47 and five months, um, you know, and your drink every night for like a month straight essentially. Uh, yeah, that's going to do some damage. So, uh, I figured, you know, I beat the shit out of my body for 30 days, balance it out by taking four days off.

Speaker 2:          00:04:51       That math works out in my world. Um, speaking of which two, do you know what, somebody sent me this book and I'm only in, I read the foreword and um, into the first chapter and if you're into standup comedy, um, this book so far, it seems unfucking believable. It's called the Comedians, um, drunks, thieves, scoundrels, and the history of American comedy by cliffK , l I. P h nest or off. And I have to tell you already, I'm absolutely blown away by just the stories from the Vaudeville days. And even like in the middle of the book when I'm looking at these pictures of some of these comics that I never heard of. Um, uh, what the fuck is this guy? There was a guy in like 1962 we used to be like a blueberry bluegrass musician and he became a standup comedian. And he did this album called the first family, uh, 1962 von meter.

Speaker 2:          00:05:55       I hope I'm saying his name had the highest selling comedy record of all time up until 1962. And I'm assuming doing his impression of President Kennedy, all right. When the president was assassinated, uh, meter plunged into a meltdown, a mental breakdown. By the way, there's a typo on this, said Vietor Vaughn Meader, they call them Vietor and the next line. Um, but anyways, yeah. So he was crushing it, doing this Kennedy impression, and then Kennedy gets whacked and he's completely fucked. And uh, in fact, I wrote, there's another story in here would that night I kind of just blew the joke, but a Lenny Bruce did not cancel the show. Most people did reminded me in nine 11 while they just sort of, there was no comedy shows for about three, four days. Uh, but nobody, uh, I guess the cancer all comedy shows, but Lenny Bruce did is any way and uh, walked on stage, very solemn and kind of look down at the ground. The crowd was all quiet and he just looked up and was like, man, von meters fucked. Never dealt what he was. I felt bad for the guy. 1962, he was riding high. 63. The guy does the impression of gets whacked. 1965, he's broke flat, fucking broke, can't get a God damn job by the early seventies. He's back in Maine singing bluegrass music. Once again, the name of the book is the Comedians by cliff k. L. I. P. H. Nesteroff, n e. S t like nest. Like what a bird sits in till it gets booted out by its mother nest. He are off.

Speaker 2:          00:07:35       Um, two F's. Okay. It's not, it's not Nesterov it's an SRF, but uh, it seems great so far. And um,

Speaker 4:          00:07:45       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:07:45       Is already just looking at the pictures. I didn't know Joan Rivers was, was not in a comedy team. She was in a comedy almost troop with two other fucking guys and she lasted six months with them before. She's just like, yeah, fuck this. I'm out. I'm so, I can't wait to read the rest of that. But anyways, I have not been doing shit. Um, I just went over and I did a, I had a voiceover for a, uh, for a TV show, which is cool man. You know, uh, did that in the morning and then I was going to go over

Speaker 4:          00:08:16       okay

Speaker 2:          00:08:16       and do something productive and ended up being in a part of the city where somebody show me where there was a good bargain. I got the Burger and then down the street there was this place where you get an ice cream sandwich that has a fucking that instead of having the sandwich part, it's actually a donut. I know what you think it built Jesus Christ, what are you doing? And it's like, I'm on the rails and I'm off the rails. I ate perfectly the last three days I was over in that part of the city. My wife was there. She always knows every good place to eat. I folded. I just wanted her to know that I knew were some places where a to, you know, and we'd already gotten into a fight. We had a brutal fight today. She fucking screamed at me and I didn't say anything because she was right.

Speaker 2:          00:08:58       What happened was, was I was in bumper to bumper traffic out here, right? So we got a green light, but I can't get across the intersection without blocking it. So I'm waiting for the people to pull up as the light screen. So I hit this guy behind me, beep. Then all of a sudden he tries to pass me on the right, like he's just going to go around me like I'm some sort of bitch, right? So I step on the gas if my Prius and we fucking drive up and he's trying to cut in and I fucking cut this guy off. He came within a coat of paint of hitting us, right? But I fucking boxed him out between me and the parked car and he had to give in. So now we're just parallel. Nia screamed like, oh, like a person who was not driving the car and was sitting in the passenger seat, right.

Speaker 2:          00:09:44       Fucking screamed. And initially she starts yelling at the guy and I'm yelling at the guy. He puts the window down. I'm like, dude, what the fuck is wrong? He was a boy. Fuck you still blew the fucking greenlight. I'm like, there's no fucking Ramis. He's like, blah, blah, blah, knees screaming at him. And then I go, dude, you're a fucking psycho point in my own head. You ever fucking psycho? He goes, you're a fucking psycho too. Now looking back, I should have been like I, it's a decent point, but you know, I wasn't, I wasn't in psycho move until you did that Mad Max shit. You fucking cunt. And then this is what kills me. Nia rolls the window up and then the fucking guy goes around me on the left. This time it makes a left and leaves. So that's the end for him. Now Nia is just sitting there like shaking with their arms crossed and I'm like, Oh fuck, here we go. And I just saw, I'm trying to be funny about it and I'm like, Hey Nia, great job. You really gave that guy hell.

Speaker 5:          00:10:39       And,

Speaker 2:          00:10:41       and then she just fucking staring ahead and I'm like, I might get you mad at me. And she just screamed like, Hey, all of us at this side of the car that's site that I was on, like freaking out. And I was just like, yeah, Jesus. And then I wanted to apologize and I started thinking about Johnny Roast beef and good fellas. You know when he bites the pink Cadillac,

Speaker 5:          00:11:02       you know,

Speaker 2:          00:11:03       it's fucking Jimmy's going, what's the matter with you? What's the matter if you and just keeps going. Sorry, it's, it's in my grandmother's name. Like I, I just kept picturing as dumped face. Unfortunate. She didn't look at me cause I had a smirk on my face because that's what I felt like could she goes, she was a hundred percent right. So, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:11:23       like a good 10 miles of silence in stop and go traffic. So that's the equivalent of like 40 miles. If I didn't live in such an overcrowded city and she's just like, you know, she, her face, she has like three different levels of mad and she was at like the top level of Matt and I kept looking over, you know, her bottom lift was still stuck out like a, you know, she laid a little dog that was mad. You know, he's a little brother right before he cries, you're like, is he going to cry? You're going to punch me in the head. You know when you do that, when you push it a little brother too far, he like, he's eating, they start swinging and I start crying. I Dunno. Might want to lean back a little bit. Get the arms up right. She had that look on her face and the next time I looked over it was just an angry face and then I looked over again, then our arms would just crossed. So I know at that point that you can actually talk to her. So I, uh, I try to cute my way out of it. I said, listen,

Speaker 3:          00:12:10       okay,

Speaker 2:          00:12:11       you were 100% right. She goes, that's right. I was, I go, all right, let me rephrase that. You are 110% right. And she gave me shit back again. And I said, all right, look, you are 120% right. And that's my final offer. All right, got a little bit of a smile out of it, but she was fucking mad at me. Uh, I don't know. Then I tried to turn it around on her, tried to say like, that's why I'm successful, because I don't take shit from other people. Like, like that's a situation that you, you, you need to take shit and just let the fucking maniac go. Who gives a shit bill? Why do you give a fuck? Why do you immediately go into like, like a lunatic mode? And I was actually thinking about it when I was driving home, how my wife's energy is so much more chill than mine. And I'm like, am I just like, like a car engine that just idles higher and I can't fucking, you know, I'm just burning through the tank of gas or do I wake up in the morning chill like she does and I just don't let life affect me. No one I let, she doesn't let life affect her the way it affects me. And I actually think it's a,

Speaker 2:          00:13:23       I think it's a little more, the second one. I think I just need to fucking relax a little bit. What the fuck is wrong with me? I'm yelling at the guy. You're a fucking psycho. You're in for, what do I draw? I know that guy knows all that Jujitsu shit singing now he's got me down. You know, he's passed my guard. I'm laying on the street, you know.

Speaker 2:          00:13:43       Oh. So my Prius goes into gear and it runs over my wrist and snaps my watchband but doesn't break any bones cause it's a Prius. Right. Fuck is wrong with me. So it was like a perfect day. I'm on vacation. She was loving that I was relaxed and all of that. And within two seconds, one cunt fucked up my whole day. And what was really making me laugh was that guy was by himself. So the second he went around me and made the left, it was over. He left. And then there I was getting yelled at by my wife for the next fucking 10 miles. And I was kind of laughed to myself. God on son of a bitch. One I thought I won one. I, he didn't get in. I thought I won. I didn't. It did. And I won the first round. Then got the old right there, Fred, when I went to the judges. Right. So it's fucking pathetic. Um, anyways, what a Dick. I didn't think it was him like, cause he had like this foreign car, but it had like an American car sounding horn. So I didn't think it was him. So I was off my game and he almost got around me.

Speaker 2:          00:14:43       I don't know. It's probably stupid, right? Oh fuck you. You, you don't make mistakes. We all make mistakes. Ooh. All right. Let's read a little advertising here for this week.

Speaker 5:          00:16:20       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:16:20       ball and branch. B. O. L. L. A. You probably spend more time with your bedsheets than anything else you own. You really shouldn't skimp on your bedding, but most people do because great sheets are very expensive, but thanks to bowl a ball, a ball, l, l and branch. That's not the case anymore. And when you spend a big chunk, big bucks on sheets with a super high thread count, you think you're getting the best, but what you're really getting is marketing Mumbo jumbo thread count has nothing to do with quality and don't get me started on the so called Egyptian cotton over there. That's just the name of a plant grown in Pakistan and China doesn't mean Shit.

Speaker 5:          00:17:02       All right,

Speaker 1:          00:17:03       the upbringing up Egyptian cotton,

Speaker 5:          00:17:07       listen,

Speaker 1:          00:17:08       you value sleep, right? Of course you do. But whenever you had to a department store, you're forced to pay a huge markup for sheets that aren't even that great. Boll and branch sheets that different. First of all, you can only get them at Boland, branch.com p o l l and branch.com so you know you're paying for quality sheets and that for overhead. And quite frankly then the most comfortable sheets in the world, they're made from it. The entirely organic from an with entirely organic cotton in a nights sleeping on boll and branch sheets. Make sure day so much better. Three US presidents slept and bang mistresses on Boll and branch sheets. These are people who can afford asleep on any brand of sheets they

Speaker 2:          00:17:49       want. I Bet Marilyn Monroe got fucked on a pair of these, probably what she did. Happy Birthday this to president. All right. I, uh, get over there when the boll and branch, they even cut out the middleman department store markups, which means, which means, uh, by the way, up to 800% that you're going to save. So you get an amazing luxury. Okay? We got it to get to the fucking India. Bola branch is so confident. You'll love the sheets. Uh, they'll let you try him completely risk free for 30 nights. And then what? I don't like him. I send it back. Then. What do you do with them? Gross. It's even better if you order right now. They'll give you $50 off a set of sheets plus free shipping. Go the Boll and branch.com and use the Promo Code [inaudible]. That's right. Get $50 off a sheet set immediately by going to be o, l, L and B r a n c h.

Speaker 2:          00:18:43       Dot com and using the Promo Code Burr Jesus Christ. I could barely get through that. Um, I'll tell you what I didn't have a problem getting through is over the last couple of days when I wasn't sleeping, um, me and cleo watched all of season one of peaky blinders and you have know nothing about no robbery. Um, what a fucking show that was. Um, and by the way, if you want to get into it, I'm gonna let you know the first episode and a half is a little slow because it's setting up the story. Also, you got to go into captions and just have English subtitles going the whole time. It will really help you out because, uh, you can't understand. I mean, I can't understand a lot of what the fuck they're saying. And then you, you understand most of it except for the last word. And it's a completely different, like, you know, they say whore har effect can, hi, what?

Speaker 2:          00:19:38       I mean I knew he was calling her a whore because of the situation, but he just said he just stuck his face right now. Grilling just goes, hi thought he's a pirate, like error every meeting now he's calling her effect affecting higher get second hire. Um, alright. Which one to use in charge? They'll be oldest. Roy, I can say that you making fun of me brother. Right? So he's the oldest and you're the thickest so you must be in charge. They got lines like that and it's just, it's fucking great. Um, I watched all of the first season and now I'm going to binge watch the next season as I read this book on comedy because I am on fucking vacation. I'm not playing drums. I'm not flying helicopters. I'm not doing shows. I'm not doing shit. All right. I'm trying to eat right and working out a little bit, but I'm just laying in my fucking bed.

Speaker 2:          00:20:32       Like that fucking dude with the spruce goose plane. What the fuck was his name? Howard Hughes. All right. That's all Billy booze is laying here like Howard Hughes until I feel like getting up again. I ain't doing the Bruins. Come on and an hour and 12 minutes. I'm watching those fuckers. I got Thursday night football. I'm sitting here with my dog, it's the fucking best. Um, best year of my life. Best Year of stand up, the best Gig I could have possibly. And I did on, I'm still flying high over that. It's just fucking perfect. And it's getting to that time of year out here in la where it's cold, it starts to rain this, the fucking air quality's way better. It's not even the small og man because the cars burnt so much cleaner nowadays. It's, it's really just all the dust and sand and dirt and fucking just, you know, Shit from other human beings. It just kinda gets settles down to the ground. It's fucking does a snow cap mountain out here that you can, you can't see most of the year it starts to come out. You know, people start going home for the holidays to city becomes more of the level of population it should be. It's just fucking great. And um, yeah, nothing but nothing but good. Uh, good thoughts that I mentioned. I'm going to go see the king's hawks game. November 28 it staples center. I mean, to me, I feel like in a hockey way that's like a,

Speaker 2:          00:21:56       it's kind of like back in the day when the 70s, when the Steelers and cowboys played where you just like, how many hall of famers are in this fucking game? Um, although the hawks, I don't know why they let so many people go, but Teva is going to make it right. Patrick Kane is going to make it get at least two over there.

Speaker 4:          00:22:13       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:22:14       Fucking, uh, my quick is gonna make it, what the fuck is that guy's name? It looks like Dave Grohl to doubt he's gonna make it. I mean, it's just a bunch of, you know, who knows? Maybe Copa Tar, I don't know. So you get the numbers. I'm not good at that shit. I just know like these are, these are the two, fuck, these are two fucking teams. As much as the Canadians are playing well, and I want to watch them on the package because I don't even know what's a Canadian. And I like watching great hockey. Uh, they're in the east so I would watch the, the, the habs if they played the hawks are the kings of the stars or somebody out there, um, on the west. Cause I just still think it's all about the west. I just, I fucking bastards. They, they'd been dominating forever.

Speaker 2:          00:22:54       Yeah. So I'm, I'm gonna I'm going to check that game out. Uh, Steph Curry's come into town tonight. I'm going to watch him. You know, it was cool. Kevin Durant's said he's the greatest shooter of all time and that sounds like a Versie thing. Like how he says that so early on. But I got to tell you, uh, I don't disagree like this is the one time where I'm like, he's he dude, this guy's, he's doing shit. Like he seemed like the Harlem Globe trotters, but he's fucking doing it in a real game. He's unbelievable. And a, that's on my bucket list to see him live. I can't go to the game tonight, but, uh, I definitely want to see him like when he plays the Lakers, cause I feel like Colby is going to dig down deep and try to have another one of his back in the day games, you know. Um, but it's unreal. So anyways, uh, not boozing, not smoking any cigars and a rest and up. So it's not too hard not to for me. It's not that hard to just quit booze and, and smoking, uh, when I'm this tired. But, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:23:56       I got a feeling of, you know, there's a place down the fucking street somebody told me about has got this cognac that's like, I dunno. I Dunno what happened. Like fucking Louis the 14th get whacked in the back of the head and his fucking cognac slid down his sock and into a fucking hole and somebody found anyway, somebody got a bottle of this shit. So, uh, I'm already thinking I got to go down to try. What are you doing bill? The fuck are you doing? What's, what's, what's, what's wrong with you? Um, but anyways, I'm not doing any standard. I'm not doing shit, so I really don't have anything to fucking talk about. Oh, did you guys see that fucking Guy School? Those two people on uh, on, uh, he schooled me too by the way on my saying schools, I'm not too fucking old to say that. Um, made some great points that the people on CNN could not refute when he was talking about people who are just blaming the Muslim religion for terrorism. Like everybody there, everyone who's a Muslim wants to fucking mutilate women and do all this fucking shit. This guy was just strong.

Speaker 3:          00:25:00       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:25:01       These two people on CNN and what blew my mind is in a lot of ways the people on CNN when it came to the Muslim religion where justice uninformed as I am in a lot of ways, like a,

Speaker 3:          00:25:14       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:25:15       You know, when they were talking about those mutilating women shit, hey, the guy's just going like, yeah, that happens in this country, in this like Sudan as see named like two African countries and they're like, yeah, that was a Muslim countries. He goes, no, they're not. They're Christian countries. And he really just broke it down where it's not the religion, it's depending on what country they would trash and like Turkey or something like kind of lump them in and he goes, no, they don't do that in Turkey. They don't mutilate women and Turkey. They actually, there's women rights and they've elected more women to positions of political power, you know, intelligent and informed, logical, like thought as opposed to these morons that think that they're tough. Who Go, we'd go to fuck, wipe them all out to go to fucking kill everybody. Fucking, if you folk religion, you use fucking chill like dead dumb shit that they, that what's kills me is that CNN is starting to come around too and just be like, yeah, this is like a violent religion and all that. Yeah. Look, look at the, what kills me, what fucking kills me,

Speaker 2:          00:26:22       especially with Christians is the lack of honesty with your own fucking religion. Are you really gonna fucking sit there?

Speaker 3:          00:26:29       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:26:30       Cause if you're going to indict these people because of their religion, then I could go with you as far as if you say all religion, eventually you're going to have some wing nuts that it's going to cause them to do some fucking shit. You know what I mean? You can't as a fucking Krish, especially a Catholic. I should, I'll just speak for my religion here. There's fucking

Speaker 2:          00:26:55       rap sheet. You know when they fucking, whenever you watch like an Nyp de blue or one of those built toto toto shows and they always, there's always that guy. He's got a rap sheet, a mile long armed robbery, fucking assault battery, you know, twisted park and meters off and spending the change that are an arcade as kids spend more days in jail that he has out. That's my religion. That's my fucking religion. Where the inquisition, we had the crusades, we were in bed with the Nazis, do you know, Jewish people. And they were trying to track where the fuck they have debt property went to. I ended up at the Vatican and we're like, Oh, oh is that yours? Oh, sorry. Uh, we will, you know, we didn't know what was going to win. So, you know, we kinda had a, you know, fucking get in bed with Paul people and uh, sorry about that.

Speaker 2:          00:27:50       Pedophilia torture. I mean, just horrible shit. Torture, genocide, you name it, you name it, go right down the whole fucking commandments. They've broken every fucking one of them. And uh, see that, what does that and that right there is the kind of thing that makes me a question, the validity of an afterlife and being judged. Okay. Cause that's what they're peddling, but their actions, they're not worried about judgment on any fucking level. So it makes me think that, you know, well maybe we just go into the ground and we, we decompose and we, we give life to something else. You know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          00:28:39       But they created this mommy and daddy thing, you know, either going to get an ice cream or get a spanking to keep everybody in fucking line. And then maybe they know it's bullshit. Like maybe when you get high enough in the church, they just go, all right. They close the door, you know, and they're sitting there and that stupid getups right. And the guy just goes, look, here's something you need to know. You can't tell anybody or will deny it and we'll kill everybody that you know and that you're related to. All right, here's the real deal. He looks left, he looks right. It looks back at him. He shrugs his shoulders and he just goes, we made it all up.

Speaker 2:          00:29:21       Yeah. Yeah. We just made it up. Not being good or bad, you know, being good, bad. Again, it makes sense. It's the moral compass you're born with, but the whole afterlife is, and we have no proof. We, we have no idea. Yeah. Jesus. Yeah. I mean, he lived by the, you know, we kind of, Eh, we, we hyped it up a little, kind of oversold it. You know, maybe you didn't walk on water maybe. Yeah. Maybe waded into it a little bit and was the first guy to do the butterfly stroke or the backstroke maybe kinda which back then, no one ever done that. No. We thought to be on their back when they swam. So that was equivalent to walking on water and they didn't have leprosy. They just had a, they sat a rash and it just sort of cleared up naturally anyways, but I, they did talk to him, you know, so whatever. But you know, it's also why I don't watch the news. I actually love, that's why I love Facebook. I'm an old white guy. I love Facebook. I love going on it and just click it on the fucking videos and I'll try to get a link out of just don't know how to copy and paste that ship out of that guy. I'm just totally fucking

Speaker 2:          00:30:31       just making sense and not demonizing everybody over there. Whenever they start talking like that, I swear to God, that's just like the, it's unbelievably ignorant and all that is, that's just big business talking, you know, they're all evil or getting the machine going there. I'll ilow he got to fucking do all this shit and spent all his fucking money and then we'll make a ton of money. And when the tab comes along with giving it to you guys. Yeah, go fuck yourself. I'm sorry. That's just my own view by the way. We F is for family trailer is out. And a thank you everybody who retweeted it. We got over a million views between Facebook and youtube. Uh, tremendous positive response to it. I'm very, very excited and um, my phone is going fucking nuts here. What's going on here? Um,

Speaker 6:          00:34:39       Monday.

Speaker 2:          00:35:15       Huh? Maybe to go holiday shopping with all these fucking maniacs and get pepper sprayed. Cause I'm trying to buy a juicer. You know I haven't, I don't have one ounce of fucking sympathy for any fucking idiot out there. I don't give a fuck about your financial goddamn position. Go make a popsicle stick house. Okay? Don't fucking go

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       down to Walmart and sit there with your God damn fucking big gulps face pressed against the glass trying to run down a fucking an aisle with foreign other, the crazed maniacs trying to get a waffle iron. The fuck is wrong with you.

Speaker 7:          00:35:54       Walk in there like a gentlemen. All right, go in there some other time when it's not fucking mayhem. It, why don't you do this? Pay Full price and buy less shit. Why don't you do that? You know, or well, let me guess. Is this incidence?

Speaker 1:          00:36:15       Oh, I'm about to people that don't have any money. Well then you've just

Speaker 7:          00:36:19       shit how you know you don't want. The fastest fucking way to still having no money is to go down to a fucking department store and buy a ton of shit. These people that they're there, they're fucking idiots. You know? I'm not saying that they weren't blessed that they didn't get some gifts from a high up. I'm not saying that. I'm not saying that some of them can't sing a song, can't do a dance, uh, can't fix a fucking motor. I'm not saying that. This is why I'm saying you're a fucking idiot because you're buying into the hype the same way. Those stupid fucking nerd cons buy into this fucking I whatever I pad, Ipod, the new iPhone, every fucking God, damn, six months they get themselves all worked up into this fucking frenzy and they go on the website trying to sell. How many are there?

Speaker 7:          00:37:14       How many of there it's, it's completely, it's false panic. It's manmade. I swear to God. You know what kills me is Walmart has, has an, I have not been able to find their reaction, um, to basically, I mean, aren't they in a sales way? Screaming fire in a crowded movie theater. Isn't this what I mean? Every fucking year I remember this security guard got trampled. He had a fucking heart attack guy died because somebody is trying to go down and buy a fucking he man doll for half price, you know, so somebody can pop the head off and have a toddler get it lodged in their throat. These are all facts. People, all this shit's happened. Alright. Porter ranch. Where the fuck is porter ranch? That just sounds like the one of those, none of those states, right? Just a good old boy,

Speaker 1:          00:38:11       mayor. Meaning no harm. Went down to the Walmart to get some fucking chaps and his shadow on our man.

Speaker 7:          00:38:19       Gotten his challenger and Lily fucking drove away. What the fuck is it? I lost it. Woman pepper sprayed porter ranch. All right. Porter ranch. Uh, would you like balsamic vinegar Grad or would you like the porter ranch? Here we go. Uh, Yukon Porter ranch. Now that's fucking Los Angeles. Get the fuck outta here is in a fluid neighborhood and the northwest region of the San Fernando Valley. See, look at me getting exposed for the moron. I am. That's even worse. You know, I refuse to believe that rich people went down to a fucking Walmart with pepper spray. I'm not buying this one. Have they seen the lady who did it anyways? People stop buying into this fucking crap. You know, take some power back in your own life. You know what you should do on Black Friday? Stay home.

Speaker 7:          00:39:16       Saint Patrick's Day. A bunch of poop morons going out, drinking their faces off, being loud, the green allegate as in these stupid songs with plastic hats and they heads and eventually they're either going to punch you in the face or throw up on your shoes. Stay home like a fucking gentlemen. Go Out, go down to the liquor store, get yourself a nice bottle of Scotch, have a few friends come over, you know, make you corn, beef sandwiches there, you know, and then watch some fucking Irish mob movie. Go Watch state of grace of some shit. I don't fucking know. But you know, go down there for that horse shit. You don't go out on Valentine's, go on a Valentine's, go get yourself Sushi that's been marked up 300% go fuck yourself. You go out on the 15th I can't say I love you on that day. You know, independent thought people on a very low level.

Speaker 7:          00:40:12       I'm not reinventing the wheel. I'm just realizing there's other days in the year where you can go and walk into a store and buy a fucking Flowbee without, they'll get run through with the fucking swifter mop handle. Ah, US just should have said swifter. There's a lesson in comedy without getting run through by a fucking swifter. That would have been funny, but I was, I've got run through whether it's swift or mop handle. It's like I was in a band and I stopped fucking late. Oh, Jesus. Oh Jesus. Bill, you can't even say it funny. Let's read about this. Porter ranch. All right. Porter ranch, the woman accused of shooting pepper sprayed other customers at a busy Walmart store in Porter ranch, injuring 20 was described by police. Today is about five foot, three inches tall between the ages of 30 to 38 with black hair and brown eyes. A police do not have a description of the vehicle. The woman was driving. Well, I'd like to make a guess if I could. Um, I'm going to say she was driving some sort of Chrysler vehicle, probably some rusted out cab forward designed, you know, with one of the tail lights, you know, the backup lights hanging down. Um, Los Angeles police department. Fucking detective said detectives are actively

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       working on the case but are not expected to receive surveillance video from Walmart until early next week because of technical glitches. How hilarious is that?

Speaker 4:          00:41:47       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:41:47       I bet if that bitch went in there and rob the fucking store cleaned out all the registers, how quickly to think Walmart when it got that video over. Yeah. You know we can, we don't have technical glitches. That's how fucking powerful Walmart is. They just told the cops to stand down. We'll get you the video when our lawyers are dumb looking at it. That's what the fuck that means. The how much money we generate for this community officer.

Speaker 4:          00:42:14       Huh?

Speaker 1:          00:42:16       I live in a gated community with my own fucking private police force that has better guns than yours. We'll get you the video when we're good and God damn fucking ready. No wonder Walmart hasn't made a comment.

Speaker 4:          00:42:31       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:42:32       You know, they never used to have this shit when I was a kid or at the very least it was never reported. You know, they'd start to have sales, but it wasn't this fucking mania. I'm an asshole. I got to do that next year. Next year I'm going to hire a camera crew,

Speaker 4:          00:42:50       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:42:51       And I'm going to go down there and I went to just fucking start talking to these people and ask him what is all the excitement about? What do you think is in there that's gonna make your life better?

Speaker 5:          00:43:02       Huh? What do you think's in there

Speaker 1:          00:43:06       and don't give you the sad sack fucking story about how you got kids and it's Christmas time. And if there's no presence under the fucking tree, what's going to happen? Gee, I don't know.

Speaker 4:          00:43:19       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:43:20       Biggie small seed to make it work. Didn't he? He just rapped about being broke and everyone related to it. And then he made a soul, a bunch albums, and then he got shot. All right. That was a bad example. Um, look, all I'm saying is this,

Speaker 5:          00:43:40       all right.

Speaker 1:          00:43:43       There's no reason. You know, you're probably thinking that I'm trashing you for going. I just don't want you, I want you to just have fucking respect for yourself. Like those fucking idiots when they go to a Goddamn game and they'll skip and jackass has come out with the free tee shirts and everybody reaching over everybody.

Speaker 4:          00:44:06       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:44:06       I just wish once I could just have some sort of crowd mind control and as they sat there, you know skipping around with their eyebrows up

Speaker 5:          00:44:14       like ha ha, do you want it?

Speaker 1:          00:44:18       Everybody just sort of sits there staring back at them until it's so fucking awkward. They just have to throw it and then it just sort of lands in the aisle and nobody picks it up. Right. Then of course the people, the arenas like,

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       well someone's going to trip on that. We're going to get sued and then they got to send those skip and Jack asses to go pick up all the tee shirts that nobody wanted and then they're left with the fucking truck load of them. That's what I would like to see happen. Shop trying to get me excited about shit you at Walmart has in it. It has a bunch of shit. What do they really have in their bicycles? Forming grills. Shack. It's rakes. What else do they got? Fucking DVD player. I mean, you can't get one of those for $9 on the Goddamn Internet. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:45:07       I Dunno. I just think if you're in a financial position where you have to risk being trampled to death, where you basically have to go to the store version of the running of the Bulls to get a God damn fucking, I dunno. Grilled cheese maker are running out of dumb shit to talk about.

Speaker 4:          00:45:29       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:45:29       Or a playstation or whatever the fuck it is. If you have to do that, you can't afford it. And if you go out and buy the fucking thing, he just sticking yourself further behind the fucking rock. Why don't you just have a couple of light Christmases so then he can have a better Christmas. You know, why don't you do that instead of doing what? All these fucking dump concent, that real housewife wife show, do you know, pay for that cash money. Those fucking morons who do not understand money,

Speaker 4:          00:45:58       you know?

Speaker 1:          00:46:00       Oh, I'm on my soapbox this week. Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:46:05       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:46:06       Just live with nothing for awhile. As long as you can fucking eat. And you got plenty of water, you find, do you realize if you have enough to eat and you have water, do you realize that you're, you're living better than probably a third of the world just doing that, having a place to take a shit, having clothes on your back, having toothpaste and toothbrush. Do you understand how fucking far ahead you are? You don't need any of that shit. And yes, it's nice to have, but it's not worth going down there in fallen down and having your wig fall off or your fucking ass crack hanging out. All this shit that I've seen dislocate and your knee having some poor bastard trying to hold people back and has a heart attack and he dies. Oh, you saw som too small. I need a competitive edge. Let me go get some bear mace.

Speaker 4:          00:47:04       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:47:05       Like do you want to stand like how caught up into the fucking frenzy you are that you make those goddamn decisions. You know what? You need to be down there. Just go down to a fucking, uh, Oscoe drug to those things still exist. Whatever happened to the old days, leach mayors. Remember that? He's talking about that with some buddies yesterday. Go down a leach mirrors. What'd you go down to the lumber yard? Go make some toys. Like a fucking else.

Speaker 5:          00:47:33       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:47:33       Anything. Anything you know other than, I mean, couldn't you just go like, look, we don't have to say to your kids, we don't have money for Christmas this year. All right, we don't, but I do have money. Take you to a ball game. I'll take us all out to a ball game. All right? It just know this. We're going to have better Christmases, but the most important thing is that we're all together and we all love each other and that we don't get trampled by some hot dog eating jackass with a can. A fucking bear mace. It's more important to me fucking showing up Christmas, you know, dressed up as Santa Claus with a dislocated shoulder and your fucking eyes are all red. Oh, Ooh, don't hug. Santa said hurts. Um, I don't know. I'm sure I'm going to get some fucking hate mail over this. That was so insensitive to people who don't have money.

Speaker 1:          00:48:33       I know they don't have money, but they have fucking brains. Bill, why do you always only have one TV? Cause I live within my means, which is why I don't go down to black Friday. Get trampled by some fucking big gulp. Top of shit with a can of mace. All right. Those people who got mace date that that lady did them a favor. Do you think any of those consequent going to come back next Friday or next black Friday? You think they're going to come down there for that shit? They're not. They got the beat down. They deserved.

Speaker 1:          00:49:22       Which brings me to our one and only youtube video of the week. Did you guys see the, the beat down and Mcdonald's with that dude was standing there and these two ladies came into the Mcdonald's. It's the one right down there on uh, uh, you get off the west fourth street eat train right there down in the village, you know, two blocks over at Joe's pizza. That's a good slice of pizza. All right, right. Did you come out of there and spike Lee's probably filming people playing basketball and handball go, well yo get your New York City right. I trashed him on Twitter yesterday. He was talking shit about my Boston Celtics, you know, so I, I said something but I kept at funny hoping that he would still put me in one of his movies, you know, and I could either play a complete nerdy white guy who doesn't understand black people or an over the top racist.

Speaker 1:          00:50:18       Um, anyways, I give a fuck, get me in a movie, I'll do it. So anyways, that Mcdonald's down there, so these two ladies, they walk into the, okay and they try and buy a goddamn big Mac and a happy meal and they, they, they throw a $50 bill on the counter right there. Major Red Flag. Who the fuck pays for McDonald's with a $50 bill who even has $50 and it's going to go into Mcdonald's? Nobody, there's not been a $50 bill in Mcdonald's since they started that fucking place. So these ladies try to pass this 50 and the guy behind the counter and he starts looking at the 50 and he's like, excuse me ladies, I don't think that this is real. So they go, listen motherfucker, you better give us a God damn fish fillet and uh, whatever, quarter pounder with cheese and give us a fucking change or we're going to fuck you up.

Speaker 1:          00:51:18       And he said, um, I don't think so. And then this girl just hauls off and slaps the guy, slapped some and then the other one and then she climbs up over the counter. Now the other one just starts just really slowly just walking around the counter like, well I guess we got to fuck this guy up. This is what we do. And the guy backs up into the fryer later area and I don't know where the fuck he found this God damn lead pipe. It was like a car. Do you know like in the cartoons when bugs bunny would just sorta, you know, he'd be standing sideways, you'd save a side view and he'd have a problem and he would just turn it to it. To the blind side and all of a sudden he'd have a giant hammer and he hit Elmer Fudd over their head.

Speaker 1:          00:51:57       You'd be like, where the fuck did that come from? Was that leaning up against his right rabbit leg? And I didn't see it. How did Elmer Fudd not fucking see it? How would that gigantic head of his, how did he not view that as a threat? This guy did the real life version of that. He was backing up, backing up and he was next to some French fries and next thing you know he's got this lead pipe. Oh. And he just fucking starts wearing these girls out with it. Bam, Bam, Bam. I got to give it up to those girls. They took a good three, four each and then they disappeared under the counter and he just keeps fucking hitting him. Bam, Bam, Bam. And this lady's got what's

Speaker 7:          00:52:43       and he just keeps fucking going like a fucking like this bitch is screaming. It's like those little Doggie toys, you know those little Doggie toys that squeak that you know, you make those little noises. You know why dogs get so excited? Cause it sounds like a fucking animal dying. It taps into their wild animal side. So this bitch is thinking she's helping shit. She should have been like, excuse me, is that something you really want to do instead? She's gone

Speaker 7:          00:53:11       and this guys, he just fucking, he won't stop hitting him. Will Not Stop fucking hitting him. All right? So you know the shit works. Fucking two ladies attack guy. It doesn't make a difference. They can sit there and slap you around like you're a fucking cartoon. You're supposed to be like, they're women. I need to respect them. This guy said fuck that. Fuck that. And like bugs bunny turned to the side and there was this magic lead pipe and he fucking kicked the shit out of both of them. So of course he gets arrested for assault. Um, and I got to admit, I was totally supporting what he was doing through the first

Speaker 1:          00:53:54       three seven hits. It's the last 19 then I'm just like, all right. All right. Okay. Okay. Neil was saying he actually was like that dude and drive when he stomped at kids. That guy's head in and the elevator, he kind of went to that level, but at the end of the day I'm like, well, that's why you don't go around slapping people in the fucking face because they might have gone to magician school and they know how to magically have a fucking goddamn lead pipe on a nowhere. All right, so this guy is going to trial and I'm thinking there's no fucking way. Then you find out this dude actually has a record. This guy went to jail for manslaughter, all right? And he got out and there's only two places that you can get a job after you've gone to jail for manslaughter. You can either get into show business or you can work at Mcdonald's, all right?

Speaker 1:          00:54:51       You can't get a job at fucking Macy's there. There is a glass ceiling when you go to jail for fucking manslaughter. That's it. Unless your dad owns a company, you can get into sales. You can sell somebody a fucking piece of shit car, but you're not selling a Mercedes. You're going to be at a Sam's hot car lot down the street, all right? Reservoir dogs. Anybody. That's why right there, okay. Before even continue talking about the story, that right there, ladies and gentlemen, is why you don't walk around slapping perfect strangers in the face. It's because you don't know their backstory. You don't know what they've done. You don't know what they're capable of doing. This is a guy who already took somebody's life and you're looking at him like, oh, hey, what's up? Their mic? French fry guy. Take this 50 or I'm going to slap the Shit Outta you.

Speaker 1:          00:55:47       And you don't realize that this guy has been in fucking prison. All right? He probably knows how to turn that piece of paper with Ulysses s grant. He turned that into a fucking shank. Somehow he figured out how to fucking do it. You know what I mean? So these two ladies get an unbelievable life lesson in why you can't walk around acting like you're some action hero in real life. So anyway, so it goes trial and I can't fucking believe it. I'm like, there's no way this guy's not getting convicted. He's fucking, he's a guy. He beat down to women with a fucking pipe. He went above and beyond with this shit. And he's, he has a record. It's fucking over right over. He's not rich, you know, it's over. This guy is going to jail. I can't fucking believe it. He got off, the guy got acquitted. So for once on the podcast, I'm actually happy and I can tell you this, if they convicted him of a lesser charge because he just kept hitting,

Speaker 1:          00:57:08       I wouldn't have been mad cause I would have been like, dude, they were down, they were fucking down and they were down and then they were part of the tile and you was still fucking hitting him. Uh, we have this clip, by the way, um, on the podcast page has now been turned over the new fan page. It's just bill bird.com. You just go to my podcast page. Um, and anyways, we'll have the video up there and all that shit. So anyway, she, um, he got off and they charge the women was shit. And I don't think that they're getting off the property get lesser because there, because they're women, you know what I mean? And that's just, women always get less time, it seems, you know, because at the end of the day, the judge thinks, well, maybe if I give him a little less time, they'll come over here and blow me under my robe. I don't know what the deal is. I told you this story a few weeks ago when I saw that this amazing trumpet player, you know, and I was like, man, I never heard of this guy. And I find out he was murdered by his fucking girlfriend in 1972 and she got out of jail in 1978

Speaker 5:          00:58:16       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:58:17       I would go to jail longer for parking tickets. Then she did for killing a guy, shot him right up on the bandstand, took out a gun and fucking shut this. They had an argument. She left, she came back with the gun and she shot this dude on the fucking band, Stan, all these God damn witnesses. And she did that in [inaudible] 72 it was out by 78 so let's just say they, they, they went, they flew through her trial, set a right to trial. She still only did five and a half years. I Dunno. I Dunno how that fucking works. Um, and I bet she was able to forgive herself, the fucking sociopath that she is and she was able to go on and live her life and then that guy is in the ground cold is his God damn trumpet.

Speaker 6:          00:59:17       Yo don't know if vice for the week number one belt, my wife and I

Speaker 1:          00:59:34       are both workout people, triathlons, half marathons, et cetera. You guys are going to get his and her hip replacements and your fucking early sixties, uh, last year we started attending a class. I'll do, this is fucked up. I remember this one last year we started attending a class to help with this, uh, to help with this or are working out and the instructors seemed like a good shit. We got along great and he works for the same company we do. This is a huge company in, I'm not going to say where, so it's not like he sits next to me or something. Anyway, we really enjoyed this guy's class and he would email all the people that took the class regularly, telling them what they needed for that day's class weights, uh, Matt, jump rope, et cetera. It's P90x oriented. Uh, since we were both on the mailing lists, we knew, uh, his email address. I started to see these things happening. Um, my wife was emailing him a lot. He was emailing her a lot. It was a conversation between them via work, email, which is okay, I guess. But then they started texting each other, oh,

Speaker 6:          01:00:44       GG.

Speaker 1:          01:00:47       And it was frequent. I come downstairs and hear a phone, snapchat and I'd say, who you talking to? She would always say no one or just checking my messages, et Cetera. Being that I'm a system engineer and technology, I called bullshit and proceeded to capture her passwords on the laptop downstairs. Jesus Christ. He goes, I know, but I wanted to see what was up. So I got a password logged into her phone account online and Lo and behold, she was texting this guy back and forth. First of all, do it. How did you capture her password? This is why I don't bank online. I don't do any of that shit. This is the kid's a secure site. No, it isn't. Um, anyways, so he finds out that she's texting this dude. Both of them are texting back and forth and he says, I'm not just saying, uh, during the day, a few times I'm saying throughout the day and up until 11:00 PM at night, even after midnight and while I'm lying in bed next to her, she would always get pissed if I said anything about who the fuck are you talking to at 11:00 PM?

Speaker 1:          01:01:56       Um, we became mutual friends with this person from the start. And I asked some girls I knew and some guys and some guys that I that both knew him and they both said, yeah, you need to address it. So I called the dude one night and pretty much said, stop fucking texting my wife at night. Uh, are, are you and I are going to have a problem. And he immediately shut it down. This guy, five, seven, 150 pounds and not some stutter or anything. I'm six [inaudible] 200 pounds. It could easily stomp his ass out. Um,

Speaker 7:          01:02:29       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:02:30       Oh, let's see. He's an endurance runner, not some super jacked guy. He immediately stopped and every time I saw him in the locker room or the gym, he was very cautious around me and way too nice. Almost like it was his way of saying sorry oof, everything's stopped after that. My question is, was I right doing this, addressing it with him? Uh, basically texting has blurred the lines between what's okay and what's not. Guys and girls always say, oh, it was just a text, but no big deal. But I think that's horseshit.

Speaker 7:          01:03:06       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:03:08       It's this, it's the same as a phone call to me. So if you want to call my wife while I'm in bed with her, go for it. But they won't. Texting is a bitch move, which is why so many people get busted doing it. If they were with a want to, eem emailed each other at work and discuss workout routines, I get it. But having that instant connection through your phone, no matter where they are is a little odd. Especially while I'm in bed right next to her. Am I wrong for putting this bitch in line and telling him to stop it?

Speaker 7:          01:03:35       Uh, yeah, dude.

Speaker 1:          01:03:38       You know what? The only reason why you're asking me if you're wrong is because you busted your fucking wife. And right now she's mine. Fucking you manipulating you, trying to get you

Speaker 7:          01:03:50       she, she's basically almost done. It. Almost flipped it around. You were actually questioning, am I fucking wrong for four fucking catching my wife texting with this other guy at 11 o'clock at night. Get, there's only one reason you text somebody at 11 o'clock at night. Two reasons. Either you ran out of gas. Oh, you trying to fuck them. That's the only two reasons people text at that fucking hour than I. He's trying to fuck your wife. All right. And I don't know what's up with your wife. Okay? Cause you're going. Who are you texting? Oh, nobody right there. The fact that she goes, oh, nobody in slams the fucking phone shot right there. She knows she's doing something that ain't fucking cool. This is a very fucking touchy subject. All right? Because this involves the woman cheating and guys solve problems with violence. So I'm not trying to fucking egg you on here, sir, but you definitely did the right thing and that's really a what the fuck situation that you're in. That ain't fucking cool. All right, I'm going to step outside of your situation now, sir. All right. Other than that,

Speaker 1:          01:04:57       say that you 100% did the right thing and do not let her fucking worm her way out of it.

Speaker 7:          01:05:05       Okay?

Speaker 1:          01:05:05       All right. Personally speaking now, now I'm talking about make stepping away from this story. If I caught my girl doing it, that's a fucking rap. It's over. The relationship is fucking go fuck yourself. All right, it's over. It's over. I know where the fuck this is going. I know where the hell this is. Lee. What the fuck he Texas guy for 11 o'clock at night. You want to suck his dick? Why? W w what was he telling you? How to do the the perfect jumping Jack at 1130 at night? He couldn't tell you that. If four he has to email you, text you fucking 9,000 times during the course of the day to tell you how to do a fucking pushup. Give me a fucking break. You're flirting with this guy. You want to fuck them. So relationship is over. Happy fucking bum buddied up on Mudita. Mudita right. That be trails too. You get the fuck out of here. It's over.

Speaker 1:          01:06:02       That's that's, that's how you got to handle it. Then the same way fucking Colbys wife when she busted him cheating rather than taking that big tweety bird diamond that she got from him. Sheets that right there, the relationship, it's fucking over. It's fucking over. Trust is gone. It's fucking over. But he's worth hundreds of millions of dollars, which for some reason she's entitled to half of it. So she stuck around. She stuck around, put in her 10 years now he has to pay for her fucking life for the rest of her life. He has to fucking support her, but she's a God damn child and it's legal. Somebody please justify that. I'll never get over it. People, I'll keep going back to it. To one of you motherfuckers can morally justify the reasoning behind that fucking law. Please stop wasting my time by telling me what the law is in speculating.

Speaker 1:          01:06:54       Well, at the tables were flipped, Colby, what had done ad caught caught. I'm not saying who would have done what I'm saying morally. Tell me the reasoning behind that fucking law. Okay. The only thing I can think of is that back in the day guys would start families and then jump on the horse and say, I'm fucking Outta here. And they just left. And then you had this poor woman with four kids and they were in poverty. I get that. You want to fucking avoid that. Okay. If that's what the justify, if you're going to try and justify it that way, I get it. But what I would like to introduce is a, is a, uh, a new modification of that law with is some sort of salary cap. Okay. I don't think just because you married somebody who's rich, man or woman, that that gives you the fucking right to sit on your goddamn ass for the rest of your fucking life and get arrogant license plates say in his money, her money.

Speaker 1:          01:07:50       I didn't pay for it. Ha ha ha. I mean right there. You wonder why people get killed. That's the kind of shit right there. That's two minutes for instigating right there. If he comes over and fucking slaps the Goddamn spit out of your mouth, what did you do it? Look at her license plate, your honor. Eh? You know what? That makes sense. The fuck is wrong with you. What do you have that license plate for? That's not how it works. I don't care that she's being a cunt. That's no excuse for treating or like one

Speaker 6:          01:08:31       hello. No, no. Geez.
