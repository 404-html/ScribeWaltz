Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It is time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday, September 26th, 2016 what's going on? Oh Wow. Yesterday, September 25th was the 36th anniversary of the death of John Bonham. Why do I know that? Because I'm a nerd. Um, all right, let's get into the podcast this week. Now. I don't have a lot of time to fucking sit here and try and brighten up you God damn Monday. Okay. I've been doing these podcasts for since 2007. All right. At some point I have to kick you people out of the nest and you have to learn how to find your own chuckles, your own happiness on a Monday. Um, I don't know. I'm talking about anyways, let's just get right into it. People last Thursday evening, if you owned a television and you had it on, okay. If you're not one of those annoying readers, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:01:04       You know annoying readers are, they can't just go and do it. They got to let everybody know. You know, I don't watch TV. Oh, good. Good. Well, guess what, now we have nothing to talk about because I don't give a fuck about, uh, you know, this, I this a little, I read, I can't even name an author other than like Stephen King and I know he's not one of the classics, you know. Well, maybe he will be someday. Maybe the dead zone will be right up there with a, who's the guys fuck Crispus addicts set the guy who started the revolutionary war. Was he the first guy who was killed or did he write scrooge? Now what the fuck was that guy's name? And now I know it was Christopher Christopher something. I read the fucking book. I read it, you know something. I read a bunch of classics as I was sick of people bringing them up and I didn't know what they will, you know, the, the, the, the prince and the pauper.

Speaker 1:          00:01:51       I read that one. I read, uh, the Count of Monte Cristo, which was like a fucking 600 page book. I read the whole fucking thing with my add. I mean, it took, it took forever. Um, great book. Uh, I give it a thumbs up Moby Dick. I couldn't get through the fucking thing cause they kept breaking down, wailing like I had nothing better to do. Right? Like there was no TV and internet and all that shit in my life. Like back the books from back then if you get like the original like copy of it, like how it was actually written. You understand the astounding level of fucking boredom. You know, you just, you had no, you didn't have a car, you didn't have any money. You'd be lucky if you had fucking shoes. Okay. And if somebody was nice enough to actually teach you how to read, you had a book like your heart was fucking racing. Oh my God. If I have a book right and you fucking, you get excited. You know, you always that book, one of those Huck Finn, Tom Sawyer, things they give you whitewash the whole fence. We'll give you an apple. And he was excited. There weren't any, snickers is a fucking apple nature. Sugar is a sake. Right? And he was all fucking independent. All fucking fence for an apple. I love the apples are free. Just walk up to the God damn train. You take it. Right.

Speaker 1:          00:03:17       So I got this country was taken right. We just walked wide up. We just talk it. Hey, you guys were already here. Yeah, move out. Clear, clear it out. Keep Bobot back it up. Back it up. White people,

Speaker 2:          00:03:31       right?

Speaker 1:          00:03:34       It's probably the nicest way genocide was ever described. Hey, could you guys just back it up a little bit? Um, yeah, but now, now you know, now there's no reason to read and pretty soon there's going to be no reason to even interact with other human beings. Now when they make these not only these, these sex suits that they're working on so vigorously, I believe in Asia. As far as the video said, I've seen no, no. None of this believer it or not. It's really been researched. I can't remember who the fuck that was one of you lunatics who sent me the thing, or if I saw it on TV, I never remember how I get information, but I distinctly remember seeing somebody laying down in his suit. It actually, it might've been the writer's room and F is for family. I don't know. I don't have any fucking short term memory anymore. Right. It's probably all the fucking Gmos in my food. According to the Hippie people down there at the farmer's market who go, look man, this is, this is how big a chicken supposed to be, man.

Speaker 2:          00:04:41       It was fucking Gmos, man. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:04:47       I dunno if this GMOs in my food or not. You know why? Cause they're flavorless. You can't taste them. You'd think if somebody was putting something in your food, you'd be like, oh, well what is that? What is that? I don't know how their flavors, it's kind of weird.

Speaker 2:          00:05:02       Anyways,

Speaker 1:          00:05:05       the fuck was I talking about? Oh yeah. So this fucking guy was laying down in s it looked like he was, uh, he was wearing one of those, remember that gimp from at Tarantino movie, right? Fast Times at Ridgemont high with the fuck is a pulp fiction right there. The gimp. And we had a gimp suit on, except it was like white. And I don't know if they just covered up his face so you, he wouldn't know his identity. But he was like, he had this, this fucking mummy thing on. He had the virtual reality glasses and then there was something on his dick. I Dunno what I was doing. It was like the fleshlight except there was the automatic version. No, be a flashlight is automatic. That's battery powered. Right. That is the creepiest God damn fucking thing in the, in the, in the history of man, I'm a Thomas doing a podcast.

Speaker 1:          00:05:54       This person had one and he goes, look at this, check this account. It was like, it was like he put your Dick in that anyways to do was just lay it in that when I'm trying to say is they're working on these fucking virtual reality sex suits. Okay. So once these stakes, they get them to a fucking level. Like look how good they've made video games. Okay. And I haven't played since grand theft auto three because that game was so fucking great. It just took over my life. I can't imagine what it's, what they like now. So what I'm saying is,

Speaker 2:          00:06:25       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:06:26       once they have the sexy things going on, like the, you're going to, you're going to deal with your wife.

Speaker 2:          00:06:32       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:06:32       Does she even have a wife?

Speaker 2:          00:06:35       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:06:35       I don't wanna hear that horse shit about companionship and Blahblahblahblahblah and all of that crap. You get that all out of the way when you put on your mommy suit. You know what I mean? You laid out, you fucking dial up whatever you, yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:06:48       I want to, I want to be in, I want to be in a pizza parlor. I want to have fucking Mozzarella sticks, fright and then use chick comes over and goes, here's your check in. And I say, yeah, he got the money and then for some reason she, yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:07:03       blows me, but it can I dial up where I can actually also be eating the Mozzarella sticks and, and you know, Siri will be in there and be like, I don't think that'll be a problem. Dang. And then it's going to be happening when you can fucking do that in the future. It's a wrap. It's fucking over. You know what I mean? I wonder if he gave like a sex offender, like one of those suits, what he'd stop fucking trying to snatch people, you know, be like, dude, dial up whatever you want. You fucking lunatic. Just stay away from us.

Speaker 2:          00:07:39       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:39       Probably wouldn't, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:07:43       Cause at the end of the day, oh, you know, something, you know, it'd be fucking hilarious. His book readers would actually still be fucking real. People pick. Yeah. You know, I don't have a sexy when I'm just, I like the actual, you know, I thought the person was better. It's like we just shut the fuck up. Wow. I don't know what the hell just happened. I don't know how I got on that. What does that fucking eight minutes a shit. All right. 52 to go. It's not bad. I was saying, if you were near a television view and Eric Goddamn TV, do you have a TV in your life? Okay. If you're not one of these fucking readers, these people who are informed, these people who know who their governor is, you know what I mean? They know all the words to the national anthem. Uh, you know, they've memorized all the flags around the world. You know, those people, they just can't get enough of doing excrutiatingly boring things. You know,

Speaker 1:          00:08:39       they, they fucking, they the kinds of people that when they buy something they like read the instructions, the whole fucking book. Leanne, they know how their whole phone works. All of these are all, these are all the people that you know, you don't really hate them, which is you really, you hate yourself because you know that doing the right thing. There's nothing worse than when you're a fucking dope like me to be near somebody that is doing the right thing. Cause when you see them doing the right thing, there's that voice in the back of your head that you really try to drown out. You know that saying like, Bill, that's, that's what you should be doing. You know, you should be doing that. Right. You know, if you did that, you know, you'd stop having these ridiculous rants about technology and how fucking stupid it is.

Speaker 1:          00:09:23       The reality is, is you lacked the focus to get through an eight page pamphlet, most of which are pictures with arrows pointing at the shit that the words are talking about. You can't get through that and this person reminds you of that. So rather than being a fucking adult and just sitting down and opening the fucking booklet, you start yelling at the thing like it's a person. This is really just sort of therapy. I tried to set up apple TV the other day and uh, you know, I just, I know how I am now. I just told my wife to do it. She's like, I have to do it. I said, yeah, you have to do it right. She goes, why I go, cause you, you are, you're wired. No Pun intended, better than I am for these types of situations. Right? So she fucking, uh, I'll, I'll break down right here.

Speaker 1:          00:10:12       The difference between me and my wife, right? She fucking got in there. So I'm sitting out in the backyard, right? Drinking a Miller and she's in there and I'm just listening to her, sort of talking out loud, figuring it out. And then she got to one point and it fucked up. And then she, she laughed and went, oh no, oh. Or something like that. And I said, I would never ever emotionally be there. I would, that right there is where I'd be like, Oh, what the fuck? Fuck this. Fuck. You know, I would flip out, she just left. Okay, now here's the difference between us. So the last night I'm at a buddy's my house house, right? It was like eight of us and we'll fucking smoking a cigar and a, or cigars. I say we're not passing around like a joint, which is why I never got into smoking weed.

Speaker 1:          00:10:58       It's like I, it was the most disgusting thing is I think gets passed around and Shit, you know, I was always sitting there like, is, can I have my own, no offense fellas, you know, I really like you guys, but could I have my own that they'll only my mouth touches? Um, it's fucking dirty. Hippy, fucking Putz. Smoking sons a BS. Um, so we're over there and we're fucking smoking and somebody just points, he's got this big window and his house. And His light is on and somebody points to the window and he's like, dude, what the fuck? And we look and this is mouse like climbing up the fucking window. And ironically enough we were just talking about working with monkeys, you know, in movies and shit and like in a wild animals and stuff and I was talking about I would never fight. That's a deal breaker. I don't give a fuck how much money, there's no fucking way I'm working with the monkey because those things routinely fucking just stay snap. You know what I mean? Everybody looks at, Oh look, he's got a little hat on and a vest somehow it's not a chimpanzee anymore. That is the ability to rip my foot off my body. Fuck that thing. Fuck that thing. All right, I'm not working with it. I just got done saying that and then when we saw the mouse it all went out the fucking window.

Speaker 4:          00:12:20       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:21       You saying, you know we're trying to corner this thing, right? This is when you really realize what people are like when you get into like a crisis like this. So I got this Tupperware thing. I don't know why I didn't grab like a mock panel or something, but I'm in shorts and shit. And all I'm thinking is that this fucking thing bites me. Do I got to get those 70 rabies shots to the stomach?

Speaker 4:          00:12:40       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:12:41       And I'm sitting there, right? The fucking liberal trying to capture this thing and shoot out the window. And then my buddy, that conservative is fucking goes. He literally, the things went up to, uh, the curtain and was way up on the car. And this guy's got this fucking, it was like 12 foot fucking ceilings, this old house, you know? And uh, it's all the way up there on the curtain and the conservative dude goes, get some wd 40 in a match. It's like any serious, it's like, dude, you want to burn these? Do you want to hear the sound of a mouse burning alive? You want that on your fucking hard drive. Not to mention it's on curtains. You know, W I don't know what sort of sniper you think I am with this fucking shit. I'm not doing that. So anyways, so the thing fucking like lightning quit, like I threw the Tupperware, added it to get it to crawl back down the car.

Speaker 1:          00:13:32       And we're like, where is it? Where is it dude in like fucking Barry Sanders, Zig zags between all of us takes off down the hall and goes through the only open door into the bathroom. So they're my buddies in there. He's got it, he's got like the fucking Tupperware thing and I'm going and I'm going to close the door, close the door. But it's, he doesn't want to be, I don't close the door and be in there with the fucking vows cause it's still creepy. So I'm going shut the fucking door, shut the fucking door and

Speaker 1:          00:13:59       he won't shut the door and all of a sudden the thing starts running out and I gave it the old fucking right pad. Save, kicked it back into the room, right. It was like kicking a soc two you could bucket, barely feel it. I'm sure it felt different to the mouse and it was hilarious and fucking fucking head. My buddy right in his knee and he was wearing fucking shorts. And he fucking dad jumps up in the air and then the fucking thing ran out again. Got down on the stairs and I'm fucking good. Like what? This Tupperware thing going, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, trying to get the fucking thing. And then finally like, and where it ran, like there wasn't a good amount of light and I fucking had it. I heard it's squealed and they turned the light on and I got the thing down and the things on its back looking up on me, it's whole body is in the top where, and I'm right down on its neck and it's just looking up at me and I gotta tell something right now. The thing was fucking adorable. Fucking adorable. So I was able to, you know, quickly get his fucking head in there and then the things in there like making this squealing noise

Speaker 1:          00:15:04       and I'm like, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:15:07       I'm, I'm sorry buddy. Sorry Buddy. We're almost there. And I just slid it across the floor. It was freaking out. So I get it all the way to the door. And then there's, you know, that that piece of wood there between the door and outside. Now I've got a fucking lifted up. I start to lift it up immediately. It's fucking gross tail was sticking out and I'm like, fuck, if this thing runs back in the house, then we got to do this shit all over again. Oh, now what if I get bit? So I just held it down, uh, the Tupperware thing down and I sort of stood up with my hand still on it, brought my foot back, close the door as much as I could and I just fucking booted the thing and it just took off like a maniac down the driveway and the mouse lived, lived to tell another fucking tail. And um, that's what I'm good at. You get a fucking mouse in the house. I'll fucking, I'll get out some top of where and I'll fucking get rid of it. All right. But if you want me to set up apple TV, like,

Speaker 2:          00:16:05       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:16:05       I actually enjoyed catching the mouse. I was never like, even when I was running around, I wasn't frustrated. I never felt that he anger when I saw the mouse there, I didn't have any urge to kill it. I thought it was fucking adorable. And then I just let it go. And the mindset I was in that entire time during that dead, you know, moderately challenging point in my life. If I could just be in that mindset when, you know, I'm trying to fucking download something or anything like that, I, I feel like, I feel like my wife would have like 70% less shit to complain about when it comes to me. You know what I mean? That could just somehow getting that mindset was fun. Run around you get the blood going.

Speaker 1:          00:16:48       Like when we all went back, we all went back to smoking cigars were all laughing our balls off, you know, afterwards guys going are you fucking did this, uh, you were scared and blah, blah, blah. And then we were like, what the fuck said, get wd 40 and a match. And we all just started laughing. We're like, dude, you're definitely vote for Trump. Get his coat, get his coat, take his coat. Right. Um, so anyways, so I've been beginning to like delegate now, Shit like that. I'll just like it because my wife, you know your wife. Okay. And you know, women in general, women in general are just inherently fucking lazy. They don't want to do shit. It's like they're lazy. They're just too fucking smart to have to do most of the shit. And if they have a guy in their life, he's dumb enough to fucking do it. So all they gotta do is a couple little pouty face fucking things and they get to sit on the couch. Right. And that's why they're always saying, oh, it's easier for you to lose weight. It's like, no, cause, cause every time there's a fucking country job, yeah, I got to go do it. Can you take the recycling out? That's cardio, sweetie.

Speaker 1:          00:17:51       Why am I always on the fucking elliptical anyways? Um, that was not, none of this was what the fuck I wanted to talk about. What I wanted to talk to you about is if you are near a fucking TV on Thursday, all right. And you already sort of have any sort of a God damn American you put on what? Bup. Bup, Bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup,

Speaker 5:          00:18:19       banner.

Speaker 1:          00:18:20       Bam. You put on a dog, just started wagging its tail like what I was doing somehow had something to do with her. Um, do you watch Thursday night football and what you saw, what you saw, what Patriot fans saw? What Cold Fan saw? What Jim? The fucking biggest baby in NFL history. Jimmer say. Saw where's the solidification? If that's even a word of a man. Big like undeniably he became that night. The greatest coach of all time. Okay. That's it. It's not even debatable. You know how it's not debatable. Even people who hate the Patriots

Speaker 1:          00:19:05       can't criticize bill Belicheck anymore. All they say is like, oh, that guy could win with, don't. You could be out there and he could win with you. So they have to sort of shit on Tom Brady. That's the closest you'll get a patriot hater to say that bill Belicheck is the greatest coach of all time. He has to stay up to somehow take away Tom Brady who fucking drove his team to the go ahead score in all six Superbowls that he was in with under two minutes left two times. No disrespect to Eli. His defense failed them. I can have a takeaway from me like Eli beat us, right? Well the front fort beat the first time, but you don't what I'm saying. But when Tom had the fucking ball, he didn't, he didn't kneel O'Donnell. It, he, Joe Montana does to six fucking times six for fucking six. I don't give a fuck how great a coach you are. You can't teach a guy to fucking do that. And all these fucking dopes out there who are acting like, cause we beat the Texans in week three.

Speaker 2:          00:20:03       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20:03       That's the same fucking thing is uh, you know, doing it the first week in fucking February. Um, but anyways,

Speaker 2:          00:20:13       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:20:14       What you're really seeing an in new England is, is the greatest coach of all time to devastation. Devastating combination of the greatest fucking coach of all time.

Speaker 2:          00:20:22       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20:22       To arguably top three, four quarterback of all time.

Speaker 2:          00:20:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20:27       All right. Cause I'm open, Johnny Unitas, Joe Montana, Joe Montana, need four temps to win four Superbowls, not six, you know, so I give him the edge there and there's always some other fucking guy and need somebody that somebody can give me a good argument for. And I say, all right, the fucking thrown this at times. Like what a four or 500 fuck you want to say yes. Even if you put them at five, that's still, you know, ridiculous. All right. And then our owner I think is on his way to be in top three owner of all time. And if you want to fucking argue with me, here's his three coaching hires since he's been there. Bill Parcells. Oh Pistol Pete Carroll. Before anybody knew pistol Pete was a fucking great coach. He hired him and bill Bellacheck. Okay. Bill Parcells, Pete Carroll, Bill Belichick, and fucking 26 years old and team, 24 fucking years old team. That's who the fuck he's had his quarterbacks drew Bledsoe and fucking Tom Brady.

Speaker 1:          00:21:27       All right. So, so all you people that will try to make it seem like it's just one person like you need, you need all three components. You got to have to have the ownership, you've got to have the coaches, and you got to have the fucking players. All right? However, of the three headed monster there, one of them is without a doubt, the greatest of all time. And that is bill Bellacheck. And that's why I actually tweeted that Patriot fans are actually enjoying the suspension more than Jim or say, and it's fucking true because all it, if we fucking somehow beat the bills next week, all right, now the pacet is fucking fucked up his thumb. And we're going to have to Edelman at quarterback. And if you looked at the highlights of Edelman playing quarterback at Kent State, you understand why he was not drafted as an NFL quarterback?

Speaker 1:          00:22:10       Because there's no fucking way he would've survived. Half of the highlights are him running all over the God damn field. Um, and then the other half is him on his fucking tippy toes, throwing the God to both trying to see over the fucking Leiman or whatever. Like I like, I know what a quarter of professional quarterback it looks like. I'm just saying the second I see a guy running around all over the field, it's like, yeah, you're not going to do that long in the NFL. Um, cause you, they may, they may get, I'll get you the first week. They might not get you the second, they might not get you for a couple of years, but one of those days they're going to get you, oh, they're going to get you and they're going to fuck you up when they do. And all it takes is that one fucking hit and all of a sudden you lose half a step and then you fucked. Okay. Because all that time, you know, I feel like that all that time you've been fucking running around just felt like that guide reservoir dogs, you know, so you like to tell jokes giggling like a bunch of school goes, well I got a joke for you. 12 guys sitting around and Wolpert and wonder why the fuck they got there.

Speaker 1:          00:23:12       What did we do? What should we have done? All of a sudden they realize, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:23:17       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:23:18       all the time we joke around with, she'd been planning this Cape Off. Well then fuck it goes. So anyways, the guy who loses a half fucking steps, same thing, he starts taking your oil. At time I was wanting to rob, I should have been learning the fucking position. And now you don't have to think like you don't, you don't, I don't, you know, I fucking sit, stand up, stand tall at pocket. Your first instinct is to front for your fucking life. You've lost half a step and then boom, you take the next fucking hit and now you fucked. Now you're fucked. And that's the end of your career. And hopefully you got three years in. So you got the pension, which is something we learned last night, three years. He could play three seasons and then you get the NFL pension, you know, which starts at 55 for bastards.

Speaker 1:          00:23:57       And it's right around the time when you fucking concussion system. I don't have to pay. Do you really know that for back? No, I don't. Just shut the fuck up though. So anyways, the Patriots at 3.0 and uh, how about those bills yesterday, how they Keyala came to life. All those people in Buffalo who were ready to say to the big flounder there, whatever his fucking name is. I love that. I can't remember Rex Ryan because he's been so fucking quiet over the years. They were all ready to tell him they hit the fucking bricks. A rich, very rich. Why don't you and your fucking carnival ride looking brother, right? He looks like he runs like the tilt world. Why don't you guys go down to Duffy's, get yourself some wings, blood up, bring your bags, bring your bags. This is going to be a one way ticket.

Speaker 1:          00:24:43       Okay. Get on a fucking bus and go to Toronto and take over the fucking argonauts cake you're in when you're coaching the buffalo bills. If you fucking lose that job, if you get fired from that fucking job, the next stop. It's not even college football. You're, you're in the CFL. And um, I usually say no disrespect, but I mean, that is disrespectful as possible towards the CFL. Okay. And here's the deal. Nobody in Canada gives a fuck. Okay. They're all about the hockey. You know, something. Speaking of that, I missed all the world championship hockey, like a fucking asshole.

Speaker 2:          00:25:19       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:25:19       I heard it was amazing.

Speaker 2:          00:25:22       All right.

Speaker 1:          00:25:24       Sorry man, I can't do my podcast. I don't have to type in the fucking password at the same time. What was I talking about? So about rex, right, and fucking World World Cup hockey, whatever the fuck that is. I was making fun of the CFL. Hey Bill, we all know what you were doing. You're the one who lost his fucking place. I right. Relax. Still reason to get hostile. So I think, um, I dunno with Edelman at quarterback, which is what it's looking like. It is a home game. I say this is my prediction, knowing nothing about football on any professional level, I say if, if Jimmy Garappolo his back, uh, we win that game. I think if I don't know anybody else's playing, I don't know, but said, I don't know if he can play.

Speaker 2:          00:26:13       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:26:16       I just think, I just think it's, it's, that's going to be a really tough one because what's his face? Rex Ryan has a fucking hard on forest and he's got a great defense and uh, it looks like they, you know, I don't really know this, this year has been really fucking weird. Like you'd see like, like Arizona cardinals beat the fuck out of the Seahawks, right?

Speaker 2:          00:26:36       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:26:37       And then you think, I'm like, wow, they beat the Seahawks. I know that they don't have Marshawn lynch and all these guys are kind of a different area then one of those weird years and I'm not great, not fucking bad, but they got Pete Carroll, but they beat the fuck out of them and then they go to buffalo there hasn't won a game and then they get the shit kicked out of them by the bill. So I, I, this is too early in the season. I don't know who's who. I don't know what's what I dunno shot. I don't know who's not, but I think it's going to be a really tough game. Um, and I really hope that we win because, uh, if we lose, I know that Rex Ryan is going to do some classless fucking, uh, you know, one of his corny as John Wayne fucking lies. Nothing worse than a fat guy was swagger. Um, it's, I'm such a Dick Sometimes. Oh my God. Bless him. Alright, here we go. Let's do some advertising. Lost another one. Everybody. I lost another advertiser. You know what I mean? Date is don't fucking let those fucking kids who were sitting there trying to go, hey, did you know that 60% of live event tickets go on sold?

Speaker 1:          00:27:41       I mean Jesus fucking Christ. It's one of the dumbest things I've ever heard.

Speaker 2:          00:27:46       Yep.

Speaker 1:          00:27:46       What about, Hey, do you know that 60% of tickets are held back and sold to fucking people like you by the promoters that then get a cut to the scalp and tickets on their own fucking shows? I would believe that because I don't understand how these kind of, these people end up with all the God damn tickets.

Speaker 2:          00:28:04       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:28:04       Does that make any sense? Is that you with your tail or is there something knocking on the door to Cleo?

Thank Christ. All right, it's over. Okay. So last week I teased you guys and I mentioned something about great white sharks. I was supposed to go on this fucking trip, um, with a good buddy of mine, Dean del Rey. I paid for the whole fucking trip. Um, well my, my part of the trip I should say, and it was, I was going to go on a shark cage and while they chummed the fucking water and I was going to what great white sharks swimming by me, I was all set to go. Everything was a go in all of this shit. And then this fucking business, um, you know, there was this edit in this fucking, I just couldn't get out of it.

Speaker 1:          00:37:11       And I had, I couldn't fucking go and I was devastated, but I'm happy that I got done what needed to get done. And if you guys want to see what I missed out on, go to Dean del Rey's. I'm sure he's already uploading pictures. He's getting back now. And um, he actually, he's the reason why I went, cause he went years ago and do like the pictures look like discovery channel Shit. And I'm terrified to fucking sharks. But I also, I want to see a great white shark at some point in my life and to the universe and a safe fucking way. I don't know, being on a sinking ship and be like, oh, I finally got to say, right.

Speaker 1:          00:37:50       So I wasn't able to do it. Uh, but I, so not only do I not get to do this, okay. And I ended up having to edit all these fucking episodes and shit because even though the show isn't coming out until the spring of next year, we're still in crunch time because that's how doing a show works. There's never enough time. There's never enough money. They can't fucking, it's just, it's just in, you're always behind. Some we, we just have to fucking get this done now or we're going to be fucked. We're going to be fucked. It's just, it's just that 24, seven. Right? So I'm glad that I did that, but, uh, uh, fucking blows. So anyway, so I'm back here. All right. I'm driving around Los Angeles and at rush hour, um, I pull up to this fucking stoplight and it's like, there's two lanes of cars. All right?

Speaker 1:          00:38:43       There's like two people in front of me. I stop and next to me, you know, there's three people and that's as far, you know, I don't even look in the rear view mirror and I'm just sitting there. One, 1000, two, 1000, three, 1000, four, 1000. And then I hear what sounds like a fucking explosion. Just boom. And I went, whoa. And then I get, I don't even remember it, somebody hit my car, right? I don't even remember feeling that. All I know is I just saw this fucking Prius just driving right down the fucking middle of all of this stop cars. Just, just went right by me. Sorry about years right there just right and just side view fucking mirrors. Just flying off every car right down the side of my car and, and he just comes to our, he or she comes to a stop. All the airbags deployed in this person's car on the side. I couldn't even see who was in it.

Speaker 2:          00:39:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:39:40       So all I'm thinking is like, oh my God, fucking obviously classic example of texting while driving is mother fucker was looking down and at the last second was like fuck and just tried to shoot through the middle. So I, you know, I hate when people get into a little fender benders like that and then they just get out of their car and they leave the car where it's at. It's like, well you just drive the fucking thing over, get it out of the fucking way so people behind you can get out of there. So what I did was I pulled, I, you know, there was like a street, you know, a couple of feet up and I just pulled into that street and pulled over and the person still hasn't gotten out of the car. Everybody else that this person hit is out of their cars now. And we're waiting for this person to get out.

Speaker 1:          00:40:24       And I'm thinking like, oh my God, like are they unconscious? Did they hit their fucking head? I mean that really soundly impact was unbelievable. Right? I get out of my car and all I have is this on the side of my car. All he did, the person God was the side view mirror, but it's bent all the way the fuck back. So like basically you could pull up next to me and you could like brush your teeth in the mirror because it's, it's pointed right at right at you. A few parallel to me. So finally the fucking car door opens and I, and I actually felt bad for the person. I was like, oh my God, they're going to be so embarrassed. They're going to be fucking mortified or whatever. And it was the exact opposite. This dude gets out and he just starts cursing everybody out.

Speaker 1:          00:41:03       He got out of the car yelling at us. It's fucking guy just hit five people. He's like, your mother fucking fucking, he's going fuck you. You fucking bitch. You people. Now of course people are videoing videoing this person. All right? And he starts, you fucking bitch. You fucking, this is the person you should be good video of her. You fucking fuck all you guys. And while I'm like, this guy was like, he was so fucking committed to yelling at us for half a second. I started thinking like, yeah, what, what did I do wrong when I was sitting there at the time traffic, like not hitting any but so the funniest thing ever, right? These people start to engage this person and the argument, it's like, why would you waste your time arguing? This guy just hit five people with the car and he's yelling at us. He's literally knee deep inside view fucking mirrors. Like you really think that you're gonna, you're going to say anything to this guy and he's going to stop mid screaming and be like, ah, yeah, okay, fair enough. That's a good point. Then look at it that way. Um, so I just start laughing.

Speaker 1:          00:42:11       I mean it was, it was just, it was fucking Alinsky. I just hit five fucking people and now he's yelling at us. It was, it was fucking hilarious. Right? So he gets into his car and he grabs like three backpacks and he puts them on himself and he goes, get used to it. This is what this is what La is going to be like. And everybody's like, Whoa, hey, hey, post nine 11 what the fuck does that mean? He yells at the lady more calls her a bitch and other couple of times, and I don't know if they were both fucking jockeying for a position or he felt she cut him off, but I think this guy just went total fucking road rage. He just picked a spot and he's like, I'm fucking getting there before you and I don't give a shit. This guy just fucking snaps. So he grabs his fucking backpacks and then just walks away, walks down the street like fucking, I was joking. My buddies like Andy Griffith when he's taken opie to go fishing, he just fucking walked away and I was like, this guy's out of his fucking mind. He just

Speaker 1:          00:43:08       Egypt, he just fuck. He hit l he kept us, he's yelling at us and he walks away like I'm done with this shit. Like one of the greatest displays of entitlement I've ever seen in my fucking life. I mean, what if there was a pregnant lady hit? I mean this guy hit this fucking first person so hard. I looked down, I thought it was a hubcap. Who's this chunk of a rim? I said to the cop that goes, that plastic. He goes, no, that's metal. That's the rim. It's like Jesus Christ. So he, by the time the cops get there, that guy has just gone. He is gone. That ball is gone. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:43:48       so I call up a buddy of mine, cause now I'm like fucking piss going like Jesus. Fuck with the arrogance of this guy. And then I'm thinking all that shit. I just, what? What if it went up? And I just said, no buddy, you shut the fuck up. And then I knocked him out and then have, you know, you're going to see a hero fucking thing. Yeah. What if I did that? Oh wait that. Sorry. I'm a pussy. You know. Oh wait, I've have, uh, I don't like getting punched in the face. Oh, that's why I don't have even a white belt in any martial art. That vow. That's why, that's why I sat there and did nothing. Oh, I forgot. That's right. That's why I did nothing. Right. So I call up a buddy of mine who was a lawyer. I remember a long time ago, I got into it, this woman.

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:44:33       And, uh, we went up to the stoplight and she was like, you know, she beeped at me. So I beat back at her and she beat to me, I'd be back to her. And then she just fucking hammered the horn all the way up to the light, like 400 yards, bay stops and holds it down and staring at me in the rear view mirror. Wow. And the second it stopped, she held her horn down for 30 seconds and the second is stopped. I just went and me and the woman I was with fucking started dying laughing at her and then she all of a sudden put her car in reverse, backed into me really lightly, and then get out at, reached into our glove box. And I sat there like going, oh my God, is she getting a gun? What the fuck? And she wrote down my license plate number and then drove away. And I of course thought nothing of it. I was a young man.

Speaker 2:          00:45:29       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:45:30       And next thing you know, I'm on the road and I get this, I check in my bump, checking my voicemail. It's like the 90s. This is a long ago. This was, and it was just like, yeah. Uh, Mr. Bird, this is a officer so and so from the Elsa Gundo priest police department investigating a possible assault with a deadly weapon, uh, or whatever the fuck it is. Because basically your car is a deadly weapon. Not Is it a battery? If you actually hit somebody, I thought it was salt was either threatening somebody or making them feel like you're going to hit him or something like that. That salt in, in a battery assault and battery is actually doing it. So anyways, because of that fucking thing,

Speaker 2:          00:46:09       mmm,

Speaker 1:          00:46:11       I knew that, you know, watching this guy leave. I'm like, okay, that's five councilman is salt off of assault with a deadly weapon. We got video of you screaming and everybody see, can't say you were texting and listening to the radio. You've basically admitted that what you did, you kind of did on purpose. You, we have you on video, everyone knows what you look like and then you left the scene of the accident. So I call up a buddy of mine who was a lawyer and I just left a message. I just said, I just want to know what kind of jail time is this guy looking at? How long is he going to go to jail? My buddy calls me back and he just goes, I go, yeah, I got to him fucking bleeding. He goes, yeah man, it's crazy. And I go, how long is this guy going to go to jail for? Was that like three years? And he goes, ah, you know, he's a first offender. I mean, the jails are crowded, you know, he doesn't have any other priors or anything like that. He just has like a rage issue. They probably just suspend his license and definitely they send him some anger management things in. And I was just like, no jail time.

Speaker 1:          00:47:15       And he was like, when he got out of the car, like what was he saying? And maybe this, I couldn't wait. I was like, you can, you can fucking hit people. Five people, five different people in a car, no concern for that. Their wellbeing whatsoever. Get out, curse everybody out. Leave and not fucking go to jail. It's unbelief. What the fuck do you have to do to go to jail? And he was just like, well, you're going to put him in jail and nobody becomes a better person when they go to jail. He's going to be in there with a bunch of fucking maniac. So I actually feel irresponsible to let people know out there that you can basically do what this guy just did. And you're not going to go to jail. I'm, I mean, I'm sure he's going to get arrested when they find them. I Dunno. I was, I was pretty blown away by that. So there you go. Instead of looking at sharks, I got rear ended by this guy. But uh, I to admit, every time I think about that guy yelling, it was fucking hilarious. And I start thinking like, was that just like a strategy for him to get the fuck out of there? And everybody goes like he boobs a probably a stolen car. It's like, who the fuck steals a Prius? How do you start a Prius? How do you steal what you can you hot wire the fucking thing.

Speaker 1:          00:48:30       I, I dunno. I have no idea. So I love it becomes like a fucking sleuth, you know? Well, we have probably what you, what was, what was the circumstances? Oh, okay. Let me listen to you with your complete lack of fucking,

Speaker 1:          00:48:46       that's why I called the lawyer was like, I don't want to talk to other people's every, you'd probably get like shoving years, you know, I never even took a a lawyer class. Lower class. I never went to law school. I'm a moron. All right. I'm also trying to type in my password so I immediately become extra fucking stupid. Did I type it in right? Did I type it in right? Yes. Okay. Let's do some questions here for the week, or by the way, congratulations to the Tennessee volunteers, man. Jesus Christ. What a fucking game versus Florida SCC football ad. It's fucking best. They hadn't beat Florida in 11 years. They can't close a couple of times only to come up short, right? So Tennessee got their asses, what? In the first fucking half, they get booed off the field by their own fan base, right? They come out, they make their halftime adjustments and all of a sudden the scoring in the game stops.

Speaker 1:          00:49:39       It's like 21 to three Tennessee couldn't do a fucking thing with the ball. But now all of a sudden Florida can't, you know, they're still up 21 three but then at scorn anymore and they're getting stops and all of a sudden Tennessee starts moving the fucking bomb. They score 2110 the crowd starts coming to life. All right? They get another stop. Florida's defense goes back out in the field. They're getting tired, right? The next thing you know, fucking Bam, Bam, Bam, like Mister Blonde, a lot of reservoir dogs references this week fucking, they just went on this fucking run and they like 506 drives still last drives, they scored touchdowns and next thing you know it's fucking like 38 to 21 or something like that. And there's like a minute and a half left and one of the coolest, I said they went up into Tennessee's like the coach's box when they're up there, you know the guys down there, the fucking the generals up there, right.

Speaker 1:          00:50:36       And um, they, they circled this one guy, Gary Danielson circles. This one guy goes, you see this guy right here? And they had this total intense look on his face. He goes, that guy was brought to Tennessee for one reason to beat Florida. And it's just like, that's the fucking shit. That's like one of the bad aesthetic. Like what are you doing here? What are you doing here in Knoxville? And you can, you can actually legitimately sit at a bar and be like, I came to Knoxville for one reason and that's to be Florida. Um, and not be totally, it wouldn't be, it wouldn't be as cheesy said, you could actually fucking be telling the truth so that you guys, we brought in for one reason and that was to beat Florida. And the fucking guy did it and he showed no emotion until three, two, one and then resolve.

Speaker 1:          00:51:21       He jumped up and hugged the guy next to him. That's just, you know, I can't imagine how much money is getting stuffed in the front pocket of his fucking button down by all, by all those boosters. The poster span, um, bought a fucking game. People were going fucking crazy. It was just a, it was just one of the, Joe was every Verne Lundquist said, he said, if, you know, if you, if you don't lock that you don't like college football. He didn't have a southern accent, but I just, I dunno, it was Tennessee man. Um, and once again, bucket list, you know, I want to go to a Florida gator home game, which I'm fucking going to in a couple of weeks against Lsu, I'm speaking of which, uh, happy trails as they say on a PTI to a less Myers, had a great fucking run there. I mean, that's how it always ends.

Speaker 1:          00:52:13       It always ends with you getting fired. So, uh, as much as people bitch Moan and complain about the guy, he did win a championship and l people who there was Nick Saban's team, oh, go fuck yourself. You know? Okay. So it was Nick Saban's team and you know what? He didn't drive it into a fucking tree and they missed the playoffs. You know, like a certain guy who went 11 and five with the Patriots the year after the fucking super bowl. Um, the Matt Cassel debate, holy fucking shit. That, that will never end. Dude met castle or what about when he went to Kansas City and they, he was so bad that they cheered when he fucking got hurt. Well, that was because that was Kansas City. Well, Joe Montana went to Kansas City and all of a sudden, Kansas City, he went to the playoffs. Playoffs. All right.

Speaker 1:          00:52:59       I just don't know how fucking more basic it could be, but now you're right, Matt Cassel, Tom Brady, Qantas. There's no difference. Oh, Jesus. Alright. Hypodermics hydro phonics. Um, dear Billy Baldo, the bollock brain bullet, brain bolt pro football wall. Uh, I'm having a real problem in a startup I'm launching. I'm pitching that about hydro phonics to people who have no idea about it. Is this like a commercial that's disguised as a fucking question? How can I make it relatable to the common man? It's the best way to grow plants using the leased land and water with much less chemicals. Oh Dude, you fucking with blue blood money here. If you better keep this under wraps do or you'll just let her know, commit suicide somehow. Conveniently I made an invention that's slashes the cost to less than half of the current system, but pitching it and getting people interested is a big challenge. Any advice? Um, yeah, I would do what the guide the Tesla guy did you just do it yourself because you like the best case scenario is if what you're doing is true is you'll pitch it to a corporation, they will buy it and they will never use it, but they will own it and then no one else can use it. Like that's what they would do. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:54:18       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:54:18       So anyways, he said, uh, a Duh.

Speaker 1:          00:54:23       Any advice the hydro phonics can really change the global farming for the better. Saw your show in Bristol with my team and really enjoyed it. Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. Um, yeah, I would try. You need to find for something like that, I would say that you need to find people that are, you need to find the rebels. All right? Those rare people who actually have money and um, aren't giving it to politicians, aren't best friends with all the fucking cops and just totally in the system. You got to find people outside of that who want to be like, yeah, this is bullshit. Uh, coming here with an idea and mind, let's try to fucking, but the book I'm gonna, you're probably gonna have to give up part ownership of it. Um, there's all of that, but uh, you know, if what you're saying is actually real and it does work, I would save and if you owned a piece of that, you're going to be fine financially. But, um, now how you find those types of people? I have no idea. But what I would try to do, I mean, can you literally Google the top 10 fucking people with money that you know, ah, Jesus Christ, this is all going off the rails. You know what I'm saying? I would not go the corporate route cause like I said there, you're either going to fucking, you know, they'll put something in your eggs and you'll have a fucking coronary, um, or, uh, they're just going to buy the idea and take it. So I, you need, you need to find some rebels, man.

Speaker 1:          00:55:49       People with some fucking balls. Eh, uh, then I would try to go directly to local farmers, show them how it works. Uh, you might have to give it away at first and then he, that guy will spread the word to other farmers and you know, this could be a way that they can compete, compete with big time farming.

Speaker 2:          00:56:09       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:56:09       You know, like, I would try to sell it that way. Uh, that's one of those things you gotta do it. Like, you know, like how the other rappers would make it back in the day, they'd make mix tapes and sell them out of the trunk of their car. Like you have to do it that way. This is a, this is going to the long road. You know what I mean? This is the comic who doesn't have a catch phrase, who doesn't wear the same silly fucking shirt every time. Who fucking isn't like, Oh, you know the Hague. I Dunno, it doesn't wrap their fucking act around a cause. Um, you just going to be, try to just be funny. You're going to have to take the long road with this, but um,

Speaker 2:          00:56:47       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:56:47       Yeah, I think in the, in there I want something somewhere. I gave you some good advice. Yeah. I would try to get to local farmers and have one of them use it and say how great it is and how much, how much money they saved. I would go that way. And then you get enough of those farmers doing that shit. Okay. Using your system and then you get them to, to show their results and what they were able to do and how much more money they made using less. And then Dan, you go to the guy,

Speaker 1:          00:57:15       then you start asking around, then you find the guy, then you get the money. Okay. Now you've got a little bit of momentum because you did some of the legwork. You can own more of it and then you can create that feel like, hey man, I got another guy coming down to check this out. You want to get business with me? What? Then you get a better percentage. I would go that route nine. You know, I basically, I just described like a Julia Roberts movie, but I think you could do it. All right. Anyways, good luck to you sir. I hope what you're saying is true and I hope you can make a difference because that would be tremendous. All right. Bay or cons. Hey, coppertop was wa wondering if you heard about these cons? Bear? Yeah, the aspirin. Oh yeah, I heard about this. These fuckers are buying, oh, Annie, Monsanto and changing their name to bear to avoid the negativity that comes with the Monsanto name, but not changing any of the fucked up practices like GMO seeds and hiding from the public how they are poisoning our food supply, et cetera.

Speaker 1:          00:58:13       Yeah. How come this never comes up in the political debates they'd have a talk about because these guys have so much they have, we will fucking murder you money if you talk to talk to us, talk about us. Um, as this, this wasn't bad enough. I read up on bear and come to find out a few years ago, these bastards supplied blood to hemophiliacs who needed blood transfusions and their products and had the aids virus ended and continue to sell it. After they knew about it, they even admitted to it. Come on. What did you read this? What? What in the fuck? How are these corporate fuckheads always allowed to get away with this unbelievable level of greed and solace in human behavior? These kids should be tried and executed. Here's the link in case you wanted to read up on this bare admits, it paid millions in HIV infected infection cases just, just not in English. Well, thanks for the last after reading shit like this, I can use a few. All right, I'll look that up. I hope that's a legitimate website and that's some fucking lunatic. But that just says that they admitted that they fucked up and paid out, but God knows that corporations, they, you know, they had those fucking police cruisers.

Speaker 1:          00:59:28       That way if you got rear ended, like there was a major problem with the gas tank igniting in these state troopers were fucking burning to death. And I heard they knew about that and they weighed the whole, well, the lawsuit, the class action suit versus changing the design and the class action suit would be less. So they chose that and they let these guys, these fucking cops burned to death. So it wouldn't surprise me. This is getting really dark people. All right.

Speaker 2:          00:59:53       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:59:54       Hillary health, dear Billy Bilderberg, um, I've always known you to be an o on openminded and unbiased. Really? Uh, I, that's not how I described myself and also an empathizer with conspiracy theories. Oh yeah, I'll fucking all this a toy, which is why I was somewhat upset about your unawareness last week when asked about Hillary's health unawareness. Is that a word? Uh, I'm not some guy. And, well it didn't get underlined in red. So obviously it's got to be a word, right? I'm not some guy in support of either campaign or party. Yes you are. We all are. But when I saw the shit I'm going to show you, I slowly became more unhinged. All I'm hoping for here is, uh, is to react to a few videos that have received as limited media attention as possible. And I'll just try to give quick on bias descriptions before each one. But I want, uh, you to give your honest opinion. I'm sure you might have the same first thought that I had after seeing these things, but eventually the only reaction is I had a, what the fuck is happening? Just put them in a URL. Click on him. All right.

Speaker 2:          01:01:07       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:01:08       Okay. And what he's describing all this stuff. All right. Seizure faces.

Speaker 2:          01:01:14       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:01:14       Phlegm faints in green screen. All right, so I watched these videos.

Speaker 2:          01:01:20       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:01:20       Let me see if I can find these things. These are all clips of Hillary Clinton allegedly, uh,

Speaker 2:          01:01:28       you know,

Speaker 1:          01:01:30       having major medical issues and, and nobody's talking about. All right. Did Hillary have a seizure?

Speaker 2:          01:01:35       All right. You guys have got a tribe and cold.

Speaker 1:          01:01:47       I don't, I don't think she had a seizure in this first one. I think she is that uncomfortable in her own fucking skin and that's her trying to act like she's fucking playful and this is what all politicians do and this is why Trump is killing it. Because Trump would have looked over and be like, where the fuck did you come from? She did not just have it. That's not a seizure.

Speaker 2:          01:02:06       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:02:07       that's not what a seizure looks like. You don't have a seizure like fucking,

Speaker 2:          01:02:16       yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:02:17       they will jump on anything. There's no fucking way like the media is going to cover up. She had a fucking seizure. Gimme a thug. How much they made out of her having pneumonia. That's not a seizure. That's just an incredibly uncomfortable person in their own fucking skin trying to act like they're playful. All right, this next one's my favorite one. Close up of Hillary's feet showing she was dragged into event. Now this one's completely eliminated because you never show me who's head belongs to those feet. It's somebody getting dragged, like I don't understand. Like I don't even see her get, I don't even see that person's for me. Look at this again. See the, she's, they're getting dragged here. Yeah. I don't see anything there. And I don't even know that that's Hillary. This is why you can't, we can't present this as fucking news. Um, then Hillary disappearing. This looks like a fifth grade Photoshop to me. Yeah. I don't know this, this is fucking hilarious. This looks like an Atari from, this is why this is not on national news, Dude. This shit is ridiculous. And then the last one is simply her with her weird eyes. Normally in slow motion

Speaker 1:          01:03:30       with some silly music underneath it.

Speaker 1:          01:03:39       Yeah. No, this is, you put anybody in slow motion. They're going to look demonic. This is why I haven't talked about it. Okay. Uh, yeah, she's on the campaign trail. She's worked herself to death and she got pneumonia. Like most people when they work themselves, that heart, you catch pneumonia. It's completely fucking normal. Do I agree with their politics? Do I like her? Am I going to vote for her now? Am I going to vote for Donald Trump? Now is the other person that I'm going to fucking vote for going to win now. All right. But I don't think that Hillary is like literally having seizures on TV and uh, people are just completely fucking ignoring it. All right? There's plenty of fucking dopes that they can put in office that will do exactly what they say that don't have seizures. So why would they have her?

Speaker 1:          01:04:20       Cause it's too late, man. That too far down the thing. Yeah. I don't buy it. I am all about the conspiracies. I'm all fuck him about them. I, you know, but I, I don't, I just don't buy into it. So what I think you have there, sir, is, um, basically, you know those shows where people find old shit in their house. Like this has been in our family for like five generations. I was wondering is it worth anything? And sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't. You're a, you're that person who came in with something that you thought it was real, but it's a fake and you thought it was worth thousands and thousands of dollars. But it's, sorry, it's only worth 15 bucks.

Speaker 2:          01:04:56       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:04:56       And then you just, and the awkward silence that follows you just slowly pack up your shit and then you leave. I'm sorry sir. I wanted to believe it's so bad I can't stand Hillary. I think she is one of the most dishonest people that has come along since her husband or the last Bush administration. Um, I hate the Clintons. I hate the bushes. I don't mind the George Bush senior. All right. George Bush senior was a fucking bad ass. Okay. I don't know what the fuck the Warren Commission and being part of the CIA, I don't know what the fuck he did there. All I knew is that guy at like 19 years old fucking bombed an island where he had this fucking fly in and what he was trying to take out was below the highest points. It was like he's flying into an old football stadium, shaped like a horse shoe.

Speaker 1:          01:05:43       And he flew in below the highest level of the mountains and the side of him. And there was people shooting at him down at his fucking plane. You got it. You got? What the fuck was the flags of our fathers? You gotta read that book now, that book I read. Um, anyways. All right, that is the podcast, ladies and gentlemen. Uh, thank you so much for listening and uh, that is all checkout Dean del Ray's pictures of the shark and counter that I missed, but next year I'm definitely fucking going. I delayed it for a year. Um, what happened? He can't fucking do everything, but uh, you know, I'm glad I was here and I got to edit the shows and to get rear ended by a psycho and watched the guy just walk away. Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boo. Right down the fucking streets. There you go, people.

Speaker 1:          01:06:32       She's now that you can do that. If you're having a bad day of a Deli, you can plow into five people, tell them to all go fuck themselves and you just walk away. But they will take your license forever. Possibly if they find you. I have no idea. All right. Go fuck yourselves and I'll check on, on Thursday. As always, if you want to donate to the podcast, the easiest way to do it as you go to the [inaudible] dot com you click on the podcast page and then you click on the Amazon blink, and if you go there and take an Amazon, if you buy something, no extra charge to you, they kicked me a little fucking dough for a driving traffic to their site. If you don't want to do it, I totally understand. All right, I'll see you Thursday.
