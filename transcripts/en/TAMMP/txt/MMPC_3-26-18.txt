Speaker 2:          00:00:17       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:00:17       Everything's gonna be fine. Okay. Shake it off. What'd you think? Bad stuff was only going to happen. Other people every once in a while comes to your neighborhood. Shake it off. Put a smile on your mother fucker. Um, anyways, uh oh. Did I wake up mad this morning? What a surprise. What are unique emotion from the freckled country you've come to know and love?

Speaker 2:          00:00:48       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:00:48       Um, by the way, you know, and now that I went through all of that bullshit to get on fucking Instagram, the fact that you have to follow 9,000 fucking people or you, you get to say you're just staring at the same photo every fucking day. And it's just really like a, it's like a maze.

Speaker 2:          00:01:05       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:01:06       You know, you're on Twitter, you just fucking on Twitter now. You still have to follow people, I guess. Now I got to fucking go on. I got to fucking follow all these fucking gay, get on the edge of my wife's telling me, get on here. We just follow all your friends and some speaking things. You're interested so I can just be another mouth breathing dope. Staring at my fucking phone. I already, I already stare at it too much. Um, you know, I thought I was going to get on Instagram and all it's going to see his ass and titties and I just not seeing it. Right. It's probably cause I only follow Dean del Ray and Joe Rogan. So what I see is, uh, what did I see? I saw Joe Rogan walking around holding a chicken with another 40 chickens following him. All right? All these years I've known Joe Rogan. I had no idea that he owned chickens.

Speaker 2:          00:01:58       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:01:58       You know, this is causing me to reevaluate our entire friendship. I mean, I don't know why he would keep that from me. Does he? Does he think he can't trust me with that information? That these are the kinds of things I'm going to ask him the next time. I think I've had them on here.

Speaker 2:          00:02:15       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:02:15       I don't fucking know. Anyways. And, and, and Dean del Ray's in New York, that's what I know.

Speaker 1:          00:02:22       That's all I know. No horse, no inspirational workout videos. You know, where some guys trying to inspire you to work out, but he's really just wanting to take his shirt off. You know what's funny about those fucking Instagram people is beyond the fact that they're doing that show, the inspirational celebrity would, they're just every day, you know, acting like they have life all figured out and now they're going to patch these gems on to you. Hey, next time you're thinking outward, look inward to find the real so your truth can be even fucking sent to the stratosphere and shut the fuck up. Yeah. And the other one I love, I love the celebrity fucking standing outside his private jet with this serious look on his face. How about a smile? You fucking cunt standing there, yo. This is how we do.

Speaker 2:          00:03:27       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:03:27       This is my Louis Vuitton luggage. What a fucking moron. Gotta asshole buys $5,000 fucking pieces of luggage so some asshole can throw it in the bottom of a fucking United flight. You know? I don't know. You'd have to fly private for the rest of your life and watch your luggage just go easy, easy, or you could just get a fucking bag that's designed to get the shit kicked out of it. You can keep all your fucking jewels inside of it.

Speaker 2:          00:03:58       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:58       Oh my God. If I see one more, can't do the photo shoot with all their cars and then there's the fucking private jet in the background. What? What does, what is that? You know? Just to fuck fucking just put it under. I'm rubbing it in your face that I have more money than you. Don't fucking do that thing where I'm trying to inspire you to get to my level.

Speaker 2:          00:04:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:23       Do you realize everything that has to be involved? They're like, you have to fucking call up the fucking airport. Some poor bastard has to do that. You have your cars. It's not enough that you have your cars. It's not enough that you're flying private. It's not enough that your luggage costs more than what a lot of people make to fucking teach kids in public schools. You have to have all of that. I mean, how many fucking drivers do you need to get all your fucking cars out there? Did you got to figure out what fucking outfit you're gonna wear? I don't know. Anyways, plowing ahead, but that is the kind of shit that I want to see are actually kind of have this thing going on with, with friends of mine. Well we just send each other all of those like photos.

Speaker 2:          00:05:09       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:05:09       You know that poor kid who died there, the, the humble Brag Guy, he would've had a fucking field day on Instagram. Okay. Jesus Christ. I mean, that's why I kind of went on there. I just didn't realize it was going to be that much work to try and find all of those fucking photos because people would just send me them all the time and I was like, Jesus Christ, I really missing out not being on Instagram. And then you get on there. And I, I've followed Dean del Ray and Joe Rogan and my beautiful wife, and that's it. And Rogan and deed, Delray, or normal grounded human being. So it's just tell me who to follow.

Speaker 1:          00:05:49       Okay. I do enough fucking promotional as other ones. I just want to see, I want to see that. That's the Shit I want to see. I want to see people that are pretending to inspire me, but they're really just fucking, you know, they want to show me how much money they have or how great is shaped they're in. Um, I mean, why can't everybody be down to Earth like me? I'm sorry, I'm just a self involved. I'm just not as motivated in the gym. Plus you, it's fun. Even if I got shredded, I mean, if I took my shirt off, all people would say is like, dude, fucking white. You are. Oh my God. I'd be, what about my boulevard, my Apac, abs?

Speaker 1:          00:06:29       Nobody cares. Um, all right, so let's get to my week here. I went and I saw ministry live for the first time. I saw them, uh, down at the, uh, the fuck is it going at the house of Blues in Anaheim. And I was meeting some friends down there and they're like, oh, we're at the fuck and we're at the Ramada and my guy, so I fuck, we're at the bar. So I walk into the Ramada, go to the fucking bar there. They, uh, there's nobody there. It turns out I'm at the Ron Romano who knew there was more than one role model, whatever the fuck it was, wherever the hell that was gone. So anyways, we ended up going over to the, uh, to the show. It was just, it was awesome. Live music was and always will be the shit. And I got to see them, uh, basically played the entire album. There are new album America can't KKK aunt, um, an Al Jourgensen as always, just fucking crushing it. Fucking crushing it, man. You know, there's front men and then there's front men still has the passion.

Speaker 2:          00:07:34       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:35       Silky. You know, got the fucking crowd going. You're looking around, you know, a lot of people like my age by that, like the fucking fourth song, there was a mosh pit. I stayed clear of it. I definitely stay clear of it, but they got a bunch of, uh, I think they're on like a 25 city tour right now. And they write, they did a Anaheim and then Oxnard, I don't know where they're off to now. When you promote a couple of their dates here, considering such a fucking awesome show. Here we go. Am I man, this story toward dates? He at that data that, that, come on, man. Why is my Internet so fucking slow?

Speaker 2:          00:08:19       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:08:20       It'd be funny if they actually had it run at the same speed as your intellect.

Speaker 2:          00:08:26       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:27       And you couldn't get mad anymore. It's like, well, it's because I'm a fucking asshole. I'm dumb. All right. They're going to be in Sacramento at the ace of spades. Portland, the Roseland theater. Oh, that's a beauty. That's on Wednesday. Thursday they're gonna be in Vancouver at the vogue theater. Saturday. They're going to be an Edmonton. All right. And then when they go into end to April, they get a B in uh, Montana, Nebraska, Chicago, Illinois. A couple of nights there. Cincinnati, grand rapids, Michigan, Indianapolis, Toronto, Moria when they're playing great places. BOSTON, April 17th, um, couple of nights there. Portland, Maine, Jesus, they'd go on everywhere. He got to catch him and the dude runs through the fuck is it runs through the end of April as far as what they have here. Um, all right, back to the podcast here. So old freckles forgot that it was formula one season and unfortunately somebody on Twitter said, hey, are you excited for this weekend?

Speaker 1:          00:09:36       I was like, Oh shit. That's right. And because it's now not on NBC sports, the ESPN cons took it over and God knows they'll fuck it up somehow. That's what I thought they were going to do. I've got to admit, I watched what I got out of the race. I thought they did a good job, although I don't understand why we'll Buxton isn't there now they have like this comedy team or some shit. They got two people down there who then throw it over to another guy. You think ESPN would try to save money and not fucking hire three people for the job. That one guy was doing outstandingly since I've been watching, but a, I don't run the shit. So anyways, I fucking go on in my, my cable box and I go to record the race and I don't know what happened. All I recorded was the pregame, which ended up getting me like the first 10 laps of the race.

Speaker 1:          00:10:26       So I missed the fucking race. Uh, but then I went on and I read all about it. First thing that I noticed was the new, the uh, Jesus Christ. I'm stuttering here, the new design of the uh, the cop pain. I'm like, what the fuck is that thing that's like in the driver's line of sight. And they got this new halo thing that they got going on. Um, I guess for a years since like 2010 or 11, they've been trying to figure out, you know, cause it's the open cockpit, people smashing into walls, tires and bolts go fly in. These guys are driving, you know, upwards of 100 fucking 80 miles an hour. If you get hit with a screw, you know, could go right through your helmet, India fucking head. I don't know. They've been trying to figure out how to protect them, you know, and then all everybody in the crowd's like, well, hey man, don't put in like make it look like a fighter jet man.

Speaker 1:          00:11:14       We were like, it's just always been open cockpit. So everybody in the crowd, you know, they want to see, it's like, listen, if we're going to sit here along this fucking fence and at any point a washer can come flying off the car, go through my eye socket and into the back of my brain. I mean, at least you could do is with your fucking Alamut drive around in an open cockpit. So they decided to come up with this new design. Uh, the halo cockpit picked design, which is supposed to, uh, it looks like a giant piece of plastic to me. It's probably made out of carbon fiber. Um, but evidently that will stop a tire for smashing you in the fucking head. And killing you. Nobody wants that, right? I don't think so. So anyways, I saw at the beginning of the race and as always, Lewis Hamilton got the pole position, it help and uh, the race starts and he gets to the first corner first. So obviously he's going to win the fucking race. That's how it works. And even one of the announcers stupidly said, well, you know, it history has shown that whoever wins the first race of the year usually goes on to win the championship. That, I don't know if that was a comment on how much lack of fucking passing there is or the fact that basically Mercedes and Ferrari have such superior engines that you don't, nobody else can compete with them.

Speaker 1:          00:12:44       You know? I mean, I know other teams, like the American team Haas has Ferrari engines, but that's like their shit one. Like they get the z 28 engine, we get the fucking rally sport, um, just for white trash people from the 70s. Um, so anyways, uh, I guess what happened? Sebastian Vettel one, the uh, on the Australian Grand Prix for Ferrari who went back to the Ferrari red or I guess less white in their car. The car is definitely look different, look like at different color red. And I was like, there's no way that there's like a specific read the Ferrari has to be, but it turns out they just had less white in the car this year. Uh, they went on to win it because, um, the Mercedes team I guess fucked up where, uh, Lewis Hamilton went into Pitt. They thought they had enough space between the fucking second place in first place. He was going to get out of the pit first or something like that. I don't know what, oh no, he was out on the track. I just saw the highlight. I don't fucking know. And they screwed up, but you know, it's fucked up. They blamed their software.

Speaker 1:          00:13:57       So it's just like, is there any sort of like, I dunno, racing going on. So they've got some computers looking where the fucking Sebastian Vettel's car is in the pit and wow. How fast they have to be going. What tar? The off the computer figures, all of that out. You got an APP and every now lily the APP, shit the bed. And uh, that'll got out first. And you know, Hamilton, he's always fucking sell cause it was, it was a nickel. Who's, are you all right? I love Hamilton, but he gets so fucking, he, oh, he just starts bleeding and whenever he fucking lose, um, I remember last year something happened and qualifying and then he just sat in his car for like fucking mean when, when you were a kid and he got mad at your parents or whatever, and they got out of the car, went in the house, you're trying to make a point. You just sat in the car in the driveway. They didn't give

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       a shit to like, great. How's, he'll be quiet without your fucking complainant acid in here. Um, so he ended up winning Ferrari one. Sebastian Vettel came in first, uh, a sulking. Lewis Hamilton came in second, Kimi Reagan, and he didn't drive anybody off. The track came in third. And, uh, Ricky Ricardo, Daniel Ricardo came in, uh, the hometown favorite came in in fourth place and what's his face fell. Terry Bolt. Haas, I guess he crashed, you're in qualifying and then was given us five spot penalty for uh, cause he changed a gearbox. He started in 15th and then ended up finishing eighth. But I think the real big story was how well the USA team with the sh the sh the fucking Ferrari engine, that Ferrari throughout in their back dumpster, um, was fucking killing it in the beginning. We will, I can fourth and sixth place at one point, a part of the only part of the race that I saw. And then, uh, I got all excited, you know, to look up to see where we finished. We finished 19th and 20th with two, not one, but did not finish, I guess. Evidently we know how to take the tire off, but we don't know how to put it back on.

Speaker 2:          00:16:09       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:16:09       Twice in the same race. One of the hottest cars went in.

Speaker 2:          00:16:15       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:16:15       To get their tire change their way. They put the fuck guitars back on. Three out of four were on but one wasn't.

Speaker 1:          00:16:25       They did that the first time and then the fucking mechanic was screwed it up was hilarious. They cut to the cut to the uh, the pit team and he just walked out of the camera shop. I think he went into the bathroom and close the door and probably throw up that he cost his team one of the cars, you know, and then the fucking, then they turned around and they did it again. But uh, they're keeping their chin up there saying, you know what? Well Ah, you know, if uh, you know, just stick. What would have happened if we actually put the bolts back? God, I'll tell you if Rorem Mercedes better look out because we're going to be practicing how to take a tire on and off when we get that down. I'm telling you things are going to be real shook up and the a fourth to six positions this year. Yeah. Boy, you know what it is. We're Americans. We don't give a shit. Okay cause this, this whole fucking Duh left turns and right turns the eye. We have land over here, fucking assholes in Europe and everywhere else around the world. You're all fucking over populated, driving around, fucking gone an old cow paths. Um, that's all I got. What else can I do? What do you do when you completely screw up? You know what you do? You make fun of the rest of the world.

Speaker 2:          00:17:43       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:44       It's exactly what you do. All right, let's get into some happier American news to Bruins. Once again, were down. They were down two to nothing to the Goddamn Dallas Stars. So down in fucking Dallas now they used to be the Minnesota north stars. Okay. And it was an eclectic group of incredibly normal looking people in the crowd. Okay. And, and the Minnesota people. Nice people. The kind of people you say hello to, or if you Philly fans, you throw full beers at. Right. Then they moved down to fucking Dallas. Okay. The fake teddy capital of the world.

Speaker 2:          00:18:30       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:18:31       All right. You know, you know silicone valley out there where they do all the fucking computer shit. You know, an Apple's big fucking all look at our round building with the forest in the middle of it. Um, that's where all the computer shit happens down in Hollywood's where all the movies get made out in Arizona is where they, they don't want to celebrate Martin Luther King Day New Mexico's where they shop breaking bad. And then you get out to Dallas, Texas. Okay. And you basically you have Dealey plaza and you have fake titties that is fucking Dallas. And then you have a bunch of shiny four door pickup trucks that has never seen a day of blue collar work driving around out there. I don't know why. I don't know why you think and they get them Cadillac. Um, everybody's acting like they got a ranch. Um, anyways, we went down, then we played them and we were down two to nothing and we score three goals and the third fucking period it was just, and of course I missed the game cause I got the kid now I was at, I was at a birthday party, a great birthday party.

Speaker 1:          00:19:38       We're now to a fucking farm and all of that. Had an awesome time, but I didn't get to see the game and I saw Tim shallows, fucking filthy shorthand for nice feed from Brad. My Sean Pasta had the game winner and it seems even though you know Theresa version runs out with a broken foot, I don't know if shower is back. Last game I saw he fell the way I used to fall when I was public at like a public skating rink. You know what I mean? Will you try to stop and then you catch an edge and all of a sudden you go like headfirst, do a face plant before the board's mercifully stopped. You've usually knocked down like a five year old trying to learn how to figure skate. Uh, I'm trying to say we have a lot of injuries but we're still winning. Ah, the Celtics on the other hand, Kyrie Irving is going to be out three to six weeks.

Speaker 1:          00:20:27       Sports illustrates website is telling me I don't need to panic. Toronto's going to get the number one seed and we're probably going to play some shit bomb fucking team and he'll be back by the end of it. I don't fucking know. Uh, I think Toronto's looking pretty strong. It's going to be obviously Toronto. Cleveland. When you think, when you think and can Lebron put his fucking team on his back once again. Okay. And get to the finals again while the entire basketball world shits on him and says how much he's an asshole and how much I've never seen a guy achieve more and get more shit. I just don't get it. What more does he have to do our right, he took his talents to south beach. All right. He won two championships on a pile on team, but then he went back to Cleveland, put the fucking team on his back and beat the Golden State Warriors. Right. Right there. It should have been over. It was over for Steve Young when he beat the fucking San Diego chargers.

Speaker 2:          00:21:26       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:21:27       Whew. Whew. Whew. Was it chuck Humphreys? Huge Humphreys. Chuck Humphreys.

Speaker 2:          00:21:36       I don't remember

Speaker 1:          00:21:39       Pete. That fucking team, one of the most boring super bowls there ever was 49 is went out and they had fucking white pants on and shit.

Speaker 2:          00:21:47       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:21:49       And then the monkey's been off his back and nobody ever fucking questioned him again. Ever questioned him again. Even after fucking spygate when he said the Patriot should give up their three fucking super bowl titles. You know the fucking guys on TV, he's in a hall of fame player. He didn't realize that that was a brand new rule and the patriots work guilty, but it was only illegal for one gay. Nobody gave him shit yet. They still give Lebron Shit. Why is that? Why do you think that is? Is it because Steve Young is a fucking moron? Um, I have no idea. Anyways, so I went to this birthday party, a two year old's birthday party, some friends of ours and there was this, uh, went out to the speaking ranches. We went out to this farm way the fuck out towards Oxnard. Came to Rio.

Speaker 2:          00:22:44       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:22:46       It was awesome. It's part, you know, part of Los Angeles. I very rarely go to, I fly over it, but I never fucking actually went out there. It was absolutely beautiful out there, past this fee me valley. And they had all like these animals and stuff. They're big animal farm and I realized that I am a big fan of Al packers. You know, there was this brown one just with these giant fucking brown eyes just looking at you. A little weird little wema admittedly a little weird, you know, they kind of look like Lama's still like better looking llamas, you know? Um, potbelly pig, which I never realized when people say, I got, you know, you got a pot belly. What an insult that is. I mean, these things were fat fucks. That belly was, was like on the ground.

Speaker 2:          00:23:38       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:23:40       They just like, they just, they fucking pigs. I mean, pigs really, our pigs, they always talk about how smart they are and that type of stuff. I think the level that they eat and the fact that they roll around in their own shit, it's just really hard to see the intelligence.

Speaker 2:          00:23:57       You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:24:00       I mean, I think a lot of fat people get treated the same way. Do you think if Albert Einstein was a fat fuck, like

Speaker 2:          00:24:09       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:24:10       I Dunno. Rolling around in his own shit. I mean, I don't think we, when World War Two, what do you guys think? You care to comment? Would you like to write into the podcast about that one? Um, I'm just filibustering here. I got to get this shit done cause I got all kinds of stuff to do today and I'm waiting for my advertising and my questions to come in and got, dammit. Oh, the reeds is sent. Oh Shit. Everything's fucking here. Ready to go. I love it. All right, let's download these. God Damn. Thanks. Um, so anyways, we were at where? Out there and uh, at that, at the birthday party, you got so fucked up about me. Loved to fuck all the birthday parties stuff. I, first thing I did was alpacas. I looked at those things and I'm like, wow, those things look like a food source because they said they were from South America.

Speaker 1:          00:24:57       So all of that picturing his boa constrictors and God knows what kill on those things, you know, or that like the Komodo Dragon, this time he sat this stock in this giant bull looking thing and did, did, did those Komodo dragons, they have such fucking shit breath in their mouth is so full of bacteria that if they all they to do, it was just nick and owl. An animal just did 10 times its size. It just need a bite it and then they just followed around for three days is that bacteria just slowly fucking kills the thing. I just wished the bull knew that the second one was bit by that fucking dragon that it was over because then you just do, you just turn around and blow. You're not going to fucking eat me.

Speaker 2:          00:25:42       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:25:43       right. Just go over and kill the fucking thing because the problem with those God damn reptiles and my issue with reptiles is they don't have the Dan Chimpanzees, they don't have the decency to kill you before they start eat. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:25:55       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:25:55       They don't know. Yeah. They don't like that thing. Once you collapse, it just walks up. It has no feeling whatsoever, you know, which is why chimpanzees and human beings are the worst chimpanzees and human beings. The only people I've ever seen get off on the suffering of something else. Like it actually excites them. I told you that. I think I saw that thing one time when they did for the longest time, they didn't think chimpanzees, monkeys, eight other monkeys, they disapproved it. They found out it wasn't true. And I saw these fucking chimpanzees catch this fucking smaller monkey. All right. And the, he just stood on the thing's fucking back and with his fingers was digging flesh out of its back as the other monkeys screaming. And the chip was getting off on a sec, dude. Like, you know, how fresh does it have to be?

Speaker 1:          00:26:43       Just snap. It's a little fucking neck and get on with it. Um, and ever since then, I fucking hate chimpanzees. I hate him. I hate him as much as I love, uh, uh, gorillas. But having said that, I don't want to see chimpanzees ever hurt though. You know, I, I, you know, although I wanted that bold to fucking destroy that Komodo dragon has it just kept falling around, you know, like some damn bank or watching a fucking farmer working himself to death, waiting to take over the land to sell to some other, fuck. All right, Bill, let's not get that dramatic. Okay. It's the wild. Get Mad at God. You created it. Um, it, well, I don't know if it's a fucking lady or not how fucked up, but human beings is, is big pieces of shit that we are, that uh, we actually think God looks like us and actually argue about what it's races or it's sex. It's the stupidest shit ever.

Here's what the fuck I was looking for. God dammit. Hey, speaking of that, am I in a Tulsa, Oklahoma this weekend? Speaking of southern accents? Margaret, I'll be down. There are no over there in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The Braden theater. Yes, I am March 30th Oh my God. I love it. What's today? Today's the 26 let's see here. That's Thursday. No, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. So this, say I'm going to be, um, at the Brady theater, Tulsa, Oklahoma. And then on March 31st I'm going to be down in San Antonio, Texas, right? They're stars at night are big and bright deep in the heart of Texas. What do they have their, what do they call that thing? That little fucking river that the river walk. It's actually really relaxing, you know, and then you don't really ever have to get off and buy anything. You just fucking sitting there floating around on a God damn boat. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:33:56       That's gonna be one of those weird flights where like it should only take me like an hour to go from fucking Tulsa, Oklahoma or 90 minutes to San Antonio. But it's going to take the whole fucking day cause they don't have to like connect through like Denver or some shit. Um, speaking of what she, I got some shows coming up in Pittsburgh April 6th and for whatever fucking reason, the only direct flight I could get out of La is a southwest flight. I don't understand Philly and Pittsburgh back in the day. The only direct flight from La to Philly was on u s air. I don't mind. I don't mind southwest Linda till they start telling the jokes, you know, and just fucking, it's so God damn obnoxious because nobody heckles him. That's what's missing on a southwest flight. Boeing, the jokes, you have such a captive audience. Everybody's afraid we're going to crash. You know, for some reason you think the steward or the store it is actually is flying the plane so you don't want to give him shit. Right. Oh God. That's what I wish I, you know, Patrice, I could just fucking see him and that if he ever saw what those fucking people per character,

Speaker 2:          00:35:14       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:35:15       He would have heckled.

Speaker 2:          00:35:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:35:18       Hey, he definitely would have fucking happened. Um, I just sit there stewing and anger and not even mad at the fucking steward or stewardess is, which I still call them, by the way. I don't understand how the fuck that ever became offensive. You know what I mean? Or they feel like steward had

Speaker 2:          00:35:39       mmm.

Speaker 1:          00:35:41       Like, I don't know, come up to it. Why is, I mean, look this up, why is Stuart is offensive? I might be wrong. Here's why. Flight attendants don't like being called stewardesses.

Speaker 1:          00:36:04       All right. Flight attendants. Oh man, they got an old fucking school one. Look how hot they used to be. I swear to God, they must have fucking drop the pay dramatically. I Dunno what they used to be. Fucking gorgeous. Unbelievable. All right. Flight, but the food was way worse. There's always a tradeoff, right? Um, flight attendants have a job that holds a lot of prestige in the eyes of most travelers. Y and w what? There's a giant vague bullshit statement. I think that used to be when the, when they were beautiful women, it seemed glamorous. The whole thing. The pilot seemed like a fucking borderline James Bond. There's all these sexy women fucking walking around like wow, they get to go to all of these places before everybody flew her all the time.

Speaker 2:          00:36:58       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:37:00       People you actually used to dress up when they went on planes wearing suits and women get all dolled up and shit. You know, this is before they treated you like a fucking animal though. Then they started treating everybody like animals. Now people walk in and on that, getting the borderline pajamas. Anyways, they get called a lot of different things while doing their jobs. Waitress, ma'am? Hey, you miss air hostess and Trolley Dolly. Okay. You know what? I have well over a million fucking a frequent flier miles. I've never heard anybody say waitress. No one's ever said, hey, you air hostess. Hey Trolley Dolly, get I get a fucking drag. C'Mon. I'm sure everybody has a story, but come on. I think pretty much everybody's been respectful as certainly after nine 11, because then all the stewards and stewardesses, all they have to say is, uh, why are you being hostile? Do you not want to fly today? Uh, anyway, some flight attendants have a job then Obama. Okay. Uh, but one moniker that is pretty much gone out. The emergency exit door is stewardess. And here's why I love it. This person just made up all of this other shit waitress, ma'am. Hey you

Speaker 1:          00:38:16       trolley Dolly just made up all of that shit so they could get to this stewardess part. All right. I think it's safe to say that a strip tease ad for an airline like this one from Braniff international airways below would not fly today. Yeah. A lot of things from back then wouldn't fly today. Uh, at least not in America. Oh, look at that. Um, but this type of ad, which most would now consider objectifying towards women.

Speaker 2:          00:38:47       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:38:47       Was the only way to go in the sex cells day. Okay. Sorry. I was thinking about clicking on the video. I was doing the math, whether I could do that and not get in trouble because I'm advertising on this, sorry. Let me go back to trying to read this. Uh, was the only way to go in the sex cells day of the early jet age. Oh yeah. Because they don't use sex to sell anything anymore. A brand Braniff was hugely popular in its heyday. Uh, their flight attendants war psychedelic trends from some are fashions top designers such as Emilio Pucci. Oh, he fell off on a murder. That fucking Guy Pacific southwest airlines was another airline average. I'm going to watch this fucking video. Let's see what's going on here. Uh, Pacific salesforce airlines was another airline press start to play with color course advertising. And it's a bunch of sexy women winking at me and all this using sex to sell.

Speaker 2:          00:39:47       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:39:47       In 2018.

Speaker 2:          00:39:49       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:39:50       What is going on here? It's just another ad. This is an ad for Disneyland. Oh, you know what? Go Fuck Yourself. Fuck this video. Is this just clickbait? Is that what I've done here? Um,

Speaker 2:          00:40:07       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:40:08       Was it another and can I tell you something right now? I guarantee you all these fucking hotties that were on this airline, they weren't the ones that bitched. It was ugly women that couldn't get the fucking job. I can, I'm so sick of like this certain jobs, you should just be good. Lucky. Okay. And as a fucking, uh, unsightly human being, I feel like I can say this shit, right?

Speaker 2:          00:40:28       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:40:28       Yeah. Like you walk into a restaurant, you want to see somebody good looking,

Speaker 2:          00:40:33       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:40:34       You know, hotel, gym, all of that Shit, this fucking thing. Now that you don't have to be good looking and you can be like a, you know, overweight and all of that stuff is, that's really not helping out fat people. I can tell you that yes, they're getting a job, but there's still eating their way to a fucking early grave who doesn't want to live. It's sort of what you're doing is as much as you're giving them a job, you're also in this roundabout way in kind of doing this assisted suicide, you kind of a part of it, right? In a food sense. I don't know what I'm talking about, but I'm going to continue speaking. Um, Pacific southwest airlines was another airline that advertise the attractiveness of its flight attendance. They introduced the miniskirt 1965 in our book, long legs and short nights form a PSA flight attendant, Maryland trips said they used to be a distinction between flight and stewardesses. Flight attendants were there for safety while stewardesses were there to be eye candy. Flirt and serve drinks. Yeah, that's your job.

Speaker 1:          00:41:46       The pilot passes out. Do you know how to fly to fucking plane? Well then start waking at people. This sweetheart, um, she noted stewardesses were not allowed to do pa announcements because nobody could understand, okay, this is getting a little weird, therefore, let's face it. They were deep. They were along for the ride. Now they weren't. They were like, they were serving drinks. Maryland, trich Schwartz contacted me to let me know that I had misunderstood a quote and there was not a distinction between stewardesses in flight attendants. They merely changed the job titles once more men joined the industry. Yeah. These were called stewards when she referred to stewardesses as they, because she was one herself. I misinterpreted that to mean that there were actually two different jobs. So this guy really doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about. Oh, this woman,

Speaker 2:          00:42:37       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:42:38       what am I reading here? I don't even know many modern and dare I say, older flight attendants now considered stewardess a derogatory term toward their profession and even their personal virtue because they take their job more seriously. That being there is simply too

Speaker 2:          00:42:54       okay

Speaker 1:          00:42:54       to serve as eye candy. All right. Uh, I'm done with this fucking article. All right. I learned absolutely nothing other than the astounding lack of fucking research. I mean, I thought only I did that on my podcast, this fucking person and like he literally his article rather than going back and correcting it, he's fucking correct. And himself, like he writes the article out and I realized I fucked up. But he's just continuing on. Yeah. I mean at the, at the end of the fucking day, like this is just, I think what really fucking happened, it was flying back then was glamorous. Okay. It was way more glamorous. She got treated way more. It was considered an, an an an an an amazing luxury.

Speaker 2:          00:43:46       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:43:47       To be able to fly now everybody, everybody fucking flies. They Jamey in the back, you know, you have to pay for food.

Speaker 2:          00:43:56       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:43:57       I mean, back then it was like coffee tea or me was, was, that was basically the, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:44:03       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:44:04       The vibe back debt, you know what I mean? And they're acting like,

Speaker 2:          00:44:09       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:44:10       I dunno. I Dunno what they're active, they're, they're acting like a, the that, that there weren't some fucking women that that was an appealing job to not everybody has a dream.

Speaker 2:          00:44:25       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:44:26       That's, you know, something that's, maybe that's what's going on right now was fucking all of the medias is that everybody's acting like they're fucking Joe Montana. You know what I mean? That they're like an Oscar winner. It's just most of us would just put background. That's it. Where that guy in the fucking middle seat staring at the cell, a woman serving them peanuts, that is way out of their league that you'd never have the balls to talk to. Not now. Everybody's a winner. According to Oprah. You could do whatever you want. It's going to be great. All your dreams are gonna come true. Nobody's going to try to steal your ideas. There's plenty of room for everybody.

Speaker 2:          00:45:05       Top of the mountain.

Speaker 1:          00:45:09       I, that's just not the case. I hate to say that. If just go out and look at a mountain, just look at the shape of this. Plenty of room down the bottom. There is a, you know, there's less but still a lot of room in the middle. But as you keep going higher and higher, you know, I don't know. I don't even know what I'm talking about. I still don't understand why. So basically,

Speaker 2:          00:45:31       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:45:31       Flight attendants wanted to distill, still doing the same fucking job. I Dunno. Maybe now they, they actually know CPR or some shit like that, that took a couple of Mas classes.

Speaker 2:          00:45:48       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:45:48       Um, but you know, what are they, what are they going to tell him? You know what I mean? I mean, if, if, if like some terrorists go to take over the plane, do they also have like Chinese stars that they're allowed to bring onto the fucking plane?

Speaker 2:          00:45:59       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:46:00       Um, plead people, I don't want to be called a comedian anymore. I think that's offensive because people just feel like I'm going to have a lampshade on my head. I would now like to be called a, uh, a humor doctor, doctor humor something, or I'll come up with it. I don't, I don't want to, um, I think it's very sexist. It's be called the comedian.

Speaker 2:          00:46:28       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:46:32       I don't know why. And you know, other languages have male and female things. So I think that's the thing. I'm in my business to comedian, they want to be called a comedian. We have a community and coming to the stage, look, why do you have to just make a distinction?

Speaker 1:          00:46:45       I don't know why. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I'm just, can we get a gender neutral microphone? It was out there. That's probably gonna be the next thing. Maybe that microphones are shaped too much. Like dicks. They get above like a hermaphrodite style one. You can have like a dick coming out of vagina. Uh, you know, something maybe like those old school Elvis. Once you get to have that and just bad, like, I don't know what you speak into. Looks like a clip. I don't know. Is this technically even like still a podcast? Let me just get to the questions this week that went nowhere, by the way. And I know a lot of it was ignorant and, uh, I think I stand by it. Um, all right, let's get to the, uh, let's get to the questions here. Jesus fucking Christ.

Speaker 2:          00:47:38       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:47:39       Become a pilot.

Speaker 2:          00:47:41       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:47:41       You know, do that then

Speaker 1:          00:47:45       become a pilot. Run an airline. You want respect to them. Okay. You fucking do that. These P he's bullies. People on special teams all of a sudden want to be treated like quarterbacks. I, it's just, you're not a quarterback. Sorry. Um, oh shit.

I've always wanted to live in their neighborhood with you. So let's make the most of this beautiful day.

Speaker 1:          00:48:58       Don't call them stewardesses and don't say, hey, columns, flight attendants make it seem like they have a master's degree. Would you like some fucking peanuts? You will respect me and my slacks. Hello, Mr Neighbors. Uh, Mr. Rogers movie. Hey there, bill, I'm writing to you here from Minneapolis and very much looking forward to your upcoming show here. You know, back when I was a kid, you know, getting treated like shit motivated you to get a better job, not demand that your, you fucking be treated with respect at the low level that you had attained in the job world. Anyway, I was wondering if you heard about the movie being made about Mr. Rogers starring Tom Hanks is Fred Rogers. Coincidentally, a movie trailer was also just released for a new documentary about Fred Rogers that just premiered at Sundance and it looks awesome. I grew up watching Mr. Rogers as a kid and it's really refreshing to look back at some of the clips that show what a great one of a kind person he was.

Speaker 1:          00:50:04       Did you grow up watching Mr. RogersRogers' neighborhood? Yes, I did. Mister McFeely speedy delivery. And if so, what were your thoughts about them making a movie about him? Maybe you have a different perspective now that you have a kid because it seems like there's so much awful shit that kids are exposed to on TV and the Internet. And Mr. Rogers was a rare TV show, which actually helps kids to become better human beings. Last but not least, would you consider auditioning for this shows? Longtime guests? Mister McFeely? I think you'd look hilarious and that mailman hat and when with the spectacles and the mustache, thanks for being a great neighbor and go fuck yourself. Ah, I absolutely would play mister McFeely. Um, I loved, I loved Mr. Rogers when I was a kid. I like sesame street better. Um, and there was something about him that did make me a little uncomfortable when I was a kid. I will admit that. No, you know what? I didn't like lady Elaine and King Friday. I liked the trolley when it went into the uh, the make believe land or whatever. But um, I dunno, Lady Lane and, and King Friday, they just used to make me sick to my stomach.

Speaker 2:          00:51:21       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:51:21       They just weren't as funny and they didn't have the personality of like Ernie or Grover Harry the cookie monster. I mean, there was just those who liked the guys guys have puppets over there on sesame street. I just thought it Mr. RogersRogers' neighborhood was, it was just a little stiff. But um, I've, I imagined that I learned a bunch of great lessons. I was too young to understand like, oh, this guy's trying to teach me how to be a better person. You know, it was just a kid watching the shit go. Wouldn't that be cool if we had a trolley in our house and then he could get on it and it go to a magical neighborhood and avoid king Friday and Lady Elaine, she was fucking weird looking to right I to look this up here, lady Elaine Lady Lady. How do you spell a lane? Oh yeah. Yeah. She was ugly. Is there, what does my God lay off the Booze Lady Lane Fairchild. I never knew. The last name is a neighborhood and mischief maker. And having learned from the wizard of loophole, which often uses or boomerang tumor Marangu summa rang. Oh my God, I forgot about that. To do things such as rearranged the neighborhood or turn it upside down. She's credited with the discovery of planet purple, purple, which she found while flying in or something or other.

Speaker 1:          00:52:47       Well, you know, that would never happen. Now that would be considered sexist. Oh, why? Why does the woman have to be the bad person? Well, she's in a position of power. Isn't that enough? No. Ah, what are you doing? Come on. Um, alright. Do I, I, I think Tom Hanks is going to do a great job because he always does. You know, you look how we just said that like he's an up and coming actor rather than the two times back to back. Best actor. Um, do I call him an actress now? Is that progressive? Should I not identify by his gender? I don't fucking know. I don't know. I don't, I don't know what, what to do right now. Uh, I think it'd be interesting if they actually get into his, his whole life, you know? But if it's just Tom Hanks doing an episode of Mr. Rogers and then, I dunno. I Dunno what the, I don't fucking know. I watch sports. Why would you ask me about movies? All right. Linkedin business APP. Dear Billy, balloon head. My girlfriend and I had been together, his girlfriend, one or two words. There was two, one word. My girlfriend and I have been together for a year. For the past two months. She's been out of work.

Speaker 1:          00:54:06       So two months. It has been using this business app to get work online. It has never bothered me as of revenue. I think you said recently as of Raven reverently me, she has been getting notifications from the APP. I don't know what any of that means. I didn't think anything of it, but I noticed that she had gotten a message in the middle of the night. Oh, as of recently. This is a voice text. Reverently reverently me as of recently, she has been getting notifications from the APP. I didn't think anything of it.

Speaker 1:          00:54:47       Um, but I've noticed that she has gotten messages, gotten a message in the middle of the night. I asked her about it and she always tells me that it's strictly professional and that is just business men seeking to employ. Do you think that APP is just a cover up for meeting men? She would meet on apps like Tinder. Um, I don't know dude, but it doesn't sound like you fucking trust your, uh, your girlfriend, which is definitely an issue. So what you have done, you have to figure out as if you don't trust her because she got saying she shady or is it some, some of your own shit that you brought because of a previous relationship or possibly something that happened? She was a child when you were watching Mr. Rogers calling women's stewardesses. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:55:39       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:55:40       I Dunno. It's possible women are really good at fucking around, which is why they don't get caught as much as guys do. Guys, you know, guys are the worst. You know, we just fucking, we get caught. Um, anyways he wants, I dunno, I dunno what to tell you to do there.

Speaker 2:          00:56:01       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:56:01       so now you got to start snooping and then if you get caught in you're wrong, then what? Where does that leave you

Speaker 1:          00:56:11       just tell her it's making you feel insecure and you would just, can you just, you know, and it's your issue. Can you just see one of the texts next time it happens and then just say, sorry, I dunno, I just love these sub black and I was worried that somebody else was still a year. Passions. Talk your way out of it that way. Does that work? I don't know. This is not professional advice. He wants to get married. I don't, I hate built your fountain of Cynical Humor and knowledge that I've admired for years. Yo, you are a fountain of Jesus Christ. So I wanted to ask some advice. Hey, this is not professional advice. My boyfriend proposed two years ago after I said yes. He said he wanted to keep it a secret since he hadn't met my parents yet, except via Skype calls. They live across the country by parents kept canceling their plans to visit last minute.

Speaker 1:          00:57:04       So he planned to visit them for this past Christmas where he would publicly propose Jesus. Chris is the longest proposal ever. I kept this a secret for two years. We only had two fights, but each time he broke off the engagement, only do apologize and make up the next day. One month prior to the trip, he says he wants to postpone proposing due to finances since we will be moving to another state after I graduate. I understand. Uh, why spend five grand on a wedding when we'll soon need that to get a house while the next day he admitted. The other reason is because I had gained weight after getting on birth control and anxiety met. Yeah, you fuck this guy?

Speaker 2:          00:57:45       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:57:46       I'm getting a Master's in physics and have a part time job. So sorry if I couldn't hit the gym enough. Uh, well that's no excuse. She should also fucking eat well. And I'm not saying that about him and your, your relationship would do it for yourself because uh, you really do not want the health issues that fucking start earliest in your late thirties and your forties. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:58:12       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:58:12       You know, I've lost friends to heart attack set look like they're in the same shape as me, but I dunno, you got to get checked up. Um, just cause you're busy. This is what you do. You're fucking cook all your food on the weekend and that you get, you got to make that up fucking priority cause it's going to be stressful enough. But anyways, ice, I still maintain it this point. Fuck this guy. Anyways, that Christmas was so depressing, but who could I talk to? The engagement was a secret. I told him being engaged was a joke. I don't want to be on this rollercoaster anymore or ever again. Now he started because he says marriage is, it is important to him. He does want to marry me. Just not yet hot. No thanks. I'm good. He said, well we'll just revisit this later. Your thoughts from one cynical ginger to another thanks to the left. Yeah. Fuck this guy. Fuck this guy. This, this is what, this is what,

Speaker 2:          00:59:08       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:59:09       this guy's an asshole.

Speaker 1:          00:59:12       I want to postpone the engagement because you gain weight. That's what the fuck. You going to hitch your wagon to? Fuck this guy. Fuck that guy. Um, and you seem really strong and [inaudible], you know, you're getting his master's degree in physics. You can be out there designing roller coasters or whatever the fuck you're going to be doing. You don't need this guy. By the way, I watched this thing that I have recorded. You know my wife's, we thank you. We need stuff on the Dvr, right? Whatever the fuck you call it nowadays. So we had to go back and erase a bunch of shit that I taped. I kept all my Superbowl highlights. I kept 'em the Patriots for Seattle and Patriots first. Atlanta had no problem erasing patriots versus eagles. Um, and I don't know where those patriots, verse giants Games went. Geez. Um, Ethel Merman. All right. You want to talk about a fucking hilarious human being? Uh, I got to find this fucking thing. Ethel Merman. She was all right. We were watching this fucking thing on the JFK inauguration, which was supposed to be broadcast by NBC. And, uh, there was a horrific snow storm. They were in this weird venue. It was like Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole, Ethel Merman, uh, uh, Milton Berle.

Speaker 1:          01:00:39       Who else? Gene Kelly. Harry Belafonte, Ella Fitzgerald. I mean, it was crazy lineup and I'm Jimmy Duranti and all this shit. This was like a, it was a big deal. This is the first time like marrying Hollywood and politics now where that's led us is probably a bad thing. But

Speaker 2:          01:01:02       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:01:05       It was just on a, watching all these performances and everything. So watch an Ethel Merman and she's literally wearing just like this winter coat during the performance because she went there for rehearsals and she got stuck in the snow and couldn't get back to a hotel and she was a Republican and still sang to the president rather than all these fucking Douche is today. It'd be like, Oh, good look good is the shit right. And then she put politics aside and she did it. And as she was singing near just goes like, she said something like that. There's, there's a fucking there right there, there is a tough broad. And I just started laughing. I said, what do you mean? She goes, you could just see it. She's, she's been through it all, bunch of asshole guys and she survived. She's seen it all and blah blah. So I look her up and of course [inaudible] was 100% right. She'd been married like four times and she was married one time for like three months to earn as Borgnine and they got divorced. All they did was argue and she, one of the things she said was extreme cruelty. So there's a quote, I wish I could find the fucking thing. Um, let me, I got to find, cause I, cause she it so perfectly. You want to talk about somebody hilarious that you've loved to hang out with? Uh,

Speaker 2:          01:02:29       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:02:30       Earnest. I just put in Ethel Merman. Earnest cunt.

Speaker 2:          01:02:36       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:02:36       Ernest Borgnine. Ethel Merman. There we go. The classic Ethel Merman Story. All right, I'll of course this is going to be some dude's turning it into an entire fucking

Speaker 2:          01:02:49       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:02:49       Tire fucking blog.

Speaker 2:          01:02:52       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:02:53       God damn ass holes. Okay. Yeah. So she was in her brief marriage. Mirman was on some fucking um,

Speaker 2:          01:03:04       yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:03:05       she was on some fucking movie set and she came home, she was all excited because the director had complimented her saying her if she had the voice of like a 25 year old, you know the face and she was like, she was like 60, all right, 35 year old face and a 35 year old figure. And she said, and then Ernest Borgnine said, oh yeah, it goes, did he bring up your old content? And she goes, no, he didn't mention you once. Stuff like that. I Dunno, they fight. This isn't, this isn't written as well. And what about your 65 year old cut and she said, nobody mentioned you at all. I've seen this thing written like five different ways. She also did it. She did a guest star on some set comp and they had a curse jar and she was in the middle of whatever sketch they would do it. And then she just stopped. She goes, what the hell is this going? And then the star of the show was just like a Bethel, you know, my rule that'll cost you a dollar. And She just goes out. Howdy. What would it cost me to tell you to go fuck yourself?

Speaker 1:          01:04:14       So Ethel Merman. Ethel Merman is a new, um, a new, I'm a big fan of hers. Um, unfortunately she passed away a long time ago, so you can't go out and have a drink with her, but just seemed fucking hilarious. All right, let me read the last goddamn question here so I can move on with my fucking life.

Speaker 2:          01:04:34       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:04:36       Why do I keep doing this? I keep going away from my fucking, the questions here. This is like unprecedented the amount of times I fucked this up and you guys have to listen to me, uh, on precedent for this podcast, I should say. All right, content. Here's the last one. The last one.

Speaker 2:          01:04:53       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:04:53       He is a jealous boyfriend. I love that the women are finally right now. All right. Hello Bill Burr. I really love your podcast. Thank you. When I was wondering what your thoughts on a situation I am going through. This is my first serious relationship. My boyfriend and I just moved in about four months ago. I have, oh, I have always fucking known that he's bent over protective and jealous. However, I did started to progress more and more. Oh, get out, get out. I trust him that he's not cheating on me. Of course, like many other women, I can be self conscious and think that maybe he could stray or do better, but I've never once accused him of cheating on me. Not once, however, he has caused me

Speaker 1:          01:05:40       what he has caused me of cheating on. He's accused do, these are all voice texts he has caused me of cheating on him. He's accused me of cheating on him multiple times. The worst case of when it should have been up, which he made accusations, uh, was fairly recently. I just got a full, a new full time job. I was only working part time minimum wage job, which I'm very excited about that this full time job. Um, so that he's not the only one working. I feel like I can contribute now. However, he started accusing me of cheating on him with someone at work, even though there is no evidence, he even started accusing me of cheating on him with his own cousin. He's the one that helped me get the job is act, use of Tint to dump this guy. His accusations are not just him speaking, but yelling, hitting walls and scaring me to the point like he might get violent. Ah, right. Here's what should do.

Speaker 2:          01:06:38       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:06:39       Okay. Put a deposit down on another fucking apartment. Okay. One day when he goes to work, you take a fucking sick day, all right? You get a friend, you clear all your shit out of there,

Speaker 2:          01:06:54       okay?

Speaker 1:          01:06:55       Yeah. Fuck this guy. Fuck this guy. All right? You don't want to be anywhere near this guy. You don't want to be around this guy when you break up with him, he seems like a, I don't like any of this. Uh, he doesn't even want me to wear shorts and we live in this area that gets hot. I am not the type of person to show a lot of skins. However, when it's hot, I would like to wear shorts. He Isi. What's going on here? This guy's taking over your whole life. I'm just wondering if this, if his thoughts that me wearing shorts is disrespectful to him to the point he is just the f. Wait a minute. I'm just wondering if his thoughts that me wearing shorts is different. It's disrespectful to him to the point he is justified breaking up with me over this.

Speaker 2:          01:07:39       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:07:40       I am not sure where to draw the line. Oh, you should have drawn the line of while ago are now, let me ask you this. If any girlfriend you had was telling you this story, you would be like, get the fuck out. Right. I really believe that. I love and care about him. That's the problem. However, when he does.

Speaker 2:          01:07:56       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:07:56       when love, when does love turn into more of an obsession? Also, what is considered an abusive or unhealthy relationship? I would say this. I would really like to know your thoughts. You are straight up and I believe you'll be able to give some good advice, especially since you will not have real bias since you don't know us. Thank you. Yeah, you should get the fire as far as your version. What's going on? You should

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       get the fuck out of here. Just the fact that he's choosing you are cheating on him. Um, and what's your, what's his cousin, which is fucking weird. And then yelling and hitting the walls. I mean, you're already out. You're already gone. You should be gone. And now, uh, the fact that he's telling you what you can and can't wear. Fuck this guy. So the problem is as you moved in with the guy, so if you break up with the guy, what are you going to go into another room and then you've got to worry about this guy, you know, doing God knows what. Um, do you have any male friends? Do you have a brother? Somebody, you know, they can help protect you when you get your shit out of there. I would get another fucking, I mean, I, this is the type of situation I wouldn't fuck you pride. I would move back in with my parents if I had to and drive longer to work the fuck out of that. Um, and uh, I'd be it sees he's breakup ever as far as the reasons. Uh, I dunno, cause you don't trust me because you think I'm fucking your cousin to the point, your raw acting like Jeff Goldbloom and the fly and start punching the goddamn door jams out. Oh. And by the way, it's 90 degrees out and I can't wear shorts because you and your fragile ego can't fucking handle it. And I wouldn't say it this way because this guy sounds like a lunatic. Um,

Speaker 3:          01:09:44       I dunno what, what could you say that would just make this guy go away? Just say, ah, you know, I just decided that I want to get really fat and wear shorts and I didn't want to put you through that. I don't know what to tell you, but I would get out of this. And when somebody is violent like this, uh, I would be concerned about your own safety. So like I said, I would take a, uh,

Speaker 2:          01:10:06       okay.

Speaker 3:          01:10:07       This is what you do. All right. I figured you, you sound like a young, so you probably don't have that much shit.

Speaker 2:          01:10:13       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:10:13       So, uh, I would just, whatever your friend is that's going to help you move out. You put the boxes together over her house. All right? And then bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump. You fucking go in there. All right. You just act like you go into work and then you don't fucking go to work.

Speaker 3:          01:10:34       Okay. And, and uh, I would even tell you boss, just say, listen, I am living with a guy I have to break up with and I'm afraid he's going to get violent. So he's at work today. Uh, I'm going to act like I'm going to work and I'm going to clear my shit out of that. And I think you should be fine. And then you guys fucking, and he'd probably be like, you want some fucking help? You know, cause he's a good dude and then ball. So He's maybe, maybe he's trying to fuck you. Wait a minute. Maybe a boyfriend's actually make it a good point. No, I'm kidding. Go in there and I would just clear all your fucking shit out and uh, I would fucking yeah. And I would go live somewhere else.

Speaker 3:          01:11:13       Uh, then I would have one last conversation with this guy and I would change my cell phone number. That's it. Eh, uh, I dunno. Depending on where the fuck you live, maybe you can just, he won't be able to find your butter. Yeah. This is just, this is good. This is the beginning. This has the beginnings of someone that's going to stalk you and possibly do something fucking horrible. Fuck this guy. All right. I wish my wife was here to hear this God damn email. She's always talking about, you know, how fucking difficult a person I am. You know, I'm going to fucking print this email out and put it on her side of the bed, on the pillow.

Speaker 3:          01:11:58       I shouldn't be making jokes like this. Yeah, I would get the fuck out of it. Uh, and that's it. And I will, uh, go find love with somebody that's excited that she got a new job, but you're going to be participating and that a, and let you wear shorts when it's hot out. There you go. Everybody, that's the podcast for this week. Go fuck yourselves and I'll check it on, uh, on Thursday. Could we congratulations to the Ferrari team for winning. The next one is, I believe in Bahrain or something like that, and then they go to fucking Singapore. All right, I'll see you.
