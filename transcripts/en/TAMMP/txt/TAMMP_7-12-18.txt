Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on? It's bill bird is time for the Thursday afternoon, just before Friday. Monday morning podcast.

Speaker 3:          00:00:07       Ah,

Speaker 1:          00:00:10       just checking in. Are you?

Speaker 2:          00:00:13       What's going on? How are Ya this? Some happy people out there. There's some sad people out. There was a wonderful couple of days of soccer. Here are all the World Cup

Speaker 1:          00:00:24       France. Oh, Hall Beats Belgium

Speaker 2:          00:00:28       and England falls to Croatia. It's calming, omits calming. Oh my file. He looked it up to see like, why did they keep saying

Speaker 1:          00:00:38       that it's coming home? You know,

Speaker 2:          00:00:42       I immediately assumed like, well, obviously England must've won the most championships and this is their arrogant fucking way of being like, yeah, this is where it rightfully belongs. Kind of like when the Yankees win a world series and then all those fucking talking heads on on Espn logo and everything is all is right in baseball again. It's why. Why? Because a $200 million team won a fucking playoff series play off.

Speaker 1:          00:01:14       Turns out that's not what it is. Evidently the game of soccer. Now this might our football footie, whatever the fuck you call it, evidently it was according to the English, it was created in England. They were the ones who decided despite the fact that you have four limbs, you can only use two. They wanted a degree of difficulty. They weren't like the animals over here. You know where we get bored and I'm like, pick it up, you know, tackle them, which meant jump on his back and throw him to the fucking ground. That now a tackle over there. As you trip, somebody stick your foot out and you trip up. So evidently it started over there. That's what they're saying. So that's what it meant because I thought it meant that they had the most championships. And then I looked up a all time World Cup champions.

Speaker 1:          00:02:05       All right, what you got to do? How the fuck do you not to do? I don't give a fuck what the sport is. I to know who dominated it. Turns out Brazil since 1930 they won the most. They've won five 58 60 to 794 and 2002 which is a fucking lot considering it's every four years. How many there've been one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, 91011121314 1520. This is the 21st one. They've won 21 like whatever they fucking was that 20% of 25% of them then Germany? Yeah, they, they got for Italy has four [inaudible] they should have had five in 94. I remember that one. Uh, Argentina hand to God, that guy, whatever his name was. Uh, the hell was that guy's name? Diego or some shit. What the fuck was his name? I used to know his name.

Speaker 4:          00:03:01       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:03:02       Yeah. One of those fucking names where it's just like the second they gave him that his name, it's just like pussy is going to be raining down on this guy. Right. Um, I forget the hand of God guy. That guy. It was weird. He was like in shape and he also looked fat. What the fuck was his name?

Speaker 1:          00:03:20       Diego. Eric Gamo was something like that. I can't fucking remember. Then, uh, I got my hope. I say this right. I always, always Uruguay or go away. Won it twice. And then England, France, and Spain of all one at once. That's interesting cause I thought Spain was a powerhouse and I would've thought in England won a bunch way back in the day when it's probably just a bunch of white guys running around. Right? Yeah. I also don't want, so that's why they say it's coming home. It's not some arrogant shit. It's like, Hey, you know, this game that the whole world loves, you know, not to pat ourselves on the back, but guess what? We came up with it.

Speaker 4:          00:03:56       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:03:56       It's our shit. Okay. Everything, you know, every, you know, it's not just all about colonization, the caste system and it's slaving people of other colors around the world. It's not just about, that's not all we did. Okay. Yay. Hey, hey, you want to focus on the negative? You could do that. Okay. But you can't deny that the beautiful game of football known as soccer over here in the states.

Speaker 4:          00:04:26       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:27       As we sit around eating hobbies. Right.

Speaker 4:          00:04:30       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:31       Was evidently created in England. I don't know when they did it. You think for it to have a World Cup by 1934 to sweep the fucking nation. Wait a minute.

Speaker 4:          00:04:47       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:04:47       They also had an empire back then. Oh, I get it. So they came up with this game. They'd come in, they'd fucking take you over. They'd fucking kill a bunch of people and everybody was like, man, these guys are fucking assholes, man. Hi. Settle down. Settle down when to teach you a little game. All right. You can't use your arms slaughter. You had your arms chopped off because you couldn't find any gold anyways, so this is going to work real well for you. All I can use as your feet and your fucking head and the game spread like wildfire across the globe

Speaker 1:          00:05:27       as England expanded her empire. I never understood why it was considered female. Was that the tone it down? That was a bunch of Luna guys going around the world going there. This is a nice place to live. Too Bad. There's other people here. What can we do about this? Hi, everybody does it right. Everybody's done it since the beginning of time. You go back, you go back far enough in history books. This is what all guilty white people do. Everybody. Yeah. You know Africans enslaved other African jewelry always say that shit, try get past it. You know it's like the Billy Joel Song. We didn't start the fire, which has got to be the most classic, the most classic fucking baby boomer response. I mean what a fucking baby. He couldn't even take a little bit of responsibility.

Speaker 4:          00:06:15       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:06:15       You know, hey, you know we, we can start with you and he starts naming all his shit. Half of it is like pop stars like Marilyn Monroe. What did she have to do with foreign policy? I know she fucked a couple of Kennedy's but I mean other than that, I don't think that dictated whether or not we went into Cuba. Doris Day fucking [inaudible] to Bubba popup trouble. Linda sue as the fuck he do. He must've been on blow when he wrote that song. It's like, Billy, are you going to take any responsibility for this self centered cons that the baby boom generation was? I'm not saying everything you did was bad. I mean, he invented the Frisbee, right? Was that you guys, who was that the greatest generation.

Speaker 4:          00:06:59       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:00       I don't know. Somewhere in there there's gotta be truth, right. From the greatest generation.

Speaker 4:          00:07:06       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:07:06       You know, that generation also didn't want to play baseball. Jackie Robinson, by the way, uh, to the baby boomers who are, you know, widely considered the most selfish cunts, you know, this country has ever produced. Right. Just sitting around staring at the navel. You know, this is the dawning of the age, right? That's the same generation that gave us hippies.

Speaker 4:          00:07:34       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:07:35       But surely Bergen stocks.

Speaker 4:          00:07:38       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:38       You know, fucking in the mud at a concert.

Speaker 4:          00:07:41       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:07:42       I used to have a theory way back in the day, you know, when they talked about HIV and aids, they always said that, you know, it was some, somebody, you know, it was already somewhat a monkey or some shit and some guy in France. Got It. Um, I never thought it was then. I used to have a theory that, you know, if you watched the woodstocks tapes and you just see all those naked white people rolling around fucking each other in the mud, I mean, he can't tell me that something didn't come out of that, you know, at least a stronger strain of the mumps. Right. So anyways, to get back to it, you know, I was, I was, uh, working, uh, as an actor. I was act during the last couple of days and I was talking to this dude going like, yeah, how come England keeps saying it's coming home? When they were talking about the World Cup and he goes out with his saying those colonize and constantly fucking dude went off. I was just like, you know, white people, what, when we're not all bad. I mean there's some things, you know, Oh, windows curtains, you know, we've done some nice things, you know, now you can look out your house and see all the, the lack of opportunity, right, right. From inside your house without white. Am I actually taking credit for windows?

Speaker 1:          00:09:00       I Dunno. I have no idea. I don't read. Oh, speaking of which, oh my God. Oh my God. I said on my last podcast that the Obama's bought an $82 million house. Turned out it was an eight point $1 million house. It wasn't even 8.2 million. That's how off I was it. This is my favorite thing. So now all these people like what? We're all gone. What did you do? Your fucking homework man, like nothing makes people flip out. Not even religion, unless you make fun of Muslims, then those fucking lunatics a liable to do something, but fucking if you make, if you make fun of like a Democrat or Republican, nothing brings people out of the woodworks. All these people are like, why don't you do your fucking homework? Blah Blah. Which is hilarious. This whole podcast is based on me not doing any homework, not reading whatsoever, so I'm just going to tell you, you political cuts out there. You've got a lot of fucking nerve. A lot. I just said AIDS came for white people fucking in the mud at Woodstock. Are you going to come back at me on that one? What did you do? Your fucking homework, man, this whole podcast exists for one reason and one reason only. It's to make you feel smarter. Ice. We here at the Monday morning podcast and by we, I mean me in the voices in my head that agree with me. We hear it. The Monday morning podcast set the bar so low that even you,

Speaker 1:          00:10:32       you know with that college that you went to that advertised on television and you drove yourself there and they like living there was not even an option. They didn't have dorms. They just, you know, was your college one giant sad building looking like a high school for people in their twenties yeah. Yeah. That's who you are. And you know what, even you get to feel smart on this podcast. So my favorite thing is if you go back and you listen to

Speaker 4:          00:11:04       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:11:04       my podcasts on Monday when I thought I was so fucking write about the Obamas buying this $82 million house is somebody actually wrote into the podcast and it goes, you know, Bill, I love you. Put, why don't you do your homework? Obama just signed a $62 million book deal. Okay. And this is what fucking hilarious. He's telling me to do my homework. He didn't even do the homework to look up to double check. What the fuck? I said even safe if it was true. He just took it for granted that I said $82 million house and then he's like, he took that as truth and started looking up the guy's fucking book deal. So what did she do? Your fucking homework man. All right. For the 9000000th time. Okay. On this podcast, do not take anything I say seriously? Okay. You can disagree with their web and you can correct me and all that, but just don't get upset and don't be fucking surprised.

Speaker 4:          00:12:01       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:12:02       that I, I fucking don't read. And then might, my facts might be off.

Speaker 4:          00:12:08       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:08       By a good $72 million. Okay. You know that you guys sound like all you fucking political cuts out that bitch and happy. You sound like all these fucking fat actresses out here who are bitching about Hollywood acting as though they're surprised that so much of this fucking industry is based on how you look.

Speaker 4:          00:12:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:28       What was that really a shocker? Had you never been to a movie, you didn't notice a trend. Do you think it's just you? You know what I mean? And you fucking sloppy tits. Who's having a rough time? And I'm a fucking bald redhead and mail. I have no sympathy for you. Oh, he's knocking down their fucking door to put me in an action movie, you know?

Speaker 4:          00:12:54       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:54       I could be hell boy. Do a fucking cycle of steroids. I already have the head. You just fucking paint it red and you're ready to go. I could do a headstand and fucking my head would turn so red. You could save feeds the amount of money to save on makeup and time alone.

Speaker 4:          00:13:09       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:10       They'll do a fucking handstand. Okay. You're in this seat. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:13:18       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:19       Anyways.

Speaker 4:          00:13:20       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:20       So I guess the Obamas bought an eight point $1 million house, not an $82 million house, which then led me into this whole thing. Like he's on his, he's, this is his third book that he's written. It's like he was writing books while he was president and you supposed to be running the fucking country, fucking sitting there dealing with the Russians and all this terrorist groups and all that shit. And then you're like fucking at nighttime.

Speaker 4:          00:13:46       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:13:47       take out a little legal pad. It was the best of times. It was the worst of times. He's fucking assholes out right in the books. They always get like somebody else. It's like written by Bill Clinton and the other guy who actually wrote the book. Yeah. I want to run a thriller a lot about you and me. Right? It right. Like, Oh, you'll put your name and put my name on the cover and then you like write it.

Speaker 4:          00:14:08       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:09       What is that book about? You've got to write what you know. It's gotta be something about somebody fucking sneak around on his wife. Right. Sticking cigars and people. Oh, it's too on the nose. I wanted to be challenged. I wrote about a guy who was faithful. Um, sorry for the bad Bill Clinton. Uh, now you guys, Bill, why don't you do your homework? The book is actually bugs experiences, Oxford, Oxford in England, the home where it all started.

Speaker 4:          00:14:41       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:41       I take both of those games. I was working both days, so I have to go back and watch them and I gotta tell you, man, I am so fucking sold on that game though. I don't know what, I had so much fun making fun of soccer all these fucking years and it's uh, it's crazy. And then watching the highlights, uh, when a goal is scored, like my whole, my whole complaint about the sport is what makes the sport so great. The fact that scoring is so God damn difficult. The fucking, that the emotion that gets led off when these people score, I mean, Jesus Christ, like in my country, if you dump a beer on somebody's after some sort of point is scored, you're going to get into a fight over there. I mean, it looked like a fucking,

Speaker 1:          00:15:29       I don't know what it looked like. It looked like a, a sports bar combined with the money shot in a porno. Everybody's jumping up and down, just spray in booze all over the place. Pardon me? I think it kind of was a little annoying. Like why, why, why are you wasting all that good boots? You know, cause I'm a, I'm, I'm, I'm taking another month off. You know, me, I impose my own little fucking sabbaticals, you know what I mean? And after that, that my little excursion over there to Europe, oh my God, there's just I aisle that says sluts Onca 1664 that fucking beer tastes so god damn good in that Goddamn glass in that one cafe,

Speaker 1:          00:16:13       uh, over there in Europe, over there in France. Right then I refuse. I've, I've seen it over here and I've been tempted to buy it and it's like, I'm not going to fucking do it because this is what happens. Like when you go to Ireland and you drink Guinness over there and then he come back here and you want to continue it. It fucking sucks. And you know what else I did? You know, it's just unbelievably like, just on another level is Indian food in England. I went to this fucking place. The Indian food was so god good. I've been, I, I've ordered it twice sense that once in France it was okay. And then I ordered it here in La and it fucking sucked.

Speaker 4:          00:16:53       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:16:53       And I was like, I got to walk away. You know, it's like you go to Paris and he come home and be like, you know, I'm going to have a French breakfast. I'm going to get to Paul Saul. Right. And then you'd go down to the fucking supermarket and you get it. And it's like somebody pulled it out of this shoe, you know, it just all goes back to the winning wrong thing. Yes. Go on. Um, you know what I mean? That's the only thing that sucks about traveling.

Speaker 4:          00:17:18       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:18       You know what I mean? Like A, I'm, I think I'm going to do a Gig in buffalo coming up. I haven't been there in fucking forever. And what's going to happen is I'm going to go to Duffy's or that other fucking place where you know where they came up with buffalo wings and I'm going to eat them and they're going to be so God damn good. And then I'm going to come back out here. I'm going to have that fucking crack and my, my, my system going, well, I'm going to get, I gotta get some wings out here and when I eat them and they're going to suck. And then it's just depressing. You like the only place to get good wings. It's in Buffalo. It really is. I've never gone to any other place other than buffalo that really knows how to make good buffalo wings. That's it. Now I just lob that out there for all of you guys to lose your fucking shit

Speaker 5:          00:18:01       urge. You went, whoa. You, you're good.

Speaker 4:          00:18:07       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:18:07       Which you want to do is go to Cincinnati and go to fucking Mfi. Stay of the best ones.

Speaker 4:          00:18:14       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:18:15       I follow Joe Rogan on all social media and he posted this really fascinating thing that within 10 minutes I was like, I don't even know what the fuck this guy's talking about. He was talking something about fasting and how it's actually could be good for you. I mean, I've read, I mean, Dick Gregory wrote a whole bunch of books on this type of Shit, right? Rest his soul and a saying how, you know, let's see. Oregon's rejuvenate and all of that type of shit. And I thought it was really fascinating. Until about 10 minutes in, I realized I, I didn't understand what the guy was talking about and I looked at him and he was not in the best of shape. He looked a little mushy, you know, which I would think would happen if you fast it, you'd get a little fleshy cause your body would keep eating muscle. You know what I mean? I Dunno. But anyways, um, the fuck was my point. It's talking about food. Oh Jesus. I don't fucking know. I have no idea. Troubled in the Su is

Speaker 5:          00:19:10       JFK blown away.

Speaker 1:          00:19:13       Tips the table over like a fucking baby.

Speaker 4:          00:19:18       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:19:21       Why am I talking about that? Because I was watching TV late night and I watched all these, uh, old 80s

Speaker 4:          00:19:29       videos

Speaker 1:          00:19:32       and that song came on, you know, I'm telling you, my new show is 77 sunset strip with Efram Zimbalist jr who I was always a big fan of cause that FBI show and uh, end up in, you know, I've been made to, you know, I think yesterday was the first day I snapped while driving in a while and it felt weird and I immediately

Speaker 1:          00:19:55       dialed that back down and my move for all you other angry guys out there like me and you're not angry, you're not an angry guy. You just, that's your default emotion. Like, you know what I mean? I'd like to really be an angry guy. You just have to be like walking around seeding, which I don't, I walk around totally normal and then something happens and I fucking flip out, you know, and have a fucking meltdown and then it just takes people. It's just, it's so fucking over the top that everybody forgets what a great guy was for the previous four hours. That's essentially what it is. And it's like a fucking five minute meltdown, you know? It's like, what about the other four hours was a good guy? And it's just like, no bill. No what you did in that five minutes negated all that. It's like doing four hours of fucking cardio and then sitting down and eating a box of fucking Oreo cookies. It's just, it's, you just negated all of that.

Speaker 4:          00:20:47       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       Silver, you still a fat fuck emotionally. So anyways, I, I listened to baseball. I listen to the red sox on Sirius Xm and uh, actually watched. Then I came home and that's making me watch them again. Fucking Chris sales up, guide the beast. He watched the game last night when he walked that guy, he didn't think that he walked him and he got fucking mad. She started throwing like 98, 99 miles an hour on the corners. That crazy delivery. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:21:18       I dunno, we shall see that. I don't know who that bum was that they brought into the fucking eighth inning. Then almost gave me were up four to nothing and he's like, you know what? Let's make the gamblers nervous is a nice fatty hanging out over the plate. Bam, Bass head boom. Double four to one load 'em up and they finally got him out of there. Then our relief pitcher, I don't know anybody's name, that guy who comes out there, he hangs his arm like he's driving a shirt or some shit. He came out there and shut them the fuck down. Um, so I'm, I'm like a, I'm back into that shit and I'm actually going to be really sad when the World Cup's over. When is the finals that on Saturday, that's going to be crazy one match for all the fucking models. Can you imagine if that comes down to penalty kicks again? I used to think that was the stupidest fucking thing ever. Like a world bass, like a basketball championship coming down to foul shots, you know what I mean? That would just be like boring as shit. But now I get it. I get it because if you fuck it up,

Speaker 1:          00:22:25       I really feel like the goaltender has like no pressure cause all he has to do is just guess, you know, I love that they're guessing it's just a total guests. And when they guess, right, they guess, right. They stand up like, like there was some sort of intelligent thought there. It's just like left, right, left, right diving left. Fucky went right. Um, that always, it's always funny when they guess wrong when they're, they start to dive that way and they realize that guy went the other way and you just watched the goaltender, like his whole body goes limp. Like, ah, I should tell the other way. And he just fucking landed on the grass.

It was like three bucks and then it ran out of lighter fluid. They're so cheap. All those, like they're always going, hey man, we got souvenirs for $5. It's like, no, you need to be solidly souvenirs for 50 cents, if that. My favorite thing is when you go to New York and they have that, you know, that that foam rubber thing where you wear the crown from the fucking statue of Liberty. People walk around with that. Like I went to New York and I got this.

Speaker 1:          00:51:55       Can you imagine how many those are floating around the fucking ocean? Some poor fucking porpoises trying to swallow that thing. All right, we're out.

Speaker 6:          00:53:02       I imagine travel as much as some of us, some of us live in houses, some of the light,

Speaker 1:          00:53:36       you guys see that coming. I just saw a commercial for Kentucky Fried Chicken where the parents are all excited because the two bratty kids won't sit still at the dinner table, but they got them this fucking chicken and they're feeding it to and they're basically very suddenly saying that there's drugs in this chicken that will make you a spastic children. Chill the fuck out and spastic. I mean like, you know, not, not the way they mean it over there. And Great Britain. You can't say that on the comedy. So you can say it in a comedy club over in Scotland, but you'll have a rough, they'll have a rough go of it. If you say the kid was spastic over there, that means like severely mentally challenged over here. It just means you're not going to get laid to you 26

Speaker 1:          00:54:23       when you were in Grad school looking over a fucking cadaver, right, with some other fucking nerve narrowed. Right. And you're just sitting there going, you know the ankle bones connected to the knee bone, right. Has any of this made any sense? What shouldn't? It's fucking Sunday night and I am spent and I got a whole bunch of Shit I have to do tomorrow, so I got to do it tonight. All right, I'm off my game. All right, you, you cleanse your liver and like 42 43 days or something like that. Every drunk I knows has told me that if he drunk, I know that does not have a medical degree. Has told me that if you go 42 43 days, you will cleanse your liver at least to the booze. You know? Now if you fucking, you start doing blow or a, you know, eating a bunch of trans fat fucking food, a feeding your kids, Kentucky Fried fucking chicken, Jesus Christ.

Speaker 1:          00:55:15       What happened to parents and she got a drug, your kids to keep them under control, you know, you know what it is. Kids don't respect their parents, they respect them, but they don't respect like, oh my God, this, this person could wring my neck, could pick me up by my hair. Right. Could grab a paddle and fucking, you know, mostly hit my ass, but also kinda hit my lower back because I'm squirming right. That doesn't exist anymore. So now these kids is so fucking out of control. These people have to go down to Kentucky Fried Chicken. Okay. And I, I, I used the term chicken very loosely to go down in whatever that is that's in that bucket. Okay? It doesn't have a beak. It doesn't have feet. If it's fucking, you know, chest, his breasts to stick it out like the cast on fucking, uh, what was, what was that show with the Italians there on New Jersey Shore Jersey shore. Right. My world. That's not a fucking chicken. You know, you want the chicken that looked like Mark McGuire and his rookie season. You don't want to eat the chicken that looks like mark McGwire when he fucking played for the cardinals. You know?

Speaker 1:          00:56:37       Do you eat a regular fucking chicken? First of all, it's going to look like a pigeon tea because you so used to seeing those roid it up once that they have murderer's row that you got down there at your fucking Shaws, right? You Vaughn's you, JC pennys, wherever the fuck you buy your God damn check it. You go down, you go down to any one of the main stream fucking supermarkets. Okay. And I swear to God when you get to the chicken section, okay, if you've, if you've slept for the last 30 years, like that Van Gundy guy under the bridge, whatever his fucking name is, Van Morrison, the hell's his name, Rip Van Winkle. Right. It was one of those people, one of the vans. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:57:19       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:57:20       If you slept for the last 30 years and you went down, okay. And they showed you what a chicken wants, you'd be like, you'd be like, that ain't no chicken. Okay? It's a God damn Turkey. I know. Fuck Dyno

Speaker 2:          00:57:31       fucking Turkey. When I say what? I ain't no such thing as a math path. Fucking chicken can't be done. No Sir. No Sir. Get off my property. Okay. I'm, I'm done with your witchcraft. Okay. Hey, I said, get the fuck Outta here.

Speaker 4:          00:57:49       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:57:49       Fuck off my property.

Speaker 4:          00:57:52       MMM

Speaker 2:          00:57:56       honey, get the gun. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:58:01       yeah, you would think it was a fucking Turkey. And the thing is, is now it's a chicken. And I remember I watched one of those food banks, one of those fucking liberal Goddamn thinks, you know, talking about flying carpets and electric roads and all that bullshit. Somewhere in there they were talking about, you know, the food supply and I'll poison it is poisonous

Speaker 2:          00:58:17       poisoning. And it is, it is. Um, so I fucking went down to a farmer's fucking mark yet. And um, I said, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna all I want. I want to, I want it all

Speaker 1:          00:58:33       natural fucking chicken. I can't even talk. I'm so tired. One an all natural chicken.

Speaker 2:          00:58:39       The guy goes, these are all natural. And I said, all natural. And he goes, well, I'm like, come on, where is it? And he had to walk around the corner sitting over there, lonely. I swear to God, looking like a dove look like in somebody killed the fucking dump. Because right there, that one right there is 100% all natural. Nothing's wrong with it. And I was like, I was like, what? That's what a chicken is supposed to look like. And he raised his eyebrows and he, he kind of put his lips together so they were straight line. And then he nodded, you know, that looked at people do like,

Speaker 1:          00:59:18       like, yeah, I'm in the Matrix. I realize I'm in the Matrix, you know, I knocked the bitch up so I got to be selling these, wrote it up. Chickens. No. Um, anyways, anyway, what the fuck I'm talking about? So basically that's what these people are eating over there. Okay. They are, they are drug and up

Speaker 1:          00:59:39       the kids, but I can't get mad at him because I actually did that to Charlie Murphy and a Don l Rawlings. I've told this story before, Hey, I'll tell it against my fucking podcast. I actually drug I the exact thing that they're doing in that Kentucky Fried Chicken commercial with it, trying to get the kids to sit still by just feeding him so full of these fucking trans fats from these Roy up beatless fucking chickens with the Dolly Parton breast diseases. Right. I did that to fucking Donnelle and Charlie, I was hung over and we've taken a car service from Chicago xannies up to one of those whenever the fuck it was Saint Charles, it was a three city run

Speaker 1:          01:00:28       and one of them was Saint Charles. So we're getting in the fucking Limo, Don L's in rare form. Charlie's in rare form. They're fucking Gavin and trash and people and me and everybody and I just don't want to hear it. I'm like, I don't want to listen to these fucking guys running that Goddamn yaps in the back of this car the whole fucking way up. I want a nice quiet ride. This is going to suck. And I walked outside, hung over and I walked into the Chicago where, you know, almost got hit by three fat people. And, um, I looked up to street and I saw it, I saw a Popeye's and I was like, oh, thank God. And I fucking walked in there and I got all this fucking Popeye's chicken with biscuits and all of this shit food. And I brought it back to the car and as the car pulled up, they came out and I say, guys, I got to sell some.

Speaker 1:          01:01:20       I got some food. And they like, ah, it's fucking great. You know, they were hungry or whatever. And they started showering that fucking Popeye's food and I sat back, nibbling on a drum stick and I swear to God, 10 minutes later they were asleep. I'm not lying to you. They were fucking asleep, snoring the whole way up. And I was just sitting there loving life, the whole fucking write up. And I, you know what, I admitted to him later, they thought it was funny, but that's basic what it is. They called it the Itis, that's what they call it when you eat that shit food and then you have to go to sleep, they call it the Itis, I guess. And by they, I meet African Americans. Um, they call it the fucking Itus and that's what they got. And the F and I learned that from Don l because I don't know how that man stayed in shape, but he had the worst diet. He's one of those guys who like you stopped for gas and he comes out of the gas station with like one of those gas station hot dogs.

Speaker 1:          01:02:27       And he would eat it and then he would immediately fall asleep. And I, and I would say to Charlie, look at this guy, he's sleeping and chat and be like, yeah man, he got the itis me. Explain that to me and what that little bit of information, it went into my evil white brain and I drug my two African American friends way back in the year 2005. Um, and that's a little chicken story for you. What time did you like that? Everybody. So that's what the fuck they're saying right there. That's what Kentucky Fried Chicken is allegedly saying. I guess they have to say a legend. So their lawyers on retainer don't attack my fucking podcast as far as I can tell. I'm asking you right now, uh, Kentucky Fried Chicken hiding behind your fucking letters, KFC. Is that what the fuck you do? Is that what you're saying?

Speaker 1:          01:03:21       If you've got kids who are not stimulated enough that they can't even sit down, if you have a Reia of running around, you got to tie your kids out, opened the door. You send them out in the fucking yard. God, God side, get outside and play. That's what you do. Like a God damn one of those fucking Irish dogs. It was bread dip too to herd sheep. You've got to let that fucking thing run around. Run around in circles. Guy, get out there, take a ball. You just fucking throw it out and traffic. Let the dog run around. Dodgy cars. It comes in, it's going to lay down. Okay? It's not going to jump all over. Company stick and it's cold nose, right in their fucking who has. That's what you got to do with your kids. You've got to send them upside, right? But to catch a Predator and all these other fucking shows, you know, all these shows on TV where people forget that kids are in a car with the windows rolled up and the kids are too fucking dumb to roll them down or they're too weak because they haven't gone outside and climb to fucking tree and they stay in there and then their, their brains get cooked like a boxer, you know?

Speaker 4:          01:04:24       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:04:25       You know that dog boxes, they don't, they don't do well in the sun. Well, we'll need to do fat kids. If you leave the windows rolled up, you know, and they got those weak arms that all of that think the most tedious things they ever did was take a wrapper off of a fucking, uh, an ice cream sandwich. Right. You can't leave them in the car. My mother left us in the car all the fucking time. She would go to school. She was going to school during the day trying to further her education and she left five fucking kids in the car with the windows rolled up and money for Burger King. And she would say to us, just go into the Burger. That's the only time you were to leave this car overlay over the next three fucking hours when I'm in class. And she would disappear around the corner after we set. Absolutely. Mom and she walked away. Ed. Uh, we immediately would get out of the car, start walking up and down the streets in Boston.

Speaker 4:          01:05:19       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:05:19       We go into fucking burger king and we, we'd have some to eat. Do you know what would happen nowadays if they just saw five fucking dirty face kids walking up and down, calm AV Boylston street going into a burger king looking like the cast to fucking Annie.

Speaker 4:          01:05:34       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:05:35       Someone would have filmed it and my mother would have been in, they would have taken us away,

Speaker 4:          01:05:40       you know, but, but they didn't

Speaker 1:          01:05:42       cause there was no cameras back then or videotape ones. I mean there was, but only people add them on like the news.

Speaker 4:          01:05:49       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:05:49       And a young Steven Spielberg. So we went in there and we fucking got some food, climbed on cars and fucking yelled at people and Shit.

Speaker 1:          01:05:59       Ditto hanging on Platt parking meters. And all that. Hence, we had the fucking forearm strength to roll down the windows and none of us ever had an issue in the car. And you know what? I think that's one to grow on today. You go people, I'm not saying KFC is food. I'm not, I'm just kidding. I'm not saying it's bad food. Every once in a while who's kitten home? He wants to, we don't go anywhere. Be Great. If he could just fucking do heroin the way you can eat Mcdonald's, just like every once in a while he'd just be like, you know what? Yeah, let's just fucking tie off. Not off for the rest of the fucking day in like the people at work understood it.

Speaker 4:          01:06:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:06:38       You know? Hey, where were you yesterday on? Yeah, I got this black tar heroin came in. You know, I hadn't done it like three months away. Figured fuck it. Oh, is that what you did? How was it? How was it? You know, like you're like you went to Aruba, you said, oh, I've towed. It was awesome.

Speaker 6:          01:06:52       I don't remember shit. You know, he'd get a dick. That's fine.

Speaker 1:          01:08:08       Hey, what's going on? It's Belper and it is the Monday morning podcast for Monday, July 12th, 2010

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       all la. I'm sorry. I was really going to act like I could speak Spanish there. Oh, allow yo soy comical and anemia. Maybe Litchi ornaments. Santa's bent alone is Una COMESA. I actually, if you can't tell, I've actually finally broken open my Rosetta stone that I got for Christmas two and a half fucking years ago or whatever it is. Yeah, I got it for a year and a half ago. December of 2008 I got a the Rosetta stone. Oh God. Okay. Black or Negro Roho um, I, I got it, dude. It's the shit. It's a shit. I'm going to be fluent in Spanish. I've always wanted to learn another language and I ain't trying to immerse myself. That's what I'm trying to do. I'm trying to immerse myself in the language. I'm listening to it on the radio. I'm also listening to it. Uh, you know, I'm listening to shit like this on a, on my iTunes, hoping I can pick up some shit. You know you got to, you got to immerse yourself in the shit. You got to listen to stuff like this.

Speaker 2:          01:09:44       A fucking great. Is that got to have a fucking be able to fucking know what that means. Sing that have pigment in my chest so I can actually wear that open. I'm going to go stab a bull Latino shirt. How much pussy would you get if he could fucking, it's just unbelievable. It's half the shit that they say. It sounds like fucking dirty talk when you're banging a girl in a neat pivot. Litchi that means the girl is drinking them is drinking milk. There's no way to say that without just sounding like you're fucking, it'll Ninette a bib and itchy. Hey, next time you guys are banging your girl. Okay, you got a Doggie style. Just leaned down in her ear and just feel like, ah, maybe I need your vivid, itchy.

Speaker 2:          01:10:35       Should we even have an orgasm or a fucking world around an elbow when you win you in the face? Either way. Either way, it's going to be funny, but I want to be fluent in that shit. And uh, I'm liking Rosetta stone. I really like it. You sit there and you put on like a, a bill, Bellamy, Janet Jackson Sorta headset, you know, and uh, okay. You put on some stretchy pants and then you put, you put in the fucking CD Rom or whatever the hell it is. And then they just, they just start speaking to you like you're a baby sitting in the crib. That's exactly what it is. Two very stereotypical Mexican looking faces just sort of peer into the screen, like you're laying in the crib and then they just start speaking to you and they tickle your tummy. It's, it's tremendous. It's a tremendous, it's a tremendous way to numb.

Speaker 2:          01:11:27       I'm just fucking around dude. It's awesome. It's a, if you were ever thinking about doing it, like, you know, I always wanted to learn to speak a different language. Whenever I ride the subway, I was nervous that Puerto Rican were actually calling me bad words. What does [inaudible] mean? Um, is that even Puerto Rican? This is what's killing me. This is how fucking what I am. I actually believe that I'm going to learn this shit. El Nina Bibby Litchi I'm going to learn this shit and uh, therefore I will be able to go to Mexico, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Brazil or whatever, and be able to understand every motherfucker out there, even though people I know this dude who is Cuban and he tells me it's, it's really different. Not totally different, but I mean, I dunno, he seemed a little peeved when I was like, yeah, and I can go to fucking Cuba. I can go to Dominican Republic. It's not the fucking same thing. All right, sorry. You know when it's one of those things, I'm not even trying to be offensive and I offended you, but it's like, you know, do you think when I go to Ireland or I went to, went to Scotland, I can understand those fuckers, everything that they said, but I knew what they were saying.

Speaker 2:          01:12:38       Am I being ignorant right here? Do you guys, is it a complete, it's not a completely different language. Ah, they'll, Nina baby Lecce you can't say that. And fucking Cuba and they won't know what you're talking about. Is that because it calmed me communism? You know, I already stopped this podcast and started it again because I'm doing this Sunday morning. My fucking brain isn't awake yet. Stuttering like a goddamn jackass. Uh, pantaloneys spot dose will not come Isa. I can't fucking wait. I can't wait the first time somebody from uh, I was going to say somebody from another language. That's how dumb I am. Somebody speaking Spanish talk shit about me because I'll tell you right now, I would fucking do it all the time. I would do it all the God damn time. If English was a second language was not the main language of this country.

Speaker 2:          01:13:35       And I had another English speaking French I and, and I was walking around people who did not understand English and it would be our own little private language. I would be shitting on people, right and left perverted stuff. Can you imagine that? If nobody understood English, everybody just spoke Spanish, right? Your boss, some can't. But she's got a nice rack and you sit in there and she can literally walk by and like, dude, I would tit, fuck this bitch right on a God damn desk and then turn around me all La, me boss. Ah, you know, no wonder they're so fucking laid back. They can get it out. I got to sit, I got to sit on all this goddamn rage because I don't have some secret fucking language. All right. All right. Mexicans. I mean you fucking hide out and I'm breaking down your code. So I'm telling you this time next year, you better watch your tongue. Okay, good.

Speaker 2:          01:14:30       Only I could turn learning in another language seat. See you hear me stuttering. It's in the morning. Only I could turn speaking another language. Am I only, I could turn a love of language, relax Mexico. Just relax. Just really listened to a couple of my podcasts and realize how fucking stupid I am and also how I get totally psycho into something for about 10 days. And then I just walk away from it and then it just sits there gathering dust on my desk. Anyways, so it was a big week this weekend in sports. It's actually, uh, what time is it? Right now it's 10 43 and this is the funny thing. In 17 minutes, the World Cup final is starting, which is basically the championship, one of the true championships of the world. It's the entire world competes for it. And as big a fucking sports fan as I am, I could give a shit.

Speaker 2:          01:15:32       The only thing that I would find less interesting than the World Cup final was the Lebron James Hour long press conference to announce what team he's going to fucking go to. You know? That's actually bullshit. I totally respect the game of soccer. It just, it fucking bores the shit out of me. And A, we have a number of soccer fans on here and they send me emails and they get mad at me. They say, it says, Dear Bill Dude, until you have a better understanding of the game, you got to stop ragging on soccer. Find someone that knows a little bit about the game and take some fucking time and watch a couple of games. Dude watch the World Cup finals. Uh, exclamation point. Why? Cause you fucking say so. Um, do you realize that if you added up everyone that watched the NFL, the NBA, the Nhl and MLB, you would only have about half as many people that watch soccer.

Speaker 2:          01:16:26       Dude, do you realize that? I'm not so fucking stupid that I don't realize that you just pulled that stat out of your ass. Give me some numbers you didn't. You said you would have about path is made about really? Yeah. You're going to guesstimate there. Put that in your pipe and smoke it bill. Thanks dude. All right. This is the deal. All right. I'm so sick of these fucking soccer cons. Trying to convince me that it's an, an exciting sport. Do you think that I haven't sat down and watched it earlier this year when I watched the Olympics, I got into curling. I was watching the cross country skiing. Will you shoot the gun? I'm very open minded when it comes to sports. Okay. But to sit there and killed two, three fucking hours of my day to watch a zero to zero fucking game. And watching these guys flop around like a bunch of Goddamn Pau Gasol every 10 fucking minutes.

Speaker 2:          01:17:21       It's, it's, I tried, dude, I tried it just because the whole fucking world is watching the sport. Does it mean that I should? All right. The whole world was where an acid wash jeans and the life fucking eighties I followed that trend and I got the embarrassing God damn pictures to prove it. Where the fuck did that get me? You know what I like about soccer? I like the highlights, the highlights, you know, and they show it in slow motion motion. Absolutely gorgeous sport to watch. But to sit there for fucking two hours listening to those, God damn mosquito horns, you, you're really asking too much.

Speaker 2:          01:17:59       All right, everybody flopping around like a bunch of God damn fucking girls. Get off the goddamn ground. Fucking pussies. The guy doesn't even touch you and you flop around on the ground. It's so a feminine. That's what I can't stand about that sport. You know, this guy did bring up a good point. He goes, you're telling me the basketball players. Yes, basketball players do. Basketball is a very fucking a feminine sport when it comes to that shit, that fake fucking flopping around. Yeah, no other, you know, that's the closest thing. I'm trying to think. There's a couple of guys in the NHL, look, there's always going to be a couple of broads in every sport, you know, but at least in, in, in the NHL soccer fan, you know what they have, they have a penalty for pretending that somebody hit you two minutes. You get, it's called diving. Two minutes for diving, get up you fag and getting a goddamn penalty box.

Speaker 2:          01:18:55       I was, I dunno, I, I, dude, I tried. I fucking tried. I tried to watch the shit. I don't give a fuck. Um, I find the Premiere League way more enjoyable to watch. I can watch that game, but I got to tell you like, I don't know what it is. I start to get a headache and I get a little bit of a stomach ache when I'm watching it because the amount of effort that I have to put in to you know, do, to sit there and in two hours of your fucking life to watch a one to nothing game. That's why, you know, so I think I finally figured out why they fight in Nhl Hockey. Cause you can actually have a one to nothing fucking games. So you know, then you basically have guys going, it's legal to smash somebody's, you know, against the boards. You can drop the gloves, he could fight. There's a lot of other exciting things that do happen. All right? But to sit there for two fucking hours.

Speaker 2:          01:19:52       Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Ooh. Oh it's the sports equivalent to fucking blue balls. I don't fucking it. I really don't. I just don't. I don't like it. I don't fucking like it. Okay. And you can't make me fucking like it because the whole world likes it. All right. There's, this is a major part of the fucking world. Did you know they, they take out a high grade piece of sandpaper and then they, they, they rubbed the girl's fucking clicks off. Does it doesn't mean that I think it's right. Wow. That was really disgusting. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 12 minutes into the podcast, getting that fucking gross. I should have saved that towards the end for the diehard fans. Um, so anyways, dad, that Lebron James Announcement, um, speaking of mind numbingly boring. Um, oh, this is not, think about fucking soccer.

Speaker 2:          01:20:49       Like I'm invited to this, this, this party where they're going to watch the finals and whenever you find a person who's really into soccer, you know, yeah, they always get like their little soccer shirt on. They always have like these little fucking wimpy torsos. If you notice that it was the last time you saw somebody jacked that was into fucking soccer, you don't always have like those little fucking, those little European torsos, you know, you little seventh grade bodies. It does anybody lift weights or do pushups or anything in fucking Europe? Do you just, you just take the torso God gave you and then you just start stuffing fish and chips down your fucking throat and you just let it all sort of slide down until you look like Jethro Tull. Um, all right. I think I've tried that shit enough. Let's trash in American sports. Let's talk about fucking Lebron James and his fucking, first of all, his howdy doody puppets shirt that he wore. You know, there really is this theory out there that black guys are so cool that they really can wear any type of clothing and make it look good. Well, that was an example of when it doesn't quite always work. I mean, that was a, I don't know what that was, that it looked like he was going to go sing on the Grand Ole Opry in like 1948.

Speaker 2:          01:22:09       Um, all right, the fuck am I talking about? Let's get into this whole podcast thing. All right. Uh, the Lebron James one hour announcement for everybody out there who's saying how fucking lame it was, um, you know who's fault that is? It's your own God damn fault. It's your own fucking fault for sitting there and watching it. Okay. It's not like ESPN lied. They told you what it was going to be. This is going to be a one hour special of an athlete announcing which team he's going to go fucking play for. I mean, how long should that realistically take? It's like the fucking Oscars. How long should it take to be and to, to take to just fucking be like, and the Oscar goes to Sean Connery and the Oscar for the best fucking dress in a period piece goes to Claire. Big Billingsley bill billings leak clear Billingsley fucking Douche bag bill burn.

Speaker 2:          01:23:08       Not even fucking awake trying to do a podcast to get it out of the Goddamn way to go to some stupid ass fucking party that's showing the finals of a sport that he doesn't give a fuck about. That starts in nine minutes. Oh my God. Somebody hit fucking record. Um, yeah. I mean, you know what the fuck it was going to be. Why did you even watch it? I mean, can't you tell that that guy, that guy just got some fucking horrific and he just got horrific advice from his people around him who they were just like, we're going to create the biggest media stir ever. All right, we'll go to Chicago first. We'll gain some interest. We'll go to the Knicks, we'll get some interest there. We'll go down and fuck man. Oh, where the fuck is he going to? Who gives a shit?

Speaker 2:          01:23:53       Nobody cares except the people in those fucking touts. I got to tell you, I really did enjoy him. Fucking, you know, terror in the hearts on a Knicks fans because as always, New York fans are the most fucking dislike a, that's the sense of entitlement that fans of New York sports have just because they live in New York City. If I have to watch one more fucking asshole on TV, talk about the big stage in New York. Okay. Overrated. Underrated for this week. Overrated. The big stage in New York, there's only one big stage in New York. It's in fucking Yankee stadium. That's the only big stage that is in New York. 27 championships. You go there, there is pressure to win. What does his big like when Lebron didn't pick fucking New York? I'm on, you know I'm online and I read three comments and I'm like, there you go. That's enough evidence for me. I'm going to judge every new fan in New York right now. They were all sitting there going like, oh, he was afraid of the, the, the bright lights. He couldn't handle the big stage of New York. Let me ask you this, Nick fans, where is the big fucking stage for professional basketball in New York City?

Speaker 2:          01:25:14       Madison Square Garden, that place, the biggest thing that happens in Madison Square Garden every year is Elton John comes there and sell. He fucking sells out 20 shows. You know Bruce Springsteen comes there and sings his songs about New Jersey. The circus comes once a fucking year. Those are the biggest days every year. And Madison Square Garden. All right, and in case you don't know what I'm talking about, next time you go there and there's yet another horrific played but made by either the fucking rangers or the Knicks and you look up and discussed to that, to the sports gods, like what the fuck? When you're done praying for some messiah to come in there and save those two pathetic fucking franchises, look up at the ceiling and tell me what you see. A striking lack of championship fucking banners. I'll even give you the God damn answers. You'd dumb fucks. There is no big stage and it's so fucking disrespectful of everybody to say that all the fucking time. Talking about Amy, you know when they talk about the biggest stage in, in, in major major league baseball team. What did they say? Fenway Park. How about Saint Louis? Say they got, they got 10 fucking world series titles.

Speaker 2:          01:26:39       That's not even a good example. It's not like the Knicks are in second place with titles. Dude, Yankee stadium is the big stage and made major league baseball. Okay? The fucking Celtics have 17 NBA championships that we're all one in Boston. All right. The Los Angeles Lakers, 11 titles have been one there a once a year they hold hands with somebody from Minnesota and they add the five that we're in. That's, that's the thing right there. The Minneapolis Lakers have more titles than the fucking New York Knicks. Do you guys understand that? That a team that's dead, dead fucking moved west. All right. That moved fucking West around the same time the Brooklyn Dodgers went out to la still has three more fucking titles than you do. You don't have a big stage there and nobody is afraid to play in New York City and there's certainly not afraid to play the fucking Knicks, so get off your own dicks.

Speaker 2:          01:27:39       I'm sick of it. All right. The jets having wanted since 69 the Knicks haven't worn it since 73 the mets haven't won it since fucking 86 who else has left? The giants are, are a respectable franchise. That's the best you have. You have a respectable franchise that is one the same amount of super bowls as the Patriots, the packers, the Redskins, and the Raiders. The giants are in the middle of the pack. All right? There's no big fucking stage. And they sit there and they act like these sports writers in New York, these fat mantated jackasses, these fill mushed nics are going intimidate a guy at the level of fucking Lebron James. They're not. I hate to tell it to you in New York. The reason why he didn't go to Madison Square Garden is cause you suck. That's why, I mean think about that. Who the fuck wouldn't want to go play in New York? You know New York is the city is the Paris of fucking of America. It's the best fucking city we have. All right, but just because there's a bunch of people outside of Madison Square Garden succeeding and doing some shit, most of whom aren't even from New York by the way.

Speaker 2:          01:28:57       That's another thing. New Yorkers think they're the shit just because live there just

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       because they're standing on the corner of fucking 52nd and third eaten a slice.

Speaker 2:          01:29:07       You know, if I can get there, I'll make an ad anywhere.

Speaker 1:          01:29:11       Are you really making it with your dirty fucking sneakers standing there outside of Tad's steaks. You're not doing shit. None of you are all you fucking pieces of Shit fucking gathering outside of fucking port authority.

Speaker 2:          01:29:26       That's another thing. Oh Man, I'm trashing the York this week. I don't give a fuck. Listen me, I don't give a fuck who bill. Really? You're being dangerous. It's dangerous to make yeah, alone. Bray and a danger resold. Um, do Frank Sinatra's from New Jersey. Okay. He was bridge and tunnel. The kindness, the kind of guy that Paris Hilton wouldn't have fucked in one of her whore nightclubs down there in the meat packing district. If he came in and said, oh, I live in Hoboken, she would have turned a little pointy nose up to the ceiling and walked away or in a big fucking Sasquatch feet that she tries to hide. Bye Jack. And a God damn fucking ass in the air to eye level. No girls would have banged that guy. But what did he do? He came in there, he came in there and he fucking sang a song and he took over your fucking city.

Speaker 2:          01:30:21       The way a bunch of people from other states that you fucking New Yorkers looked down on. We come in there all the time. We come in there and we blow away half to fuck a talent in New York because you guys are standing there eating a slice of pizza, looking at the fucking empire state building going, oh, it's open all night. You're not doing shit. You don't have a big stage. You have a sorry ass fucking NBA team. You know this. How dumb the fucking nics are. Isaiah Thomas, there was a league called the CBA that did find for like 30 fucking years. And then what's his face? Isaiah Thomas. Thomas became president of the league and in life, three, four years. I don't have the fucking stats. I Dunno. Five years it went out of business. Okay. I'm not talking about, you know, a winning franchise went to a losing franchise.

Speaker 2:          01:31:17       I'm not talking about a franchise that existed in a city, had to move. I'm not even saying the franchise folded. I'm talking about an entire fucking league. He got it to controls. He pushed the yolk forward and just flew the shit right into the goddamn ground. All right? And like bugs bunny. He stepped out right before it hit the ground before any of it got on him. And then the next go. Yet that's our guy. That's the guy we're going to get to run the fucking NBA franchise. The guy who fucking flew bootleg NBA, the Goddamn ground. That's the fucking dude. See, that's why Lebron didn't come. Not because he's afraid of the big stage. You want to know who's afraid of the big stage? Jeff Weaver. Jeff Weaver was afraid of the big stage. Okay? But Lebron James is not afraid of the big at the big stage. Okay? He could fucking put his nuts on Jeff weavers chest and hold them down in the deep end of a fucking pool. All right? He's not afraid of fucking Madison Square Garden.

Speaker 1:          01:32:26       And I also thought it was really fucking ironic

Speaker 2:          01:32:29       that of the three emails that I read by New Yorkers, which I'm now judging all of them, they were going like, you know, Miami. That's Dwayne Wade's town. If he goes down there and wins a championship there, nobody's going to respect him.

Speaker 1:          01:32:42       Can you fucking believe a New Yorker had the balls to say that with the fucking pile on team that the Yankees have been for the last 12 fucking years? Every God damn free agent on the fucking planet just clinging to Derek Jeters leg. Show me how to do it. I want to win one too. Huh? Roger Clemens, that fed buffalo wing. Eaton Jackass. Was it hard up in Toronto? Roger. Then he fucking comes down there and jumps in the fucking Limo. The fucking balls of these New York fans to sit there and question somebody's piling on another team to go in a fucking championship. I, I can't even take it.

Speaker 1:          01:33:26       I think I got to drink some throat coat tea that I mentioned that on this podcast cause I already deleted the other one when I was annoyed with how fucking unfunny I was. I'm great. I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that the ratings for this in New York City are going to be kind of low this week. I got to throw Coty, which is great. If you stand on stage and you don't know how to write a joke and you have to scream at jokes, or even if you'd like to call your girlfriend account at the top of your lungs, you know you have a do that and then the next day you want to do it again, but you throw these two tore up. You can't do it well, get organic throat coat tea, everybody. You could call your girl a cunt seven days a week, 365 days a year. That'd be a great commercial, right? Just have the girl crying in the background, sitting down in the fetal position as you're fucking sitting in the field. Fetal position bill curled up in the fetal position bill, he had dumped, fuck, all right, let's see. What did I do so far in this podcast? I pissed off anyone who isn't from America or I guess you know, Americans who are also into soccer. And then I trashed a, a giant media market.

Speaker 1:          01:34:35       See right there, Bill. That's why New York is such the big stage because it's one of the biggest media markets in all of the fucking cook for you. How pathetic are you fucking teams that you got to bring up the level of media in your city, the level of media gimme a fucking break.

Speaker 2:          01:34:57       Two Championship banners, 1970 fucking three. Do you know in 1973, the Chevy Vega was considered a sports car. And if you go on the game show network, people lose their fucking minds about that car, you know, and you can win. And then they opened the kernel, bright little Chevy Vega and these people with their fucking big Greg, Greg Bay, Brady fucking belt buckles, and they're fucking, uh, who's that dude from? Knocked up, observe and report the Seth Rogen fucking Afros go absolutely fucking ape shit over a Chevy Vega. That's when you guys want it. Last. People from are dying of old fucking age on that team. Who did you have an idea? Who are the fucking, the Nix, the greats.

Speaker 2:          01:35:58       Who Do you got? Bill Bradley. Daddy became a senator and then he fucking died. This is what it is. You want to get down to brass tacks here? What's really bugging me is, uh, in Boston we only have four sports teams. Okay? We're playing a fucking, you know, we got one, one bullet in the chamber and those cunts down there in New York, they're doubled down in two out of the four fucking sports every year. This split and fucking aces in two different sports. So they pad their stats with championships. But I respect the Yankees. The Yankees are the greatest franchise in an an all for sports. They got the fucking championships. You have to respect it. They got them. And I would never ever try to act like somebody was afraid to play in Boston because of the media or whatever the fuck that you know or call it the big stage in Boston.

Speaker 2:          01:37:01       All right. I would never do that out of respect for the fucking Yankees. The fact that they have 20 more fucking championships than we do. Okay, so give me the fucking respect that I deserve as a Boston Celtics Fan, that we have 15 more fucking NBA championships than you do fucking idiots. The big stage. I'm so sick of these fat mantated shitheads with their fucking game worn jerseys and they yell shit at players on the field and they think that they're intimidating them. You know like the fact that you got a d up Koby Bryant that you know that night isn't enough to make you nervous? No, it's the fat fuck with the shaved head and fucking row 58 g who Stew's Chanten airball air. They don't care. Then even fucking hear it. They don't even hear it. Lebron James is not afraid to go to New York.

Speaker 2:          01:37:58       He wanted to win. All right? That's why the fuck he went to Miami. But uh, you know, and I would really love it and this is the deal if, if the fucking Lakers didn't exist, um, with this stupid tee shirts claiming that the Los Angeles Lakers have fucking 16, because that's what the t shirt says. It says Los Angeles Lakers 16 championships, not Los Angeles Slash Minneapolis Lakers. Um, so now I have to become a Miami heat fan. I really do. But just for the record, dude, I don't like any of this shit. I didn't like the 2008 Boston Celtics. I didn't like that either. Where you just go out and, and just everybody piles on one team. I don't fucking like it. I don't like this age of the super teams. It's a, yeah. And I don't even, that's not, I don't know what it is anymore. It's like, it's like, uh, it's sports of becoming like what Ruth retail stores have become.

Speaker 2:          01:38:54       They're all like these superstores now. There's not like just the regular hardware store. That example, I use every podcast. It's always a hardware store with me, but fucking one trick pony. It's all fucking, it's all Walmarts now. Home depots best buys, all of that type of shit. And uh, I dunno, it's not the same kind of pride like that that you had back in the day when you watched red Arrow back get some unknown center from Golden State. You know Robert Parish, who the fuck knew who he was before he came to the Celtics and he goes after Kevin Mchale was in a highly touted draft pick and then Larry Bird, he works on for like three fucking years and gets them to come to the Celtics like that with some interesting shit. But nowadays when you got shit like Kevin Mchale, a former Celtic is working for the grizzlies and he gives the fucking Celtics Kevin Garnett for nothing, for nothing.

Speaker 2:          01:39:57       Decimates an entire fucking franchise. The same way Jerry West is fucking working for Memphis and gives the fucking Lakers Pau Gasol for nothing. I mean, it's a, I don't know, I don't fucking know. And the fact that these fucking knick fans are sitting there talking about that guy piling on as the god Damn Yankees are Erin negotiations to try to get cliff Lee. Like they don't have enough with fucking Subathra Aja Burnett, Marianna Rivera, fucking Alex Rodriguez, Al fucking to share all those guys. I love all the names of fading away cause I don't even watch baseball anymore. It's such a fucking stupid God damn sport. Um, do it. If the Yankees got cliff Lee, you might as well just mail them the trophy, you know, and um, this is what it is. I Dunno if I'm just this crabby old man. I'm really trying to find the art in, uh, signing all these free agents because it just seems to me like whoever has the most fucking money will eventually get most of the best guys.

Speaker 2:          01:41:04       You know, occasionally you'll lose out on a guy, occasionally a cliff Lee, we'll go to the rangers, you know, or somebody will pick the fucking angels or maybe they'll go to the fucking red sox or something like that. But generally speaking, you start with the fucking Yankees and then it just goes down. I Dunno, I just doesn't seem like there's any fucking skill that I had just been of a five. You know what it is. I'm on my fucking period this week, half hour a rag and about that shit. Let's get to, uh, let's see. Let's just totally fucking, uh, make a left turn here. And, uh, somebody asked me some for some advice this week. All right, here we go. This is, this is now, this is a quote. This is a situation that I think a lot of people that all embrace can deal with. Um, let's see here.

Speaker 2:          01:41:54       Uh, hey bill, huge fan. Love you. Comedy a with the hope this won't get too long. Um, it starts with one of my good friends going out with this girl. Uh, they went out for about a, uh, right off the bat, you know, he can't, can't you tell where this is going? This story starts with one of my good friends going out with this girl. They went out for about a year or two on honor, on and off. Come on bill. Focus here. Just try to read this smoothly. All right, let's start over and it starts with one of my good friends going out with this girl. They went out for about a year or two on and off. I'm still though, even when they were together, they were never really good in quotes.

Speaker 2:          01:42:38       Here we go. They fought basically all the time and just didn't seem right for each other though. Gee, you know where this is going during the early stages of their relationship. My friend thought I had a thing for her. Ogz She's a, she is a good looking girl. She is a good looking girl and I was friends with her before they even got together. Dude, you are so justifying what the fuck you either did or about ready to do. I love it. They weren't really good for each other. Even when they were together, they just, there was something missing. I actually knew her before he did. Um, here we go. She is a good looking girl and I was friends with there before they were even together. I admit I might have inadvertently been a little flirty with her sometimes.

Speaker 2:          01:43:32       Oh, I'm sorry it was I just flirting there. There you have a future at uh, at BP the next time they pollute an entire Gulf of a nation that they're not even citizens of and they need to bring somebody out to stand behind the podium through. This is fucking great. I might have inadvertently been a little flirty with her. How the fuck do you even do that? How do you inadvertently flirt with somebody? Wow. You really look beautiful in that dress. I'll tell you if you were my girlfriend, I have ever Devin. I mean, wait, what the fuck do you go with? Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That's right. You're now my girlfriend. I'm sorry. I thought you were my girlfriend for a second. What was I thinking? Jesus Christ. I'm so embarrassed and my face turning red. Oh my God. I was just inadvertently flirting with you.

Speaker 2:          01:44:15       Right then. Uh, Jesus. Uh, here we go. But any, he goes, this is what he says. I might have inadvertently been a little flirty with her sometimes, but that shit always happens with a guy and a girl. I think, dude, the level of guilt just weighing you down as you're trying to justify all of this. Uh, either way I told him, um, I didn't like her, which was true dude, stop lying to yourself. Anyways, it passed. However, I always got this feeling that there was a, there was still an undertone that he resented me since then. Yeah. Probably because of all the inadvertent flirting and the fact that you were emoting that they weren't right for each other. Um, but anyways, let's, let's, let's fast forward as he says, fast forward now. They've been broken up for at least a year and don't talk. She says, uh, he randomly texted her, Texas, her text her, Jesus Christ, I can't even fucking read.

Speaker 2:          01:45:16       She says he randomly texted her, but uh, that she doesn't ever answer him. But regardless of that, now this girl likes me. What? Oh my God, I didn't see that coming. Wait a minute. Anyways, but she actually likes me and basically says she wants to fuck my voice, just cracked in the perfect says she wants to fuck. Am I getting excited? I need some more throat coat here and basically says she wants to fuck. Um, she tells me stuff like she wishes she went out with me instead of him to begin with. Now I do all right with girls, but I don't have them lining up or anything. So I'm not trying to let a virtual shirt thing pass me by. Oh my God. And this is when it's getting Jerry Springer here. Uh, with most guys I don't, I, I'd feel like they'd not care if I went for it or at least understand why I did.

Speaker 2:          01:46:20       Did you realize what you're saying? I think most guys wouldn't care if their best friend went out and bang their fucking ex-girlfriend within a year of them going out. I think that they'd understand. So anyways, he goes, so I think most guys want to stand, but this buddy of mine is a little nuts and it's also a situation where he's the type of guy that if he were in my position, he do the same thing. Ah Dude, you just justifying. You don't even need my advice, you're going to do it. Um, my other friend who knows the whole situation says I should, but others I've talked to about it. Say I shouldn't. Uh, the last I talked to her, she said she wanted to hang out just me and her and then I should let her know when I want to. Uh, all right. I guess this thing's getting kind of long.

Speaker 2:          01:47:13       I have one question. Do I have any justification and fucking this girl and two, if I do, would you say I should go through with it? Okay. All right, sir. There there's just this just a ton of shit going on here. Okay. Right off the bat, you have to be honest with yourself. All right? You weren't inadvertently f a flirting with this girl. You actually probably, uh, like this girl before this guy even got with her, or maybe the fact that the guy, your friend got worth there and he was banging her, made you all of a sudden interested in her. See, I don't know, you as a person, you could be a very sadistic, a human being. Actually, I'm going to go on a limb and say you're not, because the fact that you actually give a fuck enough to write me and ask whether you should do this, that means you actually have some sort of guilt about it.

Speaker 2:          01:48:09       Um, so you won't get off on banging your fucking, uh, best friend's ex girlfriend, uh, through this. A lot of shit here that could blow up in your face. Okay? In a perfect world. All right. You're a man and you say, you know what, uh, that's not going to be worth the, the, the blowback. It's not going to be worth the fucking damage that I'm going to do. This guy's my best friend. I, even though he would do it to me, I'm not going to do it to him. And then I also need to stop being friends with this guy because anybody who would go out and fuck my ex girlfriend within a year is not truly a friend. I need to get better friends. But despite all that, I'm still not going to do what the fuck he would have done just because he would have done it to me.

Speaker 2:          01:48:58       And you just walk away from the situation and you go out and you chat up some other fucking broads. That's, that is like, if you want to be knighted someday, buy one of those fucking broads over there and a in the castle in England, you know, if you want to go over there with Surf Surf Phil Collins looking on and get knighted, that's what the fuck you do. But if you're going to bang this broad, um, you've already fucked up. Okay. Fucking your best friend's ex girlfriend. It's like committing a murder you want is few people involved is humanly possible. I learned that on an episode of uninformed when we had a cop come in and me and my, uh, cohost Joe to Rosa were saying that, um, you know, we were trying to come up with how to commit the perfect murder. And I remember said, okay, I'd get me and a buddy of mine, he goes right there, you fucked up right there.

Speaker 2:          01:49:59       You fucked up. He goes, the more people you bring in, the bigger chance you have of getting caught, you know, cause you're not going to rat yourself out. But the other guy, if he gets scared, might go down to the police station and try to cop a plea. All right? That's the same shit with this. If you're going to fuck your best friend's girl, ex-girlfriend, you don't go around and ask other friends going, dude, should I do with you? Don't. And you already did. All right. And then the other side of it is, um, I don't know how the two of these people broke up, but uh, you know, Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. And for all, you know, this chick might be a fucking psycho. All right. I mean, I think it's a good thing that he's texting her and not the other way around and that she is not texting him back. Granted, you're taking her word for it, that that's what the situation is now. For all you know, it's the reverse and if it is the reverse, she wants some sort of vengeance, which means she goes out and bangs his best friend and then Lo and behold feels guilty the next day and then has to tell him, all right, just to let you know that is on the fucking table.

Speaker 2:          01:51:25       If you really want to know whether or not you want a jerk, if you want to jerk, if you want to fucking, I got ahead of myself here. If you want to fuck this girl and not just go jerk off to her and after you'd done, if you still want a Banger, you want a banger and then just fucking man up and deal with the fucking consequences of it and go out and bang her because who gives a fuck as someday you're going to be 80 and who gives a shit, you know? Or on the other side, if you actually have feelings for this girl, that's a whole, then you should definitely do it. If you actually feel like this girl could be the girl that you're going to spend your life with, then I would definitely say go for it. Knowing full well that your friendship with this other guy is, uh, is going to end. Um, I dunno. So dude it, you know what, it's, it's fucking on you.

Speaker 2:          01:52:15       You know, if you asked me what I do at a, yeah, I would have, back in the day I would have, but now that I'm an older, wiser man, I wouldn't, I would just fucking rub one out to her and then be afterwards going, oh, thank God I didn't fucking do that. Thank God I didn't do that. And I was, I would also fucking not hang out with the other guy because any guy friend of mine that would fuck an ex girlfriend of mine within a fucking year, I wouldn't want to be friends with, even though I just described all of my friends do it. I don't know what to tell. I don't know what to tell you.

Speaker 2:          01:52:50       You probably shouldn't do what you should. You shouldn't do. Just shut. And you should go out and go fucking bank somebody else. You shouldn't. All right. But I feel like a hypocrite because I would, I would. But then again, I'm also a fucking 42 year old guy. Oh, never got married. So when, so you're listening to a complete fucking scumbag here. So Jesus Christ, this is why I don't have a fucking advice show, you know, because in my attempt to be honest, I, I, I, I tell you both things, do it. Don't do it. I would, but you shouldn't have a nice day.

Speaker 2:          01:53:26       Um, you know what? Let's, let's go to the listeners. I would love to hear from the women because they, they're going to have on both sides. They're going to have like, you shouldn't do that, your friend. And then they're also going to be mad on some level. Like why did guys feel like they own somebody just because they youth to go out with them? Because we're territorial with territorial that way. And you have to understand that whoever you've banged in your life as a female, um, for the rest of your life, that pussy is not yours anymore. It belongs to him. And you can say it's yours. It isn't because he fucked it.

Speaker 2:          01:54:09       All right? You know what? I feel like, you know, there wasn't enough ignorance on this podcast, so I feel like I had to just say something stupid like that. But that's, that's how guys work. And, um, I'd even asked you, this is your best friend. Is he bigger than you are physically? Can he beat you down? Does he take Jujitsu classes? Um, has he ever had any murderous thoughts that he, I'm sort of divulge to you at an, you know, a night of drinking too many Tequila shots and you see an a and the darker side of him, you know, there's, there's a whole bunch of Shit, ah, this is what she got to do. This is what you gotta do. Go out and get yourself a fucking pimp hat. All right? And this is what you have to do. You got to go to this girl and you, you just gotta lay it on the fucking table.

Speaker 2:          01:55:01       That's what you gotta do. You just gotta be honest with her and just say, look sweetheart, I have wanted to fuck you since 2006. You don't say that, but basically you finish your way into that. You got to tell her that you've wanted to hook up with her. And the only reason why you didn't, this is the deal. This is all right. Well, we had a little technical difficulty there. I left you hanging. Sorry about that. The batteries just died. I was right in the middle of trying to tell this dude how we could, uh, go out and bang this girl. Now I got to fucking stick this into the goddamn garage band. Splice it together, which I already did at this point. So why even bitch about it when you listen to this fucking thing? All right, let me wrap this God damn podcast up a telling this kid how to go out and fuck his best friend's ex girlfriend.

Speaker 2:          01:55:56       All right. This is what you do. You got to, you got to have a talk with this girl before you do it. Don't just go over there and just fucking sneak over there. You know, with this nervous excitement, fucking rail, this girl bust your nut and then realize, oh my God, I have no fucking feelings for this girl. And then you know, risking that she'll then, you know, be resentful. All the bullshit I said in the first fucking installment of this God damn podcast, this is what you gotta do. You gotta fucking get everything out in the open. All right? And fucking let her convince you that it's the right fucking thing to do and get her to say that she ain't gonna say shit. All right. Get her to say that. And when she says she's not going to say shit, you have to reader.

Speaker 2:          01:56:47       All right? Like a fucking seasoned goddamn pro. You know, the 27 fucking uh, pantomimes align, whatever that fucking goddamn movie was true romance. You got to look at her and Jay. You, you have to, you have to make a fucking assessment. If this girl can keep her fucking mouth shut by presenting these scenarios, you've got to be, look, I'm going to get worried that tomorrow. What if you, you're going to wake up feeling guilty and then you have to confess to him, you know, I'm not going to feel, I'm not going to feel guilty. Yeah, you are. You're just fucking, I don't know. I'm really giving you shit advice, dude. I'm, I'm trying to give you a fucking scumbag way to go out and go do this shit. Just like, I dunno. I'm fucking bad at this, man. I have to be in the moment to what the fuck?

Speaker 2:          01:57:39       Dirt Bag, God damn thing. What I be saying. All right, this is what you do. You don't go over a fucking, this is what you do. Don't go over a goddamn place. See, this is the hard thing. Now you've got to go out. You've got to meet her in public. Okay? So there's no sexual fucking tension that you can act on. All right? So you, Dick won't be like, dude, she's fine. She's not lying. She's not lying. She's going to be cool. What you have to do is, um, you're going to meet in a public place where then people can see a c two. This is just, it's just the fuck. It's a, it's a tough one. Tell you what to it. If you can actually fucking pull this off, why don't you write me back and tell you, tell me how you, how the fuck he did it.

Speaker 2:          01:58:21       I remember a long time ago, I was in the beginning of a relationship and I was banging this, still banging this other psycho on the side. And, uh, like a dirt bag, you know? And I remember there was going to be a point where the two of them were going to be at the same fucking place. So I just dealt with it before. It wasn't before we hooked up. I just said, look, you've got to be honest with you. This girl I'm coming down with, we're new, I'm starting to have feelings for all right. I told her that I cleaned up everything on the side, which I haven't with you, so I need you to not act weird when I fucking come down there. If I don't, you know, if I'm not saying hello to you. Okay. That was before I hooked up with her and she's like, fine, fine.

Speaker 2:          01:59:08       And then she went down there and then she did at cool because in her head she's probably holding out like maybe if I had cool, he'll see how fucking cool I am and they don't want to be with me and not this other bitch. And meanwhile I fucking got away with it. And you know what a part of me died. Another fucking chunk of my soul came out and said, dirty fucking game. It's a dirty God damn game. I'm a piece of shit. Don't fucking listen to me. All right, what else do we got this week? But by the way, dude, now that I've talked about it for 10 fucking minutes, you got, you got to write a Spec and let us know what happened. All right?

Speaker 2:          01:59:45       You know, I realize this might be like one of those stupid Hollywood movies. And then I realized that's not the person I wanted to be doing. If you do that, I don't want to fucking hear it. But if you done, if you do the dirty bullshit, I want to hear about it. Would I be the worst fucking life coach ever? Um, all right, here's a, here's a segment, corporate cons. A bill for someone who flies as much as you do. Can you take a shot at explaining the logic behind why a one way ticket almost costs more than a round trip. Um, for a domestic, for domestic flights, maybe this isn't a problem. However, I'm flying from your, uh, from Europe at the end of the month on a one way ticket, and it costs one and a half times more than a round trip trip ticket. And I immediately said, well, why don't you buy the round trip ticket?

Speaker 2:          02:00:35       And he addresses this immediately and says, and if the airline company can prove that I purchased a roundtrip ticket, it was the attempt of not using the return for the flight. They can legally charge for the price difference between the fares. What the fuck is this normal business practice? I hate to tell you what, but it is because that's how corrupt our fucking government is. That's how powerful corporations are around the fucking world. They, they do whatever they, whatever they want to do. And they have this thing where every quarter they have to show a profit. All right? Uh, actually they have to, to, to show more of a profit than the previous quarter. They can't even just have the same amount of profit. It's not enough. And basically, they've legally run out of ways to create revenue streams. So what they're doing now is they're just stealing.

Speaker 2:          02:01:27       They're stealing from people. All right? If you have a one way ticket, that means you're going home or you're starting a new life and you want to get the fuck out of where you're at. So that's why they know that they can charge you a ton of fucking money. All right? And then, well, what are some buys? A round trip ticket, then we'll fucking, we'll just write this little bill here and we'll have the senator who we fucking paid for his God damn campaign help push it through. Isn't that how it works? They just call the senator. I don't know anything. Um, yeah, no, it's a piece of shit thing. So what you gotta do is you have to vandalize the airplane. All right? Do something to vandalize the fucking airplane. I don't even do that cause all they're going to do is just pass that expense on to us.

Speaker 2:          02:02:10       This is what you have to do. Um, you have to find out who it is that came up with that, who created that? Who was, uh, who was the lobbyist who push that thing through how that somehow became legal. You got to find out where they live and then you just gotta. You gotta tailor them the whole fucking week. Get that patterns down, figure out when they go to the Goddamn Gym. Alright, borrow a pair of pantyhose from your fucking girlfriend, put it over your head, hide in some shrubs. And when that dude comes walking out of the gym with that fucking towel around his neck, you just blast him right in the face and then you fucking choke them with your, choke them. You mushes face into the mulch and you'd be like, that's what a one way ticket from fucking Hollenback to the state yet content.

Speaker 2:          02:03:03       And then you get your fucking Ford Festiva and you drive away. That's the only way to get back at him. And, uh, and if you do that, I'll give you a free DVD, a underrated overrated for the week, uh, underrated, the movie waiting. Uh, it's all about the world of restaurant, waiters, cooks, et cetera. It's funny, honest, and quite gross. I imagine it is because I've worked in a couple of fucking restaurants and the shit that goes on, you know, the shit that you'll do when you're not cooking for a family member is really a, it's staggering. I'll leave it at that. Um, overrated. How, and this is pretty bitter. But anyways, when you watch the special features on a DVD and there's always the making of feature, far too many of these features, including the movie waiting, then I just recommended have the actors and the directors jokingly calling others on the film, useless, awful, amateur, amateurish, et cetera.

Speaker 2:          02:03:58       Uh, they'll talk about how the whole film is a disaster and it will, uh, and we'll go straight to video. Get it. They don't really mean it. They're joking around. Lol, lol. See I told you it was a bitter one. Yeah, I guess, you know, I kind of understand. I mean, how many times can you just sit there and go, Ashton Kutcher with absolutely brilliant in Madame of the butterfly, the butterfly effect whenever the fuck it was called. Um, that seeing his reaction here is right up with Bruce Willis in die hard part three when he turns around and looks at the green screen and pretends to be looking at a jumbo jet. It's was absolutely some of the best act. I mean, how long could you listen to that? So they got to make fun of themselves. Um, I would go with arrogance. I would just talk about my scenes and how fucking amazing I am.

Speaker 2:          02:04:48       Um, while I was pointing out the dumb shit that I did in it, uh, youtube videos for the week and do I, I'm going to tell you, man, I think I'm recommended or at least the listeners of my podcast, we're recommended some of the funniest and best fucking, uh, youtube videos out there. How great would those youtube videos last week? You know, all right, here's one duck face song search, duck face song like quack, quack, duck face song. And this is an amazing one. Search fake Yo yo, trickster fool's. Every TV station everywhere. I mean, granted it could have been shorter but fake Yoyo trickster fool's, every TV station everywhere. This is hilarious. This guy goes on and he claims to be a Yoyo champion and he actually sucks at it and he talks all this shit and then he goes on there and he can't pull off any tricks and he just stands there and leaves the morning news guy with the awkwardness of him completely failing and not handling the failing and just leaving it in the lap of the reporter and it's a, it's fucking awesome.

Speaker 2:          02:05:55       Um, AH, here's one for all you kids and I'm going to use the young kid word. This one is epic. Um, this one isn't on Youtube. This is how cutting edge the Monday morning podcast is. Uh, go to www.everythingisterrible.com. And then search for the video. This is hip hop and uh, it's awesome. It's a fucking white lady. Soccer mom, you know, and she's going to let you know what time it is. I want to leave it at that. Everything is terrible.com. Um, a couple more, uh, for all unique fans out there who will, licking your wounds, go to go search a Lebron James Decision interview parody. I think you'll enjoy that one immensely. Uh, fro you death metal fans who have a sense of humor. And because this one really hinges on actually knowing the song, there's a band called Cannibal corpse and the name of the song is hammer smashed face.

Speaker 2:          02:07:02       And if you don't already know that song, I suggest you listen to it first. Listened to Cannibal corpse hammer smashed face for as long as you can, unless you're death metal fan. And then you'll love it, um, or a fan of comedy. Um, and then go to search, Cannibal Corpse Hammer, smashed face, smash face, Disney radio version. Some fucking genius out there. Basically, you know, I guess death metals, a lot of like, I dunno, the darker chords and he turned them all, plays the same court but in a major court, which are the happier ones. And then he sings the song with the same lyrics. It's fucking great. Um, and that is it. You know what, I didn't bring up asides from for hyping the month, uh, the FM podcast.com, um, is, um, I and all of this Lebron Shit, I didn't really bring up like the fans of fucking Cleveland and yet another fucking blow that those people have to take.

Speaker 2:          02:08:05       I mean, it just, it's brutal between the industry leaving that town and then I'll, you know, cc Sabathia he went, ended up going in New York, Manny Ramirez went to Boston. Jim Tome may went to Philly. I mean they had the team and now they finally get like fucking arguably I would say the next Coby level player. He's got a way to go. But the next Coby level pay a player in Lebron James gave him a reason to go to the downtown area. It sucks. It sucks because downtown Cleveland, if you really look at the buildings, if he can look past the scary homeless people in really look at the buildings, uh, it's beautiful. It's just that, you know, getting back to these corporate cons, they just pulled up stakes and they left because they were sick of paying people a fair wage. And they were sick of having to pay for health insurance and they wanted to have some eight year old go put the fucking grill on a God damn fucking caprice classic. I don't fucking though, same thing with Detroit. Those all those cities, Buffalo, all of them. If you look at him, the buildings, they're very, they're, they're beautiful cities and you can see what they used to be and it's, it's a fucking shame. Um, I dunno, I dunno how to bring them back, you know, buy American, which is why I'm going to get the fucking challenger. Okay. And if I find out that it's actually put together down and fucking Honduras, I'm going to be fucking pissed. All right.

Speaker 2:          02:09:43       Al Challenger is dodge not put together in fucking whatever the fucking thing is. I'm going to learn Spanish, God dammit. And I'm going to have two podcasts. I'll have one in fucking, uh, on glaze in one in fucking espanol. Would that be great? Then I could, then I could actually trash people in their native language about how much soccer is fucking boring. All right. That is a, that's a podcast for this week.
