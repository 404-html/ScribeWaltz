Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn his time for the Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday. Monday morning podcast.

Speaker 2:          00:00:07       Dan,

Speaker 1:          00:00:11       just checking in on you. How are you? We've got the lovely kneel with me. Hello. What's going on? Oh it's Christmas needy. I know. Shady sidewalks. Pretty ladies. Everybody walking around spending money on p Bull Dad. I know them. Yeah. Take Your Dick out and a charger game. Robin up. Bad fucking no, I feel so bad for that kid. Why? Why do you feel bad? Cause I have a dick and I know how hard it is. You know how hard it is? No, sorry. No Pun intended. He was in public. I know, but he just looked like that kind of guy. He did not talk to look if he's a fucking like seriously. I mean if he's fucking like you can't control rubbing his dick and public. It was entrapment dad, like 12 fucking scantily clad women and the whole thing to me, I should question, he was at a game.

Speaker 1:          00:01:13       There's cheerleaders there and how were they dressed? Oh, so it's their fault. How are they dressed? Cheerleader is the way she leaves. And always waitress that this, why can't you guys ever be flattered when a man flash and shit fucking woman never just whipped her who are out? Because I look so good. No fucking tee shirt. It would just fucking make my day long. She stayed away from me. I mean, he was, she was doing his own thing. You know what's hilarious? The way you bring in a public? You know what? I loved the way he had his arms crossed. He was like, well, I can't see what I'm doing. That means no one else can get an idea. Get a fucking the new technique, and I haven't tried the overhand before God across the crossover overhead. That's like a Olympic level jerking off through his pants.

Speaker 1:          00:01:57       You know, look, everybody you know you, that's how you get caught. You know, you fucking, you can't shoot you. He got greedy is what happened. Do you know what I mean? He thought he could. He, you know, he thought he could do, I was like fucking 20,000 people staring right at them yet. Yeah. But you know, okay, look what I'm talking about. Those cheerleaders. Why are they out there near? Why are they really out there to stir the crowd up to cheer more now? They're not spreadsheets. They dress him like fucking like just shy of who is. That's what they're out there for. They got their cleavage, they got their butt cheeks hanging out. Everything's barely covered. Everything's all shiny, glittery, glittery and shit. You know? Hey, what? What? What the fuck was he supposed to do? You know, not touch his dick in public.

Speaker 1:          00:02:49       That's what he was supposed to do there, but for the grace of God go, I really try to say that you would be in a position where you would just be jerking off through your pants in like that. I have 300 shoes. I've never stood next to 12 women all dressed in the same sparkly outfit touching their toes in front of me. Wearing some very user friendly slacks, actions, Laxmi Action slacks. They were, and in art you're saying you wouldn't be able to control yourself? I would say half to touch. If I have to take my my life savings, if I have to take my life saving says no way. I'm betting on black slacks. I'm not, there's no way I'm going to put it all on one thing. I don't know what I would do if I had a couple drinks in me. You know? Who knows? Might do the old law. Who knows? Who Know? Every guy's done that. Don't watch your common blah. Oh, absolutely. Now they have to. At some point they did something. They were in their car. They rubbed one out. They did something. They weren't a porch. Well, guys are always talking on a plane, on a plane. They went to the bathroom and just rubbed one out. The amount of men, I'm just saying the amount of fucking men have done it.

Speaker 1:          00:04:00       Yeah. You got to understand when weight and when you eat. What's that? Are you saying that you've gone to a plane like a bathroom on a plane and jerked off? I swear. No, I have not done that. What are you going to do? I don't know. Scold me. Yes. Gold's you, Shane. I know. Listen guys, I've talked to other guys, Shit that they've done or whatever, you know, hey, we've all done stuff we're not proud of. You know, didn't Jesus say he was not fucking rubbed what out to a fucking cheerleader? You fucking cast cast the front. You know what I hate? Is it that that's the worst at that kid does. Okay. Which is basically all he did was completely humiliate himself. All right? And his life is fucking over it. I mean, isn't that enough? I feel bad for them. I do. Unless he's like really a pervert and he's running around grabbing women and he's ruining people's lives, then yeah, then you know, put the kid down like a rabid dog without a doubt.

Speaker 1:          00:04:53       But if his worst fucking, you know, I love about it is they say men can't multitask. There was a man clearly operating as a security person while rubbing one out that is multitasking and one hand free. So I don't really feel like he was at his full capacity as a security guard while a lot of securities just presence, just people seeing you, seeing you with the, or taking your hand. He had his gun in his hand. I feel bad for them. Don't feel bad. Just hear those sleigh bells. Ring a link. Tink, tink tingling too. He's like, you know a homeless child. Come on and rub one up a fucking cheerleader or to keep it rubbing. Keep the rubber wild. Everyone watches. Oh my God, they're poor bastard. A tweet that this person has Sunday, man. I Dunno. Can you stay focused here? Can I tell you my top?

Speaker 1:          00:05:44       Can I tell you my story today? I went out my hair. I went into, oh, you don't have to be here. What are we watching on TV? Nia.

I can't get up. I have my feet up and I'm pregnant and I'm the size of a house. That's why I'm here. No, you're not. You'll go get an Igloo more than a house that's you look like asshole. Oh, just the shootout. What do you think of the awe? That was a nice movie. He had him too many, skipped off his stick. I don't like the flyer. I don't like the gold numbers on that. Why you'd fly. He's got such a great uniform that kind of fucks it up a little bit.

Speaker 1:          00:06:32       You know somebody's got to buy it. You know that guy just paints his room fucking orange and white. Oh, biggest fair number. You know, you know if you dedicate your whole bedroom, you know painting it, your team color, there's no way you could judge that kid on the charges because you definitely wear slacks and you rub one out in public. Oh sheet. Just fuck you. That was a fuck you. I don't respect you as a goaltender. Did he even do a move? He just stared at him. I was like, this is going in the net bitch. And that's exactly what the fuck cap. Look at this Jesus Christ. Yeah. Dee Dee on it, right? Yeah. Fred. Fuck you. That's one. Nothing in overtime. Oh, sorry. Two, two.

It's like, what do you guys want to be? I don't like target. They like that person who just morphed themselves into what they youth, they think you want them to be so they can be friends with you.

Speaker 1:          00:14:59       It's just like pick a fucking angle. It's like you walk in, you're looking at TVs in the next to cereal. What the fuck is, this is like a fucking yard sale, but everything's, no, um, all right, so I go into target and I'm looking for your fucking shit and every, you know what's funny about target is everybody looks like they work there. So you got to ask like nine fucking people who work here and they get all offended, but you look like you don't, you don't find the clothes here. Your ass all. If they're wearing a red shirt, they work at target. Yeah, but there's different levels. It's like the military. There's different kinds of red shirts does the people with the Pete Carroll dockers and then the red shirt tucked in there like management. Then there's the grumpy, filthy people who got to like fucking unload the trucks all day and they never let them go home. Then I'm going to answer shit and then this sort of dumpy women walking around like, I dunno. I Dunno what they're thinking. It's like they took a pot cookies and every once in a while you meet that one that's on the ball. Who's not going to be there long scar that that was new. Sorry. That's a highlight.

Speaker 1:          00:16:06       That was a nice fucking wrap around goal. Oh, you got to love the wrap around. Oh, he saved it. He had saved that fucking thing. Did he? That's a goal. That's a goal. I would love to review the flood completely. Sleuths so like as I'm leaving, I bought you a high end gift. They're at target, right? I bet your floral apron with a frozen burrito in the pocket and I got to keep it in the freezer until right before, twice the night before Christmas and all through the house. Not a creature was stirring except for this bald freckled fuck taken a frozen burrito. I'm sticking it in the stocking by the way. Underrated stockings, stockings. I don't know about you guys. Like I know some people are like they start with the stockings or that we always end on the stocking and the stockings always like the bump bump, a bomb, Bam.

Speaker 1:          00:16:57       Like you already got your cool gift. Then you go over to the stocking and it's like a, it's like a, you know, a gift certificate to a book club and you've got to sit there acting like, oh yeah. Thank you. I get to read. Awesome. What else is in here? Oh, new socks. I mean, who could use these gold toe? Oh, you shouldn't have. Literally, I would rather wear one stock and walking down the street than a pair of gold told socks just because of what they represent. There's a lot of blood in shame on all those gold toed socks. You know, DME hookers have laid on motel rooms. And the last thing that they saw with somebody, bloody gold told sock walking towards them so bad, so bad during the holiday season, silver bells leaving your family going to get, oh hooker, the goose cools double life. Serial killer. Cops show up one day and you confess to 40 other killings and your wife says, who the fuck are you? What did I do with the last three decades? And you stare at her with no feeling behind your eyes.

Speaker 1:          00:18:20       Anybody got you? Go on this one. They're Nini. You're egging me on here. Like your dark holiday care off. Cause I hate that song. I hate silver bells. It just goes on for, it's like it's just song and a fucking loop. There's no way. This is one song. Oh, did fucking fish record this fucking thing? It's like 20 minutes long. Then, um, silver bells and I hate Jingle Bell Rock. It's just such an attempt of like white people trying to be here. You know, we're going to, jazz is one, a Ginkgo, managing demand. Jingle Bell Rock. Hey, jingle bells.

Speaker 1:          00:18:59       It's that thing where you kind of just shaking your head and your ass at the same time. You know, as you're snapping your fingers with your fucking loafers, that's when somebody, you know, if you're at a party and there's a piano, when somebody knows how to play, they're going to sing that at the holidays, you know? Oh yeah. And then there's going to be the undersexed fucking 20 year old, 20 years married chick with the red wine teeth always start dancing. And it's like, all right, all right, let's get her outta here. Get a cow. Caricom send her home. I just don't know why they stay together. Um, so I'm leaving target. I'm leaving target and a, it looks fucking confused. He was getting interviewed here. Huh. Um, so I'm leaving target and as I'm walking out, all of a sudden I just hear this guy go on, get off me.

Speaker 1:          00:19:46       And I look over and there's two target ladies there at the Pete Carroll level of the target thing and a in a, in a target guy. Two women in a guy are just fucking grabbing this dude and they're dragging them into like this windowless office and the guys going, this isn't legal. And they just dragging them in and everybody's just watching like what the fuck? And then like the door starts to close and then it opens your fucking clothes as again and then another. And then they finally got him to calm down and they closed the door and this older manager just closed the door and he did that. You know it's smile you do when you walk by a stranger because you're hoping they don't have an ax. You know that little purse lip. We kind of do. You lift your eyebrows up. He kind of did that like well that's the end of that. And it's like that's an American citizen in there, sir. What the fuck just happened? But nobody said anything cause its target, you just don't expect it. So I said to the lady next to me, I go, did he steal something? She goes, no, I don't think so. And then somebody else goes, I think he's autistic. And he was acting a little weird.

Speaker 1:          00:20:53       Drag them into this by me. The back room. Yeah. I don't think that that's makes sense. It doesn't make sense. Does it make sense? But I feel like why would they take it upon themselves to drag him away? Why wouldn't they call the police? I know it looked like that Scientology show that you're watching that the stuff that they do to people, except it was a target. You know? I wonder if one of those people were going to do a two TV show, exposing target and what? What really goes on there? They probably wanted him to work all three shifts on Christmas. He said no, they just dragged them in there. They don't fuck around at target. I guess not. Are you fucking kidding me? Did that guy just score from the other side of the, I'm just watching the highlights. That's pathetic. And that was it. And that was the end of a, and then I just sort of walked out and I have to admit when he rolls of paper towel. Yes. Merry Christmas Neal.

Speaker 1:          00:21:51       I'm expecting a lot of big tears next year. Big Tears. Big Tears. It's been someone who was, I should probably read some advertising here. I'm like, oh, this is fucking, what a great night we got the fire going. Oh, tell them how much I like Eggnog. A lot of people don't like Eggnog. I like you love Eggnog. I love now too. Well what it is, this was always shy about it cause I was like, yeah, I don't know if it's my thing, but it's delicious. Yeah, but people pour you a giant fucking glass of it. It's, it's like in a, it's a, uh, like a, what are they not an aphrodisiac? What'd they say? What's that shit? You're drinking Italy after year after year. That's what it is. But with did Jeff. Steve, that's it. Yeah. Digestive. You have a big meal. You sip on a little egg. Nog It's like mountain ice cream.

Speaker 4:          00:22:36       And I like it.

Speaker 1:          00:22:38       Wait, hold up. The podcast where I type in my fucking park, Jess, it tastes like Malkin melted ice cream. And I like it.

I yes, I do.

Speaker 1:          00:37:24       Ask me if I got the NBA hardcore, whatever the fuck they call it of Cory. I've got that toe and asked me if I got an NFL Sunday ticket. Nfl. Yes I do. I got all three so I can watch my patriots, my Celtics, and my Bruins. And what I've noticed with the Celtics and the Bruins. Okay. If the Celtics Luiz Isaiah Thomas, it's fucking over. They lose, like they lost like fucking three in a row and he comes back and all of a sudden when that Memphis game was fucking incredible, but my DVR shut off with like five seconds to going over time. I think we want. Um, and then the Bruins, if Charlie goes down, like that's been the thing the whole time though. But, um, um, you know what? I've been bitching about Michael Carneal. When you rebuild a team, it takes at least two to three seasons.

Speaker 1:          00:38:10       So we'll see which direction he's going in. I don't know. I don't fucking know. But it's been tough to watch him this year cause I love him and, uh, and I loved a lot of the guys they got rid of and it's hard watching them on other teams doing fucking great, you know, I know there's a salary cap and all that shit. I'm going to quit fucking pitching. Um, so anyways, I guess that's the podcast here and you're going to fall asleep. I know. Oh Jesus. Well, you know what? I'm glad I knocked this thing out before you fell asleep. Um, everybody has no energy. It's all right. Everybody have a merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Happy Hanukkah. Happy Kwanzaa.

Speaker 6:          00:39:44       please. You can, as long as you can sit around and wait for the phone waiting. Who's someone you sit around and wonder what to mom?

Speaker 1:          00:40:24       Ooh.

Speaker 7:          00:40:55       Hmm. [inaudible] uh, uh, uh,

Speaker 8:          00:41:32       happy holidays.

Speaker 9:          00:41:34       It's the Monday morning podcast. How did you like that little second grade fucking recital? That was horrible. I thought it was going to get through it in one take. I should have been asked and I shouldn't. That's like the kind of guitar playing, you hear it, a benefit and whatever the benefit is, like whatever the disease it's for. Like if that guitar playing, like I would have the disease that you guys were raising money for and then in the end they wheeled me out and they'd be like, Hey, here's a guy who has the disease that we're trying to stop and now he's going to play the guitar for you. That's how I just played the guitar. But I don't give a fuck. You know, I can't help it know I can't help it. If from fucking, not even going to say multitalented, it's not the word.

Speaker 9:          00:42:19       What's the reverse of multi one dimensional? I can't help it if I'm a one trick pony. Anyways, this is the Monday morning podcast for the, uh, uh, the week of Christmas, which is why I had my little recital. Um, you know what's hilarious is last year, um, besides my guitar playing, um, it was last year I took off. I didn't do a podcast on the week of Christmas or the week of new years and everyone thought it was, cause I, you know, I was taking a vacation or whatever. But the reality is is is because I was traveling and holiday travel sucks. So as many of you know, this year I was like, you know what? Fuck this. Fuck everybody. I'm not going home for the holidays because I'm not dealing with that planes, trains and automobiles shit. And I got to tell you, man, it's the smartest goddamn thing I ever did. I don't know what that says about me, but I'm not spending it with my family and I am absolutely fucking elated.

Speaker 9:          00:43:18       You know, I'm not saying I don't like my family, I'm just saying I don't need to go see them when everyone else is going to go see their family because uh, cause it sucks. I had a buddy of mine see, you know, trying to fly back east with all this snow and all this shit. He's down in Orange County calling me up. That same situation I was in last year. Do you believe it would plea? Go to two old blue, blue, blue, blue, blue. And I was like, thank God, thank God I made the right choice. Fucking excited. I got a Christmas tree, I got stockings, I got a Ukulele. I mean, what, what, what, what do you need with Morty of fucking neat? I don't know. Some inner peace maybe, but I don't want to get greedy. Um, I'm, I'm, I'm two inches away from getting a dog.

Speaker 9:          00:44:07       People, I know, I've said it for about two years on this podcast, even though I've only been doing them for a little over a year, I'm freaking out. I'm terrified to get a dog because I'm like, you know, what, if, uh, what if I want to take off for a couple of days? I mean, I don't, I've never had to take care of anything in my life, you know, and uh, never been at a movie going, Oh my God, what if taking a shit in my living room? You know, I don't want to be thinking that, especially at this time of year when there's all these great movies are out, you know, speaking of which, um, somebody sent me a great email and said, we'll get back to the dog thing. I want to get a dog. And if I get a dog and getting a fucking bulldog and I'm going to a breeder, I know a lot of people.

Speaker 9:          00:44:53       I'm going to, God, you should rescue a dog. You know, I don't have time for you. You understand me? That's your cause. You go down there and you, you, you get all those, you get all those dogs, you go down and you get them that I've already learned how to fetch and they're just completely over everything. Nothing's exciting anymore. You know what I mean? I mean, why don't I just pick up a fucking divorce waitress with three kids that hate her, you know, and, and bring that into my life and I'll just surround myself with people who are just fucking over everything. You know?

Speaker 9:          00:45:29       Sometimes I just really say stupid shit. I don't, I don't feel any of that. You know what, I went down to the shelter. I wanted to rescue all the dogs and I don't fucking know. I don't know. I'm talking about, I'm just trying to kill time. People has, I'm trying to find the thing about the movie reviews. Yeah. Somebody send me an email and they said, hey bill, I haven't heard movie reviews in a while. Now some of my longtime listeners of the podcast, remember we stopped people write in because I went and I saw a shitty movie one time and I was pissed. You know, I lost my 10 bucks or whatever the fuck they're charging now. Um, so people started, you know, thrown in that 2 cents. So here's some movie reviews. This guy said punisher war zone and he gives it three stars.

Speaker 9:          00:46:10       Punisher warzone what the fuck is that? Um, evidently he says there's tons of over the top violence and shooting. It doesn't try to be realistic at all. Like the last one, the first punisher warzone tried to be real. That's funny with that name. Uh, the story was very basic with no real twist. You know what? I can appreciate that. Okay. So it's like commando. They fucked with them. He gotten his Bronco and he kicks ass and then he wins. I like it. I'm going to, I'm, you know what, I'm not going to go see it, but I will watch it on. Um, that'll be the new part of the movie reviews. I'll let you know if I'm going to see it. I'm going to see that. Okay. You guys fulfilled. Now does this make any holidays? I'm going to go see punish awards. No, no.

Speaker 9:          00:46:51       I'm gonna, I'm gonna sit on my fucking huge couch and I'm going to watch it. Um, the next review he did, the day the earth stood still, he gave it three stars. Sky's very, uh, it's very liberal with the stars here. Some people who were in the theater with me were pissed at it when it ended, but it's a remake and I knew it was going to happen. It isn't really supposed to be an over the top independence day blockbuster. It's more story oriented. And there was some surprise stars that I didn't know were in it. Like so and so and so and so. Well, thanks for ruining it for me. And I give a fuck. I'm not really into those cameos. I hate when people get excited about cameos.

Speaker 9:          00:47:31       Tom Cruise Kid, I had no idea he was in it. Yeah. What are the more surprising if like one of your relatives walked in? It's not like Tom Cruise isn't an actor. You know, it's not like he hasn't been doing movies for 25 years. I can't believe that actor all of a sudden showed up in a movie and was acting. I W I was really blown away. Um, oh, I'm in a pissy mood. Um, let's see. Oh, this is the two movies I saw this weekend. I saw a, the wrestler with Mickey Rourke, which was fucking awesome. And uh, any, if you're a fan of wrestling, if you're a fan of Mickey Rourke, you got to go see it. He's fucking great. And it, and uh, they really capture the more ronic wrestling fan, which I was perfectly. And then I also saw that movie milk starring Sean Penn as Harvey Milk. And I got to admit, I was shying away from that movie.

Speaker 9:          00:48:27       I wanted to go see it because I love Sean Penn, but every, a male friend of mine was saying, I was like, yeah, I want to go see that movie milk. Uh, did you see it? And they'd be like, yeah, I saw it, but I just to warn ya, lot of male kissing, which is not a, uh, that's not a selling point with a lot of guys, myself included. And I was sitting there going, but I got to go see it. It's Sean Penn and um, I don't know, there wasn't a lot of kissing, but it, it, after awhile you sort of get used to it, which I don't know if that's a good thing. I'm really on the fence about that. I don't know what the fuck. You know what I mean? It's weird. If I was on like a youporn or to bait and I was watching two guys kissing, people will be looking at me like, dude, what the fuck is wrong with you?

Speaker 9:          00:49:17       You know, what's your deal? You got something to tell me. I can't just sit there. We, oh, it's just a porno. You know, this is a, you know, this is the, then he go see a movie and then all of a sudden it's okay, this is art. This is art. I don't know. It wasn't that big a deal. It wasn't an Sean Penn was fucking unreal and uh, it was an amazing, it's an amazing movie with a lot of male kissing. You know, I got to met, that's the first time I've seen an amazing movie that had a lot of male kissing. I think they started a whole new genre. Um, so I don't know. You know what I'm, because I have OCD, I plan on seeing like fucking nine more movies this week. There's some mob movie I wanted to go see. What the fuck was the name of that.

Speaker 9:          00:50:03       I'm going to rise here. This is Mrs Typical me. Like I haven't seen a movie in about eight months. And then I go and I see one movie. Then I'm like, I'm going to go see everything. It's like, I don't understand why I can't. This is why I don't do drugs. I'm going to go see a Gamora, g. O, m. O, r, r, a. H. Evidently it's a mob movie cause I got to wash off that, that male kissing to prove to myself in a cinematic way that I'm still a man. Um, I'm going to go see this movie. Evidently it's a mob movie that kind of takes away all the Glam of being in the mom. You know what I mean? I mean, when you watch Goodfellas, you don't really think like, wow, thank God I never joined the Mafia. You know, you, you, you know, you want the cars.

Speaker 9:          00:50:52       I don't know. You want the fucking, I dunno. I can't say the women, the women, pretty fucking nasty and good fellas. The, you know what it was that girl with a cold sore just ruins it for every woman in that. Then I just think they all have herpes and then it just fucking ends it for me. Can I just messed this up here? Sorry guys. Is this going to be another slow podcast? Fuck yourselves. I'm on vacation. All right, let's get to the podcast questions, Sally. Um, if you new to my podcast, people send me podcast questions every single week and I try and answer them, add to the best of my ability. Um, so here we go. Podcasts, podcasts came and talk. Question number one. Uh, Bill, uh, I have a question for you as a well-informed hockey fan. What are your thoughts on the Chicago Blackhawks chances this season?

Speaker 9:          00:51:44       Um, also what the fuck? Why the fuck did the Bruins get rid of Thornton? Uh, what did they get rid of? Thorton. Cause they didn't feel like they key could lead them deep into the playoffs. He played on a Bruins teams and that people felt they didn't have any heart and cause he was the big paid guy. They blamed him, which was a, wasn't fair. All I know is we didn't get shit from, we didn't get shit for the guy. How do I think the Blackhawks are going to do this year? A transition year. They're not going to do shit. Speaking of that, let's talk about the New York Yankees and them throwing their fucking wallet's around. Huh? It's Monday and I've heard that. I haven't watched ESPN yet, but I heard they had this close to signing Manny Ramirez. So they signed cc Sabathia that white dude from Toronto, the pitcher.

Speaker 9:          00:52:32       And uh, I dunno, I fucking love every, as a red sox fan, I'm loving every second of it. That's exactly right. Go ahead and do the exact same fucking thing. It's like watching an alcoholic, just making the same fucking mistakes over and over and over again thinking that you're going to get a different result. You've had a Rod Cheetah and Gian be just in your fucking in field for the last five years or whatever. Or at least Jeter in Jambi, that Combo you had for seven years. You haven't done shit. You haven't won shit. And Randy Johnson with those three guys behind them. Plus, I mean, look at the look at the list to start when the Yankees were the shit, they got it from their farm team, I don't know. And then they would pick up these fucking nerds along the way. Paul O'Neill, who knew Lee was great.

Speaker 9:          00:53:24       Scott Parotias, chuck Knoblauch, you know, they just don't know. I don't know what they're doing. They always go out and they get the fucking big swinging Dick and then you've got, you got too much swinging dick in your clubhouse house, you're not going to win. You can't. If it was just that fucking easy, the Yankees would win it every year. Wasn't they look a little bit over, not the fucking the red sox try doing that one year. I remember that year we got a Eric gynae. That guy almost fucked up our whole season last year we got that big bloated steroid jackass. Remember that? And we had already added a, what's his face there in right field? I swear to God the second season as, I can't even remember anybody's name. I was going to say Trot Nixon know the new guy a fucking uh, junior Felix. What the fuck is his name out there?

Speaker 9:          00:54:15       The guy everybody says is a cunt and he doesn't do well during the season and then he shows up. He shows up in October. That guy, I thought that's the red sox last year were very, uh, 2007. We're teetering on that Yankee esque sort of thing, but they still had like four or five guys from their, uh, from their farm team. I don't understand what the Yankees are doing, but I hope they keep doing it. I hope to do it. I hope they have a fucking $500 million team and they get bounced out in the first round. That's going to be fucking a list of my favorite part of the year in baseball is when they pan down that Yankee dugout and you just see one fucking zillionaire after one hall of Famer after another, just fucking sitting there with that look on their face. And I got Jesus Christ.

Speaker 9:          00:55:07       It looks like we're going home early again this year. I don't know. Fucking though, you know, I don't know. But I will say this many is worth the money and uh, he's definitely worth the fucking money. Cc Sabathia only because he's 26, but I gotta tell you, man, that guy is built like Bartolo Cologne. All right. And you can't walk around with that sack of potatoes hanging right over your dick for too long before you started having lower back pain. You can't pitch anymore. It's like broads with big tits. They can ride it out until like 35 37 and after a while they're like, listen man, I, I can't go today. I just can't do it. You know, I'm fucking my arm shot and it's the end of their career and they get their titties reduced. So cc Sabathia it needs to stop going to the fucking, what the fuck would he go when it's cc Sabathia see an olive garden guy.

Speaker 9:          00:56:04       He's got the money though. I Dunno what he's doing. He looks like he just has like one of those MTV cribs refrigerators. You know what I mean? When they got like, you know, they got like a case of fucking Coca Cola and every bag of fucking junk food. You know what I'm convinced fat people eat at night. That's where they get fat because if you hang out with a fat person, you, you know, you hang out with them all day long. They just saw eating when you eat and yeah, maybe they'll get an extra fucking cheeseburger at Mcdonald's, but they don't go anything crazy. I think it's at night, at night, that's when they get up and they just start going through the cupboards and they just, they just start throwing the fuck down. I think that's what cc Sabathia is going to be doing on the road with any luck.

Speaker 9:          00:56:48       Um, I dunno. What the fuck you gotta do. Um, what else? I'm gonna keep talking about sports. I think I'm going to piss off everybody. At least half in New York. He got so many fucking teams met fans. Probably enjoyed that. What about those jets? Huh? Can you fucking believe it? They choked. It gets the Goddamn Seahawks and they're the patriots right in the thick of it. And I know what you're going to say. You can say, Bill, you're fucking bandwagon. Well, that's bullshit because I got a bet with the shred and Reagan show, which I'm going to fuck. Fuck it in columns. Too late. The shred and Reagan show out in Buffalo, New York. I bet them the fucking week when Tom Brady went down, Reagan was talking all this shit and I hope he's listening to this. He was talking all this shit. Bill Bella, check is a punk. He's never one without a superstar quarterback, Yada, Yada, Yada.

Speaker 9:          00:57:38       All this fucking crap. And I said, let me tell you something, Reagan, let me tell you something. And Reagan not only are the Patriots can have a winning season, they are going to fucking win the division. I called that after Brady went down, called it. I bet him 50 bucks, if I lose, I own 50 bucks. But if I win, Reagan has to read an uh, an on air apology to bill Belicheck that I get to write. It's going to be great. Now he negotiated it down to only six sentences. It can only be, the apology can only be six sentences long, but he's not familiar with my ability with conjunctions. Alright, that fucking thing is going to be a page and a half of what a brilliant coach bill check is there. Those guys on ESPN was saying that shit. You know, he's never worn with Dota superstar quarterback and neither did Vince Lombardi needed a chuck Noll needed at Tom Landry.

Speaker 9:          00:58:37       Neither did Bill Walsh. Did. Those guys all suck. Joe Gibbs. Joe Gibbs never really had a superstar quarterback. Doug Williams was a superstar who just played for the Buccaneers. You know what I mean? So maybe he did, but he had what? Mark Repin and Joe Fat. Joe Theismann was on the fence. It was like a Apollo Neal level guy. I didn't, what the fuck I'm talking about? All I know is next week, this is what this is what I love about this situation. Next week is New York can actually help Boston have a great fucking new years. If they can beat the shit out of the dolphins, if they can show up, huh? Your punk ass team will show up and when a Goddamn game going out to Seattle and lose, and you guys ought to be ashamed of yourselves, why am I picking on jets? Fans actually feel bad for you guys if you didn't have man genie manned Genio like, all right.

Speaker 9:          00:59:27       He drove the getaway car all those fucking years. And then he read it out. Bill Belicheck. Ooh, look, he's robbing a bank. Dude. You're driving the car. Shut the fuck up. Fucking baby. All right. Am I even doing questions at this point? I'm just talking shit about sports. How about those Bruins? How about those Celtics? Huh? I didn't need to go out for Christmas. The fucking Boston teams of bringing it home for me. It got the NHL package. I'm only watched the first period of the Saint Louis Blues game. Don't ruin it for me. Don't be a spoiler. All right, question number two, Bill. What do you think of MTV switched? Sweet. Jesus Christ. I can read out loud. I'm fucking Moron, Bill. Let's go slope. What do you think of MTVs sweet 16 show and part two. What did you do for your sweet 16? All right. What do I think of the sweet 16 show?

Speaker 9:          01:00:20       A it makes me angry. Um, I try to keep my mind that there are only 16, but I just really, I don't like dumb cons, you know, I don't like them when I'm walking down the street and I'm certainly not going to watch your show about it. So, uh, that's how I feel about that. And what did I do for my sweet 16? I went down to the DMV and I got my, my learner's permit. That's what I did was always a big deal for me. Learning how to drive and uh, what did I do? I have no idea. I have no fucking night. I don't remember that Shit. It's fucking 24 years ago. Uh, number three. I like how I took that question and literally like, what did you do for your sweet 16? You know, I guess I was supposed to be like, well, I put ribbons in my hair.

Speaker 9:          01:01:04       I literally took it like straight up. Like I have no idea what I did. That was 24 years ago. Well, thanks for sucking all the comedy out of that question, Bill. Sorry about that. Whoever wrote that, he sent me up. Beautiful. You loved it over the net and I took a big swing and a miss kind of like a rod in October. Oh, he's killing the Yankees. I, Nah, there's somebody right now who already has a fucking Manny Ramirez poster hanging over his bed, fucking Boston to Townsel fucking lame everything and closes the Focalin tool. New Folk morning. What? The fork? Yeah. We also go out at seven 30 at night and we start drinking. You fucking jackass is still putting on Cologne at 1130 at night. All right, so fuck you and your city. That open is open all night. What a crock of shit that was.

Speaker 9:          01:01:51       You know what? I'm first moved to New York another time I took it literally like when they said New York, the city that never sleeps, it's open all night long. I thought that meant everything. Like banks, hardware stores, you know what I mean? Like I go, I could buy a lamp at like three 30 in the morning, but no, it does. It does shut down and people do go to sleep and, but their bars to stay up until four in the morning. Other than that, I fucked that. It's the greatest Goddamn city. It's our Paris. I'm not even gonna lie. It's fucking awesome. I love it. But I really don't like their sports teams. Um, okay. If you didn't notice, all right, why don't you get back to the questions and stop making it so fucking personal with one city. There's other cities listening and other countries hello to all the people in England that I've been getting questions from lately.

Speaker 9:          01:02:36       Um, I'm going to be over that next year. You mother fuckers. Um, so, uh, you know, I dunno, whatever it is you do to get prepared for comedy shows. What do you do in English? Do you guys really eat pork chops for breakfast? Actually watch that show. You are what you eat. You know, which made me feel a lot better about how auto shaped this country is when I saw all those people over there. Like, you know, w what do you start? Do I start my day? I have like I have a couple of fry ups and for you Americans listening, a fry up is rather than just making an egg over easy, you know, cooking it in butter, fried frying an egg, they actually, from what I gather from the footage, because it's not like they have the recipe, they pour like cooking oil into a pot and they boil it.

Speaker 9:          01:03:24       It's almost like you're poaching an egg in Greece, so they have like four of those to start the day and then they have labor. They have like these little fucking, I don't know, these little pork sandwiches and they're really big on Indian food. Why do you guys have so many Indians over there? Literally people from India. Is that the whole Winston Churchill thing? You know, that's another book I started reading and I never got through. I really wanted to get through that book so I can sound intelligent at some point. It was a whole book about the relationship between, or was it Winston Churchill and Gandhi gets fucking whacked. Just, you know, it's unbelievable. All these people out there who think that they're being dangerous on stage and type of, you know, if nobody's made an attempt on your life, you're not saying anything. That's when you know that you're on stage saying something I think is when somebody tries to fucking shoot you in the back of the head at that point.

Speaker 9:          01:04:18       Right. Then you're saying something, but you know enough with all these dangerous artists. I really hate that shit. When people take, they had head shots and they have like a, you know, they had like a piece of tape over their mouth. Like, like the, the government put it, you know, if he said duck taping, let's stupid fucking like, Ooh, he's dangerous. He's doing some spoken word. He figured out a word that rhymes with Illuminati. Everybody run for cover. He's going to sing a song about the work and man, you're not dangerous. Okay, okay. If you dangerous, they tried to kill you and they do. All right. Okay. You know, did fucking Martin Luther King, I have a poster of himself with the fucking, you know, in, you know, piece of tape over his mouth and shrugging his shoulder like, ugh. Well either whether they go, hey, but the good day.

Speaker 9:          01:05:11       All right. Um, let's get back to the questions. Question number three. We'll, have you ever been dealing the case of the runs all day and had to go onstage? Tough it out, cold sweats, bubbling stomach, stomach, and all, you know, I love this question is he could've asked me anything and I would have answered it. And he just basically said, yeah, that go on stage and like, yeah, to take a shit and really bad, you know, like, well, what was that like? Did that ever happened to me? Uh, yeah, it's happened to me a number of times. Mean I've been doing it for almost 17 years. Um, I've had an untimely fucking salad that went right through me. Garlic is another thing I don't do well with. And the amazing thing is the second you go on stage, for the most part, it stops, uh, I don't know, some sort of survival adrenaline thing kicks in that, uh, just says, oh, wait a second, we're not shitting.

Speaker 9:          01:06:06       No, we're not. No, we're not. Okay. So you just need to shut down that thought. You need to sit there and wait until I'm done with this stuff that I've had the hiccups right before I went on stage going, oh my God, I have hiccups. What am I, what am I going to do? And the second I get out there, they go away. I don't know why, but they do. So yeah, I've, I've got to do that. I've heard of stories of comedians literally being onstage, stopping the show and just saying, I have to, uh, I have to leave now. In fact, I want to say Dana Gould told a story like that the other day on the Adam Carolla show. Um, I dunno. I Dunno. I can't remember. Anyways, let's get back to the question says Shanell. Okay, here we go. Um, let's see. Let's see. Let's see. Question number four. Bill, if you could be with the girl of your dreams, any girl marry her, have great sex every night, everything was great and you were happy, but she had to sleep with one guy. Any guy in the whole rural world, who would the guy be and who would the girl be? Great fucking question. Let's get with the guy. That's the easy one. That would be, um, one of those unbelievably over the top gay guys.

Speaker 9:          01:07:22       You know, those guys who were just like this. So they're the ones who actually, they get gay bashed and the reason they get gay bash because there's so putting out a female vibe, it confuses the mail. That's why they, you know, and if you're not, you know, if you're a psycho, you get so pissed. Like, why am, why am, why am I feeling like this? This is a female. When it's a guy you, you just start punching it because you don't know how to, I don't know. Well, I don't know the motivation behind fucking gay bash and all I could say, yeah, I would find the most, uh, over the top, but not like that dude. On will and grace because he's still a dude. He's just sort of skipping around I guess the most of feminine. I'm trying to think maybe like one of those, uh, if it's like Filipino, some little Asian hairless dude, I go that way.

Speaker 9:          01:08:21       You know what I mean? Yeah. I go that way. Um, and if it had to be any girl in the world, who would it be? Uh, Jesus Christ. Um, I dunno. Everybody goes with somebody famous, what would it be? You know, what, how, you know what I do? I would go back to my adolescence when I was innocent and you don't, when you, back then when you actually looked at a girl and you had like, uh, like remember that the way that, uh, what the for that Biloxi blues with our guide to describe that, that little mini heart attack, you know, when you lean back in a chair, I had a couple of girls back in the day when I looked at him, I felt that like that lightening bolt, which only happens when you're young, when you get older, you just, you just went through it too many times.

Speaker 9:          01:09:10       And again, look at those shoes. She probably likes to get tied up. How old is she? 28 probably on her second fucking major relationship, you know, let's find out if her parents are still together. That's always a good fucking measuring stick. You know, you start thinking like that and you just lose it. So I would go back then and uh, yeah I would do and I'm not going to say the girl's name, probably a girl back then. Well one of the two or three girls back there that fucking made me out of a heart attack. I would hook up with them. You know what? That was actually a very sweet answer. I've been, I have a lot of females going ah, really sweet. He does have a this side. There's a bunch of guys. What? I'm fucking queer. Um, alright. Question number five bill. I was searching, I was searching through youtube and I found this interesting video file.

Speaker 9:          01:09:59       It was Jesse Ventura talking about how most of September 11th was caused by our government. And I'll fill you non wrestling fans are political people out there. Jesse Ventura used to be a professional wrestler, went by Jesse the body Ventura. And one of my favorite things, they used to call Tito Tito Santana. Santana used to call them Chico Santana. And uh, he was part of the tag team champion who was, it was Larry's Abisko Bisco Tony Garcia. Who the fuck was Tito Santana? Was he would Ivan pushkey and Tito Santana. Let me, I don't care about no Chico Santana. He was awesome. And then he also said that Song Jessie's girl was about him. Um, but anyway, I think he was also a fucking, was he a senator in Minnesota? So anyways, that's the guy's background with my fucking digression there. Say a former wrestler, former senator I believe, or a representative of Minnesota. And anyway, he was talking about how most of September 11th was caused by our government and how we blew up the two World Trade Center towers towers.

Speaker 9:          01:11:04       He said from his experiences in the navy seals that buildings don't fall at the rate of gravity. Your thoughts, thanks again. Um, my first gut feeling is they don't teach you how to implode a skyscraper when you join. The navy seals and um, buildings don't fall at the rate of gravity. I don't feel that they teach you that. The navy seals, I think they teach you how to swim underwater, how to cut somebody with a knife from ear to ear and not have any guilt over it. How to move stealthily, how to kill people. I don't think at any point, I'm trying to think of anything that the navy seals were accused of any skyscraper implosions that they were accused of, but our government denied any sort of knowledge of granted it would be top secret. Um, I'm guessing he went on youtube like me and a watch, the same conspiracy theories that I watched, uh, those same videos and now he's trying to act like he came up with it himself to make himself sound a little more intelligent by throwing in the navy seal's thick, you know, from my experience in the Navy Seals, uh, buildings don't fall at the rate of gravity.

Speaker 9:          01:12:18       Really. Did they teach you that when you were putting on your flippers, you jackass when, when the fuck did they teach you that, you know what I mean? I'm sure they taught you how to climb up the side of a building, but you know, I don't really think it's in, you know, we have, we have [inaudible] means to take down buildings. We don't have fucking eight guys in frog suits do that. You know, I think he's just throwing it out there that's like, well, you know, a bill. What do you think about September 11th? Well, my experience as a, a headlining comedian around the country leads me to believe that a building's don't fall at the rate of gravity. So a, yeah. Oh, excuse me. I have a third show tonight. You know, if, if he was an architect, I would believe that. Um, I guess you're asking me what am I thoughts do I think, I dunno what happened on September 11th.

Speaker 9:          01:13:09       I know there's a lot of, there's a lot of questions and I don't feel like we're being told the whole story. And I'm not saying our government did it, but I don't know what happened. But I know it's not what they told me. I think they told you some of what happened and then other stuff they felt like they couldn't tell you. And then other shit they use to manipulate shits so they could do some other shit, which is why we're all in a big bag of shit right now. All right, question number six. Bill parents named their kid. Uh Oh yeah. I saw this story to parents named their kid, one of their kids, Adolf Hitler and another one Arion nation. I think it's great. Now we can keep an eye on the little fuckers. Oh, wait a minute. That's my response. I was like, wow, this kid agrees with me. Um, yeah, I do think it's great. I think it's, it's for that exact reason. You know what I mean? The next Adolf Hitler is not going to be named Adolf Hitler or Arian nation. His name is going to be like Mike or Jason. You know what I mean?

Speaker 9:          01:14:12       You know? I don't know. I don't know how the fuck he explain it. It's like anything, anytime somebody comes along and look, they will do what he sees the next Jimmy Hendrix, you know, it's like there's never another Jimi Hendrix. There's never going to be another eight. I'm not gonna be another fucking guy with the same name. You named the Kid Adolf Hitler. Joseph Stalin. They're not going to walk. They're not going to do anything. You just, you gave them a tattoo. You know Adolf Hitler came to power. He actually ran for office when new, nobody knew of the name Adolf Hitler. And he got in there and once he got in there with his guys, that's when he started doing shit. So if this little fucker rubber runs for all for office, he can't, you know, it's, it's great. They're just hung a sign around him. Pay Attention. My, uh, my parents were fucking maniacs and I'm filled with hate.

Speaker 9:          01:15:08       You know, he can't run for office. Who? You, who you voted for. You vote for Obama. You voted for a fucking John Mccain. Are you voting for I Adolf Hitler and his running mate, Arion nation. I think all racists should name their kids. Stuff like that, you know, just, you know, name. I'm fucked up. Names like that. And then they can all giggle about it. Hey, there's a little laid off and then we'll, you know, it's like the, you know, I don't know how many times can I make the same fucking point and that's around. I really don't give a shit. Um, I don't think it's offensive either. I think those people can name their kids, whatever the fuck they want to name. Um, and, uh, like I said, it's a major red flag.

Speaker 9:          01:15:50       Dad, can I go my friend's house? Yes. Uh, well what will we go over? You don't know if Steve's house? No. Adolf eight. His kids' names. Adolph. Yeah. What? What's his last name? Hitler saw y'all. Can I go? Ah, no, no, you can't. Why not? Well, I'll explain it to you. Like, why don't we sit down and watch the history channel together. I know. Wanda, what's boring? Shut the fuck up. You Little Brat. Question number seven. Um, since you've been traveling across the country for the past decade or so, what's the best urban legend you ever heard of? Okay. Urban legends. Uh, I've heard so many good ones. Um, I, well, I grew up in the 80s, so there was a lot of fear about a during that time. And um, I remember there was an urban legend about a guy. He's in a bar, he makes this chick, she's totally smoke and looks like a fucking supermodel. They go back to her place, you know, whatever, her hotel, she gives him the best blow job ever that bang. And I've invited the greatest fucking night ever. He wakes up the next morning she's gone and he walks into the bathroom and then on the mirror is written in lipstick. Congratulations. Now we both have age because evidently he didn't use a condom. And I remember being in a room, in a warehouse believing every word going, really do what we do. Where did that happen? I don't know, Dude. I think it was in Rhode Island.

Speaker 9:          01:17:28       I was a moron. I liked that one. And I liked a, there was another one out there about a guy, he meets a girl in a bar and uh, she says, hey, and she's totally smoking. And she says, Hey, this is the deal. You can come back to my place, you can do whatever you want to me, but in the end I get to do whatever I want to you. I was like, yeah, fucking let's go. So you know, he does anything you could possibly do with the woman you know, has an orgasm, everything's great. And she goes, okay, now it's my turn. And she ties him down to the bed. So he's like, okay, she's under this freaky Dominic for Shit, whatever. She walks out of the room, you know, closes the door and all of a sudden the door fucking kicks open and there's a black dude dressed like Batman and he comes in and he fucks the guy in the ass.

Speaker 9:          01:18:20       And I actually believed it. Like that totally made sense to me. I was like, once again, 1819. When did that happen? I don't know. I think it was in Chelsea. Um, yeah, probably that one. And then, then anyone, any, any of the firecracker, urban legends, you know, somebody put an mat in somebody's back pocket and blew half his ass off. Always liked that one. Um, yeah, I would say that. All right. And it's the second part of the question also. Do you believe in Spooky Supernatural Shit? No. Yes and no. I believe in outer body experiences. I believe in some sort of, uh, I dunno, I don't even afterlife, but so just some shit that we don't, we don't understand and we can't happen too. I definitely believe in that, but I don't believe in ghosts like there that you know, that they're going to haunt me. I just don't get what it goes. Can Do. You know, it's invisible. I can't see it. Okay. So what does it rattles a land and it goes boom. All right. Now that I get used to that, and um, you know, the worst he can just be as a pain in the ass, just knock shit off my dresser.

Speaker 9:          01:19:40       And I said, really? And I can just fuck with him mentally. Just torture him. Spec really when maybe that's why. Maybe that's why you're a ghost. You ever think about that? Maybe you're just a content life in your punishment is you don't get to go anywhere and now you're trapped in my awful apartment, you know, kind of a fucking loser ghost. Are you weighing when you out there looking up women's skirts and we get gay ghost, why don't you go fucking float over to Wa West, uh, west splitting a dudes over there, you know, he'll get their balls.

Speaker 9:          01:20:14       I know what I'm talking about here. All right. Um, anyways, he said my girlfriend is obsessed with that show. Goes Hunter Hunter hunters. And I find it ridiculous. Uh, yeah, I find that shows that shows it's fucking stupid. It's all all in the editing and they act like they're going to find something and they don't, and they never quite get like a good angle on the ghost. You know? It's like if you had a good angle on the ghost, you would kept the footage and you would have just could've sold it to any network out there for millions of dollars. We finally have proof that goes to exist, but they never do it. So we shaky handheld. Blair witch. All right. Question number eight. Um, bill doing sets every week, do you ever get bored of your own stories? Jesus Christ? Yes, absolutely. Which is Wa and thank God I do.

Speaker 9:          01:21:03       If I didn't, I would never write any new jokes. Absolutely. Absolutely. And what ends up happening is if it's a seven minute joke, it becomes a five minute joke. It becomes a two minute joke and then it just becomes a joke that disappears. It's kind of like, you know, you have it like break your arm or something and someone's like, dude, what happened to your arm? And you tell the first person you tell in total detail what happened to your arm and it takes like fucking 10 minutes. The next guy you tell, you start telling again, you can fuck you going over the same shit again, becomes eight minutes and then the very end, it's just what happened? How I'm doing, I fucking fell down and go fuck yourself. What do you think happened? It bent in a way it wasn't supposed to bend in a broke.

Speaker 9:          01:21:43       All right, what happened to your face? All right, question number nine. How far into this podcast all we, how many moms funny. Shorten these things because they're getting ridiculously long. 41 minutes. Jesus Christ. I should sell cds at the end of this. All right, question number nine, and I'm going to wrap this up real quick. Um, Bill, are there any movies that you, that you know are God awful, but for whatever reason you love them anyways? Oh, I like this. This is a, this is a good story here. Listen to this shit. He says for me, it's John Claude van Damme bloodsport and kickboxer reason being is as about nine or 10 when those movies came out and they were the first movies, my dad let me stay up and watch with them even though my mom disapproved and I saw kickboxer for the first time in a while the other day and it really might be one of the worst movies of all time, especially the power van Damme gets punched square in the face about 15 times and rapid succession at the end of the round.

Speaker 9:          01:22:43       And at the end of the round, the bad guy tells van dam that he fucked his girlfriend at which point vent damn spends the rest of a in between rounds demanding to know the truth about his new girlfriend. He says, if I were in the middle of a fight with a grand champion of underground death matches, would you actually give a shit at point who some girl you met two weeks ago. Fuck exactly. And I'll never forget the part with a bad vet. Bad Guy's boss finally gets what's coming to him because my dad would always be going and take that you Cambodian son of a bitch. I don't even think the guy was supposed to be Cambodian, but I, if I see them, movie's going to be on, on Cinemax 20 years from now. Still sit down and watch it. Yeah, I got movies like that.

Speaker 9:          01:23:30       Um, I think I already talked about this one airport, 1975 if he ever get a chance to watch that movie, that's the movie that basically the movie airplane was making fun of, I believe. And believe it or not, air as funny as the movie airplane is airport 1975 is even funnier. Just to give you a quick recap of what the store, what it is. It's a commercial airliner. You know, some guys in a private plane, he has a heart attack and has a head on collision with like a DC 10, which sucks one of the pilots out of the front and blinds Efram Zimbalist Jr at which point a stewardess who I swear to God has a lazy eye, has to fly the fucking plane and it stars and unknown Erik Estrada, who plays the character of I believe heck door and has one line in it. It's that fucking good.

Speaker 9:          01:24:23       All right, what am I going to end with here? Um, let's end with a wishing all you guys are merry Christmas. So, because you know, you're Jewish, had a happy Hanukkah. Um, if your a, is it just black only black people or is it African Kwanza Happy Kwanza curation? I Dunno what you do there. Uh, oh, Jewish people, uh, have Dolby up excellent Chinese food on Christmas Day. I learned that little, uh, that little tradition the other day. Oh, here's a question I have for any, any, you technically savvy guys out here cause I really want to up the quality of these podcasts. People keep talking about this tapping, wait a minute. Is it, is it this noise? Is that the noise?

Speaker 9:          01:25:09       If that's the noise. Yeah, that's me scrolling down on my computer. I think we solved it. Um, son of a bitch anyways, so I want to up the uh, the quality. So let me know if that's the tapping sound because some people were saying it was my last saying I left like Popeye in and annoyed them or is it this, is that really annoying you guys? Anyways, this is my question. I saw something, I was listening to a, what's his face? Little Stephens underground Christmas. If you guys ever listened to his show, it's on Sunday nights. Checkout locally. He's just said please on this underground music plays great music and I love the way he talks. Lou Stevens underground Christmas, we got the remote moves. I can't even do what he's just fucking the coolest dude ever. But anyways, he was talking about this shit on there called the uh, the Olympus ls 10 and evidently it's this fucking unbelievable recording record.

Speaker 9:          01:26:07       12 hours with a shit on it. Bands can use it. Like that's how much quality is that. You can just set it in the middle of the room and it picks up everything. Like that cheesy guitar playing that you heard at the beginning of this, you could have really told how awful it was. If I get one of these devices and any tech geeks out there, I want to know if this thing is worth it. The ls 10 if I start recording my podcasts on this, then uploading them. It's really adding in whole extra step to the process. But I would like to, you know, I'm getting a ton of listeners, I'm not going to lie to you, the podcast that kind of starting to blow up. You know, I think I'm in a triple digits at this point. I don't even joke in San, only have 14 listeners, but I really think I got a, I think I have about 106 at this point.

Speaker 9:          01:26:50       So I'm gonna we're going to try to, well, you know, try to up the quality here in 2009. Um, and with that I got an idea. How about for next week's podcast? You guys send me in some New Year's resolutions. How are you going to turn your lives around you now you do this every year. You lie to yourself, you're going to make your life a little bit better. You know, send me those in. And with that I'm going to end this podcast here. I'm going to, well actually hype a couple of dates I have coming up. Um, all right, this is the big one. Um, at the Improv and Tampa, Florida and I, last time I was there, you know, I dunno, I didn't do so well as far as drawing people. I know it's kind of off the beaten path down there in Tampa. Maybe the hangover a year.

Speaker 9:          01:27:38       Fucking devil rays, which kicked the shit out of my red sox while we took you to seven games that you guys are definitely the better team. Maybe you guys, you know, the lightening aren't doing so well, that kind of an okay team come out to one of my shows is what I'm saying. January 8th, ninth, 10th. If you saw my uh, last hour special, I wrote well brand new hour of stuff and I'm also going to be at the Improv and Houston, Texas on January 22nd through the 24th. And then I'm making a hometown stop in Boston at the Wilbur theater on February the sixth. I really hope you guys can come out. Um, I'm going to be really rested up over the holidays, so I'm going to be extra funny. I guaran fucking tee it and uh, and that is it. I didn't quite get a chance to get to some of this shit.

Speaker 9:          01:28:27       I got a couple of Nice reviews on my podcast here. This is all garbage time. You don't even have to listen to this ship it. Here's a couple of Nice reviews I got. And then I have another one, another segment that I like to call it back down to earth where somebody trashes me. So here we go. Here's a couple of Nice one. Um, thanks for making me laugh all day long. I just finished listening to all of your podcast. How the fuck did you do that? I'm trying to get my wife to listen to them, but she doesn't think it's as funny as I think they are. Anytime I have my headphones on and I'm laughing, she says, are you listening to your boyfriend bill? Too Funny. Keep up the great work. Don't you love when fucking women do shit like that? Fuck her that she's jealous.

Speaker 9:          01:29:09       She's jealous that you're year Gig. I, you know what? You should play this part for her. What's her name? Give me your name next week. I'll, I'll have, I'll give her a little talking to, you know, and I'll be nice even though she doesn't think I'm that funny. You know this. Look, if you want to hold on, you know I'm gonna do a right now, sweetheart. If you want to hold onto your boyfriend, he can't suffocate them. All right? If he likes walking around, listening to another man and his headphones, you know us a little gay. I understand that. You know, he's got in touch with his feminine side. All right? But what you need to do is you need to be an adult here, okay? You have to understand that no matter how stupid you think it is, it's one of his hobbies. And you have to respect that.

Speaker 9:          01:29:49       Okay? Don't do what Jennifer Lopez did to Ben Affleck during their year and a half relationship. What are you going to do? Dress him up like a little Ken doll. Stick him in a Tuxedo. Huh? He can walk around smiling, pretending he's happy and everybody sees the misery behind his eyes, you know? And then one day, you know, you just, he's just, I don't know, you just see him crouched over in front of his laptop looking at porn or just something, something awful and you're gonna blame him. You're going to blame his childhood. You know what? It's you lady. All right. So why don't you back off during the holidays. Okay? All right, next one. Hey Bill. I think your podcast should come with the public service disclaimer. Since I fly a lot, I catch up on your podcasts during flights. I get such a kick out of this that people are actually downloading these things and listening to them.

Speaker 9:          01:30:38       It's just really cool. And so anyways, on a plane and he says, I sat next to this older lady during a recent flight back from Portland. It was your podcast about chips and the 20 car pile ups. I was frigging laughing so hard. I couldn't breathe. I thought I was going to be escorted off the flight by air marshals. This poor lady must've thought I was a some psycho. All right. So yeah. That's awesome. That makes me feel good. Next one. One more good one. And then I'm going to bring myself back down to earth with somebody who trashed me. All right, Bill. Then yesterday, uh, it was the same one. Yes. That was with my older daughter and we were listening in the car. This was a podcast about being a boxer and reacting to punches by shrugging your shoulders and turning your head.

Speaker 9:          01:31:20       I, yeah, that's how I react to when somebody tries to punch me in the face. I don't try to slip the punch. I just bring my shoulders up to ear level and then I turned my head away to, I never want to fight anyways. He said, uh, we were both crying and gasping for air. I could barely see the car in front of me. Good God. Warn people they should not be in public, uh, or operating heavy machinery when listening. All right, so that's the good review section. Now here is the back down to earth section of the podcast. Bill, glad to see you've been working on, you're reading out loud skills. You sound like a special ed kid that didn't bother getting out of the short bus when it arrived at school. I wonder how many times you've been in public places reading out the podcast questions into your phone and people have walked by and thought, oh, how nice.

Speaker 9:          01:32:11       The mentally challenged man over there is learning to read. I guess he's really coming along because he, he's only sounding out every other word. You know what's great about that? Not only is that absolutely correct, I actually had difficulty reading out loud. The thing that he said, insulting me, saying I can't read out loud. Well, to shade, to shade at Buddy. Um, anyways, happy holidays everybody. Merry Christmas, happy Hanukkah, happy Kwanzaa. And if you don't celebrate any of it, I hope you have a good break. While the rest of us are spending money on people that we resent on some level, um, that is it. Um, let me know your New Year's resolutions. Please keep the podcast questions coming and I hope in January I can have some sort of update on my European tour that I'm going to be doing, um, next year. So for my seven listeners in the UK, um, I dunno if you guys celebrate. You guys have Jesus over there. I know you have Mcdonald's. All right. God bless. Take it easy. Talk to you next Monday.

Speaker 6:          01:33:24       Maybe somewhere down the road, maybe somewhere down the road with car. I'm just glad to be of your dad.
