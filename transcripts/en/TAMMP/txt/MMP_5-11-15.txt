Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? Is Bill burn is the Monday morning podcast for Monday, May 11th, 2015. What's going on out? Why? Yeah. Um, I'm out here in Boston and I am for shows into my, uh, 19 show run here at the Wilbur theater. Uh, having a good time so far, running into a bunch of people I went to high school with, worked with. I had a, I had a math teacher from ninth grade. He showed up, you know, Algebra, Algebra, my Algebra teacher, you know, and I remember that year you was supposed to get a, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:00:40       okay,

Speaker 2:          00:00:40       well shit, you needed a 70. That's what you needed. You needed a fucking 70, just like my helicopter tests needed a 70 to pass in order to go on to geometry, more math that I was never going to use in my life because I was not going to be an engineer. I had no idea what geometry was when I took it. Nobody ever told me they just fucking, you just showed up and they just started, you know, you had to memorize paragraphs about shapes. The puck Phi Fag. Urie I'm theorem or some shit like that, right. Opposite angles are congruent number, all of that number of, I don't even know if it's like that for you youngsters out there, you fucking youngsters.

Speaker 1:          00:01:22       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:01:23       But the way that they go into math, and you can tell right now that I didn't get the seven, um, the way that they go into math in fucking high school, it's absolutely ridiculous because up until then, you know, it's one plus one is two, two times two is four. Four divided by two is toe. It's all fucking numbers, right? And then all of a sudden you get to your, your fresh release. I did, I got to my freshman year. Um, you know, sure. If you're from Asia, you got to this and the fourth grade. But I'm a white guy. I got to it in the ninth grade. Okay. I got a regular road, fucking meat and potatoes, little stewed carrot fucking brain. I can't help it. All right. My ancestors boiled the food. There was no nutrients in it. And as the result, I'm five years behind an entire continent. Evidently everything. How great it is that we have nuclear weapons so we can actually bullied people into actually thinking that we're an intellectual factor. You know what I mean? I mean, seriously, if we actually, if the world was like a fucking sat test, we really would not be doing well.

Speaker 2:          00:02:42       Oh yeah. I'm dragging my whole country down with my stupidity. That's how fucking arrogant I am. It can't just be like, hey bill, you ever think that maybe you're a fucking moron who should've hit the books a little bit harder? No, no. I don't think that. I think I'll, I think I'll blame my whole country. I'll blame the whole school system. That's what you do, right? That's what you do as a parent. Now, when you have a little cunty kid who needs a swift kick in his little Oshkosh, but gosh, fucking stupid. Oh, aren't those adorable overalls? Oh, the overalls are adorable. That little fucking monster in them. You know who's never been told he's wrong his entire life. And then he's special, right? That fucker right there. And he's the pacifier slapped out of his fucking face and sorry, losing my voice already. Hey, I'm losing my voice already.

Speaker 2:          00:03:26       You know, I got another fucking 20 shoes to do. Um, as, it'd be funny thing to say to some parent, excuse me, Miss, if you don't get that kid under control, I'm going to slap the past if right out of his mouth is not illegal to say that. That's what's funny. It's just not, everybody has like a cell phone camera and then they would fill you like fill your film you while you did it, and then they would do the provocative to try to get you to watch the video. I was sitting on a park bench having a great time with my toddler and I never expected that. Or then you won't believe what happened next. Then they would just cut to me a lady, if you don't shut that kid up, I'm going to slap the pacifier out of his mouth and then everybody would come me, right.

Speaker 2:          00:04:09       They come at me like I was the next Mussolini, you know, never, never once, just going like, Hey, wait a minute. The video kind of started with him threatening that child. You know what I mean? Threatening the mother, uh, you know, to do fucking violence to the kid. That's where it started. Like what happened before that, you know, that's what they never, they never had that part in the video. They never had what happened before. It's always escalate. Just starts with somebody slapping a pacifier out of somebody's mouth, you know, and admitted like I watched those videos and I go, hey, come on man. You know, at least wait til the kids like four. Right. But these fucking videos, it's always starts like right there. It's like what happened right before that,

Speaker 3:          00:04:55       you know,

Speaker 2:          00:04:57       for all you know, that's like a video shoot and the person's read enough like a cute card. Oh, you hear that hammering? I've been hearing that since seven in the fucking morning. Yup. I mean you go, cause I'm fucking stay in with the beautiful mind right now. Fucking add out to fucking up to God damn trees. You know, there's one thing that's funny. People really talk about that fucking Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang. I've been hearing that since seven in the morning.

Speaker 3:          00:05:27       Yeah. That fucking

Speaker 2:          00:05:30       just laying here seven in the morning and I'm fucking

Speaker 3:          00:05:36       okay

Speaker 2:          00:05:36       as well here. Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang. Right. And it's making me have all these fucking weird dreams. I had this one dream,

Speaker 3:          00:05:45       you know,

Speaker 2:          00:05:47       because that hammering that fucking hammer rag

Speaker 2:          00:05:52       woke me up at seven in the morning. My first words, my first words today, where are you? Are you fucking serious? That's how I woke up. Now you know it's going to be a raw taste. Gonna be a rough one. That's the first fucking thing. And I just, you know, I was going to wait till the fucking, you know, you know the newspapers on the fucking deck would done and you know, reading it and trying to figure it out. But I figured, you know, fuck that. I'm just going to do the podcast while the hammer is going on. I got other shit to do fucking so I got a deal with it means you got to deal with it. They get that one in. I'll go ahead now he's got to go cut another one. So we've got a nice fucking 10. Oh No,

Speaker 2:          00:06:34       there it is. Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap. Um, Jesus fucking Christ you fucking times. You got to hit it before Ted. Um, anyways, so it was causing me to have all these fucked up dreams. I had this fucking dream that me and Nia split up. I didn't realize it in the dream. I knew I, I dunno when I was out drinking with some other comics who I don't even know who they are and the dream and I woke up the next day, they like, dude, what? You know what the fuck happened to you last night? And I was like, what do you mean what do you mean is like you were doing the chicken dance with that check? And I was like, uh, I don't remember. I vaguely remember doing it and I was embarrassed. I don't know what the chicken dance is either. That's the weird part about this dream. And then all of a sudden I was just in this relationship with this fucking woman who I didn't want to be with and she had this weird look on her face and she was walking weird. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:07:37       She had like blonde hair. She had a weird look on her face and it was like she was walking the whole fucking thing. I was going to, what am I? What did I do? I broke up with me and I got what? This, she's walking weird and we're doing the chicken dance. I want to get out of here now all of that came from that fucking hammering. I had that thing and then I had another dream. I was pulling up to some department store in the hood for some fucking reason cause I wanted to shop right. And these guys going, hey man, why don't you just park right here? Why don't you park? You know I parked in the spot and then they came up, they said all this, this spots for our church. Why don't you go park down the street? Oh, we'll do it.

Speaker 2:          00:08:13       We'll pocket. I was like, dude, I'm not giving you my keys. And the next thing, no one of them was in the car and I was outside the car, my cake, you know, give me the fucking keys back. Right. So I go into this Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam. So then I fucking go into the department store. No, Jesus Christ. It's the same fucking nail. That's what kills me. Funny if I go down there and he's banging his head against the wall, trying to get all the voices out of there. Um, so I fucking, uh, I go into the department store and it's just a shitty ass place and just like washers and dryers and stuff. And then all of a sudden like five of them come in and they go, uh, a, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:08:59       you know, we've got to move your car or something like that, but blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. You know, gimme the keys and I'll go, I'm not giving you the keys. And they go, why? I go, cause I'm not the white guy from def jam. Like, Oh, okay, here you go. Here's my fucking keys. Go move. The car, I'm not moving the fucking car. And then I saw this whole part of the store that, and then they go though, you didn't have to buy anything here. And I go, and these are all good and all this fucking stores sucks. And then they showed the bar, all the good clothes where I was, I call it shows up. This fucking store is actually good. I know it's a fucked up dream, but I got hammered in my head is just as I'm sure I've done dreaming here. So I ended up going out and my car's gone. I walked down the street to where it is and they'd fucked up the fender. Now I'm driving away. No, I got in it and somebody came up with a gun, was trying to rob me.

Speaker 2:          00:09:46       I remember I just said, go fuck yourself. And now when I was walking away and there was like this Asian cop, I swear to God would like the Baltimore riots playing on a TV or something. I don't know why I had this dream. Right. I'm fucking walking out and this Asian cop, I'm going, you see these guys, when you going to, they're going to fucking shoot me. And he said something even like this fish sandwich. And it was just like, yeah, you know I can't fucking help Ya. Ya know, we had the white shirt on, you know the fucking police chief. He was just like, yeah, you know, I can't help you out. And then they were saying they were going to follow me and I said, I, I said that I didn't give a fuck. Go Fuck Yourself. And then I was on sunset boulevard and I drove home to a different house and then I walked up, I woke up and I had a fantasy about having ridiculous security and I popped up on that gps screen and all their fucking phones as they were pulling up the street. And I just yelled at him with his goats head on set. I was in the Illuminati and they got scared and they left. That's my morning. This is what happens when you wake up to hammering.

Speaker 2:          00:10:52       I don't know what any of that means, but I got to tell you, it's fucked up as a second. Dream was the first one was scarier.

Speaker 1:          00:10:58       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:10:59       Jesus Christ. Even in my dream. Why don't I just say, Hey, you know, I'm sure you're a lovely person to somebody else, but not to me. I don't want to be in this anymore.

Speaker 1:          00:11:09       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:11:10       All right. It is you and it's me. That's my new one. Instead it, it's not you. It's me. It's not me. It's you. It is me. And it's you. All right? It's fucking everybody. Thanks to you. It's not working for all of us. The ununited way. Um, so anyways, um, you know, I'm thinking about this fucking add shit coming from a family where everybody sort of has it a little bit to different degrees, you know what I mean? Which just causes you to constantly be going in a different direction every five seconds and all that type of stuff. I've actually made peace with it and I don't, I don't think it's really a big deal.

Speaker 1:          00:11:48       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:11:48       I just really sat down and I thought about it, you know, as they're trying to put you on medication in my wife one time I was just going like, you know, they got stuff, you know, kind of takes the edge off, fucking chills you out a little bit. And I was like, Hey, you want to your fucking mind, I'm not taking that stuff. The, the fucking FDA doesn't even exist anymore. It's full of a bunch of people who used to work for drug companies. You've got the nuts run in the nuthouse. I'm not sticking anything in my fucking body other than aspirin. Anything that wasn't made pre 1960s, I'm not sticking it in that unless I have a terminal disease. And at that point who gives a fuck? I'll try anything.

Speaker 3:          00:12:21       Um, so

Speaker 2:          00:12:25       I actually had this conversation with them go. Do you ever think that having add is actually natural? I mean, I was born that way.

Speaker 2:          00:12:33       You know, for you to sit there and like they have the way that they demonize that. Oh, people, they have problems focusing and they can't do well in school. Who gives a fuck? I didn't do well in school. I did great in life though. You know what I mean? The with the fucking schools in most jobs is what they want you to do. They want you to not be thinking, don't be fucking going all over the place. And they were like, oh focus on this job. Focus. Focus on what job is. Mind numbing. Fucking horseshit. That's not fulfilling me on any God damn level stack of spreadsheets. Do you think I fucking laid in bed as a child and that's what I thought about when I dreamed someday. Oh, some day. What are you going to be Billy? He's going to be an astronaut. You want to play baseball?

Speaker 3:          00:13:12       No, no.

Speaker 2:          00:13:15       I want, I want to stack of spreadsheets and here's the thing. There's some people that are fucking into that and it gets their juices going. Those are the people should be doing that job. I got to meet with this fucking pilot shit. I had no idea how much I was into reading charts and graphs and stuff and like the temperature dewpoint and that whole fucking formula rights, subtract attempt that do point from the temperature divide by Paul 4.4 and then multiplied by a thousand I thought I'd hate that shit. I fucking loved it. Once I got it down and I started getting the right answers and I really started thinking about the genius of the House, somebody actually came up with that got my fucking brain going and I loved it. You know what I mean? Which brings me back to fucking math and high school,

Speaker 3:          00:13:57       right?

Speaker 2:          00:13:58       Math in high school, how all of that shit is fucking unbelievable. They basically beginning to make you, the math that you learned in high school, at least in my fucking country is they're making you like a junior member of the free masons. You know you're starting to learn the secrets of the universe with that math. Now, if they fucking said that to start it out and you know, fucking motivated, I would have been

Speaker 2:          00:14:26       this, this math that you're now going to embark on that shit. Then we fucking taught IA for the first eight years. Okay. That's just, you know, that's just when you go down the street, you buy a loaf of bread, you make sure they give you the right amount of change. Okay. Now this shit I should have been up there wearing like some fucking, you know, secret society robe dimming the lights with a flashlight under his chin. Right? Just to kick it off and just be like these, these formulas we about to show you showing like a video of like the fucking big bang and the solar system and all that shit be in made the math you'll about to embark on all the mysteries of the world up until this point, the mysteries that we have unraveled the answers to all of these mysteries will now be at your fingertips.

Speaker 2:          00:15:23       It'll be in your mind. They, oh yeah, you're so right. I would've fucking ace that class. He just fucking walk in day one and you write the name on the board and you start throwing the alphabet in words and with numbers, you know? Oh freckles in the back of the class. I just shut down. I was like, I won't put the fuck is this, what is this? I don't get this. I feel stupid. I know I'm going to make the people around me laugh. So I needed as a 70, I needed to 70 to get through this motherfucker. Right. And I ended up getting like a 68 and I was a Douche to the teacher all year. Bad move, bad move when I'm coming up there with my lack of a hat in my freckled hands and uh, I'd like to 68 or 69. I was right there and he didn't give it to me and uh, and I went to summer school and I was just like, Oh man, this summer it's going to suck.

Speaker 2:          00:16:16       I had two weeks off and then immediately I was fucking back in, into, uh, into summer school. And then I got to summer school and immediately it was the best time I have a fucking had in my life because summer school is filled with a bunch of class clowns, musicians, artistic people, people with fucking add and people who fucking hate authority. It was, it was one of the great classes I had ever been in. They did this. I'm at, you know, I thought I was funny. I got to those classes. I was, I wasn't even, I kept my mouth shut. I couldn't even keep up with the level of funny that was in those fucking classes. And uh, and then just the balls that the kids had truly found kids that didn't give a fuck. It's probably the bad crowd, but you know something if, if you take what you learn in that with that attitude, if you apply it to the right areas of life, um, it actually can work for you.

Speaker 2:          00:17:13       Be apply it to the wrong areas. He ended up in jail. So you know, you got to kind of navigate those fucking waters, you know, if you know, if your natural reaction to somebody coming in going, can I can settle down, can I have your attention? Please. If you're natural reaction is fuck this guy. That's not exactly a bad thing. You know what I mean? It's not actually a good thing either. You just got to know when you got to know when to say, fuck this guy. Oh, who is this guy? Or Why am I listening to this guy? I think you should always think, why am I listening to this person? Unless you know you're on some hike through the forest and you with some God damn ranger and there's a grizzly bear. And he turns around and it'd be like, okay, listen, this is really critical.

Speaker 2:          00:17:56       You know? Then you listen. You know, it'd be like, who the fuck are you to tell me Dude? I know it's a fucking bear. Um, so anyways, that fucking a Dee Dee shit. If you have a date date, don't let him put you on fucking medicine. I'm really going like, goes, it's Suzanne Somers that got in trouble. It was one of those Blondie's. It was the chick from the MTV thing, right. She said a bunch of stuff where she, you know, didn't really do her homework. Um, what was it on? Um, um, autistic kids. All right. Oh, is it Tom Cruise talking about psychology? I think I'm doing this right now. You know what's that? The phone ringing a Jesus. There's the phone phones ring and once the hammer and stopped, then the phone goes thousand one one, 1002, 1003 1000 rings. Come on, give me four over under, I say six before it's picked up.

Speaker 3:          00:18:54       Come on. Five.

I'm gonna wait till this is done. This, there's somebody downstairs sitting right next to the phone too. That's the funny thing. Anyways. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:19:23       yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:19:25       Oh, fucking add thing where it's just like, all right. You gotta look you gotta you know, you need to calm down.

I love all you guys too, that show those text messages, like it's damning information. I can't tell what they're talking about definitively and neither can you. All of this would be laughed out of court. But the thing is, this isn't a court, it's a corporation.

Speaker 2:          00:25:25       And what they really, what corporations really give a shit about is the opinion of the base level. Mouth Breathe and fucking moron. Because that's the guy you get the most fucking money out of. That's the dope that shows up to the game, dressed, wearing everything but helmets and cleats goes down to the pro shop and buys all this stuff and paints his fucking face. Moron. Fucking mole. New booger. Biggest Fan. Oh look at me. I'm a fireman. Put me on your shoulders. Even eat fucking woke up. Even he woke up after a while. So this is fucking stupid. It's not worth it. But those are the people. Those are the same people that call in sports talk radio and all that. The fucking NFL is going to base. Maybe he could have probably, but we can't prove it. Report is they're going to base the suspension on the crowd's reaction, the base level, mouth breathe, moron.

Speaker 2:          00:26:19       So basically if you make enough fucking noise, they're going to suspend this guy for absolutely fucking nothing. You know, I don't know if he knew. I don't know if he didn't know. And that's to say, everybody can say the same thing, but I can tell you this, he what he, what he did, if he even fucking know is, is the, it's the equivalent of fucking, he played with a hockey stick with too big a curve on it for about a period and a half. And then after that with the regulation stick scored 50 fucking goals. But you're going to be like, oh no, now fuck his whole career. And all that comes down to is you fucking cunts hate the Patriots. And you hate the fact that they're fucking winning. It's the dumbest shit ever. And I'll tell you this though, but at, this is what you're gonna do.

Speaker 2:          00:27:03       If this, if this is the standard that you want, okay, I will go with it. And you can call Brady had cheater in the Patriots to cheer, but then we're going to go through the whole fucking league. And this is just the shit that I know cause I've got shift from some fucking Steeler fan. Right. And I'm like really? Well if we're just going to go on circumstantial evidence, uh, you have a sex offender at, at the QB precision two times sex offender that we know of at the QB position and also Terry Bradshaw admitted to doing steroids along with a bunch of other Steelers in the 70s. So you're no longer six Berg, you're fucking two time, two t two times sex offender, two time super bowl champion Berg. You want that? What about Jerry Rice who admitted after his career that he used to stick them?

Speaker 2:          00:27:49       That wasn't quite legal. It wasn't fucking legal. So they had gone, what did he went three titles with the 40 niners though is the route and the 40 niners are all cheaters. You can go around the fucking league. This, this shit in the league that you don't even fucking, there's been no evidence. You know why there's no evidence is because the other team, that loss was never such a fucking pussy like Jim or say that they launched an investigation. Do you think that you can't do this to every fucking team on every game? If you looked under every fucking jock strap, you wouldn't find something. Let's look at the Dallas cowboys in the early nineties their head coach was Jimmy Johnson Bank Bank, bank bank, bank bank, Jimmy Johnson from the University of fucking Miami. Okay. Basically a low security federal fucking prison. That's what their football program was when he was running it.

Speaker 2:          00:28:40       Then he goes to dad, The Dallas Cowboys, Aka a coq 10 slash whorehouse of a fucking franchise. Their owner has a face lift. His face, his ally, his face is cheating right out of the gate. The first thing you fuck, you're telling me if he didn't look under a couple of those cheerleaders skirts, you wouldn't have found something. Give me a fucking break. I'll tell you right. If this guy gets fucking suspended, this is an absolute God damn fucking travesty that you're going to do this tar and feather, one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time and arguably the greatest head coach of all time with this country fucking pussy. Shit. I, I can't, I, I, I don't even, I think I won't watch professional football. I'm just going to watch college football this year. If this is what happens if, because of a bunch of fucking sore losers and mouth breathing, fucking morons complain enough.

Speaker 2:          00:29:31       I swear to God, I really think it's because all that ray rice shit, you know what I mean? Or they didn't get a rug. We've got to get it right. Ray Rice knocks out his fiance and the guy I two two games, two game suspension. Why don't you cool it out there? Uh, you know, uh, you know, come on man, we can't have this. We can't, you know, they fucking talk to him like Henry Hill when he had his Goumarre, you know, they came over it. Come on, you've got to go back to your wife. Okay. We can't have this. This is ridiculous. All right, come on. You can't be standing over here. He got to go back to Karen. That's how they treated them, right? Then all of a sudden the video came out and they were like, oh, wait a minute. We, uh, we met. Uh, we don't tolerate that and, uh, get out of the league, get out of the league because we're so fucking pure, right?

Speaker 2:          00:30:12       It's all fucking bullshit. It's all bullshit. Right? And then fucking, uh, then what happens is God damn fiance, who should have left the guy, you know, that's probably it. That's probably grounds to be like, you know, this really isn't what I'm looking for in a relationship. She goes, but she forgives the guy. Why did she forgive him? Because he gave the apology or the fucking university because he makes a zillion dollars a fucking year. Do you think of Ray Rice was working at Midas Muffler? The forgive this happens. I don't think it does. Coming home. Everyday smell and like fucking exhaust. I don't think it does. It's all bullshit.

Speaker 2:          00:30:47       That stupid pink shit that they make an a zillion dollars off of. You guys go out and buy that fucking those Pink Jersey and you seem to think you're helping out cause your grandmother died a fucking breast cancer and you find that like one half of one half of one fucking percent actually goes to the cause to raise awareness, not even to fight the disease. And the rest goes into these fucking owner's pockets. Do you see that shit about the troops? Whenever the advertise with the fucking, uh, the flag and all that you thinking, wow. The NFL supporting the troops. The military's got to pay for that. You guys are talking about a container out of a fucking ball. So we said this weekend said if he actually did it, he should have just said like, yeah man, I like that. That's what the fuck I like him at. Gives me a little better field, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:31:31       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:31:31       I didn't think it was that big a deal. And then you combine that with the fact that ESPN did the study and showed it was actually a disadvantage.

Speaker 2:          00:31:40       And you combine it with the fact that when he had the regulation fucking ball, he scored each keep fucking killed him even worse. So fucking witch hunt, you tar and feather on this guy and you know what? Go ahead and fucking do it. Cause that's what sports fans do. It's like New York sports fans, New York sports fans, you know, all they bring up when they talked to Boston fans, uh, the two giant victories over the patriots so you couldn't beat the giants. Doe Cook does still bringing that shit up. You know, it's like, I don't even bring up the fucking oh four Yankees. Do I do that? Do I bring up, uh, you know, oh the fucking Celtics got 17 championships. Do I fucking, the only time I ever do that is if a Knicks fan comes up to me. It gives me fucking shit. Fucking New York fence sitting there ignoring, hanging their hats on to fucking wins in fucking ignoring the absolute carnage, the roadkill, this sports roadkill of the other fucking eight teams, the other 18 in your fucking state roadkill fucking roadkill to the point. They shouldn't even be there in a fucking league.

Speaker 1:          00:32:44       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:32:44       Horrific. Absolutely fucking horrific. And even your crown jewel, the Yankees, they blew a three games to none leagues. Even. They've got a fucking big sploosh of mud in their face. Fucking unreal. I'm fucking real. I got to listen to oversee all fucking week this week talking about how to tell him Boston fans, how the fucking giants beat the fucking patriots. It's just like, it really, I've always still talking about the fucking whatever. Hey, you know what good for you. Good on you. Did you went to what we want for while winning three world series, a Stanley Cup in an NBA championship with four teams. I will take that. I'll take those two losses all fucking day long. All Day long. But anyways, so this past Thursday, so I was fucking rag and about this Brady shit as I just as I just did and I don't want to hear anybody giving me any shit about that. It continued to talk about this cause you cause, uh, continuing to talk about it on the other side. Tar and feather in my fucking guy. So I'm going to stick up for him here. Um, so anyways, other than the Brady thing, last Thursday,

Speaker 2:          00:33:42       the fucking lightning were up three games to none against the Canadians. And the fucking capital's were up three games to one against the New York rangers and all I was thinking as well, at least before that was thinking all right, well if the rangers, Canadians, when they play each other, so they're gonna knock one of them out. So now I'm down to just one. Um, you know, and then hopefully the ducks are the Blackhawks. We'll finish them off, right? But all of a sudden it looked like Tampa Bay was going to win and the capital's we're going to fucking win.

Speaker 1:          00:34:09       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:34:10       You know, and, and they will, they, they were going to get done away with in the sammies. Oh, I don't want it made me feel great. And then what happens? Canadians win game four. Alright, did the Canadian, so you got that fucking pride that got that tradition. You think you're going to sweep us? Go Fuck Yourself. All right, come on Tampa. Finish them off from five. They fucking win game five. Well they have to game six right now. So Games six is tonight game six, six tonight. And I'm going to tell you right now, Tampa,

Speaker 1:          00:34:39       yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:34:40       I swear to God. Eisenman's gotta be down there. He's got to go down there. He's got to give him a speech because if they lose, this one is fucking over. You can never say it's over, but it is fucking over.

Speaker 1:          00:34:50       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:34:52       And I actually think, I think

Speaker 2:          00:34:55       I'm rooting for the capitals, but I think the range of series is over. I think it's fucking over the fucking goddamn capital's man. They just can't get over the hump. You know? You know what's funny? It was, I really agreed when they got rid of their fucking coach there. I didn't think he was the right guy. Uh, I can't remember his name. It gives a B now he's with the ducks. Guess I was wrong. Huh? They're looking like the favorites. So anyways, it's, it's actually going to be a, I think we're probably going to be looking at to games seven. Um, you know, as much as I root against the fucking Canadians in the rangers, it's actually exciting to watch a team come back like that. And uh, and then also it's fucking extra hockey.

Speaker 1:          00:35:31       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:35:32       You know, so it was kind of a win win. They either fucking dispose of them quickly or I get to watch more playoff games, you know, God knows I got the time. It's a Bruins fan. God knows I got the fucking time. Um, so anyways, uh, I'm in the middle of this run here in Boston, which is really a fucking amazing thing and I want to thank everybody who has come out so far. I'm, I'm really not taking this, uh, this week lately. You know, this means a lot to me that all these shows were added and everybody comes out and uh, and it's really cool. Then I basically, I started my career 23 years ago right across the street, or actually right across the street now as the w hotel, but he used to be an empty parking lot and uh, you could actually see Nick's comedy stop.

Speaker 2:          00:36:18       It was great. They had this, they still have the sign and it lights up. It's just blocked by the hotel now. See, can't fucking see it. And they're actually down to only two shows a week, which kind of makes me sad, but I got to tell you, I'm like one of the few guys I know that the original place where I started, um, actually, uh, still exists and is doing comedy. That's pretty good. 23 years. And, and uh, I tell you, I did so much stand up in this fucking state, you know, it was mother's Day yesterday, happy mother's Day to all the mothers and uh, took my mom out to brunch and all that and mixed up my other relatives and stuff. We all met at this restaurant and I went in there and I was just like, Jesus Christ, I did stand up in this, this space.

Speaker 2:          00:37:01       It wasn't this restaurant, but it was something else like fucking 20 years ago. And then the place right next to it used to be like a ground round or a Spaghetti Freddy's or something like that. And I used to do stand up in the basement of that. Um, all these fucking memories coming back. Um, you know, great memories. Some sad, you know, I always think about Patrice when I come back here. He still, he's fucking, I used to swing by, uh, you know, I'd go blue hill lab and I would turn, he lived down on, uh, where did they live? On Seaver street in West Roxbury. I used to go down there and I pick them up. We drive over. No did, I used to pick him now. He used to go into the clubs and then I'd meet him in at the clubs and at night I'd give him a ride home.

Speaker 2:          00:37:48       And, uh, so just thinking about all of that shit and all the fucking, uh, I don't know, man. It's been, it's been one of those things and not just a bunch of people that I went to high school with and, uh, I've been showing up, which is always great, you know? And, uh, fortunately I had a really, you know, some people, you know, due to the high school, it hit him with fucking great. I didn't, I loved high school, I hated the academic part, but I came a really good, cool grade. And fortunately everybody I've run into is doing really well and they're happy. And what's really cool too is they seen the exact same, I ran into a couple of kids the other night, not even kids now. Shit, we're fucking mid forties and uh, it's crazy. Everyone I run into for my grade, it was just like, you know, 25, 27 years in, some cases have gone by. He just pick up, right where you left off talking about is hey, you know, they got kids, whatever they're doing, and then you just start talking about all the dumb shit that we did. Had a couple buddies of mine come in last night and I'm not going to name the name of the school.

Speaker 1:          00:38:46       Uh,

Speaker 2:          00:38:49       he was, he had this, I'll tell you the quick version of the story. All right? It's the late eighties. Appetite for destruction is just catching on. People are playing the fucking cassette tape. We're at this party to have my psycho friends. One of them's gone now rest his soul. They go to go upstairs, you know, to go to a different party, all right? They both leave fucking 10 minutes later they come back. One of them had a flat top. He had a fucking gash going, like almost like someone tried to parties hair by splitting the scalpel. He's got this fucking four inch Gash on top of his head and the other guy's got a separated shoulder and a fat lip. And we're like, what the fuck happened? They're like, oh, you know, we just walked into this party. We said, hey, is this a party? And they just started beating us up, right?

Speaker 2:          00:39:32       So this fucking mob goes up the Goddamn stairs, right? And uh, we, you know, we're going up the stairs, all drunk, and we hear the party and the biggest psycho out of all of us knocked on the door. And, and the person who knows how it goes, hello? And he goes, hey, excuse me, say a party in here. And the fucking dude opened the door and then it just fucking bedlam. I'll never forget the sound of that. Cause it was all hardwood floors. It was like fucking what appeared to be 20 on 20. Everybody throwing fucking haymakers and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Long story short, the fucking smoke clears and I'm kind of looking over at the people we were fighting and it's like six guys and six women and there's a board game that's fucking all over the place. Uh, we went to the wrong part, right? They were in there playing like risk or something. And then 20 drugs came in, just wasn't 20. It was like, I dunno, it was like eight of us. And uh,

Speaker 2:          00:40:35       I dunno, the real party was upstairs. It was funny. It was the kids upstairs, they actually sued my friends cause what they said happened didn't really fucking happen. So we would talk in about just all of those days, there's so many funny details of some of my friends and I don't want to share them all with you because I'm afraid someone else is going to steal it and put it in a script. Cause there's a couple of details from these guys. First, he's always like, dude, that's fucking hilarious. You've got to put that in something. But, uh, so we were just talking about all those old days and uh, oh my God, that guy got mad at the other guy and he threw a keg right through his fucking windshield. I got arrested for drinking and driving because I was trying to get home to the fucking patriots rams game.

Speaker 2:          00:41:20       That was when I got pulled over and I remember the cop pulled me over and he said, where you coming from? And I said, ah, fuck in Boston. He goes, fucking Boston. You want to get out of the car please? And I play with what a shit show I ever want to have. Fucking was trying to put my finger to my nose. It from fucking eight to 12 went good as far as the arm movement. But when I went 12 to six, it felt like somebody else's hand just came down and slap me in the head and he goes, you want to turn around and face the car and put your arms out and try to stand on one that he was just trying to get me to end the position. He just fucking cuff me. Uh, it was bad. It was bad at a one nine, you know, thought they had the two thought I had the two.

Like, you could answer me on a recording. Alright. Fed Up. Hey, bill saw a great documentary called, fed up. A few things they talked about sounded like stuff you'd mentioned on the podcast. I was wondering if you've seen it. It focuses on the dangers of sugar and the addiction that most Americans have. Definitely check it out if you haven't. Um, no, I've read enough on, I read, I even rent, I mean read a little bit, but I'm mostly watched a bunch of documentaries and, uh, I've pretty much found that there they are. Uh, they're right on. They're very active. I tell you, it's very difficult to try to eat food now that has not been tampered with on some level. And, uh, I try to be empathetic to the people that grow the food. Thinking like, well, you know, if you got to feed 7 billion Goddamn people or whatever, 300 whatever there is in this country though, 300 something million, 400 million, you know, you're gonna need some pesticides.

Speaker 2:          00:45:59       Um, but, um, you know, I'm trying not to talk on my cell phone anymore with it up to my head. I don't go through that airport security with a fucking use that, you know, x Ray light thing that they're using. I don't go through that thing. Um, I just, I don't fuck with any of that stuff. I tried to avoid that as much as I can while all the time drinking way too much and occasionally smoking a cigar. So I'm the typical fucking hypocrite. We're in this room. I am talking holier than now and then in the other room I'm a fucking devil. So I dunno, I, I recommend that people watch that stuff. You just take what you can from it. Uh, maybe you think it's total bullshit and he keep on eating Twix bars and fucking, you know, whatever the fuck else you want to eat.

Speaker 2:          00:46:43       Um, you know, have at it, whatever it, she'll body folding it, whatever you want to do. But I'm not going to be that person wagging your finger going, we need to stop these people. They're poisoning fucking people. You know, I let somebody else do that. Somebody else wants to fucking lead the march down the Goddamn road. I'll, I'll be there. Will I? I don't know. I have no idea. Oh God. Henry Jackson would fucking slapped me in the face with this powdered wig. All right girl with no name. Hey, big balls. Billy. I was in New Orleans for jazz fest last weekend, man. And I met an absolutely gorgeous girl. Wow, that's already a great story. Went to a music festival in of one of the great music cities, probably the best music city in the goddamn country. Relaxed Nashville. Um, and you met a beautiful woman. That's awesome.

Speaker 2:          00:47:29       I like this already. This is a movie I'm watching. The first 10 pages I'm in. Uh, we immediately hit it off last Saturday and had a phenomenal night together in the French quarter. The next day we didn't get, we exchanged numbers and said our goodbyes as she lives in California and I'm in Florida. Oh, this entire, this entire last week. We've been texting nonstop to each other and I'm beginning to fall into the first stages of love with the scale. The problem is I did not remember her name, but she has used mine repeatedly. Ah, fuck dude. We both enjoyed jobs where we have

Speaker 2:          00:48:03       where we traveled quite a bit, so we are planning on having a George Clooney slash vera Farmiga. I Dunno. In up in the air type relationship. We were planning on meeting up in New York, our memorial day week. My problem is I don't know the best way to figure out what her name is. I feel like straight up asking her name at this point would make me come across as a total douche bag and risk jeopardizing the relationship. Dude at that means that some point in the French quarter, you've already forgotten her fucking name. Oh God. Fucking, oh my God. This is making me feel nervous. Also, I am afraid that continuing using pronouns as I have them will get me in trouble sooner than later. When this happened in the past, I would just tell the girl to add me on Facebook to get her name that way. However, I was forced to delete my Facebook account in my previous relationship, a move. I am regretting more and more each day and any help on a suave way, I can attain this girl's name without coming across as a chauvinist asshole. Wouldn't be much appreciated as always. Go Fuck Yourself. Well there's nothing chauvinist. Stick above forgetting the name. Um, and why did you have to delete your account?

Speaker 2:          00:49:18       What happened? Hell hath no fury. What did you do that you do something? Because I would just say, well why don't you just add your account back up again? This is what you should do you have any, I already talked about it on Facebook.

Speaker 1:          00:49:35       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:49:35       Just text her and say, oh no. Yeah, I can't say where. Where's your account? She'd be, it's under my name. MMM. This is what I would do. Oh Jesus. I would add, this is why this isn't what you fucking do. This is what you do. Just create an account under a different name, like your nickname or something stupid, you know, and you can just say like, ah, you know, I just think sometimes he's social network things are a little invasion, an invasion of privacy and just, ah, man, I don't know. This is tricky. She'd be like, well, just add me sound my name. Do you know what my fucking name is? Uh, boy. Um, all right guys, we're going to need some fucking help on this one because I'm failing miserably. You only thing I can think of is get back on fucking Facebook.

Speaker 3:          00:50:34       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:50:52       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:50:52       I really feel at this point that I don't know that you can fucking ask her what her name was. It's too fucking long at this point to ask her what her name is. And also to be honest with you, the fact that he had delete your account, you know, and you've done this before in the past. You sound to me like you kind of out there crushing it. So I really don't feel too, too bad for you. Um, and also you probably just from a couple of details in that, whatever the fuck you did.

Speaker 2:          00:52:03       I can tell you right now, dude, I dunno what the fuck you did, but you're never going to be able to run for political office until you address this part of your life right now, sir. All right. Uh, but other than that, I would try to maybe somehow through fucking Jesus Christ. How do you do it? It'd be fucking drunk. Rummaging through her purse when she goes into use the bathroom.

Speaker 1:          00:52:27       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:52:27       Oh God. You know, I, I would judge you if I hadn't done all of that, you know. All right. Best athletes, Billy boy, I tried that boxing workout that you talked about on the show. A run for three minutes. Then rest for a minute. Oh, now run for three minutes. I said skip rope for three minutes and rest for a minute for 12 rounds. Kicked my ass. Thanks for the tip. Uh, in your opinion, what sport has the best all around athletes?

Speaker 3:          00:52:52       MMM,

Speaker 2:          00:52:57       Uh, you know, I don't know. I think they're all fucking on me. I'll tell you. As far as physical condition.

Speaker 3:          00:53:01       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:53:03       I W hockey players that are, have you ever seen, we were talking about that comics come home. I forget who said it. I want to give it the comic credit. I've can't remember what it was, but it wasn't me. It was another comic who said that says you never see a fat hockey player and it's fucking true. And if you've ever played the sport, you know why?

Speaker 3:          00:53:21       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:53:23       You just don't, it's just, it's of those sports where it's just, you just burn so much calories. You have to be in such unbelievable physical condition that you, uh, what does that sound? Um, was that a bird? It was a fucking bird outside making this weird noise. Every time I inhaled I thought I had a problem with my chest. No, I hear that again. What is that?

Speaker 1:          00:53:47       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:53:48       Is it the bed? Are you guys hearing it? Is it in my head? But what am I losing my mind anyways? The, I dunno, those UFC guys are fucking unbelievable. Boxes are unreal.

Speaker 2:          00:54:03       I have no idea. Jesus Christ. What a shit show that fucking Pacquiao Mayweather fight was, huh? Everybody's flipping the fuck out about that thing for as he's convinced it's fixed. Listen to the verse he effect this week. He sits there going like, dude, you could see it like when packy I'll puts his head down. I'm sitting there going, well you don't think he put his head down during the press conference because everyone was bitching that they, they got fucked over on the fight and he was embarrassed. I don't think that automatically means that there was fixed, but hey, I like a conspiracy like anybody. So anyways. All right. How the fuck do I get out of this? Let's just fucking go on to the next God damn question. I'll read this thing. I swear to God, I think I'm making that noise when I breathe in. All right.

Speaker 2:          00:54:44       In love with the lesbian. Oh, you fucking romantic full. Um, hey bill saw your show in Memphis and I just wanted to say you fucking killed it. Thank you. I drove all the way from Arkansas and was stoked to meet you and get an autographed poster. Uh, well thank you. Anyways, I just wanted to get your take on of my weird situation. There's this girl I've liked since I started Grad school and we've known each other for four years. She's fun, intelligent, kind in my eyes at least. Beautiful. Well, why'd you have to fucking qualify it? Their thing is, I found out early on she didn't play for the team. I thought she didn't play for the team. I thought she did. I was devastated. Soon after that, the woman she loved died and she's still case taking care of, said woman's kids from a previous relationship.

Speaker 2:          00:55:32       Since then, I've moved away. I've tried a bunch of things to try and get over, you know the usual shit. Jim Bury yourself and work. Go after other ladies. I visited her intermittently in the past four years. Well that's not good for you and I can't seem to stop caring for her. Would love to hear what you would do if you were in my situation. Thanks again and go fuck yourself. Um, I think you just have to deal with the fact that you're in love with someone that's not going to love you and you need to move on and just keep doing what you're doing. Keep going to the gym, bury yourself in your work. I wouldn't bury yourself in work. Who the fuck wants to work all the time. But yeah, instead of going after other ladies, why don't you try to go find one that you have something in common with. All right. Thank you. If you had to make a list right now, somebody you would looking for to spend the rest of your life with, I don't think being a lesbian would be on that list because she's not going to get with you unless a, I dunno if she feels like living a lie. Right. Wrote at some point. You know what I mean? She's going to go get her hair done.

Speaker 2:          00:56:35       Uh, what would I would do? I would have faced in the fact that you're the right person is going to come into your life. Ah, I would stop with the visits because that's just, you know, that's like going back and hitting the crack pipe. You know, you're fucking Charlie Brown tried to kick the football again. You fucking land on your back and you get back up. And what do, what are you doing? You know, I would just, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:56:55       you know, I think if you want to fucking meet somebody nice, you have to start living a nice life yourself. You know what I mean? Like, what's funny is, you know, you see these dance clubs, Baby B, B, B, B, B, B. Nobody meets their wife or husband in there, you know, fucking roofie central, you know, everybody on fucking drugs and glow sticks. I mean, you just got a bunch of fucking, you know, either immature, a damaged people in there. You don't put a baby in that. Well, you don't accept somebody fucking Goddamn baby batter us disgusting. Uh, you just, yeah, get the fuck out of there. Okay. You don't meet your wife, you know, and black light.

Speaker 3:          00:57:37       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:57:37       I would. Um, I don't know. There's a lot of stuff that you can do in your 20s to actually meet a great person that you never really think of doing it because you think you've got to go out and you want to go out to bars. You want to do all that crazy shit, get it out of your fucking system. But if you actually, you know, I dunno, join like some sort of league play sports or do some volunteer work or something like that, you're going to meet a great person, you know, or a fun person. Stay out of those stupid ass fucking clubs that every guy, every mouth brie that goes to, you know the kind of people that are going to get Brady a two game suspension for a cunt hair of a fucker. Unbelievable. Who the fuck ways the balls. Can you guys just set aside your hatred for the Patriots? Can you just set a set aside and then just sit there and, and on any fucking level as a fucking man, admit to what? The level of crybaby horse shit that that is.

Speaker 1:          00:58:30       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:58:31       Unfucking believable. Unfucking believable. I'm trying to think of anybody that throws a ball that doesn't doctorate every fucking pitcher does. Every quarterback does. They scuffed them up. They do all kinds of fucking shit to get them where they like it. A little fucking little English on the Goddamn Ball. They all fucking do it every goddamn one of them. He's got a fucking ritual. How they like their football. Do you honestly think that the reason why you didn't make it to the NFL was because the ball was in fully inflated day. The next time you play a pickup game, why don't you let a little bit of air out of the ball and all of a sudden it will magically go everywhere where you fucking wanted to go? You'd be throwing like Tom Brady. It doesn't even fucking make any sense.

Speaker 1:          00:59:16       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:59:16       Jesus fucking Christ. Oh my God, this will make you guys non patriots fans fun. Happy. Yeah. I will never get over this if they fucking tar and feather him over this fucking horse shit. And then I want all the you who support it rather than being pussies on the fucking Internet. Come out to my show or what are you gonna have to go to the shelf just afterwards. I really want you to look me in the eye and present your argument as to why you really fucking field that. That like gave him an advantage. I really want to fucking know why. Like what fucking advantage. And you'd be going against an impartial scientists because ESPN hired the person and God knows ESPN is in the game of sensationalism. They didn't want that guy to fucking come up with a study that said it wasn't an advantage. Um, they wanted it to say it wasn't advantage. And you know why I know that is because they're completely ignoring the fact that they had that study done on their own fucking network.

Speaker 1:          01:00:16       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:00:16       Hello? I'll tell you, it bugs me, you know, all right. Dilemma. Um, your podcasts and none of them. Uh, all right. So here's the dilemma for you. Uh, would you rather spend a year in jail? No.

Speaker 1:          01:00:30       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:00:31       Having to sleep in the same cell cell with the gay fellow named Mandingo Jones. Oh, Jesus. Is that the most hackiest fucking thing ever? Um, well, I tell you, I'd rather have a gay cellmate than a fucking angry straight one that wants to fucking, you know, you just feel like the gay guy would be a little more gentle. You know, he's been there before. He's got some technique gross. All right? Or would you rather become a piece of shit banker?

Speaker 1:          01:01:01       Okay,

Speaker 2:          01:01:01       do, that's not it. It's not a dilemma. I for fucking become a banker. Then I'd be a mole and I'd fucking Rad everybody out. Even then I couldn't, I couldn't fucking rat people out. I'd just be going like guys, you know, remember that day you remember David spades bit when he used, when he was imitating Michael J. Fox and a,

Speaker 1:          01:01:22       okay,

Speaker 2:          01:01:22       come on, let's not rape this girl in Vietnam. Whatever the fucking movie was called. Was it guys? You know, what are we doing here sarge? Like that's what I would be that guy. I mean, although this is a part of me that would like to be sitting in on those meetings just to hear what the fucking, just to hear what they said. You know what I mean? How they present. Do they literally present it like let's do something illegal or do they use other words where everybody just realizes what they're presenting is not exactly within the boundaries and a little game and ship gamesmanship and banking. I want to how they feel it feel like, you know, although I got to tell you, um, 2008 was definitely spygate when it was fucking, uh, you know, when it was fucking, you know, whatever the fuck they did. They, when they oh artificially over inflated the prices of the House, this $40,000 house is worth fucking 90 grand and you what? You make $9 a month and you're qualified for a loan.

Speaker 2:          01:02:25       Um, anyways, whatever Patriot anti Patriot fans, you want to fucking give a shit for spy gate. I'll take that all day long and they shouldn't have done it. It was, it was cheating. They should not have done that. All right. There's a league wide memo telling everybody to stop doing it in the arrogant cunt continued to do it. I think he was guilty of arrogance. I think if he was actually cheating, I think he would have used something a little smaller than some giant news TV thing fucking standing right there on the goddamn sideline. But if you want to say it's that, then you know, fine. If you fucking guys want to act like your team does not do stuff to get a competitive fucking edge. Think about all the guys who are barely in the fucking NFL, barely in the fucking NFL. And if they fucking get cut, they're going to go to bag and God damn groceries that a fucking Gelson's you know, or even worse of violence or a roach brothers, right?

Speaker 2:          01:03:18       Or, or you know, they could maybe do a little something. Maybe Grab Jersey here. Maybe put a little sticky stuff on the gloves. Little, I'm not talking about roids here. Not Talking about Roy. All right. Brady got busted for doing steroids. Fine. Yes, you're cheating. All right. Absolutely. But if you're talking about little land, a little fucking a, let's do a little this too little that each fucking play. If you're gonna fucking call that cheating, I mean, you're really going to, you kind of fun. You're going to fucking kill everybody in the league. I would say that's what I would say. I know you fucking sick of it. You think I'm a patriots fan? I am, and I'm definitely fucking bias, but I think I'm right as to you. So what are we going to toe here? Agree to disagree? Go fuck yourselves. Have a wonderful week and I'll check in on you on Thursday. There.
