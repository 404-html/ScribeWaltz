Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burr and it's the Monday morning podcast for Monday, December 16th, 2013 and I am recording here on, um, it's actually December 17th. I'm finally back from Europe.

Speaker 2:          00:00:18       Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:00:20       I apologize for the podcast being so late, but, um, I was in Iceland and when the fuck am I ever going to be there again. So I had to do some shit Sunday and then Monday I was flying all the way back and uh, I'm actually not that jet lagged. It worked out nice. I tried and I tried to, I tried to stay up on the plane. Oh. Try to stay awake as long as I could a for most of the flight because I knew that I was landing.

Speaker 2:          00:00:44       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:00:46       At 7:00 PM La time, seven 25 or something. So I figured if I could just fucking stay up,

Speaker 1:          00:00:54       you know, Nia picks me up the airport. I just get my ass home and then if I fall asleep, it'll be like nine, 10 o'clock at night and I'm back on the clock and it worked out good. I woke up right. But we do little dude. And I looked at the clock. Why, why, why, why, why? And I wondered what the fuck time it was. I thought it was like two something in the morning because my clock, it fell off the bed day or the digital one day that I've had since to fucking seventies there. And uh, I thought it said two 30 in the morning and I was like, you gotta be fucking kidding me. I thought, I, I thought I did it right. And uh, then all of a sudden I'm at six o'clock and I realized the clock was upside down and that was five 30.

Speaker 1:          00:01:29       Is this even remotely exciting? I don't know if it is or not. I'm trying to keep my voice down because the lovely knee is still sleeping upstairs. Beautiful Angel that she is. And uh, I got my dog down Ham psyched going to go hiking today. Get back into it. I swear to God I don't have the nerve to step on the God damn scale. All right. And if I sound like some skinny bitch, well fuck you. I'm in this business and I read your tweets and I see when you see my face, you start calling me a fat cunt. All right. And I gotta tell you it hurts sometimes, right? No, seriously, no. I'm saying you gotta be if you're in this business. So I think I put on at least 10, 12 pounds. I started eating like a fucking Goddamn Roman God three weeks ago in Italy. And it never, it never stopped. I kept thinking to myself like, all right, when a, when the tour starts, when the tour starts, I'm going to be fucking good. And we discipline. But it just didn't work out that way. It was, um,

Speaker 2:          00:02:32       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:33       This past week, I just, uh, I think I mentioned it last week. I did a seven country, seven city run and uh, what was it? Six cities? London, Dublin, Helsinki, Copenhagen, also Sweden. Okay. Six. But I did two nights in London, so it was seven nights in a row.

Speaker 2:          00:02:52       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:02:54       Basically touring like a band, how they do it. And I have a whole new, for anybody that's touring as a band. And that was hard enough to do by myself with no equipment. I don't have to bring anything. I just fucking show up. Mike and I, Mike Stand, go up to the microphone. I love when they want to or you want to do a sound check? It's like, well, did it sound okay when you talked to do it? Well, yeah. Well, there you go. What am I gonna do? Go up there. Fuck, fuck, fuck. Cunt con con, you know. So anyways, uh, I lost another mixer on this fucking trip. Fool me once. Shame on you, fool me twice. Oh, red faces a dumb fuck. Uh, there's something about these hundred dollar mixers. Believe it or not, they don't have any sort of a, I dunno, something to prevent the surge.

Speaker 1:          00:03:47       I don't know what it is because I had the adapter, um, or the converter or I should say convert and all the adapter. I forget what that fucking guy in Helsinki dressed me down two years ago on. It does not a a, doesn't though. You are not converting the electricity. You are adopting it towards your devices. Yes. Oh, fuck you. Hans. Um, uh, what's the, no, it's a good Swedish name. I don't, our fin finished name. I have no fucking idea. This podcast is going to be all over the map. I Apologize One more time for the, uh, the sound quality here. Um, you know my mixes, shit, the bed, I just discovered that. So, uh, but the good thing is the all things comedy networks, new studios are up and running and um, hopefully, uh, I have a nice surprise guest that I'm going to try to be interviewing.

Speaker 1:          00:04:43       He's got a big movie coming out. Look at me, teasing it, teasing it, tickling you with it. Uh, but I don't want to say that he's going to be on it because I know he's fucking busy doing press for it. But, uh, I ran into him when I was in Dublin, which was the greatest fucking thing ever. Him and his friends were fucking hype in the movie and I was in Dublin and we just went out and fucking drank and sang Christmas songs. It was fucking awesome. Such a great tour. And, uh, yeah, at the risk of being Corny, I got to tell you at one point I was doing the second show in Finland and I had this feeling when I was on stage that I was doing exactly what the fuck I'm supposed to be doing in life. I can't explain it. There's something about making people laugh that far away from where, uh, where you live and where you speak a language. And if you're still connecting that, that's pretty much about as great an affirmation that, you know, I'm really, I'm supposed to be doing it. This shit is still working this far away. Um, oh, what a fucking week. What a week. I got sites, subs right now I did a show in Dublin, Ireland and all

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       the crowds were great, but I gotta tell you those fucking people in Ireland as a funniest, I can't even explain.

Speaker 3:          00:06:07       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:06:08       I sweat it. Well, there's something about like when I go through Great Britain and Ireland, it's like Scotland and Ireland. They liked the knuckleheads that I grew up with and when I go to London, London is like,

Speaker 1:          00:06:22       was, is kind of like all the people that I met when I went to New York that were from Boston. So they, they did move away from where they were from, but they still brought that thing with them cause people in London are hilarious. But I was doing a show Dublin on Monday night at the, the, the vicar, a vicar street theater or something. Just this awesome venue. By the way, Jim Gaffigan's going to be there if any UI, Irish console. Listen to this. You got to go see him. I was supposed to tweet about that. I'm going to do that today. I'm hilarious. Jim Gaffigan's going to be there. Um, and uh, anyway, so it was, it was on a Monday night and it's a really hard night to try and sell tickets and these people showed up in force and I can't even tell you how they,

Speaker 1:          00:07:07       they, they were fucking hilarious. Like I was on stage and there was this thing I was talking about about people hugging their kids and how that could put is a good thing. But if you do it too much it could potentially make a week or so. I mentioned it all. I've been telling this story for like six to eight months and I've been saying how that, you know, my mother wasn't a hug, hug her and didn't hug us when we were kids and people just listen and it's just a small detail that leads to this other part that I want to talk about. So I've said that line

Speaker 1:          00:07:44       uneventfully that's even a fucking work with, with no, no issue whatsoever for like six months. Now I'm in fucking Ireland and I just throw that line out there like I'm not even thinking about it and say, yeah. I said, you know, my mother didn't hug me when I was a kid and I'm getting ready to say the next sentence. And like 15% of the crowd goes, aw, I'm not even doing it the way they did. It just collectively broke my boss. It was just such the classic fucking, it was like that Boston Irish thing that I grew up with distilled to its purest form with actually real Irish people were,

Speaker 1:          00:08:26       I, you'd almost have to be that a fucking understand what was behind it. It was like I opened the emotional door, just a crack in automatically. It's just, they just bust your balls about it. Like, ah, you're fucking, you know what? Like you think they, I think we got hugs. You freckled can't shut the fuck up and tell the judge I can't even, it just, I, I've been trying to, I would try to explain it to Nia. She laughed, but still, yeah, you kind of had to be there and you know, so I left that when my fucking trying to get your sympathy, I'm trying to get to this mess. Next part. You assholes and the whole crowd fucking left. And then like a half hour later, what I had done when I was over there was I bought a bunch of DVDs with me. Um, like just the, uh, basically the DVD itself with this little paper thing.

Speaker 1:          00:09:16       And I was just handing them out to people cause I'm trying to get them to show other people, you know, when I'm out there so I can keep coming back. Basically trying to get them to spread the word and my comedy. And then someone's just like, well why don't you just put it on Spotify? You dumb fuck. And I'm like, yeah cause I'm old. Alright. I feel like I have to bring the hard copy. So I tell these assholes that I'm giving him free DVDs at the end of the show and I'm halfway through that Spiel, telling them that they're getting a free DVD. All right? And I'm in the middle of it and I hate this guy in the back of the crowd goes, Oh fuck off.

Speaker 1:          00:09:56       I don't even think I even explained what I was doing. I don't know if I had gotten to the part where they were free. I don't know what the fuck. Always the fact that I was trying to once again go to a nice place where, hey, you know, I really appreciate you guys coming out. This really means a lot to me and I want to keep coming back here cause I think you've got a great comp country or whatever it. And I said, just opening the door that much. Oh fuck off. So I finally just looked and I went, Jesus Christ, they were already laughed and I was like, you know what? I played in 20, almost 22 years as a comedian. I have played in front of some miserable motherfuckers but you guys, and they were already laughing or the most miserable fucking concert I've ever been in.

Speaker 1:          00:10:40       And they loved it, absolutely loved it. And um, it killed me that I couldn't go out drinking with the crowd cause they had a fucking go a head, an early flight of course, all the way over to Helsinki. But um, and it was just kind of those moments all the way through the tour that were unreal. Like, uh, in Helsinki, I hope I'm not boring you guys with this shit, but I'm in Helsinki. I did two shows and the first show I went out and I just like felt like I couldn't get on a roll for like a lot of the show. Like I that get last and then it would stop. I would get laughs and then it would stop. And I was like, and, and, and it got to the point that there was one point in the first show that something I said bombed so hard that I almost got a little depressed.

Speaker 1:          00:11:30       And I definitely thought, because in my head I was thinking about like, wow, I think I've reached the limits to where my act works once I get on the other side of the Baltic Sea. And you really feel that when you get on the other side of the Baltic Sea, you get that feeling like, you know, we're, I'm not in Europe anymore. You're starting to feel like I am heading towards the Soviet Union. Um, even though, you know, a good one, 20% of that country is in Europe or you just get this, I can't explain it. You're definitely, you're in eastern Europe. You starting to get like that Baltic Slavic fucking vibe and, and um, I had to use all these tricks that I've learned as a comedian over the years to basically stop the, uh, I dunno what the, the proverbial comedy jet from going into a spin and you know, crashing into the ground.

Speaker 1:          00:12:25       I just committed harder. I started, um, Improv on f trying to tag every joke with something new, something to get me present. Um, and I was able to, I still had a good show and everything and I know they had a good time, but I was thinking in my head like, man, this guy wanted me to go to Astonia, which is basically like a fucking 50 minute boat ride from, uh, Finland. And I was thinking like, there's no fucking way I'm going there. I think I've reached the end. And then something happened during the second show or I was talking about getting a gun and how I liked this one gun because it was quieter and those bigger ones at too fucking loud and if you pull the trigger you're going to fucking destroy your ears and they're laughing and shit. And then as I come to the end of the joke, you know, they laughed and then it was kind of quiet and then some guy in the crowd yelled out, you know, get a silencer.

Speaker 1:          00:13:20       And I was like, well silencers are illegal where I'm at. I know in Jacksonville, Florida, their legal, cause I used them but they're illegal. Rahmat they basically say that, you know, I want to murder somebody and I don't want anybody to know, um, in the next room. And then it just dawned on me and I was like, I, I, I just, I've been in front of really smart crowds before and they laugh and shut up and laugh and shut up these fucking guys that people were so smart. They were sitting there, they were trying to solve the problem of the joke. They're laughing at the joke while coming up with solutions. So I finally said to him, I said, listen, I was like, is this what you guys doing? All right. I'm like, this isn't a, this isn't a fucking think tank. It's just a comedy show.

Speaker 1:          00:14:05       And then I somehow connected with them in that moment and then I had him for the rest of the way and I just started riffing on that. Anytime a joke would only do okay. I would just start riffing on like the solution to whatever the joke was. And that got them back in it and I was able to get on, uh, get on a roll with them. And um, it was just kind of that all all week dude. And I was, oh my God, fucking Helsinki. I watched the sun go down at like three 30 in the afternoon from my hotel. I think by the time I got there. That's right. By the time I got to Helsinki, cause I had to connect in London at a frau. Um, which by the way is, um, if you ever have to go to Heathrow airport, I would suggest doing two hours of yoga before you get there. It is a unbelievable test of your patients, of your cardio is sanity and it's fucking, and I, of course, you know me, I failed miserably. I lose my shit at LAX. Um, put it this way, if you, if you can avoid, if you ever go to Europe, here's a travel tip for you and you could avoid connecting.

Speaker 4:          00:15:19       If you're not going to London, I would highly, highly recommend

Speaker 1:          00:15:23       not connecting in London because it's not like connecting in other, other,

Speaker 4:          00:15:30       I've never had to. You get off, you got to run through a whole terminal and then wait for a bus that isn't coming for seven minutes. And then by the time the bus comes to so many fucking people, or there's already too many people, you got to wait for the next bus and another seven minutes you finally get on that fucking thing.

Speaker 1:          00:15:48       And it is a shit show. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:15:52       oh and by the way, if anybody lights up a cigarette, it's going to be too foggy for anything, the land. So you're going to be delayed wherever the hell you're at. A, I went through that fucking thing

Speaker 1:          00:16:00       three times. Um, it, it's still, it's still an a, it's an incredible airport. It's stills, just the sheer size of it you have to respect. But I have to tell you, give yourself plenty of time if you can to connect. Uh, yeah, it's uh, it's a, it's a fucking nightmare. Um, I don't know what, so where the hell did I go from there? I think I went to Copenhagen after that.

Speaker 1:          00:16:30       Copenhagen. Yep. I did a show there that was fucking amazing. And uh, I got you guys got to forgive me. All the comedians that I work with, cause I went night after night after night after night and uh, you guys had some pretty crazy names. Uh, I think this guy's name was, was a Christian or something like that. I can't remember. Really, really smart guy. Really cool guy and gave me a bunch of tags for jokes. And they were actually really funny. A lot of times when somebody does that, uh, the fucking horrific but up and you got to sit there smiling like, yeah, you know, we're going to try that. His were actually great. Um, uh, so what else? What else? What else? Um,

Speaker 1:          00:17:11       AH, fuck. You know what? I just realized I left it upstairs when I was in Iceland, one of the two comedians that opened up for me, both of them were great. I couldn't understand what the fuck they was saying, but uh, one of them gave me a book. I'm going to hit pause and I go upstairs and get it. If you guys like, you know, like those, you don't like those, those cartoon strips like the far side, which just a picture and they write something funny. All right, well if you like something absolutely just completely sick and twisted. I just sit down and record her. Hang on. I'm going to look, I'm going to look it up right now. I got to find this because it's fucking hilarious. I mean, he was killing like all the comics I was with. We would just, after we did the show, went to dinner and we were uh, passing the book around, laughing our asses off. Let's see. I hate dolphins. There it is. I hate dolphins.

Speaker 3:          00:18:02       A book.

Speaker 1:          00:18:09       Where the fuck is it? Come on man. It came up. I saw when it came up. Hold on. I mean one of his uh, one of his cartoons, there it is, one of his cartoons has a stick figure. It like stick figures, drawings and he's running is a, it's a father running after his kids with this like acoustic guitar over his head.

Speaker 3:          00:18:38       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:18:39       And screaming. It's your fault. I'm not a rock star. And then one of the little kids running away is going daddy. No, and it's just another one is you got two guys are standing over another stick figure that's laying on the ground and it looks like it's just blown his brains out and one of the stick figures looks at the other end, goes something like you want to fuck them. It's just the darkest, sickest shit he's got two books is other, one's called something like my pussies Hungary. I don't know what it is. This guy, I don't know how to say his fucking name. It's

Speaker 1:          00:19:30       just search. I hate dolphins and the comedian's name, it's who, who, who, who will occur. I don't know. Hug Liquor Dobson and it's spelled h. U. G. L. E. I. K. U r. And his last name is d. A. G. O. S. S. O. N. M. Man. This fucking focus. Hilarious. Half the shit. That's funny. As you look at it, you laugh and then you hand it to your friend and he's looking at it and his, you know, you read what it says and he got to kind of look at the picture and put it together. So watching your friend taken in the joke is, is I think it's even more enjoyable. But um, he was fucking funny man. He broke my balls when he brought me up, like switched into English and uh, I forget him. What the fuck he was saying. It was just great. And the guy who came on before, I was also awesome. They're just really, really funny people. Dude, Iceland is insane. You know, they have an app over there that basically when you meet somebody and you want to start dating them, you just search it and you see how you're related. It'll show how you're related.

Speaker 1:          00:20:41       I want to say that again. They have an APP over there. You meet a woman in a bar or a woman meets a guy or whatever, a couple of twinkle toes meet each other there. Um, you're fucking, you're just a, there's an APP that will say, not if you're related how you're related because everybody there is fucking related. Um, and you know what's funny there? Absolutely. The fucking great looking people. So I think they spread it out far and wide. Oh they, they actually, the, the cab drivers over, they have a joke in Iceland. Uh, and people in Great Britain and Ireland aren't going to like this. They basically sit cause people always talk about how beautiful the women are. And they said they, well basically the vikings, when they would conquer other people, they would just take all the good look, good looking women and they would take him away with them.

Speaker 1:          00:21:34       Um, talk about the ultimate defeat. Yeah. Take my farm land. I don't give a shit. You take all the beautiful women for the fuck am I supposed to do? Just kill me now. So they're saying that they, they took them all out of Great Britain, took him out of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland, and they took him off to Iceland. And that's why they, women are so much better looking and that there's no good looking women. And the other one, which isn't true, but of course they say that, but it's fucking hilarious. Um, and also they fucking eat everything because they live on an island. So when you go to the menu, um, they had pigeon on the menu, but I think that that's their word for dove. Um, a buddy of mine, he ordered it. I had a piece of it tasted all right, little fucking gay me. And then they also had whale and I was, the only thing that I didn't like about Iceland was there's a number of restaurants that you went into when you could actually eat whale, which to me is like eating an elephant. You know what I mean? There's just certain animals.

Speaker 2:          00:22:38       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:22:41       You know, like look, if they had like a jackal sandwich or a fucking hyenas sandwich, you know, this certain animals where you just like, you know what, you a cut. All right. Or, or there's enough of you like, I'll eat venison. I don't give a fuck. You know, there's plenty of God damn deer running around with their disease ticks. Okay. Fucking up the front ends of a bunch of cars. I don't give a shit about that, but whales, I mean, they're like endangered. Oh, he must not be in danger because, or at least Iceland doesn't give a fuck. I don't really understand how that works, but um, did you could actually eat one meal and I was just like, I, that that was the only thing that, that upset me when I was a, when I was in Iceland. Iceland is fucking unbelievable. Uh, you walk around and I recommend going in the winter time. Don't go in the summer when there's a bunch of people, Jean shorts walking around. Fuck that. You go in the summertime

Speaker 2:          00:23:38       and, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:23:40       I got this thing, the blue lagoon spa there that you go into. It's, it's fun. I can't even describe it to it. It's fucking insane. You're in this fucking giant salt water, like pool that's heated. There's steam coming off it. You're surrounded by snow and everything just looks blue. It's like you have on those, uh, someone was saying, uh, Mitch Hedberg rest his soul, those blue tinted sunglasses that he used to where it's like you're wearing those fucking things. Um, I don't know. It was an absolutely amazing, amazing fucking amazing, uh, trip. Uh, had a great time in Sweden. I just don't want to leave any city out here. Sweden, I performed in this, this theater. Uh, it almost looked like a, you were in like a, uh, a circus tent, but it was a theater. Like when you looked out, you felt like he was standing in the middle, but it was like, cause it was like in the round, but not totally.

Speaker 1:          00:24:35       It was like a semicircle kind of thing. MMM. And Oslow also was a place I spent the least amount of time, but I, I just had a great time for smoke. The fucking Cuban cigar. That's another great thing. Cubans aren't legal and um, there are ways to get them back in the country. Wink, wink. Um, let's just say that daddy is going to be fucking drinking a lot of scotch over the next month. Um, and it's also a great thing too. If you get buddies who smokes cigars, you know, he'd sneak something for them. Um, or maybe you don't, you allegedly do it. All right, this is the Monday morning podcast.

Speaker 1:          00:27:58       Um, what did we guys here? Left? We got two more left. All right, we'll do some more podcasting and then I'll get back to that. So, um, is there anything else I can tell you guys about? Um,

Speaker 1:          00:28:16       oh, here's one. Here's a good one for jet lag. I like to, uh, fly at night. Leave wherever you're going. Like if you're flying east to west, if you fly around three, four in the afternoon, that's also the sweet spot at the airport by the way. Cause then he'd come in around two, one, two o'clock in the afternoon. And for the most part, people, wherever they're staying, they either want to get the fuck out of there or they want to try to stretch it another day. So they, they get, you know, fly between six in the morning to 10 or they start leaving around, you know, five or maybe seven cause they want to skip the rush hour traffic. So that's a good time to go. And you're basically, you're flying in tonight so it's easy to go to sleep. You can get eight hours. She definitely gonna be jet lagged when you get to Europe. But coming back,

Speaker 2:          00:29:04       um, when did I leave?

Speaker 1:          00:29:08       I ain't know it sucked. The only suck when I was coming back was I was in Iceland, so I'm halfway across the Atlantic, the Atlantic Ocean and, but it was like a zillion dollars and way more miles than I had to try to get a nice business class seat.

Speaker 2:          00:29:23       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:29:24       Straight to La. So I had to fly back to fucking eighth row connected any frail. And um, I was getting off Icelandic air and switching to virgin air. So I checked my bag and I had to fucking go to baggage claim and had to go through

Speaker 4:          00:29:42       customs, go down and get the fucking bag and then do the bus thing to this thing, to that thing. With the fucking bag and dude, you want to hear about a whiny cunt, Kirsten up a fucking storm. And then I ended up having plenty of time.

Speaker 3:          00:29:56       Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:29:56       I had plenty of time and ended up drinking a couple of scotches there and I talked to some woman who was from Poland and I was saying, you know, I had some people come out to my shows and Poland in Copenhagen. I, I'd love to go there. And she's like, well where do you want to go? And I was like, Warsaw. And she just shook her head. She say, Hey, you know, I go there, it's too uh, too commercial. And she fucking broke down all the Poland for me. So I'm telling you guys, you've got to do it. You got to do it. If you've got the time or whatever, or make time, fuck that. Even if you've got kids, fuck it. All right, fuck getting that second flat screen TV. Fuck their college education. It's going to be there. Okay. They're not going to get a college education because you spent fucking seven days in Europe one fucking time.

Speaker 4:          00:30:39       One time you spent it there and you dropped him off with, with the parents to watch them. That's great. They're going to be close to your grandparents. You know, your parents would get to spend time with your kids and you'll get to go over there, get to see the world from a different perspective. You got to fucking do it a highly recommended and you can do it on the fucking sheep. You really can't just get your fucking asses over there and have yourself a sandwich sandwich. All right? Um, I really hope it's many people's, you know, fucking gold. You know what's great, and I've been reading when I was in Scotland, something I told you, somebody gave me this book, David Lee Ross Book that came out in the late nineties crazy from the heat. And I gotta tell you, this is a fucking killer book, man. And what I love about it is he's not dishing a bunch of dirt about van Halen and going, Eddie's a content, Michael Anthony and Alex and all that.

Speaker 4:          00:31:28       He definitely takes a shot here or there, but he went through a real painful fucking thing with the ending of that. And God knows they trashed him enough. But a lot of it is he, he's describing what it's like to be on the road. And um, right now he's talking about the extensive travel that he's done talking about. He ended a tour in [inaudible] 83 with van Halen and Argentina. So he's with his security guide, big Ed. And not to be confused with Eddie van Halen. This is a different guy, big Ed. And he's like, well, you know, we kind of have to go past the, uh, the Amazon to get back to a la. Why don't we go there? And Big Ed was like, Oh yeah, I've always wanted to go to Africa. And David leads just like, all right, close enough, whatever. So they ain't, he talks about just like dropping a boat into the Amazon River and going fucking down the river, up the river, whatever he's doing, getting dysentery, feeling like he's going to die, having 12 second convulsions. Um, this is a fucking rock star. Who the hell does this shit, man, it's really, really amazing. And I, when I put down the book this morning, he was about ready go up. Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       he was in the Himalayas, uh, going through the valley approaching Mount Everest.

Speaker 2:          00:32:45       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:32:48       He has this great theory of like, you know, because he's, he's a nice guy that he's seen all these great cities. He always brings his bicycle on. Torney rides a bike through the city at night. And he said, you really get to see the city and feel the spirits of the city. And I was thinking, fuck man, maybe I told you this last week is I kind of had that moment when I was sitting there outside the Vatican. You got to fucking do it. You got to fucking do it. Okay. And if some shit head like me who fucking flunked, didn't flunk everything in high school, but I swear to God, I got C's, D's and e's. They weren't called apps where I was from a, it was a fucking, I told you this before, when I was a freshman in high school, I was going to go to Notre Dame and become a lawyer and by the time I was a sophomore I was like, well maybe I'll get into roofing. That's how bad I did. Um, just completely shit the bed, the bed like fucking fumbled the punt, whatever the fuck you want to call it.

Speaker 2:          00:33:42       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:33:44       Yeah, it was awful. So, uh, so anyways, that's, that's my travel talk. All right. That gives all the people who hate sports. When I talk about a, when I talk about sports too much on the podcast, I gave you a break and uh, I have no fucking idea what is going on in any sport other than hockey cause I got the Bruins App on my phone and uh, I know they had a great west coast trip. You've got their asses kicked too on my hand it to him or asses kicked our asses handed to them or asses kicked to him. Is that a new one? I got my ass kicked to me. It's like they removed your ass and as you then they walked across the street and then punted your ass back over to you because they felt so bad about the beat death.

Speaker 1:          00:34:24       They go, there's a new one, um, by the Vancouver Canucks. So it was funny. They're all giving me shit on Twitter, uh, doing that stupid, this, this, this being the Bruins. Six to one. Priceless self. I don't know why you would say that to me. I'm like, well, uh, losing the first two games in the finals and coming back to win five out of the next six or five. Oh wait, wait a minute. That doesn't make sense. Does it for the next five, Jesus Christ bill, there's my high school math again, losing the first two and then coming back to win for the last five in game seven and you're fucking building. I think that's a little bit better to win a Stanley Cup. All right, so congratulations on your regular season win and all you cuts out there who have given me shit because the patriots lost to the dolphins. All you fantasy football playing fucking morons. Okay. Who actually think that Brady's lost to step in. They're so fucking dumb when it comes to watching sports and analyzing what the fuck's going on because you get your nose half an inch away from the paper looking at numbers. Uh, you better wake the fuck up because there's only like another week I guess of regular season football. Tom Brady is in the middle of one of his greatest seasons he's ever had. The fact that they have the record that they do

Speaker 4:          00:35:38       with, uh, the level of injuries and the shift that as people we lost to free agency. It's been fucking unreal. Like somebody brought me on Twitter, like really hadn't had a fuck do lose to the dolphins. It's like, well, first of all, it's easy if you score less points than they do in second of all, whenever you play a division rival, they see it twice a year. Every year. They know who you are, they know what the fuck you do. Um, if you're a gambler, if you ever want to bet on an upset, I would definitely say bet that the division rival, especially if they lost the first time, is at least going to cover, if not fucking beat them. It happens all the time. I don't know what sport you fucking watching and, uh, we have catastrophic fucking injuries on defense. I'm not making, I might, I actually, I am making excuses, but like, um, what I'm really saying is that if I was in the states and I was watching the patriots versus the dolphins, there's no fucking way that I would just be like, oh, there's no way we're not going to win this game.

Speaker 4:          00:36:31       Um, so anyways, uh, that's all I know about what's going on in football. Um, I, I completely missed the Cleveland browns game, I guess with the Patriots got all those new age calls where it doesn't seem like it's football anymore, you know what I mean? Um, so anyways, uh, let's get onto some, let's get on some, oh, and I got a new TV show whenever I go overseas and I'm jet lagged. I always put on Netflix and I get into something else, or I buy a box set, I got into the killing. I don't know if anybody's watching that, but I am three episodes in and I'm watching every second of the series. Phenomenal series, definitely not for the emotionally light. Uh, you don't want to deal with something that's pretty fucking heavy and they do not pull any punches. They take you, they walk you right through it where you feel like you're living, living it.

Speaker 4:          00:37:28       It's, it's a amazing fucking amazing show so far. Phenomenal, which shot the acting and all that type of shit. And I'm looking at him like, fuck, I'd love to be on a show like this. So who knows. I'm going to bug my agent today. Hey, can I, yeah. Can I play a body or something on that show? I'd love to be on it. Um, anyways, um, I want to thank everybody for joining the podcast. Tee shirts. Uh, my tee shirt, uh, slash podcast guy, Andrew Feminists, uh, slash standup extraordinary who will also be at that New Year's eve show at the Wiltern out here in Los Angeles. If you want to see the crew of knuckleheads that gets fucking hammered every year out on the golf course, they're going to the rose bowl. It's Andrew Demo, Emily's Joe Bart, Nick J, law head, Jason Lie had in myself and there are very limited tickets left. So, um, if you need a few plans fell through, come on down. We'll make you laugh. And um, I dunno, I think we're going to stay, stick around, do a countdown and all that. We're going to be boozing it up. Love to see guys down there. But um, anyways, he was mentioning that I believe the podcast t shirts are sold out at this point for the most part, except for some of the bigger sizes, I think.

Speaker 2:          00:38:39       MMM.

Speaker 4:          00:38:41       And if you have any problem with your order, the email to check in is a bill burn. merge@gmaildotcomalllowercasebillburrmergedmdrchatgmail.com. Uh, we take pride in getting this stuff out to you. I think Andrew's done a great job. Really, really killed it. Uh, but let us know if you're having any problems.

Speaker 2:          00:39:03       MMM.

Speaker 4:          00:39:05       You know, we are human beings. We do fuck up, but we don't want to fuck you over. So let us know if there's a problem as soon as possible and we'll make it right. Okay. All right. Here we go onto the questions and the lettuce this week. Finland show. Hey Bill, loved to show in Helsinki. Well thank you. Uh, I definitely pay to see you again. I don't know if it was just me. There were a few moments where I felt you worried about offending the audience or something that's extremely hard to do. Yes. See would probably there at the first show. I was feeling you guys out, man. And I think I also had that long flight from Dublin where I got, I got delayed at a fro, connected in AFL and I literally landed, went right to the show. So I might been just a tad off. He said, that's extremely hard to do a here's the next time. Don't worry about any, any of that. The less you pull punches, the more you're gonna get out of the audience and Finland. Oh, that's awesome man. Thank you. Thank you for a reading from your playbook. Why? I think I figured you guys out. As I just mentioned the story, a story on the podcast. Tell them that, that story anyway, he goes, PSB, ex girlfriend was a ginger. She was a real cunt.

Speaker 2:          00:40:19       MMM.

Speaker 4:          00:40:21       I didn't even know she was a ginger until I took her pants off.

Speaker 2:          00:40:30       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:40:31       Ah, Shit.

Speaker 2:          00:40:33       I fucking funny. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:40:36       yeah, no, you know what it was was I came out and I, it's just like, you guys are really fucking like Surrey. Any comic who's going to play Finland over there? There's like mean I can't say this is just my experience because it was my fucking jetlag, my act that I was doing and whatever the fuck was going on with me chemically. So I can't say that this is going to happen, but, uh, there are fucking great crowd and now this guy is saying that you can't offend them. You know what's great when you go through all of those? Um, I basically did all of a, the Nordic countries, I've told you guys this before, Scandinavia consists of Norway, Sweden and Denmark.

Speaker 4:          00:41:22       And those three countries that Scandinavia, but within them, Scandinavia is part of the Nordic countries. And that includes all of Scandinavia, the three, I just, and then Finland, Iceland, and I think they're called the federal islands. That's the only place I didn't go. The Faroe Islands, which are like northwest of Scotland. Um, but what's great when you go through all of that is for the most part, it's predominantly Lutheran, Lutheran or a Lutheran, I don't know how to say properly, but they, and they basically believe that when you die, you're dead. You just go into the ground and it's just like, and I say, well, don't you wonder, like, can you wrap your head around not existing? And they're like, yeah, it's just like before you were born, you don't remember that same thing. And

Speaker 3:          00:42:15       okay.

Speaker 4:          00:42:16       Because of that, they're really fucking logical. Um, if that, it makes sense, if that's any comedian listened to this, I would basically describe the, give it to a college gig. And you think you're bombing, but then you realize, oh wait, these, this is a really smart school. And they just laugh in a different way. That's basically what a Helsinki was like. So, uh, thanks for the heads up. I did have a great time. Um, and I hope those people on the first show had a good time too. I was, you know, I don't want to let people down, you know, I'll make sure I give him the whole fucking thing. And I told him, I made a rule that I wasn't going to bitch at all on this tour because I knew what was going to be brutal going from place to place to place to place everyday.

Speaker 4:          00:42:56       Fucking waking up, going to the airport, landing and then trying to figure out how fuck making my jokes work. Um, so because I made the rule that I wasn't going to bitch, I only bitch like 30 times as opposed to like 3000, although if you counted each individual bitch going through a frown, connected any foul, um, that I'd probably pitch like 700 times. But I was compartmentalizing. That's a word to a Heathrow airport. Um, for the most part. All right. Hey, bill, loved from Morocco. Um, Bill, before I start, I just want to let you know that my sister and I attended your show in London last week. Uh, you did a great job, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Uh, you had the whole crowd. It's puppet, blah, blah, blah. But enough with the ass kicking. Okay. Here's a little conspiracy theory for you. At the end of the show, we had a little argument about your ghosts segment. Yeah. I don't believe in ghosts, which was fucking hilarious to go through a place that doesn't believe that you go anywhere when you die. You know, when I was going through Scandinavia in the Nordic countries, because I was, I'd be like, usually when I say there's no ghosts, I don't believe in ghosts. There's someone in the crowd that's like, oh no, you know, I believe in ghosts. Yeah, absolutely. And they were just sitting there and those other countries just like, yeah, yeah, why the fuck would you believe in ghosts? That's stupid.

Speaker 4:          00:44:17       Is that? And he goes, he goes, remember when the your bottle fell off the stool

Speaker 4:          00:44:22       and the water spilled on stage? Yeah, I did this whole segment about how I don't believe in ghosts. And I remember when I went to set down my bottle for some reason, the cushion on the seat, it was sort of doing like the leaning Tower of Pisa thing. So anyways, I finished the ghost bit, then I was into some other jokes and all of a sudden it looks like the bottle tipped over by itself. One of those great standup moments where you can't plan it, it tipped over itself. And then, uh, and I didn't realize that the crowd is reacting and it, and it was like a full bottle. So it's just pouring out, um, got all over the stage and everything. And then of course I riff that it was actually a ghost and that is trying to electrocute me and all that type of shit.

Speaker 4:          00:45:04       And um, and it worked great. But anyways, he said, my sister think, thinks that was part of your act, the ghost thing. And there was no way you could be that good at Improv. I better 50 pounds that it wasn't planned either way. It was beautifully done. Do you mind settling this for us? Yeah, no, it was not planned. You realize how cheesy that would be if you plan that. And also not to kill the whole improv thing. It's really not that difficult to come up with some funny shit when water spills by itself after you just did a ghost thing. Um, it isn't, you know, and you don't realize how many times, I mean, you fucking Improv, everybody's improving. When you walk and you're having a conversation, you're totally in the moment with somebody and you're, you're without realizing it because you understand language. You're listening and translating and you're also, which is reminding you some other shit that you're thinking about that adds to where the conversation goes. Um, what it is. So everybody can do that. It's just when you get on stage, it's, it's,

Speaker 4:          00:46:15       you're, you're going on stage starting your career and you're dealing with stage fright and forcing yourself to do this thing that scares the shit out of you, which causes you to think, which shuts down all of your improv abilities. But over the years, as you do it, you get more and more comfortable and you become as comfortable on stage as you are offstage. And then once again, you tap back into that power of improving that everyone in the crowd is already doing. Um, but for, but it's just not defined as it. So that's, that's basically what it is. So no, that was not, that was a, uh, that was not planned.

Speaker 2:          00:46:55       MMM.

Speaker 4:          00:46:56       Actually had another great one that I was doing a another great moment I should say. It's not like can pat myself on the bed. I had another great moment of Improv when I took the Mike's dad and pretended it was a skinny little bit. Um, and she, she held eat something for an hour. No. Um, I was in Iceland when I walked on stage. They had a fucking giant Christmas tree just to the right of the stage. All lit up looking beautifully. But I saw, I went into this stupid thing where I was acting like it was stealing focus and I was being a diva and I refuse to tell any more jokes until somebody's fucking, what are you Reykjavik sons of bitches comes up here and takes his God damn tree down. And I went on this whole long thing and it just happened right at the beginning of the show. I just saw it and I just,

Speaker 3:          00:47:46       I dunno,

Speaker 4:          00:47:47       I just fucking started talking about it and it killed and they loved it. And then later on in the act, I apologize to the tree like it was, you know, like I was in some abusive relationship with it. Like, hey listen, I'm sorry about what I said earlier. You're not, you know, I feel about Jay and blah blah blah, and just kind of went on this thing. Like, that's the most fun thing as a comedian was when you get comfortable enough to do that shit because I'm not going to lie to get you get sick of telling you jokes.

Speaker 4:          00:48:20       Um, but anyways, he finishes off. He says also, I've been introducing you to my Moroccan friends over the years and as soon as I can get 10,000 people like you, I'll email you so that you, uh, so you can come visit. Um, thanks and go fuck yourself. Well, you know what, send a fucking email to a bill, burn merchant, gmail.com and Andrew, we'll hopefully get back to me. Maybe a, I could figure out some fucking, uh, I'll send you some promotional, a promotional package of some shit. I'll send some of my, my ways over there and a young thing you gotta do is hand them out to your friends. Okay. That's it. All right. Um, where the fuck am I?

Speaker 4:          00:49:05       Oh, there's the ending. Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. All right, you go fuck yourself too. All right. Underage girl equation. All right, let's hope this doesn't get creepy again. A bill, longtime fan listener caught a few shows. Glad you kicking ass. Thank you. Ah, here's the important part is the important part. Yeah. Fuck my career. Exactly. A to calculate acceptable age differences between partners. Here's my rule of thumb. All right, for those of you who are just new to the podcast, I haven't listened in the past couple of weeks because you have a life. Um, lately, lately I don't know what's been going on but people who have been sending me these fucking emails and uh, it's somehow it's like, yeah, you know, 27, my girlfriend's 19, we've been dating for six years and uh, it's like, wait a minute, wait, what the fuck? You know, it gets weird. So this is what he's referring to.

Speaker 4:          00:49:55       He goes, here's the important part to calculate acceptable age differences between partners. Here is my rule of thumb. Half Your Age plus seven, that's it works for everyone pretty much. If you're 22, half your age is 11 plus seven equals 18. Uh, dude, I got to say 22 to 18. That, is that still a still a huge age difference but, but it is legal. It is legal. I don't know how you don't feel like fucking Matthew mcconaughey in dazed and confused with that one too. Cause you're literally talking like, you know you got a mustache by 22. Come on man. She's 18

Speaker 3:          00:50:37       yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:50:38       finishing up high school.

Speaker 3:          00:50:40       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:50:40       And you've just wrapped college. That's a huge age difference. But you know, 26 to 22 is not a big deal.

Speaker 3:          00:50:47       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:50:48       Um, anyways, but I like, I like what you're saying. You said 18 is your cutoff. So yeah, that does make sense. It is legal. He goes, if you're a d half your age is 40 plus seven is 47 boom. There it is. Again, reasonable differences regardless of age. Yeah. It depends on who you are and that one, I think I would rather be the 80 year old. I feel like I'm stealing money at that point. But I like, I like what you get, where you're coming from here. He goes, I'm not saying there aren't, there aren't anomalies out there for every situation, but for a simple guide to not being a pervy fuck bag, stick with the half plus seven rule. Uh, been meaning to share this with you for awhile, but seeing is every week we seem to have a new douche bag trying to justify as perversion. Well, it's time. Yeah. Thank you. All right, there you go. People half your age plus seven. If it doesn't fuck a workout while half your age plus seven and she's still 18 or older,

Speaker 3:          00:51:43       right?

Speaker 4:          00:51:45       Cause if you're 18 half year, age is nine plus seven is 16. I mean, you're in trouble there. That's statutory rape. That's still kind of works out good. I'm 16. Half my age is a plus seven is 15. That fucking works.

Speaker 3:          00:52:03       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:52:03       You're 12 half your age is six plus seven. She's 13. You fucking slaying it. I love this theory.

Speaker 4:          00:52:12       I love this fucking theory. God dammit. That works. This son of a bitch, he's like Matt Damon and that fucking, uh, where he's got the mop and he's good at math one flew over the cuckoo's nest. Dazed and confused fucking, uh, I got to see about a girl. What the fuck is it called? Goodwill hunting. They get go. I shook it loose. Um, oh, you know what I watched, I watched a couple of movies. I watched all Boston guy movies, Mark Walberg. I watched the one with him and the rock. I did fall asleep because I was trying to stay awake. That has nothing to do with the movie. I loved any move up fucking weight lifting. It's got mark Walberg in it, right? That takes me back to the 80s when nobody did squats and everybody just kept fucking, you know, doing upper body, upper body. Um, I got a friend of mine, comedian, uh, it, Boston, Wayne Brevity's stories. Talk about that. How back in the day nobody used to fucking do squats and then you just put on your puffy pants. You see Kava reaches over there to try to make it look like you had thighs,

Speaker 4:          00:53:19       video. Um, so anyways, I watched that one. Uh, whatever that movie was. I never remember the names. Then I watched the, uh, the Matt Damon movie where he's in the future and they put that thing in, that bionic shit around them. Fucking great movie. Just fuck. That's a, that's a great fucking movie. I, I stand by both of those. And also I watched a movie called, uh, called drinking buddies that, um, Jesus Christ, I never watched a movie. It was about dating and that type of thing. I never watched a movie where I felt like, uh, I was kind of every guy in the movie, you know what I mean? Like the guy sneaking around fucking around the guy, the PSAP taking back, the girl that's fucked around, the guy wants to commit, but can't the guy who fucking not committing the whole God damn thing. Um, it was a really, I really enjoyed that movie and it had a, who's had gotten it?

Speaker 4:          00:54:20       Olivia Wilde, uh, Jake Johnson, who I fucking worked with on, um, AH, Jesus Christ new girl.

Speaker 4:          00:59:24       What are we doing here? Let's go to the next one. Sparkling water. The next email here. A sparkling fucking water bill pickles. Oh, I get it till tickles bill a dope deal tickles. Dill pickles. Bill pickles again. It all right. There's no one, there is a new one. My friends, he said I saw in one of your tweets that you were upset about accidentally ordering sparkling water. Yeah, that happened to me when I was in, I was in London, uh, going to eight round connected any from

Speaker 2:          00:59:58       okay.

Speaker 4:          00:59:58       You know, they, they put it in the clear bottle. It looks just like water. And you know when you're in a different country like shit gets hard shit. You just take for fucking grant like that. I never accidentally, I very rarely do. I accidentally grabbed sparkling water when I'm uh, in the states here. Cause I know Poland Spring, I know, I know what the fuck bottled water, there's still shit looks like. But, uh, that is the most amazing thing. When you, when you travel abroad, is this part of your brain you have to use that you, you'd never use? Like I never realized how much shit I recognized just out a color.

Speaker 2:          01:00:34       MMM.

Speaker 4:          01:00:36       And then all of a sudden you go overseas and he just like, all right, is that a taxi or a police car? You know, this, is that a pharmacy or are they selling clothes? And I'm not even joking because the way that some of the stores look over, over, over, uh, overseas, they, they, this style that they'll do the store in, that's their style for a fucking pharmacy. All the pharmacies are pretty easy over there cause they have a, they have a neon green like cross. It's really easy to find. So that's probably a bad one. But anyways, yeah. So anyways, he goes, I hope you come around on this score. It's never too late to change.

Speaker 2:          01:01:10       MMM.

Speaker 4:          01:01:11       Oh, I think this guy's just telling me that he likes sparkling water. Well, Jesus Christ. Bill, why don't you just read the fucking thing so we can all find out? All right. He said, you know, men have great character and sophistication, have long been enjoying sparkling water. Oh Jesus Christ. Well, let me go dress up for this fucking email. This guy sitting there with his legs crossed where and it was an ascot does that and he said, he says it's a satisfying bevy that you can drink endless quantities and endless quantities of why you battle the temptations of various other addictions. Like when you're off the bottle, I highly recommend reaching for a bottle of San Pellegrino and as a punch that plain water or fruit juice just can't give you, it's like hard alcohol in the sense that it's an acquired taste, uh, on top of the hard alcohol. A Nice, I can't, I don't know how to is Cheryl Steiner mixes wonderfully with alcohol's of all kinds. My preference being vodka and Whiskey, it's a much better mix than fruity juices and sodas and all that other,

Speaker 2:          01:02:17       uh,

Speaker 4:          01:02:18       pussy shit

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       just cuts a bit. It's like water. Water is bad ass big brother. I remember you saying that you don't drink coffee. He was saying you've missed out on all that coffee house posts. He over the years. So this is one pairing that I probably can sell you on. Um,

Speaker 4:          01:02:38       what, so this is one pairing that I probably can't sell you on, but an espresso drink, no sugar with a Perrier air to hydrate you. Fucking delightful. Or I know you've been to Italy and antipasto plate with a glass of wine and a glass of sparkling water. Uh, Bueno. I hope I said that right. I don't have one off. B u. O n o uh, love the stand up. Love the podcast as a working poor type nine to five or the podcast makes Monday almost bearable. Look at you getting all fucking, he goes, wait for the Canadians hockey cities dates here in Montreal. Not a habs fan. Uh, senators fan. All right. Um, yeah, I do it. I don't like drinking carbonated shit. I think it makes you bloated and makes you fat for no fucking reason. And you should be drinking water. Uh, I'm not into the shit and when I'm off the bottle I just get off the bottle totally. And I drink water. And then I looked down and my stomach getting flatter every day and I fucking enjoy it. But uh, yeah, I'm just not a a, I'm not a sparkling water guy and I'm just not, I don't like the shit. Uh, if I'm going to drink something carbonated, I'll have a soda or pop or a pap is they see in the Midwest and what do I like? I like the Mexican cocacola that has the real sugar and I like 'em.

Speaker 4:          01:03:59       I like Orange Soda, but only if that has the good sugar too. Um, all right, dude, the jet lights hit me here. I'm just fucking talking about what kinds of soda I fucking like. Uh, all right. Opposite of Anorexia. Yeah. Speaking of which, I mentioned earlier that I gained some weight here. Opposite of Anorexia. Hey, they've built, I think I might have the opposite of Anorexia because when I look in the mirror, I see a skinny guy. While I've trained with pushups and weights and gain like 10 pounds right now I am 18 years old, six two and 187 pounds, which should be normal. Also, when I look at my classmates, classmates, I seem bigger and more muscular. But when I'm home and stare in the mirror, I just seem skinny. Anyways. Love your podcasts. Greetings from Holland. Yeah, Dude. Um,

Speaker 4:          01:04:51       opposite of Anorexia. I don't know what that means. Yeah, but you got some sort of body issue, dude. If he's six, two, one 87, yeah, you look, you look fine and you're also 18 years old, you're going to fill out. Um, my suggestion is to look into the mirror and override those negative thoughts and think something positive. And I got to tell you, dude, when you get older, okay, and you've got to go to the gym for two fucking weeks to get yourself looking halfway decent. And then you have one French and it negates all two weeks that you did. You're going to fucking look back and go, God, remember when I was six to when I was 187 pounds for the love of God. Enjoy this period of your life as much as you can because there's no way to enjoy it fully the way some old bastard like me could.

Speaker 4:          01:05:34       Um, because I know what it's like now to fucking do all the work I did and then go away for a couple of fucking weeks and come back and look like, oh my God, dude, I fucking pat on a pullover sweater the last fucking night. And I took a picture with somebody and I was sucking in my gut and I still look like a fucking, ah, I knew it. Somebody took a picture of me when I was at Iceland and I saw, I'm getting, I'm getting my fat head back again. It killed me. So Dude, you're killing it. You're six to, yeah, 187 pounds. You're 18 years old. He got your whole life ahead of you. You should just be focusing on finding fucking places to go. Have a good time. All right, go up, go chat up the most beautiful women you can find it.

Speaker 4:          01:06:19       Just have a great fucking time. All right, put looking in the mirror. Think and you're some fucking skinny loser. You're not all right. You're a God damn fucking rocks. You're the rock star a year of your life right now. All right. And then don't use this as some negative of goods. Little Down Hill from here. Stop being a fucking pussy. Go out and enjoy your goddamn like you look great. You son of a bitch. Go Fuck Yourself. All right. Accidentally racist. Hey Bill, I was waiting in line, uh, for the Water Fountain at my gym with a buddy and this African American guy was taking forever to fill up his gallon size water bottle. Don't you fucking hate people to do that at the gym? Cheap, cheap fuckers. I get that. You're doing it. I get it. But if you see somebody behind you, you got to gallon water ball. Maybe it was just the bigger one.

Speaker 4:          01:07:06       You know what? You'd be a good shit. Turn around and be like, can you just getting a drink? Yeah, let me step aside, you know, be a fucking asshole. You know what that's like? That's like people who stand in the middle of sidewalks with four other friends and have conversations and the whole world has to walk around them or they do it in the airport. If you're stopping and you, you're, you're going to make your flight. Are you trying to figure out where the fuck you supposed to be? We'll go grab the wall, get over to the fucking wall. Let people, you know, if your car fucking breaks down, if it's safe to do it, fucking push it to the side of the road. You dumb cunt. All right. Sorry. Anyways, he goes, I was getting impatient as you should have. He goes, I remembered that the gym recently got rid of, of a separate fountain with a big nozzle so you could fill up a water bottle quicker. So I remarked to my buddy, didn't they used to have separate fountains for these people? Oh Shit. Oh No. He goes before my buddy can respond. The African American guy turns around and says, excuse me, Q foot and mouth.

Speaker 3:          01:08:14       Okay,

Speaker 4:          01:08:14       so the best accidentally

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       racist story you've got.

Speaker 4:          01:08:19       Uh, wait a minute, dude. Yeah. I hope you explain that to them. Uh, you know what? I have to think accidentally, right? I know I've done that. I know I've done that way. I, what did I do that, oh, I remember when I was in DC, I just made a joke in the guy, didn't find it funny and then I felt like a fucking asshole.

Speaker 3:          01:08:40       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:08:41       Um, it was right after Obama got elected, I was in DC and I was fucking hammered and I was coming back to this hotel with Joe to Rosa. And, uh, the security guy who was black, African American said something to me. And as a joke, I go, oh, what the president is black now civil. And I'm hammered. And I thought he was going to laugh. And he stared at me like all my, like this is a white person who actually thinks this shit. And I was like, I was just fucking around Joe's like dragging me away. Like I went, like it was a joke that would've worked if I was sober and I was in a comedy club and I'd set it up right. But I didn't, oh. And I kind of fucking knew the guy, but I didn't know the guy. It was three in the morning. I was drunk and it like, dude, it was fucking horrific. And I, and it kills me that I wasn't able to explain myself cause I guarantee that that guy's still fucking at least told that story for two weeks. So, um, I dunno, that's actually a good top. If anybody else has accidentally racist

Speaker 4:          01:09:42       shit. Oh my God. That's too, that's like I would submit that to fucking Larry David. It doesn't that seem like an episode of his Shell. You know, that had happened in the beginning. Like you don't just whining that he has to go to the gym and all that Shit. Bitch moaning and complaining. He sees the guy with the water bottle and then the misdirection is, he talks about how cheap these people are and he actually defends the gym for all the water that they're using. Um, and then when he shows up, it's gone. And then he stands behind. I mean the whole fucking thing is right there. Hey, put that music underneath it. He got yourself an episode. All right. Ski Lodges a there. Billy Bunny Hill. Uh, what's, should take, what's your take a good weekend. Come on people, you know, I can't read out loud. Can you, can you at least help me by at least trying to put all the words from the sentence in the fucking email? What's your take? I'm going to guess on a good weekend of bagging snow bunnies and drinking hot chocolate. What's my take on it? What that sounds like. One of those fucking titty movies I watched when I first got cable. What, what?

Speaker 3:          01:10:52       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:10:53       What? Take what I have on our other than that's fucking awesome. He goes, the occasional outdoor hot tub seen wood fires and turtlenecks, some marijuana and monopoly washed down with the dark red. I don't even ski, but if I ever start, it's to be able to live in that dumb and dumber aspen type scene. Oh, absolutely. Somebody asked me recently, asked me if I skied and I said, I told them that story. How I, when I was in that was in Utah with Jay lie ahead and we stayed an extra day and went skiing up in, uh, what did they do? That film festival Sundance. We were up around there. We went skiing up there and it was great. But I, I don't like skiing. I love the workout and I love all that aspect that you're talking about. Like a calming down and they got the fire going and you drink beers. Dude, it's fucking awesome. But I have just never participated in a more blow your knee out. Fucking sport did skiing, but uh, just your description there like that right there is why I want to go. Um,

Speaker 3:          01:11:58       okay

Speaker 4:          01:11:58       as fuck. And it's just, that's the shit. Who's that guy? That guy there. The guy in Holland. There you are the six foot two one eight s on an 87 pounds. There you go. Go skiing, go scale. This is what you should be doing instead of fucking staring at yourself in the mirror going, oh, I'm ugly, I'm too skinny. Fuck that. Do this shit.

Speaker 3:          01:12:18       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:12:19       You know what? I want to buy all the skiing shit in and not go skiing and then just go on the treadmill and get all sweaty and then put the ski and Shit on and just act like I fucking came off the mountain. Wash it down with a dark red. How good does that sound? It's 7:34 AM the me. All right. That's the podcast. A what is my take on that? Like I, I think that this is what I would do. Take skiing lessons. Something I never did. I was like, whatever. I play hockey dude, I fucking skate. Just shame shit. Nobody's trying to hit you, right? You don't realize that there's trees. You forget that, which is like the, uh, I can't even, it's like a fucking defenseman times like 9 million.

Speaker 4:          01:13:01       You never went in that contact. You never knocked the fucking tree over. You basically die like Sonny Bono or some shit. Um, I just hate when you fall and like one are you skis is going one way and the other's going the other way and it's never a convenient fucking way. You always feel like you got to fucking blow out an ACL. But if you survive and you get down that hill a couple of times, you know what's funny about skiing? I always love when you get to that point where you know you're exhausted and you try to do one more fucking run and you get up there and you're so tired by you get halfway down, you just fall down. Every third time he tried to make a turn, like whatever that fucking acid is that builds up and your muscles in your legs. It just, you're just completely gassed and you're laughing and you're friends laughing at you and you just get down to the fucking mountain.

Speaker 4:          01:13:54       You get to the ski lodge. Hopefully there's not a bunch of cons taken up the whole thing. Um, you know that rich family that has five kids in a can afford to buy them all ski stuff despite the fact that they're all growing and shit. Um, you resent them. They looked like the Kennedy's like, okay, that was fucking blue blooded cons. But if you can somehow get yourself a seat, ah fuck, I want to go. I'm going, I'm, I'm calling up law ahead. I'm going to go skiing over the Christmas break. Fuck this. I'm going, Jesus Christ. Because they did that person. Paint a picture of what? I'm fucking guard. All right, here's the wrap up everybody.
