Speaker 1:          00:00:52       Oh, I can't yell. My daughter's asleep. Fuck, I'm taping this at night. Sunday night. Um, the potato sweet potato pie killed. I think I gave out some misinformation. I just bought the wrong kind of sweet potato. I bought a, uh, it was the white one, which I'm hurt. I used for other desserts, but not for the Pi, but people do actually use sweet potatoes for sweet potato pie. You can also actually use yams. That's what I used. Yams, brown sugar, cinnamon, some Nutmeg, a little bit of ginger. Um, some vanilla, whatever, and a whole bunch of sugar stirred the whole thing together. And I tell you, I was sweating it. Okay. Fucking white guy making a sweet potato pie, you know what I mean? I mean, I'm living dangerously here. I thought it was going to get booed like at the Apollo and uh, maybe people were just being nice, but I think, uh, I think everybody liked it. Um, so I was psyched. And then my stuffing always kills. I stuffing always kills. You know why? Because it starts off with me melting as an entire stick of butter in a pan. That's where, and I go from there.

Speaker 1:          00:02:02       I don't care what you make and you can't lose if you start by melting a stick of butter and a parent, you know, um, he's fucking lunatics nowadays. They will take that note. Can I pour that entire thing into my coffee? I don't know what's going on. All right. I have a lot of stuff to promote. I apologize for the AC, but it's as hot as shit in here. I don't know if he can hear that running over my loudest voice here. A bunch of stuff.

So anyways, onto the podcast, well, if I'm going to promote some stuff I might as well promote a few other things, is a speaking of comedians and I got to get her on this benefit one of these years. A good friend of mine from way back in the day, it became a film maker and is now back is back then when stand up Maya to Giorgio. Um, absolutely fucking hilarious. And I was talking to you that night at the comedy store. I didn't realize. I told her, uh, you know, my, I really fucked.

Speaker 1:          00:05:13       I really fucked up my side big time by playing drums. I think I already told you guys, that's how I was down there and I was just telling her that, you know how I messed it up and then I re screwed it up by playing drum. She's like, I didn't eat, play drums and I used to play drums. I started talking to her mother, used to be this famous jazz singer and she played at the cotton club and all this stuff, the real jazz gigs and shit. Sit in with all these legends. Started talking, all this drum stuff. And she's a great comedian. Anyway, she's going to be a December six. She's going to be at levity live in Oxnard, California, which is just outside of La. It's a Wednesday night. Um, she's just fucking awesome. So definitely check it out. I'll have the link up there for that.

Speaker 1:          00:05:55       And lastly, Judah Freelander has a new special on Netflix called America is the greatest country in the United States. And me and Nia was sitting in bed watching it really low on the volume because you know, our lovely daughter's sleeping in the other room and just cracking up. It's fucking hilarious. It's brilliant. I haven't seen him in so long because he's a New York guy and I'm a big La phony here. And um, I sent him a text. I told him how he, that guy is fucking brilliant man. Uh, definitely check it out. It's so cool the way he shot it. It looks like almost lead us in black and white. And probably there was a couple of I iPhones. It's just shot over the course of, I don't know how many months of him screwing around doing bits fucking with the crowd, you know, and he just would just would cut out and just say, the seller, this date, the seller, that date all shot at the seller.

Speaker 1:          00:06:53       It's, uh, it's really, it's really different. It's awesome. Judah Freelander America is the greatest country in the United States. All right, that's it. Let's get into the end of the podcast here. All right, let's dig in to the God damn podcast. Um, in a good way. I did not do shit this weekend. I didn't do shit other than this morning. I woke up and I got all my tax shit. You know, I do it at the end of every month. I just get all my stupid receipts. I organize them so I don't have a fucking avalanche, you know, April 14th to go through and throw it my accountant and make his life miserable. I don't do that. End of every month, like a little old lady, you know, I try to balance the books. I just do all of that. And then all I have to deal with is whatever bullshit I did in the last 30 days, rather than having to deal with 365 days.

Speaker 1:          00:07:48       It's the smartest fucking thing I've ever done. Because I remember, I remember back when I used to live with Bobby Kelly, right? We would sit in and, and you know, we would do like a zillion spots a week. You know, on the weekend you'd have like six, seven, eight spots a night, you know, and I was working uptown and downtown, so I'd have all these cab receipts and have all of these receipts from College Gigs, Club gigs, bus tickets, train tickets, all of this shit shoved in like four different cvs bags by the end of the year. And, you know, we had to do our own taxes back then or whatever. I remember we would just be sitting there with this shitty fucking coffee table with our giant plastic bags of receipts. I can't do it. Why did we do this? Why did we fuck it? Why didn't we just along the way, at least just to have an envelope that said taxi receipts that I would try it every year.

Speaker 1:          00:08:47       You know, in a good year I'd make it to march, you know, but I never made it for the whole year. Most years I wouldn't even make it into February. And I've just be like, yeah, fuck it. Um, but this year, finally, years later, 25 years into my career, finally I finally been doing it. And, uh, I kinda know where shit is, like major shit, life insurance and stuff like that. I kind of know where it is. Like I know it's in one of two different places. I don't know which folder, but um, it's really made my life a lot easier. Um, or who's kidding, who? My wife if make her life easier, if I ever die, it's like, it's either in that boxer, in that box and it's sort of organized.

Speaker 3:          00:09:30       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:09:32       So anyways, yeah, I did not do shit this weekend. Still didn't drink. I made it through. I did not drink. So I'm up to 102 days. By the time you listened to some it triple digits over there, I'm like fucking, well chambal it of being sober. I got him by two fucking days. Two points.

Speaker 3:          00:09:49       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:09:51       Yeah. It wasn't that, it wasn't that bad. No one was really drinking. So the temptation wasn't really there.

Speaker 3:          00:09:57       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:09:59       And once the night was over and my daughter was awesome and she didn't cry nothing. She's just like, she's so cool, man. He's so chill. She's so, you know, when people, people actually say that when she gets upset, she looks like me. That's when she looks like me. You know what I mean? And as much as that hurts me to hear that, I know it's true. So anyways, um, I ended up, uh, I, you know, when I'm home, I usually am the one that puts her to bed. I actually really enjoyed doing it and I haven't down to a whole system. And the worst part is after they fall asleep in your arms and he got to set them down in the Crim and then they cry for a little bit and just walking away knowing that fine, no one, they just crying there. Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:10:46       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:10:48       That's the hard part. But, uh, I actually enjoy her falling asleep, you know, laying on my arm so much that I usually let it go for like an extra 20 minutes, cause I figured some day, you know, she's going to be like, Oh my God, Dad, God, you're so embarrassing. I'm, I'm really trying to take all of this shit in. So, um, anyways, I put her to bed and uh, was watching around the little video and then I went out on my back porch and I smoked arguably the best cigar of the year.

Speaker 1:          00:11:22       It was just perfect. You know, it was thanksgiving. It was an event. So there was no guilt of like, look at me smoking a cigar. What am I, some bomb at a track. I said, I smoked it. It was fucking delicious, delicious. So couldn't have gone any better. And just when I thought my weekend couldn't get all any better, I decided to watch every college fucking football game I could get my eyeballs on. And I did. And it did. I see some bright ones who, please tell me, please tell me you son of a bitch that you fucking sat down and you watch the war on I four interstate for that runs between the two underrated cities of Tampa in Orlando, Florida. They don't get any respect. You know, you gotta be on the East Coast and south of Lake Okeechobee to get any respect and Florida. And even then, they still laugh at you if just if you're living in Fort Lauderdale, right?

Speaker 1:          00:12:20       You're up north on Daytona beach. They all know you're doing math right. You gotta be down in Miami. I got a buddy of mine forced Shaw. He's going to be on my shows out there enough Florida. I'm doing a show in Hollywood, Florida and in Orlando going to a magic game in between knocking off another team and uh, he's a Miami guy. So I was trashing him. I was making fun of Miami. I was like, dude, every guy in Miami is either a drug dealer or a promoter or both. I know that isn't true, but I just like trash in places that I enjoy going to. Who doesn't like Miami? Um, anyways, so interstate four runs between Tampa and uh, and uh, Orlando and I watched that game deck game was fucking, it was like watching a god, this was like a video game.

Speaker 1:          00:13:08       I can't, I can't even remember what the fucking score was. It was like 42 35 and I got to tell you something with some of the fastest, most athletic to the fastest, most athletic teams I've seen in a long time. I don't know that, I don't know if they're not division one. I don't know what their deal is. I don't know where they are. But I know this, I've seen a lot of like good players come out of south Florida, central Florida. Um, so I don't know what happened. Maybe they fucked up in high school, you know, punched a teacher. I don't know what happened, but these guys look like they could take on anybody granted at the same, I don't fucking know. It looked great. Okay. Everybody was flying around the field. So you know, there was very few white people out there. You know what I'm saying here? Um, so, uh, I'm watching this game. It's 42 35 and C um, central Florida is trying to be the first team ever in that conference or whatever to to ever go winless and within two years go undefeated.

Speaker 1:          00:14:06       So they have a chance to do what? They go up 42 like 35 or some shit and there's like a minute and a half left, right? What are you going to do? You're going to go into the prevent. You're going to give up the whole, the first fucking 80 yards and then you're going to go into, then you're going to start finally playing defense, right? You know, I hate the fucking prevent defense, but guests, guess what central Florida does? Evidently they didn't go into the prevent cause inexplicably. Somehow this fucking guy got behind their defense with a minute and a half left for like a 70 80 yard touchdown, which by the way, it was like a 20 yard pass and then he just ran 50 yards. So I immediately tweet and all caps. How the fuck do you let that happen? As I'm finishing the tweet and hitting scent, it's now tied 42 42 south Florida kicks the fucking ball off. A stunned stadium of central Florida fans are watching going, can we at least get down to field goal position? Did we just fucking blow our whole season. Fucking dude on central Florida catches the ball debt kickoff and ran the fucking thing back.

Speaker 4:          00:15:12       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:15:13       So then I had to tweet again. How the fuck do you let that happen? So now it was like 49, 42. I'm sure I got the score wrong with [inaudible]. They both in the forties and then I'm sitting there going, well those two places so fucked up. They did easily. Central Florida could run this fucking ball back of south Florida, I should say. Um, they didn't, and, and the game ended, but Jesus Christ one an entertaining game. And then the next day I watched Michigan, Ohio state, and then I watched the iron bowl, um, and watch Auburn beat Alabama and uh, watching Michigan for us, Ohio state. I've come to the conclusion that I fucking hate quarterbacks who run. I hate a running quarterback. I just can't, I can't fucking stand it. Yeah, no, I don't think it should be legal for a quarterback to run. All right.

Speaker 4:          00:16:07       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:16:07       Or if you run, then you get treated like a running back. This whole fucking thing that you can wait until everybody, everybody covers. They called the right defense. Nobody's open and then you can just take off running and when nobody's fucking looking, that's all well and good, but you should get stuck. But it's all like he gave himself up. He threw himself on the ground. Leave him alone. Fuck you. Fuck you. If you're going to take off running, you should get stuck. Either that or keep your fucking fucking running around to ask behind the God damn line. It's fucking driving me crazy. I'm a Michigan Fan, so I'm watching that shit and Michigan's fucking defense was lights out and that fucking cunt kept running eight yards, nine yards. Guy couldn't complete a pass. He couldn't feel pressure, but he could fucking run. And then when he ran there to be like, Ooh, he's a quarterback. If I was coaching for the other team, I'd be like, listen, he hit the fucking guy. Take the, take the penalty. I don't give a shit. I'm not saying deliberately energy him, but fucking hit him. I don't care.

Speaker 1:          00:17:20       Now it drives me up. It drives me up. The congratulations to a house. I don't hate Ohio state or whatever. I'm just more of a Michigan Fan. Um, and Michigan's just in a weird year, I don't know what their deal is. I mean, they, they don't have their quarterback. I hate trash and college players cause there's still kids or whatever. But he could've had a better game. He was a little amped up in the beginning and I don't know what happened on that last play. I think a miscommunication. Maybe the guy broke off the pattern or whatever cause it will be just fucking threw it to the guy. But, um, Jim Harbaugh, oh, in three. Oh, in three against Ohio state. You're telling me his wife had a good fucking weekend. So he comes home with this fucking woody Hayes glasses all steamed up.

Speaker 4:          00:18:04       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:18:06       But Jesus Christ at Defense Michigan's defense was great. Um, and how about that kid that came in after, uh, Ohio state's quarterback went down. He played great, and he could throw the ball, he could throw the ball and run. Um, so maybe they've got a future with him. I have no idea. And then I, you know, my, I got a buddy Jay law head is a big Ohio state guy, so he's always arguing the case as to why or how Iowa state should be in the fucking off every, he did it to me last shift fucking talking to me. He tried to explain to me how our hio state should be.

Speaker 4:          00:18:38       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:18:38       In, in the, the, the, the, the 14 play off and it's like two they lost to Penn state. Penn State won the big 10 championship. Penn state does it make it in, but Ohio state does. He goes, yeah, I'll tell you why. Strength of schedule early fucking does all the fucking math. And then what happens? They play Clemson and they get the old right there, Fred, right. 31 to nothing. You know, somebody else should have been in there. So I love Jay. He was doing that to me again the other day via text. And I'm just laugh at thinking like, dude, he's always talking about how Alabama stinks and there's nobody fucking in the sec. It's like the big 10 sucks. The big 10 still sucks. It's not that good. Penn state was overrated. They were overrated. They lost the White House state and it was a huge fucking winter. Then the very next week, what happened? I always stayed Pete's Penn state, the next fucker week, Penn state loses to Michigan State and Ohio state gets fucking raped rate by fucking Iowa. So I dunno, he's always talking about how weak the SCC is. It's like, dude, get the fuck outta here. Wouldn't look at the big 10

Speaker 4:          00:19:44       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:19:45       Jesus Christ. How many teams you got laying down every week? Rutgers, Indiana. Purdue, Northwestern. A fucking Minnesota. I hate to say Nebraska, but that they're no good. That's six fucking t's right there in Michigan state is always half ass. Oh Man, I'm going to get some fucking mail this week in Michigan. Isn't that good? There's still trying to put it together. So who the fuck are you playing out there? I don't get it. You know?

Speaker 4:          00:20:15       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:20:16       look at fucking Auburn. Auburn beat Georgia when Georgia was number one and now they beat Alabama in Alabama was number one. So Alabama is number one. They take a loss in the last game of the season. So now at they out, the whole fucking thing is just, it's just a, a symptom of the game. You can't have the march madness because everybody would be getting concussions and ruining million dollar fucking careers. So this is the best system we got. So I guess it creates arguing, but I got to tell you, um,

Speaker 1:          00:20:46       yeah, what a fucking, I've just, the college football was fucking amazing. Then I watched a little bit and I never watched PAC 12. I watched Lou, that Washington, Washington state, Jesus Christ, a bunch of players on those teams too. Um, and for some reason my wife just let me do it. You know, it's funny, we actually, we went out shopping after the Michigan fucking Ohio state game and I was so fucking pissed, so fucking pissed. Cause I just felt like Michigan, they had a better defense, they should have one. And they just kept doing that little cunty fucking eight yards scamper for a first down to keep the fucking drive alive was driving me crazy. Um, and then, uh, I dunno. And then he just went out and I just like, you know, I don't know why I get that into games, but you know, my, my laugh could sense it and I just said, yeah, listen, I just fucking, you know, I just watched the game.

Speaker 1:          00:21:42       I did not like the outcome. Right. It's because Jesus Christ. All right, so then we're walking around, okay, we're with all these people like you know, Christmas shopping and shit and you know, there was this group of fucking Asian people, I dunno. I Dunno. They will for whatever reason, we're walking down the sidewalk like 17 people across and we were behind them and they were walking like half a mile an hour. I don't know if they just got done eating Thanksgiving dinner. I don't know what it was, but I was having what this comic, I used to know John Bush used to call it walk rage instead of road rage.

Speaker 1:          00:22:22       He's to do this great bit about having walked rage in New York City. And I was just sitting there like, how the fuck do you not? I mean, I get it there. There's a whole family, they were with their grandparents, you know, an agent. People respect their elders. They're not like Americans where we would have thrown those old people in the home and we would have picked up the pace when we walked down the street. So I was trying to respect their culture, but at the end of the day, I'm selfish. So I was just like, ah, what the fuck. We finally get by him and my daughter didn't want to be in the fucking stroller, so I got her out and I'm carrying in my ribs a fucking talking to me and one of my shoulders is fucked up, man. I'm a mess, right? I'm like, you know, I'm like a fucking journeyman quarterback, right?

Speaker 1:          00:23:10       No, I'm like Steve Drogan at the end of his career, I should have been walking around with like that fucking neck brace. So I'm already grumpy. And then this lady's kid is having a fucking temper tantrum and was stopped at the, at the red light waiting to walk across the street, and this kid is hitting this fucking note that is making my ears, which are junk from playing drums, vibrate in this painful way that's making my teeth hurt. So Nia goes, hey, we can cross up here and right as I do that though, fucking woman with the screaming kid heard it too and started following me and has a say aviation. She was a beam up my fucking left eardrum, which means just right alongside of it. And I just, I was walking away and I couldn't see. She was right, but I couldn't understand why it wasn't getting quieter and that she came, I turned around, I saw that she was following this up there, and I just, I, I snapped, I snapped.

Speaker 1:          00:24:05       I was under my breath. Caught Jesus fucking Christ. Can you just fucking get that fucking kid a fuck away from me? I was, go near. Stop. Just let him go past Jesus. Fucking cool. You know, it was, it was completely irrational. I was 100% wrong, but, uh, it was just all those things building up. And like I said, I already walk around at a six, so it's very easy for me to get back up to a 10. So, uh, Nia, stop talking to me. And uh, then I was like, ah, here we go. You know? And then I was a baby about it. I'm like, Oh really? Dooley, I should have a football game. I'm driving over here. We just bought this. I did this. I took the fucking garbage Joe.

Speaker 3:          00:24:43       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:24:47       Just cause I drop a bunch of f bombs in public about some other woman's crying kid, you know, I did the dishes. That's not a push. That's not a wash, you know? I thought like, I thought that all balanced it out. So, you know, I put up a good fight on the ride home and then I find just a mess. Like, yeah, right. You're right. I'm just arguing because I know you're writing. I'm embarrassed. I shouldn't have done that. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:25:12       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:25:14       What do you, what are you going to do? I mean, they wrote a song about me a long time ago. Huh? I'm not a perfect person.

Speaker 3:          00:25:23       Um, yeah. I don't know why I did that.

Speaker 1:          00:25:27       You know, something I would go to fucking anger management, but I just don't feel like telling my stories all over again. I've already gone to therapy. I just don't, you know, you're gonna Retell these fucking things,

Speaker 3:          00:25:38       you know,

Oh, I know you don't give a fuck about that. I'll read that one. All right. Emily Linden tweets. You don't want to do this one? No, I dunno. Alright, what does, who is Emily London? I didn't know who he was. Tell she was either. She somebody on the Twitter sphere. Okay. She, she's uh, she's got, um, social media. She tweeted some a shit about, I don't know, some shit. I don't know. Okay. Hey, the fair trail.

Speaker 5:          00:44:32       Um, I imagine you've been sent this article many times over the last week I had, here's an excerpt from an article about what the writer for Teen Vogue tweeted. A, here's an unpopular opinion. I'm not actually all that concerned about innocent men losing their jobs over false sexual assault slash harassment allegations. The benefit of all of us getting to finally tell the truth. Plus the impact on victims far capital's far outweighs the loss of any one man's reputation. He said adding, if some innocent men's reputation have to take a hit in the process of undoing the patriarchy. That is the price I am absolutely willing to pay. It's hilarious. You're not paying a price in that. That innocent guy is, um, the most cognitive cause I didn't say the word. So stupid critique of Linden came from CNN anchored Jake tapper. The lead host tweeted, well, this is CNN.

Speaker 5:          00:45:35       There's bad as Fox News. I'm guessing you didn't get a good grade for your seventh grade book report on to kill a Mockingbird, uh, referencing the classic novel that features the trial of a black man falsely accused of rape in the 1930s, Alabama. Um, you said if some innocent men's reputation have to take a hit in the process, fun doing the patriarchy, that is a price, same. Absolutely willing to pay. That's immoral. Tapper wrote, and it's not a price you would be paying by the way. It would be an innocent, innocent men doing that. Um, all right. He said, my wife is black, is back to the guy running. My wife is black and she has a cousin who served six months in jail for being falsely accused of rape. He lost his academic scholarship, academic, not sports scholarship, and has been having trouble getting his life back on track since having his conviction overturned from being physically and emotionally abused in jail.

Speaker 5:          00:46:29       She said, uh, that is she ever wait. She said that if she ever saw this woman in public, she and I quote, slapped the Shit Outta that irresponsible cont bill I've never heard of or used the c word or even threatening violence against anyone. It's like that light. Now you just go in a completely different direction. That line from Batman, the dark night, you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain. All right. You're all over the place. I don't know what's going on here. Um, what do I think that, I think that's the tweets have somebody young. Uh, and, and also it's kind of seems, it's a little WWE wrestling, grandstanding, knowing there's no way you write that, not knowing, you know, it's like watching down, you know, the, the Tories guy there and the MMA guy, the crazy shit. He says he knows what he's doing. Yeah. And then everyone's like, oh, this guy's too cocky. I want to watch it moves. And then, then he wins and he gets your money. I think that that's a, I think that's all this is, uh,

Speaker 8:          00:47:33       white feminism. So that's pretty much womanism. Yeah. I mean that's pretty much, this is why people don't like being labeled a feminist because of stuff like that. Not Elaborate. Nah. That's all I'm going to say about it.

Speaker 5:          00:47:52       I feel like nobody white and knows what you're talking about. But everybody black right now does, oh my God, was that shade? Am I woke? Um, yeah. I mean that's just one of those that, I dunno.

Speaker 5:          00:48:09       I don't know. What do you do you know what? That's how she feels. That's how she feels. What am I supposed to, am I supposed to actually respond to that? Like that's like some sort of rational human being. What do you mean what this person foaming at the mouth. I Dunno. They remind me of myself when you think of this complete. Yeah. And yet can I make this any more easier for you? I love how you, you will only wanted to fucking respond to the ones that were easy and then when to give you a chance to respond to you. Like you like bill Bellacheck lion off. She's a, yeah, it's white phone is, I know so. Cause you know, but I, I, but I can elaborate. I can get into these next to elaborate.

Speaker 8:          00:48:44       I don't want to, I don't want to him why, I dunno. Maybe I am being a worse, but I just, uh, yeah, it's, that's, I dunno, there's really no other way for me explain it then to say that that's, it's just you, it's a level of,

Speaker 4:          00:49:01       okay,

Speaker 8:          00:49:03       not nice not, or they're not naive.

Speaker 4:          00:49:07       They're not

Speaker 8:          00:49:10       like maybe just in a bubble or something. Just like, so sheltered, sheltered. So it's like all they can focus on is like the one thing, you know what I mean? And they just can't quite grasp.

Speaker 4:          00:49:25       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:49:25       Well that's a joke I do on my act when, when like when I listen to feminists, like it's hard for me to listen to white women in the United States of America complaining, like going, do you know, you know what it's like to be me a slightly less awesome than what my life is. Like. If you look at the big picture, uh, I'm sure that seems to be a giant gap between me and you, but if you look at everybody else's situation, we were at what kind of sitting on the same stone here. So why don't you buy a run around the lady? All right. I'm sorry. Am I a rebound chump? Is this good idea? Is this in your wheel house? Yeah, I think so. Keep going. You'd be a great president. This is what president is due now. They like, they basically, I don't like the way that guy asked questions. Let's bring this person in. You don't have time for everything. So you gotta you gotta weed through? No, I do have to have time for all of these. You don't have time. Yeah. I'm not talking about you were talking about me. Can we read this one? This one? Okay.

Speaker 7:          00:50:56       I mean, I don't care what he thinks about anything, but I wonder what he would think about your podcast as far as what? I don't know. Like do you think he would be into it or not?

Speaker 7:          00:51:06       Even though you trash them, you trash everybody. I think he's busy running the country. I don't think he's listening to fucking nuts by the way that he tweets. He's clearly not that fucking busy. He's not that busy. Who has time to tweet the petty shit that he does? He's got what's great about Twitter it takes to doing all of this. The actual stuff. He is just sitting there like, you know the uh, what do you call it? The spa like, I don't know. I don't know what the fuck. He's just, he's working. He's got me all, he's working Obama. Bill Clinton Work J. Yeah, that cigar. He worked at rogue up.

Speaker 7:          00:51:43       I just get all flustered. I can't even speak straight anyway. Come on. Am I rebound chump? Is Trump really that bad, dear Billy forehead? So I just like getting me going. I just like get it ahead. It's really, I mean, I don't know. You gotta give the guy and shit cause it was hot as fuck in here. You're usually the one who runs hot.

Like if you're going to leave the house, everything has to be perfect. Oh my feet are together. Rub them together like your shoe. You're always are.

Speaker 5:          00:52:35       Are we ready? Okay. Yes. Huge Fan of your comedy in the podcast. Hearing you shoot the shit every week obviously makes me laugh, but also gives me insight and other things. Anyways, it's hard to find. All right. I get too many clock minutes. Thank you. I met this girl, Buddha [inaudible] who's probably the beds are good check. While, why blah blah, blah. I've ever been with. And her personality so far looks just as good. We are both in college and neighboring states, but we hang out a couple of times a week on average. Things have been going great for the past two months. We have traveled around her state and she has shown me places I have never seen. I did not expect anything to bloom like it has and was originally content with just being friends who fuck. However, after getting to know her better, she definitely seems like someone I could stick around with for a while and maybe even date.

Speaker 5:          00:53:23       Um, well what are you guys now? Sightseeing? He just said they're hanging out. Oh, just hanging out. Okay. Sorry. Well, if I have to read and also listen to what I'm saying, like I can't do that. The only thing is it's called reading comprehension. Bebe. Yeah, I'm not good at it. Um, the only thing she has, the only thing, the only thing she has an ex who I suspect she's still hoping we'll come back. All right. Incident one on our second date quote, she rented a movie on an as Amazon on her ex's account and got a text from him asking,

Speaker 10:         00:54:07       okay,

Speaker 5:          00:54:07       what that was about fucking sector about Amazon movie. Wow. Why

Speaker 8:          00:54:14       is she, what was she? What is she doing? All right. That's some bullshit right there. You know good and God damn well you can't order on your ex as account like they're going to, they're still paying for that. Ooh. Sees a little minx the this one,

Speaker 5:          00:54:29       she seemed delighted that he was forced to communicate with her eyes and she wired him money and said, sorry, incident number two. So he's obviously broken up with her fucking dramatic. Oh Yeah, you ready? Okay. Incident number two. She originally stated that they broke up back in February, but one night she let it slip that they had actually broken up in August. Just a couple months ago. I acted like I didn't notice. Good. That's probably good. After banging one night, she starts joking about having a baby and what features it would have. I have brown hair as to she and she ran the, says the baby could be blond, the color of her exes hair. She then went on to say your ex's name was one of her favorite names for a boy. Oh, Jesus Christ. Dude, this is always good. My God, this is like getting ridiculous to the point.

Speaker 5:          00:55:22       I'm starting to not believe it. Thankfully she waited until I finished all my dick and balls would have deflated immediately during all this baby slash x talk incident number four, Jesus Christ, buddy exhibit 1995. Um, she still uses her ex's, Amazon prime account to watch movies, but on two occasions she began snooping through his order history right in front of me, either unaware of how off putting that is, are simply not giving a shit disrespectful to myself and the x in my opinion. Uh, another confusing twist is that she gets pissed off and sad if I referred to her as my friend. We're not in an official relationship, so this, which is just that she is at least kind of interested. But with all this stuff going on about Rx, I think she might just like the attention I provide and I think she may be stringing me along. She is also randomly accused me of using her for attention and having other hose. Uh, neither

Speaker 8:          00:56:24       of which are true. Yeah. You don't sound like it. Yeah. That has a lot of hoes.

Speaker 5:          00:56:27       Sorry for this long email. It's hard to put all this bull shit into words, which you are great at. If the, yeah, he's in the emotional side of this. Maybe me just reading what you just wrote out loud will be enough. If the lovely Nia is nearby, I would love to hear her take as well. Thanks. Uh, and go for a jog once in a while. Yeah. All right. What do you got it?

Speaker 8:          00:56:47       Yeah. This girl is fucking crazy and she's not over her acts and she is using you to get jealous and if you don't mind banging her because she's hot and all that and letting it go, then fine. But if you're starting to catch feelings, I would bail.

Speaker 5:          00:57:00       Wow. You said that nice and quick. I agree with all of that. I concur. That's exactly it. If you could somehow and not get emotionally tied to her and just keep banging her

Speaker 8:          00:57:10       disrespectful as fuck. She is incredibly disrespectful. She does not care about you at all. The things that she is saying and doing in front of you is so ridiculous. Like how are you going to lie in bed with someone and be like, you know when I have a baby, like I ended up this, you know Caleb, because this is also like some white girl shit like halo. I just feel like it'd be the perfect name for a boy and he's the sitting there like, are you serious? Like your ex boyfriend? Oh yeah. You know what? This could be a great mood and he should be on the roof. He should

Speaker 5:          00:57:44       just, I dunno. I think he should just say some just fake listen like I have, but this is one of these people that it's do you don't even say anything to him because it's not going to, they're not going to sit there and be like, Oh wow, I guess you're right. I really shouldn't have done that. Just person. It's not going to give a fuck. So whatever man, you got to bang a hot chick and she's not over the other guy. So who gives a fuck? Thank God you didn't marry or they'll do and thank God that other guy broke up with her cause she seems I don't, granted it's all you

Speaker 8:          00:58:11       talk has the nerve to be mad at him when he called, when he introduces her as a friend, she has the fucking nerve to get mad after all that craziness that she's putting him through. Ah, get outta here.

Speaker 5:          00:58:22       Classic hot chick. Crazy hot chick behavior though. This is classic crazy that I taught that I've taught. I think I told the two weeks ago that hot chick I'd met at the gym and she kept giving me a number and she wanted to go out and I kept trying to get her up but she wouldn't go out with me. Then finally she picks a date and yeah come over, we can hang on Saturday and she goes, Oh, I'm moving kids. She wanted me to help her move and I just burst out laughing. I'm not fucking doing that. And she had some other chump who came over there too. It going to be the two of us standing there. Like maybe if I pick up something heavy can fuck whales is like, she's all yours buddy.

Speaker 8:          00:58:57       Wow. Yeah. I mean I can't knock the hustle, but that's incredibly rude.

Speaker 5:          00:59:03       Yeah, that's the thing. And that's why that right there, that statement, I can't knock the hustle, but that's incredibly rude. That's why. Oh, you're just being funny. Honestly, that's, that's why I, I get all that, that that male feminism horseshit where they just sitting there drinking the fucking Koolaid. Like women just, you know, there aren't

Speaker 7:          00:59:22       as many, just as many fucking absolute sociopath psychos that have vaginas out there is, it's not drinking the Koolaid. They're just saying what they think women want to hear and then they turned out to be fucking assholes. So Jesus Damn, you just really get cut to the chase. So cut to the chase here.

Oh yeah, maybe she goes again and I got an Undergrad, I went to him, you know, just, you know these, they don't like that she celebrates Christmas, which I actually have two Jewish friends to celebrate a Walmart titch to hang out and sat in my overalls, you know, so I know it's so stupid.

I couldn't resist though. Cause sometimes two negatives make a positive.

Speaker 7:          01:04:34       They have a great looking kid. Um, all right. We got into it the other night about it and now she's saying she's not happy in her own skin. Oh God.

She's going to try to get it on real housewives of fucking de Moines, Iowa, wherever the fuck you guys know you should really like if she's really trying to do this, it's her body and it's her choice. She should pay for. If she really, really wants to do it, she should save up her pennies or whatever it is. Save up like $100 a week or whatever the fuck it is. Cut Out all this other stuff, bullshit that she's doing, going out with friends, going out with you, whatever the fuck and she should save up for it and just be like, I don't feel comfortable and get like paying for you to alter your body. That's not something that I, you know, believe in. That's nothing maybe I have the money for.

Speaker 8:          01:06:37       It's like this is your body, this is your choice. And I support you either way, the uh, no, no, no, and I support you either way, but I don't feel comfortable paying for it. It was a sound of a dump truck backing up in the alley that you should just drop her in. Yeah, no, I love you. But this is not, I'm not doing this. I would get all feel comfortable. I gotta be honest with you. Cause those are boundaries right there. And that's not, that's not something you feel comfortable. You are perfectly well within your right to say no to that. And if she has a problem with it, then yeah, I guess she can bounce and she's going be

Speaker 1:          01:07:11       pass those slow self esteem, body issues onto her, onto your fucking kids. It's going to be a nightmare. She needs to go to therapy. Oh I don't know what the fuck she needs to do. But if I was you fuck that. Fuck that. Fuck that you can you sit me and you need to pay for it. Fuck you. That's ridiculous. I would come over there. I would dress up like Santa Claus when I broke up.

Speaker 8:          01:07:37       Whoa, Whoa, whoa. Get the fuck out of my life.

Speaker 1:          01:07:40       I'm spending all my money on me and dude, you need, if you think you're fat and ugly, you could do something about the fat and he can get a fucking personality. So why don't you get all the money she wants you to spend on tits? Wow. Why don't you fucking get a drain? Or I forget a fucking training for yourself, dude. Fucking move on from this train wreck. Give me a AH, Jesus Christ. They almost ruined my fucking thanksgiving. Oh No, I'm just kidding. Anyways, don't listen to me. I'm not trying to take you to fucking break up with it, but that, that, that's a major like, like, what the fuck did you just say to me moment? You know, don't text during the Goddamn podcast.

Speaker 5:          01:08:16       Someone to let them know where we are. What are you having somebody over? But boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop. All right. It's my, it's my ex. I'm using his Netflix account, right the front of you. So fucking deal with it with you would be, you know what I think is a great name? Lamont prog rock. I'm just trying to pick a stereotypical black name from way back in the day. There was nobody named Lamont, by the way, except that guy on a Sanford and son. A boo boo. All right. Progressive Rock. Hey. Oh Billy. Burford uh, glad to hear you're looking to do more progressive rock. Like every genre of music, 99% of it is unimaginably derivative trash and 1% is really unique and well done. Yeah, I like your perspective. Your percentage might be a little harsh. I'd like to think 10% at least as good. Even the good stuff can be off putting at first and just take some time to digest. Uh, like good scotch. It might be harsh to most people at first, but if you put the time and you'll find a lot of interesting shit going on. Uh, early generous genesis is some of my favorite checkout. The tracks, the musical box watch ishe did she wake up?

Speaker 5:          01:09:32       Okay. A watcher of the skies and dancing with the moon lit night. The compositions are complex and beautiful and Phil Calls Collins was really a perfect drama. Yeah, he's one of my favorite drummers of all time. The band also had some amazing tracks like close to the edge, a heart of the sunrise and gates of delirium. Bill Bruford was one of their first was on one of their first few albums and was a beast. All right. You're already mentioned King Crimson. They had some truly great song but always had a few improvised stinkers on each album. Check out 21st century schizo oid man LARCs tongues in aspect part two and starless Bruford his drumming on two of those tracks. Finally, he got to get into magma who was one of the, who has one of the best drummers to have walked the earth. I never heard of this guy, Christian Fandor. It's really his band. He composed all of the music and their sound is totally unique. They sing in an alien language so you don't get distracted by stupid lyrics, but what about their alien language? That sounds like something that sounds like a sketch. Will Ferrell would be an ad almost 70 years old. Vander plays incredibly. They are so good live that I've flown to La and London just to see them play in the past couple of years. I'll have to check this out. Look up live videos of them playing the last seven minutes and zombies, your drum teacher will vouch for them. Ease easy. I'm also psyched to hear you mentioned ms sugar. Uh Oh yeah, they're unbelievable. Uh, they were another

Speaker 7:          01:11:14       one that takes a lot of time to get a feel for, but once you figure out that almost all of their songs are in a strange kind of four, four, they become one of the grooviest bands you've ever heard. And there's no coming back. Enjoy your foray into the weirdness of progressive music. You speckled asshole. That's a good one. Speckle the asshole that said no one. So Nia, how was your thanksgiving? It was delicious. And I don't mean the meal. I mean, how was the weekend? Oh, it's great. Thank you. There you go guys. That's what it come tome to raining positivity. What he just said, that's like a mom too. I was like, great. Thank you. And you said, yeah, that's what I come home. Zoo as if I was to some big negative Nelly. No, you just sounded like I was asking for your autograph as you rush through an airport. Great. Thank you.

Speaker 7:          01:12:13       Do you want me to say, I just want you to throw a roll of paper towels at me. That's what you should've done. Stop it. Get away from me. Uh, get away from me. He doesn't get it hosted. Stop it. Get off of me. I will clean myself. I'm always picking at me. You're a mother now. Go downstairs and go fucking pick it. Your daughter. Isn't she beautiful? She is knocked out. You can hear her like really? Cause she's got a little stuck. We know. I know. We had the best day though. No snuck. Omar. Did you guys do, uh, we watched the end of the Patriots game. What's, you know, I watched the whole Patriots game and uh, you know, everybody's, you know, that's one of the reasons why I don't get overly excited about a nine. And to record when you play in the Miami Dolphins, which was already, uh, just a, a franchise that has been transitioning, trying to get to another level for fucking decades, it feels, feels like, and you know, Jay Cutler isn't playing and it's just one of those games.

Speaker 7:          01:13:14       We got like three, four sacs, which are going to pad our numbers. So then we go into the playoffs. [inaudible] they got a decent pass, rush and bubble pop. This like teams like that. We'll pad your fucking stats. I got to tell you, that backup quarterback was actually pretty good. Um, but, uh, I, I just, and I love and Tamika Sue, I just, I don't feel he's a dirty player. I just think that that guy plays in the wrong era. He is, he is a fucking Dick. Butkus violent world of Sam huff type of football player. He's just playing in the millennial age. I love that guy. Um, anyways, so we watched that. Then I started to watch some of the Ram Saints Game, which was a great game. And then, you know, she had a runny nose and stuff, so I was constantly having to deal with that. And I don't know that I read some books.

Speaker 7:          01:14:06       You like that baby face? Yeah, she loves that book. I read that book too. Like five. Really? Yeah. She loves it. She likes it cause you act it out. That's like, you know. Yeah. But she gets the faces too that they're making, you know, like, like happy face, you know. And then the last one I'll be like, I go, I, you know, I go laughing, I'm like kick, kick, kick, kick. And she'll look at me going like, he, she laughs too. It's fucking awesome. That's our little like see has like she still has those, the big belly laughs like when you really get her, you know, like I got her yesterday, you know, but then she does a Little Hee Hee Hee Hee Hee Alpha, which is like funny. No, but I got the belly blast yesterday when you were still mad at me. Did you hear how hard it was making her laugh?

Speaker 7:          01:14:47       Yes I did. I say, where are we going to talk about that? About your, about what you're like completely, you know, being mad at the wrong person because you were upset about a game and like that. It wasn't that what it was was I was carrying Lola, my ribs were killing me and then her in the stroller. I told you because she didn't want to be in the stroller. I know, but if she like has a moment where she's like, Eh, she'll be fine. You keep it moving and she's fine. She's not one of those gets, she's not at that stage yet where she just screaming for 10 minutes straight. That's not who she is and plus she has to learn that you can't carry her all the time and I wouldn't know. But she also wrote all the way over there on the car and then we walked up the street, we come back down the street.

Speaker 7:          01:15:32       She was like, I'm over it. You know, in the this strapped in like astronauts. I think eventually I was like, get this fucking thing off me. I understand. It's like, yeah, I wouldn't like to, I mean I'd like to be wheeled around but after I'm at the time we got stuck in the ride at six flags. Yeah. That's what they feel like. You think so? Yeah. Like fuck out of here. Yeah, I'll probably, I would think so anyways, like having a full on parent conversation right now on the podcast and nobody goes back. All right. Sorry. Anyways, that's the podcast. A Happy Thanksgiving post Thanksgiving weekend to you what but what did you say about being mad at that little boy when we were going down the street? What did I say? I don't know. When I came in you were saying you were just talking about it.

Speaker 7:          01:16:15       Did you talk about Utah? I was. Then I was saying, I said there, do I do this and you'll do that and you're just going to be a good dad. I realized I was being a baby because I was embarrassed with my behavior there. Is that enough? Yeah, and she and she sat down. She sat down next to me afterwards. I was watching the late game and she's like, is this game going to make you upset? Oh my God. The amount of time sunny. I swear to God that if you were a guy, I would just start swinging. That was one of those moments I want to start swinging. I would have done the most, well, most guys do acted like I was going to swing and not you to duties.

Speaker 7:          01:16:51       Bring it. I'm not the one. You know what? I am the one, you can talk all this shit and you want to, I'm an old man. Let's go, Bro. You want to do this bro? And when they're like talking top of the bar, let's go bro. Yeah. You know what fucking frat boy white guys also do. They'll bite your ear off fucking lunatics. Especially if their dad's a judge. Um, you had to the pens on like what fucking yeah, yeah. I stayed out of that world. I did not like that world at all. That world was fucked right when, when I came, the shit that they used to do to people during fucking hazing, the fucking stories.
