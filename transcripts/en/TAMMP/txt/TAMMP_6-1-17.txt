Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on is bill burn. It's time for the Thursday afternoon, just before Friday, Monday morning podcast. And I'm just checking in on you. That's right. I'm not yelling it. I'm butterflying up my voice doing that. Every God damn week I'm starting to drink throat coat tea. I need to take care of myself in these next, this next chapter as I peel off another layer of the onion, whatever stupid artistry thing I've just decided, you know, a few people in my life, you know, I'm kind of seeing it. I'm seeing it, I'm seeing what living a certain lifestyle leads to and I'm like, you know what? I need to clean up my act a little bit. All right, it's time to grow. Ah, and Ah, so one of the first things I'm going to do, I'm not cutting out the booze or I'm just going to stop yelling. I'm checking in on you. You know, it's baby steps. You know, when I'll gradually work towards laying off the heroin, you know, I like it. It helps me, helps me go to sleep. You know, the amount of times that I always want to take a nap when I'm standing up outside in public and I just can't do it because my mind just won't shut off. You know, that's, that's when the heroin comes in.

Speaker 1:          00:01:10       That's when it comes into play. You're gonna have to listen to my phone, Ding Dong and cause I got a phone call coming up and I don't want to miss it here. Um, anyways, let me see here. Uh, uh, Jesus. Now I'm going to be looking at text messages, message messages, messages, while I'm trying to do this podcast. This is really gonna butterfly with my add here. How's your week going? I'm going to tell you something, right? All but Billy booze bag and all right. I had, I had family in [inaudible]. Some of you guys guessed the movie by the way. Um, it's something you do with a car. You can't figure it out. Now I can't help you. But what I love is now everybody knows what the movie is, but there's still going to treat me like the long, long, long trailer starring Lucille Ball. Um, why don't you guys ask me if it's every other movie that you could do with the car other than the one you notice.

Speaker 1:          00:02:06       How about that? How about switching it up a little bit? Is it Herbie goes to Monte Carlo? You know, I realize all these years I've been using that as a reference. Like, cause it's the one at the first or second movie I saw, I suffer lover Benji. Then I saw Herbie goes to Monte Carlo and my mother was just like, my mother told me, you know, I, they're just, those kids movies were stupid. I wasn't going to take it anymore though. So, you know, basically there wasn't anything there for her. And she just was looking at it like, you know, there's really nothing here for these kids. It's a butterflying talking car. It's a talking dog. You know, how long are we going to keep the lie going? All right, the fat butterfly doesn't come down. The chimney. Dogs don't talk. And the VW beetle, it's an, it's an, it's an economical car.

Speaker 1:          00:02:50       But you know, at the end of the day it's not respect itself. That's it. Let's go see stripes. Um, anyways, uh, completely forgot what the butterfly I was gonna say. They're on a butterfly that I get to that. I have no idea. Do I need to go on burn any to play some brain games? Saturday is what the butterfly was out. Eat more healthy. I don't know where the [inaudible] but the family back east. I got it. I got it. Rebeck right. He'll be those outtakes on Casey Casey when he flips out screaming young. Now God damn it. I'm not butterflying reading about a butterflying dog died. You know, this is basically like those outtakes except I don't edit them up and I also don't have his iconic success. Yeah. Other than that, I think it's the exact same thing. But anyways, I had family come in fee and we'd kill me and probably a quiche twice in this past month. And um, I had to take him out to the spots. We had to drink a little toast for the little one, a little Nini. Dude, she's laughing her ass off now. It's the greatest thing. It's the greatest thing ever. Um, could not be in a joint more in its June's first. And for the first time in my life on, someone can actually look at me and say, happy father's Day. Right. And I don't have to be like, oh my God. In what Comedy Club did you work?

Speaker 1:          00:04:19       How old is it? Um, anyways, no, I was never like that on the road. I was a good boy, sort of. I had my moments anyways, plowing ahead here. Um, so because they came in, I kind of got off my diet. I was still doing the cardio every day, so I stepped on the scale and the unacceptable second number in my world is eight. Okay. If it's ever a nine, I'm telling you right now, I am going to jump off a butterflying building. Um, I won't do that. I'll just buy really comfortable. I'll keep wearing the golf clothes that I wear. They'll just get bigger. You know, I'll was getting to the John Daly line. Um, so, uh, I'm back on it. I'm back on it. Jumped on the scale today. One 78.8. Still unacceptable. I have been having the worst butterflying time trying to get down to my fighting weight.

Speaker 1:          00:05:08       I wanted to be one 72 by my birthday, my 49th, the end of the forties. Wrapping it up. If I was a professional athlete, I would be 10 years for tired. And once I was Tom Brady with my senior we muscles or whatever the butterfly he's doing with his spongy muscles, um, I don't know what he's doing. Sorry, I'm drinking the throat coat. Oh, Geez. It's bill. You're just annoying on so many different levels today. I apologize. Um, so anyways, so I'm just, I'm going to try to just lay off the booze for a little bit. I'm going to San Francisco, uh, this weekend and uh, I'm working with butterflying my dean off my Dean Martin Joe to Rosa. Okay. So that's going to be, that's going to be a Mulligan that night.

Speaker 1:          00:06:04       Joe. My friendship with Joe to Rosa in his friendship with me is one of the great friendships in show business history and it's all, it's all alcohol fueled. You know, I don't think we've ever hung around each other sober and I don't think that I got to get him on the podcast. I really got to get all butterflying Joe to rose or whatever. His background is, Egyptian, Italian. He doesn't know that man was left at the doorstep of a funny bone way back in 1977. I believe he showed up on a nowhere a baby. Nobody wanted, he came out of the womb already wearing those dark frame glasses.

Speaker 2:          00:06:46       Um, it's sad, but said,

Speaker 1:          00:06:49       um, anyways, plowing ahead. I'm sure I'm going to hear about that from old Joey. Um, I'm guessing two drinks in they do it. There was something I want to talk to you about. It's, I know you were just joking, but you know, to bring that up, it's just really, um, butterfly him. He trashed my dog on stage. Oh, that's coming out. Fourth drinking. I'm trying to guess where the argument's gonna come from this weekend. Why drink with Joe? We really don't argue anymore. Once I discovered, fair enough, you know, I grew up a little bit. He grew up a little bit, and that's all we did. We start to argue and then one of books just goes, Hey, fifth, fair enough. And we laugh and it just diffuses everything. Fair enough. Fair enough. Could stop wars. You know what I mean? This is our borderline now we think it said, hey, fair enough. Fair enough. I understand why you would take that, but I mean, you know.

Speaker 2:          00:07:43       Fair enough.

Speaker 1:          00:07:45       Well, you're going to give it to us law. Yeah, I didn't say that.

Speaker 2:          00:07:49       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:07:50       well then I'm going to butterflying start shooting, I think. Fair enough. Yeah. That's what you feel you need to do. It just diffuses the other guy. Then the other guy standing there going like, no, you're supposed to, you supposed to get mad. Then you get mad, and then I get mad and then I lied to my people and you lie to your people. We dehumanize each other that don't we start shooting.

Speaker 2:          00:08:11       Stop saying, fair enough. All right, fair enough.

Speaker 1:          00:08:17       Anyways, anybody watched the, uh, the penguins were still butterflying predator. I'll tell you something about these tcs penguins from Pittsburgh is they know how to butterflying win a goddamn series. Jesus Christ, the predators in an o two hold for those of you bad at math when it's best. Four out of seven, you're down. Oh two. That means you have to win four of the next five. All the coach isn't going to tell you that. What's he going to say? All right guys. All right boy, we got to take it one game at a time. Okay. Are these crossed the hall in that Locker Room Day? They put their escape too. I bought it at a time. Okay. We've got to start winning the battles at one period of time. Do they are beating the shit out of Sidney Crosby? This playoff series. This playoff is just this, this, this playoff run. I don't know what he did to the refs, but they had done protecting that guy.

Speaker 2:          00:09:24       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:09:25       This slashing and they hooking them, they're butterflying hitting him in the head. Anything that they can do. Um, I dunno. I think that they, uh, they, they should have brought a goon up or something.

Speaker 2:          00:09:38       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:09:38       Somebody to do something. I don't know. But anyways, how about butterflying Malkin's goal? Absolute butterflying, you know, and I know that they, uh, pulled Oh, pito today or whatever his butterflying name is. For some reason I can't remember his goddamn named Pekka. Rina, the hell's his name. She says, I can't cock suck. I came up with some about a dick is the, is the Predator. I butterflying watched every game and I still can't remember his name.

Speaker 2:          00:10:07       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:08       The butterfly is his name. He's a pecker arena. Was that the guy from San Jose? Was he on San Jose then? He went to Nashville. You don't, once I stopped collecting cards, you know, and I turned to scotch. I just never been able to, I've never been able to handle the names anymore. But anyways, I don't give a butterfly who you are. Ken Dryden. Patrick Wa Terry saw chuck. Nobody stops that butterflying puck. That was an absolute filthy, filthy butterflying goal. Um, so my prediction, way back in the day, what did I say? What did I say before I flip flopped and set said audit was going to, was going to win. Game seven, before I did that, I said the penguins were going to win the whole thing. So when it happens, I'm going to ignore the fact that I thought auto was going to come back and win game seven, cause I was questioning the goaltending in Pittsburgh. I'm going to ignore all of that and I'm going to pull up Paul Versey and say, dude, what did I say dude? I called it, um, just out of, uh, you know, jealousy. I want to, uh, I want to see the Predator does tie up the series and not jealousy. Just thought of like selfishness. I want to see the, um,

Speaker 1:          00:11:21       the NHL season goes as many games as possible, but uh, they'll tell you right now the way the penguins deploying, uh, I mean I don't even see there's Walberg the brickwork. Uh, we'll see something incredible has said. How about, I don't know who the butterfly shot that goal, that baby face kid there. I mean that was like the, the, the puck had ice it like there was one little butterflying just puck sized space for a split second between old peck, a penis there, whatever his name is. It just opened up for half a second. The puck literally turned sideways like some Matrix Shit and went in the car. I remember when I, when I saw it live, it's like how the butterfly did that go in?

Speaker 1:          00:12:04       I Dunno man. I'll tell you the hockey gods are smiling down in Pittsburgh right now. Um, who knows, we'll see what sorta home home ice advantage they have. But uh, and also the NBA playoffs not play offs. The uh, final starts tonight. Is that the NBA finals in the Stanley Cup final or is it Stanley Cup finals in the NBA final? I think it's the NBA finals. Um, every time I say something stupid, my phone rings. That's it right there. Does a little bing. All right. I have a call here in butterflying a, let's see, 10 minutes, 10 minutes. So I'm gonna have to hit pause here. It's not gonna matter to you guys cause I'll just pick it up. You know, they'll give me 10 minutes of silence. Like I'm trying to do some artsy, um, that starts tonight. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:12:52       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:53       I Dunno, I don't have a feeling on this one. I want the Cavaliers to win. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:12:59       I want the capitalist to him cause I still feel like they don't get their respect. People aren't talking about them like did the defending like they are the defending NBA champions and [inaudible] went to the warriors. I think that that's why nobody seems to be able to talk about it. You know what I mean? Just to be able to see like, hey, not for nothing. These guys beat those other guys last year. So I hope they keep disrespecting them cause I always root against the pylon team. You know? And I even did it with the red sox in 2007. I just, I don't even think I watched the world series. I mean obviously I was happy that we won. Obviously. I'd rather see us win then the butterflying Colorado Rockies. But I was just lie, this is, that's not competition. You know, having said that, having said that, when the, uh,

Speaker 3:          00:13:48       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:13:48       when the base, when the basketball and hockey season ends, okay, I'm getting the the MLB package and I'm watching my $210 million Red Sox who are in second place, three games behind the evil empire that has nothing but their own homegrown talent. And I'm going to watch that collision course and see how that goes. Um, I, I've learned this is what you have to do if you're a sports fan with some fairly big east is the baseball is such a great sport, but the problem is, is the first, almost the first half of the season is the most exciting time in basketball and hockey and your emotions as a fan. I was so heightened, even if your team is out of it, just to watch, you know, there's always something great happens in the, in the final, unless you enough the butterflying ref called 38 files on one team at 15 on the other, then it sucks.

Speaker 3:          00:14:47       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:48       Letting it go. Um, and then all of a sudden it's over and then you settle it.

Speaker 4:          00:14:55       Yeah. Just a bit outside on a beautiful day for a ball game.

Speaker 1:          00:15:00       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:15:00       I'll tell you his on base percentage is six 45 or that he's really seeing the ball right now. I can't be played the game. What was it like when you had just a, what do you hit a zone like this?

Speaker 5:          00:15:11       Well, I'll tell you, you know when you hit a zone like this, I mean that ball. I mean your eyes are as big as Chris in at. I mean it just, it's like you can't, you just stick in the bad out there and the ball's going where it wants to go. But you know,

Speaker 4:          00:15:24       how do you, how do you try to stay in that zone? How do you try to, I try to keep it going.

Speaker 5:          00:15:29       Well, you know, it's one of those things you can't control. You just, you learn as you, as you mature as a player to just try to enjoy those moments and a while, you know, your hope it goes, as long as it can put a grouchy, it is going to swing back to the other way. And you just hope that that says a,

Speaker 1:          00:15:45       you know, that the slump

Speaker 5:          00:15:46       doesn't last as long. So, uh, you know, you could, uh, keep your house in that gold dig and horror that you met in Tulsa when you're coming up in AAA that you knocked up and you don't really love, but you like her,

Speaker 1:          00:15:57       you're hanging in there for the kid. Um, you know, you've got to settle into that. So what you need to do is, uh, what you got to just immediately, you got to slow everything the butterfly down and what you have to do, what you got to watch a day game, you got to keep score while you smoke a cigar. You know, you get your lineup, you get it all ready to go. You just butterflying sit there and you like the cigar, but the third, any, you know, and he'd just sit there and you butterflying maybe even on the radio, listen to it on the radio and you just, it's like sports yoga. He just have to totally just calm your mind, butterflying relax and then slide into the dog days of baseball. Right? And then you ride that out for about six weeks and then all of a sudden it's NFL preseason.

Speaker 1:          00:16:50       All right. And as a pre season comes along, you're excited about football cause every week's exciting, cause they only play 16 games. Right? But baseball's also ramping up. So then when September comes along, it's like April, May, June with basketball and hockey. Cause now it's like you're so excited how butterflying NFL football, college football. It's coming back. I have a reason to live. Right. And the baseball race is heating up before you go in with Joe Buck and all the great October baseball. That's how you do it. All right, so these next six weeks after the finals are over, you know, I'm telling you, I'll walk you through it on the podcast. You know, you pick a couple of alternative sports. Maybe you watch a little Roland Garris, little Wimbledon,

Speaker 5:          00:17:37       you get into Formula One, maybe a little a Moto g

He's on all these painkillers. He wants to win another one probably before he hangs it up and goes to the, uh, the senior tour. He's doing what he has to do. These butterflying drugs that you can get nowadays are completely out of control. When I was a kid, when a drug came out, bear or any of this shit, they didn't have 9,000 side effects. What happened was people used to be in the pharmaceutical industry, got into the butterflying FDA and they're the ones who police to pharmaceutical companies.

Speaker 5:          00:27:47       And those cons just waved everything around that the third bass coast, it dead, lost his vision, right? So then they let opiates end of the butterflying world. Now you've got a goddamn heroin epidemic. Okay. And now tiger woods is taken too many of those butterflying things and he pulls over to the side of the road and everybody's saying it's because he did the butterflying blonde hair, blue eyed woman, whoever he is, a saint who took his butterflying his, his master's money, bought a giant house, not the butterflying thing down to buy something else. Where did all that material go? Where did all those butterflying gold plated toilets go? They went right into the butterflying ocean, you know, but she's a victim. Oh, give me a break. That's it for the podcast. Signing off. Not butterflying with you. I'm just trying to energy my way through the last bit of this.

Speaker 5:          00:28:34       Uh, what else do I have here to talk about? Oh, you know, he has a great new bits, a new bit I brought, his name is Charlie, Charlie Watts drummer for the rolling stones as a great new book out that it's just a drummer's that influenced him. And if you're a drummer and you're into that shit because he's a, I guess a jazz drummer at heart. He talked about all these butterflying great drummers that I've, I've heard most of the names and didn't know enough about them and the fact that he could break down their styles and what they did has made me a, I was already listening to a lot of that shit through some of my drum lessons, but really just trying to listen to the shit that he's saying. It's a great book. Um, let me, let me look it up here. I'm going to butterflying hype his book here. You know, we've been trying to get Charlie Watson this podcast for a long time. I know he doesn't do a lot of interviews and uh, but I know he'd want to come on my podcast. I'm joking. Charlie watts book. Let's see what we got here. Jolly.

Speaker 5:          00:29:32       You know the butterflying Internet works in like two rooms in my butterflying house. I spent all this money like can you give me the nuclear level butterflying Internet so I can send out, beat out my neighbors and you know, it works for a little while then that's it. Well was sown. Shelly watch 10 things you didn't know about. Shelly Watch. Why no books about Charlie Watch, you know, I'm usually good about front Charlie watts books, drummers influence book. You know, I nailed the John Daly search the last time.

Speaker 3:          00:30:10       Okay,

Speaker 5:          00:30:10       come on for butterfly sakes. Oh Charlie, watch David drama. So it did come up, dude. He can get it for 12 bucks, $12 and 37 cents. Um, whiplash, the film that puts the drummer in the limelight. I did. I ever tell you guys how much I butterflying hated that movie.

Speaker 5:          00:30:28       I just hated watching somebody getting berated. It's just like butterflying quit. Go join another band. Why would you sit there and taking that level of shit from the guy and then not to mention the kids butterflying technique. I, you had to look away when he was butterflying playing real fast. He's making those faces. You could just feel the guy's forums taken up. This guy, this guy's going to have carpal tunnel trying to please this complete cunt. You know, and I got to tell you, the best drums from that year was not in that movie is great as the drums were the best butterflying drums. And some of the best drummers I've heard in a movie, a mainstream moving a long butterflying time. Was that Michael Keaton movie? Um, what the butterfly was that movie where he was the former superhero? The bird. Do you not long. I watched that movie before I realized that was him in the costume talking to himself. Spoiler alert. All right, Michael Keaton. I'm just going to write bird. butterfly you spell his name. I've only been watching his movies for 30 butterflying years. Built Jesus Christ. Michael Keaton, bird bird man. Yo Birdman five fo. Um, who the butterfly is the drummer in that? I know I talked about that before. The drums in that movie are butterflying incredible. It's like,

Speaker 3:          00:31:49       okay,

Speaker 5:          00:31:49       like that. That's what just a whole other level of drumming would. That guy is like, he's playing like moods. They supposed to just play a 90 million miles an hour all over the kid. That guy is, he's, he's piece creating peaks and valleys. I mean that was like a, that was literally a movie score just done with drums. I mean, how many people can have that level of talent? I can tell you right now. I know. I don't, I already knew I didn't in for the last three weeks because I've been so damn busy. I've just been playing like, you know, not on a real drum kit, you know, a little practice pad kit that I was playing on and I thought I was, you know, I thought I was doing something and then I went down and I played on a real butterflying kitten and Jesus Christ, everything that you think he could, you can, you can do drops by like 50 bps.

Speaker 5:          00:32:38       You know, it'd be basically like if you would just jogging on a treadmill being like, wow man, I can run a seven minute mile. Then he'd go out to run down the street. You know, when you forgot about hills and shit and all of a sudden, you know, you, you can't run a seven minute mile anymore. Even if it was flat, flat level. Okay. He'd be, if it was flat level, all of a sudden you run like a butterflying 11 minute mile. That's what I was like, it was extremely butterflying disheartening. And, um, I'm doing the, uh, the comedy jam this weekend up in San Francisco for cluster fest, which is just completely like one of the biggest, I don't know how they afforded to, to, to get all of those comedians and bands and all of that. They must've had a lot of ad money. Somebody is doing something to establish that comedy festivals on.

Speaker 5:          00:33:22       We're going to go butterflying, you know, nine zillion dollars in the hole to start it out. But uh, you might want to go this year because they're going big. Um, oh, I had moments forgot before I sign off here. Thank you to everybody who has been watching season two of F is for family. Um, got nothing but great reviews. You know, there's always a couple of cunty once. What are you going to do? But overall you guys not only like it, but you're saying you think it's even better than the first season, which for the amount of work that we put in, um, to hear that kind of feedback, you know, I know I'm a jerk a lot. That really means a lot to me. So thank you guys for not only watching it. Thank you for the people that took the time to let me know how much you enjoyed it. Please let other people know about it. The more the people know about it, the more people watch it and the better chance we have of possibly getting a third season. Um, and that's it. That's the podcast for this week.

Speaker 1:          00:34:13       Have a great weekend. You can stare and a is a little bit of a bit of music from Andrew Feminists and um, dealt. We'll play a little half hour, some greatest hits from the Thursday or the podcast or whatever those day gone by a medium Monday morning. I don't know what. All right, that's not my part of the podcast. All right,

Speaker 2:          00:34:33       I'll talk to you on Monday, coming back. Oh,

Speaker 5:          00:35:38       all right. Hey, this is the longest butterflying revenge story I think I've ever read. Let me see if I can, uh, see if I can butterflying just, I'm going to blow my, read that one next week when I have the energy. All right. Questions? All right, Bill. Uh, I have a question for you. I was hoping you might be able to shine some insight on this. I have this great friend that that's a girl mistake. Um, and we get along great and we have never had any sort of sexual tension walking up or interest despite her being attractive.

Speaker 3:          00:36:14       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:36:14       All right, dude. Right there. You're either gay or you're, or you're an idiot. And I'm not trying, I'm giving you some tough love here. That's a butterflying stupid situation to be involved in.

Speaker 3:          00:36:23       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:36:23       That's stupid. All right. Unless you're using her to attract other females to get you butterflying late. Let's see if this is the case. I will continue reading. So she has this smoking hot friend. Oh, there we go. That I had met a few times and always flirted with. But uh, but it's just been overall friendly. So this checks calls me up one night and I'm at the bar at like midnight and asked if I want to stay up drinking with her and she'd come pick me up. So obviously I agree. Thanks. Go very good. And we have a few drinks and flirt. And when I make my move, she gets all upset. Like I should have known. She just wants to be friends. When she calls me up at midnight to say to stay up drinking with her alone after the incident, the bitch still has the balls to slow to ask to sleep over. Uh, since then I have noticed all of friends are trying to be my friend when all I want to do is rail the shit out of them. Bill, I was hoping you could, you should, you could shine some light on the situation and help me out. Yeah, dude, never have a friend as a, as a female,

Speaker 5:          00:37:28       you know, you always gotta be

Speaker 1:          00:37:32       butterflying him. That's the only reason to be around him, you know? I know that sounds really sexist, but you know, I, I just, I'm speaking from me. There's no butterflying point in hanging out with that level of frustration if you're not having sex with them. And if there are actually like a good friend and that's the one that you should, uh, I mean that's the ultimate, if you're banging them and they're also a great friend, that's the one you marry cause you got a connection there. Right. But if you just, I mean they're using you as like a live teddy bear.

Speaker 3:          00:38:08       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:38:09       And um,

Speaker 1:          00:38:12       yeah, the next time they call up, just be like, no, I'm, I, I'm not, I can't hang out tonight. What are you doing? I'm going to go out and try to get some ass tonight. I know I'm not getting any from you and it's frustrating because you're hot and I want to bend you over every piece of butterflying furniture in my apartment. [inaudible] I can't believe you said that. Yeah. Well I just did. Are you going to come over here and butterfly me? Well then great. I have to, why are you being so mean? I'm not being mean, I'm being honest. Okay. Do you have any times I've jerked off to you. It's butterflying, and it's annoying that you just, you just, I'm telling you, like that's a little aggressive, but that's what you have to start doing. You just have to be straightforward and honest and don't do it.

Speaker 1:          00:38:53       Like I just said it, do it, do it how you can do it and pull it off. And you just say it like that and just be like, Hey, I want to go out. I want to try to get laid tonight. All right. And I go out with you and you're not butterflying me. And then other girls see me with you and they think that I am butterflying you, which I'm not. And I ended up going home, a dry humping my futon, you know, and it's really butterflying with myself to steam. Okay. So that's it. So basically he ready. You say you say that, um, if I had a sack your cock, you know, I hang out with me. Yes. That is what I'm saying.

Speaker 1:          00:39:26       That's what I'm saying. Your conversations are awful, you know, I'm sure they're interesting to other females, but not to me. I don't want it to, I don't want to talk about that shit. I could give a shit about the hills, the Osi, the ocean or whatever the butterfly I was stupid. Show you what? I don't give a butterfly. I don't give a butterfly. I want to butterfly you. Okay. It's world's Ed, right day in artist. You have a seat. Well watched the world series of poker. When you go all in, that's what you do. Just say what the butterfly you want to do. You push all your chips in and you stand up and you start walking around. You wait for that next car to drop. Steve. What the butterfly happens? Yeah, dude, that's my advice. Get out of that whole circle of EA. He's like a big teddy bear. butterfly that.

Speaker 1:          00:40:09       butterfly Dad. All right. United Teddy Bear. Well, you are one right now. You've got to stop being that guy. So butterfly all of them. Go. Uh, where your guy friends, what are they doing? Go hang out with them. Go get a butterflying wing man. Get yourself back in the game and uh, go out there and talk some shit. Hit on some girl you don't give a butterfly about. So you can practice not giving a butterfly and just say a bunch of shit that you would never say to some girl that you gave a shit about, eh, because you don't give a butterfly if the girl says no, start with that, you know, always wear a condom. And uh, and that's it. That's what I would do. That's what I should've done. I didn't, I just have that knowledge now cause I'm butterflying, uh, and I have been the funeral psalm. I was never the front, but I was definitely the Douche bag. I was definitely the, the uh, not even pussy whipped wasn't even pussy. What does just, I couldn't butterflying speak up for myself. I was afraid of having a confrontation and then by the time I had the final confrontation, I was like, ah, I know. It was like butterflying a year with the shit and we broke up. Um, but that's a whole nother thing.

Speaker 2:          00:41:21       [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          00:41:42       [inaudible] up everybody. It's bill bar. This is the Monday morning podcasts and I'm recording for the third time this week. Praying and hoping against hope that g CAS will actually upload this one because I've already spent 90 minutes doing podcasts this week. So anyways, if you're hearing this, it means I successfully uploaded it. So there's no sense complaining, unlike the rest of the people in my butterflying life. You know you have it. Just have one of those weeks where everyone's just bitching at you. That's what I got. You know, that's what I'm dealing with right now. Like today's my girlfriend's birthday and she's, she was butterflying pissed at me. She went absolutely psycho on me this morning. You know, it had nothing to do with me. Had nothing to butterflying do with me. You know, I gave her a piece of cake last night, right at midnight, sang her happy birthday because technically it was a birthday.

Speaker 7:          00:42:34       I gave her a pre birthday slice of cake and then I gave her a bag of Fritos with a little bow on it. Right. Just being a silly jackass. Like that's all you're getting for your birthday. Right. And everything was going great. I was a big sweetheart. And then I woke up this morning and made the mistake of telling her that I had made a dinner reservation yet. And then she starts flipping out acting like I'm just throwing her God damn birthday together when I gave her a pre birthday butterflying slice of birthday cake, you know, starts flipping out. I don't know why she was flipping out. It's like, it's butterflying Tuesday. It's a Tuesday. It's not a holiday. This who the butterfly is going out tonight? June 2nd. Oh Shit. Was it Cinco de Mayo? You know, is it a fuss? I'm butterflying New Zealand holiday that I don't know about.

Speaker 7:          00:43:27       There's going to be plenty of butterflying reservations and lo and behold, after she flips out, you know, screaming at me. Right? So all my neighbors think that I'm beating her. Women love doing that Shit. They just put on this big butterflying show. Right? And then afterwards they just guy, I'm sorry I got a little crazy. I don't know. I think just he don't hate me, dare you. You forgive me. And they do that shit. Right. Meanwhile, you know your neighbors don't hear that part. They don't hear the part where they sort of say really quietly that they flipped out for no butterflying reason. You know, all they heard was to scream and yell. And so now I'm going to get the looks today I'm going to go down to the garage. You know, like it's the 1920s like I should become walking out with like a butterflying wife beater, you know, as I reattach the belt to my pants.

Speaker 7:          00:44:18       So this is what happens, right. I ended up calling up this butterflying restaurant, is this not one of the nicest steak houses out here in la? I call him up. I said, hey, I'd like a reservation for two people. Hang. Okay sir, what time would you like? I said, how about eight? Ah, can't do anything at eight. How about eight 30 and I said, you know what sweetheart, that would be perfect. And she said, okay, and that was it. That's all I had to butterflying do. But for some reason, because I didn't do that before her birthday, that means that I don't give a butterfly. That's how butterflying nuts women are. She absolutely, she actually flipped out on me. Okay. At 10 o'clock in the morning on her birthday, she didn't even give me a chance to butterfly the day up. She did a preemptive strike, even though I gave her a pre birthday slice of cake, I sang happy birthday.

Speaker 7:          00:45:12       I made a shutter arise, I put, I put out the lights, I lit a candle. I came in, I sang happy birthday and I gave her a bag of Fritos, which is butterflying ridiculous and silly. It was great. And tonight she's getting the real gift, if you know what I mean. Oh. Um, you know, so it's one of those deals where I'm laying in bed and then all of a sudden she, ah, it's just butterflying ridiculous, you know? But I didn't back down. I didn't back down. I, you know, actually when she really got mad, why is she started flipping out is because she, when she was screaming at me, I was laughing. You know, I don't know if any other guy out there has that problem you ever had. Like when your girlfriend starts yelling at you, you're first instinct is just to start laughing.

Speaker 7:          00:46:00       I don't know why. Every time my girl yells at me, I instantly feel like I'm in school again and I'm like, and in second grade and I'm getting yelled at and it's just, and my friends are laughing at me. That's, that's what I feel like. I feel ridiculous. Okay. I guess that's what it is. When when a woman yells at me, I always feel ridiculous. You don't want a guy yells at me. I get mad because I think, oh butterfly, this guy's going to beat the shit out of me. So you got to get into that energy. But when a girl, a woman is just sitting there,

Speaker 7:          00:46:34       what are you supposed to do? You know, I'm not going to yell back at you. You're a woman. I don't want to feel like a bully. We're not going to get physical. You're a woman. You know it's stupid. Stop yelling that butterflying high pitch voice. You sound like a butterflying, he's all like Mickey Mouse. Sit Down, relax, collect your thoughts. Make a list. If you have to tell me why you're upset, you know, but don't just sit there butterflying yelling at me like you just took a hit off a helium balloon because it just sounds hilarious, especially when I haven't done anything wrong and I got a great butterflying gift this year. That's what was killing me that actually I actually had that moment during the fight where I said, you want your gift, fine, and I went out and I pull it out. It's already wrapped with a bow on it. You know, sitting there acting like I'm not butterflying prepared. There's your butterflying present. Bam wrapped with a butterflying bow on it.

Speaker 7:          00:47:34       Jesus, everybody giving me Shit. I remember last week when I called that woman a douchebag remembered the Douche bag of the week last week because she was giving me shit. Once again, a female surprise, surprise was giving me shit that when I read the underrated overrated or the questions people have, I wouldn't say what sex they were. And she somehow found out a way to kind of, I don't know, make me look like I was some chauvinist that I guess she felt if it was a good question, I credited a guy and uh, you know, it's a free podcast. All right, stop being so butterflying cunty. So she became Douche bag of the week. So evidently she didn't like it. And what does she do? She sends me an email, his email, she sends me a bill. It's nice that you named me Douche bag of the week. I don't really give a shit because I always mean what I write.

Speaker 7:          00:48:30       I don't even know what that means cause I always mean what I write. I'll really one of the rest of us just faking it. We're just joking around but not you yourself butterflying serious. It's anyways, evidently this psycho. This is a new segment. This is cy. I can't, I can't figure out this is a love letter of the week or psycho or the week. I don't know. You guys name it. I don't give a shit. So anyway, she goes, I don't really give a shit because I always mean what I write and it seems you're just talking shit about two things that I wrote that seemed bitchy. Now I was talking about your entire email. Don't try to knock it down. All right, continuing here. She goes, call me. [inaudible] but I really don't give a butterfly. You've read a lot of my comments previously and agreed with them or had a good response to them.

Speaker 7:          00:49:11       I'm literally fixing her sentences because she doesn't know how to write here. But it's nice that you, uh, we'll consider telling the gender of the person who, uh, who the comments are from. And I know you have a shitload of people who listen to your podcast, but I got you some more since my friends who heard the podcast thought it was butterflying hilarious and then they started listening to you. So you really should be thanking me. Isn't this just typical? This is just all going to be a woman bashing this week. Isn't this just typical of a butterflying female? You know what I mean? She's getting something every week, every week that is free. And she still found a way to bitch about it. Okay. And then when I call her out for being a douchebag, now she's actually trying to make me feel guilty. You know, I just, you know, you call me a Douche bag, you know, whatever.

Speaker 7:          00:50:00       I mean, he's just, even though I got a whole bunch of friends to listen to you, I mean probably shouldn't be thanking me, but you know, I thought, okay, shut up. Just Shit. I swear to God. Why? Why can't you just slap women? You know, back in the day, how great did that feel? You know, you have on the wife Beater, the wind blowing through your armpit hair has you just crack. I know it's evil. I don't give a butterfly. butterfly all you guys. I don't give a shit. This is the rest of her email. Okay. Before you think I'm an asshole. This is what she wrote. This is actually so psychotic. It's hilarious. She writes and yeah, I do know that the name shows up on the email even if I don't sign it, but you just make it seem like you that much of a retard to notice.

Speaker 7:          00:50:44       That's literally what she wrote. And then she wrote your over 40 and have the vocabulary of a seventh grader. Your is spelled y, o u. R. All right, for you morons out there, your y o u r is possessive, meaning like that's your shirt. Okay. If you're saying your over 40 that's you are. Okay. So that means if you're gonna say your, it's an apostrophe Wyo you a pause to free our [inaudible]. So if you're a dumb butterfly like this woman, if you don't know the next time you go to write your just stop and see if you are would still fit. All right? Like your over 40 you are over 40 okay. Right there. You know you got to use the apostrophe as as opposed to saying you're over 40 so what is over do I own over you? Dumb butterfly. But I do have the vocabulary of a seventh grader, but you know something, you have the butterflying vocabulary for a third grader.

Speaker 7:          00:51:48       All right? You're over 40 and you have the vocabulary of a seventh grader. You can't recognize real words. How hilarious is this? And she's misspelling stuff. You started when you read, and I hope your dog outlives you and you die lonely because of your inability to commit and therefore never achieve the comedic fame of the Great George Carlin. So Simon says, go butterfly yourself. Since it sounds like you have major brain damage. All right sweetheart, I'm really going to try to help you out here, okay? If you hope that my dog outlives me, and then you say, and then I die lonely. Okay. If I'm going to die before my dog, mathematically the butterflying dog is still gonna be there. So how am I going to be lonely? You know, the dog would have to die first or run away. So what you should say is, I hope you dug out lives.

Speaker 7:          00:52:44       You then runs away and then you died by yourself as opposed to saying, I hope your dog outlives you when you die. Lonely. Now, I would die before my dog and be sitting there licking my face and my last few pathetic moments, and then evidently because of my inability to commit to a relationship, I'll never achieve the comedic fame of George Carlin. Oh, that totally makes sense. It has nothing to do with the fact that I wasn't blessed with his gifts as a comedian. You know, all you have to do to be as good as George Carlin is just commit to a relationship to some psycho butterflying chick like you. All right, lady. These are podcasts. These are jokes. When I call somebody a Douchebag, I'm just butterflying around, so don't take it seriously. But if you want to, you and your friends can go butterfly yourselves and go listen to another podcast.

Speaker 7:          00:53:28       All right. Stop trying to threaten me. Like you're going to take podcasts. Listen, listeners away. I don't give a shit. This is free. What are you guys going to take away advertising dollars from me? I don't give a butterfly. butterfly you and your friends. I hope you're all listening together. butterfly all of you. Look around the room, look into each one of your eyes. I'm saying butterfly all of you. You know what's funny is your friends are probably laughing at you right now going, you know what she is? She has kind of a cunt. She really is like that. She does have a tendency, I know I shouldn't use that word, but I'm serious. She has, she can be real counties sometimes and she has a tendency to exaggerate things that aren't really happening. In fact here, hair here. All right, so that's the first hate mail.

Speaker 7:          00:54:09       So I figured, you know, why don't I seek out, I'll try to find some other hate mail. Here's one that I got on youtube. This is a nice one. Um, basically I, uh, there's a clip on there from me from about eight years ago, which he'll obviously notice cause I'm skinnier and have a full head of hair. And I'm doing this bit about joining the military, saying how, you know, when you watch the commercials for the military, it makes you want to join. You know, they make it look like everybody gets their own jet. Everybody's driving a tank. Everyone's doing some top gun shit. Everyone's having a, uh, you know, you're a butterflying navy seal. You get your face painted and you're clinging to that raft and you coming up out of the water like butterflying Rambo disappearing into the mud and shit. That's what they make you look like.

Speaker 7:          00:54:54       Right? But what they don't show is all the other jobs that you, you know, you go in there and you think you're going to be like, you know, Tom Cruise, oh my God, my dog just farted. Jesus Christ, Cleo. You know? Could you at least like, you won't kills me about this dog when it farts, is it, it doesn't even have the decency that butterflying kind of make a face like, yeah, that was me. Sorry about that. She doesn't lays here. Good Lord. Least it's silent. You know, it's the worst is when you have a dog that far. It's like a person ever been over somebody's house and the dogs and the corner and they just go like it. Just like really. Anyways, so that was the bit, so the bid is, yeah, you, you, you, you see the commercial and you sign up, you thinking, yeah, I'm going to be like Tom Cruise in top gun and then you show up and he ended up being that guy.

Speaker 7:          00:55:45       You know when the jet takes off, you just like point in the same direction that the jets going or they give you those, those orange glow sticks from a rave. You know when the plane comes in, you're that guy, you put the air in the tires on the jet, you know, you join the next thing you know you're standing there with like a camouflage weed whacker going week gave me hack. Hack, hack. Yeah. That was the joke. Okay. Simple joke. I actually did the joke at a military base and I also did it at one of the VA hospitals and in butterflying killed, you know what I mean? So this guy of course has to go all Fox News on Youtube. And this is what he writes is actually kind of funny. He writes, you grateful bitch and then he puts in quotes if you're dumb enough to join the military.

Speaker 7:          00:56:28       Dot. Dot. Dot, which is classic of somebody who wants to take a joke seriously is they don't write, the whole joke is they just take not even a sentence. They just take a part of a sentence. Okay. So he writes, if you're dumb enough to join the military dot, dot, dot. And then he writes in capital letters. Fact, fact is, if it wasn't for the bravery of the American servicemen and the American spirit throughout history, I like the American spirit. What do you mean chicks who go to a butterflying bake sale? Um, anyways, you wouldn't even get, you wouldn't even have the right to mock those sacrifices which have been made for you. And if you did, you would probably be doing it in German. So respect your American servicemen because it is him in which you owe your freedoms to take to that what people came, you know, half the time people think I'm a moron cause people can't even write a sentence because it is him in which you owe your freedoms too, that you take so foolishly for granted.

Speaker 7:          00:57:30       That's word for word or appreciate the sacrifices of other you coward. Uh, you know, at what point did I make fun of servicemen? I didn't, I was making fun of the how butterflying whatever. You know something. If you guys want to take joke seriously, I don't give a butterfly and I am really sick of that hacky thing where someone goes, you know, and they did it for you and if you didn't, you'd be speaking German right now. That's how dumb people are. You know, they're just used to say that you'd be speaking German right now is a hacky butterflying reference. You just saying that because you heard someone else say it. You know, why wouldn't I be speaking like I was from England? Why wouldn't I be speaking Spanish right now? You know, we did fight other countries, Mexican American war. How come that one never gets brought up?

Speaker 7:          00:58:21       How can I wouldn't be speaking Korean. I mean, granted they weren't over here, but you know what I'm saying? I'm so sick of butterflying idiots who speak in sound bites like I everyone who like makes fun of France. Yeah, we fool conceived jurors and were to you full can Poussey's read a history book. We were paying them back for saving our ass with England. You'd dumb butterflys. So now we're even all right. Whatever. Look at me. I'm getting all upset here cause people are morons. All right, let's, let's move on to, you know, let's, let's get to some information here for the week. All right. Um, last week I was at, Oh, here's it going out. Last week I was at teasing firefighters and I was talking about how, uh, you know, 20 trucks show up to every fire. Why does that happen? How much of those trucks costs?

Speaker 7:          00:59:04       And a volunteer firefighter wrote in, he said a up it up. A, Ah, I, yes. How much a fire trucks cost fire engines, which put the water out. Uh Oh wait, put the water on fire engines, which put water out. I think I'm dyslexic. Um, typically run between 300,000 and $600,000. Fire trucks also called ladder trucks run between 400,000 in 800,000. The two main differences between the low and high numbers is the make of the truck and the equipment. It comes with a fire engine with all the hoses at and on. And the breathing apparatus is more expensive than without. All right. Well here's a question I have with for you. You say the make of the truck. So, uh, I guess what Mack truck, that's a reputable bank. Reputable brand as opposed to what? A high and a fire truck. I guess that that's what it is.

Speaker 7:          01:00:02       I don't even know what the butterfly they are. But anyways, you asked us, you asked why so many pieces of apparatus show up to a call. Uh, there are a few reasons for this. Sometimes it's manpower and my case, we have three fire companies consisting of six pieces of apparatus. Since we volunteer, they may not be enough volunteers in town at any one time. So all three companies get banged out, banged out, equals called out in firefighting terms. Typically at least four pieces show up for a call. This allows us to have all the equipment we need at the scene. Sometimes you just never know what you're going to need. All right, fair enough. Uh, but perhaps the best reason this is great here, but perhaps the best reason is that sometimes we are called for what amounts to be in the end. Absolutely nothing. About six months ago, my pager went off your pager. Jesus Christ. Dude, is your firetruck pulled by a couple of horses? Who the butterfly still has a picture?

Speaker 7:          01:00:58       I know he's going right back around. Should we would special fork in nine 11 page or for firemen? All right. I'm a moron. I get it. All right. About six months ago, my pager went off for a, for a working house fire at 2:00 AM I jumped awake and flew down. Uh, to the firehouse. We got on the scene, we saw no smoke or flames in, uh, in speaking with the residents, they had just woke up and saw a reflection in their mirror that they thought was a fire. So here's all six of our apparatus showing up for absolutely nothing or the time we called for the, for lightening hit lightening, hitting a house on a clear summer night, the woman heard something and thought it was lightening hitting her house. People are butterflying idiots all over. Hope that helps. And even though I am a firefighter, you're firefighter jokes were funny.

Speaker 7:          01:01:47       See, there's a cool guy. He see there, sweetheart. Even though he's a firefighter, he sees the joke. He realizes I'm just telling jokes are right. There you go. People how we learned something this week. All right, you want to learn something else then I'm going to wrap up this butterflying podcast. I know it's really short this week, but at WWE, I don't understand what the point of me keep babbling for butterflying 50 minutes. If G CAS won't upload, the files are a, here's some computer tips for the week. Uh, here's some computer tips on web searching. All right, Bill, when you want to find that, uh, that you are Google it. What? That makes no sense. All right? When you Google use the plus and the minus signs to find the shit you want to, this is how it works. If you want to search something with a plus in front of it, then it will have to contain the word.

Speaker 7:          01:02:42       And if you want to put a minus in front of it that were removed the word from the listing. So basically put the plus in front of the word that you're searching, that you want to find an a minus in front of the one that you don't want. For example, I want to see how many sites have bill burr on it while limit while eliminating bill burr from, uh, from the search. So you would Google the plus sign, plus my name bill, then the plus sign, and then you write burr minus bill [inaudible] dot com and the results, we'll, uh, we'll show sites that can have content with bill burr on it and not include bill bird.com. Huh? Isn't that interesting. I didn't know that shit. And he said, I'm listed on seven hundred thousand seven hundred six thousand web pages, not including my website. 706,000 websites have my name on it and I still can't sell out the third show on Saturday night. What the butterfly is going on? All right. Um, if you find some shit out, like, uh, if you want to find some shit out like to do to you, I can't read what you guys, right? If you want to find some shit out, like to you do when you are on what? I can't even paraphrase that.

Speaker 7:          01:04:01       If you want to find some shit out like two you do now like you do when you're on the podcast. All right? You had an extra word in there, dude. If you want to find some shit out like you do when you're on the podcast, use the above option, the plus, minus, or, or use quotes. All right? You wanted to find the names of female serial killers a few weeks ago. Just put quotes around a phrase and it will only show sites that contain all phrases. Okay, I get it. You know, like you guys ever go to search something and you'll like, you'll just write female serial killers and then a bunch of uh, hits. We'll come out and you'll have a bunch that just say female and a bunch of that we'll just say cereal and other ones just say killers or whatever. Yeah, I guess if you put quotes around it that puts it all together.

Speaker 7:          01:04:52       You know what? That's very helpful. I know this part of the, the podcast isn't that funny, but God dammit, we, we, you know, we got to learn something here. All right. I should have got some water here. My butterflying mouth is dry as hell. All right, let's wrap up the podcast here. Uh, this is the, a serial killer topic. Bill. If you want to be a serial killer, uh, and use the best weapon you have to use ice. If you stab someone with an icicle or beat someone to death with ice, then it melts and you have no murder weapon or fingerprints, no DNA or fingerprint problems. Oh yeah. That guy who, uh, that talked about tracking you down with the type of soil where it was located and the type of wood used and all that shit is exactly that bullshit. They watch too many shows. CSI does not do that shit. I know, Dude. We all knew he was just butterflying around. He was making fun of how, when you watch those shows. Um, all right, what else did we get here? Question a bill. You say that you play the drums. Um, if you could, uh, play the drums in any band living or dead for one show, one night, only in any city in the world, who would you play and in what city? butterfly. Um, Jesus Christ. It would either be led Zeppelin.

Speaker 7:          01:06:10       You know what's funny is I think I would have a better, better chance faking one John Bonham does. Then what Phil Rudd does and ACDC foot fill red does is so butterflying difficult. If you play drums to just sit there and go boom, crack, boom, cracked for butterflying two hours straight. Um, yeah, I think I would play, I would play with led Zeppelin. I do it in England at Royal Albert Hall and a I would, and I would play on that, that the Ludwig, uh, that maple drum kit that he played, either that or his green sparkle kit. I don't like the Vista Vista light kit he had or the, uh, the stainless steel when I liked the first two ones that he had. I play on either one of those and somehow I would sound as good as can I, can I, can I have that as part of the fantasy that I would actually sound as good as he would sound, you know, that's what I would do.

Speaker 7:          01:06:57       Um, and then I'd get butterflying some 1969 croupy pussy afterwards. All right, next question, Bill. Um, would you rather be respected, be respected comedian who never makes it really big? Like so and so and so and so? I'm not going to name the names. Uh, he named two people who are millionaires playing theaters, but I guess who can still walk down the street, he said, or would you rather be a one trick pony, like a blah, blah, blah? Who has written a one catchphrase to fame and fortune and as more cash than he can ever spend. I Dunno, I'd much rather be respected by my peers without a butterflying doubt. Without a doubt. I would, uh, you know, you can become a really big comedian and not necessarily be super like, that's the great thing about entertainment as you, it's easy to become, I can't say it's easy, but you can become a millionaire and still not be famous.

Speaker 7:          01:07:52       You know what I'm saying? And I always use this, this example, like that Sitcom Caroline in the city, they actually made it to syndication and the entire cast could walk by me on a walking down the street and I wouldn't recognize any of them. So I would, you know, Dude, you're a millionaire. How much butterflying money do you need? And I also think the more I look at these people being super, super famous is I just doesn't look like a good time to me. You know, I think I would, I want to be a millionaire who has notoriety, which means maybe two, three times a month, somebody goes a year. That comedian, I really like what you do and the Yay, thanks a lot. Then I go back to eat my omelet. I'd rather do that then butterflying, uh, I dunno. You know, I don't, I don't ever want to butterflying have to step out of a limo with no panties on.

Speaker 7:          01:08:43       You know what I mean? Just so I can maintain fame at that butterflying level when you think that would just anything that, that would be miserable. I mean, other than when you're at the butterflying Celtics game and you have court side seats in that moment, that's butterflying awesome. You know what I mean? I've always used this analogy, but it's someday at some point you're going to have to butterflying blow out a bathroom in public and you don't want to be famous at that point. You know? You just want to be like, dude, you can't, for some butterflying guy just blew. You don't want a bill. Berge just blew out the bathroom.

Speaker 7:          01:09:18       They literally put a butterflying name to it. It's brutal. Um, all right. Overrated. Underrated. Really quickly. Overrated beer with the lime already in it. No joke. It just tastes butterflying gross. Um, what else do I got here? I'm sorry, this is really butterflying unraveling here. I just, I, I, I've done, I've done this too many times is butterflying week. I don't know. I lost my passion. Like if Pau Gasol was doing a butterflying podcast, this is what it would sound like right now. You know, and I'd be thumping my chest acting like I'm giving you entertainment right now and I'm not, you know, that's what I'm going to end with this week. What do we got here? I'm 28 minutes in. Good. I'll keep it under 30 minutes. I'm going to end with this prediction. I think Orlando is going to beat the Lakers and I think they're going to beat him in six games because, uh, they don't have anybody to stop.

Speaker 7:          01:10:05       Dwight Howard. And I think Turco Lou is, uh, I dunno. I think that guy's going to get enough points and then they got that other guy. Then the number two or is he the point guard? I don't know shit about basketball. I just butterflying hate the Lakers. So I'm going to go out on a limb here with no money down or nothing. I'm not going out on a limb. I just, I just think I got a feeling I got to butterflying feeling all right. I think Van van Gundy's going to, ouch. He's going to out coach Phil Jackson. Phil Jackson, he's making home videos with his girlfriend, his new hot young girlfriend on the, on his way to the staples center every night. They're soft, they're butterflying soft. All they have is Colby Colby [inaudible] the shit. I Love Colby. But I think his teammates are scared of him. I think they're scared to butterfly up around them.

Speaker 7:          01:10:47       They're scared to disappoint him. Uh, and they just get freaked out and they just pass him the ball. That's what I think's going to happen. Pog Saul gets the most quietest, 15 butterflying rebounds and the quietest 20 points a game. I think he's going to, he's going to take a butterflying Dwight Howard elbow to his bearded chops sometime in game two and the Orlando is going to win game two. They get three in a row in Orlando. They're going to win two out of three and then they're going to come back and they're going to beat the heartless Lakers in the staple center. Game Six. What the butterfly do you guys think about that? Huh? You liked that one?

Speaker 7:          01:11:22       You know, what do you guys think about the two, three, two playoff format? I think it's bullshit. I think the, they give the advantage to the weaker team because the Lakers should have home court. Right? And I don't think they do with a two, three, two format because when it's two, three, two the pressure is on the home team for the first two games. Right. If it was two, two, one, one, one like they used to do back in the back in the day you open the first two games. The pressure is our on our Lando to steal one now when it's two, three to the pressures on the Lakers, they have to win both of those butterflying games. They can't go one, one and then path to play three butterflying games in Orlando. Right. My outta my mind. And this is this all get boring.

Speaker 7:          01:12:07       Well I don't give a butterfly cause this is my third one this week. Listen to my goddamn mouth is dry. Um, so anyways, I might do another podcast this week cause I might have a very special announcement of something that I might be doing next week that might be on television. How do you like that? I'm leaving you with a little cliffhanger. Um, and with that I don't have any gigs until, uh, the third week in July when I'm going to be at the comedy works in Denver. Um, why is that? Um, I booked a very small part in a very big movie and um, I don't know, I'm shooting like five, six days on it, but they had to clear out my spa, my schedule because they're working around famous people schedule. So I'm low man. On the totem pole. So, uh, I gladly cleared out my Spec, my schedule. So, uh, I'll let you know what the name of the movie is and all that type of shit. Wow. When in fact, I know that I haven't been cut out of it. How's that? All right. And that's the very short, very succinct Monday morning podcast this week, the third butterflying time I'm praying to God that this thing is going to actually get published. All right. You guys have a good weekend. Thanks everybody who came out to the Improv a couple of weekends ago out here in Hollywood. All right. That's it. Take it easy.

Speaker 2:          01:14:15       [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible].
