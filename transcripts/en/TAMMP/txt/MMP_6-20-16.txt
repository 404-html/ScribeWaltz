Speaker 1:          00:02          Hey, what's going on? His Bill Burr. And it's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday, June 20th, 2016 what's going on? How are you, how are you doing? You Collins? Um, she noticed sounds a little weird. Uh, I'm in a hotel in Baltimore, Baltimore, Baltimore. Um, I can't say that because I've watched Scarface so many fucking times. I can't watch, I can't say Baltimore without picture and fucking, you know, Tony Month is that fucking ac coming back on again. How many fucking times I got to hit off. Ah, Jesus fucking Christ is a fucking button on here. Literally just says off off. There we go off. Shut off. Please shut off. Thank you. Fuck Sakes. I'm sorry. Um, anyways, so believe it or not, I'm doing this because I'm flying back to La as you're listening to this and I'm so sad to say, I haven't watched the fucking NBA finals yet, but, um, I do promise you if Cleveland wins that I will do something. Uh, I got to do something special as something. Um, because WHO's kitten? Oh, the warriors already want it, right? If they repeat, fuck. Sorry, I held it too closely. If they repeat, then it's going to be like, all right, can they three pizza next year? I feel like is their big thing so that they can go down with all the teams that have won three in a row. So this year is sorta like, you know, you know, it's not as exciting.

Speaker 1:          01:32          I'm sure warrior fans who I don't give a fuck. I'd love to see Lebron do it. You know, after everybody gave him shit for the way he left, which they should have because like I said, he gave everybody fucking, you know, sports blue balls. Like maybe I'll go here, maybe I'll go there. Who wants to buy me a drink? Yeah, he was being very conty and then he went to fucking Miami. Jesus Christ. What the fuck happened to her? I got have the TV not on in the background.

Speaker 2:          01:58          Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:59          good Lord. Getting old as the worst. I just saw some woman, she had her fucking head. Do you ever see like when a dog gets confused and cocks her head, like your head was just like that? Um, what is that called? What is that from? How do you avoid that as if fucking alternate neca exercises you can do on the other side of your fucking head. So that doesn't happen to you.

Speaker 2:          02:18          Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:18          It's so fucking weird. Why? Why can't you just like, you know, why can't death just be like the old right there for it? You don't, I mean, why does it have to be just like this slow fucking descension into like God knows what the older I get, the more frightening that is. When you were younger, you just like, Jesus, that old fuck what happened to them and me, I'm looking at it now go like, you know, in the next 20 fucking years, you know, I better start eating better.

Speaker 1:          02:48          Jesus Christ. I'm off the rails and my fucking day. Does anything make you feel fatter than eating room service in your bed in a fucking hope. Just eating and yet in a bed in general, not that makes you feel fatter than eating in a bed. You know, just fucking sitting there getting crumbs and your sheets and shit and you're trying to scrape it off onto the floor. You just feel like a fucking animal. You like laying on you. I was like, literally on my side. I'm in Maryland, so I get some sort of crab cake sandwich. Of course it's sucked because I got to the hotel instead of the spot to get it at right. And I'm on my fucking side and I'm eating the fries. I'm literally sitting there like that fucking lifeguard, you know, when he got shit faced and he was eating the burger and everybody laughed at him.

Speaker 1:          03:27          Hasselhoff, everybody was laughing at him. Like it was fucking nuts to me. It's like, like, dude, you never did that. You never just been laying on your full floor, hammered eating a fucking burger. You should try it. Sometimes the food is delicious. It takes it to a whole other level. You're so fucking psyched and so appreciative of the God damn food, you know, if he want. So I advocate everybody doing that this week. Get fucking hammered. Order a burger, lay on your floor. Just start talking shit in honor of father's Day while your daughter films you. And I think that's, I think that's the way to go. Um, people already texted me, you watch the game anyway, tonight. Now I'm fucking working. Actually somebody tweeted at me going, what the f what? What's with your agent? Why to, how would your agent book a show? You know, when this game seven of the NBA finals, it's like, hey, stupid.

Speaker 1:          04:21          Like it's not like we booked it after game six, six been on the books for months. We had no fucking idea. I didn't know. So, um, anyways, uh, I really want to see a, I love the warriors man, by the way. You know, I have no beef with those guys, but it's just as a sports fan when, I don't know if the dog in the fight, it would just be great to see the Brown after all the Shitty God and all those sad sack Cleveland fans burned his Jersey standing there and they're fucking cargo shorts, right? Burden the Jersey. What people filmed it so fucking stupid. That is so stupid. And I'm not singling out Cleveland Cavalier fans, but when people just take sports to that level, like when Lane Kiffin left fucking Tennessee and there was that one guy going, let me tell you something, you fucking piece of shit and link care for and you're going to fucking leave here.

Speaker 1:          05:13          You're going to leave here. Like Tana sees it. Uh, uh, we ain't no stepping stone to USC. We were booking, we were fucking destination skill. This is what I think book and lean bird can key up and, and I don't know what he had. He had some lane Kiffin something or like a program and he fucking peed on it. A grown man filmed themselves paying on that program. It's like toad. Someday you're going to have kids. The fuck is wrong with you. Well, I'll give birth by a fucking kid. It, I'm right there at their little dicks out paying right with me.

Speaker 1:          05:48          I don't take it to that fucking level or whatever. So I always thought it was stupid. You know, this is something like really like medieval about like is it looks like you're at a book burning or something when you sit in there burning a jersey, you know what I mean? It's like, is Jesus is going to come down the street with this cross neck? Next thing he'd start yelling, crucify him. It's, you know, at the end of the fucking day, who you know, who gives a shit? If you at the fucking options, Cleveland fans, all right? Of staying and miserable downtown Cleveland with all those miserable fucking fans are going to Miami beach with some of the hottest fucking ass that has ever been fucking grace the earth. You know? Beautiful fucking weather, right? You buy a hurricane proof house. I don't know what the fuck that looks like, but God knows if anybody had the money, it'd be a fucking professional athlete, you know? Of course you would go down there. You want a couple, two, three. What? He went three down there, I four or five [inaudible] six finals in a row and he'd come back to Cleveland. All right, you fucking Snowden conch. And we go and I'm going to say I'm going to go bigger on this one right now. I say if Lebron, if Lebron fucking leads the Cleveland Cavaliers to the championship tonight, tonight, tonight, gave seven, seven, seven, seven years. Um, in my mind he passed his Coby Brian. All right, I'm just pausing right now. Oh, what the fuck everybody's going to say all that shit. I just feel like a,

Speaker 1:          07:23          the level of leadership that he would have to show

Speaker 1:          07:27          in order to do that. You know what I mean? Compared to the teams that Coby played on where he had all this fucking help. You know what I mean? Cause I feel like Lebron's already done the Cobi Championship where you piled on with Shaq and all that fucking shit. He went down there with Dwayne Wade and all those guys, but to go to the middle of fucking nowhere as far as sports goes and lead a fucking sad sack, fucking city said sex city out of, out of the fucking they're cursed. Lack of championships is, is a way bigger accomplishment than any than any of copis five that he had. You know, my big beef with him is he, if Phil Jackson wasn't the coach and he didn't have major free agents signings there, they immediately became a 500 team with Colby score and 40 points a night. You know, just being like, well, I got my stats, you guys suck.

Speaker 1:          08:19          And then he just would walk off the court. I don't know. I, I would in my sports mine, my unathletic comedic sports mind, I put that with like, just watching like the Pistons walking off the court when the fucking bowls finally beat him. Those out of was just something fucking wrong about that walk in off the fucking court when he fucking share. Um, um, did she have a walk off the court that she walk off a battleship ever when, when she didn't think the sound was right? I have no fucking idea. Anyways, I'm plowing ahead here. Um, had an amazing fucking time. I did a Newark, New Jersey, um, performance ad, Santa, whatever the hell they called. They had some great shows. And then last night I played this some fucking place in, um, I don't know why. I don't know the names on this run. Um, hang on a second.

Speaker 1:          09:13          Typing in the password. One fucking word letter at a time. I played this place last night and it was the same venue where Mike Tyson knocked out fucking, uh, Michael Spinks. Now granted, you know, the way they sat it when he had zonked, I sold the same amount of tickets, believe me. Um, they can see it in all these different ways. So they sat it more for comedy show, but when he fucking did it, it was like right now a turtle Gadi fought there. All these amazing boxing matches, uh, had had been there. And if you went in there, man, I literally felt like I was in citizen Kane. I got to get you guys in the name of this fucking place. One of the more amazing places I've ever gotten to walk into. We had this old fucking, um, it's old organ there and shit is, it could still going to be on my website or not. Ah, for Fuck Sakes, Bill, Bill, er, ah, just go build a fucking dope Phenix city. Let's see. Let's see. Let's see. There's something ballroom come and get fence. You know, you fucking cow fucking, it just disappears. It's unbelievable. You get kicked in the balls at fucking lives forever on the Internet. Fucking one goddamn day later. I can't find it. Whatever. Well, Anik, I'll tell you, if you ever want to make a zillion dollars in Atlantic city, opened up a tattoo removal, fuck a tattoo removal store, whatever you called service Jesus Christ. Those were some of the worst fucking tattoos I've ever seen in my life.

Speaker 1:          10:48          What the fuck is the name of the venue? You can't, this is what I do and I can't figure it out. Just start landing city boardwalk hall. And um, actually, you know, my, my back has been way better, but just riding in a car, I don't know what it is. It just fucks with my leg. I get this, the nerve starts acting up again, but I'm like 85% of the way back. I'm really psyched. So, um, I didn't want to deal with driving that two hour thing down the turnpike. So, uh, I actually for once blue, a little bit of cash and uh, I took a helicopter ride down from the fucking west side of Manhattan Down to Atlantic City was the shit. I flew on an a star. Um, I've got to sit up right next to the pilot. I didn't get one of the seats in the back, which was cool. I bought a ticket and piled on this thing. Some other people going down there and I'm so fucking shit man. He came out like I was always terrified of being like, Oh man, I don't know if I would want to fly.

Speaker 1:          11:49          I still wouldn't, I would never fly around Manhattan without uh, in its, cause it's just so much fucking traffic but you just go out over the Hudson and just like you're driving down the street, you just get on the right side. I couldn't look over and see his gauges to see what altitude we were flying out. We went right down the Hudson River and um, by the freedom tower and all that stuff. And then we got to the other side. Now the other side, we've got the south side and this, um, you know the statue of Liberty's right there, Ellis island, and then we went right over the Verrazano Bridge and there's no way to fucking go over that thing and not think of fucking Saturday night fever. You know, when that fucking Guy Bobby, whatever his fucking name is, tries to do the head stay looking at me. I'm like, you guys, I look at me, they're like, Bobby, don't fucking do it by me.

Speaker 1:          12:38          And Him and his ball, he has to suit, just go all the way down to the fucking bottom. Man is fucking fucking unbelieve. I'm at that fucking scene. Scared the shit out of me when I was a kid, but now you know, just him as his fucking Afro and just fucking big call. You know, it's almost like if he went in head first, he would have been fine or actually maybe it would absorb too much water and he'd hit the bottom. I have no idea. But anyways, when we went over that, then we went over Red Bank, New Jersey, made a right and went right down the coast. Went by Asbury Park. So the forking Jersey shore. And it actually made me think like, I can't believe I never went to either one of those places. Um, went down to Atlantic City and then we, uh, had a great time down there and tonight I'm in Baltimore, so that's basically it.

Speaker 1:          13:24          But a fuck an underrated, underrated being in Manhattan, blowing a little bit of cash, piling onto a fucking helicopter with a few other fucking passengers get in the last seat and fucking flying by that amazing skyline, man. It was the shit. It was the shit. And I finally got to ride in an a star and a, it was way less intimidating than he thought it was going to be. I thought when I looked at the cockpit, all the gauges and everything branded, they were analog. I don't like that digital shit. I fucking hate that stuff. I don't trust it. I don't like it. I'm not a technology guy. I like when everything looks like a fucking weird clock, then I feel like I can read it. I don't, I don't like all that, that type of shit. So, um, anyway, so many minutes away up to here, I would do the advertising and they just don't know if it's come in yet.

Speaker 1:          14:10          Um, let's see if we got anything. Nothing. So anyways, as always, as I've been trying to mention here so I can support my fellow comics, um, if you liked this podcast or stuff like this or maybe you're sick of it and you'd like to listen to another one. Uh, we have, I feel the best collection of 'em of podcasts on of any other podcast network at the all things comedy network. We got Bert Kreischer, we got, uh, who else we got? We got a Phillippi Esparza's what's up fool podcasts? We've got Aaron Foley's fucking sports with the balls. We got Dean del Rey's let, let there be Doug. Stan. Hope this is murder is fucking row here. Bunch of other fucking people on here. Um, and it's all just high quality stuff. Eddie Pepitone, Tom Papa. Come on man. What else? She going to get podcasts like this, um, Tom Gore and your mom's house.

Speaker 1:          15:09          We got all kinds of stuff there. So, uh, um, let me click on a few of these here so I can give some shout outs. Ari Shaffir skeptic tank. Um, it's a great website and a, we just got some investors on it, which is great. So we're going to start having some more original content, which is why I'm trying to drive some traffic there. It'd be a good fucking team player. Okay. So after I do my show here tonight and beautiful fucking Baltimore, Baltimore, um, I'm flying, this is my fucking day. I'm flying out to la. I go right into the writer's room and after that I'm doing a, I'm doing a benefit that's really important to me. Um, great friend of mine, Bobby Slayton, unfortunately his wife passed away a few months ago and we're doing a, a benefit and memory of her at the Saban theater and a Beverly hills and uh, the fucking lineups.

Speaker 1:          15:59          Ridiculous. Arsenio Hall is hosting and there's a few other up and coming comics you might have heard of. Like, I dunno, Ray Romano, Dana Carvey, Jon Lovitz, Brian Regan, Bob Saget, and I'll be a fucking pulling up the rear there, a low man on the totem pole and that show would definitely be me. Um, I'm a huge fan of all of those guys, so I can't believe I'm going to get to work with them. Um, unfortunately it's not the greatest reasons why we're doing it, but um, we love Bobby and um, it's a great benefit. There are a few tickets left. It's going to be a crazy show and I have a feeling all those guys are going to be fucking with each other cause they known each other for so long and a, I want to be like beyond a fan boy that night. And then, uh, then after that I go home and then I go right on a fucking plane. I have to go back to New York because a got to work with some actors to do some voiceovers. We're up to episode eight. Everybody. No recording episodes. Seven. Huh? Dog Days of summer. We'll come around but coming around so fucking psyched. We're up to episode seven. We're going to do the table reef episode, April accord, the table, uh, the fucking episode. Um,

Speaker 1:          17:13          uh, next week. Hey, you know, I just realized, you know, be cool if there's, if one of you guys out there want it to come to a table read, I got to figure out how to do a, uh, some sort of contest or something. Maybe bringing in for episode 10, whenever we record that. Uh, I don't know why the fuck I never thought to do that. You know, it's funny, I don't even invite my wife to him. I'm so busy like pouring over the script, making sure, you know, I don't fuck up the jokes at the table read, but um,

Speaker 1:          17:40          you know what, I'm going to figure out how to do that and I'm, I'm promising you right now, by next Thursday. Yeah, Thursday podcast. We'll have something set up for that. I think that'd be a really cool, if you're into the show, if you're not into the show, then you probably be like, well, hey bill, maybe I just want to go get a fucking cheese stick or some shit. Cheese, steak, sorry. Anyways, let me, uh, what else do I want to talk about here? This is usually where I do the fucking advertising. I guess I can't this week. Um,

Speaker 3:          18:07          okay.

Speaker 1:          18:07          Oh, formula one racing, how the European Grand Prix over there. Um, I actually didn't get a chance to watch that because I stayed out too late, but I did tape it. But spoiler alert, spoiler alert, a Nico Rosberg fucking Nico, Nico Rosberg, he won his fifth fucking race, right? One, two, three, four, five. He's won five of them. He's the points leader. He's a, he's with the German team.

Speaker 3:          18:36          Okay.

Speaker 1:          18:37          And he's just funny. Ross Park, you know what I mean? It's about time they fucking made up for it. Had a Jewish guy drive for them, you know, um, I don't even know if he's Jewish or anything, but he also drives from Mercedes. So I always root for Germany and Mercedes because, uh, I've never done a background check, but I think I'm mostly German just based on, uh, what my parents have told me. Um,

Speaker 1:          19:00          but oh my God, I saw the pictures of it too, just driving through this beautiful fucking city. I don't know where the fuck I been for so goddamn long when it comes to Formula One. Now of course me, cause I'm a psycho. Somebody told me about the fucking, you know, the basically the former formula one of motorcycle racing. Um, I don't know why I'm not watching that. I sit there and I flip out where I love all these fucking crazy contact sports. Right. You know, I like rugby, Australian rules, football and this fucking Mad Max shift that people been showing me lately where it's sort of rugby sort of soccer and after somebody scores you can punch him in the face. I don't know what the fuck that is. It's like football, soccer, rugby in bullying all at the same fucking time, man. It's just, I dunno about that. Sports you don't, you don't think it was missing was just to have a couple of bowls run in there and just start fucking trampling people. Um,

Speaker 3:          19:55          okay.

Speaker 1:          19:55          But anyways, uh, let me shut this fucking TV off. This is really fucking with my brain here. Um, I don't know why if I liked all that type of shit. Why watching somebody ride a motorcycle 200 fucking miles an hour. Um, it's absolutely, and you know, it is amazing to me is these guys are so good that when they go down, they don't die somehow. You think they, I mean, not saying people don't die, but you'd think they would die every fucking time. You know what I mean?

Speaker 3:          20:24          Okay.

Speaker 1:          20:25          The fact that you can wear a fucking suit

Speaker 1:          20:30          that is so God damn strong, you to go 200 miles an hour and you could fall off your fucking bike and it just doesn't like what should happen there is like after fucking two seconds of skidding on the asphalt at 200 miles an hour immediately you should just see guy's ass. His bear has, should be there. And then you just see it looks like steak and then it would look like bones and then that would just be it and the guy would be dead. You would think that that would happen every time. And these fucking guys just slide in these goddamn soaps there were incredible. Not saying people don't die. But um, I think, um, I think this is sort of my next thing man. Cause like, you know what's funny, this time of year when hockey ends and basketball ends, everybody a football fan, you know, Pixie the hockey or hoop for the most part.

Speaker 1:          21:18          All right, very few go hockey and then wait and go baseball. I only know a couple guys like that. So people go hockey or fucking hoop and um, people who watch hockey don't watch who people watch hoop, don't fucking watch hockey. They have nothing in common with each other. And the only thing that they have in common with each other other than their love of football is the sheer fucking panic of the day after the game. Seven or your final or your finals when that's over and you're like, holy fuck, what am I going to do now for the next two and a half fucking months is I wait for the NFL regular season to start. And I'm not shitting on baseball cause I love baseball. I just that that the fucking dog days of summer, I can't stand like, you know who the fuck wants to go out to the ballpark?

Speaker 1:          22:01          It's like fucking a hundred degrees out. You know, who does die hearts, I guess I'm not a die hard baseball fan, but I love it. I love it in uh, October. So I needed a sport and Formula One dude, I'm telling you like the race today was, it was only like something like 50 something laps. You can really just sit down and they bang it out in a couple of hours. You know, you get to learn about other fucking cities, you know, half of them they go to you like, oh shit, I'd like to go there. It all those people hanging out, calling it right now. At some point I'm going to hit a fucking country when they have a formula one race is actually one here. It says, the United States says United States Grand Prix for the life of me, I think it's an Austin, Texas, which is really disappointing to me that that's where they're going to fucking have it.

Speaker 1:          22:48          You know what I mean? Why the fuck is it in Austin, Texas? They should have that thing in like Chicago, Chicago should have a Formula One fucking race. That's a cool ass fucking city, you know, fucking zipping over the rivers at one point. Only one car could make it, they'd probably kill each other. Um, I don't even know what the track looks like in Austin, but um, all I know is Austin is a great city. Once you're in it, trying to get to it with that fucking traffic is an absolute God damn nightmare. So, um, anyways, I guess this is a place here where I would actually pause, right? And I would do some sort of advertising. Um, I'm just going to say this so I can edit it in later. Uh, we're going to pause here right now. The little bit of that advertising, where the fuck is my reads?

Speaker 1:          23:35          Come on, give me the reeds gave me the reeds. Ah, you can't. All right. But you know what? It doesn't matter you guys because this is not going to be in real time for yourself. Oh my God. Is this podcast suck? As bad as it sounds in my fucking head right now. Um, you know, is going to say about Baltimore. Every time I go to the Baltic, Baltimore, the Baltimore, I always think about the wire and I was going to go, I remember the wire and then I was going to go boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, which is for Lauren order. I can't even remember how the fucking song went. I just remember the song in the end, the guy was screaming up and as you can tell, I'm kind of losing my fucking voice with the voiceover shit and screaming about my deck here on stage.

Speaker 1:          24:15          Um, but you know what I'm psyched about. He's my fucking act as coming together and I'm getting ready to do another special, I think I'm going to do it in October and all I gotta do is just get through these last three fucking episodes. Okay. Give 100% on that shit and then that's it. Then all of a sudden it's, it's old Billy fucking flank steak. Remember when I said I wasn't going to drink? You know, I fucked up on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. Okay. But I was great Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Sunday, right. So when I get back, I'm going back to not drink it. I gotta, I gotta get back off this, but I just, I dunno what happened, you know, I fucking, uh, I don't want to happen. You know what I mean? What happened? I went on the fucking road. That's what happened. And I went to New York and I met up with some fucking friends and like, Hey, let's go to this fucking bar.

Speaker 1:          25:01          And then, you know, it's like one of these wine bars, you know, so you don't feel like you're drinking. So I showed up, you know, another buddy of mine, it's fucking comic. I'm not going to say, I don't want to name any names, but this guy's fucking hilarious. And he comes in and it was hilly verse, he called him out. He just goes like, cause he showed up and uh, I know what you're saying, but why did you go to a wine bar? Because there were ladies there and that's what they fucking picked, right? So like, I will fucking go there. So he shows up and I immediately go, dude, it's a wine bar. I don't, cause he wanted a beer and a shot and I, his face fucking dropped in first. He called out, he goes through the level of fucking disappointment on your face.

Speaker 1:          25:41          And then we find out that they had beer and they did have a shot, but it was just, you know, this foofy place. So the dude goes, uh, they go, can't get some drink. He goes, yeah, can I just get a, a, a bud light? And the guy's like, ah, yeah, no, we don't, we don't have bud light. Uh, we have, we have a blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, whatever the fuck it is, some Italian beer. And he goes, guys, like, Oh, what? And he's like, have a Bob on the ball, but he just goes, is, is, is that a beer? And the guy goes, yeah. And he goes, all right, I'll have one of those. And, uh, I don't know what happened. And we started doing Tequila shots in the whole fucking thing. Went off the rails, and I'm a fat fuck. And I all like myself right now there.

Speaker 1:          26:18          I said it a fucking in a hotel, Roman Baltimore eating French fries in bed. Huh? Like some fucking, I don't know, somebody whose dreams didn't come true. That's who we just, French fries in bed or maybe people who fucking everything worked out for him and then just so fucking bored. They, you know, like Marlon Brando, whatever the fuck his issue was. Oh, I've won every award that exists. Bring me a fucking elk. Said he just sat in bed just non on the fucking antlers for like 10 years and all of a sudden, you know, he's ready to do the fucking, what is it? What the fuck? Gorilla monsoon movie. I have bio pic. I have no, I don't know how those things work. I don't pretend to fucking know. Um, so anyways, we're going to pause here for a little bit of advertising the floor. We come back with a Monday morning podcast. Okay. And we're back. Um, so I figured, forget, I'll take me a good fucking three minutes to read those constantly. Maybe five minutes or whatever. Send me is I can get to the, I can get to the, uh, the questions right now. Can I, I think I can't, don't get too close to them. Like bill second, you fucking s exhale. It all goes off the fucking rails. Um,

Speaker 1:          27:32          all right, here we go.

Speaker 1:          27:34          All right, advice first. You know, some kind of fucking Ireland, some cutting island gave me shit about the ticket prices. I think that's a little bit too much. I think you're funny. It's like, hey dude, how about the fact I'm flying from the other side of the fucking world? Almost Santee your fucking doorstep. That's not enough for you. Who's going to pay for all that fuel? Um, all right, here we go. Advice for, for a daft Scotsman. Hey there, you're redheaded con. Uh, I cannot fucking wait to go back to Scotland are lit and all these fucking places, these miserable conscious, some of the funniest people you'll ever going to meet. All right. He says, I'm 26 year old guy from near Glasgow, Scotland. Um, for quite a while I was in a bit of a Rut, but eventually I managed to pick myself out of it and decided to do something that I've always wanted to do.

Speaker 1:          28:27          I took a big step and decided to buy a ticket to a festival in Chicago. I was the Shit I love Chicago, said I booked my flights and I'll be in the city for a week. That's tremendous. So basically my question is as I'll be traveling alone and we'll be staying alone, how easy is it to just hang around and strike up conversations with complete strangers in a different country? Have you ever found difficulties in finding common ground in conversation with people from different countries? Also, any full pause I should avoid when talking to Americans so I can prevent getting my cunt kicked in. All the best you fat shaming, Prick. Um, all right. So a lot of questions there. Um,

Speaker 3:          29:12          yeah,

Speaker 1:          29:12          well the only time I ever traveled is when I, I, I'm doing stand up. And then after the show there's always people that just saw you do a show. So I've already broken the ice. But, um, first things first, why don't I tell you a couple of places to go to from my little fucking places to go, thing that I have in my fucking phone that my wife used to make fun of. She made fun and places to go and she was laughing and then, you know what? We went to one of those fucking places and then all of sudden, you know, she's just, she has total faith in it now she tells me, hit it. All right, here's what I would go. All right if you like a nice fucking a great fucking bar for music and that type of thing, I'd go to the Liar's club.

Speaker 1:          29:56          Um, if you like cigars is a place, big cigar pouring them, check that fucking place up. And then as far as food and all that shit, I would just tweet about it because a, I'm not a big fan of, of, of deep dish pizza. You know what I mean? I just don't understand it. I don't understand deep dish patient pizza the way I don't understand why white coffee and tea have to be so fucking hot. You know what I mean? I went, so it gets to the fucking, the tea bag all in the water maybe. Is that what the fuck it is? I just don't understand. But you have to wait like an hour before you can drink it without scalding your fucking mouth. And when it comes to deep dish pizza, it's, it's just, it's just too fucking much,

Speaker 1:          30:41          you know? And he can't just get a slice of it that they bring the fucking thing over. It's, it's like, hey, you want some lasagna? Yeah, but not a whole fucking tray, you know? Um, but you should definitely try it. If you get one that actually has a really good crust, it is pretty amazing. But it's just like, I mean, you can literally split one piece with somebody else. It's so fucking big. And, uh, my wife said the funniest shit about it. She called it an abomination. She goes, it's the ultimate expression of American gluttony. She goes, go to Italy, you won't see anything, anything over there like it. And it's true. But we went to Italy, you know, they have like, we have all our American versions of their dishes, you know what I mean? But there's no deep dip, deep, deep dish pizza in Italy, at least not in any place. We went to enrollment. It's the only place I've been to. But you don't see it. Uh, that's what she said. And she goes, you know why? Because it's an abomination. Um, so anyways, uh, as far as I found in that, that Liar's club, uh, people were fucking cool as hell. If you're into the music and shit, it's a good time. But Dude, you're going to be coming over with the fucking accent. I wouldn't go to the fucking, you know,

Speaker 1:          31:56          I, you know, it depends on what you went to. I would go to, uh, a place where this going to be a bunch of beautiful women. That's what I would do it. And then you go over there and he just fucking, just, just start talking and I think you'll be in the fucking game and there'll be, who'd you come over here with? Vr Guy came over by myself. I want to always wanted to come to Chicago and just literally, you know how hall watching, what do you fucking Berge do? Whatever the of a fuck you guys talk, right?

Speaker 1:          32:23          Who the fuck you fuck you do over here for fun? Yes. Garrett wearing could write whatever the fuck you going to say and they're going to love it. They're going to love it. Even if you ask him, hey for fucking Shag, any however the fuck you say fucking and your country, it's going to seem so cool. Them, it's so different. And then also they're going to be more adventurous because you know, you're the stories leaving with you when you go back, when you fly back to Scotland. Um, how can you avoid getting your head kicked in? Um, don't do what everybody else from other countries do is you come here and you criticize the United States and talk about how dumb we are, how fat we are, how awful the foreign policy is, how uh, our football players are pussies cause they wear pads. Why do you call it football? All of that dumb shit. You know what I mean? It's so fucking obnoxious,

Speaker 2:          33:17          you know?

Speaker 1:          33:19          You know why it's obnoxious because they, those kinds of people always come here and they act like these. There are these worldly traveled people, you know, oh, I come from here and I come from there and we can do this and we can do that. And it's just like, well, in all of that fucking travel, you never learned to be on your best behavior when he come to somebody's country and you don't come in and insulted. So you make your whole country look like a bunch of fucking snobby cons. You never learned that one. I am. I'm on my best fucking behavior when I go to a different country. I'm not saying I'll go out and get fucking hammered, but like I don't go there and shit on it.

Speaker 2:          33:54          You know,

Speaker 1:          33:55          some of these places I go to, I'm fucking talking to people. I know this place is nice. There was that. Why the fuck did you come here? We, I was looking, I was in Oslo, Norway. I said, you know, you guys were, thanks. Slide you guys, but great. I'll definitely be back. It's somebody yelled out why? It just struck. I was like, why? What do you mean? Why? Why the fuck wouldn't I,

Speaker 1:          34:19          it's fucking beautiful. I don't know. Anyway, so I would avoid doing that. Um, and then just everything else is common sense. You know, somebody, you know, looking like a psycho, just fucking leave him alone. But I don't know dude. I, I mean I judge a lot of Scotland on that movie. Trainspotting or I just feel like I don't go into any bars with is an upper deck to it. Cause I just feel like there's going to be that guy up there that's going, just finish his fucking pint, just throw the glass over his head, cut open some woman's face. Like I just, you know, if it's even remotely like that over there, I think you're going to be fine in Chicago. Um, I would definitely try to go to a cubs game. Uh, no offense to white sox fans, but you know, you guys all know that you fucking stadium stinks.

Speaker 1:          35:02          You know, it stinks. It's the only time I ever saw a stadium, a new stadium built, and they admitted so quickly like, wow, we really fucked this up. Let's try it. Like it was like a botch nose job. You know what I mean? Like your stadium is, is the fucking stadium version of like, you know, when some Hollywood chick or somebody, they get too much work done on their face and people, oh my God, what happened? That's what you did do with that stadium. They're like, well, let's wait till it settles. Let's see what happens. You know? All right, so there you go. But Dude, you picked a great fucking city to go to. Chicago is the shit and then you picked a great time of the year to go there. Um, I will tell you the traffic is fucking horrific, so just get ready for that.

Speaker 1:          35:39          But once you're in it, it's fucking phenomenal. Um, all right, what do we go here? All right, uh, dear Billy, stretchy pants on your podcast sometime back, you were talking about someone getting with someone else and one of the people gaining a bunch of weight. Oh yeah. When you start dating somebody, how it's not fair to the other person for you to then put on a bunch of fucking weight. Um, unless you're a woman, you having a baby that's obviously, you know, I'm not a fucking animal here, but I'm just saying, you know, after you have the kid, you know, that's, that's when you know, after your wife has a kid too, things should happen. This is what you do. You get a little bassinet for the beautiful baby and then the second thing you do is you get an elliptical for your wife, but so she doesn't get mad at you.

Speaker 1:          36:27          What you do is you get her initials engraved on the side of it in plastic. Of course. Totally kidding. All right. Um, I was already a few weeks into whipping myself back into shape. Uh, okay. Let me just start this over again cause I've even forgot what the fuck he's talking about. On Your podcast sometimes back you sometime back you were talking about someone getting with someone else and one of the people gaining a bunch of weight. I was already a few weeks into whipping myself back into shape, but this really helped me solidify my will. Well, that's fucking great, man. It's great. I wish she can you help me because I, you know what's sitting in a fucking writer's room is like, I eat there like the way I eat on the road. I mean, I, it's just fucking hard to try to eat healthy. It's just, you're just bored.

Speaker 1:          37:12          You're freaking out. You're locked in the fucking room and you're like, oh, I'm going to eat some fucking candy for no reason. I'm sitting there everyday like, it's Halloween and I'm fucking seven years old. I got to stop. All right. It made me think that I should really give my lady the respect of maintaining something close to the body I had when she got on this train. Uh, she loves me. She stayed with me in spite of the lumpy beanbag chair I have become, and now I'm 15 pounds down with a bunch more to go, but I am back on my routine. Four or five trips to the gym at five 30 in the morning. Dude, you're fucking killing it. That's great. And Calorie counting as well. I know exactly what to do. It's just the time. Now my question is this, how do you deal with it if you're lady wants you to eat the same stuff she is or wants to go to a shitty fried food restaurant.

Speaker 1:          38:02          Anyways, thanks man. Hope season two of F is for family is coming along. Well. It is. Thank you sir. Can't wait to see it. And I loved your last show in Austin. Hurry back. Can come during the football season. We had a monster fucking recruiting class this year. Thanks you bastard. Oh that's great man. You could, longhorn should be good. So the legendary a college program there. All right. Um, all right. How do you deal with, I would just say I want to just, that's easy as easy. Just sit down with her and just say, hey listen, you know, when you got with me, I was however years old and I w I weighed this much and I don't think it's fair for me to have put on all this fucking weight, you know? And they'd be looking like a lumpy beanbag chair, like you said.

Speaker 1:          38:45          So I'm really trying to get myself back into shape. So I was wondering if, you know, you know, if you want to eat something that's a little, uh, unhealthy, is there any way we just can go to a place that has healthy options for me? All right. Because a, I don't want to look bad for you and I also don't want to die early, so you're fucking, you know, in your forties and 50s having to put lipstick on and get the fuck back out there again and try to meet somebody who works down at Sears, you know? And I don't, I don't want to do that to you. I'd like to be here for the long haul there. There's no fucking way she, she'll give you shit about that, that, that's a very easy thing to have happen, you know? And then also, I think, sorry, I'm looking at the timer.

Speaker 1:          39:25          I also think that she would be happy to hear that you, you weren't just doing this for some vein reason yourself, that you would actually also doing it for her. I think that that would be pretty cool. Now, watch now watch. He'll fucking getting some big fucking fight. You know, I, you think the thing I eat bad. She say I'm fat. You know, she blows her sales manager. All right. Read this. Okay. All right. I'm going to read this. Relax. Uh, what's up dickhead? Let's go fucking bro and can't wait for next season. I just moved to wildly mediocre Los Angeles. Uh, well yeah, that's what you're going to feel like cause you just fucking move there. Um, but if you stay open minded, which is really difficult for east coast people to do. I did that the first time I came to la. I went to La and I tried to do Boston New York Shit.

Speaker 1:          40:15          And then when I couldn't, I was like, oh, there's police spoken. Sucks. It doesn't, it's fucking amazing. Beautiful women. Some of the best food you ever going to have so much outdoor activity. Just fucking embrace it. Stop trying to be the fucking Boston guy. You're not on a reality shelf. All right. Take it down a few fucking notches. Nobody gives a fuck in Los Angeles that you don't like it. Everybody just thinks, well then go back to fucking Boston. Go back to Philly. Wherever the fuck you're from. If it's so fucking great. Why did you accept a job out here? All right, sorry, I'm just heading you off for the past before you come. Another cont shitting on fucking la and he said I worked for the UFC editing fight highlights. Uh, thanks for keeping me entertained with your semi literate babble babble. Bullshit. Day after day.

Speaker 1:          41:00          This is like a classic East Coast Guy. He really likes me and likes what I, what I do, but he just can't get himself to say it cause his dad never hugged him. So I'm not taking any of this personally anyway. My girlfriend is about to move here to meet me. Uh, she had to stay behind when I moved because she's a teacher. Needed to finish out the school year. Uh, we get along great. I trust her and she treats me better than I deserve. However, sometimes I can't take how ditzy she can be. Uh, uh, starting to pull some threads. Here she is successful and very book smart but sometimes lacks common sense. I find feeling embarrassed when she says some stupid shit in front of my friends or parents. It's kind of a hard thing to discuss with her though. You know what Shit, what the fuck should I do? Also, I'm coming to your show at the same theater this Monday. I'm looking forward to it, so don't blow it. Well I appreciate you coming out to that. Like I said, it was, you know, a really good friend of mine and for a great cause. Uh, so thank you for doing that. All right,

Speaker 1:          41:59          well here's the deal dude. You either have to accept the fact that she can be a little ditsy or you have to come to the realization that you're dating a fucking dope and you got to get rid of her. It's one of the other, um, I mean, look, she doesn't sound like she's 100% that I've dated. People like that that were a little, you know, they were either locked in or just sort of floating. It was really weird and they could say really like amazing. Like spot on shit. And then two minutes later could just could say something like, oh my God, what the fuck was that? Um, but I have to tell you that's kind of a, that's kind of a big deal. They'll do, you know, you can't think that the person you're dating is a dope, you know, you get into that situation and uh, I dunno, you start thinking about getting married, you start thinking about having kids.

Speaker 1:          42:51          You're like, is my kid going to be half a dope or a full on dope is used as a kid going to get all of that DNA from her? Who the fuck knows I'm all right. It's kind of hard to think to discuss with her, you know, what are you gonna say to her? Can you stop saying Dumb Shit? I mean, this, there's no way to do that, you know, I'm trying to think of, that's like my wife telling me to work on my team. I mean, I do work on my temper, but I mean, it's Kinda how I made up.

Speaker 1:          43:18          I mean, if somebody ditzy, they're fucking ditzy. That would be like my wife telling me, okay, can you be a little less pasty? It's like, ah, I can, I can become red for a few days as well. That's about the best I could do. I don't know what else you want from me, but uh, you know, I think you, uh, need to maybe move on. I'm not saying you need to move on. Yeah. You either accept this about her or ego. You got to walk one of the Yoga. Um, all right, here's another one. Jesus Christ can't come and I don't mean to the wedding. Um, how's it going, Billy? Butterballs uh, if you're reading this on Monday, it's fucking sick. June 20th will is my 21st birthday. Oh, Jesus. I don't know what's going on here. Great gift hearing you read this. Uh, well you're not going to hear it until the fucking Monday anyways.

Speaker 1:          44:08          All right. I'm mealling mealling I'm emailing today though, is I was with this girl last summer, some good sex, no big deal, but we didn't have anything going on during the year when we were at college. Well, we're back at it this summer, but the thing is I can't come. I mean, I'm doing good. Pretty good. Uh, p p m pumps per, but I just can't finish now. I know you're not a doctor, so not going to ask you why, but how should I go about this? I think she's getting self conscious, but she's a hard eight and I'm a soft six. She's hot. It's not a fault. Daddy can finish. Daddy can't finish when the pressure is on. How should I be playing this? I can only laugh it off for so long. I'll try not jerking off to, maybe that'll help. Any advice. Thanks for the read, man.

Speaker 1:          45:00          Oldfield be able to come check you out when you come back. East Coast, maybe Baltimore and Sunday. Go sox. Go Fuck Yourself. Uh, yeah. I, you know, don't rub one out. If you're watching too much porn, maybe that's a problem. Or maybe, you know, you don't want to be in a relationship with her. And that's the weird way your body's reacting. Like you're wasting time. Um, so we're not going to fuck it. I don't know if there's a billion psychological go reasons, but yeah, I, yeah, just don't rub one out for awhile. You know, this is another thing too. Women are fucking, they're very forgiving people. If I would, I wouldn't laugh it off. I would talk to her about it and just say, listen, obviously this is happening. It's bothering me. Um, I'm feeling pressure about it and I'm also feeling like in a round about, I just don't want you to be taken my issue on like, this something you are doing, you're not doing anything wrong.

Speaker 1:          45:51          There's something going on with me. And then she'll be like, well, maybe you should go talk to somebody about it. And because you're a fucking red sox fan, I'm assuming you're from the Boston area, you don't want to go to therapy. And even if you do go to therapy, it's not going to help because you probably have enough Irish blood in you. And they always said, who is that fucking psychologist that said the Irish are like immune to therapy. Um, I dunno if you liked this girl, I would definitely talk to her about it. But, uh, there's no reason to put any pressure on yourself, you know what I mean? Just don't rub one out. Don't watch any porn. Just a, you know, I dunno. Just let it back up. I don't fucking know. I'm not a doctor. Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ started. Here we go. Here we go.

Speaker 1:          46:35          Winded down. Wind it down. All right. Heroin. Um, I have no family, no friends. I work in support myself. I have no kids, no relationship. I actually enjoy freedom and being alone to an extent. I'm in my twenties. I had a lot of sex relationships and ended up getting herpes. Slash. HPV. I would basically rather just not tell people and not have relationships than to have. Then they have to have 35 years old. Uh, didn't have to at 35 years old. Deal with having to explain slash tell this to women. I really like heroin. Uh, what the fuck? Jesus Christ. Buddy, what are you, what are we doing here is, this doesn't sound real. I really like heroin. I go to work, come home and use heroin on a daily basis. I still pay my bills. I still work, but I've traded the pleasure of sex slash having a family slash relationships for that, of watching TV shows slash movies while high on falling asleep, then going to work the next day. Should I change this?

Speaker 2:          47:34          Okay.

Speaker 1:          47:35          Is this a, I'll try it. You know what, I'll, I'll treat it as real. Um, should I listen to society, stop using, go out there and find women and tell them about my situation and hope they do not reject me and get clean or if I am happy, is it okay for me to just accept the women part of my life is over, eat whatever I want, use whatever drug I want and fill the time I have left on this planet watching shows, movies, playing games, and resigning myself to the fact that I will be alone. Love the podcast. Heroine gets a bad rap. It may sound crazy, but people can use opiates and still be responsible. I know many people who do, it's like alcohol. Both can be physically. This is really fascinating. Um, uh, or for, maybe it's a big lie. I Dunno.

Speaker 1:          48:21          It's alcohol. It's like alcohol. Both can be physically addictive. Alcohol can actually kill you with withdrawals. Why heroin cannot. And the deaths you hear about heroin are from idiots overdosing. Um, if we, well, what if you get a bad batch and that something, you know it's too fucking strong. Um, I dunno. I don't pretend to know. All right. If we reported all the deaths from alcohol involved incidents, they're easy. Well they do report all of them. As far as I know, it's like they're trying to hide them. They are easily 100 times more than heroin related deaths. But in our society right now, opiates are not acceptable because too many white middle class parents are finding their idiot kids using them without understanding tolerance slash

Speaker 2:          49:08          okay.

Speaker 1:          49:08          Proper dosing anyways, love the podcasts. I'm not leaving any contact info so I have no way to know if you read this, just thought it might be an interesting subject for your show. It is interesting. Um,

Speaker 2:          49:21          okay.

Speaker 1:          49:21          Yeah, dude, I don't pretend to know anything about opiates. All I do know is that the, um, I know alcohol can ruin your life, but I don't think it's nearly as addicting as heroin. I actually have heard that people can fucking,

Speaker 2:          49:37          yeah,

Speaker 1:          49:38          I don't know. But I think, I think if, if, if what you're saying is true, I think you're a rare person that can handle that. I have no idea. Oh fuck. Now I got to look some shit up. The last thing I wanted to do and I got to get going here. I got my fucking show here and a half hour, uh oh. The live reads or hear the live reads are here. I guess I'll read them here then. Let me just see something. Let me just look up. What do I look up productive while on heroin, heroin and employment. Independent drug morrow. Let's see.
