Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on is bill barn. It's the Monday morning podcast for Monday, uh, November 24th, 2014 2014. How are you, what's going on? Once again, I'm recording it nice and early Monday morning. Uh, you know, so I gotta keep my freaking voice down. I don't want to disturb the construction. It's winding down everybody. It's winding down. They painted the fucking walls, you know. Well it goes a couple of little bit of electrical things. A couple of big bank boons, which of course will take for fucking ever. Um, I actually found out that I need a new electrical panel outside my house because, uh, the one that I had was, uh, you know, just a hunk of shit and a, so I go out. Right. So take the one off that I have and put a new one there. Right. And this fucking governmental cont right. He shows up with this fucking tape measure and he said there was no safe way for his guys to put a ladder up because they had this fucking palm tree thing.

Speaker 1:          00:01:12       Right. Which now, and even natural. Okay. To the ecosystem out here. Some jerk off, liked him way back in the day and stuck a fucking coconut on his boat or whatever the hell the seed is, right? Is that the seat of a palm tree? Is it a coconut or is that the fruit? It bears and within the coconut there's the seed. I don't know. Um, so anyways, so he goes, Nah, the only place we can stick it is right on the back of your fucking house where it's going to be the ugliest ever. And I'm like, well no, we're not putting it there. And he's like, Claire worked for the government, right? So he goes to get out there and his government issued Ford escort station wagon number, those fucking things. Um, so I had to call the guy up and he's got a, he's got to cut this fucking tree down. And I know what you're thinking. Well, wait a minute. I thought you were fucking, uh, oh, Billy tree hugger, you know, or William Environment. A William tell their right of the fucking guy. The guy who wrote about a lake Winnipesaukee there. Walden Lake. Who was that fucking boring cunt that wrote all the poems. You know, everybody was freaking out, all this shit he was saying he was plagiarizing the native Americans. They already fucking knew. They already knew it was a great lake. All right? They have fucking a twinkle toes with your stupid poems.

Speaker 1:          00:02:38       The date of Americans had it right the way they will live and they lived off the fucking land. They didn't take more than they need that they needed. Right. And when you got sick, some weird guy and you're fucking tribe did a dance around you and then you died and that was it. Okay. And it kept the herd thinned out.

Speaker 2:          00:02:56       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:57       No, he came out there with some, the skull of a fucking snake or some shit on his head.

Speaker 2:          00:03:05       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:05       Putting line dance into shame is what this guy did. And then you fucking die. That's, it was fucking over. Hey, you had a great 30 years. See Ya. Whatever. They deny its natural. Geronimo, he lived for a while, didn't he? He used to get the senior citizen discount when he took the stage coach after a while, you know, wants to white man took over. Isn't that what happened?

Speaker 2:          00:03:30       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:31       Oh fuck that again on this subject.

Speaker 2:          00:03:34       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:35       Oh yeah. Taking down the fucking tree. So now I've got to take down this. Just I could take down this fucking, so basically I'm like, all right, so what if I take out the tree that really shouldn't even be here, that provides shade in an area that you know, never had shade because it's actually a fucking desert. And you know, by the way, what are we all doing out here?

Speaker 2:          00:03:54       Huh?

Speaker 1:          00:03:56       We're all standing around trying to get a fucking

Speaker 1:          00:04:01       goddamn guest star on the reboot of fucking Tj Hooker. Why are we out here as fucking place? Just freaks me out. Absolutely. Freaks me out. Um, anyways, uh, so now I got, I got that. So then whatever, so they got it, then they'll put the panel on and then my electrical system will be complete. I can actually turn lights on in my house and not worry that somewhere in my house does a little flash of fire when I throw a switch because that's what was going on. That was going on while I had a minor gas leak.

Speaker 1:          00:04:38       It's fucking unreal. I'm going to tell you right now, whoever buys this house after me is going to be, they're not even going to realize the Goddamn goldmine that they walked into cause all this shit that I'm doing, it does not add value to my house. This is all shit that should have been done right to begin with. You know, it's just when somebody, you know, inspect your house, they can't look into the walls. All they're looking for is the sweat marks on the walls and the cracks and can you roll a marble across the floor, you know, without even giving any effort. You know, they just looking at shit like that. You know, he was getting home. They go walk on your roof. They go up there and they have a sandwich and rubbed their balls for a couple of seconds. It's probably could have made and leafs and that's it. What's it gonna get a bad recommendation? I don't remember who it was. You think I can find that guy's business card to warn other people? Oh, by the way, this guy came back with the little glint in his eye and said, is the great, has you guys will be very happy and gradually you get yourself a great house. Um, anyways, so whoever comes in next and then this is the thing, they won't even appreciate it. Just like the rich kids son, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:05:54       the son of a guy who fucking pulled himself up

Speaker 3:          00:05:57       by his bootstraps, you know, gotten into insider trading.

Speaker 3:          00:06:04       You know, fucking bootleg some booze across the fucking God damn. Whatever the fuck it is. One of those great lakes. I was like, fuck fucking Greg. Right? Then he goes out and buy some palatial estate. He gets himself a trophy wife. He gets on top of her right, boom. Nine months later, here comes this fucking jerk off. He's born with one of those fucking, uh, you call the other one little piece of glass in your eye. Not a false, a monocle. He doesn't get rattled. He doesn't get a baby fucking bear. They give them a Monica. Let's how fucking rich this kid isn't. He actually has a little fucking a pocket watch. He's got a little pocket in his diaper. That's how much money this fucking kid is born into. And you think he gives a shit. He sits around and he's bored, right?

Speaker 2:          00:06:55       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:06:56       Grabs a handful of Molly and starts rubbing up against the suit of armor in the fucking house. Right? That's what the fuck he does. You think he gives a shit or even even fucking knows that he's got state of the Ark, state of the art fucking electricity in, in, in copper piping going through that fucking 9,000 square foot Cabana. No, he doesn't cheat bill. You're kind of making yourself out to be a martyr. I am anyways. Okay. It's fucking shit. Seven in the morning. I'm already getting fucking text messages.

Speaker 2:          00:07:35       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:07:36       just never fuck it. Never fucking ends. It never ends. So anyways, so that's the latest thing was this, this thing. We got the hardwood floors in and a couple of you guys said, you know, after you've been bitching about this for so long, you have better sense. You better put up some pictures. You know what I say to you? Fuck you. You're not seeing one goddamn picture my downstairs I am painting a picture with the beautiful words of this wonderful language. Now I'm not showing you what the inside of my house looks like.

Speaker 2:          00:08:05       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:08:05       you want me to upload what the inside of my fucking house looks like? So then what you guys can say, it looks like shit and that I got ripped off and then I'm a fucking big headed moron. You think? I don't understand how you guys operate at this point. I may have a Charlie Brown fucking head, but if you think I'm going to walk up and try to kick that football again, you're out of your fucking mind. All right? So anyways, this is the Monday morning podcast. Everybody, if you're new to it, welcome. If you're from another country, you stay put, you stay, you stay right where you are. We don't need you anymore. All right.

Speaker 2:          00:08:44       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:08:45       We're doing just fine with the immigrants that were abusing over here right now.

Speaker 3:          00:08:51       You sit the fuck down. I don't even know what's going on. There's some sort of immigration thing going on in the news and everybody's fucking flapping their arms. You're right. And the guys in the red ties are going again. I'm the fuck Outta here. And the guys in the blue ties or like, you know, I think everybody should have a right to be here. Right? Same Old fucking shit. I love when they go like, well the immigrants, you know, they do the jobs that Americans don't want to do. I love how that, they always put it back on like they always get it off. The rich guys like immigrants do the jobs. Americans don't want to do that. That's such a fucking brilliant way of saying that Americans don't want to be grossly underpaid for back, back breaking work that makes somebody else's Zillion fucking dollars.

Speaker 3:          00:09:44       Do you think those immigrants want to do those jobs? And I love when they sit there and go over this. They're happy. The fucking happy bent over at the waist all day picking jelly beans. You want to fucking do that out and candy land fields. I don't think anybody wants to, they're basically saying we can't get away with sweatshop labor in this country anymore because of unions. All right. And then they, but they spin it around. They got the Americans don't want to do this job. You're telling me you can find an American to go out and go pick some fucking apples if you paid them right?

Speaker 2:          00:10:18       Huh?

Speaker 3:          00:10:20       We'll fuck would want to go on and go pick some apples. You get that bag right? You're walking around out in the fucking air. Nobody breathing down your neck. You just up there picking apples like Johnny Appleseed. I'd love to be a fucking apple picker if you paid me, you know you want to give me 30 sets of fucking month ago. Pick apples. Yeah, go fuck yourself. You pick the fucking apples. You'll see that that Elena, they're there and have a work ethic you just crushed anyways.

Speaker 2:          00:10:49       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:10:50       Gotta go find some guy that used to sleep on a rock under a fucking waterfall to do that God damn job because she did. Some guy walked here, you know, from Zimbabwe, grab herself a piece of fucking oak or whatever. Some light p pine or some shit. Right. Doggy paddled his whole fucking way over here. Yeah. You think he's scared of picking some apples for no money doesn't give a fuck. He's happy to be back on the land.

Speaker 3:          00:11:15       You got to go to that fucking guy, that level of struggle in life to find somebody to go out to go, you know, roll the cantaloupes in after the fucking harvest. Right. Why? Because we don't want to do it because we won't fucking work for a dollar a month. You rich cunt. Oh, I'm on a fucking tear this morning. Unbelievable. Um, so anyways, so that putting the tile in the bathroom, we're getting down to it right now. We're getting down and I, and this is what I, this is what I've learned from this fucking job. This is what you do. If you ever get any work done in your house, have the whole fucking thing designed okay? Before you know you wet, you have them even fucking removed. The first piece of fucking whatever you have the whole thing designed. You have everything that you want put in there and you already have that fucking thing priced out.

Speaker 3:          00:12:14       Then you order all the shit before they even start. You order all the fucking shit that you want put back. He put in a new kitchen, you order all of the shit that you want put back in, and you'd stick it in your fucking garage, and then you fucking take out a stop watch and you go, all right, guys, go, and that's it. Then you stay on top of them. You never fucking stop me actually in the estimate to you include the shit that they're gonna put in afterwards because he's fucking assholes. If you go, yeah. What's the estimate to, yeah. You know, to get a new kitchen put in on the Gwalia 10 grand, you know, 10 grand is for them to disassemble the shit you have. You know, forget about all the bullshit they're gonna find in the walls. Will, you'll only a little

Speaker 4:          00:12:54       of bro Lou Lu, the slew of WHO's looked up to code this, These v three go to the vintage of the Zulu,

Speaker 3:          00:13:01       Google, all that fucking shits common. And then on top of all of that, they're going to add the price for all of them. Imply answers and all the counters, all the countertops and all that. And you'd be like, wait a minute, this wasn't in the estimate

Speaker 3:          00:13:16       and they're going to be like, uh, no. You know what you feel like when you're doing, it's like the blues brothers when they thought the beer was free. Yeah, like a, he didn't look good. Charges fill the first one. So why we thought they were like a break a half? Nah, Nah. That's what you're contracted does. All right. There's no difference between buying a car and having some fucking asshole work on your house. You have no idea what the price is. You know, like when you go down to buy a car, which you want to get from those cons, is the out the door price out the door? What is this costing me? They'll fucking act like you knock in the, ah, take a grand off and then charge you 1500 bucks for the fucking, uh, Russ. Perfect. You know, I don't know. This is just the ramblings of someone born without pigment.

Speaker 1:          00:18:55       last night I had Paul Versey on speakerphone and I had Jason lie ahead in my living room and we had a couple of pops. Paul was driving home or whatever, and uh, we had this epic fucking argument. Um, it all started off with that guy in the giants making that unbelievable catch, which immediately everybody started saying was the greatest catch of all time, greatest catch of all time. And of course Paul Versey, there's nothing Paul likes better than saying that something is the greatest of all time. And I'm just like Paul, that's without a doubt. It's got to be top two or three. And I'm saying that out of respect for the fact that I know I haven't seen every great fucking catch. Okay. In Nfl fucking history. I know I have it just out of respect, but I know God damn well. I'm trying to think of a better one that I ever saw. No, I don't think I can think of one. This bigger catches catches that happen, the Superbowl, but just as far as degree of difficulty, without a doubt, that's, I mean, I, I

Speaker 3:          00:20:00       wouldn't think that you could maybe find one or two better than that. All right. But I do remember back in the day when I used to watch a Boston college and this kid with a mesh half shirt was fucking running full speed, jumped up in the air and with one hand just fucking reached back in behind his head and fucking just snag this ball out like a fucking eagle. BC, Eagle. Yeah. There you go. Just snatched it out. Right. And when I, you know, was trying to find that catch on the Internet, I couldn't find it. So this is what verse he says he goes to. He's like, Chris Carter just said it's the greatest catch of all time. It's like Paul, that's his fucking job.

Speaker 5:          00:20:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20:38       Oh Hey. It's his fucking job. Espns job is to tell you every fucking night that what you saw or what you're about to see is the greatest fucking thing you're ever going to see. Cause that's how they get their whore money. That's how they can afford to go out there and get the corvette. Z O six with the fucking, uh, look at me over here. Fucking racing package.

Speaker 2:          00:21:00       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:21:01       Message. I know Chris Card is a fucking hall of fame wide receiver, but I mean come on the second you get on TV, you got to start flapping your arms. Okay. If they don't hear you, your, you're fucking sport coat bumping up against you, Mike. They're not going to give you your paycheck. All right. Look what happened to herm Edwards. Herm Edwards was a respectable human being when he played football and he coached football. Then he got on TV. I don't know what happened to the guy. That guy should have a red fucking nose on one of those horns out. Oh God. Every time he fucking said something, I don't even know if he's still on the show.

Speaker 2:          00:21:36       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:21:36       I don't know if it was TV or he just snapped her in that one loss where he, you know, you play to win the games. If he just fucking, something in his head just snapped because he goes on ESPN and he talks real low like this when he's setting up his point. And then when he goes to make his point that he started fucking screaming, right?

Speaker 2:          00:21:56       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:21:56       Starts doing the curly shuffle, right. Wise Guy. Um, so anyways,

Speaker 2:          00:22:03       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:22:04       Anyways, so first he goes, dude, I just googled greatest catches ever.

Speaker 2:          00:22:09       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:22:09       it goes, it's a joke to say that Lynn Swann catching the Superbowl. It's almost insulting. I love that. He just, he calls on the Internet. He doesn't even Google greatest one handed catch him. He just, Google's greatest catch ever. And then he sits down and watches some dentists youtube video. This guy, right? This fucking guy. He just puts this together and then that's it. That's, there you go. That's how I know some guy who works on ESPN shed. It's the greatest one ever. And then I watched some fucking random guy's youtube video and there you go. That's it. It's done. Come on guys. This is what I would love it to be the greatest fucking catch of all time. All right. But I got to tell you, he only did it last night and according to my research, okay, in a 12 hour period, you cannot watch every great fucking catch of all fucking time, professional and college level in all of that shit.

Speaker 3:          00:23:06       But I will tell you that that was definitely, I mean there, there's no way that you could find two catches better than that. I will say that, but I'm going to stop short of Paul Versey slash Tony Kornheiser, which I'll never forget in September of 2007 watching the New England patriots is just the greatest team ever. And then they end up losing the super bowl. It's like, you know, you know what's his real travesty is that Tony Kornheiser doesn't wear a fucking toupee that's barely on his head. You know what I mean? Then you could actually see how over the top half the shit the guys like that say, cause every time they snap their head would go flying on the and it would remind you to take it with a grain of salt. That for as much as Tony Kornheiser knows what he's saying. He's standing in the middle of a three ring circus going ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,

Speaker 3:          00:23:58       children of all ages. This is look great. Isn't bad mitten championship deals. Wheel does have a fucking child. Um, so we went from that to then on, I fucking phone is blowing up here. Oh, conference call, conference call. I don't do conference calls when they have a conference call. No, and neither do you, none of us want to be on this fucking phone call right now. Can somebody just say the thing that needs to be said so we can all hang up? Can I tell you something? One of the greatest things about doing what I do for a living is, uh, I don't have to have, you know, there's no, um, like meetings. I don't want to tread on some shit that I did. Oh, by the way, I forgot to mention last week my, uh, comedians in cars getting coffee aired last week. And, um, you know, I was actually talking to Mr Seinfeld, by the way.

Speaker 3:          00:24:55       That was one of the most surreal fucking things I've ever done to be sitting there with him. The king, um, nobody did this business better. Why? I can't say flip Wilson did it. Johnny Carson did it. Will you just go out? You hit him, you hit him hard, you get your money, and then you walk away. All right? And as they're talking on your shirt going, hey, hey, you want to try to make a comeback? Do you want to try to do something else so we can just cancel it? You don't want to put a little fucking black stain up against your name. And they just go, no, you know what? I'm good. You, you, you enjoy yourself, Hollywood. I'll see you later. Flip Wilson did that flip. Wilson had his fucking show. He was smart with his money. He invested his shit and when the show was done, he's like, I'm out.

Speaker 3:          00:25:42       See you later. Go Fuck Yourself. If you need me, I'll be at home rubbing my balls, watching the game for the rest of my fucking life. Right? Johnny Carson, he did. He ended up owning the show. He had his own fucking clothing line. You know, long before all those rappers did, okay? They're all ripping off Johnny Carson, Johnny Carson collection, some of the greatest plaid three piece suits you ever saw in your fucking life on it. You can laugh at them, you can laugh at it, but you laugh at them, all right? You're saying you don't like anchorman if you don't like anchorman, you know what an American and according to some of the people I've seen screaming on TV, that means you need to get the fuck out of this country.

Speaker 3:          00:26:24       How dumb is that? Countries? You know, why can't we all just be happy? We're not in the water, right? Can everybody just fucking relax? Okay, I get shoes. She gets sandals. How are you? How's it going? Great. You know, I don't know what that thing is on your head, but you know, you seem to enjoy it. You want to come home and have some dinner? Why? Why can't? Why can't you just fucking do that? Why does it always have to be screaming and fucking yelling? Goddamn Isis Horse Shit. I swear to fucking Christ. I would love to see them try to fucking defeat Florida. You know, sitting there acting like they were a god damn problem. Holy Shit is fucking 30,000 people on the other side of the planet that don't like us. Well thank God we're on this side of the planet. I know we just stay over here and figure out how to make our cars run on Legos and then what are they gonna be mad at that they got nobody to shoot it? Fuck them. Okay. You know what it is about America. We'd like back in the day,

Speaker 3:          00:27:24       like one of those big fucking ANR guys that could actually take a band out of a, pluck them out of obscurity and give them a hit record. That's what America does with our foreign policy. No one would ever have heard of isis if it wasn't for us. If our a and R guys didn't go over there and pluck them out of fucking obscurity, they'd just be over there, you know? No one would even know they'd be like a garage band, you know, blowing up shit over there. Didn't know what would even fucking about. All right, why don't we walk away, tear up their contract and just fucking come on. Why don't we just come home? Can we just do, hey everybody corner. Let's just come up enough already. You're not going to solve anything over there. All right. But we want the stuff in the grout. I mean, sorry, we're trying. Trying to give them freedom.

Speaker 3:          00:28:13       That's right. Come on, grow up. Okay. But just come on. Okay, we have beaches over here. What are you doing up? We've got an oil here. Um, anyways, that was my version of what we should do with their foreign policy. Having not read a God damn thing about it. As far as I know, isis was some sexy, broadened the seventies you know, who was a rival to a wonder woman. You know, cause everybody knows good looking bitches don't get along. And the only way, the only way to good looking women get along is it's so they can hate on other good looking women and just sit there, you know, at the faces all fucking scrunched up. Hey, why does your face age? But the rest of your body doesn't or why does your face age faster? You know that like you have a sheet, like an old strip or the fucking bodies are gorgeous and then their face, she's like, wow man, look at that body.

Speaker 3:          00:29:05       That body looks 26 and you look at their face, ah, she's 42, Amit for instance. You know what I mean? Like if you guys saw me completely fucking naked, if be like, wow, man, I bet that guy's like 31 and then you see my face. She's like, Holy Shit, let's pick out a plot. I'm sorry. You know what? I'm not sorry. You deserve that. You deserve to picture me naked. Um, so anyway, so we ended up having this fucking ridiculous fucking argument where, uh, Paul Versey of course was saying Babe Ruth was the greatest baseball player of all time.

Speaker 3:          00:29:45       And then he said all the usual shit. He basically repeated shit that he heard on TV that he played at the dead ball era. Right. And a law head was also trying to tell me, you know, yeah. He, and I was just saying, listen, I'm not saying he's not one of the great players of all time, but he's not the greatest of all fucking time for the simple fact, he didn't play against the greatest. All right. He played in a segregated league with the Pedro Martinez. The Mariano Rivera is okay. The Josh Gibson, they weren't allowed in the fucking league. He didn't have to compete against Reggie Jackson. He didn't have to compete against these guys. They weren't allowed in the league. He was playing and basically a softball league. Okay. With the top third would, I would say, would make, you know, would make the major league baseball nowadays. Okay. But I get it. You gotta think like two thirds of it wouldn't even fucking Ben there. Then they tried to do that shit. Well, Bill, who was only 10 teams, there's dirty teeth now. Yeah. There was all solely fucking 2 billion people on the planet. Now there's 7 billion.

Speaker 2:          00:30:45       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:30:45       All right, so I'll, I'll, I'll knock off like I'll get my next to 10% on his fucking numbers then.

Speaker 2:          00:30:51       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:30:51       Like give me a fucking break all you gotta do.

Speaker 2:          00:30:55       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:30:56       Do he play baseball when people die to tuberculosis? He played baseball like there was a hit song, but at the [inaudible] and that song was written in the 1890s and everybody thought it was too fucking crazy. What is this devil music? God dammit. She, what happens when you let them off the plantation? They get a piano. They couldn't even handle it. Bought up [inaudible] he played baseball. That was a hit. Baba Du, Du, du Du du De de de de Beauvoir devil by de Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop. You know, people would just hear it and then sit around wondering when they were ever going to hear it again because they had no device to play it on. Yeah. That idea, that double Babu, right? That guy came to town and everybody stood around him and I played, played a fucking piano. You see how they worked out back then? Head, shoulders, knees and toes, knees and toes. Head, shoulders, knees and toes. Knees and toes. And only white guys. No plaques. I Puerto Ricans, head, shoulders, knees and toes. These are jobs.

Speaker 2:          00:32:09       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:32:09       The big dumb fucking gloves that looked like little people hands. Give me a fucking break.

Speaker 2:          00:32:18       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:32:18       Not to mention Babe Ruth. I mean they built a stadium towards his strength. That right field fence. Okay. You could, you could make a cop show.

Speaker 2:          00:32:29       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:32:29       with two toddlers and they could do the classic scene with a fucking cop chases the perp down the alley and he gets to the chain link fence and fucking jumps over it. You could, you could film that with two toddlers, with the right field fence in Yankee stadium. The House that Ruth built. All right? He backed up to catch a fly ball. It hits you like mid thigh and you fell into some guy's lap, right? So anyway, give me a fucking break. All right. From 1930 on, I'll give it to you. All right? But if you played in the teams, he played in the arts, he played in the 18 hundreds and even into the twenties go fuck yourself. All right. And I feel like every look, every like, um, major sport has their three stooges era where one team won a bunch of fucking championships. All right. I love the Boston Celtics, but gimme a break. You look at them in the 1960s. I mean, it looks like it looks like a game being played at the y, you know, some Christian rec league.

Speaker 3:          00:33:30       All right? The fucking Canadians won a bunch of Stanley cups when, you know, you had first dibs on any guy within a 300 mile fucking radius and it's 16 fucking league. They had first dibs on anybody in French speaking Quebec. And we had, you know, we had first pick had like the best guy from Vermont. Gee, did you go on a run? It's fucking ridiculous. Okay. And then the Green Bay packers who were actually the fucking Yankees of football, you know, they, you know, they were, when entitles when the Canton bulldogs, we're still in the fucking leg. All right. Hey Man, give me, come on. Right?

Speaker 3:          00:34:08       Football was like a genie. I think they played with a pumpkin back then. I mean, give me a fucking break. All those little star, the house during the blah, blah, the only ones that I will then I will, I will recognize the championships without a grain of salt. I would say, uh, any of the New York Yankees from like the 1930 [inaudible] for the simple fact they went babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Joe Dimaggio and Mickey Mantle. That's just, nobody's, nobody's ever going to do that again. You're not going to get the Jordan of your error four times in a fucking roll. All right? You're just not going to do it. So without a doubt, I respect all of that type of shit. But you know, at the inception of these fucking leaks when crazy legs, Johnson runs around googly eyes fucking Ulysses and could give me a fucking break. Okay. He played in the deadbolt every, you don't understand this guy had more devils who was on the mound? My great grandfather got out of the bowl fan. Oh, freckles. The Bay was that the song they played when he came in said or enter Sandman. They weren't facing cut fast balls back then. I'm sure there was guys throwing 90 a hundred miles a fucking hour, but just the, the amount of bumps that were in that fucking league back then. I don't even, I didn't want to hear it.

Speaker 5:          00:35:28       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:35:29       There's a guy in the hall of fame. Oh, for good luck in baseball. He kept us section of rope that was used in an actual, okay, this is how long ago these fucking people played and you're going to sit there and act like in the inception of these fucking leagues. You know, I'm looking at, obviously in every era there, there was a Jordan. All right. But just like the techniques and everything, some of the records that were set back then, they didn't have a fucking heavyweight fight. It would go on for like a day. They'd have like a fucking, you know, a 90 round fight. Okay. Now listen, you're getting punched in the fucking head, but what kind of technique are you using? Phil? Did bare knuckle fucking the people bubble God go, fuck. I want to hear it. I don't want to hear it. All right. The competition now is so much more insane that I, I just think it would immediately any, but I guess they would compete at the same level. But like just the fact that it's now everybody gets to compete and not to mention like, I mean you could get fucking fathers out there. I try and they try and teach their kid how to throw a curve ball

Speaker 3:          00:36:40       to get, you know, get the family out of the trailer park when the kids like six years old stunting the growth of, of one of his fucking arms, you know, cause they live in a fucking trailer and somebody got a growth on their face that they want to have a year they want to removed than others. Kids go on out there. You know, back in the day you went out and you played catch with you little kid. Now you go out there and you from day one you try to teach them how to switch it. It's insane. All right, so whatever. I'm just saying, so whatever you guys think, Babe Ruth is the greatest baseball player. It's so hard to say because all you can go by is this guy's fucking stats.

Speaker 2:          00:37:18       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:37:19       Who you played back, you know,

Speaker 3:          00:37:23       there was probably a guy better than fucking babe Ruth, but he got polio. You know what I mean? I have, it's just all right. I'm done. I'm done. Fucking murderer in here. All right, let's move on here. Uh Oh, he's just see the bills and jets game was snowed out. I love when they had those big snow storms, right? And then everybody goes global warming. Um, and I got a buddy of mine for a shot who was actually on a Conan O'brien last week. He didn't let me know. You know, cause like most funny people, he's fucking humble. Okay. And didn't even fucking tell me, but, uh, he actually told me that that is a symptom of global warming. And I'm going to pause here for everybody. You know, who doesn't think that 7 billion people pouring nuclear waste into rivers has any sort of an effect on the planet, you know, but a bunch of deer do.

Speaker 3:          00:38:16       We're gonna eat all fucking Troy's. We've got to get them all here, ma'am. Well, what about us? What he might, we're fine dares having effect deers having an effect on, on the environment. You know them things that don't drive cars or pollute lakes year, but 7 billion people who actually us here who actually put a hole in the fucking ozone layer spraying and Pam into skillets, so are all much. Don't stick to them. We do not have any sort of effect on the planet whatsoever. Um, this, I mean, I don't know shit about this, but people are actually saying that that is, uh, these giant snow storms or actually a direct effect of the warming of the globe. Now, whether we do it or not, here we go. This is what this person says. This storms that buried Buffalo New York area and more than seven feet, 2.1 meters.

Speaker 3:          00:39:13       If you're from another country [inaudible] of snow this week, shafted records and shock the residents even or even in a region accustom, uh, to dealing with heavy snow. The storms are certain, provide new fodder for climate change. Skeptics who seem to embrace every monster blizzard as evidence that global warming doesn't exist. And yet the science behind these catastrophic storm suggest that they do not occurred despite global warming, but in fact because of it. And He sends a link to the u s India Summit, uh, bring historic climate action question mark. Now I know this person wants it to be true, so I understand that. I'm only reading one side of the argument, but this is, this is actually interesting to me. A part of what gave us the record lake effect. Snow fall in buffalo was warm late fall lake surface temperature. That combined with something highly unusual, a five sigma event, Oh shit.

Speaker 3:          00:40:08       The Lek clears it up. The hell does that mean, uh, that is a very likely events on the, on the order of one in a million or more remarkable persistent, what's with all the big words, dude, anomalous configuration of the jet stream, which brought frigid, frigid Arctic air down into the United States. So early in the season, the cold winds traveling over the warm moisture laden lake created a perfect storm of conditions for record. Uh, for record lake effect snow. I think basically what they say is warm air can hold more moisture because the air molecules are more spread out in their logic. Right. And then that for what? I don't know, they don't explain why the fucking jet stream got pushed down, bringing the so whatever. So frigid air hit this unbelievably warm air. All right. And then what does that do ladies and gentlemen, we all know that cold air is high pressure air and high pressure wants to go to low pressure and then what does it do?

Speaker 3:          00:41:17       It fucking goes slams into it and sends all that warm, moist air right up into the fucking sky. Right? Then it hits the dewpoint. What's the dewpoint boys and girls to do? Point is the point at which one water, when moisture in the air becomes visible, also known as the cloud and it looks all mcbrown with more known as fob. Yeah. So then what happens is as that air moves up, it starts to cool. So the air molecules start to shrink and then you reach the saturation point and then the fucking water drops. And then what? That Arctic air underneath it. It fucking snows like a motherfucker. All right. Now what happens there? I don't understand how the, how the fucking do whatever. Yeah, just it's, it's interesting. Whatever. If I'll have the link up there, if you guys can translate it for me, I'd appreciate it. There you go. That was bill Nye the science, not the science guy. I got some of it right. You gotta be impressed with the high pressure, low pressure shit, weren't ya? We'll go fuck yourself. What are you impressed by her, your own bulls. Um, someone who's, what else do I have to do here? Let me what, I mean, what else do I have to do for you? People, you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to read the last two were advertising this week. You know,

Speaker 3:          00:42:33       and if you actually paid to advertise on here and you don't like my reads, my reads are fucking great because I eve, as much as I'm shitting on whatever I'm saying, it keeps people listening. All right? And they buy stuff. By the way, guess what I'm wearing a pair of, I'm wearing a pair of me undies. Me undies, no more sweaty balls, booboo. Boo. I'm wearing them. They send them to me.

Speaker 5:          00:42:53       MMM.

Speaker 3:          00:42:55       They seem to be working fine, but I don't have sweaty ball itis, so I don't know what to tell you, but they didn't advertise this week. So I'll tell you about my experience later on another episode. All right. Dollar Shave Club. Everyone. Big Shave companies must think we're a bunch of scumbag criminals. Why else did they lock the raises up in that maximum security plastic razor fortress in the [inaudible]? Uh, you have to stand around like a convict waiting for the guy to come and unlock the raise a case. Uh, do they think you're some kind of a jewel thief? Well, what if some homeless guy comes in and shaves his balls? Any Nix it and then you get, you get homeless ball aids. Maybe they're trying to fucking prevent that. I don't know. Why am I sticking up for cvs? Anyways, next thing. There'll be a security guard who tazes you.

Speaker 3:          00:44:54       Um, evidently I love the flexibility that owning your own business provides. Why do they do that?

Speaker 5:          00:45:01       Okay,

Speaker 3:          00:45:02       why? Why? I I, I don't have my own business, but evidently I love the flexibility of it. What else do I love? I don't know. Let me read more of this copy.

Speaker 5:          00:47:16       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:47:17       Alright, back to this shit. And I watched a really cool documentary called Nixon on Nixon, which is basically the tapes from the White House that he set up the Nixon tapes

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       and then also interviews that he had. And um,

Speaker 1:          00:47:36       this guy puts Archie bunker to shame, you know, but granted it's also like, I mean, the guy taped himself for like six years, however long he was in office. He had one term and then he wanted the next one, I think within a year or so he was out, what, six 68 to 74, basically five, six years. So of course all they pick out is when he's saying antisemetic shared. And when he's saying, you know, stuff about minorities, his stuff about women, I mean, Jesus Christ, this guy, like he sounds like Archie bunker, but uh, it's just a really fascinating thing. I highly recommend it. And um,

Speaker 1:          00:48:15       just how like they say the press is the enemy. The press is the enemy and how you think it's like this evil thing like this sitting there going like, yes, we must lie to the American people. They're view is literally the press is the enemy because they're distorting what it is we're trying to say, which is the classic thing where everybody thinks that they're doing right and it's the right thing. I'm a moron and I enjoyed it and I think you will too. Sure. We all do. Let's get to some questions here this week. Um, oh, by the way, I was in New York City, uh, barely had time to do anything. Uh, I went and I recorded, we, uh, we got a big time actor to do one of the roles on my show. F is for family and had a great time doing that. And A, I can't fucking wait for this show to come out.

Speaker 1:          00:49:02       We're doing the last records today and uh, I'm not allowed to say, I guess some of the people that we got on this thing and we signed another person to do it and yeah, we're going to have to record today. Yeah. Um, so anyways, the stock market, uh, Billy market belt, are you involved, are you involved the, Oh, are you involved in the buying and trading of stocks or mutual funds? Do you have a business manager diversifying your shit? Come to San Diego and go fuck yourself. That is an unbelievably personal fucking question, but I'll answer it. This is what I think about the stock market. I think it's a, uh, I, I just, I think it's,

Speaker 1:          00:49:52       um, uh, it's like Vegas, it's just a crap table. And I think insider trading happens all the time and I think there's people who go in and they drive the market up and then they pulled their money out and it falls down and then they fight. They buy it low and they do it all the fucking time. And the same people that do that put the money behind these campaigns for the people who become president and only make $500,000 a fucking year. And that's why people look the other way. And then once I, if he fucking 20 years they throw a celebrity chef in jail to make it seem like they're doing something. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       am I in the stock market? Uh, sort of, but not really. I'm super conservative and uh, I just look at my retirement account that I just want it to still be there. I'm not worried about it gaining interest. I'm just more worried about the, some of the money. MMM. But I don't look at my retirement fund like it's even going to be there. The way these bags of fucking running wild is hulk Hogan says, and nobody is trying to stop these guys. And I've lately been fucking bitching about why we're still having to fucking wards over in the Middle East. MMM. And fighting fucking terrorist groups of 30 fucking people who don't even have a fucking airplane. You know what I mean? Like they're going to come over here and do something to us and like what? Destroy this fucking company and it causes a quadrant cost. They could come over here and they could fucking blow something up. Yeah. All right. We're going to survive that. We need to spend billions of fucking dollars over there going after 30,000 fucking jerk offs, you know? Meanwhile you got insurance companies and bankers raping everybody over here. And then you got other people poisoning the food supply.

Speaker 3:          00:51:39       You know, what are they got there that dead, the this so fucking powerful. Like you're not even allowed to say what's in the food. You got this dumb shit. You watching the world series and they have stand up for cancer and nobody's talking about the fucking food supply. And then if you criticize the, I'm standing up for cancer, like you don't give a shit about and they just start, they always just start yelling at people and they never yell at the fucking five fucking guys that they could actually change the shit. It's, it drives me up the fucking wall. It's like that. Then hold their whole fucking no more campaign is classic NFL classic. And it felt like there reprimanding you. Like you were the one who didn't show that whole fucking tape the Internet, the very least they're trying to say we're all guilty. It's like, no, you're guilty. Get cunt. So whatever. So that's what I see. I say bring the boys and girls home and uh, you know, we started a, we invade the fucking people that are putting all this crazy shit in the food supply. I'd start with that and I'd knock on some bankers house, you know,

Speaker 3:          00:52:49       you like, what the fuck are you doing? You know, that would make everybody's life way better, I would think rather than going after fucking 5,000 people working out on a jungle gym bill, you kind of over simplifying things. Well that's what I do do. You don't like it. Listen to another fucking podcast. You want to listen to some of you read Ga, go listen to Joe Rogan. There's an informed human being. All right, you listen to the Joe Rogan experience to learn things. You listen to my podcast to feel better about yourself, to feel smarter, you know? Does that make you feel good

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       on that? You smarter than me? Well fuck you. All right. Okay, here we go. Farmer bill. Hey Bill. Let's say the apocalypse goes down. Uh, I take a steak knife and stick it in my neck and I would hum a jingle bells. And that's how I would end it. He goes, oh, anyways, he goes, shoot, you get to that farm and you realize you only have three crops.

Speaker 1:          00:53:50       Oh, you, you get to that farm. What farm did I say? I was going to have a farm. No, Jesus, I didn't know what you are. You already lost me two sentences in. But I'll keep reading. What do you grow? You might be living off these three fruits or vegetables for awhile. So you gotta be smart. Also, you need to think about how you might combine them to change it up a bit. Thanks. And Go fuck yourself up. First of all, I don't have to do any of that. I didn't have to answer this fucking question and I resent the fact that you're telling me that I have to do this when you can't even fucking, you're writing sentences as bad as I speak. Um, but I'll answer it. I'll answer it. Um, so I, when I get to vet farm and I, and if I could have three crops, what would I grow? Let's see here.

Speaker 2:          00:54:41       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:54:41       I'd have to vegetables and fruit,

Speaker 2:          00:54:45       right? That workout.

Speaker 1:          00:54:51       I guess I'd have some sort of lettuce. Well, first of all, the fruit. I like bananas. It's very hard to get sick of bananas. I could eat a banana every day. Boom, banana, potassium, no matter what. I'm going to end up getting some sort of scurvy. Right?

Speaker 2:          00:55:09       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:55:11       I make maybe I need an orange.

Speaker 2:          00:55:14       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:55:14       Trying to think of all this shit and what would happen when you get scurvy? You know what, I, I can't answer it. I, I'd have to read up on nutrition. I didn't know that there was going to be a test this week. Everybody, if I was just going by taste, I would have a banana, uh, some sort of lettuce. And then what? What's another vegetable that I like?

Speaker 2:          00:55:35       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:55:36       I dunno. Apples. Yeah. My, so my vegetables would be a lettuce and apples and then the fruit would be a banana. Today you go. Now I want to ask everybody who just listened there, like how excited did you get that you thought that I actually thought that an apple was a vegetable, you know, and it made you feel better about you and your fucking stupid life. That full for one second you were writing to somebody else was wrong. What does that say about you as a person? If you didn't actually just hear me say that and then actually feel sad like, oh no, oh no, he's going to make a fool of himself. If it actually made you fucking happy, you know? Do you think that I'm going to wish you a happy?

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       I hope you fall face first into the gravy. When you think about dad, right in front of your mom and when you pick up your fucking half burned up face and you're pulling that lot off your face, I would just love for you to see the disappointment in her eyes. That's what I want for you on this wonderful week for giving thanks. Um, Jesus Christ. How fucking heavy handed and they going to be. You know the NFL right? This week when they do their fucking Thanksgiving games, you know they, they're going to have like a camouflage fucking Turkey for the troops and then you know there's going to be something about some disease. This is what they're gonna do. They're gonna, they're gonna say no more hitting women with the camouflage Turkey leg with a cancered riddle, camouflage Turkey while supporting the troops. That's what they're going to say. I think they're going to combine all of that. And at some point, I imagine everybody's gonna stand up for some, for something. They're going to stand up for a disease. I stand up for cancer. Sounds like you support cancer, doesn't it? Stand up for cancer. Stand up for it.

Speaker 3:          00:57:37       How about it shouldn't be stand up against cancer. Am I slowly losing my mind and like, I don't understand the English language all of a sudden. Am I getting some sort of a, I dunno. I know. What the fuck. I can't even, I didn't know what the fuck to tell you. I just, I just wish they would just play the games. Just show the gay. I don't need you to try to make me be a better person. All right. I'm a piece of shit and I'm trying. Okay. And I need to be fucking like, I don't need you be my fucking parents. Right. Fireplace. Uh, Billy clause. Uh, I'm thinking of a, Oh, what about Avocados? Gotta love and Avocado. Hey, I'm back. I'm back on my diet here. This is how I lose weight. I juice morning in lunch and then I tried to eat. Fucking is Veggie as I came for the rest of the fucking day. And then you skip the rope. He skipped her. Open up, melts off you. That's it. Then you're done. Then you're in Billy Bob Thornton shape. Alright. Fireplace. Billy clause. I'm thinking fixing. I'm thinking fixing up my basement. You thinking of fixing up your basement. The previous owner had a fireplace plastered over. It's either a traditional fireplace or a wood stove.

Speaker 3:          00:58:55       Do you have any feeling of how I'm supposed to assume and understand that literally the way you wrote that and mean it sounded like behind the wall was either a traditional fireplace or a wood stove. Mike, what the, who the fuck would have a woodstove in a wall? Um, do you have any feet? Well, maybe there is, is there, when I think of a woodstove it's sitting in the middle of a room. Have, fuck now I gotta go. I gotta Google image it. I got a Google image when I'm going down the road. You guys just enjoy this music while I look this up. You fucking something. Wonder why babe, when I'm going down the road, I used to do something soft wood stove. I can't sit and type at the same time image but B. Yeah. What stove? Yeah. It sits out in the fucking, there it is. I'll do a Paul Versey does dude. I Google what the stoves and none of them were in a wall. Yeah. None of them are in a wall. Okay. Hey, some day I gave her ma, but she wanted my soul. Don't think twice. It's all right. All right. Fireplace. Say Billy clause. I'm thinking of fixing up my basement, the previous owner ahead of fire. What fireplace plastered over it. So it's either the traditional fireplace or a wood stove. That's how I should have written. Do you have any feelings either way, pros or cons on the, on the matter? Um,

Speaker 2:          01:00:36       okay.

Speaker 3:          01:00:36       Oh, I'd go into the wall, dude. If you got a fireplace matter, they don't allow him anymore.

Speaker 2:          01:00:42       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:00:43       You know, I don't know where the fuck you live, where you could actually have a wood stove. I didn't think that they allowed that anymore.

Speaker 2:          01:00:51       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:00:51       Or You could just have some shit coming out of the chimney. Um, but you know, if you actually already have a fireplace, if that system is already there.

Speaker 2:          01:01:02       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:01:02       Yeah. But then the fucking Jimmy's going to be fucked up.

Speaker 2:          01:01:11       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:01:12       I would die. I would take it, I would have the exposed brick. This is the original brick from the early 1920s back when Babe Ruth was playing in a softball league. Dude, they were doing the Charleston when the guy was hitting home runs. I mean, Jesus, give me a fucking break bat, Bat, Bat, bat, yet up it up. Boom, boom.
