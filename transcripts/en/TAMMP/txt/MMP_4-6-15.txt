Um, speaking of all Canada, how about those Boston Bruins? Turn it on when they needed to turn it on. All you fucking fans up there and Otto was skating down the river on your way to work. What'd you think was gonna Happen? Did you think that you are going to catch the big bad Bruins? Huh? One in the original six. How dare you Ottawa? You stand down, you stand down and you watch that river melt. You watched the water run like the tears going down your fucking frostbitten cheeks cause you ain't making the playoffs. Playoffs, the fucking playoffs. The Bruins are, and I'm calling it right now. We're going to play the Montreal Canadians in the first round and we're game one. We're getting our first win against those fucking silly shock French Fox.

Speaker 1:          00:02:00       Oh French people love their silly socks and their little pocket squares going into the game with their blue blazer thinking that they know more than the fucking coach. Those cuts. Right. What beaten him in game on? That's what we're doing. What's going to happen in game two? I don't know. I didn't take that far, but if you would like a prediction, I just heard the door slam. I think my wife just woke up. She's pissed at me already. Um, if you would like a prediction, uh, I say that we come out there and we, we win again. Yup. Then we'd go down to Boston, right? Oh, shared. Well, don't you take eight to nine? Is Your fucking a killer? We're going to sweep them up. We're not going to sweep her money. No. If we're going to fucking get out of the first round, but I can tell you right now, if we, if we actually, if I'm fucking, I'll tell you right now, if I'm a Montreal Canadian fair and I got to be thinking, if I'm playing the fucking Bruins, if we loo, if you guys fucking lose to us after the season we had after the domination that you guys fucking it.

Speaker 1:          00:03:00       You got to, you can't tell you this. Not Creeping in the back of your little French fucking brain. There is, you know, your little want to be French braid. You're not French. You're Canadian. That's right. You're part of North America. You're part of, you're, you're attached to us. This obesity, it goes right up over. The fucking board is right up to your, Timmy. Ho's with you guys sitting there eating your fucking donuts. What do you think? You're better than us because you get you Canadian GG fucking donuts with you. A little pinky sticking out. Ah, with your loafers. No socks. You little fucking pocket squares, Huh? Is that what you think? I'll tell you right now the playoffs to, I'm going to go total cliche here.

Speaker 3:          00:03:39       Prostart who to Hulu? Susan. Oof.

Speaker 4:          00:03:46       [inaudible] though. They're play their play desperate. We'll tell you a little desperate tables. Dangerous.

Speaker 1:          00:03:52       Did you guys watch any sports this weekend? Can somebody explained to me how it was constant beat Kentucky. Somebody explained to me how a team playing the game of basketball, a team that is wider than my thighs somehow beat the Kentucky wildcats. C. Dot. That's why you can never be prejudice. You can't be racist because it is always going to prove you wrong. I don't know shit about hoop. I don't know shit about college basketball. I don't know shit about a lot of things and I sat down to watch that game and I'm looking at that number 44 in Wisconsin. I'm like, this guy is a mess. Look at him. He looks like he's in a jam band. This guy does not look like a fucking basketball player and all of a sudden he's doing all this Kevin. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:04:34       Cale stretching around. I don't know. It was, it was a hell of a game. And, um, I actually, uh, I become a Wisconsin fan just because of, uh, uh, I told you guys this, a couple of guy developed the show with, and I want to talk to Nick Craig. It was a big Wisconsin guy. And uh, so I like those guys. So I root for the team, but however, I'm also a big Kentucky Fan. So it was this weird thing I didn't know. I love John Calipari and, uh, a John can of Perry over the cold. Let's go to [inaudible] cal pair. We will be all flooding. We're gleaning a little clear, I'm sure. So, yeah. Um, yeah, you know, I fucking love Italians and I love Italian food. So he has this guy. And then I also like how Calla Perry's a little shady, you know what I mean? How did he turn that program around a Memphis? Somebody explained to me how I never even knew that Memphis even had a school. Forget about a fucking basketball team and next thing you know, he brings him to the final four. Maybe didn't, I don't know. I'm just repeating shit. I heard other people say, I'm just repeating shit. I heard Bobby Knight Pitch About, Huh? That fucking drunk with power maniac. Good Lord. You ever see anybody needs a bit more of a swift kick in the ass and that guy, Jesus Christ, right? His fucking Khakis.

Speaker 4:          00:05:52       Uh, my hope when they bury with me, they bury it may face down Joe Critiques, Kid Kiss

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       my ass. Hey Bob, whatever you want us to dope. That's when he fucking went off the rails. There was some rails and he went off on people. I'm speaking of going off the rails. Uh, I would like to, I'd like to commend of for a certain channel out there right now that's a, is not responding to a bunch of horse shit that's coming their way. That's the exact way you handle this. This new era of, of offended over nothing.

Speaker 1:          00:06:34       This guy tweeted something in 1840. I don't know about this and you've got to go back six fucking years to find something bad that somebody tweeted about Jesus fucking Christ. What do you break out? A boat, an old borscht belt joke. I'm sure I'll find fell. You know what I mean? Fucking people. Jesus Christ and other comedians getting involved. Well what the fuck? What is going on? Everybody acting like a bunch of goddamn babies. Fucking grow up. There you go. Pill birth. Speaking out. Vaguely. Vaguely at best. Um, so I didn't do shit last night. Oh I know, I know. I did last night. I got absolutely fucking Hamad. Um, got hammered when I get drunk. I called the people I love and I leave long rambling messages about how great I think they are that I'm that guy. So you get mad at me cause I call you at three in the morning, then you wake up in his lab. I was nice. That was nice. He was speaking of me. Um, I actually, I have one thing in my office that is hanging on the wall and uh, it's a, it, it's a pit bull calendar.

Speaker 1:          00:07:41       I don't know why. I forget where I got it. I think, isn't it called for the love of Pit Bulls? Isn't that what it's called? I think that's what my calendar is called is great. You just look at this adorable pit bull for a whole month. Right? And then all of a sudden the month change, it's like, I just changed it this morning for, for March to April. And I literally turn the thing and I just went, no, I'll look at me. No bold. And I just laughed at myself. How pathetic I am. You know, even my dog right now, my dog's laying on the, on the floor, it's beds, got his back to me. It's embarrassed, embarrassed by its fucking master. Um, master fucking magic. Give me a fucking break and not as things master. It's run the Goddamn House. Um, Shit's wherever it wants to. And then I pick it up. I'm the master. I don't think so. Does the master walk around? Huh? Then again, the dog is on a leash. I Dunno. It sounds like a bad 80 standup Dick. Why? That's a good fucking character. How filthy Seinfeld. Um, a bad impression of Seinfeld wellbeing. Completely filthy. I'll work on that. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:08:57       well when you put your Dick in her eyes, don't she always cry?

Speaker 5:          00:09:01       Ooh, Ooh,

Speaker 4:          00:09:05       sorry. I'll go fuck yourself. You fill an hour every week. Um, anyway, so the Bruins and making the playoffs, I don't even know if they in yet. I think that rent, I have no idea. Um, we got to play the capital's tonight. Nobody gives a shit, so whatever. So, so Wisconsin,

Speaker 4:          00:09:25       the fucking white. His team since the Washington generals is playing Duke. All right. The Duke, the Duke, I'm sorry they're playing Duke tonight and I don't know shit about either team. All I know is that coach k always seems to fucking win these games. So what do you think's going to happen? Huh? Do you think these cheesy eaten yogurt making ice cream sandwich, scarfing down fat fuck of a state is going to go down. Where are they playing? Are they playing the Lucas oil? If you know, they actually annoyed me that they will, that they sold it out there at Lucas oil field and I was thinking about a gym or say making all that fucking money, you know, and it's just like, what, what is he going to do now to try to attack the Patriots because that fucking jackass can't beat us.

Speaker 6:          00:10:18       Hm.

Speaker 5:          00:10:19       Oh fuck

Speaker 4:          00:10:22       you fucking cunt. You such a, you know, you stole our offense then you won a super bowl. Isn't that enough? Leah? Jimmy, Jimmy. Um, so ridiculous. It's the only owners name that I know him well. We have an old Bobby Craft who made all that money with the cheese, Denise, which brings us back to Wisconsin. Um, so anyways, I'm going to watch that game tonight and uh, and I think that's it. I think that's all I got. I don't know what else I'm going to do. I went to F, I drank, I guess stopped drinking. Dude, I drank way too much this fucking week. You know, I have nobody, you know what is, I have nobody to answer to. All right. You can sit there and say that you know you're, you're one of these people, right? Oh, I'm one of these people. I just, you know, everything in moderation. Fuck you. Shut your face. All right? You're wearing too much makeup, first of all and shut your face.

Speaker 6:          00:11:18       Okay?

Speaker 4:          00:11:20       First of all, the reason why you don't drink it cause you have a fucking boss, which is like having a parent, all right? So I don't want to fucking hear it. You have somebody to answer to. Anybody can be fucking responsible and not drink when they have a child,

Speaker 6:          00:11:34       okay?

Speaker 4:          00:11:34       When they have a boss, when they have somewhere, they have to be the next day, all right? When you really find your willpower and what you're made of is when you have none of those things. When you have no children, you have no boss. You have nobody to answer to. Your wife's cool. You know, you snore. She just sends into the guest room, right? That's when you find whether or not you're an alcoholic or not. That's when you see if you're really going to pass the fucking test. And I'll tell you right now, oh, freckles, all freckles is failing miserably. Oh my God. I was drinking. A buddy of mine was fucking leaving town. So I, we go out and we fucking drink and he's got a buddy of his and at one point the guy comes over with like, I don't know what it was. It was some sort of fuck, it was like red bull with a Jaeger shot in it. And I have to commend myself for the, for everybody. Fucking drank it, but me as like, I'm drinking scotch, I'm a fucking drink in that. She says, Christ fucking mouthwash and monster drink the fuck is wrong with you, but you're homeless. I could literally go out to the dumpster and find something better to get drunk off of. What the fuck? What the four red bull at a gate, whatever the fuck it was.

Speaker 7:          00:12:51       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:12:52       Was given all of them shit. Like why don't you just fucking, you know, do a shot of shampoo and some fucking licorice. Um, is that what you said bill? Well, you know, I don't really remember. I don't really remember. I just remember, uh, being smart enough not to drive. I don't do Uber though. I'm old school man. I got a taxi, but everybody can hug. I'll do it. I'll fuck it over. Yeah. It's just weird to me, man. I don't like just getting in a stranger's fucking car.

Speaker 7:          00:13:19       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:13:20       You know, without that fucking partition there some sort of writing on the side of the car. You know, a phone number of somebody you can call off when the guy takes out an ax.

Speaker 7:          00:13:28       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:13:28       I just, I don't understand like how lazy are serial killers that they can't even fucking muster up.

Speaker 7:          00:13:35       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:13:36       Well I guess that makes them more, I, they can't even muster up to fucking wear with all, just to become an Uber driver. Why don't you make your life easier? Quit fucking pulling over and dragging people in the car. Why didn't you just become an Uber driver? Just let him get in the fucking car. Why don't you just do that? Is there any checks and balances on it? You just fucking show up and there's a guy, hey, how you doing? Hey person, I don't know what the company that, I don't even know what it is. Does it even exist? Is it in the air? Is it a digital company? I don't understand any of this shit works. Speaking of that, you know what's the dumbest fucking thing I've seen in a while is the fucking Iwatch. I really hope that that thing bobs,

Speaker 4:          00:14:21       you really got to sit there watching video. Like you're fucking g can't figure out what time it is and you just staring at your wrist. Is that what you got to do? All those stupid features. I think they're out of ideas over there. That's what happened. I'll, Steve jobs died, right? He's not cracking the whip and those scientists over there, they, they getting lazy. What are you gonna make next? Huh? Earrings that you can watch youtube videos on. It's, it's over. Everything that needs to be invented is invented and that's why all these scientists are, that's real reason. All these

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       scientists, they're dying. You seen all this shit. You had another dead scientist, right? Alberto Har was a robotics expert for NASA at the JPL. And everybody in science knows that that stands for, uh, the, uh, jerk plain longitude. Whether the fuck is, he died instantly when a single engine plane, nose dives, fucking scientist. God, you have scientists right nosedive shortly. Have to take off Friday morning from Van Nuys Airport. He worked on two Mars missions and spent years researching how robots work in harsh environments like volcanoes and underwater. Well, I can tell you they work in volcanoes. They'd fucking melt you to do research on that. Um, as part of NASA's team exploring Mars with the curiosity rover, ugh. Maybe that's why he killed himself. He had to keep what project you're working on. Just mumbling curiosity for over the y, the curiosity rover. Awkward silence at the dinner table and then somebody with a GED started snickering.

Speaker 1:          00:16:05       Curiosity rover, let me get, cause it's curious fucking eggheads. It's the best she can come up with. Bay was responsible for a device that detected hydrogen on the planet's surface. As the rover moved curiously over the surf over the surface, 47 year old nasty that I'll fuck it all. That sounds to me. 47 I'm going to be 47 in June. Does that mean I'm good at Psi? Um, 47 year old NASA scientist help Berto Bihar helped to prove that there had once been water on Mars according to the sad daily mail. Oh well shit. Daily Mail is a credible source. Published two announced his recent death in a plane crash that happened on Friday in Los Angeles, California while playing crashes do as it is where you go into conspiracy theory right here. While plane crashes do happen and scientists do die. Uh, Bay whores name has now been added to a very long lists of scientists and astronomers who've met their untimely ends prematurely leading, leading us to ask, did bay hard know something that they, that they in quotes don't want the rest of society to find out what the fuck could this guy is

Speaker 4:          00:17:22       possibly not. I don't understand what people are saying. Was global warming, so overwhelming to him and he knows that the seas, we're going to rise. So he just pushed the fucking yoke forward. And that was it. Is that what you're saying? Yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:17:34       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:17:35       This guy worked on robots. They designed a device that discovered fucking hydrogen a existed on Mars.

Speaker 7:          00:17:42       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:17:43       How could that hurt it? I, I, you know, I remember I used to be a conspiracy theory. I still think that there are conspiracies and I do think that, you know, I mean, I'd done, I'm conspiring right now to try to somehow do some fucking hour and act like this is entertaining. So you guys will listen to this shit. So you'll come out to my shows. This whole fucking thing doesn't even exist and here you are listening to it. They can get here in some sort of truth. Right? All right there. I'm going to debunk all of these six. Why he

Speaker 1:          00:18:06       die. Um, because scientists are underpaid and he didn't have a, so he couldn't afford a twin engine. So when this first one, uh, the first one cut out, uh, you know, he was kind of a, it's kind of fucked.

Speaker 1:          00:18:22       Sorry. I Dunno. John Rogers Tropica disease expert. Well maybe you got too close to the disease and if you see the size of his glasses, I think this is why, you know what these fucking scientists problems are, is they read too much and they ruined their eyes and then they get, then they start flying planes and they drive cars and they hit shit. You know what I mean? It's got a shock, you know what I mean? Is your life is flashing before you and that split second and then you know the exact way you're gonna fucking die. Cause you're a, you're an egg hedge scientists. So rather than me just flying towards a tree doing the macgruber knew no, they're actually going to, the library does go to us

Speaker 4:          00:19:01       sliding against the front of the cradle vortex and fuck. It can, they can just, they can do all of that.

Speaker 7:          00:19:07       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:19:08       Wonder if they're going to be brain dead, a male. This is just fucking more, but all right, Glen. Thomas ades and a bullet expert. Dan, we, why don't you just work with poisonous snakes while you're at it guys sitting there juggling plagues while he's eating a subway sandwich. No wonder riff. Let me guess. Did he die of a bowler? Um, and a spokesperson for the World Health Organization. Well, this isn't that the trifecta. This guy just shuts everybody down at the dinner table. Maybe people were sick of him dominating the conversation. Right? This is my husband Glen Thomas. He's an a Bulla and aids expert. And what he's not doing that. He's a spokesperson for the World Health Organization. What do you do? I tell shit jokes in a strip mall. Um, a bola expert, Glen Thomas, who looks surprisingly like Chris Elliot was among the 298 people who were killed when a Malaysian airlines flight. Mh 17 was shot down and cracked in the UK. Well, what the fuck? Yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:20:08       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20:08       He got he. Yeah, I mean, what about all the other people that, yeah, well that

Speaker 4:          00:20:11       died on there, but there was some plumbers, couple of teachers. How come everybody's paying attention to the scientists? You know what, this all this shit comes from. It's the fact that everybody knows, everybody knows everybody's got, yeah, everybody's got some secrets. Right? And you know there's people up there. Just the excitement. They must have, you know, having the cures for diseases or whatever. The just the shit that they know, like say they, you know, they're talking about this giant fucking iceberg that's going to melt in Antarctica, that's going to raise the entire fucking ocean eight feet, which I don't get. It's like how big,

Speaker 7:          00:20:49       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20:50       At what point is it stopped being a glacier? It's just all of Antarctica is melting.

Speaker 1:          00:20:55       You know what I mean? And I don't understand how Antartica right. It's just all fucking ice. Basically. You sitting there floating in the fucking drink, you know, if you put, if you put ice cubes in you, and this is what I'm really going to sound dumb. If you put ice cubes in a glass of water, the water goes up. So isn't that ice already in the fucking water? I don't know what's going on. No Bill. It's on land. Is it? Is Their land underneath there? I don't know what it is. I just thought it was a bunch of frozen water. And the reason for this is the sun is hitting the top. I used everything I want for my whole life. Everybody told me the reason why.

Speaker 7:          00:21:35       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:21:35       I'll ask you guys this. Do you know why it's hotter at the equator than it is at the pulse? Do you know why? From my whole life everybody said, well it's because you know it's closer to the sun, you know, because it kind of puffs out, right? Like when you had too many donuts, it's gotta, you know, or it's got a little muffin top, you know, it's got a lot of water weight down there. Like so all of a sudden you're whatever, you're like this club much close to the sun it. That's actually not the case.

Speaker 1:          00:22:08       Just waiting for you guys to fucking yell at me. What's basically is is it's getting direct sunlight and as the curvature of the earth goes up, that sunlight angle, it becomes more angled. And again, you're not taking a, it's basically, let's just put it in terms, everybody can understand the equator is getting a facial from the sun. Okay. It's not wearing glasses either. Okay. It's just, it's just taking it right in the face. All right. The polls are kind of looking away and fallen out of the way. Right? That's basic. What does it, so it's a glancing blow. They still got a little jizz in their hair, but it's a lot easier to wash off and that's why it's a hotter at the equator than it is in the North Pole. You see that everybody? I'm smart. I know. Thanks. Now, like everybody says. So anyways, let's get on it. So how did this, how and Glen Thomas Dye is understood? He was one of them, one of more than a hundred researchers who were aboard the flight on their weight or an international aids conference in Australia. Oh, Jesus Christ.

Speaker 7:          00:23:15       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:23:15       Wasn't it? Because there was some more on on the ground who couldn't tell the difference between an f 16 in a seven 47

Speaker 7:          00:23:24       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:24       Maybe he had a quote, you know, like those meter maids. It just got to start writing tickets and it was getting towards the end of the month. The edge shut anything down yet. And he was just like, fuck it. I get fucked. Fuck it up. They're moving. I don't give a shit. It's a fucking drone or a Goddamn parakeet. I'm shooting that fucker down and all of a sudden they come flying over.

Speaker 7:          00:23:43       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:23:44       All right. Mark Fairy.

Speaker 4:          00:23:46       Oh Jesus. Yeah. Grow Up. Hey, you're fucking fairy. You had to deal with that. His whole life is poor bastard. 59 years old. Nuclear engineer, a renowned American engineer was found dead in his hotel room in Salford after his heart suddenly stopped working. Isn't that mysterious? Isn't that weird? But somebody could have a heart attack at 50 died. This is the dumbest conspiracy ever. Mark Ferry 59 from Tennessee. Well there you go. Sort of Tennessee grew up on fried food. Jesus Christ, they barely even have books in that state. The fact that this guy became a nuclear engineer grown up, you know, we didn't have shoes, right? And he just sat there. He was just this fun going anomaly on his crickety front porch, watching his whole fucking family playing instruments they made out of the fucking junk they had in their front yard and he's just sitting there going, I'm better than this. God dammit, I'm going to start reading. And he did. He started reading like Johnny Appleseed, except instead of walking, he was fucking letting his eyes walk. Walking all over those books.

Speaker 7:          00:24:52       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:24:52       Turning them into apple sauce. That's what mark ferry did. I'm going to eulogize this guy.

Speaker 7:          00:25:02       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:25:03       Mark Fairy wasn't dumb luck the rest of us in this state.

Speaker 7:          00:25:08       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:25:08       That mother fucker. I know I'm in charge. I'm sorry. Or I'm speaking from the heart here. Okay. Is understands that mother fucker. He said, I'm getting out of this state.

Speaker 4:          00:25:18       All right, I'm gonna. I'm going to read. I'm a find me a book. First of all, you know he had to go to lease to Georgia to discover he was walking the wrong fuck and why you thought I was going to say something good about Georgia. Danielle. Fuck Damn. Fuck Damn. Bull dogs, right? Go balls, golf balls. So this fucker said, wait a minute, I need to go up north. That's where they keep all the books, right? Cause we lost one fucking war and they got to take away all the books. I get it, I get it. So he walks up to Ohio and he found himself a fucking book and next thing you know he became him. So he became a nuclear nuclear engineer. I don't really know what that means and I don't know what that does, but he did it.

Speaker 7:          00:26:06       Okay,

Speaker 4:          00:26:06       you're not going to believe what the fuck just happened. My stupid recorder got full. I fucking eulogize that guy for like another five minutes. God dammit say it's a conspiracy. They shut off your little recording thing. Let me finish this. I got to go back to this guy mark ferry. So he walks up to fucking Ohio, get themselves a God damn book and he becomes a new player engineer. And as I mentioned before, before the fucking Illuminati shut off my fucking recorder. I don't really know what a nuclear engineer is. I just know it takes a long time to say it. So that's some shit, but I'll tell you there's mark. Very. All right. And I beat him up. I call him a fairy. I did all that. I never really even locked the guy. Who the fuck's kitten. Who? Oh, I'm sorry Martha. I had to say it.

Speaker 4:          00:26:55       I'm in God's house. Go tell true. Come here number seven. I want to ever, it is fucking bitch. She, she deserves that won't see me outside. Anyways, this mark ferry. All right. Despite him leaving Tennessee, he never forgot who the fuck he was. I'll tell you right now, ain't nobody up north dies of a heart attack if 59 medicine southern shit. All right. You know why that is? You know why that is? Cause I don't give a fuck. How far are you leave Tennessee. You ain't leaving that died. Yea. Leaving had died and British gets them ham hock and piggers sandwiches. He probably had he probably a barbecue grease all over their lab coat. That's right man. A real southern man. Y'All. You've met southern man that makes it to 60. If you make it to 60 is to sell the man. I hate you. You're laying down with another man. I'm sorry. Putting the whole phobia into it. Well that's true. According to the Bible. Um, so there you go. Let it go. Evidently mark ferry was not a fairy cause he died at 59. I blew somebody once to the truck stop, but I didn't do it in this day, so don't make a gay. Anyways, mark ferry,

Speaker 4:          00:28:25       he dead now and I'll tell you right now, I don't think you're ever going to see another nuclear engineer coming from the state. You ain't going to see another one like that guy in a long, long fucking time. All right, so everybody raise up your jars.

Speaker 7:          00:28:40       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:28:40       It was shot at shine from our fair. Um, recorder's still going. It is still going. So basically what you guys missed is, as I continued to read these fucking like any conspiracy theory, it's like the more you start reading, you start believing professional Carol amp. Bruster. Okay. She's 69 years old. 69 you think? Ah, she had a good run. She was found by a roommate and a kitchen, all right. With a knife in her neck and she'd already been stabbed in the chest. So it's just like, that's usually not what's Ha, you know?

Speaker 7:          00:29:15       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:29:15       It's the other one had been hogtied and burn to death. It's like, what? What are you scientists fucking gang bang. And now, you know what I mean? I'm starting to bleed the shit. Here's what, here's one. I actually believe Shane taught 31 phd in electrical engineering with an expertise with gals, gallium nitride, nitride, Shane, Todd, the man with two first names. All

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       right, here's the mystery. Dr. Todd felt increasingly uncomfortable with the work he was doing with the Chinese company. Who, who are we? Who, who are we? Who the fuck are, you know, so I can't, I'm sorry. I can't do that. Maybe if I did an a bad Chinese accent, it will work. Oh wait, hold on. Fuck. Are y'all, um, to the point Shane told his family sweaty. Got, who are we? H U a Weei man. They must be cheesy commercials.

Speaker 1:          00:30:11       Any ways to the point. Shane told his family that he was being asked to compromise US security and he feared for his life. Now this guy got whacked. Of course he did. What the fuck are you doing, dude? You'll be over your fucking, you're wearing the wrong fucking lab coat here. Melissa. Can nudie scientists have weird names? She was hogtied and Bernard. I'm starting to believe this shit. This guy, 58 died of a heart attack. Zachary died of fucking boating accident. That happens, right? Potomac. Everybody's hammered on the fucking botanic nother part. Attacks. Heart attacks a dismissed. Here's a weird one. Fan. John Mang and Chung Yang Sang [inaudible] Chung exam table for two Zang, a drown in a branch and hotel swimming pool. Both were in China. Both up were from China and we're working, dude. How the fuck does to people drop? Two adults drown in a fucking hotel swimming pool. They don't even have deep ends anymore, right? All you gotta do is stand up. I mean, I'm going to go up. Maybe they got drunk. It's like fucking too bouncy steps into the side. You've got something to hang onto. Oh, Jesus Christ. I'm starting to believe this shit. Gregory Stone 54 from an unknown illness. While that happens, Bradley 56 died in a car crash. What? You know, they're reading, they're, they don't have good eyes.

Speaker 6:          00:31:48       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:31:49       Dr Masud Alley. Mohammed d 50 was assassinated January 11th when a remote control bomb inside of his motorcycle near his car was detonated. I mean, that happens an avenue. A buddy of mine the other day, the professor of nuclear physics at Terra in university was politically active. Oh yeah. Yeah. He, this guy got whacked. You should see his picture too. It's like he knows it's coming and got a couple more days left for this shit. Jack P. Wheeler, the third 66 last seen December 30th found dead in Delaware. A Delaware landfill. Yeah. He got whacked anytime. He ended up in a landfill, fought to get the Vietnam memorial built and was served and served in two Bush administrations.

Speaker 4:          00:32:58       Is that suspicious? I don't know how many of you can try to say this woman, Zane. She was dead. I'm an apparent suicide by cyanide.

Speaker 7:          00:33:07       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:33:07       At a temple terrace hotel, she left a suicide note saying she used cyanide Hazmat team officials said the cyanide was found only in a granular form, meaning it was not considered dangerous outside of the room. It was founded and chemical is considered more dangerous in a liquid or gas form. Potassium cyanide, the apparent causes potassium cyanide, the apparent cause of deaths as a Kimberly come and use it. But I, I, I don't understand what the fuck that is. I mean, she said she, you sign, I just fucking right there.

Speaker 7:          00:33:43       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:33:44       Now the woman died at the hands of Amy Bishop. Her background was in Jason's. Who would've thought, it's so fucked this, these guys are dying like a,

Why don't we just sort of some fucking Chinese food?

Speaker 1:          00:40:40       That's what we did. Chinese food on Easter. Don't Jewish people eat Chinese food on a Christmas. I got to tell you, I loved it on Easter.

And then she showed up with a lemon meringue pie and that was my Easter. No bunny, right? No fucking going down to church. And you've got to listen to the Jesus story over and fucking over again. You know what I mean? It's such an amazing story. You think that they could make a good movie about it? You know what I mean? I mean, technically it should better than all of those

Speaker 4:          00:41:34       born identities, but it isn't, I don't know what they need. They should make just, you know, if I look the Catholic churches, who's kidding, who, it's sliding down a grease pole. You know, nobody's buying. Nobody's going anymore. All right? It's like it did. It's like the Jacksonville Jaguars of the, of fucking religions as far as you know, old stadium. Nobody's showing up. Plenty of seats. What do you want to sit down in front? Get you got it. It's all you. All right. You can hang out with the fucking players afterwards. So when I would do is I would, I would invent like the eye Catholic church, you know, just rip off apple to get these kids. You get flat screens in there, right? You do. You get Tupac, whatever they did to him where he became the, the, the homogenized version. Where the fuck is it? The the Holyoke graph. What the hell has it? Because it was an h, a holograph, a little cube, whatever the fuck it is. You do that, but you just do it with the priest. You have some of the best priests of all time. The two parks, the fucking biggie smalls of priests and you bring them back to life just like Jeeva. Fuck it. You just bring Jesus back. That's what you do. Yeah. If I'm up there right, he comes down from the fucking all pixelated coming down from the ceiling. You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:42:57       People don't believe it's him at first day. Oh, what are you, did you fucking make dad? You shoot that with a potato? Laughing my ass off on the floor over here, shaking my head. That guy, you know, you got to take a little shit from the Twitter Razzi right? And then all of a sudden you just, you just keep saying no, that's actually Jesus.

Speaker 4:          00:43:14       Right. And if you watch that thing on Scientology like I did, you know what I mean? What did you learn? Other than the fact that it just takes 2,600 lawsuits at the same time and the IRS will cave. Uh, that's the only thing I learned other than that is, is that, you know, is that they all, they dress like they're in buck Rogers, which is, you know, it's kind of cool, right? I'm going to space movies. No, I ain't, what the fuck? I'm saying you get some flat screens, right. Get some Chinese food, you go easy with the guilt and you bring them back, you know, and you try as hard as you can to not fuck any more children. And I think he could turn this business around. This is like, that's what does that, what does that show with? A guy comes in and he's tries to to fix your bar. What's it called? Bar Fixer. Huh? Dive doctor. Whenever the fuck they is, some stupid name, right?

Speaker 1:          00:44:03       It comes in your fucking beer. Tap smell whacked. My wife's but Jen. Oh, July. When she gets off and elliptical. All right. Just even at people about their dumb ass bars. Do you just got to do that with the Catholic Church? You just go in there screaming. He why's that guy? Fucking a child. All right. Can you turn the whole fucking thing around? What would it be? Gotta be alleged literation like Christ fixer, but it's gotta be with another c. Cry. Christ crier. Jesus. Jammin I don't know what the fuck you call it. Christian mingle. How bad is that Christian mingle. How fucking creepy is mingle that's going on here and mingle. I really want to see your tits. It's just seems like you'd just be mumbling a bunch of shit. I don't want to see it. There's no fucker. No three way. Oh, I'm sorry. All right, here we go.

Speaker 1:          00:45:00       Let's, let's, let's read some of the, uh, that's really some of the fucking questions here for this week, shall we? Well, I don't give a shit. I'm running shit. Okay. By the way, if you'd like to email me, if you'd like to hear me read out loud something that you wrote and butcher it, uh, emails can be sent to bill@thempodcast.com. If you would like to follow us on Twitter, you can go to at the m m podcast. All right, here we go. Here we are a hug if somebody were rough on here. Okay. All right. It is my husband to cheat. Dear Bill, and I'm a 34 year old fucking lady and had been married for six years. I'm hoping you can help me with some advice on my marriage. For the most part, my husband and I are pretty similar, but we have completely different outlooks on finances already already.

Speaker 1:          00:45:53       I'm already thinking sexist shit here, so I got to stop. All right. I'm picturing you just buying a bunch of dumb shit that any of fucking you're, you're driving them to an early grave. But let's see. Maybe, maybe, maybe this guy is a cunt. That'd be openminded here. All right, open mind. My husband works full time and I work part time myself and I'm, and am a startup with my husband works full time and I work part time myself and am a housewife. I swear to God that's how she wrote the sentence. Should be. And I am a housewife and am a housewife. You'd never have fucking three short words that begin with a in a row myself and am a housewife and Ama and am a housewife. That's awesome. My husband works full time and I worked part time I thought and I, my house, like I get it.

Speaker 1:          00:46:44       You fucking spoke this into a speaker, right? That little magic device on your phone. Um, early in our marriage, we both work full time, but it became difficult for me when I would clean the house on days off and he would not be helpful in sharing those duties. Oh, this guy, he's old school lifting his feet up as you come by with the fucking swift. Um, he would Paul's, he would just play video games and I'm not a clean freak or anything. I just don't like living in a shit show of a house. Oh my God. I fucking love this woman. You're right up my alley. Uh, before we were married, he would let dirty laundry pile up for weeks before he washed it. Jesus Christ. This guy's an animal. I probably should've spoke to him about it, spoke to him about that before we got married or live together first.

Speaker 1:          00:47:32       But I did not see it as a huge issue at a time. Uh, you were young. What did you know? Anyways, after a year of marriage, we decided that the best way would be for me to do the housework and work part time and make dinners while he worked full time. Jesus Christ, this fucking guy, he's crushing it. You know, he's, he's got an old school wife here. Listen, listen. You quit your dream. I'll live mine when I come home. You better have this place tidy with the fucking steak on the table. Um, all right, here's the issue. Here's the issue with our marriage and I would love your opinion. This is where if I was her girlfriend, we'd be clasping both hands, both of our hands across the table. This is what I need. You. Okay? Oh, I'm here for you, Karen here for you. Just get it out.

Speaker 1:          00:48:21       Uh, my husband is very, um, it's very conservative with our money. This guy doesn't have one redeeming fucking thing. He's a slob. He's a fucking tightwad. I hate this guy. Um, he will save and keep our 20 grand in our finances for any, well that's smart though. I don't know. He's kind of smart. He will save and keep our $20,000 in our finances for anything that could happen. I admire it and think it's very smart. However, he loses sleep over it and we were rarely will go out and do anything together as a couple. Yeah, his guys, he's, oh, he's taking it too far. All right. Um, we make enough money between the two of us to pay our bills and save. Mind you, you don't get a fucking reprimand. Me. Um, he gives me a sum amount allowance every month to buy groceries and other personal items.

Speaker 1:          00:49:11       If I use another card, he will confront me and tell me not to use the other debit card. And if I am low on funds for groceries, we need to buy ramen for the rest of the month. All of our arguments are about money, I believe in saving money. But at the same time, I think it's great to live a little and buy items for enjoyment from time to time. I love to go out somewhere fun. I'd love to go out somewhere fun on a date. Oh my God, dude, this is sad with my husband without him worrying about money the whole time. I can't buy concert tickets without asking him first to surprise him. Like he's kind of, he's fucking likewise. He never surprises me with anything either. If this thing ends with you on your fucking hands and knees scrubbing the floor boards cause he wouldn't even buy you a fucking swifty. Um, what should I do? I've confronted him about how I think his fear is unhealthy. Am I wrong? I'm telling you. She goes, I'm telling you it's a rough one. Okay. I love it. I love that you threw that in there. She's got a sense of humor. This, I think this woman's cool. Thanks. I love your comedy and listened to your podcast every week. Uh, go fuck yourself. All right. Yeah. This, this woman's a fucking champ. The amount of shit putting up with

Speaker 4:          00:50:28       all right. She's got a sense of humor. She's listened to the podcast. I Aye. Aye. Aye. Oh, maybe she snow me, I think. I think, I think you're totally cool. Yeah. This guy needs to fuck and he needs to relax.

Speaker 6:          00:50:41       MMM.

Speaker 4:          00:50:43       I don't know. What would you do here? Just say, look, something's got to change here. All right. Cause I haven't been to a fucking cheesecake factory and like nine years. Right? You gotta take me this guy. He this guy. You know what it is. He doesn't understand. He doesn't understand women.

Speaker 4:          00:52:31       Give him the date rape drug. Let them pass out at the table.

It was weird. It was like you were eating the ramen noodles. It just, you went facedown in it. I'll tell you. Thank God you're too cheap to boil water and that water was at fucking room temperature. You might've burned your face.

Speaker 6:          00:53:01       MMM,

Speaker 4:          00:53:04       I you, you either got a roofie them is in Goa are, are you good? Are you got to just say, listen, I need to go out.

Speaker 6:          00:53:13       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:53:13       Okay. I can't keep living like some fucking broadened a fucking miserable fairy tale that's waiting for is for, for fucking prince charming. Didn't show up. All right, here's the deal.

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       Fuck. Oh, once a month you're taken me out. All right. You're making me feel like a fucking lady. You're making me feel attractive. All right, around, I'm going to start fucking working again. I'm sitting here watching your sweaty balls, fucking underwear and you can't even take me to a Goddamn Chuckie cheese. Huh? You cheap content. I Dunno how to do you know what? Maybe he's listening to this. Don't take her out for Christ's sake. All right. Listen, the dollar's going to collapse anyway. See, a 20 grand is going to be worth shit. So why don't you go out and fucking buy a pork chop with it while you still can. There you go. All right, here we go. Fear of damnation. Dare Bill. Growing up Catholic.

Speaker 8:          00:54:10       Hello

Speaker 1:          00:54:12       Gj age. My parents instilled me, I'm still me with a, a healthy fear of damnation. Like so many others. As I got older, I grew away from the church, but the fear of going to hell was never far from my mind. This is why it's funny that everybody made fun of the fucking Scientology movie. Just San us a cult. Those people are fucking crazy as opposed to what the shit we're doing. I love Scientology for the simple fact that they sued the fucking IRS and they went, all right. All right. All right. Jesus Christ. These people are crazy and they beat the IRS. That goes a long fucking way. All right. A couple of kids die every year due to the common cold, but other than that, I think it's a good religion. Um, over the course of my life, I've had many opportunities to wrong others somewhere out of necessity and some due to my own greed or poor judgement.

Speaker 1:          00:55:04       Jesus, this took a fucking left turn. Did I miss a paragraph? Um, I lie awake at night with the details of each sin running through my mind, how it affected those people I hurt and what their lives would be like had I never altered it with my own destructive presence. What the fuck did you do to these people? This guy sounds like a worse person than me. This sins weigh on me as they should and I wondered if I'm going to burn in hell for the things I've done or if I could possibly turn it all around. The Bible provides some details about the afterlife, but doesn't get too specific about how each person is, but it doesn't get too specific about how each person is tormented when they reach hell. Well, don't ever read Dante's inferno. You don't want to read that. My biggest fear is that after I die, I would arrive. And while burning in the internal fire, your plot chess would be playing on a loop.

Speaker 6:          00:56:02       Ah,

Speaker 1:          00:56:03       fucking hilarious. Please help me. I'll do anything. Give to charity, save a puppy. Whatever it takes. I have to redeem myself somehow so I won't have to hear your voice yammering on about the NFL and cackling at your own jokes forever.

Speaker 6:          00:56:20       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:56:22       Ah, you got me. You of a bitch. That's fucking hilarious. Um, alright. Icebreaker. Bill. I'm terrible at starting a conversation with the girl. I'm good in an actual conference I'm on. And why that guy? Why don't you just not listening to the podcast?

Speaker 4:          00:56:38       You know what I mean? Maybe he listened to one and I was so fucking annoying. Or you know what's even better? Maybe he works with somebody and they played in like the warehouse. Uh, do what? I'm sorry. I know I'm annoying. I can't argue with anything you said. Ice Greg icebreaker. Bill. I'm terrible at starting a conversation with the girl. I'm good. In an actual conversation. What does that mean? Oh, okay. So you can just like if somebody says, uh, Hey, welcome to fucking daddy's. Can I help you? You're like, yeah, I like texted a placket dude. I'm crushing, crushing that Shit. Um, anyways, but I rarely get anyways. I'm good in actual conversation, but I rarely get there because it starts off bad. What advice can you offer? Do you have any lines or topics that would work? Thanks and go fuck yourself, dude. You just going to have to learn to have a sense of humor about yourself. You're going to have to fucking bomb.

Speaker 6:          00:57:33       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:57:34       You just kind of have to go up and bought me this. There's no fucking, hey baby. What's she assigned line that works? You've got to just come up. Here's the thing. Don't, if you're not good at hitting on women, don't go to a fucking meat market. All right?

Speaker 6:          00:57:47       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:57:48       What you gotta do is you got to chat him up while you're just doing a, just do it. It's been so long since I've been fucking singing. I was never good in the meat market bars. I was always better. Like I met women on the train. I met him in like the fucking gym. Okay.

Speaker 6:          00:58:04       Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:58:04       I met him like, uh, like when we were doing like we're both riding on a fucking trade, you know what I mean? And there's no, they don't, they, I, they have their guard up. I guess you're not going to be a mugger the fuck would I do, how would I talk to them on a train? I would just wait for someone if I saw someone that I liked on a train. Uh, the only way I could start up a fucking conversation is if some crazy homeless guy got on the fucking, you know, some crazy person gone on the subway and everybody's got that Oh shit. And then you make eye contact with them. And then I always had a joke about the fucking homeless guy. That's right. I took the piss out of somebody who didn't have a house and that would break the ice and then maybe, you know,

Speaker 6:          00:58:40       okay,

Speaker 4:          00:58:41       no, you're on the subway. It's like speed dating. You got to try and get the fucking number before they get off. Um,

Speaker 6:          00:58:46       okay.

Speaker 4:          00:58:47       But if you're not good at conversation, you've got it. You got to get good at it. And, um, I would say the Jim, Jim's kind of creepy, hey, what are your working on? You know, she's fucking bent over doing bent over rows. Whatever the fuck it is, the only advice I have for you, it's just like doing stand up. You just have to get on stage and you just see you have to figure it out. Um, so that's what I would do. I would get over your fear of bombing by getting out there and just bombing and have a sense of humor about how fucking bad it's going. Laugh at yourself and it just keeps swinging away. Just

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       keeps swinging away. I don't know, just uh, go go Ron Burgundy. Just be like overly arrogant about yourself. How fucking awesome you are. And just say the, the, you know that she's thinking all this awesome shit about you. You know, if you're an average looking guy, she'll think it's fucking hilarious and you kind of taken the piss out of yourself is that angle, you know what I mean? I mean I don't, I don't fucking know. You got, can I ask a married guy? I have no fucking idea anymore. Somebody helped us. You know what? Why don't you guys, why don't you guys send me in your best.

Speaker 7:          00:59:50       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:59:51       Icebreaker lines.

Speaker 7:          00:59:53       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:59:54       The only one I think I ever had a good opening fucking line was when I wanted to hit on this woman who was, I already told you this. I wanted to hit on this woman who was with this woman who was a redhead

Speaker 4:          01:00:05       and I walked out my, what did I say? I said, Oh, I go, oh hey, another redhead. I go, you go into the meeting, and then a friend left and then the red had thought I was into her and I had to do like, you know that swim moved that rushers do when they get trying to get to the quarterback. I had to fucking push her out of the way and talk to the Brunette. And then she was like fucking annoyed that I was hitting on her. And then her friend I think caved to the pressure of, or conti friend or maybe she just looked at me like a, I don't want to fucking talk to you. I made her laugh though. I got one laugh. I think I got one laugh.

Speaker 4:          01:00:38       And in all my years in those meat market bars, oh, that fucking horrible. Fucking horrible. You know what dude? I Dunno. You're asking another person that's stuck at it. I can't help you. So how bout uh, how bout a listener's gimme your best and your worst fucking opening lines, your best and your worst results. And I'll read those next week or whatever. And with any luck, that guy who hates me, someone will be playing it in the fucking background. Neighborhood bully. Hey Billy, bag of donuts. Hey Bill, I am 15 years old and I want to know how to deal with the kid who was bullying my six year old brother.

Speaker 7:          01:01:15       Okay,

Speaker 4:          01:01:16       well you go fuck them up. Step on his head. Uh, we live in a cul de sac and all the neighborhood kids know each other. They often play at the end of the cul de sac in somebody's backyard. I just recently learned that my friend's brothers sometimes brings over a friend who's seven years old and this kid goes over to the backyard at the end of the culdesac without the person who brought him and starts playing with the kids who belong to the neighborhood. Jesus Christ. Isn't that just called kids playing with each other? Now it's all supervised. The problem is that the kid is an asshole. He calls my brother's names, cause my brother names for no reason. I know my younger brother isn't lying based on his body language. Now I need your advice on what I should do. I told my brother to come get me so I could come over and talk to him. I was going to be as intimidating as possible without yelling or being threatening by completely keeping my calm and emotional and emotionless as he tried. Wait a minute. What the fuck just happened to the sentence? I was going to be as intimidating as possible without yelling or being threatening by keeping completely calm and emotionless as he tried to bust my balls.

Speaker 4:          01:02:26       Wait, what the fuck happens? Would that sentence that was in the past and in the presence, you tried to do that and then he bust your balls. I don't know what's going on here. I don't necessarily know if this is a good idea. I was looking for advice. Should I tell my friends moms, so this sheet, this little shit can never come back. Thanks and go fuck yourself. Ps, if you are reading this on Friday, April 3rd it's my birthday. I'm not reading it Friday, April 3rd but happy belated birthday. All right, that's okay.

Speaker 7:          01:02:53       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:02:53       That fucking email was in like 12 different times zones.

Speaker 1:          01:02:58       So what should you do? I don't know. Just walk up to him. You're 15 he's seven. Hey Yo. You know what's great about that age? If he, if he, if you catch him off guard with a hey, they might piss themselves a little bit. You just walk up right behind him. He just go high like that. Like fucking ps himself and can I talk to you? They'd be, Hey, can I talk to you for a second there again, that's my little brother over there. He's, he's telling me you keep calling them bad names. What's, what's going on with that? Me just let them sit in the awkward silence

Speaker 1:          01:03:33       and then when he tells you why he's doing it, just say, look, if you keep doing that to my brother, I don't know. I, I'm just, I don't know what I'm going to do, but I just keep picturing my entire hand covering your face and then me throwing your whole body like a baseball over that fucking fence. You don't want me to do that because you weigh enough while you might land on top of the fence and that could, uh, that could poke into your entrance there. Do you want me to do that? Because I don't want to do that. All right, well then stop fucking with my brother. Your little shit. That's what you do that don't do that. You have to be an adult.

Speaker 4:          01:04:12       You have to go over to that fucking kids. Awful mom and say, Hey, can you fucking, you know you're awful fucking kid.
