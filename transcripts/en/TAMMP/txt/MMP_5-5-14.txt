Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's the Monday morning podcast for Monday, May 5th, 2014 Cinco de Mayo, everybody happy. Cinco de Mayo to all a Mexican listeners and a white people and everybody else who just wants to go out and get shit faced tonight. Uh, for whatever reason. So you haven't excuse tomorrow when you drag an ash. Yeah, no real sure. A that up to your level of productivity that we're used to here at Cogswell cubs. And he'd be like, well, fuck you. I went out and I celebrate last night. What's the matter? You don't like Mexicans there you go off. One of the few times a white person can use the race card. Just slam that fucker. Write down, are you against Mexico? Well, how right then kindly remove yourself from my cubicle area. All right. I got drunk last night for America.

Speaker 2:          00:01:04       Um, oh, here's one for your last night. I was hanging out with Jason Law had, you know, obviously race has been a huge fucking split, a huge topic of interest over the last couple of days. Um, I was over a Jason Law heads, uh, place. He's got this apartment bill has got a really cool rooftop and uh, and I get to Cla, get to see the helicopters fucking with their spotlights down on some poor bastard trying to run away. I don't know how I feel about police helicopters out here or just in general. I mean, I'm all for catching the bad guys, but it does kind of get to the point of like, you know, how much fucking help do you need here? You guys already have your, you guys are all on the same team. You'll have uniforms. Okay. It's like 900 cop cars to one cop car. You're all on the radio. Hey, just made a right on fucking sunset. You need a helicopter to lighten the guy up. Jesus Christ. How long would Bonnie and Clyde last in this day and age, you couldn't fucking get away with, what am I defending right now? Homicidal maniacs, I guess I am. There's just something about like, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:02:17       so like when you watch a cowboy and Indian movie, you've got to root for the underdog. You Go, you go for the Indians. I guess the native Americans is that when they call them now, am I in trouble? Do I have to apologize? Um,

Speaker 1:          00:02:28       yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:02:29       yeah. He always root for the fucking underdogs. So I look at it, I ain't, what the fuck I'm saying? So when he was, so we're up on this roof and um, as we walk up on the roof, there's already some people partying up there. Um, and they're celebrating Cinco de Mayo, mostly Mexican people. I think up there playing the music and all that shit, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Everything's fine. So me and lie ahead and a bunch of white guys, we go up there and then we sit down on these other chairs and we start smoking cigars. And then all of a sudden one of the dude's comes walking over. He'd been drinking and they had like, you know, these, these potted plant bushes and the dude's walking over to an area where there is no exit. And then he walks behind the bushes and we're like, is he going to Piss over there?

Speaker 2:          00:03:13       So one of the guys that were with goes, he's like, Yo, Yo dude, that's not a bathroom man, that's not a bathroom. And the guy stayed down there for a minute. So then we go back to talk and in our cigars and then I hear him talking to his friends and you'll bro, that's not a bathroom. And then I hear, oh, we got your back, we got your back. Right. I'm sitting there going, Oh God, here we go and here we go. And a, so then I'm thinking like maybe he wasn't pissing. So that's why he's mad. And then he's looking at us going like, all those white guys already didn't like, it's up here with our music. And now we assumed just because I walk behind these bushes, then I was taking a fucking pissed and maybe I was just looking down over the side of the building to see if my friend was showing up.

Speaker 2:          00:04:01       Right. So that's what I'm thinking is playing out in my head. So long story short, he's fucking, you know, a couple of mean muggin looks over our way. And, uh, so I'm already thinking in my head how to verbally talk the whole situation down. Basically doing the exact opposite of what a bouncer does. You know, where they, their security, but they always escalate the situation. Remember that story told a while back or I saw two guys almost got into a fight in the bounces, fucking break them up and okay, hey, hey, you know what's going on here? And this guy goes, well this guy, and he kind of put his hand on the box of shoulder and the bouncer goes, okay, first of all, don't touch me. And immediately fucking escalated it now rather than he was coming over to, to diffuse it, he was escalating it.

Speaker 2:          00:04:43       So I was sitting there going like, all right, out of fuck, am I going to fucking conveyed to them honest mistake if to stu wasn't pissing, you know, I mean, what the fuck are we supposed to think? You're drinking, you stumbling over, you walk behind bushes on the roof, you know, to me that is classic. I'm drunk and I'm going to Piss the first place I can find, you know, no cover. I mean cover I should say, nobody could see me is what I should say. So, um, long story short, uh, this black dude comes over who's gay? This is like a fucking reality show. You know, where they get what all we need is an Asian guy and somebody with a sassy attitude. And I think I have a hit show here, you know? Um, so he comes over and he's like, yeah, sorry.

Speaker 2:          00:05:34       I don't even know he's gay, but he has like the gay accent, which I guess is homophobic to say, but he had an a feminine accent. I assumed he was gay. Not saying he can't get married in someday. Get divorced and lose half his shit. He has the right to do that. He has a right to do everything straight people do. Even the dumb shit. All right, did I cover my tracks? So he comes over and he goes, hey man, sorry about the blah blah. He goes into a policy mode and I go immediately into apology mode. I just say, hey man, honest mistake. We thought he was a taking a piss. I didn't know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And then in the end when he walks away, my other buddy goes, no, I could hear him piston. So I don't know what the fuck happened.

Speaker 2:          00:06:15       So then I guess the roof is really fucking thin and you know, they're playing music, dancing and shit. And then like the owner came up and then a little bit later this security person came up and I'm thinking the whole fucking time these guys, these Mexican dudes think that we called those people that these white guys showed up. Like, oh, what are they doing up on our roof? And that was completely not the case. And I was sitting there and of course, because I'm a Hollywood phony, rather than actually giving into the tension of it, I was actually thinking like, hey, this would be a really good scene in a script.

Speaker 2:          00:06:54       Just a complete misunderstanding. And uh, I thought, I still think it's a comedy. I don't think it's more like crash. I think it's a comedy because they were all young and in shape and we were a bunch of old white guys smoking cigars. So that would be a funny fight. There would definitely be like, you know the dual headlock shit going on with the shirt coming up in the ass crack coming out. You know what a real fight looks like. It's never pretty, you know, by the way, who all, who saw the Mayweather fight? Anybody? Um, I actually didn't see it. I heard it was a, it was actually a good fight. I just have so much faith in May, whether as a, as a fighter that I don't order his fights because he just wins every fucking time and, but he never knocks him out. So I just watch him pepper in the guy, you know, kind of dances around the first couple of rounds. That, is that what you're doing? Hey, you can try and do that. Okay. Did that pimp up a peep?

Speaker 3:          00:07:50       Ah, fuck it. Trey magic out again.

Speaker 2:          00:07:55       Fucking old guy starts yelling.

Speaker 4:          00:08:01       I don't know.

Speaker 2:          00:08:02       He made it more polo shirt. Your new book gave a pip. I Dunno, I think. Do you think he's going to get out and he's got three more fights. He's three more of, I'm actually worried about me, whether I can't tell. I know he's a smart guy, but I can't tell if he understands money or if that's all just to show, you know what I mean? Anytime you see a guy in a field where age is a factor, like by the time you hit 40 and they have like, like fucking an airport hangar of all white cars, you know what I mean? You just start saying that. Or like once you buy the tiger, what's some other dumb shit? You have your own water park in your backyard. I mean, you just can't sustain that. You literally start living a lifestyle where it's like, the only way I can afford this is this for is if I'm champion of the boxing world, you know, eventually you're going to be 50 and unless you Bernard Hopkins, I mean you're not, you're not going to be the champ anymore and now you got a tiger next to a water park next to fucking nine white Bentley's and I don't know.

Speaker 2:          00:09:13       I don't know. You gotta get like that. You got to get the, you got to get the outside the business money. You know what I mean? I'm literally drawing a half a circle right now. As I'm saying outside the business money. I'm trying to think of a good example of it. I would say 50 cent with this fucking vitamin water. Brilliant.

Speaker 5:          00:09:29       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:09:30       that's fucking brilliant. That's like a fucking hooker with who, who fucking take so hookah money and then fucking buys an apartment building so you can get underneath out from underneath your pimp because that's really kind of what show businesses. It's funny you come into this business, you think you're the pimp, and then about, I don't know, for me about 15 years in, you're like, oh, wait a minute, I'm the guy walking the block. I need to somehow try and make money outside of this business because I can only shake my ass for so long before another young red heads going to be coming along and then I'm finished. Right? So I need, I need to go buy a whorehouse, which is a fucking comedy club. I don't know what I need to do, but I got to start making money outside of this business because I'll be fucked if I'm going to be some old bald guy in a fucking wrinkled Tuxedo on a cruise cruise ship, you know, I'll be sold at that point.

Speaker 2:          00:10:26       Not only will I be telling jokes, I will, I'll do be also kind of singing classic songs from the American Song Book. You know, you know what's up with the president? Yeah. We got to get back up budget. I think you need to go back to fucking Arkansas. People laugh and then I'd be like, ah, here we go. A Samoan but up k blow it in from across the sea and I do a big thing like, like, like you know, I got a fucking one of those check whores on fucking prices, right? Oh, new car. They do that little swing with their hand. Like as if he can't see the fucking car. That's what I would be doing a cross the sea, you know, just like, there it is. We're out on a boat. You are a fat fuck.

Speaker 5:          00:11:12       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:11:13       You know, fucking dance with me. We'll go to the casino. You don't really like about cruise ships? I don't like how they decide when you fucking eat. You know, like all of a sudden I joined this guy's navy.

Speaker 2:          00:11:28       I did one cruise ship and that's the thing that I hated the most. Aside from the fact that you couldn't get away from the crowd there. You good? Sheller says ILS that, hey, just want to tell you that. Take it to the fire house. Fuck off. It's over. Hey, I liked your shorts yesterday. Those shorts, your war. How would you like to hear that? I'll fucking day. It's not their fault. I do. You come up with your material. I actually thought about jumping overboard like half the fucking time, and I am terrified of the ocean, but I thought the water would be cold enough that hypothermia would get me before I get eaten by a fucking shark. And even then by then I'd be so fucking numb. You know? Maybe it wouldn't hurt.

Speaker 1:          00:12:08       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:12:09       I don't know. What am I, what was I talking about? Oh, we're talking about race. We're talking about racial issues. Um, so this week I'm going to try to remember what the fuck happened. Oh, okay. The first one that happened literally happened the day I put up the podcast. And, um, you know, it's a fucking pet peeve of mine is on Twitter.

Speaker 1:          00:12:29       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:12:29       All right. When some con we'll fucking send me a tweet. Male. A female client. Okay. Equal, equal look up, Tony. Um, we'll say like, uh, hey bill, did you see this thing about Donald Sterling and the clippers? And then they just write thoughts?

Speaker 1:          00:12:49       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:12:50       Like I'm just supposed to just start fucking, oh, well shit. Let me just take time out of my fucking day, you know? Hey, talk about, uh, this fucking thing and then when you fucking talk about it, I talked to you once a week on Monday.

Speaker 1:          00:13:06       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:13:08       Fucking Twitter crunch. Drive me nuts. Thoughts, thoughts. Anyways, sorry, I'm really being a car today, but I, I just, uh, I can't help it. It's who I am. So anyways, yeah. Uh, I love that. What, what, what could your thought fucking possibly be other than like, yeah, that was horrific.

Speaker 1:          00:13:26       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:13:27       it'd beat. I'm like a lady. It's not like I don't have a bit on it, but I'm not going to do it on the podcast. But a, I can't tell you this though. I didn't understand what Mark Cuban was talking about where they were saying, well, he gave these slippery slope.

Speaker 1:          00:13:39       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:13:40       The slippery slope thing there. There's always somebody like whenever you like a, you know, hey, this guy says he loves Hitler, we got to get rid of them. And then there's always that. Well, you know, that's a slippery slope. You know, you start with this guy, you know, where do you draw the line? How about, you know, you draw the line at a racist with fucked up mustaches. How about we draw? It's pretty clear and present line. Like I don't understand where the slippery slope. It's like if you're going to fire an owner for being overtly racist, what next? You don't like my shirt?

Speaker 2:          00:14:20       Ah, fuck. I mean I don't, I actually, in defense of him, I read the [inaudible]. Yeah, this isn't the fence. They might just Google it. And then I looked it up and I saw these sense kind of retracted it. Um, and all I have here is that the outspoken billionaire said it was a slippery slope to suggest that sterling should be forced out as owner over comments made in the privacy of his home. Um, yeah, I mean, well that's taken out of context, but I, I don't know. He, he said what said was wrong. It was abhorrent. I don't even know what that word means. Must be bad cause whores in their hip. Horan uh, there's no place for racism in the NBA, any business I'm associated with. But at the same time, that's a decision that I make. I guess he's saying I make a decision not to be racist. I think you've got to be very, very careful when you start making blanket statements about what people say and think as opposed to what they do. It's a very, very slippery slope. So what, what is he saying there? I don't get it. And is he saying that all right, this guy says racist shit.

Speaker 1:          00:15:26       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:15:29       In his personal life. But during the day, his business is made, he has 11 employees on his players, on his team, and 10 of them are African American. So despite what he says on the fall, if everybody hired the way this guy did, I mean that's a higher than 90%

Speaker 1:          00:15:50       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:15:50       African met shit. White people will be out of jobs. I don't know what he's saying there. I don't understand where the slippery slope is, but um, I dunno. Well, I mean, what, what are you going to do with the guy said when he fucking said, and I understand that it was a private conversation, but he was dumb enough to do it over the phone. He, he's just by dumb enough. I'm not saying that you, he should have just said it without being on the phone. I'm, I know what he said was wrong. But the thing is, is every fucking move he made is his own fucking fault. That's his own fault. Does his own fucking fault that you would say something like that over the fucking phone to a woman who's acting like she's into you, who's 50 years younger than you?

Speaker 2:          00:16:41       You're a fucking moron. It was unbelievably reckless. And uh, I'm glad he did it because a, I dunno, it's just fucked up. It's just fucking, you know, I don't, I, I would, I would understand that guy. If that guy lived in the middle of fucking nowhere and he lived around all fucking white people and he was 80 years old. I mean, that's a layup. I mean, shit he does. Yeah. That's obviously how he's got a fucking thing. This guy was born in 1930 something, you know, and he was raised by people who were born in like the turn of the fucking century and had Harry Truman for a president who was one of the most biggest fucking racist sever. Right? Was that his first fucking name? I don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:17:23       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:17:25       So anyways, I mean, yeah. What the fuck you think he's going to be thought? I mean, this guy, he got raised by racist and then, and then he didn't fucking travel, but this guy actually traveled.

Speaker 1:          00:17:34       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:17:35       That's, that's the one that I don't get. I don't get, when you finally have interaction and you actually have examples and it's a specific person that you now know that you can still think that way. Um, and then the, the fucking phone messages hilarious because he's literally talking to somebody who's half of, what will she have a black half Latino and he's literally trashing black people tour. And as she's getting offended, he's sitting there going like, oh, you're mean, oh, don't you understand how your words hurt

Speaker 4:          00:18:07       me

Speaker 2:          00:18:13       and is fucking awful as it was. I would love to have that level of money that you're, that fucking just so wrapped up in yourself that you don't even realize you're hurting people in your, actually you're, you're playing the victim yourself. I Dunno. So now it's actually, I don't think he's going to try and sell the team, which is going to be fascinating as they try and force this guy out. But I think they should be able to do it because he's fucking with the whole image of the league.

Speaker 6:          00:18:42       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:18:43       You know, I dunno, one of it, one of his shit like this comes out. It always bugs me because then everybody gets to act like holier than now because they didn't get caught saying anything fucked up. You know what I mean? I don't know. I think people say fucked up shit. I think everybody says fucked up shit. And I think people think fucked up shit and they're just smart enough to not say it out loud. And I don't even think that it makes you a racist. You just think you just see it. You can't hit fucking help it.

Speaker 6:          00:19:09       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:19:10       You just fucking, your approach, how you grew up, you proud of experience in every, you know it is. Everybody has fear. So fear will drive you into thinking the worst of somebody if you're in a fearful situation. Like I used to do a bit in my act, how everybody's racist at night and almost like you have to be so you can get home. You have to think the worst of people. So you're not that fucking idiot that just walks into a wood chipper. Well yeah, I'll help you start it, go over there and get knocked over the head and thrown in it. And then that's the worst. Then the next day everybody's like, yeah, it's awful that it happened. But Jesus, I think, well, what was this guy begging? So, um, I don't know, but I've got to commend all the clipper players. We're actually still going out and playing because, uh, I don't know that I would have,

Speaker 6:          00:19:59       you know,

Speaker 2:          00:20:02       I mean, you've got to feel like he just got to feel like, yeah, I've worked for some club owners that have been absolute dicks and I still had a couple up a fucking shows left and I wanted to like burn down the club and then choke the guy to death and throw them on the fucking ashes. Like I've felt that and still had to trudge through the show and there was no, no racism involved. There wasn't this negative thing that affected my life every fucking day. And then this guy actually persona fight it. It was just a guy being a dick and I still had to go up there and entertain his fucking, the people that were coming there because at that point it wasn't a draw. So they will basically come to the club and I wanted them to have a bad experience because I wanted this person to go out of business. I can only relate to it at that half a percent level. So I can't imagine what the fuck they will go through. But uh, it's going, I have to tell you on a selfish level, it's going to be really entertaining to watch this guy fight the fucking NBA,

Speaker 6:          00:20:54       um, and not try and

Speaker 2:          00:20:58       lose his team. I mean, Jesus Christ. What a fucking situation. It's just like, dude, just be a fucking man now and just walk away. You're going to drag down everybody with you. One of those guys,

Speaker 6:          00:21:11       you know, I dunno.

Speaker 2:          00:21:15       It's just what he did then causes everybody else too. A little bit about the other owners and all of that type of shit. It's just, he fucked up. He fucked up. He is fucked up. He got caught a bunch of times. I have a dental, he doing other shit and he never changed his fucking ways is fucking chickens came home to roost and uh, you know, and what's, what's his big penalty? He sells it and has $1 billion,

Speaker 6:          00:21:40       you know,

Speaker 2:          00:21:41       let's go buy a yacht, just drive out in the ocean and scream all your racist shit. And you know, you can be free out there, free to do what you want. I don't know. Did that make any fucking sense? You don't. It was, I had to fucking steer around all the, all the funny areas where I'm doing the bid on it. Oh. And then also the, uh, the Boston Bruins in the Montreal command, Canadian started another classic classic playoff series a, the first game went to overtime fucking Canadians one. And uh, then, uh, they had game to looked like they had it all wrapped up and the Bruins came back, came storming back to steel game too. So it's one, two, one, two, unbelievable. Like I put those games up against any fucking games and though in the history of that series, but unfortunately, PK, sue Vaughn scored the goal in overtime in game one. And then like a couple of years ago when that other, uh, African American player scored in overtime goal on the capital's, a portion of the Bruins fan base goes on and starts fucking trending the n word on a, on Twitter and then, and then that just opens the shit storm, you know, it's fucking ugly and all that type of stuff and it really ruins, it's such a pussy fucking move. You know what I mean? It's such a fucking,

Speaker 2:          00:23:09       it's such a pussy fucking, I don't even get it in 2014 to do something like that. And a almost equally annoying is then when people on Twitter start doing that real classy Boston when they send out like, that's like this hacky thing to say, way to stay classy. Like who started that and why does everybody say that now? And you only use class when you're talking about like a sports team now did that come from Ron Burgundy stay classy. San Diego? I don't know what it is, but I don't understand why people on Twitter can't express their views without using like, I dunno, like Twitter language

Speaker 2:          00:23:51       white. Why can't you, why can't you just say that? You know, that was fucked up Boston whaler you know, way to stay class or was that like that trending thing? I don't know what these fucking kids are doing, but here's the deal for all you holier than thou cons that tried to make racism a Boston thing. And I'm like, I can't defend Boston. Norwell lie. It isn't an overtly racist yet. Liberal fucking bizarre place. Like I think the reason why it's so democratic is because so many people in Boston want to get a fucking state job so they don't have to work. I mean, that was a lot of my friends. I want to get on the doll, I want to lean on a fucking shovel and know, get the benefits. Don't you know the fuck. Um, there's a lot of that go on that yet.

Speaker 2:          00:24:34       It's still just fucking overtly racist. But having said that, all you people that fucking wrote like Boston was the worst fucking city ever. Um, and also believe that racism is in the south and in Boston. Um, become a comedian and traveled the road. And, uh, tell me what you think because that has not been in my experience, and I'm not gonna fucking be a Douche now and name a bunch of towns or countries that I've been to, but I got to tell you that, uh, I dunno, it's weird. It's on one level where I think we've progressed a long way as far as maybe in the media.

Speaker 1:          00:25:17       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:25:17       Um, it's not as bad and I, but I sometimes I just think that people just know what not to say now, but, uh, on another level, I think a, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:25:28       yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:25:29       If the dollar collapsed, another Hitler could come along and fucking crush it, no problem there would, there would be enough, there would definitely be enough people signing up for that at that point so they could get their chicken noodle soup and get a nice fucking outfit, you know, and, and take out whoever the fuck he supposed to take out. I basically, that's what I have. I have, after traveling all of that, I've traveled. I have no faith in humanity. Ah, that's such a terrible thing to say, but it's true. It's awful. It's fucking awful. And you know what pks brother actually plays for the minor league Bruins. I don't know his name. He plays goal. And uh, so now this kid has to put on the fucking Jersey of a fan base that not only said it the most offensive word to his race, but called his brother that and it's just fucking, I just wished, you know, something.

Speaker 2:          00:26:22       I don't want like a big brother or anything like that. The only time I'm pro big brother is I really wish that when you wrote shit like that, then all of a sudden, like one of those police helicopters would just be circling your fucking house. And then you had to go to work the next day, hanging your head in shame because it's such a pussy fucking thing to do. Uh, and unfortunate and it takes away from this, this amazing series, the Bruins verse, the Canadians, which is going to go seven games. And uh, already there's a bunch of great storylines going on in it and the Canadians have a great fucking team. So the Bruins, I feel like the Canadians on the way up and we're getting a little bit old yet we have this young defense. I got tell you, dude, I'm fucking loving Douggie Hamilton,

Speaker 6:          00:27:08       you know,

Speaker 2:          00:27:09       just because he's young. He shoots the puck all the time, I feel, and he's coming down offensively and like, um, I dunno. Whenever you get like an older defensemen, it just seems they never shoot the puck and they always do the smart play. And you sit there like blowing out your fucking voicebox screaming at the TV going shut the fucking day. Just showed it. I, and I know they know the game way more than me, but uh, that doesn't stop me from choked the fuck it. They'd scream and you never have to yell that it Doug Hamilton, it's great. He just shoots it. Craig's the same way. Fucking phenomenal, by the way. I absolutely loved Johnny Boychuk Boychuk Johnny Boy Chuck Celebration when he fucking blasted that one in from the, uh, the Blue Line, the fucking Howard a shot. And when he put his hands up in the air, I swear to God he did his own version of the frank the tank. Remember frank the tank and old school when he started fucking doing the thing, like he was anti aircraft gun, he did his a little slower. So I think we hit as he was doing more six shooters. But that's gotta be the fucking greatest feeling ever. And the NHL, you're a Defenseman, you could skate 90 miles an hour backwards and then you bring it into the offensive zone and you just, from the Blue Line,

Speaker 2:          00:28:31       a fucking Bob goes right through everybody right into the back of the net. That's gotta be the greatest fucking feeling ever. So whatever. So the first one, uh, the next game is going to be in Montreal and game three is always a fucking crucial one in a seven game series.

Speaker 6:          00:28:49       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:28:51       I think if the Bruins, when it, we're definitely going to win the series. I would say, well definitely when the fucking series, if we lose that game, it's, it's going to be an uphill battle. I still think we can do it just because we have enough guys who were experienced.

Speaker 6:          00:29:06       Um, but I dunno,

Speaker 2:          00:29:09       that game's reason that motherfucker, uh, Allen, by the way, look at the Black Hawks.

Speaker 6:          00:29:15       All right. They

Speaker 2:          00:29:17       now they're where they want six in a row. Those mother fuckers are going to win it all again. And I think that we can get to the finals and I'm worried that it's going to be the same problem that we ran into last year, which was they were just too deep. They just had too many fucking guys. You know, Patrick Kane, Hosa, Jonathan Tabes and then you got there, great defense know Duncan [inaudible] halls guys. And it's just, it's just too fucking, you know, like you just don't get time off man. It's a fucking, they are still is still the team to beat. And I think that they can, uh, I mean they went and again this year, that's 2010, 2000. No wait, there was a 2010 then we wanted an 11 who won 2012. They want it last year, obviously. Oh, the kinks. Also, that wouldn't be a dynasty because they would want three and five years. They'll give you three out of four. They'll call it a dynasty. Back in the day you had to went three years in a row to be at dynasty. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:30:22       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:30:23       But either way, three and five years would be the shit. So I, I mean my money's on them to win it all. I just don't see, um,

Speaker 1:          00:30:31       yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:30:31       You know, barring injury, I just don't see anybody stopping him. I hate to say it. I mean, I'm obviously my heart. My brain tells me that my heart for the Bruins out, but uh, it's been amazing. And um, I've been kind of watching a little bit. The NBA playoffs, they look like they're fucking great too, but I just, I just don't watch this shit.

Speaker 2:          00:35:20       Um, I did something very UN redhead ish yesterday. I actually went to the beach. I'm not because I want it to, my wife wanted to go and, uh, I gotta tell you I don't like the beach. All right? It's fucking dirty and it's too hot. I'm not built for it. You know, people just stare at me like, look at it. Is it gonna take his shirt off? Or at least they feel like they are. You know, I go out there and it's just, it's a shit show. It's a fucking shit show. But, uh, I love my wife, so I took it and she has a great time soaking up the sun. She absolutely loves it. And it's just one of those things I have to deal with. You know, it was funny, we ran up a mall cause I had to buy some sunglasses cause this fucking dickhead bus boy stole my sunglasses.

Speaker 2:          00:36:14       I get this nice pair of sunglasses. I did this acting Gig, right? And in the end they got everybody something got really a nice pair of sunglasses that actually looked really good on my fat fucking head. And uh, I went into a Vegan restaurant, everybody Vegan fucking restaurant, my favorite Vegan restaurant in Los Angeles. Could I sound more pretentious? I'm bitching about sunglasses that I got for free, for working in acting in a movie and now going to a Vegan restaurant and now I'm going to bitch because the bus boys stolen and yeah. Yeah. That's how out of touch I am. You know what? Fuck that dude. I was a busboy and I didn't steal shit.

Speaker 2:          00:36:57       I fucking send them down. I walked out and I, the time it took me to walk to my car I said I'll fuck, can I turn back? And my table was clear and they had already sat down to other fucking emaciated fucks, you know, to eat some brown rice and beans. And uh, I go, I left my sunglasses and there can be camphor. Hey, I got the busboy cleared off the table, ask him. And he's just like, Yay. He say he didn't see him and then I was just like, yeah. Oh really? So I'm not going to get him back. Basically basically saying that he fucking swiped them. And then she's just like, no. Like they, people have found I iPads and they did. Yeah. Cause it's fucking big to fucking iPad. Ah. [inaudible] me off. You know something. I don't mind losing a pair of sunglasses in a steak house. You don't to use stereotypes. You expect somebody do that. Been a fucking Vegan restaurant. Is it supposed to be all like, hey man, like, no, I'm a stay, you know, happy Tuesday, man. This is the only Tuesday and [inaudible] right. That's supposed to be that vibe.

Speaker 5:          00:38:01       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:38:02       I just kept picturing some Douche out at a party wearing those fucking glasses, you know? And I had all these fucking Jason State them fantasies of how I action hero my way in to get my fucking sunglasses back. Except I have such a temper. Even in my fucking fantasies. I still punched him in the face, threw my glasses and broke them.

Speaker 2:          00:38:25       Huh? You want them there is do they are stuck in your fucking head. Not a piss me off. So anyway, so uh, so we go out to the beach and we're out. This is mall in Malibu, right? And it's just like the trophy wife fucking, it's, it's unreal. It's unreal. Like they are walking around in trophy wife, he know a trophy wife because she's, you know, she's still trying to look hot like well into a fifties she has kids. It's like you did it, you're married. Yeah, you have kids. Why are you still trying to look fuckable just look like a mom. It's great. Comfortable clothes given to it. But the thing is, is they don't have, they don't have like a, I think that they know that the second they let it slide, you know that, that they're going to get traded in or something.

Speaker 2:          00:39:17       I don't know what it is. They all looked least to me, you know. So anyway, so I went over there and bought a pair of [inaudible] sunglasses. Then it went to the god Damn Beach, kept my tee shirt on the whole fucking time. I just sat there putting on sunblock 50. Oh yeah. I also said, you know, should we get an umbrella? You want to get an umbrella? So like he can like sit in the shade. And I was like, no, I don't want it to, cause I don't want to see me even like more of a freak. Um, and then when I got there, there was a bunch of people with fucking umbrellas who actually had pigment and then I felt like an asshole and a

Speaker 5:          00:39:53       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:39:53       I Dunno. I ended up just walking down along the water and the water was fucking ice cold. And, uh, even when I get like knee deep in the ocean, I just think like, you know, what are these a fucking shark and just swims by and sees my white calf and it looks like a fucking drum stick. Like why would you go in this God damn thing? I, I literally don't fucking understand it on it. Like I guess I do because people surf every day, like the amount of people that surf the whole life and they never get bit by a shark. But this is the funny thing. They,

Speaker 2:          00:40:27       uh, there's not a surfer I've ever met that hasn't seen one. I talked to someone in Hawaii, right. And they will go on like a, I go, dude, don't nervous about sharks. They're like, well, I mean, you know, you try not to think about it. And I go, have you ever seen one? And she was just like, well yeah, I just kind of lie to myself and say it's a porpoise that maybe it's a porpoise. Like do you just see something big swim underneath you and you just fucking don't look at it? Look the way you don't look at as psycho on a subway train or whatever. I Dunno. I, I really, I honestly do not have the fucking balls for that. So, um, anyways, oh, guess what I rented this week. I rented a Chevy spark. Um, um, we're finally getting the downstairs fixed after all the water damage, you know, cause this fucking house is the money pit and a, so we're getting that shit fixed downstairs. So I have my car, my truck in the garage, and they got to bring all the shit in through the garage. So I to, you know, I didn't wanna leave my truck out on the street because I was afraid it was going to get stolen. So I had to put that in fucking storage.

Speaker 5:          00:41:41       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:41:42       And Nias working and shit. So now I had to go rent a car. So they said, what do you want us to let me get a mid sized car, whatever, fucking sedan. Perfect. So I show up down there and they did the crisis, like griswell moved to me where they bring out the family truckster and they basically like, well you're the Camry or whatever the fuck is still being washed or Corolla is what it was.

Speaker 5:          00:42:02       Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:42:03       but this one's already ready and I was late. I had to get the fuck out of there.

Speaker 5:          00:42:10       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:42:11       I already hated being there, so I say, fuck it. I'll take that little fucking car, dude. It is the worst hunk of shit.

Speaker 2:          00:42:17       You know, I don't, I don't get mad at cars for being what they are. If you're a little car and you're a great little car, I actually fucking love him. Like I like, you know, VW bugs in that type of shit. But this thing is so fucking underpowered just with one person in the car, if I put the AC on, it is literally screaming at like, I swear to God, like 4,000 rpms going up like the littlest inclined. But I got to tell you, having watched every episode of Fast and loud, that would be a fucking hilarious car to Redo a Chevy spark. If you somehow yanked that engine out and you could turbocharge a, maybe you could get a six in there and just put a fucking hurst shifter in there. I bet you could tip that fucking thing over and there would no, no way would that car not be one of the most fun cars you would ever drive because it would be like driving this fucking this turbo charge golf cart.

Speaker 2:          00:43:12       That's all I keep thinking about that. Can I just keep thinking of the potential of that thing? And that is the fucking disease of watching. And the great thing about watching those car shows is rather than just accepting your car for what it is, you start getting fucking ideas. Like, oh, what if I did this? What if I did that? Um, that's why I wanted somebody to paint my file cabinet, which by the way, I never even gave into, I finally just looked at it and I just hated the file cabinets so bad. I just, I gave it away to somebody. So it was a complete fucking loss. So when are you guys who've been asking me for pictures about my custom painted file cabinet? I ended up just giving it away and I felt great. I felt like a weight was taken off my chest. It was just something about it that was just so fucking depressing to look at. Um, I don't want to fucking file cabinet. That's one of the worst sounds ever. The opening and closing of a fucking file cabinet.

Speaker 5:          00:44:05       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:44:05       Have you ever heard that sound and Ben where you wanted to be?

Speaker 5:          00:44:10       You know,

Speaker 2:          00:44:12       it's just an awful sub. I remember that sound when I got my license back from drinking and driving when he opened it and fucking closed it and he as he was handing me the fucking license back this statey right as I went to grab it, he pulled it back away and he goes, wait, what was it for 45 days if for 90? And just gave me that last little fucking heart attack. Um, just to be a dick in a good way to teach me a fucking lesson. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:44:40       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:44:41       I, speaking of that, somebody told me you went on a Twitter to watch this

Speaker 2:          00:44:46       thing on, uh, on Netflix, on green berets. I don't even know if I rented the right one. There's a couple of them. The one that I rented was, uh, I dunno, some 11 weeks of hell or something to hang on a second. Let me see if I can find this shit. Oh, sorry. 11 weeks. Two weeks. Do you know what I said? 11 because of the two L's and health. I swear to God, the way my brain works, this is the only fucking job I could ever do. So this is a couple of, there's one national Gri of geographic special forces brought over this two weeks in hell. I was watching this thing they just showed the first couple of fucking days. I can tell you right now, there's no fucking way I could ever be a green baret. You lie to yourself having never been in the military that I could do that. You know, I put my fucking head down no fucking way.

Speaker 1:          00:45:32       Yes.

Speaker 2:          00:45:32       Go on Netflix and check that out. That's my youtube video of the week, except it's on Netflix. Watch two weeks of hell. I've only watched the first episode.

Speaker 1:          00:45:43       Okay

Speaker 2:          00:45:43       Dude, it's just fucking insane. The first day you're there, they have a thousand pound log that 12 guys grab.

Speaker 1:          00:45:51       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:45:51       And you're just sitting there bending over at the waist as you're holding it. Like you're going to do curls.

Speaker 1:          00:45:57       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:45:57       Up, down, up, down, up, down, up, down. Like my lower back would just, that would be hit. I would never walk right again. And then they have it on your shoulder and you got to pick it up over your head and then down and then, and they're sitting there going, move the lug around your head, not your head around the law, number one 67, what is your problem? They fucking going off on him. And uh, you do that for like a fucking hour. Then they just have you rolling on the ground from one side of the pit to the other. And if you too slow, other people roll over you and it's supposed to make you dizzy and disoriented. And when you puke, you have to get up and run out of the pit. There's no puking in the pit, but they know you're going to Puke, so you have to run out of the pit and Puke. If you puke in the pit, you have to pick the puke up and put it in your pockets and then get back on the ground to start rolling again.

Speaker 1:          00:46:52       And

Speaker 2:          00:46:54       even the people who are dropping like flies, I got to commend them for even less than an hour of that shit. You got to see it all right. If you think you're working out doing your insanity workout, go fuck yourself and watch this thing. It's the sick I and, and now I'm just on the second episode with it, just showing the teamwork. Oh my God. Do they have one thing? They, they're new mill in North Carolina and they call this thing like the star where you have these five points to make a star that you have to find using navigation and you can't use your light and you can't go on the roads and you're just walking through the fucking forest. And when come upon a river or a pond, you have to walk through the fucking thing. You can't go on a road and they bused all, you can't sleep.

Speaker 2:          00:47:37       They bus and they got these guys with these infrared goggles like Rambo hiding and catching all of these guys when they cheat and then you're out of the fucking program. Um, it's just like, I don't think I could go more than 18 seconds watching this thing without going. I'd quit there. I'd quit there. I would fail that. The only thing I thought I'd be halfway decent on is the a, the obstacle course because, uh, I do pull ups and climb a rope, but even then I do pull ups and climb a rope after eight hours sleep. And I had a nice bowl of oatmeal, you know, my wife gives me a kiss on the cheek and then I go down there and I do is I go and, you know, I do as many as I can until it starts to hurt. That hurts. And then I stopped.

Speaker 2:          00:48:31       Ah, Jesus. I thought I was way closer to being in Greenbrae than I actually am. I thought I was only, you know, 1 million miles away from it. I didn't realize I was light years away. So, uh, anybody listen to this, if you ever even attempted to become one if or if you are one or whatever you, if you have any fucking personal stories that you could send in about attempting that, uh, I don't know. The level of pain, whatever, what it's like to scoop up. You can put it in the fucking pockets. I Made Jesus Christ.

Speaker 2:          00:49:05       You know what's funny is those, you know, when you join a Frat, how they go, Hey, they have hell week and all that type of shit. Like anybody's a Greenbrae should be an honorary member member of every fraternity in the country because I know that those fucking what it, why can't I remember how long it is? I want to say two weeks. It is two weeks. I keep thinking 11 they're right there, dude, look at that. I have already fucked in the head before they actually deprived me of sleep. They asked this one guy, they go, how long have you been in here? And he said, Hash browns.

Speaker 2:          00:49:40       Okay. And this is the thing, he didn't take a head shot. It's not like a football player. They just had him pick a log up for a fucking hour, enroll around in the ground. And they asked him, they asked him something like that, like how you feeling? And he said, hashbrowns so I dunno Jesus Christ, if that doesn't make you want to watch it, I don't know what we'll all right, let's get on to the, um, the questions for the week. Uh, all right. Uh, no bends in Israel. Oh, Jesus. Did I make an ass of myself last week? Somebody sent me a letter last week. MMM. And the guy said, hi, my name is Ben and I'm from Israel. And I said, dude, there's no fucking Ben's in Israel. Like I thought that was more of an American name. And I've met a bunch of people from Israel and they always have these crazy fucking names. Most of them begin with a y, you know, you know, like these bad ass, like I know Israeli martial arts Moussad kind of fucking names, right? I never heard a Ben, Hey, my name's skippy. They just sound like a regular fucking name to me. So anyways, and I got corrected brutally in this fucking email here. Bill, you said on your four 28 14 podcasts that no one from Israel is named Ben Dude, they're prime minister is named Benjamin Netanyahu.

Speaker 2:          00:51:07       Their fucking president basically is named Benjamin. Well I probably didn't hear it cause they always say his whole name Benjamin Netanyahu. You know like you have think how many sports guys have really fucking awful names, but you never noticed it until they just say their first name. But if you hear though the whole name, I can't think of a name, but there's a couple of people that just have really fucking awful God damn names. Let me think. I don't know. I'll, I'll, I'll think of one. I won't think of one. I'll walk around and all of a sudden it'll just pop in my head. Maybe I'll bring it up next week, but yeah. All right. She got me number two solid info bill, except Ben is an name of Hebrew origin. It means son of the south or son of the right hand. Hold yourself a press conference.

Speaker 2:          00:51:54       I don't know what that means. Um, all I know is that it's an unbelievably arrogant name to name your kid, son of the right hand. I'm assuming of God, Jesus Christ. Where to give the kid a complex. The second he comes out of the womb, he's got to live up to that name. Why don't you go native American? You know, like he who sits with the hawks, you know you got to do is hang out with some fucking birds and your dad loves you. Um, number three. How about Ben Stiller? Your blockhead. What about them? I'm going to Google them right now. Why you acting like that guy's from? Is he from Israel? Now Jesus am I make it another fucking moron. I thought he from New York.

Speaker 2:          00:52:39       Ben Stiller born in Brooklyn. The fuck. I mean, I know. I'm German and Irish. My name is, and Wolfgang, you know I have, I have bill. I guess that's probably an English name. I had a fucking, now you know, go. You know something. This is what I don't like about this shit is listen, look at the way this dude calls me out. He can't just say, hey, you made a fucking honest mistake. Right? He goes, Bill, I know you're going to get a ton of me emails about this Ben thing because you're wrong is fuck great debating skills. Do you have a counterargument? Yeah, this guy's wrong is fuck. Uh, anyways, he goes, Bill. But I know you're going to admit you're wrong because that's what you do best. You're always ready to admit when you're wrong and that my friend means you're a trustworthy person. Oh, look at them now.

Speaker 2:          00:53:30       Now that he fucking called me a moron areas, he's bringing me back into this, this fucking a sadistic relationship. I'm sorry baby. I shouldn't have said those things about you. Come on, let me, let me go buy a burger. Um, anyways, he says a true sign of honesty. Uh, no sir. It isn't it, it just because somebody who's honest on a podcast doesn't mean they fucking walk around doing trust. I'll a complete piece of shit, but I appreciate it. Um, anyways, read this email after the others and realize I could be a great publicist if you need one, I'll be the Benicio del Toro to your Johnny Depp. Like in fear and loathing. I'll be a bit of a mess. You know some drugs and I don't know where this guy's going with this shit. I'm all right. Probiotics. Thank you for letting me know Sir Benjamin Netanyahu. I never noticed his first name was Ben. This just so many syllables in letters, like that's a name. Like you know when somebody drives by in a car and they try to yell some ad? Yeah, you just hear, yeah, that's like what that guy's name is Benjamin Netanyahu. How the fuck am I supposed to even notice Ben?

Speaker 2:          00:54:36       After you get to Jamon Netanyahu, it's fucking God. Like The Ben part. It's like being part of a part of a large family trying to get your story and at the dinner table I was getting who I fucked up. All right, bye. I have to be honest with you. Like, I, I forget Obama's first name a lot of the times because I don't pay attention to politics. And, uh, it's always like Obamacare. Oh, you know that boy who's just, what'd you give the vogue? Vrbo, are you surprised or Barb a lot? And they just keep saying Obama. Obama, Obama, nobody ever says is first fucking name.

Speaker 5:          00:55:10       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:55:11       I guess. Say we say Clinton, they said Bush. I Dunno.

Speaker 5:          00:55:17       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:55:18       I just sit there and think what the fuck is this guy's first name? That's how out of it I am. So if I don't even know my presence first name, Barack, or I've got to think about it.

Speaker 5:          00:55:27       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:55:27       Out of fuck, am I going to know Benjamin Netanyahu?

Speaker 5:          00:55:31       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:55:31       I can't stand looking at that part of the fucking world. Anyways, that's such a shit show over there. And the way that whole thing was fucking handled to right. A wrong with another wrong. And then the wrong becomes the, the, the, the, the so called right. Become the wrong. It's just the whole fucking thing is absolutely ridiculous.

Speaker 2:          00:55:49       They should just take everybody out of there. Palestinians and Jews. And he just fucking, I dunno, push the whole thing into the ocean and just why don't you guys go, go live in a place where you just just look at it like, oh, I like this street. You know, rather than tying all that stupid fucking religious horse shit into that part of the world. Well, this is where God, Jesus use the Porta potty. Eddie said, I love everybody, but I love you guys best, but whatever the fuck it is, everybody's the chosen one. You Punch your fucking babies. That's the dumbest shit ever. Yeah, I'll probably get a bunch of emails on that, but I, I really feel that, like, I swear to God, if I was part of either one of those groups, I would just be like, oh, you know what? I'm fucking, I'm going to move to Rhode Island. I'm going to get the fuck outta here. Fuck this. You want it? It's yours. Go ahead. It gives a fuck. Sit. They're dealing with is Hatfield and McCoys shift for the rest of my God damn life. I want to go, I want to go ride a boogie board.

Speaker 2:          00:56:57       I want to take a cooking class. I don't want to fucking deal with this shit, you know, I don't know. It's like I got burned out in that Yankees red sox should after. Well the while he just like you. Yeah. And I did reduce it to that. It's fucking childish. There you go. The guy who didn't know that Benjamin was in Israelis name is telling that entire part of the world to grow up after the fan base of the team. He loves drop the n word this week. How's that? You like that? How's that for you guys at a nice big bullet? Hypocrisy for you? Well, get used to it. Um, oh by the way, last night I came home and I was an absolute fucking saint. My wife was sitting down and she was watching that guy there, um, who, who basically he has all the real housewives get on the show and then he just stokes the flames to get them arguing. And it was the Nini leaks group of people. And I sat there and didn't say a fucking word and it might have been some of the meanest, most horrific shit. Um, I, I've ever heard people say to each other and they all just look tired.

Speaker 2:          00:58:12       They just look spent there. These ugly fucking looks on their faces and they would just say in all of this hurtful shit to each other, and I didn't say a fucking word. I usually go, how can you watch this shit? You know, I thought you were a feminist. How can you watch this shit? This is like depicting women. Like they can't even get along for five seconds and a, I didn't say shit last night and actually Nia came in afterwards and was like, I had to shut that off. I actually had physical reactions trying to watch it. The, some of the meanest shit I've ever heard anybody say to each other. And I think I'm done with that show. So there's one for the guys out there, just stop complaint, just sit there in silence. If you just sit there in silence and let those women's voices, you know, why should he say those women? Just say those people, cause I'm not trying to make it a female thing. I, one of them said to the other one, I mean dude, it was like, it was be on a roast, it would've got grown. This woman's trying to get pregnant using a sperm donor.

Speaker 1:          00:59:24       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:59:24       And this woman was saying like, you have to do that because you don't have a man. So now some guy who wants $10 to go buy a pizza is now going to go jerk off into a cup and you don't know if you're going to have a serial killer or a child molester for a baby because you don't have a man. And then she said something Sassy after that. Like, uh, you know, I dunno, I dunno, I'm not up on SAS, you know, put that in your checkbook and fucking cash it in or whatever the fuck, what the fuck she said. But it was, it was just like, and you just saw the fucking hurt on the other woman's face. Like she almost, and then another woman who also doesn't like that woman like laughed. It was fucking, it was fucking brutal. I mean, I mean, look, fucking comedians that I've hung out with from Patrice O'Neal, rest his soul to Keith Robinson, those two alone and rich vos like some of this shit that they said like this, like paled in comparison. Jesus fucking Christ. It was brutal, but I didn't say a fucking word. I Dunno. I was in the zone. I didn't say anything. I just sat there and I was looking at a drum magazine and it was occasionally look up and I didn't say a fucking word. And then finally

Speaker 2:          01:00:55       everything that I wanted her to think about the show finally happen, I think because I finally shut the fuck up and she could actually listen to it. Or maybe they truly just went way too far. Um,

Speaker 2:          01:01:08       she said she was done with that show. So now I have this hope that if I just shut the fuck up during all of these reality shows where it's a bunch of fucking people, men and women just yelling at each other, that she'll finally stop watching them and then start watching sports. I know that's not going to happen, but I can, I can fucking dream. Right? I can have a dream. All right. You know what my dream is right now is to read these next three ads without making too many fucking mistakes. Okay? All right. Dollar Shave club, everybody.

This product can help restore the normal balance. Park has been used for vaginal urinary track infections. Some diet supplement products have been forced to contain. Wait a minute, some diet supplement products have been forced to contain possibly harmful impurities. Additives, check with your pharmacist for more details regarding the particular brand use. Also, it's pretty much straight up. You just gotta make sure you don't get a bad one. The FDA has not reviewed this product for safety or effectiveness. Consults your pharmacist for more details. Well, there you go sir. Wait, when was this written? May 5th, 2014.

Speaker 2:          01:09:37       Um, I ride, I get it. Don't you know I'm not going to fucking pick it up after this

Speaker 2:          01:09:42       fucking 15 rings. All right. Thanks for no music. That's funny. Thanks for no music. And then there was some music right there. Thanks for no music, Billy. Boy, I'm so fucking glad that your podcast doesn't start with music. Now that I said that the next one probably will. I don't enjoy it. When podcasts tried to go pro and slick it all up to look real, a rigid fuck that just shut up and talk. I say, all right, well I'm not doing that because I'm trying to be a purist. I got into this business because I didn't want to have a job, so I don't edit these. I just sit down. I talk for the most part. I don't have guests, although I did a special one. Uh, last week I did an extra one with the head director, Steven Brill of the movie walk of shame that I have a [inaudible] now that you have passed the first test, it is now time to start your lug training. Sorry. That just sounds like the music and every fucking awesome karate movie that you watch and it makes you want to get in shape and start punching would then you realize it hurts the quit. Um, all right.

Speaker 7:          01:10:51       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:10:51       Oh yeah. So I had Steven bro come in and he was talking about the movie I've got to do last year with a Ethan to play and a Elizabeth Banks. Um, and it came out and that people set a bunch of Nice stuff. I guess they liked the work that I didn't, they said I was funny. Thank God and I appreciate that. So, uh, if you get a chance, you got some money to spend at checkout, walk of shame. And if you don't want to go to the movies because you have a great year own entertainment system, you can actually download it off iTunes immediately. It's the new way they're going to do movies, which I think is brilliant. It makes me want to upgrade my system at home. Fucking perfect download. It's like six bucks or something like that. Costs you less money. You don't have to go anywhere.

Speaker 2:          01:11:32       Pop it in. Support the podcast, my career and the friends I worked with. Come on. Do we solid Cinco de Mayo. Everybody watch walk of shame. All right. Here's the next one. Balding at 19 Dear Bill Emoji. I don't know what that means. Did I say it right? You guys just just tripped me up right and left this week. First I'd like to apologize for my English. Dude. You're fucking English is amazing already. I know. I can't say first I'd like to apologize for my French and I've been working on this shit for over a month. It's Spanish. I can't even, I suck at it. You'll tango Pero Pero I say it right now. Fuck it. I think first I'd like to apologize for my English. Since it's not my native language. I hope this won't give you difficulties reading out loud because that would really make the podcast lose its momentum.

Speaker 2:          01:12:26       You being sarcastic. This happens every week. Um, anyway. I am a 19 year old male and I'm balding. For a long time I hadn't noticed because I had longer hair. When I recently got my haircut, I discovered my hair had started thinning a long time ago. How the fuck do I deal with this? Girls will often call me attractive, but I know I'm not attractive in a very masculine way, so buzzing. It would hardly make me feel like a bad ass. I probably have a Dick shaped skull hiding under my thinning main anyways. Oh. Anyways, so that would make me look extra ridiculous. Besides that, I feel like I'm at an age when my hair is still a big part of my identity and losing it feels like Lou and losing it feels like losing it away. Oh, it feels like losing a way to express myself in some way. Losing hair at a young age like this feels like a one way ticket to mediocrity. Always being one step behind the rest. For the rest of my life. What's your advice on this since you don't exactly have your axle rose Maine anymore either.

Speaker 2:          01:13:33       Thanks for the podcast. I love just showing Amsterdam. Oh, well thanks for coming out. I'd love to going to Amsterdam. It was a privilege to come to your country and do my little fucking dance. Um, all right. Uh, your fucking feelings are natural. Especially at 19 when I first figured out I was losing my hair and my early thirties, I freaked the fuck out. I couldn't believe it. Like, how could this happen to me? I was like, Nancy Kerrigan. I just said,

Speaker 8:          01:14:01       Dan will go, why, why, why?

Speaker 2:          01:14:07       And then, uh, as I always do, I just fucking go. All this is the situation. I can either sit here and act like a fucking bitch or I cannot try to find the positive. And I was just like, I, I always, this is what I always try to do. I just look for people who are in my situation or worse that succeeded. And that's how I think about, I immediately just looked at fucking guys like Ed Harris, Woody Harrelson. I'm like, they're still leads in movies and still crushing it and getting nominated for. So, you know, if I want to let it stop me, it will, um, who gives a fuck? Uh, why you got a whole bunch of options now? You know, you can even try and fight it or you can just say fuck it like I did. Um, you know, I've just fine just giving it to, I just find a given into it is way fucking easier.

Speaker 2:          01:15:03       It's just easier to just like, all right, well I guess I'm going to be that guy. I'll be the friend in the movie. I won't be the lead. So who gives a fuck? You know, he's still in the movie. I know you don't do that for fucking living. Okay. First of all I would say, but as far as like buzzing your head like you have no idea what you had looked. So I can tell you do it and you might as well fucking do it. It's a fucking, it's great having a shaved head. Um, I would fucking just see what it looks like and maybe it looks cool. And then the, here's the deal, if you, if you bald young, this is how you catch up is if you keep, if you stay in shape, because most people, um, it's an absolute shit show by the time that 35, my balding at 19.

Speaker 2:          01:15:45       Yeah, that's gonna fucking suck. But this is the thing you like women really respect confidence and if you carry yourself and you just make jokes about you fucking hairline, you have a sense of humor about it. Like there's something about it that, I dunno, women really respond to that. I mean other guys will still break your balls or whatever, but like they just fucking respond to it because it's a great character trait that you're, you're, you have a sense of humor about it. You're, you're dealing with, you know, some form of adversity. You're not being a pussy and letting it drag it down. Like, oh my God, it's making me start to think that it's actually serious. I never get phone calls. BOMP bomp bomp bomp bomp bomp bomp bomp bomp bomp if I have a host of late night fucking, I can read your mind shell. This is going to be the music.

Speaker 7:          01:16:38       Okay?

Speaker 2:          01:16:39       I look all mysterious and I'll have like eyeliner. Um, yeah. Your whole thing. Like I feel like it's a one way ticket to mediocrity. Uh, the one way ticket to mediocrity is believing that you're on the road to a one way ticket to mediocrity. Um, you know, fortunately, uh, women are way more forgiving of physical flaws then guys are, um, so dude, you're 19 years old. Uh, just stay in shape and go out and crush it. Talk Shit. Fucking hit on women that are allegedly way out of your league. Just swing for the fucking fences and do the same thing with as far as whatever dream you have as far as the, your dream job. Just absolutely swing out of your fucking shoes every time you get an at bat. And you know, honestly, dude, if you fucking hairlines going to stop you, I mean, Jesus Christ.

Speaker 2:          01:17:33       Okay? You better than that. You're better than that comment. You're over there in Europe. You probably can speak more than one language. There's no fucking reason. Hairline or no hairline that you shouldn't be out there just fucking crushing it. And if you don't, you have no one to blame but yourself. And I'm not being hard on you. I'm just letting you know that you have all the power. You hold your fucking destiny in your hand. All right? And they go, and here's the upside. You're only 19. By the time you fucking 30. God knows what they'll have. If you want to have a comeback, you know, that's what I'm doing. I'm a hold it out by the time I'm like fucking 60, they're going to have the cure, but by then who gives a fuck? I'm 60 and then I think it will actually be cool. It's like, it's like having a civil war, fucking facial hair, except you not, if you're not a fucking hipster, you actually fought in the civil war. I'll be that bald guy. I'll be the last one. Um, yeah. I recently just buzzed my head down and I, I grew it back out. I busted initially and then I got an acting work and they wanted me to grow it out a little bit. And then the next couple of years I kept it

Speaker 2:          01:18:41       and um, yeah, so you lose you. Hey, just like what is the fucking point of this shit? Keep going to get a haircut and paying for a full fucking haircut. This is bullshit. These people, that dog in it, there's not enough up there. So

Speaker 2:          01:18:55       he just buzz it down and it's just, I don't know. I like it. I, especially in the business I am, I am 100% of the v of the viewpoint of not thinking what do they want more coming with. This is what I look like and I get it. If you don't want to cast me, you know, how am I going to, I'm never going to know. It's because of my hairline. I'm never going, they're not going to call me about Jews to let you know. I'm just going to think I didn't get the fucking park. But you know, you just keep looking at, you fucking look in. Either they hire you, you don't fuck up. But at the end of the day, the word, if say I never get another acting job because of that, then all I do is tell jokes in theaters for the rest of my fucking life. I mean I won. So fuck it. And how did I win Sir? Cause I went after my dream, my dream job too. So that's what the fuck you should do. And as you get older, I'm telling you the big thing is not going to be your hair. It's going to be that you don't have man tits. You don't have like

Speaker 2:          01:19:55       you body does it look like the aftermath of a fucking mud slide. That is something that they're, you know, you need literally, I dunno, I don't know how you make a comeback

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       from that. It gets to the point where it's so fucking stretched out. Oh and I'll make it fat. People feel bad. I mean they have operations for that, which looked better than hair plugs. I'm just saying what happened to just fucking don't come at me with that negative shit that made me sad to read that, that you feel that shit about yourself. All right, fucking, you know, go have some probiotics and do some pushups. You'll be fine. You'll be fine. All right. There you go. All right. My New Lady,

Speaker 2:          01:20:35       my new lady. Hey bill birth. I have a major problem. My New Lady of about three months has opened a can of worms on me. We're both in our mid thirties. Never been married and have no kids. Uh, you know, I don't know why that just remind me of a joke in my act that I wanted to do that it had to do with watching women doing floor exercises at the gym to write this down. Floor exercises and there you go. I'm done writing the joke. That's how I write people. I'll write that and I'll write it on a cocktail Napkin and I looked down and it will say floor exercises and then I'll tell the story and then it'll probably bomb. But there'll be a couple rays of light that I will walk towards. And that's how it works. You liked that? That was inside the comedy studio. I'm sorry, I gotta Stop Smoking cigars. I got two more left to more Cubans from overseas and then I am done. I'm done. I can't let them go to waste. So I'm going to finish him in his fucking done and I'm not going to smoke for a long time. I made the decision this morning when I woke up and my fucking mouth tastes like an ashtray. And I also find when you have a bunch of Cuban cigars and he just starts smoking them all the time, you don't, they don't taste as good anymore. They just tastes like a cigar. So it's like having steak every night. So

Speaker 2:          01:21:49       I need to fuck off with that because it's a really bad habit. All right. Having said that, I just bought a humor door yesterday. Ah, Jesus. Bill, if I can pick a sentence fence. All right. My New Lady. Um, all right. We're both in our mid thirties and never been married and have no kids. Uh, she's bright, sexy, funny, and quite wealthy. I love her. Uh, she comes from an Irish American descent and her first name is, am I going to say what her first name is? Uh, no problem. So as far,

Speaker 1:          01:22:19       yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:22:20       Okay. No problem so far you say true. However, two weeks ago we were enjoying each other's company having sex over there and my new lady whispered.

Speaker 1:          01:22:31       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:22:32       Oh No.

Speaker 1:          01:22:34       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:22:35       Oh my God. Oh Jesus. All right, you guys at work right now? You guys at work? Turn this up a little bit cause you're not going to want to miss this. Okay? Turn around, look around your cubicle. Make sure the boss isn't coming. Turn your raw open for business. Sign to close. All right. I usually don't name names and I got a name the name. Okay. Her name is Bernadette. Okay. And I'm only saying that because this is pivotal. She goes, however, two weeks ago we were enjoying each other's company and my new lady whispered basically during sex that bur B e r short for Bernadette.

Speaker 1:          01:23:18       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:23:18       Would like it up the ass. That's what she said. [inaudible] would like it up the ass. Oh wait, did you think of me then? Oh No. That's hilarious. Oh Shit. He goes delighted with the opportunity. I assumed the position and an awful thoughts suddenly struck me. Burger is for now. It's the same.

Speaker 1:          01:23:42       Yes.

Speaker 2:          01:23:43       The bar at my problems began. Oh No, you didn't have a performance problem, did you? He goes, I can only picture your redheaded freckled face looking over a shoulder that at me. I tried mushing her face into the pillow. Bowman in my mind all I could hear your muffle Bostonian Twang shouting, go fuck yourself. This is killing me now. And it's stuck in my head. Every time we get friendly or anytime I call, I call her [inaudible]. Your face pops in my mind. I'm going crazy. What can, can you suggest? Should I just dumper? Go Fuck Yourself. Oh God,

Speaker 1:          01:24:20       yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:24:21       You ruined my name for me. What do you do? First of all, stop listening to my comedy and my podcast immediately cold Turkey. And then second of all, I guess you got to fucking decide.

Speaker 1:          01:24:38       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:24:40       I, this is what I would say. Two. I say, listen, you've got to stop referring to yourself. Is that name? I would just be honest with it. Listen, I gotta tell you something. All right.

Speaker 1:          01:24:50       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:24:50       You don't, when you said bird would like it up the ass,

Speaker 1:          01:24:55       like

Speaker 2:          01:24:58       it is good to tell the fucking story. Oh my God. That's the creepiest fucking email I've ever read. Jesus Christ. Dude, I really feel bad for you, but it's also fucking funny as hell. I'm sorry I'm wrong. Ruining your sex life. Um, yeah, man. You got to stop listening to the podcast.

Speaker 2:          01:25:25       I don't know what that would do. Oh my God. Do you know what that reminded me of one time? Uh, you have a day that you have a data or go out with a girl that has the same first name as your mother. I mean, any, it doesn't, you've the first thing when you're younger, you go, oh, she has the same name as my mom. Maybe this is meant to be, you know, I loved my mother. Maybe I'll love this woman. Maybe she's the one, and then the first time you having sex and you go to say their name, it's just like, it's over. It's fucking over.

Speaker 1:          01:25:56       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:25:57       So, uh, I don't know what to tell you, dude. Jesus Christ. If I knew I don't read these things before I fucking look at these things. If I knew that one was coming, I would have closed on that one. I don't know how to, how do you follow that one? You know what? I'll tell you how you follow it with an email. Trans gender athletes. Uh, hey Billy beer belly. Ah, I fucking hate how fucking true that is. I'm a lady listener on your podcast. Ah, thank God a woman wrote in Jesus, I wish you guys would do that more often to try to balance this out. He goes, I'm a lady listener of your podcast and think your opinions are often really honest and truthful. Why do I sense an a fucking uppercut coming? So I was hoping, hoping you could give your opinion on something. All right. She said, I just started getting really interested in Trans Rights transgender athletes. Right, okay. And have become a major advocate for the lovely people that ended up having to fight such a difficult uphill battle. Um, I am definitely convinced that trans people, why does she, why does she have like a fucking Asterik next to it?

Speaker 2:          01:27:06       Trans people really should be allowed to be the gender they identify with, identify as without discrimination. But the issue is still hard for me to grasp is that of trans athletes competing in professional sports. It seemed like it could be unfortunate. It seems like it could unfortunately be an unfair advantage for the Trans woman. Meaning they were born with male genitalia, but identify as a woman because of their extra testosterone and bigger build. I am really conflicted on the issue and wonder what you think. Yeah, I definitely, yeah. There was a while ago, there was a dude who wanted to be a woman, became a woman and he was a professional tennis player and he just started crushing it on the female, like whatever. He was ranked as a guy. He was ranked way higher. And uh, yeah, I don't think that that's fair.

Speaker 6:          01:27:58       MMM.

Speaker 2:          01:28:00       But there's not enough of them to start their own league. So I don't know what you do. Maybe they should start their own. Um, why don't they start their own like NFL or something transgender NFL.

Speaker 6:          01:28:14       Is that bad?

Speaker 2:          01:28:16       I don't understand. Like the women's started w NBA one don't they started trend. That's that. Maybe that's the solution. You got the, I have a dick and always had one and want to continue having one. And then you have the, I have a VAD, I'm happy with it. You have both those leagues and then you could have another leak. You know, I'm a seeker. That'd be a good name for a team. Write the fucking Omaha seekers. Why not? And I think the biggest problem with the league was figuring out when to air it so you could get some TV time now then you just have the fucking transgendered. Oprah. You don't start his, her own fucking network. I mean it's just, it's just fucking sitting there. I think the big problem that a lot of people make is they try to go, uh, when you doing something that different is you try to, you're so hooked on the main stream,

Speaker 2:          01:29:17       Mike, I want to be accepted. The way somebody who isn't transgender is accepted, like walking around. That should be the deal. But like there's actually something to be said for being, uh, you know, to not be in mainstream. I mean, there's a bunch of bands that aren't mainstream that have this underground following that make a really good living. I mean, I'll make an a great living as a comedian. I don't have a fucking TV show. Never had one, you know, so I guess why, you know, you could, you could start, you could start your own shit and then if you start your own shit and you own it, like Dana White, I dunno, that's how I was looking at shit. I never look at it like, Hey, let's join the thing that already exists. It already exists. So shit is set in stone. The fuck overs are already in there.

Speaker 2:          01:30:06       And the people getting paid, I mean you gotta you gotta you know, he got to spill some blood now that try to fucking change it or he could just start your own shit. Right? Like the AFL, who knows? One day he gets so successful they try to buy out. I Dunno. Anyways, where am I going here? A Mam MMA fighter. Fallon Fox is an example of a trans woman who is trying to compete professionally. If you want a reference. Oh yeah, yeah. See now that's the kind of thing, I mean that that is like an unfair advantage. I mean, you know, you're removing all right the dude's Dick, but not as shoulders. That is kind of fucked up then. Cause then it, it's like a dickless dude is beating the shit out of a woman. Ask Him. But it's not like a domestic violence. It's a fight. I don't know. And I, and I would say every woman in the m m m m m a I can say this with confidence could kick my ass with ease. Um, so maybe it isn't, I don't fucking know.

Speaker 2:          01:31:21       I don't know what else. It's, you know what it is? It's brand new. So we got to fucking throw them in the mix and see how it all settles. They go kind of copped out on that one. I don't have any fucking solutions. Sometimes. I think you guys asked me this shit just as fucking watch me talk myself into a God damn corner. So there you go. It's an hour and 31 fucking minute podcast. I don't know how that happened, but somewhere in there I tried to solve the problems in Israel and transgender sports and uh, and then there was that other email. Jesus. All right, that's the end of this podcast. Everybody, uh, if you'd like to contribute to the, you can always go to a billboard.com and you can click on the podcast page and if you want to buy something on Amazon, click on the Amazon banner will take you right there.

Speaker 2:          01:32:09       Buy something on Amazon and they'll kick me a link for driving traffic to this site. Uh, that is it. I'm going to be in San Diego this weekend. We just added this date. As I'm getting ready for my a standup special. I will give you the city. Um, cause it looks like it might have changed. It might not have changed. I don't know. Shit is kind of up in the air, but the, the first couple of weeks of June, it's going down and we might, I might have ticket information by the end of this. Uh, this, uh, this week. So look for it on Twitter and on Facebook. All right, that's it. Go Fuck Yourself. I'll talk to you next week. Bye. Bye.
