Goose Gossage use when he was still on the fucking Oakland A's Rawlings Oh no sorry the correct answer was a Wilson douchebag family with the chance to steal.

Speaker 4:          00:03:05       I actually did.

Speaker 5:          00:03:07       You know if I can remember the category my problem with those shows is sometimes like I don't understand the they'll say like Get Carter and it takes like me like fucking three in a row to understand like oh these are everybody's got the last thing Carter I've got the hardest one too.

Speaker 4:          00:03:25       Or maybe I'm just the oldest they brought up the fuckin dude on Michigan. Then I think went to the fucking USFL make this fucking Anthony car number one. I first started watching college football he was the man out there with the Wolverines All right.

Speaker 6:          00:03:41       Bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah. That Doug a great fuckin fight songs of all time the Michigan Wolverines dat dat dat dat dat dat dat.

Speaker 7:          00:03:52       I'm fucking with you. I know where it goes. Hail to figurative value. And I was singing the Notre Dame song Oh Jesus this team made Oh Jesus. They're gone for a two point conversion there.

Speaker 8:          00:04:06       Jesus. But you gotta say well you know I mean they make. They make it.

Speaker 9:          00:04:11       I mean I love everybody get out of this fucking locker room you bearded hippie. That's what happened of Jesus came back. Jesus ever went to the locker room and Newt Rockne was in there right. Oh five foot nothing of them considered fucking average height. Way back in the day before they put the horse tranquilizers in the fucking horse meat that they fed to the horses that they then fed to the cows. Right. That then in my burger.

Speaker 4:          00:04:39       Maybe that's why I have such a fucking disposition. I eat a lot of red meat. There's so much red meat I I don't consider hamburger red meat to me red meat as I had a steak. I have a burger I mean it's it's it's not it's not red after I'm done cooking it.

Speaker 5:          00:04:57       No actually it's not even true. I like I like all of it medium rare and what I've been told by a cool life freaks where they're like look you can have a steak medium rare. That's a lot less of a risk because that's just one cup. You know you're rolling the dice it's like you're bang one hooker without wearing a glove. Jesus Bill right. And then hamburger though it's like a bank Vietnam.

Speaker 10:         00:05:24       Line pig Vietnam.

Speaker 9:          00:05:26       For some reason I went to fuckin full metal jacket Hey baby you gotta go for Vietnam. It's like you banged a fuckin country at that. That's what hamburger is because it's just a bunch of cows all fucking mulched together. Right. You have a steak it's like you just fucked one cow.

Speaker 2:          00:05:43       That's what I'm trying to steer I should say. What's the stare. Well it's a bull without his balls buddy. Right. Take off its fucking horns. I don't know what it is anyways and if you have hamburger that's like you know you know you're just Freddie Mercury running around fucking the whole free world.

Speaker 5:          00:06:02       Isn't that basically it. I mean I'm not you know I'm not I don't know my way around the kitchen enough to know if that analogy worked or not but I will say that I. Let's just get back to the original point okay.

Speaker 11:         00:06:16       What was the original point. Yeah. I don't consider hamburger red meat. Or was it that I'm not given some fucking kid who lives in a chimney. I don't know why a chimney. You know.

Speaker 7:          00:06:26       You know seeing broke children is always sad unless they're white. There's just something fucking funny about you know I think it's just a relief as a white person that the guilt goes away. You don't know.

Speaker 12:         00:06:37       You know anytime you see somebody from another race broke you know white people fucking pushed them out they put a Wal-Mart down right. They put one of those derricks in there they started sucking all the fuckin shit out of it.

Speaker 9:          00:06:49       You know I wonder if people around the world when they watched the beginning of the Beverly Hillbillies start crying you know when they just see the white man even THEY FIRST THEY LAUGH LIKE OH MY GOD IT'S toothless broke white people hilarious and even they discover oil and they get to keep it.

Speaker 7:          00:07:06       So they loaded up the drug and moved to Beverly Hills that is.

Speaker 13:         00:07:13       I wonder if they cry when the children cry. You know nobody gets the movie I was talking about.

Speaker 4:          00:07:21       I kept references. We had problems with the family back east.

Speaker 13:         00:07:27       Anyway speaking of the children and cry that's from white line everybody.

Speaker 9:          00:07:33       When the children cry was actually a hit. That's how fucking off the rails music went.

Speaker 14:         00:07:38       At one point little jab jab. Yay. Yay yay yay.

Speaker 10:         00:07:47       Now it's like on the top 10. I remember watching it.

Speaker 15:         00:07:50       I didn't give a fuck about that song but I was like that lead guitarist of all these fucking guys trying to be Eddie Van Halen.

Speaker 12:         00:07:57       I'm not saying this guy was trying to do the shit that Eddie did. That fucking guy white line.

Speaker 15:         00:08:02       He came the closest you know out of all the white bands you know the white lines the fucking know who else was it was white lion Great White who's white snake it was Hey there Whitey.

Speaker 4:          00:08:17       It was a little known all white funk band because that's what people used to yell when they would say I care about how cos I don't know. Anyway speaking of children crying my condolences to all the fans of the Washington Capitals. And you know what happens when you hit the fucking wall for the third time when you win the president's trophy. You know under two different presidents OK.

Speaker 7:          00:08:44       When Obama brings you to it Donald Trump comes in with his tie hanging all the way down to his tie would still touch the ground even if he was wearing skates. He goes walking into a locker room and he gives you that fuckin trophy.

Speaker 12:         00:08:59       Yeah you're on your second goddamn president you've left the ugliest uniforms in the history of the fucking game a hockey possibly definitely up there. Those blue ones with that gold fucking eagle.

Speaker 4:          00:09:14       You know it just looked like they put a stamp like them like the post office had a limited stamp thing you know. Then all those weird fuckin smelly people you know people don't bathe collect stamps you know and I'm not saying that you know with all this stuff like what do you identify with a man or a women you know being a man. I don't I am a man but I don't identify. Stone identify when he mentioned the fucking emptiness of that every day waking up shave going What the fuck is this. I can't relate to this fucking beard on my face man.

Speaker 16:         00:09:52       You know when am I tits gonna come in. I just I can't imagine that but whenever there's other people that can't you know they don't identify with other human beings. Forget about they don't identify with their own gender. There's another group of people that we all need to care about and wear a certain color on a certain day or maybe a ribbon for. And these are people that can identify with other people they just can't identify with human beings in general and these people collect stamps you know they just sit in their room they're not bothering anybody taken that big giant fucking book off that shelf. You know blowing the dust off it.

Speaker 4:          00:10:32       Because they finally got the Washington Capitals fucking horrific jersey from the mid to early 2000s whenever they had that it was an awful period. That's why in the NHL they added too many fucking teams and everybody changed their uniforms I should put it all on the capitals Washington D.C. fucking horrific. Thank God they went back to the red white and blue. You know.

Speaker 12:         00:10:57       I mean you are there in DC for fuck's sake. You know if anybody shed the color of the flags should be you guys.

Speaker 4:          00:11:03       You know the Buffalo Sabres. That fucking HL horse shit they had you know where they put a sheep on the front even a bull anymore I was terrible fucking terrible.

Speaker 12:         00:11:17       Props to them by the way when they finally admitted that they made a fucking mess there was such a horrible period they had that strike that they lost a whole season of the NHL All right.

Speaker 4:          00:11:27       They added a bunch of fucking teams too many goddamn teams they had the Atlanta Thrashers they had the fucking Florida Marlins right.

Speaker 9:          00:11:37       That's right. They played hockey first before they suck so bad they were like you know let's just fucking play baseball. Now if the Florida Panthers.

Speaker 12:         00:11:45       The lightning the Coyotes I think the North Stars moved down to become the stars at least they kept the kind of air there all right.

Speaker 17:         00:11:54       Because they kept the same fucking uniforms and of course they knocked down that stadium in Minnesota. They put up the Mall of America they're. So sad. You know the place where Dina's sister really smashed his stick over that fucking guy's head. You can now sit there standing there eating frozen yogurt without a care in the world. You know. It was that road game.

Speaker 18:         00:12:19       Anyways the fuck am I talking about.

Speaker 12:         00:12:24       That's right.

Speaker 16:         00:12:24       So then you had all these new teams in the NHL and then on top of that all these teams that had been established all changed their fucking uniforms. So you come back after the strike and you just watch and like Dude is this the fucking Olympics. Well actually that's not true because after they started doing that in the 90s. Because when the Sabres the Sabres got fucked in 1999.

Speaker 17:         00:12:49       You know back when you could even have a fucking shoelace tough like fucking shoe leather that would sort out huh. Who knows that one. There's another obscure tough like fucking shoe leather that mozzarella. Woods around. Whatever the fuck you said mozzarella. Who knows that. If you're religious you might know that that's a hint. The title has something religious a religious figure in it. And it's not Jesus Christ Superstar. That's the last hint I'm gonna give you. The other savers got fucking nineteen ninety nine. Was it Brett Hall. Was it fuckin.

Speaker 5:          00:13:27       Danny mash Byrne I don't know who the fuck it was. Joe Berry Carol who had their foot in the fucking crease I can't remember but the whole year they're calling it until the biggest goal of the year the one that decides the Stanley Cup Classic NHL yeah their new rule that's been fucking everybody all year round.

Speaker 19:         00:13:41       Yeah forget it.

Speaker 9:          00:13:42       We've decided to change the rule in overtime in the clinching game of the Stanley Cup playoffs. That's how we do it. That's right. That's how we do it. We take breaks every 20 minutes and we have rules and all of a sudden the rules go away. So anyways my condolences to the city to the District of Columbia capital fans. Man they fuck identity again.

Speaker 5:          00:14:07       You know and you keep showing up because you're real fans and yeah it's gonna suck now they're gonna dismantle the entire fucking team. Hopefully they keep a Vatican.

Speaker 4:          00:14:14       You guys are out of your fuckin minds if you get rid him are they gonna blame it all on him. Did you see that picture of his leg. I'll fuckin bruised up he looks like somebody's trying to get information out of him. He wouldn't give it up you know. Fuckin veins sticking out.

Speaker 5:          00:14:33       I thought his crane in there. Jesus Christ. I feel like a bad Dabney is in there okay. He is handling it. Don't worry. Can you hear that. Yeah. This is the time a night like she's so like wants to know everything that's going on that she does. She won't nap enough during the day and by the way fuck all your suggestions.

Speaker 19:         00:14:53       I don't wanna hear a million suggestions put one of her shirts in in the bath and that we've tried everything OK.

Speaker 5:          00:14:59       It's just you know it's a phase she's going through and I am done listening to fucking people who are not wearing lab coats. If you're not a lab coat on and you don't have a fucking little degree hanging on a wall behind you just keep your fucking ideas to yourself OK.

Speaker 2:          00:15:17       The level of shit that parents talk every fucking one of them has a goddamn cure for every fucking thing that happens every one of them just glided through fucking being a parent. I've figured it all out and for some stupid reason they didn't cash in on it and write a book. Why would you do that when you can just show up to somebodies house and vomit all your fucking ideas on. If any of your people's fuckin ideas work you should put it in a book and go on the Oprah channel and you guys can sit there holding each other's fucking hands as she tells you how amazing you are said it.

Speaker 11:         00:15:52       Come on over here boring me with it and then I go and try it. You know actually you know what the shirt one worked the shirt when did work.

Speaker 20:         00:15:59       I will say that I should have fucking said that because a relative suggested to me and it was fucking great. That's just the first thing that popped in my head. I was actually thinking about somebody else that annoyed the shit out of me was something else trying to feed my kids solid food. Three months into her life.

Speaker 21:         00:16:15       No it's fine it's fine.

Speaker 2:          00:16:22       This is this is the danger riffing because you end up shitting on the person you're not upset with anyways plowing ahead. Where am I. Oh yeah. Condolences. You know so I would definitely keep Ovechkin you've got to build around the guy build around the guy again and you know get a coach with a neck and you know you know maybe you can see if something was offsides or not and you can you could throw the flag or whatever you do to challenge it instead of sitting there with his spine fused.

Speaker 16:         00:16:52       Somebody made the joke said that every coach in the NFL in the NHL looks like a Bond villain.

Speaker 22:         00:16:58       And it is true. I got to go with that. You know what I mean. Although I would say that Claude Julien Claude Julien looks like that that dude in the swamp thing that when he got turned into a monster became that little guy running around such a weird fuckin movie where I don't even remember the name of the movie the whole thing about the movie was there was this chick and she had these giant fucking tits and you just waiting for it to go into the lake.

Speaker 20:         00:17:29       So they'd show a little side boob. Now this is the early 80s. That was a big fucking thing when you were like 12 years old.

Speaker 4:          00:17:36       All right.

Speaker 5:          00:17:37       So the deal with the Swamp Thing which is where I got that thing I had problems with the family back east that's that's where it's from. It's from the swamp thing. I'm obviously fucking with you.

Speaker 12:         00:17:50       When I talk about the swamp thing. Right. So how that worked. He was. He was I forget what hand the guy was walking near a swamp. You know the usual thing and then a telephone pole falls into the fuckin swamp he gets electrocuted and then he becomes the Swamp Thing and he's as strong as shit and there's some fuckin bad guy. So they figure out how he became the Swamp Thing so then the bad guy wants. He wants a Swamp Thing of an army a swamp thing. So whatever he can take over all those swamps. I don't I don't remember. Right. So. This fucking little weaselly dude he does the same thing and when he turns into a monster he's as little as fuckin weaselly monster. So then the bad guy goes well how come we didn't turn into what you are and it says well you know when you get electrocuted in the swamp and you turn into a swamp thing it just enhances your personality.

Speaker 15:         00:18:41       All right. So if you're a fuckin stud like me who even know I look like a swamp thing I could still bang that big tits whore over there in the lake. If you're a little weaselly can't you just become an ugly weaselly cunt with like mud and leaves for skin.

Speaker 7:          00:18:55       There you go people I. And I can't think of a bet sorry just blew out your is there. I can't think of a better time to read a little bit of advertising. What do you say there. What do you say then. What do we got here.

And then he goes you know it'd be great if your tits were a little bit bigger right and then she starts redoing herself like Matt Damon in the Liberace movie and then one day just gets rid of her.

Because it's very few people out there that defend the man all right. Anybody can attack the man every once in a while it takes a fucking fucking I don't know the internet version of that Clint Eastwood spaghetti western guy coming to town with his little fucking Mike Tyson's colorful Mike Tyson towel over his fucking head right. That's all broke Mike Tyson was when he was a boy he first started up.

Speaker 11:         00:29:56       He was like I want to dress like Clint Eastwood they said Oh we'll get you his underwear his boots and we'll get that little fucking that little shawl he puts over it but you know we can't afford to put any color on it you know and that's the kind of thing that lead you to bite somebody's ear off. I'm just saying I'm not trying to say that what he did was right but I'm just saying I understand.

Speaker 13:         00:30:19       Hey how you doing up there in Montreal everybody Montreal Canada. How's things going up there. Enjoying the fucking off season. God knows you're gonna have enough time to come and see me in June.

Speaker 11:         00:30:31       This is what I'm loving about the predators. All right. Although they seem like they're losing right now. I'm taping the game but I'll fuck I'll fuck myself over here and I'll just look it up right now. Oh look at that the little time trial I think you're going to fuckin load for me.

Speaker 4:          00:30:45       I think the ducks were up 5 to 2 or 5 to 3 how fucking weird Are these playoffs this year.

Speaker 25:         00:30:52       You know. Anyways you know I always give you guys shit about the curse of Patrick wow you humiliated that guy. I mean what you guys did to him when you watched like like horror movies. You know what I mean when somebody like you know thinks they're prom queen and then you dump a bunch of blood on them or they think that they're gonna go make a wish in a well and then their mother pushes him to the bottom of it. Yeah I mean they think that you know that that all of that shit. All of that shit right. Somebody drowns in a fucking lake. You guys did the hockey version of that to Patrick what. You know. He thought you guys loved him. That's what it was like Kerry. He came out there you know has one fucking bad game you won't pull him.

Speaker 3:          00:31:40       You'll leave him in there you fucking do a mock cheer when this guy who redefined the position first ballot Hall of Famer continuing the tradition of winning fuckin Stanley Cups.

Speaker 4:          00:31:54       You know when he won it during the real era when there was like 30 fucking teams 28 teams not all those cups the Canadians and Maple Leafs won back in the day when it was him the state was like a fucking shot glass. Seems skate around with the thing looks like a fucking baton. You know before it became that giant god damn thing.

Speaker 26:         00:32:16       Anyways they booed him out of town. So ever since then there's been the curse of Patrick White. And I think the next fucking part the next chapter of the curse. Okay is P.K. Sue Bowen. You know. You know what they they ran him out of Falconetti ran that guy out of town. Now this wasn't your fans. I think it was the organization. I also think it's because I'm a Bruins fan. I just love giving you guys shit because when I'm gone I do talk about championships you guys are gonna destroy me. So this is this little fucking little thorn I can put in the underneath your fuckin elephant foot here. All right.

Speaker 25:         00:32:50       What P.K. was a fucking great dude and he gave too much money that children's hospital he started becoming bigger than the Canadians and the Canadians couldn't fucking handle it. Like when Kobe couldn't handle Shaq and he said looky there he goes awry go. And they said OK Kobe and they sent Shaq to Miami and then he won a fucking title there right. Then they had to bring Phil Jackson back and another fifty fucking free agents.

Speaker 26:         00:33:19       As they always fucking do. You know I you know I just give Kobe shit for the first the first three rings Get the fuck out. The last two I'll give you those. You know even with the officiating and that second time you played this Celtics Hey let's call fucking 38 fouls on one team in 17 on the other. That's that makes for a good game 7 doesn't it. Not saying that we would've won but it would've been nice to see the Lakers beat the salt except you're just saying anyways plowing ahead so now the predators are up 1 did nothing against the fucking Emilio Estevez as the Sheens whenever the fucking column down there.

Speaker 4:          00:33:52       The mighty the mighty Sheens the Anaheim s devils is the mighty ducks. I don't like the ducks I don't like ducks I.

Speaker 22:         00:34:04       Don't give a fuck. I just don't like them. Okay I don't like the Honda Center. OK I you go there there's no fucking vibe there's no vibe in Anaheim it's just a fucking it's just I don't know what it is. It's just a strange god damn place. Anaheim is fucking weird his whole fucking L.A. areas weird like people weren't supposed to live here.

Speaker 11:         00:34:28       You don't know me. They weren't supposed to fucking live here it's a fucking desert we still water. Hold all things weird but at least you know this is cool shit to look at. You know except when you go to Anaheim I don't know what you look at. All right. And you go down there there's no fuckin vibe. Maybe it's better. I went to a ducks game in the late 90s. They were still early right. They were still the Mighty Ducks they still had Donald Duck with the broken bill on the front isn't what they had for their logo. I don't know. So anyways what if what if what if. P.K. leads the Nashville Predators.

Speaker 17:         00:35:02       To a Stanley Cup championship this year I'm just throwing that out there for everybody up there and St. Catherine Street with your cute little pocket squares that matches the color of your socks.

Speaker 4:          00:35:11       You know what the fuck are you going to do that Nashville that banjo playing fuckin washboard down by the fucking river. Ever been to Nashville. I mean have the structures there still have dirt floors. It's unforgettable. It's ridiculous. You know like when they went this day when they went to Nashville this year.

Speaker 2:          00:35:37       And they were like you know who you voted for for president. They were like I'll tell you one thing I blanking.

Speaker 4:          00:35:45       You aren't afraid to fly.

Speaker 15:         00:35:48       That's how backward naturalists you know I know there's all this shit out there saying it's this growing city you know and they're trying to get people to move there. The reason why they're trying to do that is because so many of the structures still have dirt floors.

Speaker 4:          00:36:00       Okay now if he can go down there right and and fucking lead them to the Stanley Cup the big boy Stanley Cup and have their little shot glass that you want you would fucking Toronto one like fucking 15 times each. You know. I'll give the Canadians their last 10 cups but I look at them like I came to say they're equal Detroit because Detroit was back then when it was a shock less.

Speaker 17:         00:36:23       You know sort of fancy shot glass.

Speaker 25:         00:36:27       Anyways I'm just fucking with you.

Speaker 27:         00:36:30       I have no idea how the fuckin predators were in the finals the Western Conference finals with the ducks and then the Ottawa Senators. What the fuck is going on with that when it when is when is the glass slipper going to turn back into a fucking punkin. I'm telling you. If Ottawa goes any deeper into the playoffs they're actually going to sell out a home game.

Speaker 3:          00:36:51       Midseason believe. Did you see the first game of the Rangers they had two thousand of the Rangers three they had two thousand empty seats. That's because they stopped playing the Bruins. You know what I mean. And the Bruins were just close enough to Ottawa that that shuttle flight wasn't it wasn't too expensive you know. Then they played the Rangers and God knows Rangers fans.

Speaker 13:         00:37:12       All those fuckin Manhattan cunts. They got the money to fly up to Ottawa. But then New Yorkers. Do what. Why would they get bored. They got a slice of cheese.

Speaker 28:         00:37:22       Why would I travel.

Speaker 29:         00:37:26       Look over there at the Empire State Building. Oh. That's what New Yorkers are there. They're fucking they like country people.

Speaker 30:         00:37:37       You don't have to be lonely fucking Skanks in the fucking five boroughs.

Speaker 16:         00:37:45       I am in an extra country mood and I am just trashing people that I have no right to trash. OK. My team is not in the playoffs.

Speaker 7:          00:37:53       Ok my team has not won as many championships as the fucking Canadians. My city doesn't have as many skyscrapers in New York City. They don't fuck with my city. You just fuck with the wrong city. I probably would barely back east.

Speaker 4:          00:38:08       If you touch my family I'll fucking kill you. Those lines will never get old in Hollywood.

Speaker 15:         00:38:15       You know it's another fucking hacky thing. I'm so sick of every other fucking show doing this speed dating fuckin scene.

Speaker 12:         00:38:22       How many times can you do that in one fucking lunatic after an Emmy.

Speaker 31:         00:38:27       It's not that bad.

Speaker 2:          00:38:30       Jesus fucking Christ people showing up with like half an axe in their side of their head. People live with their mother the person who's actually gay pretending to be straight to fucking say me mean Eddie Murphy did this shit fucking and then coming to America in 1989. Jesus Christ why do you just have somebody come in and slip on a banana peel and then get a pie in their face and then do the dating thing. Hey Bill you so talented won't you come up with something new. Because I limit it. All right. I never said I fucking would reinvent something. All right unfortunately I have to take a little bit of break and I'm on a nice little roll here. I'm on a nice little roll here but I have a go I get some I gotta take care. Which is why I'm doing this at 9 o'clock on a Sunday.

Speaker 9:          00:39:15       But why do I need to tell you guys because it's going to be a fucking second of your life.

Speaker 4:          00:39:20       All right hang on hang on a moment.

Speaker 2:          00:39:24       OK I'm back. I'm back and I am as illiterate as ever. You want to this is somebody just fuckin tearing me a new one here. So I was talking about fucking United Airlines and Delta and then just yanking people off of flights and like what happened to customer service. And all of this type. You know I felt guilty flying United the way they just drag that Chinese dude off the plane to go into China just as so many was Chinese Asian. Give me that right. Who knows. Who knows. I'm so fucking hard I don't know.

Speaker 26:         00:40:00       You know fucking fuck me anyways. Airline bumping he said. He says hey you uninformed cunt. Well I'll tell you. Nothing makes the reader want to read more when you just start off with the insults he said Congress and the passengers bill of rights have led to more passengers getting bumped due to more cancellations.

Speaker 32:         00:40:24       And do you think he gives any examples. Now he just moves on to his next point. Also if people showed up for the flights they booked the airlines wouldn't be overbooked. Many passengers book multiple flights. How about if you buy. So you're just assuming that the guys that are yanking off the flights to those people. I don't do that. I buy one fucking ticket nice show up. That's how I do it. So you're telling me that that Chinese dude or that other fucking person on Delta you're telling me that that those are those people so they say you book like 20 flight she only showed up for one day.

Speaker 31:         00:41:03       Get out of fuck I said get out of there. You're telling me that's what happened. Or are you telling me that because other people do that.

Speaker 32:         00:41:12       Because the guilty people did it that United and Delta is now just going to grab some random innocent person and throw them off the fuckin flight. I heard the reason why they did it was because they had another plane that they had to get a flight crew to and they just fucking yanked the guy off. That has nothing to do with that other shit. As far as I know. But I hate what am I am just an uninformed cunt. Evidently you who just like me just make statements with no fucking evidence behind it. All right. Plowing ahead he goes. How about if I buy a ticket for a flight and miss it for whatever reason you lose it. Question mark.

Speaker 19:         00:41:51       Is that how you run your shows.

Speaker 3:          00:41:54       Was that a point. How about if I buy a ticket for a flight and miss it for whatever reason. Karma you lose it.

Speaker 27:         00:42:04       Oh how about if you have a problem with that.

Speaker 19:         00:42:07       I don't have a fucking problem with that at all. I'm on the same page. I hate when I show up on time for the security line and somebody else shows up super late and then they get rewarded and get breezed through the fucking line like they're in that team like they're part of the TSA party they're the pre check people. You're bringing up all this other shit that has nothing to do with a fucking just somebody who bought a ticket and sits on the plane.

Speaker 27:         00:42:31       I drive a car. Other people steal cars should I be yanked out of my fucking car because other people are stealing cars. This makes no sense.

Speaker 2:          00:42:42       I might be an uninformed cunt but you are a pompous arrogant uninformed cunt. I could say that because I'm in show business. You know we're all down to earth. Alright let me read some more of your air quote points. All right. Is that I. Is that how you run your shows.

Speaker 27:         00:43:00       No I don't run my shows like that. You know this is my fault. Here's how I run my fucking show. I don't have anybody kicked out ever. You can be the biggest Conte ever. I kicked the first fuckin person out in 10 years. Because he was so fucking drunk I'm a hell of a guy. I don't give a fuck.

Speaker 2:          00:43:17       I'm a great guy when it comes to that shit how dare you love me and with United Airlines and Delta. Ew ew ew ew hateful so and so. All right. Let me please finish this point here. Is that how you run your shows.

Speaker 32:         00:43:30       Or if someone buys a ticket to your show and misses it due to traffic leaving the house late etc. Do you honor their ticket to the next show. I will tell you this I've had plenty of people fuck and reach out to me and I have hooked plenty of people up with tickets.

Speaker 4:          00:43:45       OK how about that. Has everyone reached out to me has ever seen every fucking email.

Speaker 32:         00:43:53       No but I hope people up. I've run into fucking people walking down the street drive by a occasional Fuck you. To go to show.

Speaker 27:         00:44:02       And I'm like it's all soda faggot fucker. What's your name. I've done that countless times. So there you go sir. I don't know you talking about all the equipment to that is I fucking pull up and stand outside the gates of the airport.

Speaker 2:          00:44:15       Hey you guys flying in Minneapolis.

Speaker 33:         00:44:18       Yes sir we are. Could I. Can I buy a ticket. Sorry. It's all sold out.

Speaker 13:         00:44:26       Berman I don't worry about it. Don't worry we'll get you on the plane and then they fucking yank someone that they yank somebody off. I don't know why they picked the Asian guy.

Speaker 18:         00:44:39       Huh.

Speaker 2:          00:44:42       Why couldn't they pick some fuckin white dude in a suit. You know why. You know why. All right. Leave the house late in the game. Well that is what the airlines do if you miss a flight. They put you on another one. So fuck off you non reading pigment impaired that's not what they do.

Speaker 27:         00:44:59       That's what they do sometimes. Other times they yank you off the plane. Other times it Taylor go fuck yourself. Other times they say hey you have to win a thousand miles you can't use them when you want to use them.

Speaker 2:          00:45:14       And if you don't use them by next Wednesday we're taking them all back other times they say hey which is charging extra because it's post 9/11 we lost all this money which is charging for food but eventually will fuckin stop overcharge and we'll stop charging for this shit for all the money that we lost in 9/11 which you know we're now going to pass on to our fucking customers.

Speaker 27:         00:45:35       So they take the hit one was fucking 9/11. I know I'm an uninformed cunt as far as my calculation were coming up on the 16th anniversary this September. You're still paying for Pringles aren't you.

Speaker 4:          00:45:49       Sir I'm all for defending the fuckin man. When it's when it's for I mean I don't I don't know what you just fucking. You just brought up a bunch of.

Speaker 32:         00:45:58       I guess behavior by frequent flyer people so then evidently I should get yanked off a plane at some point because other people overbook and shit you don't you you're the kind of person that probably likes that Dad. Well they call it a trap ride. The trick car whatever that fucking show is you probably like that show. You probably think that that's a good fucking show right. That show I came to believe that fucking show is on television. It's on Tru TV. We should change the name the fucking horrific TV they fucking think they drive down to like the fucking projects and they leave a car with the door open keys in it running and then they wait for someone to fucking steal it and then they act like they've got a bad guy off the fucking street.

Speaker 31:         00:46:44       And I was reading comments underneath that you know I love it they're going to go out of their fuckin way. To go down there and try to get someone to go to jail what do you go down there and try to help somebody out. I saw one guy.

Speaker 2:          00:46:57       He actually stole the fucking car. He knew it was the trap car whatever he's driving with the door open because he knows that they just like the big fucking hit the locks he can't get out. And he's saying he knows his strap carries waving to the camera all that. They ask if he knows a trap car why did you do it he said I don't know maybe I just want to get on TV and then he laughed and everybody's like that goes crazy. I want wanna party with that guy. That guy's a dope or anything. It was it was to me it was fucking depressing. Like that. That's the level of options this guy has in his fucking life. He would do something like that. Somebody else brought up a great point. OK. Like why don't they take that car around the fuckin suburbs to the White cul de sacs why don't they do that.

Speaker 24:         00:47:35       Maybe a book will go.

Speaker 31:         00:47:37       Kids don't steal the fuck they don't. They absolutely do and I'll tell you there's a point my fucking life. I would have done that.

Speaker 2:          00:47:44       I absolutely would have done that just for this stupid fucking just to have the story so I could talk about it loudly around chicks that I liked because I didn't know any other way to approach him. If they ever did that in a fucking suburb in a bunch of white kids started going to jail over that shit that shit would not would be entrapment. It wouldn't be held up in court and the fucking show would be shut down. All I'm saying. Okay. You sir. You probably like that type of shit you probably like that show.

Speaker 12:         00:48:12       You think that's a good show and hey let's let's you know rather than giving this guy an opportunity you know they could just as easily controlled TV have a fucking show where they go down and they try to give somebody a fucking job.

Speaker 4:          00:48:23       You know.

Speaker 3:          00:48:27       Anyways plowing ahead making your own baby food a Billy burp. Had my first kid a couple years ago. Congratulations. A friend suggested we make our own baby food because it's easier to get them to transition to real and healthy foods. We tried it and it was fun. Friends suggest that we make our own baby food because it's easier to get them to transition. Okay all right. We could hey there's another fun guy. No lab coat no degree. We couldn't do it 100 percent of the time but was totally worth it. My kid isn't that picky of an eater and I like to think think that days of pulverizing fruits vegetables and oats into tasty meals. Oh it's because of that. I'm sure you can afford the good stuff for the little lady but just thought I'd throw it out there. Thanks.

Speaker 11:         00:49:14       Go fuck yourself. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know what to tell you. I'll cross that fucking robotic everybody is always like you got all these goddamn suggestions it was somebody fucking you know everybody talking about like private schools versus public schools. It's like these fucking kids they only get to be kids anymore.

Speaker 26:         00:49:34       They should be fucking you know this whole fucking thing that you know from day one like it gets gotta be like you've seen what it does in these countries that and push their kids too hard.

Speaker 2:          00:49:48       They have like all serrated fucking balls like they've been working on fucking Wall Street for 60 goddamn years and in like 7. The level of stress that they put on I'm fucked that my kid's going to be a goddamn kid. All right I flunked everything fucking in high school I fucked up everything I got a restaurant drinking and driving. I was unloading trucks I did all of this shit. Then one day I just figure out what the fuck do I what do I want to do. I found a passion and I followed it and I was fine. And I remember back in the day they used to fuck all you need two years of the language if you know to use of a fucking language you can't level it's all fucking bull you know it's to say that the fucking language teacher fuck everybody fuck everybody like you could be a god damn kid and fuck all these fucking private schools within nine zillion dollar fucking you know.

Speaker 5:          00:50:37       Oh you better get in when the kids are just playing with blocks the early you get in the better chance you have your kid to continue on.

Speaker 22:         00:50:45       In other words start fucking line in our pockets now. Yeah why don't you just have no. Won't it be cheaper to just have your kid homeschooled. Drop all that fucking cash like he's already going to Yale. And then fucking going to school then go on the wheels on the bus go round and round round there and that'll be enough.

Speaker 23:         00:51:06       Yeah. The credit card didn't work. Yeah I can't teach the rest of the song All right.

Speaker 34:         00:51:10       Birthday boat party. A bill. Your bald headed eagle.

Speaker 23:         00:51:17       Jesus. Going fucking old school on that one. Hey you Chesler. Hey yes Sidewinder. Recently my girlfriend dumped me over a text message.

Speaker 5:          00:51:31       I swear to God if that if that existed back in the day I would I would fucking be lighting phones up if that wasn't bad enough.

Speaker 23:         00:51:37       I got the text just as I was walking into a movie with a buddy. She told me straight that she didn't love me anymore. I took it like a man watched the movie went home and cried like a bitch. An honest guy. Two days later I went to a party on a boat. I spotted my now ex. We made eye contact and she looked away. So now I'm trapped on a boat for four hours. You didn't know that she was gonna be there with a bunch of drunk cunts. I don't want to be around and of course her I made an attempt to ask her why the fuck she had the balls to dump me face to face but she ignored me totally. She's young and immature. I then saw her walk over to a guy and start kissing him. Jesus Christ. I commend you sir for not throwing yourself in them. Also overboard a fucking double murder slash suicide Bill I have no fucking idea I didn't punch this cunt but I decided not to. I now wish I had punched his stupid fucking face and my question is what should I have should I have done something fucked now.

Speaker 13:         00:52:42       Why are you punching him. He's doing what he's supposed to be doing. He's supposed to be out there trying to fucking a couple women.

Speaker 23:         00:52:50       All right. Any bad feeling you have should be towards her. But here's the thing dude. You know in the long run she did you a favor because she didn't love you okay.

Speaker 5:          00:53:00       And eventually she could have done that while you had two kids with her and you actually had to pay her fucking money. She did you a favor all right. Yeah. Don't ever do that. That's the dumbest shit ever when people fucking date somebody and then they get dumped and then they're fucking dating somebody else. I mean and then you go over and you confront the other fucking party.

Speaker 4:          00:53:20       They're outside the circle. You know so what should he have done. You should just been a fucking gentleman. That's what you should've done.

Speaker 25:         00:53:32       You just be a fucking gentleman just feel like you know evidently you know she doesn't want to be with me anymore. I mean dude I know this and I got dumped I know fucking hard this is a one time. I actually fucking was talking to somebody hard on the table this woman dumped me out of fucking nowhere and I'm in a bar of course and I'm talking to a buddy of mine and.

Speaker 5:          00:53:54       The problem was he got dumped like 4 years earlier and he still wasn't over it and he fucking hated women. So this is one point my heart out to and as you know I mean I thought everything was going fine with the fight and I did all that shit and he just goes hey you know I don't know maybe she want to fuck somebody else.

Speaker 26:         00:54:14       And I just said you know what. I said you know fuck you I actually flipped out like Fuck you you. That has nothing to fucking do with this. That has to do with that fucking shit that fucking cunt you dated for fucking years ago. He is still not over and I've been having a fucking carry you off the field like Kellen Winslow after that fucking overtime game for lack of every fucking bar for less for you. You can't sit there. He's like Do Alonso's egg of fuck off.

Speaker 4:          00:54:39       That's just part of a bad memory.

Speaker 16:         00:54:45       Actually did I say that. That's what I said on the way home. I think I said that on the way home. I think I just said fuck you when I walked out of the bar. That's right. That's what happened. That's how old I am. I'm so old. My memories the fantasy that.

Speaker 35:         00:55:03       My memory is what I should have said.

Speaker 2:          00:55:06       I didn't say Fuck you and I walked down as a guy and I just fuckin walked out. One of the few times I didn't pay for my round of beers I was just like Fuck you walked out. Anyways she said Hope you're well thanks and go fuck yourself. Do you took it like a man. What are you gonna do. And.

Speaker 23:         00:55:26       You know keep taking it like a man and keep going home and private and cry it out here. That's what women do. Fucking. They cry it out of them and then they can move on the fact that she dumped you and then of course is immediately making out with this guy is really suspect but you never know with them.

Speaker 4:          00:55:43       You never know.

Speaker 32:         00:55:44       That could've just. She could've just picked that guy.

Speaker 5:          00:55:49       Because you were there. You have no fucking idea. And here's the thing dude even if she was already banging that fuckin douche while making out with that douche when she was with you then that's the. That's who you were with. So good fucking riddance. All right. That's what you had. You thought you drafted somebody in the first round that didn't fucking work out. And you know what that guy just picked up her contract for you you know. So now you've got all this cap space. All right go crier out of your fucking heart you know. But don't go around hating women. That's what I did. Big fucking mistake. All that does is stop you from meeting the fuckin sweetheart because you know who loves an angry woman hater a fuckin psycho chick. All right there you go. All right. Russian girlfriend a belly blue balls.

Speaker 16:         00:56:38       Hey man I was. Hey man I was wondering if you could give me some advice. I'm a 27 year old from New Zealand and current resident and current Jesus and current currently residing is what you should say instead of current residing here. Current resident here current residing here. Okay I've met and recently started dating a girl from Russia. We've been officially dating for about five months now. Everything is going great. Never been happier if she ever asked you to take a boat ride. Don't get on the fuckin boat all right. And I'm not talking about because of the last thing. All right this when you show up does a couple of the shifty guys there and then your identity gets stolen and we never see you again. All right. She's hot. Best in bed I've ever had and I've had a lot haha.

Speaker 9:          00:57:25       Got a great personality and someone I could see going further into the future with. Okay well you're writing me so I know the other shoe is going to drop. The only issue is that our visa is about to run out in a few months before she moves back. Unless we can she can find a decent job here. The only issue with that. Is the job market over here for the type of work she is after is very small. A translator. We've been checking the job sites and whatnot over the past month with not much luck.

Speaker 25:         00:58:02       So I've put up the idea of maybe heading over to Russia and trying to start a life over there. Oh no. Fuck no.

Speaker 9:          00:58:12       But that's a great way to see if she's with you because she wants to be with you. My qualification can take me anywhere in the world but I'm still skeptical on most I just uplift my whole life and move to a country that doesn't really speak much English apparently with my girlfriend that I've only known for a few months plus not knowing much Russia. Yeah. Plus you don't know how that country fucking works.

Speaker 4:          00:58:38       All right. You have no idea how that fucking country works dude. You're talking like you're dealing with the fuckin mob. Hang on one second. All right sorry. I just realized I double booked myself and a fucking Vegas somehow. Yeah. Dude you have no idea what's going on over there like. That's a whole different fucking animal over there. That's a whole different government. The level of influence that the mob has. I mean that shit is fucking hardcore over there. Russia is no joke. What the fuck did you say you were coming from. You've gone from New Zealand to Russia. You give the Guard name. Fuck that dude. Fuck that. Fuck that fuck that. Get her a job interview they'll see how beautiful she is and you know that. You know do what you can fucking do. To fuck that. Fuck that.

Speaker 2:          00:59:34       Repeat fuck that. I mean I don't know and I've been reading the rest of this. Fuck that do not move from fucking New Zealand to Russia. Jesus fucking Christ.

Speaker 4:          00:59:48       Do not do that please don't do that. OK. I never beg in the podcast but I'm begging you right now do not fucking do that. Jesus. You can go from the fuckin Garden of Eden to that now you're the immigrant. Now she's trying to get you a fucking job. You know kind of money you're gonna make over there. I'm gonna fuckin IDF. Fuck that. All right.

Speaker 9:          01:00:10       Soccer coach rips off shirt after rejection. Hey Billy dad SEC. That was as original as Billy bald eagle was. Not that I saw this video and thought it might interest you during a recent soccer game an Argentinean player accidentally knocks a player out from the other team and ends up getting ejected from the game as a result after he gets ejected the coach freaks out. Yeah I watch the clip starts yelling at the refs. Then he gets ejected. So when he realizes that he's also ejected he rips his shirt off only to reveal he's an older guy too you know. I don't know. I can't tell older guys somewhere between 40 and 50 rips his shirt off only to reveal that not only is this dude fucking shredded but also his whole back is covered in tattoos. Making him look like he spends his free time going to bare knuckle brawling down by the shipyard. Thanks for all the laughs and go fuck yourself. Yeah. I watched the clip of this. This guy looks like. This guy looks like he's done some time in prison.

Speaker 12:         01:01:23       What's amazing is the rest of his body that you can see he has no tattoos.

Speaker 5:          01:01:27       And then on the back it's just like I don't know what the fuck he's got going on but his entire back is covered and it's all of those you know. You know if he touch my family I will fucking kill you. It's those kinds of tattoos. It's not the I was in a frat and I got drunk one night and. All right this is my old girlfriend's name and we fucking turned it into a swan or whatever the fuck they do.

Speaker 10:         01:01:50       This is like hardcore you know this guy is gonna punch you in the throat.

Speaker 9:          01:01:57       It's a great clip. I really appreciate it. And then make sure I did everything here. Russian girlfriend Do not stay in New Zealand. Birthday boat party. Yep you got a lot of cap space. Good for you. Making your own baby food. Yes you know I'll I'll see about that airline bumping a. Agree to disagree but I like the fact that you went out there and stuck up for the airlines and I think that said it and all the things right.

Speaker 4:          01:02:22       Oh I didn't talk about the F1 race mother fucker did you guys watch it have a guy now I know after knee is just absolutely eviscerated watching racing I hope you if you were gonna watch a race the Spanish Grand Prix was a great one.

Speaker 5:          01:02:36       Lewis Hamilton had the pole. Sebastian Vettel I think was yeah it was in the second position and then Boris Karloff. Well if I can't keep forgetting his name fucking Lewis Hamilton's driving make their his fucking car caught on fire. But the first guy the other guy drives for Ferrari whatever fucking his whatever his name is Ricky Ricardo. I can't remember. No. Daniel Carl drives for Force India.

Speaker 4:          01:03:04       No he doesn't he drives for Red Bull. Why don't I just fucking go on and look up the goddamn names because most guys don't watch this shit see you don't you don't know what you guys know as much as I fucking know. So here's what happened. All right. The race starts and.

Speaker 9:          01:03:22       What's his face. Lewis Hamilton as always gets a bad fuckin start. Sebastian Vettel goes around a battle drives the Ferrari. Lewis Hamilton's with Mercedes Vettel is out in front ramming fuckin points he was ahead he was like 15 points ahead of some shit and in the old days last year when I was on watch for a year. The old days which is Monaco of last year when I started watching if you would if you went to the turn first everyone got it got through the first turn first in first place drove in and clean air that was it you won the fucking race unless you messed up a pit stop or you your car shit the bed so he gets out in front and then his jizz his buddy there. The other Ferrari guy gets knocked out of the race OK and they fuck him.

Speaker 4:          01:04:12       They cut to this kid in the stands wearing this Ferrari thing where are the drivers why is it so difficult. Drivers Here we go here we go. I should add this already to go I'm sorry the bike slowing this the fuck down the Reagan and guy gets knocked right out of the race and this little fucking kid they cut to him he's wearing all Ferrari gear and he's just crying his eyes out and they're sitting there going well like.

Speaker 2:          01:04:38       Vettel still in first place. Well he must have been a big Reagan fan over the fuck you say his name and they shot him twice bawling his eyes out I could be the kid. This little was that into racing. That was really cool.

Speaker 11:         01:04:51       And later on the driver got knocked out of the race Ferrari they actually they brought the kid in. He took a picture with them and everything so it had been a good deal although he probably cried again when Lewis Hamilton went around him.

Speaker 22:         01:05:02       But anyways it was a great race from front to back. These new fucking tires I guess I have no idea why they got more gripped as more passing. Lewis Hamilton past. Sebastian Vettel I think on like lap. Lanes like 20 laps to go which never happened last year. The second place guy just could never get around the first place. Guy once he was out there.

Speaker 5:          01:05:30       I don't know. It was a great race and then Lewis Hamilton for some reason was like fucking out of breath when he was talking as I was saying because they got the fatter tires they could pull more GS in like just physically what the fuck they were going through. And Lewis Hamilton didn't have any drinks on board. I didn't know they had drinks on board. I'd never even dawned on me but he didn't want to add any more weight to his car so he lost like four and a half pounds.

Speaker 11:         01:05:52       So there you go. You know that actually you know this people out here in Hollywood that have enough money now that the day before they have to go to like a red carpet event they're gonna fucking you know drive around in a fuckin race car. For three hours so they can drop that final fucking four and a half pounds I'm telling you it's gonna happen. So I believe the next next races in Monaco I don't know I'm enjoying watching it now has got me all self-conscious about talking about it now. When I blame her then I wasn't prepared to talk about it. Was there anything else. I made my little list here. Those you nerds always wanted do you read the whole thing. Pretty much pretty much. But I make like a setlist a shit and want to talk to if I can fucking find it.

Speaker 4:          01:06:38       How is it I give up. I FUCKING GIVE UP WITH THIS SHIT. WHAT DID I have on you. I don't know what that is.

Speaker 11:         01:06:46       We'll close this window. This is the most anticlimactic ending to a podcast ever. All right.

Speaker 9:          01:06:51       I said predators Lewis and Hamilton. Sebastian Vettel. Daniel Ricardo first time he was on a podium this year. Oh he had to give a shout out to force India still rock in the future whatever colour that is. I think that was it. Oh happy Mother's Day belated Mother's Day to all the mothers out there at a great time went to brunch.

Speaker 5:          01:07:14       Yep that's where I am right now went to brunch. My parents came out met their granddaughter there over there over the moon love and she was so cute and was just didn't cried all the whole meal and then she got in the car and then that was it. She friggin had it and was just crying up a storm.

Speaker 4:          01:07:32       And but it was it we ended up having a great day and it came home and I was like it was crazy you know I've just finally entered this part of my life. You know my parents are older. I got a little one. I made brunch and I have no say in the matter.

Speaker 10:         01:07:49       And you know what it feels good.

Speaker 20:         01:07:50       I had a great time. You know we had all kinds of family and a big crew seven or eight people and we went to this fucking insane brunch and everybody threw down and had like 3000 calories each.

Speaker 36:         01:08:11       And other than the fact that I forgot my fuckin wallet because I decided to wear a suit and I was going to be the big shot picking up the fucking cheque and I had to go to my parents. So now now you know when a few days I take it to the airport I gotta give him the fucking money back. But OK. It was embarrassing really embarrassing.
