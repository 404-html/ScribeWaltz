Speaker 1:          00:01          Hey, what's going on? It's bill burr and a, it's time for the Thursday afternoon, Monday morning podcast just before Friday. And Ah,

Speaker 1:          00:16          what's going on? How are you just checking on you? You having a good week? Huh? You getting along with people and they driving you nuts? Do you got somebody that you're not talking to? I am not talking to that person. Huh? What a fucking waste to energy that you know, many times in my fucking life I've been involved with not talking to somebody. How much fucking effort it takes to not look at somebody that you're not talking to in a goddamn room. You know, so fucking weird to know somebody. No, they were in a room and not fucking talk to the, you can't even focus on the person you're talking to. It's weird. Cause if they were a complete stranger, you wouldn't even notice them. Let's they add a nice rare or if you're an ass man like me, they've got a nice ass, you know, you do that thing where you kind of law, you know, you look at around him, like act like you're stretching. Um,

Speaker 1:          01:09          so anyway, so what's going on with you guys? You know, it's Thursday, Thursday. Lighten up. Lighten up. Just, just, just fucking, uh, you know, smooth out the, uh, the bridges there. Whenever you build the bridges, whatever the fuck you say, just walk up to somebody. Say, listen, you know what? Aa and I still think you're a cunt, but I'm still gonna say Elodia cause I'm sick of not saying hello. So, hey, how are you? Oh yeah, that's good guy. Fuck off. No, you know, just leaving that option open. Cause it doesn't mean you, you, you can't cut somebody out of your fucking life either. Don't ever be afraid to do that. Don't ever be afraid to treat somebody like a fuck tumor. Um, I don't know why I'm saying all this shit. Um, I'm actually in a, I'm in a great fucking mood. All Billy red face has been fucking first time in my life. I've been working in Hollywood

Speaker 1:          02:02          23 years. I'm working in Hollywood. Up until now, all I've done as a random acting gig and I've done stand up and we all know that's not working. That's just fun. Um, the little last week to keep you guys interested to keep stoking the fires here. Uh, me and the guys down at wild west, the men and women down at wild west have been editing. Uh, the six episodes of f is for family that's coming out on Netflix in December. And, um, Jesus Christ, dude, Jesus Christ, um, all knew I already had respect for fucking editors and all of that type of shit, but actually going through the fucking process, um, I just just been going all fucking day long and into the night and all of that shit. But I gotta tell you this, I am so ridiculously excited about this show. I think this might be the one, this is a, I really got a, I'm not going to jinx it.

Speaker 1:          02:57          I think I'm, you guys are going to find it as funny as we're finding it, but um, that comes out in December and uh, I actually, we did some of the music yesterday. You wouldn't fucking believe all the shit you got to do next time you watch anything. Just listen to the music, that transition. Like you got to sit there and watch the fucking episode and when you go from one fucking thing that's going on to another thing, it's like, do you need like some music there? If we do, what kind of music or this emotion is happening? What sorta doing that, you know, I gotta be honest with you, I love music but doing it that way it becomes fucking work. But, uh, I still had a good time cause I'm the studio that does the music. Um, they got this one classic song that we're, that we're going to buy.

Speaker 1:          03:47          You gotta buy the music, right? And one of the cool characters is driving down the street, not to give anything away here. And uh, they let me play the drums over the drum track to put it on that just to some fucking cool to do. And uh, I got to tell you, it's one of the coolest fucking things they ever got to do. And, uh, this guy had a home studio where they built a room inside of the room and I was blown away because my whole life, I pick the fucking instrument we have to go. Typical fucking comedian, right? I'm already isolated enough, already enough of a loner already. Enough of a psycho. I picked drums. Well, you basically have to go play in some studio space in a warehouse in the middle of some fucking trucking district so you don't piss off your neighbors and seeing this person, you know, personally, I had a house, you know, with people right on either side, one of those, reach out the window and touch your neighbors house.

Speaker 1:          04:38          And they had built a room within the fucking room. I mean, Gut, granted it cost a fortune, but dude, like you're in there, it's Trump's, you gotta have your plugs. You go outside fucking dudes playing. No, he just said it was cool. It was so fucking quiet. I couldn't believe it. So now of course I'm obsessed with that and uh, I don't have any room in my house to do it, but I'm thinking like, you know this kitchen? Nah. You know, we don't need to sit down to have breakfast. I could fucking build a little room within a room. I could put my fucking, my drug drums right in there. Then I'm staring at right now that I can't fucking play 71 Ludwig green spot. Right. Got a fucking kind of play him. I actually, this is well fucked up. This is, I actually have professional carrying cases for my drums because I have to pack them up, put them in the back of my truck and drive them to a fuck if I want to play them. I just can't sit down like all you can to play the Ukulele. Right. Just sit down and you jam jams and cross your fucking legs and start singing tip toe through the tulips, whatever. The few new with the fucking windows open. Nobody gives a shit. Right? It's a Ukulele.

Speaker 1:          05:51          If you get a noise complaint for a Ukulele, do you have any idea how bad you suck? I'm just saying, all right. The greatest drummer in the world could be playing drums, somebody next to those and be like, know they're going to freak the fuck out. Um, till it typical. Why? Why would I pick something so antisocial? So anyways, so we've been having a great time and uh, I got to tell you man, I think it's a fucking great God damn show. And um, everybody, we got so many people on Sam Rockwell, Justin Long fucking crushing it on this thing and it got me laughing and watch these tapes like 50 fucking times in a row and they still got me laughing. Um, uh, I dunno. All right. Whatever, whatever. Let's just plow ahead here that Kate has been a little geek out fucking excited about this thing.

Speaker 1:          06:42          You know I'm loving about it is Netflix is letting me, letting us be like standup comedy. Funny. Cause they don't have any fucking advertisers, right? They don't have them. Well, when in doubt, fucking cunts age at 12 to 13 and a half, aren't you a, you know, fucking uh, I dunno suggesting that they sniff glue, whatever the fuck it is that they do. You know, I don't even know what they say cause I just glaze over. I glaze over whenever a meeting and that happens during a script thing I owe for my whole career. I just glazed over and there's just something in my head going, yeah, yeah, so don't pick it up. Don't pick it up. Fuck it. Let's end this business relationship. Let's get outta here. I'm gonna go back down to the comedy club and have a good fucking time. So we get in this, this God Damn Romper Room Shit where you got to babysit adults every fucking joke you tell whatever.

Speaker 1:          07:29          Staying positive here. Speaking to say in positive, all Tom Brady, the manual wall want to be the life you all want to have. I got such a kick out of everybody trying to rub it in that they upheld his suspension. And by they, I mean the guy who gave, who gave out the fucking suspension, who then was judge and jury. Gee, did we lose? Um, I can't tell you how fucking excited I am to have a rested pissed off with something extra to prove Tom Brady coming in game five. All right. All you fucking NFL fans out there who are loving this shit, right? Cause you don't have a dimple in your fucking chin. You don't got a supermodel on your arm. You know, got a great head of hair. That's um, but I don't resent him for it. I'm rooting for, I'm rooting for, I'm rooting for his hairline.

Speaker 1:          08:24          Um, deaf fucking guy is going to come back. I'm telling you right now, he's, he's just going to fall. He's going to fucking destroy. He's never going to address this thing again. And he's going to go in there and he's gonna kick the shit out of people. And then I just can't wait to see what the fuck the colts are going to whine about next year. What are the Raven's going to whine about next year? What? What the, what are they going to whine about those two upstanding football fucking clubs. Jesus Christ. Realize if Robert Kraft had the personal life of Jim or say it would never be off at ESPN. I'm telling you right now, man, if you want to be a complete the generate, do it in the fucking Midwest cause nobody gives a shit. All right? The press is in New York and they're new in La and maybe they'll Dell Dell 50 cheap bastards. They'll stop off and fucking Chicago to get themselves up. I don't know what a fucking hot dog, whatever the fuck it is. You people lead out there. They don't give a fuck.

Speaker 2:          09:21          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          09:21          If there is no ocean near it, okay. There has to be stacks of bodies before the mainstream press gives a flying fuck. So if you're a complete piece of shit, I mean I'm telling you, Indiana, it's the place to live in Indiana is the place to live. If you're in the clan, you don't even one of the highest clan memberships in the country. And what does Hollywood do? They make these golly, Gee, aw shucks movie about basketball teams. Bunch of white people playing with the fucking globe. Trotters shorts on even though they're not on the globe trotters. Right. I know what I'm talking about. So anyways, um, uh, I got such exists, one kid wrote, he goes to employ these legacies destroyed though. Is it amongst two? Huh? Guys like you who were fucking somebody else's Jersey and you sit there eating wings becoming even fatter, get another chin on your fucking face.

Speaker 1:          10:12          It's destroyed with you. Do you think he gives a fuck? His reputation is not destroyed amongst any of the all time great football players. That's all it gives a fuck about. All right. And is that the, you know what I love about, he gets his suspension. There was no proof while you had a bunch of circumstantial evidence. All right. And the best you got 'em on is taking a contest of air out of a ball. That's all you have, which is basically watching somebody had a 500 foot fucking home run, but they have too much pine tar. And then you try and be like, well, if you do know the pie tarp, he wanted to ground it out to short. What do you, Oh yeah, we, we won by 38 points. Is that what you're telling me? Whatever. Enjoy it. Enjoy it. You got something to say to a patriots fan when you fucking lose to us again next year. All right, so when join, and as I mentioned before, I'm totally on board with dawn Sweeney. Now I got to be, I'm a Bruins fan. Fuck it. I've had my little pout. I love Lou Cheech always. Well, same thing with Douggie Hamilton, but what am I going to do? They're not Brian's anymore. What am I not watch the fucking Berlin is? Am I going to start watching Calgary up there in the fucking saddle dome? No,

Speaker 1:          11:24          I love the king's man, but I'm not gonna find yet. And I will, you know, the only good thing about the Lou Cheech traders, I got to fucking drive down the staple center. I can watch them

Speaker 1:          11:34          just sit in the crowd crying. We miss you man. So, but I'm going with this. This is my obvious prediction with dawn Sweeney and this is why I love the guy already. He is either, this is going to be either an absolute fucking debacle or he's going to be considered an absolute genius. And I'm telling you, you gotta respect a man that's too finally gets this job, who's got the balls to come in day one and in the short term, piss off the fan base, risking in the end that they're all going to be loving them, carrying him down the street when we went another cup. Um, he's going all enough and with this and I, I love it. So I'm going to sit here and I'm gonna Watch this Bruins season. Well, I don't even know if we'll make the playoffs, but I'm going to watch, um, I'm gonna, I'm gonna look for the rays of light is a gradually building this thing up.

Speaker 1:          12:30          And then you try it, you know, so fucked up now it's like you literally have like three years as a GM now to start with nothing and to somehow turn it all around and when a cup are, they fucking shove you off. But uh, whatever my fucking hats off to for a, for dawn Sweeney for having the fucking balls to do it and um, that doesn't work out. I forgive him the fuck you gay. You somebody got the balls to do that, you know, I dunno. What do this is how starved I am for fucking sports right now. This time of year, is it me or does the WNB eight not the level of play is not nearly as bad as it was years ago. And I'm looking at the highlights and it looks pretty fucking entertaining to me. I'm just saying an entertaining all right. I know that they can't jump as high as the guys and all that shit, but at the end of the day, I tell you, I watched that women's World Cup. It was fucking phenomenal. Very entertaining. I will watch. I like women's soccer better than men's soccer. The women, they get knocked down, they get back up, they don't fucking, you know, rolling around on the ground like the guys

Speaker 1:          13:36          doing the shit they do. And then when they don't get the yellow car, the red car, where the fuck it is, they sit there on their knees. You know what the eyes all up and fucking their hands out like this. Sing in the last few notes in an opera, the fuck up off the ground. Jesus Christ, you are a disgrace. Anyways. Um, does that mean I'm going to go out of the way to sit down and watch a w and NBA NBA game? No I won't, but if I'm flipping through the channels, I'm not going to shut off. You'll be great if WMB NBA became this great thing cause right now they would be in the fucking ABA years. You know what I mean? If I was in broadcasting right now and I couldn't get in with the big boys, I'd fucking tried to do a w NBA game.

Speaker 1:          14:21          Try to get in with them the way Bob Costas has got him with the Aba. Right. He got in and uh, he became a made guy. Look at him. Now it's what you gotta do when the dinner did Jackie Moon years. Is that the name of Wheel Ferris character? I don't fucking know. So, um, anyways, so they upheld the Tom Brady thing. Who's kitten? No, off the record. The guy destroys his cell phone. That's not a good look. Does it make sense? This is defense. Makes Sense. Absolutely. What's Tom Brady going to throw out his cell phone with a bunch of hall of fame numbers in there, you know,

Speaker 1:          14:59          budget models, supermodels, phone. You can't throw the fucking thing out. He's got to destroy it. I would think a lot of famous people have to destroy their cell phones, their laptops, everything before they throw it out. Um, do I think that, uh, you know, I do. I think that he knew about the fucking football thing. He probably did do I think it's like this epic level of fucking cheating and that's why we won. No, not even remotely. I think it's a little bit of gamesmanship and I think Jim Irsay is a fucking baby and that if anybody did what he did to our team, you'd find shit that they're doing. Now. I know a lot of you guys want to know only the Patriots cheat and I don't know what to tell you. I don't know. You know, if you can't be honest about your own fucking team, I'm sure the Patriots Ben, the fucking rules. But you know, do you think the buffalo bills don't, they've never won a Superbowl Jesus fucking Christ if, if you caught them dead to rights.

Speaker 2:          15:55          Okay.

Speaker 1:          15:56          Not just hearsay with Brady. If you cut the buffalo bill's dead to rights. I mean, I don't think that you get punished. They've tried everything else. They've tried every legitimate way of fucking winning, right?

Speaker 1:          16:08          They're actually going to be good this year, man. I think, I think rex Ryan's going to do real well with that fucking team because he's a defensive minded guy, Danny. And he, they, they already have a great defense and I think they led the league in sacks according to this person that I talked to who was not connected to the NFL in any way. All right. I think they're going to do okay. Um, and you know what? I bet they play us early on when Brady is not playing and they're going to win. And guess who? I'm going to get a call from all shred and Reagan.

Speaker 2:          16:36          Okay.

Speaker 1:          16:37          I hear from those guys once every six years because that's how long it takes a team from buffalo to beat anybody from Boston being a country, you know, that's what I do.

Um, so anyways, uh, what else did I want to talk about? What do I have? Your foot being forced. Fed. Do you guys see this story? I didn't really see the story. What I did was I just looked up Google news says prisoners on hunger strike in Israel maybe forced fed under new law. They're going to do it like they do to the ducks. Like stick a funnel in them that Fragua

Speaker 2:          21:02          okay.

Speaker 1:          21:02          I fucking hate that Shit, man. I fucking it. Why do we have to do that? How do you force feed a duck? Man? I, first of all, how do you not like a duck? I'm not gonna lie to you. I'll fucking Aye. I duck is delicious.

Speaker 1:          21:16          When I was overseas, I had this breast of duck that was fucking outstanding. All right? But as far as I know, the thing wasn't forced fed. You know what I mean? What you want to do with animals is you let them live a life and then in the end you take them out like stacks and fucking a good fellas, right? You have the duck put on a pot of coffee. You know what I mean? He's walking around in his yellow Skippy's coming up right behind him with a silencer. Big Bang, done nothing. They're sticking a funnel on his fucking mouth. All right? Jillaroos alum, Joe Rose alone. This is where Jesus washed his feet. Joe Russo's alone sticks on paper in a wall. Maybe something and visible will care and make your dreams come true, but it's your wall. Shoot. Anyone else is this. If you had the love boat in the Middle East, dig in oil drilling oil, funneling the money through the mosque to the Tahoe.

Speaker 1:          22:27          So now be blowing up a pizza parlor. Alright? Um, Israel. Less legislator voted Thursday to allow the force feeding of hunger, striking prisoners in extreme cases. By the way, shout out to anybody, one of those countries. So who's listened to this fucking thing? You know who plays drums? You know, how are you? How are you? Me Over there. How's it going? Anyways, a move that appeared to be aiming at preventing Palestinian inmates from using fast to when they're released, particularly from indefinite incarceration. All right? There you got to say, what are they in jail for? And then you also got to be like, well, what? Well, if they want to starve themselves to death, doesn't that save you money? Or they become a martyr. They're already in jail, are already a Marta, so why don't you just let them fucking a naughty,

Speaker 2:          23:16          Huh?

Speaker 1:          23:19          It's usually helps when you fucking read up on these things. This is me. If I ever did the national news, I'd wear a suit though. I would dress up a little, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop. Got a black knight. Leidos, a professional is that, it's a lie. I'm bill burr a rides grubs, cut dab the MOH and the Israeli medical is though Jason called it torture and vowed, well wait a minute, it's torture to force feed somebody. How do you force feed somebody? You know what you do is you make like a fucking peanut butter and jelly sandwich, but there's no peanut butter cause you don't want it to be hard to go down. You wet the bread like that Asian dude does. When he wins to a hot dog contest against all those fucking fat fucks over there and Coney Island, right? You'll wet down. It's a jelly sandwich. You ball it up, may just walk towards, we have a buyer and you're back. You know,

Speaker 1:          24:12          and then you know, you go, hey, look at that. When he's not looking, you get clash. She Hammond on the nape of his neck and then you just fucking shove it in. Very good. Alright, most talk about fucking a stamina, you know what I mean? If somebody is trying to force feed me. If I was starving myself, they came up with a sandwich, you know, four hours in, I just be like, hey, no, there's no reason to do that. I'll eat it. I wish he didn't dunk it under the water, but this point has been four hours. I don't give a fuck. I'll eat it. All right. Anyways, in recent years, hundreds of Palestinians and conducted collective individual hunger strikes. Let's get to do force feeding. How the fuck does that work? You said force feeding. When not, I thought they just stuck like an ivy in. Yeah. Wait a second. Wait a second. Where the fuck is that? That's the part. It's absolutely clear that this is torture. All right. Wait a minute here. So now, now what do you think? I'm going to Google. Huh? Not going to Google the fucking weather force. Feeding the fuck did I get on this subject? Methods.

Speaker 2:          25:20          Okay.

Speaker 1:          25:21          Oh, Ben, your mouth.

Speaker 2:          25:24          Okay.

Speaker 1:          25:24          Oh, we'll shove it up. Your digestive tract force feeding autonomo force feeding.

Speaker 1:          25:33          Here's what really happens when you force feed someone. This is somebody that you know, who the fuck knows, okay, this needs to be a wire here and the medical associations, red cars, both condemn force feeding, widespread condemnation. Nobody likes it. All right? So they stick in a fucking chair that looks like one of the prototypes for those weeder. Jim. Thanks. You know, like just imagine if you work in your upper chest, so you got to use at a 45 degree angle and then they got these two like cushion things so you can't turn your head. You don't like the neck pillow. Just imagine if it was for the side of your face. They got these two giant blocks on either side. Then they strap you in and they will yen like fucking Hannibal Lecter placement or they put a feeding tube. Oh, they shove it up your nose.

Speaker 1:          26:18          No matter the circumstance. Placing the feeding tube is tricky, especially when the subject is thrashing around saying, stop doing that. Uh, it's also vital doctors performed this procedure. Even on willing patients have noted that the tube can go through the nose, out of the mouth at which points that it has to be pulled out and replaced. The tube can also be, can go down the wind pipe instead of the esophagus and forcing food into someone's lung can cause permanent pneumonia, a collapsed lung or death. Why aren't they coughing at that point? Uh, but blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Right? So that's how they do it. A feeding tube, starvation and refeeding soon force feeding. Is it something that is done on one ms meal? A person who is forced fed has often been starving themselves for days. There are complications that come with feeding someone who just stopped eating entirely, one of which is called refeeding syndrome. When a person has started themselves for days, their body metabolism has shifted. Shifting it back with a sudden lodge thing of above bar releases insulin. All right, this is basing off, there's this fucking terrible how we can't get along to this fucking point that you actually have to put somebody in a jail and then they stop eating and then you got to force feed them

Speaker 1:          27:30          and now cause you give a fuck whether they live or not. This is just depressing.

Speaker 1:          27:34          We're fucking animals, man. You know what I mean? We really are. At the end of the fucking day, half the shit we do. You know what I mean? Just watch it. Watch the discovery Channel One time when they show monkeys and the horrible shit that they do to each other. Now that we're finally past the fact that we realize fucking chimpanzee can rip your face off and that they also eat meat and they eat other monkeys and they enjoy it slowly killing them. Very sadistically like the, the, the fucking parallels to human beings. It's, it's unbelievable. We're fucking animals. Fucking animals. So that's why I don't watch the news. Why don't talk? How fucking disgusting was that? All right. That's 28 minutes everybody. Sorry for the force feeding thing. You did get to listen to me sing the love boat theme about the Middle East. Um, all right.

Speaker 1:          28:16          So anyways, I'm back to playing hockey, which I'm psyched about cause I embarrassed myself so much when I was up in Canada and, uh, that's a good move built. Don't play hockey for a while and then go play in Canada. I'm sure you'll match up. Well. Um, I actually played last Tuesday night, which is great too for the fucking, uh, trying to lose the weight here. I'm down to a buck 78. All right. It's supposed to be one 77 by Sunday, um, to lose my three pounds for the fucking week. And once they get to one 77, then the next one's one 74. And that's when it starts to get exciting for me. Right? That's when the, uh, the fuck, you know what I've learned about trying to get abs, especially at my advanced age, is the top two abs. They're easy, you know, that's like that chick that would fuck anybody in the high school.

Speaker 1:          29:01          It's just, you know, it's, if you don't have the top two abs. So like I don't know what to talk to you. I had came fucking talk to you. All right. The middle ones are motherfuckers and the last two, I know you have eight packs, eight packs of those long fucking ones. And that's when you got to show people your pubes. So I'm, I have no interest in those fucking things. But those bottom two, the ones that are basically the security for your navel, those two that, that it's basically, it's fucking impossible. You know what I mean? That's like one of those deals where you gotta be starving yourself and eating a whole chicken every other hour to keep your body burning it. This when that, when the trainers use that thing, it's basically they use creepy shit. Like basically your body is eating itself, you know, he said they went, they're fucking Orange Tan.

Speaker 1:          29:49          Um, well it's a looks business. It's all about looks. Um, all right, this is your, this is your Monday. Does your Thursday afternoon fucking podcast or I don't know what the hell you guys want from me looking at Bam 30 minutes and to just like that. Um, I'm actually, you know what, I'm actually starting to take drum lessons again. I had so much fun when I was up in Montreal and typical me, I got like 10 fucking things going on once I'm editing the show, I'm taking drum lessons and then I also enrolled in the a that helicopter safety course because I want to start getting my cross country miles up. You know what I mean? Which is basically anytime you fly like round trip, I guess 25 miles away from the airport, something like that, I don't fucking know what I'm talking about. Um, but uh, I just want to have all the emergency procedures down so I'm gonna learn how to do that.

Speaker 1:          30:34          Fucking an autorotation ought to take it all the way down to the fucking ground. Pick out a spot, bring that fucker all the way down to the ground and then, you know what? Then I can fly around out there. I could feel good, get myself my 200 hours. Plus if you have less than 200 hours, you've got to do an annual review. And who wants to do that? 200 hours. It's every two fucking years, right? So then I can blow off studying for 23 months instead of the fucking 11. I'm going to be in the same boat. What are you going to do? But, uh, I want to get my hours up to like 200 hours. And then I feel like once I have like 200 hours and have really flown around the La based and I know all the fucking radio calls, got it down by heart, I really feel like I know what I'm doing then.

Speaker 1:          31:12          And only then will I bring up a passenger. Um, but I'm really excited about it. And uh, I dunno, I got add, I have to have at least three fucking things going on at once. And then my schedule gets totally overloaded. And then I'm like, what the fuck? And then my wife's like, you need to relax. And then I get rid of a couple of things and I chill for a few days or maybe even a week. And then it slowly builds back up again and um, uh, it's, uh, it's how I do it. So go fuck. He's not, and I don't say that on Thursdays. You know what? Enjoy your weekend. [inaudible] you know I have a good fucking time. Oh, by the way, I want to learn how to smoke. No thing I'm trying to do. I've got, I've got some ribs this weekend. All right. Anybody else got the big green egg?

Speaker 1:          31:55          Just tell me how high to pile the fucking charcoal and then they hickory that I put in there. I'm a little confused about that. Do you always have to soap the hickory? I know they have the hickory chips where you're soaking, but if you get a big block, a hickory that doesn't need to be smoked. Right. Just in general. That would, when it lights, it's, it doesn't burn. It's smokes. Am I correct in thinking that cause everything else, I'm fucking ready to go. I got the barbecue, I get the rib rack. I got that Barbecue Guru thing that's got the fan on the fucking timer. I got the place I'm ready to go. And what I want to do is basically just start doing it fucking like I always tell how I always learned how to do shit fucking up royally and making an ass of myself and then gradually I get it down.

Speaker 1:          32:41          So, um, I'm interested in doing that. So if anybody, uh, if you'd done a pork shoulder on the, on the egg or if you've done ribs, just let me know. Uh, I'm really interested in how that whole thing works as far as building that fire and on how the fuck it stays lit the whole night. Like I watched this guy do a, a pork shoulder with pork, but more fucking accurate. And um, he put his, uh, the things that will lighten the charcoal, the little squares he put them, he, the way he did it was he just stuck them on the left side knowing that they were going to slowly, they'd light and then they'd slowly burn all the way across. And this fucking guy just went to bed and woke up like eight hours later and he was still right at the temperature that he needed to be.

Speaker 1:          33:25          And um, you know what I mean? I'm not the brightest guy. That fucking blows my mind. So if you guys know how to do it, please let me know. Cause, uh, I want to be one of those guys making youtube videos going. Oh, look at that smoke ring. Oh, alright. So that's it. That's the Thursday afternoon podcast. Enjoy the, uh, the throwback podcast here from, uh, a podcast a long time ago from a time, uh, that was not now. That was a back then. That's it. Uh, oh. Hey. And also I'm a book in my fault. I got a bunch of fucking dates coming up that it will be announced, uh, in one granddaddy of them all. Um, and I'll be announcing those soon. All right, so that's it. I gave a little teaser. Everybody started telling you friends, oh, red face has a show calledF is for family. It's coming out on Netflix in December. And, uh, he's pretty, uh, he's pretty excited about it and right be the first to tell people,

Speaker 3:          34:17          well, the watch that show, so you can be the dude. I called a guy, whatever. Just do me a solid if you can. I appreciate it. The can I understand. All right, that's good.

Speaker 2:          34:24          Have a good weekend.

Speaker 3:          34:49          Um, all right, so let's get on with the podcast. Last week, ladies and Gentlemen, I had the pleasure fear of performing on the David Letterman show. And uh, most of you went out, you watched it and you all set me wonderful emails about it. And I would read you the wonderful emails, but they're not funny, but you are in luck. You know what ones are funny? The ones where people did not like my performance. So let's read a couple of those, shall we? Um, all right, let's read the hate mail here. So what happens with all of all of my hate mail is when people don't like, my act is you can't just write me evidently and just say that you don't like my act. You don't appreciate what it is I do on the stage. What you have to do first is you have to establish what an incredible sense of fucking humor you have and how open you are to all different forms of humor.

Speaker 3:          35:42          You know, it's that classic thing like those douchebags on Youtube. Oh, palm is a fucking idiot and I'm a Democrat, right? So then we can be like, wow, this guy is left and even he doesn't like this lefty guy. So this is what they do. All right, so here. So these both these emails follow to a Goddamn fucking t did the motherfucking u and v um, they follow it. They follow that pattern bill. Just read the fucking thing. Okay, here we go. All right. Hi there. How this one starts. Starts off. Nice enough. Hi there. I've been a fan for a while. You seem to have a unique take on things. Look at this, Huh? Pat me on the head. Let me sniffer hand making me nice and fucking relaxed. I loved your bit about the muffins and the mass vehicular murder.

Speaker 3:          36:43          So there you go. She just showed how it just her sense of humor spans the globe, whether I'm attacking food are actually running over human beings on the sidewalk. She finds it all funny though. And here's the rub though. As a stay at home mom, I now completely despise you. I did this bit about being a stay at home mom. Um, so anyways, she says the hardest part about being a stay at home mom is being respect is being disrespected by everyone. I now hope the worst for you, despite what funny acts you may think up in the future. You are a jerk and deserve the worst that life has to offer.

Speaker 4:          37:33          Okay?

Speaker 3:          37:34          I don't fuck it. I don't, I don't understand like these, this is the classic fucking person where everything is funny until it comes around to some shit in her life. And I make some fun of some shit that she's doing, being a stay at home mom. And now all of a sudden she goes from being a fan of mine to now I am a jerk and deserve the worst that life has to offer. That's, that's a fucking hard courts that you deserve. The worst that life has to offer. So what? I'm going to get leprosy, ed, uh, be constipated all at the same time and fucking, uh, survive a plane crash, but not in a good way, you know? Anyways, I don't fucking know. Rarely you're going to take it to that level. So I wrote her back and I said a sweetheart. Oprah Winfrey called your job the toughest job on the planet, on national television and got an applause break of approval. How much more respect do you need? I think that's a great point. If I could step outside the email, break the fucking fourth wall. Is that what it is? The third wall? I never knew what the fuck it was. Huh?

Speaker 3:          38:44          Oprah Winfrey's on TV saying you have the toughest job on the planet and everybody claps. All right. Did she say being a standup comedian is the toughest job on the planet? You think you know what it's like to be fucking disrespected you apron wherein sheltered son of a bitch. Huh? You want to talk about being disrespected? Look at fucking comedians anytime they show a comedian in a movie. Is it a Chris Rock level comic? It never is. It's the fucking hack with the lampshade on his head going Wakawaka right.

Speaker 2:          39:17          Okay.

Speaker 3:          39:18          Didn't the fucking comedian gets shot in his gut during Scarface. Ah, did a fucking stay at home. Mom gets shot in the fucking stomach with that Mr. Potato head mask on her face during that show. No. You know why? Cause she was at home taking care of the fucking kids. Ah, Jesus Christ jobs can read the rest of this email. I didn't even fucking make sense. It started off funny and then it just went right off the rails like a Prius that you can't fucking stop. Um, anyways, uh, she says, so I wrote, I wrote how much more respect do you need? And then I said, meanwhile there are children working in sweat shops. Would you rather be a stay at home mom or an eight year old sewing Adidas together for 16 hours a day?

Speaker 2:          40:02          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          40:02          I came up with another great example that I wish I had used on TV. How about, how about you work on one of those fucking oil rigs, like those poor bastards who work for BP. Then all of a sudden out of nowhere the fucking thing explodes. You standing on a metal structure in the middle of the goddamn ocean and next thing you know blows up. Probably blew up both your air drums. He had deaf now and you're on fire. All right? And your only option is either burning to death or jumping off of basically the equivalent of the top of a brownstone trying to enter the water without doing the world's biggest flaming belly flop, right? You land in the water, second and third degree burns in saltwater. Alright, pus and blood is oozing into the water and now all you can do is pray to God that the Coast Guard gets there before a sea of sharks eat you alive.

Speaker 2:          41:01          Okay?

Speaker 3:          41:02          All right, you want to do that or you want to watch Bob the builder for the 800 time lighten up. And then I wrote, Oh, and don't despise or hope the worst for me. That causes premature aging hugs. I know that was kind of mean to say, but you know what? Go Fuck Yourself. All right. Here's another one. Once again, we have to establish credibility at the top of the email. Are you guys ready for the credibility to be established? Jesus Christ, I know I am. Here we go. Ah, Bill, I am never appalled or capital letters offended by comedy that I see in here. All capitals. This sentence, I have a great sense of humor. Wow. This is unbelievable. Isn't that amazing podcast listeners, this person is never appalled or offended by comedy that she sees or hears. She has a great sense of humor.

Speaker 3:          41:59          She has such a great sense of humor. People that she had to yell at at me and emails. All right, so just no way she had a problem with my apt, right? Let's read the rest of the email, however. Oh Gee. You're a parents on the David Letterman show that I just watched. Just put down women and motherhood to an extent that is just downright unbelievable. dot.dot. Now she's going to yell again and tasteless. Now she yells for the rest of this email, but I'm going to spare you guys. All right. I'm going to read it and soothing tones, but she's screaming the entire time. That's what I'm guessing because it's all capital letters. Um, this is what she says. I challenge you to be a single parent and raise a child and work and attend college alone without any help just in case you don't know what being a single parent meets. All right? Um, you have no idea how hard it really is. I am disgusted with your act and will not ever buy any of your DVDs, et Cetera.

Speaker 3:          43:14          For the first time in my life, I am disgusted with comedy. Your comedy, that is like a, she starts speaking like in film nor, and I'm disgusted with this comedy. Y'All comedy that is say, Eh, 23. Skidoo alright. Your Act touched on many topics that you were disgraceful and very unappealing. I think she got so mad she stopped writing sentences. Um, first of all, sweetheart, I wasn't making fun of a single, uh, single, uh, parents that was making fun of single parents. Nobody would laugh. I was talking about stay at home moms. All right. You don't remember that line hanging out all day, making grilled cheese sandwiches. You given a puppet show, you dress like a dragon and then some other adult comes home and gives you money. You're like a big kid. That's some other adults coming home, giving you money is your fucking husband. You dumped broad. Do I gotta fucking spell it out to you? So I just wrote her back. I just said I wasn't talking about single moms. I was talking about stay at home moms. You weren't listening

Speaker 4:          44:32          just about the time.

Speaker 3:          44:46          I've actually been talking about this shit on stage and uh, I don't give a fuck because it's such a topical bit. I don't even know if people are gonna think it's funny in a month. But, uh, can we please talk about fucking Bill O'reilly going on the view? Um, I gotta I gotta tell you something right now. I don't like that guy's politics. I don't like his face. He has, he has that racist face. You know his, when he gets mad, his fucking, his face gets pointy. He just looks evil. He's just not a pleasant human being whatsoever, but I got to tell you, he fucking destroyed on the view, you know, and I, somewhere in there was a victory for men because he took on for fucking women. They were all yelling and he got two of them to walk off their own fucking show. How do you do that?

Speaker 3:          45:50          I as a comedian, I was embarrassed to, to stand up Kummete comics just quit, which is why I'm nominating Joy Bay harbor and Whoopi Goldberg is Douche bags of the week. What did you think was going to ask? Do you think he was going to go? No. Wait, don't leave. That's exactly what the fuck he wanted you to do. I was actually hoping at that point that the other two women were going to leave and then he could just start hosting the O'Reilly factor on the view. That would have been he just totally 100% dominated at the very least, that segment, because I don't, I don't watch that fucking show, but just, he just came on. First of all, he sits down, he's got on that shiny fucking Joe Pesci shoot Joe Pesci Peshy suit. It's difficult to say Joe Pesci suit and he's got his fucking leg spread like a with his ball bag.

Speaker 3:          46:45          Hang his shiny ball bag. He locally if do you ever see like, uh, when Kennedy debated Nixon, how, if you listen to it on the radio, how everybody said Nixon won. But if you watched it on TV, Nixon was all tanned up. He had his legs crossed, he looked like a winner and Nixon sat there with his fucking legs splayed and cross like underneath the chair. He looked like a fucking moron. That's what bill O'Reilly looked like. And he, he just, he still dominated. I love when he turned to joy and was just whatever I, I'm paraphrasing here, but he was just like, be quiet and learned that she had nothing, a fucking standup comic. She had nothing. The whole segment was fucking hilarious. And when he goes, uh, another gem of a moment was when he goes, you know, a lot of people don't realize this, but 70% of Americans don't want a mosque at ground zero.

Speaker 3:          47:45          And Joy goes, she goes, well, I'd like to see that that poll or something like an, as she sang that the crowd is applauding what bill O'Reilly just said. So you really don't need to see the pole at that point. And, and getting beyond that, what he really should have said was 70% of Americans don't realize that they're not building a mosque at ground zero still, that they're actually making a rec room with a ping pong table and an area to pray kind of like they have an area to pray it every fucking airport, you know, three, four blocks up the street at a God damn coat factory is where it's actually being built. But the fact that he said that they're still building a mosque and that he got an applause break, joy is so wrapped up into her own fucking opinion that she doesn't even hear her own studio audience back up.

Speaker 3:          48:37          The guy that she's trying to shit on and the fact that this fucking guy is still putting out inaccurate information, that people are still back in edit. It just was fucking awesome on all of those levels. And a, I liked how Barbara Walters was old school. Cool. And she didn't walk off. She gave those two Douche bags of the week shit for walking off their own show. And then she got him with a nice little classy Zinger. He said, Bill O'reilly's on here this week. When we come back, we're going to talk, um, or he's on the show today. We're going to, when we come back, he's going to talk about his new book called pinheads and Patriots. And then she looked at bill and she goes, at this point, I, uh, I'm not sure which you are, or something like that. It was a great little zinger, but she wasn't like judging the guy.

Speaker 3:          49:27          I Dunno if the whole thing was funny and just how bill O'Reilly is, is, is viewed as this intolerant person. And then he comes on the show of a, I guess mostly liberals, and then they show absolutely no tolerance for him and then throw a fucking temper tantrum and walk off their own goddamn show. I mean, you can't tell me, everybody over at at Fox News wasn't literally jerking off to that moment. I, Bill O'reilly Bomas became a fucking rock star in that moment. That was, that was like a standup comic moment that he did to two comedians, which blew my mind. You know? And I know I'm always trashing the odds on this show, but that really was a chick way of handling, losing an argument. Like, I'm just going to get off up and stormed off. He is so used to people paying for your drinks and holding the Goddamn door for you. You actually thought that as an adult that you were just going to walk off the shell and this was going to be this big moment. And he was going to be like, oh, wait a minute, let me stop.

Speaker 2:          50:32          Ah,

Speaker 3:          50:33          I loved it. He was like, go ahead and leave. I don't give a fuck. I'll take over your fucking show. Um, so anyways, there you go. Douche bags of the week. Joe Bay Harbor and Whoopi Goldberg for walking off your own fucking show when a shiny suit fucking, I can't say he's a moron because he does know. I mean, I look, he, he, he's very red up

Speaker 3:          51:05          on that. Yeah. I don't know. I'm too stupid. This is why I wouldn't, this is right here. Why I would never engage as much as I disagree with his opinions. I don't fucking pay attention to politics at all. I don't, I find it frustrating. I find it to be it just a rigged fucking gay. I don't give a fuck, you know, and I, so I would never try to, as much as I disagree with Bill O'reilly, I would never go on his show and try to fucking one up the guy and think I'm going to, uh, beat the guy in an argument about politics. It's like he, he's paying attention to these politicians the way I, I give a fuck about football. I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna win that argument. I mean, why don't I bring fucking Roy Jones Jr rover and start debating him in about boxing. I know. It's just, it was, uh, it was fucking hilarious at the whole thing was just, it was hilarious and a big, big fucking victory for that fucking, I dunno. I Dunno. It's a stand up comic. You fucking, he just tap out. That was embarrassing. Anyway, so let's get on with the God damn podcast for this week. Um, I kind of liked that you guys liked that format. Just getting the Douche bag or the week out of the way. Right off the fucking best.

Speaker 2:          52:28          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          52:43          notice and remind you, you guys have a haze. Anybody at work? I used to work in this warehouse and we were, we were a bunch of fucking maniacs and all day long, all we did was break balls. Uh, I've told you this shit before because we were basically mentally smart enough to work in a warehouse by the time you went third grade. You know what I mean? It's supposed to be 10 boxes according to the packing list. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. There you go. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12. Sorry, sesame street, flashback. Um,

Speaker 2:          53:17          okay.

Speaker 3:          53:17          So we used to fuck around all the time and our manager had no control over us. You know, we didn't respect him. We knew he wasn't going to win fire. We wasn't going to fire us. He didn't have the goddamn heart. And at the end of the day we got a fucking job done. So he decides that were the problem is, is that we're all too fucking young. There's a level of immaturity out there. Cause we were all in our early twenties that we, uh, that he should hire. He hired this 38 year old guy. Um, I actually remember his name, but I'm not going to any, I don't name names on this shit. And uh, Jesus Christ, that fucking guys, almost 60, he was like 38 and that was 22 fucking years ago. He's 60.

Speaker 2:          53:56          Okay.

Speaker 3:          53:56          What the fuck? So anyways, this guy drove a fucking Sky Blue Chevy cavalier station wagon, four door, bare bones, factory fucking rims. The car was like three years old. He had 8,000 miles on it. All right? And this guy was a Weirdo and he had these fucking glasses, these black frame glasses that nobody wore in the eighties so we immediately started calling them woody. We'd be, hey woody, how many boxes we get over there? And this guy was just bizarre. And he'd come home, why call me? What are you, are you trying to bring me down? She kept saying, you're trying to bring me down. Did I already tell this fucking story? This sounds oddly familiar to me.

Speaker 2:          54:41          Okay.

Speaker 3:          54:42          So we would just fuck with them. We would just be like, okay at four 31 today, everybody just start going, what do you, what do you, what do you, what do you, that's what we would do. He would be picking orders down in the, in the warehouse area and we would all be picking orders with them. And then out of nowhere we were just talking

Speaker 5:          55:01          cold water,

Speaker 3:          55:03          top of our fucking lungs. I know it's fucking as sophomores but it would fit. And what, we wouldn't say it to him, we would just fucking be, it was really passive aggressive cause he already talked to management about us calling him woody. So it's like, dude, we're not calling you. Woody would just go on woody, woody, woody, woody, woody, look in your vicinity. So we do the same thing trying to bring me down. You're trying to beat me down. So eventually we haze this guy so much that he fucking quit. All right. He and his little Chevy Cavalier fucking four door sky blue bare bone station wagon drove right out in the back of my head. I was like, you know what, I got a bad feeling that mother fuckers coming back. That's right. Right around the time when people first started going postal. So it wasn't enough that that we actually drove this guy out of work. What are they fucking maniacs I worked with somehow got the guys home phone number and the following week he still didn't have a job and he picked up the phone. He's like, hello. And there was 10 of us standing around the phone and we all go,

Speaker 5:          56:05          Ooh.

Speaker 3:          56:09          And I always pictured him slamming the phone down and then looking up like that dude in a clockwork work orange when he realizes the dude who came and fucking kicked the shit out of him and he raped his wife, came back. Um, that's kind of an ugly story. It, you know, for, you know, for as much as people sit there and they talk about this cyber bullying and all this type of shit and how fucking horrible it is, which it is obviously, uh, you know, I don't like how everybody tries to act like they were a victim. Well, I mean weren't you a little bit of both? Cause I know I used to get bullied. Jesus Christ walking up the street looking like fucking that kid on the, uh, the family Griffith. What the fuck is that the hell an Andy Griffith. How did I come up with a family? Griffith. Ah, my fucking brain is mush. Um, yeah, people, you immediately came walking up the street. My fucking mind. My hair was orange when I was growing up. I think I didn't get the shit kicked out of me, you know? But then, you know, I got to live with big, bigger. I got a couple more freckles. I got got some more confidence and I just started picking on kids who were a younger than I was. So now whenever I see those God damn stories, um,

Speaker 3:          57:29          I just, I dunno, I, I see both sides of it. I just see like, yeah, you shouldn't have fucking

Speaker 4:          57:33          done that, but I don't judge the bully because I did shit like that. You guys didn't do shit like that. That's the theme of this whole [inaudible].
