Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on is bill burn. It's time for the Monday morning podcast, but Monday, March 13th, 2017 what's going on? How are you? You know what? I asked you that every week. How are but this, you know, this Monday I would really like to know how are you? What's going on Mandy? What's going on with you? You're, you're scaring me. You know, that's the type of shit you can do when you were abroad. But if you're a gay, you can't do that. You can't be like, Mike, what's going on with me? What's going on? What's going on with you? You're scaring me. You, it was, you're taking by both his hands.

Speaker 2:          00:00:43       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:00:44       All right. I've got an hour here to do and I gotta be honest with you. I don't have shit to say because my life has become very compartmentalized. Being a dad here. Daddy. Oh, she's asleep downstairs, man. She's fucking awesome. Anybody who says that being a parent is hard. It's a fucking pussy. You know, I'm not saying that it's not tedious. I'm not say saying it's not like walking around with a little fucking Kettlebell all day long, you know, especially if you fucked up on your rotator cuffs. I got to keep her in close in the right hand side, you know, keep her in tight. Tiki barber don't fumble.

Speaker 2:          00:01:19       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:01:21       But uh, we just sit around, we listen to a lot of music with the, I was listening to fucking, um, there was, I listened to yesterday just like they called Mulch shot oldies. It's basically like Doo wop from the 1950s and I kind of settled on that channel and after awhile I wanted to turn the channel, but I couldn't because she was sleeping and the remote was like across the table once they must say fall asleep, dude. It's just like, you know, I don't care what position you're in, you're not moving because if fucking sleeping, right. So I just sat there and listened to on a loop to all this

Speaker 3:          00:01:54       Dadda that,

Speaker 1:          00:01:58       but, but, but, but, but, but they book slowly going out of my fucking mind. Do ops great for about four songs in a row. And then it just becomes the same song over and over and fuck it over again. Um, I was listening to that shit for like a fucking, like an hour and like half of those songs have been in Scorsese movies. You know, it's always like some guy's name and then the name of a card, you know, so and so in the Fleetwood's something something and the Belmonts Dion and a bell much. You gotta Love Them. Miss still fucking great.

Speaker 4:          00:02:34       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:34       You know, the wanderer, that fucking song is so applicable to anybody who didn't get married. You're in your forties.

Speaker 1:          00:02:43       Yeah. Well, on the Jab, a guy who will never settled down. It makes you feel great about the choice you made until if you know, you realize he sang it in his twenties, then you're like, oh fuck. What was another one? You talk too much. Talk too much. You were re meet a dead. You talk too much. At least as you've been worried. My pet, it's just like, I can't be the fucking line. But they played it twice. Um, speaking of talking too much, just what the fuck I do on this podcast. Um, oh, I know what I can, I know what, we actually had a date night. This is how much of a fucking dad I'm becoming, you know, still playing drums, you know, schedule a helicopter, uh, thing. So, you know, I'm still trying to keep the hobbies going, but they're there. They're starting to wobble on the sticks here. So, um, we were watching a commercial the other day. No, you're watching will ah, um, the other day and um, they always get to the fucking, the last prize and wheel fortunate is so fucked in a touristy cheap.

Speaker 4:          00:03:54       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:54       First of all, you're basically spending this giant roulette wheel and even on the real weapon roulette wheel, they got it, you know, green zero in Dutton, the double green zero. And just that alone, that alone will completely fuck you over. Now obviously you guys hopefully listen to his podcast long enough to know that I am not a mathematician, so I cannot explain why, but just having those two will fuck you over. But what's it faces? The, uh, we were fortunate. I got like fucking, I swear to God, it's like two or three bankrupts lose a turn. Just every two seconds. You just hear that fucking reverse flute thing or they go bankrupt and then it comes to their big price. Well, they try to act like they're gonna. They gonna throw down some goddamn cash. The last one, it's so fucking difficult, but we're going to get some letters for you then get some letters for you. Me Get some letters for me. You know the fucking answer. And they act like it's weird when only like one letter, they only get one letter. Right. Then he'd be like, okay, give me, give me three fucking letters in a vile p f owl if a, and then it's always like

Speaker 1:          00:05:09       great guesses, but you're not gonna like this. We only got one letter. It's just like, you know, do the best you can. They always fuck them over. But this lady, this lady, she actually did okay and she won the prize. She didn't do okay. She fucking crushed it.

Speaker 4:          00:05:25       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:05:25       I came in to say keep your hands to yourself or something like that was solving like, no, this is a phrase.

Speaker 4:          00:05:31       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:05:32       Like who would ever come up with that on a fucking game? She'll keep your hands to yourself with something on that level. It's like semi aggressive slash you know, date rapey and it's on a fucking game show and she somehow got it.

Speaker 4:          00:05:45       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:05:46       There is a point at the end of this, right. And she ends up winning this fucking to see some sort of Mazda is some shit's not a Miata. I don't know what the fuck it was. Sue. Suki, I have no idea.

Speaker 4:          00:05:58       It was a two seat sports car. And um, okay.

Speaker 1:          00:06:03       Immediately my first thought was I looked at me, I was just like, he can't get a kid in there. And then she laughed. She's like, ah, look, yeah, becoming a dad. And I'm like, no, no, I'm still young and cool. But she was right. You know, not becoming a dad. I am a god Damn Damn, but I'm not going to be one as douchey dead. It talks about how parents who stalks about how fucking difficult their lives. It's fucking awesome. But having a kid when you're in your 20s and you're broke sucks, you know, but when you travel in the country and their pay and your money to talk about your dicks and do fucking dicks talking about your Dick and do shit jokes, it's not dead bed. I'm only on the road like six days of fucking month, you know, let's say flying at night early to go watch the fucking Bruins and Celtics Assam Shit for our schedules line up.

Speaker 1:          00:06:54       Um, uh, that, that I'm here and she's cool as shit. Man. She doesn't really cry. She only cries, you know, needs a diaper change, wants to be held, you know, it's hungry. Other than that, she totally Chels she's met a bunch of people. She doesn't freak out with strangers. One of the best compliments I got was like, oh your kid's really, uh, cause a really relaxed, healthy baby. You know what I mean? Which I'm fucking site cause that's what I want it. I obviously healthy, but I want to fucking chill baby. I don't want, like, I basically don't want my kid to be like me. That's why I got to keep up with this meditating because I didn't do it for a minute. And the, Oh, the old gray mare, she a, I started fucking going back to what the fuck I was, you know, like I fucking, uh, I was trying to, you know, sneak out of the bedroom because I was going to go work out because I'm a fucking fat cupcake Eaton dose. And um,

Speaker 1:          00:08:02       Nina just opens your eyes and just goes, could you change a really quick, I just stopped and I looked her and I said, you really need to work on your good mornings. She's like, sorry, could morning. And even though I was right, my tone was just, it was way too, you know, I was like, Dad, uh, I always say Liam Neeson Niamh Niamh Leeson lease them. I don't know, whatever. I took it too far, which kills me. That's why I love meditating because I don't take it too far. And if I make a point, I'm still right, but when I don't meditate, you know, I'd basically, I walk around at a six, you know, like saying 10 is completely losing your shit. I walk around, I'm just walking down the street with a fucking balloon on my wrist at a six to a seven. So it's very easy for me to go write the 10 unless I meditate.

Speaker 1:          00:08:58       Then that backs me down to about four or three, which still is pretty high, but it's kind of cut my number almost in half. The what kills me is when I'm not meditating and I'm up around a six or seven, you know, it gets to that point, even if I'm right, my reaction gives them this, this wiggle room, you know, some Bill Clinton wiggle room to get the fuck out of it. You know, some Trump executive order thing to go around some shit. Um, so, uh, you know, so I gotta I gotta see, I gotta stay on that type of shit, dude. Speaking of fucking Niamh Niamh Gleason, why can't it, you know, it's one of those fuckers goes by so fucking quick. You never really even hear it. No, Bill. We all hear it. You don't know. May Look, okay. Get this guy's fucking name right. He's great actor here. It Niamh.

Speaker 4:          00:09:50       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:09:51       Oh No, it's Liam Neeson is first names not Liam is it is

Speaker 1:          00:10:00       Niamh Lisa, whatever. I'll never get that right. I'm never going to get that fucking right. Anyways, a fucking head of hair on that son of a bitch. Um, anyways, I saw a fucking great movie this week. So Saturday nights, Saturday, Saturday we go out and uh, we actually have a date night, so we'll be like, all right, well go get maybe like dinner and a movie. Well, it basically turned about appetizer and a drink and I'm sitting there like, you know, I'm on the wagon, I can't do it. He was like, oh, just fucking have one. So I was like, all right, I'll have one still on the wagon, you know, I'm not like a fucking alcoholic or I just got to shut the whole thing off, you know what I mean? So I had one, I had a cognac. Oh, fucking corn. Yeah. Can I just say, you know, I just ordered the best one that they had, you know, so it tasted amazing, but it was also like drinking gasoline so that can only sip it. And we got like an appetizer and then we just sat there, you know?

Speaker 4:          00:11:02       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:03       Shooting the shit. It felt weird because we hadn't been out together in a while. And then we just started talking about our daughter and looking at pictures of her. It's like two addicts going out, you know what I mean? At some point you're going to start talking about blow and how much fun it is. Um, so then, you know, after that we walked up the street, we went to the movie theater and uh, we saw get out, um, the Jordan Peele fee, uh, film dude. It was fucking him. That was amazing. It got to go see it. I know there's, you know, there's always that movie and he's like, dude, you gotta go fucking see it. And it doesn't live up to the eye. It lived up to the hype man. It was fucking great. And what I loved, what I loved about it. And what I love about all fucking movies like is, so it was a bunch of shit in there that you had, he left you to figure out yourself.

Speaker 1:          00:12:00       And I saw the movie like two, three days ago, Saturday, and that was a Monday, two days ago, you know, and I keep evil, I'm driving, I'm still thinking about the movie. I was like, Oh fuck, that was this and this meant dad and this was over here and this person's ad like, you know, it was the perfect length, the whole thing and the acting and it was unbelievable. Um, dude, that fucking guys swear to God, man. That's like one of the most talented people to come around in a long, long time, you know, to be that good at like, you know, the characters they did on a sketch show and the writing. And then on top of that you can direct, I mean, these kind of fucking limitless as far as talent goes, but if you haven't seen it yet before somebody ruins it, you got to go check it out. All right, there's my, I never do a movie plugs, so there you go. There's one for you. Um, so we ended up going to that thing and uh, I know what the fuck we did after that thing. We just came straight home. Oh, I know. Walked up to my car and for some reason the fucking lights were on.

Speaker 4:          00:13:08       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:09       Because cars are so God damn confusing. Like wherever the fuck my lights used to be. Boosie the automatic, he just turned the car on and they fucking come on at night. Like somehow the lights sense night. Fucking creepy is that, and I did the manual one and now that it's on the manual and I can't figure out where the fuck to put it. So now I always have to do it and now I'm like, you know, but you know, kills me with today's technology is I left those things on, went and had a drink and an appetizer and then saw like a fucking whatever, whatever that movies, 90 minutes. I won 45 minute movie and I came back. My car is still started up back in the day. You are fucked.

Speaker 4:          00:13:49       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:49       Everybody had jumper cables, doe, can you give me a jump? Do you mind if I ate to bar the, can you give me a jump? And it was always like the shittiest fucking car ever. And you're like, ah man, Naw man, a kid, a kid. Now you can just say, no, I can't. The big, why not? It's like, well what? Today's technology, it's pointless for me to ever look under my hood. I just take it down to the dealer and they deal with everything. I don't even know where the battery is and I can guarantee fucking to you when I, when I fucking lift up the hood I got, I'd probably have to remove something to get to one of the terminals. So I don't know why you're not a member of AAA, but I don't want it to tell you. And I leave and I get my car and I drive away from a fellow American. You understand me? Do what's going on with the fucking Celtics.

Speaker 1:          00:14:40       We've lost six of the last 11 games. They're five and six and now the wizards, the Wiz ease on down, ease on down the row home. I never really realized that until a buddy of mine has been giving me Shit, you know, cause they're wizards amp and playing well against the Celtics and just point great to share. They slid into a second place and I just keep trashing about the name. I like the bullets is too violent, you know, which I understand because the city was so violent back in the day, you know, but to go from being the bullets, which I used to think, you know, number one with a bullet, that's how I always looked at it off faster than a speeding bullet. Superman Shit. I didn't think like, you know, the team was embracing gang violence out on the street. It was like pro crack.

Speaker 1:          00:15:31       It's such stupid shit. I fucking hate when they, so then what do they do? What are the soccer moms fucking political correct. Police who for some fucking stupid reason think that they're the eggs, progressive people and think that they can just, Oh, we'll change words if we change words. It changes to reception. No, it doesn't. No, it doesn't. If your parents would dopes racist country, that's what the fuck your kids going to be. That's it. Unless your kid is lucky enough to win a rack with somebody within the group that your parents used to fucking trash, they maybe he got some day like you don't just change a word and it's this fairy dust that sprinkles over somebody's heart and you'd change the thought. It's so fucking dumb. All it did was just become a way to lose your job because you said the wrong fucking word. And then what? The person who uses the word, then they realize it after they lose a job. Oh, now I'm not racist or homophobic. It's so fucking dumb. So they've gone right down to these stupid fucking team names. I love how they changed the bullets, but not the Redskins.

Speaker 1:          00:16:40       You know? I think it'd be got, you get like the fucking a victim. If they ever changed the Redskins, it'd be like, yeah, I get that. I get that. Like the Indians, you know, it's like, all right. You know, we weren't from fucking, we weren't, you know, Columbus didn't understand that there was a real world. This shit's even real. Who the fuck knows? There was no tape recorders. This guy didn't have a fucking diary, but other story was told was that he was like, Nah, man, the world is fucking round.

Speaker 4:          00:17:09       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:17:10       this guy had the balls.

Speaker 4:          00:17:13       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:13       Sky had the fucking balls to, to start going towards where they thought you'd go off the edge of the earth in a fucking boat.

Speaker 4:          00:17:22       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:23       You know, I don't know why the water, it makes it more scary, but you know, if anybody just sat around and thought about Saturday until the world is fucking flat.

Speaker 4:          00:17:30       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:31       Um, how is it the water just running off the edges here.

Speaker 4:          00:17:35       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:36       Did they not have counters and sinks? I guess they didn't, did they have plumbing at that point? It, you know, the Romans did fucking Eden's banging each other in the goddamn bathrooms there, whatever. They eight til he had puke rooms just eat until you fucking puke. So I would actually think, well, at the very least, even if it is flat, the fact that there's still water in the ocean, there's gotta be land on the other side holding it in. Right?

Speaker 4:          00:18:03       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:18:04       But not all, Christopher Columbus, not all crazy. It was like, no, fuck that. I'm going to get to the West indies, whatever the fuck I was, I'm going to get to India.

Speaker 2:          00:18:15       I'm going the other way.

Speaker 1:          00:18:19       You fucking sky the balls to sail out that way. Sales out that way. And then he thinks, well fuck these people must be Indian. You know, that's just sort of like, oh, are you Arab? I thought you were Italian. I mean, it's at that level of offensive, like, I mean, would you really get that offended? Like, no, I'm fucking Arab. How dare you? Well, what do you got against Italians? You can't, sorry.

Speaker 2:          00:18:48       Anyways, um,

Speaker 1:          00:18:52       speaking of which, I don't understand all these people going into ancestry.com why you would go to a fucking website and let them take a swab of your saliva. I get eight. How fucking dumb or people,

Speaker 4:          00:19:02       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:19:04       Oh my God, I didn't realize, you know, I'm also Swahili. Whenever the fuck, why don't always pick swell, Uli. I was taking Romania. I didn't understand that. We show so Hungarian. Great. Now I know why I like Goulash one eighth of the time.

Speaker 4:          00:19:26       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:19:26       At this point is so fucking far removed and I don't understand why people are sitting there acting like there's any sort of culture there. Is it all right? It's just like what I saw in the Greater Phoenix area. There's a new patch of land, you know, you fucking clear it out. You put a bunch of houses down and then you slam down a fucking strip ball. Sorry, I got to do this podcast before, but daughter wakes up here. Um, yeah, they slept on a fucking strip mall and they just continue to progress that. That's basically, you know, then there's a cheesecake factory. They get a frozen yogurt place and that's what has become, okay. There's no, there's no culture left. Is there? I mean that is the culture. I just sounds like one of the douchey talk show right now, there is no culture.

Speaker 4:          00:20:19       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20:19       And this is what needs to stop. We have to stop these strip malls. All right. Do you have a solution? Uh, no I don't. I just don't like cvs anchored strip malls.

Speaker 4:          00:20:30       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:20:31       There was a bunch of people out the other day, you know, you don't want, you just have like shit to do. I go Saturday, right. And, uh, it's rained a bunch when we were out here with some fucking idiot politicians said the drought's over. It's like, no, it isn't. It's never over. It's just in a good place right now. When is it going to rain again? You don't know snow. You going to let people go back to taking long fucking showers. I never do that out here.

Speaker 4:          00:20:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20:57       I shut, I turn it on and shut off the water like fucking five times. When I take a shower, I turn it on, you know, get yourself wet, you know? And then you shut it off, set yourself up, then you turn it back on, rinse yourself off. He shut it off. And that's it. So it says, standing there under the cascading water, you know, like he's some sort of, God.

Speaker 4:          00:21:19       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:21:20       Then I like to think a lot of people try to do that. At least my wife does it. She fucking turns a thing on his fucking walking around, you know, she's one of those chill people. She hasn't, she hasn't think about shit like that. You know? I guess what I'm trying to say is I'm a better person in my wife and I don't know how to bring that up. If you guys know a good way to word it. Like how can I basically say, you know what it is honey. I guess at the end of the day I'm just,

Speaker 4:          00:21:50       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:21:50       I'm just a better person than you are. I just already pictured her rolling her eyes anyways. Um, the fuck was my point. All right. Yeah. So Indians. Okay. That's like fucking,

Speaker 4:          00:22:05       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:22:06       that's almost kind of funny. Like now you're fucking dope. You like 6,000 miles away from what you think you are. I guess it was probably funny at first they started chopping people's arms off cause they couldn't fucking get some gold for the holes in his teeth. And who the fuck am I to say what's offensive way? But you would think that red skin that would be at the top of the fucking list over bullets. You know, it's the worst one. The fact that the Tampa Bay devil rays and now just the race, you know, that's when you know you got to move. That's when you just sit like, wait a minute, are there enough Jesus freaks in this area that the local team has to appease their, you know, hocus pocus bullshit. I mean devil rays that isn't, that isn't then that an actual name of like some sort of sting ray. I have no idea. Maybe it is. Maybe it isn't. All I know is that that guy's first name is Liam. It sounds too close. Like Lima, like Lyme disease. Um, alright. Devil Ray.

Speaker 4:          00:23:17       Hey, we go. Yeah. Let me see here.

Speaker 1:          00:23:25       All I'm seeing is pictures of fucking sting rays, giant ones with the fucking, you know, like they're flying through the water. If somebody can explain to me how that makes you move forward when they make you go up to the surface.

Speaker 4:          00:23:40       Yeah.

As you can see, I've made my dreams come true. I'm a man in the world.

Speaker 4:          00:36:47       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:36:47       You know, there's a lot of guys out there, you know, my dad always said a man should own a nice watch. What else did he say? And I get the fuck out of here. I'm taking a shit. You know? What else did he say that was so fucking deep baby? You know what? Maybe at a nice calm, relaxed, relaxing person in your life. Maybe you did. I'm always jealous of that. When I see like calm families, they've gotta be bored shitless though. There's going to be, you know what? I would actually be willing to guess that the child that is more likely to just go fucking nuts. You know what I mean? Take out the family car, you know, throw a hatchet over somebody's head is going to come from a calm family after awhile. It's stupid. No it isn't.

Speaker 4:          00:37:38       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37:38       I'm just saying it's possible. Just the fucking monotony of it. I give it go to Disneyland and you fucking worn out and then he just started hearing. It's a small world and it just keeps going over and over again and you slowly fill yourself, like losing your sanity there, right there is why I don't believe in heaven or hell. You know what I mean? I just don't believe in it. It doesn't make any fucking sense.

Speaker 4:          00:38:06       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:38:09       like if heaven was, if it was just having the whole fucking time, heaven would eventually become health because it would just be so fucking nice and everybody would just be walking around isn't as great. Oh my God, it's gay. Can you believe how great this is? This is just fucking great. It's quite like every fucking day, and at some point you're gonna be like, ah, it's fucking gray. You know?

Speaker 4:          00:38:33       Like, what do you do

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       for the rest of your fucking life? You just sitting there and it's always the same. It's just awesome. It never rains. There's no disappointments. There's no challenges. There's no funny stories to tell anymore. Hey, you remember, remember, remember that time when it was awesome? Yeah, it's always awesome, right? Then if you're in hell, oh, I'm fine. No, I'm fine. I've got, I'm, I'm fire. Uh, fire after a while, you know? Um, yeah, I'm on fire. I can't yell anymore. This just become normal. I don't even remember what my fucking life was like before it got here. I Dunno. I guess how well you can actually see how that would suck. I said I just don't get heaven. I don't want to fucking be like, you know, at some point there's some apps to happen. Um, so as I'm riding around in my fucking all angel white bicycle, at some point you got to get a flat, right?

Speaker 4:          00:39:37       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:39:37       Did immediately somebody would be there to help, help you out. They just be saying a bunch of Nice Shit too. I would slowly just start crying. I would just whisper at some point. You like cheeses. I told chief as I can make. I know. It's just weird. I understand. I'm not, I'm not trying to be, that guy's not appreciative, but could you just say no, cause you just call me a cunt or something? Could you fucking just slap me with you the Sandal? You know, can you just imagine the look on his face as he just sits there? You know, not saying anything as you talk yourself into a corner and she's sort of looking at, you know, when people look at you and they go from one eye to the other, right? Or your left eye, your right eye, left eye, and he likes his mother. Motherfuckers trying to get in my head right now. The son of God is trying to get in my fucking head. Then you got to explain it to the bosses son. Why you don't like heaven? Not that you don't like it, but it's just like, can, can you make it rain every once in a while? Can it be that dog that's just fucking barking right as I'm going to sleep? Come. Can we just have that?

Speaker 1:          00:40:48       Does every fucking dog have to behave itself?

Speaker 4:          00:40:52       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:40:52       why can't I say that word? Jesus. Why can't I say that word? My disrupted it. What are you going to do now? Send me down to hell. It's over. I already passed the test. All right. Can somebody be annoyed? What's fucking something up here? Look at everybody looking at, well,

Speaker 4:          00:41:10       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:41:11       these fucking God smiles on their faces. It's creepy cheeses. I don't know. Would you want to fucking be like, it's like you joined a cult, all of these fucking, you know what I mean? If I was running shit, I would make religion illegal. It would just be fucking, I would just take it all away from everybody, you know? I will answer what I would do. I would have, I would have a fucking crew, robots, you know, to infiltrate every fucking religion. And then at, when I made it illegal, they would join the radicalized people in every group. Right. And then they would just wipe them all out. You don't, and then you'd have to listen to the whining and the crying and people that remembered fucking religion and all, he just, he just take the whole fucking thing away. And the new religion is, hey, I don't know what the fuck happens after you die, you know? But you know, let's be nice to each other and then that's it. Okay. No walking on water. No, never running out of fish part and CS. I don't know about anybody else's religion. I don't know what the fuck, but I know there's always some fucking crazy thing that you know, didn't happen and everybody acts like it happened. It didn't happen. Who is painted on a fucking cave wall and somebody elaborated on it.

Speaker 4:          00:42:44       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:42:44       I Dunno, I get rid of all personally. I'm just, I'm just talking for myself personally. I would get rid of it. Um, but yeah, by the way, guess what I'm doing on March 29th out here in Los Angeles. All right. If you are, um, if you're in Los Angeles and you're a guns and roses fan and you like reading their books about the band, I've read every fucking one of them. Um, I read slashes, I read Steven ad was, I read, uh, the kid from canter's. Do you know, knew the band, took all the pictures. I have that fucking book. And uh, recently, I dunno, I dunno when she put it out, but Deanna Adler, Steven Adler, his mom wrote a book, sweet child of mine. And, um, especially if you, if you, you should read this, you should read Steven's first. You know, you get his version of the hell he went through as an addict and then you get his mother's version, which is unbelievable. And you know what would be a fucking amazing is if you could go down and meet her at a book signing at Barnes and noble at the Grove on March 29th I believe it starts at 7:00 PM and you go down there and you could fucking meet the mother. The best fucking one of the best dramas, the 80s my personal opinion, and you know, it'd be even more fucking amazing, is it followed them, came on my podcast and I got to interview him. Oh Shit. Is there a special Monday morning podcast coming up this week?

Speaker 1:          00:44:24       Wouldn't that be incredible? Why? What would it be like if Steven Adler, you guys all know how much I fucking love him. He's mother Adler and then that brother Jamie had, they're all came on my fucking podcast. What would that be like? We'll be out. Like if they all came on at the same time and there was this big happy family that just sat there interrupting each other. And you felt like you were at their fucking dinner table. How fucking cool would that be if I did a podcast like that? Well, it's going to happen. It already happened. I already recorded it and um, I'll wait till you guys listen to it. But, um, I had so much fun with them and their mother is an absolute salt of the earth sweetheart and she has a book signing and um, she's all excited slash nervous that no one's going to show up, you know, as you know, same way when I put out a special, what if nobody watches it?

Speaker 1:          00:45:17       So I'm, I'm going to be hyping this, um, right up until March 29th. Um, it would be such a great thing if there was a bunch of people down there. I'm going to be down there standing in line with the rest of you is, uh, probably get down there. I don't know, probably like around eight ish. They get starts at like seven, but I'll be down there around h just because I get it. I get some fucking thing. I'm taping right before, but, um, yeah, I did a special podcast. I get to meet Steven Adler and I'm still fucking freaking out. And, uh, and I'll, I'll wait till you guys listen to the interview and then I'll tell you all the fucking cool stories. All right, here we go. Let's, let's plow ahead here. Oh, my Bruins beat the fucking fly as, oh, at that little fucking prayer of his shot at the end.

Speaker 1:          00:46:02       Not a prayer, just put it on net. Somehow it found its way to the back of the net Bruins pickup by huge two points, Bruins a playing great. Um, and as are the Canadians, which, um, I don't like the Canadians, but I'm happy for Khloe, Julian, you know, and uh, I'm actually, you know what? I think the Bruins might have been right to make a move at this point. I think, uh, it's just one of those things with coaching after awhile, even if the person is great, even if they won your cup, it's just, it's just part of coaching. At some point. They just show you the door. But, um, we're playing great. We look a lot better than we did. So I think maybe both. It's worked out in the fucking Canadians are playing better with Cloe. Julian, all my friends in this business who are have fans, they keep texting me saying that they love and the guy, so I guess it worked out for everybody.

Speaker 1:          00:46:50       So there you go. And Clode went from original fucking six, two original six. Um, there you go. All right. So anyways, let's plow ahead here. Um, let's read some of the, uh, some of the fucking, whenever you call them for this week. The uh, the questions. Alright, DDP Yoga. Hey Bill, first of all, thank you very much for your consistently amazing podcasts. Well, thank you for listening. Thank you for doing what you do, sir. Or ma'am. I absolutely love it. To be honest with you. I feel like it's getting, it's, I feel like getting it for free is too much. I'd gladly pay five to 10 bucks a month for all the content you're releasing. You don't need to do that. I'm fucking, I'm doing great with the advertising. You know, that's why I fuck around during the advertising because that's how I fucking make money. But I know you guys are going to fast forward to it unless I keep peppering it with Fox and cons. That's it. It's a very simple formula. Anyhow, he said, I want to get in touch and address your self proclaimed dad bod.

Speaker 4:          00:47:57       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:47:58       Have you ever heard of or looked into DDP Yoga?

Speaker 4:          00:48:03       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:48:04       Uh, if not, maybe the name Diamond Dave Dallas page rings a bell, former WC, WWE wrestling wrestler and all around. Great Guy. After leaving the wrestling business, he devoted himself to getting his body back in peak condition, even through wrassling, even though wrassling is his quote fake, it definitely takes a toll. Yeah. They beat the shit out of their bodies. Um, long story short, he went from being a guy who wouldn't be caught dead in a yoga studio to trying it after all else failed to develop his own system and helping thousands of people completely revitalize their lives. And I can tell you from personal experience, it's fucking great. No bullshit, no fluff, no one's structures, structures, calmly whispering about Schapera alignment is that he say Chakra Schapera. It's about consistently performing the physical and mental exercises that will have you operating at your best. This is a commercial healing, nagging aches and pains, increasing your endurance gating, mental clarity, et cetera.

Speaker 1:          00:49:10       Like I said, no fluff. Here's the video that got me to take a chance on it. It's not too late for you, Billy. I hope you'll check it out. Thanks again for the God damn podcast. All the best to you and your family. Uh, that actually read like a commercial. But you know what, I don't give a shit. It's a physical fitness thing and so many people have taken yoga and done in a different way. You know, cause there is that thing. If you really like a wound up psycho to go into a yoga class and the tone with which that they speak is a little jarring, you know,

Speaker 4:          00:49:44       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:49:44       To be in your cargo. Oh you're fucking caught the lightest weight. You could have made it

Speaker 4:          00:49:50       okay

Speaker 1:          00:49:50       to then being like, how is everyone feeling today? I know the traffic was kind of bad. I hope. I hope you're not bringing that energy in here. Is it slowly walking around lighting these smelly fucking things, you know, and as you're talking to the person next to you, just go and immediately you just want to like, I dunno, just slowly roll up your mat and just walk out. Like I can't, like I get it, I get, I need to chill out, but I can't feel like,

Speaker 4:          00:50:31       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:50:31       you know, you know where it just becomes like this asexual thing wherever you were just kind of like, hey man, was just kinda, you know, everybody's just like, we're all like one, you know, we're like plants. Um, that's a little fucking jarring. I'll give it a shot. I've actually been meaning to do it because I keep having setbacks with my fucking shoulder. Um, which is really frustrating. But, um, most of it is diet. So, uh, whenever I get in shape, the first thing I do is I cut out the booze and, um, all I really need to, I need to go like 46 days without any booze. Even just having that one cognac didn't really do anything. Like I had the one and then immediately my buddy's like, hey, why don't we have 50 more? But I had to go to the movie and then I was fine.

Speaker 1:          00:51:17       Um, and then the second I'm in there and the bus starts to wear off. I think I'll thank God I didn't have 15 more. Not to mention I got to drive. Right. Um, I'm going to give it a shot. I just think if I did yoga, I did have to do in the morning before the little one wakes up. Um, she's so fucking awesome, dude. I'm telling you right. You'll never regret it. I guess you know when you'll get it. If you have a kid with somebody that you're not love with, I guess that that would suck. But at the end of the day, the kid is still awesome. It's a hell of a door price, I'll tell you that, right? Oh, I'll tell you. All right. Trans wrestling. Hey there, I'm already gonna Watch this. If this is what I think it is a there Billy boo. Ah, did you hear the story about the Trans girl going through home hormone treatment who was still wrestling girls in high school? His slash her defense is that it's a low dose of testosterone and it does not allow for any competitive advantage.

Speaker 1:          00:52:16       Wait a minute. Isn't that what Hg ages? That's human growth hormone. Well, I guess I don't think human growth hormone. I don't know why. I don't know what kind of hormones they take. Um, having said that, I'm not sure I'd let my daughter Rasul a girl who had any edge at all. Even if it's a tiny bit of extra strength. It could be the difference in breaking a bone. Thoughts. Would you let your daughter wrestle in that situation? Uh, yeah. Yeah. I would then take a break. A fucking bone, you know what I mean? How many times do people break a bone and wrestling? Does that really happen? They just fucking on each other the whole time. It's like a, you know, like that official level shit. Not that, not the fun shit, the stone cold shit that the actual official college shit, it's like a, it's like competitive spooning. You know what I mean? It's like one person is trying to spoon with the other person. The other person is like, I want to be this, the Spooner, not the spoonie. That's basically what's going on. They don't like, you know. No, I wouldn't be concerned about that.

Speaker 1:          00:53:28       Yeah. I'm one of those debts.

Speaker 4:          00:53:30       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:53:31       well the kids crying going away. You know, she's already half a guy. I'd be driving her. As far as I know. She's still a girl, so suck it up. You want to pay them? Well then you gotta wrestle half of too. That's a thing. I don't want to hear another word out again. I'd be like dead.

Speaker 4:          00:53:52       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:53:53       Why don't you embrace the opportunity to be like, well, here we go. If this is actually a fucking advantage, all this is going to do is make me better. You know what I mean? And then he could go up there and give you a record 27 and oak against hundred percent chicks

Speaker 1:          00:54:10       and wanted to get someone who's happened to, right. You got to with Bryce, it mean, what does that person supposed to do? There's not enough fucking people that are going through what the fuck she's going through to fit any of the side, you know, I think it's, I think it's a cool thing. Fuck it. Who gives a shit? Look, there's already going to be that fucking monster anyways, so some woman's going to walk in there and just going to be blessed with frontier strength. You know what I mean? Chopping wood strength is going to be that person anyways. Uh, I mean I guess if she was actually, if she was trying to get a scholarship in a loss could potentially affect it. Um, maybe. Yeah, but I gotta be honest with you. I think, um,

Speaker 1:          00:55:10       I dunno, I would visit father. I'd be like cycle MLC. I you do. This is actually an advantage. This is a great fucking opportunity to, you become a, for you to become a better wrestler. There's no money on the line. Who gives a fuck? Let's go. Let me tell you something, brother. Come this Saturday when my daughter wrestles a good stat. Half a dude. What are you going to do when these pythons run wild on your eyes? I get up for it. I wouldn't give a shit. Fuck it. Um, yeah. Many guys in Europe. So the is from Yemen, Yemen, Yemen, Yemen, and he, how the fuck do you say that guy in Europe. All right. Hey Bill, I'm a Yemeni guy. Who is better? I hope I'm saying that right. No disrespect here. Who's been living in Europe for the past six fucking years?

Speaker 4:          00:56:04       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:56:04       Although everything is going all right. I want to ask your advice because I can relate to your personality. Hang on a second sir. Or ma'am, I want to fucking figure out where the fuck. I'm assuming you're from Yemen. What is yeah. Many. What is a yummy whom to whom is a, is a Yemenite. Oh yeah. Why did that all disappear? What is a Yemeni

Speaker 4:          00:56:39       come on.

Speaker 1:          00:56:42       Alright. Relating to Yemen or it's people. Holy Shit. I was right.

Speaker 4:          00:56:47       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:56:47       That's a nice flag. They got a nice flag. I like just to three bars.

Speaker 4:          00:56:52       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:56:53       I'm a big three bar flag guy. France, Italy, Ireland, Yemen. I'm all right. What do you guys think of the new Russian flag? I kinda liked the old one. The old one was the shit all red with that sickle. I thought the, I thought that that one was fucking dope. The new ones. All right. What is it? Red, white and blue. Holy Shit. They got the same colors as us. Is that one? Is it something like that? I Dunno that was watching this whole thing about flatter me or putting poison in these guys and shit. Allegedly. I have no idea. So watching it on 60 minutes so it's gotta be true, right? Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick. You. How many guys in your or I've been over there for the last six fucking years. I want to ask you a question cause I can relate to personally. My family has been living in a war zone in Yemen for the past two years.

Speaker 1:          00:57:47       Our old house, our old house there was bombed and my father was inside, but the lucky bastard came out without a scratch. I miss them and wish I could help them, but that's kind of not possible now. All right before the, I already feel like this is going to be way over my head. Before that I lost some good old friends that I knew for more than 10 years because of some stupid incidents was beaten by a gang of more than 15 men in Malaysia on a trip there for no reason. And my two year ex girlfriend at the time cheated on me with their current boyfriend isn't fucking amazing. This guy's from the other side of the planet and then seek sex, same shit, gang violence and you fucking girl got sick of you and fucking bang somebody else.

Speaker 4:          00:58:37       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:58:38       cheated on me with her current boyfriend while I was on that trip, I guess to Malaysia, it didn't have the decency to break up with me before that. She was my first, uh, you know, what are you going to do? People are young, they don't know how to break up. So they wait til you go to Malaysia and they fucked somebody, man. That this is a time honored tradition of how to break up with somebody. All right, so if you're with your first love, what have we learned? Do not go by yourself to Malaysia. I don't know how many times I brought that up on this podcast. You cannot go to fucking Malaysia. All right. I just graduated from college. I have a beautiful girlfriend, which I love and feel blessed with what I have. I know that I an asshole at certain moments in my life, but I changed a long time ago and I'm still trying to be more honest, clear and focus.

Speaker 1:          00:59:28       Well, welcome to the club, sir. I'm currently looking for a job in Germany and we'll try to apply after that for a German passport, which will make my life much easier and allow me to start a company and sustain myself without being dependent on others. Exactly. You want to work for yourself. I know that you have lived certain moments in your life where you are faced by challenged, faced with challenges that might have taught a lesson, but at the same time left a mark on your self confidence. How did you empower yourself and what advice would you give a young man like me confronting life's challenges that said, fuck face. Congratulations on your baby and fuck you. Now there's a guy, okay, who speaks at least three languages and still is able to break balls. Isn't that amazing? He's probably speaks Yemeni, Yemenite, Yemen, Asian, whatever the fuck he speaks. Right? He's knows that one. He's in Germany. So he's got his speak that language on to via you in this space. Right. And he can also speak English.

Speaker 2:          01:00:33       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:00:35       How did I empower myself?

Speaker 2:          01:00:36       Uh,

Speaker 1:          01:00:39       I used to just say shit out loud to myself. You know, when I would feel the dark cloud of doubt coming in, I would just, you know, and it took me a while, but I would, I would, um, but I mean, I wasn't facing what you are, you're facing being an immigrant. So I mean, you're facing way more than I did in the, but the fact that, uh, I know you're trying to become a better person. You know what, you know, to reach out for help and all that. I, I think I, my gut says you're going to be fine. Well, you have to do in general is when the doubt comes in. You got to beat the shit out of it. You know you have to, the biggest thing is, is that you're conscious that this of the self doubt. So once you're conscious of it, you can then address it. It's when you, when you're really young and you're not conscious of it and that thought comes in and then you start dwelling on it and then it just washes over your whole body and you can literally, you know, have a fucking panic attack.

Speaker 1:          01:01:46       Would you have to do, I did anyways is um,

Speaker 2:          01:01:51       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:01:52       You know, you try to cancel it out with a positive thought. I know this sounds like hokey shit, but I used to just say shit out loud. I read some book one where, and it started off with like, I would just be walking down the street, you know, walking by other people and I would just really be just be like, yeah, fuck, fuck. He looking at me like I was nuts, but I was like, fuck that negative thought man. Wouldn't yell it. But I would, I would kind of just say fuck that. Fuck that. No, it isn't. No one has it, right? No, it won't or whatever the hell it was. And then it just became like when I moved to New York and I'm trying to get into the clubs, I knew I was going to get in. But you know, if the day to day just seemed like a

Speaker 1:          01:02:40       like impossible and you know, the club owners and everything and you know, some of them were cool and others enjoyed the fact that you were desperate and just really enjoyed that position of power over you. And I would walk out of the club dejected, you know, I was afraid, you know, am I going to run out of money? I don't have a job right now. I'm doing these driving back to Massachusetts to fucking feature in Dick Doherty's rooms that was not barely covering, you know, living in New York every time you stepped outside your blue, 20 bucks, 30 bucks, you know, and um,

Speaker 4:          01:03:20       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:03:20       I just first started, I what I said was, I'm tougher than you. New York is still what I would say, as Hokey as that sounds. That's what they, you know, the city would kick me in the balls and then I would just mumble that to myself sometimes, like six times in a row until I got that thought on my head. And I would just say, and then I would just pick, I'm going to get in the clubs, I'm going to get in and I'm going to make a living. I'm going to be fine, I'm going to be fine. Everything's gonna be fine. Fuck that. Fuck that. Fuck that. I mean something like that. That's what I had to do. And um,

Speaker 4:          01:04:02       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:04:02       And then it just, you know, and that continues to rot your fucking life and uh, you know, then you get to my age, you know, and I'm doing great and everything, but there's also, there's always your mortality around the fucking corner and how I've kind of mentally dealt with death, the inevitable death is that like, um, that I just think it's going to be a great experience. You know what I mean? That, uh, I don't think anything bad happens to you when you die, either. You just go into the ground and then that's it. And, uh, then that's it. You know, you got to be a person on this planet as opposed to like a fucking mosquito. You got the best fucking experience. Hopefully you did. Um, and then that's it. It's fucking over. Or did you become something else? And I just don't think that is bad.

Speaker 4:          01:05:03       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:05:04       You know, I just don't think that it doesn't make any sense that it would then just be bad. Um, I don't know. I hope that helps you. I got a little off the rails there. So what I would say is you just baby your way, you know? And like for me, making it as a comedian was like a 20 year fucking 15, 20 year process. I was obviously, I was not the overnight, I didn't have the hook, I didn't have any of that fucking shit. And I just basically, every day, you know, was fucking hacking at the tree until it came down. And, um,

Speaker 1:          01:05:43       you know, you just don't quit. You just, that's it. You just don't quit. You don't give it a negative thought and every day you just fucking take a few steps towards it and then one day you just wake up and your way you want it to be and you're like, how the fuck did that happen? He didn't. He was funny. You don't feel any different, you know, so, um, but she'll be all right. I think you're going to be all right. You know, you speak three different fucking languages. You can break balls and English. I mean you sound, you sound like you've got a great sense of humor and you're trying to get, you're going to be fine. Just say that to yourself. I'm going to be fine. This is going to work out and then that's it. Then you can try to fucking help somebody else out along the way. All right, last one here. Documentary recommendations. Hey. Oh Billy. Oh Billy. Beat down. I was wondering if you had heard of the, this new documentary that just came out called ice guardians. It's about the history of enforcers and hockey, and I would love to hear your take on it if you haven't seen it. I watch all of these fucking things. Um, I haven't seen it, but I watched the trailer and it looked great. Um,

Speaker 1:          01:06:53       I don't know about the name. Ice Guardians. That sounds somewhere between a superhero movie and, um, a musical, a musical on ice

Speaker 1:          01:07:07       coming to Madison Square Garden. It's ice guardians, Fossey hands skating around the ice. Um, he said, thanks for all the laughs and for always making me feel better about the way I read things out loud. Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. Here's the link to the trailer. Okay, I'll, I'll send out this link here to the trailer. By the way. Um, I'm going to be at the south by southwest on Tuesday. I'm flying in Tuesday.
