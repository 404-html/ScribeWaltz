Speaker 1:          00:02:33       You fucking guts getting to big start wearing sport coats on stage. These are the, this, this, that's the classy way. That's the classy way to just gracefully, you know, go from being young NT. You're middle aged and to just be an old, this what you do. Then you get an old man hat, right? You start pottering around, you make funny little jokes. Everybody. Lao, we look at them, look at that guy still making jokes. That's what you do.

Speaker 3:          00:03:03       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:03:03       You don't get chemical shot and your fucking face, you know, and enhance your fucking tits. Like what? What are you trying to do? You're trying to give some 60 year old a hard on. I don't understand what these women are doing and it was funny, I didn't even want to talk about this shit. I just, I don't know why that just came out. It just did. All right. I had a wonderful show last night, a wonderful show. I was at the Cape Cod melody, Melody Tent, if I can say it, which is a such a special place for me to do stand up because the one and only time I ever saw it, the Great George Carlin live was that the cape cod melody tent and I am embarrassed to say I saw him in 1988 and me and this other guy went to go see them to laugh at him because my buddy had me convinced that he had stopped writing and that he was still doing 20 year old bits.

Speaker 1:          00:03:51       So we were going to go see him as a joke. If you complicit, how fucking stupid. I was one of the most prolific comedians of all fucking time. So we show up to laugh at this guy and within two seconds we were, we were just on the fucking floor laughing and the guy hit his brand new 90 fucking minutes and we were driving home like he, he wasn't doing more stuff. He wasn't doing fucking like, that's how dumb I was. Um, I did a lot of dumb shit back then. I went to some comedy shows and I was literally the person in the crowd I wasn't hackle in or anything, you know what I mean? Although one time I did Haeckel Don Rickles just cause I wanted to have an interaction with them and I knew that I wasn't going to meet him. You know, I saw him at a casino about four years ago

Speaker 3:          00:04:37       and um,

Speaker 1:          00:04:39       I waited till his encore and it came out in the encore and he was just doing his jokes, doing his jokes and I was way in the back. He's playing this giant room. I was waiting in the back and I just went, hey, it didn't say anything. He kept doing his jokes, kept doing it as jokes. I waited like another three minutes and I went dark and he just looked out to where I was sitting. He goes, yeah, I know my name made that fucking Rickles face. And I was with Bart, nick and he fucking elbow. He goes, he heard you, he heard you. And that was it. You know, I broke a major rule of engagement there with fucking as a standup comedian. I shouldn't have done it, but I couldn't help myself. I couldn't help myself. You know what? Let's be honest. Why don't we just be honest? Okay. Now that that's stupid, fucking fight is over. Can we all just be honest with ourselves here? I'm a selfish person

Speaker 1:          00:05:28       in rather than accepting the fact that I wasn't going to get an interaction with them, I had to do that because I'm a selfish cunt. Okay. And, uh, you know, now can we all be honest about what went on Saturday night? I gotta be honest with you. I have not even seen highlights of it. I didn't fucking watch it. I actually came home and, uh, I was staying with some relatives here in Boston who also didn't get the fight, cause they're saying people feel like, yeah, it's just, you know, he's Floyd's gonna carry him for a couple of rounds that he's going to finish them and then they both, you know, they're not going to really each other up. They're both going to leave with a buttload of money. Isn't that what's going on here? Yeah. Isn't there some Guy Alvarez who's actually a fucking modern day champion or some shit like that coming up anyway, we'll spend the money on that. We'll spend the money on that fucking thing. Whatever that boxing match. I don't know shit about boxing, but I do know lousy auto versus Mohammed Ali when I fucking see it. So I mean a better version of it, I should say. But anyways, um,

Speaker 4:          00:06:21       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:06:22       We actually watched a wicked tuna. I have such mixed emotions when I watched those fishing shows, you know, I got this love of animals, but I also love tuna. You know, I am of an environmentalist who loves crab, you know, King Crab. Who the fuck doesn't love that? I mean, that's just fucking, it's tremendous. So when they, they're sitting and talking about how it's all fished out and they can't find any and that type of stuff, you know, it's not that we should stop crabbing. They should just be less fucking people that they have to find it for, you know, so, um,

Speaker 4:          00:07:02       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:07:04       I dunno, I always have all these fucking ideas of how to, you know,

Speaker 4:          00:07:08       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:07:09       trim down the population. And of course I'm never part of the problem. Right. As us as most mass murdering maniacs, you're never part of the problem like Hitler. I'm sure when he looked in the window, the window looked in the mirror, right and was brushing his fucking teeth. Right. I'm sure that he saw a blonde haired blue eyed person instead of seeing what he truly was, which was the runt of the litter. You know what I mean? But the guy had heart, any fucking overcame what the fuck he looked like to achieve his dream. You know, granted he was out of his fucking mind, but I mean, that alone should have just see, should have been, if he wasn't so crazy, it would have been, well, look at me. I'm fucking ugly as Shit and look what I've achieved.

Speaker 4:          00:07:52       You know

Speaker 1:          00:07:54       what, if somebody who looks like me actually had a good heart, imagine what they would achieve. Isn't that what we'll have fucking Luna ticket. Well, how was y'all fucking loaded ticket? Is that okay?

Speaker 4:          00:08:05       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:05       They're like, you know, my dream came true and I played the Cape Cod melody tent telling jokes. His dream came true and fucking, you know, tens of millions of people died. That was literally his dream.

Speaker 4:          00:08:17       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:08:20       like imagine if he never did his shit right and he just lived a regular life and then all of a sudden God for why came say God forbid it's him. I just naturally say, God forbid when I talk about terminal disease, Adolf Hitler, right? Doesn't fucking, you know, somebody bought his paintings or some shit, right? So he just doesn't go down that fucking road. Now he's just, you know, some regular guy and a, and then he has like, he gets some terminal illness and for some reason make a wishes back then and they'd go, what is your drink? What is your wish? And then he's, and then he g rarely you're going to make my wish true. This is what we do. Eight off. We make sure you die with a smile on your face. What is your dream? And he would have led the, you know, telling the guy to come a little bit closer.

Speaker 1:          00:09:07       What do you want to do? I want to exterminate all of the Jews. That's what he would've sent. I want a fucking quagmire that make a wish would've been, they would've had to have, they would have to, hey, hang on a second. They'd have to step out in the hall going, I, what do we do here? I mean, uh, you know, we, we, we, we just kind of made a broad statement that we make dreams come true. We, we didn't clarify it. Like, what do you want me to stand out here long enough? Maybe he'll fucking die of the disease. I mean, our are, reputation's on the line, right? And then all of a sudden make a wish gets dragged into it, gets dragged into the madness of this man and then no longer looked upon as this wonderful organization that they are, right. Which takes in millions and millions of dollars, right? And God knows what the fuck they do. Who knows? You never know what those charities,

Speaker 4:          00:09:55       right?

Speaker 1:          00:09:57       Are they helping people out? Are they helping themselves to a classic Camaro with some t types? When we return, we'll be taken some college. Sorry, I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about today. Um, so anyways, yeah, everybody thought I was going to cave. I have not caved on two fronts. I have not drank in 11 days and I feel this is it dude. I go 11 days. I could go a year, I could go a fucking year. I feel fucking fantastic. And I just used the word fantastic. I never is fantastic. You know, I'm doing cardio like I've always been doing, but I'm not negating it at night with the fucking three or four home pours over there with the giant ice cube. Um, and it's actually, the sober life is fucking great. It just sucks at night. It's the only thing at night. It's sucks at night, you know, because it's like, what the fuck do I do?

Speaker 1:          00:10:51       Um, I'm like, yeah, like I'm a habit guy, so this is the time of night. I fucking do this and then I'm not doing it. I'm like, well, now what do I do? What do I do? So you know what I did? I started playing guitar again. Anything, you know, I suck. What do you want? I mean, it just, I go in there, I fucking play a little bit, and during that time then it gets late and then I literally feel my body just going to come on and do it. Go Paul, go there. It's right over there and look at the bottom to look at the bottle. It's right there just by yourself. One. And I just, all I have to do is just go downstairs to my bedroom. And then the fact that I'm an old man takes over. Like, God, dude, I am not fucking going all the way back up there. He's in. I'm like, he's it. Even as I'm laying there,

Speaker 4:          00:11:30       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:11:32       I go downstairs and my angel of a wife is laying in bed watching five women. She doesn't know, screaming at each other and say horrible things. You know, they're really big on attacking like a, if a woman's never had a child, they're really big on attacking that file, man. That fucking mean. Just God damn fucking main people, you know, it's dumb. These guys are the way we solve shit with violence. I just think, you know, just punching somebody in the face is way more civil than say, well that's why you're bearing and you can't have a child. It's like, really? Do me a favor next time. Just punched me in the nose when that just be, can we just, can we just leave it at that? So there's something to salvage afterwards. Jesus Christ, um, 20 but now that I've gone 11 days, now it's, it's, it's just starts to fade. Like, I don't even know. I walked by my, my fucking, I told you 19, 27 Yankees lineup worth of fucking booze and I'm telling you like, I don't even see it anymore.

Speaker 2:          00:12:39       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:12:40       Like, you know, I don't, I don't, I don't, I get murderer's row murderer's row, the shit that I drink. Um, you know, and then they're all, I have the batting order. You know what I mean? Top of the order, right through cleanup is the top of the shelf top shelf shit. You know that Shit pappies I say, okay, here we go. Let's go with booze. So what would you align up? B? Who's hitting lead off? Who's getting on base? Right? Who's your fucking Rickey Henderson? That's gonna fucking possibly hit a solo shot and the next guys don't even have to knock them in. You know what I'm going to say? I'm going to go.

Speaker 2:          00:13:20       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:21       My Rickey Henderson is Johnnie Walker blue.

Speaker 2:          00:13:25       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:28       Oh, this is going to be hard. I got too many cleanup hitters. Dan. I would say baton second is grant patrol. All right. I'm not a big Tequila guy, so I'm not getting into that fucking a Gavi shit. Where the fuck they put in it? Yeah, Dan. I would say, uh, this is a hard one. I would say maybe some pappy van winkles is going third. Then bat and up in my world, I would say is a McCallum rare cask. Right now we're getting to the middle of the order. This is a, you know, it's not a special occasion. I just want to get fucked up. All right. These are the guys hitting to 70 to 80 then you get in the middle already. You got Johnny Walker Black is baton fifth I'd say no. Fifth is patroned silver. Johnnie Walker black.

You like these people, but they don't, they don't like appreciate good boots. So you just got to hit him with some basic shit, right? That's when you have to go maker's mark. Jack Daniels batting ninth batting ninth. If someone wants to mix it, I'll give you, this is the fuck this. This is the national league. When the pitcher bads. Johnnie Walker. Red Label. There you go. That's my guy. You know what? Send me in your booze lineups probably should have had a you. I could do the bear one lead off Scott to be Budweiser. You know that? Thanks. Getting on fucking base,

Speaker 1:          00:16:10       that's a tough one. You start wanting to people clear the basis a little bit. I'll go a little snobby and I will say Blue Moon. I don't mind the orange slice. I don't mind it like I, if I want, if I'm just fucking thirsty, I'll have one of those bat and cleanup is Guinness.

Speaker 4:          00:16:26       All right.

Speaker 1:          00:16:29       Then I'd have a black and Tan and fifth. Six. Now you just get it. Now you want to get fucked up, right? But you don't want to get your fucking going to become a fat fuck. So I would say cores, light, light, beer. Famila now eight. Nine.

Speaker 2:          00:16:46       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:16:47       Eight and nine. This is four when some, you know, some older people are coming over with their kids and you just get a fun, I dunno, for whatever fucking reason, you got to have an IPA. And when I was others, like a Sierra Nevada or some shit, I would, something like that. I don't drink, but I mean,

Speaker 2:          00:17:05       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:17:06       I'd leave that alone. This isn't, this is stupid. It's congress. I'm literally fucking sober and I'm making booze. Batting lineups. All right. If you're a beer drinker or if you're a hard liquor, you know, I want to hear your lineups. Okay, let's get ready, man. Up The fucking pennant races are heating up. All right. I want to, I want to see what you line up. Sorry. You come walking up to the bar with you, a little pulling your mate, you fucking lineup card out of your back pocket. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:17:33       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:34       By the way, that Blue Moon eyes is signed to like a one year contract. You know, you don't, you just pick up a fucking big bat at the end of the fucking season and like, he, you know, he's not, he's not a true red sock. Um, all right. So anyways, by the way, somebody tweeted at me, that's stupid company out there and fucking Wisconsin microchipping they're fucking employees and these fucking idiots are doing it. And you know, and I'm like, why would they do that? And then all you have to do is look at their faces and you look at them, they, I have this childlike innocence. They are believers. That's all it is. They grew up in a great state of Wisconsin where you're sheltered. All right. You're in the Midwest, you're in the hat or the country that fed fucking weasel and North Korea, his missiles, even if it makes it that far, he's not shooting it at Wisconsin.

Speaker 4:          00:18:27       Right.

Speaker 1:          00:18:28       The Green Bay packers did they like owned by the fans? It's fucking everybody's making cheese. It's Mayberry. You ever been to Wisconsin? It's fucking tremendous. The air is fresh. The water is fucking clean. At least it looks that way. When I drive by at 80 miles an hour and a way to some God forsaken fucking place, I'm going to perform it

Speaker 4:          00:18:50       right.

Speaker 1:          00:18:52       It's tremendous. Fuck these people, they believe,

Speaker 4:          00:18:55       well, I,

Speaker 1:          00:18:57       they all ordered the fight.

Speaker 4:          00:19:00       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:19:00       They think he's gonna make it great again. They Jace, they believe. You know why? Because they're fucking good people out there. So they walk into the workday, hey guys, this is the new thing, and they, and they sit there, look at GI. Don't know. This seems a little bit creepy, right? But how did they get them and how do you, how do you get the general masses? How do you get them all right? There's two ways to get the general masses fear and free tee shirts.

Speaker 4:          00:19:31       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:19:32       One or the other.

Speaker 4:          00:19:34       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:19:34       You scared the shit out of them. They're fucking onboard. You tell him the boogie man under their bed, whatever the fuck you tell them they need to do, they got to fucking do it. If you don't want to fucking waste your time coming up some fucking boogeyman story, just make a free fucking tee shirt. And that's what they did in Wisconsin. They had these fucking tee shirts that said, I got chipped. That was it. That was, that was the tipping point. Wait a minute. If I put that foreign object in me that I have no idea what it is, no idea what it's capabilities are. No idea what it really does other than what you tell me you evil cunt, you'll give me that free tee shirt and you know, they got to be extra soft once. Oh my God, dude, my, I tell you right now, my favorite, my favorite go to t shirt is my, I got chipped. It's so soft, you know? Then as much as I'm making fun of them, I see the writing on the wall because there's way more people. There's way more believers out there, you know, believing in the invisible lines, believing in the teams believe in and all that fucking bullshit, right? Believing that they're evil, but these people are saints or vice versa, right? These people are either, they do it, they do it all over the world.

Speaker 2:          00:20:52       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:20:53       God loves us, Baz. These people are infidels. These people are fucking days. These people are fucking that. It's the thing is the common thread with human beings is that this fucking lunatics at the top.

Speaker 2:          00:21:06       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:21:06       okay. And then you have nice people at the bottom, you know, Wisconsin people,

Speaker 1:          00:21:12       people give the shirt off your fucking back, you know, provided you not to 10 let's, let's not, let's not overly romanticize these white people. At the end of the day, they are wiping, okay? And I'm not shitting on my own people, but just in a position, it's a society and we were, you know, nobody's watching us so we get to go full fucking, you know, full fucking frontal nudity with their fucking brains. There's nobody, there's nobody in our way, right? That's why we go is where we go fucking crazy. You need some sort of hand on, maybe that's what the microchip is for. I have no idea. I just know at the end of the fucking trail, who is it?

Speaker 1:          00:21:50       Think of some of the people that run shit. Look at Bill Clinton. The man could not keep his dick in his pants. He shoving cigars up, women's vaginas half his fucking age. That fucking guy that, that's one of the guys run shit or someone of his fucking ill keep you gonna let that guy put a fucking microchip. What do I get? A free shirt? Yes. Shit, don't skippy. I write, I'm in. And that's it. And this is the thing they don't need. They don't need thinking people to buy in. All they need is the free tee shirt people and the free t shirt people. You get enough of them, it becomes a tipping point and then they can start changing. You know what I mean?

You know, I wish I was good at guitar, was show as good at trumps. I have a tremendous amount of respect for musicians.

Speaker 1:          00:34:21       Speaking of which Queens of the Stone Age, one of my favorite bands of all time put out their brand new album this week. I'm going to be listening to it and I'll give you my own review of it on Thursday. Just kidding. I fucking hate when people do that. That comes supposed to listen to you. Who the fuck are you? You know, fucking listen to you. I'll listen to it myself and make up my own mind. How about that? How about that? All there youtube person, youtube person. Anyways, I'm going to be a November 2nd. I'm going to be in clear lake, Iowa at the surf ballroom. Now the surf ballroom is the, that's the last place buddy Holly, the big Bopper, Ritchie Valens. All of those guys played. Waylon Jennings was there that night and he went on the bus and everything. Um, just being a music fan, I dunno if it's slightly morbid to play there, but I'm going to play there and I'm flying in.

Speaker 1:          00:35:12       I'm landing at the fucking airport. They took off from every everyday a killer. Angie fucking nervous. They crashed because there was no de sync technology back then. They had too much weight on their wings, which changed the shape of the air foil. They were overweight. They could fucking produce enough lift. They crashed and they die. That's not going to happen in 2017 so I'm going to be there. Won't happen to me. It won't happen to you. If you want to check out this legendary venue, uh, November 2nd clear lake, Iowa surf ballroom. I'm going to be there with Dean del Rey who was actually born the same day that they all died. Not the same year, but the same day. So it's going to be, there's going to be tremendously freaky fucking night. Um, I got a brand new hour and last night I, I it could not have gone better and I left out half of my fucking jokes. I was having so much fun, uh, down at the Cape Cod Melody Tent. So please get you tickets to November 2nd clear lake, Iowa, the surf ballroom and I will be tweeting out and Facebooking out a link because I am an old man. I'm not on Photoshop, I'm not on Instagram. It's not Photoshop. What's the other one is Instagram. And then there's the other one. Snapchat. I need to get on those, right? Is that what I need to do a, by the way, I'm thinking of putting together a college tour,

Speaker 1:          00:36:25       a tour of colleges in the beginning of next year, um, to help promote F is for family and bringing a bunch of swag to, uh, you know, free merchandise free f is for family merchandise. This is what I want to do by get enough interest from certain schools, especially the University of Kansas, when the Jay Hawks have a home basketball game. So I can go to that legendary arena. That would be tremendous. Do you understand what I'm saying here? I was actually thinking of doing that once a year, right in every like, you know, college fucking, um, division. You know, like one year I'll do a big 10 fucking f is for family tour. I'll do an SCC one, I'll do a pack 12, whatever the fuck they're called now. Um, the whack, right. Do something like that. I don't know. I'm always thinking of fucking idea like that shit, but uh, just to help promote it and um,

Speaker 1:          00:37:23       may cause that's my fucking job. I got to sell the goddamn shoving. They'll get mad at me. All right. All right, 37 minutes in. Here we go. Here we go. All right, let's uh, let's read some of your questions here for this week. I'm up up, up, up, up, up, up a bone. The nineties. Dear Billy temple pilot, I'm feeling a bit nostalgic for the 90s. I was 12 and 1990. I'm 10 years older than you. You have bested and had no stress or responsibilities. I get how that influences this, but it was a good time. I'm happy with technology now in our society. Is more conscious of social issues, but everything is so loud now. Do you ever get into style check for the 90s if so, what part of the nineties can you have your podcast guy use the friends theme song for the Thursday podcast? That's a question mark there or anything. Awesome from the 90s uh, thanks for reading this. If you do, life is pretty boring these days and if I could you use something?

Speaker 2:          00:38:19       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:38:20       to brighten my day as a pet store manager. All right sir. Here's what's happening to you is you're slipping into your life and you don't like what's going on. So rather than fixing the, now you're going back in time, that's not, I mean that's, that's a temporary fix. Okay. If you don't want to manage a pet store, asked yourself what you really want to do and start slowly walking towards that, taking a half a step, a quarter step every day in one point you're going to look up and God damn it, there it is. Just like Indiana Jones and then you grab it and all of a sudden a giant ball starts rolling FDA and you got to fucking run out of there and that's you after you make it, then trying to stay there. All right. But that's way more exciting than managing this pet store that, you know, you're saying brighten your day as a pet store manager.

Speaker 1:          00:39:12       You one of these guys who actually doesn't like animals. You probably don't like the people. Right? Coming in there, whatever. I don't know what it is but it's, but I will answer your question. My favorite part of the 90s was the month before nevermind came out and I was listening to the skid row slave to the grind and I thought hair metal and all night when the hair metal, but metal was never going to end because that was what you love was the end of my youth because I was 22 in 1990 so that was the end of the end of it for me. So like think about 2000 for you. You're getting out of college, all this new music is coming out. You're starting to not be able to, you know, the next few years, you can't keep up with it. What the fuck are they listening to? And then that's what happens. And then you start driving around it. But I'm not going to lie to you do the shit that I say. I still listened to 'em

Speaker 2:          00:40:03       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:40:03       You know, I try to listen to newer shit like you know, it's a new band to me, like Cold War kids and I'm like guy, I saw them, you know, recently they were on TV, I'll download some of this stuff. And I'm like, oh I remember that song.

Speaker 2:          00:40:14       Okay

Speaker 1:          00:40:15       that fucking ball. Bam My pant, that Song Ben fucking soon. The guys singing way, the really high voice, amazing voice. And um, I was looking at dance like that fucking album came out 2006 or something. So I'm way behind the curve but uh, I try to stay up on, all right, you want to hear something embarrassing? I'm going to fucking tell you all my latest, my latest downloads. I downloaded dream weaver by Gary Wright, that album tremendously, tremendously fucking uh, underrated album. All right. Cause everybody thinks of a, they think of that song,

Speaker 5:          00:40:57       we'll, we'll, we'll dream weaver.

Speaker 1:          00:41:00       Right? And everybody laughs at that song, you know, they use it. And these ironic history hipster fucking ways. I gotta tell you, man, that fucking album is the shit. And um, this stuff is some poppy shit on that. But, um, all these years of me talking about loving to play drums and all this stuff, why did nobody tell me about Andy Newmark? Jesus Christ. That guy's one of the best fucking drummers I've ever heard he plays on this album. And uh, you know, you don't have to get it for fucking dream weaver or any of that shit. Like a love is alive. The longest time I thought that sounded like Clapton to me. Singing or maybe like one of those, uh, Steve Winwood bands.

Speaker 3:          00:41:43       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:41:44       Just listen to how tasty the fucking drums are. And I'll actually post a video this week of him fucking playing with like Rod Stewart and these guys just fucking Waylon. All right. So he downloaded that. Then I downloaded Cold War kids, Robertson cowards. I'm downloading the new queens of the stone age today. And then here's, oh Jesus, by his in defense of me, I lost a lot of my music when I dropped my last phone into the toilet. Um, it was actually in my back pocket and I stood up from taking, taking a dump, right? No, no I didn't. I didn't, I was fucking hammered. I remember this guy was saying there was something about standing up when you take a Piss, some fucking health reasons. So I sat down like a lady, right? And I had my phone in my back pocket when I stood up at fucking fell into the toilet.

Speaker 1:          00:42:32       Fucking brutal. Like I was going to go get that. Nah, it ain't happen. And so I don't use the cloud and everything. Just I lost everything. So I downloaded ACDC. If you want blood, you got it. Live ACDC for those about to rock a c d c high voltage than I had to get my vintage Aerosmith and there I downloaded get your wings, rocks, toys in the attic. Then I downloaded the new fucking mute math while I'm on weight and I'm still waiting for the rest of that album. Come out to play dead. I downloaded Glen Campbell rhinestone cowboy cause I've been singing that with the advertising LACOE Rad stone ball bag. Uh, Peter Frampton, Frampton comes alive. All js, all j a this is all yours. Marvin gay sexual healing download. What a fucking tremendous song that is. The new royal blood album.

Speaker 1:          00:43:26       Anthony Hamilton. Then I downloaded like three prints albums not to have them sign of the times and then a dirty mind. The first sound garden album, the prince album for you. Then Dave Brubeck live at Carnegie Hall, then a bunch of miles Davis. That's what I've done in the last couple of months. Stamen with miles working with miles round about midnight, relaxing with miles, cooking with miles. And there you go. That's what the fuck I've been downloading. What else do I get here, Wayne? Shorter.

Speaker 2:          00:44:06       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:44:06       The idiot king. Attention deficits. I think that's it. Oh, that's what's his face? Tim Alexander on drums on that. The brown album.

Speaker 1:          00:44:17       Bad Motor finger. Temple of the dog. Oh, that was right when I'm Chris Cornell died. I had to get all that fucking music back on my phone. John Coltrane, Sonny Rollins, Tesla skid, they go, Marilyn Manson, prime primers, primers, animals should not act like people. Pork, Soda and sailing the seas. Cheese. You're not Derosa just sent me a new fucking, they're new. Their latest fucking track. It's the shit. I absolutely loved it. Primus has a new one coming out with the fuck is it called? Let me see here. Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? In my phone. In my phone and my phone.

Speaker 1:          00:44:59       All right. What do I have him underneath? You know, everybody says Joe has no shoulders. That's not true. He lacks the meat that is between your neck and your shoulders. Basically his trip. He's, he's, he was born without it. Um, all right. Prime is the seven. Check that out this week. All right. Enough with his old man telling you the music that he likes. Let's get back to your young people questions here, shall we? So, um, yeah, when grunge came in, I got up. I didn't like the first, like when Pearl jam first came out and Nirvana first came out, I didn't like those bands because they knocked all my bands off the top 10. You know, I was like, this isn't a good band. What about Brittany Fox? What about winger? A man. What about warrant? Um, and yeah, I listened. I didn't necessarily buy all those albums, but I didn't think any of that was bad music. I was young, I didn't fucking know any better, you know, lease. Those guys could fucking play under these cons today with a fucking laptop and a God damn Christmas tree in their head. Um, so it took me a long time to admit that nirvana pearl jam were great bands, but like Soundgarden and fucking Allison chains had like fucking that anger in there. Um, and just the sound of the lead singers, man, I just, I really liked their front men and uh,

Speaker 2:          00:46:10       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:46:11       Now of course, you know, I love Pearl Jam. I love Nirvana and all that shit, but I was a bit of a baby when their music came out. I was, I was too young. This is the first time I was seeing my music go away so I wasn't mature enough to be like, you know what, you know, I have to accept that, uh, you know, my time has come and gone and that this is what the fucking music is now and I should listen to him. It took me a good 20 years to be able to do that. All right. Hey there, Billy Clinton. Uh, did you, did you hear that she had, the court ruled that the head of the Democratic National Convention Debit Wasserman, that's her name. Dib B I t Sholtz rig the primaries against Bernie Sanders.

Speaker 1:          00:46:53       The court what court. So this woman under the influence of Hillary Clinton's camp tampered in the u s election process, but none of the Democrats are celebrity. Do rights are going to be outraged because there's sanctimonious ass hats. And for the record, I was a registered Democrat and stop fucking saying that. If it's a fact, it's a fact. I don't need to know. I used to be or this or I actually voted for Obama. I don't give a fuck what you did. If what you're saying is factual, I don't need to know what the fuck he did. I was a registered Democrat until about 2010 by Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. With the exception of Bush and Gerald Ford. Uh, anyways, the hypocrisy is just so insane to me to not be mad at this, especially as a democrat. I think you have to have clinical issues. Yeah. Well, I heard like Bernie Sanders was drawn a bunch of people and they just didn't even cover it. All right. Now where does this coming from? This is the, uh, the observer.com.

Speaker 2:          00:47:50       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:47:50       June, 2016, a class action suit was filed against the Democratic National Committee and the former Democratic national, uh, was Debbie Debbie Wasserman Schultz for violating, uh, the DNC charter by rigging the Democratic presidential primaries for Hillary Clinton against Bernie Sanders.

Speaker 1:          00:48:11       How hilarious would be this big? It's actually doubly sad if this is true. Even former Senate minority leader Harry Reid admitted in July, 2016 I knew everybody knew that this was not a fair deal. He added that Debbie Wasserman Schultz should have resigned much sooner than she did. The lawsuit was filed to push the Democratic National Convention to admit their wrongdoing and provide Bernie Sanders supporters who supported him financially millions of dollars in campaign contributions with restitution for being cheated on August 25th, 2017 federal judge Williams shy is this all true, dismissed the lawsuit after several months of litigation during which the Democratic national conventions attorneys argued that the DNC would be with, well within their rights to rig primaries and select their own candidates. That was their argument. So they weren't denying it. And evaluating plaintiff's claims that this, you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to send this to Jimmy door and I want him to cause he, you know, I'm too stupid to be able to debunk this or say that. It's actually fucking trope. I want to know. I want to know what love is.

Speaker 2:          00:49:20       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:49:20       I mean, this wouldn't surprise me. You know what I mean? I would actually love if this got some fucking attention just to truly shut up all these fucking dopes in Hollywood. You don't, you know, back in the day. Yeah. I mean, I guess I, I mean I think that, I mean it was getting, no, I'm not trying to be the spokesperson for fucking Wesson oil or whatever the fuck people are trying to do out there, but like, I try to like evenly trash everybody and I'm totally into conspiracy theory. Like none of this is shocking to me.

Speaker 2:          00:49:51       You know?

Speaker 1:          00:49:53       I just, I just think we're just inherently flawed and I base that on myself as I fucking, you know, I as like just fuck up all the time, which is what, just inherently flawed people. All right, Jimmy door. There we go. This is how dumb I am. I'm going to send this to him and I'm just going to text. Is this true?

Speaker 2:          00:50:22       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:50:23       You know, and he loves me enough to actually reply this. I know part of him is going to feel sad that I'm as dumb as I am.

Speaker 2:          00:50:33       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:50:33       And then I have his phone number. Um, yeah. I mean,

Speaker 2:          00:50:38       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:50:39       None of that surprises me. I mean it was, he kind of felt that Bernie was getting boxed out and I guess maybe the Democratic National Committee does have the, I guess does have the right to do it the same way the NFL had the right to suspend Tom Brady, whether he did anything or not. I mean, when they took it to court, they go, yeah, this is bullshit. You don't have enough fucking evidence. And they're like, well, we're a cooperation. Right. It doesn't cooperate and have a right, this is planned. It's employee. Yes, you dealt well Tom Brady's our employee, therefore he suspended. Um, that's Kinda like what they did to Bernie Sanders and yes, I did. Just compare him to Tom Brady. I think they have a lot in common. I'm living in a retirement community at 33 years of age. What's up freckled ball bag. Um, a friend recently turned me onto your podcast.

Speaker 1:          00:51:28       It's hilarious. Well thank you. Thank you for preventing me from killing myself with my one hour commute to work. Well, that's great. I like to, I like to do what I can, although I am into population. Maybe I should take a control population control. Maybe we should take a couple of weeks off. Uh, my wife, 28 and I 33 finally had enough money to buy our first home to what? You guys are crushing it. So he purchased a nice little townhouse in Connecticut. We didn't know at the time, but we were moving into a community that is potentially the evil offspring of a retirement village and the house of wax. Oh yeah. Well that's what happens when you buy your first house. You so excited. You don't drive around. You don't know the questions to ask. Now, you know, are the people oldest shit around here? Just out of curiosity, is this a drug filled the neighborhood?

Speaker 2:          00:52:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:52:17       Is there any chemical fucking shit in the water? What are the schools like? You know, all those questions you have to ask. All right, we are nice, courteous people. And so we think

Speaker 1:          00:52:29       or so we think he's a, so don't take the anger in this email out of context. Um, well he had a little perspective that we used to. If you said we're a nice courtesy people, courteous people, but the fact that you actually have the intelligence to say or so we think understanding that there is another perspective in life other than your own. Uh, we've helped some of our old ass neighbors carry shit, you know, because they can't, with the osteoporosis and everything, we wave and chat with them when walking our dog and we even hold the charity beer pong tournament in New York City every year to raise money for ms uh, unrelated to our community, but shows we care. Question Mark, I guess question Mark Anyhoo enough about us. Uh, this past weekend we had my brother and sister in law in town and invited another couple over on Saturday, Saturday.

Speaker 1:          00:53:20       I'm sorry if I blew your eardrums out. I tried to pull it away enough. Uh, I don't think I took it away in time. Sorry. Uh, we went to hang out at school at our, at our pool, sorry. We took a float snacks, a couple of beers and a speaker. There were five to seven other people at the pool, all in their hundreds. It did not look like the pool scene from caddy shack. Uh, we hung out, chatted symptom beer and listened on low to Jack Johnson or some other mellow soft shit. Monday morning at 10:00 AM the entire community got this email residents, it was reported to the board and the management that over this past weekend there was some owners and guests who behaved inappropriately, loud and shouting conversations, foul language and may have partaken in alcoholic beverages prior to or while visiting the pool. None of these things are acceptable and are also violation of the pool rules of the old fucks court.

Speaker 1:          00:54:21       Obviously you added that if [inaudible] if set individuals we're seeing behaving in such a manner going forward, the police may be called and said individuals will not be permitted to use the facilities and may also be subject to a hearing in front of the board whereby fines may be imposed. The pool facility is for the peaceful enjoyment of all residents and we hope to keep it that way. Thank you. Signed the old ass board of directors, Jesus Christ, to what the f you didn't realize your fucking bought a house in a retirement community says first off, let me say I've had, I had nothing against the elderly. I love my grandparents. It's, you don't have to stop establishing credibility. You bought a fucking house is a bunny in it and it's like the movie cocoon. But if you jump in the pool, you're still fucking old. I get it.

Speaker 1:          00:55:16       Um, anyways, I called the once a week. I enjoy quiet night in the couch with some scotch or an old fashion and shit. I still use hotmail. Yes, we're a part of Hoa. And then rules above above about alcohol drinks at the pool. You can only have two guests per household. Oh Shit. We violated the covenant. But this email from the board is still absurd, right? No, it's not absurd. You just didn't do your homework. You didn't do your homework. That's what happened. You didn't do your homework and they just fucking rip the spread here with that pen in the back pocket waiting on my mother's fucking quilt here. Um, I'm on the fuck am I here? I got to go back to this year. By the way, everybody thinks every sound on my podcast is a fart now cause I hold this thing to my chest and he's fucking sound that's made though.

Speaker 1:          00:56:05       You're fucking ripped ass last week. Uh, I mean, maybe I did. I don't think, I mean I don't feel that I am. Maybe I am. I don't know. Um, but it's, I'm mean, I mean my house, you know, I have to Fart. I let it go. You can't fucking smell it. Deal with it. Um, no dude is all on you. This is just, and he said, but loud conversations. What? Drinking alcoholic beverages prior to visiting the pool area. You kidding me? The police may be called get an f in life to do. This is their life. This is the end of their life. And they want quiet. Okay. Half of them probably fought and fucking wars. The last thing I need is you with your new fangled fucking Elvis' music. That is Jack Johnson to them.

Speaker 3:          00:56:50       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:56:51       look at this is the deal. You guys fucked up.

Speaker 3:          00:56:55       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:56:58       You guys fucked up. All right. And this is part of buying your first house. Okay. I bought my first house back in 2011

Speaker 3:          00:57:06       mmm.

Speaker 1:          00:57:09       And you know what I was like, wow is a great old house. It has a lot of character and you know, you know what my fucking old people at the pool was galvanized pipes in the walls. Cloth wiring, a gas leak flashing. When I turned on the lights to possibly ignite the gas underneath my fucking house, a wood rot, termites, non permitted fucking building shy, just you fucking name it. Put a new roof on it. The Guy fucked up. He didn't reattach the thing. The water came through. They blamed me. I just said fuck it. I paid for it myself. This is part of it, dude. I'm really sorry that you're going through this. I'm sure there's somebody else old that will buy your fucking house.

Speaker 3:          00:57:50       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:57:52       Other than that, I would just, you are in a communal area. I would be quiet when you go down to the pool, I mean, I try to look at the bright side. At least nobody's going to be listening to loud fucking Benny Goodman music all the way into the night because old people, you know, they fall asleep like nine times a day. So, and even if he don't like your neighbor, they're going to die soon. There's a lot of positive ways to look at it and you can also, you can always sell. So I would make the best of it. You can always Uber. I would Uber, I would go out and go get fucking hammered and be loud and the young part of town and then come back. Just make sure you get some sort of electric car to crucially up real quietly to your fucking front door.

Speaker 1:          00:58:32       I'm sorry you're going through that. But what you learned is you have to fucking check out your neighborhood before you, uh, you know, you got to read everything, you know, so that's the deal. All right. I hope it works out for you. All right. Oh guess who just texts me back? This is why Jimmy doors to shit cause I just read shit and Jimmy gets to the bottom. But this is what Jimmy just sent me back. Basically. Yes, the judge left, opened the door for the lawyers to, to refile in a way that would be more successful. The important thing in this case is that the lawsuit forced the DNC lawyer to admit in court that they don't have to run a fair primary and that they can pick and choose whoever, whoever they want and can ignore the voters. Uh, they can ignore the voters, will if they to do so.

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       The wiki leaks emails revealed that the DNC was colluding with the Clinton campaign and gave her an unfair advantage, which is why Wasserman Schultz resigned before the DNC convention last summer. The judge dismissed the case. It appears to me based on the fact that plaintiff did not have stand standing to sue and the federal court did not have jurisdiction in this case. I am interviewing the lawyer who filed this case today, so hopefully lots will be cleared up in that interview. So there you go. Search Jimmy Dore. Um, I'll send out a link to, that's a comedian that's, that's an informed guide. Here are that thing was written. You hear on eloquent. That was, I actually sounded smart while rating that. Um, check that out. Oh Man. Oh my God. Oh my God. All those women who cried over fucking Hillary Clinton and she's just as fucking filthy as this guy.

Speaker 1:          01:00:16       Can you believe this? Trump. Can you fucking believe this? Trump. That's all you hear out in fucking Hollywood land where I live and it's just like I want to, I hope it's true so I can be like, well what do you think about that? And watch them completely dismiss it the same way to go back to Tom Brady. Well I'll be all right. So He lets a cons. Hair, what they are out of a ball. What about when you guys did this and that the other people root for the law? That was no fucking big deal cause our team did it. I fucking love it. I love it. Oh Jesus Christ. Do I love it? Okay. Boss, racist, racist, racist. Question Mark.

Speaker 1:          01:00:52       Hey Billy. Booze bag. Ah, Bill. You know, fun. 11 days motherfucker. Ah, shut up. I know you're not drinking. Oh, he got me. Look at that. I'm any more, it's all I could come up with. All right. Bill recently, our company at an event where we give a tour to possible clients who will partner with us in the future during this event, our boss who was outgoing and funny, was ironing white sheets and thought it'd be funny to poke fun at the KKK by placing a white sheet over his head and saying, black lives matter. Uh, he immediately recognized the situation and took it off his head and address the whole company in the next day. He apologized and made our counselors available to the company for whatever was affected and offended Jesus fucking Christ. You got to go through all of that.

Speaker 2:          01:01:39       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:01:39       I just love these people that are just so fucking, I don't know where the fuck they live that they feel like I can do this and they're not going to have a problem, but then everybody's like so fucking hurt. They need to be counseled. Why don't you just trying to get out of your job for a couple hours? Just walk up to the guy and say, you're a fucking asshole. And then if you want the guy fired, just say that someone's got to sit there and hold your hand. I'm, the only problem was that he left out the black lives mattered part in the first meeting and simply said, oh, wait a minute. So when I would, he's saying, okay, wait a second.

Speaker 2:          01:02:14       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:02:15       The only problem was that he left out the black life lives matter part in the first meeting and simply said, he placed the sheet over his head, which is where the outrage came from.

Speaker 2:          01:02:27       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:02:28       You know, dude, that's one of the most important part information, most important information in this fucking story. And you left out some words here.

Speaker 2:          01:02:35       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:02:35       The only problem was that he left out the black lives mattered part in the first meeting and simply said, he plays the sheet over his head, which is where we're wdre worthy outrage came from to, what am I supposed to do with this? And the counselor meeting with everyone. I couldn't help but notice only,

Speaker 2:          01:02:56       okay,

Speaker 1:          01:02:57       white middle aged women were trashing the guy. They were crying, et cetera.

Speaker 2:          01:03:03       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:03:03       Not One minority in that room said they were affected. It pissed me off because it was almost insulting to minorities watching this. What if,

Speaker 2:          01:03:14       yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:03:14       there was actually a minority who was actually racially discriminate against and went to court and wasn't listened to too. I don't know what you're talking about right now. I'm 90% sure these women were just looking for money. It's not like our boss tried to hide or make excuses, so the white women got offended. What else? This is like a fucking beat sheet for a script that isn't written yet. What white middle aged women were trashing the guy, they were crying, et cetera. That fucking sentence ended. Then he began a new paragraph with that and then start to talking about the minority women there. I don't, I don't know what you're talking about here, sir. Okay, so, okay, so you're asking me what, okay, what am I opinions you think these women are just looking for an opportunity to sue sue, s e w so for money or do you think they actually believe these ladies were offended? Thanks bill. I don't know what you're talking about here sir. I have no idea. I have no idea. I mean I'm I making fun of white women for acting like they were offended and crying cause you think I have no idea. I don't know what Sir proofread. Okay. I'm not a good speller either, but you know, I do know where the spell check is and I hit the button and it erases all my impurities. Alright. My fiance is an into fucking other men.

Speaker 1:          01:04:45       Okay. He says, I feel are, she said, I don't know what the fuck this is, what gender this is. He said, I feel like this is a slightly different yet amusing take on relationship issues and we'd love to hear your tackle. You tackle this in a podcast. Basically. I really like watching my girl. Fuck other men. It's not a cuckold thing because I'll fucker right after and it's always the best sex we ever had. Right after you don't have her shower first sir. Right after. Okay, thank you know, I don't judge. Whatever you want to do, if that's what you guys are in. My issue is that our sex is already great and I'm well above average in size and stamina. So it's hard for her to find another guy she's actually interested in, oh Jesus Christ.

Speaker 2:          01:05:33       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:05:33       Jesus Christ, you started all the way to the left. Now we're all the way to the right. Oh Wow. Yeah. This guy, this fucking guy here. You know, I don't mind. I don't mind her fucking other guys. I can handle it cause at the end of the day, my GIC show big. Nobody can follow me. Um, okay, now I'm judging the guy. I don't know why I'm doing this is just all over the fucking map. I don't push the issue because I'm confident in my abilities. Evidently so confident. You've got to fucking write an email about it and don't want her to have a bad time simply for my pleasure. But I wanted to know your opinion on the subject. We have threesomes with other women. God bless you and I can't even get into them, so I can't judge her. I love her and are amazing. Sex has been a driving factor after almost four years. Yet. There's something about fucking her after she's been with another man that is so hot to me, I can't act accurately explain it and she just doesn't seem into it because as she puts it, I do it better. This is one of the greatest email. I hope he, if even if you just made this up, I would really appreciate your opinion on this weird kind of relationship where the issue for me is that I can't get off because the girl as incredible as she is, is too perfect.

Speaker 2:          01:06:52       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:06:52       What, where the issue for me is that I can't get off because the girl as incredible as she is, is too perfect.

Speaker 2:          01:07:05       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:07:05       So the way her to make her not perfect as to have you watch her fuck another guy.

Speaker 2:          01:07:12       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:07:13       She got a giant Dick and you enjoy it and you kind of like want to show like that is the only way I can look at it. This is like, you're like the head like the best comedian in the fucking country. All right? But there's still some level of insecurity you have that you have to go on on these, these, these shows where the comics aren't at your level and you have to go on last and you have to fucking kill harder and kill longer than anybody else to prove that you are the best comedian in the fucking country, if not the world, if not the fucking universe. Right?

Speaker 2:          01:07:48       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:07:48       Is that what it is?

Speaker 2:          01:07:50       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:07:50       Is it the fact that you know, that you fucking nail it or better than these, these other fucking guys, they come out with their average decks and their little fucking dicks and she's bored shitless.

Speaker 2:          01:08:01       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:08:01       Do you make the other people watch? You know what I mean? Like, yeah, helping out their golf swing.

Speaker 2:          01:08:08       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:08:08       It, Oh, you keep lifting your head. You've got to fucking keep your head down as you follow through. Do, I don't know. I don't have the problems. You have surf.
