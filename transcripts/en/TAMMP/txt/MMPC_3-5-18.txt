Speaker 2:          00:01:24       podcast. Hey, what's going on is bill burn is time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday. I'm going to go with uh, what's today? Thursday first, second, third, fourth, fifth March 5th, March 6th. You're asking the wrong person. I know. I'm asking the wrong person. I'm recording this on March 1st. A very special guest on the podcast. We've had two in a row, two special guests in a row, which means my podcast continues to get more and more special as that dropped the fucking recorder. Uh, we have the great Al Jourgensen from ministry right here. Uh, he's got a new album coming out and uh, for whatever reason he wanted to come on my stupid podcast to promote it. One of the legends of a really less 30 years. Basically, you invented an entirely new kind of music, right? You will, you were credited with coming up with a, what they call an industrial, something like something like that.

Speaker 2:          00:02:14       I just think it was probably a bad strain of acid in the 90s well, you getting credit all the way back into the 80s though, are you? Well, yeah, that was the good strain of acid. The nineties kind of went down hill. But uh, what is, what is the golden age of acid, would you say? Oh, the 60s definitely when, when they finally figured out the, uh, the DMT compounds that we're an organic plants and we're able to make it chemically that was the golden age because it was pure and it before it hit the streets and they cut it with strict nine and baby aspirin and whatever else. Right. They were cutting, I mean, I lived with Timothy leary for two years. How to here in Jesus Christ and you survived, uh, not only that, to survive, I can't wait for the book to come out because what would do is he would just, uh, have me inject like psychedelic compounds that were sent to them by universities around the world and then he'd take notes on me as the Guinea pig.

Speaker 2:          00:03:12       As University's code for the CIA or was it actual like university while Alex Jones. Fuck it. So wait, so how did it, how her, well, how do you meet a guy and how does he bring up, hey, you want to live with me for a while and while you don't have to pay rent, I'm just going to occasionally inject you with, uh, some acid I got through the mail that's allegedly from a university. Well, the story of o wound up with Tim is actually better than me being with Tim as I met Tim through William Burroughs, uh, which was in Jesus Christ. Story on how I met William Burroughs. And we did a video. We played wide receiver for the Houston Oilers at, I was Ken Burns. Ken. I know he's, he's one of the beat writers that I never read. Did he write naked lunch? Uh, yeah, he wrote naked dead.

Speaker 2:          00:04:02       Yes ma'am. Um, amongst other things, uh, Nova Express. Um, yeah, the, the guy is a genius and we wound up working with them because, uh, basically because we sampled, uh, some of his spoken word and a Warner brothers wouldn't release our record at the time was a psalm 69, I believe them so early nineties, and they wouldn't release it. And they said, well, we can't get clearance for this. And so it was a little blurb and random notes and rolling stone that said ministry, I'll postponed for another year until they can figure this out. And then the boroughs, people called me and said, nobody asked us, we'd be happy to give you the shit man. Oh Wow. You know, uh, hey, when do you want to work? You want to do some other stuff? They were all happy about it. So then I wound up hanging out with bill and Kansas.

Speaker 2:          00:04:50       When did the album come out then? So they didn't have to shelve it for you? It's like shelf for about three months, but it wasn't like the year that there were saying and all this. And then we got clearance and then, uh, William Bill Burroughs introduced me to Timothy leary during that lollapalooza toward, and then out to the Lollapalooza tour was done. Uh, I was kind of sick of rock music, so I just wanted to take a year or two off, um, because it was just, it was just really gross. It was just, you know, all the after parties and all this stuff. It just, it just gets old after a while. So it wasn't the music that was happening at the time, it was just, you were burned out from all the partying and all that, everything. So I moved in with the psychedelic master of all time to get my head together, which is not a good, I was trying to picture how this, this, this was going to work.

Speaker 2:          00:05:38       Like I was sick of the partying, so I moved in with Timothy Leary so you could experiment on me with like acid and shit. All right. You know, you know who owns the, uh, the notes that he took a on all of my trips. Uh, because this was a weekly thing so you can fucking tripping in. This guy says looking at you taking notes in the corner. I never, yeah, it was a, it was dropped acid. Is that how you could say oh no, no, no. I injected it. Oh sorry. Like a fucking lab rat. Okay. He, while Jack did, cause he knew I was a junkie at the time. I haven't done drugs in 15 years by the way, except for psychedelics. I haven't done heroin and coke and all that crap. And why, why psychedelics? Uh, it's a cheap and easy Uber way to, uh, to get to what people would call enlightenment as opposed to like doing it through yoga and stretching meditation.

Speaker 2:          00:06:29       And that just takes too long. This just cuts to the quick, and you're right there where all the PD, no, that's why I don't like weed versus alcohol. I feel like alcohol, you earn it, you know, you got to get it down the hatch. You make the face and like we, especially the shit they got now, it's like you'd take two or three tokes and then you sit down and it's like you're borderline trip. And I just don't feel like I earned it. I feel like it, I feel like a trust fund kid while I say this. Uh, I mean as far as like textiles in the modern age or if this is cutting in and out, this is my shitty thing. I, I can't move too much. All right. Sorry. It, it's one of the few things that, uh, have actually improved over these recent years is the quality of pot and obviously the quality of electronics, thanks to like stolen alien technology or whatever the fuck we got going.

Speaker 2:          00:07:14       Right. Um, yeah, the quality of Pod has improved to the point to where, um, it's almost like a, you used to really get stoked for like a weekend of mushrooms and now it's just like you smoke pot every day and it's just like the weekend a mushrooms just like, it's Kinda the same thing. Yeah. The pots improved, especially really here. I've never taken mushrooms either. I know that any of the hallucinate, let's stuff this weekend. Well you're going to Vancouver show. Yeah, I'm going to go job with some showrooms. You could go to the back then. I don't know if I want to do that. Uh, I, I think I basically, I think it's just my headphones and it keeps cutting in and out, but I'm watching the little bubbles here and they keep going up like I'm talking, so we seem good. Yeah. Okay, cool. Um, well you know what, there's a lot of people out there like myself that have never tried any of this shit.

Speaker 2:          00:08:01       So what, what is it like to be on, on mushrooms? I'm never going to do it. Maybe when I get like my kid grows up and goes out of the house, you'll, you'll do it. No, no, no, no. I don't want to do it in a hacky way. Like go to fucking Josh Joshua tree and be like, hey man, like look at the rock for me show. No, no, don't, don't do that. But I want to go to best buy and get like last night freaking out, looking at the screen, you need to be a veteran at that point. You don't go into a mall with like fluorescent lights or a shop like home depot or Lowe's unless you're an experienced tripper. Okay. That's when incidents happen. So if you go in there and you've done this a few times, you find yourself smirking at the absurdity of places like Lowe's or home depot, strip malls.

Speaker 2:          00:08:47       There's things like this. But if you go in there first time and do that as your first name, uh, don't call me for bail because I could always shovels, man, start freaking and they're going to dig my grave. Now the first time I actually, uh, I think actually was tripping a little bit was I ingested weed and then went to the airport to board in an international flight night, two and a half a pot brownies. And I was just, I too much. Yeah, it was way too much. And I know I did some sort of brain damage and I just never fucked with it again. And I just, it felt like I had, you know, like I told the story on Opie and Anthony Long time ago, you know, like when your foot falls asleep really bad, it felt like that was a ball of that, like just sitting on my head like a, you know, those, those, those things you use in the shower, those big puffy things.

Speaker 2:          00:09:35       It felt like there was like that size of it just sitting right on the crown on my head. And I was like, we'd hung over for like two days cause I went to Costa Rica and I got off and I thought it was going to get arrested. All those things. It was like midnight express and all that shit. But, um, yeah, so I just, I always like booze cause you know, I was a corny kid in, in, in my world it was legal, you know, like it's not a drug man. It's legal. It's a simple high too. It's just like, well I'm a simple guy. Yale. Yeah. Okay. Sample high and there's a, there's a, there's a spot for alcohol in, in one's life. I would, I would assume, but uh, yeah, it gets a bit more complex with psychedelics and weed and shit like this.

Speaker 2:          00:10:15       Um, uh, and, and, and heroin and at first, you know, is it's really actually it's a psychedelic at first and then it becomes a day to day drag and routine, which a, you're not using the drug. That drug is using you, all these great cliches, blah, blah, blah, blah. How long does that take? When is the honeymoon over with heroin? Oh, well technically, uh, looking back on my days, a couple of decades of doing that, I would say after the very first hit, really? Oh No. And then you spend the next 20 years trying to recreate that first hit. Now are you able to like try heroin? Right? This is so bad for kids listening. Were you able to try heroin and walk away from it? Is can people try it and walk away from it and just be like, yeah, you know, I did it. I just, yeah, I think, I think there are, and especially because the first time you do it generally, uh, it, it, it consumes the body.

Speaker 2:          00:11:10       So much that you're just so not used to this kind of like forced, uh, almost hyperloop tunnel into the unknown that a, you throw up, a lot of people throw up their first time. It's like you can like air sick as you're teleporting into another reality. Seriously. It's, it's like that a lot of people, like I remember the first time I got drunk, I was like eight years old. My parents had some kind of like sixties kind of Tiki themed cocktail party for their mess. Sounds like drew Barrymore's childhood. Somebody gives you an eight ball, right? He turned, Hey, let's get it from an eight ball.

Speaker 2:          00:11:47       Uh, fall. Great parents. No, but like I, I went around and, and emptied all the drinks that people had left at this Tiki themed party. My parents, I was about eight and I think they're mainly drinking like some kind of gin based relations, evil. Oh, it's evil evil. And I drank that and I got so violently sick that I never wanted to drink liquor again. But here I am. I mean I still drank liquor. It's the same thing with heroin. It's like their first time you're going to probably get sick because your body is overwhelmed. You sorta Halluc I always thought it just made just super relaxed. Like my only idea of it wasn't trainspotting when that guy shot up in the room, he just fell into the rug and sunk into the floor, which actually I was like, wow, that looks amazing. Yeah. Yeah, I like that.

Speaker 2:          00:12:33       I just can't deal with the side effects. I mean that scene and get out where like the, the lady hits the, the teaspoon on the cup and then floats down the chair of the black dude. And uh, I mean you also have trips like that on heroin. Heroin is actually an opiod. I mean, Alistair Crowley and even, uh, Lord Byron from like the 18th century, they used to dabble and uh, opiates, morphine back then. And uh, just like, whoa. You know, and there's bad trips and good trips, but it is trip. So except that a lot of the times you're not awake during the Detroit, so it's more like a controlled or uncontrolled dreamscape that you're having. Even more uncontrolled, unusual. How do your legs feel afterwards? Like whenever I'm packing the day when New York was New York and like every, you know, 10th corner, there would be a junkie just nodding out on heroin.

Speaker 2:          00:13:25       I remember Mark Marin uses this hilarious bit about how they never tip over or something like that, but I don't, yeah. And the thing was, but they would be in like doing like the longest squat ever. You know what I mean? You know, if you do like a set of tennis squats, like you're fucking thighs of burdens. Like how does that feel? That's, that's what I would think. I wouldn't think, man, this guy's fucking his life up. It's minus 30 Audi has no coat on and he's just standing this slowly going down to the ground. Like how do you leg slowly, how do you lay eggs? Yeah. All right. Well, okay. What do they feel like afterwards? Ask yourself this man. Let's say transport yourself to the Amazon jungle. You've got sloths there, right? That sit there and hang on this one branch for like days at a time.

Speaker 2:          00:14:10       Right. Those things only poop like once a week. I'm, I'm thinking about getting one as a pet so when I go on tour and so I just put a diaper on him and I come home and I don't have to clean anything up that just have a slot hanging out. He's only moved three feet over. I love these animals, but it's just the same thing as being a junkie. You're very much like a sloth. And I'll say this much for sloths. Uh, you can test them all you want, but they've been around for over 3 million years now that, is there a group of people out there just trashing sloths? I just like how you said you can do this. You can talk shit about them all. You will. I've seen it. I've seen it on the inner webs where like people are like downright bashing sloths.

Speaker 2:          00:14:51       I'm like such a sad world. Well, well that's capitalism. That's America. It's like we don't like sloths. We like go getters. You know, if you count you fat, fuck, I'm trying to make money off you as well. That's what, that's what a sloth is like being a junkie. And yes, you can do superhuman feats of hang on a tree branch for three days and you can go into a squat position. You probably thought like, you know what, you're in an alley. You're high out of your fucking mind on heroin and you go, I gotta take a shit and you probably start the squat and about three days later you finally finish up shit.

Speaker 2:          00:15:29       Well, you know what? The one thing that the one good side effects of heroin seems to be if you survive is you're kind of in shapes borderline shredded for the rest of your life. What is that dude? I every fucking guy that heavy rocks I've ever seen that they had a 10 year period on heroin. They're like 70. They had like 0% body fat. They still have ads. It wasn't for the old skin hanging off of them. They could model underwear. Man, you just described me perfect. Yeah. Going to like it. But uh, no. I asked William Burroughs, what the fuck is going on around here? They'll leave blower. Oh Geez. I don't even know who that guy is. So you should use the leaf blower. He's, I think he's from Terminator Vibe. It's probably how he breaks into houses. That's his thing. He just walks around with a leaf blower.

Speaker 2:          00:16:11       William Burroughs at 78 looked like he did at 18 which at 18 he looked like he was 78 but it never changed. Right. It was like this weird pickling and although how had human attics get that, they get pickled. Not only was I on heroin, but of course I was on the Methadone program for 18 years, invented by the Nazis. You know another thing to be, you don't have a wrinkle on your face too hilarious. But all this shit, I'm fucking pickle and it's been 15 years since I even touch their shit. I basically heard your podcast last week bitching about like, oh, you're 50 and you're, let me tell you the next 10 years because I'm going to be turning 60 this year. You're in fucked fill now, man. No, I'm going staying in my fifties no, I don't. I know I'm carrying. How old are you trying to Olga? Fuck. Oh No. Oh No. You treat me like a slot right now. Now I resent it. You're fucked. I mean just uh, look, I'll get up and I ride 20 miles a day on a stationary. Tell everybody what you watch when you do it. Do remember you telling me this, you were last time I talked to the show, the reality show used to watch when you would owe that 600 pound life.

Speaker 2:          00:17:24       So you'd sit there and watch and I mean my wife started watching us. I was like, Mia you have to shut this off cause I watch biggest loser then they have are funny fat they are. But they are funny fan and the shower scenes, 600 pound life. As soon as they focus in on a girl named Kirsten or something, then the next seven minutes are her taking off her clothes and getting into a shower. It's literally fat core porn on TV know. And the thing is they don't

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       have like, like with the guys, they don't have to blur out anything because they're fat covers, right. It's like they have, they have like a fucking speedo made out of fat. Oh, I saw this one guy, he was like, can lean up against the wall in the shower and his stomach hung all the way down to his fucking ankles. I mean, yeah. Oh my God. And then they'd come in and the wife will come in and she has like, you know, that, that you, you know, the do it yourself car wash where they got that scrub brushes. They do, we have one hand is lifting up a roll of fat and she's just, and the guys in there like, ah, like it's like he's trying to hold up a refrigerator, but it's something, it's himself. I love that show that, and uh, I'll ride every day to either a 600 pound life or body bizarre, which is, what is that?

Speaker 3:          00:18:37       Oh, that's, that's things where people have tails and eight legs, uh, joined at the hip to head. I was like, birth defects. Yeah. Allen, what do they call it? And uh, uh, body bizarre. You gotta chill. They went to PT Barnum. They were like, okay, birth defects. I don't feel like people are gonna Watch it if we call that. Totally. It's, it's the only thing to ride too. If you want to do an exercise program, just like watch that shit and ride and just, you feel better about like trying to do something for yourself, you know, it's just like, wow, these people have really gone to shit. I'm kicking ass. I would love to hear them brainstorming for that show a weird bodies now. Now let's get alliteration going.

Speaker 3:          00:19:22       Body Bonanza body. Bizarre. Bizarre. Yeah. I don't, uh, I don't know. I actually dropped some weight since last time I saw you. Hey look good. And I'm going to try. I totally fucking dragged that compliment Nadia. I laid off the booze for like four months and now I've been like trying to eat, uh, staying away from the breads and all that gluten shit. And I actually, you know, as much as that's a big Hollywood thing, I feel a lot better. But every once in a while I'll fucking, you know, I'll eat a pizza and it's delicious. I can never just like totally walk away. Like, what? I'm never going to have a pizza again and I'm not going to eat that stupid gluten free one. That's like fat Dan. This gluten free. What is what, what is that? I mean it's like Vladimir Gluten. That's all I know is all my friends are fucking Vladimir Gluten.

Speaker 3:          00:20:06       Their dictator is on there. I don't know what it is. I just know I'm losing weight doing it and I eat that Ezekiel bread, which just tastes like ass. I mean it's really just like, it's like if you took bread and stuck it in a microwave and all the nutrients left. Um, but you know, if you put enough shit on it, if you put a little almond butter on it, it does taste good. And I am losing weight. I don't know, but I feel like I'm still eating salads and shit. It's like, remember when people, people were on like that, that, what was that diet where it's like, dude, I can eat taken all day as long as I don't eat this. And it's just like, yeah, the Atkins Diet. Yeah, they had car. Yeah. No carbs, no cars. Yeah. It spawned a whole beer industry of low carb beer.

Speaker 3:          00:20:45       Yes. Where you like shit out of cow head at the end of the fucking day. Horns at all. Yeah. I remember my watching my friends doing that. I just remember thinking like that can't be good. Like just eating meat all the fucking time. Like they, they didn't seem like they were eating salads. They would just sit in there. They we'd like eating bacon and like Turkey and not saying any of that Shit's bad. Cause who knows at this point there's guys out there that stick and now like they're putting melted butter into their coffee. Oh God, I know. No, but they're saying that like that all of that saturated fat shit that they were saying is now a myth. It's like, it's like the egg in my lifetime. The egg when he times is the egg been in and out and out and Andy over the month or not. It's like John Travolta's career to John Travolta fucking Saturday night fever, sweat hogs. Right. Then he fucking went away in the 80s that he came back with pulp fiction than he did fucking battlefield earth. And I don't know what he's doing now, but I feel like he's going to come back again.

Speaker 2:          00:21:38       You know what, I'm, I'm actually one of the few people that, dude, this is embarrassing. This is probably the most embarrassing thing you're going to get me to say on this pod. I love it. Is I actually liked battlefield earth. Oh, you did? I never saw it. I thought Forrest Whitaker is in it for God's sake.

Speaker 3:          00:21:54       Okay. Barry peppers in it. Barry Pepper's, none of these guys want us to mention that, but those are all great actors. Yes.

Speaker 2:          00:21:59       Great actors. And it was written by all Ron Hubbard, which is basically the same thing that is, uh, ancient aliens. Guy Zacharias Cichon wrote in his book the 12th Planet, uh, about how we've been colonized for 400,000 years starting in South Africa where they took apes and genetically made them into like gold mine workers because they needed gold dust to protect their, uh, uh, plant, uh, the, the, the ozone on their planet or some kind of crazy shit. Either way. It's totally believable to me. I mean, I don't care one way or the other, you know, but like, but, but that included with all those good actors in this kind of tie in to sounded like star wars mixed with roots mixed with mushrooms mixed with mushrooms. There you go. I actually like battlefield earth. I remember a avoid. So that's what that movie was about. Yeah, yeah. It was like a, a colonizing a dumb ass humans, which they just made from apes through their DNA and uh, and had them all like mining gold for, because they needed the gold on their home planet and this and that. And John Travolta had dreads just like I got now. Right. It was like, no, I'm thinking that movie. It was pretty cool. And I remember getting a lot of shit for it going, Oh, I'm all for this movie at the time. And now it's like, okay, I'm going

Speaker 3:          00:23:15       perishingly admitting that. Yeah, that was pretty cool. Well, what's really interesting to plot is interesting. So wait, the Scientologists think that we came from apes, I thought they'd throw some sort of spatial. Okay. Oh

Speaker 2:          00:23:27       yeah, yeah. There's a spaceship that comes down and they needed, uh, they, they tried to have their own people mind these gold mines and these people just said, fuck you. I want to go back to my home planet. This is bullshit work, man. This is like, this is like working as a Barista at Starbucks or Mcdonald's. And so get these age to do

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       it that are already on the planet. And so they genetically engineered them to be a little bit smarter and then they started mining the gold and those guys could hang out and drink. So is that where my tax money's going? Yeah. He's going to another planet. Black projects, man. Black projects are all over the place. What a black projects. Ah, you know, all the shits like Alex Jones is on about every day except he's way off the mark. But just like what? They don't think that guys hit the nail on the head over there. Why not a 10? I mean, he's swinging big. Yeah, he's swinging big over there. It was in the major leagues. His batting average would be about one 39. I know, but when he connects, but when he connects, you know it's going, it's leaving the park. That's why you go. Yeah. Do you want to see a guy swinging like that out of right out of his fucking cleats. That's it, man. I can't listen. I used to be into all of that shit and like, I see you guys. What are we watching? MSNBC and a, I like how they walk around now when they're doing the news to add some level of excitement to it. Uh, ESPN does it. They all fucking, they all walk around. I don't watch any of that.

Speaker 1:          00:24:48       This shit. All right. First read of the week here and don't cheat. Oh, uh, talk about how made to measure suits compared to generic. Off The rack suits.

Speaker 2:          00:29:56       Okay. And that's the ad reads. And now back to the podcast. Do you know I was talking to you today on my podcast? Like what was it? Will Sharon before or fire right there? There was a bunch of pro second amendment people just standing and they just were yelling America love it or leave it. Right. And uh, I just like, the whole thing that's fascinating to me is that, you know, these guys rotors amendment way back in the day and it's just like, well shit does evolve. I mean, it was an amendment. So they were, weren't they? There was a change to what already existed and like he, you, you do have to adjust because I don't have, I don't have, cause I don't have a problem with guns. I don't have a problem with the argument right away. Is there on the corner yelling America love it or leave it.

Speaker 2:          00:30:39       So they obviously don't love it because they're on a corner at fucking four or five on Wilshire yelling. So they don't love it. So why don't they leave it? They just get, because Norway doesn't fucking want them. Oh, all right. I don't know. I don't, that's why did they not have guns out there in Norway? How do they keep their people under control? No guns. I know, I look, I don't have a, yeah, I don't think there's anything wrong with guns. If you fucking own them responsibly, they just have to figure out a way. If they could just figure out a fucking way to make sure that these fucking lunatics who then go on social media saying, I'm going to do this shit. And everybody kind of ignores it. Ah, hey man, it's, it's this, it's this simple. If you get a couple of Duis, they take your license away, right?

Speaker 2:          00:31:22       If you're going to get a gun and you've had a couple batteries, assaults, domestic shit, all sorts of crappy stuff, and you torture and animals as a child and you've been thrown out of five schools, probably not a good idea to get a gun. I have nothing against guns either. I mean, look, uh, you know, if you're some grizzly Adams type of living in a cabin in Colorado shooting grizzly bears for Hyde's food tent sustenance, this and that, good on Ya. You know, you're probably a responsible gun owner. Oh, he's cute. He's going to create the next people can guys that like this all goes to shit, got beat up too much in high school. They weren't part of the cool clique. They started making threats on Youtube, this and that and the other. They beat up their wives, their girlfriends, this and that. They beat up their moms.

Speaker 2:          00:32:07       They've, you know, don't give him a fucking gun. Joined a band. Yeah. Get into show business like the rest of us were presently hiring roadies now. Well speaking to that before we get all sideways here, but the politics, I can't fucking hear myself anymore. He let me take this out, put it back and come on your best today. Where is it? Where's the sweet spot? There is um, you got a new album coming up. Oh yeah. Right. Tell us, tell us the name. Tell us about it. I listened to one track. I love the harmonica on it. Then haunting like with the, with the reverb on it and stuff. Uh,

Speaker 3:          00:32:39       I don't know what, whatever the name of the track was, but maybe why it made me call twilight zone. It made me want to go play drums. That's how I know I like a sock is I immediately go into fantasy mode and whatever cool thing is happening, I'm doing it. So at first I was playing drums and then when you did the harmonica part, then that was me and my fantasy. I was playing that and everybody was gazing up at the stage going, wow, look how awesome bill is. So you're one for one. That could still happen. Oh, okay. Now I know we've all heard you to come onstage before and you pussied out. I didn't pussy out. What are you talking about? Why that Danzig at that? Uh, whatever. I couldn't make it down there. Oh this is the thing. If you want look like we were ready to bring you a helicopter to fly down on the stage and have you come back and play drums for us.

Speaker 3:          00:33:23       Now that you said I'm a pussy, I'll, I'll do it. I'm playing a little bit of double bass now. I just don't want to ruin it. I don't want to ruin it because people come in there to see you like and that you knew what it wants to cause you were doing a festival so I figure you played a shorter set. Yay. But if you'll go on there and it's a full on you show, if you have some jerk off comic, come on for one song. I think the crowd can handle that. But if it's just like, hey, we only got time for six songs, and on one of them, the guy from VH ones, I love the 80 strikes back is going to play drums. And I know you guys might get a kick out of that. I'm just worried that you fans like what, what they're gonna fucking throw at me when I'm up there.

Speaker 3:          00:34:01       But my favorite guest appearance for us of all time was, uh, during Lollapalooza we had a Kirk Hammett from Metallica. Oh Wow. Come on stage. We'd known Kirk for a while and we, we'd opened up from Metallica on a bunch of dates in Europe. And so we got to be friends and, and, and Kirk came out and we did a cover of a black sabbath song called super not at a festival. Uh, and, and we're playing it and we gave him the second lead in the song. So he started going crazy. I mean, his hair was flying. It looked like he had one of those industrial blow dryers on his hair and there was a whole blow dryer. It just, his hair was flinging around. He was into it. He was into it and all that, but it just went on for fucking ever and so the rest of the band was just like, well fuck it.

Speaker 3:          00:34:47       We're out of here. So we all just walked off and by the, by the time he realized what was happening and he's still in the middle of his lead, there's no band members up there and we're all standing there on the side of the stage, like looking at our watches going, dude, really? This is now like going on a 12 minute solo. You fucking, oh no. So then we'll wait. What point? He told me later. It's like he didn't want to leave the stage because he realized he was going to get shit when he left, so we might as well keep going at that point, I think it wound up to be like a 17 minutes. So locally, because I knew he was going to get his ass beat on this things. If you guys leave and then he doesn't leave, it looks like it's planned.

Speaker 3:          00:35:27       Right? Well, it wasn't planned. We were just bored right now. What is the etiquette? If somebody goes to see, you know, five, eight, you've been in a fucking that to me, if you guys that would be a Larry Self, you leave me out there and I'll be up there. Boom, crack, crack. I sit along, I can do that before I get killed. That's when you start incorporating the Tom Thompson shows that what I do, what I would do is I would just, I would do a backward somersault off the stool, crawl my way out underneath the curtain. Did he get mad at you guys or do you think it was funny? No, he was, he was scared shitless by the time he got off and then we're, we all acted pest and now it's just like, ah, that was fun man. You know, and just, but he was kind of scared at first, but uh, he's never come back this ever since.

Speaker 3:          00:36:13       He just got back on stage. We don't get a lot of guest artist anymore. Well, I'm sure he told that story. I'm imagining that that went around. I don't know if he didn't want to repeat that story. He was pretty freaked out. Uh, I have told it anyway. So you've got this new album coming out when it comes out on on, was it March 6th when it comes out? March nights. Nights? Yeah. It's a Friday. Okay. Very nice. He night shrooms. Woo. That's right. Shroom weekend. And where can, where can people get it? Oh, I guess everywhere. I don't know. Oh God. I mean, what are you really creative guys on the worst promoted we'll share with uh, with a billboard and start hawking cds. I mean, I don't know where these things are sold. What was it going to be on a diet? They are sold anymore.

Speaker 3:          00:36:55       They just like, you know, by the time we post this, I'm sure someone will give me a link and I'll be able to tell people where to get it. I mean, I, you've been in this business long enough that you know, that the whole purpose of this is to get people to hear your shit, man. I've been in this business long enough to also know that I don't really give a fuck about this part of the business. Okay. I just kinda like do what I do. And you know now you were influenced by, like I always heard those guys you were talking about, oh, Bill Burroughs as you call him William Burroughs, right? Yeah, it didn't, those guys, they would write type out a bunch, oh, pages, story, and then they would cut up all the, every word individually. They throw it in the air and then tape it all together. Yeah, and then they would just start writing from that, you know? No, that, that's what I did

Speaker 2:          00:37:38       on in 1980 was it 88 or some shit around like land of rape and honey. I decided to do an album like that based on William Burroughs riding, which is how I hooked up with him later. I just took a bunch of pieces of tape. Yes. We actually use tape back then, not just digital and just cut it all up into various pieces and threw it on the floor, spilled coffee on, I'm snorting coke off of them or did whatever and then put them back together. Some were backwards, somewhere forward, some worse, some not, and then put it together in an actually told a narrative, which is what bill Burroughs was saying. I almost did it as an experiment gone. This guy is crazy. That can't just happen. Like he's just throw shit random on the floor and it talks to you, but 90% of the time it seemed to work like wow, like you couldn't have done that yourself. So it's like you're, you're, you're throwing yourself to like random chance of it coming out good. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:38:31       sometimes it does. Why don't you get the balls to do that? You got a record deal and everybody is trying

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       so hard to do it the way that everybody's doing it. You have the ability to do it that way. How did you get the balls to be like, ah, well you independent at that point so you could take that kind of rest. He just didn't care. I, I'd done a couple records for major labels at that point. I did this horrific record where they took over the whole thing out for errors to records. Then I did this other record for Warner Brothers that, uh, pretty much gave me carte blanche, but it was still like learning to crawl before you walk. By the time I got to that record, I was just sick of all these people. I figured like if, if these are the people that claimed to know what they're doing, then I must be fucking Einstein because these people are adults. So I just decided to do whatever the fuck I wanted to do, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:39:20       Right. So how did you come up with, uh, what does, what does that song, uh, uh, I'm the fucking worst. It said thing. We stigmata that guitar riff on that. I always thought the guy had a slide at Donna, an aunt, my aunt and I, yeah, that, that is a sliding and somebody told me, you sped it up. Well, I did that too. And I also added a Didgeridoo onto that to get that slide. I get really meticulous on my show. That's one of the sickest riffs of all time. I played that for my wife and she was like, what the fuck is this? This is awesome. And then you went way over the top and then, you know, then she kind of left it that, well back then people weren't using distortive vocals either. And that was actually quite the accident because, uh, we, we had this cheap, Sony asked Mike that ran on batteries and the batteries were low and when I went to sing that first scream, it just sounded like a cat was being tortured.

Speaker 2:          00:40:18       Like bill, it sounds great. Let's keep it, you know. So we, and then we started trying to replicate that sound for the next 10 years. You know, it's Kinda like your first heroin hit in the next 10 years. I think we should have kept that microphone in those batteries. So what did you do? You just use like the bull horn? Cause I've seen the clips of your, your live shows are unbelievable and their Osa terrifying. Like I love him. That gave me the chills as I'm watching it. But then there's a part of me going, you know, I'm glad I wasn't in like that fucking pit down front. Cause especially the way I look back then I look like fucking ruin Howard way back in the day before it looked like a itch injury. Rent our, our pit is like a, it's scary for us too. We looked at these fucking kids and we're like, uh, you know, like, like I said, I'm pushing 60 and I'm looking at these 20 year old kids and I'm thinking like these could be literally physically my grandkids and I'm worried about our future.

Speaker 2:          00:41:12       And so what, what's, what a bit on stage man. What's some of the weirdest shit or scary shit you've seen when you were on stage? Um, you know what? No, no, I don't have anything that's like particularly like, like a, you know, hear about like what was, there's some rap concert the other day that a, they stopped the concert because they saw a girl being raped in the front row or we're in the pit or something like that. And uh, uh, I've never, how does that happen? Like the other people don't see that it is so large. What riff were they playing that everyone was so locked into it that there's literally somebody getting raped next to you and you can't see it? I don't know. I don't understand that. I've never seen anything like that. Actually. Some of the stairway, uh, stay. Would it have been maybe people love that one that they just waiting for that drum fill?

Speaker 2:          00:42:00       Well, well that, that would be like, uh, it, uh, if, if I saw something really weird on a stairway to heaven song, uh, at a led Zeppelin concert, it would probably be a hobbit being raped in the pit because I never understood this about led Zeppelin. Don't take me wrong, I love the fucking band, but, uh, this guy, basically his lyrics, we've given them a pass. All these things about his dungeons, dragons, castles, maidens, horses, and his Dick. It's and his tick that squeeze my lemon or whatever. I mean, I mean, this guy's really coasted, this Robert Plank Guy Matt here, and I love the fucking band. Don't take, did you ever get to see them? Oh yeah, of course. And then they just amazing. What tours did you see them on the page? Uh, I saw him at the Chicago Stadium and like what? 75, 76, 77, something like that.

Speaker 2:          00:42:57       I mean, so bottom had the vista light at that point, right? The orange seethrough one? No, he was strutting around and he's, Oh, a little bit drunk. He gets better. Well, while they were in town. Okay. They spent three days in Chicago and he did his show at the Chicago Stadium, the old stadium and a, I once saw that and then I had to work at wax tracks. So the, no, so this is like 79. So he's got the stainless steel kit? No, no, no. He was walking around with like a little, uh, like girly top tied off around mid torso. And then, uh, uh, Robert Plant, I think some of them bought them. I'm telling my bell bottoms there were as wide as this coffee table and he's strutting around doing all this stuff. And at that point he's in his mid to late forties. Um, and I just thought like, um, I just thought, damn it, this is inappropriate.

Speaker 2:          00:43:54       He was funny. He wasn't, he was only like 30 or 31 well he was born in like 48, mid forties so maybe you should have stuck to heroin because he wasn't picky, easy turning around and I'm going like, that's like, uh, he's, he's doing like this chicken dance and stuff on here and singing about hobbits and, and I, I immediately zoned out and paid no attention. He just listened to like the tightness of the band and you can plant did get old quick though. He was like a young guy and then right after physical graffiti, he just got all the lines in his face. Yeah, it's weird. I think that's genetic. So I think that's that, that's kind of like a Nordic thing. I think he must be, have Nordic Dna because that's what happens to Scandinavian people. They look so awesome when they're young and then because their genetics tell them like when they're old, they've spent 40 years of Nordic winters and their skin says, fuck you, I'm cracking wrinkling now.

Speaker 2:          00:44:51       They just needed some lotion, but he looks cool now though. He needs lotion, but he looks cool now though. It looks great now he found the low sheer, but he never, yeah, you could, but you can tell his face. He never did heroin. Yeah. He didn't give hope. Gone. I got, that's hilarious. You can look at old people and tell the drugs that they did. Um, well, a, I, you're also, a lot of people might not know this about you is you're a huge hockey fan or they literally in the house building shit right now. Yeah. Yeah. This is destruction zone one. This is, let's call we've done, we've done almost 40 minutes before the hammering started saying, Oh, you know, and Rassie brought up led Zepplin hammer of the gods. Oh, right, right there. Huh? Jesus. Oh yeah. That was, that was a book that put me to sleep.

Speaker 2:          00:45:37       I believed every word of it. Oh, I do too. Get Sleep. It's compared to like the shit we did and not only just us talking to you put a shark in a woman and then what happened? It, well, what's the water is shark. It was a dolphin. No, no, no. It was a bathtub. Plastic Shark. And One of our roadies was penetrating a girl willingly. There was no rape. I wasn't about us, not about zipline. Oh No, I'm talking about our tour. And I've seen, I've seen some crazy shit. I mean, that's unfolding five random. That is that I sprouted bringing in a shark, putting it in a woman. Who the fuck does that? And you actually had a story, you know? Yeah. It wasn't a real shark. It was a toy shark. And it wasn't me. And it wasn't the band that was on, we had two buses.

Speaker 2:          00:46:25       We had the road crew boss and the ban shark bus and, and, and the band bus basically had some kind of decorum going on, but the, the crew bus was literally, Dante is ninth gate of Hell. I mean, you know, walk on there. And it was just like calendula on steroids going out. Oh Wow. That shit that you'd see. And I just don't wander because like, say I'd, I'm out of, I'm out of smokes. I go in to borrow a pack of smokes from one of the roadies because none of the bands smokes. And so I'd go and I'd walk in and just walk into like Dante's inferno stepping through an orgy to get a human mind field of fornication. Try not to step on anybody's fucking heads. Um, yeah. Well, you know, I'm actually, uh, I, I've had the exact opposite experience on the road where it's just been a lonely, isolated thing, but I was kind of built for the lay people. Somebody was asking you about that shit. You know about being on the road and like groupies and stuff. It's just like, dude, that just doesn't fucking, it's different. It can fuck me. It's just not, it's not what like to, you guys go up there with a fucking Ukulele and you just fucking

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       brown and all of a sudden this fucking panties flying at you. You know what's true? I'm not saying you, I'm not saying you, but you know me. I get just bolts and coins and bottles flying at me. I don't get panicked. I'm not stuck. Um, you know, some fucking jerk off could go to a God damn coffee house on an open mic. All right. And he can fucking go up there with the Ukulele. It's, he could literally do his cover, probably do a reggae version of a Mama and papa song. Right. All the leaves of Brown man. Right. And they don't even get to the next to that. And the next thing you know, there's be some woman is going to fuck a respond to it, you know w yeah. But how many people do you travel with when, when you go on the road? Nobody. I go by myself. I am like have a handler. No, I have like open it. Nah, it's just more people I got to talk to. I don't have a look. If I go to another country and I don't mean Canada. Yeah. I mean another country.

Speaker 3:          00:48:28       I uh, wait, no, when I did Canada, they get, they gave like a road person. I, I, it drives me up the fucking wall. Uh, but when I'm in another country, I love it. When I was in Australia, the guy had was fucking awesome and I'm definitely gonna use him again when I was like, I cover my bases here so that they can be shit coming from the stage with you. In other words, he traveled alone. You just go home to Australia. I'm going a lot if I'm going to Australia. What? I love it. I love having a tour manager because he shows up and it's just like, all right, this is what you need to be. Boom. I don't have to worry about anything. And there's transportation. Um, when I go into England, I've had great people and all of that type of stuff, pray, people, Scandinavian, all that shit. But in the states, no, I just show up on the wall. I get a rent a car, like fucking Chuck Berry drive up with my mic, stand in the car. That keeps the overhead low. That's the thing.

Speaker 2:          00:49:14       That's where things get dicey when like our, our touring parties, about 17 people between band and crew and, uh, there's generally three or four rookies on, on each tour. And the rookies have read too many books like Hammer. The gods are, yeah. Yeah. And so they bring that, that that shit onto the buses. Mainly on the crew boss. Uh, we haven't had, we've had the most boring band bus for probably about almost 12, 13 years. Thank God. Because

Speaker 3:          00:49:49       did you guys sit there and playing like cards against humanity? Like that's a crazy night actually.

Speaker 2:          00:49:55       You know what? No, we, we just, we get the fuck off the bus. We stay in our little areas and get the fuck off the bus and go to the hotel as soon as possible. And then, then are like stupid shit happens at the hotel bar. Not so much on the bus. The bus is like, kind of like this. I'm a big hotel bar guy. I love it because it's like you're already kind of home. It's like you downstairs in your own kitchen and, and then you can just drink down there and then just tell bar tenders are always like, I don't even, I think their,

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       they're good. Right? Oh, at least at the hotels he stayed, I'd say Sheridan's Hilton's this and that. Radissons, blah, blah, blah. We reached at that, that kind of shit. Those hotel bartenders in every city are, are like, they must've taken a class because they're all real similar. They're all psychology based, drink pour. My favorite hotel bar is the one you can, you can be like staying on the 10th floor and you can look down over at the elevator to see if it's still open. You know, those ones rather than half of all the way down and you'll just see these drunk sitting down. And I had still going here. Then we got to get gone down. You don't have to call anybody or anything like that. So, um, hey, is there a cause I do want to promote your album, man. I think you're a fucking genius.

Speaker 3:          00:51:13       So is there any sort of theme on this one? Is it just, uh, yeah, look man, I mean I've been known to bash our, uh, right wing friends before and are right wing leaders such as George Bush and Ronald Reagan and things in the past. But uh, this, this one is not real anti Trump. It's more like what kind of system keeps producing these people? Uh, let, let's uh, let's cut to the quick here. It's the system that keeps producing these people that we keep thinking is a good idea to be our spokesperson for our ideals and a, and the quality of these people keeps going down and down and down. So rather than a attack, it is fallen off where we, we at least we had like low bar, we add like we used to have career politician, then we went to like the boss's son.

Speaker 3:          00:52:04       Yeah. And now we've got like a reality show, like a TV star and now, which is causing all these people out here in Hollywood to go like, I want to run like the second you say you want to run for president. Yeah. Your body and mind you, you're basically saying, you saying I want to have dead bodies on my conscience because that's what the fuck you signing up for. And I'm not saying that you're going to have to go out and do the wrong thing, but like in the process of doing the right thing, you're going to kill people that would just in the wrong place. That's why I think they age the way they do it because it's like it's heavy. Yeah. Fucking heavy. I get asked this question all the time in interviews. All right, Mr Political, what would, what's the first thing you'd do if you were president? I'd fucking quit. He could. I don't want any part of this shit. I put the solar panels back on the White House and then I'd leave. Yeah. Okay. I will and I'll do a, personally, I would do that and I would get, I'd have the guy, the chef to the chef make me a sandwich and I want to ride in the helicopter and then that's it.

Speaker 3:          00:53:06       I now introduce you to the vice president and the person who will now be running all of this shit. You gotta throw one party in on Air Force One, one, one big kind. It looks like a giant like fucking thing. I always fly in the Marine One helicopter. Always look bad ass to me. You're old enough to remember it. Old Seven 47 fleet of via ever fly seven 47 I went to jail or you got to go to the Ronald Reagan Library on, you know, they have that. They have, they have literally the one that he sat on talking to Gorbachev or get to go upstairs to that bar and hang out with the cool people or you're a fly on that seven 47 I'd always wanted to do, I did that one time. I got busted twice and sent right back down. You know, it was a spiral staircase and you went, you went up there and everybody had suits in this fucking stewardesses.

Speaker 3:          00:53:48       We'll hot bath. Yeah. When we were, uh, I did this, this run through Asia, I did, um, um, the fuck did I, Singapore, Hong Kong and then Mumbai, India and leaving Mumbai, India. We connected through Dubai and we got on that Air Emirates. Oh, that, that, that's not even an airline at w it's like a w hotel with like with wings. Yeah. It's fucking unreal. So, and that's even like, it, it's better than a w w was like a w hotel like acts like it's nice. It's, it's like nice if you were in your twenties, you see a lot of fucking very twenties, a lot of aquarium lighting around the bed and shit. But so we, we were, uh, we were, I came up, we were upstairs or whatever. All I remember was we, uh, when, if I were going to fly that far, I use all the miles, every fucking thing I can possibly do, make less money.

Speaker 3:          00:54:37       Yeah. I'm going to sit at least have one of those bed shares. And um, so I got up to go to the bathroom and I walked in the back to go to the bathroom and they had like the semicircular bar. Yeah. Like, cause it was one of those wide body. So there was like chair two chairs next to the window, then an aisle than the middle than an aisle and then all of a, so that middle section it was, is that, it was that wide in the back where it had like a semicircle and a bartender in there. And they had a little bench seat and some stools around their bench seat with a seatbelt that you sat down on. So I saw it. You were up there and I went back. I didn't have the one go autograph. I didn't have the one where you had to like your own apartment like that one.

Speaker 3:          00:55:19       That one's like 15 grand one way this. So, um, I went back and I got my wife, I said, Hey, can I, uh, can I buy you a drink? She goes, well, you're talking about, go come with me. So we went to the back. We were like, she and she just ear to ear grin and I ordered a couple mixed drinks. We sat down on the little bench seat. I put a seatbelt on, put mine on and we just sat there. We didn't have that many, but it was just so fucking cool. It's w it didn't seem possible. It's like I at a bar in the sky. I know they flying drones flying to New York. It was one of those things where I was very excited to get back to the states, but that was definitely one that I didn't want it to end. Where you just like, oh my God.

Speaker 3:          00:56:00       It's the exact opposite of riding and coach where it's like you could literally be flying from like fucking New York to Buffalo. Did your neck start hurting to, sorry, it was sitting side by side. I came by that mustache. Oh, okay. And uh, I don't know what you're doing. You're taking stuff out from underneath the uh, all right then my love to say what's going on right? I don't know. He took legal. Is it legal? I don't know what it is. It looks like he has all that is wine or didn't think of it. I thought that was like liquid weed. You're going to pour into the vaporizer and it reaches a certain temperature.

Speaker 2:          00:56:35       Let me tell you something, man, you are fucking rock star because I've never had an experience that good flying. The closest thing I ever had was I did an 18 hour flight to Australia once and I was on the last fucking flight that allowed smoking on nine seats, only on nine seats in business class. So it wasn't, first class wasn't coach and they had nine seats arranged on Quantus for people who smoke. And if I'm going to be 18 hours on an airplane, I want to fucking cigarette. You know nowadays you got the East cigs and it's really easy. Nobody knows your fucking like nicotine out of your mind on these planes. Right? Cause I'm a flyer and puffing on my east egg and nobody bothers me and I don't bother anyone else. But this was the last smoking flight Quantis ever had. It was actually in the news and I was one of the people that had those seats and a, so I get there and there's this businessman from Hong Kong next to me and he immediately starts blowing his nose on the tray in front of them and there's boogers and shit all over the sheet in front of me can just notice.

Speaker 2:          00:57:43       And I was just like, stewardess, man, I can't sit next to this fucking guy. Okay. He's, he was really weird. It was rude.

Speaker 3:          00:57:53       Oh yeah. The, I think you're being really nice about this guy. It's just define that as weird and rude

Speaker 2:          00:57:59       and, and the, the flight was booked so they put me on one of those comic Kasi sheets at the stewardess just sit on right before they do a little jump seat, a little jump seat. So they put me in there. So I was like, all right, cool. Why don't they sit the her up? They're like, well that's the point. So like I'm sitting there and I light up a smoke and they just like flipped out. Like you can't be smoking here. Like what are you doing? I'm like, well I'm not sitting next to that fucking guy. So we had this like two hour standoff and they tried to get the guide and move and he wouldn't move. And so they finally acquiesce since it was the last flight, which smoking, I got to sit there on the jump seat and just change.

Speaker 3:          00:58:38       That was like my rock star flying story. Man with Hong Kong, you know when I flew from Singapore to Hong Kong, I'm defensive Hong Kong. This guy might've been from Singapore, he might've been from New Hampshire, I didn't talk to him, but up in the uh, the lounge there, they had a, they had these fucking, they would make a dump like all right, the fucking dumplings that they make over there dude. And they literally think if you dropped them, if they would like float plane, no, in the, in the airport. Right, right, right, right. So they keep coming out with these dumplings and this motherfucker keeps going up to and he would like take seven out of eight of them. He was a skinny bastard and he was just fun. It was like a, do you remember about Paul Newman and uh, uh, get mad at them eggs. Cool Hand Luke.

Speaker 3:          00:59:19       He was eating them like fucking hand. Luke just sticking up down his fucking throat and they were delicious and it was just like every time they would bring them out, I would have to like look over to make sure I could go up there just to get some for me and my wife. So this guy must've been like 20 or 30 days, he'd fucking eat the whole time he was up there, he child those goddamn things and it, uh, I dunno, it Kinda put me in a mood like I was calling, this is what Hong Kong is going to be like, a bunch of selfish people eating all the fucking dumplings. But then I had to quickly be like, wait a minute, wait a minute. There's selfish assholes from where I'm from and I'm one of them. So maybe I'm going to the promise land, a travel review, Hong Kong by Bill Burr, a bunch of selfish people eating dumplings.

Speaker 3:          01:00:02       Fuck, this is based on one guy who was going to Hong Kong who I don't even know if he was going there. I forget if he lived there or if he was even Chinese. Um, so anyways, how do you watch this shit all day? MSNBC or you? You seem like a news junkie. I'm kind of a news junkie. I don't watch it intently, but I, I like keep an on as wallpaper and periodically glance over and see like, oh, shit's hit the fan. Holy Crap. It's been two hours since shit's hit the fan. It's kind of more enjoyable with like the sound down. I'm loving this guy on the right. He has the exact same haircut. Is a Prince Charles sticks out the exact same way? Yeah, it does. Except he's got more hair on top if that's his hair. But what I like is that he's completely covered in the graphic that the stock market is tanked today.

Speaker 3:          01:00:50       Uh, they, they do that to people. Like if I, I have to be on CNN, uh, and what next week. Okay. And it's my first time. Oh, nice. So I'm going to be in one of those squares and I just hope the stock market hasn't completely gone to shit and I get blamed for it because that's what you'll remember is this guy caused your stocks. I don't even know that that was about the stock market. I just look at that guy going, that guy's fucking is made. That's the haircut of you, that there's people right now that have lost their pension because the stock market's down in, they're looking at this guy like it's only down 300 285 bucks though, right? Yeah. Yeah. I mean that's not what that is that through an $89? Yeah, it was like down 500 or something before, I dunno. 500 bucks.

Speaker 3:          01:01:30       What is 500 banks? I don't, I don't. I do. And it's the worst. You can't get out of it. Usually pay attention to it. Do you file? I don't. I just look at it like I'll never get that money back in whatever's left when I'm 65 of you. Oh Shit. I just view it. It's, it's like Las Vegas without all the really gaudy like decorating and, and buffet food. It's just like Las Vegas. I've done like, I've done okay in it, but I also, I invest conservatively and with conspiracy theories. So for the blue chip, I go for like tangible shit, like people who make tangible shit. And I'm of, I invested in all these companies that were like digging for gold and stuff and then, cause I felt the dollar's going to collapse. But then it dawned on me one day, it's just like, well wait, at the end of this, I don't have any gold. So I bought them a bunch of shovels and pickaxes to give to children somewhere to dig us out of the ground. And in the end, oh, you know what I was talking to? Who the fuck was I talking to me?

Speaker 2:          01:02:28       A friend in Chicago that is literally made millions of fucking dollars. This is really sick. All right, but I want you to listen to this. This is really emblematic of what's going on today. Is this place haunted or is that somebody hammering? No, that's somebody have, okay, just making sure destruction zone right now. But this guy, uh, would wait for a mass shooting and as soon as that happened, he would invest in gunstocks. And sure enough, gunstocks would go up, spike 25 points on the day. Like he come in there and go 100000 bucks and just buy whatever gun stock after a mass shooting within three days, he would sell it all before it went back down. And he's made millions just doing that now. Right. It's kind of creepy, but it is. This is where we're at. Right,

Speaker 3:          01:03:18       right. But I'm trying, I wouldn't try to make it that way. Now. What way can we do it? What? Let's think of another disaster that happens where we can make some money every time there's a slide. Do you invest in what? Well, I don't know about it.

Speaker 2:          01:03:30       Dryer, so I'm just investing in part futures, man. Now that Canada's going legal, I'm all in. I'm actually going to join the stock market and uh, uh, I think a solar and wind and all these other like new tech things are kind of a scam. But I'm, I'm all into the pot market because we saw what like alcohol didn't the 20s after the end of prohibition and uh, all the mega, mega giant corporations that came out of that, like Anheuser Busch and all this, and I think pot's going to be the same thing. It's not going to be a bunch of mom pops in Marin county. It's going to be like huge. Well, do we have a watch science?

Speaker 3:          01:04:08       Yeah. I mean, have you watched sewn on that? Uh, was it vice set the name of the channel where they did like putting it into food? I mean it's becoming like this before may thing overnight. Yeah. I Cook, I cook part food. Dude. You think that'll ever happen for like heroin? Like today we're making some opiate English muffins. Why don't you take like two bites in

Speaker 2:          01:04:31       their urine test? Because they a poppy seed muffins or so they claim, Oh, give me a fucking break. That's what they claim. But I'm just saying, so there is opiate food's already but

Speaker 3:          01:04:42       poppy seed muffins after they shot some heroin, that's why they fucking failed a test. Let's say when people talk about, I used to joke about that when people like say like, oh, it's, you know, I'm not, it's my metabolism. That's why that's, that's the big scapegoat. I had metabolism, it's really slow. It's like, yeah, that and fucking 6,000 calories a day that will make you artist shape. Um, so anyways, uh, all right, well let's, I think we're about to, this is the most effortless fucking 58 minutes of my life. Um, I'm so psyched they get made another album. I've heard the one track twilight zone thing.

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       I just video out, I saw the video. I love that. And, and the new video comes out on March 9th, two, not one of these like a concocted by the label lyric videos, which we have no part of. And I, and I guess they're pretty good and kids like him and all that, but we, we don't put in any really input into that. That's the label. Just wanting you to get to know the lyrics and things in the most basic way because people have the attention span of a fucking bathroom, that, and this and that. Right. This next one is, is a, we filmed it all on the same day, this twilight zone video and then victims of a clown. So I haven't seen it yet. I should be able to see in terms of a clown. Yeah, I should be able to see it tonight. Actually. We get some rushers on it and I hope it's as good as twilight zone because that one's pretty funny video man.

Speaker 2:          01:06:05       I'm out there hanging with a, um, a gray wolf, this, uh, Indian American guy and Matt [inaudible] aim American Indian movement and a pretty high level AME guide to, and we're out there at campfire just blown harps and uh, drinking Iowasca t and uh, it was, it was great.

Okay. Well Dude, you're one of my favorite people. I always love talking to you and uh, it's an honor that you wanted to come onto my podcast to promote your album.
