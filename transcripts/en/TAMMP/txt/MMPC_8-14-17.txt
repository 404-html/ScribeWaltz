Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday, August 14th, 2017. What's going on? How, why?

Speaker 3:          00:00:11       Yeah. How's it going? Oh my God. Paul [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:00:17       fucking destroyed last night on his standup special and Tarrytown, New York.

Speaker 3:          00:00:23       And uh, I want to thank everybody that came out for the, uh, for the two shows that we had there. And uh, we just, I dunno, it just went as good as it could have gone, I felt and uh, I was really proud of him. You know that first one's always, yeah, you got to figure it out.

Speaker 2:          00:00:41       How'd it go up there and try and be relaxed as you're like, Holy Shit, I'm shooting a special look at those TV cameras. Look at the chip camera swinging by my damn face. You know, you got to block all of that. No, that the crowd's going to be looking at that shit. You know, you learn that they have to turn off the fucking air conditioning because most of those old venues, the AC so frigging loud, it messes with the audio. So you're then going to go out there under hot lights with HD makeup on with no AC and progressively through your set, it's going to get hotter. So he learned all of that and you know something. God dammit, he saw the fire any fucking walked through it. And um,

Speaker 1:          00:01:24       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:01:24       He just, uh, I dunno, it just couldn't have gone any better. And uh, there you go. So we're going to edit that thing down and hopefully sell it to one of the goddamn networks. That's the guy, that's the goal. So congratulations to Paul Versey. Uh, that's it. And put them to bed. I told him that before he went out. That was just like, dude, just look at it this way. Okay, you're putting all these jokes to bed. This is it.

Speaker 2:          00:01:54       Okay. Go out there and give them the sendoff day deserve because the second you're special comes out, everyone's seen that material, then you can't do it again. And everybody will be like, dude, you already did that. You did that on your last fucking special.

Speaker 3:          00:02:08       No, your last special called chuckles. Like, what the fuck is wrong with my goddamn computer?

Speaker 1:          00:02:14       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:02:15       I'd been having all my God, I even having like the worse technology experiences. What is going on? Why is the screen just all black? Then I got, then I go to touch it and it does that, what does that make it a hit escape. Can I hit escape? Why don't they have an escape button for your life?

Speaker 2:          00:02:36       Um, oh, it worked. It worked to, Oh, the old escape button.

Speaker 1:          00:02:42       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:02:43       You know, there's somebody could turn that into a little lead, like in a mood, like turning into a movie. A big time Hollywood movie.

Speaker 3:          00:02:49       Yeah. The, the escape button movie. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:02:52       Go in there and you can pitch it. Hey, you know that escape button on your keyboard or you on your laptop? And they'd be like, Yup, Yup. Uh Huh. Uh, just

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       to [inaudible] guy. He fucking the, he pushes it, you know.

Speaker 1:          00:03:05       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:03:05       And uh, he disappears and all of a sudden his wife was like, wait a minute, I thought I told you cold and start where? Where'd he go? And then whenever he fucking comes to, he's always a,

Speaker 1:          00:03:18       okay,

Speaker 2:          00:03:19       let's flush this. Let's flush out this fucking off a movie. He was always in some someplace better at first.

Speaker 1:          00:03:25       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:03:25       But then there's, you know, he goes to a baseball game, he's like, this is amazing. And then he, you know, no one believes that it's true except for his dump fat best friend.

Speaker 1:          00:03:33       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:03:33       You know, they hit escape again, then they're at a steak house, you know, and they just keep hitting escape that eventually they, uh, they're some fucking, I don't know where the hell did they go? They had escaped and they end up in fucking Syria and North Korea. That's where you get a note from the industry. Can it not be North Korea? Could it be, could it be like Canada? Like Winnipeg? What if they went to Winnipeg? That's funny. Right? I just feel like with today's political climate to say North Korea, I just think that, you know, then they're starving and we like the fat friend fat is funny. Fat As nonthreatening.

Speaker 1:          00:04:11       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:04:12       Um, I don't know. You guys can finish the rest of the fucking movie. Uh, anyways. Um, so I was very proud of Paul and all that type of stuff and uh, going to try to keep the podcast light, uh, despite the, despite all that fucking just horrible shit.

Speaker 1:          00:04:28       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:04:29       That happened down in Charlottesville. It's just fucking four. I don't think I don't want to go. I know. I did hear one fucking funny thing about it. I mentioned, I'm going to say who I mentioned it to. I mentioned it to somebody else or go Jesus Christ to, can you fucking believe that shit down there in Charlottesville? They, he goes, he goes, no, what happened?

Speaker 2:          00:04:53       I mean, I don't know. I don't know if that is like,

Speaker 3:          00:04:57       I don't, I don't know how you missed it, but I mean there literally is that much information coming out at you that you could miss all that shit that went down there. And uh, I mean, I don't even need to comment on what the fuck went on down there. If you're any sort of a human being, uh, you know that dude in that fucking car, I swear to God, like I'm trying to think of a proper punishment for that guy. And I, I can't think nothing is like enough.

Speaker 1:          00:05:24       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:05:25       To fucking drive. Just do that. You know, you know what's funny about that guy as I bet that guy, he's talked about Isis and how cowardly terrorism is and then he gets in a car and does what the fuck he did. It's just like, it's like, I dunno. Hey, there must have been, I mean, obviously beyond joining that fucking group, there's something wrong with that guy mentally. Um, anyways. Um, see that's why I didn't want to bring it up. Where do you go from there and then fucking Trump, I'm done with that guy. The guy's just no longer funny or anything ease. Uh, I've just done with that fucking guy.

Speaker 1:          00:06:04       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:06:04       The fact that he wouldn't just straight up denounce it. The fact that he's going to go, oh, you know, there's hatred on both sides. Hey, turn on both sides and he's doing like that. You know what came first? The chicken or the egg got slavery. Slavery came first. You fucking dope. It's, it's documented. It's just so fun. Like he's been catering to that racist fan base cause he needed their votes. I'm not saying everybody voted for Trump is racist, but like for that fucking guy to do that, it's absolutely fucking reprehensible. It's sickening. Fucking sickening. Okay. And I'm not a fucking,

Speaker 4:          00:06:41       you know,

Speaker 3:          00:06:42       I'm not one of these guys that thought the sky was falling because this guy got in the office, you know, everybody freaking the fuck out like what the fuck was going to happen. But I will just say his track record on the Klan, you know, to be just not even commenting on it and being, do you know, if I was doing standup and people in the Klan started showing up, I would be looking at what the fuck am I saying that's making these people be like, oh yeah, this guy, he approves of what we do.

Speaker 1:          00:07:16       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:07:16       At the very least I'd be like, Hey, not for nothing. You guys over there with the Hudson, I fucking, you know, I'm not down with you guys like fucking kids. So you're morons. You fucking morons. He never does it. Never does it.

Speaker 4:          00:07:30       You know?

Speaker 3:          00:07:32       And I think he was just trying to make a joke with the cops, but the don't push the heads up, but just a while, the shit that you've seen that, that all that police brutality that's been going out to make that fucking joke, the guy, it's unbelievable. And now I'm hearing like, this is what, see, I'm not even a name fucking names, but like all these Fito, it's like fucking Taylor swift that was gonna run for Senate people. We can't go down this fucking road. The very least. Can we at least stick with career fucking politicians? Can we at least do that? Can we, you know, which would you want? Like you want me to be your fucking accountant? You want to comedian to be an accountant? Why would you want an actor or a musician? Fucking God knows what else. I, I just, I don't know. I don't even know what the fuck we're doing now. I just, I don't even know what the fuck we're doing. So, um, anyways, that happened. And uh, you know, fortunately it wasn't a big rally.

Speaker 4:          00:08:33       You know,

Speaker 3:          00:08:34       they're Nazis is still a little, a little mom. And Pop fucking group, which, you know, that's about the only good thing that I took away from it. But, uh, I dunno, you know what's fucked up about the whole thing though, as I said, I wasn't going to talk about it.

Speaker 1:          00:08:50       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:08:51       Is when people started texting me like, dude, you watch in this shit. So I go online, you know, to watch a video of the rally and all the bullshit to see what's going on. And I go on and when I click on it, I immediately see Bobby flay and he's selling me something from Lipton ice tea. So what's so fucked up is, uh, and I think it was actually, I was actually on the Huffington post and I fucking hate those guys.

Speaker 1:          00:09:23       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:09:23       You know, and they're all liberal is how can you fucking believe it's a blog? It's like, dude, you're making money off of it. You're making money off of it. So there's something you would think on just something like this is so reprehensible. We shouldn't even put a fucking ad in front of it. Other than that, I understand you've got to make you money. I have advertising on my fucking podcast, but there was just something fucked up, like this is the most horrible, blah, blah, blah, whatever the fuck they have as a headline. And then you click it on and it's fucking Bobby flay set selling me fucking ice tea.

Speaker 5:          00:09:52       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:09:52       But you know, and that's how the game's played, I guess. Anyway, so let's get the fuck out of that. All right, Boo Nazis, uh, boot Donald Trump being a fucking pussy. That guy such a fuck. I'm so sick of him and that fucking guy from North Korea acting like the tough guys acting like the tough, you know what I mean? You know what they shouldn't. You know they should, they should fight the fucking undercard on a McGregor Mayweather. All right, why don't you guys settle your fucking beef? I'd love to see the two of them put on fucking

Speaker 1:          00:10:23       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:10:24       The whole fucking get up the box, insurance, the mouth guard, the gloves, the boots, and go out there and you just really see what a couple of pants he's, you know, that Fatty Donald Trump with his fucking wig flopping around it probably one of the fun. It'd be funnier than all the standup specials that came out this year combined. It would have been tremendous. Like that's, that's the way I think that that's the way they should solve world problems. Although, you know what's his face is like a black belt in judo, Vladimir Putin at fucking, that dude looks like a bad guy. And like, you know, little spy movies right now I'm in over my head. Why do I try to talk politics? Because that's what everybody's fucking talking about and asking me about I guess. But how about those red sox take it to on a tree from the New York Yankees. He had 100 bucks on each game. You know, I get 50 with version 50 with my agent, right? They're both Yankee fans. So, uh, you know, we fucking blew that, that, that first one bell, middle reliever. I don't know what happened to him. By the way, did you see that guy in the mets made, he swung his leg around, made that weird pitching motion and he fucking slammed his balls between his thighs. And then after that is fucking pitching hand went numb. Figure that one out. Figure that one out.

Speaker 1:          00:11:41       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:11:41       Why the fuck are guys wired like that? Why if he get, he could, how the design fall of men that you could throw an object in somehow, basically kick yourself in the, and then you're throwing hand goes numb.

Speaker 1:          00:11:56       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:11:57       It's unreal. You know what it is? The men are like the death star, right? We got that one little shaft. All you do is you just fucking throw something down and then the whole fucking thing blows up and that would be on nuts, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:12:10       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:12:11       I don't know what the women want is women. You just tell me look older and then that's it. The whole fucking plant, it explodes. Uh, Shit. Um, anyways, I've been in it, so I remember what was going to talk about and I've been having like the worst technology fucking weekend here. Um, I'm about to buy my, uh, my second cell phone charger of the weekend. I brought one, I left it at the theater and then the next day I woke up and I bought one. I bought one. And uh,

Speaker 1:          00:12:51       yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:12:51       drove from fucking, well, there was a red bank, New Jersey up to Tarrytown, New York. And then I don't know what happened. I don't know where the why or when, but I fucking lost that one, so I got to go. Bye. Fuck another one. It's just my phone. My fucking computer just keeps cutting out, I guess now that I hit the escape button, I'm fine. I don't know. I'm, I'm uh, I'm just not meant to live in this fucking era of all of this shit. I need to go back to when there was just like rotary phones, which was impossible to lose because you wouldn't take it with you. It was just in your house. The only way you lost it as it fills it in fucking sink hole your house and you lost all your house. So there was a fire in your house, you know, or somebody came to Maria with the black gloves and they would fucking cut the phone wire. Then you lost your phone and you lost your life. But you say you didn't care. Right. Was this sent, wait, I'm trying to say was it was a simpler time. Um, I gotta tell you, dude, I'm fucking sold on the Jersey shore by the way. All these years, all these years of Paul Versey great. Paul Versey fucking crushed his special last night. It's been shitting on New Jersey.

Speaker 3:          00:14:06       I fucking five. Finally, the same way goes like to Yara. I know what your deal is with this fucking state.

Speaker 3:          00:14:12       I don't know why you think, you know there's more animals that live here. The New York, there are, I'll give him that. It's a little dirty or animal in New Jersey, but there weren't there the under dogs. So I was going around Terry town and I was just taking pictures of people, all the fucking animals that are up here. What it is about this part of this neck of the woods, like fucking West Chester. Um, is it so fucking beautiful up here? It could cleans up the animal. You don't see it, but if you really do, if you fucking block out the trees and the beautiful houses and buildings behind these people and you really look at them, you know it's a bunch of animal. I want it to Terry town and there was bunch of people like had all the, all the new rage now be seen like those does their motorcycles but they're really small. We call a mini bikes but they look like it's like somebody took a Ninja and they just made it smaller. Like this whole group of them.

Speaker 4:          00:15:04       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:15:04       Was riding through like a motorcycle gang? I don't if they were marketing motorcycle gangs, I have no idea. I don't know if they were more likely to beat the shit out of you because they're insecure about the size of their motorcycles. I don't, I don't get how it fucking works, but there was like 40 of them we'd, I'll ride through town and I was laughing my ass off going, here I am. Here I am in fucking, you know, if I'm not in West Chester, I'm Oberson West Justice.

Speaker 3:          00:15:29       Look at these fucking animals and I already learned up here. There's already is, there's always this snooty thing in all the fucking real estate, you know, are you above the boulevard or you're below the boulevard? Are you in the flat lands? Are you in the hills? Are you on this side of the tracks or that side of the tracks? This side of the river, other side of the bridge up here, I already found out that there was, there's this snooty, if you live on the other side of the Tappan Zee bridge or the Tappan Zee Bridge is there's my fucking Google Map lady was saying when I was driving up there making right to go onto exit one c four a Tapan zee bridge.

Speaker 4:          00:16:11       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:16:13       you're less than you live on the other side of the river. Stuff is cheaper over there. It's more expensive to live here. Therefore you are less than me. You are less than God likes you less. God loves everyone, but he loves you less because you live on the other side of the fucking river. Actually cornered this woman last night who was in real estate, right? She's up at the Bar, right? And I'm going up there to go get a couple of rounds of drinks or whatever people, you know, cause I'm a hell of a guy.

Speaker 4:          00:16:43       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:16:44       And she's like, Hey, you know, first he special yet. And I said, it's great. You know, I do the tip accomplishing. What are you doing? She goes, I'm in real estate. I said, wonderful. I got some questions for you. And I fucking grilled her up up. Uh, uh, uh, went law and order on her.

Speaker 4:          00:16:59       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:17:00       And I fucking was breaking it down to find out what's the deal with all of these luxury apartment buildings? They're going up like fucking like luxury apartment buildings. That's how many luxury apartment buildings they're building in New York and Los Angeles. The only reference is what they are. And I'm like, what is the, what's the deal with these fucking luxury apartments? Who is building them? Why are they building them? What kind of a fucking moron pays rent in a luxury apartment when they could actually just go buy something and live in it. That was less than the luxury apartment, but at least they would own that. Who makes that dumb decision? First of all, who's paying for these? And she said, it's a lot of foreign money. Uh, China, Russia and Middle East money, right. Then I go, all right, and then who the fuck's in them? And she said, she basically said, I got, when I said, who's dumb enough to throw money in the toilet like that?

Speaker 3:          00:17:57       She said, about 15% of the population. I go, all right, so you're banking on, I got, how do you put your head on the pillow every night? She goes, this isn't my passion. I go, but you are selling them. How do you do that? How do you fucking go? All right, come on the lower 15% dummies, please walk into my office today. Long story short, I go, when does it burst? When she goes, well, you know the, you know of people seem to be, they keep building them, they keep filling it. When does it burst? Well, you know, but, but when does it burst? She goes two years dead serious. She goes, two years, two years. It's going to be fucking overseas. What you do? I go, you sit on your fucking money. All right. If you need to buy something now, because the fucking, this is me. I'm like that fucking ball guy who screams about taxes. I mean, uh, the stocks, I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. Both from a little fucking conversation that I had about three 30 in the morning as we were closing down this fucking bar. Um, celebrate and Paul Versey crushing his special.

Speaker 1:          00:18:59       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:19:00       Uh, I, I'm telling you right now, just sit on your fucking money. Like, oh, I don't know. What the fuck did I say initially? I guess I said, yeah, if you, if, if you're getting killed in taxes and you got to buy something, no, just don't rent a function, a fucking luxury apartment. It's got to be the dumbest fucking thing you could ever do. Look at the luxury of this all. Look at all those luxury than I'm paying for that. I don't fucking out just hanging in there in two years, you'd be able to buy the fucking building. Of course you won't cause it will still cost millions of dollars. But you know what I'm saying? Don't be a fucking SAP. Alright. All those buildings that do doing is killing everybody's fucking view. You know, they're all going to be fucking empty within two years down. I'm calling it right. They're all going to be, people are gonna be jumping out of those fucking tags and two years we're taking college.

Speaker 1:          00:19:53       MMM.

Speaker 3:          00:19:56       I don't know. I don't fucking know. All I know is I haven't been home. And too many days I miss my daughter, my wife and I can't wait to get back. And um, and that's it. I got a nice 10 days off, but I had the best fucking time down on the Jersey shore. The fucking food was amazing. I went down to this place, juniors, I don't even know where I was at. All right? Like I was pretty cool. I had a different opener every night versus he opened the first night, fucking killed it. I went to bed like a God damn angel, like a fucking angel. All right. I'm already white as a fucking angel, you know, at least to ghost went right home, went to sleep, woke up the next day, worked out, fucking crushed it. Right next day I had fucking Bret Ernst came up who absolutely fucking murdered, who you have to go see.

Speaker 3:          00:20:43       Uh, I hadn't seen him in years. It's weird how we seam the comedy store, but he that just went up or I'm going up or what? I'm going up and he's going up in the other room. I just hadn't seen him in a few years. That dude grown by leaps and bounds. Absolute fucking monster destroyed. He had me pacing a little bit before I was going up or not, fuck Brett's killing breads, Kellen Shit, what am I opening with? Right. And then later on that night he took me down to wherever the fuck he was took went down and this place juniors someplace on the Jersey shore and we got a tomato pie, which I had never heard of, which is basically, it's like a South Jersey Philly thing where according to them they put the cheese on first. Then the tomato sauce, but the one that I had looked more like a swirl of looked like tomato, cheese, tomato, cheese, like a big fucking circular thing.

Speaker 3:          00:21:30       Like when you fucking through computers, refreshing that. A little pinwheel thing. That's what it looked like. Fucking I might've been, might've been one of the top five pizza slices of pizzas of it had in a while. Okay. And I'm going to tell you why, because I live in Los Angeles and all the pizza out there sucks. Even the stuff that they say is good, you know, it all fucking sucks. Every fucking last place in la absolutely fucking sucks. I don't know why you just can't. Anything that involves doe sucks. The bread sucks. The pizza sucks, Bagel suck. All of that sucks. However, you know, other than that, they got a tremendous fuck. Pasta sucks. But you know, amazing steakhouses, Burgers, Thai food, Mexican food. That's what you do out in La. But you do not get pizza. You don't get bread. You don't do any of that shit.

Speaker 3:          00:22:23       Um, and I, and I was coming from that, eating that shit to go into this. It was fucking unbelievable. That in the fucking muscles, the bread with the fucking sauce. It was unbelievable. Like an asshole. I mean, this shit at like fucking two in the morning. Um, and then I kept going to this place, lcs in red bank to get a sandwich and just, I would pay for just the bread alone, by the way. I went with the Turkey with the cranberry sauce over there, fucking delicious. And I made the mistake of getting a large, by the way, which was the size of my fucking leg. So the next day I went back and I got the Italian, which was amazing, but I still like the Turkey a little bit better. So I was eating as my stomach growls here. I was been eating like a fucking king out here and um, I dunno, I, I kind of fell in love with the Jersey shore. Always wanting to see Asbury park. Went down there, check that out. Went into the uh,

Speaker 3:          00:23:21       I dunno all those play every place down. There's like Bruce Springsteen or Jon Bon Jovi played here. I know the place is not called the fucking stone pony. That's a fucking bar I used to drink and in the fucking village that is no longer there. That was my fucking spot name. He used to drink in there back when I had my drinking under control. Then I was hanging out with all the comics that hung out with back then. Didn't drink and uh, we'd go in there. We used to play fucking video games and shoot pool and just give each other shit like we always did for like four or five till four or five in the fucking morning. Um, whatever that fucking pony places called. I know it's sac religious. Tell you jerk. I got to look. You know why I'll get the name of it right now.

Speaker 3:          00:24:02       Cause I bought my daughter a onesy from that place, which I think she'll only be able to wear for one week because it looks at the side, it looks like it's the, uh, the size that she is now. What's it cost? My wife had to say, oh, what is this stone pony? I'll wait. The stone crow is the bar I used to hang out at. All right. So I was saying it right. I sent the picture of the ones he didn't, my wife and she knew that it goes like, what size is that? Cause she's currently wearing, you know, this month to this month. It's just like, can't Jesus, can you just, you know, can I do one fucking thing right over? He just fucking one thing. Can I do that? Um, so last night I hung out until four in the morning, but I only had a couple of fucking drinks cause I kind of realized,

Speaker 4:          00:24:47       MMM,

Speaker 3:          00:24:49       I'm not an ally. I'm not going to undiagnosed an undiagnosed string of alcoholics. You know, where, uh, I'm the classic alcoholic where I can't just have one, like I'm doing it, I'm fucking doing it. That's it. All right. But the next day I could just be like, all right, but now, you know, now I'm not drinking and I walk around like, I need it, man. I fucking need it. I don't wake up like missing a tooth and all of that fucking shit. Like,

Speaker 4:          00:25:14       um, but uh,

Speaker 3:          00:25:18       you know, I have way too many that night when I went down to juniors and had that great food and everything. And I also noticed too, I was throwing them back like, like fucking water

Speaker 4:          00:25:29       and, uh,

Speaker 3:          00:25:31       and it's just not a good thing. I'm just sick of being fucking hung over. So,

Speaker 4:          00:25:35       you know, last night I only had a couple, um, I'm kind of, I think I'm done. I'm just done with it. I like waking up, not fucking hung over. I like getting up, going to the fucking gym. I like doing that shit. And uh, yeah, I'm not saying I'm done for fucking good, but I'm just kinda just, yeah, I'm done. I had a hell of a run.

Speaker 3:          00:26:02       All right. Started at fucking 17. Drank until about, I dunno, 22. And then it went like a 10 year period where I didn't drink. I barely drank.

Speaker 4:          00:26:14       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:26:14       Barely fucking drank. And then, uh, then a guy named Joe to Rosa came down.

Speaker 4:          00:26:21       It's my life.

Speaker 3:          00:26:24       It's not fair for me to put it on him. All right. But what does it say? We were not good for each other and uh, that was probably 2004. So I'm talking like a nice, I been on like a 13 year sort of a, although I took a year off one time from 2010, 2011 a year. I went a year and two days without drinking. I've gone a couple of stretches of 75 days, 50 some days here or there or whatever. But uh,

Speaker 4:          00:26:54       mmm.

Speaker 3:          00:26:55       Yeah. I mean, I'm always, you know, if you get a nice cold bottle of fucking wine, this is a good meal. Maybe I'll have a glass, but I just don't feel like, but then it's like, I'm going, I'm going to finish the fucking bottle.

Speaker 1:          00:27:05       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:27:06       I mean, what are we doing here? Right. Uh, so I don't know. I don't feel like I'm mature enough at this point in my life to, uh, handle shit like that. And I'm at the point to where it, I don't think I even enjoy it anymore. So, uh, for the 90th time on this fucking podcast, I'm going to try to stop drinking. So I was a social drinker. I think I want to go to Aa just cause I like crowds, you know, just go up there and just fucking make them laugh and shit.

Speaker 4:          00:27:34       MMM.

Speaker 3:          00:27:35       Anyways, what am I talking about here? How many minutes in it? We're 27 minutes in here and I get to vacate this fucking hotel room. I'm staying at this stupid ass fucking yeah. Fancy fucking wanted to share it in, right? People are just going to stay at the fucking Sheridan, these kinds, I swear to God, you order the Internet at 1201 it goes off and you've got to buy it again.

Speaker 3:          00:28:00       Oh wait, maybe it's free. All I had was an access code. I, you know, I take that back. They're not fucking cool. All right, let's, let's, let's read a little bit of a, let's read a little bit of, um, uh, Eric. Oh, by the way, then the other thing too, you know what I don't like about Trump supporters is when they compartmentalize that racist shit when they go like, you know, hey, I, that stuff where he doesn't condone, you know, he doesn't know,

Speaker 2:          00:28:24       uh, chastise the Klansmen that not neo Nazi said like him. I don't like that. I don't like that part, but I'll tell ya, I think the way he's handling it had been Hilary. You know? Well, why can't fucking stand either, but at some point, you know what I mean? It's like if you had a friend, right? He's a good friend of yours, but he was also in the clan.

Speaker 4:          00:28:51       Yeah.

You know, what I watched the other day did I really enjoyed was I watched this whole thing on John Daly. That guy has to be one of the most honest human beings,

Speaker 2:          00:32:37       one of the most honest human beings ever.

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       You know, it's kind of hard watching the guy, what he does to himself. But like

Speaker 3:          00:32:47       I swear to God, like when we're in scar face, when that guy goes, I like you Tony. There is no lying and you, you know fizzling lying and everybody. But John Daly, I think he kicked Gif, they should recast, they should fucking green screened him in there. You know, can somebody Photoshop that in? Somebody just says, I like you John Daly. There's no lying in you. They just be like, you know how much should the Heidi, you're drinking when you're drinking a day. Cause I drink like a case of beer some days up to maybe 35 40 and they go 35 40 he's like, oh yeah. And then they go, then one he goes, I know I probably switched to whiskey and then he just started laughing. Like, just be like, I know it's fucked up. Talked about how he played his best golf when he was a little drunk. He was, you know the balls, you know, you just hit the ball better, you know, you're looser, the body relaxes. And uh, I really wish I watched golf more when he was playing, cause he didn't take all that fucking time. When he went up to address the ball, he just went up and he just fucking hit the thing. Crushed it like seriously. Watching that guy swing is one of the most

Speaker 3:          00:33:59       incredible things I've ever seen in my life. I actually saw some fucking idiot did that thing where he put the tea in his mouth with the ball. He let John Daly do a John Daly Swain and we daily didn't fuck up. Thank God. But I gotta tell you something. If you ever took that to this day, he would've killed him. He literally would have killed that guy. He would have gone to jail. You know what? That guy from the fucking New Jersey Nets, right? Shut that limo driver I need. You would be in that role. They have a row of cells of uh, athletes who accidentally killed somebody. He would have been right there. You know, what did you do? I shot my limo drive. What'd you do? And you know, I tried to hit a golf ball out of this guy's mouth and I, I missed an eye kitty's head. How far do you think John Daly could have hit a human head that was still attached to a body? So he has to rip it off the body. I could say you get hit at least 17 feet. That's the level of Torque and power in that man swing to check out John a videos if you get a chance at work. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:35:03       I, it's crazy. It's so fucking like it's an overly used expression, but refreshing when you watched the guy, he's not trying to hide anything. It's just like, I know that's why he's still, yeah, one time it was a rain delay and uh, you know, just went in there and made these two golfers and yeah, we just got hammered, just got absolutely hammered. And then the next day we came out in the same clothes hung over and we actually will play. Great. All right. More advertising upside. There is upside down. Boy,

Speaker 3:          00:39:47       Do I reopen the door, expose my kid to the bad guy or do I just sit here while my arms slowly just fucking dies? And then, then I'll die in here. You know? See, this is why I don't write movie scripts because that would fucking happen. And every like, oh my God, it was terrible. Then she fucking died and the kids saw it and then he couldn't figure out the code and then everybody died. Right. It was a double feature. After that we showed the local news, um, white people, this is, Oh God, we're going to get into the ration. Are we really going to get into the ratio here? Okay. White people. Oh, Billy ambassador. I'm unsure. I'm sure you address the current events at the top of the Po, this podcast. I skipped over most of it. As you may have heard. I just thought of trashed Trump for not having the fucking humanity to trash, you know, some of the dumbest people on the planet, you know, and actually blaming the people that they attack also.

Speaker 3:          00:40:46       I just don't fucking get it. He goes, I'm pretty moderate and have the same Ron Paul ideas about government is, you seem to have a, sorry about the generations trying to keep a tight yet. Dude, I don't even know what the fuck I believe anymore. He said, I watched my Facebook feed all day. Denounce White people. All right. First of all, why would you go on a Facebook feed? Are you trying to depress yourself? Are you trying to make yourself upset? Why would you go on there? What did you do next? Did you go on Twitter and look up Hashtag white people so you could infuriate yourself more and get an even more, um, like delusional view of what the population is like?

Speaker 5:          00:41:24       You know, I dunno.

Speaker 3:          00:41:28       I mean, if you watched all that shit about the Klansmen, you'd think that every white person was in the Klan. I mean, it's just, I dunno. Anyways, plowing ahead here. Uh, he says, uh, I look white, but I'm first generation American with my parents coming from Italy. Okay. Yeah. You're, you're telling you, okay. I get it. All right. My policy on making general statements about entire races is I don't, and stereotypes.

Speaker 3:          00:41:55       Sure. Why people love things like jarred jam's budding criticism. I never say white people or black people because if history has taught us anything, it's the dumbest thing you period. I think you meant to say the dumbest thing you can do. He goes, I'm tired of it all day white people. There's white people that I voted for Barack the first time I ate Nazis. And it's fucking pathetic that I have to say that out loud. I think Trump is a con. I hated Hillary. I don't wish for the south to rise again. I'm not offended as a white person. I'm just tired of the laziness of an am I way off here. Uh, look, I know what you're saying, but dude, it's like, is this the worst thing you have to deal with? You got to expect people in a highly emotional state. All right? Such as this. You know, when you're in a highly emotional state, you, you're going to say stuff in a way that you wouldn't if you were a little more relaxed. And then secondly, if you're going to fucking go on a Facebook feed and get upset, I don't have any sympathy for you. Like, it's, you know, it's, it's, it's a Facebook feed.

Speaker 3:          00:43:14       There's no, the qualifications to comment on Facebook is you have to be smart enough to sign up for Facebook. That's it. So that's what g it's not a think tank. It's not a ted talk, which even those things, I'm starting to think of just a fucking bunch of snake oil salesmen. Everybody acting like some fucking amazing is happening, you know, cause somebody is up there with a laser pointer talking about the future. Um, yeah, I mean, all right. I understand what you're saying. Like I'm not, I'm not going to lie to you. There are times where I'll see like these people being applauded for shit that they're saying. And when I'm listening to what I'm saying, it's like if you took out white people there and then you inserted black people like that and that person was white, they would be in trouble. However, however you do have to take it with a grain of fucking salt because of the great fucking life that you have. All right. And, um,

Speaker 3:          00:44:07       I dunno, I, I think he should maybe try. I would try to listen more to what the overall point is, rather than wasting time being offended. You know, I'm a white guy, I'm a fucking, life is great, you know, I can pretty much go wherever the fuck I want to go. I go down to the mall, I buy a tee shirt, nobody fucks with me. Right. I'm not saying it's easy, but I mean, compared to what other people compared to what other people fucking out of, I guess this is the best, you know, this is the inside lane,

Speaker 4:          00:44:34       you know,

Speaker 3:          00:44:36       I could fucking look the other way, but there's definitely days I'll, I'll say this is definitely days that, you know, nonwhite people say some shit or like, you know, women will say stuff about men being like, that's so fucking overtly fucking sexist and not only not being called out on it, you're being applauded for it. Like you're brave. And what you're saying is just as fucking ignorant is what the fuck you're doing. However, at the end of it, I, you kinda gotta be like, well,

Speaker 4:          00:45:01       okay,

Speaker 3:          00:45:02       because of what's happening that's so fucking pissed. Like I give it a little bit, like, I just thought I'd give it a little bit depending on my mood. Um, I do that, but, um, all right. You don't, what the honest thing is, is if I'm sitting there and the person who isn't white says it, I'll get into a debate with them. All right. But if I'm with all white people and they're complaining about it, I'll tell him to shut the fuck up. I think I'm just a contrarian and all depends. Um, I don't fucking know, but all I do, all I know is after watching all that fucking horrible shit. Yeah. I just think, you know, there's, there's a certain level of empathy that, uh, he should try to tap into, try to put yourself in other people's positions a little bit more.

Speaker 4:          00:45:43       And um,

Speaker 3:          00:45:45       I dunno, I guess to try to compensate for the astounding level of fucking ignorance that's out there. I guess she got to try to make yourself an even better person or somehow, I don't know. I don't know what to tell you because I'll be honest with you is when our people go, Hey, I'm not in a fucking

Speaker 4:          00:46:03       mmm,

Speaker 3:          00:46:04       oh, not in the clan. I'm not a Nazi guy. I'm not, I don't belong a hate group, blah, blah, blah. And Bernard Shit, everybody has their fucking issues. And when you're a comedian, it's like you're running for office. It's like you run this campaign that never fucking stops and you're meeting people. Like, I was just in Red Bank, New Jersey, now I'm in Tarrytown, now I'm going to go to fucking La, you know, the end of the month I'm going to be in Boston, in New Hampshire, then I'm going to be in Mississippi and Alabama. Um, am I really promoting my upcoming dates, talking about racism. Look amazing. Next thing, I should have Bobby flay reading this. Um, but the point is as I'm going to meet all these fucking people and um, I dunno, I gotta be honest with you. Everywhere I go, no matter where I'm at, when I'm in a room and it's just all white guys of a certain age, my generation and older, you can literally take a fucking, I swear to God, like one of those sands of time timers and just go, okay, when is the n word common? I'm trying to remember. I'm trying to remember the last time that, you know, it doesn't happen every time, but I go in there and I literally started having anxiety going, Oh God, you know, I look around and what I'm doing is I'm judging too. And I'm like, when's it coming? Someone's going to fucking say it or someone's going to say something a little borderline. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:47:28       MMM.

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       And it's depressing. Like I was hanging,

Speaker 1:          00:47:33       yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:47:33       Uh, recently on a row gig and it was all white dudes in there and Mayweather accused. Mcgregor is saying something racist and Mcgregor's going, I, you know, I didn't fucking say anything racist, but blah, blah, blah, Blah and all this type of shit. Right. And then this random white guy is watching it. He goes, yeah, what's a big deal? He's like, this guy's an n word, net guy's Whitey. I mean, it's a fight. Who gives a fuck what you say? And I'm just, I'm just thinking in my head like, dude, they're not saying he said that like, like, but that is like, that's how his fucking brain process that information. And it's, it's, I dunno, it's, it's so fun. It's depressing cause you know what it is. Everybody thinks they're as smart and everybody thinks they have it figured out.

Speaker 3:          00:48:28       You know what I mean? Think about when is the last time you, I mean, sometimes your conscious gets to you, but does your brain really ever say like, uh, I mean, it takes a lot to fucking admit that you're wrong, regardless of color, sex or anything. They'd be like, you know what, I shouldn't have done that. I was wrong. I, you know, I now realize how fucking ignorant that takes a look into truly mean it. Not to just get on the good side of your wife against the, she'll bang here, right? To truly fucking sincerely mean it and then try to make a change. It takes a fucking lot. And, uh, for anybody. So I dunno. So I've gone through things like, you know, if somebody does says that, what do I do? Do I fucking confront them?

Speaker 1:          00:49:16       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:49:16       Do I get into the fucking debate? I've tried every fucking technique. Do I get up and walk out every fucking tactic? Nothing works. Not that fucking works. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:49:27       that is depressing.

Speaker 3:          00:49:29       So I try to avoid that social situation.

Speaker 2:          00:49:36       Maybe that's what I'll do in the future. Maybe that's what I'll do in the future. Uh, anyways, that was like a time over the f I don't remember what the fuck I was when I was in, I was in Durham, North Carolina, and that fucking guy goes, you know, Bill, I like you, you know, you're a good person. You know, you don't bill. He goes, I like meet good people. And I was like, Oh God, here it comes. I like meeting good people. He sees testing the waters, he sticking his toe and you know, Christian Good Christian people, white people, and then boom, the fucking Edward comes.

Speaker 3:          00:50:13       So that guy who headed off at the pass is that you don't buy a, I like being good people and I was just like, Oh yeah, do you, you know, I like meeting bad people who the fuck doesn't like making good people. And then he, then he shut up. Then you shut up. And then he got really mad at me,

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       you know, when I was talking about, you know, I dunno like the Middle East or something like that. And I was just going like, dude, they in another lane us. You know what I mean? They've got a couple of crazy fucking leaders and then everybody else is a bunch of you and me walking around, they're trying to get a sandwich, you know, you and I were trying to get the fucking, uh, the NBA package and they're trying to whatever fucking sport. But what sports are they into over there? Soccer. Right. Everybody's into the fucking soccer. Um, anyways, so, yeah, I dunno. I understand. You know, but, uh, I dunno. I, I don't, I don't, I don't have any fucking answers. I don't fucking know. All right. Younger girlfriend, not ready for marriage.

Speaker 1:          00:51:11       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:51:11       Okay. Hi Bill. I'm a big fan of yours and would like your advice. I'm a 35 year old guy.

Speaker 1:          00:51:17       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:51:17       From the Bronx dating a 20 year old Japanese girl in Japan. I love her a lot and want to marry her, but she tells me she's not ready for marriage and children yet and can't really say if or when she'll be ready. Yeah, it's cause she's 20

Speaker 1:          00:51:32       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:51:32       It was, I love her, but getting married and having children, it's very important to me. If I were younger I would say, okay, no problem. And just keep dating and see if anything changes. But at 35 I'm starting to feel pressure to get married sooner rather than later. That societal pressure. But I worry that I'm getting too old to be a father. Well, I just had one at 48, so, um, Alec Baldwin's fucking knocking them out in his 50s. He said, I'm okay right now, but in five or 10 years I feel I might not have enough energy to run around chasing little ones. And if she's still not ready in a few years, that would put me in a very difficult position. You just think it's smart, sir. I'm happier than I've ever been with her. And happiness can be so fleeting that I don't want to ruin it with what I have with her, but at the same time, I can't wait forever. What would I do? Um, I would, I would listen to a, I would listen to logic.

Speaker 1:          00:52:29       All right.

Speaker 2:          00:52:31       I, I really think, you know, most of the time, you know, if who's dragging their feet to the altar, it's usually the guy.

Speaker 2:          00:52:41       Okay, not the woman. Why would they? For the most part, generally speaking, they're marrying somebody that makes more money than them. So there's no fear financially. If you fucking, you know, they're not going to lose half the house. They're going to get the whole house and they're going to get a fucking check from you. That's basically what the fuck happens. You know, it's like the showcase showdown at the end of the price is right. And you're the guy that they go, hey, thanks for playing and you just walk off. And then everybody crowds around the person that one, that's usually the woman in marriage. Okay. And I don't hear any shit from women because all you guys do is bitch that you don't make as much money as men. So what I'm saying, cause if you're just going to say that's not the fucking case than what he had bitching about fucking equal pay for.

Speaker 2:          00:53:22       All right? Either you're making less a, you're not. All right. So for you to sit there have been saying, I love you. I want to spend my life with you and fucking have children with you and start a family and live happily ever after for her to say I'm not ready for that yet. And I can't really say if or when I will be ready. Yeah, Dude, she's 20 years old. She has no idea who the fuck she is. You're, you're, you're fucking 15 years down the road, you know who you are, you know what you want, and uh, I don't think she's going to figure that out with you. You know, you're taking their best years away from her when she should be out fucking seen, figuring out what the fuck she wants and you, and your best years of cause. Now you're ready. So you need to go out and meet a fucking mature woman. Who was it not mature. I'm not saying this woman's immature, she's not in, but she's fucking 20.

Speaker 5:          00:54:15       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:54:16       All right. This is what happens. This is what happens when you, when, when there's that level of an age difference at this age. Okay. Look, if you were 45 and she was 35, she'd be fucking, you know, pressure and you,

Speaker 5:          00:54:29       mmm,

Speaker 2:          00:54:32       I dunno dude. I would just hate for her to at 23 to be like, you know, uh, I don't, this isn't like what I want and now you're 38 you push in for, you don't want it. Then I think I would, uh, pull the rip cord now,

Speaker 5:          00:54:47       you know,

Speaker 3:          00:54:48       that's what I would do. I don't fucking know. I mean, it's hard for me to tell you to fucking break up with somebody over a paragraph of information on a podcast as I sit in a bed in the hotel room, isn't it? So take all of that with a grain of salt. All right. You know what I would do, sir? I would ask you. Good friends. Ask you good friends with the fuck they think because they know you. And like she'd have to have a nice long fucking distance phone call with you. I guess you're in Japan right now. I would do that. You know, maybe you get some friends into Japan. I don't fucking know. That's a big decision, but just from that little information. Yeah, I get out of it, you know? And I'm also saying don't do that cause I don't fucking know you. All right?

Speaker 5:          00:55:25       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:55:25       Jason's Christ bill. Could your waffle anymore than that one? All right. I dumped my girlfriend and now I regret it.

Speaker 5:          00:55:31       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:55:32       Is this the followup song too? I kissed a girl and I liked it. Um, hi bill. I started watching your podcast watching my podcast. I don't know how you're doing that. You mean listening to my iPod?

Speaker 3:          00:55:41       Kaz. Oh, this person is not from this country or it doesn't speak English. And he was, I'm going to read this right, is the same way this person wrote it. I started watching your podcasts since few months because the best Romanian standup comedians always said that they listened to yours in their podcasts. Get the fuck Outta here.

Speaker 2:          00:56:01       Romanian comics. Listen to this podcast. Shout out to Romania.

Speaker 5:          00:56:07       Huh?

Speaker 2:          00:56:08       Is that where all the Gypsies Come? The Richard Pryor's and George Carlin's of fucking pickpocket hers. I gotta tell you, man, they're fucking amazing. They're pains in the asses, but Jesus Christ can those fucking people pick your pocket you almost like and they leave. You can't find your passport. You almost fucking applaud him. I don't know where you are, but that was good. I had no idea. God bless you. Um, I dunno if they come from Romania, the Gypsies, Transylvania, that Gypsy stay. Move around. Now about the story, me and this girls, we had a complicated too. You've got a threesome. He couldn't broke up with two girls. I had a complicated story and I tried six months to be what they are until I finally succeeded. So after one year and a half, a very nice relationship, he was giving it to her, of course, with ups and downs before I leaved to Germany to study, I decided alone that will be better for her if we split up. So I dumped her and said to her that we should remain friends. My decision was because I got scared of her love. She would leave all of her dreams and stuff only did come with me and be with me. And T to hear that at 19 years old is scary. It's scary as shit. Uh, now after nine months when the moving out, euphoria has vanish, I now know that I made a big mistake and I realized

Speaker 2:          00:57:36       how cunt I was to her. I think you mean country, uh, in the past month. So she moved on, but we still kind of talk, but I cannot sleep anymore. I developed a little problem with drinking alone and trying not to feel something. A little advice would be nice. Thank you. And all good for you and your family. First of all, fuck can you did great with your English. I knew exactly what the fuck you were talking about. I could never do that.

Speaker 2:          00:58:21       on your way to finding the person you're going to, you're going to be with you fuck up. Like anything, any success story. You make mistakes and you learn from them along the way. All right? If you really love her, I mean this is what you could do. Call her up one time and just say, listen, I just want you to know that breaking up with you. What's the biggest mistake I've ever made? I've had a problem sleeping. I've been, I've developed, I've been drinking, trying to forget and just tell her why you did it. It just totally communicate with her and see what, see what she says. All right? And you know, if she doesn't take you back, you can live with that. Okay? The bottom line, dude, you fucking 19 years old, okay. Don't start drinking. Don't do, don't make the mistakes I made.

Speaker 2:          00:59:07       All right? You're in the prime of your fucking life. Turning around. Wake up every morning. Have some positive thing that you say to yourself. All right? It's simple as today's going to be a great day. Alright? Fucked up that relationship with so and so. But I forgive myself and I'm going to go out that door and I'm going to be a fucking rail. Like, you know when you can attract somebody else too. You go out there, have a good time and when you meet a woman right that you like, just, just fucking be straight up on. It's how you doing, man?

You can learn how to fucking open up as a guy, communicate your feelings and learn how to fucking get closure with the woman that you broke up with or who knows. It opens back up. Who knows? Right? And then also you learn how to not make self-distribute learn how to pick yourself up off the fucking Mac. Cause I'm a tell you right now, you're 19 years old. If you think this is the first time you're going to get knocked on your ass in life, um, you're, you're sadly mistaken. All right? You got to learn how to get back up again. So this is a great opportunity no matter what. All right? So there you go. Grasshopper, take those positive words and go help yourself a great fucking day.

He goes, I keep trying to arrange to go out with guys some work, but they all commute in from another town and have girlfriends. They need to tend to, I find myself going back to my hometown a lot on the weekends to see my buds are laying pipe with miscellaneous chicks where I live now. So my very sad question is, how does a guy make friends, chairs, uh, you poor baby, you just don't their bag and all these chicks. You know what I would do? I'd fucking hang out with them.

Speaker 3:          01:02:33       do you play sports? Go play some pickup hockey. He'd go play some fucking softball. Go places to pick up soccer, football, whatever the fuck you call it. I would do that. I would get involved in some sort of an activity, a sports related. Um, if you're into like, I don't know, you don't sound like you're in to a comic con shit considering all the women. You seem to be fucking so, yeah, I would, I would, I dunno. I would do something like that. Is there an APP for that? I have no idea. All right. What time is it here? All right. Time for me to wrap this up. Uh, my girlfriend doesn't appreciate me.

Speaker 4:          01:03:09       Aw,

Speaker 2:          01:03:10       but go for it. Doesn't appreciate me.

Speaker 4:          01:03:13       Ooh. Um,

Speaker 2:          01:03:17       hey Billy back fat. I liked that one. Um, I'm a 21 year old guy. Currently unemployed. Well, why the fuck? Yeah, you're a guy without a job. It's like being a woman without tits and we went the fuck or a vagina. Yes. Women. That's what we look at. You like. I'm sorry. We are, we're fucking animals blamed God. That's how we're wired. I'm a 21 year old guy, currently unemployed and I live with my girlfriend and we've been together for a year and I'm, and I'm s oh, a year and seven months now. Uh, recently, it seems like she doesn't appreciate me anymore. Yesterday when she was at work, I made her coffee, did the laundry for her, bought her some pizza, and then picked her up. And all you heard that night was how I didn't rinse the dishes enough before putting them in the dishwasher. She doesn't act like this. Uh, she doesn't act this way to anyone else. And I feel like I can't do anything right around her. Would love to hear your feedback and go fuck yourself. Yeah, here's the deal. Here's the deal. All right? And you'll never get a woman to admit this, all right? But one of the great things about them having a boyfriend, he said he's going to pay for shit. He's going to take him out. He's going to buy or buyers stuff, right?

Speaker 2:          01:04:40       He's going to fucking, you know, your job as a man is to provide, okay. A woman, you know, after you give, you push her off the dock with you Johnson there, she can make a fucking baby, all right? And then immediately just be the greatest fucking mom and it's fucking magical to watch. What can we do? We pick up heavy shit that they can't pick up and we go out and we earn a living. Now here's the thing, as a man, the second you're sitting there and you don't have a fucking job, and she does, and now

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       she gets to feel what it's like to be a man, which is you fucking come home, right? You've busted your ass all day. You know, if you're fucking young, you don't have your dream job yet unless you Justin Bieber or somebody like that or you made it for professional sports. Generally speaking, your 20s, just the struggle of the dream Pope. And it comes true at some point in your it thirties so she's coming home and she's seeing you sitting there like a little fucking homemaker. And you know every guy sometimes you know when you come home and you look at you, you know, if your wife stays at home, your girlfriend stays at home and you just look at us. But she would not have any kids. It's like, what the fuck did you do all day?

Speaker 5:          01:05:57       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:05:58       it's like every Saturday for Yo, what the fuck? You know? But at the end of the day, like getting up and look at me, she's, you know, she's, she's fucking beautiful. She's bagging me, you know, all that shit that guys, I think of reporting. But for women, you got to provide, dude, you got to get a fucking job. You want, you want your girlfriend to fucking respect you again. You got to get a fucking job.

Speaker 5:          01:06:19       Okay,

Speaker 2:          01:06:19       you got to start bringing home money.

Speaker 5:          01:06:22       That's it.

Speaker 2:          01:06:23       That's it. See what I do is I actually, I bring home money and I do the fucking dishes, you know? So then whenever my wife gives me shit, I could be like, what? What is the problem? Okay. I'm like, fucking Babe Ruth here. I'm hitting home runs and I'm pitching a no hitter. What the fuck else do you want? What is the problem? So you that you know why I can say that? Because I have a fucking job. You don't have a job, sir. So no matter what the fuck you do, her problem with you. It's not that he didn't rinse the shit off. It's not that you did this wrong or you would drive it too fucking fast. It's the fact that when you guys go out to get a meatball sub, she has to pay for it, you know? Yeah. You want to see the all their feminism go right out the fucking window. You stay home. You'd be Mr Mom. That's what happened here, sir. What happened here, sir, is you stopped being a man to her. The second you don't have a job, when you're with a woman, you immediately become like this fucking 20, 25, 30, 35 40 year old fucking teenager. They look at you like you're a child.

Speaker 5:          01:07:28       MMM.

Speaker 2:          01:07:31       That's it. So you need to get a fucking job. Am I might, uh, ladies, I, am I wrong? I'm speaking for you here. Okay. If you think of fucking run just right into the podcast and I read your opinions and then I'll make fun of myself. All right? Okay. I got to get out of this fucking hotel.

Speaker 5:          01:07:46       MMM.

Speaker 2:          01:07:47       That's a podcast. Go fuck yourselves. I'll check in on you.

Speaker 5:          01:07:51       And, uh,

Speaker 2:          01:07:53       a dark day and uh, you know, I'm a, you know, after all that fucking depressing shit I saw in Charlottesville, I'm going to try to be, and I'm going to, I'm be fucking nice to everybody today. All right. I'm going to try to go on a nice little run up being nice to everybody. Go out of my fucking way to not be a cunt, okay. To be a little more empathetic as I just trashed women and spoke about them in a nice big generalized way. I'm basically a fucking hypocrite and I'm for life can stand why you guys listen to me. Go Fuck Yourself. I'll see you Thursday.
