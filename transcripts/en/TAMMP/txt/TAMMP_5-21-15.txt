Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on is Bill Barr and, uh, just checking. Just checking in on you on Thursday. Cleo, get over there and lay the fuck down. You're driving me nuts today. You're a maniac. I still love you. That's only because you're cute, if you will. Not ugly dog like a poop. Nope. Get over there and lay down, down, down. Lay the fuck down. The mastery spoken. Um, what's going on? How are you? Oh, why? Yeah. Welcome to another Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday. Monday afternoon. Fucking morning podcast, whatever I call it that just checking in on your podcast for short, you know, uh Oh, what a couple of days it's been, oh, what a couple of nights bubble. Jesus Christ. Unfucking believable. All right. I've already had myself all a hell of a Goddamn Day, right? I finally got my God damn truck, Beck, right? Brand new engine. Everything was going great. And then, uh, you know, I look cool for about six hours, six fucking hours.

Speaker 1:          00:01:06       And then, uh, there was something going on with the clutch. I don't know what was going on. He's guys that take a to do fucking phenomenal work they do. So some of the sickest fucking hot rod trucks I've ever seen in my life. And I think what fucked me over is one of the parts, you know, they make them in China now. You know, cause they don't want to play Americans cause they don't want to fuck with the unions and then it's not enough that they're going to underpay some poor Chinese guy over there. Cause people always go, all the Chinese, they don't fucking make them right. They'd make them right if he gave him the right fuck of materials. What's that Chinese guy supposed to do? Fucking uh, you know, fucking, I dunno, pull up God goddamn clutch out of his, out of his stomach like a chicken heaven aserion section.

Speaker 1:          00:01:45       Um, whatever the fuck materials they give them, that's what they're going to put together. So anyways, he's trying to say, maybe it's, maybe it's that thing. So I'm back to drive in some fucking car shape. Look at God Damn Dinner Roll. So why that guy got that going on right. Um, I went down, took a helicopter, you know, fucking thing here. I'm getting ready to do my check. Ride flew great. Everything was going good. My auto's what great nose was dipping down a little bit, but you know, I recovered and then a, all of a sudden my clutch was acting up. So I'm like, Oh fuck right. It's all freckles. Needs a hair cut. Who's getting to all you do is just buzzing. My head takes two fucking seconds. So driving up, I usually have this lady do it, but she's off today. So I said, you know, I need it.

Speaker 1:          00:02:28       I'm taking my wife out. Fuck it man. I'm just going to get my head buzzed. Right? So I go by, there's a barber shop, little candy stripe fucking sign thing going. So I pull over, I walk in, there's one dude sit in there, there's no barbers. Right? And I'm looking around and they got, they got fucking a this selling combs, right? They got all these fucking vintage hot rod magazines that playing music from the 1950s all of this should have been a warning, but it wasn't. I was just like, oh, all right, that's of cool, whatever, and then this fucking guy comes walking out wearing this smock, indicate that he was a barber and I'm immediately thinking, I, this guy next to me, he's first, right? The guy goes, he walks out, he sees me. He goes, oh, hey, how are you? Sorry. I say, I'm doing good.

Speaker 1:          00:03:14       How are you doing? He goes, great. He goes, are you have an appointment? I'm like, do I have an appointment? What do you mean appointment? He goes, you've got to make an appointment here. I'm like, dude, is a barbershop. I think. I said, what is this, a hair salon, and he's going over to the book looking at it. He goes, Oh, you know, I can get you. I got you. I just want to get my head bust. Take like five minutes. There's nobody fucking ear you can be. Damn this thing halfway done. You're chark off right inside. I was thinking that right now. Then he's fucking look at his log book. I just said, forget it. Forget it. I'm out of here. Fucking assholes done with that place for life. God Damn fucking hipsters, man. They've ruined everything. You know? I didn't realize that wasn't a barbershop. That was an ironic barbershop. That's why they had the old magazines. That's why they had Frankie Valli and the four seasons playing.

Speaker 2:          00:04:04       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:04:04       Rather than some old guy come walking out this, this fucking 30 year old guy walks out, he can't cut my fucking hair. This is what's funny. I fucking drive away my truck with the fucked up clutch now. Now, now I'm really losing my shit because I get in. Don't try to push the clutch in. It won't go all the way to the floor. So I've got to push it a little harder to get some ungodly sound in my transmission. So me, and I'm like, all right, I'm not going to take this back to the place because when I'm driving it, it's fine. But when I would stop for whatever reason, wouldn't go all the way to the floor. So by all means, all you fucking weekend warrior gear heads. Please tell me what it is. Oh, I know what it is. I know. Jackie, why do you fly wheel dog kicked over to quick chefs. Shut up. Sorry. So anyways, so I go to fucking drive away and uh, who's standing out in front of the fucking barbershop on his iPhone? Oh, fucking the barber shop guy checking his tweets or some shit.

Speaker 2:          00:05:01       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:05:01       And I'll make it, I just fucking drove away. Just like beside myself. Just go like, what the fucking God damn hipsters. They fucking ruined. They haven't ruined anything. It's just a so fucking, and this is, why can't you just be yourself? You know, why does everything have to be like mocking? So why did get my kid you just like I sweat. You know what it is? Cause he could took off their facial hair, wear their glasses, and they'll Robert Fulton fucking God damn outfit. Yeah. You know, what would you be left with? They'd have to be themselves and you know what? They're not fucking interesting.

Speaker 2:          00:05:36       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:05:37       Jesus fucking Christ. Really build. Do you have to go this big? Yes I do. It's a barbershop. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:05:45       You fucking walk into a barbershop. You sit down, there's a bunch of old guys there with their balls going down to the floor wherein smelly fucking old awful slacks with horrific shows and all you start thinking is, wow, I guess that social security really isn't going to be there for me. That's what you'd think when you go into a barbershop fucking dickheads. They should have to take that fucking signed out or at least put it in quotes, barbershop. Right? Is this a dumb thing to be mad at? Well, fuck you. I don't care. This is this. You know, I didn't want to be this man coming on the fucking podcast. I'm getting over a goddamn summer cold. What's the world coming to, man, you can't walk into a barbershop to get your fucking head bust. There's nobody there. And there's one guy standing there and he asked you if you have a fucking appointment. It's a, is this a Maserati dealership? What? What the fuck are we doing here? Right? Just have me sit down, put the fucking apron around my neck and just add, what do you usually do? I usually go down to the skin. Then the half of them, one and a half on top of one day, he'd go big bang, boom. The Allie, Allie, Allie, I'm done. Here's your 20 bucks. God bless Ya. Right?

Speaker 1:          00:06:54       Well, I have an appointment and he walks over. He looks at the fucking book, Jesus, because it should have been somebody get their nails done over in the corner.

Speaker 1:          00:07:01       Can you call yourself a barbershop? When you take appointments, you never have appointments. You just show up, right? I went to a barbershop when I went, I was fucking back in, uh, back in Massachusetts. I wouldn't a house, right? Just fucking walked in, sat down. So fucking old guy or door fucking shut down, gave me the same hair cut. He gives a fucking stay true in and out. I did it on the way to the gym. What are the great things? One of the few great things about having a shaved head as far as you'll never get lice again is it takes you two seconds, right? You just go in these zoom, zoom, zoom, you don't give a fuck. Who does it done over and then you fucking leave. Now the great thing is whenever you're going out, you know, you can just throw a shirt on. No one knows he didn't take a shower because you'll never have bedhead again. So I guess there's two positive six, but you know what, what are those positive things was taking away from me today? And I'm really sad about you guys. I'm not Jesus Christ. So people have told me a bunch of shit to go off on. Uh, I got, one thing I want to go off on was fucking Robert Kraft for some reason. Just rolling over and tapping out,

Speaker 3:          00:08:15       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:08:16       what happened to the other owners? Get together and just say, listen, we know Jim or say is a pain in the ass, but you know, this is just going to bring negative publicity. The NFL and over the last 24 fucking months, fucking understand. Now was a fan. I have to sit back. It take the fact that a league that didn't pay taxes since 1942 this is the first fucking year they're paying taxes. Right? How funny is it? I want to go on a rant. I have a fucking stuffed up nose. Hang on one second cause I have a summer cold cause I'm a drunk who can't go home at night. Hang on a second. I'm back. The NFL did not pay taxes from 19 two until last year. 2014 this is the first year they're paying taxes. You know,

Speaker 1:          00:09:02       meanwhile, whenever the military goes out on the field, does a display, they have to pay the NFL and the NFL sits back and acts like they support the troops. They don't support the troops. They charged the tropes. Right. And then on top of that, according to the Internet, so you know it's true. You know it's from that whole pink campaign. The NFL keeps 97 or some 95 97% of all the money from the pink hats, the pink mugs to Pink Jersey. Then they give it to the pink fucking Aa and she keeps like 90% of that, so they raised like a billion dollars. The NFL keeps like 970 million, gives 30 million to the pink lady, right? She keeps 90% of that and then she peels off $2 million for breast cancer and all these fucking scumbags is sailing around a giant picky on. These are the fucking people that are going to judge my Tom Brady.

Speaker 1:          00:10:00       They're going to call him a cheetah because of fucking air pressure. You know what I mean? I have to sit back as I got to sit back and take it as a fan. Tom Brady's a cheater because he went up against the colts and Andrew luck the how did the colts get Andrew Luck, by the way. Oh No, no big deal. They just tanked an entire season. Bilking every fucking NFL fan completely against the rules. Lost on purpose. They did it every fucking week for 16 games. Was there an investigation? Whether it's suspensions was, they're fine. Now they're from Indiana. Those are good down home folks out there, man. They put their pants on one leg at a time. They sit down with a ring. The dinner bell like got one of the highest clan memberships north of the Mason Dixon line. This is Indiana. They couldn't do anything wrong up there. We shouldn't even been facing Andrew Luck. Do you know ESPN? They did that study and they showed that the deflated ball was actually a disadvantage. Espn took it down within 30 minutes because it was going to end the story

Speaker 1:          00:11:00       because it was in their best interest to have it be an advantage. They took that fucking thing down, so I got to sit here and sit back with a guy who sits on a fucking rules committee and changes rules for the colts so they can finally beat the Patriots. Win a Superbowl, no suspension, no fine, no investigation. Right? Hey, here's the funniest thing. First game, Brady comes back. Who? Who they playing? The Indianapolis Colts. This is like this. This is like promoting a summertime blockbuster. It's complete fucking horseshit from top to bottom, but you know what? Craft tapped out. So that's it for me. I tap up, you know, unless at some point I go on, I am Rapaport and I school that sad ass Knicks fan.

Speaker 3:          00:11:44       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:11:44       You listening to me Rappaport, you've been ducking me on this podcast. Oh, I'm talking to you Michael. Huh? Not talking to you I and DB page. I respect the shit out of that. But as far as you as a sports fan telling you right now, you owe me an apology. Alright. And I will go on. I am Rapaport and I will get my apology. Huh? I'm just doing the shit. Cause at some point I know I'm going to go on his podcast. That guy gets amped up. He gets, he guys ever listen to I am Rapaport. If you want to listen to the only sports fan I know that's more uninformed than me and talks more from his heart than I do. He did a fucking, he did this unbelievable documentary on the early seventies, Nixon when the garden was eating four stars, four out of four. Right. The Fun. My favorite part of it other than watching what's his face beat up the entire Los Angeles Lakers, um, was uh, when Rapaport was trying to get one of the Knicks to say that Celtic fans were animals, he goes animals. Right? And the guys going Naba and no, no. And you hear Rappaport off Cam and go, come on man. Come on. Their aunts, their animals up there. Right.

Speaker 1:          00:12:54       It was fucking great. So anyways, um, so there you go. So that's it. I know you guys was sick of it, but I don't give a shit. I don't give a shit. So you know what I dunno. Fuck the NFL for the first four games ain't gonna Watch. I'll watch college football instead where I know it's crooked. Gimme a God damn break. How long do you think the Patriots could have a stadium like Seattle Seahawks before the entire league demanded? We took it down. You know what I mean? Quite somebody clears their throat in that stadium. The opposing team has to go into fucking silent count. It's such a fucking ridiculous. That whole franchise is felty. Their owner was fucking their own fan base over with the small beers and the large payers. Do you have a watch that youtube video? They had a tall glass for the fucking large one in little short fat one and somebody finally, they had ordered both suck down the short one poured the tall went in.

Speaker 1:          00:13:44       There was the same amount of beer. Oh there Phil. That's like some dukes of Hazzard. Shit. You might as well be putting fake fire hydrant next to people's cars. Right. Then they got dirty, filthy, sneaky fucking Pete Carroll is a God damn coach, right? Jesus Christ. I loved how he rebuilt that fucking program down there and USC. That program was so fucking filthy. They got stripped of a championship in a, in a, in a Heisman trophy and he snuck out the back door when the wolves were at the front, but now that he's at the pro level, I'm sure he's, I'm sure he's on the up and up. By all means. Let's just keep focusing on the patriots. They're the only guys. Lana Falcons got caught fucking pumping sound noise and nobody's calling them fucking cheaters. Ah, still just the glitch. That's just blow, right? That's it. Total fucking, this is a weird, the fucking world is somebody just wrote, Hey, somebody wrote me.

Speaker 1:          00:14:38       Please put today's barbershop walkout in your next bit. It's the fucking only other guy that was in the barbershop. The fucking customer. You know something? Show me something. My phone today, it was tracking. I had been, I didn't even know it was on there. It's called this locator thing. If you want to shut it off, I'll see if I remember how to do it. As you go on your phone, you go to the settings, click on settings. Then you go to notifications center and then you scroll down to something that I don't remember what it is. I don't remember what I can get you to there. Today's summary. Ah, you fucking content notifications, views. That ain't it sort by time. Oh, fuck you, man. This is unbelievable. This is why I always sucked at that game. Simon, who that Parker brothers came from? Was it Parker brothers?

Speaker 1:          00:15:31       I don't fucking know. Government alerts, amber alerts. What the fuck is this thing? Emergency alert. What a government alerts. Cause somebody let me know why I need to alert the government as a fucking 46 year old man. Um, oh Jesus Christ. I had been fucking rag and today. Oh, let me tell you, this guy's been pitching, you know. Um, all right. So here's some of the things that people wanted me to go off on this week. Um, they wanted me to talk about, oh, I forgot to mention, hey, I'm going to be doing an all things comedy live. We'll do it live. Fuck it. We'll do it live. We're doing it down at the comedy store next Wednesday, May 27th. All right. I'm coming off 19 shows and I'm bringing my fucking a game. All right, Mr. Um, no, I got, I got some, uh, I get sort of new bits that have funny shit to do.

Speaker 1:          00:16:22       Um, and a whatever. We're going to go down there. We're going to, we're going to sell the fucking place out. It's in the main room at the comedy store, Louis C k just to the special there. So, uh, the already famous room has now become even more famous with the release of his special. So, uh, we're riding on his coattails down there. Um, so come on down May 27th, the all things comedy live show, it's a sponsored by some fucking beer. I can't remember who, whatever. I'm the worst when it comes to this shit. But anyways, I'll be down there. Um, I'll be there. So people wanted me to talk about, um, some of these cleo get over there and lay down. You fucking maniac. Don't ever let your dog sleep in the bed with you at that point. They think they're a person and they just look at you like they look at you like that paying rent now, you know, it's fucking ridiculous. So anyways, um, speaking of that whole fucking thing about like the pink lady, the pink ladies, um, people wanted me to talk about this, um, to go off on this shit, but I mean, didn't you already know that this was, I don't even know if this is a legal government says for cancer charities are Shams.

Speaker 4:          00:17:35       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:17:37       All right. Well in Washington are rare. Joint Action with attorneys, attorney generals from each of the 50 states. The Federal Trade Commission says for cancer charities a shut up. Oh my God. What did I do? Why is it talking to me? How do you hit mute on this fucking thing? Oh God. I know. This is just going to come back and haunt me. Um, oh, here it is. It's one of these fucking commercials. You can't shut off right. There you go. Well, I can't, I shut you off. Why can't I shut you off? Don't I have a say? I turned it down right? I do mute. I have the power and then I scroll you down so I don't watch your fucking message. Um, anyways, in a rare joint action with attorney, blah, blah, blah, blah. I just said for cancer charities run by extended members of the same family con donors out of $187 million from 2008 to 2012 these guys were making like Derek Jeter salary between the four of them and spent almost nothing to help actual cancer patients.

Speaker 1:          00:18:44       Each of the charities charged with the subject of extensive reporting. What we charged a word, the subject of extensive reporting by CNN in 2013 and in an instant, CNN pat themselves on the back and an instant, none of the four charities in each instance, none of the four charities would comment. We were ordered out of the building at the cancer fund of America in Knoxville, Tennessee. I love Knoxville and where the object of an obscene gesture by the CEO of the breast cancer society in Mesa, Arizona. How funny is that? You fucking running a charity to raise money for breast cancer. You taken most of the money and then you have no comment to the press and when they show up, you flip him. The bird. Good Lord. Ah, it's always good to see somebody that you know is going to be a little further down and held in.

Speaker 1:          00:19:36       You are, you know what I mean? It gives you a little bit of hope. Like I'm not that bad. God can only be so mad at me when this guy's coming down the pike. Right. Then he luck. He'll die right before me. I might sneak by. Um, you know what's funny is that the level of stealing that these guys had to do before they got caught, the fact that they were taking like 97%, because I feel like the NFL is so fucking big and so fucking powerful that they can continue to do this pink shit if it's true. This is all alleged, by the way, you know, if they're taking the level that people are saying in the 90 percentile on all their pink horse shit, um, you know what I mean? I mean, I don't know that they, they NFLs right. Just below a bank as far as they're not going to, they're not going to take these guys down. That's the bread and circus. That's what keeps everybody fucking occupied while these banker comes, do whatever they want. Right. Um, anyway, so I dunno. I know saint Jude is a good one. I know the Jimmy Fund is a good one. I know Cam Neely Denis Leary, that cancer house is a great one. Um, I'm just sticking with those. I'm just sticking with another that, you

Speaker 5:          00:20:48       know what I mean? If I want to fucking,

Speaker 2:          00:20:51       okay.

Speaker 5:          00:20:51       You know, give money to veterans, have a walk up to a veteran. I think that's the best way to make sure they actually get the fucking money. How about that everybody? How about we do it that way? How about rather than the fucking NFL, charging these people to come out on the field and fucking Yammer on about that bullshit and then knowing that they're going to take this skim out. Right. They like casino, right? They get in their taste. Charlie fucking him. You may be popped your fucking eye out for Charlie fucking up. That's what they're doing, right? Skimming off the top. Just fucking walk right up. I don't know how to do this. Gotta be a way to do it. Can you just walk into a veteran's hospital?

Speaker 2:          00:21:29       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:21:30       She can walk in with a bad catch. All right. Oh, Nate said or cut out the middle man. Fucking go directly to them.

Speaker 2:          00:21:38       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:21:39       They wouldn't want that. Wouldn't want it that way. Then they can't track the fucking money in tax the shit out of it. Oh goodness. You know, it's been awhile since I've been this negative, you know, probably since the last Thursday afternoon, just before Friday, Monday morning podcast possibly. Um, that's gotta be fucking, I mean, Jesus Christ, I wonder if those people are like such psychos that they can actually sleep at night. You know what I mean? I've done a lot of fucked up shit in my life, but it keeps me up at night. That's my one saving grace. I will sit down, I'll talk in my sleep, I'll grind my teeth if I fuck up. You know what I mean? You know, it bugs me. These people like they, I mean, I can't imagine just sitting there because if you told a few, if you're raising the kind of money that they will raise it.

Speaker 5:          00:22:21       You know what I mean? You know? And one of them was like a father son, combination two different fucking charity. So he taught his son the ropes, right? Like Marlon Brando down to fucking, uh, help, uh, Chino Godfather one, godfather two. Right. You know, they gotta be just sitting there going like Jesus Christ at night after the accepted yet another award or at one of those Tom Cruise, buck Rogers things put around their fucking neck, you know, tirelessly working against the fight against cancer. Then at some point, you know, you got to stand up there giving a speech to people going, you know, each year, hundreds of thousands of people. I don't know how much it is. I don't really research it cause I'm keeping all the bike, get diagnosed with some form of cancer that I'm not familiar with.

Speaker 2:          00:23:10       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:23:10       Each year you guys give me body.

Speaker 2:          00:23:13       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:23:13       And I go out and get a cigar boat, but most of the money that's left after I buy that bulb goes towards fighting, uh, in step cancer, a very rare form of cancer that affects a couple of feet every year in Laos that we want to stop it. Thank you for helping us at, uh, believe me. I appreciate this for ward. Thank you. It God bless America. Um, what the fuck I'm

Speaker 4:          00:23:46       talking about here? Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:23:48       how far into this fucking thing am I? This. This was just a dumb idea. I should have gotten a better mood before I did this. It's probably what I should've done, right. You know, and I was getting dope. All right, so I'm back in fucking la. I've got to tell you something. You know what needs to stop? Does Anybody Flown Virgin lately? And Dude, they made like a fucking 22 minute music video

Speaker 4:          00:24:11       about

Speaker 1:          00:24:12       putting your seatbelt on. There's a part where they start, there's singing, and then there's wrapping, and then there's a robot part and then the robot goes, this robot wrap is over and you're thinking, Oh God, thank God it's over. And then they just go and ready to go. Put your fucking seat belt. All right. And there's all that Christina Aguilera over singing, doing all of that fucking shit, pointing it notes. It's, it's so fucking loud. You know, he goes, those fucking doses. We have those Bose headphones. I just never could fucking buy one of those things. That's the first time it was like, I really need to get a pair of those. I need a pair of earplugs and will I actually sit? I fucking put my elbows on my knees and I jammed my fingers into my ears and I hum for five minutes waiting for it to stop.

Speaker 4:          00:25:05       Um, yeah, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:25:08       You'll kills me as I was sitting next to my wife and she loved it. She thought it was great.

I keep talking about them, but uh, I got this right in my office now I got to take the video of, it's fucking unbelievable. I, one of my wallet, if he didn't mind. It's where we keep all the wallet keys and stuff like that. Clear. I'll get over here. Get over here. Clean up. All right. Get over here and lay down. Yo, you know your neck, Clara. Hi. What the fuck is wrong with this fucking dog? Cleo? Get in there. Oh, this is embarrassing. What are the podcasts? You just fucking walked away? Pillows.

Speaker 3:          00:26:53       Cleo. So every time we're around, she thinks she wants you to last night.

Speaker 1:          00:27:04       Oh, you just stupid excuses.

Speaker 3:          00:27:06       Four.

Speaker 1:          00:27:11       All right. See that? She just goes off. She just wants to go outside. I'm sitting there flipping out. I don't buy it. That's why she jumps up and down all over company cause she has to take a piss. Um, anyways. Oh, here's a cadets. I mentioned this restaurant here on broad street, right? Speaking of a pork chop to die for in Boston, Massachusetts, one 31 broad street, Boston, Massachusetts, head chef and row. Go in there, check it out. Tell him I said tell him the Thursday afternoon, just before Friday, Monday morning podcast. That's just jacket in on yet set. Yeah. All right. Um, so anyways, well we're winding down here. Uh, have you guys been watching any of the hockey playoffs? I finally got back into them now that my, uh, my run there in Boston finally, uh, came to an end. Um, what did I watch last night?

Speaker 1:          00:28:00       I watched Tampa versus the rages and I turned it on in the, uh, the, uh, halfway through the third period, and I saw Tampa score to go up five to four, and I thought they had him. And then the rangers came back with his fucking goal was like a minute left. Playoffs. I've been sick. Right. And then, uh, over time I fucking flipped out when Santa scored, you know, I don't know why I got to root for somebody and I've got to go for the underdog. But I also like the rangers. I would, might see the ranges when it, although that might make Rappaport happy. So I dunno, he doesn't watch hockey. Look at rapid portraits, that guy, you know what I mean? Does that guy look like he even remotely gives a fuck about hockey? Um, he would talk shit about though. I can imagine.

Speaker 1:          00:28:45       Um, anyways, what else? Uh, and then I've been watching, uh, Chicago and Anaheim Dude, if Anaheim, Anaheim one game two, I say they win the Stanley Cup. That's how big that game was. What did they hit? Four or five posts and those, those uh, three overtimes um, hey, you know something. Did you guys see when shy headbutted the puck in? That's one of the few times I was right on a controversial thing. I was able to figure it out was like, well wait a minute. If he can't kick it in is the way can use your fucking head. Um, but then I'd never seen anybody use their head other than Dominic Kaushik. Um, so anyways, so I'm still sticking with it. I think, uh, I think the ducks are going to beat Chicago only because Chicago has it been scoring a bunch of goals on him. Um, the fact that they've been hanging with them, they've been close games and that type of shit.

Speaker 1:          00:29:40       I just, I don't know why. I just feel like Chicago might be getting a little old. Who the fuck's can do? I was so busy. I barely watched any hockey. I'm just going with my guts. I still say the ducks and then the Cavs, the Cavaliers are going to fucking win. Cavaliers are going to win and Jason Law head is going to cry like a baby and he will have every field have Cavaliers championship pajamas. You know those Cleveland guys, they'd been waiting their whole fucking lives run for your lives. All right, this is the Thursday afternoon, Monday morning podcast, whatever the fuck you call, just checking on you on yet.

Speaker 1:          00:40:24       It was a fucking barbershop that gay, the little swirly sign and it said barbershop.

Speaker 6:          00:40:29       Oh yeah. So she, you should be able to walk in there and be like, let me get a haircut. And they'd be like, yeah, have a seat, grab a paper.

Speaker 1:          00:40:34       Nice. Justified on one. Number two should have Tom Brady had been suspended.

Speaker 6:          00:40:38       I have no idea as it's about deflate gate. How do you know about, you only watch sports? Well I had deflate gate has been all over the Internet. What happened? Something about football being deflated and that mess other people up and the Patriots are being accused of being behind it. Bill Bellacheck that's good. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:41:01       Oh yeah, that was great. You pretty much had it. Why was he suspended though? You Tom Brady? Yeah, cause he's flooded. You know, because he looks like a war hero and astronaut and a quarterback and a movie star all in one. That's why are you blaming this on haters? Yeah. Well I don't understand how fucking, uh, an organization that never fucking paid taxes for the first fucking 60, 80 years of their existence. All of a sudden it's gonna start wagging their fingers. Are People keeping all the pink cancer money for that Goddamn yachts hire

Speaker 6:          00:41:31       the same at Tom. Brady is suspended. You still

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       didn't answer that because Jim or stays a fucking baby and he weighed the balls. Do you have a play a board game with somebody? You have to play a board game with somebody and then you win and in the end they got to fucking find out some reason why that they lost and it has something to do with you cheated and they'll say like, oh, Tom Brady, like secretly deflated the ball beforehand. They don't know he did. They just have circumstances that maybe possibly could have known. It was basically like, like in baseball, some guys shaved the handle down, some people put Pine Tar. It was literally that level of Shit, man, they lost by 38 fucking points. Reminds me of uh, uh, what's that Jim Carey movie where he was like the liar liar? No, no. The, the one ace Ventura. Wasn't that the one where there's a no, somebody kidnapped Dan Marino. Right. And then like Sean Young, the actress or places out lays this out. That's what that reminds me of. Yeah. That was like a fundamentally she was claiming that it was sabotaged because it's supposed to have the license you, it's a fucking pony and don't show and it's over. And the show, is that what it's pony pony and dog show dog and pony show.

Speaker 2:          00:42:41       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:42:41       The ponies. The headliner. It's, but the saying his dog and pony not pony in dog, dog and pony. Look that up. I don't have to look it up. I'm telling you it's correct. Oh, fucking believe that. Pony and dogs. Thank you. Thank you for stopping by, by, by. All right. You guys have a great weekend.

Speaker 2:          00:43:08       [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          00:43:42       of self. For the last five years, I've been teaching guitar lessons full time at a very large music school in Chicago. Um, there are over 100 music teachers at the school with about 5,000 students. Every session, half of those students are under 18. The school has been around for over 50 years and is globally recognized. We'll see if I could figure that out. Was Chicago. I don't know that one was going to guess Berkeley. Now I get an email from the new director of the school is saying all of the staff are required to get their thumbs scanned by some company called bio metric.

Speaker 2:          00:44:17       What

Speaker 5:          00:44:19       biometric scans your thumbs into their watch system. We all already had background checks done when we were hired, but now they argue we need to have this done. Apparently all of the public school teachers in their entire city are being forced to do this as well. Basically anyone who is around any younger who was around any younger, please people please proofread your shit. You make me sound dumb. I'm already dumb enough. Basically anyone who was around any younger people for a profession is now mandated by their employee to get in this creepy biometric system. You see this shit. You guys notice this, all this fucking screaming and yelling. We do during every single election that comes around to pick the Democrat or the other Republican. It doesn't make a difference because when the real shit goes down like approving, giving biometrics the right to do this, we don't get to vote on this. They don't even tell us about it, so just go with the law. It's mandatory. You have to do this.

Speaker 2:          00:45:25       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:45:26       Anyways, he says, I don't want anything to high, but the mental picture of all of us, harmless musicians lining up like fucking cattle. Having some storm trooper assholes scanning my thumbprint into some super computer where it will stay forever is really depressing. Obviously this is all done in the name of air quote, protecting the children, but at what cost? Here's my question for you. I feel like this is my moment to take a stand. Should I make a deal big deal about this and try to rally all the other teachers to fight this or will I just look like I have something to hide? Uh, it is really, really hard to get a job at this school, so I'm scared to make waves. Do you feel like this protects kids from creeps? I should mention then the schools, 50 year history, no incident of a teacher. A student misconduct has been recorded. Everyone knows that pedophiles can't play an instrument. Lol. Uh, and do you think um, they are making priests get thumb scans? I fucking bet. Not all joking aside, I'm really bothered by this situation. What should I do, Bill? I don't know why. The first thing I would do is I would talk to other teachers.

Speaker 2:          00:46:31       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:46:31       And see how they feel about it. I think that's complete horseshit dude.

Speaker 2:          00:46:36       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:46:37       They, they have been basically working their way towards this since they first came up with photo id and social security numbers and all of that shit. It's all done under the whole guise of organization in your own fucking safety and it's complete horse shit. It has to do with them eventually trying to have a very few people be able to make the decisions for all of us.

Speaker 2:          00:47:05       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:47:05       That's basically what's going on. Okay. And the more information they have about you, the easier it is to be able to find you. I mean, think about that shit. They're going to have your thumbprint. They know what you're fucking fingerprint looks like. All right. They're going to have an a visibility to freeze your fucking bank account and your cell phone as a God damn microchip in it. Okay? So the second day, I mean this is like of day shit and they got these fucking robots that they'd been working on that can outperform human beings. I'm telling you, our days are fucking number. They are in jeopardy. The other day they had two human beings playing against a fucking computer. Those two people, they're helping

Speaker 5:          00:47:49       human beings get phased out. You should see I'm not competing, gets a fucking computer so you can figure out how it does against me and you can figure the computer's weaknesses and strong points so it can come back with even more game. And you can pump it back with more fucking information. So eventually I become fucking useless unless of course I know how to build a robot or know how to grease it's fucking joints. Yeah, Dude. I think, yeah, I think it would be a very uh, noble thing if you complained about that. I think people need to complain more. I'm guilty of it. I fucking rant here on this podcast, but I've never been to a protest, but I don't think that it's right that they, that they pass a lot. Like whether you agree with that or not, that's not something that they should be able to pass without the voice of the people. We should be able to vote on something like that. It's fucking ridiculous. I just found out from my account the other day after years of saying I'm not doing my shit online cause I don't want to put all that information online. I now have no option. I have to do it online.

Speaker 5:          00:48:47       You know, I don't want to put all my fucking information online,

Speaker 5:          00:48:52       my tax ID numbers, my social security numbers. You're right at your fucking mind. You're letting people in to your entire financial history, you'll let me Gigi or whole fucking God knows what they can do with that and they can ruin you. All right. I'll, I'm doing is bitching here, but I don't know, that shit really stretched fucking creepy as hell. Um, I would talk to other people would be like, dude, hey, you know what, what do you think about this? You know, sort of get it going. You know, just like how they started the revolution in this country. Hey, what do you think about those red coats? Yeah. Like they're kind of a yeah. Ditch right. To kind of dicks. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:49:48       Sent me this email here

Speaker 5:          00:49:51       that was a inspired by the fact that I was talking about this shit. And, uh, here we go. Ask Bill Bill. I am currently engaged, but I'm kind of over it. Oh, Jesus. Wow. I am glad. Let me read that again. Let's, let's all just take a deep breath and let's take that a tank when it's time to Jay age. Uh, let's take that one. And again, uh, I am bill, I am currently engaged but I'm kind of over it. Um, you know what, I might need the help of a female on this one. Hey Nia, they know you want to help me on this one. I've got a relationship question. If it gets a feel and your girlfriend's mad at you and you haven't even done anything. I think I just heard an exhale. What's that? You can't talk cause you voiced you making lunch. Oh okay. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:50:53       Are you

Speaker 5:          00:50:54       yeah, I'm recording right now. Yeah. And you hit me with this attitude. I'm sorry. She

Speaker 5:          00:51:00       what I want. I I just had Jesus. This is getting really awkward. Yeah. All right. My is under the weather and I actually forgot, she told me she was under the weather like 20 minutes ago and that's how self absorbed I am. Cleo, get down. All right. Just listen to this. Okay. Cause I think I also need like female help on this one. Could you take your hands off your hips and stop staring at me like that? Come on. Do you not want to do this if you don't want to do it? Okay. Okay. Bill, I am currently engaged, but I'm kind of over it.

Speaker 5:          00:51:36       She just laughed. Huh? This is a female. This is why I have you in here. He just talked to the people with your voice here. Hi. How are you? Sound like Demi Moore. I liked that. You know what I already talked about Andrew Mccartney, right? Brought up rob Lowe. I got the whole brat pack here. I, why don't you, you don't trust me. You got to look on your face. Like you're not trusting me. Like I'm gonna make you look stupid and I'm not. I generally want your help on this. It's a low budget podcast. We only have one microphone. All right? I'm currently engaged, but I'm kinda over it. Um, I love him, but our relationship isn't working anymore. I keep making excuses. Like my schedule has changed. I'm working and going to school, so I'm just stressed, et Cetera, et cetera. But, uh, honestly the excuses aren't working anymore.

Speaker 5:          00:52:26       I want us to get back to when we were having fun and sex and not arguing. He gets frustrated. He gets frustrated with me when I don't want to cuddle with him at night or fuck them at 4:00 AM when I, when I have to get up at seven in the morning to go to work, uh, then come home at five and cook him dinner and get to sleep by 11. And then she writes, okay, pause in the email. Um, why does he want to fuck or cuddle at 4:00 AM when I'm sleeping? Is this like a guy thing? I don't understand what he's thinking. This is my argument. It's four in the morning. Number two, he's half asleep, which means I'll have to wake up and get on top and do all the work. What the fuck? Number three, if I don't sleep, I'll be cranky in the morning.

Speaker 5:          00:53:10       Then I'll be mad at me because I'm being a total bitch. And for, um, being, uh, I like being alone. I love sleeping by myself. Granted in the beginning it was fun to sleep next to him, but now I want my own bed back. I don't understand what it, that he's thinking. Okay. Continuing. I guess she was digressing here. I'm almost done here. All right. Are you enjoying this here? Okay. Cause she's shaking it in. She's got a very serious look on her face. This is why I brought her in an expert. This is like Oprah, our relationship expert. Okay, here we go. Uh, we are planning to move in together, but it's not a good idea because I'm not really in the relationship anymore. I'd rather be alone. In addition, is there an ax murderer or outside?

Speaker 5:          00:53:56       In addition, I just really realized that that was, yeah. All right. In addition, um, come close to them. Like, Sweetie, here we go. Sit down and take a load off. You're not feeling well. Uh, in addition, he's the first man I've ever had sex with. Don't read this cause you read way faster than me. Just listen to my, the soothing tones of my awful voice. You just snort it when you laugh. That's adorable. He's the only person she's ever had. Yeah. Now don't, don't comment yet. Okay. We're building it up. We got the listener's riveted at this point. Okay. Someone's being hacked to death outside. Um, in addition, he's the first man I've ever had sex with. Uh, I am faithful to him, but when we have days like these, I think is this really as good as it gets? I'm sure he's thinking the same thing when I'm being an asshole.

Speaker 5:          00:54:47       That's the femur right there. That's the really got to give the chain, saw a full fucking force there. Um, oh. Well they did taken out that tree over there. Okay. Yeah. The sick tree. We had a sick tree tree had aids and r block and just keeled over. It's very sad. We stood out there with candles and had tree aids. It had treated, it was HIV positive. I'm not making light of AIDS making Jesus. Jesus. I don't know who to get more offended that you're trashing Jim Norton. Are you saying that I'm ripping them off? You do not. Why is my voice cracking? You do that. All right, let's get back this. I Dunno, I could totally be seeing this from a fucked up spot. Actually. I think I am because he's great now. She's going back this way. She must have her period this week. She's all over the map out.

Speaker 5:          00:55:40       Did you really have to punch me right fucking there? All right. He gives me whatever I want. And as far as material things go, typical broad, he buys me stuff. He's gray. I don't want to fuck him anymore, but look at all this stuff. Uh, um, he listens to me. Sarah says, I'm taking this one seriously because I'm think girls in a serious situation here. That's why I keep saying serious as many times as they can in a sentence. Seriously. Um, he listens to me whenever I wine and he has conversations with me that show me life from a different perspective and he's willing to work at our relationship and is committed to me. Those are the things that I love about him. Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh. Right. To me, those are the things that I love about him. Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah.

Speaker 5:          00:56:32       Right. I am getting through it. I got to do fifth. She just gave me the same, wrap it up. All right, fine. You're speaking for the listeners. I'm going, uh, but I can't live like this anymore. This girl is all over the map. I told him once that I wanted some space, like I wanted to wake up alone some days and he blew it out of proportion. It says, okay, I'll give you plenty of space. Let's break up. He did that shit. Um, and then she said, I asked if that's what he wanted because that wasn't yeah, because that wasn't looking like the worst option in the world. Oh Jesus. But his voice cracked and he said, no, that's not what I want. So long story short, I'm still waking up to him. He still asked why we can't fuck at 4:00 AM and we're still engaged. I'm willing to say if we can make a few adjustments in our relationship, I'm willing to stay. If we could, uh, if we can make a few adjustments in our relationship. Otherwise, how do I get out and hurt him the least.

Speaker 5:          00:57:28       All right, here we go. I brought in a female for this one cause I know, I know what you want me to tell you what I'm thinking first. No. Okay. No I don't. Um, she needs to break up with him. Okay. And why? Because she doesn't love him anymore. She's not in love with them. She recognizes all his good traits and stuff. But that's not a reason to stay with someone if she can't give him what he needs because at no point did she say well no, she talks about him wanting to cuddle and us know rather I think the 4:00 AM doesn't mean anything. I think he just wants to be close to her and that's the one time that maybe she slows down and is in bed and that's where he can wrap his arms around her and do all that sort of thing.

Speaker 5:          00:58:11       Cause it sounds like she's super busy all the time. So he wants to spend that time with her. So let's stay on track here. So what, why do you feel like she should break up with him? She, she's not in love with him anymore. Clearly. She's not in love with him anymore. She loves him. He's a great guy. Um, but she's not in love with him. Yeah. No, she is not off. Yeah. I think that she bringing up the good traits as she's trying to convince herself to stay in the relationship because she doesn't want to hurt him. Yes. She wants to be alone. She's not ready to get married and that's fine. He's going to be heartbroken no matter what because obviously he is in love with her. He wants to work it out. But it's Cliche, but it's like if she really loves him then she will let him go so that he can find somebody that wants to do all that kind of stuff that she's not because she's a bad person.

Speaker 5:          00:58:53       Wait a minute. Wait, before we get going, before we get going, let's, what's the, what's the, uh, what, this is a great topic for the podcast. Breaking up with somebody sucks cause you get, you know, they're going to start whimpering, you know, when you're going to drive their tiers with the dirty pages of a TV guide. And, uh, I don't know. I was thinking about a coffee table. What would be on the car? I always break up girls near a coffee table. Yeah. Well yeah. You're not gonna be sitting on the bed. You on the bed. You don't want to fuck no, I'm sorry. I just, sometimes he'd dump shit on this. Um, what did, what is the best way, what is the best way to break up with someone to hurt in the least? Do you have a technique? No, there's no way. Well, could you try to be funny on this thing and just try to come up, come up with the technique. I got one for you. Send an email, send it, send them a card.

Speaker 2:          00:59:45       Yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:59:45       that is actually for like a good occasion. So it'll have like balloons and like silly animals on it. Yeah, yeah, exactly. You just see you cross out all the good stuff you are. You add words. You aren't the love of my life, but there's going to be all this, there's these cool pictures. You have a new live congratulations. She could find um, a girl. Oh, she can be like, oh, let's have a threesome. And find like a really hot, sexy, funny, amazing girl. And they all have like dinner and drinks and all have a good time. Go back to the bedroom and they all start doing it and she could slowly slip out and she's got her bags packed. Dot. Right. Yeah. You know what that's like.

Speaker 5:          01:00:29       Two of them are having leg probably amazing. That's fucking awesome. Yeah. You know it's funny. You know it's funny is he would get no sympathy. Went to the bars. Like, look, girlfriend broke up with me. Oh God, Dude. How's she did it? How did she do it? Well, she fucking, we had a threesome and I start this unbelievably hot girl. I start banging. She just slipped out of the window and be like, wait a minute. That's like, you know what that's like? That's like as a comedian, if you have to cancel a Gig, but you, you do the effort to give them a replacement comedians. So there's, there's no pain. That's what she should do. Ladies and gentlemen, how about a round of applause? I knew there was a reason I brought you and that was fucking awesome.

Speaker 2:          01:01:17       Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:01:17       Fucking Neah Bay. You Go. Good for you. Good for you. All right. Thank you. Thank you for being on the podcast. This is, you know what? This is this weird thing like when you do panel on a talk show and no matter what, when the person wraps it up, you feel you still feel slighted. Like I was just killing them. We're going to commercial. Well listen, thanks a lot. Good luck on your movie. We're going to be right back with the Monday morning podcast. That was fucking awesome. High Five. There you go. Go make me a sandwich. Oh right. Huh? I'll fucking coolest chic. Jesus Christ. There's no reason to even to even try and top that one. I was, I thought that was going to be a new, uh, a new segment on the podcast.

Speaker 2:          01:02:00       Wow.

Speaker 5:          01:02:01       If she ever breaks up with me, she better fucking do it that way. Cause that would, uh, I wonder how long until the three, before you actually fucking discovered it, you know? And is that technically a threesome? You know? Because if he didn't bang the other person, you know what that's like? That's like you get a base hit, but you fall down in the way, the first base, and then the right field of throws you out. Is it bill? Is that what it's like? I don't think it is. All right.

Speaker 2:          01:02:29       [inaudible].
