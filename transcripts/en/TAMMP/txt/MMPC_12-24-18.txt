Speaker 1:          00:01:54       You know what it is due at the end of the day. They don't give a fuck. And if they're not slowly killing you, you're not still married. That's what it is. And all these broads out there bitch moaning and complaining specifically the white ladies about how difficult it is. You know the number one stat, how long you live. You went in that one. So go fuck yourself with your fucking being, counting whatever the hell they're doing and show some ridiculous tweet there. The other day they were talking about the top 10 fucking gross and comedians and this other comedian rights, all male. And it's just like, how is that guys fault? How the fuck are you going to put that on guys? You know, if you look at a census, there's more women than there are guys. So I mean, I don't know what to tell Ya. I just don't know what to fucking tell you. You know, write a better act. You know, ladies, get out there and go see some female comics supported better than you support the wn Ba. You know what I mean? Fucking sitting there yelling at us all the time. You guys are not exactly team players out there. Yeah. All right, so why don't you look in your holiday mirror? Takeoff is stupid antlers. Jesus. What the fuck? It's just, everything is just become that. Why does it this like wide switch work? A white male?

Speaker 2:          00:03:22       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:03:25       Um, anyways, this is the boohoo generation. Um, anyways, happy holidays, everybody. I thought I would, this was guy was like, man, this is fucking new you. This is Christmas Eve. I don't have shit to do. And there's just, there's just always going to be something. Just every fucking gets like, how was there always something? Even God, every fucking six days he had one fucking day or he didn't do shit and he created the universe. I'm a fucking aunt. Oh No. On a fucking the a universe on top of a fucking pin, whatever those fucking potheads say.

Speaker 2:          00:04:11       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:04:12       there's a line I'm going to use to my wife. Just out of curiosity, how do, how am I working harder than the creator? The creator of the universe gets more days off a year than I do. How the fuck does that work? I think you're being a little dramatic. I don't think I am. Take out a calendar.

Speaker 2:          00:04:33       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:37       Oh boy. This is what I do now. I just, I just go out to the garage. It's soundproof now cause it got my drum kit hair and I just, I lose my shit and then I come out and I just fucking put a smile on my face. Like fucking chuck Woolery. That's what I do. And I laugh and I rubbed my brow like, Oh God, you're killing me though. That's, that's fucking incredible.

Speaker 2:          00:04:59       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:59       You know what I want. You don't want, I want in the new year, I want one day off a week. Okay. If God needs a fucking one day, I should have to, maybe that's why we only work a five day work week, right?

Speaker 2:          00:05:10       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:05:11       Visit. We only took one day off. Then we would say that we were on God's level. Do you realize the amount of days off that I don't have puts me that I'm actually working harder than God and a couple of hundred years ago or 26 years ago in the south, I would actually be killed for this. What I would be doing was B could be considered sack religious that I was putting myself on a higher plane, that I could actually sit down with God and be like, Oh, what'd you do? Oh yeah. Well that's pretty impressive there a almighty maker of everything, but let me ask you this. What's that big goose egg on on day number seven on Sunday. What were you doing then? Ah, yeah. You put your big fucking creative feed up then. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       You got your holy Hammock over there. It didn't check. Well, guess what? I kept going,

Speaker 1:          00:06:05       oh look what happened to your creation. You know, you think if God could come down and he'd have enough time to fucking bang a virgin, you know, he could maybe fucking yell down my chimney every once in a while and be like, hey, hey sweetheart, ease up. You know, ease up on it. Maybe they could do that to all the fucking married women out there. How about you guys? How about you do that in the fucking New Year, ladies? I know we have all this fucking work to do. God knows. I've seen enough award shows this year of women giving me lectures on how to be a fucking man. How funny is that?

Speaker 3:          00:06:40       Well, I get very good man, but you're a bad man in the bad man. Shit did good. Shut the fuck up and get your trophy.

Speaker 1:          00:06:47       Jesus fucking Christ the fucking lectures and all these fucking guys with their balls tucked behind there. PNID exercise just sitting there in the crowd. That Tuxedo. I don't want to get in trouble. I'm telling you, somebody's got to do it out here in Hollywood. What are these award shows? Somebody has to throw a dinner roll. Just has to happen. I mean, if it's happened to me, I why? I mean equal rights. Oh, righto. Ready? All right. Anyways, you wouldn't know this, but I was actually, I was actually in a good mood 10 minutes ago until I realized there was yet another fucking thing. I got everything done. Okay. The fucking trees decorated. The fucking lights are up. All the gifts are wrapped. The last fucking gift that I was getting my wife to the Cherry on top. The Cherry Cherry on top. All right. You know, I just fucking, I, I, well, let me just finish that thought. I finally got that gift. I have it. There it is. Here it is. This is what you made to me. All right. Now can I have a 24 hour period period, but I just stay in the house.

Speaker 2:          00:07:55       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:56       I stay in the house. Nobody's coming over. Nobody's fixing anything. I don't have to get in the car and go down and go fucking get something. I stay right here. I don't read. I watch TV. I fucking relax. I put, I put, I put my feet up and for one day I'm treated like a king is as a, is that asking too much? This is like one of those stupid topics. So one of those fucking lady shows,

Speaker 3:          00:08:36       ladies, do we need to treat our men like kings occasionally.

Speaker 2:          00:08:41       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:08:41       I'm not saying you're not a queen and that saved the deputy.

Speaker 1:          00:08:48       Um, anyways, what are you guys doing for Christmas? I'm still in know this is my last podcast holding my headphone Jack here. Like, like a terrorist. You don't want my thumb over the top.

Speaker 4:          00:09:00       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:09:04       And uh, I dunno. Then I guess my life gets easier. I'm really playing the victim on all this. I should just be like, no, I'm not doing that. And you know, it's funny. My wife would have no problem with it. So what does that go back to now? Of course, back to the childhood. That's what it goes back to. I grew up with the sit down and shut the fuck up.

Speaker 2:          00:09:33       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:09:33       We had that carved into wood and hung up on the wall. Sit down and shut the fuck up. But now I get it. Now I get it. You gotta get, you gotta get married and you have to have a kid to truly understand your father. Then you get it. It's like, oh, I totally get them. No, I totally get the guy I know. Just coming home. What? I don't know. Just Ah, get outta here.

Speaker 2:          00:10:01       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:10:03       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:10:05       Anyway, speaking of broad, Jessica Curson, everybody, you know, you want to talk about somebody who you ladies should be out there fucking supporting. So there's not more people whining about the tour money that people are getting honestly out there. Um, Jessica Carson, man or woman, this is one of the fucking funniest comedians out there for a long fucking time. All things comedy. We're doing a special with our taping January 11th at the highline ballroom in New York City. I'm so excited for this, uh, telling you you watch or we're doing an all things Cardi. Paul Versey special, by the way, streaming again on comedy central. It's broken all their records for streaming online and it was named one of the top 10 specials on Interrobang Bang of 2018 that's a congratulations to the pride at Trenton, New Jersey, Paul Versey. Uh, and then we got, we got Ian Edwards coming out. We get Jessica cursor with the, until we got, I'm telling you, telling you, uh, we got some fucking, we got some, we got some, we got some good specials coming up. Um, in 2019. Can you believe that's the end of this decade? These last two decades have flown by because they haven't really named him. You know, where was the 60s? It was the 70s. It was the 80s. It was the 90s. And then it was just nothing. It was all about, oh my God. Y Two K is, is, is my fucking flip phone not going to work. How will my refrigerator work at one second past 12:00 AM?

Speaker 4:          00:11:44       Huh?

Speaker 1:          00:11:46       We'll uh, we're gonna party like it's 1999 still be playing on my stereo. That's what we worried about. And then all of a sudden nothing really fucking happened. There was no arm. Again, I think a couple people's like little, uh, well, those little handheld things with the stylist that everybody loved to have him back in the, I think a few of those crashed, but everything else was fine. Everything else was fine and we were so relieved.

Speaker 2:          00:12:13       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:12:14       dad. Uh, we never named the decade and we just started invaded people.

Speaker 2:          00:12:20       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:12:21       I Dunno what Trump is doing right now, but I love bringing troops back. I'm all for that. You know, considering all these fucking wars, if effectively bankrupted this company, company, this country. Well, it's just a big corporation now, isn't it? Yeah. We're gonna bring 'em all back. Bring them all back. Legalize weed, put up some solar panels, put the Middle East dot of business. Export the fucking we'd get everybody. Hi Right. Pay off the debt. Everybody thinks what? Shell again.

Speaker 2:          00:12:49       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:50       That's what I would do. All right? In any country that still has a problem with us. We'll send up some free tee shirts, couple of sex dolls, and it'll be all, but whatever the fucking Trump did. But that fucking fatty over there in North Korea, whatever the fuck he did with them, they went over there, they sat down, you know, they had some Jalapeno poppers, right? He got hurt. He got, he brought over a couple of fucking blonde hair, blue eyed who was okay. They gave him the old sweet and sour chicken there. That's a hooker move. Um, anyways, I don't know what to tell you. I don't know what's going on in the world of politics. Adult pretend to paint, touch it. I just, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:13:37       uh, I'm a man of the people who doesn't want to see the people. That's who I am. I'm the man of people who just wants to stay at home and his fucking house. All right. That's all I want to do. Do you know I like the regular people. I like the regular guy in any country just walking down the street and he's excited because he has that little moment to himself. Hey, maybe I'll go into the pub here. Have a quick little fucking beer and a shot. All right? Come on with this stupid look on my face. My wife's talking to me. I'm not listening. I'll just kiss her on the forehead. Pinch your cheek and face plant under the couch. Anybody who's doing that in any culture, any race, any continent, you're all right with me. I really isn't that what most people are doing?

Speaker 1:          00:14:21       I'm most people you know you've got a family. You just want to fucking feel okay. You know? You know it'd be great if all the people of the world just looked at the world leaders and just said, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, relax, relax, settle down. Everything's going to be fine. Okay. You get when you're in a palace, you were in a big White House. Okay? Everything's fine. You have plenty. You have your own jet. Okay, fucking relax. If you buddy, take it down a few, right? Well that'd be nice if he could just get everybody on the same page, but you can't. You can't. You put up a fucking youtube video without everybody's screaming and yelling at each other. Um, I missed most of that Kansas City, Seattle Seahawks game, but I'm going to talk about it nonetheless. All right, I'll tie right down. I would be a good start if I was a fan of these kids are city chiefs from Kansas City, Missouri.

Speaker 2:          00:15:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:15:21       That Kansas City, Kansas, Kansas City, Missouri. I would be very concerned. Okay. Cause Andy Reid is a great coach, but when he goes up against other great coaches, he's got to come out of there with a win. Andy Reid up against, so sneaky Pete Carroll. Oh pistol Pete boom. Out of USC. Right as the wolf was at the door, ran out the back door. Right up to Seattle.

Speaker 5:          00:15:51       Oh

Speaker 1:          00:15:53       sneaky Pete. Do you know Pete Carroll? How good that Guy Looks? You know he's a year older than bill Bellacheck. You wouldn't know be Carol. Looks like he's about 55. The man's pushing 70.

Speaker 2:          00:16:09       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:16:10       great shape. Full head of hair. You know, not a line on his face.

Speaker 2:          00:16:17       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:16:18       Across the way. You got Andy Reid, the every man cause like he drives a fucking snow plow.

Speaker 2:          00:16:25       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:16:26       You know when you just knew, you just knew Pete Carroll was going to figure out a way to get it though. You know what? Everybody is slipping out about Patrick Mahoney. You forgetting about Russell Wilson. You know, you just taking the guy for fucking granted. I would say that the Seattle Seahawks or the seven seven and one, whatever the fuck they record his dad there, that team, nobody wants to play a Jesus. Who the fuck is that know I know who the fuck that is. I don't know some somebody over in Asia, I've got my fucking cell phone number and every day, you know I don't pick it up. And then I listened to the voicemail and I hear this lady's voice just going now your car man, you got the bag for one 805 a pop up papa, papa up like some sort of fucking, I dunno what it is for, but no idea. Maybe it's, it's Kim Jong, US fucking secretary and the second may making fun of him on the podcast. What would you do with that guy called in? You know, fucking scared. I would be, even though he's in the other and then the whole other fucking part of the world to have a dictator call you up.

Speaker 1:          00:17:31       I think about the first syllable. That word Dick, right? Telling me right now, there's a reason why that guy's a dick. Maybe that came from dictator. Did it? Should I look that up? Would that interest you? Um, anyways, I missed most of that game, but she just, you just fucking do. You knew Pete Carroll wasn't going to sit around and get his fucking ass fired in Seattle. No matter how many people he lost. And I gotta commend that owner for sticking with them. They know what they got up there. Pete Carroll's he's going to coach for like, what do you think? Another 10 years, he's obviously hitting the elliptical every day is eating the steam vegetables. The guy's a beast. What do you guys put him in the coaching? Um, history. I mean like you got to put them in. I know he's got one. Oh, we needed that second one. Oh. Oh, we need to, you need that second ring, you know, to get in the conversation. Um, anyways, you know something else. I'm getting sick of this fucking Miami dolphins every fucking year with this undefeated thing in the 72 dolphins still go on hit 1970 fucking toe.

Speaker 2:          00:18:41       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:18:41       What are we going to quit glorify in that they went undefeated in 1972 with two white running backs so fucking long ago. That was Jesus Christ. 1972 they barely invented the Frisbee. The frisbee was like a decade old and you haven't done shit since then. Sort of the dolphins fans talking shit about that. That's literally, it would be like listening to them. A Knicks fan or they, that'd be ridiculous if they, if they've started talking some shit they, they have, I wanted since 73 they got a fucking year on you. Um, anyways. Uh,

Speaker 2:          00:19:22       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:19:23       I don't think my patriots, I don't know man. I don't know. And then that dude we got from the Brown's poor guy relapsed and now do you know, you just hope he goes and he gets

Speaker 2:          00:19:33       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:19:33       You know, self taking care of their, um, I hope they don't suspend them for good. I'm hoping that guy has a full recovery comes back and fucking has the career he should have had. But uh,

Speaker 2:          00:19:45       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:19:45       I Dunno. I Dunno. I'm looking at the Patriots now that we have home field. I figure we can win one. I don't know about another one, but you never know with Tom Brady and bill Bellacheck. But uh, if we're not going to win, I want us to lose in the first round so I could enjoy all these other teams that I really want to see do. Well. I would love to see Kansas city or a San Diego. How about the Cleveland Browns? How great would it see it? Can they make the playoffs? Like I said, I got the kid now, so I watch as much as I can. Um, I saw Baker Mayfield staring down his old fucking coach. Bit of a classless fucking move, you know, to be in the prime of your physical life, to be staring down somebody. It looks like they take Geritol. Um, but you also got to love somebody dead. Plays for the browns at the quarterback position. Having a little bit of swagger.

Speaker 2:          00:20:39       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20:40       Um, seeing happy Brown fans see Brown fans with hope.

Speaker 2:          00:20:46       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:20:46       You know

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       that late in the game. I mean, I haven't seen that. I want to say since the 1980s

Speaker 4:          00:20:54       mmm.

Speaker 1:          00:20:56       When they played in municipal stadium, so that's great to see. I love seeing the Texans doing well even though they lost to the eagles. That was weird yesterday having to root for the eagles. I can't remember last time I was in a position where it had to root for the eagles. I got to feel what it felt like to be a fucking eagles fan yesterday. Uh, no thanks. I'll pass on that fucking cons. Can you just put somebody away?

Speaker 4:          00:21:20       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:21:22       What else did I see? And I think that was it. I saw a little bit of that Steelers game. I watched a little bit of the Bruins play in the Hartford way. Liz, did we lose that game by the way? We were up like two to one and then, you know, my kid woke up from her nap Brolin's verse hurricanes.

Speaker 2:          00:21:41       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:21:42       We lose that game. Ah, fuck me.

Speaker 2:          00:21:46       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:21:47       Oh, we got smoked.

Speaker 2:          00:21:50       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:21:50       And the second period, three goals to one, so that put them up four to three and then they scored another one. A you sons of bitches. I love that they played the, what was it called? The brass something or other.

Speaker 2:          00:22:05       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:22:05       They played that, uh, the old whale or someone that they used to score a, yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:22:09       Papa. Papa. Papa. Papa. Papa, Papa.

Speaker 1:          00:22:13       Bye. You guys remember that whalers goal song was there was a brass something or other brass bonanza. They'd score a goal. Right. And then they'd play this song right here if I can unmute it. That's, hold on. That's how old I am.

Speaker 2:          00:22:44       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:22:45       The song was played in national hockey league.

Speaker 2:          00:22:47       Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:22:49       Buh Buh Buh Buh Buh Buh Papa. And it was at the pro level.

Speaker 1:          00:22:57       I'll tell you was weird. I just realized this. I tweeted about it. Do you know the Hartford whalers have been the Carolina hurricanes for one year longer than they were ever? The Hartford whalers? How sad is that?

Speaker 2:          00:23:10       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:11       They were the Hartford whalers for a, from 1979 to 1997. So what is that? How many years is that? That's 70 years. 17 years. 18 seasons. And from 1997 on, they've been the fucking,

Speaker 1:          00:23:32       the fucking Carolina hurricanes are y'all kills me is I never went to a Hartford whalers game. It was right down the street. I could've got there in like, I don't know how long, but it just seems so far away to me back then. Let's live in just outside of Boston. I could've got there no traffic in like 45 minutes, an hour. And I never went. One time my buddy had tickets and he's like, oh, but I already asked this other guy and then the other guy said he wanted to go and I'm like, God, no worries.

I would have played a bigger venue, but men came and chased the crowd away. That's sexism. Uh, name checked in a rap song, a Billy goat gruff. Just giving you a heads up that you are mentioned by name and a new song iron claw by czar face, uh, inspected deck from the Wu Tang Wu Tang clan and seven l an esoteric from Boston. Ghost face killer is on the track, but unfortunately the mention of got the filter of bill burr obviously comes from the white dude from Boston.

Speaker 1:          00:34:49       Well, what's wrong with that? What are you ashamed to be in a crack? Uh, keep up the good work and maybe you'll have better luck next time. Oh, Jesus. Look at this.

You should go on tour of a deli. You'll make more money than the broads out there. Um, I like, are you totally just fucking completely disregarded this guy as a musician just because he was white. I mean, what? I don't understand what's going on in the world right now. Okay. Can we just fucking, you know, if somebody is good, just say they're good. Can we do that? Can we stop with the fucking bean count and that shit. You know, I love that. You know, this business was like completely racist and sexist, homophobic and all of that type of shit.

Speaker 1:          00:35:43       And now to correct it, they now they're going to go the other fucking direction and just, it's just like they don't know how to do it. It's like, it's not about an algorithm. It's not a formula. Just whoever's the best. Just give it to them. Whoever makes your heart sing. Hiram, that's it. Um, named name. Okay. Where am I in boys versus girls? Dear Billy, wrong balls. Oh God. My balls are Ron too. I thought it was just my mouth now by my fucking nuts are dragged into it. An accessory to the crime. Uh, you mentioned a few times out. Glad.

Speaker 2:          00:36:19       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:36:19       Uh, how you're glad you have a girl versus a boy. I have one of each and I can tell you for sure that is that it's not the case. All right? So basically what you're going to do is what I did. I based the whole world on my wonderful daughter severed, evidently you don't have a good daughter. So now my daughter's going to be bad. Uh, not that boys are better, they're just different. Girls are very emotional and their attitude is way more defiant in different ways. Ironically, misuse of the word parenthesis. My four best friends all have one of each, eh as well. And we have had this talk a bunch of times. All right, now he has numbers on me. All right, now I'm losing.

Speaker 2:          00:37:00       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37:01       All right. We're all different people and parents and have different ethnic backgrounds. He's got a great algorithm going here. And one conclusion we came to quickly was that it's a trade off. Some things are way easier with boys. Uh, you're a man who's been around. So you know that there are major differences in the ways boys and girls and men and women process things do. Can you just let me enjoy when she's a kid? I don't need to know that she's going to hate me when she's eight. My daughter is very kind and very polite, but at times she can be a bit, how do I say, intense. Once again, I'm not trying to convince you that boys are better. Just that you'll see when girls can be a handful. No, I didn't think it was going to be an easy ride. I'm just saying that boys are animals.

Speaker 1:          00:37:51       They're lunatics like the first 10 years of their life. There are eight, seven, eight years of their, they're, they're, they're lunatics. Can you give me that sir? Now I've got to respect you because you're further down the road than I am. So you get the experience on me. I'm still a rookie here. I'm about ready to start the sophomore jinx year number two. Uh, oh no, I'm, I'm, I'm already two years in, uh, next month. Again, not a blanket statement. I'm sure your daughter will continue to be an angel, but she has yours and knee is

Speaker 2:          00:38:18       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:38:19       Spitfire jeans and she will surely show it in a few years if she hasn't already know. She has. She has. Um, I'm happy you're glad you had a daughter and not trying to convince you otherwise. So No, call me a cunt. I just think you're being a bit naive. Go Fuck Yourself. I hate just fucking call me naive. You argue like a broad, what you, you've see, this literally said, you know, I'm going to tell you something, but you have to promise you're not going to get mad, not trying to convince you otherwise. So don't call me a cunt. But now I'm going to call you naive a food for thought. Um, oh, go fuck yourself. That whole fucking thing, nick. I can go fuck himself. Hey, not trying to be this, not trying to be there, just saying your way fucking wrong. I'm not trying to convince you otherwise. Just saying you fucking, you know, you're a bit fucking naive. That's some food for thought. Hey, you some food for thought. Why don't you go fuck yourself. All right. Um, you are not me and I'm not. You and I, I'm, I'm very happy for you and your United Benetton colors of fucking friends that you have. Do you guys can all go fuck yourself. All right.

Speaker 4:          00:39:29       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:39:30       Jesus fucking Christ. I mean, I gotta be honest with you. You didn't really tell me anything that I didn't already know. Women are more emotional. Gee, thank you for that, Jim. I never noticed. I never noticed that men and women process things differently. Now you know something. Now I'm going to be a client. Let's go back to this. I have one of each. Not that they're better. They're just different. You had like your hands up the whole time. You know you fucking gun belt around your ankle, so then you do, you took a giant shit. All Lag. Yeah. You made a really bugs me. I like it better when people go, hey bill, you don't know. You don't, what the fuck you talking about? All right, this then at least I know where you stand. Grain and I'll still get upset. All right. Shitty new bosses I already know I'm going to handle when my daughter gets upset with me. I'll just be like, hey, oh right. Oh right. I get it.

Speaker 4:          00:40:22       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:40:22       they'll talk to you mother. I don't understand these things. Um, hey there. Hey there. Billy no boss. My company just got bought out by have a boss. I worked for Netflix. F is for family. My company just got bought out and this job I love will be majorly affected by this corporate shit house. I've had a lot of freedom to be creative and innovative, but that's all going to go away. Yes it is. Kick comes the algorithms. BOMP bomp Buh, Buh, Buh Buh Buh. Don't have fun. The fuck each other. We're a fucking cooperation for this shit. And the drinking water, who cares? It babies had birth defects. Um, I've been told that there will be a set of guidelines put in place that it will essentially rob me from all the joy I had. It's really heartbreaking because I just reached the point where I am able to make good money. The new bosses came in and started talking to us like they were exists. There were existing problems that needed to be fixed. This is of course ridiculous because they bought

Speaker 4:          00:41:23       mmm.

Speaker 1:          00:41:25       They bought us because of how well we were running out innovative. We've been, should I just quit now so I don't have to deal with everything that is to come. I saved a lot of money, but it's a unique job and I'm not sure I'll be able to find anything like it in the near future. Well then I wouldn't quit it.

Speaker 4:          00:41:41       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:41:43       I, uh, you know something, God bless anybody in the corporate world that deals with stuff like that and you don't, don't could be like, like when they come in, you can't tell him to shut the fuck up.

Speaker 2:          00:41:54       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:41:54       Cause what's going to happen is they're going to ruin the company. They're going to make it worse and no one's ever going to step to them and say that, you know, you guys took a great thing and you made it less great slash fuck the whole thing up. No one ever tells him that because all they do is look at the bottom line. Um, I have to, you know, I don't know. I, I've, I've watched enough fucking documentaries and shit and listened to enough people like they have to just like corporations the way they do business needs to be fixed.

Speaker 4:          00:42:26       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:42:28       Cause it's just a fucking runaway train. It affects our foreign policy. It affects people's quality of life. Um, everything from how much money they make to like the environment. How polluted or not polluted it is. And uh, until you get to, I dunno because politicians have their money pouring out of their pockets. Like they've just fucking are treasonous.

Speaker 2:          00:42:54       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:42:54       People that just, yeah, they exist without fucking borders. That they're the worst. They're the fucking worst. We can agree on that boy's first girls who gives a fuck? Just the corporate mindset. It's just fucking insane. A Merry Christmas. Everybody. Uh, my girlfriend, the aspiring model, dear bill, same shit. Different toilet. I'll rush through the generic intro, updating the girl of my dreams. You've been exclusive for three months, but I've been dating for a total of eight months. She's gorgeous. She beauty has no boundaries. I've been in other serious relationships before, but none quite like this. I'm truly in love with my best friend. Like something Nicholas Sparks shit up.

Speaker 2:          00:43:31       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:43:32       well who the fuck is that now? I gotta look that up. He says Yada, Yada, Yada. You get the gist. Who the fuck is Nicholas Sparks that he shits out? Models. All right, I gotta look this up. You Stan. Oh, alors Nicholas Sparks.

Speaker 2:          00:43:49       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:43:50       Bad movies. You fucking cunt. Oh God. I fucking, I fucking hate apple fucking cancer. You want to talk about a corporation that just infiltrated my whole life now? Everything I have is like run by those cons. This stupid round building.

Speaker 2:          00:44:11       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:44:11       He's a novelist.

Speaker 1:          00:44:16       What have I didn't want? I wouldn't have, well, no wonder I didn't know who it was. The guy writes books. All right, hang on a second. Merry Christmas to all my friends and readers are crazy. [inaudible] he writes books. Nicholas Sparks, one of the world's most beloved storytellers. All his books have been New York Times best sellers. Jesus Christ. And I don't, I back in the day I knew who the, okay, I would know about a guy like this. There's just no more bookstores. Ah, he's got a sweater over a button down shirt. These leaning up against the fucking pole on a dock. I mean this guy is a quality human being. Nicholas Sparks is one of the world's most beloved storytellers. All of his books have been New York Times bestsellers with over 105 million copies sold worldwide and more than 50 languages, including 75 million in the United States alone. Okay. Sparks wrote one also a male sparks wrote one of his best known stories.

Speaker 1:          00:45:17       The notebook. Oh, Jesus. Oh, I get what you're saying. You're like living a chick flick. Okay. I get it though. All right. Um, something. Nicholas Sparks shit up. Okay. So I guess he, he puts out a lot of product. Anyway, she's an aspiring model and pretty good at her craft. Her and the camera get along great. Anyway, her lack of experience has, there's still getting offers from unknown photographers in particular, a guy, she's done a few shoots within the past. This time he wants to shoot nude with and without pay. Fuck No. Obviously you have a problem with this. I want it. She doesn't need to be naked. Don't do that. I want, I want her to pursue her passion. But this in particular, does it sit right with me? I've never met this guy. He's not paying her to shoot. And what's her reasoning for wanting naked pictures of my girl.

Speaker 1:          00:46:07       I've watched enough Jerry Springer and forensic files not to trust it. Definitely. She talked to me wanting my blessing, which makes me feel worse. I told her my unease about it, but in the end I trust her and we'll be okay if she goes ahead. She wants to model so I'll have to get over things like this. No, you doubt the right now it's a tough pill to swallow. Any advice or comic relief you could provide would be appreciated. Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. No. Fuck this piece of shit. And then he's going to sell these fleas, naked photos of her when she fucking gets somewhere. This guy's a piece of shit. He's not even given a cab fare to get over there. No. Fuck. This guy with his artistic nude shots. This guy's a fucking creep. He's going over to her apartment. That guy is a fucking creep, so fucking creep.

Speaker 1:          00:46:58       He's gonna jerk off to the pictures. Okay. Any first year fucking cop would tell you that. All right, you got to go. Worst case scenario here to fuck this guy all day long, you'd have to tell you your, your, your, your girlfriend that you know, being a, being a model doesn't mean getting naked. You don't have to do that shit. That's just fucking creepy shit. There's no fucking reason ever for them to do that shit ever. Give me a scenario why they would have to be naked there. A fucking model. You're modeling clothes. You standing next to her refrigerator being like, wow, I'd lean, oh wait, what? I really liked that refrigerator now because that woman is so beautiful. You don't have to fucking sit there with your tits and your clam out. What the fuck is that for? Why?

Speaker 2:          00:47:52       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:47:53       Why does she have to be naked? Jesus Christ. A fucking two piece bathing suits going to show pretty much everything.

Speaker 1:          00:48:02       No, I would say no. I would say I got a bad feeling that this is going to come back. I want you to have a great career. This is going to come back and bite you in the ass. Your bare ass. All right. Did you go on over to this guy's apartment? He's not paying you and you have to get naked and he's taking photos and this is somehow going to further your career. He's going to send these fucking photos around. Your parents are going to see him. This is a bad fucking move. Say what I just said, but about the anchors in the f word. All right. Worst dessert. Dear Billy Baker balls. Uh, my aunt makes a peppermint cake every year and every year I look at it like, why would anyone want a cake that tastes like toothpaste? Was wondering if you had strong feelings about any desserts that have crossed your holiday table. Merry Christmas to you and your two angels. Uh, let's see here. I don't like coffee, so I don't like anything coffee flavored. Um, I don't like marshmallow. I don't like smores.

Speaker 1:          00:49:09       Uh, yeah, I don't like anything with marshmallows. I don't like, uh, I don't like candy and my cookies like m and m cookies or snicker bar crunches. Like that's just this unholy fuck. It's like, yeah, you're already eating a cookie. Do you got to jam a fucking, I don't like any of that. I don't like ice scoop ice cream with a co. I mean they're gonna have ice cream. We're gonna have a fucking cookie. I'm really not going to have any of that shit anymore cause I kind of got sugar on in my life. Although the holidays has come back a little bit. And the first time you have something with sugar after you haven't been eating, you're like, dude, what the fuck is this? It's terrible. It's terrible for you. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:49:46       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:49:47       But I, I like pie. I don't mind a little whipped cream on my pi or remain an Allah mode, you know, I don't mind shit like that. Fuck. My wife told me to make a pie. Yeah. Christ never ends. Does it? When will it ever, and when will it ever end? Who, who's at the Kingston? Where have all the flowers gone? Long time passing number that we have. Oh, there's something going on a long, long time ago. The Kingston trio. Yeah. I'm not into marshmallows. I'm not into fucking coffee flavor in anything and I don't like, I love the way cop if he smells so, uh, and I don't like, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:50:36       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:50:37       Yeah, I don't, I don't like incest. You was desserts

Speaker 1:          00:50:42       where the fucking cookie fucks the candy and the candy gets inside the cookies. It's just, I mean that's just for super, super, super fat people. Uh, that's like this speed ball. Like it's not enough to do heroin and just to coke you got, if you've got to fucking do a speed ball, you know, um, speaking of which, how about that Aerosmith song combination? Huh? Isn't that a great song? Walk into Gucci wherein he seva raw, barely stay on Carla Sam. So God Damn God, a dollar Shave Club, dollar shave club has already talked about this, right? Did I? I think I did. Yeah. My book, he already did the, I did both. The reads well. That's right. I was doing the, a shitty new boss. What are you, what a way to start the year.

Speaker 2:          00:51:28       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:51:29       Where's dessert? Oh, that's it. My done. I can't be done. That's only, oh, 51 50 while, but it was almost 51 50. Um, anyways. You know what sucks is we didn't do our holiday card until late this year. You got to do it right on thanksgiving. That's what my buddy told me last night. The Great Al Madrigal. Let me know that man does everything right. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:51:57       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:51:57       All right. Let's see what I can bullshit about for the next few minutes here.

Speaker 2:          00:52:01       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:52:01       Oh God. Yeah. I was at this fucking party last night. I can't say the comedian's name.

Speaker 2:          00:52:07       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:52:08       Oh, I'll tell it someday on his podcast. So I'm at this, I'm at this holiday party last night. Last night was a great party by the way. Um, I had a fucking awesome time at that, you know, to the point. I was one of the last people to go. And, um,

Speaker 2:          00:52:24       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:52:25       Uh, there was a comic there and he had lost like 20 pounds and he was already skinny. So he's like, yeah, I lost 20 pounds and fucking site. Right. And he's one of those people that he then keeps tabs on everybody else. So he sees me go over to the buffet and I got like four shrimp and I got a bunch of lettuce. It's like salad or whatever. And he's looking at me cause that's all you're eating. And I knew it was fucking with him because he's one of those people, like in order for him to feel good about being in shape, other people have to be a little out of shape. You know, he's got to, I got, I wish he would be laughing, right. I'm not being addictive and he loves his shit, right? So he goes, that's all you're eating. And that was, I knew what the fuck he was doing.

Speaker 1:          00:53:01       I was just like, yeah man, I can't eat that other stuff, man. I'll have to take a nap. So long story short, we're there for like four hours and I get fucking hungry. So my wife, you know, fixed herself a nice plate and I saw she had a slider. I'm like, Oh God, I'd love one of those. So I fucking go up and I go to the, uh, this is like fucking two, two and a half hours after I talked to him about eating the lettuce and the shrimp, right? And I grab a slider and I'm reaching for a case of Dhea, like a little triangle, a case of dia. And I just see this guy way off across the room. Hey, go day it go far. There you go. Right. And I know it's him. So I'm like, this mother Fucker, this guy, right?

Speaker 1:          00:53:42       So I deliberately ignored him because I wanted to see how fucking important it was for him to rub it in that I was eating bad and there was a bunch of people talking and it was loud. So I deliberately turned and walked towards him and I was looking down at the plate and he's going loud. They had gall, there you go, party. They had cow like that. And I fucking looked up and I put my hand on his shoulder. And I was like, dude, I heard you the first time. I just wanted to see how much joy you would get into it. He was crying, laughing. I was like, what the fuck is wrong? We had the funniest fucking exchange last night, right? I was talking to him and I said something, he totally made this face, he's cause whack. And he kind of stepped towards me when he said it and I said, dude, don't get my fucking face.

Speaker 1:          00:54:31       And stuck it in argumentative. I'm just making a fucking statement. Get cont right. And then he goes, I wasn't getting in your face or whatever. Right? And then like, it took me a half hour to process and I was like, oh wait, this guy's been to a zillion concerts. He plays guitar. His hearing his shot. And I walked over and I started laughing. I was like, dude, I didn't realize you were a little harder hearing. I thought you were being a dick. And we were just laughing our asses off that he was so fucking old that did. Now he goes, why? When people talk to him. And then I'm such a fucking defensive con that I got in his grill, like he was being an asshole to me. I'm not even drinking. And that happened. Oh my God, that made my night day ago. They a golfer, they go, hey, it goes stuff your face.

Speaker 1:          00:55:17       So I can feel good about being in shape. Uh, I'll say if there's one thing that I love in life, it's a miserable concert and this guy is, he's right. He probably figured out who it is at this point. Miserable Con Plays Guitar, um, uh, is happy when someone else's failing. I might as well say his name at this point and he's one of my favorite people in this business. Um, anyways, uh, l as I threatened, as I threatened I, I've been feeling like going back to church and, uh, I'm going to church today or this evening, I should say, uh, this is one of the things I have to do today. Then I'm actually looking forward to, um, I actually really enjoy going to church with my whole family because that's something I did when I was growing up. I don't believe a lot of it, but the, the underlying message before it goes, takes a left turn and we have to go kill some people is all religion seems to lead to God loves you and you love him and he just wants to love you and be happy and these other people we need to kill.

Speaker 1:          00:56:23       Um, I take it, just dislike the a, it just, it's a nice reminder to be a good person and I would like to, I would like to start going again. I'm trying to turn the fucking ship around. I lived a is it hedonistic? I Dunno what the fuck it was, but I am boozed way too much over the last, through my forties. And I said I was going to slow down to my fit. I was going to go stay in my fifties. All right. You remember B? What I'm doing, Yoga pod yields a Bali, a Navy did down dog lot left. I want to fucking eat better and I just want to stop fucking Bosun. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:57:07       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:57:09       Oh God. Am I going to do that thing? Am I going to be now that I'm a dad, am I going to start pretending to be who are, you know who I'm not.

Speaker 2:          00:57:18       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:57:18       Oh, am I going to send an example? I'm not going to lie to my kid. God knows I can't get plenty of fucking podcast to listen to dad. Did you drink? Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yes I did. Yes, yes, yes I did. And I did it too much and I wish I didn't, it was a mistake. Uh, anyways, having said that, how long has this booze, no booze run going to go? If I get through tomorrow, I feel like I can get through all of January and then I'll be getting ready to do with special somewhere. I got to figure out where I'm going to tape it and um,

Speaker 1:          00:58:01       they didn't, won't drink. So I'll probably go like to April and that'd be, that'd be a good thing. Get my liver a nice fucking break. You know what I mean? Like what's his face? Urban Meyer. So my livers, like every couple of years it's going to take a break, you know, for health reasons, I'm actually go into the last game. That legend is going to be coaching, man. That's something else. Where do you put him in the lexicon of Greg College? Coaches of all time, man. You got to put that guy up there and the fact that he was dealing with that fucking cyst in his head there, the point he had to like bend over at the waist you like, is that guy going to die? And he plowed through that. Can you imagine how much shit his wife was giving him? I just don't think he should coach anymore. That's all I'm trying to say. You're making it worse.

Speaker 2:          00:58:51       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:58:54       Um, anyways.

Speaker 2:          00:58:59       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:59:00       so what are your goals? I've had the same goal for fucking 30 years. One of the goals, a drumming goal and I'm fucking sick of it. Am I ever going to be able to play good times, bad times? I'm once again trying. I, I, you know what it is. I don't have this sticktuitiveness even I keep playing drums.

And if I have to move up to 76 BPM, if I just have to fucking inch my way up like that, that's what the fuck I'm going to do.
