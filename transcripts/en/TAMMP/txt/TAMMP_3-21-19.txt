Speaker 1:          00:00:00       All right. We ready? All right. Hey, what's going on is bill bird is time for the Thursday afternoon, just before Friday, Monday morning podcast and a, I'm not checking in on you this week. Usually I check in on you to see how your week's going, but occasionally I'll have a guest on at which point I'm talking to them and hopefully this fills up your ride home. Uh, I am with the one and only the legend from the San Francisco area from Prime Primus. Mister Les Claypool. How are you sir? Uh, I am well, I am fantastic. You just got over it. You literally just landed and you came right over here, which is, you're just a hardest working. I'm in jet setters. They say. Yeah, it's like an Irish setter in a jet. How was your uh, southwest? I'm going to guess flight down. No, I took one of the, I've never done this before.

Speaker 1:          00:00:48       I took a, uh, it's called, uh, I think it's called jet suite. Oh, and that's one of those app jet things. Yeah. I don't know. I have my, my guy out there set it up. I've never done such a thing was it, now here's a big question that everyone's going to want to know. Did you have to go through any sort of security? Do you just walk on the fucker? I walked on the fucker. Um, big box like bugs bunny. So you got there earlier than I needed to get at, which was like 45 minutes and I sat in a little lounge and I ate some beef Jerky, which I have some beef jerky if you would care for some dirty, you know what I think I'm going to pass. I just had a bunch of shit food that I shouldn't have ate and the uh, and the Goddamn lounge area here.

Speaker 1:          00:01:28       I should've gone beef jerky. If I could have held out, I could have had a nice protein because I had an ask Jim Beam, uh, you know, convenience store, pack of pack of Cherokee. But uh, I, I hop right on the plane. It was, it wasn't anything fancy. It's not like it's a fancy thing. It's just a convenient, you know, you don't have to, it just looks like a plane, but you get, it looks like a fancy planning. But inside it looks like a regular plain with, you know, you know, sort of cramped seats and all that. But it was, it was cool. I enjoyed the notion of not having to, um, be scrutinized by, by a guy and take my shoes off and all that one. Right. So that all part is perfect. But they, do they do any sort of screening? Like how do they know you're cool?

Speaker 1:          00:02:10       Ah, I don't, I don't think they ever did. I don't think they ever, that was it. I don't think that was ever a concern that I was cool. Yeah. I'm just saying like if I'm a terrorist, it's a fond the airline. No, no, no, I'm not, I mean, as far as like, I don't mean literally cool. I mean as far as like the reason why we all go through the security. So now you have this thing that's just generally, if you have the cash and you can download a fucking app, you can just get on this damn plane. I'm assuming it's, it's, it was my, it was my virgin run, so I'm, did you, was there anything, was there any that go, any of that concern is you got on there? Did you do a quick turn around to see if, uh, okay. Just trucker hats?

Speaker 1:          00:02:51       Uh, I it did not. There was a woman that came walking in and I'm assuming she had some form enhanced buttocks, like, oh, whether it's the pants that have the padding in it or she had some sort of, um, surgical, yes. Because it just, it didn't look like it didn't look like reality. It doesn't move. Like, first of all, the legs move, the ass doesn't, and then on top of that is the legs don't match the ass. Yeah. It looked like it looked like something when you were a kid, you would draw, you know, fun House Mirror. It didn't, it didn't look like real. It didn't look like reality. I'm just going to leave it at that. Right. So that was the only thing she knows. That could've been a bomb smuggled in that form of fashion. That was the only thing I saw that seemed irregular.

Speaker 1:          00:03:37       Did you shame or no? No. Why would I? How would I shame her? What would you do? I'd be like, do you think your phone, anybody with that fake ass? Could somebody please make sure you really know. What I would do is I would be a, I would be a coward about it is I wouldn't say anything. I would snicker to myself and I were talking about on my podcast and my standup. Okay, well there you go. You've heard of the cowardly lion. I'm the cowardly comedian, comedian. I like it. That's exactly what I am. Good. So I know you're a busy man and you, you don't have time to just be flying around and just sitting down and talking to some fucking Middle Act here who shames people with fake asses. There is a reason you are a man on a mission here. I'm man on a mission.

Speaker 1:          00:04:21       You have a new mission. I'm curious, you are here to promote things as, as most people who are very artistically inclined. Uh, yeah. I, I started asking you about your new album that you did with Sean Lenin called the monolith of full house eight foe, the monolith of Phobos. That was a whole album. That was our first album. That's your first one. So this new Lyme in the limpid. Well that's our, that was our, an EAP. We did our, the new album is, is, is, is different. The new album's called south of reality. I literally, before we turned it on, I asked you what is your new album? [inaudible] previous albums. Oh, did I say that? Jesus crossed. All right. What's it called? Uh, it's called south of reality. South. The reality. Yeah. Okay. This is a nod to a slayer. They'd south that heaven. So you south the reality.

Speaker 1:          00:05:07       So I didn't realize that we were nodding slayer, but I do enjoy nodding slayer on occasion. Um, I have to say this album, um, I've never had such a difficult time naming, nor coming up with the artwork for an album as really we did. Is that something that in the past is this come easy for the, yeah, they usually just, you know, flip pork, soda, how that's going to be an appetite. You know, these things just Frizzell Friday they just kind of, um, but this one, you know, perhaps it's because of the, you know, both Sean and I are very opinionated, but we just never, we never could come up with a title that will really set the tone or the artwork as, as well. It, it, it took a long time, but you haven't got the artwork here, but it's, it's actually, it's one of the best album we that I've been a health card.

Speaker 1:          00:05:59       No, no. Very cool. You know what your mind, even when you just said your pork Sodi like some, that's got to be an album title. Yes. That reminds me, David, tell David tell we'll call them, will text me with like the most brilliant joke that no one could think of other than him. And there'll be like, do you have a joke like this? And it's like, no date. Nobody has a joke like that. It's like, why would you like pork soda? Who Comes, who comes up with that? Maybe, maybe Beck Beck had some new pollution and stuff like that. Like Jeff Beck? No, the other back. Yeah, I know the rapper. Um, hey, so is that what comedians do they call each other and say, do you have a joke? Like if you're concerned, if you're concerned of like sometimes, uh, I don't know you've ever written a song, just came to simple and your dislikes.

Speaker 1:          00:06:42       Then I hear this in a fucking elevator or something. It's the same thing with like, just pretty much every prime as song. It'd be probably music. Oh yeah. We got up there on the screen. That's what the modern technologies, okay. South the reality. All right, let's go through this. Uh, you know, this is not a visual medium here for people. So what am I looking at? That appears to be some sort of insect, um, does not appear to be on this planet, but he definitely seems to be dealing with some sort of global warming issue here. It looks like he's at the polar ice caps and it's melting. It's got sneakers on. I like that. And he's looking into some sort of like your interpretation of compact. Yes. Is putting on taking the shine off his nose. Um, that would be a flea. It's supposed to be a flea. Okay. Um, because we have a song called like fleas. And so, uh, the flea made the, made the cut. Basically what happened was we w we were bouncing artwork off each other's Sean's and artist. I'm an artist, we work with a bunch of different artists and um,

Speaker 1:          00:07:45       Sean did the drawings for the, for the, for the first album. And um, somehow the notion came about if let's, let's find an artist to do something like one of those old Saifai paperbacks from sixties and seventies. And I stumbled across this piece of art and we couldn't find the artist. And we looked and looked and finally found this guy and he's this Japanese fellow that Sean ended up knowing about. And he used to do Omni magazine covers and whatnot. And, and he, after my brother used to read many renditions, he came up with this. So there it is. Now, how does that connect with the music?

Speaker 1:          00:08:24       I guess I have to listen to the album. Like this looks like some old school stuff where you just do like the, that kind of drug that makes you happy. You know, none of that crazy stuff that makes you think he can fly and sometimes done a lot of drugs. I ain't nothing he can fly. It kind of makes you happy, don't you think? The notion, the notion of flight, um Oh do I get that out of the fleet? This right here is why I don't go to museums because it just makes me feel dumb. I just like, there's no scoreboard there. I can't tell what's going on and then I just, it just ends up making me feel dumb. I think if you listen to the record you'll get a notion to what some of this stuff is. Like fleas is the closing song, which is a song like fleet.

Speaker 1:          00:09:01       The line is like fleas on the back of a dog eventually will be shaken off, which is the notion that parasitic man and eventually, you know, Mother Nature's trying to kick us off the off the planet cause we're just screwing everything up. And so Shawn said, we're like fleas on the back of a dog. So it was, it was a water will rise up. It was a moment where, you know, I had this lyric and, and I read it to him and he said, oh well we're like fleas on the back of a dog. And then that became another portion that became the chorus. So that's cool. That's where the Claypool, Lennon lyrical cooperative comes into play. I was thinking yesterday, I was out in Santa Monica and I just looked at the ocean, how big it was. It's just like, it's coming for us. Oh, it's calming.

Speaker 1:          00:09:43       Um, would you say that you are addicted to touring? No, cause every time I see is if you're not making an album bank account is addicted to touring. Oh, is that what it is? I got a kid in college, man, you gotta you gotta keep saying guys, you know I do get in legit. What was that? Did you can't get into school legit or did you pull that showbiz stuff that happened? If it was a bit of a handle down here, how many Cox I had to suck the um, well the urine and legit, we're not dealing with chimps here. He's, he's, I wasn't sure if you Photoshop his head onto like, wait, what? What did you, what were you saying? People. Oh, you're talking about the latest thing we're buying. So there, I mean there was some Hollywood celebrities that got in trouble. They were photoshopping their nonathletic kids had on top of it, like some sort of Lloyd it up guy.

Speaker 1:          00:10:32       And then the football coach would be in on, it'd be like, Hey, here's a great new year. They think like a white kid, put it on some Samoan kids body torso or something. And next thing you know, he's the starting linebacker allegedly potential for the USC Trojans. See I should have done that because you know he will, he's going to an art college so there's no sports whatsoever there. But just the notion that we could, we could have applied that Salvador Dali weird mustaches and the beard thing and just Photoshop it onto his, uh, his face and they'd be like, wow, look how creative this stuff like that. He's, he's, he's trying to get in on a sports scholarship to a school that has no sports. Um, no, he's an artist. He's going to Laguna College of art and design and he's learning to make video games. He's been into it since he was like 14.

Speaker 1:          00:11:17       He has been taking courses in the summertime at cow and Stanford and went on. He's all about it. That's his whole, Oh, so you're out here raw. You're out here hustling. But being a great dad, he could share his dream comes true. I'm a good dad. You are. There you go. It's one of my better, my better accomplishments. I wasn't sure how you're going to take the compliment. A lot of people can't take compliments. I'll take that compliment. I, I take pride in what I've done with my kids. I'm a good guy. Damn. Damn good father. Um, are you going to leave three cigarettes out on their foreheads? Well, you gotta, you gotta you know you to make a statement, you've got

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       to let him know who's in charge. You've got to set those parameters. You set the tone. Uh, we are going to be seeing the tour bus on this. Uh, you can do on a run right now. You're doing some dates. So we just promoting the album. Uh, I was just told to come down here and talked to him, talked to Vaughn, Birmingham and I, here I am. Um, yeah, I, you know, I have friends down here and just kind of popped down here. Just come to say, oh okay. But I know we have a record and we'll get ready to go on tour. The records new, we did Cole bear last week, week before, you know, we're out there see a slumming it too or out there starting to shake hands and kiss babies and all that one. Not. So the press too are starting to wind down now that you're on my, uh, he was starting to do podcasts, so wine to nap.

Speaker 2:          00:12:33       I think this is the beginning. This is, we're about to start touring and I, the thing is is this year was supposed to be mellow because last year was a big prime usher. We did the longest two or I've ever done in my, I saw you guys, I saw you in Austin. It was incredible. Austin and Austin city limits. I absolutely love that show. And I three times in my life I was supposed to see you and some bs came up on my business and I wasn't able to go three fucking times. And finally our paths crossed on the road. And uh, I was able to see you guys in Austin. I W I performed some dump the night before. Then I went to the beautiful place you guys were at and uh, I got to see the show and it was absolutely incredible. Like the way you, I don't know all this stuff that you do, the way you put together the music with the visual is just a whole experience that makes me wish I tried psychedelics at some point in my life.

Speaker 2:          00:13:25       So you've never tried psychedelics at any? No, I, I'm always, I've always been like a late bloomer, so I figure I'll try and do the thing with your cousins where you'd hold your breath, hyperventilate and then they squeeze you until you pass out and smack your head on the ground. And none of them know. I did see some kids at school. There was this big thing, like we didn't understand how the body worked. So there was, we thought this was amazing that basically what's, you'd sit there and someone would grab both your jugglers, either side of the neck and just squeeze them. Holy Mackerel. Yeah. And kids would just fallen over. And I or did you grow up? Uh, the suburbs of Boston. Ah, it was the 80s like there wasn't a lot of information out to m domain, my neighborhood. Yeah. So we just, we went straight to methamphetamine.

Speaker 2:          00:14:07       Oh, you did? Well, I didn't, but you went to Elliot. I forgot. I tried weed for the first time when I was like almost 40. So I think of it, I'll try. I remember saying I get it. When I finally got high I was like, oh, I get it. I get it. Um, but it's not something you partake. I think the way that I'm wired booze is a, I should probably smoke weed because I'm probably too wound up. But I relate to booze, like how it makes you feel. And also I feel like there's this a trajectory to it that I understand. Like I had one beer, here I am, okay now I've had to when this amount of time and now we've, now we go up to the second floor where that shit, it's just like you do it and like nothing happens until it does.

Speaker 2:          00:14:53       And then it's just like someone dropped a fucking piano on your head depending on the potency of it. And then you start falling and it's just like how deep is this fucking hole where with drinking you can kind of be like, oh, okay. Hey, people go into the hall. I'm the drinking too. You can do that. You can listen. I'm not trying to get in the way of anybody's fun here. I'm just saying the way I'm wired, where I would drinking, I can see the staircase down to the basement where with like psychedelics, I feel like I can maybe see, I would think anyway, like my never done second to I guess what's some fucking weed though? I've ate wheat a couple of times and never eat weed. That's, that's, that's the worst. I mean I've, I saw the last time I read, I saw the light.

Speaker 2:          00:15:37       I saw the light, the hold it and I literally said, don't go into the light. You have kids. It was one of my kids were little and I how many? How many milligrams was it? I have no idea. I was, I didn't even want it. We are in a van touring the, the, the east coast with one of my little bands and a couple of the guys. Somebody had given us some Claypool's bucket of Bernie brains, the frog brigade and JC who, who's just a, it's just a human bong was eating all these brownies, him and a couple of other guys and I was just hungry and we were driving to the hotel late at night and I was like, all right. He's like, man, these things are a hell of a week. I was, all right, let me have one. I'm just going to eat it because I'm hungry.

Speaker 2:          00:16:14       And by the time we got to the hotel, I could barely move. And it was intense. Yeah. I, the first time I ever ate wheat was like that. I, uh, my girlfriend at the time brought over a tray of brownies that her roommate had made and they will probably about the size of like a bathroom tile, you know, big square things, right? So she eats half of one. I go, well, how much should I eat? She goes, well, you're bigger than me. You should eat a whole one. So I eat a whole one. And then was sitting there and looking back, I was getting high, but I didn't, it was coming on slow. So I didn't feel like I felt anything. She goes and we were going out. She goes, well, your bigger, why don't you, why don't you have another one? Yes. So I had another one, the slippery slope.

Speaker 2:          00:16:57       I still didn't feel anything. And then as we walked out the door, I hate her other half. So I had two and a half, then got in a car and went to Newark Airport because we will go into Costa Rica and it hit me right at the fucking airport and it was one of the, uh, at first it was hilarious. And then the paranoia came in and by the time I got onto the plane, I just wanted to stand up and admit everything and just fucking get it over with. But um, probably for like a 12 hour period it seemed, I felt like, you know, when your foot falls asleep really bad. I felt like there was a ball of that sitting on my head and I remember thinking, oh, people say I got baked. I got fried and I was thinking, I'm literally frying my brain right now and I, I didn't enjoy it. It for like two days, I was like, we'd hung over. Yeah. And that was the end of that. No, it's making, it's actually making me nauseous. Just hearing the story cause I know that feeling.

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       Yeah. I just, why I don't eat, I just remember there was, and I was a big pot smoker for many, many years, but he still likes to smoke. I don't like putting smoke into my lungs ballgame. But you're a wise man. Yeah. Yeah. But then I smoked cigars every 10 days or so once every 10 days. I tried to, again, it'd be a week and a half. I have one, I dunno, red hour back. Look for a long time. He used to smoke them every time they won a game. He won a lot of games. He lived a lot of years. Um, how did you, how did you end up meeting up with, uh, Sean Lennon? Does he have any sort of musical background, by the way? Not much. I think his dad was a transmission mechanic. Oh, that was my dad's, sorry. Um, uh, his band ghost of the saber tooth tiger opened for Primus on a tour we were doing with dinosaur jr and we just hit it off.

Speaker 1:          00:18:42       Actually, he and my son hit it off right away because my son's like one of these guys that just absorbs random bits of knowledge and then, you know, regurgitate some to people to, you know, get these conversations. Did he get that from one way more is way more. He gets into all this nerdy stuff and Sean's the same way. Sean's like Encyclopedia Brown. It's unbelievable. You get, he can get him going on just about anything. And so they're just sitting there a little bit, a little bit of talking about the cosmos are talking about, you know, whatever. And um, so then, uh, this was on one of the tours and then Sean and I hit it off and we just kind of started jamming one day. I have so little dough bro base that I carry around and fiddle around with backstage. Oh, what is that?

Speaker 1:          00:19:22       It's, it just looks like, you know what a dough bro Guitar it looks like with a resonator, with a senior, with the big, uh, it's like, uh, it's like an acoustic her, but it has a, uh, a big chrome resonator in the middle of it. Okay. Um, and they tend to sound a little more metallic and I have a basis like that. So I was toiling away on it and he comes over with his acoustic and we start trying and then I started realizing, wow, this guy's playing, he's not playing, uh, just uh, uh, predictable counterparts to what I was doing or playing along with me. He was pointing some very interesting stuff and we've made a habit of it just kind of getting together and jamming. And I said, Hey, I want you to come out to Rancho relaxo at my place and see what we can come up with Rancho relaxo.

Speaker 1:          00:20:02       And we did. How does that, how does that work? I've always been fascinated because I'm such a huge music fan and was not given the gift. Unfortunately or fortunately I think I've seen you play drums. I know, but I mean, yeah, it's like Dad rock. You know what I mean? If you, if you give me all the answers to the test, he is like the, it's like the is the mainstay of the Australian economy. It's because their dad rockers, you know, I, I'm just, I'm just saying one time I ever jam with somebody and they actually had their own riffs and then I had to do what you were just saying Sean was doing and there was no answer to the test. It's like, hey bill, you know, cause before it was just, Oh, John Bond and played this, let's just fucking work on this til I can play it.

Speaker 1:          00:20:40       Which of course I never was able to, but I could fake it. But this one, I actually got together with somebody like, hey, here's my creative ideas. Can you creatively add to this? I just kept playing the same. I think my face literally turned red. I was saw, I was like, wow, I knew I sucked. I didn't realize I suck this bad. So that fascinates me that you got together with Shawn and what he was playing cod you ear like, oh, what is this guy saying? How do you, how did you learn how to like a free yourself up? Like what point did you feel at you? Like, Hey, I'm, I'm, if I'm, I'm in in this mood, so now when I pick up my bass, I can play the mood that I'm in. Like I feel like great musicians, you guys are literally just like talking with the instruments.

Speaker 1:          00:21:21       So like the way I can be like, you know, how was your day? Oh Man, fucking song off the boat and I am down here and this is my tone. You guys can do that with your instruments. Like how, how do you learn how to fucking do that blows my mind. Well, I mean I've always, I would have said for a long time, you know, playing music, it's a con, it's a conversation and interacting with jamming with other musicians, you're having a conversation. Some musicians are really great at reading a speech, you know, or, or classical musicians that can only read the written page. Right. I've, I've had people come into the studio and violinists or whatever, say, hey, you know, jam on this movie. What do you mean, you know, where's the written pay? Yes. And I would assume it's very similar to what you're doing.

Speaker 1:          00:21:59       You know, you can go out on stage and just tell the jokes that are on the page. Or you can tell the jokes on the page and throw in a little zippity do in between or, or take off on a, on a tangent, a or full straight improv. Uh, I'm sure he had done it. All of those. It is the same. But the thing about what fascinates me is with, with stand up. Okay. It's like, uh, all I'm doing is talking. So you come, you know, from the beginning, Mama, dad day, you start talking and everybody like write us right now, just talking. You're just listening to me and then you're reacting to it. So you already know how to do that. So as a calm, a comedian, all I have to do is make that leap to, uh, you know, making it funny. And then of course, you know, blocking out the fact that there's a bunch of people staring at you, which is the weirdest thing ever in a year.

Speaker 1:          00:22:47       And see now you're saying things that to me are, are frightening. You know, and I've always been fascinated with standup comics because the notion of going out and, and doing a bit over and over, you and I talked about this a little bit once you said, well, I can I move it around, I am probably do this and I'm listening and I get that, but I can go out and stand in front of tens of thousands of people, hundreds of thousands of people, um, with is if I got a base in front of me, you know, I kind of, my base, I can do it, you know, but going out there without that thing and I would die, you know, I, I, I don't know I could do it, you know, but maybe, well, maybe that's what it is. Maybe it just, I dunno, I just, I just think that that's the most fascinating thing ever. That like, uh, um, because I had a period in my standup where I was literally, I would just memorize my jokes and went up and did my jokes and then occasionally I would try a new one and was his big fucking moment. Like, okay. How was that for he was that new jokes? Terrifying.

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       Terrifying. How was it received? Oh, most time. In the beginning of it, it didn't do well. And then I would get panicked, which would make my brain go blank and then I couldn't remember my act and then dry mouth and then it just would all go to shit. But like I would just by continuing to bomb, like if for musicians who are listening to this, you keep going after that, continuing to bomb. That's that to me, that's the big hurdle right there. Uh, I don't know who said it first, but the, uh, this is the best way to put it. Like a, the comics for the most part, that to make it or whatever, or become pros of quitting. It never dawns on you to quit because that's what makes sense. It would make sense that if you felt that horrible feeling, you would be like, I don't ever want to do this again, which is what you feel as a comedian.

Speaker 2:          00:24:36       But if you're a comedian as a person, you feel, but as a comedian you, you don't think you think, I don't, I'm, I'm still going to go and do this. I just don't want that to happen again. And then that's, that's the, the thing that makes you nervous and make sure live on stage of like, fuck, is that thing going to happen tonight? But is there that element of, okay, I ducked, I ducked at, wait a minute, I just got a great seven iron shot. You know what I mean? Is there that, oh, absolutely. Absa fucking blue there. And so that's, that's what it is. It's that getting, uh, getting a laugh. Uh, yeah. And I mean, you literally, in the beginning you just living laugh to laugh. I remember that one guy in the crowd, that one guy, I heard him laugh or that comic who's actually a pro, said, hey, good job or good stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:25:26       And then yeah, I'll soon into into to this. Did you get the, to get that? The first time I really got a good one was a, there was a comic, uh, Mike McDonald and it's not the guy a rest his soul just passed away in Canada. It was a out of the Boston scene and I was in this comedy competition, the big radio station WBCN, which I'm sure it promoted, uh, sailing the seas way back when. Um, and uh, they used to have this, this thing called the WBCN a comedy riot and it was at stitches comedy club and it was to try and find, you know, the best up and coming Boston, uh, comic. I mean there's, this scene was just increase. I mean, I came at the tail end, I missed it, but it started in the 80s that BCN would do that. And it was just like, it was fucking insane if you, if you won that thing.

Speaker 2:          00:26:14       And then of course there was the curse of the ride if you made it or whatever. So anyways, in 1993, the last year of it and stitches clothes, like the week after, and I, uh, I was, um, I entered the contest and um, the night, my night, it's like if you won unite, then you went to the finals. So there was like a qualifying and then you had unites of the night. This Guy Mike McDonald was hosting it. I went up and did my bullshit and then went over and went well and sat down at the bar. I was still working at the dental office with my dad. And, uh, he came off stage and you walked over to me and he just goes, uh, he just, he just looked at me dead serious. So typical pro comic didn't laugh at all or anything, just look to me. He goes, look, he goes, uh, I don't know what you're doing, but keep doing it.

Speaker 2:          00:27:00       And that's all he said. That's all I remember him saying. And I remember being like, wow, I saw that guy on fucking MTV and he's hosting the Rye was the biggest thing ever. And then that was a thing over the next year and a half of sometimes doing okay sometimes having a moment of killing and then most of the times bombing. That was just something that I hung onto. That Guy Mike McDonald said, I don't know what you're doing but keep doing it. So if you hadn't got that, that little nugget. Yeah, that's the thing that scares you because I was thinking the other day, I remember that, you know, being an entertainer, we, we work on those nights when everybody stays home. So it's kind of cool during the week when they have to fucking go to work and shit. But then all of a sudden, you know, the holidays come around and all that and everybody's gathering around eating, fucking drinking eggnog and having the Norman Rockwell scene and you've got to grab your gear.

Speaker 2:          00:27:54       I got to fucking put on my stupid sport coat to go do a do a show. I remember the first time having that feeling was football season. And you know, still living back in Massachusetts and this is back when you actually had a fall before it just went from January to July. It's kind of seems like the weather now. And um, it was just that perfect, crisp, cold football, whether I was still living at home, you know, just got out of college and my parents are making a great meal. They had some friends over and we were watching, I think a BC was playing Notre Dame and it was this big thing to Catholic schools and both teams were ranked and it was going to be great. And I had a fucking show and I had to go down to Rhode Island to go down into some fucking bar that wasn't a comedy club.

Speaker 2:          00:28:35       I knew it was going to be a hell Gig. And I remember saying to my older brother being like, yeah, man, I don't, I don't know man. I don't, I don't, I don't think I want to go to this and blah, blah blah. What do you think he would think it would be bad if I just didn't, and I was booked on the show. I was going to like cancel it and thank God he just sat there and he listened. He's like, is that, I don't know man. I think he should go, should go. And I went and I remember it sucked going out, getting into my piece of Chez us old fucking Ford truck and I got into it and then once I got on the highway it just started making sense like, yeah, yeah. Thank, what the fuck was I thinking? What else do I have?

Speaker 2:          00:29:11       I suck at everything. I was terrible in school. This is the only thing I want. Why, why did you know? It was just my first experience. That was, I was sorta just like, uh, I dunno, I'd never lived on my own or anything was sort of me having a kick. My brother helping me kick me out of the nest a little bit and I went down there and um, so those are two things I think about a lot. If, if that could be a good show. No. Yeah, it older brother, younger brother, older, but no, it wasn't a good show. It was a, a I did. Okay. I think I did, but no, none of them are good shows. In the beginning it was, it was, uh, it was surviving. It was all, it was like my first like year and a half, like very rare would there be like open mics in an actual comedy club.

Speaker 2:          00:29:54       It was mostly a lot of, you know, Boston area was a lot of Chinese restaurants, sports bars where they turned down the sound of the fucking Bruins game, but they would leave it on, he says perform at the, uh, the 90 nines and restaurant and Bill Ricka, Massachusetts. And um, you know, I, I spaghetti Freddy stay in a basement. I've played like some shitty places. Um, but I still, I've listened to what you're saying and I go, man, that's, that's, those are just some big ass hurdles for me that I'm not sure I would have been able to go in and play in Spaghetti. Eddie is, or Chinese restaurants, whatever. But the notion too, I was going to ask you, cause I heard you say, Oh, uh, the dentist's office, you worked with your data at the dentist's office. Yeah. Um, so how supportive was he and your family to what you are pursuing?

Speaker 2:          00:30:43       Totally, totally supportive. Like my parents were really cool where, you know, they did what they did and they didn't pressure anybody to do, they definitely stress the college education, but there was just like, like everyone in my family does something completely different. Um, so you just, I dunno, there's this weird, my family's weird, it's really like loving, but everybody's a total loner. So it's like love is like implied, but it's definitely there. If you were to look at it, it looked like the Brady bunch, but there was all kinds of, you know, like most families, they had a lot of things going on there. But the, uh, the, the thing that I, I, you know, as you become a parent, I think what you do is you, like, you look at all the great stuff your parents said. He like, I'm keeping all that and then there'll be like two or three things that you'd like to adjust.

Speaker 2:          00:31:32       But one of the things that I am definitely going to keep is, um, that thing that my parents didn't judge me then I, I wanted to get out of going to a regular college, go to more of a performance school. They started doing radio that I got into stand up and they would totally 100% supportive. They never thought in a, never said anything of like, well Jesus Christ, what if you don't make it, you gotta be fucking destitute. Um, which was a period in my thirties that I had to deal with when I didn't have any representation or sleeping on a Fuckin Futon, but I never gave her the, Oh, hey, you know, it's, you've been working hard at this, but you might want to, you know, they're like, you know, you know, for a salesman over at the Chevy dealer, no. You know, it was a dick. The, uh, the, our butcher, he was an asshole when he just found out that he and my mother was all proud going like, Yay, he's over at Emerson College and he's majoring in communication. He might have a career in radio and he reigned for her. Mother just said, he guys, Hey, he goes, I don't know. Everybody wants to be the staff. Like that's what he said. And I remember looking at him and his bloody fucking apron. He would, you were standing

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       there when I was just like, fuck this guy fucking cutting up poor God bless him. Cutting up the pork chops and shit. But like the fuck is, we never even had a butcher. Yeah, you got to have a portrait. We didn't have a butcher. You just go to this store and there'd be some cellophane and away you went.

Speaker 2:          00:32:57       All right, well here's my thing. But the, but the great thing was was all I had to deal with was me. I didn't have to figure out how to get along with three, four, the fucking people and getting a van and deal with somebody.

Speaker 1:          00:33:07       I found with group traveling where the weed comes in and that's where, because I was not a pot smoker prior to getting in that van with this foot odor and the hippiest right. It was, I'm serious. Like, I smoked some dope and, and high school. In fact, uh, uh, lots of different story. But, um, tell it I could. My Dad, he, my dad was like, we got, we've always gotten along very well, but my dad was very young when I was born. He was 19. And my dad was like the Fonz, he was like a cross between the Fonz and Dennis Weaver, you know, and um, but he was not, he, he was married. He used to brag that when he was 19, he had a mortgage payment, a car payment, a payment on a washer and dryer. He was a transmission mechanic and he had a wife and a baby boy at 19.

Speaker 1:          00:33:49       Um, so needless to say, he was not the type of guy that in whatever year that was was running around smoking dope or any of that stuff he wanted. Yeah, he wanted to beat up those guys. So, um, uh, so when they found the tiniest little speck of weed in this film container in my bedroom when I was in high school, I got a lot of trouble for that. I'm sorry. He called the cops on me. Um, he did it to scare me. He called the local guy that he knew and it scared the shit out of me. Um, and that was actually sold to me by Kirk Hammett, by the way. Um, but no way. Yeah, we went to high school together. He used to smell, sound me weed, but I was not like a big weed smoker. I just kind of smoked to hang and be cool and all the musicians, you know.

Speaker 1:          00:34:31       But I, I didn't really enjoy it cause I, it was a very similar to you. I was a tall, skinny guy. And when he would hit me and just, you know, I couldn't control my brain. I didn't like it so much. So it wasn't until I crawled in that van in my early twenties with all these dudes and we start driving across the country and the joint comes passing by me and pink Floyd animals is on the stereo. Right? Then I went, okay, I'll have some of that. And it made the roads so much sweeter and I became a pot smoker after that for many, many years. For decades.

Speaker 2:          00:35:05       I've got to ask you a question. What, where are these fucking high schools? How was your musicians like you listen to guns and roses. It's like, oh slash went to high school with Steven Adler. You listened to the Chili peppers and it's just like a flea. When I went to school with a blanket on this lead singer's name Anthony, right. They just like, like a whole fucking band. It's just like, like this kids walking around, like being like, oh yeah, the bass player from a, from a Primus was in my ips class. And uh, the guitarist from

Speaker 1:          00:35:37       Metallica, I took Jim with him. Like, what, where the fuck are these high schools? Well, I mean, I grew up in, in an area, I was born in Richmond Panol, Elsa Bronte, which is a North East Bay San Francisco area. I mean, it's basically it. So it's all, it's all blue collar. You know, where I went to school, you said you would say you've taken the test. I'm, I'm taking that. I'm not, well, I'm going to take the test or are you gonna take this call? I took the test and the test was to see what job you are going to get at standard oil. You know, Larry Lalanne from Primus took the test and he did very well, but he said screw that. And he went off and play death metal in a band called possessed. Um, but that's, that's where we grew up. And so, uh, I dunno, I mean Kirk was in my, my Algebra class with Mr. Kelly and Kirk who have, you know, he had this dirty white tee shirts and big thick pop bottle glasses.

Speaker 1:          00:36:26       And he sat behind me just divvying up dime bags and looking at guitar magazines. And, uh, so I remember it because I would always be singing these songs and he said, hey Claypool, hey man, you want to come sing for my band? And I was too bashful to sing. I can barely sing now. But, um, so when it came down to it, I, I couldn't do it, but, and then I met this other guy who needed a bass player. And so I begged and pleaded my dad, hey, let me, cause we had no money. So let me, I know a guy who has a base for $30 let me, let me buy it and let me some money. And he said, well, if we're going to do this, let's do this right. Let's go see all over at house music. And we love that there wasn't a guitar center's back then.

Speaker 1:          00:37:08       Yeah, well I mean there was, but they were not where we live. You know what I mean? It's just more like local because I used to go to Norfolk county music. Yeah. So we went to Alice music and my bought a fender, uh, Memphis p based copy copy of a fender p Bass. And you know, I was going to give us a good deal and I'm not sure Al gave my dad a great deal, but I ended up, I had this base and I had to pull weeds all summer and work for people and what not to pay off this base, but I was instantly in a band. But what's the thing, if you were a bass player, you, it was easy to get into a bank. Everybody wanted to be Eddie van Halen. Nobody wanted to play the bass. So it was like, Hey, and bus.

Speaker 1:          00:37:43       It only had four strings. I figured it'd be easier. And, uh, I was instantly in a band and a way I went. But Kirk, he was, he also had this band called exodus, which went on to be exodus one of the premiere metal bands of the world. Um, uh, after he left Metallica, I mean, after he left exit exodus to Metallica, but we just had a good, well, music community, where are we, where we'd all get together and jam at Keggers and whatnot. And that's just what you did. That's a, that's that's, I don't know, I came from more of a jock town, so none of that stuff existed. And we weren't, we weren't, we were not jocks. As soon as I, I, you know, I used to play a little baseball, some basketball, but as soon as I picked up that base and I struggled, I didn't want any of that stuff touching my hands.

Speaker 1:          00:38:26       My hands became precious. But then I was a carpenter for, you know, eight years, beating the hell out of my hands. So, how did you develop that? How did you develop, cause nobody like you. So who did you listen to that we will you actually, I feel like if I had to guess, we listening to a lot of non bass players to get your ideas. I was listening to pretty much everything. But um, when I first started it was guys, it was definitely a Getty Lee and Chris Squire and John Paul Jones and people like that. And then I got turned on to the Larry Graham's and the Stanley Clarks and the Louis Johnson's, you know, remember Don Kirshner is rock concert. Do you remember that name? I know, but that was a little bit for my tops know MTV so late at night. That would be a, there was um, I want the midnight special, I think it was called and Don Kirschner's rock concert.

Speaker 1:          00:39:13       And that's what you watch those on youtube. Like I discovered those, like when youtube came out I was able to go back and watch the chief critic on Don Kirshner is and seeing the brothers Johnson and there's Louis Johnson old bucket. I was like, oh my God, what the Hell is that? So here's a question. How the fuck did you figure out how to do that? Because these kids nowadays that you can just look up basically any song and somebody will break down how to play it. Um, and sometimes it's actually the guy who literally played it. Like nowadays it'd be like fucking John Bonham. Hey, this is how I play that quick little triplet thing. You want to do this and blah, blah, blah. Good luck mate. Whatever plays bastards. I have it so much easier now. I know. And they're monsters. You had to sit and just figure it out or go see concerts, which I didn't have any money, so it was hard for me to even go see concerts, but just plan it.

Speaker 1:          00:40:02       Just kind of, that's why my style is the way it is because it's, it's, it's, there's no conventional element to it besides, I joined jazz band right around then and my music teacher was shocked to find out that I didn't know how to read music. So he gave me this crash course on reading music and I just was in the jazz band. So that was the only real theory I ever, we still know how to read music. It just barely just, yeah, you don't really, I mean he hears it as good as they are. You don't really need to do, I mean, unless you're like a session guy, right. And not too many people are reading music these days unless you're, unless you're in the orchestra, like a hipster thing to do in the music world. What? Read music, you know, they always do all the throwback shit.

Speaker 1:          00:40:42       You know what I mean? I have no clue. I mean I would love to, I wish my reading chops were better, but I, there's other things I'd rather do at this point then Polish my reading jazz. Well that's right because you have your new album, the catch south of reality and that's a flea on the cover. It actually learn what a flea looked like. I never needed, it was like some little thing jumping off on my dog. Um, with the Great Sean Lennon and you guys are going to be touring is going to be a US tour. You starting here in the u s going up to Canada. What are you doing and how we're doing? I think we're doing three or four tours this summer, so we're, we're starting in a couple of weeks going around the states and then we go out with Jim James and then we go out with the flaming lips saw.

Speaker 1:          00:41:25       That's awesome by the way. But before we wrap this up here, um, I love you bus by the Little Rhonda. Oh my God. You have, you bought like one of those old school like Grey Hound look and buses that has like the roof and then it goes up and it's like the windows. Is that what it was? It was it straight across? Straight across. It's a provost Privo say in France. And what year is it? A, it's an 87. Yeah, I knew it was an old school. It's older than I was. My wife said a handful of years ago. Hey when I'm letting you know, once the kids move out, I'm coming on the road with you. And I said, all right, well if you come on the road, you're going to be selling some booze cause we have a boutique wine label. What's the name of it? Uh, purple packet room.

Speaker 1:          00:42:07       Claypool, sellers. Um, but we make it's very nice. Peanut like I would have brought you some, I for some reason I didn't think you drank. Uh, cause you always catch me when I'm on the wagon. I'm taking this year off. I uh, you know the problem, what I did with booze was I brought it into my house. I let the devil in the house, cause my thing is if it's there, it's just like a gown ice cream. There's a gallon ice cream, I'm going to fucking eat it and there's a bottle of booze, I'm going to finish it. And then, uh, the same way, if I eat fast food than I create fast food from drinking booze, I just sort of crave it. But, so I just kinda got out of my house and going to take the A, I want to be that. I want to be that guy that has a glass of wine with the, with the, with the meal.

Speaker 1:          00:42:42       And he's like, oh that was great. That that was a nice a cultural mall coach. Ramal Couteau mall to my meal and then having to my house. So I have, well I have a lot of ice cream. I have, we do in the case of lasers. Amazing, amazing wine. No, but that's another thing though. Or it's an event. It's the same thing with cigars. I got him out of the house cause I started smoking Cuban. So you didn't go in the book cause I went through a big cigar phase in many, many years and I'm a humidor full of them. There was only like 22 years old or something. My thing about them is I find that, uh, with Cubans is so many of them, their wraps so fucking tight that, you know, like when he had like, um, like when you were a kid and you had like a shake or a malt or something like that and you had it like almost suck your brain out of the Bacchae it had just to get it to come, I felt like malls.

Speaker 1:          00:43:27       Yeah. So it's like, you know, there's not, it doesn't have, like, a lot of them don't have a good draw. It's a pain in the ass. And this, there's some, um, ones that I like more to Minuchin or Nicaraguan cigars that I'm enjoying and they're, they're not wrapped, you know, balled up like a fist. I still, but there's nothing better than a Cuban with the good drop, but like trying to find one, someone gave me a Cuban the other night and I was like, oh my God, this is amazing. I was just like, Jesus Christ, fucking eyeballs are going to pop out of my head trying to get a little mouthful of smoke here. So, um, I like the Aurora emeralds and then there's, um, to say on the one, what the fuck is it called? I can't remember. I just know what that one, so you're smoking like the big old Churchill's. Are you sticking with a little, you know, a, a fistful of dollars, you know Clint Eastwood's style, not the little ones. Ron White smokes those. I've seen him smoke few of those and he looks cool as hell. It's doing that, but not, I used to steal the old Tianwan of smalls and Swisher sweets when I was a kid and smoke them in the tree for it. That was always, Oh, it, my dad used to smoke the Dutch master and then he wouldn't, and he would always keep the box and then in there went all the loose screws

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       and everything would go in there, uh, inside the, uh, whatever, the little kitchen drawer there. So I told you, and you know, I haven't been able to pull it off yet, but my rode a bus that I want to get is I want to get one of those, you remember that, that uh, that GMC we, you and I were sending back and forth and I just, you know, you're a busy guy and that one with the blue leather interior, that thing was cool. And I know, I know, I know. I want to get, I just have to, I have to work it out because what it is, if I didn't have a fucking kid, then I would be doing the road like an animal and I could bring my wife along and blah, blah, blah. But, you know, I got this whole, I'm rooted now, which is great and I love it.

Speaker 2:          00:45:13       But, um, are you rooted here? Yes. And I love it out here. The dream is I want to get one of those definitely buddy who built my truck and my dad's car. Um, Redo the thing and I'm sorry, I'm trying to, I'm going to Burp here. It's so much bad food today, um, Turkey, but help you out. Turkey. That's I needed to, if this podcast was a tube, my body would be thanking you right now. Um, I want to get that thing totally like redone, like underneath, like to have, it still looked like 1974, 1975 on underneath be like 2019. And the thing that I would add to it was I would have a humor door and then it would just be like my, my vice mobile so I wouldn't do anything when I was home, which is most of the days now. And I only do, I do to two runs a month. So I'd be like, you know, and just like one, one night on each run I would go hot, you know? Well I, I had my face off and then that would be like times 12 months. That's 24 days a year. I got drunk, gives a shit my lever. But you know, my doctor, my family. But other than that, who gives a shit? Right.

Speaker 1:          00:46:18       Well, I mean there's many things in that. That's a big statement. One is you can drink, you don't have to get drunk. I mean, I drank the wine because I enjoy it every night. And that's called being mature and you know, with some little subtle, some beef Jerky, it's all good. Um, and then, uh, set the of the region. I see. I'm that guy. I'm the, I'm the, if you're looking for a vehicle, an older vehicle, I am the guy because I always tell people I don't do social media. My version of social media is going on craigslist and looking for old car parts and I'm not bullshitting. I'm always looking for Chrysler parts. I'm looking for this. And then the next thing, so when I hear somebody who's looking for something, and I did do a little digging for you at that time and then I forgot, but um, I used to have a 23 foot birch haven GMC. The 23 is, well, there's the table. Something's happened. I just noticed it's 23 in the 20th. This is the 26. And then there's the 23 to 23 is or are cool because you can take them into most campgrounds that don't normally allow RVs. And um, the birch havens where the only the birch havens and the royals were the ones that actually have real wood interior. So I'm, oh, I remember you sent me all of that stuff. Yeah, it's a whole, it's a whole

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       subset. Yeah. And there's websites about these things. They're, they're amazing race and when you drive them, it's like driving a Cadillac and the way the windshield wraps around you, it's almost like you're sitting on the bumper, you know, it's, yeah, it's really incredible rigs now with a few times I've done tours and I rented a bus or anything. The thing that I did love about that was, uh, first of all the guys that I toured with a toward, with three of my great buddies and like, it was like, he was so excited to do the show and you'd pull up in the bus, it was fucking awesome. And then you'd go and you'd do the show. You'd have a great time. And then we would get on the bus and you'd be so excited and we'd put in like, good fellows are anchorman or something like that.

Speaker 2:          00:48:13       And we would just sit there laughing the whole night. Um, you know, drinking and eating and just watching movies. And it was like the, uh, the comradery on it was, was, was incredible. And I, and I kind of, I do miss that. And a, I have to figure out a way I've been, I've been toying with it because my thing is, I think I want to do it is to just hire a driver and then he just has it and he just a different thing than getting the, the GMC right. I mean, not in Chino, but I want to get the GMC and just have the guy had, he just has the fucking thing and I say it right. And it's just like, all right, here's my tour goes from here to here because the pluses, buses, that's a whole different level that's like, you know, million dollar rigs.

Speaker 2:          00:48:54       And they were amazing. And that's why I don't do it anymore because when I got the bill, it was like Jesus Christ, because he was still, you know, drivers go and you want to leave tonight. I was like, yeah, let's get the fucking drive out of the way. I didn't realize I was paying overtime, so I already paid. I was, I already won one gig and a half is out the fucking window and then the bill came. You know what I mean? It's like, you know, you know, it was like fucking stop playing them Chinese joint. Yeah, you can step it up. Well, anyways, uh, the album is called south. The reality, you don't know where they can get it. I'm assuming that you can get it on iTunes and all that.

Speaker 4:          00:52:16       Berlin, the sports gave me back. Gas is brought to you by my bunkie. Dot. Agee. My book is the leader in online sports books.

It's march madness. Are you, uh, are you one of those guys who fills out a bunch of brackets? Are you going to fill out a bracket?

Speaker 5:          00:52:43       I used to be that guy. I got a kid now. So between watching like the Mickey Mouse Club, been a puppy dog pals.

Speaker 4:          00:52:53       Feel your pain there. I feel your pain. The kids had been out of town for like four days, so I'm just immersed myself in college basketball.

Speaker 5:          00:53:01       It's awesome to watch hockey or chalking watch basketball. She knows how to do this, but then like about three minutes, then she's just like, oh, watch out pass. So I essentially only one, she was highly life [inaudible] career him blowing out the spanker and all of that out. You know, it was blown up, shot our shops and continuing to go up after he blocked it.

Speaker 4:          00:53:35       Yeah. He uh, he blew out his shoe and he also kind of hurt his knee. And then there was this big debate in the, you know, amongst the sports, like talking heads, whether or not Zion Williamson should come back or just rest the rest of the year and miss out on the tournament.

Speaker 5:          00:53:56       It's pretty cool. Now go ahead boo. I stay and, and not have conversations like that. Just basically getting filthy rich.

Speaker 4:          00:54:21       Yeah. And I think, you know, I think we're going to, we're, we're close to that. They can't keep, continue this charade of like amateur athletics, but we're going to sign billion dollar contracts with the TV networks. I mean, specifically I like, how's ions? Kinda like, Nah man, I want to play ball with my friends. Like back up, you know, I'll make some money in the future. But I do think it's funny that everyone had to have an opinion about this, what this kid wanted to do and he's like, well my kid and want to play basketball with these dudes who I'm friends with. So it's the, at the very least they should just let them, you know, make money off their own name. You know, if there was a guy on a mass scholarship and Sun and Sunlight compass company wanted to pay him a bunch of money or a graphing calculator company wanted to pay a bunch of money to MDUs that graphing calculator that the school wouldn't have a shot and there's an amateur athlete please. It's just, it's just, cause the colleges aren't, wouldn't be getting a cut of that. And they already had these shoe deals. That's, that's the real issue.

Speaker 5:          00:55:17       The beginning of television and then the Internet streaming and all of that. And I want to listen to the coach and you know I was watching, I'm going to say the guy that much in this team, this team is playing. He comes back and it's just all about him so they started to kind of discuss it and one of the, one of the teller commentators don't, well you have to understand that when you get a player of his caliber he's going to have to get, he's touching my team still with nobody underneath. Nobody's getting whole team. It's just really near the completely, she has different game but it just sucks when they don't pay the kids and then also get to see coach k develop a guy like Zion for just one year as opposed to like, I don't think like the last big guy that stayed four years was a, what's his face from the stores just blanked on his name.

Speaker 4:          00:56:53       He stayed for a while. For sure. Yeah. I do think there's that element of like I want to root for these guys. You're after. I mean part of the reason you like rooting for a protein to like that's going away. It is. It is becoming, I feel like the millennial culture and plenty of people have talked about this specifically in basketball, they root for players now, like Odell Beckham would be a good, good, good choice too. I know a lot of people are getting Brown's jerseys cause they're back. It's like what is this nonsense for your team? You support your city, defend the shield.

Speaker 5:          00:57:35       Never gonna open up the wallet to get those kids to stay compared to what they would make as prose. Yeah. I mean even if they go in my business, if I sell out at the end of the day,

Speaker 4:          00:57:51       yeah, right. You're bringing the entire crowd. It's the Fab five thing. Jalen rose, Chris Weber or walking down the street, the, this, the college is making tons of money. They're selling their jerseys for $100 a pipe, but they don't have enough money to pay for it. Like that's, it feels like you could very quickly fixed that by saying, if we sell as Diane Williams Jersey, you get a piece of this period.

Speaker 5:          00:58:14       Yeah. Billions of dollars. Uh, you know, especially with like football has to physical or the offense. And the defense and all that. You didn't have time to like be going to class and all of that type of stuff. I mean, it is what it is. And the reason why those schools have all those beautiful buildings is because of the sports programs. So I mean they, they should be getting a, I dunno, so be getting a little something I would think.

Speaker 4:          00:58:52       Yeah. We know it's all those chemistry a advocates, they're donating hundreds of millions of dollars to build buildings. It is a,

Speaker 5:          00:59:00       as a transparent, then you're going to have this genius genius, I should say goodwill hunting kid. And He, uh, solve the math problem that there's not like a big ESPN Saidman on it. Right.

Speaker 4:          00:59:29       That would be hilarious if people walked around with Jersey, Asian kid on the back. He's figured out the first 31 trillion. It's like, who gives a shit?

Speaker 5:          00:59:40       Yeah. It's funny to watch those, those kids at Turner awkward just like freaking out. Oh man, this spelled correctly.

Speaker 4:          00:59:59       It's somewhere between a blooper reel stopper. It's definitely a novelty thing that people are watching for comedic. Like they don't play the highlights on sports center because they want to show some awesome words. They really just want to make fun of these kids. It's kind of wanting to, do you want to have some gift of some kids sweating and it's like facial reactions in his glasses and uh, yeah, that's what they're looking for. Not, not the celebration of scaling

Speaker 5:          01:00:33       freaking out.

Speaker 4:          01:00:39       Yeah. It's like a, it's a more intelligent approach to wheel of fortune.

Speaker 5:          01:00:43       Oh, absolutely. I can't figure out a bill as a basketball team has always been the canvas.

Speaker 4:          01:01:05       They are definitely one of the teams that people are throwing out as. Don't be surprised if Kansas takes an early exit from the tournament this year. They have, they have some, uh, they've had some issues all year and I think there were what? Sean unforeseen. Yeah, they're taking on north. Northeastern, yeah. There, there are four c going up against the 13. [inaudible]. This was the first year that in the big 12 tournament they weren't a number one seed. So every I probably 14 years since they didn't win the conference. I think. Yeah, it's been a crazy year off for them. But those are, those are sometimes a teams you have to be on the lookout for as far as bedding on teams with that kind of history that maybe just had a down year in the regular season, solid coaching, they can kind of turn it on and make a run. I mean, that's how I kind of think Villanova is going to do. They've won two in the last four national championships. They didn't have a great regular season, but they played well winning the big east. I think they could make a little bit of noise. So yeah, just to tie it up, Kansas is playing northeastern and the first round minus six and a half point favorite. So people still liking Kansas, I think, right?

Speaker 5:          01:02:07       Not, not northeastern box.

Speaker 4:          01:02:09       Yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah. They in it. We, we, you know, because we were going to talk to you. I looked through it. I come through it. I'm like, what's Boston teams are going to be in the northeastern is the only Boston and a, yeah, they won whatever time conference. They're in

Speaker 5:          01:02:25       Kansas. Jayhawks oh, all I gotta go. I gotta go northeastern though.

Speaker 4:          01:02:29       All right, so you're going to northeastern, so you're not a millennial who's just going to follow players. You gotta stick it, stick to the, the home. The home grown.

Speaker 5:          01:02:38       Nice. I like it.

Speaker 4:          01:02:40       So maybe, yeah, maybe ride the huskies have bill burr catching six and a half points bill

Speaker 5:          01:02:47       that Wednesday. Thursday.

Speaker 4:          01:02:50       It starts tomorrow morning. I think the first game tips at nine 15 Pacific time. Northeastern Kansas is going to be at 1:00 PM tomorrow.

Speaker 5:          01:02:59       Uh, that's got cigar bar written all over it. All right. I love it.

Speaker 4:          01:03:08       Go huskies as a, uh, as a comedian, you know, it's, it's easy to get annoyed. I think I had, uh, you know, the, the, the announcers when they try and be funny. I think the one exception though is Charles Barkley. Are you, uh, are you a huge fan of watching Barkley as a, uh, as a color commentator or a analyst?

Speaker 5:          01:03:27       Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. There's a lot of great ones. Time you've talked about some stupid thing. Nothing to do with the game. The coach is trying to figure out is his tendencies. I'd love Tony Romo.

Speaker 4:          01:04:04       Well, I just love that he waited. He saves his greatness for after he was done playing football for the Dallas cowboys. So I do

Speaker 5:          01:04:18       is that owner who looks like he should, that guy stepped in in the beginning when he got Jimmy Johnson, Jamie was getting all that credit elevator going down the field. They problem is the owner. It was not only wrong, but he's the quarterback. So he took all the brunt.

Speaker 4:          01:04:38       Yes, he does have a Montgomery Burns type vibe, a Jerry Jones

Speaker 5:          01:04:44       seat elevator to get down to the, well, we can run out there and get some face time when they went that that's, that's not saying in your own way.

Speaker 4:          01:04:52       Yeah, that is a, I mean that's a horrible move going on the sidelines. Just ask Arthur blank of the Atlanta Falcons when they were on the 28 to three and he goes down there with his wife and they're holding the hands as the lead slowly slips away and the paths go all the way back. And when an OT that's you just, you gotta stay in the state of your buttocks

Speaker 5:          01:05:11       right up there with watching somebody on Sunday playing the masters. There's nothing like showing it does because it takes, so he missed his game over like,

Speaker 4:          01:05:28       I mean, do you remember the Greg Norman show job where it was like, well, I mean, I remember as a kid watching this guy has completely ruining his life right now.

Speaker 5:          01:05:40       He looked like a guy in a public course.

Speaker 4:          01:05:42       Yeah, no, I mean, I was going to say that's what happens when, when you're playing a four summit to bell and Burbank and you're playing with a guy who just freaks out and I'm the third holy, he's throwing his clubs and it's like, all right, well this isn't gonna go well,

Speaker 5:          01:05:54       who is that guy I saw like 10 years ago for the first time I was like, I'm going to watch the masters from Thursday through Sunday. I watched the whole thing does it Kenny Perry?

Speaker 4:          01:06:06       Oh that.

Speaker 5:          01:06:07       No. What the hell was his name when he fell down a scorecard. You can, you can talk to his family. He just got in this car and started driving and that's it. Then we're going to be like a hoarder's. You walk by that and then you go on the golf course. That's like the best buy. It just looks like a regular, you know, strip mall. So the Internet, so he left and then just drive it down.

Speaker 4:          01:07:03       It's funny you say that.

Speaker 5:          01:07:04       What are the worst things I ever saw?

Speaker 4:          01:07:06       Yeah, you're right. It was Kenny Perry. It was 2009 so stellar memory 10 years ago did collapse. I've also been to Augusta and yeah, it's, it's Kinda like when you visit a very prestigious university that's dropped in the middle of a bad part of town and there's just, you walk through security game, you walk through gates, uh, Georgia tech and he went like this. The USC is a little bit, you walk through some gates and all of a sudden you're, the grass is green and things are nice and you're like, what the fuck's going on here? Yeah, kind of makes you think about society a little bit. You go on the outside of the gate to the Augusta and at strip malls and barbecue joints like that. That's all there is now. They call it discussed the for a reason shown. It's funny you mentioned that Hooters because uh, every year at that Hooters, John Daly shows up in a RV and just hangs out at the Hooters parking live and just signs autographs and talks about his crazy days. What a life that guy has. No, he's really on top of it.

Speaker 5:          01:07:57       He's one of the longest drive torque and the head of his card laugh, like I'm watching a stand up real fight at how this don't, just the raw power and just having that all set for going out and partying the night before and saying like, he's, you know, he's too tired or whatever. And he just finally looked at him aside.

Speaker 4:          01:08:57       He was playing pickup Jordan Jordan cocktails on the golf course. Lawrence Taylor. That was the opposite. Well, John Daly had a great, uh, he, he was in, he was doing an interview and he explained that he had trouble putting, because every time he would go to Putt, as he was pulling the club head back, he would start thinking about how much he owes his wife in alimony. He was paying her $35,000 a month. He goes, I can't hit a damn pot anymore. All I do is thinking about how much money I owe or

Speaker 5:          01:09:32       so sad. Yeah. Sunday comes around to that. No alimony and child support.

Speaker 4:          01:09:43       Maybe one day daily. We'll get some of that money back. A bill. Before we go, just your thoughts on NFL free agency or the NFL off season. The Oda Big Odell Beckham Trade, Antonio Brown. He didn't want to play for the bills and he ended up getting traded to the Raiders. Levy up balance.

Speaker 5:          01:10:01       Yes. Okay. I didn't want to play there and then it's just like he gets to go somewhere else. John Elway, all of those guys. I won't say, I won't say with an NFL quarterback because if people don't look bad and they have no offensive line, like your career's going to be over like all that. Like the Joey Harrington, he said, well that guy was a bus. It's like you got thoughts. He went to the lions. Who knows what he could have been. He wasn't running for his life for three years. So I don't know. I think I may feel swagger and a gal, his emotional issues or whatever, they're kind of becoming the mid West Oakland Raiders, so maybe that'll work if they can get a bunch of free spirits in there as they say. Um, I think, I think him and Baker Mayfield are going to be great together and I think it's, it's exciting just to see Brown fans excited. I'm happy for that.

Speaker 4:          01:11:14       I do agree with that. I, I do find it interesting that we as a country feel sorry for Cleveland and always want to prop them up when there's an opportunity. But yeah, it does seem like Odell Beckham walking into the browns locker room is like the dude smoking the cigarette, walking through a gas station. It May, may, may, may turn into nothing, but it also may turn it into a whole very awesome situation. Watch it come down a and Jarvis Landry, he's, no, he's no wallflower. That guy blast them and it's supposedly he's best friends with Odell so maybe they make it work. But he's, he's a guy who loves getting the ball and it's going gonna make that a point. So if Baker can kind of battery,

Speaker 5:          01:11:58       I hope it goes to the positive way and then they become like this hilarious, you know, exciting team to watch that has like the best interviews afterwards cause they all say a bunch of crazy stuff. That's what I'm hoping for.

Speaker 4:          01:12:09       Well and the networks are clamoring to get Cleveland browns games this year. So multiple Cleveland Brown games in prime time. It's been a long time. My uncle, my uncle is going to roll over in his grave. But you got, I mean the browns fans in general, Cleveland is a real legit sports city. Any team has so many die hards, whether it's the browns or the bills teams that maybe the city doesn't have a lot going on besides the team. You got root for those, those fan bases. So it's good to see they're getting some big time players in their bill. As always, appreciate you calling in to the podcast. Make sure you check out bill's a Monday morning podcast. F is for family. Anything else you got going on bill

Speaker 5:          01:12:54       now streaming on Netflix? It's an adult cartoon. I would say definitely some vulgar language and Scott, a lot of heart. I don't watch it around your kids. We've got three great seasons and we're wrapping up season four right now as far as writing it and season four should be out next year.

Speaker 4:          01:13:10       A quick sidebar to that. Uh, one of my kids fat stumbled across F F F is for family and I had that moment where I was like, no, stop. But it is funny. Great show, great says. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:13:22       Yeah. You guys just parents decide your own what you're going to do with your kid watching it.

Speaker 4:          01:13:32       I'm not a big fan of censorship, but I may be applied a little sensor show. You got it. You got to figure out the right edge.

Speaker 5:          01:13:38       All right. Thanks. All right guys. We'll see you.

Speaker 6:          01:13:42       All right. Appreciate it. [inaudible].
