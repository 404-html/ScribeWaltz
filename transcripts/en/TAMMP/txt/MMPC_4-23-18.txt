Speaker 1:          00:01          Hey, what's going on? Spill bird. It's time for the Monday morning podcasts from Monday, April 23rd, 2018 what's going on? How are you? How's it going? I'm actually recording this on fucking Wednesday. April 25th case. You listening to this and the future and you wanted to know what was going on with me as far as my health goes. Now notice I said, as far as my health goes, instead of health wise, I learned in vocab improvement back in high school. There's no such thing as the wiseguys healthwise weather wise. You know, that's why I can never listen to come fly with me. Why the, why is it such a lovely day? A frank, I know you connected, but that's improper grammar. All right? I'm not attacking you or your heritage of the fact that you from New Jersey, right? You overly sensitive so-and-so, um, of just saying that, that's, you know, I don't know who wrote that song.

Speaker 1:          00:58          Okay. So why don't you Scooby Doo da that, that, that blew over. Do a fucking dictionary and you, you find me wise Francis. Um, am I really trashing a dead fucking Frank Sinatra? Sorry, I'm, I'm a, I'm, I'm almost lied and tried to tell you I'm going call medication, but I don't take cold medication. Cold medication is for fucking millennials. All right. And even if you're older and you take it, you're a millennial at heart, he can't deal with the fact that you got yourself sick. You need to lay down, get eight hours and let your body fucking go through it. All right? The reason why your nose is running this cause it's trying to get the virus, it just led an APP. He's fucking assholes. I swear to God, man. The amount of people that gave me advice, you know, there's no cure for the common cold, but everybody thinks they have one. You know, I'd sink. I'd go ted twice. And Zinc shot a whiskey. Dube I manager told me, he goes, vitamin D, everybody thinks it's, see vitamin D unbelievable. Well, the greatest managers in the world, and he also knows the cure for a cold. I mean, who knew that? Just fucking we could Dave. Um, let's get that out on the way.

Speaker 1:          02:19          Jesus Christ. This is just the cold that won't quit. This is the cold that's letting me know that mother nature is regrouping. You know, right now we're squeezing her all right. Like the way Andre, the giant was squeezed in fucking Hulk Hogan in that documentary and they lifted mother nature's arm and they're dropping it down and they lifted up to dropping it down. And I'm like, oh my God, the bad guys are going to win. And I went point or I'm just going to stay there and she's going to start shaking a fucking blonde hair. That was always my favorite part. When oak would start coming back and he'd give him that one big head and then he'd walk around the ring looking up and they look it up at the rafters to his head. Uh, that was the best. I watched that documentary like three times.

Speaker 1:          03:05          And when, uh, when, um, I watched that, that part of the fight with NEA, we were both laughing our asses off in a great way, like day, just some of the greatest fucking performers of all time and professional wrestlers. You know, when I was growing up right through the rock and all those guys, like their ability, stone cold, all of them, their ability to work a crowd is just, it's second to none. You know, I got a buddy might still going like, dude, the Yampa isn't it like a fake fight, you know is but isn't it like a fake fight? It's just like I, how fucking dumb are you?

Speaker 1:          03:50          It's like, yes, it's entertainment. They take fucking set at like 30 years ago at some guy cried. All right. And the greatest thing they ever did was say that it was all arranged and all of that shit for the most part. So then they could actually talk about how fucking heart they got when they actually would do in these fake fights. I had to tell Burnsy that like fuzzy, if you knew, okay, we had a fake fight and I said I was going to pick you up and throw you across the room and you're going to land on your back, you know, that would still hurt even though, you know, we arranged that I was going to happen. Right. Physics is still in play there. No, sorry, I'm a little hot here with this fucking Mike's and I was having a problem with my recorder here.

Speaker 1:          04:36          Oh God. Um, so believe it or not, I'm actually on the other side of this thing. I completely lost my voice by uh, by Sunday and uh, so I started gargling with a little bit of a apple cider vinegar and some salt in there and that kind of cleared me up a little bit. Um, I'll do that shit but I'm not going down to the fucking drug store even though I did and I bought all this shit and I just looked at the ingredients. I'm like, I'm not putting this in my fucking body. So basically what? I kicked the shit out of my fucking liver so this medicine can fool my fucking or knows that I don't have a cold. I apologize to file stuff Ian. But I got to do this cause I'm going to be fucking backed up on podcasts cause I got the Thursday one tomorrow. I'm liking that. I love Lucy sketch where they got the chocolates coming down, except it's podcasting. I mean, Christ, I don't have time for this shit.

Speaker 1:          05:34          Guess what the fuck I watched yesterday on the plane coming back, actually went up to Boston and I visited with my family back east and I'm on a two by the way, the fucking anger that is still in Massachusetts. It's not really what the younger kids, which kind of makes me happy and a little bit sad. You know, some point you do have to let go of the anger, but hope I help all the characters are still around. But I was driving through my, uh, my old neighborhood and I this cop direct and traffic and a little fucking three way stop and he tells this guy to stop and evidently he didn't. And the cop starts flipping out and I'm like, fucking two, three cars down the line. So I, I can't hear what the guy saying, but he is fucking flailing his arms like Earl weaver, right? He manages the Orioles above fucking 40 years ago. Sorry. Um,

Speaker 2:          06:28          yeah.

Speaker 1:          06:29          And I'm laughing my balls off. How fucking angry is it? The Sky. Right. And then when he gets the guy to stop and then the other key waves us to start going, like that's not enough for him. He walks up to the guy's car and starts screaming at him. So I'm thinking maybe this is some young punk with his radio turned up and he's not listening to the cop. I show up, it's like some old dude with like white hair and this fucking eight foot cop is screaming at a

Speaker 2:          06:55          Ah,

Speaker 1:          06:56          I dunno how you'd do it.

Speaker 1:          06:59          I would not, I would not have handled that. Well if he came up to my window, there's no way I would've been like relax and then I would have been, you know, in cuffs. Cause she can't tell a guy who's flipping out and screaming at you to fucking relax. I need to learn my rights for those moments because I am a control freak and I forget that. I don't know how to fight in those moments and I just immediately go to go fuck yourself. And then, and then the ramification cups that I am not prepared for.

Speaker 2:          07:29          MMM.

Speaker 1:          07:30          I actually got angry for that guy.

Speaker 2:          07:33          Okay.

Speaker 1:          07:34          And started, drove past the cops saying all this shit to the cop in my car, to myself as if I was that guy talking to that cop of fucking nuts. Is that or is that normal? Is that something you do? I just feel like for me, Jesus Christ, um, I haven't been this sick since I'd been a dad. She was fucking brutal to get this sick when you're a dad because then you can't hug a kid. Uh, which is the worst. I mean, that's what you have a kid for seeking hog up, right. In lie about what you did when you were a kid. Right? That's what you did. Wow. I used to make my bed every day. I did all my homework. I was never a problem for my parents.

Speaker 2:          08:20          Okay.

Speaker 1:          08:21          Um, anyways, I, uh, I had a fucking amazing we, so I got to work the Ryman once again. It's the third time I've been there. I did Vince violence, uh, Nashville Comedy Festival in 2014 then I did it again in 2016 I take my last special there, walk your way out, and then I got to do it. Uh, one show Friday lunch, so Saturday and they brought me a drum kit and shit to play on and I was so sick I couldn't play. It felt bad. And um,

Speaker 1:          08:53          I had a splitting fucking headache, but the shows were really fun. And I actually a, I always hit that Jack's barbecue next door and then, uh, I went to the Woolworth, they've got a Woolworths sales, like you owe the fucking lunch counter like where they had like back in the day during segregation where they just like only white people can sit here and get a grilled cheese sandwich. God made everybody in his image. Buddy made us closer to his image and he loves his chest a little bit better because of that. We get to see it at this shine and counter that RSD you on. Why, why, and why fucking play evil guy to go around bag. Uh,

Speaker 1:          09:35          so I sat down, I got a fucking cheeseburger. They're, you know, taking pictures. Just, I went into Woolworth's, like a white person going, oh my God, I remember these things. You know, he used to be able to buy from, can assure it. And then get a cheeseburger. So I walked in not realizing the historical, um, magnitude or what I was walking into. I was just walking, okay, you guys tell self sharps hair, nobody. We doubt we don't. And I walked right up to the fucking count. I was taking pictures and shit and everybody thought I was like some fucking historian and I was, I was as excited that had the same emotional historical context to me is if I walked into a Jordan Marsh, did they have Jordan Marsh as anymore? Do you remember all those? All those defunct superstores it's funny, they were evil when they came up cause they put out the mom and pop businesses and then eventually when you watch them get eaten, you love you. You ended up feeling bad for them. Places like mammoth Martin, you remember mammoth mart and a big woolly mammoth child world got destroyed by fucking toys r us leach mayor. They lost out to the fucking best buys radio shack to still a few of them left over. You know what I mean? They're like, fucking old Nazis is still, a couple of them are running around scurrying around South America. You know what I mean? Trying to get a fucking tangent fit in with the regulars. Right.

Speaker 1:          11:09          Well some of the other ones that they used to have, I can't even remember anyone so long goes filings, Jordan Marsh than Macy's just came along. It just fucked him all up. Just fucked him all up.

Speaker 2:          11:21          Okay.

Speaker 1:          11:22          Bloomingdale's beat the fuck out of everybody. And then you had all those like storage she just heard about. But you know, like Saks fifth avenue when I was a little kid, I, they might've been one in Boston, but I think if you wanted to go to Saks fifth avenue had to go to fifth avenue.

Speaker 2:          11:40          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          11:41          In New York City. And nobody really fucking knew all of the, all of that, all of that designer shit that, um, all the kids were nowadays like, and I was like mobile, Alabama. They had like a fucking, uh, Louis Vitton store. They never used to have that shit. You know what I mean? They only had three series of the BMW, the three, the five and the seven till they also had the sex. If you could afford one of those, go fuck yourself.

Speaker 2:          12:12          Okay.

Speaker 1:          12:12          They didn't make it fucking SUV. I didn't think. I don't think they did. They didn't have a one series, a to series of four series, you know, just fucking doing anything they can. That's like wouldn't miss Mercedes Benz drop their co? Not that quality, but they dropped it all the way down where you could buy the uh, was it the one 90? He the baby Benz, they used to call it. All of sudden you drive around in Mercedes Benz that cost the same amount of money as a Monte Carlo. Right. And you were, there's a Monte Carlo fucking t top pot dealing Douche, you know, who would it looked right in his Oldsmobile cutlass. But instead you'd ride around this one 90. He like, you're fucking sophisticated. Everybody saw right through your Keno second he got out of the fucking car. Right though your personal belongings fall on the fucking ground, you know, some scale to weigh your product.

Speaker 2:          13:08          Okay.

Speaker 1:          13:09          I know what I'm talking about, but when I was a kid, all the cool older guys to guys who were like 25 which to me was a man. You had a mustache, you had your own place.

Speaker 2:          13:20          Okay.

Speaker 1:          13:20          It check was living with you and you can fuck her whenever you wanted. You know my id is a 14 year old dude. He lives with her. They can, he can fuck her whenever he wants to not realize it. Not realizing like the fucking that he was probably looking at me, envious of me. Go look at that fucking orange headed, hairless faced fucking loser over there. He's got it all ahead of does it have any credit card bills? It doesn't have some broad living with it. A bitch moaning and complaining about where he leaves his fucking neon green fucking sunglasses. Anyways. But when I was looking at him, they were the coolest people ever. And then there was, there was the Buick Regal, the Monte Carlo and the Oldsmobile cutlass, and they would get these two door coops. And if you got the fucking t top, you know, I loved, I loved the guy that went down to the fucking art, whatever the whatever auto parts store.

Speaker 2:          14:16          Okay,

Speaker 1:          14:16          got the auto zone's eight all up. If you go down there. And I remember people would get their, uh, they put curb finders on them, they'd cut tee tops at them. They get the glass tinted, the fucking headlights and all these cheesy shit. They'd get a custom license plate on the front, said like Mikey, you know, and then you are the fucking mad if you actually get a CD player. And Emma, that was a big thing like you gotta like it was an external thing. I remember this, I knew it. He had a fucking Volkswagen shall Rocco, which looks cute. I swear to God that was the name of the car. Um, and he had this fucking CD player and it was like, it was like an external hard drives. Like you had to plug this cord in that Ben plugged into the CD that was mounted on the armrests between the two bucket seats. And if you even hiccuped in the car, the CD skipped, but it was still fucking is Sayed. And then of course she had to have your radar detector for the fucking state he stowed. And all of that is God. You know it back then. If you got a cold, you put a little Vick's vapor rub on your fucking chest. And that was it. Now what did they cut? Uh, Jesus Christ. At least they could fucking,

Speaker 1:          15:37          they can hold off the HIV virus. Now you'd think that they could fucking, you know, do something about the call. But you always pay a price is always a price to pay. You know, he's always pay, you know, the battered fucking wife of your organs is your fucking liver. And liver always takes it. You know what I mean? You fuck up in other areas and then you take your medicine, right? You're scatterbrain alluded tank can't get to sleep. See, take some Tylenol. PM and who pays for it? Huh? You're fucking liver. Um, how many times are you going to have your liver have to walk around with his eyes looking down at your fucking colon, you know, as the other fucking organs are going, what happened? I walked into the ribs. Is he making light of domestic violence? Yes, I am. Um, I think that's the problem with this country. There needs to be more domestic violence. We actually live in an era that someone wouldn't even look at that even remotely is fucking absurd. And in an era where in fucking, I can't say the word anymore,

Speaker 2:          16:52          okay.

Speaker 1:          16:52          People unlike the, uh, the Internet, we'll just take that clip and they try to get you in trouble. You know what I mean? Everybody's rat and everybody out. Like, you know, I really looked at that fucking Conor McGregor thing, who's that guy? Videotape and at four.

Speaker 2:          17:07          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          17:08          And then he fucking puts it up on the fucking Internet and just get sis guy and all this fucking trouble. I'm not saying Conor McGregor was right, but like, who's this fucking ass? I was there. I would have videotaped that shit. I would just be like, wow, glad I wasn't on that bus. Right.

Speaker 2:          17:23          You know,

Speaker 1:          17:25          I mean, that guy's a reason. Everybody on that bus was making fucking a zillion dollars anyways is any, I can't every once in a while throw a fucking two wheeler and a God damn by me chief. He had the fucking champ, you know?

Speaker 2:          17:41          Okay.

Speaker 1:          17:43          You'll get a little bit of leeway. All it takes is one fucking Douche with his flip phone and all of a sudden he's down there talking to the, I don't want to talking about, guess what today is everybody. Oh, it's gained seven for the Boston Bruins. Um, everybody's freaking out and all this shit. I'm like, God, we have three games to one. Who gives a fuck? How are we going to do is win tonight? Well, you going to do is win tonight and no one fucking remembers so many series than a three to one go to game seven. It happens all the fucking time.

Speaker 2:          18:14          MMM.

Speaker 1:          18:17          I will say though, as a Bruins fan, if I see or didn't have to listen to one more commentator tell me that it was a stretch pass. Okay.

Speaker 2:          18:25          MMM.

Speaker 1:          18:27          You know, and Jesus Christ said, Anderson is played so great for Toronto. I don't know why he does all that, flop it around. You literally skate by that guy when knocks him off his fucking feet. Just shameless, shameless. But, uh, I liked the fucking maple leafs, you know what I mean? Despite the timidly cocky fans on Twitter who said absolutely nothing, and now all of a sudden, you know, they're like mere cats. You know what I mean? What a fucking Cobra comes around and they all sit there lunging at you and shit talking all this shit as a backup. If they're not really going to fight and they try to appear bigger than they are. Um, I got no beef. What's around you guys went tonight. Congratulations. I can get past it. I don't give a fuck. Right. Um, I know that we're a team of the future and so you guys this still probably be the beginning of a great rivalry.

Speaker 1:          19:15          That's what we need. God knows because the Canadians are in the fucking shit. Um, I have his fucking guy that like, I can't remember how fuck I met him. So like a Gig a long time ago and he drove his Sam, somebody got my phone number this fucking con to every year during the playoffs. The brewers do so good. One of those fucking Douche is so I've finally, I just finally blocked his number. Like, I don't, I don't get, I'll get this kid's like, I get it. You fucking drove me to a couple of gigs. I get to listen to your fucking horseshit shit. Every time we're doing bad. There's so many fucking country sports fans like that. Um, and after almost 20 years of voting a cell phone, I finally learned how to block people. I love it. It's fucking love it. It's just like if somebody I used to work with to this business fucking, I dunno what the fuck his deal was, he fucking started calling me and emailing me, you know, block over. You know what I mean? It's like you get to assassinate somebody without having to kill him and deal with the guilt, you know?

Speaker 2:          20:28          Okay.

Speaker 1:          20:29          I wonder if in the future when we're all just being watched by robots and every blessed thing you do is videotaped. Uh, so you can't do anything wrong. I wonder if they'll have to switch the commandments just so they can get somebody in trouble because nobody can do anything anymore. So rather than thou shall not kill the fifth commandment, we'll be, thou shall not block somebody on your cell phone. You shall not assassinate them digitally. I'm sorry, did I just, did I just float out a perfect premise for the next blade runner? Uh, no I didn't. I did not. However, there was that movie that came out where people had to take a test and if you know, when the world was overpopulated, those fucking cards, where the hell did you get that idea? God bless him. But you know what I mean? How about a tip of the cap?

Speaker 1:          21:21          Uh, anyways, sorry. People have just at a fucking, I just had a headache for so fucking long. I did buy some bare aspart I did that. Uh, Celtics. Everybody. How about those Boston Celtics. How about the high or the Boston Celtics? And how about those fucking Milwaukee Bucks? This is the best day Ben, since back with like Sidney Moncrief, you know, then they got that white dude from fucking the Seattle Sonics with that fuck was his name Jack Sigma. Um, but I have to be honest with you dude, the basketball is so fucking awful. Then I'm watching, did I even playing hoop? It looks like a fucking pickup game and an unbelievably high level. How many fucking times can you throw up at three with nobody underneath?

Speaker 2:          22:09          Okay,

Speaker 1:          22:10          let me, I don't understand that new little semicircle there. I got to read up on it in the paint. Is it illegal if you don't have the ball as an offensive player to get under the fucking rim was the last time you saw a center post up and put his hand in the air and do a couple up and under. She got a little Kevin Mchale action. Little Sky Hook. It's all fucking God. You just run down the court a little pass and then the guy just takes a three point. I had 10 go in or somebody does so and one shit to try to get around. A guy dropped a, it's fucking, it's horrible. I think a lot of the entire second quarter, I don't think I saw one pick and roll. You know, there's a reason that they did that for fucking close to 80 years. It works. I dunno why everybody's trying to do this globe trotters shit data. Uh, having said that, I love where we're going in the future. I just don't like the future of the game. I guess people got too big. Is that what it was? Um, I miss the bang and down low in the paint, you know,

Speaker 1:          23:18          and then fucking old school yard play with the guy's leaning against you leave it and you stepped out behind him. Like he pulled his chair out, he falls down. Then they'd stand up and get in each other's grills. The little fucking ref came up to the dicks. Who's trying to push them apart? I miss all of that dumb ass shit, man. I miss the way you smell. Um, I actually got to be honest with you. I shut the game off.

Speaker 2:          23:43          Okay.

Speaker 1:          23:43          Cause I was so fucking mad. Cause I hate NBA hoop. I just hate basketball. I just hate how no lead is safe. It's like you're up by 40, you go with the kitchen and then you make a sandwich and it's like the audit team follow the three pointer. This could tie it up. It's just like, can there ever be, can you ever just have an easy win? Um, I just felt myself getting ready to throw something at the fucking TV and I got a kid now so I can't, so I just shut it off and I was just, and I just watched the score throughout the fourth quarter. Then they wanted, I was like good, uh, uh, more of a hockey guy obviously. Um, that, having said that, I, you know, of course I have to, I've got to edit some shift for emphasis of family tonight.

Speaker 1:          24:32          Um, but I'll get to watch most of the game. It's only a game seven, you know, um, I'm very excited for this. Got To love the game seven. Even if your team was up three to one who gives a fuck gotta love a game. Seven and a, and here's the deal is if we lose the Toronto, that's my team for the rest of the playoffs because they haven't won since 67 and uh, I think it's high time that they get and it'd be cool to see Winnipeg get their first one. So those are my two teams. Those are my onesy. Twosy alright. Uh, so there you go. Did she have fucking Bruins is NBA and Nhl Hay fever. Fucking talk for the God damn week. Oh, you know what? I forgot to fucking mentioned. I started to mention it, but maybe I'll mention it after I, I do a little law.

Speaker 1:          25:24          I got one read for this week. All right, bye. [inaudible] me on Ds me undies. Get in the fucking paint to do dooby ids me undies, throw it down to is tanked.

Speaker 2:          28:11          All right,

Speaker 1:          28:13          so I've tasted twice. Let me see. Liverpool football share. Joel, what do they play next? I was on the plane and I actually watched level Liverpool versus fucking Roma. Eh? It was a shock. It was a blowout. It was an awesome game. Liverpool went up five to fucking nothing. Saturday 4:30 AM I don't I? I just, I just don't fucking get how this shit works. They play in Roma. Isn't that like Rome?

Speaker 2:          28:56          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          28:57          that's the Champions League. Semifinal leg. Two of two.

Speaker 2:          29:03          Okay.

Speaker 1:          29:04          Aggregate two to five. Yeah, they won five to two.

Speaker 2:          29:08          Okay,

Speaker 1:          29:09          so they're going to play again on May 2nd is that because they scored five goals? Enrollments coma score too. What's the coincidence of that? I just don't understand it because they were up five to nothing. And then all of a sudden Roma Roma scored a goal and then they scored another one on a penalty kick and then they would say it. Then the dancers are going nuts.

Speaker 2:          29:29          Okay.

Speaker 1:          29:30          Like what are they? And it's like fucking two minutes left. Why they flipping out like they going to lose this case. I think there were some sort of tournament that happens at the same time that the premiere ship is being played.

Speaker 2:          29:41          It's weird,

Speaker 1:          29:44          but that's the Champions League and I think Liverpool, Chelsea, that's the Premiere Premiere League, right? They do it at the same, somebody from the love of God, somebody over there in Great Britain, somewhere around the fucker world explained to me what's going on. Cause I actually really enjoyed, um, the fucking game to this guy. Holy Shit. This Egyptian dude who kind of look, he looks like an Egyptian Judd Apatow. Most Salah, this fucking guy put on a goddamn clinic. First of all, he used to play for Roma. So he scores a goal and he does his big dramatic. I'm not going to celebrate, you know, which was more annoying than if he just celebrated cassette. He scored again. The first one was like a fight. It was like a lot of it's like hockey but fucking top shelf quarter on the far side, I believe with his left foot. And then a few minutes later whenever he comes back down again and he just, and that wasn't, that was the first one was a fucking blast and the next one's nice, soft touch right up and over the fucking guy.

Speaker 1:          30:54          The goalkeeper I believe for a second goal. Once again, he starts praying, getting on his knees and fucking kissing the ground and doing all this shit. Like he's not going to have a threesome after the fucking game, you know what I mean? Like he's going to go fucking rescue a cat out of a tree. So I like to take your junk out and shake it and the other teams face, you know, you want to, and then he set up, he had two assists, whatever they call the helpers, uh, to fucking crumpets. I don't know what the fuck they call you. Guy had like four points. If he was playing hockey, two goals to assist. It was incredible. Then there was this other poor pass and I think he finally scored a goal. He had a breakaway, fucked that up that he was in one in hockey, what would be called the slot.

Speaker 1:          31:34          And he just fucking miss kicked it, blasted it over the fuck. And that, I think he spent more time on his fucking Mohawk than he did on his fucking learning how to shoot the ball into the Goddamn net. But, uh, there was seven goals. It was like the kind of fucking soccer game that a yank could enjoy it. But, uh, I was stuck on a plane and we had a ridiculous headwind and I was like, I'm going to sit here and watch this fucking thing. And I totally got into it. By the way, Liverpool's fucking, uh, coach. His dentist should be fucking disbarred. He should have his licensed fucking revoked. You know, I'm sure it was the coach's idea. But if you've got to fucking go tan and you don't get your fake teeth whitened to that level, Jesus Christ, he looked like the plant in little shop of horrors except he had glasses on.

Speaker 2:          32:25          Uh,

Speaker 1:          32:29          so anyways, I was really into it, so I guess I get it. Why is it so much time between games though? Oh No. The next one is April 28th. That's it. I'm going to watch. Fuck it. I'm going to support Liverpool. I liked the Beatles. Who gives a fuck, right? Like I got time for this shit. There's no way to watch it and not all of a sudden want to have a fucking beer though. I will tell you that. You know, and I've been fucking Billy. No Fun Billy. No vice other than four hits a weed one night, which I immediately regret it cause all it does is make me sleepy and not trying to become one with the world. I don't get munchies. I just fall asleep like a cat on a fucking window sill. I don't give a fuck where I am. I'm going to sleep. Yep. Um, anyways, let's get on with the questions here. I still have to watch that moto GP. I know that mark mark has one. It uh, when there was a big anticipation that him and a Valentino Rossi, we're going to be fucking donkey kicking each other about fucking 200 kilometers. Uh, but he just fucking blew by everybody by the second turn. Um,

Speaker 1:          33:36          I don't know. I got to watch it though. I fucking love that sport though. Okay. Emails for the week. I might have to, to a little short, uh, podcast here. Everybody looked fucking voices bugging the shit out of me. All right, Belgium. Hey Bill, would you consider to come back to Belgium in 2019 please keep us posted. Uh, absolutely I would. I was only there for like 24 hours and I loved it. I was an ant Twerp I believe. Excuse me. Yeah. Gross. Disgusting. Sorry. It has to be done. It has to be done.

Speaker 1:          34:15          Yeah, got a blow it out. I should have do a kid show sketch about having a cold. You know, you just have some up, but that's always fucking sick. And then the kids can't fucking sell touched the thing cause it's sick. And then you make the firm up at act all sad cause it's lonely. And then when the kids come over because they feel bad for it, he chastised the hell out of them for giving into the weak emotion of love. And you see a yes, set them up for the real world. Uh, fish start a pack. You know what? I downloaded one of those cds here. Harmonies are amazing. Uh, the music, it doesn't quite grab me. They're incredible fucking musician, but they just stayed. There's a, I dunno, there's something I want to keep listening. All right, you're talking about fucking bad. That's sold out Madison Square Garden like 18 nights in a row or something. So it's, it's gotta be me on some level. You know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          35:14          Okay.

Speaker 1:          35:17          I look at fish, the way I look at Beyonce, like it's, it's gotta be me. Right? I have to be the person that's when somebody fills up the fucking Rosewell. You know what I mean? The second they say they're going to be there and you're like, yeah, I don't get it there. Then it's some point. It's you issue, right? I Dunno. Is Billy Bright breathes breaths. I always say when I appreciate, while I appreciated the last fish suggests fish suggested of starting with rift. It's a very specific album. Pretty Ballsy, but that guy who started you with rift, it's as if he wants to make it hard on you. Oh, okay. I like this guy. I liked the other guy too. They thought I was smart. I liked this guy because he knows I'm stupid. All right. Yeah. Make it easy. Read. Give me the answers. You should download hoist. Is that how you say that? As the last guy suggested alive one that'll give you something fun to work with. Again, I love riffs, but I also want you to have a fair shot. Also, story of ghosts is funky and Billy Billy breaths is fun too. Who Was it? Billy breathes. I'm so dumb, and not to sound cliche, but have you seen dead and company yet? It's a really fun show and definitely worth checking out, man. Yeah. Um,

Speaker 2:          36:51          yeah,

Speaker 1:          36:52          those hippy shows to, it's just such a vibe of, of uh, insincerity, Adam that I can't handle from the crowd where everybody's just trying to like, I dunno, you don't think when you see a mom and she's talking to a kid in public and talking really loudly, some cute conversation and looking at you smiling, it's like, will you shut the fuck up? You bring the volume down. I get it. Kids are cute. It's not my kid. You know, I don't care if the kid just countered the five.

Speaker 1:          37:26          No, no. Busy. You have to sit there and you need to put teacher in here First Ota and then they look at you and smile is they do the play by play of the kid putting a fucking marshmallow in its mouth. I feel like when you go to one of those hippie things that people are doing that, but they're kind of doing it, you know, to show like how everybody's, you know, this is like how society should be man. Oh, in the fucking, the body odor. I don't mean like, I mean the Cologne that they wear, whatever the fuck it is, just the, uh, the, the, the fucking Douche Gumbo. That's what I can't handle when I'm there. It's always fucking hot, you know? And everybody's wearing a sun dress. It's just, I dunno, I'm too much of a curmudgeon. Why? I think we bombed Syria.

Speaker 1:          38:15          Oh, good for you. Help me out here. Or bill ball bag. Uh, I believe we blew their chemical weapon plants up because they gassed little kids. Okay. Jess, a guess of what I read. I think you overly simplified and I think some kids also died. Um, but if we're going to start doing that body, if we're going to start bombing people because they gas people are bond people and killed little kids, uh, for everybody who does that as a piece of shit. I don't know how well we come out in the wash, their pal, a chest to cast for what I've read. But you're not allowed to say that. Cause if you do, that means you're an isis. You not allowed to criticize anything. It'd be like, what the fuck are we doing? Uh, but I do understand your fear of debt. Love the cast and your work as unimportant as it may seem. We couldn't live without laughing piece. Okay man, you get your sun dress on there. Um, yeah, okay. I understand that Syria, okay. What they did was horrifically wrong, but you know, should we have a lot more of our ducks in a row before we start policing the fucking world is all I'm saying. You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          39:29          If we're going to fucking bomb those guys, cause they guessed a little kids, that sounds good. But you know, at what point were they going to fucking shoot some missiles at the people who poisoned our food supply, that food supply then that we're now trying to sell around the world and people like, you're not bringing that shit in our country. Do you know this? Say that about our food like France and India. Francis like, all right, but you're going to have to say what's in it? And we're like, no, we're not. We are. There's no way we're going to say what's in our food. I'll fucked up as that. And I got to try to navigate those waters with my kid. You know, and there's no explanation to it. There's no, well, listen man, if you want to somehow make 300 people not starve to death, you got to cut some corners that I understand it, but there's, there's nothing, they're not saying anything. They're like, shut the fuck up and a and eat it. Um, you know, I dunno the key in this world to make it, you got to make so much money. You can donate the politicians' campaigns and then they just fucking leave you alone. And you can do whatever you want. Like poisoned the food supply of a country, which if I'm not mistaking, is a terrorist act.

Speaker 1:          40:43          When you then become an evil doer, uh, dude, I'm fat. This is all shit. And you're not allowed to see if you can say it about anybody else. But if you actually fucking Kev constructive criticism about your own team, you're immediately a conspiracy theorists or you're a socialist. You know, I don't understand. I don't know when the fuck that happened, but it's brilliant PR. Um, so evidently I'm a communist right now. Oh, Bill. Yeah, he's got a red beard. I mean it's all right there. Probably jugs off to Stalin's fucking head shot every morning. How dairy want healthy food for everyone in this country. Uh, Hay Bell, no fun. Hey Billy. No Fun. Love the podcast. I'm a fat guy. Totally agreeing with you. Fat people blame everyone around them, but I'm one that knows that I shouldn't be shoving cheeseburgers down my gullet. Yeah, dude, that's the power fucking choice right there.

Speaker 1:          41:39          If you start blaming everybody else and all this other shit outside, he has to change as you keep fucking Chauhan this shit the, granted I don't have a psychology degree or even know anything about nutrition as I trash what's in our food supply. Uh, you know, you know Kenny Rogers, who was the gambler from the hypocrite. Uh, anyone. Anyway, my question is, do you think it's worse to know that you are ruining your life and eating like a fat fuck or pretending like it's a thyroid problem or some excuse. Anyways, please come to the bay area. I am, I'm doing a whole week. It shows in May up in San Francisco or reno cause I miss you on the last one. Uh, all right. Do you think it's worse to know that you're ruining your life and eating like a fat fuck or pretending like it's a thyroid problem?

Speaker 1:          42:29          I think if you pretend like it's a thyroid problem is a good way to go. If your apps, if you had no power in this situation, like, um, a lot of the shit that I alluded to, you know, like our food supply, like I'm powerless against that. So it's something I will joke about and then I quickly don't think about it because I don't know what to do. What, you know, you go down to a farmer's market and those kinds of infiltrated down there too, when you start asking the fucking hippie down their eggs, so this is blah, blah, blah, where did this come from? And they start getting all fucking shifty themselves and they then all of a sudden you feel like you're an invasion of the body snatchers, you know? So, um, but I think the fact that you're addressing that, you're the ones shoving the cheeseburgers down your gullet. Um,

Speaker 2:          43:13          okay.

Speaker 1:          43:14          I have found that, uh, you know, the longest time I didn't think food was a drug. I totally believe it now. And Dean del Ray put me on this, I guess it's a gluten free diet and I'm all this and I barely have to work out.

Speaker 2:          43:29          Okay.

Speaker 1:          43:29          You know, and uh, Kina Wa is like this fucking like, I eat the food that I eat on this diet afterwards. I don't feel like, ah, I gotta take a nap. I feel like energized even though I feel like shit right now. But, um,

Speaker 2:          43:44          yeah,

Speaker 1:          43:45          I dunno. But I was taking a multivitamin, somebody shit all over that go. It doesn't have enough of this and of that you need to take this. It's just like, okay. All right. All right. So, uh, I think it's, it's

Speaker 2:          43:59          okay.

Speaker 1:          43:59          Well, look, if you're not going to do anything about being a fat fuck, it's going to be more painful. If you're just going to continue to be a fat fucking not do anything about it, then I would lie. That's your thyroid problem. You know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          44:11          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          44:12          MMM. Yeah. That's like if you put out something artistic and uh, it doesn't do well and then you blame the left or the right or some shit like that. Like I've seen with some movies and other shit. You can do that if you want stuck not to help you. Next fucking project. If the project have you a navy training in Australia. Yeah. Jesus Christ. It's the last fucking place I would be in the God damn navy is Australia. Oh my God.

Speaker 2:          44:42          Okay.

Speaker 1:          44:43          What do you have to do to become a fucking navy seal in Australia? You have to stab a great white shark to death after they cut the very make you bleed before you get in the fucking water. Alright. Hey Bill. Just watched.

Speaker 2:          44:57          Okay.

Speaker 1:          44:57          Add voice clip. I think that voice clip of you on Youtube about how you watched the two weeks in health thing. I was in the Australian navy and it was similar, but you got shit for not keeping your own. I don't know what that means. Preface, this was before the media cared about all genders. We had big Bertha,

Speaker 2:          45:20          okay.

Speaker 1:          45:21          Which on the second day of recruit school, we were kept up until 2:00 AM and we're only allowed a breakfast bar. The night before they woke us up by smashing trash cans in each of our dorms right there. I'd be out, I'd be out. I'd be like, dude, fuck this. And I'd walk out. They'd be like, good, you're too weak. And I'd be like, you're right, and I'm going to a Holiday Inn. I want to thank all of you for protecting me in my eight hours sleep. All right. That we had to run downstairs and carry the rope called Big Bertha, which was the equivalent. Oh my God. Of the old ships anchor lines, and we ran for about six kilometers, 3.7 miles. What the fuck? Until we were allowed to have food after that. Anyone that couldn't continue, we were partnered up with and had to carry them and big Bertha shaming the people that couldn't continue. Uh, I couldn't do that.

Speaker 2:          46:18          Okay.

Speaker 1:          46:19          I couldn't do that to where they up on the rope weeping. Do they literally get broken that bed? Every event? Well, when we eventually got back to base, we were allowed breakfast and then had to go on with the eight hour drills and fulfill our duty watches.

Speaker 2:          46:39          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          46:40          Wow. Dude. That is some psychological breakdown right there. Holy Shit. The most fucked up thing about all of this.

Speaker 2:          46:47          Okay.

Speaker 1:          46:47          Hey, wait to, did you make it through all of this?

Speaker 2:          46:51          Okay.

Speaker 1:          46:51          Oh my God. Juvie or ATR difficult. It is to be me. Has your girlfriend ever said that to you when you're thinking about that big Bertha March? Was this, okay? This was in m o two o three and the Australian Defense Force, our military, God forbid we seem aggressive. You say Defense Force had instituted a policy where females could only be treated or ordered for so many hours a day, so handing a dash gas helicopter shoe. So handling. Okay. Helicopter. Sheila was only be performed by men because it caused impotence and women but also men, but females could hold positions on the yeah, but they can also make a baby. They know anybody. We'll fuck himself. Your Dick and your balls are expendable at that point. That's simple math, but females could hold positions on the Hilo refuel team.

Speaker 2:          47:53          Okay,

Speaker 1:          47:54          well that doesn't make sense, but when it came to actually handling fuel, they get volunteer males to do it after dealing with shit like being blamed because my ship couldn't get any new workers from land because the ship was a fucking grinder and being in charge of people when I haven't even been promoted, I decided to just start drinking so much. I got kicked off and it was my best decision ever. This is like a great movie. Spent my last year of my contract at a base in a rich part of Sydney, Australia surfing in the morning and bagging a few of the new female sailors that all over 21 he puts in parentheses that had never been to sea by proudest moment was when I was awarded these humanitarian aid metal because I build hospitals in some Matera after the o five tsunami. I spent days helping and building and the people have so much or was some of the most thankful, kindest people ever met.

Speaker 1:          48:51          What a fucking great story that is. Oh my God. Can you imagine if you quit like how tired you'd have to be, how excrutiatingly tired you have to be to climb up on that rope. It'd be carried back 3.7 miles. I just have to go mentally with every step. This humiliation is one step closer to being over. What do you say when you get off? Good. I make sorry about that. Yeah. Have a fucking, oh my God. I can't imagine what people said to you all the way back. Overrated. Underrated or overrated. New York and Los Angeles. I've lived in both cities for over four years each. I love them, but I've also lived on a creek in Virginia and a farm in Vermont. Lsu need to be in one of those cities. Just don't go there. I that I agree with that whole heart and he should visit him.

Speaker 1:          49:43          A underrated Wayne's world. I never heard you talk about this movie. He should definitely rewatch this. Next time you take a hit man. All right, I'll check it out. I will definitely check it out. Um, I ended it. Overrated. Underrated. Okay. I, well, you know what? Overrated. These new fucking elevators where I got to fucking hit like 20 goddamn buttons to let the elevator know that I'm going to floor four so it can fucking compartmentalize all the people there when I'm the only fucking person there, you know, and I gotta take my key out and fucking run it over the scanner. I liked the old school ones. We just got in. You push the button first fucking 10 years I was on the road. That was, that was the way it was. And I never had that guy from no country for old men blow out the lock on my door, you know, it was completely fine.

Speaker 1:          50:41          I've been one time I stayed in a bed and breakfast in fucking Colorado with this dude from Germany. It was so fucking creepy cause he was walking the halls at night and I was just sitting there in the hall. Light would be on and I was looking at the light and I didn't have a lock of did I think maybe on a skeleton cheat, but I was just sitting there. Oh I just moved with my luggage. I had this ugly ass green like made out of cloth bag cloth and plastic that this guy puked on one side.

Speaker 1:          51:11          Oh my God. Remember that change. Describe it through a lot of shit people. All right, let's tell the chairman would first some fucking, I will tell the puke one. No, you've got to close with the puke. I've already told that story and it's so fucking gross. I've been puked on twice in my life. Once on my head, you know, everybody in my family had gotten sick and we had this bathroom was a half a bathroom with no door. You were around the corner, no privacy whatsoever. We lived in a duplex, squirrels got into the walls. I had to scare them out and then my dad would kill him, you know, was the 70s, eighties, you know, Shit like that happen. So, uh, there was no place to, you couldn't, I couldn't make a Facebook video and Shay, my landlord, you know, or my dad couldn't do that, you know, so you just stopped. She had to kill the fuckers. I remember I had a broken, I was fucking shaking it, try to get this thing to come out. And my dad was on the other side. You have this giant fucking butcher knife or metal bar or something, I can't remember.

Speaker 1:          52:21          And that was a metal bar. That's what it was like a big piece of lettuce or something. Any, flush that thing out and that fucking thing came running up the broom, the broom handle, I remember his eyes were wide is shit. It's tail was straight up in the end. This little brown Cutie Pie fucking ran up my arm in, launched off of my shoulder. I went la and then it ran into the half a bathroom and there was one way in and only one way out, my dad was in the way and he fucking brought that led dig down right on the back of its fucking neck and just slowly killed the three. And I watched him do it.

Speaker 2:          53:01          MMM.

Speaker 1:          53:04          So anyways, what time? We were all fucking sick and I was in there finishing puking in the bathroom with no door. My brother came running in,

Speaker 1:          53:15          just ran and rather than puking in the fucking sink that was readily available. You know, we were young so it was just like you puke in the toilet and my head obstructing the toilet and it was like how low pressure goes to high pressure. It takes the most direct route, which is right through the airfoil. And that's how you get lift when you fly. He used those same principles, would puke it into the toilet. And my head was the airfoil and every fucking puked on my head. And I just freaked out and I was punching him as hard as I could in the stomach as he was continuing to Puke. But parents came in, they were laughing their ass off at bay and the kitchen sink was there and she just fucking dunk my head in there, fucking Washington. It was so gross. So gross. So then the second time I got puked on, I was trying to save money and I was taking a bus from Manhattan to Laguardia Airport. We were almost in my turmoil.

Speaker 2:          54:14          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          54:15          I take the subway up to Harlem and then took the bus over the bridge and this dude just got up, look at all gray.

Speaker 2:          54:23          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          54:23          And he fucking projectile vomited and he hit the sweet old lady in front of me on her chest. It was like the Kennedy assassination, where to spray just went back except it didn't go to the left and went to the right where I was sitting. And it got on my foot, my sock and my lower pants in all over my luggage. And then he just stumbled off the bus and I was like, you mother fucker. And I wanted to beat the shit out of him, but I was broke and I needed the money and I had to go to my gig. I just glared at them as all I could do. And then I had to go in there, got off the bus and now people look at me like I'm an animal because I smelled like fucking puke. And I went into the bathroom like beyond Tourette's. Took the sock off shoe off fucking, but I didn't only had one pair of footwear, so I threw out the size disgusting. Had to wash off my fucking pant leg the best I could. My sneaker was so could fucking wet. I had one sock on, one sock off, walking in a squishy wet fucking sneaker and my fucking

Speaker 2:          55:45          okay.

Speaker 1:          55:45          Green cloth bag. I wiped off all of the Pew, but it was like stayed and they had like the little fucking paper towel balls audit. It was so fucking gross. It was so fucking gross. And I then had to get on like a fucking flight to like Minnesota, just sitting there smelling of stomach acid and I got off the plane.

Speaker 2:          56:13          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          56:15          Yeah. I immediately went to a mall and I bought some sweatpants and the cheapest fucking sneakers and socks and I just fucking the shit out. And I bought a bag. But I didn't have time to do that before, which is about, oh my God, it was a fucking terrible trip on a fucking terrible trip. That was, uh, but you know, it's not as bad as what fucking happened on southwest could have been worse. You know, the poor fucking woman, Jesus Christ. So that's the second time I've heard of somebody gets sucked out like that. He read that fucking story that, uh, it fucking mechanic puts a new windshield on it, on the plane, and the, uh, the used the wrong fucking screws. They weren't long enough and they fucking fly in like, you know, they're cruising altitude, so they gotta be going full 500 miles an hour in the fucking windshield flew off and the captain got sucked out. But his legs got stuck on the yoke and he was outside the fucking plane and they were trying to hold onto them and that the door to the cockpit got blown in and the guy couldn't slow down because it was on the controls. They sub out of the stewardess has helped out, you know when the peer pressure,

Speaker 2:          57:28          okay.

Speaker 1:          57:29          I guess leveled off where they can move and not get sucked out. And they were trying to pull them in and they could, one of the students could see the guy outside the window looking at him and his, he wasn't blinking and she goes, I think he's dead. We should let them go. Fortunately they didn't. They ended up landing. It turned out the guy was in shock.

Speaker 2:          57:47          Okay.

Speaker 1:          57:49          Um, fucking nuts. Just sitting there like catatonic. He got frostbite in one of his eyes. It was just, and this is what kills me is a fucking maniac was flying again in a couple of weeks, but I think he still flies. I can't imagine. You know what the thing is, is what they really should have in the back of the plane is you should also have those shoulder on a, since you should have that, you know, when it goes across your lap and then over your shoulder. So then if you sit next to the fucking window, God forbid, if the fucking thing blows out, you still fine. But that would be prohibitively expensive.

Speaker 2:          58:30          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          58:30          So I guess what I'm saying is get the ILC. All right, everybody, um, go Bruins and, uh, go Celtics. I had a, I dunno, I'm going to go fucking take a hot shower and try to clear my goddamn scientists is, uh, I want to do another podcast tomorrow and I'll be all caught up. All right. Go Fuck Yourself. She can't sit. I'll check it on your tomorrow. Go. Oh, Geez.
