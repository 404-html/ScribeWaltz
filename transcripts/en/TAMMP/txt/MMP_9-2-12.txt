Speaker 1:          00:01:06       When you listen to Spanish radio, right whenever you call it, Latino, Puerto Rican, whatever. He's supposed to a mere Amira. Whenever the fuck you supposed to say, you know, you're just trying to pick up words, right? So all I do now is I just listened to the, uh, you know, am radio of course, you know, white people are on or on FM Latinos and like fucking psycho political people in sports are all on am radio, religious people. You know what I mean? Like if you're just on FM radio and you're going up and down the dial and whatever, like you're living in a completely different universe. If you switch over to am radio, you know, it's, it's a interrupt. You, you can literally listen to like some gaming at Laska and Alaska. You can, next channel is somebody talking about Jesus. And Jesus said to the Episcopalians in John 3.6, you know, then, um, gay people are all going to hell.

Speaker 1:          00:02:18       Whatever the fuck they're talking about, right? And then you get over to the Spanish station and you try to fucking listen. He's supposed to immerse yourself in the language and uh, it's starting to happen. I can actually hear different words. I don't know what the fuck they mean, but it's slowly but surely happening. And I don't know what the fuck they're talking about unless it's like a word, like that's just totally like the English word with like an o at the end. Mouille important though. And you're like very important but always in the end, always in the end when they give out the phone number, I know what they're saying. Oh No. All Chels Santo, Santo Quatro, Cinco, quatro. Today's Uno. Um, anyways, and they see, they see pedal pedal I water. That's now let's get down to brass tacks. This is the Monday morning podcast, Mi Amigos and Mi Amigos. Um, I got a lot of shit going on, you know, you know, it's weird. The last few weeks when I do the podcast, I do it downstairs. My fucking dog looks like it got shot with a tranquilizer gun.

Speaker 2:          00:03:32       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:32       Just fucking lays here mocking. You know, I literally, I feel like I'm bombing because in reality the dog is my only audience and I'm going to take a fucking picture of a right now. You know what, and we're going to upload it. I've never shown you guys a picture. You know what's great about this? You guys have never seen what my dog looks like and now I'm going to send you a picture and all the dog people like, oh my God. Yeah, he's finally got it to it. Where's the thing? You're not going to see her face. It's going to be like people magazine when they used to try to get a picture of it and these to try to get a picture of like Paul Stanley from kiss, you know that yet another horrific group from Detroit. What is wrong with white music from Detroit? They got the black shit down so well, Motown, all those guys right through Marvin Gaye, who I guess was a Motown artists.

Speaker 3:          00:04:25       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:04:26       But Jesus Christ, they're white music other than M and M. Woo.

Speaker 2:          00:04:32       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:04:32       That is a fucking mess out there. Huh? The Bay city royal up rollers. Remember them is this thing about Saturday nights, a little coke spoons hanging around, twist it up in the chest. Hair was not that Gig.

Speaker 3:          00:04:46       MMM.

You know, you should melt all of those people down and then fucking reform them into maybe like a coffee house music. You know, Bill, you've got a lot of fucking nerve man. How many fucking albums you sold? Oh, go fuck yourself. I got a God damn hour to fill here.

Speaker 3:          00:05:23       Okay,

Somebody who was relevant in 99. All right. Have you ever been relevant bill? See that? That's, that's why I like to think that I'm even handed because as I trash other people, I also trash myself. Don't die. Maybe not. Um, anyways, I'll shut off the fucking goddamn camera. You know, I keep playing on my iPhone. I keep playing ice rage. Do you guys play that hockey game? I play at the highest level and I had this motherfucker be like, I just refuse to play any other level at this point other than the hardest level and a at this point I am one and about 260. That's my record. And the only time I won the first time okay.

Speaker 4:          00:06:24       Was Cause I did this bitch move where I got two goals right in the beginning and then one another face off and then just fucking skated with the puck for like a minute, kill on the clock, just skating around. Whoop getting chased by that little motherfucker. Right. So yesterday I'm like, I'm going to beat this dude fair and square and um, singing in sweet home Alabama in the morning. Who downloaded that? I mean, gee, how many fucking hit songs do you got to fucking slam together? And then you get a hit song out of it. It doesn't fucking make any sense. You know, you got the whole, the I woo. Where will the London, you're coming out of the gate with that bomp bomp bomp ball to put the pool ride. Hey, we just swiped a hit song. What do you think? I don't think that's enough. Why don't we swipe another one and we'll put that in the chorus singing, you know, sweet home, Alabama, Sheryl Crow's tits. Um, isn't that what happened? She put a tits in the camera and then they that, do you know what it is? That's, that attic is actually [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:07:36       product of everybody stealing music and there's no music stores. So this is, and I'm, I'm wrong. Maybe I won't kid rock and apology. Like, this is what these, this is the level of fucking hoops this dude has to jump through in, in order to have a fucking hit record. How do you get your music out? That's the amazing thing about lady Gaga, right? The new Queen Queen of the gay community. You know, they always loved checks like that, who played like dress up and wear crazy hats, you know, pulled down over there, beat noses. I don't know what it is, but gay people, they can't get enough of chicks like that. Right?

Speaker 1:          00:08:18       But I was sitting there looking at lady Gaga going, what the fuck is she doing? And now, now I get it. There's no, there's no audio. That's another Spanish word for you. It's not radio. You just roll the out of audio sake. Now I'm speaking Spanish, now I'm back to English. That can me, ah, I'm fucking crossing you over in a verbal way. Breaking your fucking ankles. Um, I'm such a Douche this week. All right? So don't even send me emails about what a Douche I am because I'm completely aware of it. Okay? I don't know if that makes me more of a Douche or more tolerable, but I'm just letting you know where it's at. We didn't even move,

Speaker 4:          00:08:56       didn't even fucking move. And I get her to move all that goes. Do you want to, and then it goes to tail. Cleo, do you wanna fucking dogs like, yeah, I want to, I don't have a fucking driver's license. I can't open the front door.

Speaker 2:          00:09:13       You know,

Speaker 4:          00:09:15       maybe my dog isn't happy. Maybe it's fucking depressed and, Hey, what's the point man? I'm going to do is walk in another room with nothing to do. It's going to lay here all day. Um, the fuck was I talking about? I was on a nice roll there. Oh yeah. There's no fucking way. There's no radio. There's no Fuckin, MTV doesn't play videos anymore. Nobody buys your music. How the fuck do you get your music out there? You got to put on a meat dress. So then all that guy, that guy there with his little sippy cup on that Paparazzi show, we'll be out. They'll just say list, but eyes. Yeah, lot of flood. Good mate. Ah, ah. It's not maker the shelf. Um, anyways, people, you know what, I'm going to start actually a am I gonna use audible.com/bill. She can I use it audible.com/bill can I go use that and then fucking

Speaker 4:          00:10:08       what books would I get? You know why when I, when I used to read when I was 27 and I thought I was going to be smart, I started reading books thinking it would make me more likely to get a blow job bought. It never fucking happened. Um, because I looked like Ron Howard when I was 27. Um, so anyways, now I'm 44. Um, if I was going to have a books read to me, I would do that. The Irvine Welsh series, you know, cause I'm a big fan of that. That fucking, what is it? Cockney accent. Fucking Irish spring. Let me cut into some soap with a, with a shank accent. And there was a bunch of words in there that I kind of figured out cause he literally writes it how they say it.

Speaker 2:          00:11:02       Huh.

Speaker 4:          00:11:04       And uh, maybe if I, you know, I wonder if they actually have like somebody you know who's, if you're going to do the urban Welsh series of books on audible.com/bill trying to fill my contractual obligations with these people. I'm trying to say it as many times as humans, but I actually like these guys, you know, considering there's no more, there's no more bookstores anymore. These guys are actually picking up the slack.

Speaker 2:          00:11:29       Right?

Speaker 4:          00:11:30       I like audible.com/bill. You know what? I don't like I, I'm, I'm not doing the pro flowers thing anymore. Okay. I like those guys, but I like them on Valentine's Day and mother's Day. Other than that, I can't sit here with any sort of good conscience and trying to sell you guys flowers in the beginning of fucking September. What do you get? Somebody flowers for fucking Labor Day. You know, unless you accidentally

Speaker 1:          00:11:53       ran over somebody foot on September 1st, there's no fucking reason to get anybody some flowers. Well, what if they have a date? Oh go fuck yourself. You know, then I got to fill out all this bullshit to, to get fucking $17. It's not even worth it to me. All right, so pro flowers, if you're listening, I will see you in February. Um, anyone face this is like reverse good business. So anyways, what the fuck am I talking about? Did Anybody Watch any college football? How great is it that football's back? Anybody gets suckered into that Michigan, Alabama game like I did, I had the fucking fellows over. You know, my woman, my piece of property is, um, she killed me if I ever said that is fucking, uh, she's out of town. So what am I going to do? There's only two options. Either I get some hookers and I cheat on her or I have the fellows come over and I fucking get hammered.

Speaker 1:          00:12:58       I chose the louder they give me. I'm still fucking bitch. Can't drink like I used to man. I picked up a cigar habit, you know. Anyways, so yeah, number eight, Michigan for his fucking number to Alabama. And in my head I'm going, why is Michigan Number Eight? How are they number rate? They sucked last year. What happened? Who did they get did, did a couple of fucking beast from Penn state, you know, but you'll even then you're only allowed to sign one. What the fuck happened? How were these guys number rate and about, I dunno when Alabama was up like 21 nothing or something like right in the beginning of the second quarter, that's when I figured it out. Oh, they weren't number rate. They just made them number rate. So I would tune in and invite my fucking friends over like an asshole. We watched like seven minutes of that game and then that was it. We were downstairs fucking hanging out at the grill. You know, I took out my climbing rope cause everybody, oh, you climb a rope, I can fucking do that. Then people are drunk trying to go up and down the rope, you know, back in the day, that would be funny to me and all in all, I'm thinking in my head the whole time is somebody is going to fall and they're going to break their hip and then I'm going to get sued. All right? And that's what it means to become old.

Speaker 2:          00:14:16       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:17       You know, when you're young, when your friends fall down, you could just laugh when you're old. There's some, there's somebody has to pay for it. There's a liability. Oh Jesus. Why didn't I bet that game? Maybe they do. Do I just know it because now the game is over. But if ever there was a fucking lay up, everybody [inaudible] he's so fucking, he's fucking sec fast. And now he's playing an SEC team. Okay. Which means you regular fucker. He just became another fucking quarterback and that was it. He actually made a couple of nice throws. But uh, I don't know. I don't know a bunch of fucking people all in that Goddamn stadium.

Speaker 2:          00:15:06       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:15:07       Who honestly, who the fuck would buy flowers in September? You know what I mean? Why are we selling flowers? That's that corporate mentality. You, why don't you just make all your money on fucking Valentine's Day and then you make the varsity of money, the back end, the back nine you make on mother's Day and you call it a year and go sit on your fucking boat. You know what? What if? What if we just created this need for flowers 12 months out of the year? What if you just left him in the ground and you let them continue to produce oxygen for us? Why don't you do that instead of ripping them out of fucking ground every goddamn day. Now, oh Jesus, I am on a fucking tear here. Um, you know what it is? No, Bill, what is it? I am a, I'm getting geared up. I'm doing six straight fucking weeks on the road. Six straight. Well, my, my year is basically over. Summer's over. The summer is over. I'm going on the road. I'm and to you with Dick Jokes and a clothes and shit joke. And that's it for you.

Speaker 2:          00:16:18       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:16:18       By the time you realize you got fucked over, I'll have your money in my wallet. Bottle. Bottle, bottle, baby. I'm fucking doin. I'm fucking doing the white trash tour. What do you mean by the white trash? The white trash tour. Listen to the cities that I am going to this week. I'm going to be on Orlando, Florida. Okay. And unless you have kids and you want to go visit a giant fucking mouse with a struggling actor inside of it, there's no fucking reason to go there. If you're some whore and you want to go blow tiger woods, I guess that's another reason to go there. I don't know why else would you go to Orlando to buy some bait? You know? So I'm going there first and then next week I'm going to be in Charlotte, Charlotte, North Carolina, east bound to Dachau and load it up and trucking. We didn't realize the civil war head and it, um, I'm going there. Do you want? Or the comedy zone and uh, then I go to New York City. Oh, I'm standing next to a bunch of shit. That must mean I'm successful too. Right? Let's get a slice. I'm going there

Speaker 1:          00:17:38       and then the week after that I go to Jacksonville, Florida. This is how bad Jacksonville is. People in Jacksonville go to Orlando to vacation. All right.

Speaker 2:          00:17:54       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:55       Jacksonville, Jacksonville is another one of those cities that if it started to, if there was a flood, you know, you think you had it bad in New Orleans. If, if Jacksonville literally fell into the sea, I think it would take at least, I would say 36 hours before like that. Lighten that news actually hit the national airwaves. You know, 36 hours after an entire metropolis fell into the ocean, somebody would finally come on TV, be like, uh, we have a developing story, something going on in Jacksonville, Florida. Is that in the south? Eastern. Northeastern. Thank you. Thank you. Robert. The northeastern part of the state, like no one even fucking know what goes on in Jacksonville. You had a USFL team back in the day. Right? The Florida gators and the fucking Georgia bulldogs play there once a year. Everybody comes to town, they drink their beer and they fuck you. Women, you know, and they drive out and then that's, it becomes quiet again. A couple of tumbleweeds blow across, you know, you got the Jaguar. That's actually pretty amazing, you know, for a city to get a professional franchise when they have no other professional franchises. Like his late in the game is Jacksonville got a fucking team. You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:19:20       Like take a, let's say Portland, Portland, Oregon. They got a basketball team. I could see them maybe getting a baseball team, you know, I had to get a basketball team. They showing up for that. Let's fucking try this. Right? Jacksonville had nothing. Nada, zero, Zilch. They had nothing. The Florida gators and Georgia bulldogs play there because it's some neutral shit in the middle of fucking nowhere. It's like a musical, you know what I mean? Like when they have like a, the two gangs are going to fight before they do. They're going to walk in a circle, snapping their fingers. Right. This stupid fucking jeans rolled up for some unknown reason other than probably the sexuality of most of the guys in the play.

Speaker 1:          00:20:11       Good. How tough guys it. Um, anyways, so that's what I'm doing. And then after that I go to Cincinnati, Ohio and Cincinnati, Ohio. That's one of those Zombie cities is all these great hardworking people right up until four 59 in the afternoon in right at five. It's like the Fred Flintstone. They all slide down the brontosaurs getting a God damn cars and they vacate the city and then all that is left is drug addicts, unbelievably poor people. And the comedian working at the club walking, that's what's walking down the if five oh one as the sun starts to go down, you know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          00:20:51       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20:52       You started, you know, it's probably the same feeling like you know that Zebra has and that that split second where in his, his peripheral, whenever the whole herd scattered and you don't know why, and you start to feel the breadth of an alligator and you're like, fuck, I guess it's me today, right. Jesus. Bill is Cincinnati that bad? You know what? Go visit it. Go visit it. I did. I even mention any dates. Jesus. What the fuck? What kind of ways that to sell a Goddamn tour. That was like reverse rock singer right there. We're fucking rock singers would go out there and be like, let me tell you, he stopped in Jacksonville.

Speaker 5:          00:21:39       We've done a lot of cities on his door, but I've got to tell you, and I think the fellows by me will agree. We need carbs to crowds,

Speaker 1:          00:21:48       right? Just fucking jerking him off. The reason why I'm excited to go to these cities, I just want to see what the fuck people do in these cities. I've already been to our land. Oh, I know what that, that's just a bunch of fucking strip malls. Those Adobe structures. You know the excitement out there. You want to go to five guys, burgers and fries. You want to go down there, you my name, and they make the base Goddamn burgers. You know, they probably all look down on Disney world, you know, bunch of fucking posers. Like that's how you like you were a rebel in Orlando. Has You trashed Disney world?

Speaker 2:          00:22:26       You know?

Speaker 1:          00:22:29       I don't know why. Why would you continue this way? You know what it is. It's not going to be the shows. It's not going to be the people that come up to me after the shows and say something mildly racist. You know? It's not going to be that. It's, it's going to be the getting on and getting off of fucking airplanes out. Jesus. This is like the Tampon fucking menstrual cramp fucking podcast right now. We shouldn't. I feel lucky that I have this amount of work. You know when all those glass workers got laid off recently out there in Dayton, Ohio, then they just closed down the glass factory. Do you know they're not going to make glasses in this country anymore? Anywhere are all gonna be made in the Philippines? I saw the whole thing on 60 minutes. Did you guys watch the last episode of breaking bad? Did anybody see it as a bunch of fucking psychos right now covering their ears? I, I can't recommend that show enough and it's not cause old twinkle toes got an a couple of episodes here. It's just, it's the most unbelievable fucking show I've ever seen.

Speaker 1:          00:23:37       They just keep, they just keep twisting it tighter and tighter and tighter

Speaker 4:          00:23:46       and every time you think you can breathe, you know, cause some problem got fucking solved. Something else comes along and it's even fucking worse.

Speaker 2:          00:23:56       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:23:57       Unreal. I'm not gonna say anything that happened. I probably shouldn't even brought it up cause this is probably half the fucking people listen to this. Aren't even listening right now for fear that you know I was going to give away something from the show. Um, I'm not going to do that. All right. This is the Monday morning podcast. Everybody, if you're new to this show,

Speaker 4:          00:24:20       um, welcome. Welcome aboard. If you live in any of the cities I just trashed. Uh, I stand by that. That wasn't a joke. Now I know when I, I know what I'm going to do in Charlotte. Charlotte, I'm going to go visit a street side customs. I'm going to go check out the old cars there. That's what I'm going to do. Their New York City. Come on New York. I'll be fine. Orlando, I have no idea what the fuck I'm going to do. I tried to find some college football, I something, I don't know what I'm going to do. I think I'm going to walk from the air condition comedy Condo to the club and then go back. But I'm actually excited to be there cause I've never done that one. Let, let, let's, let's try to put a little positive shine on this fucking white trash tour here and a Jacksonville. Um, there's gotta be some redneck shit going on. There's gotta be some sort of rattlesnake roundup, you know, some sort of gun show,

Speaker 4:          00:25:18       you know, two rednecks with their trucks chained together, trying to drive in different directions. Whoever ends up with the other guys, differential wins, you know, can I go to something like that as if fucking something for me to do there. But actually, when I'm in Charlotte, I'm going to go to the panthers game, Carolina Panthers Game, and when I'm in Jacksonville, I'm going to go to a fucking Jaguar's game. And when I go to Cincinnati, I'm going, oh, bangles games. See that? That's how I do the fucking road. That's how, that's how I do it. Pointing at himself with a thump. Um, all right, here we go. Let's, let's get, let's get this shot. Let's get some stuff out of the way here. He voice everybody. This is like, this has taken off like wildfire. You know that Cleo,

Speaker 2:          00:25:59       okay.

Speaker 4:          00:26:00       I know you're just laying there with not a fucking excited bone in your body, but I'm telling you, he voice, he voice is a, is, is, is killing it. And you're probably saying eight belt. What is, uh, what does the voice, he voices basically your mobile phone at work. Okay. You can get all kinds of different phone numbers. Uh Oh. I always forget the word virtual virtual phone numbers. Like when it'd be great if you could give some guys some guy coming up to you and he wants to buy your widgets, right? And you want to give him your phone number, but you don't want to give me your real phone number, right? But you don't want to have 20 cell phones. All right? With he voice. You can have a whole bunch of different phone numbers all ring on your cell phone, but nobody really knows your number.

Speaker 4:          00:26:44       All they know is those other ones. Right? Did that make sense? Did I just get lost in the math of that? Um, it basically, it creates a way that you can actually make it seem like you have an office building in the beginning when you're really don't, they got music on hold. They have professional voiceover people to be like, oh, La don the s lay something or other, right? Whatever English accent, whatever you want, they're going to make you sound professional. Like this is probably the best way that I can think if you're starting off a business or if you already have them. But if you're starting a business, taking that crucial step to get yourself out of that cubicle and make your dreams come true today is to, is to get the, you got to have some sort of infrastructure going. Okay, but that costs money.

Speaker 4:          00:27:30       You know what I mean? Usually it costs you a bunch of money, but with he voice, it's not going to cost you a bunch of money. You just sign up for this stuff and you're good to go. Uh, one of the great features is music on hold makes your business seem more professional is the voice.

Speaker 4:          00:30:17       Hey, you know what? I want to buy a pegboard hanging ended up on my garage and basically start my own little gym here. It's all body weight. I got a climbing rope, I got a dip station, pull up thing and then I get that peg board right? And I go, I'll and be able to go up and down it with my skinny little legs hanging off it. Cause I'm not doing any squats you don't really want to do is a buddy of mine was telling me a on Joe Rogan's podcast. He's got this hope, uh, those kettle bell workout. I heard his listeners are going nuts. Getting all Jack doing that. I want to do it. So if anybody knows what podcast of Rogan's, I got to listen to, um, where he basically breaks it down and then I'll do my cheap ass version of it when I'm on the road by basically going out and buying two grapefruits and putting them in plastic bags. Well, tourists to say principals, um, advice. Uh, right. Bill Boehner problems. Oh Jesus Christ. Here we go. Dear Bill, I'm approaching my 27th birthday and in the past couple of weeks I've had some issues with getting erect. Ugh. All right. All right, well I'll, Jesus. Okay, here we go. Instead of getting wood, having sex or looking at porn, I now have to fiddle with myself just to get hard. I don't know if this is due to mild do this is so fucking beyond.

Speaker 2:          00:31:37       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:31:37       This is a doctor drew question. All right, so don't listen to me, but I got to make this funny dude. All right, so fast forward this cause I don't want to add to your psychological problems. Um, I dunno if this is due to mild depression caused by stress being overweight or I'm just getting old and this is how I'm going to be. I am overweight, but since April, I've been steadily losing weight and exercise and good for you. I do have mild depression. I know where you're coming from. I got it too. And I've had bouts of erectile dysfunction in the past, but they usually don't last more than a few days. Um, yeah, I don't know what to tell you. I would say don't rub one out for a couple of days, you know, and then stand on your back porch with the junk hanging out. And I imagine the first time the wind blows, I think you'll be in the game. That's my advice. And it's off to Chicago and let's win there.

Speaker 4:          00:32:31       Yeah. I don't know what to tell you, dude. Like I would, I would seek some sort of professional help. See if you've got a circulation problem. Um, but I think the biggest thing you're doing, which is great as you're losing weight because a, you know, eat too many fucking Cinnabons. It clogs up the plumbing. And I know that because I don't have a medical degree. I'm ignoring girlfriends past bill. I am an Aussie with the beautiful girlfriend out. Speaking of Australians, I'm going to Sydney in, uh, in October. You see what I just did there? This guy's, you know, actually he basically started a conversation with, with me and I just interrupted them and being that do shit the party right now. But I actually, you guys have seen, did you see that video where the fucking little Aussie bullies punching the fat headed fucking kid who I like outweighs them by 80 pounds and finally the, the, the kid getting bullied just can't take it anymore.

Speaker 4:          00:33:26       And he just picks this kid up and I can't even like lifts him up basically a little above his head. And if you just dropped him there, that would have been amazing. But he liked fucking, it was like he was ringing out a mat is how he threw this kid down to the fucking ground, like shaking out a beach towel, except it was this kid's rag doll body like his, the kid's whole body did the fucking warm, except when he came back, he'd just from like six feet in the air and he slammed this kid on the ground. I couldn't believe this kid's legs still worked. It was fucking awesome. But now they got like, they have like, it's become this entire like mini series. They interviewed the kid who got bullied and then they interviewed the kid who did the bullying and the funny, the bullies crying and he's trying to say that the fatty fucking was hitting him first, which is total bullshit because if you look at the fat kid, which I really shouldn't be saying, but you know, I'm just trying to, you know, I only have so many minutes here in the podcast, the Husky Kid, the fucking kid punches him in the face and he just stands there with his hands down to his side.

Speaker 4:          00:34:33       He could tell, you know, if he was walking around hitting people, his whole body language, but in a different, I didn't believe that the little mosquito looking kid. But um, and then so the interview, both of them and then they have the two of them interviewing each other. And I gotta tell you, I don't think I've ever laughed so fucking hard in my entire life. Not because I think it's right or I think it's funny. I just fucking this just something about it. It just took me back to my childhood. Just how fucking mean kids are.

Speaker 4:          00:35:06       Maybe like what, what, what was it like, what was it like when, when, when, when you went to skill, like what was some of, what was some of the things the kids used to call you? I know this is a brutal fucking Aussie accent. Um, he'd be like, well, you know, they call me, they call me fatty and, and with every mean name, I'm laughing my ass off. It literally gets to the point where the kids said he was suicidal and I've been through all of that. I've been through all of it and I actually sat there laughing my ass off watching it and I'm asking you guys, why am I laughing? I don't find it funny. I feel bad for the kid, but with the main, or the detail is the harder I fucking left. I don't know if that, I don't know if that's like some sort of like a fallout from trauma. We're after a while you just like, it's just becomes funny. There's like nothing. What else are you going to do?

Speaker 2:          00:36:08       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:36:08       Like, I remember like every fucking movie I go to see, I know I've told these stories a zillion times, but this, this actually fits in it. Like I'm a one, I saw sling blade.

Speaker 2:          00:36:19       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:36:19       And when that country singer Dwight Yoakam, when he's zoomed, the guy in the wheelchair out of the house, why don't you go home and practice Randy and he get the fuck out of my house and he fucking zone that can the wheelchair and the guy in the wheelchair like it did like the whiplash thing and went through the front door, like the people who are watching the movie around where either quiet or gasping and I was roaring laughing and not that. I think that's like it's, do you know what I mean? Like it's, it's so wrong. It's funny. Ah, I'm probably coming off like a maniac. I did that one time. We were flying over to fucking one of those magical kingdoms over there in Europe where they got a Starbucks next to a fucking castle, you know? And uh,

Speaker 2:          00:37:11       okay.

Speaker 4:          00:37:11       I was sitting in the aisle, neos in the middle seat and then there was some girl on the window and uh, yes, I was flying coach, um, to go do the funny bone in fucking Afghanistan and uh,

Speaker 2:          00:37:26       okay.

Speaker 4:          00:37:27       I was watching a movie on a laptop and I was laughing so hard at one point I was fucking wheezing and it was one of those deals where I'm laughing so hard. People around me are laughing just at how hard I'm lat. Like the girl on the window was laughing at how hard I was laughing and I was laughing so hard that I woke me up and Nia woke up and immediately was like laughing, like, what the fuck are you laughing at? And then she leaned over, you know, cause you can't see in the computer screen. She leaned over and saw that I was watching the precious and um, you know, she starts punching me in the arm, which made it even funnier. And then the girl by the window found it even funnier.

Speaker 2:          00:38:06       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:38:07       I totally got lost in that fucking story. I don't know what point I'm trying to make. Like, I'm trying to ask you, why do I find shit like that? Hilarious. You know, like whenever I watched the biggest loser and they'll be like, you know, so how do you feel about yourself, your, your fucking Zeppelin, you, you know, and the guy will be like, well, you know, I have my good days and I have my bad days. And uh, then his voice cracks and it's fucking forehead wrinkles up and he just starts fucking crying like a baby. I, I, I can't, I don't, I fucking laugh.

Speaker 2:          00:38:40       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:38:40       I laughed. Like I'm watching stripes, intervention,

Speaker 3:          00:38:47       you know,

Speaker 4:          00:38:48       intervention. When the family starts reading their letters of pain to the fucking degenerate drug addict and a, they start fucking crying. I immediately, I just start roaring laughing.

Speaker 2:          00:39:03       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:39:03       Like it's funny, like I get more laughs out of that than if I was watching one of those sitcoms with the good looking people in the couch.

Speaker 4:          00:39:12       I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. Um, anyways, let's get on with the podcast here. Oh, Australia, the Australia Guy, right. Um, if anybody knows what that is, if there's actually anybody with any steel, what? Look, I was just gonna say if there's some sort of psychologists listening to the shit as if I deserve professional opinion. After you guys listened to my fucking moron opinion every week, whatever, if you're a plumber, I'd like to hear what you think. All right. Ignoring girlfriends. Uh, pass bill. I'm an Aussie with a beautiful girlfriend. How the hell do I stop picturing her getting nailed by guys. She's dated before me. I'm torturing myself with these thoughts. We have great sex and everything. Yeah. Oh yeah. How do you think she got that way? Do you use the dice clay line from banging all those other people, sir? Um, from what I understand, it's something no one likes to think about it. Dude, I'm just breaking your balls.

Speaker 3:          00:40:07       All right. Look,

Speaker 4:          00:40:10       if you love this girl, you just got to get past the fact that she sucked other the Dicks,

Speaker 3:          00:40:18       you know,

Speaker 4:          00:40:20       probably enjoyed it. Nah, I'm just fucking with you now. Um, that was mean. How do you get past it? Um,

Speaker 2:          00:40:30       yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:40:31       I never think about it. I just look at, I look at women like, uh, you just picked up a fucking free agent that's got, you know, good fucking career stats here that shows that they can get the job done. You know, they can perform an October. You know what I mean? Just look at it like that way. It's like the Dodgers just picking up all those red sox. They got Gonzales. You don't, you think that they cared that he fucking was playing baseball and some other towns, they don't give a fuck. Just come in here and get the God damn job done so we can win the championship. That's how he got to look at it. All right. If she shows up and she's clean, she doesn't have any good. What about you sir?

Speaker 2:          00:41:10       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:41:10       Next time she's fucking blow in. You thinking about, think about all the fucking trolls at the truck stop that you left put, put their mouths on you and now she's down there.

Speaker 3:          00:41:21       You know,

Speaker 4:          00:41:22       there's not enough shampoo and conditioner to clean your Dick. Pass a certain fucking age, and that's the God damn truth. And you don't say anything about it.

Speaker 3:          00:41:30       That right

Speaker 1:          00:41:33       as you put it inside of her, give me a fucking break. All right, Sarah. It is what it is. She's banged other people. You're going to have to get facet and uh, I can guarantee you this.

Speaker 2:          00:41:47       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:41:48       She probably hasn't been with remotely the amount of people that you have, not to mention some of the fucking complete tramps that, uh, you know what I mean? I like to think that women are a little more, uh, have a little more discretion and my issues with women right now, it just kills me that I'm saying something pro female because I know they're all fucking nodding. I AskPat um, yeah, this is one way or the other. They're either really discretionary or they're just fucking womping horse. And that was a generalization. I apologize. Um, friends, unholy wedding.

Speaker 1:          00:42:28       Oh Dude, I was doing so great on this fucking podcast. I don't know. It's somewhere I lost the fucking momentum. I lost my Mojo when I was talking about why I laugh, you know, at people with the fucking crutches falling down a flight of stairs. I don't know why I got into that. A friend's unholy wedding bill. I got a problem that I don't think I can go to go to my friends with. A friend of mine is getting married. I've been good friends with the guy since we were five years old and we are now 23. He's getting married about a year from now. He has selected me to be the groomsmen. Alright. I'm guessing either you fucked his wife, future wife, or she's banged, you know, 70 people or as fucking around on him. That's what I'm guessing. Um, or she's into the devil. One of the other. This has to be white. This is an unholy wedding. All right? He's getting married about a year from now. Good. You got time. He, he is a selected, sorry. I need to just was calling him. She's going to kill me. He's calling from another fucking country and I just shut it off because I had to pee. I gotta finish this fucking podcast. He putting the podcast enemy. Yes. Uh, he's getting married about a year from now. He has selected me to be a groomsman. This means I have to pay for a flight to attend the wedding. Furthermore, his bachelor parties being huge sheet. Motherfucker. This is what it's going to be about money.

Speaker 1:          00:43:56       All right. This me, I fucking hate. Oh, hang on a second. The lovely Nia. Everybody.

Speaker 2:          00:44:03       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:44:04       Nia. Hey listen, I'm doing the podcast. Can I call you right back?

Speaker 2:          00:44:13       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:44:14       Say hello to the podcast listeners. Tally Ho I'll talk to you later. See that she had a fucking hard day and I'm not there for what? A piece of shit. All right, let's get back to Tightwad here and I have to buy a Tuxedo.

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       You know, uh, a rent one. Ah, this means I have to pay for a flight to attend the wedding. Furthermore, his bachelor parties being held in Las Vegas and I would also have to pay for this light as well as other expenses of a bachelor party. Normally this wouldn't be an issue. I'm a college student and saving the approximately a thousand dollars, this would cost, would be, uh, would be stressful, but it would be worth it to see one of my greatest friends get married. Okay, so you're not a cheap fuck you just having money prompts. However, my friend has often lied to and cheated on his fiance. Oh,

Speaker 2:          00:45:03       okay.

Speaker 4:          00:45:04       I didn't see that one common. Why didn't, I guess that. There you go. There's a whole new fucking Jesus. I'm not judging him. I, Tricia, I disapprove of how we treat. So this guy is actually a good shit and I actually called them peace of God ever. I judge you on your first couple of sentences. What are you gonna do? He goes, I disapprove of how we treat sir, but I don't get myself involved. He sleeps around and hides from her. The fact that he smokes pot and drinks heavily on a daily basis. I don't know how she hasn't noticed. She's probably because she's a sweetheart.

Speaker 2:          00:45:40       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:45:41       Sweethearts always end up with fucking dicks like this. She's never smoked or cheated. Uh, as far as, you know, I don't understand why he doesn't find a different relationship, but again, I don't get myself involved. The problem is I can't imagine this marriage will last very long and I don't want to pay $1,000 for a sham marriage at a time when $1,000 is like the lottery to me. I'm actually offended. These asked me to do all of this for the wedding and thus spend all this money. I could not imagine asking any of my friends to throw away that much money on something I didn't give a fuck about. Should I decline to attend the wedding? Any advice would be appreciated. Uh, I dunno if I can go to our other friends with this one. Um, all right. This as always as a million different ways you can play this. There's two options, three options. All right? One, you just fucking bite your tongue and you just go to the goddamn whiting and think that all right. Even though it's gonna fucking blow up, maybe he'll learn something from it. And then, uh, you know, by the time he's 30, he'll grow up. And you guys can actually be friends again too.

Speaker 4:          00:47:00       You fucking did I say there was three. I already forgot the other ones. So we, there's only gonna be two here. Oh, I'm the why do you guys listen to this? You know, you know why? Cause it makes you feel better, doesn't it? It should. Good. No, I, I feel like I'm serving a purpose now. Um, just sit the guy down. It'd be like, dude, can I ask a question? Yeah, sure. Matthew, what's up? What the fuck are you doing? What do you, what do you, what do, what do you mean what

Speaker 1:          00:47:29       am I doing? I mean what the why are you getting married? Cause I love her anyway. What is this going dude, you're fucking everything that moves. I walked slower when I'm around you. That's how much shit that you fucking do. You understand me? Do you understand where I'm coming from and you're asking me to go out. She doesn't know you beaus she doesn't know that you smoke weed.

Speaker 2:          00:47:52       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:47:52       You know I, this is 1000 bucks. If you were actually, you know, this is like me flying to go see the fucking, I don't know, go see it. The Padres versus the fucking Colorado Rockies. What is the fucking point, you know? Yeah. You're, you're a piece of shit. This marriage isn't going to last and what's worse is you're doing in front of me and then I got to sit there and have a conversation. You know, I got to figure out what part of a face I'm going to look at cause I can't look at her in the eye. You dragging me into it.

Speaker 4:          00:48:32       Oh Jesus. This bad advice. I mean you've got to have, I at least don't say it that way. Just be like, listen, I don't have $1,000. I just don't have it to go to the marriage. And then they had to go to the wedding, start with that. And then if he gives you shit, just say, oh that's your other option. Just say, listen, I just don't have the money. And you bite your tongue and you look the other way so you don't see them. The train wreck that's going to happen. That's the option. Or you can just come clean and just say, listen dude, I love you to death. Yeah, my buddy. But what you're doing here, this is wrong. All right? You're not being fair to her. You're not being fair to me, ed. Yeah, you're fucking, you're screwing yourself in the long run.

Speaker 2:          00:49:18       So

Speaker 4:          00:49:21       this is what you want to do. Go do it. But I don't want to be a part of it. All right.

Speaker 2:          00:49:28       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:49:28       Yeah. So my guess is a, your best fucking option as far as like the least amount of drama is to, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:49:39       and mental trauma for yourself is to do the one, I threw it there in the middle. We just say, listen, I just don't have the money.

Speaker 6:          00:49:47       Do Acute believe I'm supposed to be you, bro. Bro, it's my wedding dude.

Speaker 1:          00:49:55       I can't believe, dude, I can't believe you're fucking everything that moves and you fucking smoke weed. You booze every day and this girl doesn't even know how about that. And you're acting like you're not doing it even at a fucking me and you expect me to stay on there. Do you understand that? You understand that? I realize that you're fucking everything that moves right now and you're going to go marry this girl and I'm have to sit there and watch you toast this girl. I love you. You're the, uh, the, the blood that pumps through my heart. That bullshit. I got to sit there staring at my fucking Lasagna. You know there's going to be lasagna. Anytime you got to cook for more than fucking 10 people, they just make a big tray of that shit. We have a meet days. We have a vegetarian. Is that big fucking silver tray?

Speaker 2:          00:50:35       All right.

Speaker 1:          00:50:37       Is the last one off. This is a short podcast. 50 minutes. Satan, this person says, Bill, if Satan punishes the bad, doesn't that make him good? And that's from a lady. Um, yeah, I don't get the math on that. Like most things when it comes to religion, it doesn't, it doesn't add up. It's like Satan was in heaven. Right? How the fuck does it go? Isn't it? What an iron maiden song. Can I just go listen to like die with your boots on and then I'll know how this story goes. Like I fuck or Judas priest,

Speaker 2:          00:51:22       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:51:23       point of entry are screaming for vengeance, don't they have a song about it? Whatever St was basically, you know, he was like the Zildjian brothers before they had a fight and then one broke off and created Sabian. Right. How about something a little more mainstream? It was like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs. Right. When they will have been a little circle jerk around a fucking TRS 80 or whatever the fuck they were doing and that little fort, you know, playing dungeons and dragons, playing poker for each other's loafers, whatever the fuck they did. Then they went their separate ways, whatever Satan was in the club, but he wanted to run shit. What did he do the fuck did the guy do again?

Speaker 2:          00:52:10       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:52:10       Somehow we pissed off God, Oh, I know. He tried to take over. He tried to take God's position and God was like, Oh no, you da all right. And then cast him into this fucking pit of fire that never goes out. But Somehow Satan is such a bad motherfucker that he sits in the flames and adapted. You know what I mean? Like somebody back in the day, they had bronchitis so they'd send them out to the desert to fucking dry out. Like that was going to cure you. He actually got cured to the point. Now Satan's down there and it's just chilling. Oh look who got up.

Speaker 2:          00:52:53       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:52:53       Oh Cleo, get over here now you got to Itch fucking for nine hours.

Speaker 2:          00:52:59       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:53:02       Yes. So now he's down there like fucking uh, you know, lucky Luciano hanging out at the fucking Flamingo and then you go down there, you go down, you basically live your life the way he wanted you to, and then you show up at the club and that he's mad at you and then kicks the shit out of you. It doesn't make any sense. And technically he's then punishing you for doing what he did. Is it like, uh, like that's like the mail room, like God's mail room. So we sit in this sort sorting envelopes, like he's still working for God. I don't, I really don't know how it works. I actually went to church this week. Oh Gee. I went there in the second I walk in, I just can't, like I, I don't buy into any of it. I went with the, I went with Nina's mom, we went to church.

Speaker 2:          00:54:02       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:54:02       And what I tried to do when I go in there is it go above all of it and try to like, you know, connect with something like Whoopi Goldberg in Ghost, you know, try to connect with something else other than what they're saying, like literally what they're preaching. It's like, I ain't no.

Speaker 2:          00:54:23       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:54:23       You guys had the holy wars, you had the fucking inquisition. I mean, you fucking, you know, want Jewish people after World War II. We're trying to get this shit back. Like the amount of stuff that went into the Vatican, I mean, you would down with the Nazis.

Speaker 2:          00:54:40       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:54:40       Like how has this plate, like, how did Penn state lose all those victories?

Speaker 2:          00:54:46       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:54:46       Right. Lost all those victories. And what happened to the Catholic Church? You know, I've, I've talked about this a zillion fucking types. They have broken on a global level, every major fucking commandment that there is, and they just sit there. Okay,

Speaker 7:          00:55:03       holy, holy, holy by Buddha.

Speaker 2:          00:55:19       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:59:20       You know, they all two girls, you know, set of the altar boys just to keep the priest honest, you know, which I thought was brilliant. That's a brilliant way to keep them away from little boys is to let girls do it. Cause they were all girls. There was no boys there. What else can I trash about it? I can't remember. You know, I, I, he gave the homily and I didn't remember one fucking thing that he said he wasn't Mike. Well, I couldn't understand what he's saying. I don't, that was my, those are my little trip to fucking church. But I went, but I went and I actually saw the confessionals and I was thinking, Jesus, this shit that I have to get off my chest. And then, but then I always think like a, what a fuck do I want to tell this guy? Why do I got to go in there and tell it to you? And then it goes, yeah. Then you run it up the fucking line,

Speaker 4:          01:04:00       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:04:01       Oh by the way, if anybody has any ideas of some shit that I can go to a gun store or something that's going to fucking be a cool thing to do in any of these cities for the love of God, let me know. Cause God knows the travel channel never comes to your towns. Caroline's the makeup date from July, I'm going to be there September, 2021 22 and 23 and I will be there with the teen idols sensation from the and Anthony Program, the one and only Joe, Joey Rose's Derosa.

Speaker 1:          01:04:32       Okay. This is his farewell performance as a feature act. Okay. This is literally the end of an era. Um, I can't even say he's arguably the greatest feature act of all time. He is the greatest feature act of all time. And A, we want to thank him all the headliners in this country for his dedicated service in the, uh, feature position for all of these years. Um, he stayed there longer than he had then he had to kind of like a blue chip prospect in college sports who leaves after his freshman or sophomore year. Joe is like the Tim Duncan of feature acts. He did all four years and this is his farewell performance. Um, of course he's going to get even more dressed up than usual. Uh, which usually is the one thing that if I could criticize him, it's the way he always out dresses me as a feature. But um, he always pulls back the reins on his talent, you know, because he chooses what's good for the show over what's good for Joey roses. Okay. And that's why he's the, he's the greatest of all time. He did things in the feature position that have never been done before and a, and in the opening.

Speaker 2:          01:05:39       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:05:40       And the opening slot is Sean Pat and one of my favorite new comics out there. It's going to be a great show. All of us have drinking problems. So we'll be at the bar afterwards. Please come by and say hello, but don't overstay your welcome, if you know what I'm saying. Right. Come by little fucking high five, get a picture with Joey roses on his final performance and then move. Keep it moving. All right. Unless there's somebody there that's going to show us the tits. Okay. I think that that's reasonable. I think that's a nice little zone that we can exist in. Can't we? Um, then the comedy zone in Jacksonville, Florida. Okay. I have never been here before. If this is literally carved in the side of a fucking barn right next to a check cashing store, it will not surprise me. I'm really looking forward to seeing what human beings look like. Like what if you were gonna say like Jacksonville, Florida, you know, you got a cities, you got B cities, c cities. Like where would you put that? You know what I mean? That was like the other day I was talking to a, I was talking to somebody.

Speaker 2:          01:06:46       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:06:46       And we were talking about this guy who was dumb but wasn't mentally challenged. And I basically said, yeah, he got the f brain is basically it. That was my way of saying that, you know, there's nothing wrong with them. He just got, you know, there's the a brain, the bee brain,

Speaker 2:          01:07:00       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:07:01       The sea, like the brain would be fucking, you know, Bill Gates and those types of guys. Einstein, you get, you get the deal, right? It's just like writing a paper. You get the f brain, you know, you failed, you failed at life. There's nothing technically wrong with your brain. You know what, it's like a car, you know, like when they had the z 28 but they also had like the rally sport with like a v six engine and no air conditioning. You've got the brain version of that. All right, so I'm going into a city. I wouldn't even, I, when I say Jacksonville's an F, I wouldn't say an EP. I was, it's a d, it's a fucking day. All right, and you people in Jacksonville, if you fucking offended by this, come out to the show. And I will give you the floor. I will give you a minute during my show to stand up like it's a town meeting and I want you to defend your fucking city and tell me why it deserves a better grade than a d. All right. If you can tell me why you're better than Tampa.

Speaker 2:          01:08:00       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:08:05       You know, at the end of the day to use that overused expression, um, I'm going to be in all of these cities so I'm not above them. You see that? That's

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       me pretending like I'm being humble and down to earth right now. Hey, can I, can I talk to you guys about that right now? Not being humble or pretending to be humble, kind of, uh, the fucking, the amount of hacky shit that's on the Internet, like on Twitter that somebody comes up with something and everybody dives on it, you know,

Speaker 1:          01:08:38       like when people do that, that, that feeling when those tweets.

Speaker 2:          01:08:45       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:08:45       You know what I mean? Like why, why would you think when you like the 90th fucking person to do it in a last minute? That that's still fucking cool. The shaking my head.

Speaker 2:          01:08:54       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:08:56       You know, just a bunch of fucking hacks and then they'll turn around and criticize movies and Shit, you know, or a guy like kid rock. What's wrong with people? Alright. Oh, full of shit. Huh? A hypocritical bill. That's it. I'm done. Go fuck yourselves. Have a great week on all the podcasts. Was a little wait late today, but uh, you know, it's a day off. Stop acting like you were in your cubicle. You weren't doing shit to you today. Right? Football season starts. Who Do you like? Jesus, I can't end this podcast. I got to tell you this. I have fucking issue with the quarterback on my team. All right. I saw something very disturbing that started to, you know, to start this season and it had nothing to do with the horrific pass protection that I've seen in the pre season. It has to do with a particular quarterback on the cover of this magazine with a Doberman pincher and the Dobermans growling. And he's also going like, ah, like the dog too. And uh, it's just, it's just not a good look.

Speaker 1:          01:10:03       I remember there was a time when this particular individual said, you know, I'm not into commercials in that I just want to win championships and now I'm looking at this guy with his perfect teen idols, stubble on the cover of the magazine as if he said, hey, I have a shoot on Tuesday. What Day should I stop shaving? Um, I dunno. I'm hoping if I do this, this'll be like the reverse jinx will this will actually make them win a Superbowl this year. Okay. Because we won that thing last year in fucking choked it away and it's still bugs me. We had that fucking game one

Speaker 1:          01:10:40       we had at one and we fucking choked it away. Actually, I can't say choked it away cause that's takes away from the giants victory. I'll say this is what it is. We had the opportunity to win the game and choked. They then had the opportunity to win the game and did not. They delivered. We did not. All right, so I don't know what the fuck we're on. Magazine covers for ground with dogs for when we came in. Second doesn't make sense to me. I don't, you know, it's like back in the day when I used to watch Peyton Manning, you know, lose another fucking playoff game. And next thing you know, he's driving down fucking street in a pacer, waving at a camera, you know, with a Gillette razor in his hand. I don't fucking understand that. Really build with 20 minutes of fucking advertising on your podcast. You don't get it. You'd dump content. Alright, I'm RDF Sia.
