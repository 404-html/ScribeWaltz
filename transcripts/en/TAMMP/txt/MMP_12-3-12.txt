Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burr and it's the Monday morning podcast for Monday, December 3rd, 2012 and uh, how are you, this is going to be a as promised last week and promised all over Twitter that I would have a special guest this week. Stand up and Rosebowl legend, the one and only the guy whose name I would never mention on the podcast after our first experience at the Rose Bowl. And here he is, the statue of limitations had run out. Ladies and gentleman, Mr. Joe Barton.

Speaker 2:          00:00:34       Oh Man. Thanks bill. Now in that coffin. Uh, well I know as soon as coughed into the, this is a, this is fun. Finally. Absolutely. After all the rose bowls and a dude, the rose bowls. I mean you've given me probably the two greatest thrills of my adult life. One obviously setting me up in my first six seconds on the ice with a goal or setting up your periods and then then the rolling

Speaker 1:          00:00:58       when we, when we were playing pickup hoc pick up hockey and you gliding around there like the great white shark. I got shout in front.

Speaker 2:          00:01:05       I mean to step on the ice, tap my stick. Rocky would tool hits me in the slot. I go top shelf. I should have just quit. Then w why I ended up, why I spent 500 bucks on the equipment and only played once. Well I played like 10 times with like no pads, eat bag, finally gave me a helmet. Then I bought all the stuff. I played once after that, but it was good,

Speaker 1:          00:01:27       scary. Joe Joe's like me, he's one of those guys who's watched hockey for a good 35 years but never played. We just didn't come from hockey families. We both figured we'd take up the game in our forties and we both looked like make a wish kids and when we were out there, the look on your face when you scored, you scored the goal and you just put your arms up and you just left them up and you said you had this big grin on your face and I saw it in your eyes. You're like, this is what it feels like. This, you would have thought you scored one at the NHL Level as opposed to

Speaker 2:          00:01:55       I felt like his NHL level cause I'll tell you I was scary when I first got there. I mean you guys know Ian bag, he's like six [inaudible] five. He's big. He's on skates unlike

Speaker 1:          00:02:04       from Canada and that he, he can fuck it. Like I heard he's skated with the conduct

Speaker 2:          00:02:07       did he played junior hockey. So I'm walking into the rink with just literally like my street hockey stick and those, then the rented scapes am I read it and I walked in and I see him skating around. I didn't even recognize him. I'm like Holy Shit, what did I get into? And then the step and to do that and I scored another one real quick. So I'm like I'm looking for the, I'm looking for the natural hat trick, your hat trick and 10 seconds and after that then bag, cause there's no hint league unless you can't stop. Right? Like me. Uh, so the bags like you're not going to get the hat trick and then cause I love bag and he loves me. He just started cross checking me in the crease and then that was, I never got the other thing I touched another park. But uh, like I said that

Speaker 1:          00:02:48       back when that, that pickup game is still fun. But that was, that was hilarious. It like the bad news bears, it was like everybody out there was a different level. So you could tell like how good somebody was by much equipment they had and how new or how old it was. You went out there, you had that fucking Pittsburgh penguins with no shield mass. That's all I remember. And you kept playing do and you are getting scary cause you're like fucking Cam Neely size. So that's what everybody was kind of saying was like if that fucking guy ever learns how to skate and doesn't learn how to stop, like he can't, if someone's going to get fucking killed,

Speaker 2:          00:03:20       well that's why I quit playing roller hockey. I played roller hockey in San Francisco for a season and like 10 like eighth game in. I couldn't stop on roller skates either. And I just absolutely buried some kid about your size, but not really athletic like you not to make it nice. Yeah, my son. No, no, no, no. Like you're, you're like, you know, you've been climbing your rope and stuff. I mean, you're, you're, you're not like this was a little kid trying to be actor in shape and I just be, I buried him like when Kevin Stevens had to buy a new face after the islanders, that's how hard I buried him and I'm like, you know what, I'm not here to hurt people purposely. I mean, it's, it's time to give that, but you got a good heart. I do have, I do have a good heart.

Speaker 1:          00:04:02       Really. You get one of those guys, if you played in the Nhl, you'd be that guy. You would fucking knock the dude down and the dude's land in the ice. You'd cochlear arm back and then you'd be like, no, no.

Speaker 2:          00:04:10       So now he's had enough and it, I don't think that would have a good dance though. After I won the fight, I do a nice Hogan. I'm sure it had one of those where I would have been in the stands once. Well I hope everyone has a good, like either junior ae or in Europe. Some every good goon has been in the stands was like someone would say something about Mulkin in like, you know, some, some mafia heroin, den in the, you know, uh, Mag Nita Gorse and that'd be up there swinging away protecting his mom.

Speaker 1:          00:04:40       No, I like that. You know, did you want to have to have you watched a fuck was, I just think it might, I have like add, you've just brought up something. Oh I know. For Fans, you know, cause you know hockey's like the rogue sport for fans, uh, who don't know what Joe's talking about. Well, I'm gonna, I'm gonna have a link up to that, that classic one where the Bruins went up into the stands at the Madison Square Garden and Mike Milbury, who now does like commentating wearing a suit. You actually watch him. He takes this guys loafer off loafers. We're big in the, uh, the 70, speaking of which you actually still have them cause you're old school. He took them off. He never hit the guy, he cocked it back. He was gonna hit him with the heel of it and it was uh, it's, it's, it's just something that can't be described. So you have to, you got to see it.

Speaker 2:          00:05:18       These, these loafers are my guilty pleasure and everybody remarks on them now because I've passed into the age where now I wear loafers and don't give a fuck. Like I went to Ross to buy some, I was by, by the time she was at Ross because why not buy Air Jordans that were 140 for 29 bucks? Like I don't need to know

Speaker 1:          00:05:37       like giant guys. Like you go to those kinds of places like when I go to like, like Ross, uh, for people on the east coast, was it Ross dress for less shit for less, whatever the fuck they call it. You walk in that they actually have Shaq size shoes in there for that six foot eight guy who couldn't dunk.

Speaker 2:          00:05:52       Yeah. And like neon green and purple, they're all that crazy shit. It's always like that fucking shit you get when your house gets flooded.

Speaker 1:          00:06:02       Those fucking giant sneakers that are like neon green. Yeah. Apps a Fuckin lutely. So dude, I gotta tell you, speaking of the fucking Rosebowl, the granddaddy of them all like got a, I went out and I got the tickets, you know, every year that's my job. I go out, I get the tickets and then I rent the fucking four door fucking dodge ram pickup to drive over there doing. I'm actually, uh, I, I've just completely checked out of Christmas shopping and all the other shit. All I'm doing is thinking about that. What do you think about fucking with Wisconsin's in it again?

Speaker 2:          00:06:29       Uh, yeah. You know, we could've, we could've been ugly game. That's going to be ugly in the parking lot. No, I mean there's some Nice Wisconsin people. I wish I in Nebraska, I liked them. Corn husker girls you've ever played in Nebraska, Nebraska.

Speaker 1:          00:06:42       La had said like, he, he was rooting for Nebraska yesterday because he said so we can look at different fat chicks.

Speaker 2:          00:06:47       Yeah, the brass because they're a little bit, they're like younger, little healthier, like did their kind of like this, like the playboy centerfold kind of chicks. The present Cornell's for girls.

Speaker 1:          00:06:57       Uh, when they get them, they get them from that sort of the uh, Oklahoma, Nebraska.

Speaker 2:          00:07:03       Right. The bigger loss though was UCLA because Stanford has nicely can girls, but they're really smart. Then that the type of girls that like, Hey, let's get her, let's take her tops off at 8:00 AM that girl last year with the, the fucking, uh, oh, is it tequila with the pickle juice? Dirty Mexican. Oh my God. Is that what they call that drink? They did, yes. They did the dirty Sanchez. I actually walked around with Picardy dirty Mexican. The leaf blower. It's what they call that a leaf blower. There you go. Oh, we actually walked, I actually went to like five different people's houses with Tequila and pickle juice. Try and explain to them and everybody thought I was like, you've lost your mind. Bardic I'm like, yeah. I mean obviously I did 30 years ago. Right, but here's the great pickle juice. It's cost effected. Everybody for saving money over the holidays because you can get the most rot, Gut Tequila in the world. It tastes good. If you chug pickle juice with afterwards,

Speaker 1:          00:08:00       you chase it because I hate, I hate to kill the dude that's always, not like I ever drank antifreeze, but if I ever did, I always feel it tastes like some sort of cleaner. It's really fucking, and it's the amount of people too who really like, uh, just slam that shit. I had somebody a long time ago, one of one of work for one of my managers that I had back in the day and he, he fucking drank Tequila and he drank. He drank that shit like, you know, like we drink crown royal. Like it was nothing. Now I'd like to this day, dude, as much as we'll fucking booze bag as I am, if you give me a shot of Tequila, I will make a face like I'm in seventh grade. I just can't get that shit down. Oh, remember that coalesced she, she had the fucking overalls.

Speaker 2:          00:08:37       Yeah, I remember bad ass in the fucking half shirt and underwear. I remember all of it. He was good. Yeah, I remember that. That was before it got a little blurry or that I in the chronological history of the Rose Bowl Rao. Uh, first one ever. The epic, the, the granddaddy of them all the one, it's like every great empire starts with a big crime. Yes. That was a crime against you made that was this the greatest? That was probably my funniest time as an adult ever. That there's,

Speaker 1:          00:09:04       why was that? Cause I feel like we get just as drunk every year, but that there was just something about, I think because it was all new. Yeah. No, but everything worked out. We walked in that completely fuck hammered. I remember I bought that, that 50 year old guy. A program. Cause he thought it was too expensive and I was like, let me get to you like technical. Do you know what you're looking at? You're looking at a big shot. You're not going to see a lot of, I suppose chocolate, like a fucking idiot. And we smoke in those Cubans and we what we got in and somehow you still had your Cuban cigar. I could, you have your ticket around you.

Speaker 2:          00:09:37       You bought the, uh, the super duper ticket holder and they do, I'm a nerd. I tried to say it was so many people's squishing in that they weren't even looking at me that I was still smoking a Cuban cigar. There's something about eating a steak, drinking a bottle of crown, smoking a Cuban cigar that makes you feel empowered to do anything.

Speaker 1:          00:09:57       People listen to this thinking that you mean he means splitting a bottle every year. Joe shows up with two bottles of crown, one for us and one for him. And Dude, I heard Jimmy page and all that picture that he takes where he puts the, the Jack Daniels back like that. I already just stuck his tongue in the, in the holder. Just, it was just like a photo op thing. You actually down the hall.

Speaker 2:          00:10:17       Oh, that's considered a fifth. That's terrible. Yeah, it's, well, it's the regular size crown, but that's terrible than though. I didn't want to know that.

Speaker 1:          00:10:23       Well, he made it up with the fucking, uh, the heroin abuse. Oh, I'm just repeating something from somebody in a bar who allegedly met fucking,

Speaker 2:          00:10:31       well, let me tell you something Mr and a bar, if you're going to talk shit about Jimmy page, I just make sure it's true because that's, that's not a rumor that she'd be like, you know Jimmy page, he's not really drinking. That's like Jay Jimmy Page's jacked. His is really ice tea. It's like when you find out when Dean Martin like, like no dean was drunk most of the time just when he was already gone. Like the producer, like let's put a little less water, this one down because now people want to revision is history like, Oh dean was drinking ice tea like yet in the hookers were fake like gimme a break. Like these guys were partying

Speaker 1:          00:11:04       their asses off and they could, they had a good buzz going, look, you got to know me. Most of my shit is just stuff that I just repeat shit that somebody tells me and then that's it. That's it. I don't, I don't.

Speaker 2:          00:11:14       No, but we do drink a lot, but I haven't,

Speaker 1:          00:11:17       well I had though liar is the cook lie ads looking at a barbecue brisket or something.

Speaker 2:          00:11:23       Dave gave a game too. I'd say the other thing too, just the planes coming over when you're, when you are bombed, there is nothing better than to uh, to like f 16 flying right over your head that you're not expecting. I mean that was just like, yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:11:40       those are like two like historic teams too. It's like we went to first year and it was USC versus

Speaker 2:          00:11:45       Penn State and Penn state gained six total yards in that game and I celebrated it. Like they won 40 nothing.

Speaker 1:          00:11:53       Well that's cause you yelled at that fucking contract was sitting in front of Oh, she got mad at you with the cigar.

Speaker 2:          00:11:58       Yeah. Yeah. The funny thing was was I mean I, my sister went to Penn state, my sats, I could've taken him six times, I wouldn't get an independent state if you added them all together. But

Speaker 1:          00:12:08       like a three 90 or a four oh four oh seven combined and I took a prep course

Speaker 2:          00:12:12       but we were like, actually the day I was going to take the sats, I uh, the night before my, a friend of mine is like, Hey, come help me collect some money. So I didn't get a good night's sleep before I took my test. Oh, that's right. Back in the day when you were in Pittsburgh back in the day. Yeah. We want tell them those stories. But that's, that was my essay. That's what I didn't do too good on the sats.

Speaker 1:          00:12:31       You don't, yeah. Is it those that, that stuff about uh, collected money back in the day when you are, you are the, uh, the fucking dude they brought around the enforcer that you, you don't get into that stuff ever, Huh?

Speaker 2:          00:12:42       No, it was just fun. It's just, it's just, it was just for beer money. Let's talk about that.

Speaker 1:          00:12:51       That's why that guy, that one year, the first year the wife were that lady after she gave you shit, she said something about your nose and then you said you need to lose about 20 pounds before you talk to me, bitch. And then she turned to her husband and he turned around and took one look at you and then started John at me. You know,

Speaker 2:          00:13:08       I send me, like I said, like 40 though. She was a big ugly woman. The thing was, I'm a nice guy, bill and I, if you just went and said, hey, can you please put that cigar out? I always said, oh my God. Oh my God. I actually, I snuck this in. I'm, I'm sorry I didn't sneak it in. I just forgot it was smoking it. I'm like, uh, uh, sorry. I'll put it out. You had it

Speaker 1:          00:13:30       chomped in your mouth, like you were a general surveying,

Speaker 2:          00:13:34       conquered land. It was like I was, it's like I was, it's like I was a a boxing efficient auto from the 1920s yeah, it was awesome. She said she came out of the gate and then I was just like, well that's uncalled for and that's what I said, you need to lose about 40 pounds to talk to me. And then I thought we were getting kicked out.

Speaker 1:          00:13:55       But in defense of her though, like we were, so you realize how fucking ridiculous it was. Well first of all, I fell on that fucking old lady sort of fell into her. Yes. And nobody helped me up. I had to push off her and I felt folded her and half. And then you got to the seat and then you had the fucking cigar too. So already we, we were kind of a spectacle will be, we have, we have to have a little bit of empty

Speaker 2:          00:14:17       to paint the picture of where we were at though too. If you ever wish to a college football game, you see the stands and it's like, oh my God, there's 100,000 people wearing red or orange or green. There was literally 50,000 people wearing USC colors and just a speck of me and bill just wearing like neutral. Nothing yet. But they knew we were

Speaker 1:          00:14:38       Penn state immediate. Once that lady's started yelling at me, I was just, I mean I'm not a USC fan anyways, so I uh,

Speaker 2:          00:14:43       but I, I did like to use because the girls were so hot and then we met a guy that was such a fan. He literally had the uh, the Trojan outfit and let us put on the Trojan helmet and at the helm. That's the beauty of the rose boy. I think that makes it so much fun as, hey, it's 80 degrees outside everywhere else the weather sucks and the teams are so happy to be there. There's nothing really on the line. Know what I mean? Other than you know, your own bedding purposes. So everyone's just happy to be partying is not like in your, in your, in Pittsburgh and I mean like some of the best tailgates or green bay or any other city where rules, there's tension in the air and it's 20 degrees. It's sunny. Everyone's happy to be there throwing the ball around. It's just, it's the way it should.

Speaker 1:          00:15:31       No, you told me something the other day. I thought it was, cause you know, you know I'm a big like maniac as far as going around to different stadiums and all that. Like I love all of them and I got a chance to go to three rivers before they knocked it down. I saw and didn't see a Steelers. I saw a pirates game there when they honored Willie Stargell literally like two weeks before he died. Oh, pops. Yes. And I remember it was a cubs game and I was sitting down in the right field line and Sammy Sosa was still playing. And uh, but you were saying your dad has had season tickets since the stadium that they played in before three rivers, which was what,

Speaker 2:          00:16:00       yeah, my dad has had tickets since Forbes field, Forbes. And then they went to Pitt stadium or something for a couple years. I may have this reverse, but he's had them like in both of those places. Then they went to three rivers and my dad sat exactly on the 54 rows from the top four rows for us

Speaker 1:          00:16:19       top. And he sat there and he, he watched them go from sucking, I mean you guys were the absolute, you know, you're one of the original NFL teams and you are a doormat for the good, what, 30 40 years.

Speaker 2:          00:16:29       It's finally come back to where now we're like better than we suck. Like, like I was born in 1969 that's the year they drafted Joe Greene. I'm 43 for the first 40 years. They you when like four games now we finally, now it's like we'd been better than, and then we've been, then we sucked. It was probably when I was watching the Super Bowl era. Yeah. Cause when I was like five or six, my dad would take me to games. That's when it was all steel workers went there. And you saw Lambert Ham? I saw every, I saw the game where Bradshaw supine in the ice anyway. Lay off games. Yeah. I mean the greatest thing was we were on our, our side was this dealer that was on the cover of sports illustrated I think. Yeah. Our side was on the Steeler bench. So the greatest thrill ever is in a is the Steelers would kick off and then this, then okay, the other team would have the ball one, two, three and out. And then this too, this come off to our side and then it's like watching the hall of fame induction community come off. But I mean that's the Steelers and the place of that. There's 11 guys on defense, like six of them, maybe a well four for four on defense and a dude LC Greenwood bell sees not in yet. He isn't. No, it's mean Joe Lambert Ham and Mel Blunt and then it's on the offense as Webster Swann Stallworth Bradshaw Franco and of course the emperor Chuck Noll and they used to be flat.

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       That's nine. Nine out of your 22 that's almost half the guys on your fucking t. Your of your starting team made the fucking hall of fame on a foot

Speaker 2:          00:18:00       ball team. Well the thing was is in for years they wouldn't put swan or Stallworth in and it used to be the old manager of the punchline. Jim Cornet knew at like five in the morning when I'm bottle of crown and you want to get me to argue for an hour, just say, I don't think Lynn Swann should be in the hall of fame.

Speaker 1:          00:18:14       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:18:14       That, that was always, it's almost like now I can die in peace. Like the ranger fan? No,

Speaker 1:          00:18:19       like that was the first time we brought up you and I discussed all Samuelson and Cam Neil and you were like, yeah, I mean, yeah, you know I didn't take off. Was that bad a guy I was like, you got and you, what's funny about you is you just don't ever lose your cool. You just sit there and just be like, hey, you know, which was making me fucking matter and matter. I remember we were over fucking Jimmy doors and Jimmy was killing everybody playing ping pong. Oh, take an inbetween. Jimmy was fucking talking shit to him. Just, I'm just returning the ball bill. I'm just returning the ball and he put all this fucking spin on it. I get my ass kicked off.

Speaker 2:          00:18:52       Well, the Democrats must've been losing that year. Don't play door when the Republicans in the White House, he'll take it out on you.

Speaker 1:          00:18:59       Exactly. So we got in that epic fight, but you know, I'm trying to think. So the first NFL game you went to you, he brought you there when you were like, what, four or five years?

Speaker 2:          00:19:07       Yes. There was like 10, 10, no women, no women ever in like just 10 boys that were lucky enough to have. I went with my dad and my grandpop and that was the original curtain, the original everything.

Speaker 1:          00:19:19       So wait, um, now can you remember, did you ever see Oj Simpson? I'm eats a frame. No, I won't eat some of the guys you saw because the first game I went to was like, I'm the 80s. I saw the guys like Dan Marino. I saw Jim Zorn. I saw guys from like leftovers 70 guys and all the 80 guys when I, when I would go to the patriots, but like 70s guys, that's when I collected football cards. That's when they were like gods to me. So can you remember anybody, uh, any party you saw Earl?

Speaker 2:          00:19:43       Oh yeah. I still saw Earl Campbell to me, still the greatest running back I've ever seen because he's the only guy that, that was when I was a kid. I was ever afraid of like when I was a kid that the Steelers were like the globe trotters. Like they never law when they lost in [inaudible] 77 to the orange crush in Denver in mean Joe, my favorite Steeler, obviously he punched the guy in the stomach and got thrown out. It ruined Christmas. Like I still believed in Santa Claus, but the Steelers losing and mean joke and tossed out. It was like Christmas was ruined. I was such a fucked up. Yeah. That was the year with Craig Morton and those guys, right? Ah, yeah. That's next week. They'd beat the Raiders. Yes. John Madden, Madden, and then they got crushed by the cowboys, which is such a joke. Oh, the team. The team. That decade where there, you'd never beat anybody for real. When it ever really mattered. Dallas, they wouldn't have a called the team. They would call Americas two Americas team. Yeah. That's like, whoa.

Speaker 1:          00:20:31       Nope. America's team means is that you have fans in every city. It doesn't mean that you're the best team will take that the wrong.

Speaker 2:          00:20:36       Well for years though, it's like they always revisions. We know this and that, you know, and it's like Lynn Swann always says the game gives you moments. It's what you do with those moments. Yeah. And Jackie Smith, you dropped the ball. You must be the sickest man in America.

Speaker 1:          00:20:53       Bless his heart. He's got to be the sickest man in America. I got to put that clip up there too. That was like, dude, I gotta tell you something though. When I went over to, uh, Stockholm, Sweden and I was totally jet lagged, some fucking Steeler fan put all four of the Steelers Superbowls in their entirety. I don't know if is still up on youtube. It was the fucking shit. And I gotta tell you something about the Dallas cowboys. 1976 they had you guys beat, they played Marty Ball and they started the game with the fucking reverse on the kickoff to fucking Hollywood Henderson. He runs up the sideline. Roy Jarell knocked it, knocked him out of bounds. He took a need of the ribs. He missed like three field goals because of that fucking place. And Tom Landry got all fucking conservative and shut his offense down.

Speaker 2:          00:21:37       No, ensued the kickoff and let it in the hands of his defense. I really like, I mean,

Speaker 1:          00:21:46       yeah, like those games really did. That to me is those who like to be like the best soup I ever saw us just as far as two powerhouse teams was that 79 one the Steelers first, the cowboys and the to that worst, uh, matchups to the worst matchups that were almost great fucking super bowls was if the fucking Raiders beat the stupid orange crush that year. They were defending super bowl champions and they would've gone up against the Dallas cowboys with a rookie Tony Doerr set. Now how much fucking better that guy and said it's stupid. 27 to 10 game. And then in 85, when my stupid patriots, we beat the fucking Miami Dolphins. The Miami on reason why the bears didn't go undefeated was because the Dan Marino beat him on Monday night football beat the 46 defense. They were 15 and fucking won. It would have been the rematch. Dan Marino defended the undefeated dolphins that Superbowl would have happened, but the stupid fucking patriots. We went into the orange ball one for the first time in like 20 years and then we go in there and just, we got Rick, I think we've got raped. We literally got raped

Speaker 2:          00:22:47       and I hate the, I hate the shit on the Pittsburgh guy who I love, but he, he should let pate and get the touchdown. That was a disgrace when he gave the fridge the ball really going to get there and to give the fridge the ball because the fridge is the fridge

Speaker 1:          00:23:00       cause they got caught. They got caught up in that soup

Speaker 2:          00:23:03       as opposed to like Walter Payton

Speaker 1:          00:23:07       who was playing on like two and 14 teams or two and 12 teams when he started because they didn't have

Speaker 2:          00:23:11       wait when everyone's still ran the ball like the SCC, when football was about it was a man's game. And it's not like

Nick, before we get into this, aside from the fact you were one of my great friends, both in and out of this business, uh, we're here to actually promote Joe Barton. ACC has a new standup CD, uh, hour long a CD that he's going to be releasing off of all things comedy, our podcast network called salute. Um, tell the, uh, tell the fine folks about it.

Speaker 2:          00:27:06       Oh, it's a, it's a fun CD recorded it live at the punch line San Francisco. It's about 15 minutes of Barton a classics, so I can hopefully bury some of that material. I've been lagging around and need some new stuff. Everyone's like, we've heard that 10 times. It's like, well, you can keep coming back. Thanks. But I'm actually buy it on Amazon and it comes out Tuesday. Help Bill, help the wounded warriors and don't go out and traffic. I'll tell you what, I was just in traffic yesterday going to a Gig and I was like, heavenly people figured out Amazon yet. Like you can just sit at home in your underwear. It's like they have your, your, your, they have your mastercard, they have your sister's address. You just go boom, boom, boom. And then is it, that's it. It's amazing. But yeah, it's a called salute. Like instead of cheers as Italian scope salute. And since I'm a big drinker and a lot of the jokes are about drinking and the one way or the other, it's good.

Speaker 1:          00:27:59       First time I ever heard salute was that on some live old a Sinatra album. I heard it, it was with him with the count Basie orchestra and they brought out a drink. He said something and he said, salude Gin Donna, I could almost somewhat Italian shit. I don't know what. And he laughed or whatever. And I was just like, it just seemed like even just in that moment on the record, it just seemed like it was so much better that like, uh, I dunno, it was just like if you went and saw frank, it's not like somebody would take out a fucking iPhone and then film it and then if you didn't make it, you could see a clip of it. It's just like you, it was such a fucking, everything was just such a fucking event. That's why like, you know why I'm sitting here being a total geek about listening to you, going to those, you went to NFL games in the 70 through the 70. [inaudible] that was like the golden age of NFL football. Like the level of quarterbacks that were in the League, Stabler Bradshaw Stop Act, Fran Tarkington. Uh, who else?

Speaker 2:          00:28:55       Some of the biggest ones. Even the Shitty quarterbacks like Ken Anderson or Brian's site, Dan Fouts. Oh, balance is amazing. But even like, bet, even the backup plan, pastor Areni, Dante passionate like junk. Don Strock construct would be a playoff quarterback nowadays. Oh, the way they fucking throw now. Yeah. They don't even run for four yards. So those guys will throw for 300 yards and they're literally like, you know, 42 for 48 and you're like, oh my God, the accuracy. It's like now they're throwing four yard fucking passes, but allowed to touch a wide receiver. I mean, think of, think of what swan would do now. They couldn't touch them. I mean, they used to just try to abuse them every second did the Raiders are like, you know, hit him in the head swan play with concussions every week. It's like, oh, Mel Blount

Speaker 1:          00:29:40       rule, which if you can find this guy's footage on the on on, on Youtube of the 1976 soup bowl, Mel blanches beats the shit out of, of a Golden Richards, the whole fucking game called Richard's almost as crying and the end of it. And he finally gets so fed up in the fourth quarter, he punches Mel blunt back and Mel Blunt, just, I forget it was a forearm shiver or something to his ribs and uh, Golden's laying on the ground, almost crying, no flag. And like the ref saw like the, the the fucking elbow and stuff. It was just considered football.

Speaker 2:          00:30:11       It's a man's game. They used to be football. Well he used to be football was like the 12 like the 10 guys in the bar. You wouldn't mess with those guys played football now it's like the 10 guys who when they were 15 started taking steroids and like, and they went through all the best schools and they got recruited and they, they they did good in the combine and Blah Blah Blah. It's like, cause the guys that played the stuff

Speaker 1:          00:30:34       here, you don't even see me. I'm just pitching about the rules. I still think that those guys are fucking maniacs man. I just think like the level of like, like the money and there's so much at stake now that you can't just be going down to the bar, drinking a 12 pack and then going out and playing your, your, your high school football game Friday night. You know, you really got to take it.

Speaker 2:          00:30:51       But I think the, I think in the 70s those, those guys were way more outlaws. They were the outlaws, the steel. I mean like Ernie Holmes shot at a police helicopter and Rooney brought, uh, brought a bag of money up to Cleveland. Like I let them off the hook. It was like, it was like that, that that wouldn't happen now. Nowadays, now that they should have rate [inaudible] have a Rachel Nichols outside the, outside the facility that was wrong with Ernie. I mean it's like, I just read that big ESPN book, that like thousand page book. I'll give it to you and it's all like behind the scenes it's like, you know, I, anyway, you painted, I still hate Suzy Kolber. She despicably did not kiss. I would kiss Joe Willie name if on national TV. Why would you disparage Joe Willie name if it's like it's Broadway Joe. Everybody loves the ladies than poor man had to go to Rehab. He was embarrassed like you can

Speaker 1:          00:31:47       funny was the second he started talking. You knew he was hammered. Yeah, he was just, he just had that fucking, I can't feel my nose glow. Look on his face, but it's Joe Namath. He's allowed. I know Andy was back there with his friends. You know what they would do and you know, they would talk and shit gone. Come on guys. You know, if we were healthy, we'd fucking kill this team. You know, they were having a good time and all of a sudden he's talking to some fucking lady and you know him. He went back to the 70s back at the playboy mansion.

Speaker 2:          00:32:13       Well she grabbed them, the show come over here and she grabbed was like, well, what's he going to do? I really want it kiss. Oh I love do I follow him on Twitter. He's the best. I love that. I just, I love Joe. Ease the is Joe name. That's, that's one thing about Pittsburgh too. It's like, you know, and then you hate when I go off of it. But you know Johnny, you basically invented football. Oh

Speaker 1:          00:32:32       No, no, no, no. I just, I give you shit about the amount of times that you quote. Like, I don't give a fuck what situation. We could be in the middle of the desert, like running out of water and you just be like, wait, no. One time Mike Wagner said,

Speaker 2:          00:32:44       well John Stallworth to quote you on to Stallworth my fucking super fair man. I keep my two favorite sports coats or Lynn Swann. The game gives you moments. My other one is actually, I told it to John Madden's face and he loves to tell that story though. Okay. So we're out in a business park, me and my buddy, the captain out in like an hour west east of Oakland, which is basically, if you're not on the coast and California muzzle be in Texas, right? This is like, this is actually where they shoot the sons of anarchy. Uh, it's just the bad lands of California. Anyway, we're out there, uh, probably dropping off a bag of weed to a friend of mine or something when we were there around lunchtime and uh, [inaudible] and we see this massive force coming out of a diner and John's huge and he's wearing like a big winter coat because it gets cold there.

Speaker 2:          00:33:27       It's like 42 recognize Matt. And immediately, immediately, and that it would be like, Hey John. So I'm going to go into captain like, hey man, like kitten. I'm like, look, look, look, look, look. And all of a sudden, so anyway, we started walking and he's like, oh my God. So then so there we go. Hey Mr. Mad. Or like, hey, hey, hey, what, what was, was he freaking out? He just said guide to be. Yeah. And I mean the captain at noon and an office park, it's like a, it's like an office park. We're getting, you know what these guys want. Yeah. So he starts walking really fast. Like I'm getting away from these gals trying to go to his car and he's like not fun with his keys. He's trying to hurt with his keys. So then I, so then, so he's totally ignoring us.

Speaker 2:          00:34:04       Just like maybe these guys will go away. I'm going to blow my rape whistle, like get away. And then I just yell out my favorite quote actually, which is, he told his super bowl pregame speech was, this will be the greatest day of your life. Only if you win. So you yelled that I yelled at him, right. Then he turns around and goes, oh, hey fellas, how you doing? And he showed us his Superbowl ring. We went over and shook his hand and then an autograph guy. And until like a year ago, I wasn't even a picture guy. Right. But you kind of have to do that now. So I'm just like, it was just a thrill. And then literally we got in our car and just called the first thousand people we could talk to, like we just met. They use that line on myself for like big sets are big shows or big appearances or something is like, oh, that's what you use it to psych yourself. Yeah. Like this'll be the greatest day of your life.

Speaker 1:          00:34:56       Only if you kill, I'll leave you kill. That's hilarious. Fucking late. Yeah. I gotta admit like I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm fighting really hard not to become the, uh, the crabby old guy sitting there talking about how the game used to be. And I think, you know, I understand they got to do what they gotta do. You understand dude, this, there's future football. They're going to start with the Lyman standing up so they don't slam their heads.

Speaker 2:          00:35:21       Well, I would, I understand is that you know what, you want to live till you're 70 drive a bus. You will, you will, you want to have baby Mamas and mansions and drive cars. It'd be on Yo MTV raps, then you're going to die when you're 50 and that's the way it is. If he don't it play in the CFL, like, I mean that's just, that's just, that's football. See that's the thing bill. I, that's what I grew up on. I grew up on that. That's, it's just, I still enjoy it. How I work for the NFL on Fox, it pays me. I love, I get to take it. I watch every game. It's still good. It's still better than what you, 98% of everything else, but it's not the third one. You got five wide receivers in the game. That's not football. Right. I mean, that's what I love about me. You know, like, and all these tricks and like Chuck Noll, coach Chuck Noll again or for the, you know, like, Eh, you can, you can fool some of the people some of the time. But in the end it comes down to blocking and tackling. And that's football. It's about lining up. It's the Oklahoma drill, you know, it's bad. Then he would do

Speaker 1:          00:36:27       you quote Steelers the way like a Jesus free quotes like scripture?

Speaker 2:          00:36:31       Well, NFL films to me, it shocked knowl three 16 to me, if you grew up in Pittsburgh, if you're from Pittsburgh in the 70s you can jerk off to super, but you could jerk off to NFL films. It's that great. In San Francisco I was roommates with,

Speaker 1:          00:36:43       that's the greatest running the soup bowl. Have you guys won? Four and six.

Speaker 2:          00:36:47       Four and six. My, my old roommate, one of my old roommates who is a complete, uh, art guy and drew and it was sensitive. He probably wrote poetry, I dunno, but he hated football, but he just loved the cinnamon tography. If NFL films unreal, I mean, that's, that's how great. It's almost like, it's almost like regular football. If you just watch a game, like whatever, you're going to watch, whatever today. It's not as good as watching the NFL films version.

Speaker 1:          00:37:13       And if, yeah, NFL films, I always forget the guy, the voice of God. Oh John Facenda what? The autumn wind is a radar. Oh yeah. You know, it was great. You haven't heard already a already lang.

Speaker 2:          00:37:26       Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, all the time. I love that. We can dig in already. That's the best

Speaker 1:          00:37:31       when he quotes that. Oh yeah. I want to, I went in, I did nick and already showed such a, if you guys aren't listening to what your autumn audio mind, if you just want to listen to two people talking sports and even if you're not into sports, you can just going to love listening to it. Cause it's just, they're just guys, guys. It's fucking great. And I was sitting out, uh, waiting to go in and he went into his, uh, his impression of that the autumn wind is a radar. I can't remember how the fuck it goes. And he just did the whole poem. And, uh, he fucking, he's just his delivery because he's a fucking great actor too, man. You know,

Speaker 2:          00:38:03       he's, he's, I mean, I love already like, I mean, are you laying his, his football jokes on his, uh, Jack and coke special is the greatest when he wrote, when he rips on the eagles. Let's just the funniest thing ever, I made Kevin Shay watch or like tape.

Speaker 1:          00:38:16       I got to see it. It's just funny to do a chunk on the eagles and his standup special. Yeah. Do my buddy Paul verse. He said one time he goes, you know, it's fucking weird is everybody watches sports for the most part. We say everybody. I mean the masses watch real men. Yeah, but, but no

Speaker 2:          00:38:30       people who you're going to talk to. What sports? Not that the guy with the, well, we,

Speaker 1:          00:38:35       anybody who's into our

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       shit, real guys, guys that you like it if you're wearing a hat just because you think it's cool. Uh, and I like, you're trying to do like, you know, I'm not going to talk to you anyway like that. That's just how I have you stand up. Like, I like the guys who I would be drinking with. I don't like the guys who I wouldn't be drinking with. And that's just the way it is now. Some guys are just,

Speaker 1:          00:38:53       do I like hanging out with you? Cause I need a, over the years I've gotten a little more fucking, a little something of your bite neck stuff has rubbed off on me cause I'm one of those fucking, I'm like, you know, I'm a liberal. I'm one of those empathetic people. Hey, let me see the other side of this shit. Lot of people wouldn't believe that. Listen to this podcast. Well that's like you go ahead. I'm sorry, but I fucking, uh, you know, at finally I've gotten to the point of IOL actually now, like if someone's a fucking Dick, I'll just be like, all right, that guy's a dick. But it's still won't stop me from trying to understand why they're a dick. But you're, you're, you're like, you're just so fucking efficient with that shit. Like I know a couple of guys like you in my life where it's just, you've just real efficient, you size somebody up. And the second you think that they're udicky like fuck that guy and you don't give a fuck about whoa. Maybe his dad laughed. You don't give a fuck. You just like fuck him.

Speaker 2:          00:39:43       I Dunno. I mean I feel bad for him if his dad though I feel bad. You know what? I feel bad for people who lose their mothers cause and just like the, not to be tragic, the Kansas City thing. That's what's sad is like some weeks it doesn't have a mother, but uh, that's a fucking, I didn't want to get into it cause it's just a sad topic. But uh, the uh, no, uh, we're going to talk about now, uh, oh, sizing people up. Well, I grew up in bars. My grandfather owned and ran bars. And so

Speaker 1:          00:40:08       wait a minute, why the fuck isn't that the name of your Special Joe Part? Nick? I grew up in bars. If you somehow had picture, if you sitting there on this stool, I'm sorry, I'm interrupting you Greg Story.

Speaker 2:          00:40:19       No, no, no, but that's so, you know, when you're, when you're like four years old in Pittsburgh, in, in the 70s. And bars. You can size people up. You understand people's Mojo in about a second if they're good old. Were you when they, when he, when you were getting brought into these bars, like three, four, five, six of my grandfather always have three. He was like norm, he had a seat in every bar. He goes and people are like, hey hair. He can everybody Harry, his name was Dominic. He was like the original guy that would say, dude, cause he couldn't remember a million people's names. So he would just go, hey hair. Hey Harry. And he was totally bald. That's why it's either games. He was the genie cause they'd rub his head for good luck. They actually rubbed his head before the immaculate reception and that's, that's a true story. So he was always the genie after that to lift up what's happening?

Speaker 1:          00:40:59       Say that you were at that game.

Speaker 2:          00:41:01       I was not at the immaculate reception game. No, it was not. My first live game was in 1976 actually it was the, it was Tampa Bay versus the Steelers. They won 40 to nothing in a blizzard. No ones.

Speaker 1:          00:41:15       Half the quarterback was Doug Williams there.

Speaker 2:          00:41:18       I don't remember. I mean I was like six years old. It was just a blizzard and everyone was mad that we went. That's where my dad would go to every game to Mac. Now if it's like raining and in early October, Eh, it's a little chilly outside. I'm going to stay home. But before Kizzy waited 40 years to see a, but just as you saw I sites were up like and women to spray like that and an old girlfriend of mine was like, she was like, I love Sarah over by there. Her name was like, Sarah. Sarah is a great friend of mine. She's my friend. I'm like, she's like, cause I'm like, don't, don't deal with her. We broke up three years later, this girl comes in because you were so right about Sarah. She was such a big, I'm like, I told you I can just, but other people in Hollywood or they were like, they're, they're nice to everybody because they were all only one. If that guy gets it. Tonight's show and, and the old way, like really? Who gives a shit? Like life's too short. If he's a dick now, he'll be a dick then I don't really care. Like I'm friends with who I want to be friends with, but I'm nice. I'm pretty much nice to everybody though. I'm just not their friends.

Speaker 1:          00:42:13       No, no I wouldn't. I would 100% agree with that before we get too deep into the podcast and we're going to talk football the whole time. I mean I guess there's not a lot to talk about. What about fucking hockey? But uh, and there was Saturday I been kind of blaming the owners cause it's been a lockout and they agreed to a deal but someone was giving me shit on Twitter saying, did you see this shift to players did now you, are you still on the player's side? I hope not. And I haven't really been paying attention. Last I paid attention. They were down to like, you know, players were going from 57% and out of 50

Speaker 2:          00:42:38       I have three things to say about the hockey thing. One is why does it just, I know, let me Save, talk you three times. But he used to come back again. What does it Lemahieu Shanahan, Holly and Steve Eiserman just getting a room and just say, you know what, we, you know, this is the fucking game. Here's the deal. Just play hockey in. That's it. But the two things I do want to say is like, you know the other for like a month, I'm like, it's dark outside. I need to be watching five games. Like I'm shaking. Then last week I just was like, you know what? I'm reading the book. I don't, I don't miss it. And you know what? Nhl, if I'm not missing it, who the hell is going to be watching like Carolina, Ottawa on Fox sports south to alternate, you know you don't want, I've got me back in the hot. I'm not watching it. Who's going to, who's who's coming back? They're really sad thing is my daughter for Christmas got this doll that's like the super doll that you have to knife to buy $80 outfits for. So my sister was like, I'm going to buy her a penguin outfit. The lady in Pittsburgh is like, oh, we're not making penguin outfits this year because of the strike shit. I'll get her a Steeler one. So that's just how far down like everything is. The hockey just gets lower and lower now because of the stress.

Speaker 1:          00:43:48       Stupid. And they made more money than they ever made. They get the, they have the winter classic dude, it's an NHL hockey has not been on network television on NBC, CBS or ABC has not been on it the entire time I've watched it. It was on in the 70s. The worst time they could've made the deal when it was just absolutely a fucking bar room brawl every, um, every game you don't something, this is the one thing, the only thing I like it just two things I like about the Montreal Canadians being a Bruins fan. One was when they booed Patrick Wa and he said, fuck you guys, I'm never playing here again, cause that really fucked that franchise. And then he goes to when to with the avalanche, which were the Nordiques so that could piss off

Speaker 2:          00:44:29       the, uh, the, the Ray Borg Cup. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:44:31       Yeah. It was awful. We, we, what do you think about that though? Um, I actually, I don't have a problem with it because let me get you the other thing. Okay. Yeah. The thing about that I loved was when fucking, uh, Larry Robinson beat the shit out of Dave Schultz to start the Canadians run where he was just standing up to him was like, all right buddy, you want to play this fucking game? No, that's, I mean, you, you, you, you know my, I love that. You know, my hatred for the flyers. Oh, it's, it's legendary. Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh and Philly. They, they're in the same state. They are. That's Hatfield and McCoys. That's the only rivalry Pittsburgh has because people like when the bed, the browns, it's like, Oh, you're not Robert with your doormat. The ravens there like new and who, who cares? I mean, the flyers and the penguins.

Speaker 1:          00:45:16       We've, we used to be, oh, for Nixon we were like, oh, for Watergate in the spectrum until [inaudible] 88. I mean, it's just, I mean, that's it. And that's fans and their fans hated Lemieux, but then they actually cheered Lemahieu when it came back for cancer. They hate Crosby. Lot of fancy Crosby, but they hate Crosby and he cries be just sticks it to them. That's just the best people have to have a hateable face. Crosby has, he has sort of a Danny Ainge pouty face. That's that. Unless he's your guy, you're not going to like it. He's, he's the best. So it's like Lebron people just, there's haters. No, they're already, exactly, they're already going to fucking hate him. But he, he's so much east, so much easier to hate because there's something about his face. It'd be like Eli Manning would be so much more respected.

Speaker 1:          00:46:01       You'd be at least considered at Aaron Rodgers level, which I think he finally has after that second one. But like, it was, his face is, he just doesn't look like, you know, he doesn't have like that fucking, uh, everything's gonna be okay. I'm banging the fucking captain of the cheerleaders fucking, uh, in high school, maybe hooked up with a teacher, just said, fucking get out of that fucking five o'clock, shadow the gunslinger. He doesn't have that. Look. Luck has that look luck. Luck is a myth. I love the fact that, you know, something I realized, I, uh, cause the fact that actually like Andrew Luck and actually liked the cults. Now I actually realized that I never really even hated Peyton manning. I just hated the Tom Brady that wasn't getting the respect. Cause now like I'm watching, I'm watching Peyton manning with the Broncos and I'm rooting for him. And I actually think the Patriots, dude, I, man, I don't even know if we beat the dolphins at this point. It was close. But like I say, we already beat Broncos this year. We got a 50, 50 chance of, of, um, of, of losing fucking, uh, we play them in the playoffs because he, he's, he's so jelled with that team now. Oh, they're good. The Broncos on anybody, but I mean, anybody be Houston. Give me a break. I'm saying Houston, Houston. I mean like gimme your old school hatred of the Oilers. Oilers, not marijuana.

Speaker 1:          00:47:22       I used to have this shirt that had the little iron on from the mall that had a bum Phillips beating on the door that said Super Bowl

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       and Jack Lambert's in front of it. Just holding it back like, like a bomb knocking on this door. They can't, they won't let him in. Awe Dude, if you still had that, that's fucking legend. The sweat rings of visa right through. But uh, no, I mean I just used it. Certainly. I mean like, I mean this dude, these are down here. But I mean like I, the thing about the AFC to me is like, you always either go through Pittsburgh or you gotta go through the Baltimore Cause unless you, unless you can look James Harrison and Polamalu in the face and say we're going to cover both. Or you can look uncle ray in the face. Then you haven't really beaten, you haven't played man football and Houston Schwab, really. Schwab, Schwab. You think boot ballot check is Gail that Schwab go to the Super Bowl,

Speaker 1:          00:48:15       the patriots. So we we put up Gadi numb. I feel like we're the patriots right now. We're like how the colts were back in the day when, when pate manning, they would go 13 and three or 12 and four and then losing the first round. We don't lose in the first round, but like, like we're not going to play the bills. We're not going to play the jets in January. So who gives a fuck that we put up 50 fucking points. It inflates your stats and it makes everybody think that yeah, this juggernaut and the best thing our secondary has going for it is our running game because it can chew up the clock and keeps them off the field as long as possible because dude, we fucking let up like 300 yards to that bomb and fucking Buffalo, whatever the fuck his name is. Patrick. Yeah, he's out there like he's fucking

Speaker 2:          00:48:57       his contract. His horse, his country is horrible. His country, he's like 10 years for all this money. He's like just not even my strength and their contract with Ryan for his back deck

Speaker 1:          00:49:08       is that Ray Borg thing. Where you going to ask me like how I felt about it? Like you got to understand that that the Bruins fan base was so loyal. It didn't matter that we weren't winning cups. They were still going to sell it out and send it in. Those guys would just cheap fucks and they would never just make that extra move to get us over the top. And Ray stayed with us dude from 1979 to June of 2000 and he went through, I don't know how many rebuildings especially in the 90s when we really started falling off. He went through he fuck, what was he supposed to do? He had one more year left. There was no fucking way we were going to win it and that was they denim a solid. They traded them to a contender and they still had to go out and win it. The only thing I didn't like, and I know his heart was in the right place, but when he finally won the cup, he brought the cup back to Boston as like a show of, hey man, you know, here's the Stanley Cup. And it's just like, I know his heart was in the right place, but it was brutal. It's like, yeah, here's this thing you have in fucking one in 30 28 years at that point you're 28 years. But um, but so I don't have, I don't know.

Speaker 2:          00:50:15       It was cool. We went to Denver too, so it's like a new city. It wasn't like he went to like, oh, I would say the flyers and fan he went to like the rangers or someone that's just like, oh look, you've hated him for 30 years now here it's like, yeah, I don't forget, don't get mad at a laundry. Didn't even have a team like Ray Allen going to Miami. It doesn't bug me. Like people actually get like pissed. Like he was one of our guys. It's like he wasn't, he was, he was a free agent. He's, he's Jim Calhoun's guy. I don't, I don't, you know who my way more than me. I mean hoop is a hoop is and it's so sad. Talking about the demise, the NFL, the biggest demise. Demise of the big east. Why now? Huh? Big He spec college basketball. We was supposed to talk about that.

Speaker 2:          00:50:52       Oh, there's gonna be worth it. Yeah. Oh, we still can't. It's the gray. I used to watch that all the time. Fucking Georgetown. Chris Mullin. Pete. I mean, whenever people say they were the Washington, I read that book. Oh you know Nascar and no, he know what you know what invented ESPN was the big east because then because he had no stupid programming in the African, you didn't have like a Michelle Beale on in the afternoon talking. Let's see what Collin Coward things like who gives a shit what that guy thinks they, they just ran big east basketball games again in the afternoon. So what we need when you're out all night in high school playing, then you just stay home from school the next day and watch the big east all afternoon. My Grandmother, let me stay home from school at the time I just watched the big east. It was the best used to go to New York too.

Speaker 2:          00:51:36       And you will go to New York City, the tournament's. Yeah, absolutely. So you saw Ewing and I saw, I saw two years in a row, I saw the Patrick Ewing the year that they won the big east championship. We actually saw them in Laguardia, their whole team. And my dad's still pissed this day cause I became a Knicks fan because I love Pat Ewing didn't give me an autograph. My Dad wanted to sucker punch him. He didn't give you an autograph though, the whole team. So Bill Martin, who was the power forward back then gave me an autograph. But these guys were huge and Thompson was the biggest unwell. And Thompson goes, who wants lunch hoards? Remember horns Broadnax he the stack a hundred dollar bills like John Goddy. He's ripping them off, give him the, giving them the players. Jesus. And then two seconds later, Andre the giant walk past and I swear to God, I'm almost ready to call bullshit on that store size. What I can call my dad's, except he's at, he's like, you know, panicking over the coals over the Baltimore. I said colts. That's how old school I am. I getting ravens.

Speaker 2:          00:52:37       That's fucking awesome. I, you know he's already happy interrupted eight months ago. The work already. What happened to a bottle of a J and B or something? Whenever he's 18, he my dad like he likes to mix it up. I respect that. He's like, you know, he changed it up some days but he married some these, they never know. He's ain't gon go back to Andre. Oh always interrupt your great stories. So, so, uh, so literally, uh, just right after that we lock up Andre the giant walks bet. Honestly, John Thompson was bigger shoulder wise than him, but he walked by just how big he was. He actually duct and assign in Laguardia Airport signs. Like she can see from six 10? No, he's like seven, four. Who is Andrea? The giant. I'm sorry, I thought you were talking about Oh John Tops. Like, so yeah, he's backed up bill. Okay. All right. That's how he knows how to play center cause he worked with giant, they had a thing in sports illustrated one time and they would, they would just uh, they talked about, you know, all the

Speaker 1:          00:53:25       shit he would do as a joke. Like he would like somebody's car. He would like turn it around and face it and make it facing the other way. And they showed him like one night he allegedly drunk, drank like a hundred beers and they showed him when he holds a 12 ounce beer can in his hand. I liked the top of the can is flush with like if you, how old your hand sideways, the way you would hold a bear, like from the top of his hand to the bottom of his hand is the whole beer. He could fit a 12 ounce can and there it literally looked, it wasn't even like a pony. It looked like half a pony shot. So it's just like, yeah, this is like him doing like three swallows. He'd be done with it and still raise a hundred beers. It's still fucking respectful. But, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:54:01       he's one of the greatest biographies on a and e ever cause right. What he knew was gonna die at like four months left. He just went back to his hometown and just played cards with all of his friends until he died. Just like just bought like a cabin. Just like, yeah, come on over. I got a kegger playing cars I think is fucking on, you know, so you know how bad I hope I go out like that.

Speaker 1:          00:54:20       Cause you know this something to be said about dying peacefully, like in your, in your sleep and not realizing it. But there's also, there is something, if you've lived long enough and you've done, you know, he had the kids, you get you, you went after your dream, he did all that stuff. Bendis whatever did did shit you wanted to do and

Speaker 2:          00:54:38       was the most recognizable human being on the face of the earth. That's all. That's the only thing that Andre accomplished at his Wikipedia page. It was unreal. Yeah, he was, he was like bigger than Jordan, like literally bigger than I, they still have those fucking stickers that obey thing.

Speaker 1:          00:54:55       That's his face that they have all the way around that. But I would love to go out like that and just be like, when you're like fucking 85 and they just go, all right, you have three months to live. And you're like, cool. And enough of your friends a left. That's the one thing, dude, if you live too long, you fucking outlive all your friends. I just said, my grandmother, God bless her, she just, uh, she passed away just shy of 105th birthday. She was on her third set of front, like generation. Like she outlived, I mean, it's just unbelievable. I mean, uh, you know, she played bridge, kept her mind sharp and she had to just keep getting new friends. She outlived my grandfather by fucking 25 years, 25 fucking, they were married for 62 years. Mean granted they get, they eloped when they were like, you know, six,

Speaker 2:          00:55:42       it's 17 like way back in the day when you could back then you weren't, you weren't like, I think we're going to move in together for a while and then see how it goes. We're gonna get, we're gonna get the dog and if we can do that then yeah, yeah, yeah. No, they to do anything. You better be married. Lead.

Speaker 1:          00:55:58       Exactly. That was exactly his yesterday. They eloped. But yeah, so they made, cause I remember going to their 60th anniversary and that was like in the fucking eighties, dude. That was like 84 85 my grandfather passed in [inaudible] 87 and then she lived all the way to 2012 but that's the thing there is you, you actually, you end up like you, you outlived everybody. Somebody was telling me last night, I'm working with Todd Rex, who I got to get on this podcast. Todd, we're at t rex is one of the funniest motherfuckers he ever, oh, that's that story I told on this podcast. You know, he says, Hey, what do you say? It's him. You know, he says the Shit we, uh, we got pulled over cause his windows were too tinted or something. This guy pulls us over. We're on the 101. The Guy, you know, the guys talking, a little cops talking on the loudspeaker.

Speaker 1:          00:56:40       He goes, you know, uh, get off at the next exit. And that got us onto the one 10. Now we're on, we're on, we're on our way to the break improv. It's now on the one 10. We had to drive that quarter of a mile to get to the next fucking ice. When we get off, we literally like five miles away from where the fuck we were. We pull off and for some reason he has a stop under the fucking overpass. Right? So I don't know what we're underneath the thing. And Todd's been silly all week. Never seen any anchor. Now first time seeing him, like he's looking angry, right? And this baby face cop comes walking up and he didn't, Todd doesn't give a fuck. Puts the window down as the cop comes walking up, licensed, had ready. Good. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:57:15       What do you say, dude?

Speaker 1:          00:57:17       We just start fucking bursting out laughing and the cop stood there and he kind of looked her, I guess he watched comedy central. So you recognize someone in the car and then he recognized Todd and then he literally got on his fucking heels like, Oh shit, you guys are comics. And we just started laughing and he actually let us go. You know, I don't want to tell too much more because he end up being like a really good shit about it and I don't get the guy in trouble. And uh, you know, uh, but whatever.

Speaker 2:          00:57:40       Well he didn't find the heroin in the truck is what you're saying.

Speaker 1:          00:57:44       Maybe a few weeks later somebody you know, had a fucking moving violation and maybe he did something to make it go away. He was a good shit.

Speaker 2:          00:57:52       Oh, right on. Oh, there's nothing like good cops.

Speaker 1:          00:57:55       Well thank God he was a good guy because even if the guy was like a fucking old school, I'm going to shoot you and plan a gun on you taught that t rex still would've said the same shit. Well

Speaker 2:          00:58:06       those say some. That's the problem in Los Angeles on the west coast. San Francisco has got some old school city cops and they're cool and they let me off the hook on a couple of Duis. But I mean like, oh, Pittsburgh cops were the best for Duis. Just like, yeah, go home. Like y'all right, good. Get outta here. I mean, there's not black or white, old school. City cops are the best, cause they don't give a shit. They've dealt with everything. So he's like the young, like straight out of the academy. We were in Desert Storm Republican kids or need or collar or, or, or, or, or the broads. They're the worst cops. But the old school man, they don't give a shit. They're over. I mean, I mean, the worst was the one time I just, we just did the party in her ass off in New York City.

Speaker 2:          00:58:47       I'm coming back out in New York. I'm like interstate 80 or two 80, whatever, going through jersey, they get to Pennsylvania. And um, you know, when you're just in that morning, the sun comes up and you're still just gagged and just like drunk. And I was like 10 lanes of traffic. I didn't know I was actually in the 11th lane in the middle like I had, no, I wasn't paying. I didn't know. And I'm like, why is this cop just shitting? It stopped in the middle of the freeway here it was the center lane. What we win, like the breakdown lane, like I was in the middle, like whatever. It's like right next to the wall being like the mediums? Yeah, the median strip lane. Yeah, the that lane. It's not grass. It is pain but no, it's paved. Yeah. I'm thinking like what's a cop doing sitting there.

Speaker 2:          00:59:28       So then I pull over and I'm like, hi, swerve out of the way is he drived Uber pulls you over for pulls me over and at the time my card, my window didn't work so I had so like I went to open the door to get the, if I kicked it in theirs there was like, I think when they trade the car in the boot print of the New Jersey state trooper, we still in the car here. It was his first Monday back. He'd been hit by a drunk driver. He was out eight months. Oh No. But it was so early in the morning on a Monday morning and rush hour. He just couldn't believe I was drunk. Yeah. He, he's just like, what's wrong with you? Oh my God, you need to see as a, as a, you know, strung out. And he's like, or whatever. I said, he's like, oh, you need to know. I luckily had the Pennsylvania, nothing like out of state plates. Like I'm the asshole.

Speaker 3:          01:00:16       They don't have this stuff in our state. I didn't know you couldn't drive on the fucking medium strip. Pennsylvania

Speaker 2:          01:00:22       legal really got three lanes. You're like a big city officer. I don't really know. But that's, that's why I don't drink and drive ever anymore because I've been pulled up. I got literally got off.

Speaker 1:          01:00:30       That's why not. Cause you don't want to kill somebody because you don't want to. Well, I mean, I don't, I don't want to waste 10 grand.

Speaker 2:          01:00:39       That should be the thing. How much of that last shot cost me 10 grand? I mean, obviously I don't want to hurt anybody, but, uh,

Speaker 1:          01:00:47       for that shit and 89, December of 89 it was, it was a duty as a layup. It was a layup. I was so fucking drunk. I couldn't even get my shit. I wasn't even nervous. That's how drunk I was. I was like, ah, you got me. But that's, that's just stumbled through the, I blew a one nine mm.

Speaker 2:          01:01:02       That's the problem. They had the two problem nowadays though, it's like, yeah, you know, if you're that fucked up. And like I said, I was like five or six times out of my mind and then each time I left the hook, that's why I was like, you know what? That's it. I can't do it.

Speaker 1:          01:01:16       Right, right. Did you ever get busted for it or no?

Speaker 2:          01:01:18       No. I was always, I always like knew the cop or that my boss knew the cop. It was always in Pittsburgh. In Pittsburgh, it was five times legitimately like just off the hook. Like,

Speaker 3:          01:01:26       ah, Yay. I know you are blah, blah, blah

Speaker 1:          01:01:29       friends, friends. You know. One time I was, I was coming home from a Christmas party. I was working in this warehouse. We were under age and me and this other guy, sarge was his nickname. We got, we got absolutely fucking hammered and we were driving his mother's like Pontiac grand am you remember those things in the 80s. So what they look like with that plastic shit, they're like side, they were like this Chevy celebrity. Yeah. Except for pawn. Yeah. By Pontiac. Exactly. Yeah. So we were driving right through the center of town and uh, there was this jeep sitting at the red, old schooled CJ seven when they made him like out of fucking steel and the guys stopped at the red light. I got a beer between my legs, you know, drinking and the other guy's fucking, he's, we're hammered. We both see it, we see it. He starts to slow down. He just didn't press the brakes hard enough when we just sorta, yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:02:13       Oh Bam. Slam into it. Right.

Speaker 1:          01:02:16       And this shit at all. Like the brand new safety, it's to the edge and fucking drops down under the fucking there. Just the whole thing. Just crumpled up. I've slammed my head off the visor. Beer just goes all over me covered in fucking beer. We're right in the center of town in my hometown. Fucking cops have it and like, and, and it was so funny, the whole, the fucking grand am was totaled. There was like just a scratch on the back bumper. The CJ seven like I don't even think the fucking guy that keep barely noticed who was sitting in the GP got out. Right. Cops are there and like fucking two seconds they show. I'm literally covered in beer and the cop, you know, standing there, he goes, you guys been drinking like, Naw, Naw, I'm a just get it all right there. Fucking beer shower.

Speaker 1:          01:02:57       So we stand down. He goes, yeah. He goes, his car resale called get out of the car. We're like, fine. So I'm standing there on the sidewalk, on the other side of the jeep with a stooge sarge covered in, fuck, I'm, I'm, I'm so drenched in beer. I'm actually cold. It's like fucking like 30 degrees out and I'm soaking wet and I'm sitting there like an I already been through. I know I hadn't been through my shit yet. I ain't got arrested yet. So for drinking and driving, so I'm sitting there talking to sergeant, I'm just going to give a fuck they arrest y'all go to Cornell. I under oath that don't give a fuck. I'll say weren't drinking. I got you back. I'm fucking lifeway. He said all this shit. And then when I was done I turned and faced the street and there was a cop sitting in the cruiser staring right at me when I thought heard the whole thing.

Speaker 1:          01:03:43       To this day, I can't believe we, he didn't get fucking arrested. Yeah, that he didn't get fucking, I don't know what happened. I have no fucking idea. I had the empty beer, there was beer all over the windshield, all over me. Somehow we got out of it. He didn't get, he didn't get busted. I remember my dad picked me up and at that point I was smart enough to shut the fuck up and he picked me up. Dude. I mean, I am like swaying in the wind, the car smashed and I get in the car just covered in beer and he's just like a I doing you all right. I was just like, yeah, yeah, I'm good. I'm good. I didn't say shit. I think he wasn't mad at me cause I wasn't driving and we just fucking drove home. But yeah, but that was the 80s everybody that that's what happen.

Speaker 2:          01:04:22       They let you go are so cool about that stuff in general. It's like, oh it was, it wasn't my car. It wasn't like, yeah, shit happens. Like who? Like what dad hasn't been the passenger in a drunk driving incident? No, my dad,

Speaker 1:          01:04:32       my dad was in the navy and he was in a Frat, so he has, and he did that shit in the 60s so I remember when I finally got busted for drinking and driving, uh, my dad was totally cool. My mother was upset and that, that was their dynamic, like little shit. My Dad flipped out like Christ fucking clean up your room, but big shit. You got arrested for drinking and driving. He was just like, you all right. All right, cool. We'll fucking blah, blah, blah. My mother was the opposite. She let the little shit go and then the big stuff, I just remember, dude, I, I, my dad woke me up like they bailed me out of fucking jail and uh, take, I'm still fucking hammered. They fucking takes me home. By the time I get home, it's like fucking maybe like four in the morning I go to sleep.

Speaker 1:          01:05:16       My Dad wakes me up at seven in the morning. All right, three fucking hours later. I'm like, still just ham. I'm still going up. That's how drunk I was. And he goes, I think should go downstairs and uh, tell your mother what you did. You know that old school shit. So I fucking stumbled downstairs. Mother already knows. Hammered out of my mind. I'm like, should I get a drive? And she had this fucking look of pain on her face. It was brutal. It was fucking brutal. Then I went back upstairs and I probably slept til like two and a, I only got 45 days. 45 days is all you got back then. Now it's like fucking 90 days or like six months. We're not making light of this, by the way. People, we realize this is a serious crime, but

Speaker 2:          01:05:54       oh yeah, please take a cab. I mean, that's what gets me about the, when these athletes, like there's nothing I love better than being driven around. I mean like me and now magical actually have a thing like we wouldn't have, we have a race in our careers and obviously he's way ahead of the first one. Do a drive going on the daily show and one of the founders of this company, the podcast company, the record company that the CD salute is coming out on.

Speaker 1:          01:06:17       Please, please. By the way, everybody go on Amazon down. Can they download it anywhere?

Speaker 2:          01:06:21       Yeah, they can download it from Amazon. I believe in buy it from Amazon. It's on everything. But iTunes, literally everything. But I think, yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:06:29       and when Joe says, these are his classic jokes, like the first time I worked with you met you was in the punchline in San Francisco. Molly had booked you and she goes, you're gonna. I think you're going to like this guy to do it within five minutes. I was like, not only do I love his bitch, I fucking love this guy. You would like every one IA jokes, especially in San Francisco, how liberal it is would totally be offensive and you'd feel the crowd pull back and then you would just keep tagging the punchline with even more offensive shit and they just had to just give in. Like this guy just doesn't give a fuck. It was, I just remember that when you did about the chicks sucking Dick for something. What the hell was that when you would run from the side of the stage going, oh,

Speaker 2:          01:07:11       oh, that's sucking a dick. The difference between La and San Francisco. That's my differences. It was

Speaker 1:          01:07:22       so loud and it was so fucking graphic and everybody was just like pulling back and you just kept doing it. Running from side to side miming sucking a dick to get your fucking career going and it was just, it was so fucking over the top. It was, it was awesome, man. It was awesome. So I really hope that people are going to do the right thing and you know, something like, and, and speaking of doing the right thing, dude, uh, we, uh, me and some of my friends, we put together, uh, a benefit for the lake. Great. Patrice O'Neal in New York City tickets went on sale on a Thursday. And I know a lot of my podcast listeners are going to give me shit for not announcing it on Monday, but there's a reason why I wait until Thursday. Thursday was the one year anniversary of Patrice is death. And I just feel like the stuff that opie and Anthony did for him, like they just had like this just hours and hours of stuff of Patrice and this show is ridiculously amazing. Was that

Speaker 2:          01:08:14       the benefits show? Oh, the shell that we got to, we're doing that show could be held in the astrodome. Yeah. Is that good? I mean, it's really,

Speaker 1:          01:08:22       so it's sold out. It's sold out in 24 hours. And, um, you know, I was able to tell Patrice has mom and it's the happiest I've heard of since all this whole fucking awful scenario started. So I want to thank everybody, Ona fans and everybody who saw it on Twitter who went and bought tickets. Uh, you really fucking did a great thing by buying those tickets and it's going to be a fucking awesome show. So, um, anyways, um, I don't know where the fuck to go with that. So do another solid here. I know I didn't bring it up about the own Neil tickets. So if you want to fucking do with solid Joey, be salute from the all things comedy network. Do. We're an hour and seven. This has been fucking effortless. You've been a great fucking

Speaker 2:          01:09:04       yes. Thank you so much for me. Like hours. I forgot I was holding the microphone actually. It's like we're so used to a bullshitting.

Speaker 1:          01:09:12       Well, let's talk fucking Rosebell. Ah, well, uh, what do you think Stanford, Wisconsin. I was working with Nate Kraig last night. Uh, one of the guys you played hockey with these openings out there. He was, he was saying Wisconsin stinks. He's like, we stink.

Speaker 2:          01:09:24       Oh one like a thousand. I mean, you know, honestly about the Rose Bowl, the least the most, the thing I hate, the thing I liked the least about the rose bowls, the game, I actually, it's like a drag. Oh, there's going to be a game. Oh, you know, I mean it's like he's so much fun in the parking lot. I'm telling you, it's the,

Speaker 1:          01:09:44       by the way, people is a fucking golf course. You owe it to yourself at some point in your life. If you've ever wanted to go to the Rose Bowl, I'm telling you the tailgate is better and do it up. Bring somebody who knows how to cook, bring a bunch of booze and you just sitting there. It, dude, it's, it's, it's the greatest fucking way ever to start the year. All those years of doing stand up and going on stage where they gave the noisemakers out to the crowd before you go up and absolute hell and then like the fucking clock strikes, whatever. And you got to do the countdown. Okay, you fucking an animal's ten nine all those years of doing that shit and just, I don't even know how the fuck we ended up talking about it. We just bought it. That's the greatest.

Speaker 2:          01:10:23       We went to the, we went to that amazing Tennessee Ucla game when Tennessee was up like 20 to nothing, and we're like, we could leave at halftime. This game's over. We stayed, Ucla made the comeback and we were like, we gotta go to the Rose Bowl. This place is amazing. Right. And then we had the ultimate experience of the first year. Second year we brought along Jason. Jason had showed up and if you don't know Jason Law had, unfortunately he's not the trademark batting stance guy he got, he's like, it's like someone stole the formula and then he got screwed out of it. But law head can do the big red machine batting stances. Reggie Jackson, he won't let me post the Reggie Jazz. He said he was out of shape when he did it. Oh he it.

Speaker 1:          01:11:01       His debt. Reggie Jackson thing. He does this Reggie Jackson. He goes, when do you want to see them? Do you want to see him when he's younger or when he's older? He does the hall. He does the home run. He hit in the fucking all star game through. He stands up there. Right. I'm standing up now for people listening here. Obviously he fucking, when he does that thing where he brings the bat up and then fucking adjust the glasses through the second he did that I was like, it's fucking Reggie. The fact that you can do the whole big red machine, but to me my favorite is Pete Rose's. Uh, when he, when he beat ty Cobb, he does, he does him rounding first base, the clap, the, the handshake. It's anyway, he showed all the way to crying on his son shoulders. Yes he does. He does the whole awkwardness at first base.

Speaker 1:          01:11:45       And how great is it when he does like, he does like Pete Rose's stance stay where he's sitting there crouching down and he literally does. What about when he did? He did Willie McGee, he had his dying laughing, do a Willie McGee and when he does the swing, we're on the fucking ground laughing and then is classic quote. He goes, he loved the high fast ball, didn't it? I don't know Jake diddy, it looked just like him. So, so he joined the crew. Then we have Andrew during the Q does. Yeah. This is the fifth year universe analysts. This is it. Yeah. Universally. So let's get plenty of thank you. Think Stanford's is going to come in and pound them. Uh, I think Sanford has a better team, but you never know if they knew. They take like a month off. It's like, it's like when you don't go on stage for a month, you never really know.

Speaker 1:          01:12:26       Even though you know your jokes, you don't really, Sanford Sanford should burn those uniforms they played in last week. That flat black helmet. That was just fucking, oh, the black on black. Was that designed by Jay z? It was terrible. [inaudible] y'all because of Jay z did it. It would have been the shit. If you've seen the fucking bar place center, you know, knowing that this is a Celtics fan, we've got 17 fucking banners. We just went down to home depot, bought a bunch of cinder blocks and built a fucking square dude Barclay Center. The hardwood floor is supposed to be like a brownstone in Brooklyn. If you have a nice one in you redo it right. And the luxury boxes, I like mini fucking brown spots. I, I'm, I'm just kinda night into the cities with two teams. It just kind of like, you know what? Move somewhere else. Give, give somebody a team how you can be a lifelong knick fan. Go through coming this close to win in the championship with Pat Riley and the finger.
