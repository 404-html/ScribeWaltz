Speaker 1:          00:01          Hey, what's going on is bill burn his time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday? Uh, May 28th, may 28 2018 what's going on? How are,

Speaker 2:          00:17          Ooh,

Speaker 1:          00:22          oh, sorry. I just had to cry it out of me. Well, the motorcycle. Oh, Jesus.

Speaker 2:          00:38          Ah,

Speaker 1:          00:40          if only kids knew how to play basketball these days, and I'm actually talking about the Cavaliers and the Celtics. If we just played basketball in the end, if we just played basketball, we actually could have, why didn't think we'd win? Won Two games of that series. I was just like the Barn James is Lebron James. If we just fucking played, but I didn't see one pick and roll that whole fucking game. Maybe I missed it. Mean I was having a couple as I was sitting there just watching it. It's game seven, you know, stressing out ahead. I had to take the edge off the, you know, I was talking to a buddy of mine. I swear to God, if you take a fucking three pointer with nobody underneath and you miss that should be in the stat sheet as a turnover. That's all I'm going to say. Jesus Christ.

Speaker 2:          01:33          Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:33          This is what happens when everybody in the league is a fucking one and done guy. You know, they never took a physics class or I dunno, ever fucking had a ruler and fucking measured.

Speaker 2:          01:46          Okay

Speaker 1:          01:46          Dude, we would, there was like six minutes left. We're like down by, I don't know, four, five, six, seven points. We just start taking threes every time we go down the court. Like, like there was like five seconds left. Like the crowd was counting down. I don't know. Having said that, I got to tell you right now, Lebron James in my mind, Leapfrog Koby Bryant taking that team to the NBA finals.

Speaker 2:          02:13          MMM.

Speaker 1:          02:16          I just, I just think Colby would have been too far. He just didn't have the, he just didn't have that thing. He would just look at everybody on the bench, like the bumps they were and be like, what the fuck? And would just walk into the front office and be like, I'm not playing with this shit. Get me better guys or I'm fucking leaving. That's, that's how he got his title. He was also a beast. You know, I'm, I'm a Celtics fan, so I always have to shit on him a little bit. You know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          02:46          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:46          It's your me or shack. Um, the Black Mama, he's ice cold. Except when he was crying in the front office. Jesus belt. Can you stay on topic? Sorry. This has nothing to do with Bryan East. One of the greatest players of all fucking time. All right. I'm just a fucking butt hurts Celtics fan right now. Who's team way over a, so I said I should be happy. Um, but Lebron James, what the fuck that guy did? Jesus Christ. Um, unbelievable. Speechless. I died. I don't know. I don't know what to say. And uh, from what I've heard, the warriors are a little banged up. They got that game seven tonight. Uh, so I mean, I guess, you know, as, as a fan of basketball and more importantly, competition, I have to root for the Cavaliers or the Houston Rockets. I mean, do you just, you can't root for, uh,

Speaker 3:          03:46          a pile on team unless they're playing another pile on team. Isn't that how it works? And admittedly, the Celtics had one in 2008.

Speaker 1:          03:53          Okay.

Speaker 3:          03:53          I didn't watch that team the whole year. You know, I watched during the playoffs and we played the Lakers and I was like, all right, I'll pile on t verse your pile on team,

Speaker 1:          04:02          whatever. I'll do it. Um, but I, congratulations. Congratulations to the Cleveland Cavaliers. Bron shapes. Without a doubt. I mean, you gotta I mean, I would put that guy like, I dunno, it's hard. It's hard when you start talking to Oscar Robertson, Bill Russell, and I don't know where the fuck he is, but he's passed Koby and the modern era. I'd have to say that it's him and Jordan and a, I know a lot of your young kids right now who didn't watch Michael Jordan. Uh, you know, you go back and you'd go into Youtube when you watch his highlights and that type of that guy, he literally changed the game. Um, I can't, I can't stress that enough. Like the game changed. He didn't dominate the game the way Colby did. He literally changed it like, Oh, I didn't know you could fucking do that. I had no idea you could do that. My only knock against the Bronch, James is what? He fucking block that shot and then just stood there, basking in his own amazing, amazing amazingness or whatever. And then the announcer Jackson goes every once in a while I said something like, every once in a while you make a play. That's so unbelievable. You have to stand there and admire it. And I was sitting there like the oldest old man ever go and like that,

Speaker 3:          05:18          that Yolo fucking, Yo, I can't even believe how, I can't even believe how amazing I am.

Speaker 1:          05:23          The fuck down the court, you know, you can't really say to help out your teammates. He had a ball in his back, but just what the fuck was he doing back there? Standing there for like 20 minutes like, do you understand what that dumb look on his face? Like he just stopped a Scud missile. You blocked his shot. I Dunno, I am officially, this is how old I am. Okay. This is how I was actually watching old school TV shows and like I turn 50 next as much as it's fucking with me, I wouldn't change what I was born to live now as a younger person. And I'm for the simple reason that when I was a kid, this is what a theme song sounded like on a TV show.

Speaker 2:          06:16          Sounds like a fucking porno.

Speaker 4:          06:26          All people playing that come on, get to the fucking horns,

Speaker 1:          06:36          a nice big blue, white, whatever. You knew somebody was getting fucked up and those were all fucking people. You know something after they played that theme song, they didn't stand in the studio admiring and what the fuck they just did. Other than that, I love Lebron James. I do. I'm just breaking his fucking boss. And I also love the city of Cleveland. And I even still loved the city, Cleveland, even after about five or 6,000 Cleveland Cavalier fans. What APP? Me sending me fucking all kinds of shit over social media like, like they weren't, they didn't have a Cleveland steamer in their fucking pants. Whatever the fuck. I hate those stupid jokes, by the way.

Speaker 4:          07:17          You know what a dirty stage edges. No, I doubt and yet keep the job to yourself. It's all the same fucking egg. When you stick your Dick in his shit and you shove it up her nose and you go, God bless you, but you say it in Spanish.

Speaker 1:          07:30          It was water, bubbler, jokes. Those are all jokes for people who don't not to make a move. Right. Did you stand there? This one's cool. Would you stick your dick and you fucking polar comm? Um Oh, that gives me do shells. I hate, I always fucking hated those jokes. Anyways. Oh my God. We used to trash Patrice when he used to do those jokes on stage. We still have Trisha doing street jokes. You're doing street jokes. Um, anyways, uh, I'm all over the fucking map here. Sorry man. I'm shaking off a game. Seven loss. Um, I was just psyched that we got to these two conference finals. Then all of a sudden it's like, Holy Shit, we could actually win this fucking thing. Then I'm like, and if the warriors lose to the rocket, so who gives a fuck about the rockets? We always beat the rockets in the file.

Speaker 1:          08:26          We beat him in [inaudible] 81 and 86. Um, we're going to have the TRIFECTA. I, oh, Billy started dreaming anyways, so it was Cleveland Flint fans who were talking all this crazy shit. All right. Yeah. You're lying to yourself if you forgot about that. Jason Tatum Dunk on Lebron James. Okay. That right there is what's known as the changing of the guard. Okay. That was like the first time Shaq having problems with his big toe. Like that's the beginning of the end. Okay. And a new chapters coming in and it's dressed in green and white. All right. See, but this one fucking guy, I trashed them on Twitter. He gave me some shit and he had his stupid Cavaliers Jersey, you know, and has had on, you know, with this game seven look at his face. I said, but he was wearing his seatbelt.

Speaker 2:          09:19          Okay.

Speaker 1:          09:20          I Dunno. Some Cleveland plans when they look up on the rafters and they start counting banners, they forget that an eastern conference championship is not an NBA title. Alright. And a division title banner is, is literally, that's like up. Like that's something you give to a millennial. Like, all right, you did something. Um, I don't know what else we got like five people gave me shit. Why am, why am I doing this right now? Why am I being so childish? Oh God, we were right fucking there. We were right there. Um, anyways, and I'm not gonna do that dumb shit of like boom, cause so and so was there. Your won fair and square. Everybody gets heard. Lebron's heard, right? You've probably all fucked up carrying those people. Anyways, congratulations. That really didn't sound like a congratulatory fucking 10 minutes here, but that's, that's what I was trying to get to. Congratulations to Cleveland. All right. Even like eagles fans started giving me shit. It's just like, dude, are you fucking serious right now? Good Lord. And if Philadelphia, when did Philly ever start talking shit about sports? This is what I want all of you guys to do. What is the championship combination to open your city county championships? Ours is five six eight 17 ah, that unlocks to safe and all the rigs pour out. What happens in Philly?

Speaker 1:          10:51          Philly is two, two, three one.

Speaker 2:          11:00          Okay,

Speaker 1:          11:00          go fuck yourselves. You fucking green. Cons. You hang around long enough. You're going to fucking win one. That was another one. This guy was giving me shit on the Celtics won like 11 championships and four there was anybody. It's like, all right, well since then we won six. Stop talking about the Cavaliers. Like they were an expansion team. They bet in the league for almost 50 seasons. Fucking Miami Heat showed up in 88. I think they want more than the Celtics. Well they went one did they been for they want four. Um, I dunno. Why am I trashing cities? I don't, I don't want to try. I don't give a fuck about Philly. I like Philly. I like Cleveland. I like all of this shit. I'm just fucking, you know, it still stinks that I lost. I suck. I said, I wish, I don't even fucking hate the Yankees anymore. You can't hate them. They're all basically they added one free agent. Other than that, it's whole team. It's just a, I think I hate the Lakers to the most just because I live out here,

Speaker 2:          12:00          you know?

Speaker 1:          12:01          I'd say that was, yeah, probably cause, cause I live out here and then Canadian fans, but they just, you know, chasing their own fucking tails so they don't even matter anymore. I don't know. I guess not. I guess I'm just not mad anymore. I mean, I'm still mad, but I guess it probably is childhood issues.

Speaker 1:          12:18          Wow. Well, why the fuck do I even watch sports? All right guys. I'm going to end this podcast and I just had an epiphany. None of this matters. Um, and he wasn't fucking with you. God Damn it. Oh God. Oh, what game seven state game. Seven loss stinks. It really stinks. Jesus fucking Christ. Um, I'm not gonna lie to you. I mean, I, I haven't watched the, and so long. I know I watched the Celtics like all last season I watched him and uh, I just, I just cannot get over running down the court and just fucking stopping and you have to, your teammates haven't even settled it. Just pull it up and taken it three and just now getting yanked out of the fucking game. The only thing that makes that okay as the other teams are doing it too, it's like watching this high skilled like game at the YMC, you know, there's no plays. Everybody just met each other, you know, you just fucking yacht. They're trying to burn calories. Um, alright bill, let it go. Okay, I'll let it go. I'll let it go. How bad ass is that fucking theme song? It's from the streets of San Francisco by the way. I've been trying to find the original one, but I went best I can find is the Henry Man sees man Sini version of it.

Speaker 1:          13:31          That was the heyday of the white cop chasing the minority actor down the street. And the only role that he was going to get that decade, you know, um, they should, they should go back and they should do a documentary on all those fucking guys, you know, like who has the record? Like what black actor in the 70s had the record for the most times he did a scene where he was running down an alley, being chased by the cops. You know, when you get to the fence, that's the scene I always wanted to do. You get to the chain link fence, you get like, you know, a couple of rungs up and then they grab you back. You're like, Nah, they fucking drag you off when you go and freckles. Huh? You know, hurry is something. Sorry man. I'm just not going nowhere.

Speaker 1:          14:24          Um, anyways, congratulations. And other congratulations. I'm just, I'm just being, this is me in a very generous, thankful mood. It's Memorial Day, right? Thank in the troops, the people that made the ultimate sacrifice, you know, it's a bit of a drop off to thank a fucking professional basketball team after you thank the troops. But, uh, you know, congratulations to Daniel Ricardo winning his first race, a Formula One race in Monaco. How about that? That's the race I want to go to. And it's probably the most boring f one race cars. That race is all about qualifying. That's the race. Whoever fucking wins DePaul position. I mean, they're racing in those little ass fucking street. You know what I mean? You know why those streets, it's so small over there. It's not because the city is so old and used to just ride a horse down. It's because that's a sovereign city and that's the Illuminati money.

Speaker 1:          15:22          And they liked the bitches skinny. They're like, I'm young and thin. Okay. So that's, that's their locked the door test. If they can walk down the street without the hips touching either building, uh, then they'll have their current wife, uh, disposed of. I think that's what they do. And then they stay young. Evidently somebody sent me this fucking thing in here. I think this is how they stay young. Somebody wrote to me said for skin injections, the old bill, what gives in Hollywood? Uh, my girlfriend show showed me a video of an actress on Ellen talking about injecting for skin cells. Imported from Korea. Korean circumcisions. Sorry. Into her face to look young.

Speaker 1:          16:11          Get out of their bill. We can't have you injecting dick skin into your face for roles. The fuck's going on? Um, what do you mean what the fuck is going on? We are the leaders of how to stay young out here in Hollywood. Okay. What do you, what do you think you'll Rogaine came from? What do you think you're at? Your Grecian formula is going to come from. Huh? What do you think all your workouts come from? They come from Hollywood. All your fad diets. That's us. Okay. We came up with all of that. You know why? Cause you consider always trashing us. You hold us to a higher standard. Okay? You look to us to see what the future of vanity is. You look to us to make it okay.

Speaker 1:          17:02          Okay. Potok started out here. Now look at, it's all over the country. You're all fucking doing it. All these real fucking housewives, Huh? He all made fun of us and now look at you. Oh he all on steroids. You get in the fucking good hair plugs because people out here in Hollywood, you know had the decency to stick those ant legs into their fucking heads to let these doctors make mistakes with their own face until it becomes safe enough that you could sneak into some fucking back alley and get the same procedure done to you when you start getting your man tits. All right sir. How dare you make fun of Hollywood. Thanks to our self involvement. You'll be able to wear a tank top welling to your sixties you're welcome sir. I mean, I dunno who's more fucking arrogant.

Speaker 2:          17:50          Cleveland Cavalier fans talking shit like they own the NBA when all they ever do is show up in the finals to be the Washington generals. Whoever the fuck they sift that one you when they want. Um

Speaker 1:          18:07          Huh. Or you regular fucking people who sit there and go on these fucking celebrities. They need to be taken down a peg and Yada Yada. Yad At fucking Yada. Let me tell you something there. Grill master you have to their foreman grill or whatever type of fucking cookery you have and your God damn kitchen.

Speaker 2:          18:26          Huh?

Speaker 1:          18:28          With your little fucking makeover and you sad little fucking house, you know? And then you turn on the TV to see what a dream looks like and who's standing there? Me and my bald fucking head.

Speaker 2:          18:43          Okay.

Speaker 1:          18:44          By the way, I'm not gonna lie to you guys for my 50th birthday. I think I'm going to give myself hair plugs. I think I've earned them. Okay. I'd like to brush my teeth, you know, and not stare at the sink. Okay. I would like to look up and see something that I like and you know, I just want to live my truth.

Speaker 2:          19:07          Okay.

Speaker 1:          19:07          You know, that's all that I'm doing. And Hey, you know, if hair plugs are going to make me feel better than I say, I should do it. And you know something, I think it's time that I gave myself permission to look sexy again. Um, why in the fuck would you ever

Speaker 2:          19:31          like,

Speaker 1:          19:32          I could see if she, if she had American for skin cells. All right. But like, why would you get for skin cells imported from a country that we're really not getting along with? At least not half of it. You know, why don't you just get your botox from China? It's probably where it's from. Right? Said made from China, said um, yeah, people are out of their fucking minds.

Speaker 2:          19:57          MMM.

Speaker 1:          19:59          I am doing my damnedest to stay in shape, but I am going to age fucking naturally. That's it. You know what I mean? Other than the I got a varicose vein in my left leg, you know, it looks like a God damn roadmap to fucking Albuquerque. You know, I might get that taken out at some point. I keep meaning to get around to it, but I never wear shorts, you know, cause I respect people, you know, all these fatties out there wearing half shirts acting like they're brave. You're not, you discussed it and everybody should point at you. Like we're in the invasion of the body snatchers. Okay. I don't care that you fat, but you know, you put on put on a whole shirt and maybe it is a whole shirt. Maybe you just ate so much that now we can see your belly again. You know, like you ever see a woman with big tits were and a half shirt and then when you turn around to look at her it, it goes all the way down to her ass in the back. And it's like, oh, that's not a half shirt. She just has giant tits. She can't help it.

Speaker 1:          20:51          She can't help it. It's not her fault. Um, anyways, uh, I took my daughter, we went out for a walk today and we went up, we went on a hike and uh, you know, I was pushing the stroller the whole way up. What a great workout. And you go up the fucking hills pushing a stroller, you know, figure that's an extra 25 pounds right there. Just pushing it away, pushing it up the Goddamn Hill. I saw this guy hiking with his daughter and his son is, it got a little older. I thought it was really cool. It was like, man, I'd love to do that someday. You know? Although his son was still wearing his pajamas, I was just like, come on man. You got to tell him, put his clothes on. But then I was thinking like, Dang, I leave my favorite pajamas and I would've came to ah, right. All right. All right son. Now I wouldn't and I'd be like, all right, well you wear them in the house.

Speaker 1:          21:45          Oh, whoa. Where am I? All right then we're not going hiking. Well, join the club, join the club. Um, I, I really don't even know what the Fuck I've been talking about it. I'm just trying to fill up time here. That's all I do here in this podcast. If you new to it, I'll tell you right now, I've never been so offended in my life that someone actually has the audacity to make fun of the vanity of Hollywood and the Boston Celtics from two of the most simple combination championship combination cities ever. What is Cleveland? Cleveland is zero. The Indians. One in 48. I'll throw another one in there. Let me, they, they'd fucking woman. It's like, they're like zero one, two. You know when it comes to championships, I swear to God there should be a Fisher price tag hanging off the ones in Cleveland and saying your children, when it comes to success out pill, why would she go back into that bucket or hate?

Speaker 1:          22:48          Cause it's Gig. It's fine. I must use the line from bread. Darn. It keeps me warm. All that heat is going to burn you up. Keeps me warm. Powers booth was it powers but was power powers booth in that? Um, what a fucking name I powers booth. You guys see Morgan Freeman gotten a little bit of trouble this week. I, you know, nobody said how fucking cool it is than an 80 year old guy could still fuck. You know what I mean? I mean, why can't we look at the bright side of sexual harassment in a plus? He's a, he's 80. I mean what, what do you think he's going to do? I mean, you stop listening to music a couple of years after high school. You get married, you have a kid, you don't know what the fuck's going on. This guy doesn't know what's going on. Wait, what are you gonna do next to make fun of the playlist on his flip phone? He's in his fucking eighties Oh my God. I was so afraid. I was so afraid when that guy pushing a hundred that clip

Speaker 3:          23:48          where he was saying, I wish I was there. I thought he was making fun of Michael Caine going, I wish I was there when you stuck your foot in your mouth saying, are you pregnant? And the woman wasn't. That's how I took it. I have no idea, but what would I know? What would I know about male and female relationships? Okay, what the fuck would I know? What was I looking up again? Okay. CLEVELAND, the Cleveland Indians. This is such a country thing to do after they just had success to talk about their entire pastures, but this is all I got. This is what she listened to me is a sad, pathetic man taking swings at people who are no longer in the room. They've moved on Cleveland Indians. I want to, I want to coin that. What is the, what is your, your your combination what? Cleveland Indians. World series [inaudible] chips and I put it plural out of respect world series titles too. So they got two world series one NBA zero Superbowls and we'll give them the fucking Columbus blue jackets with zero Stanley cups. So the combination to Cleveland is zero zero one two.

Speaker 3:          25:04          All right. Do you understand stand we've one more super bowls. Then you have, why am I doing this? This is so checked because it's fun. I'm not doing it to all Cleveland. I'm just doing it to the fucking, how do you only went to Superbowl? I mean two world series and you have like 58 retired numbers. What'd you retire the numbers for? For, for having a fucking jumping on the grenade and joining that franchise. Oh, Bell. I liked the Cleveland Indians. You don't really as I kind of just had a great weekend and I don't really have anything to talk about. Uh Oh by the way, did anybody see the highlight? I, I, I, I don't know what I did. I tried to favorite that thing on, on uh, my Instagram page, which by the way, I, I suck at it. Like, I'm not making these stupid videos go like, hey man, I'm in the grocery store to fucks up with cantaloupe. Check me out at the San Jose Improv.

Speaker 2:          25:54          Okay.

Speaker 3:          25:54          Did you see that fucking Guy Moto GP race? Where that fucking guy, I can't even describe what a, he basically he's stick, they're all coming around the corner were all two inches from each other. One guy wipes out.

Speaker 2:          26:08          Okay.

Speaker 3:          26:09          Okay. And his bike lands perpendicular to the guy behind him. All right. And the guy just hits the gas and drives up over it. Like a fucking stud man.

Speaker 2:          26:25          Yeah,

Speaker 3:          26:25          he's going a hundred and something miles an hour. He goes flying through the fucking air and then lands on gravel and somehow saves it. It doesn't go down and continues on. Oh, and by the way, like his airbag popped. I don't know if you've ever seen those guys when they get off. The bikes were after they wipe out their arms looking weird. Like then like there were these weird, you know when somebody gets knocked out in their arms kind of go, oh they kind of stick out. They do that a little bit. And I, I'm, I'm guessing that's because the airbag popped and they can't bring their arms back down. This guy's airbag popped, making them less aerodynamic. He continued to ride the race and he's just fucking bad ass bad ass. You know what I miss? I miss the fucking Indy 500 after interviewing Danica Patrick, who by the way was so fucking bad ass.

Speaker 3:          27:11          And um, I think it's really cool that she's retiring, you know, retire while you still have some years left, you know, it doesn't look, uh, you know, you don't want to limp out of the league. Like fucking, you know, Brett Farve, you know? Yeah. I don't really think of those last few years, but it's just like, dude, you're in there, you're a hall of fame. You one of the greatest ever. What are you doing? Um, you want to get out before then? Um, and then she also had like a vineyard or something like that. It's really a, that's the way to do it. That's the way to get out of show Biz. You know, I think the smothers brothers did that.

Speaker 2:          27:50          Okay.

Speaker 3:          27:50          Like didn't even announced their retirement. They, from what I heard, I was working in Vegas. They did their last show at the Orleans casino. Didn't say it was the last show. Just said thank you. Good night and just fucking went retired to the vineyard. How fucking bad. I mean that is, that's that's it. Like with Jordan hit that last shot as a bowl. Smothered brothers didn't come back to play for the fucking wizards.

Speaker 3:          28:19          Um, all right, so Celtics lost a game seven and I am in the last days of my forties. I am basically sitting here with a bottle of tampons in some Kleenex.

The fucking so always sunny in Philadelphia. Spacing on the guy's name. He was awesome in one. Flew over the Cuckoo's nest. He was in kindergarten cop. No, he wasn't. He was in twins.

Speaker 2:          34:59          Okay.

Speaker 3:          35:00          It was in romancing the stone, I think.

Speaker 2:          35:03          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          35:03          Keep thinking Alan Alda.

Speaker 3:          35:08          Fuck he got drunk on a talk show was hilarious. Louie Depalma. Do you know what I'm talking about? Anyways? Uh, all read the force. Get injections, the wine country advice. A Billy Barolo breath. Heard you talking to Danica Patrick about why you said you were Nia. Want to do a wine country trip? Thought I'd give you some ideas. I grow grapes and make wine for a small producer in Sonoma county and I've been in the wine industry for 10. All right. You have established credibility, why can't you just tell me where the fuck to go? Rather than reading me your entire resume, you self-involved jackass. How soon before this guy has fucking Korean for skin cells injected into his fucking gray teeth, make his teeth white again after all that Merlow um, I am not drinking Marlo. I guess that fucked up the whole Merlow industry. I like Merlow.

Speaker 3:          36:06          Um, first of all, don't do Napa. It's Douchey as fuck. Uh, honestly you only need to drive a couple hours into Santa wine as valley for an awesome weekend of wine tasting. They have all kinds of great wines there, but if you guys do want to come all the way up to the quote real wine country, I really do think Sonoma county is better than nappy Napa County. The mistake people make is going to the actual town of Sonoma, which is boring and pretty shitty. Uh, the move is to stay in Hell's dude, you're hooking me up. Helzberg which is in northern Sonoma county. Shit. Loads of excellent tasting rooms and restaurants just walking around town plus tons of other wineries nearby to drive to slash hire a car. Napa is only an hour away at most, so you could always cruise over there for a day. If there are some specific Napa wineries you want to check out, it's okay if there's some specific ones you want check out.

Speaker 3:          37:09          But seriously, Fuck Napa blown up way over price wide, most of them, which aren't great and they can't even grow Pinot noire over there. It's too hot and Pino is the best wine there is. Once you learn to notice and appreciate the little details. Bonus fact Les Claypool has a winery here. He makes Pino because he knows what's up. I fucking love Les Claypool shape baby. Do you want to fucking drink wine with me? Um, other football leagues. Well thank you sir. I'm going to fucking copy and paste that and send it to my wife and see what she says. Or other football leagues. Hey William Shit. Just one. Oh, you know what? I missed the Liverpool Cup final. I'll have to catch their next game next season. Evidently, I don't even know who won. I would think, uh, Liverpool one a loss because I didn't get any fucking, hey dude, I hope you watched your adopted team one Liverpool Cup final. Uh, Geez against Madrid. Where the fuck is it over here? Why is my cable so slow? Not Cable. My Internet.

Speaker 2:          38:22          Okay,

Speaker 3:          38:22          come on. You fuck hoes? Come on. Come on.

Speaker 3:          38:29          Why? Well, I don't fucking know. Oh, you don't? Never, definitely. My computer is allergic to soccer. Uh, okay. Other football leagues. Hey William shivers was wondering since Johnny Manzel has made the switch, if you ever watch any CFL, I love the CFL. CFL is so fucking underrated. CFL is better than college football. That's a bunch of college all starts that weren't quite good enough to make it to the NFL. But what? Hawaii, any college football team, bigger field. It's exciting. I don't even know what the fuck's going on. And there's only like six tapes, right? The Edmonton Eskimos. They're like your Washington Redskins, right? Are they getting pressured to change that name? The Calgary rough riders, the BCA Eagles on as the Calgary stampede, right? Isn't it the Winnipeg nostril stickers or something like that? Something about the cold weather out there. I don't fucking know. Um, oh, by the way, tonight's the first night of the Stanley Cup finals, right?

Speaker 3:          39:34          Stanley Cup final, not the NBA finals. Stanley Cup final. And congratulations to the fucking Vegas nights and the Washington capitals. That's going to be exciting to see the team win. But uh, I'm really pulling for the capitals. I'm a big, I'm a big fan of a fucking, what's his face say? Oh, a vet chicken. You know, Russian players get a bad name in the NHL. Uh, cause I guess a number of them could give a fuck about winning a Stanley Cup. You know, who is that guy, that sign, you know, it was fucking amazing. Played for the Atlanta thrashers. Got a giant contract with New Jersey was just like, yeah, you know, I just don't give a fuck. And he left, went back to play hockey and uh, Russia like the Stanley Cup does, like that's the stereotype that it doesn't mean shit to these guys. All right. So guys like you know, Mulkin in Ovechkin got a bear.

Speaker 3:          40:25          The, the, the carry a load of these other Russian constant I guess didn't give a shit. So I'm rooting for that guy. You know, Trump probably wouldn't like it then I'm rooting for Russia, but I want to see him. Uh, I want to see him win one. Um, we should, we shall see. But what's his face? Uh, Vince Neil Motley Crue, one of my favorite groups of all time. He's out in Vegas and he's become a big fucking Vegas Knights Fan. So no matter what, I'm going to be happy whoever wins. Um, anyways, other football leaks, uh, I would absolutely watch the CFL. The biggest differences. Our field is longer, long and wider with bigger end zones in field goal posts are on the goal line. Uh, we also function on a three down system. I'm probably a poor source for the rules, but hey, I'm just some jackass right into the podcast. Well, let me know when it starts. Ps, you should see a Saskatchewan rough riders game. We are considered one of the best football fan bases around and do a show in Saskatoon too. While you're at it, go fuck yourself and have a lovely day. I did. I did a show. That's how I know you guys go. Ooh. I did a show in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.

Speaker 3:          41:37          I did one in Saskatoon and Regina that steady, that rhymes with fun. I never need to hear that again. Um, I'll definitely be back. It's fucking God's country up there. And you can see the northern lights like all year round. A boyfriend found out I cheated on my ex husband. Oh boy. Uh, Billy Babushka Lips. What the fuck is Babushka I gotta look that up.

Speaker 2:          42:03          MMM.

Speaker 3:          42:06          Liverpool quest for glory ends in tears. Is Gareth Bale wonder goal breaks heart. Oh No. Oh, I had enough sports pain for the fucking weekend.

Speaker 2:          42:20          What happened? Okay,

Speaker 3:          42:26          I'm clicking on the link. Why won't you do anything? Alright, what was I looking at? Babushka it's one of my favorite words of all time. I don't even know what it means.

Speaker 3:          42:45          Oh, Billy Babushka. That was a wrestling manager. That would be my name. Alright. Should I end my relationship, my boyfriend of a year and a half fun out. I cheated on my ex husband. He's not being a huge dick about it. Just passive aggressive whenever shit goes down, which is not too often. He's a little bit, he's a little on the sensitive side, but until he found out about my past, that's what I liked about him. He's a math computer guy, not an Alpha male. Uh, well, you know, if you get what you pay for sweetheart, he does not care what people think about him and he has a unique sense of humor. His family definitely has mental issues. His Dad refused to stay on dialysis and died when he was in high school and two older brothers off themselves when he was a sophomore and a senior in college. Jesus fucking Christ Dayton, the Hemingways here. I'm in my mid thirties and have a good job.

Speaker 3:          43:43          He's two years older and has a great job, owns a house in a good neighborhood. No kids involved. Our relationship is the best I've ever had. I feel a lot of love recently though, after he found out I sense a lapse. He never wants to talk about it. I could never imagine myself cheating again. I got married to my ex too young, but now that my baby making years are coming to an end, I don't know what to do. Should I stick around to see if we get back to where we were or move on? Go drink yourself. Um,

Speaker 2:          44:20          okay.

Speaker 3:          44:21          Yeah, I don't fuck it. I, you know, I don't know.

Speaker 2:          44:25          I don't know. Um,

Speaker 3:          44:30          just be like, look, I

Speaker 2:          44:32          you ever going to be able to get, just ask him, are you going to be able to get past this?

Speaker 3:          44:38          You know, here's the thing. You know, you did do it so

Speaker 3:          44:46          it gives you shit. I kind of got to roll with it. I guess I have gives a fuck. Yeah. I just rolled with it for a little bit and just see a full fucking sensitive, sensitive are there. Um, I know people always say that, you know, if you fucking cheat, you're going to cheat again. I, and I don't know. It all depends on where you are in your life. Who the fuck you're with? I don't know about that one. Has there been a study on that? I have no idea. I honestly don't know what to tell you man. Um,

Speaker 3:          45:19          maybe you could turn it into some sort of math joke. Uh, dating older women. Dear Billy blue balls. My name is prince. I am 23 and about to be 24 in about a month. I am in a relationship with a 44 year old woman. Yeah, this is easy. Get the fuck out of it. You're not in a relationship. You're banging a 44 year old woman. Uh, now I know what you are thinking. Mommy issues much now. And I don't end fucking sentences with the word much. Nonetheless. I just said, hey, that's too much. I don't know. There's some fucking, I hate that. Something something much. You know what else they, when I hate, uh, so and so, and then at something in quotes me something in quotes in the year. Always the coolest fucking person. Ah, Bill, you're all get over it. People talk differently now. All right?

Speaker 3:          46:12          We remember when you were young and everybody would yell, not, you didn't think that was annoying to older people. All right, you got me now I know what you are thinking. Okay, now I know what you're thinking. Mommy issues much yet. That is part of the reason I am with her, if I'm being honest. Well, there you go. Gotta love honesty. We have been dating for about five months now and things are good, but there are things that irritate the hell out of me. What her fucking silver pubic hair. Uh, like she thinks some of my views on life and other things that are odd. I honestly think it's because she grew up in a totally different times. Yeah. It's called a generation gap. If he gets your face out of her gap and look at the fucking calendar. Sorry. Um,

Speaker 3:          46:55          we had been dating for about five months now and things are good. No they're not. But there are things that irritate. Okay, I read this. They're not good, sir. You need to get the fuck out of this. This is not going to end well. Some point you're going to want to have a kid, all right. And her vagina is going to be in a fucking museum. Um, anyways, uh, with the fuck wasn't something that's definitely different time than me, but some of it is that she isn't into science or she better be if going to try to keep herself

Speaker 1:          47:30          young. Like we got into an argument about high fructose corn syrup because she said it's only sugar until I prove to her that it's not just sugar and she thinks that's not really science.

Speaker 2:          47:42          Okay.

Speaker 1:          47:43          Yeah. I thought you were into science. You're just reading facts that scientists figured out that's not science.

Speaker 1:          47:49          Right? I mean, I could, I mean the fact that I could look that up and just go, here it is. That's not scientist. If I can figure it out, it's not science, sir. Um, and she thinks my fear of chemicals in our food is odd as well. It's hard being with someone that doesn't get me another thing in another thing in a black male. Oh, I'm a black male and she's a white female, so she doesn't really understand how it is to be a black man in this day. And that Jesus fucking Christ, sir. How many red flags do you need?

Speaker 2:          48:24          Okay.

Speaker 1:          48:25          You know, and, and she's, uh, she got fired from the Police Department for dropping the n word. Other than that, I think I really liked her. Sarah, what the fuck are you doing? I'm going to keep going here and did jump taught, uh, and did jump topic. Uh, sex with her is good, but it's like we only have sex once and it sucks. She says it's because I leave or to, so a, okay. I'm not, I leave her to soar as you know. Is there anything worse than a big fucking Dick? Nincompoop I can't fuck it. I know at 1:00 AM 1:00 AM I supposed to do with you, sir? You and your porno cock need to fucking date somebody, uh, you know, from, from, she's almost twice your age.

Speaker 2:          49:09          Okay.

Speaker 1:          49:10          And she listens to country. But this is such a fucked up email. I don't believe it. I'm calling bullshit on that one.

Speaker 2:          49:16          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          49:17          you kind of did a slow roll on me. You had me, you had me, you had me, and then you sat and I'm black and I got a big deck ad she saw. I don't believe it. I don't believe it.

Speaker 2:          49:28          Okay.

Speaker 1:          49:29          Maybe it's true. He goes, I want to have excitement and shit in our relationship and she just doesn't bring that to the table. I like her a lot and we watched documentaries together. I'm sure. Did she fall asleep half way through it like I do. Um, anyways. All right.

Speaker 2:          49:49          Okay.

Speaker 1:          49:52          Okay. And she has a venereal disease, but you know, other than that, you know, we laugh a lot. Ah, fuck. All right. Do we have anything else here? Is there anything else that that needs to be discussed other than why is my computer that I got kicked off line.

Speaker 2:          50:14          Okay.

Speaker 1:          50:15          You know, and now novel, it'd be funny if I never go to the Internet again in the last thing I did was I looked up Babushka um, all right. People. It's Memorial Day. Whose kid? No, you're not fucking working today either. All right.

Speaker 1:          50:34          I have to go to a picnic. That kid picnic and I can't wait. You know what? I actually got a great book here. It says 88 great daddy daughter dates. I think I'm going to do most of these. You know, I got all these books. You know, uh, dad's prayer for his daughter's daughter. That's fucking weird. Strong fathers, strong daughters. 10 secrets every father should know. All right, let's read a little bit of this sandwich to the salary. Protect her defender. Okay. She needs, oh my God. This is like, all right. How dumb would you have to be to read this fucking book? Okay. One, you are the most important man in her life. Chapter two, she needs a hero. Chapter three, you are her first love chapter four, teacher humility. Oh, she shouldn't stand there like Lebron James after he just blocked a shot a her defender and use a shotgun if necessary. Pragmatism and grit. Your two greatest, I'll read that chapter because I don't know what either one of those meets. I know one of them was a John Wayne movie. Be the man you want her to marry. Gross. Uh, teacher of who God is. Gross teacher to fight. That's right. There you go. Keep her connected

Speaker 1:          52:44          But why did you have to drag black people into this? Alcohol use is a weird chapter. I don't think I liked this book. I know that. I don't know who wrote. Um, anyways. Oh, fucking Billy burger face is going to go fucking turn on the grill. Make a few here. Um, it's just one of my last podcast in my 40. [inaudible] this is so stupid. I'm turning 50. I'm not going to feel any fucking differently.
