Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Barn. It's time for the Thursday afternoon, just before Friday, Monday morning podcast, and I just checking in on you. Just checking in to see how you're doing, man. Shit, by the way, I'm also checking in specifically if they can fucking still hear me. Anybody who stuck around in North Carolina, Virginia, wherever else. The Carolinas, the CACA. Lackeys.

Speaker 2:          00:00:29       Okay,

Speaker 3:          00:00:30       I fucking going anywhere. God Damn and I got a fucking fast boat. All right. Oh, that turn. I took the fucking camper off the back of my camp or special. I welded it to my fucking bass boat. I am good to go. I'm like, yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:00:46       to see a fucking gate or come along my way. All right. I'll have a feast and a new pair of fucking shoes, water moccasin. I'll make you into a fucking belt. Bring it on, Mother Nature. You fucking bitch. That's what a lot of people, that's what a lot of people think. People who are not leaving despite all of the warnings are thinking that's what they think is going on. Right?

Speaker 2:          00:01:13       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:01:14       I'll put on a pair of fucking snow shoes and I'll walk right across the fucking class. Oh, they're spin. And I don't give a shit. I drink moonshine. Spinning is my natural state mother fucker.

Speaker 1:          00:01:29       Well, nature coming over here like some sort of fucking ex wife wanting more fucking money. Um, a lot of people think that that's what's going on. But uh, you know, people don't understand that what the bankers did in the two thousands is still affecting people. And there's a lot of people who are still upside down in a house that's never going to be worth more than what they, what they owe. The American dream is over for these people. And when you're in that situation, you know, uh, that leads to driving a piece of shit car at least to a whole bunch of shit. You don't have health insurance and all of that. So now he's supposed to get into your fucking, you know, questionable car and just drive a state away with no fucking money. You know, you got kids, you got all of this shit. What are you going to donate nine on the other side? People go, Whoa, well you, you know, you get, you at least should be alive.

Speaker 2:          00:02:15       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:02:16       You know what I would do now that I'm driving, driving safe, I would just drive to a waffle house and I would sit in the parking lot. You know what would happen? The security guard at the waffle house, there's no security. There's no security. They just have a fee of a bat phone to the cops at the waffle house,

Speaker 1:          00:02:35       the waffle house. They have got to have the most fucking altercations. Any just, I mean, it's just such a wonderful place. You go in there to get this delicious, unhealthy fucking food that just, it's comfort food, you know? And what happens every, I swear to God, I don't care who the fuck you are. Black, white, male, female, Asian, fucking and Ron Deck. You go in there, you're, you're, you're going to get into a fight. You're going to see a fight. You're going to have to pick up your fucking waffles and move it out of the way is somebody slams down on your table. Like you're in some sort of fucking saloon in the 18 hundreds. And you're telling me these people in North Carolina lackey are supposed to drive to that fucking parking lot.

Speaker 1:          00:03:18       Well, Bill, don't you think that's better than trying to wait it out in a hurricane? I Dunno, Dude. I've never had to do that. You know, fortunately I'm not in that financial fucking position, but um, you know, I just don't understand how these fucking back has got away with that. Joe. I understand how they did it and they're doing it again. But these luxury high rise apartment buildings that they're fucking building everywhere. What kind of a fucking jerk off rents? A luxury high rise apartment building. Okay. Don't do that by a piece of Shit House. Okay. At least at the end of living there, you can sell it and get some of your money back. You may or may not make a profit, but I'm just saying, you know, all you Instagrammers, you know, it's really interesting that I didn't realize, uh, do you know old millennials are, everybody is looking and let myself included. You. Look at college kids, he's fucking millennials. They, they can't do anything for themselves. They're not millennials. All right. Millennials, the first millennials, you know what year they were born? 1980 okay. To 19, I think. 95. So millennials right now, or 22 to 38 and I imagine this some other uninformed shitheads like me out there who are 38 years old and talking about people who are 18, calling them fucking millennials when they are not millennials, but the person is saying it is actually a fucking millennial.

Speaker 1:          00:04:38       All right, people. Now you got to know what generation you're talking about. Like, you know what's funny, I'm actually generation x. So I was after the baby boomers and that ended in like, I dunno, 63 or 64 or something like that. And then generation x went up to 1979. And what's funny is I did not, I did, I, I don't identify as Gen x. No generation next to me was the Seattle music scene. That's when I started fucking hearing it. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:05:14       I don't think, but I didn't think the baby boomers were like, hey man, we got to get out of Vietnam, man. Fucking baby killer man. Right? I feel like this should be a generation between baby boomers and generation x. You know, that generation that like Ronnie James Dio, you know, but you know, didn't listen to the Mamas and the Papas. Oh, the leads are proudly supra and this guy is great. Like that shit. Um, I like to watch your Mama Cat's dance. She had a fucking cool little two step she used to do. Um, anyways, I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about right now. I'm just saying, you know, uh, good luck to all of those people. I'm coming in next week if it's not under fucking water. I really hope it isn't. And uh, you know, I dunno, this is crazy. This is just fucking crazy. I know we always had hurricanes and stuff, but like I just hope they're not going to keep getting worse and the sheer amount of them, um, you know, there's nothing worse than watching people lose everything. Right. Um, if only there was a way to fix this. Mother Nature is trying right now, trying with the only the quickest swiftest fucking solution that's literally, you know, metaphorically what she's doing right now going, I see what the problem is. I need to drown some of these motherfuckers. I need to drown a certain amount of them. Right. But she's going to have, the scary thing is she's going to have to do way better than what she's doing right now because we always worn everybody out,

Speaker 4:          00:07:03       right.

Speaker 1:          00:07:03       The storms coming in and everybody gets the fuck out of dodge.

Speaker 1:          00:07:08       So Mother Nature has gotta be walking around just shaking her head after every one of these things going. I'm telling you I don't, it doesn't make any fucking sense. She's like, Mr Pink, you know, telling me we've got to fucking rat. Okay. When those alarms going off, you got 15 minutes. I'm telling you, go to the cops. They were just there, man. They were just there already. All loaded for bear. Now I know. Am I right? I'm fucking positive. You're like, I got to watch that movie again. Um, yeah, Mother Nature got be. We got to fucking rat in the house. Okay. So who's, uh, who's Tim Roth? Terentino's. Mr. Brown. Like Mr Shit. Mr Pink, Mister Blonde. Mr. White. Mr Orange. Yeah. She has to find out who are Mr oranges and her mister orange is the fucking weather channel. You know, she's got to come in there. So you like to tell jokes are giggling like a bunch of girls in a school yard. Well, I got a job for you.

Speaker 5:          00:08:10       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:08:12       Anyways,

Speaker 5:          00:08:13       uh,

Speaker 1:          00:08:15       I have been working out, I've been eating right and I got to tell you guys, uh, I'm in like the fucking best shape I've been in in years and uh, it is fucking unbelievable. I know people always told me Diet, it's, it's 90% died now he five to 85% to 70% die. Dude, it's, it's all diet. It's all diet. Because like if you can go kick the shit out of yourself and a God damned gym, jump on a fucking elliptical, you jump on elliptical and you can for an hour burns 600 calories according to that fucking computer, which how the fuck it knows how much burning versus somebody else. You know what happened? So it's an estimate. So you, you've sweat all over the fucking thing. You don't wipe it off because you're a selfish cunt. You go walking out of there, right. And then later on that night, all you got to have like three and a half for Oreo cookies and you just negated that workout. Done.

Speaker 2:          00:09:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:09:17       All of that fucking work out the window and you can, you can fucking got a minute and a half.

Speaker 2:          00:09:23       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:09:24       You know what it's like, it's like every, when we, whenever we put out these seasons, F is for family. It takes us like fucking 14 months to finish them. And then people just not, not saying, you know, that's how kids watch it. Not Saying, I don't want you to go. I'm just saying. Then they just come back like, hey man, like what's the next season coming out? Same thing, same thing. Um, I uh, went out and I, I'm actually like a, I am off sugar and salt to the point I asked my wife to go out and get some almond butter and she got it. And I already knew there was something going on with that where it says you didn't have to stir this shit. And I'm like, this doesn't sound like the nat just doesn't feel like the natural shit. So I put it in this smoothie, two tablespoons of this shit, and I meet, I say, let's just fucking sugar in this. And after like for like a five weeks, I've been eating like this. Like it literally almost made my, my fucking, I made like a, like a bit into a lemon, like Jesus Christ. And I never noticed that beforehand. So if you're old like me

Speaker 1:          00:10:28       and you want to regain some of your old glory, you want to drive down the street with the areas to look back. You want to put the dog down, you want to tell these bitches what time it is. Um, it's all about diet. Your abs are there, man. If you didn't have a, I don't have abs. Yes you do. If you didn't have abs, you could not sit up in bed.

Speaker 1:          00:10:52       You know, you couldn't even roll out of bed. You need your obliques could not roll out of bed to go downstairs and eat a chocolate chip muffin or whatever other stupid thing that you're gonna do that's gonna make you break a blood vessel. When you fucking sit down, you know, let's sit down that you do. When you get really out of shape where you, you, you lose, you use your leg muscles and at some point it just becomes a free fall into the couch. You'd give yourself whiplash and your fucking head hits the table that your wife just had to have that was just a little bit higher than the couch. You put them up, fuck right? And then immediately what happened? What? This fucking table here I liked, I thought, look nice. And now you're in a fight, right? And now you're going to work telling your friends that you're not getting along with your wife and what a fucking bitch she is in all of this type of shit. And when it really comes down to is you're just, you're not eating right, you're not eating right. So you literally have to do a fall into your fucking couch. You get a fucking mild concussion on the [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:11:59       giant end table that she just had just had to have it. And he's like, for what?

Speaker 1:          00:12:06       I'm loving the yet and southern accent lately, I kind of disguises that. It's actually my own ignorance saying it. Oh No, I was just doing a character. I was just doing a character.

Speaker 3:          00:12:18       Well, they got a woman doing play by play in the NFL. Oh my God. You got a big kid then went over these women, they don't even Lachsport. Oh, they do. Then what a fuck. And there are only eight people at a w NBA game. You explain that to me? No women on the car. Well, anti feminists aren't. Why aren't these feminists out there to fucking at the God damn, uh, whatever they're called Oklahoma Twat game. Well, why don't you watch an episode of the real housewives maybe figure out that's why they don't show up. Shit.

Speaker 2:          00:13:00       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:13:01       Maybe they're three minutes. They'd be fucking lunging over a goddamn table. They ain't give me no camera, man. There are not enough camera man. Right.

Speaker 1:          00:13:09       Break it up. Um, I went down a Randy Newman, a rabbit hole the other night. Jesus Christ. That guy's talented. Huh? And when that's, I'm old enough to remember when that song, yeah. Show up. People got no reason. Show up. People got no reason. Job. People got no reason to live. And that came out and all these shore people got mad and he was, he was making fun of racism. The ridiculousness of racism, right?

Speaker 1:          00:13:43       It got a little cars go beep, beep beep. They got little voices going, pee, pee, pee grubby little hands, dirty little mind. And people once again took it at face value. But you know, having said that, that song came out and then there was a bunch of people that didn't get what it was about and they were singing it to short people. So I dunno, it was so brilliant on so many different levels. And I love his voice. I love the piano he plays and he's done all these, all these great songs from movies and stuff like that. And I actually looked up to see if he was a touring anywhere. Um, there's some really great footage of them to actually with that short people think where he's in the studio, like an incredible credible sense of humor, you know, as most, you know, geniuses that I've seen always self deprecating and that type of stuff. Um, it's really funny how that is, you know, people who stick just walk around like, like they're fucking astronauts. Just supreme confidence, you know, always thinking they killed, let's just no fucking clue where it's just like, it's just one of those fucking things, you know? I Dunno, that's always a red flag to me when someone's walking around. Maybe that's my own fucking thing. Maybe that's the Boston thing, like easy the kid, don't forget where you came from. Fucking relax. Easy. They're Travolta. Um, anyways. Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:15:20       what else? What else is there to talk about? I've just been, yeah, I was, you know, and it was fucking amazing. I was watching this episode last night, Sunset Strip and they showed the Coanda pass, which is where the one oh one goes from a Hollywood into the valley. And, um, there's this old bridge and they were showing like footage of it from the 1950s and I'd seen this before at a car dealership that had all these old pictures of Hollywood. And you see on the one on one between the one on one north and one on one on one south at the Coanda passes in between the are railroad tracks that no longer exist. And it's always like, you know, they used it. They, the city, believe it or not, from what you know, the tree huggers saved me on, had one of the greatest, uh, public transportations of any city.

Speaker 1:          00:16:11       And the conspiracy theory is that the oil company companies and a Goodyear tire created a corporation and they bought up all the street cars, all the trains and all the trolleys and all that type of shit. A bought it up and just ripped up all the tracks, paved over everything and forcing people to all have to drive. So then they like, they, they would make so much fucking money that they could buy a business as big as that with trains who can afford to throw out of one fucking train, forget about a whole city full of them. Streetcars and trolleys and all that ripped up all the fucking tracks. I mean, I don't know what happened, but there's something happened cause it may, it makes no sense.

Speaker 2:          00:17:01       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:17:04       street were the best. They know. They still have them in like San Francisco and want to talk about the stupid one. We'd go up the fucking hill like you were. I mean those old school, the ones that I grew up seeing,

Speaker 2:          00:17:18       mmm,

Speaker 1:          00:17:20       I dunno, but they're actually there. They're building a, they are building public transportation out here again. So, uh, we shall see. It's weird though because everything then got built up like everybody had a car. So, uh, like most buildings just to go from the sidewalk to the building is I give it go to Vegas and you're like, oh, I'm going to walk across the street to this other casino in like fucking, you know, 15 minutes later you're on your hands and knees going like water, water. Like it's like an illusion. It looks like it's right there. It's right across the street. It is so fucking far away. Um, I know the, uh, at Csus, what's hilarious is you can go from the Mirage to the, uh, to Caesars and they just have this moving air conditioned sidewalk, you know, and there's just all these fat, sweaty people on it. You know, the thing should actually be moving in the opposite direction, should be a giant treadmill for these people and you should have to walk on it for 10 minutes, then it shuts off and rolls the other way. You should. You should, you should have to earn it, you know? Um, they've just be too much, too much liability. Somebody has a heart attack, somebody slips and falls. So they don't, they just conveyor belt.

Speaker 1:          00:18:34       You don't like cattle off to slaughter Jesus bill. Why can't you speak people who are just fat and happy, you know, going in, you know, wearing their favorite loud shirt to go play some craps. You know what you know, I think you guys might have a point on this one. Um, so anyways, the first week of NFL has gone by. Now you know what everybody's doing. Everybody looks at week one and then they just say that's who these people are. The New York jets. Are they the favorites? Any AFC aged?

Speaker 5:          00:19:08       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:19:08       they won one game. Um, I'll tell you the Patriot looked good, but all of a sudden a, it came back and made it really good

Speaker 3:          00:19:15       clothes. If I was a paid for and I would be a good chat about that.

Speaker 1:          00:19:19       I don't know about you guys. Don't you feel like there's about three weeks in?

Speaker 5:          00:19:24       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:19:24       You know, you can kind of start to tell like, okay, this, this team is this, this team is that. And then there's, you know, injuries. I don't know what the fuck's going to happen, but I really don't think that the Tampa Bay Buccaneers are going to put up 48 points a week while letting up 40 or the saints going to let up 48. I don't fucking know. Right. Cincinnati are going to go down by 20 every fucking week and then come roaring back and fucking wait. I don't know. Maybe they will. Maybe this is what's going to happen.

Speaker 5:          00:19:55       MMM.

Speaker 3:          00:19:57       Tell you right now Cincinnati, I mean if this is what we're going to be most exciting season.

Speaker 5:          00:20:04       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:20:05       Anyways, so I am going to, uh, I'm going to be in town this whole weekend because I have, I have a bunch of big gigs coming up. So, uh, I am touring like I used to tour, so I have like one weekend off until like towards the end of October. And um, but this weekend obviously got moved to next weekend, which was my only weekend off. So it Kinda worked out. And um,

Speaker 5:          00:20:32       yeah.

Uh, anyways, uh, yeah, I can't wait to my, we took our daughter over to get some shots, you know what I mean? Like, uh, I decided to stop listening to Hollywood celebrities and actually listen to people in the medical field. So my daughter is getting all the shots. We stretched them out or whatever. So she went there to get like her shot. So she's been there numerous times. And um, so now like she knows when we go in there that this is the place where she feels that needle and stuff. So she's like all nurse. She's like, you know, when I used to bring my dog to the vet, you know, same thing. So I'm trying to make a laugh and stuff. So we ended up going in there and the woman neuros, she's great. She's just real quick gets it done. And um, my daughter said her first three words sentence after she got the shot, like she was already crying when we laid back, anticipating and then she got the shot and then she, uh, she let out this yell, uh, just broke my heart and then she looked at the nurse and she just goes right

Like I would stay out in the waiting room because I, I could not handle, I was hearing those babies crying then I was just like, you know, I don't know that I could, I can handle, even if it's a good thing, watching somebody on any level, hurting my kid and I know that they're doing it for the right thing, but it was just like, uh, so I went in there.

I keep forgetting the name of the guy in the Texans who's fucking incredible, uh, Watson, Dante, Derek, deandre, something, one of those cool black ID names, Watson. Uh, but if you think, you know, you got to check out my bookie, remember who you remember. Who you're betting on is just as, as important as who you, who you're betting with.

Speaker 1:          00:33:00       Uh, the sports gambling podcasts was Sean Green and Ryan, um, you get to listen to my pitch. She gets to listen to my picks of the week. I actually think my lock of the week was that someone was going to say something disparaging about the, um,

Speaker 5:          00:33:16       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:33:17       The, uh, the female announcer and I had thought as I can tell, nothing really happened. You know, I was just fun and right. The aunt of mine, I said, good luck to everybody. What? They should have a transgendered person in that fucking do it, dude. As long as it's still playing football, I don't give a fuck. All right. And as long as you know what you're talking about, I don't know why. I don't care what's between your legs, what you used to have there, what you attached, what's your carved out? I don't, I don't give a fuck. Just please. For the love of God. Know what you're talking about and enhance the experience. Don't take away from it, right? In other words, do the exact opposite of what I do on my fucking podcast. All right, have a great weekend. You cunts. Uh, let's go Lsu. Actually, Randy Newman has a song called necks where he actually a, he's actually making fun of northern liberals.

Speaker 5:          00:34:07       Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:34:08       when it comes to racism, how everybody acts. Like, you know, all the racism is down south. It's a song you could never write today because of the lyrics. But you know, if you actually knew what he was talking about, but there's this, there's a line in there. Got College kids at Lsu, uh, go in dumb. Come out dumb too. So I figured people of Alabama would like to listen to that one, right? Maybe Mississippi, it's always the state next door. Arkansas. I've noticed like, states always think the state next to him was fucking stupid and they're better, you know, which is why rough and rowdy is so fucking tremendous. They're the only people I've ever seen that really exploit

Speaker 1:          00:34:48       that state to state rivalry at the level that people really want to take it to. All right, we play football because it's illegal to just go and beat the shit out of each other. But with rough and rowdy, like when they had it down in the Carolinas, I had no idea how much people in South Carolina and North Carolina didn't care for one another. You know, and literally thought because that, because of that invisible line, if you were on the other side of it that meant that you was some sort, yet you will less than them. It's fucking tremendous. So the next rough and rowdy event, unfortunately I'm not going to be there, but you can bet good and God damn well, I'm going to order it and I'm going to tape it and I'm going to get sit down with my Miller highlights and I'm going to watch it. Um,

Speaker 7:          00:35:27       the next one I believe is in Kentucky and, uh, it's on October 5th, but I have a Gig in Boston that night, so I won't be able to do it to please, please on tune in j Portnoy, big cat, almost hilarious people over there. All right. That is it. Um, enjoy your weekend. You can't talk to you or

Bill, I know, I know you said you had some travel and to do this past Sunday, were you able to enjoy NFL week one?

Speaker 10:         00:37:30       Yeah, I watched the, uh, the Patriots game, although Mike Direct TV was kind of cutting in and out for whatever reason. Um, so I watched a little bit of that. I saw a little bit of the jets and I watched John John Gruden's return and I was loving the first half was great seeing I'm there. I thought it was funny when we say, and he couldn't, he wasn't gonna be able to write to these younger kids and they got rid of all the young kids. He has like the oldest team in the NFL. I that's either going to be a, I think I actually, I think, I think it's going to, it's kind of a genius move on his part.

Speaker 9:          00:38:01       Yeah. It seemed to be a bold play to kind of do what Gordon did and obviously the second half didn't work out. I mean last week we hit on it. Uh, I think your lot cash that the, every sports announcer will be coming out with the sky is falling down and that certainly seems to be the case for the Raiders. And then on the positive side, the jets,

Speaker 10:         00:38:23       well why the rate? I mean the Raiders play like the first half state. They weren't, they were really good rams team. I mean like the Raiders had been like, like, you know, a slapstick forever. I think week, one night that was, I would be happy with that if I was a Raiders fan. I've even known what that second half, they didn't look coolest. I mean it's only week one. Yeah, I know. And the jets and now like you know, they're already going into, you know, whatever that USC guy did. Yeah. They like, you know what he did in week one that Tom Brady did this first week and it's just like, you know, I'm not saying that that guy isn't going to be greater I think, but like, like I don't think you really even know what's going on until after three weeks as far as just like, all right.

Speaker 10:         00:39:10       I mean look at that, that Tampa saints game 48 40 I mean, is that what they're going to be doing each week? I don't know, given up 40 or the other way around it. This, that just seems like sometimes it's just weird games and I don't think Stafford's going to throw five interceptions. It just, you know, it's sometimes you just have a bad game and, uh, I dunno, that was, that was that jets game. It was, um, you know, I mean obviously if they do that every week they're going to be world beaters, but I got a feeling that they're not going to be.

Speaker 9:          00:39:42       Yeah, I agree. And just as a, as a someone who grew up as the jet says, like the little brother team just listening them, Chan, j e t s jet, Cha Cha, it's like calm down one win. And that the worst heartache of the week so far is the, you know, Brett farbs first pass in the NFL was an interception too. It's like calm down, calm down there. The judge, they're the jets.

Speaker 10:         00:40:04       There's too many channels. They have to over hype everything. But what the jets did was obviously really impressive. Uh, and I, you know, I'm an AFC sky, so Miami one to and then buffalo good Lord Hills. So yeah. Plus hello. Good Lord. They ever going to turn it around, but it's only one week. Who knows? But I mean, well, you know, it's funny that they've set out the patriots for the first time since 2016 or not favorites next week. And, um, I was sick of like, what, 2016 isn't that long ago, you know? Yeah. So, I mean, I guess it is as far as like, you know, being a favorite, all of those, all of those games, but uh, you know, they made it seem like it was going to be a decade ago.

Speaker 9:          00:40:49       Yeah. Yeah. I mean, New England, they came out, they took care of business against the Texans. It wasn't, it was a, it was Kinda, it was, it was a weird game. It didn't, it, you never thought the Patriots were going to lose, but the spread seems like it might come into a play at Gronk, obviously looking great,

Speaker 10:         00:41:08       hold demos, let him back in the game and then I'm just sitting there with like six minutes ago. Like, are they going to tie this up? Like, how do we get into this situation? All kind of like, you know, I was very impressed with our defense, um, you know, containment of their quarterback. Like, never can remember his fricking name that God's not. Yeah. Yeah. Watson. Um, but I, I our special teams, um, kind of let up a lot of yards. It seems like every time they ran it back that got at least to the 30. Um, I dunno, we shall see. But our defense looked pretty solid. Well ain't no, it's only one week

Speaker 9:          00:41:45       they finally got rid of Patricia. We took that garbage defense to Detroit. Oh Man. Yeah. I mean if you're, if you're a lions fan and you watch the super bowl and then week one Monday night against the New York jets, you can not be happy. It's like you brought in a defensive coordinator. The defense sucked and you kept the offensive coordinator cause you like the chemistry and they looked like horrible dog shit. So I dunno. A lot of good regression angles in the NFL for me. Exactly. I mean that's when you're talking about pet in the NFL, that's what you, that's kind of what you have to do. You have to look to opportunities to fade some crazy outcome. Like you said, Bill with the the box putting up 48 points on the road. I have a feeling Ryan Fitzpatrick isn't going to do that week to just, just gut instinct. There's a reason he's not doing that every week. It's, it's a flute. Crazy shit happens.

Speaker 10:         00:42:36       Yeah. Yeah. That's the same thing. Yeah, it was. Yeah, it was definitely a weird, it's a lot of weird games. Um, but we'll also tie in from the last time I saw tie as Lord.

Speaker 9:          00:42:50       What's funny is I, one of the things I bet on this season is there will be no tie this see I want on it last year, the first week of the season, Bam. And of course it's the fucking browns. It paid like one and a half to one. It just seems like there's, like you said, there's never a tie even now with only the 10 minute over time it seems like it's, and it's the NFL, they're not going to end in a tie. Come on. Yeah. They should switch it to the college football rules for overtime because that's such a more exciting way to finish the game. And then you never end up with a tie. Hey, one and a half one. Does that mean you had to be, you'd have to bet two 50 to make a hundred no, I bet a hundred and I would win one 50 plus my original bet back.

Speaker 9:          00:43:31       So it felt, it felt like the right, I mean obviously it's a losing bet. So hindsight is is what it is. But yeah, ties are just, both teams really tried to lose the game and that's what we were, we were actually out in Las Vegas hanging out in the sports book when they missed that field goal to end the game and a tie and it was, the sports looks great for dramatic wins and losses, but dramatic ties. It's just no one's happy. Even if you had Cleveland plus three and a half, you still wanted to see them hit that field goal just to just to end the suffering. It was like we were at a strip club and a dude walked down on stage like everyone was just like, ah, fuck. Trying to make sense of this. All right, well this is her.

Speaker 9:          00:44:17       This is their best start and over 14 years. Best starts since 2004 which, oh man, they were loving that step. All right, well let's get into some of these spreads. Of course the spreads are brought to you by my book, He, Daddy g, the one of the safest online sports books. Use the Promo Code Bill bets for a hundred percent deposit bonus. They got it all over their end game wage during the prop builder play when and get paid my bookie. Dot. Agee promocode bill pets. All right. First game to talk about New England patriots. They head into Jacksonville where the Jaguars right now are a, the pats actually our favorite in this game. They're a three point favorite right now. Jack. Yeah, jags are the home dog here. We're looking at a rematch of the AFC championship, although it was played in New England and not Jacksonville Bill, are you worried about the the jags defense here on the road?

Speaker 10:         00:45:14       Yeah, Tom Coughlin is is and you know obviously he, she's beaten us twice in Superbowls and every gun and the cup quickly. He's turned that team around everywhere and the guy goes, you know, fright from back in the days when he's at Boston College. I'm a big fan of Tom Costs and he's getting three points at home. Jaguars defenses as good as I said, I would take, I would take the Jag, I wouldn't be afraid I would take the Jaguars, uh, getting tiny at home. Um, you know, [inaudible] I don't know, I just think there were really tough team and uh, we'll, we'll see. We'll see. I mean, obviously I'm rooting for the Patriots, but we'll talk getting money here.

Speaker 9:          00:45:55       Yeah, exactly. You can't mess around to keep the lights on here.

Speaker 10:         00:45:58       I would take the jaguars getting three.

Speaker 9:          00:46:00       Yeah, it does feel like that's the smart play. I mean, you touched on it last week, shown on the patriots generally aren't playing their best ball in September. And guess what, this is the biggest game on the schedule for the jags after blowing that game in New England. So, I mean, look, the paths, let a Houston team that played pretty poorly, uh, get back in the game and Watson was not himself. So I'm gonna I'll say, unless Bortles completely Bortles it. Uh, I think the Jags jags are gonna win this game. Yeah. It and you talk about Tom Kauflin style, the way to beat New England is the, to try and get pressure on Tom Brady with just using your defensive line and not blitz and a bunch of guys and Yup. The jags have that strong defensive line that might be able to well my that dominate the game but certainly pressure Brady enough and uh, I I think what the, the paths have going for them is Leonard for net. Looks like he's going to be after the jags. Jack's don't have a ton of offensive weapons. Honestly, I think the play in this game maybe, uh, maybe to go under, it feels like it's going to be a little slug match here, but I'll take the jags catching three and a rematch and um, yeah, I know God hates the Jag shown. Remember that a next step.

Speaker 10:         00:47:11       The under census, everybody throws handoffs now. You know what I mean? I just can't

Speaker 9:          00:47:18       or receive or past five years. I just, I always get nervous button, the button, the under funding for if you want to fade, recency, just take the under in every game. I feel like they're there. They're perhaps maybe an over adjustment to the totals after that. Everything. I mean the, the fantasy, everything, the scoring was just off the charts. Yeah, it is. It is tough to bet the under, I mean, just for the entertainment value alone to just root against every play to succeed. But

Speaker 10:         00:47:44       I don't think anybody's ever going to break Emmitt Smith, uh, time rushing record. They just did. The opportunities just aren't there anymore. No.

Speaker 9:          00:47:53       Yeah, I mean it, it's, I think it's going to be really hard for any running backs. The set marks going forward. Cause I mean, half their touches are going to be passes.

Speaker 10:         00:48:00       He's going to be like tech guy from one the most games, like whoever won the most games in MLB history. So it's like in the 500 it's just like, it's gonna it's gonna seem that daunting. Like if there was a different era, has a head saw, young hands over

Speaker 9:          00:48:15       or 800 starts, they're not doing that anymore. No, they didn't. They, yeah. I mean they're never going to come even close to getting there.

Speaker 10:         00:48:22       Yeah. You pitch your whole double header. They were men, they were men, they were men back then though they had a stake giants cigar and called it a little bit of a beer league, you know? Let's be honest.

Speaker 9:          00:48:35       Yeah. I mean you look at Babe Ruth, he does. He does strike you as your uncle at a softball game who can just crush it, who just had a little bit of hand eye coordination.

Speaker 10:         00:48:44       Yeah. I used to play on a softball team when I was working in a warehouse and they always had these, these C's ringers would come out and they all look built like Babe Ruth, a little skinny legs, big beer belly, and they would just get up and they would turn that torso and the thing would go a mile.

Speaker 9:          00:49:00       Yeah. That's like, I mean that was Cecil fielder. You know, he was, he was the modern day version of that meal. All right. Next up we got the New York giants heading down to Dallas. Right now it's sitting at a even minus three here. Both teams started out. Oh, and one neither. Neither looked great too. Uh, yeah. I mean, giants lost at home to the jags. Cowboys lost on the road to the panthers. Spill. Which way you lean in the air.

Speaker 10:         00:49:27       I hate this game. I know. Same here. This game where it's just like, like the cowboys at, I dunno, duct right at home. It's a deficient to, the games are always close. You can never bet against Eli, but he like, doesn't seem like it gets excited until like November, but they got that running deck, Eh, Jesus. Am I going to go giants, giants with Tom Claflin and then I'm going to go, I think I go be like, I think, you know, they beat us twice. So I mean, I see. I got to keep it. These guys, I'm going to completely different time. I believe any lie, and I think, uh, the Dez Bryant hangover and this whole, whatever the hell they've done, reef formation of the cowboys is the hangover lasts for at least three weeks. I'm going with the giants.

Speaker 9:          00:50:18       Kramer, I'm, I'm assuming you're going to be back in your chance as well. I also believe in Ely. I appreciate all these mentions of Tom Coughlin and the Superbowl wins. And he said how excited Ryan is getting on the other end of this. But I mean, here, here's the thing, right? I, I think I was talking to my dad today and I was like, I, you know, I actually wasn't that upset. The giants played fine. They played a really good team. Uh, they played a really good defense. More importantly, and the offensive players got theirs. They just, they were picked six away. So, uh, but what I, what they saw in the Dallas cowboys game was a team that even when Kiki was out of the game, this team struggled to do anything. And Dac as we know, Sean Dakota, Prescott not the best quarterback in the NFL.

Speaker 9:          00:50:56       So Eli has historically played well in Dallas. I'm going to keep throwing that out there and yeah, no, of course. You take the take the giants before it gets off of three. Yeah. As much as it pains me, I'm going to think that I'm going to take the chance getting three points. You look at the cowboys, they're only, they got seek and that's it. Their offensive line isn't the dominant force that it was a name. They have no skill positions to help deck out, uh, on that office. I think they're just going to have trouble putting up points and the giants are weaknesses. The offensive line, obviously the jags were able to exploit that. I don't see the cowboys being able to get enough pressure on Eli and listen, it is Sunday night, Sunday night football. I think your Buddy Odell Ryan, in spite of the fact that he has not won a game since he went on the implements boat trip, I think they get a victory down in, uh, down in Dallas stadium there. So I'll take the giants plus three. I don't feel, I don't feel great about it because Dallas coming off at a loss. Maybe they rally, but I am just still not a believer in Jason cared at all as a head coach.

Speaker 10:         00:52:00       I think Dakota Prescott sounds like some country singer on one of those American idol shows. So true. I mean it just, it's, it cracks me up. His name's to Dakota vote now for Dakota. Prescott. It's the fact that he is also Prescott. Yeah, you could. You could beat Dakota something or something. Prescott, but did coat up Prescott. That's a tough one man. Just like you're just born with an acoustic guitar and a cowboy hat. Second you come out.

Speaker 9:          00:52:27       Yeah. You imagine it's a, yeah. He's like a, a chick with a cutoff flannel shirt with some like short jean shorts coming out with the acoustic guitar ready to wow you with their latest rendition.

Speaker 10:         00:52:39       Well that's another way of looking at it. I didn't tell him in daisy.

Speaker 9:          00:52:42       Well he's, he is. He is a woman in my scenario bill, he's done. He's done. Sean, let's not forget that Dak Prescott to, sorry, Dakota's Prescott. Favorite Song is drops of Jupiter by train. That was a little known nugget about Dakota. That was a trivia fact. We dug up. All right, last game of the week that we'll be breaking down here. Kansas City chiefs coming off a nice win on the road against the s, the Los Angeles chargers. Now they're heading into Pittsburgh. Obviously Pittsford coming off that ugly, ugly tie against the Cleveland browns right now. My book, he has the Pittsburgh Steelers as mine is five favorites at home.

Speaker 10:         00:53:26       Bill, which way you lean in here? You know, I didn't see a second of that. Steel is game. I don't know what, how was Big Ben Look Looking?

Speaker 9:          00:53:34       He looked pretty like typical road. Big Ben like through five what? Five interceptions? Yeah, I five interceptions turnovers maybe they know. I think he, I think he through maybe four or five pics. They had six turnovers overall, but he didn't look good at all.

Speaker 10:         00:53:48       I like the Steelers at home. I don't like that number though. Here's what was picked up. Perfect number. We just sit on the fence. Which way am I going to fall? Uh, you know what I say the steel is going to cover the CISA that chiefs, the chiefs, you know what I mean? Til they're not the chiefs. So the chiefs, the Steelers as still the Steelers. I, I mean, I just thought, I'm just gonna be like historical bedding here at the first couple of weeks. I mean, I don't know who anybody is at this point.

Speaker 9:          00:54:15       Well, and I think, you know, talk about overreaction. Oh my God, Big Ben was horrible. He's always been on the road. Oh my God. They timed the timer. They tied the browns. Oh, levy on Bell Big Ben.

Speaker 10:         00:54:26       He's old school. Take a hit. Like that guy, you know, he's just, you know, and he gets it done in the big moments of the Games. And I dunno, I, I, I believe in that guy still. Yeah, he looks like

Speaker 9:          00:54:40       he plays well in the home and at home. And that's why I like this. Like we're going to fade public perception that the Steelers stink and we're gonna fade public perception that the chiefs are going to win the Superbowl because, oh my God, Andy Reid started. Well again. Uh, I mean, look, this is a classic fade recency of this line opened at seven. Sean and people have been crushing the chief side of this. So wow, let the number come down. I'm also going to be on the Steelers, Sean. I think this is a great kind of fade recency both ways here. Wow. I it's going to be a clean sweep are all in agreeance and all these pics. I love the Steelers at home coming off a, I mean, not a loss, but it may as well be. Then you come home for their home opener, you know, they're going to bounce back and then meanwhile you've got the chief's coming off a huge road victory to go to the other side of the country in Pittsburgh. A home smelling himself like, come on. Yeah. And we watched that. We watched that game. Ryan, the, uh, the chief secondary looked horrible like

Speaker 10:         00:55:35       there, hey, I don't want to be a geography snob, but they're not going to the other side of the country. Can't just say to Pittsburgh, that's, you know, to just into the east coast. I was, I was factoring in the them going out to la, then to Kansas City, then out to Pittsburgh. But yeah, I trash require traveling teen plane. Come on. They've got a connection in Poughkeepsie United in the middle seat. You know, I think there'll be all right. They're going to have crib next. They're not going to, they're going to be dehydrated.

Speaker 9:          00:56:02       All those salty peanuts. I just, I just think it's a good spot for Pittsburgh add home home opener or the Kansas City defense is just there. Passing defense in particular is just horrible and it's a passing league. I just feel like Pittsburgh is going to be able to throw all over him.

Speaker 10:         00:56:18       Anything you say with confidence has, they're passing the stinks. I'm not giving you crap here just

Speaker 9:          00:56:24       after one week. Well, I'll give you two reasons. One reason is I watched the game and I saw that the charger's receivers were wide open a number of times and just dropped easy catchable balls and then two other than that, other than that, my other, my other deeper reason is I sit next to a chiefs fan at work and every day he opens up his laptop and starts reading blogs and just goes, are fucking secondary fucking sucks. So I'm kind of using that as well. I'm convinced. So one year over. All right, Bill, do a wrap things up here. You hit with your lock last week you were, you were two and one with your picks. The lock of course was that the sky was falling down or that the, the announcers would all proclaim the sky was falling down. Yes. Hopefully we get that three and oh this week. But what's your, what's your lock prediction for a NFL week too?

Speaker 11:         00:57:21       Uh, one person tweets that women should not be play by play announcers and by Wednesday, well I guess it's a, I get another two days. Somebody is going to say something, somebody will say something and then it's going to become this huge thing. And then I think by this time next year all play by play. People will be women. That would be that. That is my luck.

Speaker 9:          00:57:48       Lock it up. Doris Burke will be doing it right.

Speaker 11:         00:57:51       It's fine. The way as it, as a joke, I was joking with my buddy going to, I go, dude, Burt Reynolds died in the play by play on Monday night. Football is a shemale. I go, it really is over. We had a great run. So as, as a joke, I actually looked up the elks club going like, I moved. Just see what the elks club, that's a men's club or whatever and looked it up and in 2005 first of all, I looked it up and the picture was of a woman. When you go to the website, they sued in 2005 and one so like even they've even infiltrated obviously the, I mean arguably the biggest group of jerk off men in the country. I mean you're literally talking to take away like the hats with the little tasks and it's hilarious. Like I looked it up. I would never join it, but I was just, I just, it was going to get a check out of the fact if there was one place left where you could just chill out and not have to adjust your behavior. And the old gentleman, he's over, man.

Speaker 9:          00:58:46       It was the elks club and Augusta national and then both those have been infiltrated. They're now no longer all male. All right. We had a hell of a Ron Dude. Yeah, man. Really did have a hell of a run. Every dynasty must come to an end. Tens of thousands of years I think. Drawing Emmett and the Herman. The triplets.

Speaker 11:         00:59:12       Yeah. We were a three headed monster for a long time.

Speaker 9:          00:59:14       Well, this is, a lot of people are saying this is a rebuilding year for men. You know, we're, we're hoping to get the number one traffic took a lot of heat loss. A lot of lost a lot. I took a lot of Ellis out there. Yeah. We're going to try to forget about last year. And, uh, you know, we're going to hit reset. We've got Jon Gruden back. He's back at different times, so much. Jon Gruden face. I can't wait. Oh Man. It was, he was loved seeing him back then. It was so funny how like, he was just kind of a different guy in the broadcast booth. And then the second he put the headphones back on again. He just wanted a break back to the chuck you faced. I loved it. Yeah. The thing that was frustrating about him as an announcer was that clearly he thought about getting back into coaching so he wouldn't bad mouth guys on the air. And he just loved everyone at, he's a great guy. Look at this guy. And then as soon as he's got that headset on, you could just see him screaming and yelling. He was, he was just so pissed at cars. He got the job. He cut half the team. Uh, I thought you said you love me. I, Hey, the broadcast booth. Yeah. None of the claim. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          01:00:20       All right.

Speaker 10:         01:00:21       Well see how we do, gentlemen, uh, I'm going to get more bold with my predictions is once, you know, hopefully, you know, what am I actually, my show's got moved this weekend because of the hurricane, which hopefully goes out to see a am I supposed to work in Virginia and South Carolina. So I'm hoping that, you know, you know, a lot of those people are probably still upside down in their houses because the piece of shit bankers, so the last thing they need is a hurricane to hit the house that's not going to be worth more than what they owe on it. Screwed by the insurance companies as well. Yes. Yeah. For the trisector. So, um, uh, that's what I'm thinking about this week. I'm supposed to be there the following me, but I, but the other side was I will be home and didn't have enough time to watch the game. So hopefully a silver lining in that shout out to Dakota Prescott.

Speaker 9:          01:01:04       Love it. All right. And obviously a checkout Bellbird outcome for all the upcoming tour information. And of course, uh, check out my book e. Dot.

Speaker 12:         01:05:44       Um, you know what, this is, I'm not even hung over, but I just, I rather than being hung over, which I should have been, but I wasn't, but I'm not, whatever I'm trying to say, I just woke up with just weird music in my head. You have to do that. You wake up, you drank last night, you dot hung over. But he's, you just wake up and then you just singing some song that you haven't even thought of for years. I was just walking around my, my uh, fucking apartment here, just walking around and going some like it hot, some like it hot bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump up about the CPAP and then how it goes.

Speaker 13:         01:06:19       Feel the heat

Speaker 11:         01:06:22       burning into the knife or the night, whatever the fuck it is. Is that Robert Palmer? Some like it hot. Ooh. Robert Palmer. Tell us about your new sexy, sultry, single with that hot Latino beat underneath it. Well, I had recently gone to Cuba and I are inserted a fucking go Cohiba and to some fucking prostitutes or fish. And I was just really a overwhelmed by the culture down there and she fucking hate that. You know what I make whenever, like the White Star tries to have some sort of ethnic beat under their music and then they always get to talk about some trip that they took to Swahili and how when they were sitting there in that Walden resort, they somehow fuckin absorbed the culture. You know, you guys haven't gone down to the Caribbean, you gone down into the Caribbean, however the fuck you say it. Some people say Caribbean, some people say Caribbean, but to me it's, it's all one beautiful universe. The guys went down to the Caribbean to go scuba diving,

Speaker 12:         01:07:29       to be nose to nose with a fucking Barracuda. They get barracudas down there quick. Why don't you look it up and then send me an email and tell me how fucking uninformed I

Speaker 13:         01:07:38       actually, Barracuda are indigenous to this Egil for Brazil.

Speaker 11:         01:07:42       The fuck up. I can look this shit up to, what is it? A freshwater fish? If you go down to like fucking Uruguay, can you get a Barracuda Sandwich? You know, just to start your day rather than, than getting like a bacon, egg and cheese.

Speaker 12:         01:07:56       Did they do that and do they use the whole fish? Because they're better than Americans where we would just like use like just the best part of the fish and then the rest we would just sort of throw out the window, just toss it back into the ocean and it gets all hooked up with like old rollerblades and fucking, um, those shoes.

Speaker 11:         01:08:16       Every guy war in the late nineties, remember those fucking shoe. So slip on shoes that sorta look like sneakers. Canada, look like shoes. Remember those? Fuck it. Thanks. Where are all those right now? I'll tell you where they are. They're floating out in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, getting broken down in the sunlight. Right? And then some dolphin inhales it and then you go out to Japan. Right? And they don't give a fuck about dolphins. You guys see the cove?

Speaker 14:         01:08:42       Okay.

Speaker 11:         01:08:42       You know they'll fucking Dolphin Schindler's list. Basically. I couldn't eat. I just heard what that movie was about. And I fucking love animals so much that I couldn't eat. I couldn't even know. Schindler's list actually had somebody fucking decent in it, trying to help out those being slaughtered. Ow. What the fuck am I? I didn't even see the goddamn movie. All I heard was a bunch of people, they drive these dolphins into this fucking cove and then they just beat him to death. And it was a

Speaker 14:         01:09:14       okay,

Speaker 11:         01:09:15       it, it was so fun just to hear. It was so fucking sad. And then it just made me so God damn angry that I like, you know what? I'm not going to fuck, I'm not gonna, you know, I'm not gonna Watch that stuff is what am I going to do? Oh, who got himself to treat at the local Deli. This is what, this is how you get out of shape in New York, even though you walk around all the time is you just walk into a Deli and you're like, you know what? I'm going to start my day. We're on our way to the perfect place, the perfect place. Bup, Bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, Ba. That's another fucking song. Just popped in my head. What is that from? It's the perfect place.

Speaker 14:         01:09:56       Okay.

Speaker 11:         01:09:57       Was that, that was like a Hanna Barbera cartoon. Ron. Our way to the perfect place. The perfect place. Anyways, I'm sorry. This is like, I have weird hangovers sometimes I don't have a headache. I just, just music pops into my head. Sound like it. Hot sound like it. Um, anyways, some white guy playing yoga blocks. Does that sound Latino? Speaking of Latino, I went into, well, one of these little fucking Bodega's [inaudible] La dawn day as, uh, the fucking orange juicer. Um, I was up there and I got myself an Oj and a banana because I'm really into these light breakfast. His now. I finally realized that when you wake up and you have a lumberjack breakfast, that seriously, it's like I've been saying on this podcast, it's like getting up. It's like if you just woke up the second you woke up and you just sprinted 400 yards without stretching or anything, didn't even put on your fucking shoes. He just ran down the street. I buy, buy, buy, buy, buy on the fucking pebbles. Right. That's what you're doing to your body. That's why I started slow. I get a little fucking corn based orange juice according to food inc it's all corn now. Excuse me. And then I have a banana, you know, which is like sort of like a baby food in a phallic form. That's what it's like. It's like a big fucking, uh, would have a big yellow dick. One animal. I got fucking Porno, Star Canary if you want it to.

Speaker 11:         01:11:36       That's what it bananas like. Right. So typical New York, I'm trying to eat healthy. And then I look over and I see these two little toasted balls to add to the fucking, the, the, the, the canary thing, right? Like they lopped off this fucking Porto nuts. And I looked at the lady and I was like, oh, La, San your retail, what the fuck are those? And she's like, oh, those are, those are coconut balls. And I was like, get the fuck Outta here. And she says, I can't get the fuck outta here. I have to work. And I said, no, I didn't mean it. Literally. I meant get the fuck Outta here.

Speaker 11:         01:12:14       Those are made out of coconut. And she said, see? And I was like, I fucking love coconut, you know? And she started laughing like, I never said you didn't fuck. Oh, do you want them? And I'm like, absolutely. I want them to know I have him. So I have to tell on you guys. I was going to begin my day with a, you know, we didn't really healthy. I ended up grabbing two sugar balls. Actually, the call, uh, I actually hear the Coco Komodo and underneath an English macaroon coconut. Here's the ingredients, sugar, coconut, and then in parentheses says may contain sodium metaphor wholesale such harsh for whiteness. I love that shit. Like how much did they not even research? What the fuck is? Yeah, it might. It might, might have a little bit of this met up by sulfite for whiteness. Well, the coconuts white. Why would you need to add to that? Is this some coconut that you fucking had in a warehouse for years? Egg Whites, invert sugar, corn Syrup and salt. So for the most part it's all natural except for the sodium metapod by said vice types of light for whiteness. And I'm gonna try one. Let's see.

Speaker 11:         01:13:33       Sweet Dreams are made of the keys. How bad his fucking Annie Lennox. When you think of the annals of the fucking baddest rock chicks, we'll start with white chicks, right? We'll move all the way around. We'll start with the baddest white chicks of all time. I would say fuck an Annie Lennox and no particular order here. If I was rolling stone, I do an entire issue of this. The hundreds greatest rock chicks of all time rolling stone really is clearly showing people if he haven't been paying attention. How few people buying magazines now?

Speaker 12:         01:14:13       Oh, that fucking listening to discussion. It's like a donut. Oh, it's gross. I was too much.

Speaker 12:         01:14:26       That's fucking disgusting. I have to take another bite. Cause now my sugars shot and arise right now. I'm craving it. Ah Fuck Man. I need another hit man. Oh yeah. Oh I stand corrected. These are fucking delicious to eat. The first bite. Is your body going? No, don't do it. So it tastes like shit. But then that sugar gets in your veins and it's like, come on man. You know you want it and then you just keep going. Like this is really rude to be eating on the mic. All right. Annie Lennox, you know, and then can't even think now. Any Linux, the chick from the pretenders, Chrissy Hine, right Pat Benatar. Now that's not what I want it. I, you know, I always got confused with the chick from the runaways, Joan Jett, Joan jets, Shit. Um, and she's still hot. Damn it. Those are fucking delicious. Ah, not after a swig of Oj though, rose. Okay. They're really hard to chew.

Speaker 12:         01:15:48       Wow. What am I fucking neighbors just here. Just heard that. Wondering what the fuck I'm talking about? Um, all right. Sorry. Sorry. You know what? I'm actually last night. Um, no, finish your fucking thought bill. If you look at rolling stone, they used to be this big magazine. Just I'm talking about when you held it, it was used to be like the fucking third bigger. Now they've shrunk it down to, it's like a third of the size it used to be. And now every other month they're doing those, those list things. 100 greatest guitarists of all time. The hundred greatest tambourine players of all time. Right now they have the hundred greatest Beatles songs of all time. It's like, did they even write a hundred songs? You know, they just do that so people can, you know, they, I guess people always buy those magazines and they go, Ooh, too, fuck, oh, can you put, oh hey bulldog in front of while my guitar gently weeps. And then people write notes. Was that really worth revisiting? I don't think it was. Well those are my top three, top three fucking white chick rock singers of all time. And um, well considering we've been talking so much about Latino's, let's go with top three Latinos of all time, Latinos singers. And this is when my whiteness is going to come to see if I can even name three. Uh, Salina. They did a movie about her, Selena, Jennifer Lopez and um,

Speaker 12:         01:17:22       ah, fuck. This is embarrassing. Lucille Ball.

Speaker 14:         01:17:28       Okay.

Speaker 12:         01:17:28       And Lucille Ball. Fuck you. She was made to Ricky Ricardo, Bam. Those are your three. But she never really sang did she? What the fuck I know. I know more than that. Celine. I don't even know any songs. Selena sank.

Speaker 14:         01:17:43       Okay.

Speaker 12:         01:17:44       I just know she had a psycho fan. That's all I know. And then Jennifer Lopez plater oh wait, wait. The chick from Miami sound machine, right? What songs today saying, Ooh, my Amie, we're fuck and taken over. What songs did they sing? I saw that fucking band stunk. Miami sound machine, all that fucking turquoise with all that. That just when I pictured them, I just was a bunch of people in puffy pants.

Speaker 14:         01:18:17       Okay.

Speaker 12:         01:18:17       And they had like 58 people on percussion and unlike one keyboard and then she was skipping around in her boots, right? Isn't that wasn't it what Miami sound machine was the fuck songs? Did they say,

Speaker 12:         01:18:30       God damn it. I used to know all of this shit. I can't get that Robert Palmer shit out of my head anyways, whatever. So I want to learn some, tell me, give me your top three Latino fucking singers of all time. I know somebody already compiling a list and getting pissed at me because I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about, but that's what people do on this podcast. Mike, last week I made a, I made a reference to the Pullman strike when I was reading about a Grover Cleveland or some shit like that and this guy wrote, he wrote, Hey, uninformed bill. The reason they brought the military in during the Pullman strike was because the workers in quotes, he puts, we're becoming violent, not because they were striking because they were attacking the alternate workers brought in to fill the void of labour caused by the strike. And this is hilarious. The guy writes down his name, marketing and business development coordinator. Yet you sound like the guy who would side with the fucking people who, who are underpaying. It's first of all, why do you put workers in in uh,

Speaker 14:         01:19:33       okay.

Speaker 12:         01:19:33       In parentheses. You know what I mean?

Speaker 12:         01:19:39       The strike was because the workers were becoming violent. Not because they were striking because they were attacking the, the scabs they brought into to take their jobs. That's part of a strike yet dumb fuck. You know, and you know, I love to sir, is the way you're acting as though you had even heard of the Pullman strike before I said it. That's that classic Internet Shit. We don't have to go to the library anymore. He just look up the Pullman strike and then you read two paragraphs and then you're like, oh actually, you know what the reason you're just as dumb as me sir. Of course they attack the scab workers brought him cause now they're going to be out of out of a job. And that was my point. And who does the military side with?

Speaker 14:         01:20:19       Okay.

Speaker 12:         01:20:19       The military works for the fucking rich people. All right. And if you don't fucking believe that, that I'm not going to eat another fucking coconut ball.

Speaker 14:         01:20:27       Okay.

Speaker 12:         01:20:28       Oh, it just gets better. No, it doesn't. All right, that's enough of that. Jesus Christ. Jesus. All right, let's talk NFL football. Everybody. Oh,

Speaker 11:         01:20:41       before I do the FM podcast.com, everybody, um, I made a video on there, um, where I did a little tour of the comedy store analysis stood outside the comedy store and I talk shit about some of the people walking by down the street.

So I wanted to thank you guys, but shipping it seriously means a lot to me that people actually went out and supported the podcasts like that. So thank you. From the bottom of my heart. And the gentleman who runs the [inaudible] podcast.com. All right. And with that

Speaker 11:         01:22:14       bump up,

Speaker 12:         01:22:17       it's time to talk about NFL football here. Um, I actually was flying on a plane during the Patriots game, so I can't really talk too much about it. Other than that, I just, I was watching, I actually had satellite TV on, on the, on the plane. So I was sitting there going, ah, fuck, I'm gonna miss the fucking game. And then I see that they're going to have satellite TV and I got excited. Oh boy. Oh boy. Right. And I fucking turn it on and all I get, I had NBC.

Speaker 14:         01:22:44       Okay.

Speaker 12:         01:22:44       And then the rest were like discovery animal planet, and then they had three ESPN.

Speaker 11:         01:22:49       So I'm praying how I hope and pray that I will, but today I am still just a bill. Um, fuck you. The songs are in my head because I'm hung over. I'm praying that the Patriots game was going to be NBC. And

Speaker 12:         01:23:06       it turned out that not only was the game not on NBC, they didn't even have a football game on NBC. They had some fucking infomercial on insults. So I was like, you gotta be fucking kidding me. Right? You gotta be fucking kidding me. And, uh, so then I, I just was watching ESPN. I was watching all the college football games that I already watched. Uh, I think Michigan's back everybody.

Speaker 14:         01:23:32       Okay.

Speaker 12:         01:23:32       Hail to the victors value at hail to the vector at Bat. Bat Bat,

Speaker 8:          01:23:39       Pat, Pat, Pat, Pat, Pat, Pat, Pat, Pat, Pat, Pat, Pat, Pat, Pat, Pat, Pat, Pat, Pat, Pat, Pat, Pat, Pat, Pat, Pat, Pat, Pat, Pat, pat.

Speaker 12:         01:23:47       Do you wanna just sit there? I did three fucking college songs and they all sound the exact fucking same hail to the victors. Wake up the echoes and fucking, uh, the Fleetwood Mac Trojan band. It's all, all the same shit. I'm anyways, yes, I watched that and I watch the, uh, the USA basketball game against a Turkey. That was the shit. And uh, we won that championship. But anyways, I was watching the ticker and by the way, what's his face there is going to be the next superstar. And I saw him when he played in Seattle and I can't even remember his fucking name already cause I'm that fucking hung over. Come on brain work for me because with a d I can't fucking remember, but he was a Shitty, he was hitting fall away. Three pointers as a six, 10 I even what position you play? I don't know. I don't know shit about basketball. All right, let's plow ahead here. Um,

Speaker 12:         01:24:42       patriots won the cults lost, so I'm excited, right? I was also excited. How about Detroit? How about Cleveland? Come on, you guys. You got to admit, you know, you had a little bit, uh, I think, I think that does this, uh, a ray of light. I didn't see any either one of those fucking gains, but I was just, I was just watching the ticker and um, I saw that that dude from out play for cow best had two touchdowns. Right. And Cleveland was basically one in the fucking game right down to the end. I know I'm not trying to talk down to you guys, but I'm just saying, you know, whatever your beat Miami, that's got to feel good luck. You know what? The main reason why I'm bringing this shit up is, is because I want to say the shit before the fucking game comes out tonight. I got 50 bucks on the ravens tonight. Straight up. I bet at straight up. Even though the jets are favored by like six, I don't know what the line is, but I was like, you know what? You can keep your fucking points there, missy. I don't give a shit. That's how confident I am. How fucking dumb or the New York jets, what did they, can you just, can somebody explain to me the strategy of pissing off every fucking every team in the league?

Speaker 12:         01:25:56       Yeah. First of all, I love it being a patriots fan because for the first time in 10 fucking years, nobody was talking about bill Bellacheck. Nobody was talking about the Patriots. Nobody was talking about Tom Brady. Rarely. The guy even got into a fucking car accident and that was barely a fucking story compared to the shit storm that is going on with the New York jets. What? What do they doing? Let me ask you guys a question. How amped up does Ray Lewis get before a football game when, when the other team hasn't talked shit about them? I think they're out of their fucking minds. Ray Lewis, I put it on my Facebook page. That's my prediction. He is going to rip Sanchez his fucking head off tonight. Sanchez. This guy who everybody, for some reason they're forgetting the up and down season that he had last year and they're, they're acting like they have this proven quarterback.

Speaker 12:         01:26:55       I don't get it, man. And they went out and they drafted all, they got signed, all these free agents. They're really reminded me of the University of Miami when they got off the plane wearing the fatigues and they were talking all this shit. And then when it came down to it, they didn't fucking win anything. Remember that? Or like the, the Los Angeles Lakers when they added Gary Payton and Karl Malone and you're thinking, how can they not fucking, and then they didn't, I don't, I don't get it that that year when the Patriots went undefeated in the regular season and then get their asses kicked in, in the super bowl by the giants, it's like the hype was so fucking big that from November on, we were playing playoff games. Teams were coming in so fucking amped up to kick the shit out of us. It just wore, it wore us down. It was down to me while no one's paying attention to the giants, to the point that giants put up like 35 points and the last week of the season against us.

Speaker 12:         01:27:50       And for some reason we was still 14 point favorites three fucking weeks later to this day I kicked myself for not taking that bet. And, uh, yeah, it was ridiculous. And meanwhile the giants had beaten Tampa Bay in Tampa Bay. They beat Dallas in Dallas. They beat Green Bay and Green Bay and no one's paying attention to them. Then everybody sat there with their jaws in the ground. They kicked this didn't even kick the shit out of us. They just beat us like, holy fuck. How did this team that beat three awesome teams and their own fucking building come in and beat us? [inaudible] it's fucking ridiculous. So the jets have started their season at zero and zero with the whole league as amped up the kick the shit out of them as people were amped up to beat the fucking patriots it by mid November. All right, and I'm telling you right now, they are going to have a mediocre fucking season. I think it's going to start off with the loss tonight. I'm not saying that they're not going to go nine and seven, but these guys, I don't know what the fucking problem is and not to mention that now they have a nice little scandal here. Cover the daily news. They says cool. Your jets, TV reporters, flags team for Lewd behavior, um, in his saints, reporter for Azteca TV.

Speaker 11:         01:29:05       Where the fuck is that broadcast? It's is at the center of a jet Brouhaha. Basically, if you see this girl, she's fucking hottie right? She's got her little pass here and uh, you know, she's got some Cleveland show. Oh my God. Are you serious? They got a picture of her edit jets practice. She's got on the tightest fucking jeans I've ever seen in my life with the most perfect round ass you've ever seen. And she's in high heels. Okay. And she's walking around a bunch of football players who got that testosterone going with a fat shit talk and coach, let me guess. Somebody said something out of line. Oh, this is just, this is, you know what I mean? This right here, and this is one of these things where you can't say, well look how you're dressed. Cause they go, you're blaming the victim.

Speaker 11:         01:29:56       She should have a right to have three quarters ever tents outside of her shirt with a thong going up her fucking ass crack. And she should be allowed to walk into a locker room with a bunch of football players and not have one out of fucking whatever the fuck you're going to say. Well, one fucking rude comic gimme a break. Nfl boss Roger Goodell was demanding answers last night from jets players. But why don't you look at the pictures, Roger? Huh? What are you a fucking unit? You don't understand what the problem was. Uh, for players, coaches accused of subjecting of female sports reporter to sexist locker room conduct, they should've just said for subjecting her to lock a rum conduct. This is basically what happened. She went into a locker room and was subjected to locker room conduct. Can you believe it? I remember last night when I went out to a bar and I was subjected to bar room conduct.

Speaker 11:         01:30:55       I couldn't believe it. I was like, what am I in a bar or something as they prepare for their season opener tonight, gang green is dealing with the burgeoning scandal over the treatment of Inez Saints, uh, for Azteca of Mexico. This girl is a 10. She's fucking smoking gorgeous Emmy. You got to see the way she's dressed. Okay. And Fuck you ladies. Fuck you. Look at the way she's dressed. She's one of those, you know what's funny about the broads out there is this is the kind of girl, right? The kind of woman that kind of fucking who, uh, who, if you know, if any of these women, you know who will listen to his podcast, they're walking down the street with their husband and this girl comes walking by, they immediately, they date fucking, you know, in the eyes become like little slits. Is He looking at me?

Speaker 11:         01:31:43       You know, and then they're looking at their husband and they're going to get mad at you because this other bitch goes to the gym. You know, like somehow it's your fucking fault and they fucking looking at you because they can't just come out and say, oh my God, that girl is fucking gorgeous. I'm so jealous her, they, they can't, they can't own that emotion. So then they look at you and they're just waiting for you to glance and that part and that woman's direction. So they can blame you that just fuck another girl is eating right and and fucking doing herself up right? It's going to become your fucking fault. I used to do a bit about that. Next time you, you know what? Here's one for you guys on a burn. A joke right here that I never fucking recorded. So who gives a shit next time you're walking down the street with your girlfriend, right in this fucking unbelievably smoking shit comes walking up the street, right?

Speaker 11:         01:32:31       And what do you got? And she immediately just looks at you like, go ahead and look at her so I can take out my fucking hatred of this better looking girl and make it your fucking fault, right? This is what you do. Rather than trying to look away and having blood come out of your, out of your eyes, you try not to look at this fucking hot piece. Hey should coming up the street. What you do is you fucking point right at her and whatever she's wearing, you tell your girl that she'd looked great in that you point read. Then it'd be like, you know what? You'd look great in a dress like that, right? And then immediately just a p, you know, it, it makes their insecurity go, oh my God. Really? Do you think I could get away with wearing something day? Totally used to girls feeling good.

Speaker 11:         01:33:06       You're staring at the girl's ass. You're talking about the cut of the dress. It's bullshit. You're checking around without disrespecting a woman. See right there. Bill burr bringing couples together. All right, let's continue on here. Um, so this woman, 32 years old, 32 years old, still in smoking fucking shape of former Miss Universe contestant complained. She was bombarded with cat calls and boarish antics at the jets, New Jersey training facility to the extent she wanted to. And in quotes said, cover my ears. Um, dying of embarrassment. This woman, right? Former Miss Universe contestant who would walk on stage with a fucking string bikini and high heels with a hoo ha hanging out talking about how to save Greenland or whatever is embarrassed because she walked around. I mean, give me a, you know what I mean? This is why women stink. It's like, what are you doing there?

Speaker 11:         01:34:09       To begin with. It's a bunch of guys playing football. It's like, and then we're cool enough to let you in there and then everybody has to fucking adjust their behavior because your, their wig scares me. Scares me. There's a lady present. You know what I mean? And you'll wonder why you get called a cunt. That's why. Right fucking there. It's just fucking unbelievable. I would never walk into a god damn baby shower and be, oh, excuse me. Excuse me. There's a guide present. Can we put a fucking game on Ovia I wouldn't, I'd be standing in the corner going, oh Geez, when is this Shit gonna be over? But I wouldn't at any point try to cock block what anybody was fucking talking about. Go and talk about sex in the city. Talk about your favorite shoes or whatever the fuck it is you do. I wouldn't,

Speaker 14:         01:35:04       okay.

Speaker 11:         01:35:04       Be covering my ears. Dying of embarrassment. If you all started talking about my package, I'd be flattered. Um, this is some of the more, more ignorant shit that I've said on this podcast, but I think there's a point behind this. Let's continue with the article.

Speaker 12:         01:35:19       MMM,

Speaker 11:         01:35:20       good. Al. It's just said, I'm dying of embarrassment. Saints tweeted in Spanish, um, Goodell immediately ordered an investigation into the troubling in air quotes, allegations, which were addressed in a team meeting last night. Uh, this meeting is now called to order, uh, last night when that smoking hot chick with the tight clothes came in and everybody said, God Damn, look at that fucking ass. Yeah, you're not allowed to do that.

Speaker 12:         01:35:48       Uh, excuse me, coach. Ah, yeah. Yes sir. Yeah, we, you talking about that girl who came in and, and Teddy's way hanging out of her shirt? Yeah, that one. Yeah, that one. We a disrespected her. See, this is, this is the deal. All right. They come down, they want the fucking attention. You know what? Wait, what? What is she, what is she doing in the fucking locker room to begin with? You know what? She even in the locker room, did I even, they even say that, I can't remember. Didn't you see any given Sunday? You don't remember that movie? You're going to stand there and there's gonna be some black dude with a dick down to the floor. I mean, why are you going in? I wouldn't go in there

Speaker 11:         01:36:31       if I went in there, they'd start giving me cat calls. Like I was that fresh fish guy when the beginning of shots, Shawshank redemption.

Speaker 14:         01:36:40       Okay.

Speaker 11:         01:36:40       And I'd be dying of embarrassment too, but I'd fucking take it. It'd be like, yeah, well what the fuck did you think was going to happen? You're a fucking pansy. And he'd come walking into an NFL locker room. They're all going to give you shit and say you're a pussy,

Speaker 12:         01:36:53       right?

Speaker 11:         01:36:55       I mean, what kind of a fucking world are we living in now? When a gorgeous woman wearing tight, ridiculous clothes is going to walk into a fucking at a football practice and she's going to get upset, that's that she got unwanted attention. Well, why don't you come there and dress like they did in the 18 hundreds

Speaker 12:         01:37:13       with one of their big hoop skirts and they can't see you fucking thighs. This chick is fucking ridiculous. Look, look at the New York Daily News and look at the little inset picture that they have of her. I'm sure they did it for a fucking reason. It's ridiculous. Look at that fucking ass. Look at, that's the first thing I think. Look at that fucking ass. Jesus Christ. And then she's holding a mic. It looks like a dick in her hand while she bobbing her head up and down and she asked a questions. This is like entrapment.

Speaker 14:         01:37:44       Yeah.

Speaker 12:         01:37:45       Anyways, let's fucking continue. Um, but, but papa, we've had contact with the team multiple times and are moving very aggressively to establish the facts. The NFL spokesman, Greg, I Hilo said jets owner woody Johnson woke up from his coma and said, oh, wait, that guy none off. That guy is actually young, uh, called saints to hear his side of the story and said that the team will take any appropriate steps necessary to maintain a respectful environment for the media. Basically, this girl is now going to become a fucking millionaire off of this lawsuit because she walked to an NFL practice with her Miss Universe body with tight fucking clothes on. And somebody said, God Damn, look at that fucking ass right there. Hey mark. What the fuck would you do with dad? I fucking bedroom over fucking table and then fucking rex. Ryan. I can't even see him.

Speaker 12:         01:38:39       My fucking my fucking stomach. So big. Huh? Was that a good one? Players. Do you guys like me? I talk just like you. I can't wait for them to fucking lose tonight. They're going to get their fucking asses kicked and I can get their asses kicked butt. They're going to lose. They're going to lose, and then they're going to have a short week. All right, and guess who's back the New England patriots? Huh? 38 fucking points up against. Oh, chose Sinco. Tarell Owens. Cade McNabb down. What's the name of your quarterback? Something. Wilson. I don't even know the name of your fucking quarterback. He was awesome. And then he got hurt. He's actually a good quarterback with the fuck's his name. I know it's not caving now. Ucla fucking Heisman trophy winner. Classic Chicago Bear quarterback drug draft. They love Kate Mcdowell and they loved the Rex Grossman. For some reason, they didn't like Doug Flutie.

Speaker 12:         01:39:29       Let's keep, let's ship him out of there. Really, you want to ship a proven winner out? Absolutely. We don't want him around here leading the team to victories. Where the fuck is the Goddamn patriots game here? Oh, Carson Palmer. This is what I love about that man. He was 34 50 for 345 yards. Oh, chose Sinco had 12 catches for 159 yards. All right. Yet they only scored 24 fucking points. You know my buddy was saying it, they getting back to that bend but don't break. You know, someone else was telling me Bella check is doing the defense again, which is his fucking, that's, that's what he does. I Dunno. I have a, I have high hopes, but you know, it's not about the patriots this year. It's all about the j e t s jets, jets, jets. Right. Running the fucking yaps. You wanted the attention.

Speaker 12:         01:40:24       Now you got it. Oh, I can't fucking wait. You guys looked up to stats of that fucking Joe Flacco. Joe Falco, whatever the fuck his name is. I didn't know what his name is. All I know is they raped us last year in the playoffs. You got ray rice is going to be running all over you fucking cunts. Huh? What do you think? Cause you got that old guy from the dolphins, that good looking son of a bitch. You should be doing fucking underwear ads like Jim Palmer. That's the guy. That's the guy that's going to stop everybody. That dude has been showing up late to practice. Rex Ryan is making a joke out of it because he has such a fucking need to be liked by his own God damn players. You wait, you wait till the fucking wheels fall off. All right, here's a contest I want. I want to introduce here.

Speaker 12:         01:41:04       How bout whoever guesses which week? Rex Ryan's going to fucking cry first after which game. If you pick it right, I'm going to send you an autographed copy of my new fucking DVD. So there you go. People, you got fucking 17 weeks to pick when actually not this week, 16 weeks. I'm including the bye week. The first week he's going to start fucking crying because somebody criticized, you know, somebody stole his m and m flavored fucking ice cream. All right. Enough of this shit. That's my thing. I got 50 bucks, 50 bucks in the Ravens and I'm confident. I'm confident that not only I didn't even take the spread straight up. Can you tell, I don't know what else to talk about. I just keep saying over and over again what my bed is. Let's talk about depression, shall we? Speaking of fucking Rex Ryan, um, somebody sent me a long email here that should eat up some time.

Speaker 12:         01:42:00       Um, I actually did, I tell you guys last night, we actually recorded me and to Rosa got fucking hammered last night and we were like, you know, we should do, we should go home and record a drunk, uninformed. And I'm like, well I have to do the Monday morning podcast. He goes, we'll fucking do that too. So last night for an hour in a half as we sat there drinking and getting even more drunk, drunk, horror, whatever the fucking word is, we recorded, we talked for at least an hour and a half. The record is shut off at an hour and 15 fucking minutes and you just hear us get progressively more and more drunk. Uh, I listened to it. There's a lot of funny moments, but it's just way too long. So I am going to, I'm going to edit it, I'm going to dice it up and I'll, I'll, I'll put together a greatest hits of it.

Speaker 12:         01:42:48       They got that coming up, but I just, it was just too much self sabotage. It's like I got my special coming out this week. I really had to make sure I hyped it and I completely was not hyping it in a, in a great way. Uh, you know, it was just that it was bad, it was bad and there was a lot of, uh, embarrassing moments and you know, I, you know, I'm just, I'm going to edit it people, that's what I'm trying to say. All right, go fuck yourselves. And not putting it all up. All right. Youtube videos of the week. A fat kid goes insane after getting air horn in the face. Try to guess what that one's about. Fat Kid goes insane after getting air horn, air horn in the face. Ed, uh, this kid, his face, he looks like, if, if precious was a white eight year old, just picture that face. That's what this kid looks like. All right. Here's what I'm sure everybody saw us says face verse watermelon. This is somebody on the amazing race. It took a sling shot and shot a watermelon on a fucking candle up. I don't know what it was, and it came back and blast her right in the face. It's absolutely hilarious. They

Speaker 11:         01:43:51       actually showed it on ESPN. They did the top 10 funny sports moments of the week and hers was number one. And you know what they did because she's abroad. What they had to do was they put, you know, you know when they had the list of shit that they're going to talk about coming up on the right hand part of the screen on and nowhere right before the cantaloupe or watermelon blasts her in the face, they put that up and half censored her head. Cause I can guarantee you there was some woman there going, this is going to Jeff, it's going to um, cause violence against women. How is it going to cause violence against women? Because the way the watermelon just slaps her in the face is Jay. It was self self-inflicted. That's one of those things, once again, those double standard. If a guy did that, do you think they'd censored?

Speaker 11:         01:44:41       What if it came back and hit him in his nuts and he actually lost the ability to have a child? They still would've shown that completely uncensored. Wait a minute. Is this a special guests who just walked in? Joe, I got lucky. I got another eight minutes. Just sit down and help me throw it. Oh, don't be a fag. Get Elvia pick up the microphone. Ladies and gentlemen, look who just walked in. Hey folks, Joe to Rosa. Oh, are you? Jesus Christ. Joe, what are you doing here? I uh, you know, I'm just walking through the studio bill or I saw you through the glass. This is like that moment when fucking Johnny Carson and walked over to, uh, what's his face, his sitcom when he was doing CPO. Sharkey remember that when he broke his, uh, what's his name? Dom. Dom. Dom Delouis. Don Rickles. Yeah. He just kept walking and this is very old school.

Speaker 11:         01:45:28       Yeah. I just actually alluded to them. Uh, and not even alluded. I mentioned that we did a podcast. I finally did talk to her. We did a podcast last night, completely fucking shift faced and a of the hour and 14 minutes. How much do you think is going to be funny that we can actually chop up? I think at least four minutes of it was really good. I think the bulk of it was funny. It, which was at a good point about like, it's just a little too much all at once. Like you got to split it up a little bit and it just kept meandering and then by the end I was just really, I was really getting into your financial businesses of some deal that you had and we were like, yeah, we don't, we don't want that on there. Yeah. Yeah. Let me tell you about that concept as business chow.

Speaker 11:         01:46:07       It was really sloppy, but dude, I got to tell you a fucking hilarious on it you to, I loved it. I loved, I was little. I was, I was kind of an angry let's that whiskey shit dude bear. I'm a happy drunk. You know. Don't blame them. Don't blame the whiskey bill. No, no. I'm already angry. But like when I, when I'm fucking, when I'm sober, I keep, I keep it in check for the most part, for the most part, but when I drink whiskey, then I'm not, if I drink beer, you know, I got my arm around people and we'll all go down together. They're all singing songs. Right. I'm good time Charlie with the beer. I start drinking whiskey. Oh, it's awful. Do. Can you finish chewing? Whatever's in your mouth to fingernail is biting my nails through the just checking. No, I'm sorry. No, spit it out. You yelled at me to get over here and shit. Yeah. What do you want me to do? I want you to fucking up.

Speaker 12:         01:46:55       See what happens. Why be a professional, you know, Joe, you look at this, you know I was just going, I just went off on this. Can you see this woman here? She walked. She showed up at a, at a NFL practice. This former Miss Universe here. Look how she dressed at the practice. Oh yeah, we're can. Good. She's hot. Well what? Yeah, and I guess, and evidently somebody made some people made, she was subjected to cat calling Joe. Can you imagine that? You could look like that, dress like that and you can't go to an NFL practice without getting cash. She upset about it. Upset. She tweeted in Spanish that she was, I'm dying of embarrassment. She had to cover her ears. Yes.

Speaker 11:         01:47:38       Well look, I got to say though, she looks great, but she is wearing jeans and a shirt. It's like, what the hell is she supposed to wear something? She's in a mini skirt. Okay,

Speaker 12:         01:47:45       Joe, she's wearing high heels. Look at a Joe. How tight of those God damn jeans righteously today, Really Gel. What would you do with that Joe? Uh, Bill, me fucking

Speaker 11:         01:47:54       leave it in disappointment. Look, I'm not looking. I'm not condoning that you shouldn't. You shouldn't do that day she was asking for it. She was though. She is Jesus. What the hell she's supposed to wear? What's he supposed to wear? Sweat pants. Joe. Is it possible for those genes to get any tighter? No, but that's how chicks wear their jeans. Chicks don't wear baggy jeans. They wear tight jeans and you know something. Joe, why don't you just walk back out the door and bring in the fucking Joe Derosa that I know. All right. All right, Joe. He's a no show the rock. I'm kidding. What Joe, if I walk through central park at three in the fucking morning dress like Liberace, singing almond, the money and I get the shit kicked out of me and I get mugged, it's wrong. I should be able to do that, but do I have any sort of fucking personal responsibility for my own fucking safety?

Speaker 11:         01:48:48       All right. You know, we'll go to a football practice. She's got high heels, shoes. She, you know what first thing that drops a girls sex sex is down by at least 30% is when they wear those flats. Is that the worst when you, when you're in a relationship and they get so comfortable that they stopped jacking their ass up? Yeah. And they just wear the flats and all of a sudden they look like, like they're a little clown climbing out of a car. Yeah. She should have worn those. You're doing your, you're preaching to the choir. I, I'm doing a bit of doing it my bit, a bit in my act right now about take your lashes like you chose this role and the why you defending this girl. I'm saying I'm, I'm you, you convert. You convinced me. The centerpiece, the center centerpiece of the or the bid is that, uh, it's about this fat girl cock blocking me with the skinny girl and doing the whole angry fat girl thing.

Speaker 11:         01:49:33       And it's like, yeah, it's just like, you know, I didn't eat all the egg sandwiches you did. That was your decision. You're going to get mad at me that I'm not leap frogging over your hot friend to get a shot of your Michelin man body. Right. That way there's nothing wrong with it. You're fat. That's okay. But take the fucking hit sometimes. You know what I mean? It's not fair to everybody else. You're waltzing around like you're a piece of tail. You're not, you know, he's sitting there like a walrus. Sunning yourself at the bar. Yeah. But my whole thing too is like, you know, I'm part Arab. If I wear a turban on an airplane, I gotta be ready for a couple of people to be like, Ooh, but what the fuck is going on over here? Come from your territory, dude. She is.

Speaker 11:         01:50:12       Look at, I'm not saying that she's a bad person. She looks like she's fucking gorgeous. But she doesn't. She doesn't look like I look at it. Who was at the shirt she was wearing? That's the, this is, well that's her at the super bowl. But is that the shot? The shot you showed me in the, in the actual article was the ass shot, is that what she looked like from the front? That is her. I mean that's not her at the practice, but yeah, that's what she thinks she's wearing that night club top. She's got like the diamonds on the tits. Tits. Yeah. Glittery tits shirt. Yeah. It's ridiculous. Glittery Ted. I mean, look, yeah, you can't, you got to understand, this is what pisses me off Joe, is it's NFL football. It's a guy sport. There's a bunch of guys playing it. Nobody asks you to fucking come there.

Speaker 11:         01:50:56       You inserted yourself into that situation and this, this, I'm repeating myself on the podcast, but just to hear your opinion, that's when don't you hate that one? If much guys hanging out and shooting shit and we're talking, then I'll send you this. Could skin with me ski. That's a lady present. And then all the fun just stops and everybody has to adjust their fucking behavior because you're there. You know what my favorite thing ever some hate is when, uh, like a waitress will say that to a bunch of drunk guys and there's always the one 50, you know, the waitress will go like, uh, is that how you talk in front of a lady? And, and uh, and then there's always one 50 year old drug that goes, well, why don't you show me a fucking lady? And I'll tell you, you know, it's such an old joke, but it always gets a laugh.

Speaker 11:         01:51:42       It always gets a laugh. That's just nothing. Uh, you know, somebody was telling me, um, I, when I was, I was out in Denver, they were saying that they will, they went out to go shoot pool. Right. So shoot, now I remember they were shooting pool and there was a, you know, they were kicking the shit out of these guys and there was this group of guys they had next, right? And then some girl Cottey comes up and she didn't want to fucking wait. She puts her money down, but she's so fucking hot that these other ball is jackasses. They let her cut, right? And then she's making this big, and then she's just such a already, just an arrogant fucking twat that these guys are like, look, we don't want to play. We don't want to play. You were going to play those guys, right?

Speaker 11:         01:52:20       And she gets blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, giving him shit. And he goes, look, we're not playing. You were playing those guys and she took a full drink and throw it in. This guy's oof. So I go, well, you can't hit on. What do you do? He goes, Oh, this guy's brilliant. He, he's a spitter. He doesn't, he just went, she goes, and he was so fucking, she goes, what are you going to do? And you get a hit me. He goes, no, I'm not going to hit need. Eagles hit her right in the chest and it rolled down between her titties. And this is the worst part. The bouncers come over, flipping the end. They fucking of course go. And, and those guys who she cut all fucking ran it at, at the dude who just did that shit. Oh, that's great. Just immediately fuck it all. Yeah, because spitting on somebody is so much worse. I'd much rather get blasted in the fid. I even take the brain damage. Did you ever hear that? Do you ever that Tony Roberts joke where he's like, he's like fucked up to hit a woman. I would never hit all right. I'm bullshit.

Speaker 2:          01:53:18       Okay.

Speaker 11:         01:53:19       But he's like, if you put your hands on me, I'll fucking lay out. He's all, that's awesome stuff. I could hit me fine. Don't do this whole bit. Go see Tony Robbins. Oh wait, I gotta finish this bit. It's so funny, Dude. He goes, you see those commercials? All right you guys. Every 12 seconds a woman is hit in this country. And he goes, he goes, they don't tell you how every eight seconds there's a bitch in your face. Go ahead.

Speaker 2:          01:53:42       How about buy, buy, buy, buy baby. And he goes, I warn you, bitch you at four seconds.

Speaker 11:         01:53:53       Tony Robbins is one of the most underrated comedians of all time. That guy is so fucking ridiculously talented. He's so funny. Yeah, I saw him on comedy central buckle. Ridiculously talented dude. He's unbelievably humble. I saw him on comedy central and he, I think he just starts the bit like this. He just goes and it was so good because I fucking hate Wendy Williams. He goes, Wendy Williams and Danny Glover or the same motherfucking person. All right, well we got to wrap up the podcast here. Joe, with the squeaky little voice. It really just annoyed me. Oh me,

Speaker 2:          01:54:30       Oh, oh,

Speaker 11:         01:54:31       here's another youtube video to watch. Uh, go to [inaudible] dot com, uh, bill dances. Classic bloopers. Joe Actually have to show you this one. This is like a guy trying to do a fishing show and one of them, I swear to God, I can't believe that it's actually true. He's going down the river and in the distance, the other cameraman from the two, they're doing like a two shot the chute, right? The other camera, first of all is in the shot and he's edging towards the, the bank to get a better shop and it's an eight foot drop into the room. And that guy with the cake falls into the fucking river and the, what's his face? He's one of those redneck guys who he gets mad, but he's like a, a classic dude so he doesn't curse. So he uses like those redneck, I don't know what the fuck they are, but he's just add dagnabbit two goes in the water and push her on it. It's actually, it's fucking hilarious. Hey, I gotta hop in the shower cause Bobby Kelly's meeting me here in a couple of [inaudible]. This is Joe. Bobby Kelly can, he'll come walking through the door. No, he's going to ring the buzzer and I gotta run. I gotta get ready here. So lazy boy. Oh No, it's my show. I tell you when we're, when we were up against the heartbreak and it's time for you to go, where are you going

Speaker 12:         01:55:44       Joe? You just going to put it down? He just going to tap out and walk out. Shower Jesus. All right, no problem. Joe. To rose, everybody Jode Rosa has a new CD out that I would have hiked, but he walked away. We'll give me the hype. What's the hype, Joe? When does it come out now Sarah? See John, if it was out, people would be talking about it. When does it come out? Oh, Jesus, it's out. It's called out the depression auction. Uh, and I endorsed it. Jolene ruck I'm on. He did when he or eat burned a bit on the podcast for you. Why am I yelling? Um, anyways, uh, I think that's going to be the podcast for this week. I'm doing a ton of media this week. Fans of the Opie and Anthony Program. I believe I'm going to be on there. Uh, definitely tomorrow. Hopefully Wednesday.

Speaker 12:         01:56:33       I'm basically going to be on that show as many days as they'll have me because, uh, I liked those sons of bitches. Um, that's it. No, seriously, if you don't listen to the opiate Anthony Program, I don't know what your problem is. Get an XM satellite, whatever the Fuck Sirius XM player. And check those guys out. Watch a little bit of this stuff on Youtube. They're, uh, they're, they're fucking awesome. So I'm going to be doing them this week. I'll probably be doing something on versus, and um, you know what, as I do them, if they're not live and they're going to be shown later, I'll just on the [inaudible] podcast, we'll have that information up there. But if you didn't get the, Oh, gee, she's ring tone, you can go to the [inaudible] podcast.com and on the left hand corner you'll see it right there. And you just click on o g g and you can get it, put it in your phone.

Speaker 12:         01:57:21       And then whenever the biggest company life calls you up, that's what your phone is going to be saying. Oh, gee, gold beach. Um, if you don't, don't do it. I don't give a fuck. I'm just happy you listening. All right, you guys have a great week and a, that's my prediction. Ravens will win. Um, and I dunno, jets, jets are patriots. I gotta be honest with you. Could go either direction, but I'm really liking what I watched on the ticker tape on the airplane. I have no fucking idea. I miss. I don't, I can't judge the Patriots, but uh, and I think the jets are going to get best. Mike go tenant six after all that fucking Yip. Yap. And they'll probably make it into the playoffs. God knows they got, they got enough talent on the fucking team, but I think all this shit talking is really going to hurt him and I don't, I don't think they're going to go as far as they went last year. What do you think about that? Huh? What do you think about that? Jets play like a jet. What the fuck does that mean? You haven't won one since 1969. What does that mean? Get your fans all excited and then you shit the bed in January. What Gel? That's what they do. Oh, they haven't won since. We were excited that we landed on the moon like that was going to lead to new real estate. That was the last time they want Joe.

Speaker 12:         01:58:33       I was six months old. Joe, six months old. Curt Gowdy announced the last time that they want a super bowl. All right. Jim Morrison was still alive. Joe, Jimi Hendrix was still putting out albums, Joe to Rosa the last time they won. And this same play like a jet all the way. I liked that west side story. That really is where we differ. You're talking about the jets and I'm singing the song that sounds like one of the oldest. They're really into that old school shit. You know what the sad thing about the jets are there? The only professional franchise and all four sports that actually sublet their stadium. Yeah, it, they play a giant stadium there. You know what they are? Joe didn't like that fucking loser who never moves out. And that window of getting married and actually meeting somebody just closes and then they just say fuck it. And they're just waiting for the last of their alive parent to die so that they can think they can take over the house. Uh, podcast.

Speaker 12:         01:59:38       Jesus. Joe, look at you. Come up with a little bit of anger. Joe. You know what? I hate out uninsured. Unashamed. You are about your torso. I give Joe Shit because his body, he looks like an adolescent. Will Ferrell. Like what picture will Ferrel's body at 23? Joe, have you ever done a pull up in your life? Do you like, do you even have those muscles now? He left me. I was really going to compare him to like the Camaro rally sport. You know, somebody goes out and you get the Iraq, right? You've got the air conditioner, you got the tee tops, you get the electric windows, and then you had the rally sport, which you basically had the same body, but you didn't have those options. I was going to go that route. Is that what you were going to do, Bill, where you're going to do it in a funny way because the way you presented that it wasn't too funny.

Speaker 12:         02:00:32       All right, that's the podcast for this week. Uh, God bless all of you guys. Let's go ravens. Fuck the jets and a, I'm hoping this time next week that jets are fucking oh into and if they are all went, I'm telling you right now, Rex Ryan, I am Guaran fucking team. It will cry during a press conference and he's going to be crying and his fucking, you know, bodies going to be jiggling. I hate the jets. I hate the jets more than I hate the cults now, you know, kind of helps it. They lost to the Texans. But yeah, the jets, I want nothing more than to watch them eat their fucking words. The arrogance of that fucking teeth. Look at that and you don't even know how to behave when there's a lady in the room. All right. Who gives a fuck? Ravens are going to win tonight. I'm going to have an extra 50 bucks in. The Patriots are going to beat him next week. All right? That's what my heart says. All right, you guys have a good week. Please watch my special Sunday night, September 19th 11:00 PM okay.
