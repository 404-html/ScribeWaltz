Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burr and it's the Monday morning podcast for Monday, June 11th

Speaker 2:          00:00:08       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:00:09       2012 2012 which I am actually recording on Sunday, June 10th which is my birthday.

Speaker 3:          00:00:17       My birthday.

Speaker 1:          00:00:20       It's your birthday. You fucking cunt. Another year's gone by. Your still sitting there in that fucking place. You don't want, I'll be so eat some cake. Blow out the candles, but not in that order or else you will burn your fucking mouth. Mouth. Mouf

Speaker 3:          00:00:53       f mouth.

Speaker 1:          00:00:56       Hey, did, did Manny Pacquiao lose last night? Is that what I heard? Somebody left me a message that he fuck he lost. That's unbelievable. I can't believe that little roided up guy couldn't do it. I think everything is fucking fixed. Don't listen to me. I don't think it's possible for a guy comes in and 109 pounds to put on 40 pounds of muscle, not lose any speed or any power. Get actually get faster and stronger. Okay. I've seen that show. It's called the fucking bionic man. That's the only thing that was missing. That's what they should have shown in the beginning of all packy. I'll fights was him crashing some experimental aircraft like John Denver, except he doesn't die.

Speaker 2:          00:01:38       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:01:38       You know, and John Denver would died, wouldn't have died. He would have lived if he wasn't wearing those stupid glasses. That's what did him in those little granny glasses, like he sat around making cookies and a tree, you know, like those Keebler Elf. That's what killed them. A lot of people don't know that. They thought it was massive head trauma and a, and a carnage to his rib cage area with the, with the vitals there behind it. You know, the floating rib that they gave over to that fucking contract couldn't stop eating the apples. Right. Wasn't that, it wasn't massive head trauma. It was very minimal, very specific. He slammed his head off the experimental dashboard and, um, his mainstream glasses then shot it through his eyes into his brainstem, rocky mountain hack, Colorado. And then he died. And that's what happened. Everybody blamed the aircraft, you know, but everybody who actually goes out and gets a pilot's license, I believe on the first day they tell him not to wear those glasses. When was the last time you got on a plane and you saw your pilot wearing those John Denver glasses. All right.

Speaker 3:          00:02:44       There's a reason for that. Think about it. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:02:50       what am I talking about here? Can they show that fucking John Malcovich talking to his phone and just having the time of his life commercial one more fucking time. What's more annoying that one or where that weird family does the, uh, the acapella version of Ozzy Osborne's crazy trade with that random black kid in the back. Like where did they get that kid? Like, you know, it was he an exchange student and he just seems like he's over all of it and not enjoying hanging out with the other white people as he fucking shakes the ice in his, in his great drink, you know, and then they gotta end that great song with the parents singing like they're on Broadway. Right.

Speaker 4:          00:03:29       Go.

Speaker 3:          00:03:33       You know

Speaker 1:          00:03:35       anybody else with me on that? John fucking Malcovich sitting there all, you know, if that, if that commercial was 30 seconds longer, he'd have the phone. Like, like blowing him. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:03:48       Tell me a joke. Do I have anything coming up tonight now? Oh, okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:53       Lobster souffle or whatever. Pretentious fucking foodie orders. Was it pretentious, Bill, or are you just not cultured and in his order made you feel dumb. All right, you got me on that one. You got me on that one. Um, I'm the only one who was creeped out that there's a fucking robot in my phone. Well, whatever it is, it's that they try to make it human. Why did they do that? Just make it sound like a robot.

Speaker 5:          00:04:18       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:19       How can I help you? Massage Parlor. Gary's Mhi rack. My brains just do it like that. So I, it's still keeps that like we keep that distance. I don't need intimacy with this thing that isn't fucking alive. I don't need that 2001 space odyssey experience. That's all I'm trying to say here. People, oh, he's bill burr. He's mad at phones. Get out of his way. Everybody. This guy's got something to say.

Speaker 4:          00:04:47       What's the deal with y'all?

Speaker 3:          00:04:50       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:04:52       You have a wonder if you're going to stand the test of time, your decisions. You know what I mean? I had a fucking panic attack last night, you know, turning 44 years old. I just woke up mill and night like Jesus Christ, I'm sliding into 50, you know, and I don't give a fuck how well you take care of yourself when you're 50. You fucking look 50 unless you had some fat for your ass blasted India face and then you just look shiny. But everybody knows you're 50. You're not fooling anybody with your real housewife for forehead, Aria, for forehead. Eight head. Huh? Is that show still on? You know, how long are they going to keep doing that to the clams are hanging out in their bikinis. It's not how it is that, how am I going to do that one for? Let's try to beat beat out the drew Carey show. How many fucking episodes that mummy years of that fucking show did they do while people still didn't give a fuck?

Speaker 3:          00:05:53       Um, the

Speaker 1:          00:05:54       second they rolled in that fat lady with the makeup, I mean, right there, it's just like, we're really not going to develop anything on this show. Are We? If we're just going to try to keep it, uh, just kinda keep it wacky. Um, ah, Jeez. There goes the phone. Hang on a second. Hang on a fucking second. Christ's sake. Why don't I shut the damn phone off? Who's this? Who's this dopey? My mom. It's my dad. Oh. I just chose the podcast over my own father, who I owe. I owe a huge apology to. I owe a huge apology to my dad. All right. Last night I was sitting on a couch Bududa Lou do it mine and my own fucking business. Lou Lou Lou. Dude. I was watching metal mania on VH one. Metal Mania. Cleo.

Speaker 5:          00:06:44       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:06:44       I think my dog is sleeping with, with his eyes open. Oh No. She just moved her eyebrows. Dude. Where the fuck did you just go?

Speaker 5:          00:06:52       Uh Huh.

Speaker 1:          00:06:53       Cleo. Whatever you're thinking about, it's going to be okay.

Speaker 5:          00:06:57       All right.

Speaker 1:          00:07:00       Anyways, you know, it's weird when my dog sees a squirrel through a window, it, it cries like it's a long lost buddy. But if my dog is outside and there's a squirrel, you know, if there's no window between my dog and the squirrel it, we'll try and rip his fucking head off so I don't, does anybody know anything about dogs? What is it crying about? Is it crying? Like, Ooh, I want to rip it set off. Oh, I wish I could just end. That thing's fucking life. You don't make any sense to me anyway. So I'm watching fucking metal mania alliteration. This has gotta be a hit show, right? So I'm watching this shit and uh,

Speaker 5:          00:07:46       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:46       At the risk of pissing off a lot of listeners, I think most metal slash hair metal, it arguably is the worst fucking music ever made. Worst the disco, I don't know why disco gets such a bad rap. Like disco was the, is that the default example of bad music? The Way Hitler is, the default example of, of evil duties. The next Tatler it's always the next fucking Hitler never pull pot yet. No, never a fucking, I dunno. Pick a noun. I don't even know another one.

Speaker 5:          00:08:22       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:23       You know, Ivan, the terrible, was that a wrestler? Was that a comic strip? I know. Horrible. Haggar I don't fucking know. Right. See, I don't even, I don't even have any other examples. Whose fault is that? Bill is a library right down the street. I'll go fuck yourself. You know what I'm saying? Um, everybody always talks about disco and how bad disco was and it just needs to be a change man. Right? And like then they'll talk about like the, and all this new wave shit and the punk scene and all that, but what they, they completely fucking ignore is that right after disco, uh, just immediately the mainstream then went over to like this fucking heavy metal music, like that was better than disco. I think it's fucking worse. And I think all these times where they keep saying that everybody there was a big change and that this quality music came out. I don't know if that happens. I think it just, you know, you know, nirvana comes around and they're, what, four years later, everybody's listening to fucking old town or the main stream is, it's just this long, tragic, just flat line of shit music. I was watching the shit last night, shit that I used to like, and my jaw was on the ground. How fucking bad it was. It was horrible. I, I actually, I was so bad. I was like texting paragraphs to the sensation Joe to Rosa capitol records. The guy who built capital records. Joe Rosa, I'll actually, you go, wow. I'll get a little intimate here with you. I'll, I'll read you the text message I fucking wrote Joe. Uh, Joe, where the hell out here? Where the hell are we?

Speaker 2:          00:10:10       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:10       Joe Hair slash heavy metal is the worst music ever made. Disco gets a bad rap watching metal mania on VH one. Guns and roses. Queens, Reich, wasp, quiet riot. David Lee Roth Solo Shit. It's fucking God awful. Yeah. I saw David Lee Roth on, on his, uh, eat them and smile tour and I saw that video last night. Go wing crazy

Speaker 6:          00:10:39       from day he,

Speaker 1:          00:10:42       that sounds like a song Wahlberg's character would have written with John C. Reilly and Boogie nights. I remember that

Speaker 6:          00:10:51       he will rock you

Speaker 1:          00:10:55       and he will low you like it was, it was that bad teenage Frankenstein. I'm a teenage package died. You're telling me that that song is better than more than a woman? You know, I think arguably it's, I dunno, I can't believe the shit that I used to watch and like I used to listen to this shit around checks, you know, just hopelessly thinking that this would get me laid. Like they would think that I was some Badass, like Loner Bang

Speaker 1:          00:11:37       your, I mean, the whole fucking, the fact that I never got laid in high school, it just fuck it went away. Right in that moment. It was like, this is what I was going to do. I wasn't going to try to make them laugh. I wasn't going to hit on him. I wasn't going to try it. I was just going to play this music around them and this was going to bring me to the fucking promise land looking like a fucking teenage Ron Howard. That was my game plan. Is it any wonder I failed Jesus Christ? And I remember I would be watching it on a big square TV. Um, just watch it. Lay it down. Lay Your Dad is fucking horrific fucking music. And my dad would come in and just have his face would just be all twisted up, gone. Jesus Christ. What the fuck? You listen to it. You like to shift. And I thought I was a rebel. I mean he doesn't know. Understand man. You know what? He totally understood. He totally understood. My Dad called it back in [inaudible] 83 called it jungle music, says a bunch of shit. He told me straight up gay man, he was like, son, this music you're listening to is fucking horrible. And there was all these shout at the devil. Is anybody really going to sit there and defend that fucking song? Doodoo

Speaker 7:          00:13:04       delay

Speaker 1:          00:13:06       Doodoo Doh,

Speaker 7:          00:13:09       Doh, Doh, Doh, Doh, Doh, Doh, Doh, Doh, Doh, Doh, Doh.

Speaker 1:          00:13:14       You couldn't find that you do. You could fucking, a five year old could write down on a xylophone shout at the devil. Never knew why we were shouting, you know, blacking lawless, blackie lawless, that was his show name. And he took a radial arm saw and cut the blade in half and put one hat, one blade, one of his forearms at one or the other on these leather. Uh, I'm going to do a bunch of dishes in an evil way. Gloves and we all thought it was crazy. Can you imagine if we gave you a forearm shiver? It was just Eddie used to throw fucking raw meat to the crowd. A couple of them did. That's why that lady Gaga covering or clam and that fucking Pastrami, it's just been done. You know, comes out in a fucking egg from Mork. I Dunno, I've seen the nasally horror act my whole fucking life. You know those fucking checks with the big noses. They can, you know, that's like white people's answer to the big black girl who can sing at church. We, we what, what the, what the check we bring to that fight is the, the white chick with the big nose white chicks with big noses can sing. I don't know what it is. Barbara Streisand,

Speaker 1:          00:14:35       right. I Dunno. It's like their nose is, it's like that dome at the top of all those con con uh, concert halls. There you go, Bill. Try to spit it out. You dumb fuck. But um, I, some emails people, I want people try to tell me how a rowdy crowd love book, by the way. Good. Damn. It'd be, tell me the musical validity that that has over like disco, that all those people probably had Comiskey plaque when they blew up those disco records like fucking five, six years later. That's what they were listening to.

Speaker 2:          00:15:20       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:15:21       Nope,

Speaker 1:          00:15:30       that was a hit. It was a hit in the 80s.

Speaker 5:          00:15:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:15:38       Wow. Do I owe my dad an apology? I just, I was sitting there just one video after the queen's Reich. I mean, all this stuff that I thought was just fucking unbelievable. You know what? I'm going to get emails this week. It's like, I don't know what it's going to be. It's going to be like, people either going to be like, yes, absolutely. This is going to be, there's going to be no middle ground. If he was going to 100% agree with me or a, I'm going to get punched in the face by Eddie trunk.

Speaker 5:          00:16:10       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:16:12       I just, I was taken aback. I mean, I haven't seen those videos and fucking forever Kasian I'll go back and I'll look at some old videos, but I mean a lot of it was like ACDC, like shit they can like, you know, I mean back in black is timeless. There's some timely shit in there. You know? I even watched that guns and roses, sweet child of mine and I thought, I thought it was horrible.

Speaker 8:          00:16:38       Wow.

Speaker 5:          00:16:40       Please.

Speaker 1:          00:16:42       And that little fucking Shim Sham dance he was doing, it's just was

Speaker 2:          00:16:48       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:16:48       Oh, and then the emotion he tried to have in the end.

Speaker 8:          00:16:50       Wow.

Speaker 1:          00:16:54       All right. And they kind of closed his eyes like, ah, I really went somewhere when I've, I was just fucking horrible. You know, I was right down. I helped hold it up. Oh, def Leppard, pour some sugar, rob me. I hated that when I fucking came out and all the ladies liked it and he came out in his acid washed jeans. I actually saw him on that tour, didn't I? Yeah. Reynolds' Coliseum and Tesla opened up Tessa, which I didn't think they were that bed. They weren't that bad. I Dunno. I thought you're supposed to go back and listen to the fucking music of, uh, of your youth being like, wow, that stuff was wow. That was awesome man. I remember that. And then, you know, that was the first time I tried blow, you know, reminiscent

Speaker 1:          00:17:43       actually first time I ever saw cocaine, uh, sought and saw it being done was a, at the providence civic center. I saw ACDC on the who made who tour with loudness, the Japanese heavy metal band that couldn't speak any English yet. Sang in English. Um, I just can't imagine the disconnect as yours. I can't imagine like memorizing a bunch of Japanese and going and over there and just singing it and then not knowing, uh, what the fuck I was saying going out there and everybody just be like, I have no idea what I just said. Tee Shirts at 20 bucks. Did I just say that or did I say, are you ready to rock? I have no fucking idea. Um, anyways, so I saw them, they opened up and uh, anyways, we're out in the parking lot and we're drinking beers. They can work crazy driving of course, cause it's the 80s.

Speaker 1:          00:18:43       This was right around before, right before mad kicked in and they used to bring like wreckage from a fatal drunk driving accident. Anybody else's high school do that? They actually brought a car from a fatal drunk driving, uh, accident. They dragged in onto the lawn of our campus. You want to call it a campus? A little island with the tree. They just left it there and we all just stared at it trying to figure out how many people were in the car, how many people died. And then we just walked away. Like, you know, when you're young, you don't give a fuck. 10 minutes later you're talking about, dude, I can't fucking rap tonight. Rat. That was the word. Get wrapped. Getting steroid handed, right? So anyways, we're driving down their beer between your legs. As you do see eighties, you know, you fucking lifted weights all that week.

Speaker 1:          00:19:34       Never all of it above the waist. Curls, fucking bench shoulders. Nobody did squats in the 80s. Nobody did. Right? So you got your fucking tight five oh one blues on with the Little Pencil fucking legs. Then you overdeveloped upper body, you stupid gold chain and a, he had a beer between your legs. That's how he did it. So we're fucking going down. There were probably on eight a piece fucking hammered. Uh, I was driving this piece of shit. 83 Ford Ranger. I got like five fucking drunk friends in the back, which was still not even grounds for getting pulled over. You could just have people in the back, like you bring in fucking turkeys off to slaughter. Nobody gave a shit. Right? So we pull in and right as I pulled up and it got a parking spot, there was this kid, he had his door open and he kinda had like a Sammy Hagar meets John Fogarty haircut blonde hair. And I remember he fucking did align right as I was pulling up. And I had fortunately had my window up and he saw me and he saw, we all had ACDC tee shirts on or whatever, and he just got to, the cow is just, it's like a haunted house right

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       up to the fucking window. And I was just trying to take it all in like, okay, he just, how am I supposed to behave around somebody with, with WHO's on coke? Does this guy have like, you know, Hulk Strength Right now? Is he going to tip over the truck? Um, anyway, so that was the, Fred was the first time I saw blow. I don't even know what the point of all that was. I was just shocked. Look, I know it wasn't all bad like the street early Metallica, you know, right through and justice for all. I know that that stuff was great, but uh, I'll tell you it is slim. Fucking pickings, my friends slim pickings. Um,

Speaker 5:          00:21:29       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:21:29       Ah, I don't even, I didn't know what to tell you.

Speaker 5:          00:21:34       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:21:34       I mean, I even go back sometimes I try to listen to appetite for destruction. I know that's this, this watershed fucking moment and that music with some of those fucking songs,

Speaker 6:          00:21:44       they're out to get me. So you can stop me.

Speaker 1:          00:21:49       Take that one to heart, kill yourself. Um, all right then I'd get me a lot of fucking criticism.

Speaker 5:          00:21:59       Okay.

And if you're going to buy anything on amazon.com instead of just going directly there, just go to the podcast page on my website, click on the banner and a, whatever you buy on there, they kicked me a percentage and then I take 10% of that. Give it to the wounded warriors project. And now you can feel good about yourself knowing that you helped a group of people that truly needed it.

Speaker 1:          00:25:52       And one jackass who, uh, probably doesn't. All right. All right, let's start it off. Good. It started off as a good read. You know, it's a good read or that three o'clock. Hi. Um, all right, let's get back to the, uh, the podcast. Um, all right. What do we got here? She would, you know what? I think it's time. I think it's time for a, uh, for uh, for, for one of a pyramid scheme. Let's read this one. Hello Mr. Byrd. I liked that. Very formal. A lot of respect. We did it out of respect. We were wise guys. We did what we wanted. Um, I am writing to you today because I need some help about something. Uh, recently my girlfriend's father, mother, father separated. Thank God, uh, started reeling, really annoying everyone with calls, emails and meeting requests for some Mlm Multilevel Marketing, Aka pyramid schemes.

Speaker 1:          00:26:53       I was pyramid schemes. Retarded little brother. All right. Your girlfriend's father started really annoying. Everyone. Okay, I'm, I'm back on Pacey, right. At first it was, please look at a DVD about a poor guy becoming a rich guy by spending his time building a water aqueduct instead of wasting his time, like the second guy doing the hard work and carrying the water on his back to the village plan for the future, they said, or some other bullshit of that sort. Uh, there's been a few other great and amazing business opportunities that I could just delete from my inbox. But this time it's just gone too far. Okay, so first they gave you the DVD, then he's sending you some emails and it was sort of, yeah, whatever, you know, use the DVD as a doorstop or maybe to break up your weed and then you just delete the emails.

Speaker 1:          00:27:39       So, so far he's not being annoying. Let's move onto the second. That's the first 10 pages of this screen play. All right, let's move on to the action here. Now he requires all of us to drop all our phone internet providers to go with his offer. What do you mean he requires you? He actually can't get anyone to go along with that crap. But as in every fable, he's got many pseudo facts about a big thing that will come, oh, big thing that will make this company rich and that for the small fee of $500, we can start selling those great deals to how is this shit legal? Um, by now he's contacting me everyday, text message to Mimi, emails, Facebook comments, all of that. At first he was nice. Now we starting to use his skills on me saying things like, he's doing this for me and for his daughter's future.

Speaker 1:          00:28:32       I couldn't believe he argued back when I told him I believed it was not worth my time and effort for the little monetary reward. Good for you. He said I was wrong not to want to do it. I mean, my opinion is wrong. Lol. Uh, in any case, if it was anybody else, I would take pleasure. Why can't I read this week? I mean, I know I can't read every week, but this week I'm just really just, was it cause I just had bacon is the grease fucking up my clogging up my synopsis here. All right, let's try this build. It's dragging a little momentum. In any case, it was anybody else. I would take pleasure out of telling him to go fuck himself with his residual income and that I am perfectly happy to be a fucking loser with the linear income. Uh, he taught me those terms.

Speaker 1:          00:29:19       Yuck. Uh, I want to tell him that I would like to work by the hour better than having to beg or suck a dick in the back of a gas station to sell a phone, Internet package that will be worth a few points. I already have a great day job. I work on my photography. I played PC games. I jerk off a lot too. I have no time for this. Not that I would even not, I would even if I had the time, I'm thinking of a good old fading technique I learned in the past. Love relationships, but we'll always be there at Christmas parties and such pitching his bullshit. Please help me before I strangle him. Thank you. Uh, all right. What do you do here? Well, you've already done what I said what I was going to fix it say was basically say I'm not interested. Um, why don't you make your own DVD and what'd he hands you? A DVD of what you should be investing in investing in you. Just hand him a DVD of you going, thank you for your interest in making me a millionaire. Unfortunately at this time I am not interested. Uh, please don't try again later just to see how annoying he is. Why don't you start spamming him? Nah, that's gay. Don't do that. Sorry. I'm fucking throwing shit against the wall here. What can you do?

Speaker 1:          00:30:37       Why don't you just, anytime he starts bringing it up, just anything. Oh, Jj is just fucking yell something. Why don't you just go all my God really loud and walk out of the room every time he does. How about you get an Air Horn and anytime he brings it up just right in his face. Something. I don't know what I mean I don't, I don't know. You already told the guy you're not interested.

Speaker 1:          00:31:05       I can tell you what you don't do. Don't bitch about him to your girlfriend. All right. He's his own separate annoying entity. And uh, always keep it a joke between you and your girl. You know, that's the only way you could do it. If you really care about this girl and you want to and you want to stay with her, if you don't, this is a great reason to fucking dumper. But I mean, I don't know what to tell you. Uh, this is your girlfriend's dad. And, uh, to be honest with you, if he wasn't doing this shit, he probably do something else that would annoy you. You know, maybe this is his passive aggressive way of trying to just ruin a part of your life because he knows at the end of the day, you're fucking his kid. You ever think about that? Why don't you stop being so selfish?

Speaker 1:          00:31:51       Put yourself in his position for as an annoying as his, his, you know, pyramid scheme is the end of the day when you need your Dick Suck. You're going to this guy's daughter. So you know, if, if you, if you look at it that way, I think that you're winning. All right? All right. Bill fathers is another topic. Uh, what's with fathers having this, the standard ringtones, standard father's shoes and not giving a shit what they were for a hat. Oh, I can answer that. Despite the fact that I'm not a father, I know what that is. It's what I've been fighting my entire adult life is having the woman in your life just wear you down. It's not that. And then just the

Speaker 5:          00:32:40       laws in society, it's

Speaker 1:          00:32:43       what happens when you get married is a guy, is the, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:32:51       the pilot light goes out for a lot of things. You just don't give a fuck anymore, you know? I know you have kids, so you put them first and all of that type of shit, but this, it, as much as it's, from what I've heard, having a kid is the greatest fucking thing ever, and I'm not making fun of that. But there is a part of you that dies, you know that howling at the moon that fuck it. You know, don't want to, I just living this, just something, this is a part of life that just dies and you just don't give a shit. You're a beaten man. All right? You gave him the love. You're married. There's no way out without just fucking having your wallet ripped out through your balls and then back into your chest cavity, through your heart and through your spinal cord.

Speaker 1:          00:33:41       You're fucked. You're looking at a beaten man. He doesn't give a fuck. All I need is the phone to make a noise, you know, and I can, I know it's ringing and I'll answer it. I just need these shoes to cover my feet so it doesn't hurt. If I step on a nail and I don't get wet when it rains and I don't give a fuck, I just don't want to get a sunburn on top of my head. I'll fucking wear whatever hat you give me. I don't give a shit. You just don't give a shit after awhile. I guess what it is. It's really sad actually when that part of you dies. You know what I mean? Like I hate all that. That midlife crisis shit that people talk about that if you're in your mid life, you can't go out and have a good time if you go out and get hammered.

Speaker 1:          00:34:26       If you buy a cool car, you know if you haven't played guitar forever and then you want to start playing guitar again, it's like you trying to recapture your youth. Now I'm trying to fucking live. I'm trying to, to have something that excites me. You can't be excited beyond a certain fucking age. When are you going to grow up? I think it's time to grow up and if anybody says that, even if it's a woman, you slap him right in the fucking face and say, how dare you. That's how you get away with it. Because the second the bouncer sees you slap a woman, the face, he's coming over there to choke you out. But if he hears the magic phrase, how dare you, he stops in his tracks cause he's immediately knows that the woman was completely out of line, that that works. Try it out this weekend. Slap a woman in the face and then scream. How dare you. I guarantee you that the physical way that you're removed from that bar will be less than if you just hauled off and slapped. A woman is haul off and slap a woman. You're an animal. Okay? If you, if you say, how dare you right afterwards, you're sort of the victim.

Speaker 1:          00:35:41       That theory has never been tested. Um, if you're a faithful listener, I'd like you to try it out. Not just randomly. You know, you got to find a woman that deserves it. In other words, stand in a bar for about eight minutes. This is bad. Don't do it. I do not Cook Doug. Uh, the slapping of women. That was actually to get me out of any legal trouble and I said it in a funny voice, so then I'll get in trouble. We're weren't you mocking or it wasn't that, it wasn't even the warning part of the comedy. Mr [inaudible]. Oh, go fuck yourself, counselor. Huh? What are you supposed to win when those Matlock suits? Um, all right. Do Roses. Bio To hell is this bill? I was reading Joe to Rose's IMD be bio and it said something like, he did all these things despite the fact that he was born without shoulders. Is this a fact? Um, no, that's actually people who say Joe, like that whole urban myth that Joe Rosa doesn't have shoulders is like the same thing like that Mama Cass from the Mamas and Papas died by choking on a chicken bone. You know, people just assume that that's why she died because she was a fat chick. But that isn't how she, she died of a, of a, of cardiac arrest. But the rumor started that she died choking on a chicken bone and a, and it stuck

Speaker 1:          00:37:11       like that Gerbil up Richard Gere's ass. That's just some urban myths that just never died, that just have no facts behind them. Um, Dan Richard Gere, he ain't get a durable up his ass and it got stuck or some shit. I don't ran the wrong way. Fucking fell asleep in a rest area up his ass. I don't know what the fuck happened, but um, you know that like, it's the stupidest thing I've ever heard of my life. And that was just clearly started by somebody whose girlfriend thought Richard Gere was dreamy and he just walked into a bar and just, just set it. I mean, I don't know how these fucking things start. Jode Rosa has shoulders. If Joe de Rosa did not have shoulders, it would be impossible for him to then, you know, he'd be missing his shoulder joint. He couldn't hold that microphone in the, the um, and drudging this way that he does the reality is what Joe is missing is he's missing the meat between his neck and his shoulders. That's what he's missing. Like it's a birth defect. Joe was actually born without collarbones

Speaker 1:          00:38:22       if you are in, which gives the, the fact that he doesn't have collarbones, it gives the illusion that he doesn't have any shoulders. And the reality is, is because his shoulders are aware that, I don't know what you call it, the shoulder taint, it's that meet between your neck and your shoulders. Joe was not born with that, unfortunately. And, and even sadder, there is no cure at this time, but that doesn't mean we're not going to stop fighting and we're going to have a benefit, which is trying to get, you know, it's hard to get all these guys, you know, get everybody's schedules lined up, but we're definitely going to have, um,

Speaker 1:          00:39:00       you know, some sort of benefit to try and get Joe some sort of prosthesis for a, you know, plastic collar bones. So, all right. I hope that clears it up, but, um, I'm not trying to take away the fact that he has accomplished amazing things for a guy who has a defective torso. You know, you ever think about that? Me collarbones are a bone that you really do take for granted. You know, he really is an inspiration that just why is this sensation? You'd have to be a sensation to achieve what he's done with that awful body, that awful hand that God dealt him. Um, all right.

Speaker 5:          00:39:42       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:39:42       All right. So Bill, you've been, you've been doing a lot of activities,

Speaker 1:          00:39:47       you know, when they say what do you, what do you buy the man who has everything, you know, what you do, you get them activities. My girl gets annoyed at me cause she goes, I don't know what to get you. You buy anything that you want. You know, I fucking a, and I do and I don't apologize for it. If I want to play hockey, you know, I'll go buy some skates. God dammit. I got to sit around and wait for you. Wait for a fucking birthday and a Goddamn desert with flames coming out of it before I get what the fuck I want. All right. And the words of Bobbi Brown, I made this money. You didn't, I'm fucking buying it. I want to buy a guitar. I'm going to fucking buy it. So she's, I don't know what to catch you. Should I get you a shirt? You know what? I'd rather you slapped me in the fucking face. Don't ever get anybody a shirt for a gut for birthday or Christmas. Said that's the go fuck yourself gift. Here you go. Here's something. Here's something that I could put paper around and you could, you don't buy anybody close. How dare you?

Speaker 1:          00:40:51       So the lovely Nia has, has been getting me a, you know, just, she got me tickets to the John Bonham birthday bash, which was the shit. Um, oh, that was one, a heavy metal video that I fucking loved. And really, it actually, uh, stood the test of time was the second album. Um, I liked the second skid row. Sebastian Sebastian Bach, Sebastian Sebastian Bach bill or Sebastian back. Sebastian Bach.

Speaker 5:          00:41:26       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:41:28       They had a couple songs on there that I liked. It wasn't all bad, but I mean come on. I was, it was shockingly bad. You went from that awful quiet right video to teenage Frankenstein. Like I just was, I couldn't, I couldn't fucking believe it. It was unbelievable. So anyways,

Speaker 1:          00:41:44       so the lovely Nia, yesterday she took me uh, uh, horseback riding over in Griffith Park and uh, oh I shouldn't have said that. Why did I say where we went? Ah, Jesus. Cause now I'm going to shit on it. Um, so we went over there. I've only written a horse once in my life. And the hard fucking thing about riding a horse when you've never written one or taken any lessons is when they start trodding is to stop your balls from slamming off the fucking saddle. There's a way you supposed to ride with them, which of course they don't explain. So I was kind of, you know, that was like my goal to learn how to ride a horse while it trots without having my nuts slammed, you know, backup into my body. Like I'm freezing to death. You guys are aware of that, right? Your balls pull up into you.

Speaker 1:          00:42:31       If it gets cold enough in a desperate attempt to preserve heat down there, they pull up into you. That's, that's, that's where that term freezing your balls off, you know, came, you know, if you stomp somebody long enough, like they will shit themselves, which is the, the genesis of a, I beat the shit out of him. Beat the piss out of him. You know, that's the thing about getting, you know, if you got the shit beat out of you, you already got the Piss beat out of you because the, the, the, the piss gets beaten out of you before this shit gets beat out of you unless you're dehydrated. All right, those, those are the, those are the different levels of, of an ass kicking. So anyways, we go over to this, this, um,

Speaker 1:          00:43:19       this place to go to go horseback riding and we go over there and there's these horses and the, the, you know, if you don't ride horses, the first thing whenever you see him aside from the fact that they're beautiful you like that is a big fucking animal and that thing is a 100% muscle. And if that thing kicks me in my temple, I am going to be drooling until the fucking till Jesus comes, I'm going to be done. And uh, so anyway, so we're feeding these things, you know, with their English man teeth, you know, really straight and yellow, you know, home you hand out like it's a plate in the sitting there with the soft little muzzle eating a carrot and uh, that was all the good types. And then, then we go to, uh, you know, there's all these good looking horses now.

Speaker 1:          00:44:06       Then we go to like go to the horses that were going to ride and they're all back in this pen and is like fucking 12 of them. They all have saddles on them and they just got this look on their face. You know what I mean? Like you remember in platoon when fucking Charlie Sheen's character just fucking lands in the nom, remember that? And it's, he's walking in, he's seen all those fucking troops home and he just sees that fucking look and if that's what those horses look like. And I felt like Charlie Sheen, I was waiting for one of the horses out. We got ourselves a crusade to here.

Speaker 3:          00:44:44       MMM,

Speaker 1:          00:44:46       I did. I felt like the uh, you know, the little bitchy guy going into prison, I felt all these things is, I looked at those fucking, they just had this one

Speaker 3:          00:44:56       vibe and uh,

Speaker 1:          00:45:00       so they pulled two horses out, one bigger than the other. And the bitch in me is like, I want the smaller horse cause I'm telling you the second you get on a horse, all you think is Christopher Reeve fucking lawn dart right in the ground. And then I wheeled myself out at some fucking benefit and act like I'm still enjoying life. Fuck that. Right. I drive myself right off the end of the stage, I'd go right along with it. Get myself a Tuxedo. Oh yeah. Everything's all good. Just fucking Florida with my tongue. And I zoomed myself right off. Hopefully hitting a TV executive, taking them out with me. Um, that's how I would handle that challenge in life because I'm a coward. So anyways,

Speaker 9:          00:45:41       I fucking,

Speaker 1:          00:45:43       you know, then I'm like, come on man, you gotta let your girl had the smaller horse. So now they go drag the bigger horse out and this thing is just fucking like, it's not rearing back, but it's making it really difficult. The thing is clearly communicating. I don't want to go

Speaker 3:          00:45:56       and uh,

Speaker 1:          00:45:58       so I get on this fucking thing.

Speaker 9:          00:46:01       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:46:02       And the guy, hey, you know, you could go right, your pull right to go left you Paul left and now you want to stop. You just pull it back. All right? So we start riding these things and they know the trail. They're just completely ignoring me. And Nia, you want to go left? They fucking Yank they head back. Like, go fuck yourself. We're going this way. I know, I know the trail.

Speaker 9:          00:46:19       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:46:19       All right. There. Fucking a, what's a, what's a word they use for some novice cowboy.

Speaker 9:          00:46:25       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:46:25       Ah, what does that word all right there. Huckleberry. Some of those western words. Hey, what is worst hair metal or some of that fucking patriotic country music post nine 11. What is worse to you? What is more cringe worthy?

Speaker 9:          00:46:41       You know, um,

Speaker 1:          00:46:43       shout at the devil or that, that Toby Keith, Uncle Sam's going to pull the boot in your ass.

Speaker 3:          00:46:51       Ugh. Um, oh my God.

Speaker 1:          00:46:57       Every dime that guy made in that song should've been thrown in his face and then give it to the troops or something else or just, and then the, and then the, then a partial of it would be to incinerate any record that, that, that track was ever recorded. The most pandering horse shit

Speaker 3:          00:47:14       you could ever come out with. A horrific, sorry, sorry. Plowing ahead here. So anyways, like

Speaker 1:          00:47:23       the horses were just in bad moods. They'll bite and in each other and they just like, at one point I tried to make the thing go left and went back and I tried to bite my foot and I said the knee, I go, Jesus, I go, this fucking thing hates me. And then I just thought, I was like, you know what? I'd hate me. Okay. If I climbed on my back and I had a walk me up this Goddamn Hill, I'd hate me. There's somebody said that, you know, they don't even feed a well over there. I shouldn't say that shit cause I named the place, I don't know, tried to claim it. They're over there. They feed them like fucking shredded wheat instead of the real stuff. I have no idea. But um,

Speaker 5:          00:47:56       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:47:57       It started off as this really peaceful thing to be riding the horse, which was awesome. And then immediately I just was just like, I couldn't get back soon enough because I wanted to get off. This thing's fucking back because I knew that that's what the horse wanted. You know, it's awful. Just fucking, it just, I think if I ever, if I have a fucking had a ton of money, I've said this before, I've ever got a horse I would get, I would buy a horse just so I would never ride it. So going to have, you know, maybe once a week just to show him who's boss, right? You plant those carrots, they're fucking Seabiscuit.

Speaker 1:          00:48:35       Anyways, I thought that was gonna be a funny story and I've just been a sad story. Kind of like the Boston Celtics losing games seven. Oh, that's, that kills me. That kills me that those guys, they're going to break up that team, man. I got to tell you, I've been, you know, I wa I was lucky Celtic fan when I grew up, I started watching and you know, in sixth grade when a Larry Bird came through and all that Shit, the battles with the 70 sixers the fuck in a Lakers and all that type of stuff. And um, I gotta tell you, I am hard pressed to think of another Celtic team that had more heart than the Celtics. This, this version of the Celtics, you know, they just never quit, never say die. It was brutal. I'm watching doc rivers getting all emotional when he hugged Kevin, Garnett was uh, it was fucking fucking brutal.

Speaker 1:          00:49:31       Brutal. But you know by him, he, he did that thing and you, I, I'm loving that Lebron, you know, Lebron's one of those guys that like, uh, I was like yeah, what a Douche bag when he said I'm going to bring my talents to south beach and all that. But I got over it after a while and then just people just kept hating the guy and it's to the point now I almost want to see him win. If I didn't like George didn't so much like either way I'm going to be really happy. Um, because uh, I would love to see Lebron get one just to make all everybody who hates him, unless you're from Cleveland, if you still hate Lebron, you're a Douche bag. You know, you really just hate some aspect of your life. But people in Cleveland, they should hate that guy and New York and Chicago, they should be annoyed with that guy. Cause he got you. You guys get you all excited. Like, you know, Chicago six fucking rings. They have the greatest player of all time. Michael Jordan. Okay. They roll out the red carpet for you and all you can come up with was, yeah, I found their, their offer intriguing, intriguing, like he was rubbing his little, uh, you know, I read books, beard, that he's grown, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:50:50       I'm into alternative medicine. Uh, half a goatee. You know, if you grow a fucking beard like Brian has, you better be like inventing shit somewhere, wearing some sort of a lab coat. All right. And stop putting on your fake black rimmed glasses with the clear windshield. Um, you gotta hand it to black people. They are the only ones who could make somebody within a fucking erector set look cool. They can somehow make that look appealing, I guess. But I got to tell you that NBA montage where they showed like 12 of them in a row all wearing those glasses was fucking ridiculous. But anyways, Chris Bosch killed us and all that type of shit. Uh, so I don't know. I have no idea. But, um,

Speaker 1:          00:51:34       I dunno, I thought that they hate fucking aren't it? They came out in the second half. They fucking, and they just never let up and we couldn't get back in it. And uh, I dunno. I don't know why the fuck we were trying to guard Lebron that far out. I mean, even van Gundy, the whole game was like, just make the guy take a jump shot. You fucking press up on the guy. He's too quick. He's gonna run by you. Once he gets to fucking a step and a half that freight trains common, you know, did, first of all, there's no way to get in front of them quick enough to get a charge. You're going to get hurt. All he could do is just try to hack at the guy and he's going to get fouled and it's either going to be two shots or an an one. So why not hang back? I don't know. Look at me watching fucking the NBA for a couple of weeks. All of a sudden I think I can coach better than doc rivers. Um, but anyways, I'm going to game six tomorrow night because the fucking kings have lost two in a row. Flows. You don't watch hockey man. They were a four game, three games to none. Going to close out the fourth game. I went downtown, got absolutely fucking hammered.

Speaker 9:          00:52:41       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:52:42       I planned on getting drunk. I did take this subway

Speaker 9:          00:52:46       and uh,

Speaker 1:          00:52:48       what I also planned on eating something went down there on an empty stomach and we found this fucking bar that no one was at that had this giant screen. And we was sitting there laughing lives two minutes before the game, there was nobody in there felt like we were on MTV cribs. We didn't have to pay for the house. And I don't know, we had two drinks. We turned around and the place was jam packed and then I went to order food and the guy's like, I'm sorry I'm not serving food now because the stupid manager didn't take into account that the kings could have won their first Stanley Cup ever and that this sports bar was going to be packed. So he just had one guy working in the bar. So while he was doing was making a make drinks and uh, you know, me, I'm trying to watch my girlish figure here. So I fucking, after a couple beers I switched over to crowns at, uh, I don't know what happened. I vaguely remember at the end of the game going out and getting a cheeseburger. And uh, the dude behind the counter,

Speaker 1:          00:53:47       you know, was a standup fan. So he knew me and my buddy and he gave us a drink and then he actually brought over some sort of like, and I never drink shit like this. He goes, you should try these out. They're really good. And it tasted like a milkshake, but it had, it was like a shot of it, but it had booze in it. I just don't do well with that Shit, you know, I don't like that cross pollinating, you know, a let's have a dessert and get fucking hammered. I don't do that. You know, let's go to a titty bar and get a cheeseburger. I don't do that either. You know, all the strip clubs that serve fucking food, you know, it's like do one or the other get, get one of these things to focus, need to be streamlined. All right.

Speaker 5:          00:54:26       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:54:27       So I'm trying to be the best buy a titties. Right. Um, just got absolutely fucking a knee. Variated went down on the subway and the subway, it's almost like the red line in Boston. Well one goes out to Braintree, the other one goes to Matt a pan. I was trying to go to Braintree and I got on the mat of Pan one by accident. I was like fuck. So I had to get off hammered, took it back the other way and I go, yeah, I want the brain tree one. Oh go downstairs. So I go downstairs and they still have two trains running on that track. So I fucking got on the mat of pan one again. It was actually the Wilshire one and uh, Oh God, I was fucking livid when I realized they made a mistake, looked over at other passengers. I was like, it's just fucking thing going down Wilshire. And somebody looked at his buddy's like, is he with you? And everyone laughed at me. I was like, Oh God, I'm that guy. Then I got off the platform on the platform and just had Tourette's fucking Goddamn fucking stupid ass fucking city. No fucking subway in the whole fucking countries are just absolute f bomb. And then some really nice girl

Speaker 1:          00:55:34       actually talk to me like ignored my cursing and my angry anger and spitting on the tracks. Just like, oh, did you get on the wrong way to like, yeah, it's fucking fucking fucking fucking. And then she's just like, yeah, it is kinda confused. She didn't, she didn't give it to him.

You know what's a great place to scratch your dog is underneath the call. Every once in a while they wear the collar forever. I take my dog's collar off like every night, you know, not because I'm a good dog owner. It's because she wakes up before I do and she shakes like a madman like this, like that. And it's basically my alarm clock in the morning. So I take this fucking thing off and then I give her a nice scratch on the back of the neck and she gets, you know that look, dogs get on their face where they kind of like, it's this weird thing where they don't move their body forward. They just move their face forward. Like, Ah God, that's what it's doing right now. And you liked it, don't ya? Huh? That's what you can't get to.

Speaker 9:          00:58:12       Alright, next scratch.

Uh, all right. This podcast is getting too long. All right, let's, let's wrap it up here. Why did we go here? Where did we go here? Uh

Speaker 2:          01:00:35       Oh,

Speaker 1:          01:00:37       what is this? Oh, there's somebody reacting to last week's that epic story, uh, that, that bisexual kid whose mom parents were really religious and how they find out he was gay was he was hooking up with, uh, is, is some dude in the house and she started whacking them with the male, uh, and it was just guy says Cybele I heard the bisexual, a gay dude story you told in your podcast most recently about the guy who moved from the Carolinas to Arizona for college and it got caught doing the deed by his mom. I am not gay. I do not have any gay tendencies or anything like that, but I've seen a similar circumstance happen with a close friend. I know that the dude's mom and the whole family feels awkward about him being gay, but the more indifferent they act, the more likely the 19 year old guy from Carolina, we'll end up doing something he will probably regret. Absolutely. Anyway, my advice is this, show your mom the movie prayers for Bobby and she will turn right around. I guarantee it. Hope things work out. All right. I don't know what that movie is, but if the person who wrote in last week, uh, go ahead and read that, go watch that movie will show it to your mom and hopefully she'll come around. Um, dilemma number one, Bill, would you rather have been born with this sporting talent to be an NHL all star or the musical talent to drum for ACDC after Phil Rudd? Ah,

Speaker 1:          01:02:06       that's a good, that is a fucking dilemma. MMM. God dammit. That's a coin flip right there. All, all right, well here's the deal. If I could play in the NHL, I play in the eighties despite the hair metal music that would probably be being played while I did the skate around at the beginning. That's a shoot around whenever the fuck you call it. Um, wait. Do I have my body? I mean, I want to be a tough guy. If I'm going to play in the NHL, I'm be, I have a a a eight. The very best a goal scorer, his body. And even then I'm too small. I'm barely five foot 10 guys could do that back then. Could I be, if I could be chippy every once in a while, Nevin mark what style? I don't know. Oh, the musical talent to drum for ACDC after Phil Rudd Wolf. I drummed for ACDC after Phil Rudd, I'd be Simon Wright from 83 to 90. Then I would leave to Joan [inaudible] and have to play last in line.

Speaker 2:          01:03:19       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:03:19       Or I could have been considering balding. Maybe I'd be Chris Slade

Speaker 1:          01:03:24       who drums from 90 to 96 and all of a sudden gets kicked out just because they want to bring Phil Rudd back. I don't like those endings. Those are, those are like running back careers was a real short, I know what, I'll take the Nhl all star, a fucking all star and I get to worry that that Campbell's or whales jersey. Oh, I take that have a fucking red mullet. I'm a Harris to gets curly when it grows long. I'd looked like Bernie from run to 22 I take the NHL. That was a good one. That was the old coin flip. All right, now, but to dilemma, imagine you're walking in a built up area and come across a glittery box. What does a built up area, curiosity compels you to look inside it and upon doing so, find it stacked full of child pornography, your prints and DNA or on the box. She can't walk away from it. If you set it on fire, what happens if the cops stop? If a cop stops you or a residence and they notice a half charred picture of an eight year, ah, he's burning evidence. If you handed it into the complete the police, you'd still be implicated. No, I wouldn't. If I find a fucking dead body on the side of the road, I don't get charged with murder. Quick light it on fire.

Speaker 2:          01:04:41       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:04:42       This is hilarious. Anyway, let me just keep reading this. Um, I'd be implicated as a suspect because I found a tin of child pornography and I brought it in. They probably give me shift for contaminating the evidence. That would look weird though if I walked in. Hey, I found this on the side. I kind of see where you go with this.

Speaker 2:          01:05:05       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:05:05       Ah, you just would, uh, oh, he's just saying no matter what, you just would get implicated. And I think you could do without headlines like comedian hands, child porn into police claims found it and he's misunderstood. Like Michael Jackson, if you decide to take it home to destroy it. What if you stopped by a gang of use on the way and it's knocked out of your hand and the entire Detroit depraved mass spills across the floor. Uh, if you don't get at home and turn it into a paper machete and the sink,

Speaker 9:          01:05:37       what

Speaker 1:          01:05:39       if you do get it home and it turns into paper machine, the sink. What if it blocks it? Or Nia asks what? You're up to. Nothing. They are just destroying images of naked. Preteens. So how would you deal with this terrible situation? A simple,

Speaker 9:          01:05:54       yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:05:54       Curiosity compels me to look at the glittery box. I would open it and upon seeing the content within, I would jump back like Morgan Freeman's character in [inaudible] seven, when he sees Gwyneth Paltrow's severed head in the box.

Speaker 9:          01:06:08       All right.

Speaker 1:          01:06:11       Then I would just start running in circles yelling. He has the upper hand until I'm arrested and put in an insane asylum. I just, if I've found, I would just, I would report it immediately. I would report it immediately,

Speaker 9:          01:06:30       you know, that's it.

Speaker 1:          01:06:34       I saw it, I opened it, it was in there and that's it. Go ahead. Parade a bunch of half naked kids in front of me and watch me not get aroused. There you go. There's my fucking defense. Go Fuck Yourself. I'm trying to help you guys out. Why don't you dust it and find the other set of friends and go start with that Douche. All right, now me and my pussy looking dog or getting Outta here. Go Fuck Yourself. Hi, I'm all right. Lights, camera dumped bill. I'm a 29 year old guy in recently broke up with a funny attractive and all around Greg girl. Oh Gee. Why Sir would you do that? You ask. All right.

Speaker 9:          01:07:09       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:07:11       Two things. Her Dad was born without teeth and you're worried your baby will if you braid with her or is she has got something going on in the vaginal area, some sort of odor, stinky pussy. I don't know. Well, here we go. Well, let me tell you, this girl and I had been dating for about three months and we had a great thing going. She's half Afro Cuban, half Puerto Rican and really sexy. She had a rough upbringing, but I didn't care because she's honest, easy going and not bitchy. Like so many girls I've dated. She was a bit needy, but I didn't mind. Um, we were out at a bar one night having a few drinks and I was feeling pretty good. I was looking at a couple of floozies at the end of the bar and asked her if she's ever been with another woman. She coyly looked at me and said, yes, good stuff. I thought, yeah, dude, this is a fucking fantasy right here. If I get a red shoe diaries. Um, then I proceeded with, have you ever been in a threesome with two girls and a guy again? She answered yes.

Speaker 2:          01:08:15       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       Okay. Kind of slutty, but I'm no saint. While he couldn't stop, they are God, you're going to go for the rotisserie question. What's in the box? Ah, here we go. Here we go. Strap yourselves in for this one. Well, I couldn't stop there. So I asked, have you ever had a threesome with two guys? She looked down at the ground and she looked up a bit ashamed, Lee and said yes. Wow. Skank alert. I thought I then asked her one more question. I knew this one could back for where the fuck do you go from here? Like throwing the high heat to Albert Albert pool hosts. I finally asked, wait, have you ever been in a porn? She then blushed and look me in the eye and said, yeah. I looked at her calmly and was like, oh, but inside I was like, Jesus fucking Christ. Yes. Well, you should,

Speaker 1:          01:09:17       you know those first couple. I mean, you can look at let, let's, let's break this down here. All right. She's been with, uh, she's had a threesome with another girl and a guy who get that. That's who gives a fuck right there. All right. You're already knew she banged another guy. All right. But, uh, the fact that she also did it with another girl, that takes a little fucking, uh, that tones down his dick in her pussy. Right? This is how guys think. Women, I'm sorry. All right. That's something that, that's something in the, uh, the credits that the credit a bit. Why, why, why do you try to talk with counting shit yet to dump. All right, that one's all right. The two guys thing. Now you can look the other way on that. Maybe if it, if it was in another state, but it can't be in the same state because if you run into one of the two guys that fucking, you know, we're high fiving as they fucking banged her that, I mean, I dunno about that one. But then the third one she did a porno. I mean, yeah, no, that's a,

Speaker 2:          01:10:23       yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:10:24       You got to walk away from that or, or you have to go to NASA to get tested for the latest fucking STDs, I would think. And then also God knows what's going on, uh, mentally that you would do that.

Speaker 1:          01:10:40       What I just liked sex, not on health is some going on. Who doesn't like sex? I Dunno. Anyways, plowing ahead. See, she's so, she egos. So basically she had moved down to Los Angeles when she was 20. She's now 25 and after a short stint in the military, somehow she got into the porn industry for eight months. She did everything. Ooh. Fox sucked the whole Shebang. I asked her if I could see her video but she wouldn't tell me her performer name and said Vietnam, the that it would be impossible to find her body of work. I asked her why she got into porn and she replies,

Speaker 2:          01:11:18       yeah

Speaker 1:          01:11:18       cause I wanted some feeling in my life. And then he writes Dao Ji Ji is, yeah dude. Oh this poor girl. Something happened to her. The thing was she was clean, had a good job and I really liked her and the sex was great. Yeah. Obviously, you know it's funny, there was something you wrote in the beginning where I just thought she was going to be good. 29 year old guy. Attractive all around. Great girl. Oh, the fact that you said she had a rough upbringing but she was easy going and honest and not bitchy right there. I was like, that girl's good in bed.

Speaker 2:          01:11:53       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:11:53       That just seemed like a kind of free open person. I Dunno.

Speaker 2:          01:11:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:11:58       I didn't know she was going to be that open. Oh Geez. Um, anyways,

Speaker 2:          01:12:02       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:12:03       The thing was she was clean and I have a blah. The sex is great, but I couldn't stop picturing her in some sleazy porno that was probably filmed in some junk yard on labrea. So I went to ask for a friend's advice. Most of my guys were telling me to dumper my gay friends told me it was fabulous and that I should overlook it. I didn't even bother asking my girlfriends because they would automatically reject her and assume I had aids. There you go. Keep your options open. So regretfully I dumped her.

Speaker 2:          01:12:35       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:12:36       I felt terrible and obviously didn't tell her it was because she was a porn star because she would have been ashamed for the rest of her life. And I was happy that she was honest with me. I've done my fair share of sleeves, but this was too much. My question bill was, Bill, my question bill, was it wrong for me to dump him for some decisions she made years ago? Should I have stayed with her? What would have you done? Um, well, you don't want to know what I would've done. I'm a fucking degenerate. So lets you, you seem like a good person. Um,

Speaker 2:          01:13:11       okay,

Speaker 1:          01:13:11       dude. When you're trying to find the person you're going to spend the rest of your life with you, you have to have a list of criteria. All right? You sound like you still young, so there's no reason to compromise. All right? I mean, when you get with somebody like that and you're going to live with them and you would, you get with anybody, you're taking on all of their fucking baggage. All right? You're only three months in.

Speaker 2:          01:13:35       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:13:36       And you know, people who go into the porn industry that, you know, it's like people will come. Comedians were not healthy individuals. Okay. And that is like a specific area that I just, this is just my own personal nonmedical feeling that you're just not a healthy person. Something awful happen. And that line, I just wanted to feel something. I mean, something bad happened to her, caused her to a wall or self off. I don't even want to try to guess what, but you know, there's nothing wrong with that. She did purse, you know, technically, and she was honest with it. It all comes down to whether or not you want to deal with it. All right? And if you feel that you know, you want to deal with it and that there was this sort of connection that you just had, this girl had to be in your life, then you're going to have to learn to live with it and get past it.

Speaker 2:          01:14:31       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:14:32       MMM.

Speaker 2:          01:14:35       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:14:36       But I would be definitely, I would definitely be concerned with a certain mental issues, um, now like she's insane. And then I would also be concerned with, uh, sexual boundaries,

Speaker 3:          01:14:58       you know,

Speaker 1:          01:15:00       like, would she have any, and could she remain faithful after a while and when you settle into the seven year itch or whatever, and you really start needing to work at the relationship and it's feeling boring and she needs to feel something again, is she going to go back to that leather couch from that show, Martin? My end, you know, down on fog in the valley and get bagged again. I mean, I don't know. I Dunno. That is a, uh, that is, you know what, that is beyond my skills. I don't know how to tame that horse. I can tell you that right fucking now. I have no fucking clue. That's a a, you know what? That's a doctor drew question. That is a classic doctor drew question. And that guy within two seconds we'll get right to the core of it. I would call out, call in love line man, if you're out here, call him up. Cause that's a, that's a great one. Um, yeah, I guess you'd have to figure out is, is has she worked through whatever the fuck she was working through and now she's ready to.

Speaker 2:          01:16:08       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:16:09       I mean, I dunno. Hey those are some good looking girls down there and she's like, yeah they are or whatever. Like, I mean if you kept steering it in that direction, you'd probably get you fucking threesome right there. Um,

Speaker 2:          01:16:21       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:16:22       So there's that, there's that option. The option that you have is if you're with her, like I think that's, that's a selfish fucking and I, and a shallow reason to stay with somebody long term,

Speaker 3:          01:16:33       uh,

Speaker 1:          01:16:35       that Jesus, I don't know. Great fucking emails by the way. Everybody open and Piss. You guys off too much by fucking trash and all that metal shit. You know, I have half those t shirts and I went to go see that. I was just embarrassed by some of that shit that I used to listen to. Um,

Speaker 2:          01:16:51       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:16:52       Oh Jesus. Right up until I was like 2021 fucking brutal. What, what, what, what redeemable thing that I have. I did listen to the Beatles, the doors to stones, all that white boy shit. Stevie Ray Vaughan. I did listen to Hendrix. I listened to all the big band swing. My Dad shift from the fifties. Uh, I had such a weird musical upbringing anyways, which was actually good because it was kind of all over the map.

Speaker 9:          01:17:18       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:17:19       I started hanging out with Patrice back in the day. Patrice was the one rest his soul got me the, uh,

Speaker 1:          01:17:27       I still remember when he got in that same piece of shit truck that I went to the ACDC concert and seven fucking years later, I'm still driving it. Right. Making the sacrifices. Remember that I told you, you don't get some fucking job and go out and buy a fucking new car. You just change yourself to your cubicle. I was kept Mike, I put a new engine in the fucking truck, had somebody slap that in there for 1200 bucks, pay that down rather than 12 grand for a new car like it was back then. Um, so when he was, I still remember

Speaker 9:          01:17:56       mmm.

Speaker 1:          01:17:59       Swinging by picking Patrice up and going into next and he had the cassette tape of re, uh, ready to die. And him putting that in.

Speaker 9:          01:18:08       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:18:09       Telling me that this guy was going to be the next guy. And then through all of that, like he cured me of all the rap that a white kid liked who lived in a cul de sac.

Speaker 9:          01:18:22       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:18:25       And he showed me all the, all of that shit. So I had that whole background, all that stuff fucking held up. But the fucking metals that I listened to, I even watched like Lawrence Welk when I was a kid, when the creepiest shows ever even that was fucking thrown in there.

Speaker 9:          01:18:41       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:18:41       It's funny, like fucking almost 40 years later I'll be walking down the street and all of a sudden Winchester cathedral, we'll be going through my head when Chester could thedro Bozzuto de to yell Brang and made down.
