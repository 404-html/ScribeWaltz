Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burr and his time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday, May 9th, 2016 what's going on? How you throw in there? Fuckos um, oh, freckles laying on his back trying to get rid of the Sayada cuts. Much better SCIATICA. Oh, cy. Anika, a lot of people don't know that was the original lyrics to Panama. You know, David Lee wanted to say, you know, Sciatica and Eddie wanted to an Alex wanted Panama and Michael Anthony, he's like, come on guys. You know, except he said it in a much higher voice. Can we fucking just get along here? And David ended up giving in to the brothers and that's what it, next thing you know, he was on his own. I'm just a Gigolo. So, um, yeah, my back is doing, it's doing much better. Slowly but surely I've, I've kind of found out that it's going to sort of work itself out if I just don't have to sit on my fucking ass from here to Jacksonville every other week. But that's the life that I live, you know, it's just the weirdest injury ever. Usually if you're fucked up, sitting down, you know, and resting is a good thing. This thing I just got to kind of, uh, lay down.

Speaker 1:          00:01:23       I'm a mess. I'm taking that fucking Ibu pro. I don't even, what the fuck it is. Some anti-inflammatory thing. I'm stretching like a fucking NHL goalie, trying to get everything all fucking undone down there, but I don't, I don't know what's going on. I don't know. But it is a, it is getting better. But I, um, I flew all the way back today from Jacksonville. Uh, had a great time. And by the way, here's, here's some, uh, here's some advice for you when you're out on the road and you're going to get a breakfast. All right? Unless you're in some mom and pop place and he could see over the counter, you can watch them making your food, which I don't necessarily really like to do. If you're gonna order eggs, don't ever order scrambled eggs. I know what you're thinking. Why, Bill? Why, why wouldn't you do that?

Speaker 1:          00:02:14       Cause they got a giant fucking VAT that they've made scrambled eggs or the fucking oatmeal of eggs when he go to restaurants. It's just, it's like the trail is Anya. It's just that is you fucking, you know, is your fucking eggs. Especially like this morning, the place where I went to Jacksonville, he ate at the Chili's restaurant in Jacksonville, Florida. I know you guys. You're jealous, right? Oh my God. He gets to see everything. So me and Forrest Shah who murdered it all week, um, we ordered the, the whatever, the American breakfast or something there and your only option on the eggs was scrambled. Okay. Now if that's the fucking case, that means they

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       got a giant VAT that was probably made, I don't know how long ago, whatever the health code violation is plus five minutes, you know, it's been sitting. So you get the rubber fucking eggs and then bacon, they just make a bunch of fucking bacon. They got that sit to the side,

Speaker 1:          00:03:15       you know,

Speaker 2:          00:03:16       and then they had to have bullshit Hash browns, which you know, was already all the whole fucking thing was already made. The only thing that really tasted good was the biscuit.

Speaker 1:          00:03:25       So, um, if you ever at the airport, you know, or if you're going down to the hotel lobby for their continental breakfast, um, you always never would have scrambled eggs or eggs over easy, get an Omelet, you know, um, do something like that where they just aren't going to just have the shit already made. Um, or you could do the gross shit with the syrup, but that's going to fuck your whole day up. I feel, I mean now like I didn't order a big salty breakfast, but for some reason a salty breakfast is as bad as it is. I can continue to function. But if you get a waffle or pancakes or French toast to that shit, you know, you might as well just have somebody puts you in a fucking sleeper hold. Cause cause you're going down and you're going down early. Um, so anyway, just a little travel tip for you there. Um, so anyways, you know, all this past week, uh, the lovely Nia, my beautiful wife was away and I was telling you how immaculate I was keeping this place fucking immaculate. All right. And um,

Speaker 3:          00:04:32       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:32       I literally like there was no trash in any of the barrels. All the fucking pillows were poofed up, looked like it looks like a show room. The living room. Right. I made the fucking bed, you know, it was spotless. I wiped down my side of the fucking sick, you know, brushing my teeth and all that shit spotless. Okay. I got a car washed and waxed, filled it up with gas, all of that shit.

Speaker 3:          00:05:00       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:05:01       Everything was done. Went through all the bills, got the junk mail, all the bullshit, the recycling fucking everything.

Speaker 3:          00:05:07       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:05:07       I did everything right. So I'm thinking she's going to come home, you know, cause I was leaving and right as I was leaving, she was coming home so he would just missing, yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:05:15       each other. Right. So I was thinking when she came home she was going to be like, like, Oh man, you know what? I might have to bring her in for this shit. You know what, I'm going to have to bring them in for this. Hang on one second. Hold on one second.

Speaker 2:          00:05:30       Hi. All right, so I'm back here. So anyways, let me keep setting this up. So my whole thing, Nia, was that when you came home, this place was going to be absolutely spotless. So you'd be like, oh my God, that's so nice. And then also you wouldn't feel like I was just hopeless SAP without you because that always bugs me. Like when women go like tag take tiff, they fall apart without us. Like, like I've

Speaker 1:          00:05:57       never said that about, you know, or if I ever thought that I've never come home after being away and the place has been in shambles because you don't know what to do. So I don't know why, you know, but you keep holding on to some idea of, of something that was talking to them like, man spreading. I gotta be on the fucking couch. Um, no, I don't know what you're so concerned about that for. I like the place has never been disgusting or gross after I have gone away. So I don't know why you have this big hangup about, you know, I don't, I don't get it. You know what? No, I don't either. Well I'm trying to think where you fucking relax and will be worked through my shit. No. Okay. Sorry. What a jerk. You're telling this story and then you're out law.

Speaker 1:          00:06:49       So any don't like, cause I'm told what happened. So I'm fucking wait, I'm on the road on the road again and I'm in fucking Hollywood, Florida right at all. I'm thinking is, aw, the text message I'm going to get. Oh, it looks so great. It's so wonderful to come home to a nice clean house. It looks like a fucking show room. And what do I get? I get a fucking video tape from you. She's in the pantry now. Evidently something went bad in the pantry. Okay. Something didn't go bad in the pantry is just some shit that's going down to the pantry. There's some shit going down to the pantry. So here's the deal. I'm fucking done in the pantry. Um, I'm here by myself. I'm writing on the fucking show every night until seven o'clock at night. I come home, my brain is fried. I come home, I owe to a pizza, I pour a scotch, I eat, and then I stare at the wall.

Speaker 1:          00:07:41       I go to bed and I get right back up and we stare at the next draft in the next script. That's been my life. So I didn't in defense of me. Okay. The one fucking place I didn't go into. So it was a pantry. There was the pantry and stuff saying, hey, I like that word. I just realized Pantry pantry stuff saying I don't like it. Just, it's, I dunno, it's too close to panties in this I don't like good food and sex are combined now. I know you don't like that. You can't treat, oh, that nine and a half weeks when he was fucking her with all the groceries on her, I just was like, either eat or fuck, not together, you know. So anyways. Um, so she sends me this video, she's like, Bebe, how did you not see this? Right. It just starts fucking given me all this shit.

Speaker 1:          00:08:34       I'm like, what the fuck? All right. And she pans up to the top of the fucking ceiling and there was, what was it? There's the larvae. Larvae. Little, yeah, little moths. Modal go. It's an inside joke. Oh, go ahead and side with who? But the fucking people listening to, Oh, and I want to do, no. Yeah, there's sort of larvae. There's mods and stuff. Because some, like if there's flour that's been opened, it's not sealed up properly. Or grains or cereal, they'll create little mobs. Like if you have fruit out for too long, it'll make fruit flies. So that was what was happening. Fruit flies. It attracts them. No, it creates them from that. I was just talking to the Terminex guy about it. They just, they, I don't know what flies come from. Apples listened. Yeah. Like if you have fruit and stuff out to orange, apple, and then fucking nine months later you get a fruit fly.

Speaker 1:          00:09:29       You're like, there's no, there's no woman there that's making an apple. No Bill. That's not what I mean. It's not a fruit having sex. That's what you're saying. You're saying that I'm saying they I pleasant. I don't know. I'm not a fucking terminex person, but he was helping me dirty mobs. Fuck on those apples out in the orchard now. And they plant their seed in there and then it comes out like alien. Okay. There's not any fruit in the pantry. Okay. So we have grains and he's just staring at your crash right now. It's so comfortable that my lower back is so comfortable right now. Oh, you know what? I figured out a thing to get for you for that. But anyway, we'll get back to that. But if you have grains and cereals out exposed and like this little close environment where it gets warm, it produces these larvae and little flies and mobs and shit.

Speaker 1:          00:10:19       So that's what the guy just told me. He's not saying it right. Well how are you saying? Are you saying? I'm saying please like tell me how you explain things and how clear it is when you explain things. What I would say is like, you know if you're having a cookout and you'll leave food out, all of a sudden flies or an ant show up, but they don't come from the food. That's what he told me. I'll be, you keep saying they coming from the apples and it's confusing me. You said it came from apples. I said nothing about it came from Amarillo line this from apples. I would never say it came for you. The start throwing apples into the mix. I was trying to explain to you about grains and shit. I was saying it's like fruit flies in school. I can't even hear what you're saying because you don't listen.

Speaker 1:          00:11:10       That's why you got damn add. You don't listen. You don't listen. And he started saying things and you said them and then you attribute them to the other person. Like it's so confusing to talk to you sometimes because you don't let it. Oh, it's so fucking hard. It is hard. How about we were just watching the Simpsons and you watch the entire episode and midway through it you were like, why is that happening? And I'm like, where did the blue snake, like a major plot point that hadn't been explained not even five minutes earlier, but you don't pay attention. How about this? How about my fucking back is out and I was in Jacksonville, Florida this morning. How about that? What does that have to do with anything that we're talking about? Well, maybe I'm a little fucking, you know, not focusing on a fucking cartoon.

Speaker 1:          00:11:53       Okay. You're going to such a baby when you traveled to it. Whenever you travel, you fucking for like one day like Guma good. I do know how you do this. And then it goes right out your fucking head. And then the next, next time I'm coming back off the road, you like, oh, let's go. Uh, you know Susie Fricker sees having a fucking who hard down the fucking street. You want to go to that when I say no, you flip out at me and I don't know what you're talking about. Shit. Do you know exactly when you know who she is to see the frequency? Oh yeah, he's that bright.

Speaker 1:          00:12:27       All right, so what happened? So she comes home and evidently there's some sort of bug horror movie and you know how, what infestation infestation. And you know how the Lady's react. They don't like insects. You know what I mean? They don't like insects the way men don't like cats hate those fucking things. There's nothing better than a cool cat. I like a cool cat that chills and lays in the fucking sun. You know I liked her. A new Chris. You? Yeah, I don't like that. And when they're practicing killing it, you just look over and they're staring at you from the corner now. Then they stop and try and play it off. I don't like, I don't like that. They stand on your chest in the morning, waking you up. I don't think they shit in a box. And then like you gotta pick it up. It's just too much. It's too much cleo shit. So it just outside. But we still gotta pick it up. I know, but I don't have to, it's not in the house checking on me. If you're going to shit in the house, go in the toilet.

Speaker 1:          00:13:26       I think some people can train their cats to shit in the toilet. I don't know how, but, well, I can tell you how they can't communicate with other human beings. So they put all their energy into yeah, like they, they got like that gift. They have like a, like an Asperger Aspbergers with cat. Some sort of, um, what's that thing they're always talking about nowadays? Autism. Autism. Yeah. Like autistic with people. But communicate with cats. Stop what the like play an instrument stop with no one in his diagnosis of the mental illnesses. It's just dope. Just stop right there please. He's talking about Ben. Are you going to get angry tweets? I'm not mocking, mocking any of that. I'm making fun of people that put, you can't fucking say anything anymore. Everybody gets all worried. Oh, I know. I do benefits for all of those things.

Speaker 1:          00:14:19       All of those things I know about my free fucking all in black. Oh Jesus Christ. Ah, I remember when things were funny. Oh, it was so simple back in the day where it was, you could change things and never a fucking jerk off. Didn't have some way that they could just spout about up fucking annoyed they are, but everything else is fine as long as it doesn't come around to my world. Can I just ask what the situation is here with the Ziploc bag? What about it and how you're keeping your equipment stored? Yeah. Bill's got this cord and the little foamy part that you put on, uh, the wind screen, the windscreen and a couple of batteries and an old Ziploc bag that's ripped and just doesn't even zip anymore. Right. So I'm just wondering why basically, because it, it still holds the things and if I just throw that thing out, another one's going to break and then that thing right there is probably going to end up on the nose of a porpoise and it's not gonna be able to eat.

Speaker 1:          00:15:23       It's going to die because everything ends up in the ocean. Yeah. You know, they say that put litter in its place. It's like the second, all this shit that you throw out the same. You don't pollute. We all pollute. It's just some of us do take this on the road with it. It's not like I was having an idea that good. I mean you, I take it on the role that you're just going to be like a babbling about something that you don't really know about us. I mean, I don't really feel that's the charm of the testing. Anything. Uh, so you take this on the road with you? Yes. All right. Well I was just, I couldn't give you a nice leather Satchel. Really? You got a skin of fucking cow because I already, I already have one no last longer than putting it in this ridiculous thing that's never going to biodegrade.

Speaker 1:          00:16:05       What's this bad thing? And that thing won't biodegrade fat that they will be here somewhere in the dark somewhere hundreds of fucking years after we're gone saying you can have a nice way to carry your things. It doesn't look like you know the bag that we should use for sandwiches. What is your fascination with just like buying shit, but what do you mean fascination with buying ships session? I mean, look at this. Look at this, that you're carrying this thing and I really wish you guys could see the Ziploc bag right now. It's, it's a mess. A man of your stature should not be carrying around your podcast equipment and an oil past zip lock bag. A man of my stature. Fucking two seconds ago I was a fucking moron. You can meet. But now, now cause you

Speaker 1:          00:16:54       to Shay from naenae. So who do you like tonight? Who We got Louis Blues meet me in St Louis. Louis v versus who? The Dallas Stars. Formerly the Minnesota North Stars. Are these hockey teams? Yes they are. If they're not like the kings or the a Bruins, I don't really know. Oh yeah. What are your feelings about the kings and the Bruins? Well, if it came down to it, I would be a Bruins fan because I'm from Boston. So are you just saying, are you gonna root for yeah, but the other, the rest of them, I don't know. Those are my two. What do you like? I like both teams, but I just, I started polling for the blues because the blues have been in the league since 1960. [inaudible] who's getting hook? Cause the Bruins didn't make the playoffs. So I was like, all right, I got to pick somebody and I'm not going to jump on the Black Hawks and kings bandwagon because they're always in it. So I'm going to go for sewer an underdog.

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       And I was like, wow. The Blues, they've been around since 1967 so the Minnesota north stars, but the people in Dallas haven't been rooting that long. But I really liked the players and shit. I like, I like Dallas, but I, I've, I've ever been written for um, a babbling over here looking at it.

Speaker 1:          00:18:04       But yeah, St Louis, they're going to be relaxed. They're going to be a, a kings game that we can go to cause I really enjoy going to that. Those two kings games we went to, they got bounced up. That done. What do you mean bounced out bay? Uh, they got beaten by the San Jose Sharks. Oh, so they're not in it. It's over. So for them, the Stanley Cup playoffs, there you go. They got, they lost in the first round. What about the breweries? We didn't make it. We were all, well then I don't we we overtime,

Speaker 2:          00:18:33       well we over achieved throughout the year because at least as far as I was concerned, but guided we'll do, fuck am I, but I mean with the players that we had and every that we got rid of, I thought we were just gonna be trying to figure out who the fuck everybody was for half the season. And then maybe you know, I dunno. What about the Toronto Blue Jays and what happened was we were going to be making the playoffs and everybody's all bunched together. We look a fucking third seat. Then we'd had a west coast trip and we got to fucking asses kicked and a and all went away and it flyer and red wings fans talk shit about, you know how high you didn't make the playoffs and they both got the right there. Fred in the first fucking round. So I enjoyed that. Okay. Well the Toronto Blue Jays,

Speaker 1:          00:19:12       is that a, is that a hockey team? Nope, that's baseball. Oh, the Toronto Maple leafs. The amount of the maple leafs got the first pick in the draft of the raptors. Are they have a hockey team? Nope. What were they? Basketball team. Oh Jesus keeps, keeps saying this shit. You know. And then I'll do pick you pick something else that I don't know anything about. We'll see who's more. Right. What do you went to that you know about? Did I just say that question? What are you going to, what you know about, I don't know. Fashion. Okay, go ahead. Um, oh Jesus. What's the name of the guy who makes fun of fat people? He used to be fat. Ah.

Speaker 2:          00:19:54       Is that, that's, that's not Alexander Wang, is it? No. Is that Michael Richards? Is it Michael? A Michael Kors?

Speaker 1:          00:20:02       No, he's German. Is it Paul Mitchell. And he is the head of a very, very like the most famous fashion house in the world. It's not for Saatchi cause he got shot by that guy. Yes. No, it's not the Chanel. Cause that was a chick and she's dead right. But she has an apartment in Paris that you can go into if you're skinny enough. Right. But you're, you're close. You're getting that Chanel is right. Chanel's the right fashion house. A person who you're talking about is that the cad creative director for Chanel? He looks like a war criminal, right? He's chairman. I'll say you go and why would they war criminals via cause they lost. You would have just as many people going to fucking Nuremberg really would've. Okay. Dresden, Karl Lagerfeld. Ah Fuck. Remember when we saw him and the last time we were in Paris and the cab and I started freaking out because I had saw Carl was walking down the street in Paris and I thought it was a cool looking dude, man.

Speaker 1:          00:21:08       He's a vampire, a vampire war criminal, old queen looking dude. Pretty much. That's him. Name a sports team. Go ahead. Um, I'll name one of you. Tell me what it is. They are the yellow jackets somebody or did I make that up? Yellow check. I feel like that was a high school. I feel like that was a fucking fusion band. Um, what about no, it wasn't his, that's like wake forest or something. That's a college basketball team. Some sort of jackets. The Grizzlies Grizzlies to right now Michigan, it's some place cold that would have grizzly bears. Right. So it's not going to be a southern union. Good guests. But they moved. They were initially, they were initially in very cool. Oh, okay. Is there a Midwestern kind of thing? They were initially in Vancouver and then they went to another and Memphis. Oh, that said the Memphis Grizzlies for some dumb reason, they kept the name kind of like when the New Orleans jazz moved to Utah. The widest fucking place ever. Like you'll never see any jazz or hear any jazz in Utah? I wouldn't think so.

Speaker 1:          00:22:19       They are no jazz clubs and Utah. It's like the New Orleans Mormons, New Orleans Mormon. I like that name better. All right, well we enjoyed you hear neo. Oh, I'm done. I don't know. Your phone's ringing. Oh God. Oh look at us. I know. I get a call her back. Um, are you down with me? Are you wrapping up the podcast? Did you answer questions? No, but you can come back to that. She kind of tired. So I think I'm going to leave Oh, down. Nice reversal. I kicked you off and then you're like, no, let me come back. And then you tell me to go fuck myself. You know what? I enjoy that. I respect that. So I just came on. It's how the larvae, larvae, larvae and then, and get out of here so I could straighten out my legs and fucking get my, I feel like Kennedy, right.

Speaker 1:          00:23:12       Are you even able to do a podcast and the upright position anymore? Um, this is why I married you because it's the type of compassion that I've come to expect from you. You're such a fucking baby. I, I tough my way through all of this shit. I never, I never see doctors. I don't take medicine. That's cause you're dumb. You're dumb. Well, it's because I grew up so people don't go to the hospital. They don't go to doctors. They will take medicine. No, you're dumb. We have advances in our society. I am dumb, but I'm tougher than you. You're a baby. So fine. Be tough all you want but like be smart and tough goal to the doctor if you're so tough. Go to the doctor and hear what they have to say. Like after school special. Yeah, I, well I'm getting there beats up by going to the doctor and hearing what they have to say. That's real toughness. That's real talk. That's real socks on. All right. I'm out of here. Nini out.

Speaker 1:          00:24:09       Sorry. I had to uh, I enjoyed when you come out. I miss you baby. Huh? All right, good. Don't say, Huh? You heard me listen, I went out. You know, you know why you don't go to fucking doctors and all that shit. Why? Because doctors, they practice medicine. They practice on you. They don't have shit down. And one of the, one of the things that they still don't know a lot about this, but it's not like they don't mean it like they're practicing. Like you sit in here practicing drums, you know, that's not the same thing they went to medical school. I understand that. So why are you like taking that word? So literally, have you ever seen Lars Ulrich play life and he practices, he fucks up all the time with Metallica. Oh my God, Nia. I'm telling you if that's what it means, you practice medicine and then you learn off other people.

Speaker 1:          00:24:55       Just look how much better hair plugs of God. Look how much better they are getting with the fucking, you know, cut and part of your eye out and then he can see better. You told me you were going to go to a doctor to figure out what was happening with your leg. Okay. So I know, I know you think you know what it is, but can you please go to a doctor and so it doesn't become a chronic issue. And then when you're, you know, 50 which is, can I, can I finish it far away? Can I finish?

Speaker 1:          00:25:24       You can have some sort of handle on it. Yeah. One of the things that they know the least about is the back. Okay. And I'm just, I'm just not going to just go to a fucking chiropractor. I'm going to find somebody you know who has a good reputation of not just fucking opening people up like a fun. It isn't fine cause I wasn't done talking. You always jump in because you're suggesting that I just want you to go to some random ass clinic. I was just joking around. I was joking around. I'm holding you to this because you said you were going to do it. So are you going to do it? Um, I don't know. I'm feeling pretty good. I don't like going at this. I don't like going to the doctor that way. I don't like one to the fucking mall. I just, the whole idea of going over there and parking and just the whole fucking thing.

Speaker 1:          00:26:09       I know. I need feel the shower. Make sure you show up 15 minutes before. Oh yeah. Y'All be there. See that? I know. But once it's done, it's done. And you need all my first show in Hollywood, Florida. There was a couple of ladies in the front row. Uh, we're asking if you were there because they needed relationship advice. Oh yeah. You know, so they were like, how come we don't have boyfriends? No, they didn't say this. That's what they said. Someone actually wrote me and asked me about you proposing and actually that's what I wanted to do. I wanted to talk about this email I got, should we do it today or should we do it day to fuck his writing you on? How the fuck are they writing you? Because they write Mike because of my website tender headed films.com.

Speaker 1:          00:26:56       So they were writing me because remember I was going to do a podcast all those years ago and then they just never did it. No, they wrote this whole thing about how did you get a guy who was so anti marriage to propose and all that kind of stuff and how did it happen and did I propose? No, I did not propose. But he'll propose to me. Uh, and all that stuff. It was interesting. I did, excuse me. No, no. See this is why we have to talk about it. Cause that's some bullshit. Oh wait, even put that out there.

And what was hilarious was he was driving a Prius and the way he was driving this thing, I would be surprised if he was getting an eight count, eight miles per gallon. He just kept doing that. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:35:08       Eh,

Speaker 2:          00:35:12       just stomp and glide. Um, I can, I just amazing to me some people like how they cannot hear, you can't hear the engine, you know, he can't hear the fucking rpms going through the roof. You don't understand that as wasting fuel. I don't, you know how bad those cabbies get fucked over. You think that he would be concerned about something and you think if you drove for a fucking living, you'd have an understanding of how fucking works. Um, it was so fucking annoying. It actually, it just Kinda just became funny and he was a really nice guy. But, um, I don't know. Some people like it's almost like, it's like they're driving with a fake foot, you know, or a mechanical foot like the prototype and then, you know, it's either on or off. There's no, um, consistency of speed. This guy, he just kept going up to like 65, 70 miles an hour and then glide back down to like, you know, 52. Of course I'm looking at my fucking phone, some starting to get six. Yeah. You know, it was, it was a shit show, an absolute fucking shit show or, you know, when I went to Florida, by the way, I landed in Miami every time I land into my Miami, oh you immediately start seeing all these beautiful women and every time I go there I just hear Tony Montana voice going. The city is like one big pussy waiting to get fucked.

Speaker 5:          00:36:31       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:36:33       And I was trying to bait me into those two women that was sitting in the front row to get into that fucking conversation.

Speaker 5:          00:36:39       Um, but she didn't buy the bait. She didn't take the bait

Speaker 2:          00:36:44       cause they were like, why don't we have boyfriends? You know when you should have seen him cause I dunno cause you guys are, you're not wearing any clothes that be, the one thing is beautiful as you are. No guy wants to put up with that. You got to walk down the street like some overprotective dog. I am keeping everybody away. Everybody's, we, one of them was barely wearing a shirt. Granted I wasn't complaining for where I was standing front, but I mean it just seemed kind of obvious. You know what I mean? You got it. You've got to cover up the goods a little bit.

Speaker 2:          00:37:21       I mean I would say that to Madonna. I don't know if she's currently dating somebody right now, but Mcdonald's and fucking unbelievable shape for her age and if she would just put on something elegant, you know what I mean? Still a rolling around with half a fucking pussy lip hanging out. I don't know why she does that. She said something late, you know, as she did yet another thicker, all fucking career's been like one big publicity stunt after another. You know, I'm wearing a wedding dress, but I'm fingering myself at the fucking award show. Right. You know, right from there. And then, oh, it's Jesus, but he's African American and now I'm trying to fuck them. It's just paint by numbers. Shock. And what's funny is I actually liked her music.

Speaker 2:          00:38:05       I just keep, you know, that's actually how I threw out my back doing that Molly Ringwald dance. Um, anyways, yeah. And then she goes on Letterman. She says, fuck 50,000 times. She does stand up on the tonight show was just one big fucking thing after another. So our latest one was, she showed up to a movie theater and I moved, Oh, movie premiere, whatever the Fuck Shit. I don't know who the fuck knows what it was, you know, some fundraiser to get toothbrushes to some fucking God's forsaken place. So she shows and she literally has her teddies and harass out like a see through dress. And she of course says, well, what I'm doing is I'm challenging the boundaries and um, you know, of course women, you know, you've got to drag all that bullshit. And then it's like, no, you're 57 okay. Nobody wants to look at that. Okay. Like it my h I. M I am willing to put on a fucking sport. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:39:00       Coat

Speaker 2:          00:39:03       what he wants to see it. It's just a, yeah, you're not pushing any boundaries. It's just, it's a a, you know, you have it. A little bit of a midlife prices. I think she looks fucking great, but she'd look way better if she fucking just, you know, you don't put on sprout a fucking dress. Fucky I've, I dunno. But then again, I saw Iggy pop and he wasn't wearing a shirt, but I don't find guys aren't like attractive. It was just sort of funny to me. Not Funny. I just was just him not giving a fuck. So I guess if she just said, look, I don't give a fuck. I just fell a cabin my ass and titties hanging out. I wouldn't have a problem with that. But put the fact that she's sitting there trying to say that, no, no. Wait a minute. I think she might be right. Maybe she is right. Hey, come here. You got to answer this question. There's a chance I might be common life and understand the dawn of war until she comes here. I'll sing a sing some of my favorite songs by her. A bad boy. Bad girl home by six, eight. Pick up the mic. I got a question for you

Speaker 1:          00:40:21       now. You want me back?

Speaker 2:          00:40:23       Yup. That's like that street joke I told you. Right. Watch when I heard Jackie the joke, man, tell

Speaker 1:          00:40:30       the one about the gorilla. No, the one with the fucking cause I liked that one. The married guys walking out of the house and his wife's yelling at him, don't get the fuck outta here. Get the fuck out. I never want to see you again. So he's walking away and she goes, I hope he had died a long, slow, miserable death. And he turns around. He goes, oh, what now you want me back? That's stupid. That's a stupid joke. Just reminded me of that. Anyway, school, I could have told it better, but I got to, I just got off plink Jackie junk man tells a way better. Um, all right, so McDonogh recently borderline,

Speaker 2:          00:41:07       um, she showed up at some fucking, you know, raise awareness thing. I don't know what it was. It was a carpet she showed up and she had a butt cheeks out in a titties out. Okay. This was the met ball that happens every year in New York City. And that's for the mets.

Speaker 1:          00:41:24       Yes, it is. Go math, but it's just for wonderful. I know. It's for the fucking museum. Yes. The hacky date. Every person

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       in that twenties goes on in New York and Madonna, let's go to a museum. Um, it's a big gala and made the Creme de Creme Darling. I invaded. So Ralph Lauren pretends to fall. He sniffs or butter and the way down. So what happens? Well, you know, this super rich people, they're all freaks. They wasn't at the point of eyes wide shut. I don't know what the point of eyes wide shut was. What happened was Stanley Kubrick died. He died halfway through. I saw a great fucking movie on a plane called the insiders. It's a movie made by, uh, some Korean director. Man. It was fucking phenomenal. Really enjoyed it. Okay. Had One of the best fucking fight scenes that I, I've seen, cause the guy was missing her head, you know, so he had to like fucking, you know, everybody knew one handy was throwing right. And it was multiple attackers. It was the shit.

Speaker 2:          00:42:31       I almost gave it a standing ovation on the plane. If it was pre nine 11 I could have done it. But I started to do and they're like, sorry I had to sit down and okay, it's another freedom lost. So anyways, so fucking, but Donna shows up. Yes. Okay. So she says that she's trying to fucking push the boundaries of whatever the fucking sex and that type of thing. Yeah. Okay. So I was going like, no, c'mon, you're 57 no wants to see me without a shirt on grants. She's in better shape than I, but like, you know, Almond must my sport coat year, like, you know, covered up their freckles. Right. So what I'm saying is you're in your sport coat you yeah, yeah, yeah. You get to a certain point, you get to your forties and stuff like that. Women Dress elegantly. And men dress like gentlemen. Yeah. In other words, yeah. You cover up, uh, you know the fucking battle scars of what you've been through can too. When he fucking wine and cheese plates.

Speaker 2:          00:43:35       No, what I'm saying is, so I was saying with Mark Madonna, just put on a nice dress. You could look really elegant. Right. That's not really her vibe. Yeah, I know. I know. But you know something. It's like you look even, who's kidding who? Michael Jackson, he, if he was still alive, the short pants with the glitter socks. It's like, come on dude. Some point you've got to update the look. What is it? What is your point? Let this hall and Madonna thing. So I was, I was saying that, but then I was like, wait a minute. But when I saw Iggy pop with no shirt on, I thought it was bad ass that daddy didn't give a fuck site. That's, that's bullshit. So I should be actually applauding Madonna. Wow. Look at you. See that? That's not, that's not okay. I was going to say, you're going like, wow, look at you. You're really not as dumb. So my apologies to Madonna fee is like, I'm sure take it. Look at my fucking 57 year old

Speaker 1:          00:44:31       kid tds teas. She's my age with tense. She's 10 years, we're 10 years apart. So she's 50 wait, what? Madonna? 57 years. Wait is she, is she was born in the same area as prince? Oh Shit. Oh, same year as Michael Jackson. Michael Jackson was 58 prince was 58 and take, but Donna was 58 I never know how old Madonna is ever. And that was like in 1957 Oh my God, you're right. She's going to be 58 right? Had no idea. And August, yeah, she'll be 58 so 1958 as far as music goes was kind of like 1943

Speaker 2:          00:45:12       1943 was Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix and Jim Morrison all born 1943 and then they all died in 1970 and then people started to understand drugs and you know, bringing a jump rope on the road and maybe becoming a Vegan. So now that they live longer and Michael made it to 50 prints, made it to 57 but don is still going okay. Right. So all of them in their own way kind of went on stage with their ass hanging out. Right. Um, okay.

Speaker 1:          00:45:53       Are you going to fill up an hour? I gotta fuck it. I want to do some questions here. Okay. Say you brought me into, show me that you've evolved and seeing your own. Oh, I was trying, I was trying to see if that was a double standard women and showing their bodies and you know, double standard also works with women the way they look at guys in certain situation to what you guys aren't like perfect. No one, no one is claiming to be perfect to media just seems to

Speaker 2:          00:46:19       cover your complaints.

Speaker 1:          00:46:22       And then this just told you ever have a voice. Thank God you have this podcast.

Speaker 2:          00:46:28       I know. No one would hear me. Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:46:32       listen, you got to understand the world doesn't live with me. They don't have the privilege of living with me the way you do. So I need to do this once a week. That's a fucking beautiful watch. Who got you that? You did? That's right. Asshole response to stinky German from last week. So this poor bastard,

Speaker 2:          00:46:55       he's German, right? Yes. And uh, so he lives in Germany. He's old school. He didn't leave and try to be like, hey, I wasn't part of that Hitler thing. Right. He still has his grandparents said, you know, I don't know if it's me, but this guy's making a lot of sense.

Speaker 1:          00:47:14       So,

Speaker 2:          00:47:18       so because of the mistakes for fathers and mothers, the gods have cursed him that he just sort of smells a little musty and he's cheese tries showering, it has all this shit. He doesn't know what the fuck to do. So evidently this, this and this other musty guy, formerly musty guy heard about this. Okay. Does he look into his diet? Yeah, we do. We talked about that and how it ptosis and maybe have a fucking as a sinus infection. I don't know what, but he just, he just smells bad. Yeah. No matter how matter how much he shower. So this guy says, yeah, he wears deodorant. Yeah. It was quite, it's quite a mystery.

Speaker 6:          00:48:00       Boy, I tell you that,

Speaker 2:          00:48:02       Whoa, this person is in response to this. This is a formerly musty person, so I hope this helps the, uh, the Sauerkraut.

Speaker 6:          00:48:10       Oh, Jesus. That is my best fucking fun ever. I'm sorry.

Speaker 2:          00:48:23       Shit was great. All that was pretty good. That was bad. Was good. That was good. That was good. All right. I'm gonna. I'm gonna. He said, I'm gonna and keep this simple because we all know of you're reading issues would, I admittedly have, I've been a fan for years, but this is the first time I feel the need to chime in on something. Last week you read a question from a German guy that had a musty body odor and did not know what to do about it. He said, growing up, I dealt with the same bullshit that poor SAP is going through. I always smelled musty. I could not wash it away, no matter how often I showered. This is brutal. I feel bad for these people. I tried everything and finally realized it was, it was antiperspirant for some weird reason. My Body reacted when I put it on and I smelled musty.

Speaker 2:          00:49:14       I actually stopped wearing deodorant for a few weeks in the winter, so I did not smell like a complete savage. After that period of time, I began wearing deodorant only skipping all brands with anti person. Uh, happily the stinky, musty odor went away. Hope this works. You Stinky Fuck, love the podcast. Your comedy and F is for family and go fuck yourself. Yeah, so basically what I got from that is maybe his body is having a reaction to something that he is using. I don't know. Cause your body should sweat. It's the way to keep you cool. Right. That's the whole point of sweating. So antiperspirant, I know maybe people who sweat excessively, they don't want to be sweating through their clothes or something. So I don't know. But it sounds like that person to go to a doctor. Well they haven't been able to figure out what's going on and he's in Germany too and those guys don't fuck around over there.

Speaker 2:          00:50:06       They're very efficient. Yeah. No cars. The trades, the rocket side trick, you know, everybody could just forgive him for that one crazy 10 year period. I think they got a little sideways. They'll never, they'll never live it down. No, you can't. Sorry. You know what? It's on video. That's quite, you know, other countries could do shit. And it happened before like a certain, something that happened in 1915 that we always see advertised. Uh, my vote dear bill on Capitol Hill and I know what you're talking about. Well you should, you know what if there was movie cameras around you with movie cameras? Yup. Motion picture things. Have you ever heard of vermin supreme? Um, he's been on, I, I don't, I don't believe that this is somebody whose name I'm going to look this up before you guys make a fool of me, which is not hard to do. Why don't you read it first? Because then I start commenting and then halfway through I realize it's a prank phone call. Vermin supreme. It's coming up. Vermin Supreme Vermin supreme as an American performance. Ardor artists and activists who has run as a candidate and very low various local states.

Speaker 2:          00:51:22       Um, okay, let me see what this, what's up with this guy? Okay. I never heard of this guy. He's been on the ballot in New Hampshire and his platform has a lot to do with dental health. He also has a plan in place for the Zombie Apocalypse, which involves setting up thousands of treadmills to put the zombies on to help power the new world. He wears a giant boot on his head. Oh, I've seen this fucking guy. That boot that's right, and carries around a rubber toothbrush. Here's an article on him. He also has promised free ponies for everyone. Oh, so he's a whack job. I don't know if he's a whack job because that's a really funny joke though. The zombies on the treadmill. Are you looking them up? Are you texting? I was looking at Madonna photos. Okay. We were back here and we've now, we moved on. We've moved on, but I had just was still looking at photos. I'm here. Don't preach. I mean trouble. Dino happened, Dope Madonna songs.

Speaker 2:          00:52:27       I just said, I'm sorry. I did my fucking, I did see your, your, your, your vocal warmups. Yeah. This was not a good luck at the met ball. It was just I, yeah. Oh ladies, can we stick together? First of all, it's got something. I'm right at home, but now it's not. I'm not being catty. She just, it's just so thirsty. It's just, I don't, and I love Madonna, but this is just too much. I get done. Yeah, I'm done. Sure. I'm sure her kids enjoy, uh, wife's family is a bunch of dramatic babies. Oh God. You're the baby. And we go, hey bill, I'm sick of this election. I hope Trump wins. I know he's a jerk, but I hate Hillary. I think Bernie is a nice guy without a clue. He says a lot of great things, but he's going to raise taxes.

Speaker 2:          00:53:25       He talks about making college free, but his taxes, we'll make it hard. Nothing is free. Yeah, that's never going to happen. But I think that, you know, free health care, it's not, this is not free. Somebody has got to fucking pay for it. He talks about making college free, but it's taxes will make it harder for people like me to pay my student loans. I make 95 grand a year. I have a kid, a hundred grand in student loans between me and my wife, we live comfortably. But if you take another 20 $504,000 from him a year, I will feel it. Yeah, definitely. I am already only netting 60. What is the fuck is all of this? What's the point? The family has adventure. Dramatic babies.

Speaker 5:          00:54:03       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:54:03       All right. Blah, blah, blah, blah.

Speaker 5:          00:54:06       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:54:10       Okay. So we're getting to, we're getting to a family here somewhere. Okay. I'm not opposed to giving money to help people who need it, but when is enough? Enough, $1 trillion on dumb shit every year. And you need more from me. Fuck off Bernie. I love how he's blaming Bernie. You know, if Bernie didn't create the fucking situation, um, he's trying to get us out of it. I guess. I don't know if it's going to work. I don't think, I mean, I don't know if people will work with the guy, but oh God, what a fucking decision this year. Um, so I make this point to my wife, my wife's family. I didn't yell. I didn't say fuck off Bernie. I just said, I don't think we, the people should have to give more money if they're wasting the money they already get. Well, my wife's family lost their shit.

Speaker 2:          00:54:55       They said that I'm selfish and that if I vote for Trump, I'm endorsing hate and greed and fascism, a really question mark. They endorsed Obama and I have a problem with him. Hatefully blowing up kids and wedding parties with drones. Why doesn't that make them hateful? Uh, they then went on to talk about for 30 minutes about hate and how theirs, they were scared about what would happen to the country and they're scared about how children would grow up in a country with, and I quote Hitler minus the concentration camps. I told him that comparing an Egomaniac to Hitler is unfair to the victims of the Holocaust. It trivializes the actual evil of Hitler. Hitler embodied her mother and father were both taken it back and said that my way of thinking could potentially be dangerous to their grandchildren. What period the fuck period is going, period on period. Well, you're dope.

Speaker 1:          00:55:53       Yeah. You fucking opened up your fucking mouth of Bob's politics. No, he isn't. He's young. He doesn't know. Well, what's now, you know, how did you learn? How did you learn and how did I learn by bringing it out? By doing that? Yeah. This is the deal. Yeah. You know, you can't talk, talk

Speaker 2:          00:56:09       about politics and religion and shit like that. Those are going to say it got, it got really heated right before they said that shit. Well, you can't, and also he just, he can't, I don't know. He got to, if you really

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       are going to vote for Trump, I just, I think there's only certain sections of the United States where you could say that where you'll get a, yeah, I get it. Oh, well tell me more about your opinion. I feel like if you say, you know what, fuck this, I'm voting for Trump, most people are going to be like, are you fucking kidding me? So I'm not surprised at that, but no. Yeah, you really, a lot of shit. And I was, I made fun of him when, uh, you know, I got some shit for it. For making fun of Trump. Yeah. From whole people who support Trump. Oh, well, okay, fine. Yeah, they have, believe it or not, this people that she has a lot more than I thought. Remember when, when he was first talking about running and we're both like, this is never going to happen. This is a joke.

Speaker 1:          00:57:05       This is ridiculous. And now here we are and he's like the only Republican left standing. So I mean, I guess I underestimated him and he's like the last home party. He's like the Leicester City of Pollock politicians. But here's the thing, I family. But I think like, you know, Hillary Clinton is the fucking devil because she's acting like she gives a fuck and she's, you know, she's one of those Bilderberg people. I don't like her. I like Bernie out of all of them. I liked Bernie Sanders. I just don't think anybody's going to fucking work with, well, the California primary is coming up, so he's, he's not thrown in the towel with Ernie, but we got to Ireland. I am. I have to vote for a person that I feel is actually truly gives a shit about regular people and that would be him. Whether he's going to be successful or not.

Speaker 1:          00:57:56       And I know what a lot of people, wholesaler, you're going to put Trump good old office. I've always voted for the fucking third wheel. Every fucking God damn time. Well, when the primary happens, we got to vote for him. That's the only way that he'll listen. I don't have to do anything that you say. Okay. But uh, I don't know what I'm going to do. So basically his, this guy's in law, you know, we just did. We just did. We just did with this guy did, which is what we just fucking talked politics and it gave endorsements to Bernie said, we shouldn't have done that. I still haven't made up my mind that I'm going to do that. Why are we were giving endorsements just by talking about it, by saying that you're going to do it. Well, that's how I feel like that guy, that fuck, we're like those, those people that you see on Facebook and they go, Hey, do you know me?

Speaker 1:          00:58:39       I pretend to be a doctor on his soap opera and I think this is who you should vote for. I apologize for that people. I, I, I tried not to say that eventually she was going to come up doors seeing anybody weird. Well, let's just leave it. I'll tell you what. I'm endorsing a nice fucking cold Budweiser. When I sit down to watch game five doors, what is, what does he want to know? He is just sort of like, what the hell? Now My, now my inlaws don't want me to have children with my wife because they think I'm evil and they're going to, I'm going to raise a little evil. Trump's might think about Trump is his fucking lack of compassion for fucking people. When you sit there and say take his coat and like riling people up like that was just says that he says really awful things, but the thing I like about him is he lets me know that they actually count the votes because no super rich people want that fucking guy.

Speaker 1:          00:59:29       And I always thought for years my conspiracy theory is like, they don't count these fucking things. They do. Oh, it's pretty fucking close. And they put the money on both horses and then, then the fucking fine. But uh, the fact that he's actually doing well, he's speaking a lot of people out there needing, it's going to build a wall. He's going to have the people he's walling and pay for it, felony these talking mad shit. And now I feel like I, all those years of watching the apprentice and the celebrity apprentice are now coming back to when you tried to find a CEO for a company that doesn't exist. It's all coming back to bite me in the ass. I've been supporting him this whole entire time.

Speaker 1:          01:00:06       I'm partly to blame for this boss Shit. So what does this look? He can't be a complete moron. What does this kid saying? What does this point? He's just is, no, he's just saying what the fuck. So we just will not talk about politics anymore around your inlaws, Huh? Tell you that much. But then he said, looking forward to seeing you in Dublin, myself and some friends that will be coming from Belfast. Well, I'm going to be doing Belfast too, so you don't even, yeah, you don't even need to do that. Yeah. I were putting together the dates, so I'm definitely doing Dublin. Definitely doing Belfast. I'm doing a little 10 day tour over there, cause skin. It's not a good time to go to Scandinavia this time of year because they actually have sunlight and it's warm out, so when I usually, well, because they're going to want to be outside.

Speaker 1:          01:00:52       Okay. Yeah. Yeah. If you go in December and it's already fucking dark and go to movies and stuff, still though, I would imagine just cause it's sunlight most of the time doesn't mean why would I listen to the promoters over there? I'll listen to it. All right. When is this happening? I'm going to go. That's going to be happening and to Jill like I think it's going to start on the 31st and it's going to go into August. Very excited about that. Exciting things are happening. I love Ireland. I know. I love the people in Ireland. Look who you're with. Oh, potato face himself here and vice with neighbors emotionally. German, all mighty Billy. I don't, I actually don't even know that cause I never done the whole La [inaudible] is like a more German than Irish cause I am Jeremiah Irish Catholic podcasts. It doesn't get any wider. Doesn't get it. Doesn't get any wider, right. All mighty Billy Ball bag. Ah, all right. And vice with neighbors. Question. I live in an apartment complex here in the lovely state of Oklahoma and I have this neighbor who lets her dog out on her balcony every morning. Somewhere between the hours of four and 5:00 AM oof. The dog barks aggressively for hours afterward. Of course it wakes me up. Poor thing. The dog that is and this about this poor bastard or lady Oklahoma in Oklahoma and Oklahoma in

Speaker 1:          01:02:22       am Oklahoma. Oh sexual. No. Isn't that one of the characters on your Nashville show? I want to write a song with you. Lax about us. They gay cowboy, the gay cowboys to gay cowboys. Cutting edge character. That's the first gay cowboy ever in primetime in Bram time. Yes. Prime time during the lunch hour. It was just littered with them when I was growing up. Those people on Captain Kangaroo, right? Ernie and Bert isn't what they said. All those guys. Right. All right, question. I live in an apartment complex here in the lovely state of Oklahoma. Okay. Yeah. The dog barks aggressively for hours. It wakes me up and I have to go. I have to work at 8:00 AM I filed complaints after an altercation in which I went out and scream, shut your fucking dog up before I make you shut him up now. Was that your opening line now or something along those lines? My mess. My message has not been heard by the apartment cons and she continues to let the dog out. What should I do? Sincerely, a blue collar working man, just trying to get some fucking sleep. Who's the soup? Also? Saint Louis Blues gave the stars of fucking Molly whopping today. Hope you watched it. I missed that. Um, well fuck gear and you're in Oklahoma, man. You know what she need to do? Take out your side iron. Hey, hey, hey, hey, eh, take the fucking dog outs. The bill plow.

Speaker 1:          01:03:57       Don't even joke about it with rubber bullets. Don't even check about that. Who is your super? No, he put rubber bullets in the gun and every time the dog barks, I resigned. The dog barks. You shoot it and its ass and it starts, oh, when I bark and then I'll shut up. Now you can't do that. Uh, you would get arrested for that. So why don't I would just go down. I would buy a month's worth a cube. Steaks. All right. Why does it, does the dog shit and Piss on the balcony? Is that why she's letting it out there? Cause that's gross. I don't know. But that is so fucking not acceptable because you know it's probably the fucking dog gets up at four at 5:00 AM it's keeping her up or him up. So they, oh my God. No, it's you gotta you gotta call them on or something. I'll wait. Did he say that they're not paying attention at the,

Speaker 1:          01:04:46       like we say it's not going over well with the people in the apartment? Well he has like, she just has a neighbor. I can't, I don't think I was, it's an apartment complex. Yeah. You got to say something to the management company. Oh look, there's no fucking way. He's the only person that's ignored by this. Of course I would go around and I would get a bunch of signatures and then I would, you know, try to have everybody all get together and say, uh, that bitch needs to shut the other bitch. Oh, oh, oh no. What's up buddy?

Speaker 3:          01:05:20       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:05:21       Yeah. This will be like, it's time for this one probably to go out. Speaking of all that. All right, well you do that. Well, I will wrap up the podcast here. No, you take it around. I took my survey. It was a Jacksonville this morning. That's my, uh, that's my excuse. All right, well that's going to be the, uh, the lay down. Wait, so we didn't offer any advice besides, you're a horrible joking advice. Of course. I just said, dude, get a bunch of signatures. You can get enough signatures is not going to do shit. You got to go to the management company and be like, this dog is barking at four or five in the morning every morning. Oh, he said he already did that. Oh, a narrow. Not Paying attention. You said he's in this fucking, what do you think signatures are going to do? A technology like to hear about? Oh no, that's not it. Oh wait, I missed one.

Speaker 3:          01:06:07       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:06:07       He said, I have this name. I live in an apartment complex. The dog barks. I've, I filed complaints. Yeah. Like nothing's happening that sacks. Wow, you have to do this thing. I'm not going to pay my fucking rent. There you go. I'm not paying my rent until you get this woman to shut this damn dog. Oh yeah. Cause that's not fair. Yeah, she's lived there. That sounds like something an older person would do to just like put their dog out on the balcony and just let it bark all morning because it probably goes out, takes a piss, takes a shit, and then wants to come inside and meanwhile the owner has gone back to sleep. All right, well obviously I was joking. You don't shoot what the doc? No, you don't. That's right. Clear. Here's the other one. Um, all right. Virtual reality headset. Blow job. Uh, all right. I know you hate technology, but we'd like to hear your opinion on this. My girlfriend, half jokingly promised me a double blow job from my 30th birthday.

Speaker 3:          01:07:13       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:07:14       Um, I do not expect this to happen, but I have been joking with her that the date is approaching and she should have a girl lined up, et cetera. I have also been talking about virtual reality slash Vr headset. As I'm thinking of getting one, I don't know what that is. Yeah. What is that? She asked me the other day, would I be able to watch porn through it? I said yes. She then said instead of the double by, why don't you wear the headset and I can give you normal. Oh, by while watching a porno. What? What are you saying? Bye. Oh, Bj. Yeah. Oh, you know what? It was underlined in red, so I couldn't see the bottom of products. Like why does this by, Oh my God, you're really, skills are atrocious. Yeah. And by would actually mean that there wouldn't be a guy and a girl doing it. I wasn't even, I was thinking about like his girlfriend would be like by, because she was down there with another chick.

Speaker 1:          01:08:18       I am stupid. See this people, Youtube could be successful in life. You're dumb as me. She then she then instead of instead of a double Bj me read this again. Wow. Why don't you wear a headset and I could give you a normal BJ while watching a porno. Why can't you do that now with a TV? Because I feel like when they, I'm like weird tron futuristic shit. When you put it on this opening Pandora's box or is this a way for Vr to be seen as a techie sex toy? You are really asking the wrong person that question. You know, Bill doesn't know. We're looking forward to see you in Dublin. Myself and some friends will be coming from belts. Oh this is the I, that was the one. Okay. Um, is this the same? I read the ending to the other one to that one and it was weird because the ending was in front of the other one.

Speaker 1:          01:09:13       Oh fuck you and fuck everybody else. Yeah. Big. It's all funny. It's all fun and games. Until I stopped podcasting. Ah, Oh, I've had enough of this sensitive. Uh, no I'm not, I don't care. Um, it is a slippery slope, but I feel like that could be really kind of cool. Does she get to do it too? Like does she get to watch some porn? Why you like go down on her? That'd be really trippy. It would be trippy. But the thing is then, then what ends up happening is, is then you end up getting like a that that disconnect. Right. And now you don't want to do anything. That's the one of you is wearing the helmet. Yeah. It's weird. I'm like, God, I have to like see you. So that's all good. It's a dangerous, yeah. That's like one of those things like do you think I could do however one once and like be all right with that now I saw something, I'm trying to think where I saw it.

Speaker 1:          01:10:07       Saw what in one of those Asian countries, because they're always ahead of us. They have better cell phones. There was a, uh, a guy trying out like a virtual reality sex suit, which I had a bit on this thing in like the uh, late nineties when I first heard that they were going to do that. And by the way, the fact that you haven't already called me outgoing, like bulk bill, how did you just stumble upon this? I'm dead honest. What? I don't remember for the rest of the story cause I felt like there was more, it could have been while I was watching Internet porn probably. Yeah. But they don't have advertising advertisers for that. It was like a story on the side of the thing. They have all those and how do you know that? Yeah, right back at you. So yeah, but they don't have any, don't have ads like that. Right. That's true. Well, this is what it was. It looked like a fucking dude. He was like, let a mummy suit who's hilarious. He was all wrapped up in toilet paper, but that's how I remember it because it was so horrifying. It was just, it was one of those things, whatever I was looking at that came up and I went, wow. Right. And it looked like

Speaker 5:          01:11:19       mmm.

Speaker 1:          01:11:21       His hands went to his side. He had on the fucking, you know, I'm old and I can't see anymore. Those glasses, those cataract glad cataract glasses from the drugstore. Yeah, so he had on those, I think it was all wrapped up because he didn't want anybody to see who he was. Maybe that's what it was. And then there was this thing, obviously his dick was in it. Oh my God. And it just, the same way your hand would be going like bang, Bang, Bang, Bang against yourself. It was this thing. It was the most fucked up thing ever. Would you ever use one of those flash bought things. You know how porn stars they get home old are so fucking gross. I think those things, those things are so fucking gross. A long time ago I did somebody podcast. I'm not gonna say who, but people who listen to podcasts, no.

Speaker 1:          01:12:07       Who is, he had one of those things and it looks like some Jeffrey Dahmer body part. No automatically who you're talking just sitting. I don't think you'd do. Oh okay. Cause I know who you're going to guess. But it wasn't that person. Um, it looked, no, it just looked like and it, did he say that it, did it feel like a re it can't feel like a real vagina obviously, but like it, if it's just, it's, I, I can't believe that it does. Like shit like that doesn't cause you to either be like become like a necrophiliac or some sort of perk. Why would it make you feel necrophilia cause you're fucking something that looks, looks like a body part and it's not alive. Women have like dildos and vibrators and stuff and it's like the same sensation. So why wouldn't a one of those fleshed bought things feel like, isn't that kind of, it's just like another Madonna Iggy pop thing by looking at it the wrong way maybe?

Speaker 1:          01:13:02       No, I don't think. No, I don't think you're looking at it. I remember back in the days, back in the day, don't like the idea of a fake vagina. You don't, you're not comfortable just sitting on a table and it has a handle on it and I'm holding it. No, that's not your thing. You're not into that feels like Henry portrait of a serial killer. I remember back in the day, right when you actually had to go to a porno store to get your porn and they had like, you know, always, always behind the counter and they would have shut up there.

Speaker 1:          01:13:37       It was like what's in the box? It was literally a head in a box and the chicks buck was like, all right, like you stick your Dick in it. You know like somebody is going to buy that. Yeah. It was in like the same box, like a basketball came in and grab it by its fucking ears that are stuck to the side of its head and they're just going to go home and fuck ahead just to head now. There's no fucking way that that doesn't fuck you up. Psychologically. If you do that long enough, then you go out with a real person. It's already annoying that they have to buy it dinner and that this is a whole body attached to it and you have to talk to it. Yeah, and they all, they're thinking of just grabbing you by your ears. Water, water, water. It's over. Yeah, it's fucked up. Well, I still feel like we're going back to the question. I feel like they can experiment with it like once or twice, but it can't be like a regular thing that they're doing all the time because then that'll completely fuck up your sex life because then you'll just be looking at everything you do. Like it's supposed to be this hyper reality, dual reality virtual. It's just not good,

Speaker 2:          01:14:47       you know? Fast forward here. Okay. Now. So that becomes the thing, right? Which you know, it's gonna people are gonna do it and then it's going to become is porn stars will be making all of that fucking money and it basically, you have a girl fucking now they'll probably just be like the whole suit. It's eventually just going to be the whole suit. Right. What are you talking about? I'm talking about like in the future, like when like everybody has like a virtual reality sex suit. This will actually help the population problem, right? The virtual reality sex suit. Okay. And then porn stars will then have their likeness, they'll do a POV porn and then they get money and then you have to like subscribe. So you can do a virtual reality thing where you with any porn star with like awesome. And then he, and then here's what happens.

Speaker 2:          01:15:49       Okay. Who's going to be the first celebrity that crosses over and eventually, right, because they're sick of doing superhero movies and they don't want to do the grunt work of an independent cause. Like you notice now they're all doing ads over here. Back in the day, all the celebrities did ads, but they did him overseas, right. Remember we used to go over and we all look at so and so doing a fucking watch thing or look at her doing this thing, but they'd never do them here because there was that whole stigma that if you did a commercial, you're a sellout, blah, blah, whatever the fuck it was. Or it's like you're doing a commercial, you're a movie star, movie star. It's not even on TV. Forget about doing an ad. Now that all went away, you know? So I'm saying eventually somebody famous would do it,

Speaker 1:          01:16:35       right. You get that? Yeah. Get a suit and program it so that you're having sex with like Lindsay Lohan or something like that. And the first one, the first and the first level will go down. Now I'm like one of those reality TV show stars. You know, one of the reality show goes off the year,

Speaker 2:          01:16:50       like Jersey shore. They will all fucking huge now it's just disappeared. Why the fuck are they right? You could probably talk a couple of them and in doing it right, we pitched in a show right now

Speaker 1:          01:17:00       I think, or some kind of like high tech concept with that will probably make a lot of money that's going to end up having something like a movie. It sounds like. Like, uh, what was it that this is what's going to happen. You're going to have be self-drive

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       and fucking cars. You're going to have self drive and fucking cars and people are going to be laying in them in virtual reality suits having sex with any famous person they want to write. And they'll have like, because you don't need a steering wheel or gas or brake or anything anymore, you'll literally feel like you're suiting there. And then when you're done your rollover up from that seat until like another, like a, uh, like a freshen up like tub or some shit.

Speaker 1:          01:17:36       So I think we're totally going in that direction. I think you're right. We'll, we'll, we'll see it in the next generation. Before it was just, yeah, the fleshbots stuff or just the mold of the vagina or the deck or whatever. And then it's going to be this virtual, it'll be super expensive at first

Speaker 2:          01:17:51       going to go into a complete, that's gonna be like one flat screen TVs first came out and then 14 grants. So don't buy the first virtual reality sex suits virtual wait till they come down to like 800 bucks at best buy. Then you get them right.

Speaker 1:          01:18:06       Figure out how to like make this technology and just like patent it and that's how we'll make our,

Speaker 2:          01:18:11       yeah, we're going to figure out how to do that. I can't even read copy. We're not calling it that. Like that's what's going to happen. I'm already selling right now with these self driving cars, like the interiors of cars. What they're going to have now, they're going to have office ones. They're going to have sleeper ones. People just want to sleep, going to work. They're going to have one second to catch up on your emails and all of that type of shit. Yeah, the different those that'll be like the different, um, the, the social one, the social and office one, all of that type of all, I don't know. And then eventually it's going to be like, well, why are you even going to work now? Because everything's automated. Then there's robots, right?

Speaker 1:          01:18:51       And then one day the whole fucking thing just turns on us. What if there was a company like in someplace really random? Not really random. Like a Japan or, by the way, neither one of us is high right now. No, not at all. Completely that high. It's the middle of the day. Never been more sober. What if there was a company somewhere and like, I dunno, not Japan, but like Eastern Europe that said, we want to do this deal with you where we have these like sex dolls with the your face slot and they offered you like, yeah, an insane amount of money. No, no, to do it. Oh, and you can buy a bill birth sex to haul.

Speaker 2:          01:19:33       Do you realize the photoshops I'm going to get and I'm going to have to re tweak now. You asshole.
