I realize the podcast is actually air quote on time this week. Okay. Don't even start that shit. It's never late. All right. I always take on Monday mornings. That's why I call it the Monday morning podcast. You fucking myopic cons. All right. The only reason why you're getting it this early on Mondays, because I'm taping it on Sunday. The only reason why I'm taping it on Sunday, which I shouldn't even be doing because it's a day of rest. All right? It's a day to sit back after a week of farming. Phil give you a fucking oxygen, some oats, whatever. You feed them Hay. Is that what you feed them? I know what the fuck you feed them. All right. All I know is they don't, they're fucking jacked and then the, you never see them fucking drinking a protein shake. Delia. People would drink protein shakes, you know something? Years later when you get the powder cancer, I don't want to hear about it. Okay. You're drinking a goddamn powdered shake. What do you want the fucking Jetsons? Sit down and have a pork chop like the rest of us.

Speaker 1:          00:01:15       He's fucking idiot. Say they are these goddamn workout people for. He'd go out there and you dress like the green lantern and then you take out your little fucking powder thing. He's a little thing and you shake the thing up and then you suck it down. Just have a fucking salad. You know dude, you know pissed off those people who was selling the Twat of nature where it me, they were actually upset so they won't be on my podcast anyway. They were mad. They were mad. Is this selling that box full of lies? You're you get hungry in the afternoon? Yeah. J what do I do?

Speaker 1:          00:01:58       You can have a fucking banana. Get them an apple. You're going to be fine. Watch the pounds melt off. I don't need you to come over with your tray of snacks. Cigars, cigarettes, cigars, cigarettes. No Fuck Outta here. Okay, and shame on you for going in order in that shit. You Lazy fucking Tba Shit. I'm sorry. I know you're not supposed to fat shame, but I, you know it's time we start fucking some point. You got to tell him to like, look, I know you can't see your bootstraps, but you still should try to reach down and find them and pull them up over your fucking meetings. Fat, flabby shoulders. All right? You ate your way into this situation. You can eat what you eat your way out. Just do everything that you were doing the opposite way. It's like playing a record backwards, except now you're playing it the right way. You've been listening to it back, which [inaudible] Sundays, chocolate Sundae ships sharp, right? You've got to have it. Go on the other way. Oh, this is some Broccoli and Brussels sprouts. It's not a nice song.

Speaker 1:          00:03:08       Oh fuck. I hate taping on Sundays. I'm not funny on fucking Sunday Stair. I admitted just like, God, I need a rest. I don't have time for this shit. I don't have time to be solely on a fucking Sunday. I worked all God damn week. Do you have any microphones? I did fucking take out of a Mike stand this week. Do you understand how sore my wrist is? The fucking, Hey, are you guys doing all right? All right. Keep it going for whoever the fuck was just on the front of me. All right. How's it going? Oh, look at this guy. This guy, he's got snaps on his shirt or the buttons too hard for you. I'm the smartest guy ever. Fuck his job. Look at me. I'm amazing. I got to do that every fucking night on Sunday. I give it a rest. I don't say funny things on Sundays.

Speaker 1:          00:04:02       So you probably ask yourself, well, build and why don't you just do it on fucking Monday? I'll tell you why. I'll tell you why. Because, um, my wife is actually sick. He's got a 24 hour a virus, which I did not think was contagious. I thought she thought she had food poisoning is what it was. What I thought was, so I was laying next to her bed, we'll use in the same fucking bathroom. So basically I'm probably going to get sick and the next 24 hours. So what I'm trying to do is get this podcast out before shit starts coming out of me on both ends, if you know what I mean. All right. I got the wife upstairs. I'm downstairs. I feel like I feel like my wife got bit by a Zombie, you know, and I ever upstairs chained to the Devonport there and I'm just waiting to see if she's going to turn.

Speaker 1:          00:04:51       All we need is Brad Pitt in here telling us what to do. We got ourselves a goddamn movie. Um, yeah. So that's why, uh, that's why this thing is actually out early. And, uh, and once again, fuck all you guys are going to be like, oh, if she gets sick every week. So it could be on time and fucking, I wish the Twat of nature on anybody who says that. Um, all right, sorry. That was me. It was all mean. So anyways, this is the podcast for this week. Uh, has anybody been watching the Olympics? Olympics. Olympics? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Nothing. I actually, I really enjoy watching the Olympics. I like just watching in the games. I don't like all the other horseshit. You know, all the journalists complaining that the water isn't running and all that type of shit. I mean, am I the only guy who watched all those cold war movies coming up when I was growing up? You know what it's like over there. You got the haves and you've got to have nots. There's like 20 people who have some shit over there and everybody else is getting fucked. It's, it's unbelievably corrupt. You know what's going on over there,

Speaker 2:          00:06:01       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:06:04       I don't know. I don't know what the fuck's going on of the, I just, I just want to watch a fucking games, you know, I get it. I get it. They don't, they don't treat gay people the way that they should. I mean, why, why would they, they, they don't even have running water over there surprised in a club in women over their head and dragging them down the street by the fucking hair. Um, have you read some of the shit that they've said about gay people? I mean, it's like feist is this from the, the 18 hundreds, some guy in the Russian government, he, this is what he said. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:06:39       he told, gave, he also told gay visitors to not touch the kids like he's confusing pedophiles with, with, with gay people and fucking real, no wonder the water's not running over there. Now listen, I don't want to take a bunch of pot shots at Russia. I don't want to do this because for some fucking reason I actually like him. I miss him. They were fun. It's like when the red sox are good and the Yankees suck, it's no fun. And for like the last, I dunno, 20 something years they've been there, they're in a Rut right now. They're like the Michigan Wolverine Football Program. Like what the fuck happened? What are you going to get good again? And it's starting to get to the point like, fuck, are they going to turn this around? So I dunno, I don't even know what to tell you. I,

Speaker 2:          00:07:30       you know, I don't understand

Speaker 1:          00:07:36       how you can have the technology to blow up the world and then you still not understand humanity at that point. Right? Don't they get will and grace like translated over there? Can't they see that? There's nothing to worry about. If you guys watched any of the, any of the Games I actually watched, uh, I watched some of the, the cross country ski and I don't know if I'm a f and I in some of the speed skating, like I watched this, the snowboarding I think is fucking amazing, but after a while it just looks like they're all doing the same trick. Okay. And I don't need a bunch of shit from people in their teens and twenties with half your head shaved and the rest of it looking like a comb over. I get it. I'm old. I can't tell the difference. We've seen a backside fakey in a fucking gumby. Twizzler three 60, whatever the fuck you, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:08:30       I'm amazed. I don't know how they do it, but I can only watch like four runs. The, you know, uh, I did just all looks the same. I don't know. I know what they're doing. You fucking, you go down the hill, you jump on the, on the railing or the banister, whatever it is. You do a little grindy thing and then you land and then you in and then you fucking do a little low. Whoop de do B. Do you grab it? You grab this and grabbing the board with the hands. That's a big move. This is me trying to explain it. And then I also learned that when you go to land you're actually looking up the hill. You have your head looking up. They I haven't seen my, I would have looked down the hill. He supposed to look up the hill.

Speaker 2:          00:09:14       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:09:14       All right. I've learned that, eh? Uh,

Speaker 2:          00:09:21       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:09:21       I Dunno. Then you do a lot of high fiving and hugging of other um, other people that you're trying to beat for some reason. There's a lot of comradery and that sport. Other than that, I don't know shit about it, but the speed skating I like and a cross country skiing. Go figure. I liked that shit cause it makes me want to go work out. Like I was watching the women doing it and I'm like, they have burned so many calories, they don't even have titties anymore. Can you imagine? I could get rid of the giant teddy that's right above my pubes. If I started cross country ski, that's what I'm getting out of it though. These women were flying

Speaker 1:          00:10:00       okay up the Goddamn hill and then down Ellie actually they said this year they might actually hit speeds of 50 miles an hour and they are so fucking exhausted by the end of it. You cross the finish line, they all of them collapsed and just fall in the snow. Like they were going to make a snow angel and then they just passed out from too much booze or something and then they're laying on the fucking ground doing that shit and I'm just like, I dunno. There's something about you don't, it is, I'm not fast. So I like endurance shit. You know gymnastics and that type of shit for having a hang from some do an iron cross. Like I look at that stuff and I actually think like, you know, if I tried to do that long enough I could do it. I couldn't do it at an Olympic level, but I could do it. All right. I can watch a guy run a four 40 all day long dunk a basketball. I hit a fucking home run.

Speaker 2:          00:10:56       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:56       In a major league stadium. I'm never going to be able to do that shit. Did I just say I could do an iron cross? Maybe I'm already getting sick right now. Maybe I'm a fuck you. I can do it all. I need some rings.

Speaker 2:          00:11:11       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:11:11       and an old tree to hang them from. Oh my God. Can you imagine? What do you what? What is even, what is the muscle you tear trying to fucking do that. That's your lats. I want to how long that takes a little district. All right, so all you would do, you'd fucking hanging from the tree. You know, once your wife is like dog, so we don't hurt yourself. Once you get through that,

Speaker 2:          00:11:37       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:38       You know a few people with kids and I'm just putting it up for the kids. Don't worry, I'll put some match down or put some leaves here. There'll be fine. I figured what you gotta do, you hang the, have things hanging down and you got to get into the dip position first and then what you do is you gradually start bringing it out and then when you start feeling the fire under your armpits, you bring it back real quick. And just every day you go out there or every other day and he tried to go a little bit farther as is that how you doing? Anybody can anybody who listens to this podcast do an iron cross?

Speaker 1:          00:12:10       Do I have to be wearing like those pants like the feet pajama grape smuggling, fucking a lower pants, lower pants, lower leotard, section of the pants there. Ah, fuck. Why do I try to do this on Sunday five this is why I don't go to church. It's just Sunday. So you know, I don't fucking know. I'm always coming back from the road. I'm always traveling, you know, I fly back and then I'm just, I just lay here catatonic. I'm I, this isn't what I'm supposed to be doing here. Trying to be fucking funny. Anyways, I had a great show this weekend. I was actually out in, uh, Minneapolis, Minnesota at this casino, I believe was called treasure island. I was there, so fucking quick, I flew in, I did the show and I came right back out. It was like minus two degrees the entire fucking time I was there. And that is a level of cold you don't like. I love the winter.

Speaker 1:          00:13:08       I don't give a shit until it gets down. Once it gets into the teens, that's when I give a fuck. That's what I'm like, all right. Enough already. But I don't even mind if it's in the teens and Christmas is coming. It's when it's in the teens and it's just February or January. That's when it's fucking miserable. And it was so fucking cold out there. Even people from Minnesota, we're saying that it was like cold, but, um, anyways, I went out there and, uh, had a great time. Thank you to everybody who showed up. I'm still on the wagon. You know, it's funny, after the show, um, I was hanging, it was me and the other rack that was out there. Jade cat, a prater hope I said that right. Um, I've never known how to say the last name. I came fucking read who fucking killed him in front of me.

Speaker 1:          00:13:59       By the way, I had a great set. So afterwards we're hanging in, we're hanging with the promoter and I'm sitting at the bar and I'm not drinking and I'm fucking drinking oh duels and like how many, oh duals. He literally going to have, so I get one, oh duals. And I'm just sitting there like, all right, I'll sip on this fucking thing and smoke God damn cigar or whatever. And um, so people after the show and go, Hey, can I get you a drink and get your drink? I'm like, I'm like, no, I really appreciate it. Thank you for coming out, but I'm not drinking. Sorry. You know, you know, whatever. Get Jay born if she wants one of Blah, blah, blah. So then people started buying me rounds. They were buying me. Oh duals. So then I'm like, well I got drink it, somebody gave it to me. So like an asshole. All the weight that I've been losing, cause I haven't boozed in like two weeks. Like, now I'm just sitting here pounding out duels pounding, pounding, oh, duels. The dumbest fucking like the emptiest of all empty calories. Just sitting there, slam of things. I got to tell you something for a non alcohol beer, it's, it ain't that fucking bad. And if you have to be at a bar,

Speaker 1:          00:15:05       I dunno. I think I followed it. I think I phoned. See I never yarn on Monday mornings. I think I found, um, I think I go on a nice little run here. If I can just still have my cigars, I have to have some sort of vice. Um, well that'd be bad if I go back upstairs. Right.

Speaker 1:          00:15:26       And my poor wife flag, you know, she's, she's up there right now in Gatorade, saltine cracker, um, hell right now. And she's cool too. She's cool about it. She's cool with me being down here. You know, a lot of women would be like, why can't a conference, you get at least sit in the chair near me. I can't believe that I have, you know, and then you get sick and they're fucking, they don't give a shit. Right. Um, anyways, I didn't tell you guys this. I actually bought off of Ebay. I bought a fucking, I bought a drum kit.

Speaker 1:          00:16:06       You know the one thing that sucks about drums as you cannot play them in a, unless you get it soundproofed in your fucking house. So I actually, I got some drum cases and I'm going to bring these fucking things up. I can't wait to play these goddamn things. I get an old Ludwig Kit. Um, I know what you guys are saying. Send me a picture and that senior picture, just know that there it's an old Ludwig kit. I do time. I will and do time. Let me get my drumming up to a certain fucking level. Cause I know I've promised you guys that I was going to start doing drum covers. I gotta I'll fucking do one. I just got to get somebody to videotape these fucking things in an edit it and all that shit. I just don't know how to do that. And furthermore, I don't want to learn how to do it.

Speaker 1:          00:16:55       I don't need another goddamn hobby. I just, I don't know. You know what it is. I, I have like computer phobia. That's basically what earlier when I was trashing everybody with the new phones and all that, part of that was true. Like, I really think you should pay down your debt before you get another flat screen TV. Before you get another fucking phone. I can, if I could just get anything, just get something through to the listeners on this God damn podcast other than to go after what you want in life as soon as you can. It would be, you know, to just pay down your credit cards. Don't start a fucking life, a death, death, life of debt before you even get married and start having kids and then come out of it, you know, 40, 50 fucking years later when you're in your sixties or seventies. Um, I'm telling you just within your means and you will have the gift of free time, you'll actually get a good night's fucking sleep. Um, but anyways,

Speaker 2:          00:18:02       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:18:03       Yeah. So, but that, um, generally speaking like I have, I have major, uh, I don't know, I learned a lot about myself in the last week. Like, my wife finally convinced me that I have add and I know a lot of you guys who listen to this shit. I'll probably just laughing like, yeah. How the fuck did she know that? You know why? Cause I'm the one trapped in this fucking skull. Okay, sure. You guys have problems too. No, fucking come at me like that. Trying to open up here. Um, I have the yellow wind screen on the mic this week. Okay. Trying to come from my hat here. I get a little sunshine on the Mike here. Um, and I didn't think

Speaker 1:          00:18:45       I didn't think she was right and she was like, no, she goes, I went on a website and I looked up a, and you have every fucking symptom and I always just thought add was just a crutch. Like people, I'm sorry, I have add. I'm sorry. Every add. Oh, I got, I have add. I saw people, you know, I drove into the back of your car. Sorry. I have add. Like it just seemed like this fucking excuse. It seems something like for just something that week people said. So, um, I was just like, no, I'm, um, I'm stupid. Um, and uh, I need to read more. That's basically how I looked at it, which still might be the case. But, um, I finally understood what she was saying cause she, she read some of the symptoms and then I was sitting on the couch and I was talking to her about the Patrice O'Neal benefit coming up. And I was saying how happy I was that, you know, we're doing it two years in a row, we're helping out all the people that he loved. Well, but now people that you know,

Speaker 2:          00:19:52       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:19:53       you know, diabetes, stroke and that type of thing, we've given some money to them. And I'm really talking about how site Diane, that everybody, you know, bought the tickets and opie and Anthony helped out in all the comics. Like, I mean, I have more than enough comedians on the show this year, but she said everybody loved Patrice, want to be on it. So I'm in the middle of this heartfelt conversation with my wife and in, and I'm sitting on one end of the couch. She's on the end. And I sit there and I kind of leaned my head back and I look up at the ceiling and I'm in the middle is talking about how much I love for Teresa and how much I miss him. And I looked up and I went, oh, a spider, there's a spider up there. And I just started talking about the spider. And then I hear her, she starts laughing

Speaker 1:          00:20:34       and I look at her like, what? And it was one of those things she needed to have to say it. She just had this look in her eye, like that shit we were talking about earlier as you leave buried her face in the pillow and just started laughing at me. And I was like, and I actually know typical guy thing, I had to try to defend myself. Mike, no, I mean there's a spider and how do you not address the spider? And then I really thought about it later, like the level of, of emotional shit that I was talking about. And then just one stupid fucking spider. Oh, there's a spider. Like did another thing that when I go to leave the fucking house.

Speaker 2:          00:21:08       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:21:09       I Dunno. Maybe I'm trying to help out other people who might have this fucking problem is like, and she told me she would go, well, you should go talk to somebody bought us. Like, I don't want to talk fucking talk to somebody about it. They're going to give me a god damn drug that they pushed through the FDA that's going to fuck up my liver and do something else to me. But I can really focus when the doctor tells me I have this new kind of fucking cancer,

Speaker 1:          00:21:33       whatever happened to just toughen it out. You know, you fucking Rogaine pussies just go bald like me. Um, anyways, how many times do I say this? What the fuck was I talking about? The same goddamn thing. This is it. I made your fucking problems. So she wanted me to go talk to somebody about it. I'm like, I'm not fucking doing that. But uh, I've just really noticed like the amount of times, like take something simple. I'll have like a grocery list or something. If I ever made a grocery list in my life, let's just say for shits and giggles. I do. I'll have that on my or my phone or something like that. I have my phone and I'm going to leave the house and I go, Oh fuck. Where are my keys? I need my keys. So then I walk over and I go over and I pick up my keys. All right. See you later honey. And I walk out of the house. I sit in the car, I turn on the fucking car and then I look around. Where's my phone? I left it the fucking house.

Speaker 2:          00:22:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:22:37       How did I do that? I had the phone, I knew I needed the phone, I needed the keys and it's just like I walk up there and my brain is thinking about 90 other fucking things other than in somewhere in there is I need the keys and I walk over to get the fucking keys I guess with the same hand and I sat down the phone. It's like, almost like you don't, like when you, when you're blackout drunk, it's like technically you passed out, but somebody is still awake in your body walking around talking to people that you're later going to have to apologize for this kind of the sober version of that. For those of you who aren't afflicted with this, whatever the hell I have.

Speaker 2:          00:23:15       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:15       Maybe that's why I suck at reading. I don't know what it is.

Speaker 2:          00:23:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:21       Because I, I really want to sit here and say that I'm not a dumb guy, but fucking everything. And I always talk about how much I sucked in high school. I haven't went like, I want one time like, well, we had to do a book report and I got this book, it was about this German shepherd in World War Two that fall along side. This guy who was a great fucking book.

Speaker 2:          00:23:43       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       And uh, I remember the first night I sat down to read it and it took me like four hours, couldn't have been four. It was like three hours to read, 30 pages, two and a half hours to read 30 fucking pages. And the next day I went into school. I still remember the kid, I said this too. I said, yeah man, it took me fucking, I was reading the book for two and a half hours and they were like, how many pages? You got to say, wow. I mean, Paige is into a, and I said 30 and he just started laughing at me and I said to him, he goes, I go, what? He goes, it took you two and a half hours to read 30 pages. And I was like, what? I said, I read to understand it. He just started laughing at me, thought that was the funny. He thought I was trying to be funny and what I was really was trying to convey to him was I had to, I kept reading paragraphs and my brain would be thinking about other shit and I had to go back and reread it over and over and over and over again. So I had to go that slowly so I could understand it. It was basically my naive way of I guess, explaining. Look. All I'm saying is if I don't have add, I am surprisingly stupid,

Speaker 3:          00:25:05       but whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:25:07       It's helped me like maybe that's why I can't write a fucking script, but I can write bits cause this this short. Right. You know what I like about this add shit. I can explain away all my problems. This is phenomenal.

Speaker 3:          00:25:20       Hey, guess what?

Speaker 1:          00:25:27       All right. Does that mean anything to, she's looking at me right now. She was laying down. She just picked up her head. She was awake. By the way. It's one of those deals with it. She's got one year down and one year up. You know? Can you get any fucking, I challenge you right now to tell me something cuter in the animal kingdom than a fucking jacked animal that could rip your fucking face off that anytime it decides to waking up from an, from a nap with one year down in one year up.

If you don't, I understand you're busy. You got shit to do. Uh, all right, let's move on here. Hey, how fucking weird and awful is right after the super bowl that first Sunday without football. I don't know about you guys, but it's always so goddamn jarring.

Speaker 2:          00:37:47       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:37:49       Because you're so watching the playoffs and you're so getting into it and your soul trying to guess who's going to win the Superbowl and fucking get, get your bets going and all of that shit that you don't even contemplate that. The second that game's over, football is now done.

Speaker 2:          00:38:05       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:38:06       dawn until September. Fuck that bullshit in August. All right. It's done until September. What in God's name are we going to do now? I'd say turn on the fucking hockey, but it's the Olympics,

Speaker 2:          00:38:21       so,

Speaker 1:          00:38:22       oh, actually can actually watch women's hockey because the men's hockey doesn't start for a minute. Please. Everybody. Do me a favor. Watch. Some of that Olympic hockey sit down and enjoy it. It's going to be phenomenal. And when you do enjoy it, don't say that dumb shit like, like everybody says actually tweeted about this, you know, every four years during the winter Olympics, people who don't watch hockey get to lie and say that if NHL, if the NHL was like Olympic hockey, that they would actually watch Olympic hockey. You wouldn't, you would, you were either a basketball person or a hockey person. There's very few people who have the time to watch both. All right. Another thing that always happens during the Olympics is when people praise the Olympic game, um, they start talking about the NHL. Like it's still 1975. I heard, uh, Mike Wilbon who I love and one of the few shows that I actually like PTI on a ESPN. He even hinted like that. He goes, it's great. I love the Olympic hockey. You know, if the Nh, he goes, you know, at the NHL would get the fighting and all this stick work, all this stuff. What does that mean? All the stick work?

Speaker 1:          00:39:40       What the fuck? What does that mean? That guys are just club and each over the fucking head. You know why they say that? Because once every four or five years goes by, somebody does that shit actually club somebody in the face with a goddamn and then that's the thing that gets on sports center and then all these people who don't watch hockey at all or or or watch it in passing then start going like nice is a card game and they always go in the fighting. Dude, this, I've been saying this for years, I said this in 2010 during the Olympics there's barely any fighting left in NHL hockey compared to the way it used to be. Okay. Back in the day you used to have like at least two if not three guys on every team who are on your team to beat the shit out of the other two to three guys that were on that team to try to beat the shit out of your guys.

Speaker 1:          00:40:36       Like when I was growing up, when I first started watching the Bruins, they had John went sick and Stan, Jonathan and one of our all star players. The heart of the team was Terry O'Reilly and he fought just as much as he scored back then it was, he was known as a complete player. He could do whatever you wanted to do. You want the puck in the net. I don't know how good he was a defense, but whatever he gave it his all you want to drop the gloves? He could fucking do everything. Wayne Cashman was another guy. I mean he was like a gold score, that guy and he, he, I just remember Fred Cusick. Oh, Cashman with the left. Yeah, this left hook. Um, and then I caught the tail end of those guys and then it was Jay Miller Linden buyers along the way. We'd pick up guys like Willie Plett and then the islanders. The island has had all these guys. Great Hall of fame, tough guys. Chris Nilan, cordic everybody. And then they weren't in the same fucking team. Okay. Now, like I don't even know how many like actual goons, straight up fucking fighters I want. I'm not going to say goons are, are, are still in the Goddamn league.

Speaker 1:          00:41:50       Like right now the, the Bruins have one, Sean Thornton and he can actually play the game. I know a lot of you guys going to say what's the why of what? About what he did against the penguins. That's going to happen. Okay. Especially when you give somebody a couple of love taps and they actually somehow get knocked out. I don't want to be a dick, but I think I could have taken those punches. Oh wait, can we eat from the peg? Would feds. Um, and I know what they're going to be saying is they're actually going to say, well, why is there fighting? Why is there fighting in hockey? Which is the dumbest fucking question. Never. It's like you're going to address that and say, well, why is there fighting period.

Speaker 2:          00:42:34       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:42:34       Why is there fighting and boxing? Why is there fighting in the UFC? Why is that? Okay? But if every once in a while it happens in hockey, it's the most just, you know, deplorable fucking thing that ever happened and now you've got to make comments on society and the direction that is going in.

Speaker 2:          00:42:53       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:42:53       Through the Bruins played the fucking Canadians a couple of weeks ago and I'm pretty sure there wasn't even a fight in it. Those things, by halfway through the first period, once a year, they'd have that game halfway through the first period they would be like nine guys in the penalty box and like fucking, I don't even know if that's even possible. They, they, they, they would be standing room only in the fucking penalty box and now they'll play each other and they just play the fucking game.

Speaker 2:          00:43:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:43:22       Without having any fights. But the fights are part of the Goddamn game. And so I understand if you don't like hockey because of the fighting, but for the love of God, please quit complaining about it because they're ruining the game because they're going to take fighting out of it and you're not going to watch it. You're not going to watch it. You're going to watch it the way I watch curling. I watch it once every four years and I really enjoy it and I think like, wow, I could actually watch this sport. Like I'm really going to go out and get the curling package and start watching it religiously every fucking year. I'm not going to do it. All right, so for the love of God, please enjoy the Olympic hockey and watch it, but keep you fucking uninformed comments about the NHL to yourself because it's an unbelievable game. It's a great league. And one of the reasons why it is so great is because not as many people watch it as the other three fucking leaks. Nope. I just love that people fucking still bitch about hockey and like the fucking NBA had a mobbed up ref literally shoeless Joe Jackson kind of Shit and they just gloss it over. I mean it was a story, but it was like, well, we had one bad apple, one bad apple. The fucking guy prevented the Sacramento Kings from going to the finals. The Lakers got another ring or an opportunity. I'm not taking away the fact that they won in the finals.

Speaker 1:          00:44:50       What this fucking guy admitted that he fixed the God damn series.

Speaker 1:          00:44:56       So they have, they have a championship. Just like when the white sox through the world series, you have the same thing going on except it was done by someone on an officiating crew and I, you hear more shit about the fighting and hockey than you heard about that. It's unfucking believable. I actually got a friend of mine who will remain nameless and he claims this, I don't know why he would lie. He was working for uh Oh, this is tough. I gotta Watch out. I'm going to get sued. He was warm. He was working for a basketball team that I'm not particularly fond of, that I may or may not have made fun of on numerous times and may have already made fun of them on this podcast about championship claims, but I'm not going to say who they are. They're way uniforms. Remind me of Barney the dinosaur. All right. That's for anybody who doesn't watch sports. You can't figure it out. All right. They worked at the arena and there was one game left and this team was playing another team that was up north where it rains a lot, but they didn't lose their basketball team. And there was one game left in the series

Speaker 1:          00:46:06       and the guy who just stepped down told the people for the Barney the dinosaur team to fucking order all the craft service or something like that. The fucking get the seats set up for the media and all that. But he only said it for the Barney, the dinosaur team, not for the rained out fucking team.

Speaker 1:          00:46:25       And the Barney the dinosaur team for like, before the game even happened, he was claiming that there's no fuck cause he, he knew somebody who was in the, uh, the fucking, uh, the other team's front office and they were not given instructions to get prepared for the next playoff series. So it wasn't like we need to be prepared just in case he only told one team to fucking do it. And it ended up being the team that won the, I know that, that sounds fucking crazy. I'm not saying it's true. I'm not saying it's not true, but all I know is for fucking years. I was saying the NBA is fixed and then I'm vindicated when they have a fucking mobbed up ref and it's like a fucking God damn. Like it was maybe a 10 day story. It was really hard for a couple of days. And then that was it.

Speaker 1:          00:47:10       It just went away. Oh, he's just had one to one fucking guy. One mobbed up ref fucking a team out of a championship. That chance to win a championship. That's all. But the fighting, Oh and and the stick work, the, the, the Tom foolery. It just has to stop. You don't even have to watch hockey at this point to criticize it. So many people have criticized the fucking thing. You can just say what they say. All right, I'm done. I'm done. I got my fucking, I'll get my panties in a bunch of you. Um, all right, let's, let's, let's read some, uh, let's read some of the, that the sh the shit here for the week. Some of the, uh, the, the uh, what do you call these things here? See, this is another thing too. That's my add. I can't remember things because they have add.

Speaker 1:          00:47:59       Why'd you take your Dick out in public bill? I'm sorry. I got a date day. Um, all right. Yo, Billy Dee Williams. My chick is a diehard nine of fan and after five years dating her, I've gotten into my, I've gotten into football myself. Others consider me a conspiracy theorist. Oh, Jesus. Now we're going right into conspiracy here. Right after nine 11 I called it that the Patriots would win to symbolize the Phoenix style rebirth of American patriotism. Sure enough, the Patriots won. All right. I'm going to go with you on that one, dude. I called it all right. He said this year I made another prediction that I was really hoping would be wrong. I had a feeling that Seattle, the team icon, which resembles the America's Bald Eagle, will beat Denver's horse team, which represents China's Year of the horse. This to symbolize the west domination over the east to further support. My previously stated theory. They weren't. There were a ton of pro soldier and patriotic commercials. I'm very curious to see what political events are to come in. 2014 thoughts. Yeah, dude, your, you're way too far down the fucking rabbit hole.

Speaker 2:          00:49:20       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:49:21       I've never understood that thing. Like, like the symbols on TV thing. That's always, to me it seemed like paranoid thought. Um, and fuck everybody right now. Who thinks my NBA shit, his paranoia, they had a mobbed up ref go fuck yourself. Um, it was fixed. I'm not saying straight across the board, but it was fixed on a certain fucking level. This shit here. Like first of all.

Speaker 2:          00:49:49       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:49:49       All right. So yeah. Titles team which resembles and American Bald Eagle. It doesn't,

Speaker 2:          00:49:56       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:49:57       it doesn't, we'll beat the horse. I got to tell you, I didn't know it was the year of the horse. And I think I pretty much represent the average Joe and uh, uh, see gold doesn't, a seagull does not look like what's on the side of, of, of, of the Seahawks and a single fucking sea hawk. I'm an asshole. I don't even realize, I was saying that a sea hawk does not look like a fucking, uh, a bald eagle. It doesn't a real one doesn't. The one that they showed looks nothing like the cartoon version that they have on the side of the fucking head. And even if it does. Okay. The average Shithead, the way you have to spell stuff out, I mean the average shithead is ordering the Twat from nature there and having a box of fucking chocolate covered peanuts delivered to their desk. They going to stick those in their mouth and then wonder why they don't have abs. Do you think they're going to be able to figure out the American Bald Eagle and the Denvers horse? I'm a patriots fan. All right. Like I don't think, I just never made the connection. I think you're, you're looking,

Speaker 1:          00:51:09       so you're saying the Illuminati is also running a football league?

Speaker 3:          00:51:17       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:51:18       Now what if the Falcons won? What would that, what does that have meant?

Speaker 2:          00:51:24       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:51:24       the Green Bay packers. What will you know, do all of them symbolize something like every year? Somebody who won last year, who the fuck one last year? I don't even remember. Usually good about that shit. Two years ago the giants won. I remember that. Cause they beat my fucking patriots. What does that mean that giants are for the Taliban? Yeah, dude, I, I think that your, um, I'm like if the 40 niners when it, that means like we're coming back to slave labor, your load 16 tons and water, you get big John Big jaw, big bad drone. Uh, yeah dude, I think that, uh, I think you're, you're, you're kind of going beautiful mind there. You're reading the daily paper and you're trying to to see stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:52:14       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:52:14       That isn't there. Yeah. To symbolize what the West domination over the east. I gotta be. I gotta be honest with you. I don't understand, you know, as far as I'm concerned, China is west of where I'm at. So how are they in the east?

Speaker 2:          00:52:35       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:52:36       I mean, when I fly to China, if I ever go to China, I'm going to go west. They're going to fly me up to Alaska, make a left and then go right by fucking South Korea. Hopefully you don't get shut down as we go by Russia and then I'm in China. I'm not going to go east. How did they decide that? Is that because that's where we will po populated. Like if everybody came from Africa like Nas and all the rappers say, you know, cause they've done their research in between blunts.

Speaker 1:          00:53:09       Um, if we actually all came from there then why doesn't the day start right there? Cause I know, I understand where you were living on this fear that the world is round. Who's to say where the day starts? Why does it store Japan? All right, sorry. There you go. It was a nice little fucking minute and a half to make you feel better about yourself intellectually moving on. Alright, championships in Seattle. Billy Boldface, I'm not sure if you heard about this, but Seattle has a few championships in women's basketball. I'm obviously no one gives a fuck, but this is what's great. I imagine the women who play on the team give a shit and those 37 people who were related to him in the crowd, I'm sure they do. Oh fuck. That's too close to a Joe Bart. Nick joke. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:53:58       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:53:58       I imagine they give a shit. Let's see. Says, there's a great picture going on around it, around have a headline. Seattle's first championship from the Seattle newspaper below the headline is a picture of a player from the Seattle's women's basketball team as she's looking up at a bunch of banners for championships that they've won.

Speaker 2:          00:54:19       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:54:20       well don't they mean like the Seahawks first championship? Cause even if they aren't sexist, when they realized that the supersonics won a championship. Dude, wait a minute. Do you not do, do like not count that one now because the sonics move to uh, to Oklahoma City and became the thunder. I don't understand that. Like, you know, it was cool this weekend I saw somebody in the crowd and a Minneapolis Lakers tee shirt. I thought it was great and I was telling them I go those five championships. I, you know, as far as fans go, you guys claim those, the franchise, you know, has the trophies but the fans, those are your championships, right? Has to be passed to fucking be if, if the Lakers moved to fucking Las Vegas. So one again next, next year. What would the, what would Los Angeles fans do if they started going, yeah, we got 17 bitch. You'd be like, well, wait a minute. No. 16 of those one in La and then Minneapolis fans. We have now five of those 11 championships. One in La, five, one in Minneapolis. One of them was in the fucking Ba. Oh Jesus. Bill, let it go, man. I go fuck yourself. I like, I like being a cunt. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:55:43       so yeah, I mean women's championships don't count as much because of women. It's their fault. It's their fault.

Speaker 2:          00:55:54       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:55:55       Because guys don't sit around watching the WWE NBA. We keep supporting the NBA. What women need to do is say fuck the NBA and just start watching the WNB ate. And what they should be doing is they should be selling out those arenas, cheering on the women there. That's who needs to do it. Right. Then they should all get together with all their alimony money and they should buy out the men that started the WWE NBA and should run it themselves.

Speaker 2:          00:56:25       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:56:25       And then no longer do you need the NFL to be wearing pink in October. You could fucking be wearing it all year and your league,

Speaker 1:          00:56:33       Jesus Christ. I don't know if I just solved some problems or a offended everybody from cancer survivors to uh, people with the village over there. Um, I don't give a fuck whatever, take, take, take the podcast. Seriously. That's, that's been happening lately. The couple of native Americans get sent me some angry tweets number a few weeks ago when I was making fun of white ignorance when I said that, uh, Hawaii was not part of the United States because no white people look right out in Hawaii. But you look fine on the mainland. Like look leaning up against an oak tree. I look fine and I'm like, and I'm so sick and native American, it's so, I'm so sick of arguing with the patches. I literally said that, that like, like that wasn't enough. That wasn't absurd enough for someone to get the joke. People were, were like doing that, you know, at Jim Norton Character, a little literal gym.

Speaker 1:          00:57:22       They would, they were doing that like, well the reason, well you look doable cause you fucking killed all of us. Like, I don't know that like I'm somehow for that. I don't know. Anyways, but whatever, continue to take it seriously. I had actually, somebody wrote me last week, I said they, I said fighting like a pitbull and somebody wrote this woman wrote fighting like a pit bull. Really? You fucked her hard and she went on and on and on and on and on. And I wanted to write back, well like okay, I rescued a pit bull pit. Bulls were bred to fight messiness. Right. Okay. And lastly, fuck Todd is a play on retard. So it's okay to make fun of people who are mentally challenged but not dogs get twisted cunt. But I don't, I don't write that back cause you know what? They don't want Twitter.

Speaker 1:          00:58:11       They don't give you enough letters. Oh all right. The Art of baking dear billion billion. As of late, I've been baking. I would never know how to say this. Scones sconces of the things that are on the walls and I only reason why I know that was because I had to say that one time at an audition. Scones. He said, all right, I'll just say scones. I don't give a fuck. As of lately I've been baking scones and he, right, right. Oh, Jay z's are they good? I got the idea from you and your lovely Pumpkin Pumpkin. Loafs uh, you sound so pumped talking about your baking and it made me want to try it. It certainly adds another dimension, uh, to my game with the leg. Oh, absolutely do. Let me tell you something. One thing, one thing about women, all right, other than the fact that they do not support other women playing basketball, at least they don't do it enough. The other thing about women is they like fucking suites.

Speaker 2:          00:59:12       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:59:12       Okay. They love a guy that can cook. If you can actually fucking make something sugary, it's great on two levels. One, it makes you seem like you're going to be a good husband and father, even if you're not, it just makes it seem that way and they're more apt to bag. Don't ask me why. I don't pretend to understand them. Okay. And then secondly, if you actually marry that woman when she starts getting all fucking crampy, you know, and getting all bitchy when she gets the cramp toe still over there, what you can do is just whip up a little pumpkin bread, little sugar. Okay, you go, here you go honey. Fuck machine in her face. And then she, you know, she's not as irritable. It's an understandable irritability. Don't get me wrong, but believe me, I know there's a lot of female comics will say, hey, if you started bleeding from you dick once a month, you'd be complaining too.

Speaker 1:          01:00:02       Yeah, and if I did and you didn't, you'd be bitching about my mood. So go fuck yourself. All right. Um, so anyways, he says, uh, nothing twinkle toes about baking to impress a girl. Yeah, it is. It's still very a feminine baking is a feminine. I don't care how you look at it. There's nothing wrong with it. You're getting in touch with your feminine side. I'm so proud of you. Here's another thing you can do. Somebody sent me an email about this too. You want to, you want to really start slaying it. If you have no fucking game and you need to do something to make your franchise look a little more attractive. So maybe you can make one or two big signings during this off season. All right, learn how to bake. And by all means, take a fun start taking yoga classes. Yoga classes are 98% women.

Speaker 1:          01:00:52       All right? And I don't know what it is. Most of them are fucking hot. Now a lot of you have, granted I've taken yoga classes in New York City and Los Angeles. So there there's that. So knock that down by about 30%. Um, and also a lot of them are career driven. So there's not a lot of moms in, there's a lot of single women in their very limber, fucked in the head. Women, you know what? Fuck that. Scratch all that. Learn how to bake no matter where you are. But take yoga and like Miami, Take Yoga classes where there's going to be a lot of hot women. They golf. There's my stupid advice for the week. Anyways, let's, let's continue here. He said, the ladies get turned on by a guy who can cook slash bake because it exemplifies our capability to follow instructions. Parenthesis, recipe, and B, they can tell by the texture that you're good with your hands needing. What are you gonna need? Her titties

Speaker 1:          01:01:51       is fucking grabbing her ass cheeks, you know, seven Lena. Um, anyways, he says, thanks for letting us in on that little secret. Hey Dude, it's all you buddy. You fucking took it and you ran with it. Um, yeah, that's all that shit I'm telling you right now. If you fucking, if you want to upgrade the level of ash and your life and you just look at yourself in the mirror and you're like, no matter what I do when I look at myself, you know, I'm like, I'm like a six, a five. If you, I'm Tony. If you learn how to fucking big, okay, just shit. You know what you do? You learn how to make shit that they like to eat. What's that? What's those? Looks like Lasagna. It looks like a pie, but it has eggs in it. Quiche. That was a called.

Speaker 1:          01:02:38       I can never fucking remember the old way. I remember what that's called is I remember the actor's Stacy Keach. So that's the nickname for that shit. Whenever I see it with Nia, like we'll come walking in and I'll look at the breakfast options and then whenever I see it I just go stay and she laughs for whatever fucking reason cause she gets my sense of humor. So you've learned how to do that. Here's another one. All right. Learn how to make red velvet pancakes. I swear to God, I'm not saying every woman likes this, but you just increased by 2% your chances of some day banging a model if you know how to make red velvet pancakes, okay? Some tall woman will come into your life. I'm guaranteeing it right now. He got a 2% chance more. She'll come into your life, she'll eat those red velvet pancakes.

Speaker 1:          01:03:23       Okay? She will quickly go to the bathroom, she will puke. I'm up and then jump on your Dick and you're not even going to give a fuck. Okay. Cause she's hard. Yeah, sorry. Um, that was disgusting on so many levels. Anyways, he says, I'm looking forward to seeing you in Ottawa. Hopefully you get a chance to escape on the canal. Uh, Jesus Christ. If that doesn't sound like the most feminine thing ever, I'll fucking do that in a second. He said you're always welcome to come play hockey with us after the show. Get the fuck Outta here. Where I want to play. I got two shows there I think. Do Fuck that. If there's a game after the show in Ottawa, I want in. Don't fuck me cause I'm, I'm going to check my hockey shit. Are you going to be mad at me if I play? I have to play pond hockey with all my hockey gear on because I'm in the middle of a tour. I can't crack my skull, my knee or my elbow there. Um, to C'mon, let's do it and fight me.

Speaker 1:          01:04:22       Can I come over your house? I feel like the kid with no friends. I'll do. That'd be a great fucking youtube video. All you Canadian guys out there like no hats on street clothes, skating all around me as I'm out there looking like Robo Cop. Let's fucking do it. Versie not knowing how to skate. Sitting there with a [inaudible] standing on a frozen pond. I'm all over it. All right, there we go. Here's one from um, about one of my favorite comedians of all time, Doug Stanhope. He said, Bill heard you. Gotta you got gotta shout out on Doug. Stan helps podcasts. Uh, what a great guy. I'll tell you that Doug Stanhope, you know what? Biggest Heart in the fucking business. He's just a great fucking guy. You really love about stand up. He, he's one of the best comics of all fucking time. Any still a fan of standup, like actually will sit there and enjoy watching you. Sets of fucking thrill. Anytime that guy, he's given me way too compliments a top shelf. That's the Johnny blue of compliments, right? They're getting that from Stan hope. Um,

Speaker 2:          01:05:25       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:05:25       He says, anytime I hear people talk about your podcast, they say it's cool that you do it by yourself and you can somehow keep it funny. Love that you don't have guests. Except it'd be cool if you have Stan hope on some time. Yes, I know. We have to make that happen. I promise you that will happen. In fact, I will text him at the end of this podcast unless I forget and if I forget, it's not my fault because I have add. Oh Man. You know what? I get to use it on my wife. That'll be the funniest fucking shit ever.

Speaker 1:          01:05:56       I'm just going to start using it as an excuse. And you know what? She's going to laugh because she has a great sense of humor, but I'm going to do it until maybe five days afterwards become already become annoying just because those last five days, it'll be fun for me and I'm selfish. All right, Vermont. This one's talking about for my bill. I see you're coming to Vermont. Fucking finally. No one ever comes up here. Yeah. Well what, why would you think that is? How about the fact that you don't have a comedy club? Unless it's part of a, it's like a function. Roman at a hotel. The only time I ever performed in Vermont, I performed in a comedy zone in uh, Burlington.

Speaker 2:          01:06:35       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:06:35       a long, long time ago. Like literally, was it eight coming up on like 18 years ago? Like 18. Holy Fuck am I old? Um, I'm getting like scary old. That was 18 fucking years ago. Holy Shit.

Speaker 1:          01:06:56       Holy Shit. Yeah. Well you guys don't have a comedy club with their, what? The 41 from me. All you have is that beautiful land. You Syrup your foliage. Um, it's not like I haven't come to Albany. Why don't you get in a car and come down to civilization? I got to go up there to your fucking moonshine still. And he goes, he goes, so how are you going to pass the time? I don't see you as someone who fantasizes about shooting a moose. I know you're, you're drinking, but Fremont has what's considered, I guess you meant not drinking, but Vermont is considered, uh, what's considered the best beer in the world right now? It's called heady topper. Holy Shit, Bill. It's good storage. Get their shipment Tuesday and sell up by Wednesday. It's fucking awesome. Here's an article I'll give you guys the link so they can sell out in the same day. Uh, also what, what are you x? What are your experiences with Vermont? Um, I, I love Vermont am I, I'm a New England guy. I grew up out there. I go to Vermont and I think I would love to own a house up here. I'm sorry if I could somehow survive in this business. Um,

Speaker 1:          01:08:05       you know, I would live in a p I would live in a place like that. I think I would go a little bit crazy cause I definitely need a little bit of action. I def I liked the city. I mean I'm a suburb guy. I'm not a country guy. So, um, I dunno dude, that actually sounds great. If I could get a fucking log cabin, I know you don't live in log cabins out there, but uh, I don't, you know, it was fucking business. I, you know, I'm tired man. I did a lot of roadwork and the more road you do, just the more you, you need a fucking vacation. But once you start selling tickets on the road, you get afraid. If I take a fucking week off, they going to move on to the next guy. Um, you know, I actually had somebody, uh, some email I was reading and they were complimenting my act and they said, hey bill, do you ever think some young whippersnappers going to come along and pass shoe and replace you? Uh, absolutely.

Speaker 1:          01:09:10       Absolute fucking lutely. It always happens if Jordan can get too old for the NBA. I can't get too old for standup, you know, at some point, no matter how much you stay informed, you know, you're going to be doing those matinee shows with whoever's, we'll still alive from your fucking fan base. I don't mind it. Um, it's supposed to happen. What I'm supposed to do is pickup the comedy torch and run with it as far as I can. And when I collapsed, I fucking hold it up like the dude, try not to spill his white Russian. We've got a beverage here, man. Um, and then the next person comes along, they grab it and they run with it and you fucking cheer him on. Tell him to take it to the next level. And you know why that is sir? Because standup does not belong to me. It's not mine. It's an art form. It's a privilege to be able to do it and make a living at it. So I try to respect that and I'll do it as long as I can, but like, you know, I mean shit, it fucking happens to everybody, which is why I don't have the new cell phone. It's why I drive a seven year old. The hybrid. I only have one fucking TV. You hear Echo Echo in my fucking house because um, I all my money goes to pay in this fucking thing down.

Speaker 1:          01:10:34       So, uh, cause I know that day's going to come. That fucking day's going to come where I'm going to be sitting there. You don't want me anymore. But what about the show? I did 96 in Vermont. Um, yeah, it happens to everybody. All right. I guess that's why he's supposed to have kids some day so you can watch them, you know, pass it onto them. That is one of my goals though. I never want to become some bitter person. I always want to be cheering on.

Speaker 2:          01:11:02       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:11:03       whoever's coming next, you know, that's the way you should be. You shouldn't be a fucking Dick about it. Um, you know, and then also knowing that they're coming, that drives you like, let's see how long I can keep these fucking plates spinning before they, and eventually my arms are gonna get tired and we read them. We finished. Ah, Jesus. That's depressing. Whatever. What are you gonna do? All right. Swimming. Hey Billy White thighs. Ah, Shit. That one actually hurts. It's fucking true fucking wallpaper piece there. Um, do you ever think about installing a lap pool? Yes, I have. Before we bought this house, I looked at another house and they had it there. I didn't like the house, but I love that. I think that that would be great. Not like a lap pool. You mean like the thing where you basically,

Speaker 1:          01:11:49       it's like long enough for you to lay down, unless you're a basketball player and just start swimming and you're swimming against this current one of those ones. What do you mean literally a pool he says anyways, or maybe joining a gym that has a pool. It's a full body workout. Anytime I see old dude's swimming, I imagine they're really healthy. I knew stormers in college and they ate and drank like animals, but they were always really cut because they swam miles every day. I think the hardest part of getting into the gym and to a gym pool routine is having to see other people. Also, the first few times when you're inevitably tired, after half a lap, plus there's no sharks in the water. Um, I love what you guys even write it in the Boston accent now be said so we don't have to hear you cry about your inner fears.

Speaker 1:          01:12:36       My interferes is getting old and weak. So I started swimming and it's great. Uh, see how we brought that back around. Very nice. Very nice. Um, yeah, no, dude, you're doing yourself a service. You really are. Uh, I am a firm belief that you should work out your entire life. We should always do it. I mean, I'm not saying go out and still play full court basketball. I mean, in your, even your thirties or 50s, just get Shin splints. It's fucking up your feet. Uh, I think that you should do some form of exercising. I love swimming. I, um, I, I am concerned about, I guess Olympic swimmers haven't died of any cancer. So the chlorine I guess, isn't that bad. But that is one thing when you jump into a pool, you're jumping into a bunch of chemicals, but I guess that's better than jumping into a, you know what the chemicals are killing. So we'll leave it at that. Yeah. You know what? You don't want to look that up right now. Let's look up what one of those little stationary lap things are. See what this is for the person who has everything. And then I want to do what might the final advertising for this fucking week. All right, what do we got here? Let's see here. Lap Pool. Let me just look this up.

You guys really want to sit here and listen to me fucking reading about lap pools while those things are cool as hell though. Um, yeah, I, I thought about getting one until I saw how much they were and now that I know how much they are, I am not. I am no longer interested. I need a friend.

I get one of those fucking things and then within a month I'd be bored and I would go and do something else. I'm the worst.

Speaker 2:          01:18:25       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:18:25       I'd still owe all that money. Tranquil lap pool. Jesus Christ. You know what? I'm going to look at these fucking things. Anybody out there sell lap pools? How many fucking, how many of these do you sell a month? Jesus Christ.
