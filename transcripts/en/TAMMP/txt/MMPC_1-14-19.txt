Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday, January 13th, 2018 what's going on? How, why? Yeah. How's it going? I know. I'm, I know I'm late. I know I'm fucking late. Like your girlfriend after prom night. All [inaudible] sorry for the bad joke. And this is going to be a lot of bad jokes on this. This is old Billy jet lag. All right. You know, remember buddy, love in fucking the nutty professor. You know, it was a cooler version of him. Um, I'm not cool on any level, so it just becomes worse versions of me. And today you're going to be listening to old Billy jet lag. It's five 41 in the morning and I'd been up for the last two hours. Uh, you know, I don't, I'm, I'm on. Yeah, I'm on, I'm back in La. I'm going, going back back to Billy.

Speaker 1:          00:00:56       Billy. I'm all American belly again. And I'm so glad to be back in a country that likes Donald Trump. You know, it's about time. And I know there's a few Hollywood people out here that are trying to make it seem like there's a bunch of people out there that don't care for Donald Trump and it's just simply not the case. The guy has the highest approval rating of any president ever. He has a higher approval rating then. Then I'll dictators where people are afraid to say they don't like him. This is all true stuff. You know, it's funny as he will quote this podcast as a, as a fan, as a fact to say that shit about himself. Um, all right. I thought I could do my podcast with my mouth guardian. I can't do it. Hang on a second. Hang on a second. All right, I'm back.

Speaker 1:          00:01:50       I know what you guys are thinking. Like Jesus Christ. Bill, you're 50 years old. You still have a mouth guard. You're still wearing a fucking retainer, huh? What are you going to use sophomore semiformal next week? Um, no, I got that Invisalign and I'm actually, Yay. I listened to what the dentist says, which is, you know, all these people get Invisalign. They go through all the fucking, the pain in the ass shit of having this stuff. And then when the second day I had done that, give them the mouth guard and they don't wear it, and then their teeth gradually just become trucking again. Not me, not me. I'm smarter than that.

Speaker 2:          00:02:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:27       I pay for this shit, you know? But it's like getting your car fixed and you go out and you fucking sideswipe a tree. Why would you do that?

Speaker 2:          00:02:35       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:36       You know, you may not have a lot of things in life, but if you could have nice straight teeth that gets you through a lot of stuff, cops literally show up, you know? Why did you beat that woman? I didn't beat her. Oh, look at his big shiny teeth. Hey Sweetheart, what were you wearing that made them do that? That's what happens. That's how you get out of it. Um, anyways, I'm very, very, uh, happy to come back. My, Oh my God, my daughter gave me like four. The greatest hugs I've ever gotten in my life when I got home. It was awesome. And it's so weird, you know, when they're that little, they hug gear, but then immediately I want to go run and go do something else, you know, and Gosh, she doesn't even care. And then she kept coming back, hugging me before she'd go run back over to a toy.

Speaker 1:          00:03:19       So it was pretty, uh, it was pretty awesome. Uh, we finished the tour strong. Um, I don't even know what the hell last day I talked to you where the hell I was. I don't know. I want to say I was on my way to pull in, was it Warsaw? Berlin? Yeah, Prague and then Vienna. And um, all of them would just, they were amazing or so we went there and, uh, I actually talked to Versie for his, he has a patrion page as do I. And I did a little quick half hour podcast with him. The only one of the only country that we met on this trip was in Warsaw at our hotel was a place that kind of looked like a restaurant, kind of looked like a cafe. And we went in there and we were immediately told by the waiter that it was a chocolate factory.

Speaker 1:          00:04:09       He kept saying that like, we are looking, we wanted to get something to eat and they had all this chocolate shit there, but they also had sandwiches and stuff like that. So verse, he says to him, he goes like, Hey, so uh, what would you say is your, uh, what would you recommend? What's the best thing on? And he goes, what did he say? He said, uh, chocolate to make it easy. If I could, if I could sum it up, chocolate, like a, all right, we want some sandwiches. Is, is this a good sandwich? He's like, yeah, yeah, it's good. It's good. It's like that. Right? Then he just kept having a fucking comment on everything that we were going to do after we ate. He goes, you want something else? He wants something else. And I go, AH, right. You know, maybe I'll get a hot chocolate or something.

Speaker 1:          00:04:52       Then you'd be like, you showed you have room. It's like, well, if you don't think I'm think up too full after, what the fuck I ate, why would you ask me you fucking skinny con. He was such a fucking cunt. He was such a cunt. So then I go up to, I said, you know, I'll get some hot chocolate. He goes, well, Vince Vaughn, we have, okay the [inaudible], we are a chocolate factory. It's like, no, do not a factory. You're not making the chocolate here. You stupid skinny. Can't, you know I am this upset about it was cause I kept thinking like, oh, I'm being the ugly American. Maybe I should be even nicer to this guy. And the nice dry was the more of a Canty was. And then in the end, you know, when he was such a con, Versie got mad first. He never gets mad.

Speaker 1:          00:05:32       I'll get mad at fucking net on that. Fucking Goddamn by peacock for some reason popped in my head. First is trying to think pigeon. Um, oh my God, that guy is a temper. He got mad at a peacock, um, even verse, he was upset by the end. And then when I saw him getting upset, I realized how ridiculous was that. I was getting upset. I just said, Paul, he works in a chocolate factory. We're going to go tell jokes and a fucking basketball arena in Warsaw. And uh, so then we both laughed and were like, all right buddy, take it easy, you know? And I gotta tell you though, the hot chocolate was the shit they get came over with a little trio of them. One of them, one of the hot chocolates was white. It's like white chocolate, you know, which was, which was, uh, you know, should have been my nickname when I played basketball, but I wasn't good.

Speaker 1:          00:06:19       So that kid from Sacramento got it. Then there was another one was just chocolate chocolate, and then it was coffee chocolate and I fucking hate coffee. So I gave that DePaul the white chocolate was fucking bananas. So the guy comes over and I'm still trying to be friendly and uh, I got all the hot chocolate was delicious and he's like, really? And I was like, yeah, this one here. And I pointed to the white one. That one was, it was fucking amazing. Right. I didn't say amazing. Fucking amazing. I said it was amazing. And he goes, oh, he must have a sweet tooth. Oh, sorry. Okay. All right. You know, he was like so skinny. You could have beaten him with his own body.

Speaker 3:          00:06:59       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:07:00       He was like, he was like, like a nightstick with a fucking head. Um, is, does a chocolate fan. Oh, Ben versus he went up to after his, cause he had, you know, a burger, whatever the fuck you guys can I get, just get a piece of chocolate and the guys, I guess you could just want one. You're going to get, eat it so fast. The first he's like, I just want one. You know, you know, they all over there. They fan from World War Two. They have like the, you know, the butcher of Baghdad or some shit like that, which is the Middle East. You know, we would joke and he was the kind of Warsaw, but as Conti as he was and is frustrated as I was that I couldn't find a little Polish flag. You know, that's what I do. When I go on the road, I find those, you know, those things that back in the day people would, so until like a jacket, I'm not doing that.

Speaker 1:          00:07:45       I'm going to frame him. Um, I got to have some sort of framework and open and close it where, you know, cause it's a work in progress where I'm going to go and I'm just want to keep adding to it. And uh, I couldn't get the Polish flag because I took a picture of the collage of them and put it on Instagram. A lot of people gave me shit because I didn't have the Polish flag or the German flag. I already have a German flag. I'd already been to Cologne before. That's why I didn't have that and I didn't have the Polish flag because I simply could not find a place, a souvenir place in the time allotted. I went down into the subway, the od, the bound and um, they literally had a Polish flag and they had magnets and shit, but they didn't have the other one.

Speaker 1:          00:08:26       So I'm just going to order one off the internet today, today, today, today, today. Um, so anyways, then we went out and did the show and it was in like this fucking basketball arena and which it was, it was fucking unbelievable. The tour was great, but somewhere when it, somewhere in Latvia and then Budapest, it just went to another level. Um, and then the rest of the tour, I, I, you know, I was in Budapest on stage going like, I think I would shoot a special here. And when I went to a Warsaw, we were in this little basketball arena type thing. Um, and they had a stool and that this the, you know, the seat was all fucked up and I just started making fun of it, going to come out war. So come on, you can do better than that. And they had a great sense of humor about themselves.

Speaker 1:          00:09:12       I just, you know, I dunno, it was just one of those things I riffed on the stool and just, just went from there. Then I went to Berlin, did a little shopping for the ladies in my life, you know, try to find them some sneakers and shit. And it was incredible. You went there and they had like this whole sort of like the Saks fifth avenue of Berlin in, in the middle of all that, I should post a picture. They had, um, this beautiful church that was built before the time of World War II and it was all bombed out. Like one of the spires was busted off the top of it and it was like bullet holes and everything in it and they kept it, it turns it into a store or something like that. But it was a reminder of World War Two and right next to it was this ultra modern building that they were making. It was really a really interesting and uh, I would like to go back,

Speaker 4:          00:10:00       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:10:01       there again soon. And the next time I do Germany and I go into Warsaw, as I mentioned before, that never wanted to go to Auswitch or anything like that. But now I kind of went down this rabbit hole and I was looking up all of that stuff. And as much as you don't want to go there to see that level of fucking evil, it's kind of a good thing to be reminded that, you know, an entire nation of people can be talked into some shit like that. Um, and another thing that blew my mind was when we were in Nuremberg. Um, and I know it's still want to make Germany. Yeah, this is all that it is because the food was fucking great. The people were great. But uh, there is that fascination. So they have a field there. Zeplin field, I believe it's called, and it's not led Zepplin like literally the guy who invented the Zipline, I think landed there and that's where they had those giant Nazi fucking rallies, um, way back in the day. And that place still exists. They've taken down all the pillars, but you could just walk in there and literally stand where Hitler and all those fucking lunatic stood. And um,

Speaker 1:          00:11:06       I dunno. I Dunno what the fuck it is over there. I wanna just like the beaches of normally do you just go there? It's just a beach, but it's a really like fucking emotional thing when you go there like Jesus Christ and then you see like what was stopped, how great that is. But now you see where the fuck that we've ended up. And it's just really a, you know, human beings were, were extreme where uh, you know, we're kind of like at the Jaguar in the, in the uh, or the Jaguar, however you say saying a mid eighties Jaguar, you know, it's a great fucking car, you know, it's beautiful and all of that, but it fucking breaks down all the time. It always needs to be fixed.

Speaker 1:          00:11:50       Um, and I was teasing him over in Germany about that shit. I was quick to tell them that we've, my country has done everything that you guys have done. We just fucking, it's just wasn't filmed. You know what I'm saying? Which is weird cause I go when I go over to Germany and shit, I was talking about this, how I sit there and think like, oh my God, this is like, you know, Hitler, he gave a speech here and there was a concentration camp over there. But when, you know, I'm down south, I don't think when I'm at a waffle house that maybe this would used to be a plantation and someone got fucking beaten to death. There were, they were running away from their slave man, I never think of that shit. Or this is where native Americans were and they would just sort of hanging out.

Speaker 1:          00:12:29       We fucking came in and murdered all of them. Oh, isn't this a fun podcast? Um, so anyways, after Berlin we then went down to the Czech Republic and I performed in this theater that was basically where they would have all the, the uh, the, uh, the communist rallies, you know, in communism is yet another thing that gets a bad rap. Communism gets a bell. It does work. It does Burger. It's like none of them work. None of them work because they work in theory, in theory. Hey man, everybody has the same stuff man. And everybody lives community. That works if everybody buys in, but they don't cause it's always constant, the top that want fucking more. And then there's also people who think, well, you know, if there's no reward for fucking working harder than somebody else, I'm just going to coast con. Right? And then you have capitalism a whoever's the fucking best fuck and the bad, the bad.

Speaker 1:          00:13:27       They're going to fucking the, and it's, that's not how it works. It's not how it works. Whoever's the best whatever will now be absorbed by a corporation or crushed is how it works. And um, I don't know if you think it's fucking working, you're not paying attention to our bottom line right now. This country is bankrupt and has been bankrupt since fucking 2008 as far as I can tell. And everybody's just ignoring it. I mean, Jesus Christ, Clemson won the national championship. They go to the White House and they got fucking Domino's and Wendy's and everybody's blaming Donald Trump. Like, what kind of a fucking asshole does that? And they're blaming the shutdown. It's like gay guys, we are bankrupt. Okay. This is what poor people eat. They eat fast food. All right, I'm sorry. That's a wakeup call to where the fuck we're at right now. But we are fucking bankrupt and I don't agree with a lot of shit that Trump's doing, but if that guy can somehow get us out of these fucking wars so we can begin to try and figure out how to pay him back.

Speaker 1:          00:14:37       I mean, I, I don't, I don't know. Uh, yeah, I don't get like whatever. I mean, I know what the fuck we're doing over there. Everybody knows what the fuck we're doing over there and then everybody knows what we're saying that we're doing over there and it's two completely fucking different. Um, anyways, I don't want to get on a whole fucking thing. It, cause I don't pay attention to enough of it. But it seems to me that we are fucking, we spent $1 trillion to stop 3,500 fucking jerk offs is what we're doing now on a jungle gym that don't have a planer, a fucking boat. And we'd gone bankrupt doing that in like a half a dozen corporations, made a zillion dollars off of it and continued to try and keep us over there cause they also own media. So no one is, hopefully people will begin to talk about this shit cause uh, I know this doesn't sound patriotic because now patriotism is just support the troops. I support the troops, you know, and if you don't have, you know, support the troops, get the fuck out of the country. And it's like, okay, I support the troops, but can I logically talk financially what the fuck we've done so that our kids are kids, kids are kids, kids, kids, kids, kids all the way down the line won't still be paying for this fucking thing.

Speaker 5:          00:15:47       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:15:49       And you know what? I am open to discussion here. Let's, let's fucking open this up. We got the call, we got the fucking lines open. Can Somebody please explain to me financially how we're going to get out from underneath us?

Speaker 5:          00:16:00       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:16:02       I did feel good when I was in Germany that they were going to switch to renewable energy, which I think is the solution to Middle Eastern terrorism because it seems all the oil money that they make up for oil is funneled through the mosque and then financed to these groups that we don't like that want to kill us. So if we stopped buying their oil, they count have any money and then they don't even have a jungle gym.

Speaker 1:          00:16:28       Is that, is that too? I'm sure that's too simple, but I do this a lot. I say ignorant shit and then people straighten me out. So I ask is that if you think I'm way off base and right now you're screaming at your fucking windshield, calm the fuck down and just explain to me how our space I am and I will listen. I can be swayed. I don't have confidence in my opinion. I deliver it with confidence. But in the back of my book, my head, there's, there's always that voice be a pill. You don't read, you don't read books. All right? So we went to, uh, we went to Prague and we, uh, we performed at this place where I imagined Bresch Never Gorbachev fits, spoke at. And I got such a kick out of being in there is far as like all the shit talk. And that must've been done about the United States of America. And I was Sorta refund imitating them comrade. They don't have fat over there. They have fat and they fucked her six sisters, all that shit. And then I was there telling my Dick Jokes, but that crowd was fucking unbelievable and they just rolled with everything.

Speaker 1:          00:17:34       And I gotta be honest with you, I haven't felt that much. I haven't had that much fun on fucking stage in forever because of what's going on with stand up comedy. I actually was able to get away. I kept tagging all of my jokes going and if I said that in America, my career would be over. And they all laughed. They all laughed, you know. So, once again, as I stated in my last podcast, comedians, okay, we're, you know, we need to stick up for each other. We don't need to be taking each other down about material. There's literally comedians going online tweeting about people's material and saying, maybe they shouldn't, they're there. Everybody's Comedians are turning into Al Gore's wife. You know, when she used to attack heavy metal, like I don't know what the fuck is going on, but for the love of God, shut up, use your head, cause you're chopping your own fucking head off.

Speaker 1:          00:18:28       Eventually that shit is the water's gonna rise up around your ankles and you can eventually you're going to drown in the bullshit that you're creating here. So anyways, we were over there, had a great show, we found a cigar bar, um, smoked a wonderful partake agis party guests are the fuck you say. Um, tomato, tomato. And then we went back to the hotel room and be like, can you imagine if the fucking Kansas City colts game was on? And they had this sports channel seven, they are over there and we got it and we fucking lost our minds. And it like, you know, midnight over there, we were watching the second, third and fourth quarter. No, because we watched the second half. So we kind of missed all the scoring. Um, and I would say this, I will say this, the Patriots game and the chiefs game, uh, both of those defenses that you saw, the Patriots' defense and the chief's defense, every, it's like, wow, what's going on?

Speaker 1:          00:19:22       These guys really figured something out. What you were seeing, there was two teams that were just totally out coaching the other team. They had a game plan that worked and the other team could not adjust to it. All right. The chief's defense is not as good as it looked. The Patriots' defense is not as good as it looked against the colts. That's what I took away from both of those fucking games. So, um, I'm an old school guy. I know that the game is played a different way now. Uh, when you go for two point convergence, it's with an entire fucking quarter left. Um, I know it's all about offense, but I still believe that defense wins Superbowls despite last year's Superbowl. You know, if you really look at it all, all, you know, they only needed to make one defensive play. One big defensive play was made and that changed the game. So, um, I dunno, I am definitely skeptical as to whether the Patriots or the chiefs can win the Superbowl with their defenses. Um, having said that, uh, I'm very excited for this match up the rematch and the Patriots have to go into arrowhead after already beating the Kansas city chiefs by the skin of our teeth letting up 40, 41 points. Was it 44 40 or something like that. Um, even though we them last time it was by no means impressive defensively, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:20:54       which is why, you know, we beat the chargers. Somebody wrote, had this hilarious tweet where they said, okay,

Speaker 1:          00:21:02       you know, it's the poor chargers, you know, it's so difficult to find a quarterback that can beat Tom Brady. And then they had a picture of, of Eli Manning when he first got drafted by the charges holding up the jerseys. And then of course, all these other fans rather than getting the joke that the joke was making fun of the chargers decision to get ready. Eli Manning, forget about drew Brees, um, someone's world, um, and then showed a picture of nick falls and it's like they weren't talking about the eagles and that's, that is something that does bug me though as a patriots fan that people are trying to say nick foals beat Tom Brady. He didn't, he beat the fucking Patriots' defense. All right. Cause if you look them at the Patriots, you know, Brady versus falls Brady only through, I mean foals only through for like 300 something yards breakthrough for over 500 fucking yards and lost fucking ridiculous.

Speaker 1:          00:21:57       So having said that, maybe the Patriots and the chiefs may be one of them could win that, the Superbowl. But my pick has been the fucking New Orleans saints, which I was really nervous about when they were down 14 to nothing. And I love nick false. I fucking love that guy. That guy he plays, you know, he's one of those, he's like, he liked the bigger the game is the better that guy plays and the bullshit way that that organization keeps putting him on the fucking bench. Cause they got so much money invested I guess in Carson Wentz. Not saying that that guy's bad cause he did great, but you know, a lot of people would demand a trade or something like that. He just fucking sits there and it's like, hi, when do you need me and when you do I'm going to go in and crush it. So, um, I dunno, it was kind of funny though, watching Eagle fans all patting themselves on the back about how great they are because they weren't sending death threats to that wide receiver who had the ball go through his, his hands, which is a great thing. And it was impressive that they didn't do that, but they got a little, they got a little ahead of themselves about how great they are. They kind of forget that they have the jail in their stadium.

Speaker 1:          00:23:11       They kind of forget that an entire row of eagle fans thinks nothing of beating up a father who's there with his child because he has a different jersey on or spitting on him or puking on him. Oh, throwing shit. Just, you know, take it down a little bit. Eagles fans are such assholes. They actually think they're good people for the simple fact that they didn't send it death threat. You know what you guys sound like, you sound like feminists right now. The only one you didn't do is call yourself brave. He dropped the ball and we didn't send death. Threats were so brave. We're where warriors, um, anyways, sorry to Eagle nation. Tough fucking loss. Um, I was loving what even though you were going to fuck up my pick, I was loving what you guys were doing, um, when it was 14 to nothing and um,

Speaker 5:          00:24:03       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:24:04       you know, you did defending super bowl champions and I felt you weren't getting your respect the same way. I can't say the Patriots deserve respect this year and we've taken some brutal losses, but it was in the back of my head. I was kind of hoping that the Patriots and the eagles would both make it

Speaker 5:          00:24:21       mmm.

Speaker 1:          00:24:23       To the super bowl again, just to shut all these fucking people up, but we shall see. All right. Having said that, we have to go into Arrowhead stadium, the loudest fans in the league, they don't need a stadium that is architecturally designed to make them sound louder than they really are. They are fucking loud as shit. They are so fucking sick of the Patriots. They always beat us, you know, early in the season or give us a good game. And every year it's like, this is the year it's going to be over. I told you that guy, that guy I saw on, uh, I was in that sports bar in New York City and that guy was just screaming, this is, it's all over. This is what it is now. And he was losing his shit about wanting to beat the patriots, who's a chiefs fan.

Speaker 1:          00:25:11       And he just kept yelling sporadically and then it just became nonstop yelling until he was tapped on the shoulder, ask to go. He got up peacefully, put his coat on and continued to scream at the TV right out into public. And I was just sitting there being like, wow man, that's how much people hate the Patriots. And also I've been there as you know, back when the old school patriots fans, certainly a red sox fan and a Bruins fan when we couldn't beat the Canadians and all of that shit. So I kind of knew what that guy was going for. So it's going to be a weird game where I want to see the Patriots win obviously. But if the chiefs go to the Super Bowl, uh, that'll be really, really fucking cool. I mean, they have not been there since fucking Superbowl for everybody. 67 68, 69, 1970

Speaker 5:          00:26:01       mmm.

Speaker 1:          00:26:03       64 toss power trap, right. Hank scramp way the fuck back then when they played, played the Vikings, um, super bowl for what are we up to now? Superbowl 50 something. I've even lost track and I'm a fucking nerd about this shit. So with that, oh, and the rams, the rams beat the cowboys. I missed that game. And then I miss the, uh, I missed another game.

Speaker 1:          00:26:26       I forgot what the other, no, I don't, I think I saw both AFC games. I saw parts of three of four of them. Um, but now I am back. I'm back when, you know, it's, you know what's Hilarious is, uh, I have a birthday party you have to go to for a very special in my own daughter coming up this week. So I'm going to be missing some of the playoffs because old daddy makes the, I make a birthday cake from scratch every year. That's what I'm going to do. And I get, I got to do that. You know, you got to do shit like that. Um, anyways. All right. So

Speaker 4:          00:26:59       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:26:59       I took a bunch of Saunas when I was over there in Europe and uh, oh, I didn't even talk about the cities by the way. And even talking about Vienna, then I go to Vienna in Vienna, had like this incredible fucking theater and this club owner to the club owners.

Speaker 4:          00:27:14       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:27:14       They were just the nicest people ever. And they were feeding us like an Italian grandmother, like I even know what that is. The way verse he always described, it just would not say no, just kept bringing out, you know, Vino Schnitzel, Lynn and, and then all these desserts, you know, I love all desserts over there is like a tray of cheese or like something sugary and it was just,

Speaker 4:          00:27:38       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:27:38       it was unbelievable. I think I consumed like 3000 calories, but it's European calories, so it's not like the poison over here. So I woke up the next day being like, how am I not fatter? Oh, that's right. I got out from under my own food supply, so I want to thank them too. Um, Prague, I gotta tell you, Prague and Budapest, a lot of American sleep on those cities. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:28:02       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:28:02       Absolutely gorgeous. Like I would say even Prague is like the Paris of the Midwest of Europe. As far as my little, you know, I didn't get to see too much of it, but just,

Speaker 4:          00:28:12       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:28:13       You know, driving from the airport and looking at it, it was like both of those cities were a, were breathtaking. And, um,

Speaker 4:          00:28:21       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:28:21       All right. My stupid computer keeps shutting down here. Um, anyways.

Speaker 4:          00:28:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:28:28       I watched the rest of pappy onto the original one when I came back, when I flew back, man, that was fucking incredible. And then I watched this two hour documentary, which I forget what it was called,

Speaker 4:          00:28:40       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:28:40       About the crossfit championships.

Speaker 4:          00:28:43       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:28:43       And it mainly focused on the women and stuff like that. And uh, you know what, like I said earlier where I could be wrong about our, our uh,

Speaker 4:          00:28:52       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:28:53       our foreign policy. I think I was wrong about crossfit. I'm watching what those people were able to do physically, but as an old man watching it, I'm just going like, I don't know how long these people's bodies are going to last doing that. Um, all of those fucking squats and all of that shit with you, Charlotte was all I was thinking. Knees and shoulders, knees and shoulders, you need those for the rest of your life. However, I think stem cell research is going to get to the point where everyone's, you know, all their religious shit is going to go by the wayside to just have the fucking knees and shoulders of an 18 year old when you're 60. Um, I'm telling you right now, there is going to be some fucking jacked older people in the future. I got a buddy of mine, he had a torn rotator cuff and he got that shit injected in there and he doesn't even have scar tissue. It's fucking crazy. Um, do I sound like a crazy person right now I'm talking about foreign policy and fucking stem cell research lab. This is, this is all jet lag, Billy. He's all over the fucking map. Um, all right, let me do a couple of reads and then I'm going to tell you what it was like to take a sauna in Germany.

Speaker 1:          00:30:03       All right. Um, okay. Butcher box. A butcher blocks delivers healthy 100% grass fed, grass finished beef, free range, orange chicken and the, the, the the top shelf heritage bread. Pork. All right, this is pure bred pigs that you can trace the bloodline back to Europe. All right. Fucking Rudolf Hess. What an eighth is fucking poor. The incredible quality of butcher box. I, you know, I did Rudel I didn't know that Rudolph has, he left before all the evil, evil shit went down. He was there for the beginning of the evil, like the game plan of it. But before the final solution was, was even put into place, he fucking got on a plane and left. They went to Scotland and there's all this shit about whether Hitler knew he was going to do it or if he deserted. He went up there and tried to make peace with England. It, Winston Churchill was like, no, and not making peace. Go Fuck yourself and arrest this cunt. And then he spent the rest of his life in jail and then killed himself allegedly at 93 where some people thought that he was, uh, he was strangled. You know, there's always people being or whatever. But anyways, one of the great quotes of all time when Rudolph has got an a plane and flew up to Scotland in the middle of the war to try and make peace. Hitler's close quote about Rudolf Hess was, that guy's insane.

Speaker 5:          00:31:39       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:31:40       I mean, that's just one of the greatest fucking quotes ever. Adolf Hitler called somebody insane. That goes back to when I first started in this business. It was right around the time when my favorite drummers of all time, Steven Adler got kicked out of guns and roses and their thing was, yeah, he's doing too many drugs and every comic had the joke. How many? How much drugs are you doing that the other members that guns and roses go, yeah, we got to get rid of this guy. He's partying too much. That was, you know that that was the guns and roses version of when Hitler said, Hey, Rudolph has is insane. All right. All right. Back to butcher box, everybody. The incredible quality of butcher box meets starts with the commitment to start with the commitments are raising animals humanely and free of antibiotics and hormones before they killed him. Cook with Pete, the peace of mind, of knowing you're eating healthy, high quality meat. Each box comes with at least eight to 11 pounds of meat, which is for 24 individual size meals. If you have the discipline, you know, if you eat like that guy in seven who ended up face down in his spaghetti o's, I mean you're going to, you're going to go through that shit in a week. Um, you can choose from five different box types. All beef, beef and chicken, beef and pork mixed box, a custom box which lets you choose your own cuts. Uh, my favorite box cut is I'm supposed to say, I would say I'd have to go beef and pork or maybe I go mix box

Speaker 1:          00:33:16       by like custom box too. You know, I like a custom car. I Dunno.

Speaker 4:          00:33:20       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:33:20       I dunno because they just keep sending me the shit for free cause they're liking the way I'm reading this stuff. Anyways. Oh now we're announcing our new brand of protein, what they find a new animal, a wild Alaskan Salmon, butcher box sources, sources. They're pure, sustainably harvested salmon from Bristol Bay, Alaska. Unlike any salmon you'll find in your local store, literally is, it's red color means that this salmon is as fresh and nutrient rich as it gets. For $20 off your first box in two pounds of free salmon, go to butcher box.com/burn enter bur bur that's butcher box.com enter burr and introvert. Sorry. You know what's funny? I got, I got so sick of, I'm watching comedians attacking other comedians on Twitter and, and people screaming about Trump that I, I found somehow I find this place where you could like maybe follow some different things on Twitter. So I decided to go into the science world.

Speaker 4:          00:34:19       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:34:19       Like this will fascinate me. I'm such a poor science background. Let me fucking read up on this shit. Right? And all they did was talk about how we're destroying the environment. And it was even more depressing than listen to fucking morons yelling about politics as I on this politics. Politics on this podcast gave you my solution for solving the Middle East problems. I mean, how Hypocritical Ama. So anyways, I went on there and I found out some snail, just the last one they called him. George out in Hawaii has now died.

Speaker 4:          00:34:49       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:34:49       And uh, evidently those things are going to go extinct.

All right, before I do the reads this week, um, I took a sauna when I was in, uh, Germany and evidently they, I heard that they were naked. They go into those saunas naked and it's coed. So I asked for Z if he wanted to go down to the sign and he said yes. And then I texted him, he must've fell asleep. So I said, fuck. I went down, I worked out, got a great workout in, and then I went to go into the sun and there was nobody in there. And the old me, I like the steam. Now I really liked the dry sauna because it can get way hotter. You know, Joe Rogan converted me, right? So I go in there and I went in there like an American, I have my slippers on, I had my towel on and all of that shit.

Speaker 1:          00:36:34       And then all of a sudden this dude comes walking in, he has a towel on. I'm like, oh, thank God, thank God it's Berlin. Okay, it's brilliant. Okay, this is like they're in New York City so everybody is going to act accordingly. And then he just immediately takes his towel off and I'm like, what the fuck? So then he lays and then lays down. And what he did was he put his outside leg, the leg close to me, he put it up. So he was sort of covering his junk, slashed, looked like he was getting ready to do, recreate the Burt Reynolds playgirls center full. Right. So anyways, and I know this is going to be the fucking Photoshop. So I'm sitting there like, yeah, what the fuck? All right. Whatever one they could do it. Who gives a shit? Right? And then all of a sudden another guy comes in and this guy comes in, he does, he have his towel on.

Speaker 1:          00:37:20       He's just holding his towel in front of his junk. Then he goes in like it was shaped like a horse shoe, you know like the old fucking a Denver Bronco Stadium back in the day. So I'm on one side of the horse shoe. I'm on like the visitor's side. The first naked dude is on the fucking home site and then this naked guy comes in and he lays down the same way. Same playgirl fucking thing with the outside leg up. He's sitting in the end zone seats. All right. And I'm like Jesus fucking Christ. So now I'm laughing cause all I'm thinking is I to tell versus he cause at this point it's just naked guys and just naked guys. It's just funny. I used to put in my act, a naked man is either funny or scary, right? If you're at a football game and a naked guy jumps out of the crowd and runs across the field, you're laughing your ass off.

Speaker 1:          00:38:09       If you're walking home late at night, then naked guy jumps out of the fucking bushes. It's one of the scariest things ever. So this was just funny. I'm in a gym, there's all kinds of people around or whatever, even though it's just the three of us in there. But you know, I can just get up, walk out the fucking door. There's no danger here. There's two naked guys. It's fucking hilarious. So I'm looking down at the floor and all I'm thinking about as, I can't wait to tell version of this fucking story. They both lay in here and like fucking twin Burt Reynolds and sitting here with my slippers on and my towel, I don't know. So anyways, and then all of a sudden the door opens again and now a woman comes walking in and I'm looking, I kind of look at the guys like, are they going to cover themselves up? And they don't. And then she comes in and just takes her fucking towel off.

Speaker 4:          00:38:55       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:38:57       Oh, just like what the fuck? And then she sits down in the end zone seats. All right, so above her and the upper deck is this naked guy to her left as the other naked guy. She's naked and now, and she looks over at me and I got a towel on his slippers. So now I'm looking like the Weirdo. Now I'm the fucking pervert. Like, look, did this fucking guy, we're all getting naked while you sitting over there. Right? So now I'm like, well, I gotta get the Fuck Outta here. And just as I said that the dude in the home seat, he stands up and he's going to walk out and I'm like, all right, perfect. Now he's going to use the shower. I'm just going to wait till he's done with the shower, then I'm going to fucking walk out. So that's exactly what happens.

Speaker 1:          00:39:38       I walk out, but when I walk out, what I forgot to mention was they had like, you know, those ice baths that like NFL players go to get into, um, bad, something like that. But there wasn't ice. It was just like, uh, it was a tank. You climbed up like six steps and then climb down into this thing and it was freezing fucking cold right after the sauna. Right. And just closes up all your pores. It gets rid of all the fucking toxins and all of that. All the shit washes off you. Granted everybody else is using it. So it's probably fucking gross on some level. I have no idea. Maybe because it's so cold, it kills the shit. I don't know what. So I wanted to use it, but there was no way I was gonna use it because I had to get up to the top of it and take my towel off, would be standing up there with my fucking man who had twisted in the breeze before I went down into the fucking Arctic water.

Speaker 1:          00:40:24       But when I came out there was nobody there. So I was like, I gotta, I gotta try it. So I fucking scampered up the ladder quickly, took my towel off and then went down into it and I was like, fuck. It was freezing cold when all the way up to like my neck and wanted to stay there for a minute, but probably only stayed there for like 15 seconds. It was enough for me. But plus also I knew other people were going to come in and I didn't want to come crawling out of there completely naked, like fucking Jason Alexander now with my fucking junk all pulled up into me. Right.

Speaker 4:          00:40:57       Okay. Oh

Speaker 1:          00:40:59       the other dude's in the shower. I could hear him. So now I go to get out of this fucking thing. I get my towel on and everything and I feel fucking amazing to go from that heat to that call. Now I'm going to go into the shower. It was fucking amazing. So again, out of the shower now all I want to do is tell Versie the fucking story. It'd be like, dude, even a chick came in, this is fucking nuts. And I reached into my robe and I can't find my key to my locker and like where the fuck is it? Drop it with a foot and I'm looking all around and I was in last time I remembered having it. I was holding it in my hand when I was in the sauna because I didn't want to leave it in the pocket of my robe for some reason, I didn't see like the band that you could put it around your wrist. I just didn't, you know, I'm an idiot. And I saw, I was just holding onto it and I suddenly realized that it was still in the fucking sauna.

Speaker 2:          00:41:49       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:41:50       So now I have to go back into the sauna. So I go back in there with my head down with my fucking slippers on and my towel on and I go back in there and the naked woman is now laying down sideways facing the door. Okay. Laying down where I was sitting and I'm like, I can't go over there with my towel and be like, Hey, I'm just looking for my keys. All right there sweetheart. Right. It felt like a fucking Weirdo. So now I sat down, she's sitting on the fucking visitor's side. Now I'm on the home side or whatever. I might have fucked up these things you don't want. I mean I'm sitting on the opposite side that I was sitting on and I'm just sitting there going, all right, well she was, she's been in here for like 10 minutes. She's going to fucking leave soon. And when she does, I'm going to look for my keys and she just won't leave. She won't leave.

Speaker 2:          00:42:47       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:42:48       And then finally I just have to get up cause I'm dying cause this is my second trip. And then I find when I say I'm sorry, I think I left my key over here and she's like, Oh I didn't see it. And she's like sitting up like fucking naked. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:43:00       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:43:01       So now I go back over and I just fucking sit down. No, I fucked up the story.

Speaker 2:          00:43:06       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:43:06       I'm sitting down there going, what the fuck do I do now because I'm dying to heat. And then all of a sudden this couple comes walking in and then they both get naked. Now there's two naked women are naked dude. And then me all covered up. And at this point now I feel like a fucking Weirdo Joe. I'm like, well fuck it. I'm a Germany. So now I take my towel off and I'm just sitting there cracking up, fucking laughing. Like, you know that you, he just looked down and you just, you know what it's like, I'm gonna laugh my ass off, but nobody's going to know. So you don't make a sound and you don't change your face, you just have your mouth open and you just kind of go, like, I was literally doing that while I was so fucking hot. I could feel my heartbeat in my ears.

Speaker 2:          00:43:54       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:43:54       So at some point it just got so hot and she wasn't leaving and it, she was like a pro. So I finally just got up and I just sort of had my towel cover myself and go, I'm sorry. I think I left my cue over. And she goes, oh, I did not see it. The BOBA.

Speaker 2:          00:44:06       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:44:06       And I go, all right. So then I went back and I sat down. That's what I did. That's when I sat down and then she got up and I was like, still going to go. It's gotta be underneath or something. So I waited for her to leave. I toughed it out and then I walk over there and I'm feeling around on the fucking seats and shit and it's just not there. And they have the slats and I'm like, it probably fell down in between it. Now I'm going to have to walk out with just my and robot, go back to the front desk, pay the fee, and all of this shit. So now I walk out of the Sauna. I'm fucking almost passing out and to my left and my peripheral, I see that woman again naked at the top of the fucking ladder to go into the ice bath.

Speaker 1:          00:44:47       I'm like, Jesus fucking Christ. I gotta get Outta here. Right? And as I'm walking away, you know [inaudible] I hear her yelling over to somebody and I'm like, I know she's not talking to me. And then she just goes, then she switches to English and she goes, did you find your key? And I kind of have turned but didn't look at it and I go, no, no, I didn't. And then she goes, is this it? And I realized I had bets where I left it. When I scampered up the ladder to go there, I left it at the top of the iceberg. I go, Oh yeah it is. And then she stays at the top of the ladder and just, you know, kinda hands. And I walk over and literally her vagina is above me and I kind of reached up, like looking but not looking dog has shade.

Speaker 1:          00:45:42       And that was so fucked up. I didn't even take a shower and I just walked out and I went to the locker room and I went in there and I was like pouring sweat and everyone was looking at me like, well divided these shower off. He's all red, like the tomato. Um, anyways. And then I just, I put my shit back on and that, and that. There you go. That's my German Sana story. But I have, I got to, I do have to tell you this though. If you're completely naked in a sauna, it's even better. It is even better. It's fucking weird. But you only can do it in a place. If everybody's naked, then it isn't weird. It isn't weird. And, uh, if you're worried that you're going to get a stiffy cause there's a naked woman in there. There's also no other naked men in there.

Speaker 1:          00:46:25       So it neutralizes it. Not to mention it's hot as shit. Like I don't think anybody has ever fucked in one of those hot naked, uh, you know, the, that naked, the hot yoga class, what do they call that? The Bikram Yoga. Like you can barely survive. Fucking somebody is the last thing on your mind when you're sitting at like 180 degree heat. But, uh, anyways, bears my, um, that was my, a story. It was hilarious. I was worried that my junk was going to look too small when I got into the ice bath and I was worried that I was going to fucking salute the Germans when I was in the sauna. I would, you know, for naked woman walked in, but it didn't, I just felt like a fucking creep. Um, so anyways, and that's why you travel the world every body.

Speaker 3:          00:47:10       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:47:10       To get stories like that. All right. Anyways, all right, follow up. Should girl have paid for dinner? Now this became something on reddit where I was reading this thing where, uh, this guy, the way I read it in the way I understood it, now granted I was jet lagged flying around Europe. I thought he was saying that he took his girlfriend out for a birthday dinner with his parents and when the bill came she had to pay for her meal. So she was upset about that. And then now he invited to another family gathering and she made some flippant comment asking him she'd have to pay for the gas to get there. And I sided with her going through it. You can't make somebody pay for their birthday meal. So anyways, somebody had read it, said Billy got a little confused with that email about the birthday dinner.

Speaker 1:          00:48:05       The boyfriend's family weren't expecting the girlfriend to pay for her own birthday dinner. They were expecting her to pay for our own meal at his birthday dinner. Oh, okay. The email said this, I think he was just a little bit too jet lagged. All right, well my mistake, um, it's a little spoiled for her to get that dinner and instantly expect to go to that dinner and instantly expect her meal be paid for. I wouldn't really say I come from a family of means, but we're not broke. And when I've gone out for dinner for my birthday, my folks have always been happy to pay. However, my partner never just assume this. It's rude to, I agree with that. But having said that, I would also pay, I wouldn't make my girlfriend pay for the meal. Um, even if you seek, if you're secretly hoping someone else pays through meal when it's not a special occasion celebrating something for you, just don't sit there and assume a, the text message asking if she expected to pay for own gas is astounding in its level of rudeness to, I don't think that that's rude because I think that's, that's her reacting to being upset that, um,

Speaker 1:          00:49:18       she was made to pay for her own meal. Uh, yeah. And then I actually see the boyfriend's point, if that's exactly, if that's how it was worded. I mean, I can just, I understand why she assumed that they would have taken care of both of them. Cause it was his birthday. It was a special occasion and she's also a guest. She's company, you know what I mean? I understand that. That makes sense to me. Um, so I, I actually, I still side with the, uh, with the woman on this one. I kind of get it. Like if my parents didn't pick up for my wife's meal, I would have paid for it.

Speaker 1:          00:49:54       I Dunno. Anyways. Um, anyways, it's not, it's not remotely spoiled for the girl to assume that the meal was paid for. I'm on her side 100% I cannot remember a single time growing up where I was invited out to dinner with a friend's family and I was expected to pay for my own meal. Yeah. It's one of those things if you're going out as a couple, like two couples are going out, then you split it anyways. Now that I am an adult with kids of my own, I would be incredibly embarrassed to ask my son's girlfriend to pay for own meal at his birthday. I am a, I agree with that 100% now the text message was passive aggressive, but I think the meal thing and the boyfriend's reaction to it was so egregious that I don't have a problem with it. I don't either.

Speaker 1:          00:50:38       I don't either. I side with them to anyways and another one, I'm sorry. Supposed to say any way. I like saying anyways, I used the ways app. Why can't I say anyways? I can not believe anyone doesn't have the same answer as you. Haha Jesus Christ. Where did these animals grow up? I would die of embarrassment if I was at a restaurant, my with my family and my girlfriend and my girlfriend and my dad asked her for money. Yeah, I agree with you. You know, I just think that maybe were braver, maybe were the warriors social justice warriors. Hey, you know what's great about doing this podcast this early is my daughter's not gonna be up for like another hour. And so, um, I get to hang all morning with her. I bought her all these cool sneakers when I was over there. Um, she's like good until she's like three or four years old because I got the size wrong, the size I was told to get.

Speaker 1:          00:51:28       I thought when she was that size now and it turns out that that was, you know, the next size up. So I got two sizes in, three sizes up, but they're all cool sneakers. Well Thea, all cool sneak attack got when I was told three in Germany, a jet lag. Hey Billy, numb nuts. Um, try Valerian tea to help reset your sleep cycle while traveling. It also helps take the edge off at the end of the day when the whiskey blanky is not an option. B L A N K Y is not an option. Works for me. Uh, I will definitely do that because I'm 52 days in and not drinking. And um, had I not done that thrash, I would actually look good. People were taking pictures of me. I was like, I look fucking horrible. Like just lack of sleep. That's all we did for 10 days straight. Fly in, go to the hotel, go do a show or to go back to the hotel, sleep, try to go to sleep and then you'd have to get up at seven to take a train or something like that.

Speaker 1:          00:52:35       And um, the younger me, I would have looked fresh as a daisy if I wasn't drinking, but I was looking at those pictures. I was like, I might as well have been doing fucking meth out here. Um, I will try that. I actually got some Melatonin when I was over there that everybody says is all natural, but I got to tell you, it makes you feel a little buzzed. Um, I dunno. I Dunno about that Shit, but it definitely helped me go to sleep. I'm fat fellow speaking here. Uh, hello, Mr. Bend, Bender, ovary bender over bill. I don't know what that means. I am 19 years old. Five seven on a good day in 320 pounds. All right, dude, you got to do something about that. Thank God you got a young heart, but you, you will not be five, seven, you know, in your sixties at 320 pounds.

Speaker 1:          00:53:25       And I'm, I'm not a doctor and I know this is a fact. Anyways, I just wanted to ask you, as a heavy fellow who tries very hard to be kind and courteous to those around him, how can I be better? I purposely avoid planes in public transportation because I understand how uncomfortable it must be for others to even be around me. It is very difficult because I have an irrational fear of driving and there are no taxi or Uber services in my area. Um, I legitimately tried to keep to myself, for example, in a grocery store, if I have to pass someone who is shopping, I apologize simply because I block half the aisle. Most of the time folks are very kind and shore missed the bar. How can I be better to other folks who are less girthy. Thank you for your time. Um, what I got out of that service, I think that you need to come out of your shell and I probably maybe go get some therapy and maybe part of your reason for eating and all of that type of stuff. Is there a, that seems to be a little bit of self loathing going on here and God knows I was the king of that. It just didn't manifest itself into overeating. It manifested itself in the other shit that I've, I've, I'm still trying to work out. But, um,

Speaker 1:          00:54:44       maybe if you start going to therapy, you start reading up on nutrition and a, I got to tell you, dude, if you five, seven, 320 pounds, like, I mean, I would think that you'd be able to drop a lot of weight if he just started eating right, because you obviously don't need all of that on you. Um, and then I think as, as you learn about yourself in therapy and then she started to drop weight, um,

Speaker 1:          00:55:12       you're going to come out of your shelf because you're not going to have to have those feelings that you're being, you know, you're just like a sensitive person. The fact that you actually care, it's, you have ear, an empathetic person. And a lot of times people who are really empathetic can get in their heads and can get really, like, I just think, you know, I feel like that made me sad reading that. So I don't want you walking around being sad. You're in the prime of your life. Like, and what's great is the fact that you've five, seven, 320 pounds, you have a great before picture. All right, so you got that checked off your bucket list. Now you can, you can turn this whole fucking thing around and you're so young that you, you got your whole life ahead of, you can just turn that around and find out.

Speaker 1:          00:55:56       I would literally go to therapy and just put it all out on the fucking table. You know what you feel your problem is, what you're afraid of, what makes you cry and all of that Shit. And then I would, I would just start literally marching towards getting in shape. It'll help your fucking confidence. And then what's great is, is when you become a good looking guy that's out there, fucking slammed it. And the ladies are loving you. You know, you've had the experience of being five, seven, three 20 so you won't be a fucking asshole. I remember one time, I was on a plane a long, long, long fucking time ago, like 15 years ago. And I was sitting next to this woman who was a fucking knock out, an absolute knock out. And I sat down next to her and she was just like, hey, how you doing?

Speaker 1:          00:56:43       And I was like, good. I, you know, women who looked that good don't, aren't like that, you know, and it's not just because you know, this stuck up. It's because when they're that good looking, if they even remotely make eye contact with another man, they're now going to have to deal with them hitting on them, you know, so she was totally open with so fucking cool and we're just shooting the shit. She was talking to me like she was like a widget salesman instead of like a fucking 10. And then the end, I finally had a Segway, I'm going to be honest with you, I've never, I've never been around a woman as good looking as you, that was like this outgoing had your personality, your personality is amazing. And she laughed. She Cause Ah, she goes, I used to be fat, so I'm sure you already, you already got the personality.

Speaker 1:          00:57:28       So, um, you know what you are you like a great barn. Find in a, in like the automotive industry. I'm not calling you a fucking cow. I'm saying like, you know, when they go into Barnes, they'll find this great old car that they then restore and everybody fucking loves it. So there you go. We're still yourself, sir. That's what I would do. And uh, and I believe in you. I think he can do it. She's just put your mind to it. But I think you just got to figure out why you're uh, you know why you are the way you are. Because I know just being courteous and empathetic isn't all you who you are. You've got shit to say. You got hope. She got dreams you want to find love. So let's go. Let's get after it. Get your ass out there. All right, girlfriend won't lose weight.

Speaker 1:          00:58:14       It's all about weight. This, uh, this week here, dear Billy, not so fat. Thank you. I'll take that. That's exactly what I am. I'm not so fat, but I definitely had a little too much English did. So, yeah. Uh, my girlfriend and I had been dating for three years going on four and I'm starting to have different feelings towards her because of her eating habits and the way she takes care of herself. Since I met her several years ago, she kind of had a weight thing that was noticeable. You know what, I just fucking flaked reading this. I gotta start over again. I was just thinking how amazing it is that Joe Rogan has Mike Tyson on his podcast. Um, and I remember being on his podcast early on where it was just in his house and how far he's come with that podcast is fucking amazing. I'm sorry, I don't know why I was thinking of that.

Speaker 1:          00:59:04       Anyways, dear Billy, not so fat. My girlfriend and I have been dating for three years going on four and I'm starting to have different feelings towards her because of her eating habits and the way she takes care of herself. Um, yeah, that isn't fair to do to somebody, you know. Um, and I think it's when the guy puts on way then if a woman comes on TV and was to talk about that type of stuff, they would side with her for expressing herself. But if a guy does it, you're a fucking asshole. Um, anyways, since I met her several years, that's your job, man. You got to keep yourself looking good. You got to keep the spark going in 50% of that is your responsibility. Um, since I met her several years ago, she had, she came, she had kind of had a weight thing that was noticeable, but then think anything of it because I thought she would get on some sort of kick of wanting to lose some weight in the years to come. I thought you were gonna say, I didn't mind because she was only a little overweight and I liked her as a person.

Speaker 5:          01:00:05       You're like, wow, you know,

Speaker 1:          01:00:06       I'll get her on the treadmill. You, we got some potential here. And what's funny is that's how women look at men differently. All right, he's got this job, you know, maybe you'll get to this job will start making that kind of money. I'll get him some new clothes. I can work with this. I can fix him up. And there's nothing wrong with that, you know, there's nothing wrong. You know, I used to, when I was younger, it used to bother me, but it doesn't bother me that, uh, a woman asked the guy what he does for living. It's like, what is she supposed to do? Breed with a loser. Okay. Why don't you like me for who I am? Uh, you know, cause I don't want to live in a shack. All right, well, it's been three and a half years and there's no stopping her from losing weight. She's 25 and I'm 30 and I don't know what to do. She loves to sweets and is not a fan of running because it hurts her feet. Oh boy. We'll get her on an elliptical.

Speaker 5:          01:01:00       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:01:01       Oh hell bill help bill. I love her, but I don't want to spend my early thirties miserable in a relationship with someone who doesn't want to take care of herself. Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. I have to tell you something right now, Dude. You are in the most difficult fucking position you can possibly be. And as a man, one of the hardest fucking conversations you can have with a girlfriend other than I'm breaking up with you, is I, this is even harder because if you break it up with them, they're going to cry and then you're not gonna see him again. Eventually they're going to move on. You're going to try to stay in a relationship. Are you going to try to tell a woman,

Speaker 5:          01:01:39       okay,

Speaker 1:          01:01:40       that she needs to lose weight?

Speaker 5:          01:01:42       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:01:45       I gotta be honest with you. I'm an, you know what? I'm going to bring the lovely Nia on my next podcast and we're going to, we're going to revisit this question because,

Speaker 5:          01:01:56       okay,

Speaker 1:          01:01:57       I don't know how to do this because

Speaker 5:          01:02:01       you know,

Speaker 1:          01:02:03       I've been, I've been lucky enough that I've always been with women that like they, you know, they want to go out and get after it or whatever, you know, hit the gym or whatever. Um,

Speaker 5:          01:02:15       yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:02:15       I don't know. I don't, I wouldn't know how to do this because this is, this is so fucking fragile. This is literally, if you start talking about a woman's weight is in the same world as if she started talking about your Dick size or your ability to satisfy her in the bed because you're really talking now like a woman won't, some of them, their biggest power of ridiculous power a woman has is her beauty. You know, I know they're all out there right now trying to act like they're going to start their own fucking airline and all of that shit. I'm not saying don't go do that, but like you know, that is if you, if you're basically saying that you're not attracted to them, it's, you know, if, if my wife came at me and said, hey man, you're getting a little bit fat, I would fucking laugh and it would so fucking motivate me.

Speaker 1:          01:03:08       And to the point, I wish she would say it to me cause I want to tape a special soon. Uh, but I got to go with self motivation here of taking of all the tweets. I'm going to get it from a fat fuck am my special. But um, yeah, this is a really difficult thing. Um, don't have the conversation. It's all Nia comes on. And even after what Nia says, I would also try to get advice from women in your life and you have to start it with, I love my girlfriend, I love it to death. We just have a problem and I don't know how to bring it up. Okay. If you do that, the woman you're talking to will be more open minded, I think to listen to you. However, if you start with my girlfriends fat and I'm not attracted to it, what the fuck they, they might get defensive and start defending her and say that you're shallow.

Speaker 1:          01:03:59       They, that's certainly going to happen on the Internet. Um, so whatever. Good luck with that and I'll try to help you out on Thursday. Uh, thinking about breaking up with my girlfriend. Okay, here we go. Dear Billy, not so fat. Look at this shit. I got a couple of those, right. Wait a second. All this is the same fucking person dear. Uh, my girlfriend and I had been dating for three. Wait, did I just say one is to, this guy's brilliant girlfriend won't lose weight. And now thinking about breaking up with my girlfriends from the exact same guy there, Billy not so fat. My girlfriend and I had been dating for three years and going on foreign and starting to have different feelings towards this is the exact same fucking, I was fucking hilarious. Wait a second. Is it? It has to be, it's written a little bit different. I'll still read it. Uh, since I've met her several years ago. She's Kinda had a weight thing that that was noticeable, but I didn't think anything of it because I thought she would get on some sort of check of wanting to lose the way the, as the, it's been three and a half years. There's no sign lose, lose weight. She's 25 and 30. It's exact same fucking guy. Alright. Okay Dude. Well then what I did that's fucking brilliant. Fucking brilliant. Um, I would say this.

Speaker 2:          01:05:19       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:05:20       you have to make the decision right now.

Speaker 2:          01:05:24       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:05:24       Um, do you love your girlfriend in a way that you want to stay with her eventually marry her and help her through this problem or did you sort of sort of thought, you found I'm going to marry you love but just sort of found love, love and now that she's overweight and you're not as attracted to her, is that feeling starting to come up? You know what I mean? Cause that really is, that's when you find out if you really love somebody, anybody can be around during the good times. Right? You're a man, you're making a bunch of money. You can take her to fucking, you know, France or whatever, you know, she's a chick and she's fucking, you know, go into crossfit and crushing it and fucking look hot that you ignore, you know? But when, when shit hits the fan, okay, and you have to be there for somebody emotionally or what are, you have to accept some of their flaws.

Speaker 1:          01:06:34       Uh, that's when you find out if you love, love somebody. You know what I mean? I'm not saying that you don't think about leaving. Everybody thinks about leaving all the fucking time. I don't need this fucking Shit fucking shit. You're fucking and everything and I'll fucking get it. You know? I know. I love my wife to death is, even in my fantasies when I'm mad is I can possibly be at her even in my fantasies. I can't break up with her. I get to the point where she starts walking out of the house and then I get sad and I run out and hug her.

Speaker 1:          01:07:04       So there you go. Okay. So there's a good question for you and your fantasy. Can you break up with somebody and you feel all right about now that isn't a good litmus test because then I'm doing the arrogant thing that you're, you're wired exactly the way that I am. Um, anyways, uh, any way I am, I am back from Europe. I have to tell you, that was one of the greatest experiences I've ever had as somebody in this business, the business of show, you know, trying to figure out those crowds. Trying to remember how the vibe I had the last time I was over there and it took me a few shows have hit or misses to figure out, to find tune the thing like a fucking race car. And I watched Versie do it too. And I'm at, I'm going to call this right now with Paul Versey, that fucking guy after that set I saw him do at Gotham and then watching him going over to Europe, nervous saying to me, Gone Bell, I know I'm probably going to take a couple of fucking hits over here and I'm going, no, you're not, dude. You're going to be fine. You're gonna be fine. Knowing that he was that kind of watching him figure it out to the point that by the time we went to Vienna, the people booking it there, we're, we need to have you back. We need to have you come back here. Um, I'm just really proud of him because I always knew that he was going to be able to do shit like that and his specials crushing it, and he's got a big tour coming up and I'm going to lose him as an opener.

Speaker 1:          01:08:32       Um, which is I, which is what I want for anybody who ever opens for me. You know what I mean? I never want to have a lifer opener, you know? That's like having the kid that never moved out of your house. It's like, son, get out there and find love. Um, all right. That is it. God bless all you go fuck yourselves. And I'll check in on you on Thursday. Hey. Oh, by the way, I think I'm doing a podcast with that. That guy there I was telling you about that he comes across like an old school, uh, it old school, a sports announcer, like a Dick shap kind of guy way back. You know it's going to, you'd be like the best, the base, the best patriots coverage in the business. He actually DMD me, so I started following him. They William?

Speaker 2:          01:09:23       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:09:24       Bended. B And d. E. T. S. O. N. A. Where the fuck are we going to be?

Speaker 1:          01:09:32       Oh, I told them sometime around January 15th. I was going to do it. What's today? Today's the 14th. All right. I got to reach out to this guy. We're going to do a podcast talking patriots and I'll get, I'll send out a link and all that type of stuff. Uh, hopefully, uh, because this guy seems like he really knows the Patriots. I don't, on the other hand, I, I'm, I'm, uh, I'm, uh, I watch as much as I can watch with the travel and the kid. All right. Anyways, go fuck yourselves. I'll check in on you on Thursday. See Ya.
