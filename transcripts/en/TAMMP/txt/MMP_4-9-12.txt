Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burr and it's the Monday morning podcast. Ooh, Hyundai April 9th, 2012. Um, and uh, we're gonna do some, a little different this week rather than me just sitting here in my pajamas ranting, ranting and raving. I decided that I would get closed this week and have a friend of mine come by. The one and only dom. I rera everybody. Thank you everybody. Do you mind if I get undressed? Huh? I would feel more comfortable. I like in the nude, in the news, in the nude, in the nude. You know, I think it's very fitting that I'm, I'm with a Daigo bastard. Like Ewan was sitting here drinking the Vino. Hey, not for nothing. You mic brick, but let me tell you something that is funny. Is it that I bring red wine over with a little class little you're doing. I was embarrassed that I only had a one, a red wine glass and the fact that the only thing I've had here is stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:00:55       Stuff I brought over. And you had a delicious Sushi dinner. I've done. Okay. Let me tell delicious. I thought I thought I told Don to come here at seven 30 so me and Nia ordered some Sushi and evidently I said seven and this guy's Johnny on the spot. Seven o'clock, right? As a structures in the professional. I didn't think I delivered it, didn't I? I know. And then you showed up. The only thing I could offer you is the fucking wine that you brought. Do you want some the at a mommy with your one and you said to me, well listen, let's quit fucking around here. All right, let's get serious comedy. No. Yeah, let's sit down. I want to know about your process when you sit down, Tom, when we're going to talk about comedy here, talking to about my instrument, tune my instrument.

Speaker 1:          00:01:38       We're going to talk about two comedians were going to sit here for an hour and talk about the logistics. Is that the right word? You can use that word. When you put the pen to the paper. Did you see the, you get a little heavy now bill, but you see the masters today? I did. And, uh, were you happy that Bubba Bubba Watson won it? You know, I like seeing different people with it's thing that's amazing to me is the nerves it takes when you know, a friend of mine is a scratch Golfer, he goes, the one guy goes, why don't you turn pro? Because you have no idea. The difference between me being alone out on a course, you know, hitting his 70 when the compared to millions of people looking at you. Yeah. You know what always blows my mind at those, those, those PGA things is when those guys go to tee off and they hit it like 300 miles an hour.

Speaker 1:          00:02:26       All those people standing gen off to the right and the left sitting there in their face just like they've really trust them. They're looking for a subway to come. Yeah. Yeah. Like what? Bobby's shot there when he was, he was in the pine needles. I mean everyone was staying there. There was a guy sitting there was like a camera, like the level of faith that they had. The one guy did get hit today. Did you know? I saw him getting it yesterday. I saw a guy get hit you. That's how we do it. It was, it was like a delayed reaction. This old guy, he hit her head. I didn't get hit like center mass. You couldn't see cause those people but as low enough where it wasn't his head and it looked like he was walking around looking for the ball and all of a sudden they just sort of collapse this tree and then the announcer just goes, oh dear one.

Speaker 1:          00:03:05       Damn. Somebody got hurt and just whispered it. W I wonder what happened if somebody got killed like I got hit in the temple. You think they'd stopped the match after they took the ambulance? Took the body away? No, I think that they would keep going and not say that he was dead. It would ruin. It doesn't look good. It would ruin spectate. The spectator, the spectator part of it. We then have to all be wearing helmets and stuff like that. Years later. People Goggles. Yeah. Years later people would watch it on youtube. The way you watch like a goalie back in the day that didn't wear a mask. This guy's out of his fucking not, I'm still there on the fairway. And you play golf. No I don't. I, I, I appreciate the game but I, I'm just be in a no pigment Irishman. I mean by the fourth hole.

Speaker 1:          00:03:48       I don't give a fuck. It sounds great. You go out there with your friends, you get a 12 pack and you, you know, you just, we could make a lot of money cause they had like these celebrity things that you could go on and they, you've got an offer as a golf with people, right. Maybe carrying somebody bags, how many you got and those kinds of things. I mean, celebrity golf, now I'm out of that loop. Well I'd have to go out there with some big, like Hannibal Lecter Sun hat that he wore it like at the end of the morning. But they had, if they had nighttime golfing, golfing, I would do it. I have friends at golf a lot. I just don't want to suck at something else at this age. You know what I mean? So I stick to, I stick on the close to the vest. I shoot pool, I played ping pong because I love ending up where I started. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:04:29       there was no big thing. People go, you play ping pong like what are you a hand for the fe with the people. My thing is I don't play like standing there with a beer in my hand. I play like, you know, you put some spin on it. I put some spin on mother. You don't, you don't, you know who you got to. You got to play as a Jimmy Dore. Was he good? Jimmy Dore, Jimmy Dore invites you over, you know the whole area is Jimmy Dore brings you, invite you. If you think you just go on over there to uh, you know, have some burgers. It has lovely place and really he's, he's just sick of beating everybody in his neighborhood and he talks shit, where's he at? And like silver lake or something. I don't want to out where he's at. He's like, this is about as far as I'll go and only because I love you.

Speaker 1:          00:05:06       This is as far as it's come and these fucking God damn fucking Moss. You know, you're old when you have to buy a a cedar chest, take chest of drawers because they're eating at your old man sweaters. I wear the V neck sweaters now on stage. I go with that with a t shirt underneath the casual look. Yeah. I'm trying to disguise how much I, I dropped the F bomb on my act. I figure if I dress, how many, how need to have a February 15 minutes. Why usually do four days when I go out. So I got four different colors. Maybe I'll switch it up with a button down just to the wait staff doesn't start snickering at me. Off the record. I always show you were sharp Joseph off the record. I'll take that. And even that Maroon goes, go with your eyes. Well, you know, I mean, I knew you were coming over Tom. I appreciate that. Appreciate the look. Listen, that fucking guy today who won that thing. Okay. I'm, I'm sitting there, uh, the, the, the fucking, uh, golf thing. I'm, why I watch

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       it every year. I think it's awesome, right. But I'm looking at the guy and I'm texting back and forth. My Buddy Paul Versey, um, back east and when, when he hit it off that that pine needle, that was amazing. Yeah. Oh yeah. Insane. And went right to, you know, landed right there and then he tube goes in two putts and wins it. He said that that was the equivalent to when Eli through that pass to Manningham. And I was just like, dude, you know, oh this year, don't compare like real sports to golf. So Golf was delicious. Like a giant pool table. Yeah, it's a, it's a three hour mind. Fuck, I will give you that. But it's just like Eli had a 300 pound guy in his face taking, you know, taking a shot to the head. It's, it's not, this is what kills me. This is what the thing about golf, first of all did, you saw it bubbling when he won and he's got, I think that double chin, this seventh grader arms, he never took a lesson in his life.

Speaker 2:          00:06:50       And Tiger Woods is on the course. And so Phil Mickelson, so that's like Gretzky and fucking, uh, Mario Lemieux are out there and he beat him. So it's like, I know guys who suck at sports like really bad. Like you throwing the ball and they like tense up. It's one guy I know, like when he goes to shoot hoop, it's the fucking, it's like the greatest, like if physical comedy ever seen, he bites his bottom lip and he holds the ball right in front of his face so he can't even see the rim. And at the last second, he bends both as risks. So we can see it for half a second and then throws a line drive and it hits the underpart of the rim. That's how bad this guy, he gets on a golf course, he can compete, he can hit it straight. And I'm saying he kills guys and wins money out there, but to watch him hit a golf ball, you'd have no idea.

Speaker 2:          00:07:36       They give you like going to play softball here. Let's see you hit a golf ball high. Let's, let's get this guy out there. This guy's struck out. I worked with him. He struck out slow pitch softball with a girl. Underhanded. Struck out to the point. He was so embarrassed. I remember later on that night, uh, this is how long ago was he got me wine coolers. It was the 80 as discussed the hell. They were horrible. But you a psych if you underage. He was like, uh, and I was like, this sounds like getting molested story, but I swear to God it was. I had to go back and I threw him pitches until it was dark out. I think it was the next night. The next night I did it. He was so fucking embarrassed. He struck out three times and everyone was giving him shit at work. But this guy can go to the golf course. So I, I think bowling, Golf Pool, I know people have said this before, but after watching that guy went today, I, I, you know, I totally respect the game. I think,

Speaker 3:          00:08:23       oh shit. One of the things about golf is you can also be a normal person. And I mean like in basketball you can't be normal. You're how many? Six 10 guys did you see today? You know? Yeah. When you go to the mall, how many? Six 10 guys, you'll see none because it's so, it's such a freak game and the guys that are small or even freaks cause their quickness is being unbelief. Like John Stockton, his hands were twice as big as ours. There's always something freaky about something. It's spelling. Yeah, but in golf you can be like pretty much a normal guy for some reason. You got that, you whack that ball, whatever

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       it is, the Torque, the physics behind it. All golfers, they're all like almost in shape. Right? But I mean the guy, a little bit of packs, but they got little bit of a belly. Dude, if you can kill that fucking mouth, man. I meant killing them every God damn week. Oh Shit. How did you miss that? I didn't miss it. I hit it. I do. I stunned them all rang. He looked at me, just see him looking at me. How much of a Dick I am, I, I got you over here. You brought the wine. He got an offer. You might have now eaten that my clothing and I'm giving you shit about it and I was always good to you, Bill. I took care of you in back in the day. Now early on you were really mean to me. Get the fuck out. You used to bully me. Yeah, right, you did? Yeah. When I was in the comedy locker room and you came in way back in the day, that was just horseplay and we had some horseplay is horseplay. Well nowadays is considered hazing. You know I have a friend who's prosecuting that Sandusky case. Oh yeah. He went off the other day. He went to television. You went off

Speaker 3:          00:09:54       on that sand. Duskin his lawyer. But by the way, not to be egotistical. This is pretty funny about ask his lawyer. I said, what an idiot that guy is because I see such a more like it. And they go and my friend Joe goes, I gotta tell you something dumb. He's a big fan of yours. If they said, what an idiot, well, he's that, I'm not finished. There's so bad. He does have good taste. The comedy,

Speaker 1:          00:10:15       how many times? That's a, that's a great thing to bring up though. How many times have you made fun of somebody in your act? They like a cartoon deal and then all of a sudden, you know, five, six years later you're standing in the room with them. Oh yeah. And then you just, then you're just going, oh my God. Did they hear what I said?

Speaker 3:          00:10:31       Well, one of my first jokes, uh, that was a closer joke in my act was before I did the tonight show. I did star search right now when you did the tonight show was Atlanta or no, it was Carson Carson. So, but I did the stage here, but before I did is I show, after I'd done star search, I had a joke about it McMahon. The joke was a kind of went, like I said, I meet Ed Mcmahon. I said, I'm thrilled 35 years in the business. What do I say to them in a calm ed? Do I call him Mister Ed? They'll call him mister e. Mr Eddie Mcmahon, Mr Ubic, fat, lucky talentless Hump Kissing Johnny's ass for the last 30 years. You Budweiser's sucked in outposts, slinging nothing. What do you do? I don't mean that in a bad way, but that was the joke. And uh, he comes up to me right before I go on to say hi to me.

Speaker 3:          00:11:13       No, I didn't know that. He thought the joke was funny that he had seen me. They knew who I was and he pulls me towards it. I'm thinking, Oh shit, ed McMahon is gonna slide guy real big six floor, you know, and he was strong then. This was what this was like before he got kind of Strunk and, and older. And I thought, man, I that make man's going to sucker, man. I got to go on stun my first tonight. Chose that, you know, but I'm starting to be saying, well, what he's, what are you gonna just said he'd have a great set and you know, he was just very nice, you know, but he had, he heard the better and he had, but I didn't know he had, his daughter told me he had, and then we worked together at the Philadelphia Academy of Music doing some benefit. And he told me he loved the bit, you know, he thought it was funny. Let's see.

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       Yeah, we gotta love a guy who was like comfortable with a, yeah, with where he's at. He's big enough that you, that he's famous and it's funny. So in that sense, so you don't do jokes about, not to talk about comedy, but how fucking nerve wracking was it to do the tonight show with Johnny Carson? Because there was that whole thing that you couldn't just go out and have a good snow. He had to get the okay. The thumbs. Okay. Was like you did good thumbs up. It was the imprimatur of comedy. I mean it was like, you know, most of the time you got called over either because he wanted you over there or because of timing. And you know that guy who's that comedian, that really alcohol comedian from Boston. Teddy bears on. Yeah. And no offense to teddy, but he got it. Got It.

Speaker 1:          00:12:38       I get it. I can open my hand. I can't open my hand cause I got it. We'll just keep squeezing your hand. Was He there? He got fucking crawl away again. Sorry. I tell you, he's indestructible. He looked at me like, you got to bring to the table. Yeah, it gets a bit more to the table and that baby, but a teddy apparently did too long, so they brought him over to the thing, you know. But what we were asking me before, it was an interesting thing because there was no fun in it. There was no joy in it. All it was was a passing, passing through some, some worm tunnel. It was like the White Apollo in a way, but rather than the crowd, it was like he was going to pull you by just not bringing you over. And I remember looking out into the hills and Burbank thinking, I'm going to run away.

Speaker 1:          00:13:19       I'll start a new life up in the woods. I really did because I couldn't. It was so, there was no fun. My fucking head was, he led the curse. Yeah. My head was pounding my, my I, I never get headaches. I would buy a pounding headache. My heart was beaten like a rabbit's, you know? And then I got off, he gave me the songs, they told me we got to have you back. And that was like how many like hours of just absolute relief is that? Oh, that must have just been unreal. Yeah, that's what I always, I hope the amount of times I think that like why do I do this? As you're standing there before you're going out like kids, I'm really actually a really introverted person before I started doing this shit. So now I'm just sort of a loud mouth asshole kind of grew into, but you know, just from being on stage.

Speaker 1:          00:14:05       But like the first I would say like eight, nine years of doing this shit I, the amount of times I was just standing in the waiting to go on in some fucking impossible situ with some awful, yeah, like next third show or something. We were around for those days and all the Nick's, Nick's comedy South Boston, I started at nick. That was a, I mean luckily the, the guys, the Boston comics were good to me, but that was a tough place. I was brutal. That was tough. If you are from Boston, I heard show Friday. Yeah. And then they would put like 10 fucking Boston headliners. But see they took care of me, you know like uh, Gavin and Sweeney, they all looked out for me and he, they didn't try and bury me, whatever, for whatever reason we always got along. So it was different for me.

Speaker 1:          00:14:46       Like, like I heard Richard Lewis was so upset because somebody's swinging, he goes follow right. Follow that. All my stuff, my esoteric stuff, Boston stuff. And Richard apparently hid under the seats hit under the stage until everybody left. Yeah. I don't know why they used to do that, but they, I guess they used to get territorial or it's really kind of a funny, funny thing considering I didn't have to go through it and I wasn't from out of town. The fact that they'd be like, you know, what do you need a headline is for, we're here, we can close this and that you would cause so many comics do when you go on the road, tried to bury you, but they never have the audacity of just say like, follow that. You know, they always watched my back. They were always good to me, but does your, then you ended up stealing from the club and what happened there?

Speaker 1:          00:15:32       I stole from the club. Yeah. You don't remember that cash. The guy went out. And what do you know? Uh, does your audience know that you were the one I was part of the, I'm sorry. That's all right. We got to do a commercial here anyways. Hang on one second and get a fucking type in this stupid password. Um, all right, here we go. stamps.com everybody.

That should be in their bumper sticker, stamps.com. It's a hell of a deal. All right, back to the podcast here. Um, now does your audience know that you were the one that, uh, I mean I was the one that kind of sparked, sparked but kind of set you up a little and then when he did that brilliant rant and Camden, oh, the Philly thing, Bill. Oh yeah, you went, you went on before. Yeah. You went out. You were one of the other ones who went to the, uh, and you also, they started booing you and you didn't leave, but for some reason they didn't put that on Youtube. No, I told them that I make $12,000 in 10 minutes.

Speaker 1:          00:18:26       Fuck. You know, I remember you standing there going like, why, why would you think you guys could make me leave? And they actually paused from booing you for half a second, but it was only the people in the back of, the thing I loved about you was you were like sticking up for me and I thought that was really cool. And you went, they boot dom Irrera like, like one of my heroes. Fuck, come on. You remember when I was in Boston and somebody new you a headliner and was saying that a yeah. You know, the other night don was in town and we were shooting pool and I remember thinking that that was smart. He knows dom I rarer, so I was psyched to be working with you and not to mention, do you remember that line up that night? Yeah, the way that they would be because everyone went out there and there was that dance motherfucker vibe.

Speaker 1:          00:19:05       Do the, as far as I can remember, it was rich Vos. Tracy Morgan. Yeah. Remember Tracy Tree? So Neil, you, Bobby Kelly, me, Jimmy Schubert, Jimmy Schubert. They booed me. Schubert. They didn't let him say a word. He says, I bombed and see you can't bond with a late at talk. You can't bomb when it's still light and you're standing outside and half the crowd is sitting down. That poor bastard brought half his family there. But the funniest guy, I know Jim Norton. Ralphie may, that was the show. Dude. I can tell you in 20 years people are going to look back at that lineup and be like, why were people getting booed? They were drinking all day. It was crazy. And it just outside though. Can I tell you something? My car, my deserve it. Cause like in 1988 I went to go see a dice clay at the Worcester Centrum, uh, at the height of that, uh, of the dice stuff and an unknown Eddie Griffin was opening for him, which is a great time for comedy and we will all Boone and out when I was born it was who?

Speaker 1:          00:20:01       Eddie Griffin. Yeah. Eddie. It was your born Eddie Griffin. He wasn't famous. I wasn't a comic and I was doing that more on audience sing like that. Tyson is going to love us because we're doing this because we want dice to come on. And, and Eddie Griffin stood there going, fuck you mother fuckers. I'm not getting off stage. And people kind of like, Whoa, oh, we thought you were just going to run off. And then he ended up killing doing that Michael Jackson thing that he did or something killed. He ended up turning around and killed. So that's the thing about that Philly thing. Why don't make such a big deal? Because I was like, guys, a bunch of guys have done that. There just was no youtube where you told me that they expect you to do it after that. But I gotta tell you the funniest line for some reason. Fuck the Liberty Bell. I Dunno why, but that made me cry. I lash and like what the fuck? The Liberty Bell Dunne. I'm with nab.

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       I hope he gets an HDL to shift flyers. Have a once is Gerald Ford was president, but then fuck the liberty. That's like so many Boston yelling at somebody going, hey, fuck Paul revere. Like we give a shit. Right, right. Damn man. I'm saying don't talk about our bell. Hey, don't talk about our tourist attractions like that. That's not the boat's buddy. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:21:08       And that was, uh, one of a, now they're happy night on that happened on the happy night on the road when you got anything. And I, rumor has it that you're going to be starting up your own, uh, your own podcast. And rumor has it that I might be on a short list of guests that you're trying.

Speaker 3:          00:21:23       Well, yeah, you said that you didn't want to do it right away because we're talking now, but I want you to do it as soon as you want to do it. It's going to be a dom Irrera live at the laugh factory.

Speaker 2:          00:21:30       I'll come, I'll come down and do it, Mike. Mike, because you're our conversational guy. I just don't like when I go and I do somebody's podcast and for an hour we tell all our stories to each other, blah, blah blah. And then hey, come and do my podcast next week. And then I had always feels like what I did for VH one where I wasn't on, I love the eighties I was on, I love the 80 strikes back. So they had already talked about all the a level shit. So when I came through it was like, do you remember, what would you do for a Klondike Bar? All the Eddie Murphy Raw, uh, back to the future. All that shit was gone and it was like the really, uh, do you remember a show called square pegs? A, you know, Short live show? Can you got to comedy on that? It was really like a, so that, that, that's, that would be the reason why I don't do that though. But if you, if you're wondering, I want to tell you, I really appreciate you breaking out your new shoes for this.

Speaker 3:          00:22:21       These aren't new. I just don't wear them much because they look like bowling shoes. These are Todd's there. I was going to say bowling shoes. He 85

Speaker 2:          00:22:28       a shoe. Three 85 a shoe. That's how expensive

Speaker 3:          00:22:32       you have to be. Can't buy a pair by him individually.

Speaker 2:          00:22:36       I bought, I bought the first one and then the other one I'm going to come back and get later. How do you rate bill? What's your process? Well, you know what it is is I try and go out and live a life. Okay. And then it writes itself. And as a community you always have to be observing things. You know the newspaper I read like 17 newspapers a day. Dot. That's what I do. Wow. I just cause I want to see it from every angle.

Speaker 3:          00:22:57       So you're more of a informative person than an actual comedian, do you? You don't even go for lab.

Speaker 2:          00:23:02       Oh No, no, no, not at all. Well, you've seen my sets down there, don't. Yeah. Well what dumb. That's what I always loved about watching you on stage.

Speaker 3:          00:23:08       I didn't go for left handed to the crab Felicity to just stand there, stare at me and just not walk off stage. It was this amazing. I want that crowd think, and this is what I'm more of a motivational speaker when they, when they leave my show, I want them to think, fuck, I could do that. So that's what I'm about you with the labs and the killing I, yeah, it's old. It's old school. I liked the teaching. You know what I love what comedians say. A true story like that makes a difference. Like, like they're going to leave say savor. Yeah, that was a true story. Yeah. But you're going out at the end that go, you know, a second guy. I didn't think he was funny, but when you talk about

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       my God, he was honest. I think there was other guys made that shit up. That really funny shit. Oh well, you know what I love is you, you, uh, you still come down and work out and I always work out. I feel like there's just a handful of us who once you start selling tickets on the roads will still go down. I don't know why guys who take off to the club, I mean, I understand that like if you're married and like I'm single right now, but even when I wasn't, my girlfriend didn't understand. I go, well, I'm trying to get better, but what do you think? I said, you know, like you can't say like, like when I did the tonight show, that was 1987. Right. That's a long time ago that, you know, I could, I mean I PR you have to practice.

Speaker 1:          00:24:25       I can't let go. Like, if you play basketball, you can't say to somebody, uh, you know, I usually score 25 points of the game and he's going to, well, you know what palliate you scored for tonight. So, you know, I, you want to be good. I mean, I know you have the same motivation that I have to keep improving. You're not, you're not really competing against anybody else. You just compete with yourself. I am competing with a lot of people. Who are you jealous of? Who's really makes you angry? Success. It's just something about, you know what it is. I've always been jealous like swagger. My tough guy to know about you is your, uh, your, your arm wrestling abilities. Mm. We were talking about that last night. Not to be a name dropper. What? Renee Zellweger cute. You ever see her live beautiful? No, I've only seen it in the movies with that.

Speaker 1:          00:25:08       That fucking guy looks like Phil Mickelson buddies from England. You got to go to the hooker. Oh yeah, yeah. Yes. It should've been like on the $20,000. Yeah. The one that he was that hookers name like names like Phillip North. What the fuck was his name now? I forgot I'm Harry Harrington. No, it's something Bobby Bittman. Yeah, it was like, oh, he's Rosenthal. It was like something, just a little Rosenthal. He's the producer. Draymond now he's a, what the fuck was his name? Harry crumb. No, no, I don't. I'm terrible at names. Harry. You really terrible. It's not able to close your gray Harry Carey Harrington. Hugh grant. I knew that. Something like that. What was the hunter's Dan Remembers? Uh, it would be a great memory. That'd be a great recall. It's like destiny or holy shit get good that she has to ask me. What a question though. She was hot.

Speaker 1:          00:25:59       She was hot, she was hot. And she, she, you know, and that's, you know, that's one of those great things about being a hooker here in la. Just like everybody at any moment. You don't know. You're gonna run into lot of exposure and movie star. It was great exposure. How about the Eddie Murphy thing with the transvestite? Was that ever proven though? Well, he, I think, I think it was proven that he, you know, and nobody could ever prove that he didn't know it was that he knew it was a man. But, uh, you don't go to Santa Monica Boulevard and pick up a regular hookers. What if you're going just going to swing it by yum, yum donuts. He, this happened to me. They look, I don't think Eddie Murphy, he's a brilliant actor, but I mean the thing is the way, what is with all the, what, what's the deal with all deal? What's the deal with all the doughnut

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       places out these people and why do they eat so many doughnuts? I don't have a Billy donuts.

Speaker 2:          00:26:51       Never seen so many, not only so many fucking doughnut shops out here, but they're all like, seem to be independently owned and uh, everyone has a different name is yum, yum donuts. Go, go down another Arlo boy, they got some donuts and everybody out here works out.

Speaker 3:          00:27:07       Who pays the whole you to a hole in the middle of the year,

Speaker 2:          00:27:11       your friend Renee Zellweger eat a dozen and then fucking Yak. I'm up in Maya. What I was going to say, but at any point when you were talking to her, did she do some sort of touching of your arm or maybe tapped you on me and it just made you feel like a little boy again? Well, she had to believe that Chris was like her. Her whole

Speaker 3:          00:27:28       aura aura is really positive. Entered her. She is right in the middle of her chest. She is a centrally located key. But uh, but you know how I met her. Listen to this, talk about a name dropping thing first was on a Sunday night. I'm in Cleveland. It's snowing sideways. It was so bad at next day. Fox, it was snowing. I'm telling you it was start talking about Snowden. I'll tow. It's got ran off the lake. It's a lake effect. Snow. It's real snow. It's like effect. You see the difference. Uh, but uh, I'm, I'm sitting in Cleveland looking out the window of the, I'm not even going to get out of here tomorrow. I had to go to a reading ready for this name drop city. Sean Penn had called me up the Jesus Christ dom. I know. Wait, there's more to read with the Chazz Palminteri Deniro.

Speaker 3:          00:28:17       Renee Zellweger go fuck yourself for what? For a movie. A comedy movie about, and I was supposed to play deniros brother now shorts over Broadway. Yeah. Bullets of row. No, this is really, this is just last year. The matter of fact, they called me a month ago to come in and read the rewrites with them, but I couldn't make it. I have bronchitis. But uh, I'm sitting there and I've really turned into woody Allen because at the end of the thing, I, you know, I just got to kind of a crush on Renee Zellweger and she's so pretty and soak such a good actress and she says, you really good to cause I hope I get to work with you babe. And she said, Babe. And I went and I was walking down the steps alone. I'm going, she called me be

Speaker 2:          00:28:54       Babe Babe. Yeah. Powerful. The power of a beautiful and figure, but if they have famous, yeah, I did a, I did a show one time and down Irvine down at the mall there and a the end of the show there's this woman came up and just really quickly shook my hand and, and then said really funny and then left. I'm telling you, it was like fucking electricity was in our hand and it was, it was the chick from the white snake videos who walked around in the of the white dress still looking good. But like, and I had no idea who she was, but she just had like that. Like there was no way she wasn't going to become famous. I'm telling you dude, she shook my hand and it was like fucking a lightning bolt. Went through it. There's definitely energy and she's like, I don't know, pushing 50 and there was all these other 20 something year old hotties and I'm watching her out the door. Like, who the

Speaker 1:          00:29:41       fuck was that? Well, he doesn't want to talk like that. Oh, that you had that sort of electricity dom. Do you ever wish that you had that sort of, I never went. You know, he wish I did. Even when I was good looking, I wasn't a good look at the it factor. You know what? I love that. Who, who's been uh, um, uh, oh man, I can't forget his name died. Passed away was when my favorite character, Jenny, no. Uh, the pharmacy fields, the to April, April, go to Abbott and Costello. Ah, they used to, he was a former teacher and he used to do that. Welcome back Kotter. Nope. Nope. He passed away. Fuck man. It's now it's becoming really stressful. The show redhead, redhead with the mustache does Wartburg Dennis Wolfsburg when he used to do they just say that cause I'm bad with names and then I totally love the guy.

Speaker 1:          00:30:28       Then I panicked and then I just forget it. This is why I do this. I sucked. You're blocking, you're blocking. I'm putting too much pressure. That's why I don't golf. I don't golf with these bubbles. He's self taught guys who beat the Gretzky's in the Mario Muse. Um, he used to do this bit about the it factor, having it with women. But remember that joke you can, I don't know what it is. I don't think I ever had it. He goes, but whatever it is, I have the antidote gentlemen. And he would stick his tongue out. Fucking love Doug Guy. I probably just butchered his God damn joke. And it was probably gonna say there's a funny, but you know, he was, he was, he mugged a lot, but he was funny. Oh, it's just to me, this whole act was mugging. He went, he went out to, uh, the comedy connection of Providence, right in the end when he was sick and he sat down, I heard about Lloyd and got a standing ovation.

Speaker 1:          00:31:15       I heard he did that and they already did Boston when it was still open to connection. Absolutely destroyed you. I heard one time, I heard you one time, you did a set half sitting, half standing simultaneously either in your fucking destroyed it. No cracks me up is like a c like better the kid, you know, what does he like 39, good shape, whatever. He started looking guy. Yeah, and he sits down after about two minutes on stage. We don't 15 minutes to calm store all day long. We all fuck who don't work and then he sits down. He takes a break. Two minutes. Oh boy. Anybody fired and he looks like he could do like 40 pull ups when he wakes up. He could do it. I'm sure he could. Yeah. Well I'm glad we finally got to that about 40 minutes. Then we finally know, 30 minutes said that we realized that a bright orange says he's really one of the, one of the more lazier guys out here, which is, yeah, he's a lazy, funny comedian.

Speaker 1:          00:32:08       This is the kind of things, I mean I can't believe you got me to admit certain things in the show or you're about to to. I want to make your cry is what I want to do. I think since somehow Brent Ernst's killing while sitting down and being better looking and in better shape than both of us, I think this is going to lead you to crank. Well, I realize now, you know, look, look how much weight I've gained right now. You know, I've gained since I've known you for 30 pounds. All right? And I know that I can't tell. Well, you don't really look, you don't really check me out. It is all done. Look at my head. My head is bigger. What are you wearing? That slimming black tee

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       shirt.

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       I've got a Bob Barry bonds head, but it's interesting because now, and I don't even know if this is a bit yet, Bill, but I think there's something in it. I have to look. I don't like women my own age, and you know what I mean? I can't, I can't fake that. I could get aroused by them. No, I always wanted it. I wish I had that kind of love or something, but I need like a hot young chick. But the only hot young chick I'm going to get has to be floored. She's gotta be daddy issue inside or outside. Yeah. He's gotta be messed up in some way. But that's what I'm looking for.

Speaker 2:          00:33:14       How many, uh, how many strippers have you, have you dated,

Speaker 3:          00:33:18       dated, uh, only a couple. I was in love with Warren. How old? How old were you when you did, when you made that move? Uh, two years ago. You fell in love with the stretch? Yeah. When you, first of all this a country song, she was, um, she was not stripping at the time. She was bartending and just given the occasional lap dance and really beautiful girl and under that bar and fun. But I'll tell you, oxycontin and alcohol really mess you up. I don't know if you knew that, but I still loved the girl, but she's a, I don't think, I don't think we're getting back together that oxy, her husband and their two kids keep blocking us.

Speaker 2:          00:33:57       Oh, Jesus. Dom, you're making me feel good. Make me feel good. Some of the choices I made back in the day, dude, oxy is, uh, that's a terrible one, right? Yeah. That's one of those things like even when you get off at your, I don't know that you're ever, uh, depending on how long you do it, the same. I lost a buddy of mine did that. I got another one. He's not doing so well. Did you grow up in a neighborhood that was a lot of drugs. I'm not like that. Not like that. It was a, I grew up, you know, it was, it was called the sac bullshit. It was weed. There was the weed guy, there was the bookie and then w and then there was, you know blues obviously, but you know in some coke when you got older, but uh, like nobody was doing like heroin and crack was like, you're out of your fucking mind.

Speaker 2:          00:34:42       Cause everybody thought if you smoke crack, that was it. You had done well the, they say you get addicted the first time. The look, that's what they said. But I, I got friends of mine who had did and they're like, yeah, you're okay. It was all right. Still Rolling. Yeah. Maybe they're addicted to other things. They don't have time to be. Maybe they're just better people. Better, stronger. You have good friends. Let me ask you this. If you had one drug that you think you would like, what would it be? I know what mine is. If you, if I could do a drug that I've never tried it,

Speaker 3:          00:35:08       we tried and you think that like it's not going to have any repercussions. Just want to the feeling. What feeling would it be?

Speaker 2:          00:35:16       I have a tie. Well, I want to know. I want to know what it feels like. Like that train spotting where you sink into the rug the first time you do heroin. That's exactly, that's exactly what I want that. But I got to admit the hallucinating thing tripping. Yeah, but I'll, but that doesn't go on your trip it, and it's not like you don't know the a trepan you the door fucking

Speaker 1:          00:35:37       melting. You're like, oh, it's because I'm on acid. It's not like those high school films where you'd be like, you thought you could fly in. That jumped out to me. Uh, what was that movie with that old guy? Was it something to me, Larry Allen Ark and did a part where he played an old guy and he fucking, uh, he just, he got addicted to heroin like his seventies and he's just like, what the fuck? I'm 70. That's a guy she had good idea just to try it at 70. I mean I'd rather go out shooting drugs and go out taking a kick in the ass. That must hurt man. That's a thing. You ever think about that seriously bill? Yeah. Excepting one at things. Take one for the team and taking one for the team. I dime your number came up. So you're not going to like this like this.

Speaker 1:          00:36:24       I don't think so. We worked this out. Now I've actually thought of early a priest. How I, how I want to go out in by wolves. Eat shredded by animals. Yeah. I either want to live to be like 105 like you lived so long that there's nobody at your funeral because you outlived everyone who gives a shit or you know, cause that, cause that, that is funny image cause that's one of the things if you live long enough, I'm sure we had people that cared about people doing the eulogy. Like, I mean ever since I met him when he was 87 and uh, you know, he was old, like he like playing cards, which were those slippers. He always wore those slippers.

Speaker 1:          00:37:05       But if you die, like you know, like all my friends, you know who have died tragically fucking young it seems, I mean you pack the house and everybody's up there try and get a good, that's the only good thing about dying young is everybody gives a fuck it, there's articles written about you. There's nothing worse when, I mean there's nothing worse than dying yet, but Diane old also is, you know, you sit in there that you've got that fucking old terrified picture. My uncle Tony, when he died, he really was very prejudiced and very angry, but he also loved his children. He loved God, he loved mountains. And then when he died was so fun. Is that makeup for the racist side yet? But I'm saying he was that balance process on people in the nature love Berlin. It's true though. He was like all that and he's, and we're standing around the coffin.

Speaker 1:          00:37:54       You see that mountain. It's for us. That's for us. Not these other people. This is God's country. But when we're around the quote from we're standing, you know people lie about people after they died and this guy leaves the Deli, who was the first a tank character ever did? Like I got down a little, he said, we're staying there. Me and a friend of mine who a priest and like a couple of my cousins and we're standing there, oh over the body. And he goes, he never had a bad word to say about anybody. And we went from crying to fucking laugh. I'm thinking, I said, all they do is have bare word said, but everybody, and then he goes, listen to this, this is a really old reference. He goes, he never hated anybody except Larry Bowa. Right. Larry both of the old for the Phillies and he, and he looks up, he goes, he

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       hated that motherfucker would engine. Huh? Was he a gambler? No, he didn't gamble. He just hated him. He hated the Larry Boat cause he hit one 75 but he was a great fielder. But I mean, Halloween. What a, what an obscure reference to make at a funeral. And so in general, back in the day, he probably just didn't like second basement frustrating, maybe that the floor. But I love that everybody laughed. I've had a couple of those it like funerals were crying, crying, crying, the crying, laughing.

Speaker 2:          00:39:00       I did that one time a buddy of mine, his dad died and it was just one of those fucking, you know, tragic. You know, we were young and he died on a nowhere and the kid had already lost, his mom was fucking horrible. And uh, so it was pouring, raining to make it even worse. Fucking like the, remember the movie seven? It was raining like that. Okay. Yeah. So we, we, you know, go, you know, go through the surface and now they're going to, you know, put the guy in the ground and the guy was so popular. I mean, it was just a zillion people there. So they had like one of these, you know, one of those pop tents with no sides to it. So there's so many fucking people, everybody's jamming in there. Me and my buddy can't get in. You know, we're on the outer ring, we're just getting rained on and shit.

Speaker 2:          00:39:43       And my other asshole friend is just inside the tent and he's sitting there and we're all crying and stuff and it bringing the body down and all of a sudden, just from the weight of the rain, like this little like canal started pouring down in just missing my friend and my buddy in the middle of crimes was standing range, just reached up and adjusted it. So it went all over as a coach. But he had like this wool kind of coat on so he couldn't feel it at first. And Dude, I'm talking, crying, laughing, just crying because it was so sad and that, that's the thing too that I never thought people ever understand about comics when they have a distasteful joke, like a boat sinks as a plane crash and you have a job. They always think it's cause you're insensitive and they'd sometimes don't understand that it's, it's a defense mechanism where exciting. The pain. Yeah, I'm feeling something bad. I don't want to feel it. And then you, you, you make a fucking joke and then you're laughing because you don't want to feel that. So you actually doing it because you can, it's kind of a, I think, I think, uh, a dysfunction. It's kind of a form of dysfunction.

Speaker 3:          00:40:42       Well, like the pedophile jokes, we all know how terrible that is. And yet you could twist sentences, but you could, you could twist it around. I usually bring it back on myself. You know, like a one jokes that says, you know what about me, father, I wasn't hot enough for you. You know what I mean? Like that kind of thing to make it me. I wouldn't want to hurt a kid. But there is a good example of something that has caused so many people, so much pain. And I'm not just talking about the physical pain, but um, you know, we do,

Speaker 2:          00:41:08       you're, you end somebody's life when you, that's why that that sent Dusky guy. Yeah. You know, like they shouldn't put those get date. They should automatically get the death penalty just immediately. They take 'em out. Dude, if you've got a rabid dog in your neighborhood, you fucking put it down. Those sex offender guys, that's it. Because all those people that that dude fucked with, it's like that's can now affect, you want to talk about dating strippers? Like how that's going to affect who they pick. You know who they pick as a uh, a wife, how they treat their kids. They might, they, there's a chance that they could, you know, sometimes, I don't know if he had happened, I'm going to go beyond my intelligence on this shit, which isn't too hard to do, but I all I know is that that's generations of therapy because of the abuse of the, they, they repeat the whoever.

Speaker 2:          00:41:57       Yeah. Those guys, they don't get the, you can't put that guy in jail and like, I mean, how long like you're attracted to what you're attracted to or in a cell. Well, especially with, at Dartmouth, they stuck you in a cell. How long before you wouldn't like big tented strippers, you'd come out 80 years later. I'm dumb. I, I get bring me to some big tatted stripper. Those guys, like eight year olds, you stick them in a cell and you talked to him. You try to undo it and show him an adult that they're wired that way. That's it. Just fucking sick. Is that put in, put them to add. It's terrific. It's why I don't believe in a higher power that gives a fuck.

Speaker 3:          00:42:33       Well that's a whole different subject, but I understand that. But do you hear that pedophile joke about, uh, he might have a total joke joke. No, not at all. It's a two guys sitting on a bench. You see an 11 year old boy walked by, one guy better. Paul says to the other one, it goes, boy, he must have been hot back in [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          00:42:52       He must've been subbed the back in the day.

Speaker 2:          00:42:56       Oh, that's fucking twisted here. And with that, a little more advertising. Oh yeah. But that's still, I still like to stamp the Isaiah Dotcom was tremendous for me. Bill I, amazon.com. Oh, okay. I got think now telling me about it. Oh Geez. Dom, I would love to, I'm so glad you said that. I was worried that you would say, hey bill, don't tell me about that. Cause I hear great things about Amazon. I don't know enough.

There's like a little, it's like a present. Let's nice. You know, and you forget that your body. No. I heard great things about that company and I've worked there.

He's still like, oh, I didn't mean it. I mean he's in curls and all of that. Yeah. Last time I was there as motorcycles to allegedly, allegedly someone who looked like him, a yank somebody out of a car and a, yeah, tune them up a little bit. As they say back east. Really? Yeah. The guy kept blowing his horn, you know, you know? Yeah. Nixon that gets worked out. Yeah. Nick's no joke. And this thing about him too, he's a truly as a tough guy because he didn't tell, he didn't tell me he did it. Somebody else did. You know somebody who doesn't fight. So he, Oh, I grabbed this guy, nick didn't say shit. Somebody else told me the story that was laughing my ass off.

You know how he kind of had a problem with this guy? You know the guy, you know, he kinda, you know, I just had to kind of sort some stuff out or whatever. Just the way he told him.

Him and his girlfriend were sitting next to me and we talked the whole time. Meryl Streep? No, I don't think so. He's beside his girlfriend. But towards the end, yeah. I didn't know her. I didn't know who was

Speaker 2:          00:48:47       sound good. He was, he was giving her tips and I watched this thing. Uh, uh, what, what's, what's the famous phrase? I knew it was you. You broke my heart.

Speaker 2:          00:49:30       Oh, I have the hackiest I like, I like going to Laurence Olivier. Those guys are great too, you know. All right, well I'll, I'll, I'll give you the, the, when I was young I was, I liked, uh, leave me out of this. I like, I, I was Lee Marvin, Charles Bronson, Charles Bronson. I just watched one of his old movies called the big house in 1955 years. Small partner. And I'm telling you as far as like physiques, he's the original like fucking marketing. He was dude, he was fucking shredded before people knew how to do p nine dx as he used to work in mines and Poland. Like back then, like what I love about the forties and 50s and even into the sixties like, like being in shape just meant you weren't fat. You know what I mean? Like when those guys like

Speaker 3:          00:50:18       let's you were Hercules or one of those guys, but even some of them back in the back way earlier that didn't have the muscularity.

Speaker 2:          00:50:24       Yeah. Like you watch like Ben Hur and they're all just like Weissmuller all suck in their guts in, they always had like some sort of like, it looked like have some sort of wrestling championship belt that they would put Lomas like a, a cumber bun that they would always have over their gut and they would just sort of have their sort of, uh, sort of packs. Right. You know what I mean? It was just like they just showed up with what they had. Christopher Christopher Reeves, who was the guy who played superman. Christopher, he's now the other, the older superman and television. He wasn't in show his, no. Who is it? Shape it all? He Leonardo, I played Batman wasn't in shape that a white utility belt, but his brother was Hercules' oh, Steve Reeves and his name was Reeves too, even though, but, and he, he was really in shape.

Speaker 2:          00:51:11       Excuse me. Bless you. It is one of those guys that really look like a look like Hercules and they both thought they both did. Superman dry died tragically then that weird. I remember I used to do a bit on Christopher Reeves and it was, it was, it was after, you know, he got paralyzed, which might seem insensitive but I was tight. But it was no, I was actually talking about what a pussy I was. People had like those horrific fucking injuries like that. And then they always go, I, you know, I consider it a blessing. I'm just going to every day I'm alive and Blah Blah Blah and like, and then they always go like, well God, pick them because he knew that he could handle this challenge. Might bit was don't have a fucking pick me cause I'll be in that wheelchair. Kill me fucking kill me.

Speaker 2:          00:51:57       Just being in the head and kill me. And I was saying how I would steer the, the fucking wheelchair. I'd zone myself down the stairs. There's no fucking way. Okay. I can handle. The only thing I can handle is somebody's Wa flipping me over it and fucking a wipe my ass and I would just be going, I would just have to be joking around. I shouldn't be saying this. There's a few things I'd never make fun of us when I was younger. I never make, I don't make fun of handicapped. I don't like. I actually know some things. I don't make fun. I don't make them a special needs kids. There's just shit I don't do. Ooh, I just make fun of like adult retarded kids. We started people rather I, once they get to a certain age, you can make fun. You want to hear one story that I tell that that I only usually tell offstage.

Speaker 2:          00:52:44       I was at a, I was in a red sox game fan way plaque, right? And I'm sitting in the bleachers and there was this family of like it was a father with three sons. Two of them were just regular people and the other one was special needs, but he was a monster. He was like fucking six, two and we were sitting out in center field and we will almost behind the bullpen. And so, you know the weird configurations of Fenway, it's like our row went to a wall and then the wall went up and then there was like left field, right field. It's sort of like Centerfield I guess. Yeah, it center, right. And then there's the center field bleachers where the garage doors. So the Keto at the mental problems was like up against the wall or whatever. And he was, I don't know what his deal was.

Speaker 2:          00:53:29       He was getting worked up and his dad was telling him to calm down and he's like, fuck yeah, he's like Carson. And he was like retarded or whatever. And then his dad find goes, come on, calm down. I think when the crowd was like, oh Nah, he was getting like amped up. And then the kid got to fucking amped up dance. They come on and sit down and he was like, no, I'm not shutting down. His Dad wound up and as hard as he could slug this kid in the chest. Well, but the dad was like 65 and this kid was like 28 and he was a monster and he hit him in the chest and the kids, fuck you, dude. I was one of those things. Look your Daddy, no one wanted the lab, but it was fucking dude. He was like right out of it. Like, I don't know, we don't have a fucking like over the top comedy. And then you will also terrify because you're like, yeah, get that dude settle down because he's big enough to kill all of us. Ah, what am I doing? I'm talking about people with wheelchairs is all the shit I don't talk. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:54:21       Well, I got a Charles Bronson story that I was doing a roast for Mickey Rooney, right. And I'm there with Martin Landau, George Segal, me, Charles Bronson. This is the half of the day, if someone that is Christ and Charles Bronson, I go, I just turned to him and he was very quiet, you know, and I said, am I gotta tell you it's really cool to meet you? And he goes, we're not even like inflecting any, make any emotion. He goes, pitch been at Napkin and I go, yeah, how fucking cool is that? Branson, he's so rude. I love it. Right? So I go up on stage and I'm like roast and not only Mickey Rooney but like other people and the day is, and I tell the story about Bronson, I go, how cool that he's like, you know, this is Charles, this guy is death wish guy and he's so cold that he doesn't even accept a count. Me just ask me for it and the Napkin and then I come and I sit down and goes, hey man, I'm sorry I can't hear out of this year. I got shit. I wanted you to be

Speaker 2:          00:55:18       mean. You know dude, I loved all those guys. And I was wondering the other day, like I was talking to somebody going like, why did it the stars back then the Lee Marvin Sapp Bronson's and all them. Why did they seem through, those guys were like 130 140 pounds. But you just had, they had that vibe. Like I was like, I would never fuck with that guy. And then you look at the stars today, you look at Brad Pitt had, you know, fuck him or whatever the guy is like six, two, six, three shredded, right? It's the highlights in his hair. I don't know what it is, but fucking, I finally was reading something about Lee Marvin Lee. Marvin was fought in world war two and like his entire, he was like one of two people who survived as entire platoon eat to got a purple heart and all that. And it's like, no wonder we seem like such a fucking bad ass

Speaker 3:          00:55:58       was remember him in the Wild One? Marlon Brando, you should.

Speaker 2:          00:56:02       Well, I think the big red one was Lee Marvin, the wild one. Was that the one with the motorcycle one? I saw that. But you know what's the worst, the cringeworthy movement moment in that movie is when they start singing those two actors and you can clearly see that there. Actress playing tough guys, they start singing like some sort of do up at the end of the bar and they're supposed to be shocking. The bartender, dude. It's such a Douche

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       chills moment where I remember that that was in why one? As long as you've got the Harley and they come into town. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:56:31       The one where it goes, that's calm ball style. Marlon Brando had that one.

Speaker 2:          00:56:37       Do you know what the, you know when you play the a, the Wilbur theater and uh, yeah, in Boston, that Green Room Brando live there. Oh really? Yeah. I had heard that he was tell the story like he, when he was a broke actor, he was doing the doing theater and that was like some sort of dressing room. He was so broke. He actually stayed. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:56:52       I'm a, I'm afraid of that place when there's people in there, I can't imagine going to bed because the place is haunted.

Speaker 1:          00:56:58       Oh, you think it is. Do you believe in ghosts? Oh yeah. Fuck yeah. I don't believe in them. Although when I come down here, I, I kind of, I heard one time I heard one so clearly. Then here's a, I'm in my Bo. No, a cough just kept coughing. It was, oh, don't, I don't get any sort of laugh on that or the Gospel. Clearly he had broadcasters speech, sorry.

Speaker 3:          00:57:24       No, no. I hear, I'm in bed. I had a studio apartment. I just moved out from my wife and I hear a cough. I go, Oh God, you know, guys, got a club. I go, guys, you got a club? Who's in here? It's only a studio. So I go and I look and I walk through a field of energy that my hair stood up in the back. I got the chills, but like a chilling feeling. And I go, Oh shit, this is, it was during the day too. So I get down to the office and I tell

Speaker 2:          00:57:54       now, when you walk through that energy, the person like, like take over your body and you started making like

Speaker 3:          00:58:00       pottery. I started, uh, I started moonwalking around the apartment. Uh, but anyway, I said to the department manager, so this is weird. She goes, oh, that's the ghost with the smoking cough, right? That there was a regular ghosts there.

Speaker 2:          00:58:16       That is a stand. So what the fuck is with that stupid show? Ghost hunters, they can't find a ghost. So save that Goddamn life. That show is the funniest fucking show on

Speaker 1:          00:58:26       you. Don't they find like an energy and then they always know the name of the ghost and they're like, I'm here forever. I don't understand. I uh, I don't know about that shit. I don't know that. I don't believe in God. Um, I believe that there's something beyond all the time

Speaker 2:          00:58:52       since we have, there's, I believe in all that stuff that's beyond us, but we don't know what it is. And religion is a guest and, uh, it just doesn't, it just doesn't do it for me. It just doesn't, that whole fucking ain't got to have faith. It's like, no, you don't have the fucking answers. To me, religion is science. Okay. Science gives me fucking answers. And if they don't have answers, they go, well, we got to work on it. And then they gradually figure out more shit. But then, then there's the spiritual side where you do something good, you feel good, you do something bad, you feel bad. And uh, yeah. And like she like a psychopath. Yeah. Um, I believe in that. And that's that, that feeling I feel is in everybody, unless you're a psychopath. And I feel that religion exploit's that and they turned it into this, they turn it into a science.

Speaker 2:          00:59:43       They turned it into this formula and this this too. Yeah. And then they turn it into this punishment thing and then there's this fucking guy who's mad at me cause I got a lap dance. And it's like when you really just start reading about space and how fucking gigantic the Goddamn universities is, the fact that, you know, you're staring at me, it's like me looking at it, uh, a fucking an Amoeba and getting upset about what the fuck is doing with other Amoebas. It doesn't make any sense to me. The fact that God would need to be praised and sung to would seem like he's insecure big time, but how could it be God, you know? But that's where I don't get, you know. Yeah. And it's like, if I'm a fuck up, it's like, it's like you made me like, where is your responsibility? That's like a fight. If I build a car and it doesn't go and I get mad at the car. Yeah. You know what I mean? You fucking this car, this car is evil.

Speaker 2:          01:00:35       It needs to be thrown into a pit of fire. I think I look, I think if you're a piece of shit you, you, oh actually I'm a philosophy. Another philosophy in this, if you're a piece of shit, you basically get yours in life. You do. Unless you're, the brilliance of a sociopath is you don't, calmer doesn't affect you, I don't think. Unless you believe in it. If you don't believe in it, then you don't feel like you did anything bad and you just don't attract anything bad to you. But if you actually feel guilty, you bring it to, cause there's guys, I'm not going to name guys because I've, I've seen guys in this fucking business just do like, you know people who they just such a piece of shit. It gets to the point where you're not even Maddie Collins. It's like funny. I Dunno Bobby like that, but like it's, it becomes like funny.

Speaker 2:          01:01:21       You know, you don't get mad. They just like what? Like, yeah, well I don't want to name names. I remember there was a guy, this dude, this dude I do, he borrowed somebody's workout bench and he said, yeah, I'll give it back to you in a week. And He, and he's the dude came back in a week and he sold it. He sold it for, I forget what, but like some drugs or something. And what I loved about it was just that in the moment of it of like, yeah, eventually in six days this guy is going to come back and I says, but for these next six days, I don't have to deal with that guy in that moment. I want drugs so fuck you. So like that's that type of shit that, that's such a dirt bag move. But that, that thing, like if he had done it to me, I would be mad.

Speaker 2:          01:02:06       But the joy I would get out of retelling the story, don't you fucking believe this kind of were laughing. Like the joy that I would get out of it. Like, yeah, I could only get like a can only get so mad at him. Um, well, when you are speaking to that like, cool. Yeah, we, I never named names. I try not to name names and like the podcast or something like that, but I guess it's, there's always a, there's always people that, you know, not that I'm coastline and on whoever the hell you just said that. Cause I don't, I don't know the guy like that. I Dunno. We're only an hour in done. How easy with this our flow. Seamless with you, Bill. Seamless. Terrific.

Speaker 2:          01:02:58       Can I steal a bag? Can I steal a bag? Now that it's getting tighter, let me just, just give me another six months with it. Hey, you know what I learned today? Uh, you cannot get a breakfast burrito on Easter Sunday at any of these Mexican taco stands. Speaking of Jesus, they are Mexicans are, are down with hey Seuss. I went to three different places to get a breakfast burrito. And when I get a breakfast Burrito, I don't want it made by white people who looked over some Mexican guy's shoulder. I want to, I want the real fucking deal. Well, why don't you, why don't you go to two? Don't you think it's time to give up? I thought it was a flu fact that he went to three is kind of sad. No, I went to the first one. People think of you as a celebrity.

I used to play uh, some sort of sniper game and I remember one day I played it like eight hours a day and then I walked out on the street and they had this thing like when you get somebody in the scope, like the scope would just fit right over there that cross the X.

Speaker 2:          01:04:29       And I was walking down the street and I was just looking at people cross the street and I was seeing that x on their head could blow them away. It was awesome.
