Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's the Monday morning podcast for Monday, September 29th, 2014 how the heck are you? Oh, that's good. You know it's always great to hear the doing well. What are you doing right now and your Monday morning? Hi, you're driving through the fucking rain. Goddamn windshield wiper. Wow. Wow. Right. Trying to clear your fucking windshield so you can see that awful building that you hate going into. Yeah. We get the urge to just fucking keep driving right by it. You know what? If you don't make that left, what if you don't make that right? What if you just keep going straight? What would happen if you took your cell phone? You throw it out the fucking window and he just kept going and you didn't talk to anybody and you just kept driving. You got a credit card on you, right? You got a debit card. You just keep fucking dry.

Speaker 2:          00:00:56       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:00:57       right up and over the hill. Right. Passed at fucking solely Eaton God damn place you work at. You just kept fucking going. Are you commuting right now? I want somebody to do it. Throw your cell phone out the fuck a window. Just keep driving. I want to know how far you get and how long you can last before you come back with your bottom lip quivering because you realize that you don't know how to start a fire without a match. You ever think about that? You have to think about how stuck in the matrix you are as you drive to work on a fucking Monday morning. Why do I assume that all of you hate your job?

Speaker 2:          00:01:36       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:01:37       Maybe you love your job. Maybe, maybe you, maybe you love it. Maybe you're like, I like a job. Let me think. I'm going to take some jobs. I think that I would actually, I would actually love, I would love, uh, being a veterinarian. Oh, I dunno about that. Seeing animals in pain, but you can get them out of pain. Then you've got to deal with the weird owners. I wouldn't mind some pet owners. I would be like the, the owners that like, I dunno, they never found love, so now they love their cat. It could just be a really sad place. Right. I think the first thing I would do if I was a vet would be, um, why we're trying to become some sort of specialist. Well, I got to enter through the back of the veterinarian place and I never had to talk to the owners. You know, like I don't want to meet him, you know, Kinda how like I handle people who advertise on this podcast. I never talked to any of them at anytime. They fucking complain. I just give them the money back and then that's it. But I knew I never get on the phone with them. My advertising person will call me, you know, send me an email and just be like, all they want to talk to you about your last read. Uh, do you have any availabilities this week? And I just say, no, I don't.

Speaker 1:          00:02:54       What about next week? I, I don't foresee myself being available ever. If they didn't like to read. I understand it. I mean, forget about what I said derogatory about their product. I bought the fact I can't even read the God damn copy. You know that alone and I just give him a full refund. There you go. One free, awful read for you sir. Enjoy your God damn. Whatever the fuck it is. Just a little queasy. Whatever the hell are you trying to self get. Just so Lilla queasy here. MMM. Well if it makes you feel better. I feel like doing that sometimes too. I feel like just fucking, I don't know what I feel like doing lately. I've just felt like God, I don't know, going to Wyoming, you know, and talk to them. Real people that put their pants on one leg at a fucking time, you know, go out there and talk to some homophobic, racist and all that. I think their neighbor got pro by a fucking alien. How about that for a nice change of pace. Get out there on the open road, fucking run over something and a rental car. You don't even know what it is. Just so far out in the Bush, you don't even know what that fucking ammo was.

Speaker 1:          00:04:13       It wasn't on for fucking legs. You would have thought you hit somebody in a, in a bushy coat. I don't even know what I'm talking about. And you know what, I don't give a fuck cause I just have to get through this thing this week. I just got to somehow Babel for another God damn hour so I can get on with my, uh, I can get on with my day now. What can I talk about here? Uh, Oh, last week I mentioned that I was going back to Boston, right? Going back to Boston for the SPRIG tobe um, I was gonna go back and go to Derek Jeters last game at Fenway. And what ended up happening was I ended up getting busy out here and I, you know, this business

Speaker 1:          00:04:57       show business, it knows when you're going to go do something fun. Oh wait a minute, he's going to go do something for himself. Alright. So I didn't go back Friday and, um, I just, I'm just too fucking busy. So I ended up giving the tickets to a buddy of mine. And, uh, the day I sent them out, all of a sudden Judah said he wasn't playing. And I got to admit for the first time in his entire career, I was upset with the guy. I was like, no, why the fuck would he do that? Everybody went out and spent all that extra money.

Speaker 3:          00:05:26       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:05:26       You know, they want to pay their respects, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. You wait till everybody buys their tickets. Then out of nowhere,

Speaker 4:          00:05:34       Ooh, Ooh, Ooh.

Speaker 1:          00:05:40       You know, I was acting like a fan, a selfish cunt. Fuck what you want to do, Derek Jeter do what I want you to do and your career in a way that's convenient to me. I actually was doing that.

Speaker 3:          00:05:55       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:05:55       Then I kind of watched the highlight of the Yankee game when he hit the walk off. Right. And I was just like, yeah, that's the way it should end. Why was I getting mad at them? That's exactly the way it should have ended. Kinda like Jordan, you hit that last second shot. Granted it was for a championship. That's how it should, it ended. He shouldn't have come back and played for the fucking war, is it?

Speaker 2:          00:06:21       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:06:22       All right. And people were saying how Ted Williams hit that walk off home, run for the red sox. And then he sat out the last three games of the road trip. So, uh, I guess he had a right to do that. But you know what, he ended up coming up anyways. I don't even pay attention to what I've, I, uh, I watched a little clip of it on the Internet is last. Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:06:41       ms last hit, he got an RBI Chapa over the third baseman who was playing in. So I guess there was a runner in scoring position, the runner score. He got an RBI against the red sox. I guess they gave him a nice ovation and all that type of shit. And a I, why is he so, once I read that he was tired, all the media and all of that type of crap, it's just like, you know what? Fuck that this guy has been in the public eye for 20 goddamn years. Okay. He doesn't know anybody, anything. If he wants to blow off the last couple of games, fucking you don't. So whatever. I'm actually oddly sad and melancholy that that guy's career is over. Actually looked at Wikipedia to see if it already said Derek Jeter was a professional football player. Fortunately it didn't. Still said is a professional baseball player cause I guess he hasn't put it in his retirement papers yet.

Speaker 1:          00:07:27       Do you file those afterwards? I have no idea. But um, I dunno. But as country as I was for those like 24 hours when he said he might not play, um, nobody could top the neediness of Keith Olbermann this week. The way he fucking, uh, finesse those stats. I've never seen a guy so desperate for fucking love and acceptance in my life. All I heard after like the first fucking minute of that Keith Olbermann shit was this was a guy he want, he wants everybody to say about him, what they're saying about Derek Jeter. And it's just like, dude, you're not that guy. All right? You had fucking ice cold parents. They didn't hug you. So now you don't even know how to accept the love that you want. So you push it away. That's why you get fired every fucking six weeks. That's why you go on TV and you say stupid things like Mr President shot your mouth.

Speaker 2:          00:08:36       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:37       Oh my God, that guy redefines horses ass. I can't believe anybody even watches that. He comes off like a fucking cartoon character. He was part of his criticism of Derek Jeter was he said he won four championships at the, in his first five years. Right. This is part of his criticism that he won four championships his first five years. He goes, how many did he win the last 14 years? He only won one. Oh, what a piece of shit. He only one five. And you know what, actually, that was great criticism by Keith Olbermann because a lot of people don't realize that not only did Derek Jeter play shortstop for the New York Yankees, he also was their GM and he, um, he made all those decisions to sign the Kevin Brown's to sign that $200 million fuck an albatross that's been hanging around their neck. Alex Rodriguez, a rod right now, although those were all Derek's fucking decisions.

Speaker 1:          00:09:39       Give me a fucking break. That was one of the, um, I don't, I always put that it was actually, he came off like a manager of a wrestler and he was trying to sell a fight, so he was just arguing the other side. He was pulling in like a skip Bayless, Bayless. I couldn't even, Steph almost forgot his name halfway through it. Do you ever do that? And you start to forget the name, but you know, it begins with a baby and he just go with it. Rewind what I just said. Listen how I said Bayless, I could never do that again. Um, male Bayless. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:10:06       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:06       Yeah, that, that guy. Yeah. I Dunno. I just completely lost my fucking train of thought now.

Speaker 2:          00:10:12       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:13       Oh yeah. He completely forgot to bring up that the guy hit 3,400 hits. Forgot to bring all of that up. It was just a,

Speaker 2:          00:10:23       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:10:23       Oh. And then he did that really fucking, uh, taken out of context, cheesy fucking thing where the egos, you know, Derek Jeter is not the greatest Yankee of all time, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And then they fucking show Jorge Posada saying that he's the best, you know, it's, it's his teammate. What do you think he's going to say? You know, if they actually asked Jorge, but do you think that he's fucking, you know, do you honestly think that he's better than Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig and all that? And he would obviously say, look,

Speaker 2:          00:10:56       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:57       You know, I at least I would think he would. He would just say he belongs in the same sentences as those guys. And I wouldn't argue that, you know, I used to think that Derek Jeter was overrated. You know, before I moved to New York. And then once I went to New York and I started watching them rooting against the Yankees every night, and I saw that other shit that he did, three game losing streak, they finally get a rally, somebody gets a hit and the guy's scores. Who's the first guy at the top of the step and the dug out, the fucking captain, all that shit that a guy like Keith Olbermann who's not a fucking team player, Maurice Star project that shot your mouth. Who the fuck would ever have the fucking balls to go on television and reprimand the president. You know, sitting there talking like you're in the Pentagon.

Speaker 2:          00:11:50       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:11:51       I swear to God. Some people, you know, you give him a gel in their hair, you give him a suit and put a camera on him. All of a sudden they think they know shit. Um, so anyways, he was either d the w it'd be, it'd be me, it can't speak. He was either doing that or he was just fucking a,

Speaker 5:          00:12:07       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:07       He was just being a contrarian just to get some ratings because I never watched that guy show. I just don't. Yeah. What happened was the most amazing thing about Keith Overman is how big he is. I mean, when he went on Letterman, Letterman said it like, you are ready. Large man. Like he just fucking gigantic. Like he could have played.

Speaker 5:          00:12:25       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:26       He's like a fucking refrigerator, whether with a head on it. Um, but I haven't said all that, you know, I gotta tell you, fuck Keith Olbermann I've got to be wondering why said all that shit about Derek Jeter.

Speaker 5:          00:12:39       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:12:41       Oh, you know, it was great this week. No, no, no, no, no. Ray Rice Shit. I didn't watch any pregame, but I didn't hear anything about it, which is great that that died down just in time for a month of that pink horse shit coming up already started to see it. Some fucking bottle pink lemonade. Just in case you forgot the last 11 months. There's something out there called breast cancer

Speaker 1:          00:13:04       and it's a bad thing and we need to find a cure just in case you forgot that it exists. We're going to paint everything pink this month. All right. We're going to tell those children in the sweatshops in El Salvador that when they make the pink shit for the NFL may get extra pink this year just in case anybody forgets. Um, oh Jesus. I thought it was going to be in a good mood this week. I'm like extra cunty here. Did you guys watch it in the, any of the, uh, the NFL football? I um, I did my usual, I told you my new thing. I watched the early game and I tape another one. I watched the four o'clock game and I tape another four o'clock game and then I take the Sunday night game and then I watched the one one o'clock one four o'clock. Then I watched the Monday night game and then Tuesday I watched the one o'clock game. Wednesday I watch the four o'clock game. Thursday I'll watch Thursday night football Friday or watch Sunday night football. And then Saturday I watched the college football. It's fucking brilliant. I can't believe how many years I had a fucking DV before I figured out to do that. It's perfect. So this is what I watched this week. I watched the jets versus the lions

Speaker 1:          00:14:22       and I taped the packers versus the bears. And then I, and I, I know what you thinking, Bill, why the fuck? Why didn't you just take the fucking jets game and actually watched the bears packers, one of the oldest rivalries and the national football league. Why didn't you do that? And it's because you know, patriots in the AFC east and I just wanted to see how we would match up against the jets. I've watched them two weeks in a row. I think we're going to have, we're gonna have trouble with them because a, I don't, we had trouble with the Raiders.

Speaker 1:          00:14:56       We lost to the dolphins. We had trouble with the Raiders. The dolphins pounded the fucking Raiders nine. Oh, this is just all horse shit. It's just the first month of the season. But it definitely, uh, I dunno, I'm not feeling too confident about the fucking team and um, I dunno. Rex Ryan is one in three now, one in three. And uh, I dunno, I was talking to Versie versus picking the eagles and the colts to be in the Superbowl this year. And uh, I have no idea. Everybody just Kinda, Seattle blew me away the first week. So did the 40 niners and now both of them are looking kind of, I'm not saying they're bad, but they don't look unbeatable. And, um, I dunno. 40 niners are fucking terrible today as did the, uh, one a fuck Jesus Christ to watch somebody fucking games. Who the hell would they play it? They beat the eagles. The Eagles look terrible today. Fucking Terrell was like, nobody wanted to win the game. I like these are two of the elite teams in, in, in the fucking league. I mean, how many times the 49 is taking all those penalties. Kaepernick.

Speaker 2:          00:16:11       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:16:12       They've got a giant clock. You see the play clock. The fucking guy lets it run down like two, three times during the game. I don't know. I don't fuck ain't no something. The Eagles are the eagles. I don't believe in that. And I don't believe in that quarterback. I just don't, he just doesn't seem like a a, you know what if he goes down, who do you got? You got Mark Sanchez. Alright. Who used to be a jet. So he's got that curse on him and then he went to the fucking eagles. Who did fucking Mark Sanchez piss off that he goes to the two fucking most curse God damn teams in the NFL. Bolton Green. Lots of good thing. He went from the jets to the fucking, uh, he goes, I guess the only good thing about that trade is he didn't have to buy some new boxes.

Speaker 1:          00:17:06       I know, I know. I'm talking a lot of shit this week and as you can tell, I don't know any of the players' names. Anytime I watched the jets all I watch the Brecker Sha fucking Ferguson, that's all the only guy I watched. I just watched a man handle somebody on the outside of the line there. And other than that, I'm just, I dunno, I always get a little bored with football by the end of September because I just absolutely fucking Oh d on it. And uh, but then what the cure is, is now they're going to dress him up like a bunch of new, you know, newborn baby girls for the next month and um, you know, which of course is going to just fucking annoy the shit out of me.

Speaker 2:          00:17:51       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:51       I, you know, this infiltration of the NFL with all of this shit I'm telling you Vic, they're Gunna did just gradually, women are gradually going to take over the NFL. This is my prediction. We're Paul Versey predict Superbowl winners. I like to predict random shit. Like my prediction DePaul is that Rex Ryan is going to have an altercation with a fan this year. I don't think physical, I think he's going to eat, he's going to have a fuck you. Fuck you fight that is going to be caught on camera either as he walks out of a stadium, his or somebody else's or it's going to be outside like a Hooters or a waffle house. All depends. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:18:37       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:18:37       Till one and three,

Speaker 1:          00:18:40       you know the heat's getting turned up and he is uh, that guy's wired, he's got a short fuse. Okay. And I can relate to that. So I know he, he's, people are gonna start saying shit to him and he is going to fucking snap because that's the way he's wired and I don't wish it on the guy, but uh, whatever he says is going to be fucking great and probably put on a t shirt. I don't know if that's going to happen, but I'm predicting that that's one of my, that's my first prediction for this year. If you just want, who's going to fucking, you know, lead the league in rushing you go listen to the verse effect. All right, if you want to hear the fucking, I dunno. Flying saucer Illuminati Shit. You listen to this one. All right. And if something comes in, I'll say I got lucky. That's the difference right now between me, a Goddamn gentlemen and that fucking animal from New Jersey, Paul Versey. Now listen to the verse, the effect. He actually, he's pretty good at picking a Superbowl guy. Super Bowl guy. Superbowl team. All right, so here we go. I guess my first prediction, Rex Ryan is going to have an altercation with the fan, uh, that is going to get him find or at the very least put on TMZ. Alright, number two, my next prediction is over the next 10 years, women will infiltrate, infiltrate the NFL to the point that, um,

Speaker 2:          00:20:01       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:20:02       they, they're going to fucking ruin it.

Speaker 2:          00:20:04       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20:04       They're going to ruin it. I don't understand why they have to be a part of it. Is this sexist? I don't understand. I don't get it. It's a men's football league. Can we just have one thing that gradually creeping in. They got the whole month of October.

Speaker 2:          00:20:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20:27       With the fucking, uh, with the pink stuff. They got that and now, now they got the lace. They got him down on the sidelines. They got to go down to him every fucking 10 minutes. Check in on them. What do you think they ethical well, he, they saying it's a high ankle sprain and he's wincing in pain. He cannot put any weight on it.

Speaker 6:          00:20:50       That's all I got down his side lie.

Speaker 1:          00:20:54       We're already watch Felicia will job. Um, and then eventually they're going to be like,

Speaker 6:          00:21:01       who work here? We be in the booth.

Speaker 1:          00:21:05       Then they'll be in the booth.

Speaker 6:          00:21:08       Why can't there be an all female comic take team?

Speaker 1:          00:21:12       Then there'll be two of them and then it's done. The escape is gone. The escape is gone. What, what do you know what a healthy relationship is? Is, is you got to have time away from each other. See, you miss each other.

Speaker 2:          00:21:28       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:21:29       You got to fuck off the ladies. They got date lane. Women have to be able to take off. Go have a fucking glass of wine with all their girlfriends and then just talk about how lousy and bed you are. They need that. So then they can come back and just fucking deal with you for the next six days. They have to have that and an and and that, you know, guys are no different. Why don't women start their own football league?

Speaker 2:          00:21:55       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:21:55       What, why are they, why are they going to get so much shit for this? Why not? Why do they keep fucking bellying up to our bar? You know, fuck it.

Speaker 6:          00:22:06       Beat it.

Speaker 1:          00:22:10       Look, you know, I'm fucking half joking here. I'm only half joking. Um, do you know how bad I would love to somehow get in a room full of feminist without them knowing that I was a stand up comedy and, and go on, go on a panel.

Speaker 2:          00:22:28       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:22:29       All right. With like those black frame glasses and just starts saying over the top ridiculous shit like I just said. Right. And just, just see how mad I could make them. Oh God. Those are the things I fantasize about. Like if I had the ability, like one of those fucking who, those fucking nerds that nobody understands and they can make fire and ice. You know, they make the, they made like 20 movies. Halle Berry's in it. She has all white hair. The fucking the mutants there. Ooh. Ooh. It's a, it's a fucking metaphor for nerds and racism. I got it. The first 18 of them. Jesus Christ. Just get on with the karate. What the fuck are they called? Not The impossibles. Oh my God. I have no short term memory. I keep thinking the fantastic four, like for some reason I keep picturing them all in blue. What are they called? The expendables, the impossibles, the mutants. I, it'll come to me, whatever. You know what I'm talking about. And then the guy from star trek is one of the guys and he's in a wheelchair. Oh my God. What the fuck are they called? Begins with an eye, doesn't it? Invincible. Whatever. I don't fucking know. I didn't even know. My goddamn point was,

Speaker 1:          00:24:01       this is, this is, this is why I'm a comedian. There's like this destroyed. Can you imagine if I actually had a responsible job? The fuck was I talking about? I was talking about women pissing them off. Oh. Then I said black framed glasses and then that made me thinking of that fucking rex reed guy who's actually a critic on the gong show.

Speaker 2:          00:24:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:24:21       He's not the fantastic four guy, but his last name, his name was reed, wasn't it? I don't fucking know. Speaking a reads, I went to Griffith Park the other day. Every once in a while I'll drive all the way over there. And uh, there was this Asian couple and one had a clarinet and another one had a saxophone.

Speaker 1:          00:24:43       And the woman with the clarinet was killing it and she was standing about 20 feet away from her husband who was blowing fucking claps. All right. Fucking clamps. And uh, it was fucking hilarious to me because I don't know if he was just out of practice or whatever, but it just cracked me up that she was walking away from him because she was playing so nicely. I can only imagine how like the fact that she's actually a musician, how bad his playing must have sound to her pitch perfect fucking ears. But she loved the guy. This is the, I'm just assuming all this, but she loves the guy so she fucking tolerates it, but she, she just steps away a little bit, you know? Fuck you. I know. None of that makes sense, but you know what? You play a clarinet with a read. Okay? I don't know. Saxophone and he got a mouthpiece. Okay. All I know is after you play a while, you've got to blow out the spit. All right, let me, uh, let me do a little advertising here.

So, uh, what did I do this week? Nothing. I just did more writing, more writing, more writing, more writing. And this weekend I have, um,

Speaker 2:          00:30:57       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:30:58       what do I got? I have a Davis Symphony Hall, October 4th. We added a second show. How great is that? I am excited and I'm,

Speaker 2:          00:31:08       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:31:08       we're gonna well, I don't know. I'm going to do stand up all this week. I'm going to go to tighten up everything that I want to tighten up. And this is my first real gig in awhile. And uh, putting a little bit of pressure on myself. Um, San Francisco's a unbelievable comedy town for whatever reason. Who knows why they are a great comedy town. You never know why, why one town's going to be better than the other, but they are one of the best out there. So I can't go up there and yeah, suck. Because those Bergen stocked hippies, no comedy there. I always like going to San Francisco because it's that weird sort of,

Speaker 2:          00:31:45       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:31:46       cross section of people, right? You got the hey man from fucking San Francisco and then you got the absolute animals coming in from fucking Oakland, you know, and then you put them all together. Yeah. And alcohol. And it's, it's a fun show. Everybody gets a chance. Um, I don't even know what I'm talking about at this point. So anyways, yeah, I didn't go back to Boston and I stayed out here and, uh, worked on this fucking thing. I'm trying to get on, on the ground off the ground, I should say. Uh, played a little bit of drums. It's all look at, tell you still fucking with that double pedal. Still struggling along. I'm going to stick. What the, um, you know what? Fuck this. Let's just get to the questions for this weekend. Maybe this'll, this'll, this'll spur something on here. A gambling problem. A dear Billy bets.

Speaker 1:          00:32:36       I get an a. So Billy Batts, I like it. I like it. He has a gambling problem. I get it. I have a gambling problem. Not the kind you think. I've always enjoyed a bet here and there, but never made a life of it. And the last few years I've developed this anxious twitch. Oh, Gigi. Um, I think about what I would bet on and worry about my hypothetical bet the entire game. It's nuts. So that I just place a small bet every now and then to scratch this itch. The thing is, I don't like gambling. It's the thought that scares me.

Speaker 3:          00:33:10       What?

Speaker 1:          00:33:12       So the reverse might be like back in the day when you're old man made you smoke a pack to break the habit thoughts. Oh, I see.

Speaker 5:          00:33:21       MMM,

Speaker 1:          00:33:22       no, I wouldn't gamble dude. If you're already twitching like Fred Flintstone, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad. Anybody almost 50 and remembers that episode. Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad. Fred Flinstone started gambling and he had a fucking problem with gambling and they didn't have gamblers anonymous yet cause he made those episodes and like the fucking early sixties, I think. And um, when Fred Fred started gets spinning out of control, you know, if anybody just said like, hey, you want to put a bet on that? He would just see his eyes would start spinning and he'd go bad, but bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, like freaking the fuck out. It was weird, like he had this unbelievable gambling problem for one episode and then it all went away. It all fucking went away. Um, and that's, you know, something. I've given you guys more goddamn history about the Fred Flintstone shelf. You know, when you really think about it, if you continue to listen to this, this, this, if you go back, I should say, or if you've been listening to it continuously, I think that that's what I was trying to say. I told you how it was based on, I think they, they ripped off the honeymooners.

Speaker 3:          00:34:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:34:27       And then they had that one episode where they will make it fun of the Beatles and Elvis. Well, they were like, bug music. I can't stand bug music. And, uh, what ever happened to that George or boy, I think that was making fun of Elvis because he had kind of fallen off and he was from, he was from Mississippi. Um, anyways, what am I, let's get back to this guy here.

Speaker 5:          00:34:50       Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:34:52       dude, a few ours obviously if you already have a nervous twitch about gambling, why? Like that's like, hey, you know, I fucking sit around and fantasize about killing somebody. Should I go out and just kill one person just so I kind of get it out of my system? No, I think you should. Uh,

Speaker 3:          00:35:11       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:35:11       I Dunno. I don't know what to tell you. That sounds like you need some new age shit. You know, you'd go get hypnotized or something. Um, but I would not start gambling. Gambling is just, it's fucking brutal. Um, gamble. You know what it is about gambling. I get it really?

Speaker 5:          00:35:29       Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:35:31       it takes his soul in a different way.

Speaker 5:          00:35:35       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:35:36       Then say drugs and alcohol

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       do where they like physically,

Speaker 1:          00:35:41       you know, change your appearance and all that type of stuff. You know, you get the gym, blossom knows, or if he'd doing harder drugs and stuff and get emaciated off, you're doing fucking, you know, what, what does that shit that they do out there? And then crystal Meth,

Speaker 3:          00:35:52       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:35:54       you start looking like the petrified version of yourself. Um, gambling. There's just a, uh, I dunno, I had a couple of friends that really had an issue with that and there was just a darkness that was just over them at all times and you went into their place where they lived and you just felt it. You just felt the fucking,

Speaker 3:          00:36:14       uh, yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:36:17       Yeah. So do you consider yourself lucky that you never do and if the worst you ever do is not gamble and just sit there twitching?

Speaker 3:          00:36:24       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:36:26       You got off easy. Believe me.

Speaker 3:          00:36:28       Um, yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:36:32       let's leave it at that. All right. Rex Ryan, I'm actually looking it up right now. Rex Ryan.

Speaker 3:          00:36:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:36:37       I'm going to see if they're already calling for his job in New York media. You know, Rex Ryan, New York Post. Let's see what we get. Let's see what we get. He [inaudible] that, eh? Oh God, nothing yet. I probably looked up the wrong thing. I'm the fucking worst when it comes to this shit. New York Post Sports. Here we go. Hey, you guys like Derek Jeter. We'll go into a broadcasting. I don't think he's going to, I think he's going to fucking fade away in a cool way. Like a Oh shit. Struggling. Gino screams. Fuck you at a fan. After jets fall to the lions fucked. I had the wrong guy, dude. I almost called it g to puts fitting kappa on brilliant career. Ready or not? Here comes a Rod. Oh my favorite Yankee of all time. Oh my God. Greatest thing that ever happened was Alex Rodriguez going to the fucking Yankees. Let's see if they got anything. Jets.

Speaker 3:          00:37:44       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37:44       Um, gang file. It must be bleeping. Act Together. Report card jets having deep problems. Oh, red sox learned from Mariano fiasco. Give Jeter a proper tribute. Oh, did we not give them the right sendoff? I'll go, what the fuck? It's fucking, give me a break.

Speaker 3:          00:38:10       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:38:10       We're supposed to give all of them is send off. Are you guys going to give big PAPI? You're fucking big time. Send off.

Speaker 3:          00:38:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:38:18       Jesus Christ. Fucking wine in New York. Media budget. Goddamn broads. All right, let's get back. Yeah. You know, you learn Shakti with that bad fucking Tupperware party that you through Marianna Rivera. Well, you know what? Thanks to Marianna Rivera, we fucking blow in that Goddamn Gay. We had the greatest comeback and fucking baseball history down three games to none. All right. We gave him his tribute the next year when we were getting our rings when we gave him that big ovation.

Speaker 5:          00:38:51       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:38:51       Oh God. You know something. That's one thing I don't miss about living in New York is that petty shit. They always think that like Boston has issues with New York, you know, which we definitely do, but they got issues with us. So fucking that this kind of even there.

Speaker 5:          00:39:04       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:39:05       Like when we finally won a world series, those policies actually made a t shirt that said 26 to six like we have 26 championships to your six. That's how fucking childish they were. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:39:17       I have to fucking 86 years of rubbing our faces in it. They were going to have one rough winter, right. Couldn't take it head immediately. Whoa. Oh, was that a disgraceful moment? And you're fucking history. Um, all right. Syria, dear general bill need your thoughts. Is Isis horseshit? I mean we know we gave them weapons but they're still, but there's still had to had a need. Jesus price guys, I can't read and then you, you fucking leave out words in the sentence. I mean we know we gave them weapons but they are still had need to be stopped. People please try to proof read this shit but we're not good at stopping anything in that region. You're president and in command, what does the move? Yeah, the mood is we pull out,

Speaker 5:          00:40:14       okay

Speaker 1:          00:40:15       very slowly. This is what we do. This is what we do. The only reason why any of those cons have any fucking money is because nations like us, it's still driving gas combustion engines. So this is what I would do. I would try to jumpstart more a car companies over here like the Tesla company, try to get GM and all those other folks to do the same thing and then we just don't need them anymore and wean ourselves off of oil and then they would just slowly go bankrupt. The entire Middle East, their entire fucking economy is far is my complete lack of research goes this based on the fact that they're sitting on top of oil. So if we just, if we don't need it anymore, what are they going to do? And then they are free to solve their problems, their selves, which they should be doing.

Speaker 5:          00:41:10       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:41:12       And as far as you saying, we're not good at stopping anything in that region. Uh, there's a reason for that. There's a reason why Russia goes into Afghanistan and Lou and loses as a reason why people go into that illusion, why we went to Vietnam and lost. The only way in occupation works, and this is brutally honest, is if you go in there an a, you're, you, you're not leaving.

Speaker 1:          00:41:38       Okay. And B, you commit genocide. That's the only way it fucking works. That's the only way it has ever fucking worked. And it is 100% the wrong thing to fucking do. You can't do that. So, uh, so that's it. You know, so it's just inevitable. They know eventually you're going home. So all they do is go, all right, you beat us, you beat us. And then you walk around standing over there and they just sit there picking you off, making your life fucking miserable. And then eventually you're like, what the fuck are we doing? Hey, let's get outta here. And then you leave. And then they go back to doing whatever, whatever it is that they were doing anyways. But I don't think that we're going to solve anything over there. And I base that on checklists of Aki and Yugoslavia. I didn't know have any idea about any of that shit. Serbs and fucking Croatians and all of the, I had, I still don't quite understand it.

Speaker 1:          00:42:30       That shit was not going on when I was born. There was already checklist Slovakia and there was Yugoslavia and all that type of shit going on over there. And uh, they all had a common enemy enemy in the, with the occupation of the Russians in their country. So they were against them. And when a Russia fell, whatever the fuck that was like 20 years ago, all of a sudden they got their freedom and they immediately picked up this fight for that. It stopped like, I don't know, 60, 70, 8,100 fucking years earlier, and they started killing each other again. Uh, you know, so I mean, you're not going to, it's over. You'd have a better chance at getting Ohio state and the University of Michigan to like each other. Then you will have an all those groups over there get along. They're not going to get along. And um, that's just the way it is. So that's what I would do. I would just fucking,

Speaker 1:          00:43:28       I would do a bunch of shit that would get me whacked way before I would ever achieve it. That's what I would do. You know? It's basically, it wasn't that funny. Jesus Christ. This is becoming too serious here. All right, look, maybe the, maybe this is a, a, a, they maybe this is a nicer one. Commission. Dear Bill, you're the commissioner of the NFL. A fuck. Here we go again. What are the top three things you're doing to improve the league? This, this can include anything from scheduling to punishments to campaigning to relocate a team. What would you do? Oh, Jesus Christ. I don't want this fucking job. One of the top that he thinks I would do to improve the league. Um, I'd get Tony Serra Coosa fucking chair. Did he give enough? This guy's got a fucking stand up the whole God damn game with his back to those animals in the end zone. That's what I would do. I would give them a nice fucking end zone seat and a water cannon. Good. Sprayed all the animals behind them. That's the first thing I would do. Next thing I would do is I would move the kickoffs back to where they used to kick off or I would just eliminate that useless exercise to begin with.

Speaker 3:          00:44:47       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:44:48       And uh, number three, I would call somebody in the MLB and I'd get rid of the DH role. That's what I would do. Those are the three things that I would do to make football better. This is what I was doing. I would, I would, I would, I guess.

Speaker 3:          00:45:04       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:45:05       I would, I would change, um, most of them, the new rules and passing, I would change it back. I would, uh, I liked the, no helmet to helmet. I really liked that rule. I saw a guy diving for a ball and it was passed as outstretched fingers and he couldn't catch it. And this guy back in the day, it would have been helmet to helmet would have coming in perpendicular with a knock this guy out and probably hurt himself in the process too, a little bit down the road. 30 years later when he was done right. Um, and the guy led with his shoulder hit the guy in his chest, definitely fucking brutal hit, but they both got up and we're fine and they didn't fucking rattled their brains too bad. You know, I'm sure the brain's still moves around, but I do like that rule. But, um, I dunno. I Dunno what the fuck I would do. I don't fucking know. I get Tony Serra Goose, they're fucking chair. And then I would step down and just say, my work is done. Would that be okay? I wouldn't, you know what I would do? I would eliminate, um, the expression, uh, get it right. I would eliminate that because it makes everybody sounds stupid.

Speaker 1:          00:46:15       You know, we've got to Gary, why we didn't get it right. Good job. We're going to get it right. Get it right.

Speaker 3:          00:46:22       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:46:22       Jesus fucking Christ. Maybe that's like fucking like cavemen could come up with a better soul. Rah Rah, go rogue. Just fucking not saying anything that drives me. I fucking hate that expression.

Speaker 1:          00:46:42       Get it right. All right, let's move on to the next one. Jesus Christ. This is just scatterbrained this week. All right? Can't get laid a bill. I'm a huge fan. I listen to all your podcasts and stand up. Now that I'm done sucking your Dick. I love what you guys just can't give me a fucking compliment and then you feel all uncomfortable because you actually enjoy the comp though. The fucking podcast. Just be a man and give me a God damn compliment. You know, suck. You are uncomfortable. I'm not uncomfortable. I enjoy the praise. He says I need some advice. So I'm starting my Sophomore Year of college and I've never been more depressed. My high school girlfriend broke up with me shortly after graduation and I haven't gotten laid sense. Uh, it's not like I stay in my room all day. I have friends and I go to parties at least once a week.

Speaker 1:          00:47:26       And even though I never enjoy it, even though I never enjoy, I just can't get a girl to be interested in me. I also have no idea what I want to do after college. And so I have no motivation to apply myself. The only reason I haven't dropped out is because my parents who are paying thousands and thousands of dollars, uh, I don't drop out, so they won't be disappointed. I work out every day and I try to stay busy, but most of the time I just feel terrible. I'm hoping you have some advice for me. If not, go fuck yourself. And if you do, thanks and go fuck yourself. All right. Um, well you obviously you have a sense of humor. Um, what would my advice be? Ah, you know what? I think you're trying too hard. All right. There's no reason to go to a party and not have a good time,

Speaker 2:          00:48:11       okay?

Speaker 1:          00:48:12       Just go there and enjoy yourself. Don't worry about talking to women. Don't worry about trying to get laid. Just have a good time. Just enjoy yourself. Just go out in life and just fucking enjoy yourself, okay? People are attractive to positive energy and somebody having a good time, it makes them want to be around you. And next thing you know, somebody's blowing you. I don't understand why the universe works that way, but it does. I know I am overly simplifying this, but um, you know, it's good that you know that you're depressed. I was depressed for about 20 years. It didn't realize it cause I was so used to feeling that way. I thought it was just the normal, you know, just a normal state of things. Um, I got to tell you this dude, you are going to get a girlfriend and you're going to find love and you're going to get married. Okay? But I gotta tell you there's a fucking misery that comes to that life. All right? This is a great thing, but there's also a misery and she feels it fucking too, and that's a part of you. You're the individual, you dies. So right now, dude, you are the 40 year old you, it's going to look back at the fuck. If the 40 year old you could get in a time machine and sit down with you right now and give you a fucking pregame speech before you went to that party. I mean that would be like scared straight. He'd be right in your face.

Speaker 2:          00:49:38       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:49:39       You know you're out there.

Speaker 2:          00:49:41       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:49:42       Well if I have to get up at five in the morning to change his shit it diaper, you get to sleep 10 hours a fucking day. You can't put a smile on your face when you go to a fucking party single. You could fuck anything that walks.

Speaker 2:          00:49:55       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:49:56       You go down to that seven Elana luck. I bet you go down to that seven 11 you get yourself a box of fucking condoms. You stick on. Will you stick one in your pocket?

Speaker 2:          00:50:06       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:50:06       Prepare for success. You are on your goddamn shirt. You get down there. You have a good fucking time. All right? You're only going to be this age once you say something like that. All right?

Speaker 1:          00:50:21       I'm telling you, you're only going to be used age once you're in college, dude, you are at like your, it's like you won the NBA draft lottery. Women there are in the prime of their fucking life. Most of them are fucking single. It's gonna happen for you. But if you're walking around and you're depressed and you're carrying that with you, if you're moping around like that, that makes people fucking, you know, not want to be around you. So I would say is probably not a good thing because that is a depressant. So scratch that. I can't remember if I fucking told you to, to, to have a couple of beers. I wouldn't do that. I would just fucking enjoy yourself. I almost, you know what I would do? I would go do some shit for you. Fuck. Trying to get a girlfriend. Fuck. Trying to get laid. Fuck all of that. Just go out and what do you want to do if you don't know what you want to do, go out and go try a bunch of different things and have a good time. [inaudible] g a single.

Speaker 3:          00:51:16       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:51:16       Okay. You don't have to fucking do, you don't have to fucking deal with trying to figure out what's gonna make them happy. Okay. Cause as far as I can fucking tell, there isn't anything that's gonna make them happy for a longer than maybe a day. The amount of shit that you can do for them. And as you can tell, she's a couple of rooms away. The amount of shit that you can fucking do for him and all it does is by a couple of days of happiness is just fucking baffling. And I gotta be honest with you, a lot of women look at it guys and they think that we're fucking stupid. And I think part of it is because they have the way their brain works, that multitasking, whatever it is. That shit talk that they always say, you know that women can multitask and guys can't. Well, I would say that generally speaking, this is very general. I think men have an advantage when it comes to just being happy. You know what I mean? Like you wouldn't know it from my podcast and the way I talk and shit, but I'm happy. I'm happy as hell and I've been happy for a long fucking time. You know? All I need dude outlets, all I fucking need the NFL package. I got a six a fucking millers in my, in my God damn refrigerator.

Speaker 1:          00:52:42       You know, I got a new pair of sneakers that just some stupid bullshit like that. I order a fucking pizza. That's all I need. I'm happy the whole fucking day. You know? I go on a hike with my dog in the morning. That's it. I'm good. Just simple, simple, stupid shit. Keeps me as a guy entertained. I don't have their high level brain that they're always talking about near ability. I can do a thousand fucking thanks. Yeah. And he'll get you. You're miserable. You're fucking miserable.

Speaker 3:          00:53:14       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:53:14       So telling you, dude, you're actually, you don't realize it, but where you are right now do is you are in an absolute utopia. Do you know how many fucking guys right now would kill to be in your position? They'd even take two years and not getting laid. Who gives a fuck? Rub One out. Get on with your God Damn Day.

Speaker 3:          00:53:36       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:53:37       You know, get on with your fucking day of being single, not having the answer to anybody and having the option of hitting on any beautiful woman that catches your eye. Take a trip anytime you fucking want. Go wherever you want to go. Do whatever the fuck dude, you're never going to get from your parents are paying for your fucking education. Dude, you're never going to be freer.

Speaker 1:          00:54:01       All right? So start looking at your life that way. And I'm telling you, you're going to have a different fucking vibe. And I, um, I, I, you know, I'll tell you right now, you start doing that good days. You're going to happen in the national football league. No, I'm serious dude. As something good is going to happen, but there will be a time in your fucking life. I'm telling you where you will be married, you'll have kids and you'll do that whole fucking thing. And that will be its own sort of utopia. But it's, it's, I don't do it. This is a very beautiful, selfish time in your life that you should embrace.

Speaker 3:          00:54:34       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:54:34       And you should not, uh, you should not spend it feeling bad about yourself. All right? So they go. Good luck to Ya. Okay. Relationship problems. All right, Bill, first of all, I would like to say thank you for all the podcasts. Now go fuck yourself. There you go. That's how it's done. Beautiful. All right, well I'm in my early twenties, soon to be the youngest regional manager in my company. So I kind of feel that I am moving in the right direction. My biggest problem right now has to be commitment, a relationship. My girlfriend and I have been together for about six months now. So we are seeing how things work. Uh, it was all, so we're seeing how things work, right? Let's guys must have spoken to his phone. Um, well lately these things, uh, things have not been too great. She, she complains about everything.

Speaker 1:          00:55:24       If I'm not home or out with the boys or the gym or if I don't respond to one simple text, her jealousy is really taking its toll on me. Whenever she sleeps at night, she'll talk for hours on how much she hates work and just fuss about how I don't do this or how, like how come I do that? It's fucking annoying. I have not cheated on this woman nor I have. I put myself in any type of physical situation with her. So why the burden? Well, I hate to add more, but here it is. My biggest issue with her, it has to be here son. Yes. Her son, he is turning four in a few months, but it's such a pain. I know he is a child. Blahblahblah but this child doesn't know how to talk, use the restroom and thinks screaming for everything and throwing a fit.

Speaker 1:          00:56:08       We'll get what he wants. Is this her fault? Uh, yes. This is what this guy says, Bill. I am a father as well. My soon to be five year old son is annoyed by this kid to during your early twenties and you've got a five year old son, Jesus Christ. Um, whenever we go out, her son tries to take all my son's toys and then chooses what he wants to watch and what he wants and when he wants to leave. I suppose my question to you is, should I simply continue to help her out be with her slash be with her? She is the breadwinner for her family, supporting her mother who just had a baby and is unemployed. Dude, is this a Jerry Springer transcript and two younger brothers plus her son? Financially, she's in a hard place so I help her out when I can. I feel guilty leaving. I'd feel guilty if I left or right now since I know she's very attached to this relationship and it may affect her and I wouldn't want everyone else to suffer. Should I say fuck it. It's not worth my unhappiness and my son's discomfort towards her son or say, just say fuck it. Ride it out until her mom finds a job or she trains that little animal of a child. Right? All right,

Speaker 1:          00:57:18       here's the deal, dude.

Speaker 1:          00:57:20       You fucking said something about three quarters the way through it. First of all, you know, with all this stress she has in her life, supporting all those other people, probably has a lot of the reason why she's fucking coming at you. Uh, she's taken out of situation on you and a little, a little way, I guess there, but you said, uh, where is it? I feel guilty and assets. I know she's very attached with it, blah. Should I say fuck it. It's not worth my unhappiness and my son's discomfort. All right, dude. So you're unhappy in your own son is not comfortable. All right. I think that says something right there. That's what you need to fix right there. You need to be happy and your son needs to be comfortable or you have to leave and it's not your fault, you know, you know, she lives with carnival people from your description. All right? Um, you got to be selfish in a fucking relationship when you're single. Okay. And you're, you're going to commit to somebody before you commit with them. You got to be selfish. You got to be making sure, at the very least, you being with them makes you happy. Ah, that sounds like a fucking nightmare. That situation right there. Sounds way I waited until I was 45 to get fucking married. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:58:40       so I guess what I would say is if you feel like you could somehow, I mean not leaving, not breaking up with somebody because you feel like it's a bad time. It's never a good fucking time. I'm, all she's doing is getting more and more attached to you and all you're doing is taking more and more days away from her where she could be going out trying to find somebody else. So if, uh, that is not a reason to stay. So if you feel like you could try and work it out, you didn't mention once in any of that, that you loved her. So, um, I dunno, that sounds about it. As miserable as situation as I can think of.

Speaker 5:          00:59:21       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       So, uh, you know, but at the end of the day, [inaudible] day, it's going to be your decision, but that relationship is definitely not firing on all cylinders. And if you're going to stay with this team, you need to create a new culture in the locker room. All right. Prosper lending. Little advertising here, Prosper.

Speaker 5:          00:59:42       Okay.

Um, I want to thank everybody for the, uh, all the ticket sales up there in San Francisco. Um, I'm really looking forward, you know, I need it, man. I haven't done a standup road gig in a while and uh, I've been doing that for 22 years. And you do the road as long as well, I really started traveling, um, seriously doing the road rather than just driving around doing a hell gigs outside of Boston.

Speaker 1:          01:03:57       Uh, probably been doing that for like 17 years, right? Yes, 17 years. So, um, you know, it's in my blood, man. I got to do it. So the next, the next three dates I have coming up, uh, Davis Davies kept saying David's Davies Symphony Hall in San Francisco, two shows this Saturday night, October 4th. Then I'm doing this spotlight spotlight casino in Coachella, California, October 11th. And then my next date is at West Palm Beach Improv on November 14th, because I'm going to a couple of football games out there, going to the Thursday night game and then I'm going to go see, uh, the Miami University of Miami against Florida state, which is hilarious because I'm going to have to fucking listen to them doing that Tomahawk Chop Shit. Oh my God. Um, but anyways, so I don't have a lot of road dates cause I've been trying to write this show and then also I'm trying to put together the new hour before it hit the road.

Speaker 1:          01:04:59       And, um, so basically if you're wondering how the next year is shaping up as I'm finally going to do that Australian tour, then I'm going to do some club dates at some of my favorite standup clubs around the country and uh, get that act ready to go. And then I'm going to do a nice theater tour and, um, I am hoping to do another European tour. And this time actually add, um, along with the all the countries I did before I went to try to do an eastern European leg this time to like, Lithuania, Estonia, Albania, all of that shit. Um, I'm going to try to just see how that goes. Why not, right? Why the fuck not so, um, I'm really looking for, I'm already looking forward to the new year. October is coming up, right? I gotta get my pie crust game together. Make my fucking Pumpkin bread, you know, all fucking purpose flour a.

Speaker 1:          01:05:54       Anyways, that's the podcast for this week. Everybody, I apologize. I know it was a little rocky this week, but um, if I didn't do it right now, I wouldn't be able to do it in the morning. So, uh, anyways, what are we going to do here? Uh, y'all got knocked out. I didn't get right. Next week I'm going to try. You go right? I have no one to blame, but myself and I take full responsibility. That's a podcast for this week. Go fuck yourselves.
