Speaker 12:         00:07:24       That this guy had 17 fuckin TV shows. Anyways I could really get into that to be honest with you.

Speaker 10:         00:07:35       Who's getting who I'm not a mogul. I'm just fucking lazy and I don't know. I think there's just two types of people as they get older there's the person that just you know takes up cycling in rock climbing and they take like a fuckin glass blown class of some shit you know and then there's other people being like you know what I fuckin tired man. You know I like to chill if I get another forty nine years or whatever I get. You know I'm on the back nine. Who's kidding who. Forty nine times two is 98. I want to make one hundred staying positive. Who can do.

Speaker 13:         00:08:08       All right like I'm on the 12th hole.

Speaker 15:         00:08:22       It's fucking horrible.

Speaker 14:         00:08:24       I would actually thoroughly enjoy and I would just enjoy it if you had that kind of loot if redo an old fucking beautiful car like that.

Speaker 12:         00:08:33       You restore it you bring it back to life and then you just in the back you know you got you got you know you got a little humidor some fuckin cigars you know couple of your favorite little fuckin accoutrements being the booze there and you just fuck it whatever it is.

Speaker 16:         00:08:52       Drive around Well whatever your driver's name is you still column James every fucking every chauffeur was always named that would be great. You want to go to the movies. You know I drink too much already man. There's no way I can handle always having a designated driver I begin fuckin steward go into the supermarket.

Speaker 10:         00:09:14       Speaking of which Billy no fun. Oh Jesus Jesus Christ was seven days in seven fucking days and last night he had a couple glasses of wine. We went out with another couple. What am I supposed to do. Everybody you know have an Italian meal and I suppose I have a little Borroloola.

Speaker 16:         00:09:31       What am I supposed to eat a couple of those you know and I don't even fucking like mine. It's just it's just it's always reminding you of the hangover it's gonna give you. Turns your teeth Grey. But I actually enjoyed. That's the one wine that I like. I really enjoyed it last night and I was actually going to order a whiskey but I always said the referee. The waiter forgot to come back and asked me at that point I was just like fuck this I'm just going to stay with the wine and then tonight my family took me out for Father's Day and they had one whisky and I oh man I got a fucking good one right. I got a really good 28 years old and then I went outside to return a phone call and I'd set the glass down I came back and one of my red lines had bumped the table and said they knocked a little bit out and I didn't think there was that much and then I looked down there was this big puddle of it. I was like fuck. That was 28 years old. I mean the back of my head I was like Oh that's good because I'm trying not to drink anyways but I was 28 years old the shit poured in a glass. I sipped it and then somebody came by. Boom hit the table. And then there was a puddle of it.

Speaker 9:          00:10:41       He spent 20 years in a fuckin barrel to be spilt on the floor and then cleaned up with a rag. That's a travesty. I felt my liver crack but it was good because then I had the perfect amount of booze and I was fine. So I don't know.

Speaker 17:         00:10:58       I know you guys were in a you know collecting a little chippy poos there.

Speaker 18:         00:11:03       You know just five days sober you know give you a little cookie.

Speaker 9:          00:11:11       Got you down there. There's no way even if I was like a full on fucking algae like I'm in Tripoli of alcoholism I never got called up to the big show I'm basically like Kevin Costner in bull durham except I'm drinking that would annoy me.

Speaker 16:         00:11:30       Going to AA and give me my stupid chip like that's what I'm like I'm supposed to be fuckin chasing these things I get too much of a contrarian in me. That's the new word for cunt by the way. Yeah I'm a bit of a canary a canary a contrarian a bit of a contrary. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 12:         00:11:48       You you're you're difficult. You're a cunt. You know. Your fucking pain in the ass.

Speaker 1:          00:11:55       You're the kind of guy off the fucking jet went down. You're the fucking guy you're the guy that would get us killed. We'd all be fucking sick now if we survive.

Well wait feet are slowly dying in the air. There there's a new nourishment for the rest of this fucking walk down this snowy god forsaken tundra.

Speaker 12:         00:12:24       Anyway sorry.

Speaker 1:          00:12:28       The fuck my topic and so. So we go to the car show. None of the fucking restaurants are open fuck the dads. It's like food trucks. Nobody gives a you know what's funny though. I didn't give a shit. My wife was upset.

Speaker 19:         00:12:39       Are we don't of these places are open.

Speaker 3:          00:12:45       She's like you are right with us again. I don't give a shit. I don't give a shit.

Speaker 1:          00:12:49       You know I really don't. I am I am I am the way I'm wired like a guy I walked around I looked at some shiny cars I'm happy it's hot as shit let's get back in the car go home.

Speaker 12:         00:13:01       I'm fine. Completely fine. Brunch.

Speaker 1:          00:13:04       That's that's some you shit turning this whole fucking thing into a whole day. Yeah. Father's Day lead it.

Speaker 12:         00:13:13       I had to buy the perfect Father's Day and then I say I started my day with fuckin no fun.

Speaker 8:          00:13:23       Billy I can wake up now like super early and I finally have a little drum space about 20 ways. A little a little Jesus Christ came to tuck a little ways away for like 20 minutes away from my house. I got a little rehearsal studio right. You can just rent them.

Speaker 16:         00:13:41       And I got the smallest fucking one I could buy stretch out I can touch the walls on all sides and I got this little fuckin that little sonar kit that I bought the martini kit 16 inch based bass drum which cracks me up because I was playing that giant Bynum one that had a 26 inch fuckin bass drum. And I'm trying to you know.

Speaker 1:          00:14:03       Just go in a completely different direction after all of these goddamn years of just fucking trying to ape everything that he did and I just I it just hit me one fucking day I told you what if one day I just sat there and he said What is this fucking guy came back to life and he came walking into my house I keep saying this on the podcast right. And I was just like hey hey man John Bonham Holy shit. I'm a big fan of yours come in and look at my drum kit. I had his exact drum kit right down to the Rogers high hat.

Speaker 14:         00:14:36       He would have looked that he would have slowly backed out of the fucking room.

Speaker 8:          00:14:39       And what was funny is now I'm going down this whole fucking rabbit hole you know I'm listening to Pantera and fucking Primus and Miles Davis figure that one out listening to all his fucking great drummers from Philly Joe Tony Williams to fucking Jack D and I just listen to these fucking geniuses and trying to get something else in my fucking head and through reading up on Tony Williams I went down this fucking rabbit hole full of I don't know how many hours on the Internet just trying to have all these tracks I was listening to and trying to see if I could. There's so many tracks where Tony is just killing it live and they just won't show him. It's so fucking annoying that we show showing miles of coal train of fucking nicotine in political train miles of fuckin was it shorter that he played with. I don't know if they're always showing those guys yes. It's like if everybody else stops playing they'll finally fucking show him. It's annoying but you know typical they never show the drummer. That's why I love the Romantics. When I was a kid and what I like about you came out and I finally got the drummer was singing. The drummer sang then there would be on a hotel california with Don Henley. You'd see the drummer the whole fuckin time. Other than that you were shit out of luck.

Speaker 11:         00:16:05       So anyways I ended up when you read about Tony that leads to Billy carbon which leads to fucking eventually you know I don't know Vinny called Uta and Steve Smith and all these fucking guys and then they start talking about the guys they listen to and then you go back around again. It's amazing.

Speaker 8:          00:16:22       So I end up finding this quote that really made me feel good about getting rid of the drum kit that I did. Cause sometimes I think I and I always wanted that Kit and I finally fucking had it. And then I just always think Yeah and you sat down and played it and you sounded like you. So it was too fucking big for you and you have all these other ideas why don't you go pursue those and I just stumbled on this quote by Vinnie calling you to write. That's actually transcends playing drums you can apply this to anything he says. This is what he was trying to find his own style. He said I went through periods where I tried to imitate Tony and Billy. That's Tony Williams a Billy cop. He goes by eventually realized how dangerous it was basically trying to imitate those guys.

Speaker 1:          00:17:03       He goes I began to ask myself what am I saying. I wasn't saying anything. It had been said before and that a reason for being said. But I didn't have a reason. I wasn't making a statement. I was just repeating it like a parrot by imitating and copying someone else. A person becomes a parrot. I saw the trap and I knew as great as those guys were and still are that I had to find my own voice and I was like God damn it.

Speaker 3:          00:17:29       Look at that. That applies to stand up comedy that applies to fucking washing cars. Do you want to be one of the greats. You know how many times can you watch Mr me argue.

Speaker 9:          00:17:41       Do the wax on wax off before you're going to fucking break out of then come up with a new way to do it right.

Speaker 16:         00:17:49       I don't want to tell you I'm just happy that I got this place so I wake up now because you know the way my daughter sleeps she sleeps in these four hour chunks so she finally falls asleep you know around 2:00 in the morning after she slept for my you know eight to 12 then she'll be up for an hour and a half or some shit and then she sleeps till like 7 my wife feeds her and then she goes back to sleep again until 10:00. So that window right there from seven to 10. Now I've just been jumping in the car drive 20 minutes down the street nobody's up there's no musicians over that place you know they're just getting done doing blow they're going home you know they're like 8:00 in the fucking morning and I get to play for like a nice solid hour having the time of my fucking life.

Speaker 11:         00:18:34       I don't know why I didn't do this for myself years ago and it never dawned on me to do it. I was always trying to play him in the fucking house and trying to find quiet ways to do it because he was kidding. Drums are fucking annoying other unless you're the person playing him.

Speaker 16:         00:18:52       So I finally got this place and um I'm beyond psych so we'll see we'll see what this little kid leaves to me but I know whatever I'm just saying it was a great Father's Day. So we went out tonight and then got a nice framed picture of me hold my beautiful daughter and I could not be having my arms around her anymore and she looks content is how it was an instant classic of kissing her on the cheek and I got it framed and looking at right now sitting on my desk I'm fucking psyched.

Speaker 3:          00:19:22       So Happy Father's Day Father's Day to all the fathers out there. You know if you used to play drums you want to play him again go get one of those. Get that fucking that Quest Love little break beats set go find some fucking studio space.

Speaker 10:         00:19:39       Cause you're like one twenty five twenty bucks a month who gives a fuck you know go get it go down there bring your fucking you know or find a studio space like you know where I used to play I never used to say they said he wanted but he bugged me down there.

Speaker 16:         00:19:53       The best place that I found out here in L.A. You don't have time to get a drum kit knowledge shit but if you just want to go play someplace is Cascade studios down on Santa Monica just east of Highland it's the shit it's fucking clean the drunk it's a great and it was the first class place and I went to a bunch of places that was the best place that I've found so free plug there. And speaking of that. Speaking and oh by the way everybody keeps telling me to watch the fucking Lakers sceptics documentary thing that they got on ESPN so I have to check that out but before I do that. Before I do that if I get fucked up to get the podcast that podcast I fucked up the password you know complex these things have to be now you know I you know I hate when you fucking put a nice easy one in and then they just say to you like oh yeah that's not that's not good enough it's not fucking good enough it's like well why don't I determine that why are you acting like I'm in the Pentagon I don't give a fuck you know what I mean.

Speaker 8:          00:21:02       Oh you know it's hilarious too now I gotta I'm out of my Bonham phase I still play to some Zeppelin today I'm like a lady when I was over there but somebody show me his fucking remember that car and the song remains the same.

Speaker 16:         00:21:18       That crazy look and I don't know who made it forward or some shit that he had that oh that crazy paintings and stuff like that.

Speaker 11:         00:21:27       You know you always wonder what happened to that shit if somebody bought it and then somebody else bought it and now it's up for sale.

Speaker 12:         00:21:33       It's like two hundred and fifty fucking grand you know he's gonna buy that thing. I'm on a Jimmer say.

Speaker 20:         00:21:42       The Colts. I think that guy's gonna end up having.

Speaker 1:          00:21:49       Like the equivalent of Jay Leno's car collection. He's gonna have that with musical artifacts. I mean the guy's getting to the point where he can kind of fuck with the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He's got like a prince guitar. He's got Jerry Garcia's guitar. They had John Bonham Carr.

Speaker 12:         00:22:06       I mean that really adds to the collection. Then you put your fuckin Prince's guitars and all this Charlie Parker saxophone whatever the fuck else that guy owns in the back yes some hookers come over he starts doing blow whatever the fuck it is he does it make it could be a good time.

Speaker 1:          00:30:35       I'm on the road again. Boom boom boom boom.

Speaker 16:         00:30:38       I'm doing the roast of David or TS this week Thursday. And you know I've got to figure out I don't do that.

Speaker 1:          00:30:47       I'm not saying this guy walk a walk. But this bubble bobble yada yada yada. You know those fuckin roast jokes for summarizing the format of roast jokes is still from the 1950s. I don't understand why that is. I have to figure out how to do this shit.

Speaker 21:         00:31:06       So-and-so is here you know.

Speaker 1:          00:31:08       Last time I saw I had like dad and a fucking wagon wheel well I well you know they still use that except the young guys. Now they all say AIDS and cunt and fuck and it just it's just so over the top. You know 9/11 it's always like I gotta figure out how the fuck to do this and I only have four days to do it. And of course I'm busy as shit so I don't know what to do here.

Speaker 16:         00:31:33       So but this is the last thing if I just get past this which I will either by doing a good job a mediocre job or eating my fucking balls on it. The bottom line is it's over. You know it's it's a 12 minute spot. I just have to get if I get past this fucking roast the rest of I'm gonna eat the rest of my year. It's downhill.

Speaker 1:          00:31:56       Billy no fun is saying no to everything.

Speaker 5:          00:31:59       What do you what what is it. I can't make it now.

Speaker 23:         00:32:02       Can't do it. Nah nah nah not gonna throw it at me like that fuckin buzzard way back a little thought but they put up a lowball put him in that bashful buzzard on Bugs Bunny. No. The whole market though.

Speaker 16:         00:32:18       That's gonna be me. I have to start fucking doing that because yeah it's not good. It's just too much shit. And I am I'm again now with the kid. I'm fuckin I'm exhausted. It's 9 22 at night and I was ready for bed two fucking hours ago. It's just my cutie pie doesn't fall asleep till about 9:00 and you know what's great about no booze you sleep like a fuckin baby. I mean booze will put you to sleep but the next morning you wake up and you're just like you know you wake up you feel you should be tied to a chair. And there's some guy just waiting for you to come around to continue interrogating you by punching you in the head and then you realize like now I punched myself in the head with all those fuckin drinks. So I'm actually really enjoying it despite the fact that I drank the last two nights. I have one tonight and half of it's spilt on the fucking ground. All right. Fucking judge me.

Speaker 7:          00:33:19       All right I decide. I'm in my own AA okay. I still earned a chip today.

Speaker 24:         00:33:27       I just feel like for me having my own AA is a good thing.

Speaker 3:          00:33:32       Speaking of for me in reality show stars you're not going to fucking believe who I think was at that car show today. We're walking around we're looking at Dave it's fucking this two to a Cadillac that I swear to God was like it was like two town cars put together incredible fucking car. Gigantic Oh my God I saw this one Jaguar you know the one that the early that one of their had in the 60s with the long fucking Hood not the one from the 50s that Sinatra had that one the James Bond era one you know the one and the patched back open like a fuckin regular door.

Speaker 15:         00:34:14       This guy showing it off he's got the back door open and then the hood opens like the reverse way you know from the windshield out looks cool as shit and then I look in there he's got like some small box small block Chevy engine in there you know I don't know if that's what you want to fucking do I don't know why you would do that. Anyways I walk around looking at those cars and all of a sudden there's there's these people on like they're giving out awards to cars and shit and there's these listeners this person on the microphone going I think that's Caitlyn Jenner I think Caitlyn Jenner's hand I was like no fucking way I gotta go seek I gotta go see Katie I gotta go see when by the time we got there.

Speaker 25:         00:34:59       I'm not even sure if I was but like has said that Bruce it gets confusing she sees she said she's really into cars so I got confused saying like ah it was was he not into it and then can that happen.

Speaker 1:          00:35:17       Do your hobbies change then I know what she was saying like no he was into him he's always been into him and now he's become Caitlyn days wants it transferred what's the fucking word you're supposed to say transitioned helicopter November 1 5 3 Sierra hotel on with you information Bravo requesting token transition through transition to you know being Caitlyn but the hobbies stay the same.

Speaker 12:         00:35:57       There you go. Who would know that I would think you'd take up some other hobbies right. Maybe you wouldn't I got to look this up.

Speaker 26:         00:36:08       I got to look this up. This is fucking weird because I know you take hormones and stuff right. So does that make it any other shit. It's fine it's fascinating you know and you know it's funny is they're going to keep doing the same way they're doing the plastic surgery where you know it's gonna keep looking better and better and better. You know what I mean.

Speaker 16:         00:36:27       Same way you know everything keeps getting better and better and better except for the fucking environment you know.

Speaker 1:          00:36:33       Oh by the way I did a fuckin benefit the other night and flea was in the crowd. I can't fucking believe I didn't give him a shout out for giving a shit about BS. That was one of the few positive things I saw about the environment last year was that fleas somehow got it you know fleas of the fucking bees are dying off and fleas shows up like a goddamn hero and it gets into these beekeepers stuff. He's got the whole suit and everything I saw this whole article on it. Any he sees hooking up like a little like there was like ten thousand of them hanging out in his backyard. You know.

Speaker 10:         00:37:11       What's funny is that's one of those things your neighbors would be annoyed at because they don't understand photosynthesis I don't know where that fuckin word came from but I literally I think I I think I used it correctly this and that when the bees go from flower to flower and stuff gets on their cute little feet you know that cute little beefy you know. And then they pollinate shit inadvertently.

Speaker 12:         00:37:37       They're out there running errands for the queen. Right. The Queen Bee. The fuck was I talking about. Oh my God look this shit up.

Speaker 27:         00:37:47       When you transition to your hobbies.

Speaker 28:         00:37:57       Change fucking list. Am I gonna get put on looking this shit up.

Speaker 1:          00:38:01       Come on man don't do this to me. Come on internet. Come on internet can you fucking work for once in your life you fucking cunt. Can you believe someone who can't even get Internet in his whole house is talking about having a chauffeur. I mean how fucking first world country is that. Habit change is easy when people move into a house.

Speaker 25:         00:38:23       For strategies to change your habits.

Speaker 29:         00:38:26       Well they're not specific enough. This has to be I have to be wrong.

Speaker 31:         00:39:01       Good on you Bruce way to get those fuckin cars because I'm still digging a that's fucking amazing.

Speaker 16:         00:39:10       You know I hope someone I know fucking transitions. I want to see that whole goddamn thing.

Speaker 6:          00:39:14       You know someone's got it something it's it's gotta be something all right.

Speaker 10:         00:39:22       Does your preference a color change if you'd taken hormones like your fucking would like the chemicals right. Is it it fucking amazing how I just refuse to read about shit and I just continue to ask questions while answering them. But this is how I come to conclusions and then I can somehow legally get on stage with the microphone and do a fucking podcast. I can't imagine how many people who used to be men and are now women are just slapping their female for head their transition for head right now listening to me as I'm talking of I apologize to anybody out there transitioning I don't fucking mind what I think that you because she said she's really into cars doesn't take a night to trip me up that's all I'm saying.

Speaker 1:          00:40:06       All right let's read some shit here. Right. Mute Math and cold bear Hey Billy boom bap. But boom boom back. Thanks for putting me onto mute math. Oh my God they're fucking amazing fucking incredible band. They've got a brand new album out. Whatever you could say they got some brand new shit that you can download through the fucking air and capture it on your device. Share it with your friends. Man this guy says I've seen the name before but never listened and they are all caps fucking dope. Just bought a ticket to see them on their tour in September. Dude you are not going to be disappointed they are fucking as good as their band. Their albums are their fucking incredible life. Fucking incredible band.

Speaker 25:         00:40:55       And then he said to me. Told me to check out these bands it says check out Big Data in Portugal. I don't understand this next sentence it says the man karma.

Speaker 1:          00:41:07       I think you might dig them. Is the man also a band. I'll look it up. All right. If my internet hasn't shut down after that last stupid fucking search keep drumming and make Stephen keep drumming and making Stephen Colbert uncomfortable. Oh I did the Stephen Colbert show last Thursday aired Friday. I wasn't making him uncomfortable. He enjoyed it. I had a great time with him. He's a.

Speaker 8:          00:41:30       I met him briefly one time at some benefit but he's a really good dude it was fucking amazing to go back and do that show because that's where Letterman used to tape and it's still fucking ice cold in there. It's still roughly like the same setup and it's just weird because Cobain's desk is over where the band is and I talk to him you know during the break I go out.

Speaker 16:         00:41:54       I was just crazy being over here.

Speaker 10:         00:41:58       You know I did stand up on Letterman like 4 5 times and this is where I always look over and Felicia and Paul Schaefer Anton Fig all the whole band was over there and now the desk is here and he said that he asked Letterman where he should put the desk and Letterman said on the right side saying that he always wanted to sit over there but Johnny sat over there. So out of respect he sat on the other side.

Speaker 8:          00:42:24       That's how much you know the level of respect that wasn't just amazing story. The level of respect that Letterman had for Carson and why wouldn't you. That guy's the king of it all.

Speaker 1:          00:42:34       But Letterman was the Carson of my generation all right. Phelps versus the shark. Bill I just listened to your Monday morning your Thursday afternoon just before Monday podcast and enjoyed your rant. About the upcoming fight between McGregor and Mayweather. It's not wasn't a rant wasn't a rant. I just was discussing the fucking subject if I was screaming and yelling ranting and raving that is a fucking rant.

Speaker 28:         00:43:04       You know I'm going to look up rant about probably got wrong wrong about you know if you transition your fucking habits change. Why the fuck would I be wrong about this rant definition.

Speaker 29:         00:43:15       Come on. Somehow I got to rant now what the fuck is that. No rant. You cunt.

Speaker 30:         00:43:23       Come on definition OK.

Speaker 16:         00:43:29       Rant definition.

Speaker 1:          00:43:32       Speak or shout at length in a wild impassioned way.

Speaker 21:         00:43:38       Yes. She was still ranting on the.

Speaker 8:          00:43:41       I don't know. Well I think this just goes back to me being from Massachusetts and my ideas of of yelling and fucking being out of control are just different than everybody else's. But you go on to say a rant that finally fine whatever yeah.

Speaker 17:         00:43:55       I just don't I fucking hate most about that McGregor Mayweather fight.

Speaker 1:          00:44:00       Aside from the fact that McGregor is only going to be allowed to box that guy is a fucking Swiss Army Knife to death and they only let him take out the spoiled you know you fucking annoys the shit out of me about that fight as I know I'm going to order it.

Speaker 32:         00:44:18       I know I'm going to wondering how do you lay off that. Once I found out it's going to be 100 bucks I thought it would be like 20 bucks I thought they were both making a hundred million I guess Mayweather makes a hundred million McGregor makes twenty million for whatever fucking reason.

Speaker 12:         00:44:30       How fucked up is that.

Speaker 32:         00:44:32       I think the guy that isn't you know if they were doing the fact that McGregor isn't allowed to do what the fuck you know we could do which is put Mayweather right on his back and the thing would be over in 30 fucking seconds.

Speaker 12:         00:44:47       He should be getting 100 million.

Speaker 1:          00:44:49       This is a walk in the park for Mayweather. This is his fuckin strength and never went the other way. McGregor was allowed to use all of his fucking fighting skills then Mayweather should get the hundred million. This is classic Mayweather. This guy's a fucking genius. He's getting it entirely his way and he's making 80 million dollars more than this other fucking guy. Anyways he goes did you see that Michael Phelps is going to raise a great white shark for some discovery channel thing. I fucking refused. That's a joke right. That has to be a joke. Do I have to look this up. I thought you might like that one. That's.

Speaker 26:         00:45:22       That is fucking ridiculous. All right I can look it up. What. Dude even if the shark was full I mean that's. This is like the Mayweather fucking McGregor fight. This is what he does. Meet Phelps swims but he also does other shit he goes to restaurants. You know what I mean. He hits a bong every once in a while. What the fuck does a shark do.

Speaker 29:         00:45:41       That's all it does. There's no fucking way. There's no selfies. Oh my God it came. No. Phelps first shark.

Speaker 3:          00:45:52       This can't be fuckin real Michael Phelps to race a great race against a great white shark in shark weeks. Phelps first shark. Jesus Christ of average has been on the fucking Wheaties box.

Speaker 2:          00:46:08       Not making enough money doing that. Michael Phelps isn't done swimming yet the twenty three time twenty three time Olympic gold medalist this guy is twenty three gold five. You know what this guy wants to race as you know we get. Course he does. He's done with human beings.

Speaker 6:          00:46:27       I think a shark is a good tune up fight when you go into the ocean. I think that's why I don't know who put this together. Maybe it was Mayweather. He said he always picks the perfect fuckin opponent.

Speaker 1:          00:46:40       You go in there gets a great white shark in Artemis there. They're not known for this speed are they always dolphins zipping around.

Speaker 3:          00:46:48       It's always the shit that they have to fucking catch that's fast rate than the slowest thing gets cut by twenty three time Olympic gold medalists will compete in the most adrenaline filled race yet when he swims against a great white shark for its discovery Channel's Shark Week. All right so how do I handicap this. Are they starting in the water is the shark gonna get up on that fuckin block to wait for the whistle. We got a false start.

Speaker 1:          00:47:15       We got a false we're having difficulty explaining to the shark what the fucking whistle is he's just so freaked out that he's out of his natural atmosphere here in Phelps first shark great gold verse great white is what they're calling this the retired athlete will take on the ocean's most efficient predator in a competition of speed. Jesus Christ can you imagine. Who is Nike putting up the swim goggles for the fucking shark. All right I guess. Phelps tweeted something I was able to do something that I had always wanted to do.

Speaker 5:          00:47:54       Being a cage and dive with great white sharks you see Mary's got a kid now give him first birthday party. Happy Father's Day to him.

Speaker 1:          00:48:07       What kind of a dad he's got. You know what. He's got all that gold you know. You know it's funny. The dollar the entire U.S. economy could collapse and he's gonna be fine. He's got twenty three gold medals you just melt those fucking thing down. You make a little nickel sized coins that guy's in subs for the rest of his fucking life. Phelps great white race isn't the only shark week special. He'll be appearing in the father of one will also. I don't give a fuck about what he's doing. I.

Speaker 25:         00:48:35       Together the trio will dispel myths and misconceptions and teach Phelps the proper way to get up close and personal with hammerheads and great whites OK you know what's funny about fucking the Discovery Channel.

Speaker 1:          00:48:51       After all these years of being the champions the absolute champions of mis information about sharks you'd always watch their things on the sharks you'd always watch these things on the sharks and while you watch the program they'd always say all this. You know these things are being hunted down there aren't misunderstood. Blah blah blah.

Speaker 32:         00:49:19       But when you watch the fucking advertising for that week shark week it was always there was like another Jaws movie was coming out was really bad.

Speaker 10:         00:49:30       So now I guess they're finally feeling guilty and maybe some younger people came in on the Discovery Channel and they've finally done.

Speaker 1:          00:49:39       Shitting on sharks. So where they're waiting and they've been a fucking saltwater pool if they're in a pool. I like Phelps for the simple fact that I have a feeling that the sharks gonna go out of its lane and be disqualified and at the very least the shark can't do that little somersault flip at the end of the fucking pool.

Speaker 10:         00:50:01       Jesus Christ is this this is what the world is the world of sport is becoming I don't know back in the days to have those fucking fat bald guys strongman they're always bald right. Some lifting weights back in the day you know you went bald there would always be pullin trains with their teeth and shit all right first time listening hey Bill first time listening to your podcast.

Speaker 21:         00:50:22       My husband and I came to L.A. for the Rose Bowl last year and saw you stand up. We love it. Thank you. Thanks for taking so much. Thanks so much for talking in detail about jazz and sports. I think this show this think this shows a lot of respect for your audience. We like cool shit obviously we like to stand up don't be afraid to go into technical details about whatever. It's interesting. Any who happy podcasting. Well all right.

Speaker 8:          00:50:50       There's two people that are enjoying it.

Speaker 15:         00:50:53       I think I talked about it a little bit.

Speaker 16:         00:50:56       I downloaded all of this fucking Miles Davis shit. I am like I was a huge Miles Davis fan like. In the early 90s and my favorite album was in a Silent Way and I read his autobiography. I got like fucking. I mean I had all his shit on cassette tapes. I even got like on the corner. Which he talks about in his book how when Herbie Hancock came out with chameleon like that's what he was trying to do that head on jazz album but you know he blamed the record labels saying that they fucked up the promotion of it but I got into all of that shit and then I moved to New York and I stopped playing drums because I was living in a walk through fucking bedroom apartment. I just drums it too goddamn loud I didn't play for like five six years and then I started back up again. So I started in 88 and I've been like a five year break in there so I've been playing about 19 years. That is what it is. I don't what the fuck it is. But anyways Dave Brubeck jazz stuff here we got more drunk shit.

Speaker 1:          00:52:04       Dear Billy backbeat not the exact error you were asking for but Dave Brubeck's band experimented with some crazy time signatures starting in the early 60s look for the album The Dave Brubeck Quartet at Carnegie Hall. I bought it when I was a music major in college and it was a borderline spiritual experience. It's got songs in 11 for aptly named eleven for.

Speaker 16:         00:52:33       Wait a minute eleven for now. How the fuck does that work out. Eleven for C just count that's when you count that just up to eleven all right.

Speaker 3:          00:52:46       So that's just basically it's like playing three three bars of four and then you just play one bar three four and you just lop off that last bit right. Five four take five nine eight. Blue Rondo Alla Turk.

Speaker 1:          00:53:02       Not only are the songs great but the audio quality is impressive for the time period. Every once in a while you can even hear Dave or another member of the band blurt out a cool jazzy during a solo. It really immerses you in the time period and culture. All right. You know this is a classic. I'm going to download this and listen to this with some really nice headphones in the dark.

Speaker 9:          00:53:25       You probably wish that I did some drugs.

Speaker 1:          00:53:29       If you listened to a check out to track Castilian drums at the four minute mark. There's a drum solo where he turns the snare off and does some really cool and creative stuff with his hands and it sticks on the snare. If you look at Joe Morello shit where he's playing with his hands and stuff and then watch John Bonham playing with his fucking hands I'm sure he Morello wasn't the first the only guy to do it but there's just a couple of things where he's hit with the back of his hand and shit and you see Bonham do that but then there's also like.

Speaker 17:         00:53:57       Like YouTube and all that shit did not exist when Bonham was coming up so he was over in England.

Speaker 12:         00:54:06       The odds of him checking that out and actually seeing it is so fucking I don't know how people were able to.

Speaker 17:         00:54:15       You definitely listened to everything you could. But to actually get to watch all of em was fucking it's when something something came on the TV you just fucking sat there and watched it. There was no hit and pause there's no all there's gonna be a rerun. If you missed it you fucking missed it.

Speaker 21:         00:54:31       Anyways this guy says thanks and go fuck yourself with that shiny new high head stand. Jesus Christ. All right.

Speaker 33:         00:54:37       Join in the army.

Speaker 5:          00:54:41       Hey Nia if you want to come in there's a question for you.

Speaker 1:          00:56:35       Dancing wedding. Hey there billy back freckle my girlfriend and myself are attending a wedding for our good friends. Two gay fellas. It's a very progressive podcast by the way. That you're doing. Yes. Because I already brought up Caitlyn Jenner and I learned something today when you kind of freak me out when you said like oh she's really into cars why did I freak you out. Because I know I had to do the math in my head was like was Bruce not into cars. Then I was like No way I've ever read the Sports Illustrated and Porsches and he was a pilot and all that shit right. Mm hmm. Does his pilot's license must transfer over. You got to change the name. How far out crazy is that then you got to go down there be like listen I'm this guy now I'm sure it's it's every everyone knows that Caitlyn Jenner is Brown right.

Speaker 37:         00:57:27       So if you're not ready what if you're not famous. Yeah if you're not famous you probably got to do that some. Yeah and I do.

Speaker 1:          00:57:35       I am. I am good. You know I'm going to get you for Mother's Day next year speaking into a mike class.

Speaker 38:         00:57:41       Sorry.

Speaker 12:         00:57:43       All right. So here it is. By the way so I google that when you transition do your habits change and nothing came up.

Speaker 37:         00:57:52       So I guess it does. Okay.

Speaker 21:         00:57:54       What's the goal you want to take one little thing would be kind of like oh shit now I'm into this. If you take him like hormones and stuff like when some change your favorite color would change.

Speaker 37:         00:58:03       I don't think so. It doesn't affects your brain right.

Speaker 1:          00:58:07       Why aren't you allowed to ask questions about this shit is be like Oh my God what are you a fucking Trump supporter. I'm really excited to go to this wedding. He's saying OK these two gay guys are getting married grant to gay fellas as he says. I'm really excited to go minus the fact that they are dancing fools. Could they be more stereotypical. My girl and that whole group will be dancing the night away. Well it's a wedding. Yeah.

Speaker 39:         00:58:36       Do you not want to do this. No I'm just trying to. I'm I. I shouldn't wait to hear the question fully. Please proceed.

Speaker 10:         00:58:42       OK. You seem annoyed at any point you need to walk out. I'm fine with it OK.

Speaker 24:         00:58:45       He says meet for me. Says me for me or me I just feel he says me.

Speaker 6:          00:58:51       I'm not a dancer. Perhaps I shouldn't assume but I'm assuming that you're no dancer yourself. Evidently he has not seen Daddy's home.

Speaker 40:         00:59:00       He writes I'm the worst.

Speaker 32:         00:59:04       I'm your standard pasty white guy who doesn't really dance. I don't like it. I don't really understand it. It's just you don't understand. Just seems goofy to me. I totally line up with this guy. I have an appreciation for your NEW DAY. You danced at the wedding though you danced at our wedding all night long. I was drunk. My girlfriend has expressed her dislike with my opinion of dancing after a couple of drinks.

Speaker 1:          00:59:25       Going as far as to tell me it's a real disappointment.

Speaker 41:         00:59:29       I know that I don't enjoy dancing.

Speaker 40:         00:59:35       Oh I love how honest she is. You know it's a real disappointment in our four years together have you. But I'm really this really disappointed and I completely don't respect the fact that you don't like something that I like.

Speaker 42:         00:59:48       Hey Nia Do you like hockey.

Speaker 1:          00:59:52       I'll know what I do. Could you just play along. No I don't. That's a real disappointment in our four years together. We've never really had any sort of arguments other than that one. Jesus Christ that's the only thing you argue about how you're very lucky. How often do you guys go marry this girl. He goes I don't try and guilt her into doing something she doesn't like. So I get a little hot blooded when she does it to me.

Speaker 43:         01:00:15       How long did she say we danced to that one.

Speaker 44:         01:00:19       How blood was it that God gave a fever of a hundred and three.

Speaker 43:         01:00:25       Oh baby. Do you do more than dance right. That's another white guy doesn't want to dance. They do more to dance. Can we get out of here the weekend. Yeah. And Van herpes. Well what do you think. What do you think. Oh Ruby pubic.

Speaker 45:         01:00:42       Ruby Tuesday.

Speaker 1:          01:00:43       I don't stand my ground. And what do I stand my ground and what will most definitely become a disagreement when I don't go flail around like the non dancing whitey that I am or do I sack up and do my best revolted from Pulp Fiction and go attempt to cut some rug even though I'll be miserable the whole time. Best to you your little one and in season two of efforts for family has been great. Thanks for the content and go f yourself. All right all right all right. So.

Speaker 46:         01:01:13       What do you say. Well as I'm snorkeling said earlier it's a wedding. So obviously there's gonna be dancing whether they're gay guys or straight like everybody dances at weddings. Let's not. I don't know how he expect. Like why would he think that there wouldn't be dancing.

Speaker 39:         01:01:27       Maybe that's he had nothing do with the gay guy. He just says he doesn't want to. He just doesn't want to dance. No one.

Speaker 47:         01:01:34       Can Dance.

Speaker 38:         01:01:37       Okay. Oh that thing about me is the way that. Well.

Speaker 48:         01:01:46       I don't know.

Speaker 39:         01:01:47       Listen girls that liked to dance like guys that liked to dance with them. That's just how it is. You said the name of a new reality show. If you don't go in there and do the YMCA and the electric slide you can at least do a couple of slow dances. How about that.

Speaker 49:         01:02:04       Can you guy meet me outside. How about that. Yes those cash meals at home. That maybe that can be the compromise. Listen I'm not going to go up there YMCA and. Break good come out.

Speaker 40:         01:02:19       Doo doo doo. This is not a career. What's it like. I don't know I'm saying what I saw. None of those things would get a beloved prince. Do we have Prince at our wedding.

Speaker 37:         01:02:29       I don't want to stay focused. Oh yes. I think I think the compromise sir is that you should give your lady a couple of slow dances and also also.

Speaker 48:         01:02:43       Wait a minute. It's one night.

Speaker 50:         01:02:46       It's not going to kill you to get up there and like be goofy with her. No one's watching you because I feel like there's a little bit of you that's like you don't like to dance because you feel like you can't dance. Nobody's looking at you. Nobody's judging you.

Speaker 37:         01:03:01       It's one night out of your life. Just be silly have fun with it and definitely slow dance with her. She'll really appreciate. This is one of those times where. Even though you don't like doing something you do it for the person that you love. This is what it is my suggestion. You're not going out dancing every single Saturday would you. But with a wedding.

Speaker 51:         01:03:21       You said I'm a little distracted so I'm sorry I can't put my mouth like you know you want me to blow the damn microphone not what you can do is Hello. I'm thinking car. OK. I'll do that. You're blowing the thing up.

Speaker 1:          01:03:41       I just this is what he should do. He should go go there. And have five quick drinks five five get fucking hammered and then just go out there and then just that's it. You blackout drunk. I don't think that doesn't get around like a fish out of water. Yeah I don't. Next day.

Speaker 14:         01:04:00       I don't know when you're hung over and you're laying there and she's giving you looks you just look at her and your best Clint Eastwood voice and you just feel like it was your idea.

Speaker 1:          01:04:10       You want me to dance. These are the rules that would just sell it say listen I'm going to dance my ass off that night OK. And I want you know how stupid I'm going to feel I'm doing this for you. However these are the rules. You line up five shots.

Speaker 52:         01:04:24       I'm doing those like Mr Blonde going through that bank.

Speaker 14:         01:04:30       Bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam.

Speaker 39:         01:04:35       If you had made me go out on the fucking dance floor I don't think you should get a good Mr. Blonde that was all right. I don't think you should be five shots wasted. I think he should. Would you accept three. I would take two and see how it goes. Are you the worst. Three give him three. This gives us a major anxiety. You think of all the stuff you like to do. Right. Exactly. Yeah. But I'm just saying well how about this. Can he at least give her up. How. Before he gets wasted. Can you just give her a slow. Because we love slow dances. They don't start with the slow dance.

Speaker 40:         01:05:07       I know you go out there and it's like immediately like immediately get down on it Get down on it.

Speaker 49:         01:05:14       Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do the beat it is there was it just by doing a neutron dates. Someone stole my brand new Chevrolet. Yeah. At that point you've got to be like you can be like fuck yeah you got to be.

Speaker 37:         01:05:34       You got to be five shots it it's one night out of your life do it because your lover chose and say I this is my dancing for the year.

Speaker 50:         01:05:46       I loving you more night.

Speaker 48:         01:05:51       He's gotta be shitfaced. Can you just let the guy get drunk. I don't say this a lot. I don't says Love is a white thing. What do you mean. We don't do we don't dance the way people dance all the time. Fred Astaire. We did do it professionally we just don't do it. I.

Speaker 39:         01:06:11       Read that one of those people on Dancing With the Stars. That's it. I don't know.

Speaker 1:          01:06:16       All right here's another one for a girl at jujitsu. A Billy bollocks.

Speaker 48:         01:06:21       So my dilemma is I'm 18 and I've Oh my it's hot is friggin hell. And when I enter the AC on. Because what am I spot. I'll hit pause. Hang on.

Speaker 1:          01:06:33       All right. I'm back. Here we go. So my dilemma is I'm 18 and I've just finished the first my first year of college a few months ago and I've been hit in the gym. Good for you as much as possible. Good for you. And I've been going to jujitsu. You're crushing it for the past couple of months anyway first day going there I noticed a girl in the beginner's class with me and thought she was hot and she's doing jujitsu. This is this is nothing but a great stuff so far. So after a couple of weeks I work up the nerve to talk to work. Good for you. Turns out I went to school with a younger brother something in common. This is like all rainbows right now. And I was also the youngest in my years so I think she might be 19 or 20. Jesus Christ this is just all aces. On my computer screen keeps shutting down. I don't know any way after training. I don't know. Anyway after training yesterday I asked her I asked for her snapchat. Is that the way millennials as four digits. No. I never even said digits. I'd be like What's your number. I'll get a call yeah.

Speaker 24:         01:07:38       You like my Z Cadbury cheese Daisy view carnage. Dude it's a meat market.

Speaker 1:          01:07:45       Try not to curse in front of her even though he's already done it 50 times here. I don't know. I don't know. Anyway it's a trip. And she gave it to me and after I. Asked her for it I felt like a weight had been lifted because I've never really talked to that many girls let alone get their Snapchat or whatever. Good for you because I'm incredibly reluctant and a bit scared to talk to them. Yeah. Pathetic. I know but I think this girl's girlfriend material. That's not pathetic. Not just a fuck one time bitch.

Speaker 48:         01:08:15       That was pathetic. Yeah. He really just made a left turn there. That statement was pathetic.

Speaker 6:          01:08:20       He kind of built himself up as the oh shucks guy.

Speaker 39:         01:08:22       Yeah. And then he now turned around and said now he's a lady killer.

Speaker 1:          01:08:27       Yeah well I know what it is what he's afraid of love. Whatever. No no we'll see what you just did. You just turned her off. All right. I think I'm solo on this one so Billy Boy what should I do. How should I go about this. How should I texture. Any advice would be appropriate appreciated. Love the podcast. Wouldn't mind hearing for the lovely knee is important too if possible.

Speaker 48:         01:08:52       Would love for you. Could you just let a guy be a guy with me. That's the equivalent you guys me like. Well what does he do for a living. How much does he make or what size house could I get when I kick him out. Is that the equivalent Bill. Yes equivalence equivalent as well. Nobody talks like that. At least not in my circle. Oh sorry.

Speaker 53:         01:09:12       Oh my God. For me I feel I need a twist.

Speaker 1:          01:09:18       However your friend's dog would love for you to not like play a gig in Ireland sometime. Thanks. Go f yourself too. I played a gig I played 3 last year I went from Dublin up to Belfast and at the Galway I had an isosceles triangle of freckled fuckers I performed two out there.

Speaker 50:         01:09:32       Are you trying to be a bad ass with this whole. Not a one time bitch fuck type of thing. Like what what was that. What was that little statement he threw in there. Because that did really turn me off.

Speaker 1:          01:09:43       Why do you keep latching onto that. This guy has all kinds of great qualities. 18. He's he's he's one year into college. OK. He's hitting the gym. He's taking jujitsu. He saw a beautiful woman he was smitten by her and he's nervous OK. He loves to use this locker room talk.

Speaker 39:         01:10:00       I just don't understand why he. I just don't I don't build a wall around why it has to be like categorizing girls that he doesn't even know.

Speaker 50:         01:10:10       And so this is like the kind of bitch you just fuck Woods. And this is girlfriend material girl fuckers. How about your neither. How about you're not gonna get laid and you're an asshole that won't have a girlfriend. How about that. How does that feel.

Speaker 49:         01:10:22       Meet me outside. How about it. It gets really bad about me.

Speaker 17:         01:10:28       Yeah. You guys do the same thing.

Speaker 45:         01:10:31       We're not talking about what you guys do and what everybody else does. I'm talking about this person I wrote in this question. OK. That's not that's not what this conversation is about. You know what everybody I'm a child. I want her to feel my passion here. OK. Now I owe her. I'm not. We are. We're not discussing what women do versus what men do. We're talking about this particular person who is like oh good for you. You got her snapchat also.

Speaker 50:         01:11:01       Like Snapchat grow a pair and get her number if you're really trying to like come with it. Like don't be lurking on her snapchat so you can like jerk off to her like a little selfie pics. I mean with this person. I'm sorry.

Speaker 39:         01:11:13       I just you know what. I'm jealous of this person. You know what. I don't see that he's working out a pretty little line that you threw in. So I married his wife and he feeling that type of way about it. So.

Speaker 1:          01:11:28       All right. Here's my. Well this is reaction. Here's my advice. What was what do you know something on. I swear to God if you were a pitcher right now I'm coming out and before I even get to the mound I'm taking you out of the game. I don't even know what that means. It means you get way too emotional you lost your control and you're gonna you're gonna kill somebody else's girlfriend material.

Speaker 50:         01:11:48       Not just a one time you know a bitch you fuck one.

Speaker 1:          01:11:51       This guy cannot run from the bullpen. Quick enough. You've completely lost your composure. Hit the showers on this one.

Speaker 6:          01:11:58       All right.

Speaker 45:         01:12:00       How do you know what kind of person she is. Oh boy. Because you decided because you projected what you want your fantasy because she's not a real person to you right. She's not a real person. She's just someone you saw doing jujitsu and is like Oh my God this is like my dream girl. Not like those other girls that you just like tossed to the side. You don't even know her you even care to know her. You got her snapchat her snapchat really. Grow a pair ask for the number or stay the fuck away. Don't be lurking online like some kind of creep.

Speaker 54:         01:12:35       What is this person's name. It was from Ireland Colin. Mia.

Speaker 55:         01:12:44       Does Seamus.

Speaker 39:         01:13:17       You got grumpy all right fine. Yes this is that there are days I eat your legs. This guy you would not want to be in relationship. This is a guy that you just like bang out a few times and don't ever see again. Yes. What do you mean. You bang out a few times now. Right. You're right. Women do the same thing. It's 100 percent true. I think it just took 20 minutes to get there. I don't know it just bugged me. Of course it bugged me that I am being a hypocrite because I've certainly had those feelings toward certain guys. So exactly.

Speaker 1:          01:13:49       And it's about time I start fucking admitting that instead of acting like the world owes you a round of drinks. Here's a man. He's found he's smitten with this girl. He's afraid. Get out. So he just needs a tooth coming in there. Yes. Well this is what I would say. How should you go about this. You have to do something that's probably difficult at your age. And I hate when older people say this but you gotta figure out a way to be yourself. You gotta walk. You've said enough.

Speaker 39:         01:14:20       And I think you've said it. I'm sorry Shane. I'm sorry I yelled at you. I think you've said enough.

Speaker 1:          01:14:28       I think you dumped a whole bunch of other stuff from other days. Was it something I did. I don't know. But this guy did not deserve that. This is an 18 year old. He just became a man.

Speaker 48:         01:14:37       Okay okay. I overreacted a little. He's a colleague go to college and he's gonna want to defend his family back for good eats right with his jujitsu.

You don't have to just sit there and brood in the corner. It's right. There's no reason to feel what you do is you. You fake with those ones you just gonna bang somebody actually like you got to be honest with them or else it's not going to work. So just yeah okay.

Speaker 39:         01:15:40       This is getting what I say I want to go. Okay cool. I think you will get. I think you both need a nap. I'm sorry. Yeah I know. I'm sorry about that. It's all right. Hey we all get it. Whatever his name is.

Speaker 1:          01:16:20       Dear William no fun. I'll skip all the ass kissing since you blow through all your both through on your reads anyway. All right. I'm a 34 year old married guy former Navy vet.

Speaker 6:          01:16:31       Bah bah bah bah who's sick of feeling like a shit bag. I want to do something with my life and feel like making a difference. I've kicked around the idea of going back into the military for a while now.

Speaker 56:         01:16:43       And it's shit or get off the pot time while you go back into the military.

Speaker 1:          01:16:49       34. Okay I brought this up to my wife in the past and all she can say is you're married and changes the subject. Some back story on us. We've been together for seven years and married five ish. We've had our ups and downs like any couple but I get sick of being treated like a child when it comes to my own life. Anyway I'm just about at the cutoff age cutoff age wise to go down the path I want in life. I want to be a combat medic. Jesus Christ dude. Good Lord man. I mean how much excitement do you need in your life. You already served and you want to go begging with this guy's a friggin hero here said I'm a determined man who cares about my family and my family and my country. I've done my research and I have the time to join. Do the medic training go to rasp Ranger assessment program.

Speaker 17:         01:17:47       You're gonna become an Army Ranger at 34.

Speaker 14:         01:17:51       Do you guys ever watch that documentary on Netflix about it just to see if you're worthy of going through like the week long of 10 days or 14 days a hell. Only thing I remember was they had this giant like telephone pole that you and ten other guys had to hold up and do curls with it or some shit and his people quit. The rest of you had to hold the thing up.

Speaker 17:         01:18:17       I mean I was screaming in pain watching it. And if you puked in the pit you had to get your puke out of the pit.

Speaker 1:          01:18:25       It was just like just that beginning thing was more obstacles than I've ever faced in my entire life. You are a driven man. You're a special kind of person man. If you can't get special forces right he says then special operations combat medic training. My question is Bill what do I do here. Do I risk losing her or stay here and resent her. I don't want to do either but I also can't continue to work myself to death as a construction worker making someone else rich at the cost of my health and happiness. Dude if you want to be a combat medic and you're fucking putting drywall in. I mean that's gonna be torturing you. He said I've worked seven twelves for six months sixty seven days a week 12 hours a day for six goddamn months trying to save money to go to nursing school she tells me she booked us on a cruise. She spent that money on a cruise. Oh yeah. Oh boy. I don't know what to do and I need your help. Thanks in advance for your advice and thanks for the minute mediocre job on efforts of family. Go fuck yourself.

Speaker 10:         01:19:33       I deal to what's going on in your relationship but as is is a critical lack of communication.

Speaker 1:          01:19:42       OK. You're telling her what you want to do. She's just saying you're married. Changes the subject you've saved up all that money to go to nursing school and either she didn't realize that that was what it was for and booked you on a cruise or she's one of the most selfish people on the planet which I don't think you would have brought that up.

Speaker 17:         01:20:04       So I think what's going on here is you're one of these. You're this guy's guy John Wayne type. And like most of them you know people like that. You ask me how you're doing and you just say fine. All right. Well you need to do what you got to open up. You got to sit down you've got to say listen we've got to talk. And you have to sit down and tell her what you want to do. Tell her how you feel at work and you have to communicate and start there and work your way to the ranger assessment program. That's what you have to do because other than that you have a major blow out argument on the horizon. And her catchphrase is going to be where is all of this coming from you know.

Speaker 17:         01:21:00       You if you're one of those guys that does stuff the right way there's a problem. You can run into where you have this expectation that everybody else should also do things the right way and when they don't then you get fucking pissed and it's all of it builds it is complete. Like I lead by example and all that shit you've got to learn how to communicate. So yeah I would sit down with her and I would talk to her. All right. And good luck with that. Those are amazing friggin goals. I just want to learn how to play Tommy the cat.

Speaker 7:          01:21:37       That's what I want to do anyways.
