Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Okay. Hey, what's going on? It's bill burr and it's the Monday morning podcast for Monday, July 2nd, 2012 what's going on? It's the first week of July. Oh my God. This summer is just flying by. I can't, can you believe it? Can you believe that it's gets July? Can you believe that we spend all of June going? Can you believe it's June? Hey people say that even though I make fun of it all the time, which probably annoys the shit out of you, but I hate people who fucking live in the past, you know? Like what did you think that you were going to achieve in June yet? How did you get a sunburn? Good. Well then it was a good month. Yes. Time is flying by. Yes, you are going to fucking die. So why don't you quit sitting around talking about how it's going by and why don't you go do something?

Speaker 1:          00:00:59       Huh? Hypothetical person that I never even heard say this shit. Do you know there's allegedly an asteroid? Not allegedly and I guess there is an asteroid. I mean five fucking no, there isn't one. Cause now like I have a telescope, it's Goddamn scientist. I think they do that just so they can keep, they can have a job. They just look through this giant telescope. Nobody else looks through it. What'd you seek? Doug is an asteroid 10 right? Torches man, it's going to kill everybody unless you give us $4 billion, but you're fucking nerds. That's I think the scientists that that level did that. Just like bankers at that level, just complete corrupt pieces of shit. You know, every once in a while you'll see a good one. Yeah. You meet an honest one that'll sit there and be like, you know, ah, I don't know what to tell you.

Speaker 1:          00:01:51       We've pretty much mapped out all the way to the end of the universe. Had A, I still have just as many questions is when I started, which once again is why, uh, that, that poor metea so whatever the fuck it was called was such a good movie. I can't remember the names. Um, so anyways, it's supposed to be habit dentally. There's this asteroid heading right towards us, you know, and rather than just letting it happen, you know, and just ending the fucking movie. W W we're going to send some shit up there to try to land on it and make fuck with its trajectory. We're going to, we can shoot some stuff at it and then, and then what? And then what? We're going to keep living until we destroy the entire fucking atmosphere and just make this whole place unlivable. All right, we're done. It's over.

Speaker 1:          00:02:45       Did you ever go to a fucking, uh, like Vegas or you go to Atlantic City and you look up on a billboard and you like, that motherfucker is still doing shows. What is he doing? It's over. Nobody fucking cares. Go fucking out and make your own jam. You know your own Jelly and start a start a new business. No one wants to fucking listening to sing that God damn song that was a hit in 1974 the day Libya they die. Do you imagine that poor bastard sing and that, so he's even still alive if he's dead is because of that song. And I have to sing that for 40 fucking years.

Speaker 1:          00:03:24       And they would say good or Madonna did a cover that then she did she do a house version, some gay guys with some tied off shirts behind her, making it new yet keeping it old. Um, she's uh, you know what's amazing about her cause she continued to work out, you know, it's fucking incredible. Her body is like, you know, just like a fucking 18 year old with this from reason. The can't, you can't, uh, work out on your face. There's no like face pull ups and I don't give a fuck if you get that faceless shit and everything, you know, you still look old. You just can't, you can't fucking beat it. Which is why you don't sit around going, oh my God, it's fucking July already. Uh, with your bud light and your cigarette shut your face, your freckled whore. Um, I live in the past a lot.

Speaker 1:          00:04:23       I do every morning when I take my dog for a walk, I listened to fucking music and half the time I'm fan, I'm always fantasizing. That's me singing it and playing like, do you guys do that shit? Like you're a, like the, you know, like a utility infielder that can like play any position. Like I can play every instrument when I'm listening to the song and whoever is the standout in that moment of the song by the borough, there'd be the singer, the or the fucking tambourine player, whatevers steel. And my focus, that's who I am. And half the time I'm doing it 30 years ago and my high school auditorium and the whole school is going, wow, that guy is awesome. And every once in a while I'll actually step out of the fantasy and go, Bill, you know, there's really something fucking wrong with you.

Speaker 1:          00:05:10       And then I just laugh, you know, Oh, I throw my head back and I cackle and then my dog looks at me like, what the fuck is wrong with you? And then she takes a shit and I pick it up. That's my morning time. My morning works, then they come back and I make myself a little breakfast. Um, underrated. Fucking, it's such a Boston's fucking cooking, cooking for yourself. And even more underrated cooking for your friends. I actually, uh, I worked with Kevin Shea, fucking hilarious. Jason Lawhead Cleveland Zone. And that's not a lie. That's the truth. Cleveland zone. Jason Lawhead who just grown by leaps and bounds keeps getting funnier. And uh, I actually, I made those guys at dinner before we went out, before we went out to, uh, Ontario, the inland empire. I was teasing them all, fuck a weekend about that name. The fucking inland empire.

Speaker 1:          00:06:06       Who Do you guys plan on conquering next? Just saying shit like that. Um, it's really is impressive bad ass name cause I think they actually call it the I e which is really bad. You should just call it the inland empire. You know, when you just have a regular name like Pittsburgh, you got to come up with something to try to like jazz it up. Like, you know, when, when you come into the Berg, when he coming to be more, you know, and it's, yeah. Oh, I always said that most corniest joke ever. Can you be more douchey? Ugh, really? Fuck you. It's Monday morning. I'm entitled to that. Um, oh, you live in a place, it's the inland empire. You don't, you don't have to fucking, you don't have to make up a name. Do you want that fucking reminds me of, I remember a long time ago at the height, at the tail end of the height of that fucking deaf jam style of, of standup comedy where you could just talk about white people, like they were borderline retarded and white people would just sit there and laugh even though none of it made sense.

Speaker 1:          00:07:09       And you could even relate to it, but the political correctness needle was at its peak. So you, you just felt like you had to laugh because if you didn't, then you were maybe some roundabout racist. Do you remember that or is this just my world? Um, I saw this one man show on Broadway and this guy was doing this whole bit and he goes, yeah, me and my, all my friends, this Latin dude, he goes, me and my friends would go, we'd go into Maddie Hattie. And then he goes, that's Manhattan for all you white people. And everybody laughed. It's like I that just right there, I just zoned out of it. That whole fucking show. It's like, fuck you. You can't, you think I can't figure that out. Like that's some sort of like you like you're some Apache and I'm the god Japanese and I can't break the fucking code.

Speaker 1:          00:07:55       I'm in Manhattan. You're dumb cunt. It's not like I'm watching this and Kentucky. I'm in fucking Manhattan. Uh, Jesus Christ fucking remixed the name of this God Damn Town Aman. And it is a town. Manhattan is a town. I know it's a bunch of people there and everything, but it's really fucking small with no traffic. You can drive from one end to the other and like 10 minutes. I mean, you're hauling ass, but you can do it on the, on the, on the highways on the side. Me Do that with any fucking town out there. Right. And he's got everybody jammed together and fucking, you know, shooting up into the sky. That's the thing about New York, I told you that before is, is like you got to eat. You should live there at some point in your life. And do it sooner rather than later. Do it. And like your 20s and then a little bit in de [inaudible] and then get the fuck out.

Speaker 1:          00:08:40       That's perfect. That's fucking perfect. I was just talking to Neil about that this morning. We were cracking up about it, like how we got to, I mean, I actually stayed there too long, but God out at the right time, you know what I mean? You know it is about man, you just can't get any fucking privacy. Everybody's just jammed in with each other. And then like, you don't give a fuck when you're young, when you can go out and drink until fucking three in the morning, wake up, still have abs and go to work at seven in the morning, you know, to fuck with some third world countries, economy or whatever the hell it is. Those constitute down a Wall Street. Right. You can do that, but fucking you start getting into your thirties and it's, you just can't do it anymore and you just want to come home and you want fucking space age.

Speaker 1:          00:09:25       You want quiet, you know, he can't fucking sit there. And then there's going to be some new 20 something year old moving in next year. He's going to be fucking rage and for three years and going through breakups and fucking screaming at fucking girlfriends and all that crap. And then there's going to be the person down the hall that's like 10 years older than you all right? And you're starting to see them slipping into that, you know, getting a few too many pets and I'm becoming like a Gora phobic, you know what I mean? It just gets depressing after a while. So now it's, now it's great. I could live out here and then I'll come back there. I'll do a Gig, I hang for like a week and then I get the fuck out of there. But I got to admit when I go into the, the comedy clubs, it's fuck, it's horrific.

Speaker 1:          00:10:10       I walk in and I'm looking for familiar faces. My eyebrows are up and I'm looking around and there's nobody there that I remember anymore. And I, I, it fucking kills me. It's, it's why I hate going home to my hometown. I hate it because I moved away so long ago when I called back, it's like a fucking time warp and I think I'm going to walk around town seeing people that I know and, and I don't see anybody. And then maybe you run into somebody that you do know and hopefully they'd been going to the gym because if they haven't, they're going to quickly remind you how fucking old you are. And I swear to God at that point, I want to kill myself. Um, then what the fuck do I do? How do I get out of that? Depression has been my whole, I don't, what the fuck is in my throat here? Hang on a second. Hang on one second. I got to fucking hang on.

Speaker 1:          00:11:03       All right, I'm back to hit pause there. One of the rare times they have to hit the pause button. I just went outside and just, I just, you know, hawked it up and just spit all over these plants. And second I did it. I started laughing because I know the plants were just like, fuck really? You know, plants, poor bastards. You know, what sucks about being a plant is you can't fucking, you can't move. You can't like, you know, Oh, here comes some fucking spittle and just sorta like slip a punch. Yeah. I think that's what sucks about being a plant plant is you can't, you can't slip a punch. There would be my number one reason, you know, and then just sitting there and a bunch of fire ants or whatever the fuck they are. Some sort of insect locusts just start eating you and you just sitting there, you know, it's like you got fucking cement shoes on.

Speaker 1:          00:11:50       You know, I bet after this fucking astroid Ma, if it mercifully hits this fucking planet, all right. Ends us and we go down just like the dinosaurs, like I think plants are going to take over next and there's going to be a big moment in their life when one of them finally has the sense to pull leg part of their roots out of the ground and just move over a couple inches, then they'll gradually the grow feet, right? And then, uh, once they do that, then you'll probably have your first like hand to hand combat somebody gonna get raped, you know, and then they'll invent some stuff and then they'll think that they're special and then they'll invent this invisible guy in the sky. And then they'll fight over who has the right visible guy and then another asteroid is going to hit. That's what I think keep happening.

Speaker 1:          00:12:43       I think God just keeps making shit and waiting for people to fucking figure it out. And he just keeps going at God. These ones that dumped too, right? You have anything like what he's doing on this planet is, it's like somebody trying to build a hot rod, you know, and we're like the transmission and we just keep slipping and they just have fucked us. You know what? This doesn't fit this engine and then you just fucking throws an asteroid at the God damn thing now. Well I do anyway. So I was mentioning earlier that I um, hang on a second, get in here, sit down. It's fucking dog goes out there. I don't understand it. She goes out, I left the door open, she goes out in the backyard and she lays in the sun until she's panting. Like she just ran a marathon. Then she gets up, drinks a bunch of water, and then lays in the shade and then does it all over again. And then at some point she fucking goes over and just starts eating the grass, little blades of grass and it gets stuck in the back of her throat. And then she goes for the rest of the fucking day. Why do you do that? Huh? What are you going to involve? Where you can fucking speak to me. All right. Get over there and lay down. Please do it. Do as I say, Hey, what are you going clear? I'll get over here. Fucking walk away from me and my podcasts. Lay Down, down. Sit.

Speaker 1:          00:14:20       Stop looking at me like that. All right. Go outside. Go on. Get out of here. See that? That's going to be a horrible parent. All right. Here's a fucking ice cream. Um, anyways. Yes. So cooking for somebody is fucking great. It's, you know what I love about it? That there's a rush that comes as, as they're coming over, you know, you're trying to time it so it's fucking perfect. You try and make it look good and then there's this panic that you're going to fuck it up and that there's going to be this awkward silence because it's sucks. Right. And this is thing I'm cooking for two comedians, so if it's sucks, they're going to tell me, especially that cunt, Kevin Shay, he doesn't give a fuck that guy. You know, Kevin, by the way, is, is an unbelievable singer, but he's embarrassed. Um, I dunno.

Speaker 1:          00:15:06       He has like this hidden talent. Like he fucking, I caught him one time when I walked in the green room. He was sitting by himself. I thought he had the fucking right radio one. He's unbelievable. So a ladies get them to sync for you when you go and see him out on the road. Kevin Shea, s. H. E. A. Um, so anyways, I fucking, uh, yeah, there's like this rush. Like, are they gonna are they gonna like it? I think, I think it sucks. And, uh, fortunately I pulled it off and they loved it and uh, I didn't get trashed by them the entire fucking way out there. That would have been a long drive. Who the fuck told you you could cook? Um, you listen to the Monday morning podcast, everybody, I hope you're having a good Monday settling into the July 4th weekend or middle of the week then don't you hate when like the Jill July 4th.

Speaker 1:          00:15:53       What's it, what's it a Wednesday second therefore? Yeah, Wednesday. Ah, they fuck shit. You know what I mean? Cause if it's a Tuesday, if it lands on a Tuesday or a Thursday, maybe they'll give you that Monday or that Friday off. You could somehow get a 40 fucking weekend out of it. Or even still, even if they don't give you the Friday, he just go Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday you get fucking Thursday off you dick around on Friday, you still half cocked from the fucking barbecue. Right. And then it's the weekend. It's a great fucking time. But when it falls on the Wednesday, those cons make you come in Monday, Tuesday you'd take a little bit of break. Then Thursday, Friday ag, you know, you still getting a day off out of it, but you know, you know what I mean? When it lands on that Monday or Atlanta on that fucking Friday.

Speaker 1:          00:16:39       Okay. My world, that's America. If I was president July 4th would always be on a Monday. Definitely. Definitely would be on a Monday every fucking year. And people that, well, you know, that actually lands on the seventh and I'd be like, Hey, who picks up the red phone? Mya? You all right? Go Fuck yourself then. Okay, it's on the seventh this year. Do we even know that they signed it on the fucking forth? Do we fourscore and seven years ago, does somebody really say that? Do you have any fucking idea? Oh, by the way, I actually saw a Abraham Lincoln vampire hunter this past week and a, I got to tell you, um, I got tickets for free before you think I'm the dumbest person on the planet. But I actually had faith in that movie because I was like, all right, there has to be a reason they made this because this just seems like the most ridiculous idea I've ever heard in my life. And I went and I saw it and there was really no surprise. It was exactly what I thought it was going to be. A, it was just a vampire hunter who happened to be Abraham Lincoln and they just invented all of this shit. I'm sure it was a book. Maybe. I don't think it was. It was like some nerd shit and I shouldn't have, I shouldn't have seen it.

Speaker 2:          00:17:59       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:17:59       I was all right. I was drinking when I saw it. I was fucking hammered by the end of it. You know what I mean? It's like when your team goes down 11 runs fucking two winnings and you're like, Eh, fuck. It might as well drink. What are we going to do? Go home to a wife. Um, you know, it was the worst part was it was in three d and I fucking hate three d movies. I really hate it. That's just that right there. When a movies in three d that is a very secretive little fucking nod and a wink going, hey, hey, this movie sucks. This movie sucks so bad. We had to make shit float around you to keep it mildly entertaining. I Hate Three d and You know what sucks about three d now is they? Fuck they're making shit in three d that doesn't even need to be in three d, You know, back in the day.

Speaker 1:          00:18:47       All right, Friday the 13th part three in three d, You know we shot that fucking Arrow when it comes at you. All right, cool. That was cool. But like nowadays the guy's like, Abraham, here's your pen and the guy just reads hands a pen. Why is that in three d? Am I supposed to say? Wow. It was almost like he was handing that pen to me, that thing that actually happens to me in real life that happens to me in real life. A guy with the hockey mask on shooting an Arrow at me does not fucking happen near a lake or not near a lake. It doesn't fucking happen. Make that in three d. Don't just have somebody sitting at a fucking desk in three d so I feel like I'm in the office. Oh, it's so fucking stupid. You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:19:33       I don't even, what the fuck I'm saying anymore? Um, you know what, how about, how about a little bit of advertising, a little bit of advertising. How cheese. I have to keep putting the fucking password in this. Why do I have to have a password on my computer as if what I'm doing on this thing is so God damn important. Top secret. What is the password? What is the password? We can't have the world have access to your shit jokes. All right. Um, no, I'm in the wrong area here or in the wrong area. Find it. Find it. Here it is. Okay.

Advertising number two game fly.com [inaudible] dot com are you sick of the real world and want to disappear in 8,000 video games where you're a hero instead of the person you truly are. We all do. Listen gamefly fly.com 8,000 videos and it's insane. They'll mail them to your home or the bridge, take them directly to your PC and when you'd done pit playing them, you can mail them back in the process continues.

Speaker 1:          00:21:51       Monthly fees are a fraction of what a new game costs. Yeah. This is why this totally makes sense because once you're done with the game, nine times out of 10, what are you, what is it? What do you do? It's just more clutter. It's just another stack of crap. You have to put in a box when you go to move. All right? This is, that was what, this is what I would do if I was a Gamer. All right? If I was a Gamer, I would go do gamefly.com I play all those games. I'd send back all the ones that I'm done with and I don't care about, and then the special ones, I just buy those be perfect. Then I get to sample everything. You know what I mean? It's like finding a wife and you've got 8,000 women coming, right? You get to hook up with all of them.

Speaker 1:          00:22:33       This is like what what they promised to terrorists and you don't even have to blow yourself up, is one of the greatest things ever.

That's a metaphor for games by going to www.game fly.com/burr or through the banner ad on Bill [inaudible] dot com slash podcast page. All righty. There you go. And that's the advertising for this week. Wasn't that painless by the way, by the way? I think it's time. I think we're about 17 minutes in and think it's about time. I patted myself on the back. How about that? Download speed last week. Huh? How about that? I didn't hear any complaining.

Speaker 1:          00:23:30       You know, hundreds and hundreds of people bitch, Moan and, and fuck woo woo woo. Right? So I finally fixed the God damn problem and what have I get? I get like five tweets going, hey, I really appreciate it. You know what happened in the rest of you? Cause you went on to bitch about something else. You don't like the photo on my fucking page. You know, you have a stop and thinking about, you know, maybe finding out what you're really upset about Jesus Christ. Could I use that advice? Huh? Um, all right, let's talk about something in the news. Shall We? Um, I actually, like I said, I didn't even watch any TV this week. This is just a really weird time of the year for me with the NHL and the NBA have ended. The NFL hasn't started up yet. I'll watch a little Wimbledon, I'll watch it. A little bit of that World Cup soccer.

Speaker 1:          00:24:20       I wouldn't fuck you call it the European Championship. I wrote for Germany. I'm mostly German, you know, I root for those guys who they Lucy, they're lost to Italy and then Spain kick the shit out of Italy. Um, it's great. I can watch any sport when a championship is on the line. I don't give a shit what it is. Cause you, you feel that energy from the fucking crowd. You know what I mean? Like I would go, like if I was driving by a little league field and somebody said that was the championship game of Little League, I would actually pull over and watch it from my car. Like a creepy pedophile.

Speaker 3:          00:24:57       Wow.

Speaker 1:          00:25:01       No, I would, I would, I would walk up when I would sit amongst the parents so they would, they would not feel uncomfortable. Um, but like I don't, I don't, uh, I stopped watching the news years ago. It just was, I couldn't watch it anymore. The same reason why I stopped going to church. I was just like, this isn't what's going on with the telling me isn't, is a guests. I just don't buy into it, you know, other than, that's why I like sports. I like watching ESPN because what they say is true. For the most part, the Phillies did win two to one. There was 30,000 witnesses. They saw it happen. That other shit, when you start telling me what's going on and fuck and Frankford or fucking Vienna, a God damn fucking Cairo. I don't, I don't know. Is it, is that what happened? Is that footage actually from that, from that fucking place.

Speaker 1:          00:25:54       Did that happen this week? Am I still going to keep asking questions? Will this ever end? I don't know. I'm sorry. Well, you know, every once in awhile I get in one of those in my brain. It just, I can't, I tried to get out of it and then tonight just it's like somebody else takes it over. Do you know what, what kind of people that do that shit when they're explaining something to you and then they start asking questions for you. Like if they would teach you how to cook, you know, so you put the water in the pan. Do I bring it to a boil almost? Do I throw salt? Salt in? Not necessarily. And you're like, dude, who the fuck you talking to at this point? Oh, he's a nice trick for you, for your pasta that somebody taught me your poor little olive oil in there. It keeps the uh, the pasta from sticking together. You don't, evidently, that's what the salt is supposed to do. I thought it flavored the water. I didn't realize that was supposed to help it not stick together. Um, oh, I made a great fucking meal. Not going to lie to you. Not going to fucking lie to you. Spaghetti and fork and meatballs. Delish anyways, it's like I said, I haven't been watching a lot of shit on the news. I just don't watch it.

Speaker 1:          00:26:58       You know what? I think they shouldn't have to fucking sing the news the way they do in the Catholic church. You know

Speaker 4:          00:27:04       there was a guy who got attacked by two monkeys in South Africa.

Speaker 1:          00:27:13       Okay?

Speaker 4:          00:27:14       He decided he was going to go down there and try to rehabilitate some chimpanzees that had been abused and they turn around, dragged them for two kilometers and kicked the shit outta him.

Speaker 1:          00:27:27       What a dumb fuck. Why would you fly across the world to get your fucking ass kicked? Did you guys hear about this dude, South Africa, Texas student attacked by chimp improves. Thank God he improves this poor fucking bastard. He's a ranger, right? He loves animals. This is the thing about animal lovers. You gotta realize that once you go past a certain level of domestic animal and you start getting into the wild, no matter how much you love them, they're not going to love you back. Wild animals. I like that. Dick, you shouldn't have gone out with, you know, that person have cheated on you. That person who just doesn't have your back. Wild animals do not have your back. Your dog has your back, you cat borderline cats kind of have that creepy vibe that if shit went bad, they'd decide what the intruder, you know what I mean?

Speaker 5:          00:28:28       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:28:29       Fish. They just don't have any fucking say. They're like a Stepford wife, you know? That's why dogs are the best they, it's they truly fucking love you. My Dog fucking loves me. Will be on a walk and all of a sudden she just look up me. It's almost like she's smiling. You know how fucking warped, why sound? She's probably just panting and it looks like she's smiling. He's probably going like, why does he have this fucking rope around my neck? It doesn't make any sense to me. If I really wanted to, I could rip his fucking face off, but in my world I'm so in love with my dog and look, she's smiling, but that's not bad when you just have a dog. I think people who fucking, you know,

Speaker 5:          00:29:09       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:29:10       fuck with animals for a wild, wild animals, they start thinking like, oh, look at the Cheetah. Oh, she's play a Gig and all of a sudden draw off. This fucking launches itself that you

Speaker 5:          00:29:22       all right.

Speaker 1:          00:29:24       I believe that we came from monkeys. I believe that we came from the apes. I believe something else. So there's three in a row in this sound smooth. Um, but I by no means think that, uh, that those fucking things like us, I don't give a, if I teach at sign language and the chimps sitting at going in sign language, Hey, I think you're a cool guy there. Freckled face cunt. You know that there's no fucking way I'm ever going on the other side of the God damn cage. This poor bastard was on the other. He was on the other side of the cage. He just got too close.

Speaker 1:          00:30:01       That's how fucking insane a wild animal is. Chimpanzees, they say have the strength of six, six men. This dude got attacked by two chimps that would be like getting attacked by a flash mob. Okay? Like 12 fucking people. They just grabbed this mother fucker by his ankles. They reached underneath. I mean, I don't what kind of bullshit cage they had was like a compound, you know. So they put up that, that, that cheap wire shit when you don't want to rabbit to come in and eat your lettuce, right. And your garden. Like they put that shit up. So this fucking guy sitting there, you know as they go doing that shit and he's like, what are you guys doing to tell me we don't tell me right? And he's trying to sign to them. You guys want to play Frisbee, right? And they sitting there talking to each other going just two more inches, two more inches. Look at this dumb mother fucker who wants to play Frisbee, right? And they reach underneath, grab him by his fucking ankles,

Speaker 1:          00:30:59       strike the 12 men. They fucking pull them right underneath that goddamn thing. Like when you go to Quiznos and they stick you sub right through that poor excuse for a fucking a brick oven yanked motherfucker right underneath. Oh my God. And then they dragged him full like another fucking two kilometers. However fucking far that is. I don't know. In my world that's a, what's that about a mile and a quarter, cause I know like 40 kilometers, like 60 kilometers is like 40 miles an hour. Who gives a fuck? They dragged this son of a bitch basically through the length of every football stadium in the NFL and I can guarantee you it wasn't the nice turf that those guys play on. This was the natural habitat. Like I can't imagine the vice grip strength, those, those fucking things, man, they'll rip your foot off the rip your balls off, the rip your face off the rip it off. Like you open a fucking Goddamn thing, a yogurt, God damn ice cream when you just take the lid off, they do that to your face. What the fuck are you doing near these God damn things. You know

Speaker 1:          00:32:07       Jesus fucking Christ. I would have to tranquilize had guns and I would be wearing one of those fucking, you know the suit you wear when you, you think you're going to get bitten by a shark. That chain link shit, there's no fucking way. There's no way fucking catcher's mass welded to my face. I'm not going anywhere in here. And not only that, these aren't just regular fucking chimps that have been swinging around eating bananas, occasionally eating another monkey alive, right? This isn't that shit. These are ones that were abused. They were fucked with. Okay. And having adopted a fucking abused dog and the Goddamn Skitzo Shit that, that thing does, I can't fucking imagine.

Speaker 5:          00:32:51       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:32:52       Uh, a goddamn schizophrenia fucking ate two of them, straight to 12 God damn men. And you're going to walk near the cage trying to sign, hey, how about the weather frank or whatever fucking human name you gave him, your right Yardi a fuck, and God bless you. Your heart's in the right place. Fortunately, this kid doesn't seem like he had any damage like that, but like this dude was so in shock, like they were finally able to just like stitch them up and stabilize him. And evidently he's not in critical condition and it doesn't seem like, it seems like he still has his balls, his feet and his face, which is incredible. But they say, you know, he, he has bite marks and a and fractures plural.

Speaker 5:          00:33:33       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:33:34       Oh my God. Just treating you like a fucking rag doll. That is the most horrifying shit in the world. To me, nature is the most horrifying shit. I would rather have a lot. Let's see. You know what, the human equivalent, someone has to come into my house with a fucking chainsaw. I can deal with the Goddamn, I could deal with the machete. Alright. I could deal with that. Chainsaws that, that's hardcore. I could fuck up machete. I could deal with, I think I could fucking do the, the sugar ray Leonard, you know, stick my face out and then pull it back when you took a swing and then fucking try to take both your legs out. Uh, only hardcore boxing fans got that one. Um, but the, I mean if you were in a room with the chimp and that thing goes fucking ape shit, no pun intended. That thing is on the floor. It's up on the ceiling. It's across the room. It's like, it's like a comment and you're sitting there dealing with human speed,

Speaker 1:          00:34:38       dude. That's why we got the brains that we have. This why was so much smarter. We have to be because it was so fucking slow. You know what I mean? You ever see a white guy who gets dunked on and those highlight films, you know that fucking guy that they bring off the bench when the teams either up by 30 or down by 30 that guy, that's what we are in nature. Even the fucking athletic humans. Yet your note, we're nowhere near. Just think like a how fast a fucking snake is a fucking pit Viper Viper. I just nothing fucking, you don't eat your bit and that thing has left, left the fucking building before you even did, before that signal from your fucking leg going, hey, we just got bit by a Goddamn pit viper even reaches your brain. That snake is already leaving and then you go, and then the real is, and as the realization did that you got bit hits you, you are, you're already collapsing. Why the fuck would you go out there?

Speaker 2:          00:35:40       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:35:41       You know, I, I don't know. We had to be that fucking smart.

Speaker 2:          00:35:44       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:35:45       I can't imagine that the God damn fear back in the fucking day you're walking around with a bunch of God damn neanderthals or whatever it Niana talls I guess I supposed to say I sit in the under thall my entire life, but it's neander tall, I guess. And what else was it? There was two tribes. One of them died off. There was an [inaudible] and then there was the fucking crow magnums. And I forget what the fuck we are. One of them, one and the other ones, the other one of them was a little bit smarter and the other ones were a little dumber and dumber ones died off. All right. And some people have a little bit of that Crow Magnum or Neanderthal in him, you know, because you know that people, they fuck right. It's going to be the dumbest education podcasts you've, you'll ever got to fucking hair.

Speaker 1:          00:36:35       I just totally lost my train of thought. What the fuck was I talking about? Oh, Niana toss. Right. So I can't imagine what can walking around. Did you ever see that shit when they did that whole thing? I'm chromatic in the Ndaa. Tall is like, one of them was like fucking slower, like the, the fucking white dude in the NBA and one of them was a little bit quicker, a little bit smarter. So they fucking did this shit where like when they would show him like taking down some prehistoric bison, like the fucking little smarter ones, you know, they could fucking, you know, that that Shit, they could slip a punch, they could throw a goddamn spear. They could do, they could do it from a fucking distance. Like this fucking jackass. He wasn't, he was too close to the God damned cage. The fucking Chromatin is whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:37:17       The dumber ones they would like fucking day would just brute strength. They would fucking run and try to tackle the thing and someone would, you know, separate this shoulder, a break, an elbow and there's nobody around is set that shit. Every step in your fucking non-existence shoes and your big stupid prehistoric. It's just shoving that pain shoot through your body. I edge can't imagine. I can't imagine sitting there looking out of a cave in everything is that much faster than me and I don't have a fucking door. I don't have a gun. You just must be just sitting here like a, and he can't really communicate to the other person because language hasn't been developed yet. So you just having that. What the fuck? Look on your face. That was probably one of the first phrases invented like, are you shitting me or the Kelly? Can you fucking believe this? I Dunno, but God blessed that dude, you're an animal lover. I totally know where you're coming from. But for the love of fucking God, those things are not your friends.

Speaker 2:          00:38:20       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:38:23       I Dunno. Start p nine dx in and stay away from that fucking cage. Jesus Christ. Can you imagine that?

Speaker 2:          00:38:31       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:38:32       I'm getting dragged away by two fucking abused chimps. Then you know, God damn well he saw that fucking Oprah want episode. That woman came on with no face. I know. He was fucking thinking of that shit. I hate those motherfuckers. You know what is, I like gorillas. I hate chimpanzees and I hate those little monkeys. The little motherfuckers that throw this shit at you. I can't stand those fuckers. And I hate chimpanzees. I always hated those motherfuckers. I didn't know why. And now I know why. That was my inner fucking whatever the fuck caveman telling me. Get the fuck out. Go back to the cave. Stupid. I don't trust them. I don't. I don't trust those fucking things. You have to go to the zoo and you just fucking, you just your eyes meet with like a lion.

Speaker 1:          00:39:23       Just that fucking look on their face when they, they, there's just, it's, I've said this before, it's like what the same look like when a hooker looks at you like it's, it's the real deal. You know, this isn't some fucking bullshit. Flirting, playing hard to get, get a couple of drinks out of you. It's, yeah, you got 20 bucks, I will suck your Dick. What? Ya know, lions got that same look on their face. Like, yeah, if you know, if you weren't in that fucking armored vehicle or on the other side of this, yeah. If I was hungry I would eat you and uh, no matter how much he screamed, I wouldn't give a shit. It actually excite me more to rip your fucking head off. There's no way. There's no way. There's no fucking way.

Speaker 2:          00:40:08       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:40:08       That's why I watch all those animals thinks about, I'm fascinated and I, and I, I, I appreciate all those people that put themselves in harm's way because there's no other way to really gauge how strong an animal is until you see it slap around a human being. Like, I can't watch too fucking grizzly bears wrestle and slap each other. They're, they're in the same weight class. You know what I mean? If I see him bitch slap a human being and watch the guys head spin around a couple of times, like, wow. All right, I get that. I can now gauge that. Let's like, yeah, like, like kilometers versus miles. All right. I think we killed that subject. Um, moving along. Holy Fuck. 40 minutes in and we had a bunch of good emails this week too, so I got to get to this shit. All right. Um, by the way, if you'd like to email me and tell me to shut the fuck up or ask me a question or anything, uh, the official podcast email is bill@thefmpodcast.com. Bill at the capital m, capital m, capital p Ahd cast.com. That's it. All right. Okay. Here's the first question. Alcohol. Hey, fuck head. What's your favorite type of beer? How often do you drink hard alcohol? Not sure why I want to know so badly, but for some reason I do go fuck a pole.

Speaker 1:          00:41:23       You know, people, just because I have an over the top podcast doesn't mean that I don't have feelings too. That was a guy, like I've been such a country to everybody written in to me. Like he's like, all right, I'm going to be a country you first. So I guess I deserve that. Alright. What are the questions here? What's your favorite type of beer? Uh, all depends. It all depends. Um, there's beers that I like cause they take me back to a fun time in my life. Michelob light Budweiser every time. If I haven't had those beers for awhile, Michelob light is the first beer I got drunk on. And Budweiser was the king of beers and I came, I was a child of the 80s where you actually got a tattoo of the Budweiser label on your arm. You know, I suppose to this fucking shit people do nowadays with Chinese writing.

Speaker 1:          00:42:09       And I don't know, that's even old. Um, so like whenever I drink that shit, it just takes me back to like a, when I lived in Massachusetts season tickets to the patch fucking Bruins, Boston. Yeah. You know, trying to fucking get laid, you know, working in a warehouse, no fucking debt, you know, all that shit. So, um, I've tried to snobby beers, you know, it's, it's funny, I don't like Belgium beers. I, I'm mind blue moon, but I don't let the too sweet. They got that sweet taste in him. I don't like that. I like beer more with a bite. I like German beers. Um, yeah, it all depends. I had like a fucking major thing with, with Guinness for the longest fucking time. And then I went over to Ireland and I tried the Guinness over there and I couldn't tell the difference. I was like, I thought it's supposed to taste better over here. And I drank it all fucking week cause I loved it. And then when I came back to the states then the shit that they had mistakes tasted like ass and I've never kind of been able to go back to it. So I don't even know if I answered the question. And how often do I drink hard alcohol? Uh, not that much, but when I do, oh Geez. Um, I like Scotch. I like whiskey.

Speaker 1:          00:43:31       I do, you know, I saw somebody recently who's been just drinking nonstop, like always embraced the lifestyle, you know, cigar smoking, fucking Whiskey, drinking hardcore and oh my God, dude, you can do that for a little while, but you do that shit. Dia Fifties, man. You get like, you get that your bottom lip always looks like you just put fucking chap stick on it, you know? And then you get this big head. You look like this guy. He looked like a fucking old woman. I can't even tell you. He still has like a great head of hair and he had like this bad ass rockstar haircut that was a little short, but because his head was so fucking big and its torso was all fucking, you know, man tit it out. That's what he looked like. He looked like an eastern European 60 year old woman. You know, those women who look like they could rip a tree out of the ground.

Speaker 3:          00:44:23       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:44:25       I think bill, Maurice said that they asked him why, uh, he doesn't drink anymore. He goes, yeah, you know, after awhile you start like Ted Kennedy. He's absolutely right. Um, all right. Beef Kurt and advice for those of you in the states, that's a slang for the Hoo Ha beef curtains. Do the math. Think about it. All right, you ready? Okay. Here we go. Here's the situation. I have a wonderful girl in my life. Uh, what, when she does not a fuck. That's what I'm guessing. I'm guessing this is where it's going. I wonderful growing my life. Great attitude, humor, big tits, nice ass and a good family. Jesus Christ. Dude, marry this girl. Sure. It seems good for now. But I have one issue. She also has some mean beef curtains and he put in parentheses, Pussy Lips just in case. I didn't know. Uh, that kind of bug me bug the ever living shit out of me whenever we get down to the dirty business. So much. So to the point I looked up some cosmetic surgery that basically gives the beef curtains a trim job and beauties the vagina. While, dude, why? All right. Now before I read the rest of this, if you're going to fucking ask me how to have this conversation,

Speaker 1:          00:45:40       like listen, love, I love you. I love you, I love you family. I love you, your heart, everything. But is there any way you could trim your beef curtains? Maybe you can get away with it cause you've got that cool accent. I Dunno, but she has it too so she's not going to give a fuck. You maybe pull this off with some foreign chick anyways. Um, so he looks up cosmetic surgery to try on a beautiful vagina. Now I know by now I must sound like a douchebag focusing on the little things now because women do that to women. Focus on little things like that. That's a serious issue, dude. Sex is a big fucking thing. But anyways, he says, but my thinking is I'm truly going to pull the trigger. He spelled it that way and keep this woman all the myself for the rest of my life are and I entitled to have a great looking vantage to look at it for as long as our bodies don't wrinkle away. Wow. I know there's a lot of women are fucking annoyed by this one. Yeah. What about your fucking Dick in your wrinkled balls once you get a face lift for your sack there, buddy. I know they're all saying that. Um, how can I ever bring this option up to her without, I knew he's going to ask me without completely destroying her feelings or making her hate me for being so pussy conscious. Thanks for the read. Now go fuck yourself. All right. This is a simple one, dude. There is no fucking way

Speaker 1:          00:47:11       you can bring that up to her without absolutely completely destroying her feeling. So you either need to accept this or you have to, you have to let her go. That's it.

Speaker 2:          00:47:22       That's it.

Speaker 1:          00:47:23       I mean, I would think that if you actually truly cared about this girl, now all the chicks are going to be like, oh, I knew he had a heart underneath all those c words. Um, if you truly care about this girl, uh, I would think that that wouldn't matter. You know, and if she looks the way she, she's saying, you're saying that she looks, I mean, what, what are we talking here? Like how, how far down are these things hanging as it like, you know, I mean she got 'em both of them peers. Could you like do like, uh, could you like, oh, it's bad to say, could you be like, do you like that Olympic? The fuck is that thing here. You're on the rings. Could you do that and still swing your feet up and not hit her pussy? Are we talking like it's that bad? You know if you did the iron cross, would your head be in her pussy? Like how far these things hanging down? Hey now

Speaker 6:          00:48:15       what's the deal with big gardens?

Speaker 1:          00:48:17       All right dude, there's no way there's, there's no fucking way and don't, don't do that to her because she can't do anything about that. If she had a problem with her fucking vaginal area, you would have known by now because she would have been self conscious and she would have brought it up the way. Sometimes girls do about parts of their bodies and they are super self conscious about their bodies because we're so fucking visual. All right. I told you once had, when the first girls I ever hooked up with, when I got his shirt off and her bra, she rolled her eyes and I thought she was thinking that. I was like, oh my God. Like I'm not doing it for like she's rolling her eyes. Like this guy's lame and I found out later she was self conscious about the size of her breasts. So I totally took it the wrong fucking way. I made it all about me cause I'm self-involved. So A. Dot. Yeah, don't do that tour. All right. Either. You can see that that's when you just suddenly have in your head. Either you accept that shit or you move on, but there's no reason to hurt this person because you're a shallow cut like me. All right. All right. Cheers. [inaudible] sister.

Speaker 1:          00:49:22       What is it? Sister sister's a, oh Christ. I can't even fucking read. You know what it is? I put it into a different document and it doesn't show it. For some reason capital letters don't show up and it's this new fucking computer. I'm just not liking it. I have to read this because I think this is a funny title. Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on. It was funny. It was it. Hang on, hang on, hang on. You know what that's from a long time ago when fucking, uh, when a Eric Clapton did a unplugged and they play dead stupid, wooed you.

Speaker 6:          00:50:01       No money, like

Speaker 1:          00:50:03       9 million times that fucking summer and you want to kill yourself. But he, he's got a moment and during that that is unplugged where you start to song and he fucks up and he goes, oh, hang on, hang on, hang on. Hang on. Some reason that is stuck in a loop in my head. Anytime I fuck up, I saw that thing 20 years ago and anytime I fuck up to this day, I go, hang on, hang on, hang on. I'm all right. Sisters a through C IR we go, uh, tired of giving

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       advice to guys with psycho suicidal girlfriends or people with STDs. Well, I got something a bit lighter for few here. A kind of like the cores light version of your typical advice. Thank you. And is perfect for the middle of the summer. We kicked my feedback on this one. So I know this lady who I'd been friends with uh, for a while now and banged one time. She's the oldest of three sisters, so we all call her sister a. About two years ago I made out with sister be in a club, not my initiative, um, and ended up having sex with there the same night. Jesus Christ. Dude, I went out with her. Do, do they have like that thing on the back of their SUV where they have the stick figures of the entire family and you just slowly keep exiting them out and the family doesn't understand if somebody's trying to kill my daughters. No, I'm just trying to fuck all of them, sir. Well, that's a relief. All right. Um, anyways, I went out with her for a while. Oh, this is sister B. And it was surprisingly not awkward when we were hanging out all together, even though everyone knew the situation. Jesus Christ, what's southern state are you in sir? Um, I'll go fuck yourself people down south. That was funny. Um, some months later, sister bea left me for one of her, one of my friends and got over it quickly enough.

Speaker 1:          00:51:53       Oh, when you got over it quickly enough. And nowadays I'm still in contact with sister a and B since I'm not the kind of guy that holds a grudge for that kind of stuff. Oh, there you go. It's very mature, which means you really didn't give a fuck about either one of them. So why are you going to be all upset? You know, like you own their pussy once you fuck it. I hate when, I hate when guys do that. Anyways, recently since sister see started talking to me more frequently after talking for a bit, she said she could pose for me since I'm a painter and she's a model and a 10 all the fucking way I might add, oh, you fucking creep. You fucking creep. You fucking creep. So she was a 10 the whole time. So basically you're in a holding pattern banging her oldest sisters waiting until this girl was of age so he could fucking painter Jesus Christ. I got to, I, you know, I might have to stand up and applaud this one. This guy is taking it to another level. This is a fucking epic situation here. So you go see, here's my question. Does that proposition mean anything? Do you need my advice? I need advice from you. How do you fuck every girl in the same family?

Speaker 5:          00:53:01       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:53:03       Jesus Christ. This is like, you know how long that's been a, it's been since it's been a triple crown winner in horse racing. The last time someone won the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness and the breeders' Cup. Is that what it is or is that a soccer match? I don't fucking know. I don't know. No fucking horse. Since the late seventies I would guarantee that it's been since the late seventies sent somebody has booze bank three. I think a lot can do two in one family, but to get all fucking three, two, three, two is a respectable three is no, it's beyond respectable. Two. Three. Okay. Everybody who was three years in the sporting world do that. That's a fucking dynasty. Okay. You just put yourself in there with fucking Bill Russell. You put yourself in there with, with, with the fucking, uh, Magic Johnson Lakers. You know, I wouldn't say the Colby Lakers. You know, when you go out and you get Phil Jackson and fucking shack, then that's that new shift that the kids like.

Speaker 1:          00:58:19       All right. You got to do it. You got to fucking do it. All right. Here we go. Next one. Bill. Fight over. Picture with you is billion. My girl and I drove up from San Francisco to see you in San Jose. You didn't drive up. You drove down. If up to you means south. I don't know. What the fuck are you doing? Um, and it was awesome. Thank you. Uh, we were at the show where that lunatic in the front row was giving you a pastry or a pumpkin after every fourth joke. Nah, they were nice. This fucking lady, just like lady, she fucking brought it. She made an ACDC pumpkin. She, she made a bunch of muffins and she brought cookies. It was like every, I guess I had three jokes about food and she just sort of brought them up to the stage. She was nice.

Speaker 1:          00:59:04       I know what you mean though. It got a little crazy. But once she had actually, uh, made the ACDC Pumpkin anyways, I've seen you three or four times. Uh, but this is the first time since I've been listening to a first time since I've been listening to the podcast. So the show over and my girl starts going on and on about how I need to get a picture with you. Uh, no one fence bird, but I don't want a picture with you or with anyone. I don't know personally. Well that's cool. He goes, uh, well Megan, maybe Megan Fox. That totally makes sense. Um, yeah, and I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm not offended. You think like fucking standing there at the end of the show with people with the cell phone cameras that they hand to somebody else and they don't know how to work them and then they fucking, you know, even when they hit the right button, you've got to stand there for like nine seconds before finally clicks.

Speaker 1:          00:59:53       It's a nightmare. Um, so I'm glad one less person I had to do that with. So he goes, uh, anyways. And I just feel like I was some, if I was some pseudo celebrity, I wouldn't want to be taking pictures with any dudes though. Did you have to really bring me down to fucking earth like that? You can't. This guy's a fucking cunt. I know what level I'm at your fucking deck. You don't need to take my knees out anyways. Uh, what does he say? I don't want to take any pictures with dudes. Just chicks. Yeah, that does make sense. Is this guy son? He likes the others guys like, like trying to be my friend while he's subtly giving me shit. This is, I call this the Greg Fitzsimmons. This is what Greg does. Greg compliments you and Barry's the insult in the middle.

Speaker 1:          01:00:39       He's a five minute for all I know. Fitzsimmons is do this. Fitzsimmons wrote this because I think he realizes that I figured him out. So he's like, well, now what's another way I can get him? I know. I'll send an email and pretend to be somebody else. Sorry. That's my conspiracy theory kicking in. Um, anyways, that's the whole point, right? So, uh, I go to the bathroom and when I get back in the line to get a pic with you, it's about 30 deep. My girl at this point is still nagging after I already told her I'm not interested in taking a picture with bill burr. Uh, now I got to get it. Now I've got to turn into an asshole because she's still nagging me about this. And I have to certainly say, I don't want to take a picture. I'm not waiting in that line.

Speaker 1:          01:01:16       I don't need you thinking for me. Let's go. Well, that's what you should do, but you shouldn't do it with anger. So we go outside and she starts going on and on about me being homosexual. Yeah, that's her logic. I did wait in line to take a picture with you so that automatically makes me quit. Quit. He said in earned Insert Boston accent. I just kept asking her why was she trying to start a fight with me? Uh, we had a great time and now this, I told her my hero growing up was Chris Cornell and I wouldn't even want a picture with him or an autograph. I don't understand the desire to bug complete strangers for a picture or an autograph. Dude, I totally get this. Uh, he goes Florentine does it all the time and brags about her on his podcast, but he thinks, uh, black tubes who keep the tags on their hats or match their shoes with their hats is gay.

Speaker 1:          01:02:06       Uh, they're both gay by the way. Oh, what? Getting a picture and that dude, you just took a whole fucking left turn there he goes, my girl isn't a fan of yours and thinks you're a sexist pig, but you turned her with your performance in San Jose. So what do you, what do you make of this billion? Yeah, that's weird. She didn't even like me. And then you go there and then she's demanding that you get a picture. Am I queer? Because I didn't want to get in line and wait for you to take a picture for a half hour with you. Uh, no you're not. You're a fucking guy who knows what he wants. And you wanted, you went there, you saw the show, you had a good time. You wanted to fucking leave. That's what you should have done. And what's with chicks trying to make you do shit you don't want to do? Um, I don't know. You got to ask them. I have no fucking idea.

Speaker 2:          01:02:49       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:02:50       Because you know what it is. They feel that they know what's good for you. They honestly feel that. And they'll tell it to you with a straight face and a then all a front. Yeah, we do. If you just listen to us [inaudible] like they think that they have life figured out and the reality is, is they have part of life figured out, you know, and that's why you need them. You know, they have that fucking, uh, let's spruce up the place. Let's a fucking do some shit that makes you feel uncomfortable, but secretly you really want to fucking do, you know, they know that.

Speaker 2:          01:03:27       So

Speaker 1:          01:03:29       what happens is, is I think that they think that they know that all the time. So that was some shit where you like, dude, I don't want to do this. And she thinks that no, you're just being a guy right now and this is like, this is going to go into your, this is fucking gay zone. So they think you just be in a fucking macho guy when they don't realize that sometimes it's like, no, seriously, I really don't want to do this. I really don't want to go to brunch. I really don't want to go to your girlfriends fucking birthday party where we dress up like it's the 1940s I really, I honestly, from the bottom of my heart, I don't want to fucking do this. I don't secretly long to do this, but I'm worried that my friends are gonna make fun of me.

Speaker 1:          01:04:07       I seriously don't want to fucking do this. Okay. But the thing is, this is guy is you're gonna say it like that and then they go, you know, you're angry. Why you being mean to me? Um, I dunno. That's why chicks trying to make you do shit that they don't want you don't want to do. And also a lot of them are selfish cons just like us. Um, and if they want to do something and they think it's awesome, they can't figure out why you don't think that it's awesome. And He, you know, all right, I think I explained that 58 fucking times. Um, and go fuck yourself with a pseudo celebrity thought that, that, that was completely unnecessary. You know, fucking content that actually hurt my feelings even though I know it's true.

Speaker 2:          01:04:47       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:04:47       All right, well here we go. What do we got a first date and money? I gotta I gotta step it up here, man. What time is it? Oh, an hour and four. I got to get out of this.

Speaker 2:          01:04:55       Fuck,

Speaker 1:          01:04:57       I gotta get Outta here. All right. First, what does a, first of all, I led the podcast, but blah, blah, blah. I'm 20 years old. Still in college and newly single. I decided to try my hand on dating again. I met this girl on Facebook. We message each other for hours before I decided to ask her out on a date. She accepted Jesus Christ. Dude, she's probably sitting there like, my thumbs are aching. Well, you fucking ask me out. Uh, she accepted. We made plans for me to pick her up. Uh, this would be the first date I've had in four months I'd build, replaced with, which was around 20 minutes from where I live. We went to the mall, which is where everyone basically goes into the weekends. So I thought that I would, it would be a good place to go. When we got there, we would decide.

Speaker 1:          01:05:35       We were deciding on what to do. That's not a good game plan, dude. You should know where you're going to go and what you're going to do just to get it going. So then she'd do you feel like, you know, this guy knows what's what's going on. All of a sudden you're making decisions and all of a sudden she's taken her pants off. That's how it works. All right? You can't go there. You can't treat them like peers. You've got to put them beneath you. You've got to have him looking at the floor that way they don't get to say good night to nobody. What movie? Pauper. Greenwich village. I did a bad version of that. Um, anyways, when we got there, we were deciding on what to do. I suggested a, we watch a movie. Uh, but nothing good was playing. Say You fucked yourself.

Speaker 1:          01:06:11       So instead we decided to eat dinner. Applebee's, we ate at this restaurant in the mall and talked about getting to know each other. At the end of dinner. I paid because I was told the man pays on a first date. What I wasn't told was whether or not I should pay for extra stuff. Oh my God. We started, well, first of all, you already set a precedence that you're paying. The second you pay, you're paying for the whole fucking evening. Okay. And fuck all the women right now going, right? Yes. Right. Go Fuck Yourself. You fucking free. Cons. Uh, we started walking around and we go into a few stores and she starts looking at things around the store saying, I wish I had money to do to buy this. I wish I had enough money to buy that. So what I did, because I was trying to be the gentlemen and impressed her, was offered to pay for those things she wanted.

Speaker 5:          01:07:00       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:07:01       Ah, dude. Ah, you just fucked yourself. She totally doesn't respect you anymore. You got used. I ended up buying or some sunglasses, a shirt address and some shoes and a necklace on a first date. Dude, on a first date the first night out with you, just getting to know you, you buy her dinner and all this shit. Cedar relies on the second date. If it's going to go any further, as you know, relationship has to move forward. Let me do you have to buy or even more shit. All added up to around 120 bucks, not including the dinner. After that, I drove her back to her place and that was it. Of course it was

Speaker 5:          01:07:35       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:07:35       Jesus Christ. You bought her a bunch of shit like you were already fucking her.

Speaker 5:          01:07:40       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:07:40       That was like her blowing you and then asking, can you take me to a movie? Yeah, yeah, I'll get right on that. It's not happening anyways. We'd gone out for more times since then. Of course she is. She's trying to get a whole fucking wardrobe audio and the only thing I got out of this girl was a makeout session. Yeah, that was a sympathy one. To be honest. I wasn't really expecting to get anything from this girl. So why did you buy all this shit? Dude,

Speaker 1:          01:08:06       you've got to work on your self esteem here, man. You set yourself up to be a SAP and that's exactly what's happening here. This is all on you and you have the power to change this shit. All right. Take this fucking girl out next time. Not Her. Somebody else. Cause you've already ruined it with this one. Okay, fine. Another girl, take her out when you take her out. No, where the fuck are you going to go and know what you're going to do. Okay. And when she goes, no, I wish I had that. Well, hey, you know, maybe you ought to work some overtime this week. You know, don't say that, but just think that. Go Fuck Yourself. And uh, you know, and just be silent when they say that shit, then they'll realize they overstepped some shit and uh, you know, they probably feel like they got to make up for it by a maybe given you a handy. Um, anyways, he, I'm going to plow through this shit after telling my friends about the first date, whoever all my friends said what I did was wrong. I shouldn't have done that. All my lady friends said what I did was sweet and rare for a guy to do. Yeah. Because they want us to buy him shit.

Speaker 1:          01:09:05       It's got me at the crossroad of who to listen to more listened to the guys on your team. Stop going on cross enemy lines and trying to figure out what the fuck you supposed to do. All right, fuck all that. The only time you talked to broads is if you're trying to, well, what should I get her for a birthday? What's some chick shit that you guys like? That's what you do. Okay. You don't fucking ask them. You know, should I spend all my money? Yeah, that would be sweet.

Speaker 2:          01:09:32       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:09:32       Yeah. Don't listen to them. Listen to your friends to set you straight, dude. You dropped 120 fucking bucks and you didn't even get kissed. She got everything she wanted. You didn't get anything.

Speaker 2:          01:09:43       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:09:44       Yeah. Fuck all that dude. Fuck all that. All right. Don't ask women advice about fucking women. Like don't, okay.

Speaker 2:          01:09:54       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:09:55       Immediately you, you're making it an away game. Okay. You fucking talk to you guy friends. All right. And I'm not talking about like, you know, getting the end Athol advice cause the guys, we'll give you stupid fucking advice to case in point myself. But like when it comes to shit like that where you're basically, when you feel like you went too far, the women are always going to side with going too far in their direction. You know what I mean? That would be like if a girl came up to a guy and said, listen, my boyfriend wants to like, you know, possibly bring another girl into the bedroom. Should I do that? I mean, what the fuck are you going to say and what are they going to say?

Speaker 1:          01:10:40       No, come on. All right, here we go. Dilemma Bill. Imagine you met a girl. She's beautiful. Has a great body, funny and totally into you. I did. She lives with me. Oh, this is a mixed of points. Anyways, the night's going great and you having a good time together and she goes home with you. Uh, so back at your place. You're making out and things are getting pretty hot and heavy. She starts to undress and she has great tits. Oh my God. Then she takes her pants. Serve eal. She's wearing an adult diaper. You have to diaper is unsoiled. Is it still a deal? Yes, it is. Absolutely. 100 fucking percent deal breaker done over. That's it. It's over. I'm thinking you peeing and shitting and my Dick has a is slumped over and is like, Bill, you enjoy the rest of your evening cause I'm calling it a day. Absolutely a fucking deal breaker. Apps of Fuckin lutely cause that's gonna take me, it takes me immediately back to a horrifying situation that I had. I think I told this story before. I'll tell it really quick cause I gotta get Outta here. Uh, hooked up with this girl fucking hot, sexy fucking super tall like model type chick to the point where we'd like doggy style. She had to like fucking like her, her, her, she was too high.

Speaker 1:          01:12:03       I'm going to plow through this because this is disgusting. If you don't like disgusting stories, plow through the next fucking 30 seconds. All right, fast forward to her. Alright, whatever. So we hooked up and everything. We started in the living room, we ended up in the bedroom. Okay. So you know that shit with his, like the trail of clothes. The next morning she's picking up her stuff. I'm trying to help her out. I see your little fucking panties there in the, uh, and the living room. And, um, I went over to them and, uh, there was a, uh,

Speaker 1:          01:12:32       oh, this is, this freaks me out. There was a fucking, I would say at least three, two and a half to three inches. Fucking Skidmark in her fucking panties. I know. Disgusting. Oh yeah. So it's a deal breaker. Listen to the sound of my voice when I tell that story. It was just, it was fucking horrific. Alright. Overrated. Underrated, underrated. Moving apartment. Okay. Underrated. Moving apartment at six in the morning and drinking j a j d at noon, listening to ACDC on your new balcony in the sun while looking at all the rest of the douchebags unpacking their truck with shit they don't need. You moved at six in the morning and nobody complained. What the fuck do you care? Right. You're moving out. Um, overrated vacuuming. Uh, there's no way to do this without looking at feminine.

Speaker 3:          01:13:23       Ah, it's a fucking

Speaker 1:          01:13:25       great bit, man. You could actually sell it to a comedian. You could fucking kill with that. He goes, you got to limp wristed Lee. Hold that cord out. Like tinker bell with a wand. There's just no manly way to vacuum. Can't be done. It can't. That is a woman's job. It's just fucking over theirs. It's like wearing an apron. There's just no way to do it. You, the only way to wear an apron is a guy is that it has to be that solid white one. You have to have all the other white matching shit like uh, like your, your, your uh, uh, uh, a fucking gourmet chef and you have to be a fat gourmet chef. Other than that, you look like a Douche. Um, underrating sweeping, good old sweeping with a broom. Possibly saw dust from the, you just built. You can get out, you can get your elbows into it.

Speaker 1:          01:14:14       No risk involved. Yeah. But then you get like that minor lung cause you kick up all the dust. Um, I'm actually like a neat freak and messy and I actually enjoy fucking vacuuming. But every once in a while I'll walk by a mirror and I'll see myself and I will burst out laughing or I'll immediately get embarrassed thinking of all my fucking crazy friends suddenly bursting and seeing me vacuuming and just trashing me. Unmercifully for like two hours. All right. Under the losing weight, once I turned 30, I decided I needed to get back into shape. I was 300, a 300 pound tub of shit and even XXL shirts were starting to feel snug at 300 pounds. Fuck yeah. Jesus Christ. Um, I haven't even really put on a ton of a ton of effort into it yet, but just by lifting weights every other day, riding my bike four or five times a week, and by eating real food, I've been losing about 10 pounds a month for the last four months.

Speaker 1:          01:15:12       Good for you, dude. That's fucking awesome. I love that shit. Now, the best part is that for every 10 pounds I lose the weight of the girls who are interested goes down by 30 pounds. Isn't that sad? Poor women, this, they just don't have enough people to choose from. That's great too. That's good for you though. And I was thinking being older helps somehow to, maybe it's just knowledge and confidence, but I get hotter chicks now than I could when I was 21 and in better shape. Yeah. Because you know something that's also this, this certain women out there that they find guys that a little fucking overweight, uh, they find you less intimidating, you know, as opposed to some guy standing there like a shredded a, it's like, believe it or not, they actually get intimidated too. You would think because they have the fucking balls that they wouldn't, but some of them dope hour in 60 minutes or running my, Yap. Look at that. I almost brought you all the way to break time or lunchtime by the time I get this fucking thing up. All right. That's the podcast for this week. Go fuck yourselves. I'll talk to you next week. Please keep all the great emails coming. Uh, once again, the email is bill at the [inaudible] podcast.com. Don't take any shit. Go Fuck Yourself. I'll talk to you next week.
