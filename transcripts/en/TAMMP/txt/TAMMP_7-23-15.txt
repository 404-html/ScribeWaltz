Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:02          Hey, how are you? Um, it's the, uh, Thursday afternoon, Monday morning podcast just before Friday and just checking in.

Speaker 1:          00:14          Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:14          How's your week going? [inaudible] you know, you know something. I got this dumb ass show on TV in the background with some chick fucking who's using way too much moose in her hair and she's got like nine zillion fucking dollars in debt. Just got to dumb parents who also use a bunch of fucking moose in their hair and somehow she's so out of control. They have to go on television to Friday to try it near check podcast. I know this, the show is crazy. Where she, she, everybody that were Maria. Yes. Romaji job. Let's talk about this brought here. She is so much most in her hair. She looks shit faced even when she's sober. It's a show here in Montreal, Canada, maybe monorail, ballsy called Princess. Some of them off the ends are dollar signs. And I guess the whole premise of this show is to get these young spoiled women who are just

Speaker 2:          01:11          out of control with their spending to get a wake up call and learn how to be responsible. But she has like boozy eyes to saying her dad, she has a dad the same. Yes. Booze eyes. They advertise, they have like bedroom eyes. They're kind of like look like they about to go to sleep heavy eyebrows. I sound terrible right now. I think cause I, you didn't have any booze last night. You somehow just a guy, I didn't have a cigar but I had drank booze and I sound like, like you drank some booze. Yeah, we'll look at, now she's back out. We got this on the background. She's sitting there, she's going out to the, I don't understand people that lose control of their kids. It's like you're taller than them, you know, you just intimidate them. Well she's not a child. She's like 20 something years old.

Speaker 2:          02:00          So yeah, but the, it never should have got to this. Yeah. Well, that's the whole premise of this show and now she's going to like do chores and earn her keep and all that kind of stuff and she's going to learn a lesson. It's just, it's TV, it's fake. I'll turn it off. I understand. I understand it's that, but you can't tell me that this is not actually people that lose control of their kids. Yeah, she is a fucking mess. You can't marry that mass. She's unmarriageable with that fucking hair. She looks like she fucking Moses it with ges. Oh, she just looks like a total party whore. There's not one guy. It's going to look at that other than the only, his only thought is going to be like a fuck that. That's all you're gonna do with that. Well that's all she's concerned about right now. So what do you think party on Wayne? What do you think about maybe that's all she's confirmed forward. She's still fucking dope.

Speaker 2:          02:54          Yeah. So yeah, a lot of young girls are like, go wow, your party it up. Yolo and whatnot. We, you stopped seeing this. I don't see it on like on a regular basis. Saying that I don't say right. The Instagram pinched to grandma and yet too fucking old, let's say Yolo, I'm too old to be participating in the call. You don't know. It helps my act because you know all the pop stars Shit. What was, you know, I was surprised. I knew that Taylor swift song last night. I was very surprised that they tell me the name of it and I'll sing it shaken up. Oh yeah. Players gonna play, play, play, play and somebody is gonna hate. Shake it off. Shake it up. Shake it. Yeah. Cause you play that shit. I fucking hate that song. Play that shit. Is that literally written on a piece of paper?

Speaker 2:          03:52          Players want to play because she go dot, dot, dot. Or she really right. Play, play, play, play, play of whenever. I'm sure she did. I got creeped out by her. I always think she looks like a, like a, like a little fucking sexed up mere cat to me. Jeremy. That's like up on her hind legs looking at the whole, you know, she looks very, I think she's tall and then she wears heels and so yeah, she's very, I just remember on 60 minutes and alert when we were watching her and the little girls would be screaming in the upper deck and she would look up there and she would just sort of mouth, oh my God. It was the fucking phoniest. I think even if I was sick, I'd be like, this a, this lady's fake. This is fake. She's not blown away by this right now. She's just trying to, maybe if you were that far, what am I at six years old with a sport coat on up in here, like I know what's going on. I probably be like, why is my little six year old Dick? Sorry.

Speaker 2:          04:55          Listen, it's not something that you can relate to, but the first time you're a little kid and had fucking stands up, you don't understand. When I first understood that it was related to sex, I was in a fucking tree. Fort Wright and this kid had stolen playboys from his dad is the 70s we didn't have the internet like these kids, we could actually watch video of real people, fucking poor kids. So he, we were looking at the things, right. We were sitting there, you know, in the tree fort and there was like five of us looking at him and this other kid fucking balled up his fist and punched me in the Dick. And I was like, oh, that's when I realized like, oh, so what's going on with my dick is going on with everybody else's Dick. And that's what happens when you look at naked women. What's, that's how I learned, cause somebody punched me right in my fucking little hard on. Ouch. Yeah. I take strong. It took it, took it on. The Chin was rolled out the round. God got back to the corner, you know, through some water on it. Anyways.

Speaker 2:          06:01          Yeah. So I know a little bit about pop culture. Who are some of the other, uh, uh, ladies of a, or maybe guys, I know a few people. You do. Do you know who one direction is one direction? The, the, the, uh, the, the Biebers, right. They all got the Bieber, the Bieber hair, and they all face the crowd. When they sing one direction, they, they send it out as a weird name for them to be called because I assume the whole thing is like, we only go in one direction and that's up, but they should call it same direction because when that band flop, sorry, that was really bad. Um, I'm not offering you, but this or not. I'm fucking crushing it. People are liking. I just sank Taylor swift into first fucking six minutes. It's no what, what? Um, what's one of the songs they sing up, but I know they have a song, I think call you. You don't know. You're beautiful.

Speaker 2:          07:07          What they, you don't know. You're beautiful. That's what makes you beautiful. Or something like that. Despite the fact she robbed me. And you calves are rarely fat. I Dunno. I have to be honest with you. I don't fuck freckles, but it's not about all that. That's pretty close. Sad. You're fucking beautiful. And I'd let you suck my Dick in the back of tour bus. You got to go out the window. You know what the other band mates to see it. Oh my God. He's thinking to me some boy band lyrics right there. Yeah. Did you say hanging tough earlier? Yeah. Shout out to Joe. Joey Mack from the heat, from the um, the he yay. My favorite new kid. Joe Mac. But really what were your options you had to do with the mosquito face, right? What do you mean mosquito fan? Yeah, the other guy who wasn't mark Walberg and I got the other guy who looked like the guy with the mosquitoes. They were brothers. And I know you're talking about, I like Donny. Give me a fucking break. I gotta make it funny. Donny dated Halle Berry. Are you kidding me? Like Donnie was crushing it back in the day.

Speaker 2:          08:28          When did he date her? Well, when he was on the cop show, like in the 80s, maybe early nineties, she was like 14. She wasn't, there was options for every girl with that band yet. Tough guy. Donny, Donny. And then you had Jordan his sang in that crazy false that, oh, with the dark hair. Right. And then you had the brothers. Dot. Think I'm combining them with like fucking one of those other bands like Oh, town or, uh, why do you keep bringing up old town? I feel like I heard you say, oh Tom, last night during your show, did you say, oh, town during your ear bit.

Speaker 2:          09:05          Hey, it's my fuck. [inaudible] lady. I remember. No, but a flash. It was a boy band. They were, well they were called. I was the guy with the, he had this synchronized tattoos. Yeah. Yes, exactly. I want to on that side. Then later on he shot heroin in the same vein on both sides. And then he was on the Rehab show. Steven Adler. Yeah. Wait, what's he, oh, was he in celebrity rehab? Well anyway, yes. He was kind of, they were kind of a boy band ish. I think you can tell by this podcast that yes, there is a presidential election coming up.

Speaker 2:          09:46          I love how much you're getting annoyed by Donald Trump. This guy's the most entertaining thing. That's ever since other than that fat so that they had up here in Toronto and only annoyed because you were the one that was trying to like get me to prove to you that other people thought that Donald Trump was an asshole long, long ago and you were like, prove it. Prove it. What are your sources? All that night I was hammered sores that came up did before we, I gave up drinking. I was fucking hammered and I watched one of his speeches and I wanted to hear it because it was a great piece of comedy and you will fucking kill that guy. I can't believe you said that. Like this guy's actually going to become president. Like it's this as he's like the fucking guy the first week on American idol who can't fucking sing. It's just funny to watch. I love what we gave out. That person's phone number, like a seventh grade girl fucking deal with that. Do you think he fucking, he did a little flip to his cowlick after he did that? Yeah. He's just an asshole though. John Mccain is a war hero because he got caught. He got captured fucking terrible thing to say. I know it's terrible.

Speaker 2:          10:59          I know, but his above his head. Can I tell you this right now? And you say he's, he's a hero because he got captured. I know, but here's the thing you do. You know who has the right to get offended by that John Mccain, why can't I be offended? Because you never went to war. And that means that because I didn't have that direct experience. I can't have a strong reaction to you can, you know you cannot be offended. You shouldn't be offended by, you can be, you can sit there and have empathy and be like, wow, that's a really fucked up thing to say to John Mccain, but to sit there and literally get offended like he owes you a fucking apology. You weren't net bamboo fucking cage. Is that what it's about being about being offended about something like you shouldn't be offended because you didn't experience it.

Speaker 2:          11:45          You can just feel like, I don't understand that rationale. You feel like if someone's offended by something, they're taking it super, super personally. Look, I can sit there and I could watch that and realize what he said was completely fucked up. I can see why it's so fucking fun. The fact that he's going to offend so many people by saying it makes it fucking hilarious. Watching his reaction to people being offended is fucking hilarious. But the people that went through it, they're the ones who are truly fucking affect. Like how would, uh, it's, it's insulting to John Mccain for me to get fucking offended by it. Like, oh, it hurt. Did it hurt your bill is you sit there and your pj's, you fucking marry here. Just coming at it from light, that comedian perspective though. You guys have this whole thing about people being offended.

Speaker 2:          12:32          That's what, that's all I'm not, I can be offended by what Trump says and not have been in the war myself. I can be and not, not that. Like I'm offended for John Mccain. He can obviously fend for himself. The man, I think the guy can fend for himself. He was fucking tortured. He didn't break. But I can be like I'm, I'm fucking offended by that. As what other people who have any respect for what? John Mccain. Why don't you just say I don't approve what you said Donald and you need to grow up and I feel like I could say that to you cause you don't have my cell phone because I can be offended if I want to. I don't know why you were saying that. I can't be offended by it. I said it's the wrong wording. I think it's childish for you to be offended.

Speaker 2:          13:14          All right. I think, I think you just want to, you want to be part of the group like yeah, that affected me too. Yeah, exactly where I'm coming from. I'm all about being a part of the group offended this week about something. Yep. That's my emo. Why do you hate me? They donate it. Do you always, you know what you have to, you know what shit deal is near look deal is you always got to take me down a fucking notch. You just got to make sure I get, what am I, what am I doing over here? And you, Oh, you're telling me I can't be offended. I guess that's kind of an asshole move. I wish you wouldn't be offended. I wish people who didn't go to war. I, look, if you've got to fucking relative, that's in the military. I'll give you that too. But people like me and I do. I do. Oh good. My Dad was in the fucking navy. I mean I don't fucking sit there acting like, you know, I have some direct connection with the military. I'm a softie. All right.

Speaker 2:          14:10          I never got a deferment, but I would have second, I was out there marching in the sun. I can't take, oh, pick up your fucking cover pile. And that's what they were saying that he like a avoided the draft like five times. I hate when they say that about rich people. What do you mean why they avoided the draft? Yeah, of course they did. Of course they did. They did exactly what you would have done if you had hundreds of millions of fucking dollars, you wouldn't have gone. I love all these fucking people that act like if they were sitting there, you know with a Butler that they'd fucking join the marines and be on the front lines and they would have fought. They wouldn't have, you would have done the same fucking thing that they did. I would think that he knows. Some people like they, they volunteer for that Shit. Even today they're like, I want to go and you know something. Those people are so few and far between that they make movies about them. And I'm not talking about people that volunteer. I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about somebody that's sitting there with a golden spoon

Speaker 2:          29:39          Yes, they happen and I'd been having a great time during the goddamn comedy jam. I had a good time. You can send that one night. Yes I did. I played all right. You've played really, really well. Yeah, so I did and tonight you're going to yeah, I got my last comedy jam. I'm doing the Ron Bennington unmasked. Uh Huh. And then I got on Mass Gilbert. What's behind those freckles and the freckles, the bill birth story. You'll feel like when you got punched in your six year old Dick that then informed you as a comedian. Wait, why did the kid punched you? Because we were all looking at naked girls up the playboys and it was like all the old days back when you didn't have play dates and shit and you stole stuff from somebody else's dad and you looked at it and there was kids of all different age groups so they understood what the fuck was going on and the kid fuck any did the all right dear Fred did my fucking Dick.

Speaker 2:          30:35          I ain't, you know, I learned something. What did you learn from that? That that happens when you look at a naked woman and that it hurts to get punched again. And on that note, Oh, it hurts even more when it's fucking standing up. Um, all right, sorry if you guys envisioning that this has been the Thursday afternoon, just before Friday, Monday morning podcast, I got turned around in that, um, I got one more day here before I go back. I had just a great time last night, um, before show was awesome and then this check second show went to a whole other level. And um, you know what, I was up here. I've been dressing up, you know when our old sport coat here trying to out French the frogs and a French Canadian. That's right. You know it was great. Last night was, I actually was talking about and I brought up, you know I was flying into Boston.

Speaker 2:          31:28          Somebody yelled, Boston sucks and did they? Why did I just stopped by? I said, why? Because we win all the championships and they were like, oh yeah, oh yeah. I rubbed it in, I fucking rubbed it in and then they tried to give me shit about the Bruins trades and it's stupid. Don't do that. Montreal Canadien fans. All right. Because then I could just say, well, we'll least, we want a cup in this century, and then they go, well, we want blah, blah, blah, and I just started singing glory days. They'll pass you by glory days and the wink of booing Patrick Wall. All right, that's the podcast for this Thursday. I hope you guys have.

Speaker 1:          32:08          Thanks and I'll talk to you on Monday. Hey, what's going on? It's milk bar.

Speaker 5:          32:58          This is a very special edition of the Monday morning podcasts. Those of you who are longtime listeners, all 15 of you,

Speaker 6:          33:06          um, you know, every once in a while I will, um, rather than Babel for an hour about the inane shit that pisses me off. I'll actually bring in, uh, a comedian friend of mine and like I told you these only guys that I respect, only people that I find funny hack lists hacklabs podcasting here and today we are a, have the pleasure of having on our show the wonderful, the talented, the cock suck in Greg Fitzsimmons everybody. What's up Gregory? I got to tell you. And being a standup comedian and you know, in the media in general, there is, what other job begins with a stroking session, you know, I mean I really needed that. I had a shit day and I'm sitting here in your house, you've invited me out so I know I'm not a hack. And then you get a nice little build up.

Speaker 6:          33:53          This guy is a good guy. What if you were a plumber? You think you'd show up at someone's house? We think it's shit and knee deep in there. Get in there and clean up the shit. I know that's like my dad's a dentist. I worked with him when I was younger, then just handed him the shit is, he yanked off the teeth and every other person will come in. The first thing he's saying, first of all, just wanna let you know I hate the dentist. And that's all he heard all day long. Number one, suicide rate of any profession. Is that right? Yeah, that's absolutely true. Well, give it up for my dad for hanging in there. We all did you notice a lot of depression in him? Uh, no. Jesus Christ. We've really gone deep here and me. Yes. Not In him. Jesus. I got a two man lately.

Speaker 6:          34:28          It's hit me hard. No, but I got a beat. I know how to beat it. I actually, now I stepped back and I observe the thoughts in my head and I just see a bad one. I'm like, do I want to, uh, do I want to spoon with that idea for the next fucking three days? Yeah. And hate my life. I literally, I'll go out, I'll go on a hike. I find that walking around and getting the blood going and just start telling myself lies. You're amazing. You're amazing. See what you just did though. That's exactly. Look like music on. And I fantasize that I'm playing it like I'm Stevie Ray Vaughan and it gets me out of it. Well, I took a yoga class yesterday. That helps me a lot because not only you get the physical exertion, your deep breathing, and then there's hot ass every direction, all getting stretched out.

Speaker 6:          35:12          That's why I, in another life I would do, I would be like that, that Yoga instruction shit. Oh hell yeah. Yeah. You get a pony tail. You would, and not only do these women have hot bodies, they give a shit about themselves enough to go to a place to make themselves better. I'm all stretched out before you bang them, Greg. I mean it's like, I used to go to this one out in Santa Monica and this guy was why I, it was because it wasn't that chanting shit. It was the teacher was this angry guy trying to be happy. So I totally related to him, but he used, he used to do, this is true dude, this and he was a great teacher and he used to, he used to be teaching the class while subtly putting out how sensual he was during lovemaking. You'd like, he would be like, he would just, yeah, I can't even she do that with your podcast, man.

Speaker 6:          36:02          It wouldn't work at this point. And people know I hate women. Yeah. Individually. I like women one on one, but as a group, when they all start yammering around a table like that fucking show the view. I mean, I mean, yeah, when I look at the view or I think of, uh, uh, what was that? Just sex and the city or now cougar town. I really do. I say to myself, women, the best is the Bachelorette party. That's what sums up with all those shows are, it's an attempt by women to be men instead of being women in a group. When you're with a woman alone, they are empathetic, acted emotional there, everything that you kind of want to dude one on one, but a guy can't go there. Like you have a strong female side and sometimes we really connect on that level, but very often you're just the angry dude.

Speaker 6:          36:50          But women are always, that means, but okay. No you don't. Funny. I was hoping that someone was gonna come here and finally actually compliment women after all the trashing that I've done. I'm like, Greg, he's married, he's got a couple of kids. This would be a nice thing. You come right in. Just kicking them right in the Twat. But he told me about, I said, you're a sensitive guy. No, not me. I was talking about like women you like, they want to be mellow. I was just picturing all of them rolling their eyes. Well, let's actually pick, let's pick a strong female role. Know we like who's abroad out there. You're like, I don't mind those women who stand on the sidelines. I liked their business suits. The football games. Oh yeah. Shoulder pads and a skirt. Why don't you just get in the fucking game sweetheart.

Speaker 6:          37:34          No, you don't. To me, it's like, you know, my wife and I've been with her for 11 years and you know I, I'm one of the few comedians that can tell you I fucking love my wife. I have not had a day in my life that I didn't think. How did I get this check? And she's perfect. There you go. And you've met her. Now she's the greatest, isn't Jayla. I knew she was a good one. That time when we were, we were driving back from Boston. Holy that we did this gig somewhere in Boston or Rhode Island for like two or three weeks. Where are we going to, where are we going anyway? Yeah. Anyways, whatever. We, I thought we were doing a Gig. It was, you meet Tom Carter. We were going to a wedding. It was Robbie Prince, his wedding. Yah, Austin. Cause I didn't go to Shannon.

Speaker 6:          38:21          No, no. Okay. Well let's just get to the meat of the story. Okay. Well coming back, Tom Carter was hung over and you and me are in the car doing the Boston accent on 11 and just saying the most ignorant racist shit you could possibly say. AIDS, Joe Jo, everything, just total green room, standup comedy, just driving Tom nuts. Trying to make a few key. Remember that. And Eric, I remember. What's the laugh laughing the entire time at the ridiculousness of it. My favorite part was when it got quiet and Tom Thought after two states of doing it that we'd finally given up and we drove over this bridge and there was this, this lake or something underneath and you and the back just go water.

Speaker 6:          39:07          Which of course started it all up again. A Fitzy, you're fucking fudge pig. Let's get some beers. Go down the Cape, beat up some colored kids. Oh, three states, three states. We did that and just watching Tom just being like, dude, it's not funny anymore from that trip to this day I do the Boston accent and it's immediate. It's like this Pavlovian response. She just starts laughing again. It's the worst. And I was reading George Carr. Did you read George Carlin before we get too deep and let's, let's get onto what you're hyping here. Greg Simmons actually wrote a book that's coming out. Uh, what's the name of it? It's called Dear Mrs Fitzsimmons dear Mrs Fitzsimmons and that will be available in stores when, well, he can preorder preorder now, which they actually just bumped up my, uh, you know, they do an order of the books. They just bumped up to a second order, are ready the chopping up a body next door.

Speaker 6:          40:00          Just ignore the smell of the podcasts. I love that they, um, so to the book, basically it's doing great. Preorder. Go to Fitz, dog.com Fatz dog. And it's a, basically my, it's about us. It's about Irish guys, a lot of anger that do the opposite of what they're told to do their whole life. Oh, there you go. So my mother saved every letter that was ever sent home from teachers. Police clipped out things from the newspaper when I was there, and then I saved them all from adulthood. So it's like, uh, my life through bad letters that were sent home. That's phenomenal. Man. Phenomenal. Yeah. And the Ebook is cool to have people buy the ebook. I've actually, I got celebrities. I, I can get a shoot you after this, who they read the letters. So when you're reading, when you're on your iPad you can, you can click on a particular letter and all of a sudden Pete Yorn is reading it or Zach Galifianakis or Natalie May.

Speaker 6:          40:54          So it's very hard on that div. Yeah, you're very, you know something I have to hand this to you is you're very, you're not afraid of the Internet the way I am. I am really, who's that guy? Andy Rooney. The 60 minutes. That's fine. Why is everybody going over to Facebook? I'm just younger and notice where he is on 60 minutes in that 30 seconds after the night commercial. Yeah. And he's just the, and I'm so trying not to be, that guy just hates everything new, but it really is like I really, you were ahead of the way with this podcast. You've been doing this longer than I have. Yeah. This appealed to my, a psychosis of just being by myself. Like I do this thing by myself every week just for like an hour. Do you ever pause it or do you go straight through it? Just go straight through and I do. I do what I do. Probably one out of four or five, I'm alone and I, they're my favorite one. If you start bombing, you just talk about how you're bombing and then people actually laugh at you. Struggling trying to get back on the, uh, the road to comedy people. I find I get more comments on the alone ones in any other ones. They're like, I love, I did one, I was down staying with my mom and Florida with my family and I went out, sat in her car

Speaker 1:          41:59          across the street from our condo and did one just ripping her a new asshole, hating everybody. And is by far the best podcast. Overrated for this week.

Speaker 6:          43:02          This is a great one. Overrated. When change let's, it says, I hate the annoying clink clink sound with a fucking passion. What is wrong with the people? Huh? What's wrong with people? Seriously, the world is not loud enough. You have to fucking add to it. You know, they, they do believe this sounds will make them better people or make life better. You know what dude? You want such a great role to you, right? Broke that fucking sentences. Oh, what do they believe the sounds will make them better people or make their life better? I found it most annoying and have an invasive, right? I find it the honor Jesus Christ. I'm never drinking on the podcast again. Go Fuck Yourself. All right. What is wrong with people? Where am I? I find it the most annoying and invasive thing I am forced to listen to, even with closed windows, but they're so peaceful.

Speaker 6:          44:00          Um, if you fucking like the sound, why don't you put him up inside your home and half the fucking fan going in any way? What gives anybody the right to push their taste on others? Dude, I totally agree. It's like if you're gonna make smokers smoke outside, then you want to make these fucking wind chime. People take that shit indoors. I can't tell you how annoying that is. You know what's annoying about it is it's an annoying sound that's trying to be fucking spiritual. That's what kills me. It's even, it's, it's more annoying than just the loud, annoying sound that's fucking annoying. Cause at least the loud annoying sound has to fucking courage to be annoying. Those fucking things. They actually, they're, they're there. You know what? When I go on Youtube and just get some fucking wind chime sounds for all you dumb [inaudible] out there who do yoga, you know and actually think that these fucking things sound good. Here we go. Wind fucking chimes. Youtube. Let's see what we got. Here we go. Yeah, cause somebody fucking loves him so much. They put up a video. Here we go for all you cats out there. Here it is.

Speaker 1:          45:05          Okay.

Speaker 7:          45:10          Okay.

Speaker 6:          45:13          I got to met. Those are nice. This isn't fair. This guy's got fucking, he's got the professional grade level ones. He thinks look like the exhaust on a God damn. Oh that's giant wind chimes. All right. I just learned something. I don't mind. Giant wind chimes. Oh, here's one. Here's the one of these little douchey ones you get at a fucking hardware store. It's typical youtube. You just can't put wind chimes. Elliot Bay, Beautiful Wind Chime is just the Cantisano. There it is.

Speaker 6:          45:51          You know what the great thing is, is they're made out of metal. So when you rip 'em off, you have a fucking blunt object to beat your neighbor to death with. That's what you do. And then you dip it and fucking peroxide bleach and you hook it back up again. Let those a and e comes to figure out that murder a man murdered on his porch. You know, somehow they'd find, you know, and a fucking, I dunno, an eighth of an inch of his face imprint on that fucking wind chime. If you ever watch shows and things, how they catch people, it's, it's like it's not even fucking fair.

Speaker 6:          46:28          Do you ever see the one as I take another healthy swap. I got news for you. I'm having another beer. This might be the new thing. I might do this shit Thursday night. Take a night off from stand up. Tell my chick to hit the fucking bricks. Is anything better than drinking your own goddamn house. It just makes you want to start screaming about the shit you own. You know I paid for this shit. You hear that old man downstairs, I'm going to get louder and he's going to come up here. That would be the ultimate podcast. You know the thing about old people is you always have to worry that they are a fucking, like they, they, they fought in a fucking work cause I never had, I never have. So I have total respect for fucking veterans and the fact that they still got it in him, you know, that would be insane. One night if I actually just totally pissed him off and he really did fight in the Korean War and he just fucking through whatever that fucking thing is your throw up when you, when you get to climb up the rope on the side of the building, you know that, that, that fucking land fish hook thing throws it up. Dan just climbs up, comes over my railing as I'm sitting here doing this podcast, half in the bag, he's got a kitchen knife between his teeth, like a fucking pirate.

Speaker 6:          47:42          What would I do? I've probably taken 12 karate classes in my life and they've all been like, you know, six years apart. Fucking guide coming in full. Lay me.

Speaker 1:          47:57          Okay.

Speaker 6:          47:58          You know?

Speaker 1:          47:59          Okay.

Speaker 6:          48:00          I don't fucking know. I just sat back and I just lost the screen here. Yeah. So whatever wind chimes are fucking overrated. They really are. But I got to tell you, if you get the giant ones, the giant ones, a nice listen to the giant ones. A giant ones have a nice tone to them. It's a little deeper. I think I figured it out.

Speaker 1:          48:17          Okay.

Speaker 6:          48:23          Come on man. You gotta admit that's not bad if you let go of the anger, your childhood, right? Like, oh, your anger for a second c sound of a ship in the background,

Speaker 8:          48:38          uh,

Speaker 6:          48:48          hoshin coming up on the beach. Yeah. We get to that point right when you're going to get relaxed and let go, and then he gets so fucking scared. You get right back into the anger and then you want to punch somebody in fucking yoga pants.

Speaker 1:          49:21          Okay. Okay.

Speaker 5:          49:48          Fucking went to go to this pizza place. I really try to do fun things. When I was in Portland, tried to be healthy. I went for a fucking hike. I was sticking with my smoothies, you know, dropping pounds here. And uh, anyway, somebody tells me that in, in Portland, they have this fucking room. They got this pizza parlor where they had the best God damn pizza and all the fucking northwest. So this guy has like this homemade goddamn doe and he only makes so much of it every day. And when he's done making the dough, he's done making pizza. Go Fuck Yourself. All right. So I'm like, well shit, I got to try this pizza. So I go on the Internet, I look up, I see where it is. It's right on Hawthorne Street, like 45th and Hawthorne, 46 and Hawthorne, something like that, right? So I'm like, all right, I gotta go check this fucking thing out.

Speaker 5:          50:39          So I allow, I get myself an hour and a half before the show to get there to get a God damn pizza, right? It's a fucking pizza. Okay. So I call up just something told me to call just to call this place. And uh, I call up the, it rings like 11, 12 fucking times and uh, nobody picks up. So my guy, you know what, they're probably busy. No big deal. I got an a, I'm, I'll get there. We're an hour and a half before, right? I get a God damn cab. I'm driving over there. Cab driver goes, oh, just to let you know, this guy's kind of like the pizza Nazis, like, like the, like the fucking a soup Nazi on Seinfeld. So I show up and I walk in. Lo and behold, the place is packed, but I see this little two top gets up, waitresses cleaning off the table. She walks away.

Speaker 5:          51:25          So I go over and I sit down getting ready to order the pizzas, checking out what people are ordering of getting excited is what I'm trying to tell you. And then the waitress comes over, she's like, um, well you over in the waiting room next door or did you just like walk in here and sit down? And I was like, um, I just came in and sat down. She goes, yeah, I'm, you have to like thein when I'm next door. You know those people, everything's, everything's a question you have to like sign in next door. And I'm like, oh, all right. I go, well, how long is the wait? She's like, wow, I can't really like say it's, you know, it's kind of busy at that point. He's like a quarter of it go, well, I got to show at eight. It's a quarter to seven. Am I going to have time to order a pizza and eat it? She's like, yeah, no,

Speaker 1:          52:16          now.

Speaker 5:          52:18          And um, and then that's when my blood starts fucking boiling because I realized what I just walked into. You know what I walked into? I walked into the pizza version of pink's hot dogs out here in fucking La, the pizza version of Magnolia Bakery in New York City or that fucking place. We get the hot dogs in Chicago,

Speaker 1:          52:42          you know,

Speaker 5:          52:44          hour and 15 minutes to make a fucking pizza. You can't do that guy sitting here acting like, you know,

Speaker 5:          52:53          like he's making some sort of gourmet for now. I'll tell you right now, that's my overrated for the fucking week. Standing in line at any restaurant. These, you know, the, the, the breakfast place in your neighborhood and your girlfriend's like, oh my God, the stuffed French toast is to die for and you stand there and fucking line, never worth it. It's never worth the hype, okay? If you learn anything from this podcast, other than I'm an ignorant asshole, don't ever stand in line for fucking food, okay? And less some, there's a natural disaster. The place is flooded and this dis scooping out fucking pea soup. You know, when you're putting it into your baseball hat, then you'll stand in line, soup kitchen. You stand in life, but don't stand outside these fucking places. It's stupid. It's never worth it. You know, fancy restaurants. You don't stand outside. You call up, you make a fucking reservation. But I'm not standing out there like I'm waiting to fucking

Speaker 1:          53:47          okay.

Speaker 5:          53:48          Do they even make God damn sense? You know what I mean? He's fucking people in New York. They stand outside for 90 minutes for a cupcake, for fucking cupcake. It's gone in three seconds. You know it's going to Piss me off is some people in Portland. Okay. They're actually going to figure out what pizza parlor I'm talking about and then they're going to tell, tell me dude, it's totally fucking worth it. These low self esteem Douche bags who just allow themselves to get totally treated like absolute fucking shit for pizza.

Speaker 1:          54:16          Yeah.

Speaker 5:          54:17          Yeah. Sorry, I can't make you a pizza within an hour and 15 minutes. Will you know what? Fuck you and your fucking pizza. What do you think about that and your number one God damn rating. I'll go to pizza hut. Eat their fucking slop. You. What's killing me is that I know I'm going to have to go back. I have to try it. People hyped it so much. That's what I'm really mad about is as I know. As much as I just fucking talked about that shit. I'm going to have to go back there and go get it and for all you guys wonder and yelled at Magnolia. It's a great cupcake, but it's not that great. It's not that great to have to stand there and listen to that awful conversation.

Speaker 1:          54:55          Yeah.

Speaker 5:          54:56          Now, if people driving by looking at you, trying to figure it out, what are they standing in line for?

Speaker 1:          55:01          You know

Speaker 5:          55:04          it's the president. They're doing a book signing. Is there a pornstar there? It was going to blow you at the front of the line. Can I raise the stakes for something funny within the last seven minutes? All right. Fuck this. Fuck this podcast. Here we go.
